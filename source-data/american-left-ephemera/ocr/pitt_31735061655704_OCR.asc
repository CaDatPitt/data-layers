workers to win with and support their Negro brothers and sisters
in the achievement of these objectives.

Since June of last year many things have happened—the
frame-up victims, Willie McGhee, the Martinsville Seven and
many others have died. Mobs came to Cicero, home burnings
and bombings took place, the Klan rides openly again, the old
Confederate ﬂag is being displayed openly throughout America
and often as a battle flag of our troops in Korea—this ancient
symbol of slavery and,oppression. A war in Korea has involved
our country with the colonial people of Asia. The Taft-Hartley
Act, the Smith Act and the McCarran Act, under the hysterical
lashings of the McCarthy’s and other neo-fascists threaten to
destroy all civil liberties. The Negro Labor Council, therefore,
has come into being at a time when democracy needs fearless
champions.

We accept this role that history has thrust upon us; we gladly
act as America’s conscience. We warn America that the whole
world watches. World peace hangs in the balance while the
majority of the world’s peoples are exploited and oppressed.

THE PATHWAY TO PEACE

Dr. Mordecai Johnson, President of Howard University, in
a speech made at the 1950 CIO Convention also warned our coun-
try when he said in his address, “The Pathway to Peace”:

“Now, let us take a look in all humility at these free
peoples that we are. Who are they? Britain, France, Bel-
gium, Holland, Spain, Portugal, Germany and the United
States. We are indeed the free peoples in the sense that our
domestic institutions are the free-est and the most ﬂexible
institutions on earth, but there isn't a one of us, especially
our European allies, who hasn’t been busy during the last
two hundred years securing and sustaining their freedom by
the political domination, economic exploitation and social
humiliation of over half of the human race.”

I further quote Dr. Mordecai Johnson:

“If we look at ourselves in the way that history shows
it to us, we are probably the most ruthless dominators and
exploiters and humiliators of human life that ever spanned
the pages of history. For all of a hundred years now, we
have had in our hands scientiﬁc and technical intelligence.
The most creative weapon of economic and political construc-
tiveness that ever came into the hands of men. We have
shown what we could do with that weapon by building up
the great economic and political structure of the United
States and Britain, France, Germany, and Japan.

“But for 200 years, while we have had it .in our power
to build up likewise, the economic and political freedom of
India, Africa, China, Malaya, Indo China and the peoples of
the Near East, we not only have not done so, but we have
used that very power to conquer them in war. To dominate
them politically, to exploit their natural resources and their
labor, and to segregate and humiliate them upon the land
upon which their fathers have died and in the presence of the
graves which hold the bodies of their mothers.

“For over 100 years there have been over a billion
human beings who have been seething with indignation
against us and training their thoughts to bring them to the place
where they might get out from under us and get a taste of
freedom before they die . . Now suppose you were Indo

From Paul Robeson’: Newspaper - Freedom

Chinese, wouldn’t you be amazed at us? For over 100 years
the French have been in Indo China, dominating them politi-
cally, strangling them economically, and humiliating them in
the land of their fathers.

“We haven’t ever sat down with the French and de-
manded that they change that system. And in the defect of
leadership on our part, they have turned to the Communists,
and the Communists have given them leaders, they have
trained their troops, and given them money and now it
looks as though they can win and as they are about to win
their liberty, we rush up to the scene and say, “Dear Broth-
ers, what on earth are you all getting ready to do? Are you
going to throw yourselves into the hands of this diabolical
conspiracy under the false notion they can bring you free-
dom? Why, they aren’t free; we are the free people of the

 

world, we have democratic institutions’, we are your friends,
we will send you leaders, we will send you ammunition, we
will send you bread.”

=“And they look at us in amazement and they say,
‘Brother, where have you been? Why if we’d a-known you
was a-coming we’d have baked a cake’.’’
And, believe, it or not, Phil Murray agreed with the speech.

He said, said he: “It was an inspirational address that could

only come from the soul of a man.”

MOVEMENT OI-' STRUGGLE

Brothers and sisters.’ Eloquence is a mighty weapon in the
struggle for our just demands. But what is more eloquent than
the struggle itself? The big white bosses, the men in Washing-
ton, will move far more rapidly when they see millions of us
in struggle than when they hear speeches alone.

The Negro Labor Councils are above all organizations of
struggle. We stand for the unity of all Negro workers, irre-
spective of union affiliation, organized and unorganized; for the

unity of Negro and white workers together; for the unity of ,

Negro workers with the whole Negro people in the common
ﬁght for Negro liberation; and for the alliance of the whole
Negro people with the organized labor move_ment—the keystone
combination for any kind of democratic progress in our country.

With this in mind, and looking forward to the building of
a mighty movement of Negro Labor Councils throughout the
length and breadth of the land, it is my opinion that this
founding convention should be remembered in the years to come
as the gathering which launched a major, nation-wide struggle
to win a basic Qlemand of the Negro workers and the Negro
people as a whole.

For this reason I propose that this Founding Convention
project a central natonal campaign for an Executive Order from
the President of the United States to establish a Federal Fair
Employment Practices Order and a Federal Fair Employment
Practices Committee to enforce it.

This campaign should aim at securing the signatures of
hundreds of thousands — yes, millions—of Americans, Negro and
white, on a national petition. It should include mass meetings,
use of radio and television, a drive to secure. union endorse-
ments for the Executive Order, and support from the most
varied community organizations. It should sponsor a tour of
prominent speakers. It should look to Negro History Week in
February, 1952, as a milestone in that campaign, during which
period notice should be served on the President that he is
expected to act -- and not just double-talk — for the Executive
Order.

‘ Such a national campaign will bring the Negro Labor
Councils? movement into hundred of cities and. communities
of our country. Many tens of thousands of new workers will

thereby learn of this great movement for the first time. It will
provide a splendid opportunity to establish new councils and
further build the existing ones. It will spark our great organ-
izing drive. i '

 

 

 

 

‘battle.

It will also provide a new opportunity for cooperation with
the various unions and the important civic, fraternal and church
organizations among the Negro people, thereby furthering our
basic principle of unity.

Such a national campaign, far from hindering local cam-
paigns for FEPC, for housing, against discrimination and Jim
Crow, will serve to stimulate and advance them.

This Convention will also adopt a Constitution and Pre-
amble and other important documents, all of which are of
utmost importance. These, too, are instruments in the fight. For
nothing we say or write here will have any meaning in the
weeks and months to come unless we recognize that they are
our battle-ﬂags. And battle-flags are meant to be carried into
Our great documents, our great _battle-flags, must not
be wrapped up and put away for two years after we adjourn
here tomorrow. We must carry our fighting standards out of this
convention, unfurled and into battle.

We face a number of grave tasks; We are called upon to
chart a course that will win thousands of new job opportuni-
ties for Negro men and women, that will convince the organized
labor movement to complete the organization of the South on
the basis of equality and non-segregation, ,‘ that will help bring
the franchise to all the peoples in the South.

We are on the high road to a more democratic America.
We are on the way toward breaking the grip of the Dixiecrats
and the Northern reactionaries on our national life. I know
that as you hammer out a program in these two days; you will
speed up the Freedom Train; you will give greater spirit and
meaning to the Negro Labor Councils; you will adopt the
battle-cry of the great Frederick Douglas: “Without struggle
there is no progress.”

We move on, united -- and man nor beast will turn us back.
We will achieve, in our time, for ourselves and for our children,
a world of no Jim Crow; of no more “white men’s jobs” and
“colored only” schools; a world of freedom, full equality, se-
curity and peace. Our task is clearly set forth. Brothers and
sisters, we move on to struggle and to victory! ‘

PROGRAM OF ACTION

I. THE FIGHT FOR 100,000 JOBS

The Convention‘ goes on record as immediately launching a national ﬁght
for" 100,000 new jobs by May 15th for Negro workers in areas of employ-
ment now barred to Negroes.

2. THE FIGHT FOR JOBS FOR NEGRO WOMEN

The special needs of Negro women must be the constant, and conscious,
concentration within the overall ]0b campaign.

3. THE FIGHT FOR A NATIONAL FEPC (1,000,000 SIGNATURES)

As an integral part of a ﬁght for jobs, a campaign to collect 1,000,000
signatures on a petition for a National FEPC, executive order shall be
conducted.

4. THE FIGHT FOR A "MODEL FEPC CLAUSE” IN EACH UNION
CONTRACT

The ﬁght for a “model FEPC contract clause” in every union contract must
be accelerated. Since the Chicago Conference for Negro Rights in June
1950, the UE International Union has adopted the model clause as part of
its oﬂicial union policy, with marked positive results in building unity of
Negro and white workers.

5. THE FIGHT FOR FULL FREEDOM

While training our main guns on the economic front, the Negro Labor
Council is aware of the necessity of joining in the great over all struggle
for full freedom of the Negro people in many ﬁelds of action.

We stand ready to join hands with other organizations in the general ﬁght
for Negro Rights and to initiate Campaigns in our own right where the
need exists.

 

 

 

STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES
CONSTITUTION

Preamble

We, the members of the Negro Labor Councils, believe that
the struggle of the Negro people for ﬁrst-class citizenship
based on economic, political and social equality is in vain
unless we as Negro workers, along with our white allies,
are united to protect our people (Negro) against those
forces who continue to deny us fuﬂ citizenship.

Realizing that the old forms of organizations which were
dedicated to the ﬁght for first-class citizenship for Negro
people have been unable to bring full economic oppor-
tunity for the Negro worker in the factory, the mine, the
mill, the oﬂice, in government; to stop wanton police kill-
ings of Negroes throughout the land; to stop mob violence
against us; to bring the franchise to our brothers and sisters,
in the South, and gain our full say in the political life of
our country with proper representation in government on
all levels; to buy and rent homes everywhere unrestricted;
to use public facilities, restaurants, hotels, and the recrea-
tional facilities in town and country, we form the National
Negro Labor Council (N.N.L.C.), an organization which
unites all Negro workers with other suﬂering minorities
and our allies among the white workers, and base ourselves
on rank and ﬁle control regardless of age, sex, creed, political
beliefs, or union aﬂiliation, and pursue at all times a policy
of militant struggle to improve our conditions.

We pledge ourselves to labor unitedly for the principles
herein set forth, to perpetuate our councils and work con-
certedly with other organizations that seek improvement
for Negro and other oppressed minorities.

We further pledge ourselves to work unitedly with the
trade unions to bring about greater cooperation between all
sections of the Negro people and the trade union move-
ment; to bring the principles of trade unionism to the
Negro workers everywhere; to aid the trade unions in the
great unﬁnished task of organizing the South on the basis
of fraternity, equality and unity; and to further unity be-
tween black and white workers everywhere.

UINICILIE TOM IISS

  DEAD!

Full text of address of Willicim R. Hood, delivered
at the Founding Convention of the National Negro
Labor Council at Cincinnati, Ohio, October 27, 1951

BROTHERS AND SISTERS:

This is an historic day. Onthis day we, the delegated
representatives of thousands of workers, black and white.
dedicate ourselves to the search for a new North Star,
the same star that Sojourner Truth, Nat Turner and John
Brown saw rise over the city of Cincinnati over a century
ago.

We come conscious of the new stage in the Negro
peoples’ surge toward freedom. We come to announce to
all America and to the world, that Uncle Tom is dead.
“Old Massa” lies in the cold, cold grave. Something new
is cooking on the Freedom Train.

We come here today because we are conscious at this
hour of a confronting world crisis. We are here because
many of our liberties are disappearing in the face of a
powerful war economy and grave economic problems face
working men and women everywhere. No meeting held
anywhere in America at this mid-century point in world
history can be more important nor hold more promise for
the bright future toward which humanity strives than

 

this convention of our National Negro Labor Council. For

here we have gathered the basic forces of human progress;
the proud black sons and daughters of labor and our dem-
ocratic white brothers and sisters whose increasing con-
cern for democracy, equality and peace is America's bright
hope for tomorrow.

We, the Negro working sons and daughters, have come
here to Cincinnati to keep faith with our forefathers and
mothers who landed right here from the banks of the Ohio
River in their dash for freedom from chattel slavery
through the underground railroad. We come here to pledge
ourselves that the ﬁght for economic, political and social
freedom which they began, shall not have been in vain.

Yes, we ‘are here as proud black American working
men and women; proud of the right to live, not humiliated
any. We are proud, too, because of our democratic white
brothers and sisters who have come here; proud because
these staunch allies are not afraid to stand shoulder to
shoulder with us to ﬁght for that which is right.

The Negro Labor Council is our symbol. the medium
of expression of our aims and aspirations. It is the ex-
pression of our desire and determination to bring t.o bear
our full weight to help win ﬁrst-class citizenship for every
black man, woman and child in America. We say that these
are legitimate aims. We say that these aspirations burn
ﬁercely in the breast of every Negro in America. And we
further say that millions of white workers echo our de-
mands for freedom. These white workers recognize in their
struggle for Negro rights, the prerequisites of their own
aspirations for a full life and a guarantee that the rising
tide of fascism will not engulf America.

And we say that those whites who call the National
Negro Labor Council “subversive” have an ulterior motive.
We know them for what they are—the common oppressors
of both people, Negro and white. We charge that their
false cry of “subversive” is calculated to maintain and ex-
tend that condition of common oppression. We say to
those whites: “You have never seen your mothers, sisters
and daughters turned away from thousands of factory
gates, from the air-lines, the offices, stores and other
places of desirable employment, insulted and driven into
the streets many times when they tried to eat in public
places—simply because of their color. You have never
been terrorized by the mob, shot in cold blood by the
police: you have never had your home burned when you
moved out of the ghetto into another neighborhood—
simply because you were black. You are not denied the
franchise; you are not denied credit in banks. denied in-_
surance, jobs and upgrading‘-—because of the pigmentation
of your skin. You are not denied union membership and
representation. You do not die ten years before the rest

 

of the people because of these many denials of basic rights.

“Therefore, you who call this National Negro Labor
Council “subversive” cannot understand the burning anger
of the Negro people, our desire to share the good things
our labor has produced for America. You do not under-
stand this. So you sit like Walter Winchell, one of our
attackers, in the Stork Club in New York _ and see that
great Negro woman artist, Josephine Baker, humiliated
and not raise a ﬁnger.

“The Negro Labor Council is dedicated to the proposi-
tion that these evils shall end and end soon. The world
must understand that we intend to build a stronger bond
of unity between black and white workers everywhere to
strengthen American democracy for all. If this be sub-
ver'sion—make the most of it!”

A most signiﬁcant event took place in Chicago in June
of 1950. Over nine hundred delegates, Negro and white,
gathered there to chart a course in the ﬁght for Negro
rights. They came from the mines, mills, farms and fac-
tories of America. Many of them were leaders in the
organized labor movement: seasoned, militant ﬁghters.
They voiced the complaints of Negro America.

|BILL or PARTICULARS

The delegates were told that as you looked throughout the
land you could see Negro men and women standing in long lines
before the gates of the industrial plants for jobs, only to be told
that no help was wanted—while at the same time white workers
were hired. Negro women are denied the right to work in the
basic sections of American industry, on the airlines, in the stores
and other places. Those who were hired into industry during
World War II have for the most part been systematically driven
out—often in violation of union contracts. Vast unemployment
since the war has struck the Negro community a severe blow.

UP-GRADING

In thousands of factories throughout the land Negroes were
denied upgrading and better job opportunities. Too often the
unions did not defend or fight for the- right of the Negro workers
to be upgraded. - -

APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING

We heard there in Chicago that Negro workers were denied
any apportunity to participate in the great number of appren-
ticeship training programs either in industry or in government.
in such fields as the building trades, machine tools, printing and
engraving, and other skilled fields.

 LILY-WH ITE SHOPS

We found out there that thousands of lily-white shops exist
throughout the land where no Negro has ever worked.

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT

We discovered that federal, state and city governments main-
tain a severe policy of Jim Crow discrimination, beginning with
the "White House and moving on down to the lowest level of
municipal government.

SOUTHERN ECONOMY

Our black brothers and sisters from the South told of un-
employment, low wages, wage differentials, Jim Crow unions,
p'eonage, sharecrop robbery and miserable destitution. They de-
scribed the perpetuation of conditions in Twentieth Century
America that are cruelly reminiscent of slavery.

TRADE UNION JOB DISCRIMINATION

Black ﬁremen and brakemen came to tell of the collusive
agreetments between railroads and the Railroad Brotherhoods to
throw Negroes out of the railroad industry after a hundred years
or more, and of the denial of union membership in these unions

and. no representation. A number of AF of L unions were singled ’

out for their policy of exclusion and job “monkey business” as
regards black workers. We also learned that the CIO had joined
the war crowd of colonial oppression and exploitation and was
running fast from its early position of the thirties when with John
L. Lewis at its head it really fought for Negro rights.

CIVIL RIGHTS

Many of the delegates were stunned to hear of the thousands
of denials of civil rights in public places in every -state in the
union. We were saddened and angered when we heard about the
frameups of- the Martinsville Seven, Willie McGhee, the Trenton
Six and of countless other Negroes because they were black and
for no other reason. We were horrified to hear of the many
police killings of Negroes from New York City to Birmingham,
Alabama.

Negro families were still hemmed into the ghettos, charged
higher rents — chained by restrictive covenants, mob terror and
finally even bombed if they were not lucky or able to move out
in time. The rats are given ample opportunity to wreak their
damage upon human‘ beings, their destruction through disease
and death.

Our delegates made it clear in that 1950 convention that
inferior Jim Crow schools are still the policy in the South and
Jim Crow quotas in the colleges of the North. The desire of
black children for education and a full, useful life is yet a
dream unrealized. ..

_ THE MANDATE

Is there any wonder then that this great Chicago gathering
of. the black working sons and daughters of our land said that
this oppression can no longer exist in our America? Or is it any
wonder that we received the full support of those stalwart, dem-

 

 

 

 

 

ocratic white workers present there who truly love democracy
and recognize our common, basic unity of interests? So it was
that they, in all righteous indignation, gave unto us, the contin-
uators’ organization,‘ a mandate. They said to us: “Go out and
build strong the Negro Labor Councils throughout the land.
Build "them into instruments of democracy, equality and unity.”

They gave unto us the main task of fighting’ on that front
which we knew best——the economic front for jobs, upgrading, “for
an end to the lily-white shops, for apprenticeship training, gov-
ernment jobs, local and State fair employment practices legis-
lation, the non-discrimination clause in union contracts and
finally, with emphasis, the right of Negro women to work any-
where and everywhere.

They gave unto us the mandate to build an organization com-
posed in the main of Negro workers, united and determined to
wage an uncompromising struggle against Jim Crow—to build
an organization which can unite with white workers who are
willing to accept and support our program——to exclude no free-
dom fighter!

That mandate commissioned us to cooperate with those ex-
isting organizations, community and trade union, which have
undertaken genuine campaigns for the full citizenship of the
Negro people.

We were directed to build a new type of organization—not
an organization to compete with those existing organizations of
the Negro people already at work on many civil rights struggles.
The delegates who met at Chicago demanded an organization of
Negro workers from a wide variety of industries, organized and
unorganized, from the great industrial centers of the North, the
urban communities of the South and the farm workers from the
great rural areas. Such an organization will encourage Negroes
to join unions and urge unions to organize Negroes. It will call
upon the entire Negro people to support labor’s fight.

Unity of Negro and White Basis for
Victory for Labor and Negro People

To the Negro people they told us to say: In the Civil War
thousands upon thousands of Negro workers who took arms in
the Union cause won, not only their own freedom—the freedom
of the Negro people—but by abolishing the institution of slave
labor, provided the basis for the development of free trade unions
in the United States.

And so, even today, as the Nation-al Negro Labor Council
charts the course ahead to help the whole Negro people and their
sincere allies, we sound a warning» note to American reaction
and bigotry. For if ﬁfteen million Negroes, led by their alert
sons and daughters of labor, and united together and joined by
the 15 million organized white workers in the great American
labor movements say that there shall be no more Jim Crow in
America-—then there shall be no more Jim Crow!

If’30 million Americans-15 million Negro people united with

‘ 15 million workers--join with the Jewish peopleto say there shall

 

 

be no more anti-Semitism, and mean it, then there will be no
more anti-Semitism!

If ﬁfteen million Negroes, inspired by their true leaders of
labor, united with their natural allies in the trade unions, demand
an end to the persecution of the foreign-born, then the perscution
of the foreign-born will end!

If these 30 million—black and white alike—say: “Leave
DuBois and Robeson and Patterson alone, for they speak for our
freedom”—-they will be left alone!

If this same combination speaks with one united voice for
peace-——America will make peace!

We, your black sons and daughters, pledge to you that we
have a pool of mighty strength to put at your service, to the end
that you will have economic, political and social equality, so that
you might enjoy the great and good things of our land.

We say to you: “Be conﬁdent for we have brought to this
great, democratic ﬁght many white workers who love democracy
and who know that we have worked side by side with them,
fought side by side with them on the picket lines against the
giant corporations. And they know that we know—-and will not
be divided from us no matter what.”

There are great walls in our U. S. Democracy. There are
great barriers behind which men's minds, souls, bodies and spirits
are imprisoned by poverty, illiteracy, disease, and deceit. With
our new John Browns we will break down these discriminatory
barriers. Yes, we will break down these great walls of hypoc-

racy, together with our new John Browns, and march on for full_

and complete emancipation for the Negro people.

And behind the ﬁfteen million Negroes of the United States
stand l80.mil1ion of our African brothers and sisters, sixty mil-
lion of our kindred in the West Indies and South and Central
America—for whom, as for us, war and the Point Four program
would mean continued slavery and exploitation.

As our new and so vitally needed organization entersinto
the ﬁght for the rights of the Negro people, we extend our hand
in unity and cooperation to other great Negro organizations which
have historically struggled for these objectives. And we may

repeat here that we are mandated to concentrate our ﬁre upon

that area we as workers know best-the economic front.

To George Schuyler of the Pittsburgh Courier, to Lester
Granger of the Urban League, to Councilman Jesse D. Locker of
Cincinnati—all of whom attacked our Council at the beck and
call of the big white folks, we warn you: “Negro America is
mad, hurt and humiliated. You have spent your lives growing
fat on Jim Crow while our brothers and sisters cannot find jobs,
are shot down in cold blood, have their homes burned and bombed.
You may yell when the big while folks tell you to, in order to
keep us down, but the day of the white-haired “Uncle Toms” and
the sleek “Uncle Thomas” is at an end.”

A Since June of last year, Negro Labor Councils have sprung
up throughout the country——North, East, South and West. The

 

 

 

response of Negro workers to the opportunity to unite their
strength has been overwhelming. The only question most of
them have asked is whether or not the Council is a hard-hitting
organization.

Our Councils have begun tackling the task given us by the
Chicago Conference for Negro Rights. A number of Councils are,
carrying on campaigns to end discrimination in apprenticeship
training set up by the skilled trades. We have sought to do this
in conjunction with the unions in the ﬁeld, the employer and
government agencies.

Lest we be misunderstood, however, we intend to take any
and all necessary steps to win. We have begun campaigns to
convince the trade unions to adopt our model anti-discrimination
contract clause. We have been carrying on campaigns for City
and ‘State FEPC legislation with teeth. The outstanding of such
campaigns was a campaign led in Detroit by the Greater Detroit
Negro Labor Council. Our Council there secured some forty
thousand signatures to petitions for referendum by the voters of
Detroit. The enemies of FEIPC and the mealy-mouth hush-hushers
did and are doing everything they can to keep fair employment
practices off the ballot, while the City Council still refuses to pass
any FEPC legislation.

During the course of our Council building there has been
opposition from some of the trade union leaders, particularly to
this Convention. They have accused us of attempting dual union-
ism, and some of them have gone so far as to advise Negro work-
ers not to participate in this convention. To them we say: “Look
at the Bill of Particulars, then tell us if it is not true that we
are second-class citizens in this land. Negro are still barred from
many trade unions in this country, denied apprenticeship train-
ing, upgrading and refused jobs in many, many places.”

"We are not represented in the policy-making bodies of most
International unions. We say when the mobs came to Emerald
Street in Chicago and to Cicero, Illinois, we did not see the great
trade unions move. Yet, the basic right to live in Cicero was
denied, not only to the family of Harvey Clark, but to the Negro
people as a whole. We say that we will no longer permit the
