The vastness of the business has made it respectable,
exempting it from the general condemnation that smaller
rackets evoke. Nevertheless, investigators of industrial in-
surance have arisen to protest against its iniquities. Com-
prehensive indictments have been drawn up by Dr.
Maurice Taylor, Percy E. Budlong, Jack Bradon, L. Seth
Schnitman, Abraham Epstein and others. Nor does one
have to be an expert to discover the defectiveness of in-
dustrial insurance. The discovery weighs heavily upon the
consciences of most of the men who sell it. When Abraham
Epstein published an article entitled “The Insurance
Racket,” in the American Mercu/ry (September, 1930),
many industrial agents wrote to him, bewailing and apol-
ogizing for their calling. Here are excerpts from two
typical letters:

“As an industrial agent I feel you merit the thanks of the
thousands of industrial insurance agents who are daily driven
and hounded to sell this petty larceny form of insurance. We . .
agents sell this stuff, but we hate to do it; we know that the
companies are robbing the industrial classes with a contract

which is scandalously exhorbitant in rate and negligible in
beneﬁts.”

“I had agents come to my home and tell 1ne with tears
in their eyes that they hate this industrial insurance robbery
but they cannot help it. Their wives and children must eat.”

Faﬁening on the Poor

Industrial insurance is big business, levying an enor-
mous tribute upon those least able to pay. Masquerading as
a benevolent institution devoted to the protection of
widows and orphans, it has prospered at the expense of
its ostensible beneﬁciaries. Some indication of what this
expense has been may be gleaned from its phenomenal

10

 

size and growth. In 1910, industrial insurance cost the
working class 103 million dollars 5 in 1920, $257 million;
in ﬁve years the expenditure jumped to half a billion; by
1930, it reached $803 million and has been able to hold its
own against the storms of the past ﬁve years. Here is
aggrandizement with a Vengeance: Industrial insurance is
a business that, barring economic calamity, doubles itself
as a matter of course every few years. The familiar law
of concentration has not spared industrial insurance. Of
the sixty—ﬁVe companies reporting to the Insurance Year
Book, the “Big Three”—-——the Metropolitan, the Prudential
and the John Hancock——account for almost nine—tenths
of the business.

High-Fa|uﬁn' Words Hide Methods

‘On the face of it, industrial insurance is healthy enough
and big enough to protect the working class against cer--
tain hazards. Yet it has failed—miserably. Back in 1906,
Louis D. Brandeis, now a Supreme Court Justice, dubbed
industrial insurance “The greatest life—insurance wrong.”
Let us examine the business as it is today, to determine, on
the basis of accomplishment, whether there is any founda-
tion to the widespread belief that the wrong has been
righted. V _ V

The best way to begin is to look at a policy. One’s
suspicions are aroused immediatey by the abstruseness of
the terminology employed. The opening paragraph of a
Metropolitan contract will illustrate:

“In consideration of the payment of the premium stated in
the schedule on page 4- hereon, on or before each Monday doth
hereby agree subject to the conditions below and on page 2
hereof each of which is hereby made a part of this-contract

lle

 

 

and contracted by every person entitled to claim hereunder to
be a part hereof to pay as an endowment 20 years from the
date hereof if the insured be then living, upon surrender of
this policy and evidence of premium payment hereunder, the
amount stipulated in said schedule.”

Well, skip it. The point to be observed is that this is
part of a contract, to be read and signed by two parties,
henceforth binding them to certain conditions; the com-
pany deliberately makes the contract so unintelligible to
the buyer that he will know nothing of What he is getting.
The reasons behind the obfuscation become apparent when
we consider the disadvantageous terms and provisions
which he unwittingly accepts.

The Sound Health Clause

The most inexcusable of these provisions is the so-called
Express Warranty or “Sound Health” clause. Industrial
insurance presumably olfers protection without evidence
of insurability, no medical examination being required.
This is, of course, a good sales—point on its face 5 the catch
is that the examination may be made after death through
an application of the “Sound Health” clause. Stripped of
verbiage, the “Sound Health” clause declares that if the
policy—holder is not in “sound health” on the date the
policy is issued, or if he has ever had any one of a long
list of diseases, the policy is void; in that case, the com-
pany need not pay a death claim, its liability being limited
to returning the premiums paid on the policy. Most indus-
trial policy—holders never heard of the clause; those who
have do not understand that its effect is to destroy the
certainty of protection, since any one of the diseases may
be present in a latent form without the knowledge of the

12

    

 

  

“insured.” Every physician knows that the Victims of such
diseases are usually not aware of their existence until the
advanced stages set in 5 moreover, few people who reach
middle—age escape the incipient stage of at least one of
the catalog of ailments listed in Express Warranty.
The Surpeme Court of Nebraska comments (49 Nebr.
842):
“What sane man would consciously warrant that ever since
his childhood he had not had any disease of the heart, liver,
lungs, kidneys, bladder, stomach, or bowels? No sane man
would consciously consent that on the literal truth of his

negative answer . . . should depend the validity of a life-
insurance policy.”

In 282 Southwestern Reporter, 633, it is held:

“It would seem unjust to void a policy based upon statements
made in good faith by proving after death by expert medical
examiners that in their opinion death was caused by some latent
ailment of which the insured’ . . . knew nothing and had no
means of knowing, in the absence of a medical examination.”

Wanted: the Perfect Men

The company does more than protect itself against fraud
on the part of the applicant: through the Express War-
ranty provision, it protects itself against his lack of omnis-
cience. Percy E. Budlong, oﬂicial reporter of the United
States Senate, points out the injustice of the clause:

“No one will claim that educated and experienced business
men could be sold an ordinary life policy containing a binding
condition precedent of absolute freedom from disease. No
shipowner would speciﬁcally warrant his Vessel free from all

concealed defects in hull or machinery. . . . No owner of a
building would warrant that there was no ﬁre risk about his

13‘

    

A premises. Then why make the poor, ignorant industrial appli-
cant warrant that he is and always has been perfectly healthy.”

That the provision tends to defeat the purpose of in-
surance is attested by the innumerable court cases on rec-
ord. Case after case concerns beneﬁciaries Who, suing to
collect the death beneﬁt promised in the policy, were suc-
cessfully denied any compensation on the ground that, at
the issue—date of the contract, the “insured” had a latent
disease which subsequently proved fatal. There are even
cases in which the policy was voided because of an incipient
disease which contributed nothing to the death of the
policy—holder. In the instance of Barker V. Metropolitan
Life (188 Mass. 5 34), after the company physician had
declared the insured to be in sound health, it later ap—
peared that he had cystic disease of the kidneys. The
insured ultimately died-—of pneumonia. The company
repudiated the ﬁndings of its own doctor, but failed to
show any connection between the pneumonia and the
alleged kidney disease. In its refusal to allow a death
beneﬁt, itiwas, nevertheless, sustained by the courts.
Another case: a policy—holder who apparently had hernia
when he bought the policy, succumbed to Valvular heart
disease and dropsy (184 Indiana, 722). The court held
that inasmuch as the policy was voided by the existence
of hernia, the actual causes of death could have no inﬂu-
ence upon such a policy.

On the basis of the “Sound Health” clause alone, it
can be seen that an industrial policy is a gamble. Not
until after the death of the insured can the beneﬁciary
know whether the contract was ever in force. If the com-
pany contests the.policy, the beneﬁciary—notwithstan.ding
his hypothetical equality before the laW—-is compelled to
14- I

accept whatever terms of settlement the company deigns
to offer. For the class served by industrial insurance
cannot afford the expense and delay of litigation; the
company, on the other hand, is prepared to use the best
legal talent available and to appeal and re—appeal if the
verdict should be adverse.

Anoiher Catch

Policy—holders overlook the intent of Express War-
ranty not only because it is obscurely worded, but be-
cause another provision apparently nulliﬁes it. This pro-
vision—and agents are always quick to point it out to the
prospective buyer-—is the Incontestability Clause. Unlike
the rest of the contract, it is distinguished for its lucidity,
since it is a selling-point. Its main portion reads:

“After this policy shall have been in force, during the life-
time of.the insured, for one full year from its date, it shall
be incontestable, except for non-payment of premium.”

The clause is nicely worded and should sound very
good with music. It should especially hearten those who
have been denied a‘ death beneﬁt by virtue of the Express
Warranty provision. How, it may be asked, can the two
clauses be reconciled? The joker is contained in the words
shall have been in force. Although the insured pays
premiums for a number of years, that fact alone does not
signify that the policy was ever in force. The company
is contractually justiﬁed in its contention that, if the
“Sound Health” clause was violated, the policy has been
void from the beginning. It is tricky but true that a
policy which has never been in force can never be incon-
testable. This delightful technicality, it should be men-

15

l

  

tioned, has so oﬁended the sense of ﬁtness of several
judges when it has been raised in court, that the com-
panies Were subjected to blistering censure. Consequently,
as far as the courts are concerned, the argument is falling
into disuse; the companies still employ it, however, in the
unrecorded thousands of cases that never come to court.

Company Can Pick Beneficiary

Another questionable provision in the contract, one
which has been the source of considerable dispute and dis-
appointment, is the “Facility—of—Payment” clause. In sub-
stance it provides that:

“The company may make any payment provided herein to
the insured, or to any relative by blood or connection by
marriage of the insured, or to any other person appearing to the
company to be equitably entitled to such payment by reason of
having incurred expense on behalf of the insured, or for his
or her burial; and the production of a receipt signed by any
of said persons shall be conclusive evidence that all claims under
this policy have been satisﬁed.”

In other Words, the company can legally discharge all
its obligations by paying any relative of the policy-holder
or a virtual stranger, such as an undertaker. What is more,
if the ‘company can ﬁnd someone who is willing to accept
less than the amount called for, and can persuade him to
sign a receipt, it is absolved from any further payment.
The average policy-holder believes that the beneﬁciary
he selected at the time he signed his application will re—
ceive the proceeds of his policy when it matures as a death

claim. While they encourage him in this belief, it is not

warranted: at his death, the company has the contractual
right to ignore his intended beneﬁciary.

16

 

 

Specious Excuse

The companies defend this right on the ground that it A

“facilitates” settlement of the claim. Admitting the ele-
ment of truth in their contention, it is still obvious that
the clause is open to the grossest of abuse. Citation of a
few court cases will illustrate how it can thwart the express
wishes of the policy—holder. In the case of Brennan V.
Prudential Insurance Company (32 Atlantic Reporter
1042), the sentiment of the Court of Common Pleas of
Lackawanna County, Pa., is of interest:

“Here the company paid but a part of the money [less than
half], and set up this to bar the whole. This, it is contended,
does not fall within the strict terms of the policy, because it
is only the payment of the amount named in the policy, and
the production of a receipt for that full amount, that is to
work satisfaction. To allow of anything less than this, it is

. argued, is to invite fraud. If the company may select their own
party, and settle with him on his own terms, they can pick up
anybody, and discharge themselves with a mere song.”

The case moved on to the trial court which, though
granting the reasonablenessof the foregoing argument,
was compelled nonetheless to sustain the company. Com-
menting upon the inclusive powers which the “Facility-of-
Payment” clause confers upon the company, the trial
justice said: ,

“If, therefore, the company may determine to whom they
will pay, they may also make their own terms with him; and
if he sees ﬁt to take 50 cents on the dollar, or any other sum,
in settlement of the amount insured, it concerns no one but
himself, and the company are discharged.”

In the case of Diggs V. Metropolitan Life (Vol. 70,

Pittsburgh Legal Journal, p. 988), the syllabus informs

us that: .
17

 

“Plaintiff, brother and beneﬁciary of [the deceased policy-
holder] sued to recover on a policy which contained the ‘facil-
ity of payment’ clause. . . . The evidence showed that the
brother . . . who was beneﬁciary in the policy, acting upon his
supposed right to the money, had incurred the expense of bury-
ing the insured, and the husband, who received the money from
the company, paid no part of these expenses.”

Adhering to the letter of the contract, the Common
Pleas Court of Allegheny County upheld the company,
but remarked:

“We do not understand why people buy and pay for insur-
ance of this kind. It is no doubt true that the clause in question
would sometimes prevent expense [and litigation], but it cer-
tainly puts in the hands of the agents of companies carrying
on this sort of insurance a power which is very likely to be
abused, especially if it be allowed that a payment of less than
the whole sum is suﬂicient to discharge the company, as the
agent will be lihely to pay the party who is willing to take the
least money. We cannot help hut believe that a great injustice
has been done . . . but we do not see how it can he remediei,
in view of the term: of the policy.” [Our emphasis.]

Ordinary Policy Better

The two provisions already eXamined—Express War-
ranty and “Facility-of-Payment”—in themselves establish
the Vicious onesidedness of the industrial contract. Indeed,
the Very right of an industrial policy to be called a con-
tract is open to question. Its deﬁciencies show up glaringly
if We compare it with an ordinary life-insurance policy
which is designed, not for the Working class, but for the
middle and upper classes. First of all, the ordinary policy
contains neither of the objectionable clauses: the policy is
incontestable after one or two years with no strings at-

18

 

 

tached, and the death beneﬁt is promptly paid to the
beneﬁciary previously chosen by the insured.

Can Be Used for Loans

An ordinary policy, moreover, is assignable; that is, it
can be used as security for an outside loan 5 the policy-
holder simply designates the lender as the person to
Whom he Wants the death claim paid. An industrial policy
is not assignable, its holder cannot oﬁer it as security for
a loan and no lender would accept it if he did, since neither
the insured nor the creditor knows who will receive the
death payment. This provision, known as “InValidity of
Assignment,” destroys much of the usefulness of the
policy during the life of the insured.

The ordinary policy, after its third year, grants a loan
privilege to the policy-holder; he may borrow as much
cash as the policy contains, leaving the protection in force.
Industrials have no loan value at any time, the only Way
a policy-holder can retrieve any of his cash is to carry the
policy for a full ten years, after which he Way surrender
it for a small part of what he has paid in and cancel the
insurance. In this connection it is Worth mentioning that
most industrials taken out do not survive the ﬁrst year.

So much for the comparison of provisions. Discriminat-
ing against the industrial policy-holder at every turn, the
company, as Jack Bradon has stated, “assumes the right
to dictate the rights and obligations of both parties to the
contract, and the insured is bound by the discretion of
the other party to the contract.”

Pay More for Less
Industrial insurance, even if We forget for the moment

its outrageously inequitable features, must be condemned
for its excessively high cost. Ordinary insurance costs far
more than it should- a ,cmo‘mparati”ve»_p;;e_miu,rn_Wanalysis 

more than ordinary. In Tact, the usual comparison is made

‘“6H”‘£h¢’ 'B?é§i§”t5fi"”“”net cost”—-computed by adding the

premiums for ten years and deducting the cash surrender
value available in the policy at the end of that time. While
for technical reasons We do not approve of the net—cost
analysis, it is admissible in the present instance. The
comparison is startling: the holder of an industrial whole-
life policy has a net—cost eig/it times higher t/um that of
the holder of an ordinary ‘w/iole—life policy. In the Won-
derland of life insurance, the most extortionate type of
protection is reserved for the poorest people.

As a partial extenuation of the industrial rates, it may

be said that the ineﬂicient weekly method of collecting ‘

premiums entails a greater overhead expense. Assuming
the validity of the argument, the fact remains that the
blame rests not with the industrial policy-holders but
rather With the companies. They have learned that the
largest proﬁts come from the existing set—up, nothing,
therefore, could induce them to abandon it. The con-
tinuance of the business depends upon the Well-trained
army of sharp, smooth—talking agents Who, actuated by
the slogan “Keep Up Production,” use every means to
foist more and more policies on a market already over-

sold.
Greaf Loss Through Lapsing

In View of the high—pressure Way industrial insurance
is peddled, in View of its exorbitant cost, it is not surprising

Very Little Death Beneﬁf Paid

We are now approaching the crucial test of any system
of insurance. The only valid reason for the existence of
life insurance is that it presumably insures against the
ﬁnancial loss occasioned by death; the payment of death
beneﬁts is its sole object, and unless it eﬂiciently fulﬁlls
that object, it fails as a protection device. What per cent
of every thousand dollars taken oﬁ the books in 1934
went to pay death beneﬁts? The answer, according to the
most reliable statistics, is three per cent! In 1934, when
billions of dollars were completely lost through lapse,
when an additional billion went for surrender, the com-

21

  

panies actually paid death claims amounting to only 15 3
million dollars. The exact ﬁgures, taken from the I mur-
zmce Year Book (for the year ending December 31, 1934-),
pp. 412-413, are as follows:

The failure of industrial insurance to insure could not
be more absolute.

What can be done about industrial insurance? Those '

who expect us to propose reforms will be disappointed.

The question is not one of lowering rates or of liberalizing 9

policy provisions. We can suggest, of course, that indus-
trial policy-holders who have the means, buy ordinary in-
surance and drop their present industrial policies, accept-
ing, wherever possible, one of the “non—forfeiture” op-
tions. Others will be wise to discontinue their industrial
insurance in favor of the policies issued by "the Interna-
tional Workers Order, a fraternal organization admin-
istered by the working class and offering death- and sick-
beneﬁts for remarkably low rates.

Government Responsibi|i+y

_Merely to state the possible remedies, however, is to
demonstrate their inadequacy. The simple and obvious
truth is that the American working class cannot afford
to pay for any insurance. We believe it is not essential
here to dwell upon the statistics relating to the meager

22

 

 

 

annual income of the average worker. Only in the light
of his insuﬂiciency of income, it must be emphasized, does
the Viciousness of industrial insurance become truly ex-

 Billions of dollars that might have been spent for
ecessaries of life, for milk and bread, have run to
Waste for ﬂimsy insurance. In the impoverishment of the
working class, the industrial—insurance companies have
done their part.

There is but one practical and humane program. The
federal government must be forced to assume the respons-
ibility of insuring the Working class. That responsibility
should not be conﬁned to the payment of death beneﬁts——
just as the insecurity of workers is not limited to the
hazard of sudden death. The program must include a
well-rounded, comprehensive system of social insurance,
no expense of which should be borne by. the Workers.
Inasmuch as all the so—called contributory schemes of so-
cial insurance, such as the Wagner-Lewis “Social Security”
Bill, must ultimately be paid for by those least able to
bear the cost, they can be regarded as little more than a
bookkeeping trick. Only a form of social insurance main-
tained by taxation of the upper—income groups can afford
the Working class the security it needs. Workers can win
such insurance—perhaps including “burial insurance”—
by “burying” their representatives in Congress under an
avalanche of demands for the one adequate measure—
the Workers Unemployment, Old Age and Social Insur-
ance Act, known all over the country as the Lundeen Bill.

 Industrial Insurance
A Snare for Workers

by
Mom‘ AND E. A. GILBERT
Autﬁor: of
“Life Insurance: A Legalized Raci<et”v

 

 

INTRODUCTION '

The Gilberts expose, in this pamphlet, the methods
used by the life insurance companies to coin millions each
year through the sale of “protection” in the form of in-
dustrial insurance policies.

They have made a ﬁrst hand study of insurance and
have Written a book on the subject entitled, “Life Insur-
ance: A Legalized Racket”. This book has been hailed by
such outstanding men in the insurance ﬁeld as Abraham
Epstein, Executive Secretary, American Association for
Social Security, who Wrote an introduction to the book.

Proﬁtable Business

The desire of the American people for protection
against insecurity has been transformed into a proﬁtable
business, involving billions of dollars. How much of these

-billions paid in by the workers actually gets back to them

in the form of the protection they started out to buy for
themselves? This, say the Gilberts, is the test of any
insurance. Their answer is astounding! It explains how
the insurance companies have been able to accumulate
billions in their treasuries. The Gilberts state that the
answer to this question, according to the most reliable
statistics, is that only 3% of every thousand dollars taken
off the books of the industrial insurance companies in 1934
went to pay death benefits on industrial policies.

High Pressure Insurance

Thousands upon thousands of insurance agents are
employed by the insurance companies to canvass the homes
5

of Workers and “sell” them insurance. These agents talk
to the people about a real problem——the problem of in-

security. No person wants to remain insecure—-every one

Wants to provide for an emergency—to guarantee some
money for the family in the event of disability or death.

The agent, through a Well—prepared speech about pro-
tection for the Wife and kids, clinches his “sale” by talk
about the “easy payment plan” of industrial insurance——
all” it requires is your signature on the contract and a nickel,
a. dime, or a quarter a Week and your problems are solved.
It is’ made to sound just as easy as that!

If the policy—holder would really read through his
contract—-—and if he was in a position to get an understand-
ing of the Verbose and legalistic language employed in the
contract he is binding himself to——he would not sign in the
first place.

Most people look upon insurance as somewhat of a
gamble—the insurance company is taking a gamble on
your life. Insurance is far from a gamble. It is a business
run on a scientiﬁc basis. It is far from a hit or miss
proposition.

All Figured Out

The insurance companies know just how many out of
a thousand people of a given age will die in one year——
and it then becomes a comparatively simple matter to
figure out the risk involved, and distribute it among the
thousand people.

For example: Out of a thousand people aged 35,
statistics show that 8.95 will die in a year——that is, 9 out
of the thousand will die in a year. Each of these thousand
people contract for $500.00 insurance. The company
knows that it will have to pay out in a year 9 x $500 in

death claims—a total of $4,500. Each of the 1,000 in-
sured people Will have to cover this cost—in other words,
each person will have to pay about $4.50 for his insur-
ance (for the sake of simpliﬁcation, We do not here take
into consideration the cost of administration, overhead,
interest, etc., which enter into the computation of the
rate).

Once this is understood, then insurance ﬁgures and
rates become no longer the deep dark secrets they are made
to appear by the insurance companies. Then it is quite
easy for a Worker to understand the tremendous sums he
is paying for his insurance.

The worker who needs the insurance should know
What he is getting and how much it is costing him. He
should know that eventual lapse or surrender is the in-
evitable destiny of 19 out of 20 industrial policies and
know WHY?

Fraternal Societies

Every person harassed by the problem of insecurity—
seeking a partial solution through the purchase of insur-
ance, Will, as a result of the information gotten from this
pamphlet, be in :1 much better position to expend What
little he can for insurance in a Way that will beneﬁt him
most. /

The Gilberts offer a substitute to the deceptive and
costly industrial insurance by urging membership in fra-
ternal organizations.

Fraternal societies are non—proﬁt—making organizations
Whose very basis for existence is mutual—aid to its mem-
bership. Membership in such organizations oﬂering in-
surance, sick beneﬁts, and other forms of protection, is to
be preferred to membership in insurance companies. Fra-

ternal societies are membership organizations, with the
membership having a share in the governing of the or-
ganization.

Insurance companies, as commercial enterprises, are
headed by high—sa.laried oﬁicials with salaries ranging as
high as $250,000 a year. The policy—holder has very
little, if any, say at all in the running of the organization.
Tremendous sums of money are spent for administration,
advertising and other high—pressure salesmanship, the
money for which comes out of the premiums paid by the
policy—holder for insurance protection.

The authors consider the International Workers
Order, a chartered Workers fraternal society with its na-
tional ofﬁce at 80 Fifth Avenue, New York, as one of
the best in the fraternal ﬁeld oﬁering death and sick
beneﬁts and medical service for remarkably low rates.

Social Insurance

The most practical, humane and just program to in-
sure the Working class and all smaller income groups
against the spectre of insecuz.-ity is unemployment and
social insurance provided by the government and ﬁnanced
by taxing the Wealthy of the country.

Supporting labor in their ﬁght for such program all
progressive fraternal societies advocate the passage by con-
gress of the Workers Unemployment, Old Age and Social
Insurance Act known as the Frazier-Lundeen, Bill. The
international Workers Order, for instance, has actively
participated in the campaign for the passage of the bill.

Industrial Insurance
A Snare for Workers

By MORT GILBERT and E. A. GILBERT

AMERICAN workers are bitterly aware of their need

for life insurance. For them, the menace of insecur-
ity, the threat of sudden death attended by pauperburial
and unprotected dependents, are formidable and ever-
present. So it is a holiday task for the largest and most
efficient high-pressure selling organizations in the World
to induce them to carry industrial insurance—on the “easy-
payment” plan. This form of insurance provides a few
hundred dollars in the event of death and calls for a
Weekly outlay of ﬁve cents or a small multiple of that
amount, such as a dime, ﬁfteen cents or a quarter. Hence,
it is commonly known as “Five-and—Dime” insurance.

Burial Insurance

Another current term for this kind of protection is
“burial” insurance. Fifty million workers or their chil-
dren can theoretically have funerals costing an aggregate
sum of seventeen billion dollars—the total face amount
of the insurance in force. Burial insurance? In one year,
the nickels and dimes which the working class “buries” in
the insurance companies amount to eight hundred million
dollars. The average Worker, that is to say, expends about
six per cent of his annual income for the single item of
industrial insurance.
