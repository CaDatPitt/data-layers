"He's ]us+ a s+rike breaker. +rying +o s+op +he workers

"Bu+ maybe he's righ+." said Pa+chy Dooling. dubiously.
"Maybe +here are some Reds in +he s+rike who wan+ +o over-

"Aw. +ha+'s ius+ +he old 'red scare’ he's +hrowing around."
said Mickey. "Every+ime +he workers organize +o s+rike +he

wi+h +he res+ of +he workers for decen+ wages."

"Bu+ reds do wan+ +o over+hrow +he governmen+," per-

"And yeah, bu+ when? When +he maiori+y o+ +he work-

"Well. I guess i+'ll be all righ+ +o have a revolu+ion when

"Bu+ we ough+ +o do some+hing abou+ Mr. Pri+chard.
He's ius+ a s+rike-breakerl" V

"No+ so loud. Mickey." murmured Miss Thompson. his

Mickey smiled a+ her. 0+ all his +eachers. she was +he
only one who. as Mickey pu+ i+. "knew wha+ i+ was all abou+."
She was always warning him. +hough. +o be careful wha+ he
said and +0 whom he said i+. And +o Mickey, +his was hard

and +ell o+hers. He couldn'+ le+ anyone +ell lies abou+ +he

he would have go++en righ+ up and answered Mr. Pri+chard.

s

if he had nol caughf Miss Thompson's eye at +ha’r momenf
and seen her shake her head. So when in English class his
‘leacher repealed wha’r lhe principal had said. Mickey found
‘himself on his feel. repealing wha’r he had said 1'0 Pa’rchy
in {he morning. He was sen1' al' once lo lhe principal. and
am‘ 3:30 ’rha+ aflernoon ’rhe whole school knew ’rha1' Mickey
Carson was expelled.

LiHle rings 01‘ Mickey's class males and o’rhers who had

"Jusl for felling fhe ’rru+h abouf ’rhe slrike. he gels ex-

"Aﬁer Mr. Prifchard gof up ‘here and lold us our falhers
shouldn'l' slrikel"

"l fhink il"s lousy!"

"l fhink we oughf ’ro do somelhingl"

Jusf 1'hen Mr. Prifchard came out .

"Wha+ are you sfanding around here for?" he asked.
"Go home. Don'l' sland around here!"

"lf's not his s1‘ree’r." said Palchy.

"Come on over lo our headquarlers." said Dave, a

Pioneer. "H's righl around ’rhe corner. We can ’ralk °

Almosl a hundred indignanf boys and girls followed Dave
+0 lhe Pioneer headquarlers. Laler some more came. Dave
ran around lo gel Lillian, fheir leader.

When she came. she knew all abouf ’rhe case. And fhere
was Mickey. foo.

"Wha+ did he say?"

"Wha1' did you say?"

Affer lhe s’rory was fold. ’rhey all fell lhaf fhey had lo do

And from {he boys and girls came one answer as 1-0 whal-

"they should do. A slrike, of course! Were nol' fhe knif-

goods workers sfriking for recogniﬁon of fheir union and
decem‘ working condi+ions?—"And ’rhe resf oi ’rhem are

would do lhe same ’rhing!

A s'|'rike means a lo} 01‘ work. You mus’r visif as many

‘those who are going lo school nof lo go. You have ‘lo

The demands in +his s’rrike were:

(I) Thai no feacher or principal should speak againsf ’rhe
knif goods s-lrikers.

(2) Thaf Mickey should be reins’ra’red immediafely.

(3) Thai' none of {he school s’rrikers should be punished

So {he nex’r morning found a pickef line in iron!" of P. S.

said Mickey had been expelled for "bad conducf generally"

Bum‘ ’rhe boys and girls of P. S. 68 know why he had ‘lo say

Every aﬂernoon affer ’rha1‘ ’rhe boys and girls went down

A Pioneer ol lhe Soulh

Leslie is a Pioneer who lives in lhe black bell ol lhe Soulh.
where Negro farmers and lheir wives and children (even
lillle ones lour years old) work from sunrise lill sunsel on
pieces of land renled lrom lhe landlord. and slill don'l have
enough lo eal or wear. In lacl, lhey are always in debl lo
lhe landlord, who demands higher renls lhan lhese farmers
or sharecroppers can allord lo pay. Solhe cropper musl

slay on lhe land because he owes money lo lhe landlord.

He can'l even leave lhe land and go somewhere else where
he mighl be able lo earn a living. He is iusl a slave.

The share croppers decided lo lorm a union a few years '
ago. Of course lhe while Soulhern "genllemen" did nol

like lhal. ln lacl. lhey were lurious.

Why, lo lhink lhal lhose "niggers" would have lhe nerve,
of all lhings. lo lorm a union! So lhe landlords organized
lhe Ku Klux Klan and olher bands ol gangslers lo raid lhe
meelings of lhe Share Croppers Union and lo kill lhe lead-
ers. Ralph Grey. one of lhe leaders of lhe Union. was shol
and killed nol long ago by one of lhese lynch mobs. Bul
olhers lake lhe place ol lhose who are killed. ' Ralph Grey's
niece. Eula Grey, was one who became a leader shorlly
aller her uncle's dealh. The capilalisls may lhink lhey are
killing a movemenl by killing ils leaders, bul lhal's where
lhey're mislaken. Kill lhe leaders. and you will have more
leaders.

Whal made lhe bosses even more lurious was lhe lacl
lhal lhe while sharecroppers were waking up, loo. and were

11 »

‘beginning *l'o join fhe Share Croppers Union. and work wifh

‘the Negro workers. sfanding up for fheir righfs. defending
fhem from arresf. and making friends wifh fhem.

The whife share croppers are iusf as badly off as fhe
Negroes. buf fhe bosses have been felling fhem for years
fhaf fhey are superior fo fhe Negroes and shouldn'f have
anyfhing fo do with fhem. You see. fhe bosses find if
easier ’ro rule fhe workers if fhey divide fhem info groups.
If all fhe workers, Negro and whife. Cafholic and Profesfanf
and Jew. were unifed. fhe bosses know if would be very
fough for fhem.

And when fhe bosses see groups of fhese workers geffing
fogefher. do fhey boill They became even more defer-
mined fo break fhe Share Croppers Union.

You can see fhaf fhe sharecroppers have fo be very
careful and work so fhaf fhey will nof gef caughf. Meef-
ings musf be held secrefly and leaflefs announcing fhe mee’r-
ings or felling news disfribufed in fhe dead of nighf. and
in all sor’rs of ways.

Leslie and his fellow Pioneers help a greaf deal in fhis
work. Somefimes a’r fwo or ‘three o'clock in fhe morning
you can see small dark figures slipping quiefly from hol-
low free fo back shed and from ‘there fo some other place.
leaving a bundle of leaflefs in each place. The croppers
will find fhem fhere fhe nexf morning.

When fhe croppers have a union meefing if is Leslie and

 

his fellow Pioneers who are {he guards and wafch fhe roads
and pafhs and warn fhe croppers if fhey hear horses' hoofs
or fhe mo‘l'or of a car or any ofher such sign fhaf 'l'he sheriff
or fhe Ku Klux have found ouf abouf fhe meefing and are
on fheir way fo break if up or shoof if up.

In New Mexico ’rhere was a big sfrike of miners recenfly.
During fhaf sfrike all fhe children in fhe fown had a school

Children Who Are Workers
JIMMY

Alfhough he is only nine. Jimmy is already a worker. His
fafher doesn"r wam‘ him fo be. and when he ﬁrsf sfarfed.
his mofher used ’ro cry every nighf when he came home and
handed her his forfy or fiffy cenfs. or somefimes as much
as a dollar. Jimmy didn'f know why she cried. He was
a man. wasn"r he. and she was a woman. and he had ‘lo
help fake care of her and his baby sisfers. Everybody knows
fhaf "kids" musf have milk and all kinds of fhings. and
Jimmy himself has fo have shoes fo go fo school in.

Of course his dad feels bad because he can'f make
enough money ’ro keep fhe whole family. buf. gee. if's nof

Jimmy is a Pioneer now. He knows fhaf some day soon

lhis will be a counlry run by lhe workers, and lhen his dad
will be able lo work and Jimmy will be able lo go lhrough
school and learn lo be an avialor.

HARRY and SLIM

TO THE   READER:

The stories in this booklet are all true. except the one

called "A Strike in School" which is a combination of sev-

eral incidents and strikes that have taken place in American
schools.

From these stories you will get some idea of what
Pioners are and what they do.

Many people say "Oh. kidsl What can kids do?" Well.
these stories show that "kids" can do a lot.

Others say "Oh. children shouldn't bother about serious
thingsl Children should just play and be happy."

We think you should play and be happy, too; but we think
most of you want to do and can do something more than
that.

We think most of you have brains and want to use them.
We think you know how to think for yourselves. too. in spite
of the tact that in the schools and newspapers and movies

_ they try to make you think the way they want you to.

We think you should know about serious things ahd talk
about them. And we know you have enough sense to un-
derstand them and enough spunk to do something about
them.

In the latter part of the book you will ﬁnd questions and
answers which will explain some of the things which are not
explained in the stories. It there are any questions you have
which are not answered here. write to me in care ot the
NEW PIONEER. Box 28. Station D, New York City. and
I'll be glad to answer you personally.

Pioneers in 1'he Sovief Union

The Sovie'|- Union is a counfry run by {he workers. In
l9|7 fhey had a workers’ revolu’rion and 1'hrew oul ’rheir
bosses and fheir Tsar. and se’r up ’rheir own governmenf.
They provided schools so fhaf all people could learn ‘to read
and write (under lhe Tsar only a few nobles were li+era+e):
’rhey builf new faclories +0 make fraclors +0 culﬁvafe +he
land; fhey furned Russia from a dark, backward counfry lo
a counlry where more progress is being made fhan in any
ofher coun'lry.

The Pioneers are helping ‘lo build up fhis mighfyvnew
coum‘ry. They visi'l' {he facfories and ﬁelds and see how
fhings are done. They are inferesied in everylhing. because
i’r_is all fheirsl H is lhe Pioneers along wi’rh fhe o’rher work-
ers' children who run \‘he schools in fhe Sovief Union. If
1-hey don"r like a Teacher, ’rhey fell ’rhe workers of ‘lhe fown
abou’r if. They mus’: give ’rheir reasons for wan’ring anofher
feacher. The workers in ’rheir Soviei (village meefing) lake
ii up and if fhey agree wi’rh ’rhe children a new feacher is
appoin’red. The children also give ’rhe ’reachers suggesﬁons

 

abou{ {he running o{ {he school. and {he me{hods o{ {each-
ing. For example. if a {eacher {ries {o {each {he children
abou{ elec{rici{y by having {hem ius{ read books abou{ i{.
{he children {ell {heir {eacher {hey would like {o make {heir
own ba{{eries or go {o a place where {hey are made. in
order {o see {or {hemselves ius{ wha{ makes i{ work. Then
{hey unders{and be{{er when {hey read abou{ i{ in books.

In {he agricul{ural par{s of {he Sovie{ Union {here are
s{il| a few rich farmers who do no{ wan{ {o work wi{h {he
o{her {armers bu{ who wan{ {o make pro{i{s {or {hemselves.
They smuggle grain and sell i{ on {he sly. and some{imes
{hey s{eal from {he collec{ive farms. The Pioneers keep a
look ou{ {or {hese rich farmers and repor{ {hem. They also
{ake {urns guarding {he grain a{ nigh{s so {ha{ {he rich
farmers can'{ come and s{eal i{ when {he workers are no{
{here.

There are many Children's Thea{res all over {he Sovie{

Union. and {he Pioneers are very ac{ive in wri{ing plays.
ac{ing in {hem. and giving sugges{ions and cri{icism.

Then {here is {he Children's Publishing House. which pub-
lishes books {or {he children only. The Pioneers advise {he
Publishing House abou{ {he kind of books {he children wan{.
The boys and girls even wri{e books. Recen{ly several boy
and girl au{hors a{{ended {he big Sovie{ Wri{ers' Congress.

Bu{ a Sovie{ Pioneer's li{e is no{ all work. There are
plen{y of spor{s mee{s and camps and orches{ras. and o{her
{hings {or boys and girls {o do. Recen{ly {here was held in
Moscow an |n{erna{iona| Model Airplane Mee{. in which
Pioneers from clubs in every sec{ion of {he Sovie{ Union
{ook par{.

Then {here are clubs {or young mechanics and engineers

_ and cra{{smen of various kinds.

Recen{|y Volodya Suslov. a Pioneer of Kharkov. in {he

Sovief Union. designed an elecfric driven aufomobile. He
needed an elecfric mofor fo experimenf wifh. so he wrofe
fo fhe Commissar of Heavy lndusfry. and fhe Commissar
had a mofor senf fo him from fhe Kharkov Tracfor Planf.
Volodya has a special room af fhe school. where he and his
fellow sfudenfs are now finishing fhe invenfion.

Pioneers of fhe Sovief Union have every chance fo be
whaf fhey wanf fo be. and ‘lo do fhe sorf of work fhey like.

How differenf from a counfry where fhe bosses own fhe
facfories. fhe land. fhe schools. and even fhe workers!

Do you wanf fo know more abouf fhe

PIONEERS? Here are some quesfions

you may be asking. fogefher wifh fheir
answers.

Who Are fhe Pioneers?

The Pioneers are workers’ and farmers’ children who work
and play and fighf fogefher for fhe righfs of workers and
farmers and ‘their children. There are I2.000 Pioneers in fhe
Unifed Sfafes.

Whaf Does "Pioneer" Mean?

You have all read in your hisfory books abouf fhe early
Pioneers of fhis counfry. You know how fhey fraveled info
new and unexplored lands and seffled new places. You re-
member Daniel Boone. fhe greafesf of fhe American
Pioneers. You remember fhe brave people who wen’: wesf
in fheir covered wagons. and seffled new land—only fo
have if faken from fhem.

A Pioneer is one who does somefhing new. who goes
where ofhers are afraid fo go. who explores fearlessly. who
fighfs bravely againsf hardships fhaf make more fimid

20

people shrink. A Pioneer is courageous and ambiﬁous and
energeﬁc and en'lhusias’ric. He is slrong because he knows
he is right

Thai" is whaf Pioneer mean+ long ago. and ’rha1‘ is whal
Pioneer means now. Only ‘I-he YOUNG PIONEERS OF
AMERICA are no'l' exploring foresfs and wilderness. They
have all been discovered. and along wi+h fhe olher par’rs of
lhe counlry. -they are all owned now by ‘lhe bosses and used
for fheir beneﬁf.

The YOUNG PIONEERS explore fhe sys’rem of socie’ry
and governmem‘ under which we live. They see how people
live, and undersfand more and more how {he people who
own fhe coun’rry chea’r ’rhe people who do all fhe work.
Then fhey spread {his ’rru1'h lo o’rher people. The Pioneers
‘loday ﬁghf on ’rhe side of rhe workers in ’rhe greaf srruggle
fhaf is always going on between ’rhe workers and ’rhe bosses.

The Pioneers ﬁghf 1'0 esfablish a new sysfem, a new kind
of governmenf. in which America will really belong ‘lo ’rhe
workers who have made ii’. The Pioneers are going ’ro help
fake +he land ‘lhaf fhe old Pioneers found and give i’r back
lo i’rs righlful owners. fhe workers.

The Pioneers are making his’rory, iusl as lhe old Pioneers"

did. The old Pioneers found new land, buf fhe Pioneers of
+oday are going ‘lo make a new world. The names and
deeds of ’rhe Pioneers will go down in {he hisfory of ’rhe
world in ‘Flaming leHers. For 'lhey will help carry lhrough
+he grea’res+ his’rorical ac’: ’rhe world has ever known—’rhe
Revolufion of lhe workers of fhe world agains’r fhe bosses of
fhe world.

Wha+ Do ’rhe Pioneers Fighf For?

They ﬁghf for free lunches. clofhing. books. and carfare
21 A

in fhe schools. They ﬁghf wifh ’rheir parenfs in sfrikes for
living wages. deceni working condiﬁons. and ’rhe righf fo
belong ’ro unions. They ﬁghf wH'h +he unemployed workers
for decenf relief. They ﬁghf for unemploymenf insurance
for all workers. They ﬁghi for a governmen-f of. by and
for ’the workers.

22

Whaf Do They Fighf Againsf?

They fighf againsf all fhings which are no good for fhe
workers. They fighf againsf war and fascism. because fhese
bring only deafh and sfarvafion fo fhe workers. They fighf
againsf fhe lynching and persecufion of Negroes. because
fhey know fhaf fhe bosses fry fo make fhe whifes and
Negroes hafe each ofher so fhe bosses can rob bofh. They
fighf againsf fhe persecufion of Jews and ofher nafionali-
fies which are oppressed. They fighf againsf child labor.
They fighf againsf fhe capifalisf sysfem of governmenf.

Whaf ls fhe Capifalisf Sysfem?

Every period in hisfory has had some kind of economic
sysfem. When we speak of economic sysfem. we mean -lhe
relafions of men fo each ofher in so far as wealfh is con.-
cerned. In fhe Middle Ages, we had {he feudal sysfem. in
which fhe King and his lords owned all fhe wealfh and fhe
serfs did fhe work.

Now we are living under fhe capifalisf sysfem. Capifal
means weal’rh—nof only money. buf land. and facfories, and
banks, and ofher properfy. The people who own wealfh
are fhe capifalisfs. Morgan and Rockefeller and Ford and
Mellon are fhe chief capifalisfs in fhis counfry. Anofher
name for fhe capifalisfs is fhe bourgeoisie.

The o+her main class in {his counfry is fhe working class.
The working class has no wealfh. A worker can only gef
enough fo eaf and wear and a house fo live in by working
for a capifalisf. The capifalisf can give him as much wages
as he wanfs. and fhe worker has fo accepf fhis, because
fhere are so many workers fhaf fhe capifalisf can always
gef some fo work for low wages rafher fhan sfarve.

23

When a worker wan+s Io raise his wages or make his
working condiﬁons beﬂer, he has Io gel ‘Ioge'|'her wilh his
fellow workers and slrike. If ’rhe s’rrike is solid and de’rer-
mined. fhe workers can win. SI'rikes—no'|' one. bu+ many
of ’rhem—won -|'he eighf-hour-day for ’rhe workers. Sfrikes
also won ‘Iree educalion for workers' children.

Belween Ihe capilalisf class and {he working class fhere

Why Do Pioneers Fighf Agains’r War?

The big bosses make wars. They make wars in order ’ro
caplure more land so ’rhey will have more place lo sell +heir
goods. and so make more proﬁls. Bosses are in’reres’red only

in how much proﬁf Ihey can make. lnsfead of looking for
24

new markels. lhey could raise ‘the wages and cu+ ’rhe hours
of lhe workers so ’rhe workers could buy fhe goods. Bul
bosses don'+ do +ha+. They keep fhe workers working as
long as ever (unless +he workers s’rrike and force fhe bosses
’ro reduce +he hours) and make exlra goods and ’rry ‘lo sell
if in foreign markels. The bosses of all counfries ﬁghl abou+
which shall have cerlain markels. This is war.

Workers gel killed in wars. They have +heir legs and arms
and faces blown oFF. They are poisoned by gas. Children
lose ‘lheir ‘lafhers and big brofhers. The soldiers who come
back from war cannol ge'|' iobs. Only ‘the bosses beneﬁl
by ’rhe wars.

Wha’r Are fhe Presen’r Organizafions?

Should Workers’ Children Join fhe Boy Scoufs?

There is no quesfion fhaf workers' children can gain very
much from fhe BOY SCOUTS. You can fake hikes. and
learn swimming and games.- and have lofs of fun af fhe
same fime fhaf you're learning inferesfing fhings.

Then why do we say fhaf workers' children should ioin
fhe PIONEERS or fhe NATURE FRIEND SCOUTS or fhe
|.W.O. JUNIORS insfead of fhe BOY SCOUTS? For fhis
reason: you can use all knowledge eifher for fhe working
class and againsf fhe boss class, or for fhe boss class and
againsf fhe working clas. And fhe Boy Scoufs feach you
fo use your knowledge for fhe boss class. They ’reach you
’ro be "pa'l'riofic."

And whaf does fhe "pa’rriofism" of lhe Boy Scoufs and {he
bosses mean? If means fhaf when fhe bosses of fhis coun-
fry wanf markefs for fheir goods and decide fo go fo war
fo gef fhe markefs from ofher counfries, YOU should puf
on a uniform and go fo war for fhese bosses and fheir
profifs. If means fhaf YOU mighf gef killed, or have an
arm or leg or a piece of your face shof off. fhaf YOU will
kill and injure workers of ofher counfries who have been
fricked info going fo war for THEIR bosses. The rich
people frain fhe Boy Scoufs so fhey can always counf on
fhem in ‘lime of war. Do you know fhaf fhe Boy Scoufs
helped fhe lasf war a greaf deal? They sold Liberfy Bonds
and War Savings Sfamps amounfing fo $200.000.000.
Thaf's a lof of money. Think how many families if would
keep for a yearl And if is very sad fo fhink fhaf each Lib-
erfy bond sold meanf fhaf fhe war wenf on fhaf much

26

longer. and fhaf more people were killed and injured.

The "pafriofism" of fhe Boy Scoufs and fhe bosses means
defending fhe governmenf and fhe properfy of rich and
corrupf millionaires and fheir polificians. and prevenfing fhe
workers from geffing a living from fheir labor by fighfing
againsf sfrikers and fhe unemployed who demonsfrafe for
relief. The Boy Scoufs and fhe bosses call being willing fo
give your life or healfh or killing workers of ofher counfries
or fighfing workers of your own counfry "Love of Counfry."

Don'f fhe Pioneers love fheir counfry? Yes. fhey do.
They love fheir counfry and fhe working people of fheir
counfry and fhey ‘wanf fheir counfry fo be shared by all
workers. They wanf all fhe good fhings of fheir counfry fo
be shared by all fhe workers who make fhis counfry rich
and beaufiful. They don'f wanf all fhis good and beaufiful
counfry fo be owned by a few rich parasifes like Morgan
and Rockefeller.

Which do you fhink really loves his counfry. fhe one who

wishes fo save if for fhe rich bosses or ‘the one who wanfs
if fo be shared by all fhe people?

We fhink fhaf fhe workers who have builf up fhe coun-
fry. who plow ifs lands and run ifs facfories, love if more
fhan fhe bosses. who only wanf if for whaf fhey can gef
ouf of if.

We fhink fhaf you musf eifher fake fhe side of fhe work-
ers or fake fhe side of fhe bosses. The BOY SCOUTS are
faughf fo fake fhe side of fhe Bosses. while fhe PIONEERS
fake fhe side of fhe workers. Thaf's why we say fhaf work-
ers' children should join fhe Pioneers.

STORY ABOUT PIONEERS

Tony lives near Piffsburgh. His fafher is a coal miner.
Nof long ago fhere was a big sfrike in Tony's fown. The
miners wenf on sfrike because fheir wages were so low
fhey couldn"r give fheir children enough fo eaf. lef alone
clofhes fo wear. Besides. ‘The company had a weighman
who weighed each car of coal as if came up. and fhis weigh-
man cheafed ‘the miners. The miners wanfed fheir own
weighman fo check up. bu’: fhe bosses refused fo give fhem
fhis. Tony and his sisfer Myrfle had ioined fhe Pioneers
fhe year before. and fheir froop was helping fhe sfrikers by
pickefing wifh fhem and collecfing money for food.

Now of fhe six mines around fhere. only one was nof
ouf on sfrike. Thaf was Number 4.

Why didn"r fhese men sfrike? Well. fhey were afraid.
They were afraid because if fhey wenf on sfrike fhey
wouldn'f even have fhe few dollars a week fhey had now.
They did nof undersfand -fhaf fhe only way fhey could gef
enough fo live on was by fighfing for if. They did nof un-
dersfand fhaf by working fhey were helping fhe bosses
break fhe sfrike and keep all wages low. They did nof
undersfand fhaf by nof sfriking fhey were helping make
fheir own condifions worse.

Buf fhe Pioneers knew fhis. They had read abouf if in
fhe NEW PIONEER, and fheir leader had fold fhem how
workers musf fighf nof only -lo raise fheir wages buf even fo
keep fhe miserable wages fhey are geffing. So fhe Pioneers
af fheir meefing decided fo fake up fhis quesfion of Num-
ber 4 mine.

Wha{ Else Do Pioneers Do Besides Figh{ {or {he

o{her {hings {ha{ all boys and girls like {o do.

We {hink a boy or girl who doesn'{ like {o do any*o{
{hese {hings is no{ normal. And we {hink all workers‘ chil-

Who Should Join ’rhe Pioneers?

Every worker's and poor farmer's child should join 'lhe
Pioneers and help in ‘lhe ﬁghl for a decenl life and for all
{he good lhings in life for all workers. Workers' children
wan’r ’ro play and lo have enough lo eaf and wear. and
a decenf place +0 live. They demand lhe righf ’ro have all
‘lhe good lhings of life. They know ‘lhal ’rheir falhers and
molhers have grown lhe food and builf ‘lhe houses and
made ‘the clolhes. Yel lhe children of ‘lhe workers do nol'
have even enough ’ro eal or wear or a decen’r place lo sleep.
All lhe Things made by ’rhe workers are sold by ’rhe bosses
for lheir own proﬁl. The young Pioneers of America de-
mand ’rha’r lhe workers have a fair share of {he fhings +heir
falhers and molhers have made. And when we are slrong
enough we will help our paren’rs and ofher brofhers and
sislers kick ouf ’rhe bosses. and ’rhen _all lhe workers will share

A Slrike in School

All fhe fellows and girls in Public School 68 were excited
