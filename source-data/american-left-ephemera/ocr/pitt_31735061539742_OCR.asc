a brief introduction
to the human

rights party.

  

Why “RP?

The Human Rights Party was formed in 1971 by
people of varied backgrounds. We came from the
anti-war and student movements, and trom the
struggles against :-racism and sexism. Some of us
had spent years trying to reform the Democratic
Party.

ONE OVER-RIDING concern brought us together:
the need to form a radical third party. This party
would offer an alternative to the millions of
Americans who are tired of voting for the lesser of
two evils.

in the Spring of 1972 we elected two radicals to
the Ann Arbor city council. We have gradually
expanded since then. This past yea'r we won two
council seats in Ypsilanti and one in Ann Arbor.
But HRP does more than participate in elections.
Whether in boycotts, strike picketlines, demonstra—

tions, or petition drives we have been active in many
struggles for radical change. '

 

One over-riding con-
cern brought us together:
the need to form a radical
third party.

 '

.-"2 Still, there are those who. share many‘ of HFlP’s
beliefs but continue to support the Democratic
Party. Many of us have walked that road and know
too well that it can only frustrate anyone seeking
real change. ~

 

 

 

THIS TIME

“"“~" C3{0('DCD"<

LIKE REPUBLICANS, Democrats never question
our present economic system. This system has lead
us to costly foreign wars. It gives us poverty in the
world's richest nation. It actively encourages racial,
sexual, and age discrimination.

Only a party that rejects this system can, without
compromise, stand for peace and social justice.

democratic

socialism
   

The Human Rights Party describes itself: as a
democratic» socialist party. We believe the present
economic system is a critical barrier to progressive
social change. - '

WE ARE SOCIALISTS because we are tired of a
system which makes millions of people struggle to
make ends meet. We are tired of a system that
throws away precious lives and billions in taxes on
endless wars.’ We are tired ofa system that uses sex
and race to divide us. We are tired of a system that
makes work a stiffling routine that creates corporate
profits at the expense of human fulfillment ‘ and
dignity.

Democratic Socialism means a society where the
nation’s wealth is owned by all the people. it means
an end to racial and sexual discrimination. it means
an end to an aggressive foreign policy. it means a
society where human beings have control of their
lives at home and at work, and where decisions are
arrived at democratically by all the _people.
