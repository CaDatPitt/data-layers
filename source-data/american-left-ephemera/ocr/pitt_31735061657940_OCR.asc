TAKE THE ROAD OF
HITLER GERMANY? 3.,

Here's How Fascism" Came to Power in German
  Here's How Fascism ls Developing in the United

Germany

Nazi storm-troopers beat up anti-Nazis, attached anti-
Nazi meetings, forcibly expelled militant workers from
plants. The German people and the German workers
were afraid to defend those who were attacked for fear
of themselves being attacked.

United States ,-

Four Chrysler workers were beaten up‘by an organized
gang of hoodlums. Two workers who attempted to
interfere were also beaten. Hundreds of Chrysler work-
ers stood by, afraid to act against the small gang of
hoodlums. Militant workers in other plants are already
being threatened with the Chrysler treatment.

sﬁztmany

The German police worked hand in glove with the
Nazis. If any of their victims dared complain to the
police, the‘ police protected the Nazis and persecuted
the victims.

United States

The FBI planned and organized the attack at Chrysler.
Deputy sheriffs conveniently failed to arrive until it
was all over. i ’

Men and women circulating the Stockholm peace peti«
tion are meeting with police persecution. A few petition
circulators have been physically attacked—-—and in each

case, the police protected the attacker and persecuted
the victim.

®etmanp

The Nazi movement was financed by Big Business.
The big corporations wanted war because war means
profits. They also wanted to destroy the unions.

United States

Wall Street also Wants war because war means profits.
Chrysler’ Worked with the FBI to select and train the
Chrysler- hoodlums. Frank Zaffina, the self-confessed
ring-leader, is still employed by the Santa Fe Railroad
and still has the run of the Chrysler plant.

- Right-wing union leaders and liberals refused to work

together with the Communists to defeat fascism and
save the German trade unions. Instead, they retreated
before the Nazis. Result: the great German trade unions
were destroyed. Hitler set up his "Labor Front” unions
which made the German workers tools of the Hitler
war machine.

United States y

Walter Reuther of the United Auto Workers orders
UAW members to .refrain from violence———but prom~
ises that the job of dumping the “reds" can and will
be done quietly and legally by the union. Consolidated

in

Steel calls in union leaders to bawl them out for not
moving fast to get rid of the “Communists.” The
National Maritime Union and some other maritime
unions are helping the FBI and the shipowners drive
progressive workers off the waterfront.

The workers in these unions are already paying for
these policies. G-M workers are tied to a 5-year, no
wage increase contract. The NMU gave up the hiring
hall. Phony pension deals are replacing the fight for
wage increases.

The labor movement in the United States faces the
danger of being converted into a Hitler “Labor Front”
for U. S. fascism.

Hitler’s program for Germany consisted of one point:
WAR. He taught the German people to hate and de-
spise all other peoples. The people swallowedthe Big
lie that Co-mmunism——not fascism——was the menace.
Any outrage was permittedL—as long as the victim
could be labeled a Jew or a Communist. The advocacy
of peace became a "Jewish-Bolshevile plot.” The "Anti-
Communist Axis” was the cover for organizing World
War II.

United States *

The only perspective held out to the people of the
United States is WAR. Under the slogan of “fight-
ing Communism" President Truman is committing
our young men to fight all over the world, Hatred
and contempt for other peoples is being cultivated in
the United States. '

Within our country, the Jews, the Mexicans, the Ne-
groes—~—and the Communists—are the scapegoats.

At Chrysler, Negro workers are being threatened daily.
Negro families moving into new homes are attacktd
and their homes are vandalized. 23 Negroes face legal
lynching——and only a tremendous mass campaign has
so far saved the lives of Willie McGee in Mississippi
and the Martinsville Seven in Virginia.

The advocacy of peace is being termed , Communist

Plot. Americans who believe that American lives are-

being needlessly sacriﬁced in Korea are called un-
patriotic. Americans who do not Want our country
to be guilty of starting atom-bomb warfare are called
agents of Stalin.

U nde_r _Hitler, laws were passed wiping out completely
the civil and political liberties of the German people.
Hitler created the infamous Gestapo, which set has-
band to spy on wife, and child to spy on.parents.

United States

Many basic liberties have already been destroyed. The
Taft-Hartley Act enslaves the unions. The Smith Act
is being used to destroy freedom of thought and speech.
The House of Representatives has passed the Hobbs
Bill, which provides for imprisonment without trial.
The FBI has adopted the methods of the Gestapo,
and is also calling upon neighbor to spy on neighbor.
and wife to spy on husband.

The Mundt-Ferguson Bill may come up in the Senate
at any time. The L. A. City Council and County
Board of Supervisors have set the wheels in motion
for local little Mundt Bills.

As this leaflet goes to press. the United States Govern-
ment has taken another step in imitation of Hitler. with

the court decision to revoke Harry Bridges‘ bail. because
of his opposition to the war in Korea.

The 11 Communist leaders. whose case is now on appeal.
are also threatened with cancellation of bail and imme-
diate imprisonment.

RIGHTS AS THE CITIZEN'S PROTECTION AGAINST
ARBITRARY ARREST AND UNJUST IMPRISONMENT.

This is the.road to fascism. Germany traveled this
road. It led to the enslavement and degradation of the
German people. It led to World War II. It led to the
crushing defeat of Germany. '

The United States has started on this road. Wall Street
has sent U. S. troops into Korea to maintain by force
the Syngham Rhee government which was repudiated
by the Korean people in the last elections. Police state
measures are being introduced at home to crush all’
opposition to War.

It is 1ate———but not too late. In this zero hour we warn
the timid souls and the fence-sitters that they can only
save themselves from disaster by bringing some reserves
into this common ﬁght.
