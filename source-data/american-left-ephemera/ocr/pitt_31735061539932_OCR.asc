far above that of any other country, is the very founda-
tion of its great military successes. M

Another basic source of the Soviet people’s remark-
able ﬁghting power is the complete mobilization of
their country’s economic resources. This, also, is quite
without a rival anywhere. Factories, farms, mines, rail-
roads, banks—the entire industrial and economic re-
sources"——all work together, combined with a complete
organization of manpower, as one great machine to
tum\ out war munitions and civilian necessities. No
less than the Soviet people’s national unity and military
prowess, their great industrial achievements have sur-
prised the world, including Hitler, during this war.
The transference of war factories far into the interior
in the face of the invaders, the rebuilding of railroads
destroyed by the enemy, the sheer heroism of the work-
ers in the war plants, the achievement of record-br_eak-
ing production despite the loss of many resources and
vital production areas—are only a few items of the “mir-
acle” of Soviet wartime production.

In the United States and Great Britain, although
grace to their big industrial plant they have achieved
unparalleled industrial output, they nevertheless have
nothing to compare with the intensity of war produc-

 

tion in the U.S.S.R., with that country’s utilization of

the very last bit of its resources. After his recent trip to
the U.S.S.R., our great production expert, Donald Nel-
son, stated that he had never realized what all-out war
meant until he visited the Soviet Union. The impro-
vised methods of the Anglo-American governments, de-
signed to centralize and speed up production, have only
very partially overcome the inherent capitalist competi-
tive-monopoly chaos, with all its great loss of efficiency,

in contrast with the great socialist industrial machine“

in the U.S.S.R. n both Anglo-Saxon countries, especially
the United States, maximum production is seriously
10

hindered by the lack of government controls, by want
of national planning, by defeatist sabotage of economic
stabilization, by capitalist proﬁteering at the expense of
the people, by business-as—usual methods, by monopoly
concerns grabbing up war contracts and squeezing
smaller companies out of business, by attempts to under-
mine the trade unions, by the waste and hoarding of
manpower, by resistance to incentive wage systems—all
of which crippling influences are totally unknown in
the U.S.S.R. ‘

In Germany and _]'apan it is made to appear as though

the industries and resources' have been pretty well cen- 1

tralized. But, actually, Very much of the chaos and lost
motion inseparable from capitalism still exist in both
these countries. Moreover, the slave labor in the Axis
and-Axis-controlled lands has a relatively low produc-
tivity, which is one of the basic factors that is causing
Hitler to lose the war. Productivity, in the warring in-
dustrial countries, is least intense in those controlled
by the fascists, next highest in the capitalist democracies,
and highest of all in the Soviet Union.

That Soviet production is qualitatively far superior

to that of the Nazis is glaringly demonstrated by the‘

fact that although Germany, with its conquered coun-
tries, outweighs the U.S.S.R. in industrial plant capa-

city by about two to one (which is offset to only a frac- K

tional extent by American lend-lease shipments), never-
theless, on the ﬁeld of battle, where production counts
as heavily as soldiers, the Red Army is driving back the
Nazis and cutting their army to pieces.

The superior national unity of the Soviet people and
the great concentration of their industrial mechanism
are quite matched by their resulting tremendous mili-
tary striking power and achievements. Today there are
probably few experts who would deny that the U.S.S.R.
has made a more resolute and effective military ﬁght

ll. ‘

than any country on either side of the_ war. And it has

done this despite the fact that it has less men and ma-
terials than its allies, Great Britain and the United

. States, and it is also outweighed in these respects by its

enemies, Germany and its satellite powers.
The U.S.S.R. goes all-out in the military sense as no
other country has done. Its great winter offensives in

~ 1941 and 1942, and its present ‘summer and fall offen-

sive, testify eloquently to this. That the Anglo—Saxon

 

powers are proceeding more leisurely with the war is-
shown by the fact that they have not yet launched the L

second front, although they undoubtedly enjoy a huge
superiority of men, planes and guns over anything that
Hitler could bring to bear against them in western
Europe. The hindrance to the military pace of the
United States in its struggle against Hitler‘, for example,

is understood when one notes the sabotaging efforts of '

defeatist attempts to switch the war away from Germany
and against Japan, the continuance, for political reas-
ons, of antiquated harmful seniority systems in the
Army and Navy, demagogic agitation on the home front
against drafting fathers, etc.—none of which would be
tolerated in the ﬁghting U.S.S.R.

As for the Nazi army, it built up a frightening repu-

tation of invincibility by smashing badly armed, taught

and led armies. But its triumphant march was halted
when it collided with the Red Army, despite the Soviet
Union’s lesser manpower and productive capacity. The

' physically and intellectually enslaved soldiers of the

Nazi Wehrmacht have suffered one defeat after another
at the hands of the free, brave and intelligent soldiers
of the Soviet Union. The defense of Sevastopol, Lenin-
grad, Moscow and Stalingrad, and the three great Rus-
sian offensives rppresent all-out ﬁghting‘ on a more in-
tense scale than anything ever achieved by the German
army, or any other army.

\

Two great lessons from the mighty war effort of the
U.S.S.R. the Anxlo-Saxon powers would do well to
learn.

The ﬁrst of these is that, also under the capitalist
system, there isiroom for fundamental improvement in
their war effort—-in the strengthening of national unity,
in the better centralization of production, in the more
determined prosecution of military campaigns.

The second lessonis that when the Soviet military

.leaders urge the 'Anglo—American forces to launch the

second front they are not proposing something which
they, were the task up to them, would not themselves
go through with. Any of the Soviet Union’s three great
offensives represented a greater effort for that country
than the opening of the second front would for Great
Britain and the United States.

III, SOVIETIDEMOCRACY AS A WAR FACTOR

IN THIS PEOPLES WAR of national liberation the
best ﬁghters, whether on the home front or the battle
front, are those who have the deepest, most complete
democracy in their own countries, or who are deﬁnitely
ﬁghting for such‘ democratic principles. Of course, as
we have seen in the case of Nazi Germany, soldiers can
be poisoned with fascist imperialist propaganda and

I "made to ﬁght with courage, at least for a time. We have

also learned in this war that democratic soldiers and

S peoples nevertheless have the most resolute ﬁghting

s 1r1t.
pThe fascist soldiers ﬁght well on the offensive, when
they are being fed with easy victories, but, once forced
onto the defensive, they will never stand such pressure
as the Spanish Loyalists, the Chinese, tff Russians, and
the British have done so unﬂinchingly n this war, and
as American soldiers will do if they have to. The recent
‘ 13

ft .

 

collapse of Italy, while not to be taken too immediately
as a forecast of the. fate of the much more powerful
Germany‘, is nevertheless indicative of the rottenness

common to every fascist state and its basic weakness.

In this matter of ﬁghting morale, bred of democracy.
the U.S.S.R. has a very special and powerful advantage.
This is because it is, with its socialist system, the most
profoundly democratic of all states. Its-democracy is not
one with the “freedom of private capitalist enterprise,"
as its objective; it is a real peop1e’s democracy.'The
great toiling masses of workers and farmers have in the
U.S.S.R. acquired a greater stake in their country than
the corresponding working masses have in any other

land. They own the industries and the land; they have.

abolished human exploitation; they possess a govern-
ment which completely reﬂects their interests; they have
the unequaled Stalin Constitution; they are safeguarded
by a body of social laws that have no parallel anywhere
else; in short, they are the masters of their social fate.
And they would not allow themselves to be robbed of
these hard-won liberties, short of the ﬁercest struggle
ever made by man in all his history. The Russians ﬁght
doubly Well; to defend their beloved homeland and to
protect their high level of socialist liberty. '

One of the greatest morale—building effects of the So—
viet regime is the profound realization among the peo-
ple that their democ-ratic system will remain true to it-
self in wartime. The Soviet masses know that there are
no proﬁteers on the home front to exploit their hard
work and sacriﬁces; the trade unionist has no fear what-

ever that sinister forces will take advantage of wartime _

disciplines to undermine his union and working condi-
tions, as is done in capitalist countries. The Soviet sol-
dier, unlike the British and American, has not the
slightest doubt but that as soon as the war is ended he
can walk right into a steady job in industry or agricul-

ture; the peasants who have had their farms devastated

in carrying out the Red Army’s scorched earth policy.

understand fully that the Government will rebuild and
restore them; the people as a whole take it perfectly for
granted that their Government, true to its socialist prin-
ciples, will always be found, in the occupied or liberated
countries and in the councils of the United Nations,
working to advance a truly democratic foreign policy.

All this democratic stability makes far more for an
all-out war effort than, for example, the situation in the
United States, where the workers and other win-the-war
elements constantly have to wage an intensive political

J struggle in orderxto balk the defeatists, to push through

an active war policy, and to maintain our 41 national
democracy, or where the Negro people have to ﬁght for
the most elementary rights of citizenship.

The socialist Soviet regime also inevitably produces
popular democratic education as to the meaning and

aims of the war, with consequent strengthening effects‘

upon the masses. With no reactionary classes to repre-
sent or contend with at home, it is perfectly natural for
the Soviet Government to educate its people about the
realities of the war, which it is doing far more clearly
and effectively than any other government. This mass
education enormously stiffens the ﬁghting morale of
Soviet soldiers and civilians. How far behind the capi-

' talist countries inithe United Nations lag in this respect

is especially to be noted in the United States. Here the
press, largely in the hands _of reactionary and often out-
right defeatist elements, pours a steady stream of poison-
ous confusion into the minds of our workers, farmers
and soldiers. In such a situation, faced by reactionary
pressure, the ‘Government has not undertaken fully
to educate the‘ soldiers or workers about the basic mean-
ing of the war. This failure not only greatly depresses
our national morale on all fronts, but also leaves both
15 ‘

our army and our civilians dangerously exposedto reac-
tionary demagogues, who are now so strong that they
are threatening to take over the Government in the

.1944 elections. - . —
Capitalist writers, politicians and military leaders-

scoff at any suggestion that democracy in the Soviet
Union is a powerful factor in the great ﬁght thatvthe
Red Army is now making against Hit1er’s hordes. Such
people, withirare exceptions, are quite sure there is no
democracy whatever in the U.S.S.R., even as they were

very positive that the Soviet people would not ﬁght to-

defend their country’ and Government, that Soviet in-
dustry could never stand up under war conditions, and
that the Red Army would be smashed in sixlweeks by
Hitler’s “invincible” legions. The Hearsts, Howards,

.McCormicl<s, Eastmans, Chamberlains, Utleys and simi-
lar professional Soviet—baiters,_ by their twenty-ﬁve years n
of misrepresentation, have almost completely blinded I,
- the American people as to the profoundly democratic A

character of Soviet society.

But our nation is in for an eye-opening experience

in this whole matter. It is on the way to getting an un-
derstanding of the true nature of Soviet democracy. And
it will be pleasantly amazed, even more so than. it is by
the current revelation of the ﬁghting power of the So-
viet people. Already Roosevelt and Wallace have let in
at least a pinpoint of light by their remarks upon Soviet
democracy. The war is shattering the wall of prejudice
so long and carefully built up by the Soviet—baiters, and

the process of getting acquainted with the Soviet people A

will go on apace. And Americans, in the main, will be
both surprised and gratiﬁed when they ﬁnally discover
the truth about Soviet democracy. Especially will the
uniquely democratic "character of Soviet_society become
manifest at the conclusion -of the war, when the Soviet
people,‘ upon the establishment of a sane peace, will be
16 

 

 

able to relax the strong wartime disciplines under which
they have been living for the past decade or more, and
which have done much to veil the profoundly demo-
cratic character of Soviet life. Then the world will be
able to see that the Stalin Constitution is indeed the

most democratic in all the world, and capitalist military
authorities will also come to understand the funda- ‘

mental “role that Soviet socialist democracy played in
building up the present marvelous ﬁghting morale of
the Russian soldiers, workers and farmers.

‘The Communist Party of U.S.S.R,

Especially are the mass of the American people in for
a big and pleasant surprise when, in getting acquainted
with Soviet democracy, they really come to know

‘and understand the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R. »
This great organization is the most effective and most

progressive organization ever built by mankind in its

, entire history. It is this unequaled party, containing in

its ranks millions of the, most advanced and militant
elements of the Soviet people, and with its ramiﬁca-
tions extending directly into every Soviet institution,
that is the very backbone of the whole war effort of the
U.S.S.R. Its members, bravest of the brave, have died
in hundreds of thousands in the forefront of the most

‘desperate battles in the war. The party is ﬁghting this

war with the same whole-hearted spirit as when it was
the heart and soul of all the other great struggles of the
Soviet people in establishing socialism in their country.

The Communist Party of the U.S.S.R., living
and functioning in a socialist nation, presents many

S aspects that are new and strange to people living in

capitalist countries. One of these is that .it is the only

‘party in the U.S.S.R., a situation which exists be-
cause, unlike in capitalist countries, the economic and

17 

 

political interests of all the Soviet people being identi- S
cal, this makes necessary and possible only one political
organization, the Communist Party. Another feature

high degree of discipline and unity. This arises naturally
out of the Soviet people’s solid national unity, and out
of the resolute manner in which they undertake the tre-

‘ mendous tasks they have had to accomplish in the
twenty-six years since they founded their Socialist Re-
public, including their great part in the war.

IV. A REPLY T 0 TWO SOVIET -BAITERS

THE SOVIET-BAITERS are now taking a new tack.
After the United Nations’ unity achieved at the Mos-
cow Conference these disruptive elements had to ﬁnd
new arguments in their efforts to drive wedges between
the U.S.S.R. and the U .S.A. G. E. Sokolsky and Mark
Sullivan of the'Sun and Herald Tribune, respectively,
(Nov. 5) are now telling us that there is a contradiction
between the democraticimport of the decision of the
Moscow Conference regarding Italy and the “undemo—
cratic” character of the U.S.S.R. Mr. Sullivan says the
contradiction is “extraordinary” and suggests that Mr.
H1111 or Mr. Eden proposed the democratic guarantees
for Italy and that the U.S.S.R. assented to them. “Rus-
sia’s acceptance of the guarantees must have been-in the
spirit of making a concession for the sake of coopera-
tion,” he says. He says he is hopeful this indicates that
the U.S.S.R. is ﬁnally turning toward democracy.
This absurd and dangerous line of reasoning is con-
, tradicted by all the facts. Firstly, the foreign policy of
the U.S.S.R. has always been one friendly to democratic
principles and policies throughout the world; as exem-
pliﬁed by its pre-war efforts to line up the democratic
A 18

unfamiliar to most Americans is the Communist Party’s .

powers for a stand against advancing Hitlerism, by its
sympathetic attitude toward the Spanish Loyalist gov-
ernment, by its support of Ethiopia and China, by its
present-day cooperative spirit toward the French Na-
tional Committee and the democratic forces in Ger-
many, Poland, Yugoslavia, and by its stand in the war.
The Moscow Conference’s insistence upon democracy
for Italy, therefore, is fully in line with the long-estab-
lished foreign policy of.’ the U.S.S.R.

Secondly the argumentation of Sullivan and Soko1-
sky also falls ﬂat because the U.S.S.R., far from needing
to be converted to democracy by Mr. Hull, has always
been a democracy, in fact the most advanced one any-
where. The socialist democracy of the Soviet Union
operates uponlan‘ altogether higher plane than that of
any. capitalist country. During the past couple of years
the American people have learned a lot about the
U.S.S.R. that was previously hidden by the clouds of
lies of the Sdviet-baiters. They have found out that
the Soviet people are united solidly behind their Gov-
ernment, that the Red Army is very powerful and
capably led, that Soviet industry is extremely strong.
With the development of friendly relations with the
U.S.S.R. the American people are in for the biggest
surprise of all—a discovery of the high quality of
Soviet democracy—which will contradict all the slanders
they have had dinned into their ears for the past quar-
ter_century, to the effectthat the U.S.S.R. is a totali-
tarian country and that Stalin is a dictator.

Economic and Political Foundations
of Soviet Democracy

The character of Soviet democracy is made clear by

the national Constitution of the U.S.S.R. Article 1 says-

“The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a socialist

state of workers and peasants.” Article 3 states that “all
power belongs to the working people of town and coun-
try.” Article 4 provides for the “socialist ownership; of

. the means and instruments of production. . . the abroga-

tion of private ownership of the means and instruments
of production and the abolition of the exploitation of
man by man.” Article 12 _lays it down that “work is a

- duty and _a matter of honor for every able-bodied citi-

zen, in accordance with the principle: ‘He who does
not work, neither shall he eat.’ ”

On the basis of these general constitutional pro-
visions, in the U.S.S.R. the land, minerals, forests, fac-

. tories, mines, railroads, banks, etc., are all owned by the.
people as a whole; the Government is entirely in the

hands of the workers, farmers and professional classes;

there are no parasitic idlers living from the labor of the ,

toilers; there are no extremes of rich and poor. Con-

trast this fundamental Soviet democracywith the situ-A

ation in the capitalist countries, where the industries

and natural resources are almost entirely privately.

owned, where the governments are controlled by the
owning, ruling capitalist classes, and where large num-
bers of useless loafers live on the fat of the land, ex-
ploiting the poverty-stricken toilers.

I Theﬂighlts of the Soviet People

In harmony with the general economic and political
base of Soviet socialist ‘democracy, the‘ ‘people of the
U.S.S.R. enjoy a whole series of rights, written into the
national constitution and realized in practice, such as
are equaled by no other nation. The most important

of these rights are to be found from Article 118 to 133 I

of the Constitution, and they include:
 . . the right to work”: which is realized in life by the
the complete abolition of unemployment long before
20

I’

‘ present war and positive assurance of a job to everyone.

. . . the right to rest and leisure”: realized by the
constitutional establishment of the seven—hour day and

-thelright to annual vacations with full pay, the devel-

opment of rest homes, etc.

 . . the right to maintenance in old age and also in
case of sickness or loss of capacity to work”; realized
by the most extensive system of social insurance in
the world. -

“ . . the right to education”: realized by the most

tremendous mass educational development in the his-
tory of mankind.
' ‘"Women in the U.S.S.R. are accorded equal rights
with men in all spheres of economic, state, cultural,
social and political life”: realized by the unparalleled
advance of Soviet~women in all phases of activity.

“Equality of rights of citizens of the U.S.S.R., irre-

spective of their nationality or race”: realized by the-

, complete unity)‘ of the scores of nationalities making up

the Soviet nation, by the severe punishment of anti-
Semitism, anti-Negroism, etc., as crimes. '

 . . the right to unite in public organizations—trade
unions, cooperative associations, youth organizations,
sport and defense organizations,” etc., realized in the
fact that, with their maze of vast popular organizations,
the Soviet people are the best organized nation in the

‘ world. ~

 . . the right of asylum”: realized, among other facts,
by the hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees who
ﬂed into the U.S.S.R. in the face of the advancing Hit-
ler armies.

Religious Liberty and ree Speech

“Freedom of religious worship and freedom of anti-

religious propaganda is recognized for all citizens” says ‘

the Stalin Constitution. This is realized in a full exer-

21

  

cise of these rights by the citizenry. That the.Greek
-Orthodox Church is now on better terms with the Soviet
Government is not because the Government‘ under

V pressure of the democracies ("as Mark Sullivan implies)

has changed its policy toward religion, but because the
Church, breaking with its anti—Soviet traditions of the
past, is giving loyal support to the government in win-
ning the war. p
“In conformity with the interests of the working
people, and in order to strengthen the socialist system,
the citizens of the U.S.S.R. are guaranteed by law—- (a)
freedom of speech; (b) freedom of the press; (c) free-
dom of assembly, including the holding of mass meet-
ings; (d) freedom of street processions and demonstra-
tions,” says the Stalin Constitution. These civil liberties
are realized by a “grass roots” democracy in the U.S.S.R.,
such as is altogether unequaled in any other country.
The eminent British labor historians, Sidney and Bea-
trice W'ebb, who are not Communists but moderate
‘Social-Democrats, characterized the workings of Soviet
civil liberties in 'pre-war days' as follows: (Soviet Com-
munism, p. 773): ’
“Nowhere in the world outside of the U.S.S.R. is
there such a volume of pities criticism of every branch
of government, every industrial enterprise, and every
cultural establishment. This perpetual campaign of
exposure, which ﬁnds expression in every public utter-
ance of the leading statesmen, in every issue of the press
and in every trade union and cooperative meeting is not
only oﬂicjally tolerated but also deliberately instigated

, as a powerful incentive to improvement alike in direc-

    

tion and execution.”

For the past dozen years, since the advance of fascism,
the Soviet people have been living under a highly cen-
tralized regime. They have been compelled to adopt a
strong-national discipline in order to enable them to

22

 

drive ‘ahead with the completion of their industries, to
wipe out the organized Trotsky-ZinoViev—Bukharin
gangs of ﬁfth columnists, to build up their armed forces,
and, now, to carry through the war Victoriously. These
necessary strong controls have tended to obscure the
profoundly democratic character of Soviet life. All of
this should be understandable to us now that we have
had to adopt a strong wartime centralization, economic
and political. But once victoryover the fascists is won
and peacein the world assured, a relaxation of the-
Soviet people’s present high state of discipline will be-—
come possible. Then we shall see the blossoming forth

of the most profound and all-inclusive democracy in-

the history of the world.

Sullivan and Sokolsky should not be so disturbed that
the U.S.S.R. might be a holdback force on the growth
of world democracy. They may rest quite content that
in meeting the post—war world tasks of democracy the
U.S.S.R., with its high type of socialist democracy, will
do its full and constructive share, even as it is now
doing in the great task of winning the war. The U.S.S.R.
is the most valuable friend of the American nation, and
it is one of the proudest achievements of the Commu-
nist Party of the U.S.A. that it fought for twenty—ﬁve
years for close and friendly relations between the U.S.A..
and the U.S.S.R. If the two columnists in question
really wish to advance world democracy they would do

far better to turn their literary guns against fascist-~

minded, monopolistic capitalist inﬂuences within the

United States, Great Britain and other capitalist coun#

tries. These are the real enemies of world democracy,
not the ﬁrst Socialist Republic of workers and farmers.

It is they who have busily sabotaged the war effort thus

far and who will also ,be the main stumbling block to

the development of democracy in the post—war period..

The U.S.S.R. is a solid foundation of world freedom.

SOVIET DEMOCRACY
  AND THE WAR

By WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

I. THE SOVIET UNION ACCOMPLISHES THE
“IMPOSSIBLE”

FOR MORE THAN two years the capitalist world
has watched in profound amazement and admiration
the tremendous ﬁght of the Soviet people against the
gigantic Hitler war machine. .The whole development
was totally unexpected in the capitalist countries,
where, almost universally, the Soviet Union was be-

. lieved to be a mere pushover for the Nazi conquerors,

who had just knocked over the armies of Western Eu-
rope like so many tenpins.

In ‘his famous telegram of greeting to the Red
Army, General Douglas MacArthur struck a true
note when he declared that the big 1941 winter offen-
sive of the Red Army, coming after several months of

. unparalleled assault by the huge Nazi Wehrmacht, was

the greatest achievement in the whole course of world
military history. Since MacArthur made this famous
statement, the Red Army’ has accomplished even greater

gmilitary marvels. The crushing defeat of the Germans

at Stalingrad and their expulsion from vast portions
of the occupied sections of the U.S.S.R. during the win-
ter of 1942 clearly topped even the great achievements
of the winter of 1941. And so now also in its big 1943
summer and fall offensive, the Red Army is reaching a
3

 

 
 

still higher level of struggle -than during either of the

two preceding winters. For not only has the Red Army
stopped Hitler’s widely advertised summer offensive,
something it was quite unable to do in the summers of

 

1941 and 1942, but it has also inﬂicted stupendous '

losses upon the German Army, driven it back beyond
the Dnieper, reconquering territory as large as "Ger-
many. And the biggest Red Army advances are ob-
viously now just beginning to loom ahead.

Triumph Over Disaster

In order to appreciate the unequaled quality and mag-
nitude of these military achievements we must remem-

ber that all these months and years the U.S.S.R. has .

been ﬁghting in the face of great odds in men, muni-
tions, and industrial capacity. Nazi Germany, with the
entire industries and manpower of Europe to draw
upon, at the beginning of the war outnumbered the
U.S.S.R. in soldiers by about three to two, and in pro-
ductive capacity by about three to one. And the Nazis’

' decided superiority in human and material’ resources _
over the U.S.S.R. was very far from being counterbal-
anced by the lend-lease aid sent to the U.S.S.R. from .

this country, by the bombings of German cities, and by
the very small military attacks the Anglo-American pow-
ers have as yet made upon Hitler’s armed forces.

Increasing the already great odds against the U.S.S.R. “

still more, the Nazi armies managed to seize a large sec-
tion of that country’s natural resources during the ﬁrst
year of the war. How terrible were the Russians’ hu-
man and industrial losses may be gauged from a few
general ﬁgures. The seven Soviet republics that were
overrun by Hitler’s troops normally contained no less
than 77,000,000 people, or almost 40 per cent of the total
population of the U.S.S.R. In the loss of the Donbas
4 .

 

industrial area the Soviet Union was deprived of 54 per .

cent of its coal production and also an estimated 50
per cent of its steel output, or the equivalent of the steel
producing capacity of Japan and Italy combined. By
the Nazis" seizure of the Ukrainian agricultural regions
the U.S.S.R., according to Helen Fuller (New Repub-
lic, Sept. 13, 1943), lost “almost/10 per cent of all her
cultivated land, 40 per cent of the land which produced
her grain, 85 per cent of her sugar beet territory, 43
per cent of her potato lands, 54 per cent of her vegetable

‘oil capacity, 56 per cent of hogs, 35 per cent of cattle
" and some of her most productive sources of ﬁsh.” Also

dozens of the U.S.S.R.’s biggest cities, as well as the
whole railway system in the occupied areas, were large-
ly destroyed by the retreating Nazi vandals. To all
these losses are to be.added also the devastation caused

\by the Nazis at Moscbw, Leningrad, Stalingrad and
-many other industrial centers by air bombing.

That the U.S.S.R. could suffer all these stupendous

losses and still survive and go over to a victorious of-

fensive literally staggers the imagination, and doubly
so because of the great odds that were against her at
the start of the. war. Facing a similar situation, any
other nation in the world would have been long since

' -defeated and thrown in the sponge. But the Soviet

Union went right on ﬁghting, actually increasing its

"military strength, with the spectacular battle results

which have so long held the world spellbound in sur-
prise and, admiration. '

Some Valuable Lessons of the Past

, Before undertaking to explain the basic reasons for
the unparalleled ﬁghting capacities of the Soviet nation,
it will be well for us to realize that the present “im-

possible” military accomplishments of the Red Army

are ‘quite in line with the Soviet tempo of life, effort
and development generally, as exempliﬁed by the ex-
traordinary achievements, economic, political and mili-
tary, of the Soviet people during the whole life of the
Soviet Government.

High among these great accomplishments may be V

cited the overthrow of the Tsarist-capitalist regime in
1917 and the establishment of the Soviet Government.
The idea of securing the victory of socialism in a back-
ward agricultural country such as old Russia, where the
workers constituted only 15 per cent of the population,
had- long been pronounced utterly impossible by the
bigwig leaders of the Second International, as well
as by capitalist writers and thinkers generally. But the
“impossible” was accomplished by the Russian Com-

munist Party, led by the great Lenin and, in the face

of every obstacle, the world's ﬁrs't socialist country was

organized.

Next, there was the task of defending the revolution
against world reaction, a task which the Social-Demo-
crats also called impossible. And at one time it almost
looked as though they were right, for during the civil
war about 90 per cent of the country fell into the hands
of the French, American, British, Japanese, Polish,
Czech, German, White Guard and various other coun-
ter-revolutionary armies that ringed the besieged Soviet
Government on all sides. Reorganizing the demoralized
and defeated Russian armies, and by a military achieve-
ment unparalleled in history (General MacArthur
please take note) the Soviet people scattered all their
enemies and drove them beyond the borders of the
U.S.S.R. The “impossible” was accomplished once
again. -

To mention just one more “miracle” of Soviet

achievement—there was the great task of building the

industries and agriculture. When Stalin in 1928 pro-
6 .

 

 

mulgated his huge .plan of development in the First
F ive-Year Plan, the .whole capitalist world sneered and
guffawed. What fantastic nonsense was this, snicker-
ingly asked the learned economists, industrialists, and
politicians. Surely nothing, they declared, but a Com-
munist propaganda stunt; something to breathe the
breath of life for a few more months into the collapsing
Soviet regime. Instead of ﬁve years, said a leading
German industrialist, it would take even German en-

gineers ﬁfty years to realize in Russia the far-reaching.

industrial projects of the First Five-Year Plan, and as
for the Communists themselves, they could never do it,
in a full half century. Especially were the capitalist
and Social-Democratic wiseacres scornful of the propos-
als to reorganize the medieval Russian agriculture into
broad collective farms. But the Soviet people, led by
their great Communist Party, with Stalin now at its
head, accomplished and doubl'e—accomplished these “im-
possibilities.”

‘ Unable to borrow capital abroad, with but a handful
of engineers and only a small body of skilled workers,
and with their country devastated by seven years of impe-
rialist and civil wars, they nevertheless carried not only
the ﬁrst but also the second and third Five-Year Plans
to overwhelming success. They built Soviet industry
and agriculture of a quality and at a rate that have never

' been equaled in any country, not even the United States

in its days of stormiest economic growth. All of which
was an indication of the extreme speed with which the

Soviet people will rebuild their ravaged country once -

this war has been won.

The current “incredible” military achievements of the
Red Army are consequently based upon and cut from
thesame material as the many other “impossibilities”
accomplished by the Soviet people during the building
and defense of their socialist fatherland. Therefore, let

us Ibok a bit at the national organization that has pro-

duced these many spectacular successes, of which the 
profound victories of the Red Army are the present—day

example. _ '

II. WHY THE‘ SOVIET UNION SUCCEEDS

THE BASIC EXPLANATION for the tremendous
effort of the U.S.S.R., which for two years has amazed
the whole world, lies in the socialist character of its re-

gime, in its fundamentally democratic system. That '
the economic resources of the country are owned -

by the entire‘ people, that the government is pro-
folundly ﬁlemocratic, and t(li1at a1tll_se1ctions of the pop-
u ation ave economic an po itica interests in com-
mon, combine to give the U.S.S.R. a military striking
power unequaled, resource for resource, by any other
country on either side of the war. The greater tempo
and intensity of the Soviet Union’s war effort are ex-
empliﬁed by that cour1try’s much ﬁrmer national‘ unity,
the higher morale of its people and army, its more com-
plete industrial mobilization, and its more resolute and
. . . t. .

powerful military activities.

The fact that the Russians are ﬁ htin to defend their

‘ O I I g g 0

native land against h1story’s most ruthless invaders lends

. great strength to their arms, but it is, the socialist char-

acter of their country that ﬁres them with unbreakable
solidarity and enables them to strike the terriﬁc‘ mili-
tary blows that have shattered Hitler's, Tojo’s and Mus-
so1ini’s plans of world conquest. It is a curious para-
dox of this war that the most profoundly peace-loving
country, the one that led the world ﬁght for collective
security to- prevent the war, the U.S.S.R., turned out‘
to be the most effective warrior natiori once the war

was thrust upon it. And fortunate, indeed, it is for

8

 

 

the world that this is so, else the war would have long- .

since been won by the fascists.

Firm National Unity _

I The high quality of the war effort of the U.S.S.R. is
shown, ﬁrst of all, by the incomparable solidarity of its
people. Workers, peasants, intellectuals, united by the
doubly effective bonds of patriotism and socialism, are
standing together in ‘an unbreakable bloc and they are
giving unequaled examples’ of sacriﬁce, work and cour-
age in the factories and on the ﬁeld of battle. Neither

— England nor’ the United States has achieved anything

approaching the high solidarity of the Soviet people.
The struggle that great groups of American industrial-
ists and at least 90 per cent of the press are carrying on
against our Commander-in-Chief, against the workers,
against the labor movement, and the defeatist maneuv-
erings of ﬁfth column politicians in Congress, all of
which have paralyzing effects upon the national war. ef-

'fort, would be quite unthinkable in the thoroughly

united U.S.S.R., and so would the less open but nonethe-
less dangerous defeatist opposition in Great Britain.
Germany and Japan, on the other side of the strug-
gle, make a great show of national unity; but this is very
largely only on the ‘surface. The so-called national
unity of the fascist countries in no sense compares with

"the ﬁrm national unity of the Soviet people. In reality,

in Germany and Japan there is much political opposi-
tion to the war on the part of workers, farmers and in-
tellectuals, and even some sections of the capitalists, al-
though all this is repressed by the iron fascist tyranny.
When the war ends and- we get a more exact picture of
what has been happening in Germany and Japan, un-
doubtedly we shall.be amazed to learn the extent to
which’ political disunity slowed up the war effort of
these two nations. Soviet national unity, which stands
