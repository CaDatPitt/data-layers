seas of the Faith, a tempestuous existence ﬂourished in

the slums of the poor. Not only did they mark the sea- -

sons celebrating births and weddings and deaths, the ideas
of the times agitated their days. The Foster household
instantly became a center of Fenian disputation. If there
was‘ little food in the kitchen pot, there was ample
sustenance for the mind and the spirit.

William Z. Foster was born in Taunton, Massachu-
setts, February 25, 1881, the same year that the American
Federation of Labor was founded. When he was six
the family left the town where the red ﬂag of revolution
was ﬁrst raised in this land, in 1776--

“We’ll defend it with valor and virtue and votes
The Red Flag of Taunton that waves o’er the green.”

——and they mo-ved to Seventeenth and Kater Street, Phila-
delphia, where the poorest of the poor lived. The Foster
household stood on a cobblestoned street of weather-
beaten, ramshackle dwellings. Many of the houses were
tenanted by the half-starved, the diseased, folk who had
lost hope in life. Casual labor, beggary, petty thieving
were common. Yet given half a chance you could see how
they yearned for more of the life than the brand they in-
herited. The boy’s gang to which young Bill belonged,
the Bulldogs, had a social club where they sang and
danced, a rattling good baseball team, a ﬁfe—and—drum
corps that was said to be the best boy's band in the coun-
try. And most of the youngsters came to manhood of
industrious labor. Like Bill's father who earned the bread
for his family washing carriages in the livery stables, they
had a sturdy, unspoiled pride in their class.

And most, like him, never had a day’s book learning.
“I never went to school but one day,” Jim laughed, “and
that day school did not keep.” And so Mother Foster.
Yet she revealed an innate intellectual vigor and she was

desperately eager that young Bill would be at the books.
She grieved that they could only give him four years
of formal schooling, from the age of seven to ten, but
she noted that he revealed a precocious aptitude. Often he
sat down on the curbstone as a youngster selling papers
after school to spell out the words in the Philadelphia Eve-
ning Star, the News, the Item and the Call, that told of
big strikes in Pittsburgh and further West. It was a time
of great social battles as the Robber Barons hogged a con-
tinent. He read the stories with an excitement born of
some young glimmering of understanding and loyalty to
the class into which he was born.

Mother Foster encouraged him to frequent the free
public library which had, then, the aura of charity. Only
the lower classes took books out on loan: the prosperous
bought them, or rented them from private libraries.
What did that matter to the tall, slender blue-eyed young-
ster who was drawn by the magic of the printed page.
He became a veritable ‘boarder at the library, and once
when he brought the family priest, Father O'Connor
a copy of Irish Martyrs and Patriots, the cleric straight-
away decided that the promising lad must go to the
Jesuit college where he had studied. At that time, young
Bill had not yet decided whether to dedicate his life to
the church or to Irish independence.

Apprenticed at ten to old Kretchman, a German sculp-
tor and engraver, he continued reading whatever books
his inclinations put into his hands. In the three years
he worked for the old artist who helped to build the giant
statue of William Penn atop Philadelphia's City Hall,
he kept at the books. In his early teens he began to read
the histories of the French and American Revolutions,
heady stuﬂ indeed. Then he passed on to Tom Paine’s
works, marveled at his Age of Reason, a little later to
Lecky’s History of European Morals, Gibbon’s Decline
and -Fall of the Roman Empire, Herbert Spencer. He

9

topped’ these off with Darwin’s Origin of Species and De-
scent of Man. He read these books with a growing amaze-
ment. When he closed the covers he was through with
his mother’s dream of priesthood.

Possessed of an extraordinary inquisitive mind the
youngster noted well the times in which he lived. The
ﬁrst ﬁfteen years of his life was an era of great strikes,
the heyday of the Knights of Labor, the years the Ameri-
can Federation of Labor was coming to the fore. Home-
sted and its Pinkerton invasion was in 1892; in May of
1894, in the midst of the industrial crisis of the time
when breadlines became a way of life, Eugene V. Debs
headed the American Railway Union's strike which only
the Federal Government and treason by the aristocrats
of the unions could crush. And young Foster plunged into
his ﬁrst strike, that of the Philadelphia street carmen in
l p 1895, when he was 14. The company had summoned pro-
T fessional scabs who carried their deadly Smiths and Wes-
sons under their coats to join the police violence. The
youngsters of “Skitereen,” as they called the working
class community where Foster lived, promptly joined the
strikers. Mounted police charged a peaceful parade in
which the strikers carried brooms and the cursing men in
uniform struck savagely at them with their nightsticks.
The boys retaliated by spreading heaps of ashes across
y the tracks that utterly ruined the run of the brand-new
E electric cars. Though armed police accompanied the
scab motormen the boys wrecked every car that ventured
into the territory.

The strike left a lasting impression on the youngster’s
mind. Though he was but 14, and belonged as yet to no
trade union, he was already a unionist in sympathy. No-
body, even at that age, had to tell him who initiated “force
and violence.’’ He had learned Primary Lesson One:
that the individual worker is helpless against the em-
ployer supported by the government and that only by

unity with other workers could he make his strength
count. One man alone was one man alone. That lesson
did much to determine the life's course of this boy who
was to become a generation later the labor leader most
feared by America’s mighty industrial dynasts.

Working and Reading

KRETCHMAN, A CRUSTY old German yet an artist of excep-
tional gifts was fond of the alert lad from the slums who
had a way of catching on fast. He taught Bill lessons
in all the arts he knew so we1l—clay modeling, plaster of
Paris work, wood carving, stone cutting, drawing, paint-
ing, electroplating. _But the son of “Skitereen,” of Jim
and Elizabeth, had no inclination for a life of art. Some
impulse born of his class, of his associations and sympa-
thies, drove his interests to the great, clamorous shops
and factories springing up in Philadelphia as they were
across the land. “I was drawn as by a magnet to the
shops,” he wrote later.

Endowed with a strong frame, an abundance of en-
ergy, and an insatiable curiosity about all the processes
of industry, he found work in the American Type Found-
ers Company. Three years there and his constitution was
soaked with the poisonous lead. But you take work where
there is work, a simple dictum of the workingman’s life.
After his dangerous years at the lead plant, young Foster
—reading more avidly than ever in his evenings and on
Sundays—found a job in a fertilizer plant, ﬁrst as a com-
mon laborer, then, as steam ﬁtter, ﬁreman, engineer, and
skilled fertilizer mixer. No job for the squeamish was
this: the ﬂoor, as Bill has written, “was a creeping carpet of
maggots.” In the summer hundreds of tons of rotting
swill festered outside the plant in the blazing sun. Here
he worked, among the rotting disposal of a city, amid ﬁlth,
his head ﬁlled with bright thoughts from John Stuart

11

Mill, Lecky, Paine, Darwin. After three years here he
came down with the ﬁrst stages of tuberculosis. Virtually
alone now, his mother dead at 53, his father at 56, Bill
quit the plant, worked at various jobs in the South, in
turpentine forests where he caught his ﬁrst glimpse of
the Negro’s horrifying lot, and then he went tosea, hoping
that the open, clear air would cure his lungs.

Aboard ship he thought often of a soapboxer he had
heard on the street near his home one day in his nineteenth
year, who had talked eloquently of a time when the work-
ers would own all the goods and the resources of the
land through their state, a workingman’s state. Socialism,
the speaker had called it, a word that never again left
the mind of the young listener. The speaker had dis-
tributed a leaﬂet which bore a cartoon Bill never forgot.
A big ﬁgure labeled “Labor” cowered beneath a whip
wielded by a puny ﬁgure, “the Boss.” The whip was
titled, “the Job.” To young Bill, then a tall, slim, blue—
eyed lad it seemed the most magniﬁcent drawing he had
ever seen. He joined the Socialist Party at the age of 19.

Now, at sea, the years from 1901 to 1904, passed quickly
on the old, square-rigged sailing ships that fascinated him.
Twice around Cape Horn, once around the Cape of Good
Hope, he traveled some ﬁfty thousand miles, assessing
life in the squalid water-front towns of Africa, Australia,
South America. He became an able-bodied seaman who
could, as he wrote, do everything aboard ship from mak-
ing a ratline on a spinning jenny to stepping a mast. De-
spite hard, unremitting work, unceasing rigors and dan-
ger, his sick lungs began to mend in the exhilarating
open. And his mind continued to grow. There were his
books, for seamen were reading men, and he read novels
like Eugene Sue's Wandering Jew as he rounded Cape
Horn, believing that no man could ever again write so
profound a work.

And above all there were the men of the crew, rugged,

fearless, tough, thoughtful, a race of storytellers, a world
of life behind their weather-beaten eyes. The rough
camaraderie of the sea was attuned to his innate regard
for his class, his people, working people. He learned
much of men as he listened to tars like Ole the Nor-
wegian who disappeared from his side in the furious blow
rounding the hemisphere and was lost in the seas, and from
men like Frenchy, who went down the same time, “just
two more sailors, unknown and unsung,” Bill said later,
“lost off that great grave yard of deep-water ships and
men, Cape Horn.” Drama, tragedy and sometimes com-
edy, coursed through every day of his sea life. And he
knew the dull pain of hunger that was scarcely alleviated
by that daily pound of sea biscuit, the ration of salt beef,
salt pork, pea soup. For often the ship's supplies ran
short and the menisubsisted on diminished starvation ra-
tions until they came to port.

The three years on the oceans stayed the consumption
of his lungs, and taught him, more surely than ever,
that only the combined power of the seamen, in strong
unions, could alter the miserable life he had seen. On
his return he joined the Atlantic Coast S'ea‘man’s Union.

And so a workingman’s life, a workingman’s thought,
his ﬁbre, was being fashioned. The consciousness of his
class, strong at the outset, was becoming as much a part of
him as the blood that ran in his veins. And yet he had
more to learn, avid as he was for knowledge, for experi-
ence, for ideas, athirst for everything life had to reveal.
He decided, shortly after his return from the sea, to go
West, The mysteries of his native land must be plumbed,
mastered, as he had the seven seas. What of the Rockies,
the great Mississippi, the Far West that had, since Gree-
ley’s day, drawn so many of the previous generations of
Americans and of his own? What was life like beyond
the Great Divide? And oﬂ? he went, as so many had before
him, hoboing, as they called it, riding the freigh-ts, which

13

had brought many a good man to a horrible death be-
neath the grinding wheels of steel. But the young work-
y ingman was in excellent control of his reﬂexes, had learned
  to stay among the quick and no-t the dead, and he mas-
5 tered the knack of riding the fast freights, learned to
travel in cold, often thirty degrees below zero, learned to
avoid the brakemen who would beat you with brake
handles and the railroad police who would shoot at you
as though you were game.
Bill continued to travel across the nation, learning its
, i special idiosyncracies as a Harvard professor might get
i y  to know his Yard, his campus green. And forever he talked
,   and listened, listened and talked to the men known as
r s 5 ﬂoating migratory workers, the loggers, sawmill men,
V harvest hands, sheep herders, cowpunchers, ﬁshermen, sail-
4 Q  ors, miners, railroad construction laborers. A hard, dan-
r 1 1 gerous education but inﬁnitely rewarding. And so, about
1 the time upper-class Americans ﬁnished their studies at
  Harvard or at Princeton, he became steeped in the life
1  and tradition» of the American working class. He was
1 5   J graduating, summa cum laude, into a manhood that would
« ? reap unprecedented good for his class, his nation.

l  Socialist and Wobbly

IN MANY WAYS his political education began, or at least
, , quickened, in Portland, Oregon, where he settled for the
1 j time. The city was a turbulent port near the turn of the
E ,:  a century, lusty, argumentative, untamed, the frontier ﬂex-
y r ' ing its muscles. The streets were ﬁlled with seamen off
1   the ships, brawny loggers down from the camps and the
3  : sawmills, the restless migratory workers in from the wheat-
I ﬁelds and orchards, all of whom talked long and earnestly
, y of their lives and their work as they nursed a glass of
\  j P beer or walked down the waterfront under the Paciﬁc
‘  i 3 sun between jobs.

The ideas of Socialism were astir, and also other social
and political ideas. Bill, now a sober twenty-four, serious
yet companionable, worked at various jobs, logging,
building, railroad construction, farming. And reading.
Reading every spare moment, his quick mind sifting the
ideas, his steel-trap memory storing them away: the Com-
munist Manifesto, Wage Labor and Capital, Value, Price
and Proﬁt, Capital itself. If he read more than his fel-
lows, they did not regard him as some kind of scholarly
recluse, for he displayed a passionate interest in their
lives. He was an ardent sportsman, a good mixer despite
his penchant for the books, and he knew and shared their
days as they lived them. He did not live apart, neither
then or afterward.

This industrial worker had a passion, an absolute greed,
for life. He must taste it all. And when a brother-in-law
suggested that they stake a homestead in the foothills of
the Oregon Cascades, he took him up, as much perhaps,
to ﬁnally cure his tuberculosis as for any other reason.
For «three years, for several months each year, he lived
in the piny wilderness among the magniﬁcent cliffs and
valleys, working at the immemorial chores of the farm-
side, talking to the neighbors of evenings and Sundays,
discovering their aspirations, their trials, their tribula-
tions. And with that thoroughness that is his, he came
to know the wild life and the plant life, studying them
with his characteristic meticulousness. He hunted the
cougar and the deer, the brown bear and the grouse,
knew their ways and their habitats. That was during the

' summers. The other nine months each year during this

time he worked at his industrial jobs, continued his po-
litical and labor agitation.

After three years he sold his grubstake, the only prop-
erty he had ever owned in his life, for something within
him stirred with repugnance at the sense of privately own-
ing that which all men should have in common.

15

. 

His primary interest was in the Portland, Oregon,
branch of the Socialist Party. He had plunged into its dis-
cussions and its activities with characteristic ardor, dis-
tributed the Appeal to Reason, the organ of the Socialists,

, organized, read everything on politics and political econ-
l ~ omy that came to the West Coast: Paul Lafargue, George
Plekhanov, Karl Kautsky, August Bebel. News of the 1905
Revolution in tsarist Russia quickened his imagination
and led him to think and study more of the ideas that the
European Marxists expressed. And there was virtually
a library of reading to do in the books and pamphlets
of American labor writers, primarily, in that time, of
Daniel De Leon's works, the leader of the Socialist Labor
Party.

When the Industrial Workers of the World, the “Wob-
blies” as they came to be known, was born in 1905 Bill
studied its program with great interest but he decided,
at that time, not to join it because he could not agree
with its scorn for parliamentary, electoral struggle. Work-
ing, about this time, as a ﬁreman on a West Coast rail-
road, he decided, after six months, to join the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers as prelude to be-
coming an engineer.

The engineer on his train, an elderly man of wide read-

\ ; ing and an ardent Shakespearian (not unusual for the
time), liked the knowledgeable youngster and one day gave
him a play of the Bard’s to read. Foster sat up all night,
after the twelve-hour working day, reading, entranced.
The engineer could not believe his assistant had read the
work when Foster returned it to him the next day and
only when the young ﬁreman quoted extensive passages
1 =  was he convinced. The incident is signiﬁcant for it re-
vealed the wide cultural tastes of young Foster, the
archetype of the industrial workingman, and it throws
light on the relatively high cultural development of so
many proletarians in the time before Hollywood, the

While Bill was a ﬁreman the panic of 1907 broke. A
week before, it was boom-time, then overnight the armies
of the jobless ﬁlled the streets desperately seeking work.
Money literally disappeared in the economic hurricane,
an indelible example to Foster of capitalism's insane
method of production and distribution.

Bill, twenty-six then, totally immersed in the theoreti-
cal problems of Socialism, surveyed the scene. His party
was rent with dissension even though it grew from a hand-
ful in 1901 to some 42,000 in 1909. Many of the urban
middle classes, disillusioned with the two major parties,
distrusting the monopolies, had joined the Socialist Party.
More articulate than the workers they siezed the party's
leadership, inﬂuenced its policies which they watered down
to something, Bill felt, that was akin to the views of
William Jennings Bryan. “Their maximum program
was a thin gruel of government—owned industries duly
bought from the capitalists and called ‘Socialism’,” he
wrote later. The Socialist leaders resisted the desire of
the working class members for a party that would genu-
inely lead the nation’s wage workers into combat for a
better life today, as well as for total liberation later. The
leader shied from collision with Gompers’ union bu-
reaucrats, sabotaged the struggle for industrial unions
for which Debs had long since pioneered in his American
Railway union and for which the I.W.W. had been
formed.

Discontent with the Socialist leadership was strongest
in the West and Foster shared it deep1y.. Capitalism
could not be defeated by the policies of his party's lead-
ers. He shared the views of the left, the radicals, that
the Robber Barons, who loved wealth more deeply than
they did their own grandmothers, as a Marxist had put it,
would only yield to the superior power of the working

17

class. You had to ﬁght hard for every single inch. He
fought for his views along with other Socialist left—wing-
ers of the Coast, and in 1909, he and others like him,
were expelled fro-m the party in the state of Washington.
The event was of historic importance, for it marked the
beginning of the process from which a left—wing Socialist
movement crystallized in America.

The ardent Socialist worker needed a political home.
But where do you go from here? The Socialist Labor
Party? But De Leon’s narrow political views repelled him,
for the leader of the S.L.P. disavowed the importance of 1
every-day struggle for partial, immediate demands. Con- l
cessions wrung from the employers, De Leon argued, ‘
were only so many “banana peels under the feet of the J
proletariat.” Furthermore, he espoused dual unionism,
which Foster was to regard, not lo-ng afterward, as a bane-
ful inﬂuence upon the left-wing working class ﬁghters
of America. -

Sensing the crass sectarianism of the S.L.P., unable to
accept fully the views of the I.W.W., Bill and his asso-
ciates formed a new anti-capitalist party, “The Wage Work-
ers Party.” Ever groping for an adequate program, he
was never fully satisﬁed with the program of this group.
Its reply to the middle-class dominated Socialist Party was
to exclude all members of the middle class from its ranks.
It regarded industrial unionism as its ace card, but it also
opposed parliamentary action. The organization was dead
a few years later. The big ﬁghts in the Socialist Party ‘
were still to come—in 1912, and the national split in 1919
which led to the formation of the Communist Party.

And so Bill found himself in the ranks of the I.W.W.

He was later to write, in his typically courageous self
critical manner that his failure to return to the Socialist
Party was a sore political error. It would have been far
better, he came to feel, if he had remained within the
Socialist Party, allied himself with its left—wing which

Years of Search

THE NEXT DOZEN years were years of intense search,
crowned by his ardent and arduous labors on behalf of
the working class. He had joined the IWW’s brave ﬁght
for free speech in the Northwest, reporting it for the
Workingmerfs Paper. Heartily he endorsed the splendid
ﬁghting spirit of the IWW at that time, which ﬁlled the
prisons with the proletarian champions of their constitu-
tional rights, many of them “voluntary” prisoners, de-
manding to be put in jail when their comrades were ar-
rested. In the course of this struggle he met Elizabeth
Gurley Flynn, who was to become a comrade-in-arms for
much of their lives. He served two months in jail dur-
ing the free speech ﬁghts and it was while he was in prison
that he took out a Wobbly card.

Late in the year of 1909, his head full of the ideas
he had read of the European radical labor movement, he
decided to travel to the Continent to study the experiences

of labor there, most speciﬁcally, the syndicalist movement ’

of France. He had a slim pocketbook, $100, for the long
trip but his fortune was his powerful will, his intense
curiosity, and his boundless. resourcefulness. He hoboed
his way to New York and from there worked his way
across.

In Paris the French Syndicalists heartily welcomed
the alert militant from ‘distant America. Living with
working class families, he learned the language with re-
markable speed; little escaped his eye in this era of labor’s
tumultuous growth in France. He studied the nationwide
railroad strike the Syndicalists led and he was impressed
especially with their basic trade union practice. It made
mighty good sense to him. They stayed within the con-
servative unions to spread their ideas and inﬂuence, shar-

19

 

ing the life and struggles of the rank-and-ﬁle members
of the reformist-led unions and, in time, he saw, they ac-
quired the leadership of France's trade union movement.
This procedure answered the many questions on trade
union strategy that had been growing in him for some

time. It was to play an enormous part in his future ac--
tivities for he determined he would bring this concept

back to the IWW and ﬁght for it.

In Germany where he interviewed Kautsky, Legien,.

and other leaders, he became convinced, during his six-
month stay, that right-wing Socialism, here as in all lands,
was a roadblock to the progress of the working class.
Penniless, a condition scarcely novel to him, he walked the
dusty roads 150 miles to attend the national congress of
the German trade unions in Dresden and what he saw
there conﬁrmed his previous impressions. He went on to
Budapest to represent the Wobblies at the meeting of the
International Trade Union Secretariat. On his arrival,
Franz Josef’s gendarmes arrested him for sleeping in a
moving-van on the city’s outskirts. The French delegates
induced him to accept a small loan of a few francs, and
after a day or two Vincent St. john, head of the Wob-
blies, cabled him to return immediately to report his
ﬁndings to an IWW convention.

Back in Chicago, September of 1911, he pressed his
ideas of joining the big unions and working from within.
That became his central, overriding objective and he
stumped for it with all the vigor and persuasiveness he
owned.

It is hard for progressive Americans today to realize
what this meant in that time. Merely to air this idea
damned you as an opportunist of extraordinary degree.
Hadn’t the giants, De Leon, Eugene V. Debs, Big Bill Hay-
wood denounced the old AFL unions? The most militant
in American labor regarded the AFL with profound mis-
trust, mistaking the value of the organization for its

leaders so many of whom were hopelessly corrupted by

A the fat salaries and who preached collaboration with their

oppressors, the lords of Big Business. But, Bill argued
in return, you are playing into the hands of the mislead-
ers, of the employers themselves, if you drain away the
bravest, the most far-sighted into dual unions. Stay
inside the big organizations, he pleaded, persuade the
members to ﬁght for stronger unions, honest leaders, bet-
ter wages and working conditions, and for the advanced
ideas of ultimate Socialism.

The heresy of this persuasive young leader did win him
a number of outstanding workingmen, men touched with
the genius and ﬁre he had, men like Jack Johnstone, like
Earl C. Ford, like Frank Little (the brave unionist who
was lynched by vigilantes in Butte, Montana), like Joe
Manley. Even Bill Haywood was shaken, and came to
agree, at least in part, with Foster. The signiﬁcance of
Bill's ﬁght on this issue is of critical import in the history
of American labor, doubtless his single greatest contri-
bution to the strategy and theory of trade unionism.

And he crusaded for it, together with like-minded So-
cialists and militants in the labor movement. Rebuffed by
the IWW, Foster organized the Syndicalist League of
North America in 1912, modeled after the French Con-
federation of Labor. As Foster wrote later, while its posi-
tion against dual unionism was sound, the League petered
out in two years primarily because of its incorrect anti-
parliamentary and semi-anarchist program.

Birth of a Labor Leader

HIS TRADE UNION theories were later tested in the crucible

of the biggest strike ever held in the packinghouse industry

which he and Johnstone led for the Chicago Federation of

Labor in 1917. Most veteran union leaders did not be-
21

1

lieve this industry could possibly be organized. Did it not
consist of illiterate foreign-born workers, each segment
of which could scarcely communicate with the other, Poles
and Slavs of other nationalities, Irishmen, as well as many
Negroes. The owners, Armour, Swift, the others of the
Big Five were as arrogant a set of industrial cutthroats
as ever met a payroll. They had refused to grant even a
penny’s raise in thirteen years. Wages had sunk so low
as twelve and a half cents an hour for the unskilled.
Families, by the thousands, were undernourished and
lived dreadfully in shacks around the stockyards as many
came to know from Upton Sinclair’s novel. The Jungle, the
material for which was collected by the Socialist Ella
Reeve Bloor, later a founder of the Communist Party.
The proﬁts of the big packers spiralled to unequalled
heights as they battened off the world war.

A dozen AFL packinghouse unions were involved in
the movement Foster, and his friend, johnstone, led.
The packers, the topﬂight AFL leaders, the Government,
fearful of the strike, maneuvered the movement into ar-
bitration early in 1918. The government arbitrator agreed
to hold meetings to hear the workers’ side of the story.
For three weeks the workers Foster brought out of the
stockyard slums testiﬁed, one after another taking the
stand to tell simply, and irrefutably, of their hardships.
They spoke of children who went to school hungry, thinly
clad for the harsh Chicago winters, to-ld of work that
devoured health, of accidents that took a horrifying toll in
the great plants. The multi-millionaire owners sneered
at the testimony, one remarking that two pairs of shoes
yearly for a worker’s child was more than enough: a child
only had one pair of feet. A Polish woman worker came
to the stand, her plain, peasant countenance ravaged by

years of hard work, an old—world kerchief over her head. ‘

Yes, she replied to the examiner’s question, she did once
own a hat but that was back in Poland. “Since I came to

When the ghastly parade ended, the arbitrator was com-
pelled to decide in -favor of the workers. He granted the
eight-hour day with ten hours pay, wage increases, better
working conditions and a partial recognition of the un-
ion. Foster and his associates organized the industry
of 200,000, the ﬁrst American mass production industry
to be solidly organized. The union included native
and foreign-bom, white and Negro. Not only was the vic-
tory a milestone in American labor organization, it set a
precedent for the organization of Negroes into the AFL.
Foster’s insistence upon the inclusion of Negroes in the
same unio-ns as whites had a major and pioneering effect.
This was the largest Negro trade union membership
ever organized in any American city—and this at a time
when very many AFL craft unions barred Negroes from
membership.

The victory, naturally, brought Foster merited prestige.
Samuel Gompers, who ruled the AFL like a tsar, re-
spected Foster's abilities even as he feared his accomplish-
ments. The AFL bureaucracy had triedto undermine the

national packinghouse campaign from the outset, working

in collusion with the employers.

If they were shocked at this advance, they were scarcely
prepared for what was to come. Nobody had an idea
that Foster carried, at the conclusion of the packinghouse
campaign, an outline in his pocket for the organization
of steel. He envisaged a whirlwind campaign that would
involve all important steel centers simultaneously, to be
carried out by all the unions claiming jurisdiction in
that industry. His proposals to prop-el the masses of work-
ers into motion were realistic, his idea of federating the
unions was practical, as the packinghouse campaign had
proven. He had a simple plan for ﬁnancing the campaign,
twenty-ﬁve cents per capita from each member of the

23

ﬁfteen initiator AFL unions. The plan had scope, grand-
eur, and a meticulous care for detail.

Gompers was indeed an unwilling horse to be led to this
trough. He pretended agreement in general but he and
his satellites threw every conceivable roadblock in Fos-
ter’s way, sabotaging everything but the principle of a
federated campaign. Certainly the steel workers, sweated
to death by the twelve-hour day, were ready to organize.
That Foster knew and his generalship had conceived a
swift, mass campaign, a concerted lightning offensive that
would bring the workers into the union en masse. For
a long time he had scorned the halting, cautious, dry-as-
dust methods of the swivel-chair bureaucrats who con-
sidered it a triumph to get workers into the unions singly,
or in a small trickle over inordinate lengths of time.

Foster requested one hundred organizers for the cam-
paign: Gompers’ men granted him six. His proposal for
a twenty-ﬁve cent assessment was simply ignored. His idea
of a national campaign executed simultaneously in all
districts was whittled down to one area, the Calumet re~
gion around Chicago. The AFL national headquarters
pledged not a single red penny; the ﬁfteen unions Voted
a measly $100 each. Many a lesser man would have re-
coiled at the task before him, feared the loss of face if his
plans went awry under such deliberate handicaps. Yet,
Bill calculated, the time was so ripe, the employers
raking in fantastic proﬁts on wartime steel, the workers
were so eager to move, that he was conﬁdent of the out—
come. Union work began in Gary, South Chicago, 10-
liet, Indiana Harbor.

The very ﬁrst meeting in Gary amply conﬁrmed
Foster’s analysis of the workers’ mood: ﬁfteen thousand
steel workers stormed their way into the halls. Similarly
in the other steel towns of the region that same week.
By the thousands the workers of every nationality streamed
into the union halls to take out union cards. The barons

of steel, the mightiest in all the land, were horriﬁed.
They had regarded the threat to unionize the industry
lightly, knowing well enough how Gompers felt about

,matters. But they had not reckoned on a maverick, a

radical, a man named Foster.

United States Steel, the greatest corporation in all the
world and the mightiest in all history, struck back. Its
general staff of crafty advisers, its unlimited assistance
from the government of the mightiest power on earth,
its treasury of wealth were marshalled to defeat the plans
of the man from “Skitereen” whose father was a carriage-
washer. John Pierpont Morgan’s armies used every tac-
tic of force and guile, every wile of concession and stroke
of naked violence.

To stymie the surge toward unionization, they granted
four successive national wage increases and ﬁnally con-
ceded a basic eight-hour day. They set up a bewildering
profusion of company unions, and ﬁred 30,000 workers for
holding cards in thevtrade unions. They fostered terrorist
outﬁts like the Ku Klux Klan, sent spies out by the thou-

’ sands, mobilized the town, county and state ofﬁcials to

grind out repressive decisions.

And yet, after fourteen months of hard, unremitting
grueling struggle the union was ﬁrmly established in nearly
all key plants of the main steel districts. At least a quar-
ter of a million workers joined, Negroes, native—bom,
immigrants and the sons of immigrants. The impossible
had been achieved.

The strike for which the workers pressed to gain union
recognition and to rivet down the gains their surge toward
organization had achieved, was called September 22, 1919.
Some 365,000 workers in ﬁfty cities walked out: a giant
blow against a giant enemy. Judge Elbert Gary, head of
U.S. Steel, fought remorselessly with all the brute power
money can buy: armies of scabs, private gunmen, police
departments wholesale, soldiers. Civil rights were scorned:

25

the newspapers ground out false reports in every issue. A

The AFL national office sabotaged the strike every con-
ceivable way. ‘
For it must be remembered that Foster had begun pre-

paring this strike during wartime, when the policy of the

AFL leaders was “social peace” and collaboration with
the war-mad proﬁteers. They carried this policy over into
the immediate postwar period when the strike occurred.
To Foster, World War I was clearly an imperialist war for
the division of the world’s markets and the only interest
the workers could have in it, he argued, was to bring it
to a speedy end upon the most democratic terms possible.
He had opposed the outbreak of the war and United

States participation in it. His Syndicalist League of North s

America and the International Trade Union Educational
League had condemned imperialist war and world war
in particular. After the conservative leaders of the work-
ers had betrayed them into the war, Fo-ster decided that
the best course he could take was to exploit the war situa-
tion in order to organize the great masses of unorganized
workers. Similarly, Foster’s views on postwar problems
clashed with the continuing class-collaboration perspective
of the AFL bureaucracy.

So the chips were down: yet despite the daily sabo-
tage of Go-mpers’ lieutenants, the strike continued against
enormous odds. Twenty-two strikers were murdered, like
the beloved organizer, Mrs. Fanny Sellins. Hundreds
were slugged and sho-t, thousands went to prison and yet
more than a million and a half men, women and chil-
dren struggled on for three and a half months. One of
the reasons it could continue this long was that a new
system of providing food, collected from many areas,
had been devised, which fo-r a time saved the workers
and their families from being starved out. Foster was
everywhere in the thick of the battle, speaking in company
towns where the Legion’s oﬂicials assured him in advance

his life wasn't worth a plugged nickel if he showed up.
The workers venerated him as a fearless and incorruptible
leader. But human endurance could not withstand the
crushing combination of forces, and on January 8, 1920,
the strike was called off.

But it culminated in establishing the principle of the
eight-hour day. The value of industrial unions, on a na-
tional, industry~wide scale had been proven. What the
dead hand of Gompers and his associates could stiﬂe
in 1919, no man could smother in 1935, no, not after this
historic experience. The organization of steel in 1935
was built on the struggle Foster led in 1919.

Unquestionably the workers could have been successful
in 1919, this Foster knew. And he had planned, after
steel, to achieve the organization of all industries in the
land. No question too that the organization of the unor-
ganized would have smashed the Gompers’ machine, given
rise, he wrote, to a new spirited, able leade-rship that

would reﬂect the sturdy mass of America’s industrial
rank-and-ﬁle.

To-ward Communism

THE EXPERIENCE IN steel and in packinghouse fortiﬁed
certain conclusions Foster had long held. Successful work
within the mass unions to win the majority for a healthy
working class program required the existence within them
of an organized militant minority, a factor lacking in both
the great campaigns. He set about to remedy that lack
by building the Trade Union Educational League. Re-
grettably, many honest left—wingers still wore the blink-
ers of dual unionism. This was not only true of old mili-
tants, it was also true of most advanced workers, then
founding the Communist movement in this land. The la-

bor movements of many other lands suffered from the
same malady.

WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

An Appreciation

by JOSEPH NORTH

&

INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHERS, New York

 

 

At about this time a bolt ﬂashed from the ﬁrst workers’
country of the world, the Soviet Republic. There the great
proletarian leader named Lenin wrote his famous work
that was translated throughout the world, and here, in the
U.S.A., in the organ of a small left-wing party. It was
called Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder.
Lenin referred to dual unionism as “an unpardonable
blunder.” Refusal to work in the reactionary trade un-
ions abandoned the vast bulk of inexperienced workers to
the inﬂuence of labor’s~mis1eaders. Lenin's writings on the
matter, needless to say, delighted Foster: the principle
of his ten-year struggle against dual unionism was cor-
roborated by the foremost workingman’s leader of the
world. The concept of dual unionism was dealt a fatal
blow.

At this time Foster received an invitation to travel to
Moscow to attend the deliberations of the left labor un-
ions of the world, meeting at a conference of the Red
International of Labor Unions. He instantly accepted.
There he studied the life of the Soviet workers, their
trade unions, the politics and theories of the land, studied
with that ardent curiosity that is one of his chief char-
acteristics. He walked the streets, visited the factories
and talked with innumerable workers.

It was a time of enormous diﬂiculty. Seven years of
war, civil war, and armed intervention by fourteen for-
eign states in an attempt to overthrow the young Soviet
Republic were just ending and had left industry in ruins.
The nation suffered unimaginably from the economic
blockade imperialism had thrown around it. Starvation
walked the streets: typhus and cholera struck. Famine
parched the farmlands. Yet wherever the American
walked he discovered that the suffering workers were ir-
revocably attached to their new regime. It was theirs.
The calamities they withstood were caused by enemies
of the working class: that they knew. “It was plain as a

28

 

 

pikestaff to me that in Soviet Russia,” Foster wrote on his
return, “there had occurred a truly Socialist revolution.”
Its triumph would inevitably redound to the beneﬁt
of the working class in his native land and in all lands.
He must stand shoulder-to-shoulder with his brothers
there," as he would had this revolution happened in Brit-
ain or in Germany or in France, anywhere on the globe.
“The world's ﬁrst free commonwealth,” he said, “will
live.”

His intensive political study then, his ﬁrst-hand observa-
tion, brought him to inevitable conclusions: ﬁrst, that
the working class had at hand an invincible science
founded by Marx and brought forward into the twen-
tieth century by Lenin. Its principles, its basic precepts,
were valid everywhere though tactics and approach would
depend upon the characteristics and conditons in each
country.

He concluded, as he studied the ﬁrst nation where the
working class had become the dominant power, that the
toilers in each land require vanguard proletarian parties
based upon Marxism. The Communist Party that he saw
in the erstwhile land of the tsars, he wrote after his studies,
was “the highest type of organization ever produced by
mankind.”

He came to these conclusions after arduous study for
he had arrived with many erroneous preconceptions not
uncommon to the working class of the -day. “Buried in the
big packinghouse and steel campaigns, I had not found
the opportunity to free myself from the current opportu-
nist conceptions,” he wrote, “that Socialism could only
be brought about in a highly industrialized country.”
But what he saw there “shattered this wrong impres-
s1on.”

Upon his return to the United States in the summer
of 1921, he joined the Communist Party here. His sub-
sequent years of experience brilliantly conﬁrmed his deci-

29

 

sions, he felt, and in 1949, when he wrote The Twilight of
World Capitalism, he dedicated the book to his great

 

grandson “who will live in a Communist United States.”7

The Amalgamation F ight

WHAT HAPPENED IN the years since Foster joined the Com-
munist Party is a record, virtually, of his life during this
time. He became chairman of the party, a post he has
held for thirty years continuously, because of his great gifts
as union organizer, political leader and Marxist theoreti-
cian. Foster always felt the power and wisdom of his
party’s collective efforts, received inspiration from its
devoted members, learned from them even as they learned
from him.

The movement he had joined continued his de-

I termined crusade for the trade union principles he had

worked out. The Trade Union Educational League,
which he had founded, fought under his guidance for
the amalgamation of the craft unions into industrial
unions. Everywhere it taught the imperative need to
organize the unorganized, to crusade for unemployment
insurance and to achieve the independent political action
of labor. It insisted that the times required a Labor
Party; and to achieve peace in the world his TUEL urged
the American people to build the ﬁrmest fraternal rela-
tions with the peoples of the Soviet Union.

The crusade for these principles began in a time of un-
precedented struggle between the capitalist class and La-
bor. The employers were determined to crush America’s
unions and establish the Open Shop. A wave of strikes
engulfed the nation in opposition to Big Business’ objec-
tives. Capitalism and its spokesmen in the government
dragged out the red bogeyman to befuddle the issues and
to confuse the nation’s mind. Today’s repression has
abundant precedent. Thousands of workingmen had al-

30

ready been arrested and imprisoned under President Wil-
son's regime.

The TUEL, with Communists spark-plugging its cam-
paigns, shook the entire labor movement by its tri-
pronged program for amalgamation of trade unions, a
Labor Party and the recognition of Soviet Russia. At
least half of the American labor movement openly sup-
ported one or another, or all three of these demands. The
ﬁrst success was in the great coal strike of 1922; then in
the Chicago building trades strike in the spring of that
year. But the climax came in the national strike of 400,-
000 railroadmen also in that year, during which Foster
was kidnapped by Colorado state troopers when he came
to Denver to speak. They turned him over to the Wyo-
ming authorities who in turn carried him across the
border and dumped him ten miles inside of Nebraska.
Undeterred, he continued his organizing work, and the
TUEL movement in this strike culminated in a big na-
tional amalgamation conference of 400 delegates. in Chi-
cago, December of 1922.

Old Gompers watched the TUEL’s success with nervous
alarm. The tirades out of his office were ceaseless and
increasingly hysterical. “To-ols of Moscow,” was the fa-
vorite epithet then as it is today. Gompers was shaken
after the Ohio Federation of Labor virtually unani-
mously endorsed the TUEL’s resolution for amalgamation.
The old fox decided to come, in person, ﬂanked by his
beefy general staff, to the Chicago Federation of Labor's
conference where a similar vote was to be taken. Despite
his frowning presence he was soundly trounce-d by a vote of
103 to 14. Foster, on hand to defend the TUEL’s resolu-
tion, was challenged by Gompers to debate the issue pub-
licly, and Foster instantly picked up the gauntlet. But
the old man, full of second thoughts, quickly forgot the
challenge and though Bill frequently reminded him of it
publicly, the old bureaucrat never replied.

31

 

 

The stock of the newly-formed TUEL and the Com-
munist movement rose in the labor movement. It was then
that the federal authorities decided to intervene decisively.
Foster was the ﬁrst Communist tried after the authorities
had raided and arrested its leaders during a convention
in Bridgeman, Michigan. Despite the hysteria in the
newspapers, the ﬁerce efforts of both state and national
authorities during the trial in 1924, a hung jury freed him.
The jurymen had refused to be stampeded into acquies-
cence. Later Charles Ruthenberg, formerly a leader of
the Socialist left wing, a founder of the Communist
Party and its national secretary, was tried. And this -time
the authorities succeeded. Ruthenberg was found guilty
of criminal syndicalism and his tragic death at 45 came
before he entered the penitentiary gates.

The Age ‘of Myths

THE WHEEL or time moved on, and the ‘twenties, which
began with a postwar depression, turned by mid-decade
into a time of relative “prosperity.” Capitalism ﬁlled the
air with hosannahs to itself: “Ford, Not Marx,” became the
shibboleth of the day as the bourgeois economists bowed
to the Golden Calf and predicted an unending vista of
boom-time. The misleaders of labor, against whom Fos-
ter crusaded ceaselessly, in pamphlets, books and speeches,
fell into line with the employers. Class collaboration was
their avowed policy, the cessation of strikes; they had
arrived at “the higher strategy of labor.” They opened
banks, speculated in stocks, accepted the Baltimore and
Ohio plan as if, he wrote, it were “manna miraculously
fallen from heaven.” Its essence was to win the workers,
agreement to speed themselves up, turn out more work,
and thereby, the B. and O. railroad efficiency experts
promised, -they would automatically reap real advantages
in higher wages and more continuous employment.
32 t

 

 

The 1925 convention of the AFL regarded the plan
as a turning point for the American labor movement.
German Social-Democratic leaders abroad, like Rudolph
Hilferding and Karl Kautsky, tumbled over each other
in praise of the intensiﬁed class collaboration. Inevitably
it depressed the hard-won working condi-tions of labor,
depressed its morale, while the aristocrats wallowed in the
fat salaries of careerism.

The Communists took up the cudgels against these
myths. Its members tirelessly explained the economic facts
of life to their fellow workingmen in the factories; thou-
sands of meetings were held in working class communities
to clarify the issues. Poverty-stricken as they were, they dug
deep into their pockets to bring out leaﬂets, pamphlets,
books, to teach the truth. And Foster’s pen turned out
articles, leaﬂets, pamphlets, and his book M isleaders of La-
bar, in 1927. It was written after his grueling days organiz-
ing, speaking, meeting. Many of those meetings were held
within the ranks of his own party where Foster and his like-
minded associates combatted Wall Street economic shib-
boleths advocated by Jay Lovestone, then a party leader.

As a member of the executive of the Communist In-
ternational and of the Red International of Labor Unions,
Foster helped to shape the Marxist policies refuting these
dangerous myths that were promulgated on a world scale.
Here in America his views won the day in his party, and
shattered the preachments of Lovestone, The latter, treach-
erously vindictive in his reaction, was expelled and
promptly enlisted in the ranks of Marxism’s enemies.
Today Lovestone is the arch—exponent of war against the
Soviet Union, collaborates with the shadowy spy network
of the C.I.A., and plots to disrupt the work of all bona-
ﬁde trade unions abroad that do not truckle to the world
spokesmen of Wall Street.

33

 

  

The Bubble Breaks

No ASPECT or American life and labor was alien to Fos-
ter. Long a protagonist of labor’s independent political
action, he studied -the political scene and waged battle in
this area as well. He became the Communist Party’s ﬁrst
candidate for the presidency in 1924, and again in the
campaign of 1928 and 1932. He stumped the country,
speaking in his plain fashion that is devoid of dramatics,
warning his listeners against the myth of endless pros-
perity, against the blatherings of Coolidge, and against the
Great Engineer Hoover who promised a chicken in every
pot and a car in every garage. Organize your own power,
Foster exhorted, against that day, coming soon, when the
bubble will burst; build your unions, oust your mislead-
ers, organize the unorganized, ﬁght for social and unem-
ployment insurance so that you will not bear the heavy
burdens of the crisis on your own shoulders.

The bubble broke in 1929, as the Communists had
sought to alert the nation, standing alone in the predic-
tion—-a cardinal proof, Foster insisted, that the science of
Marxism surpassed that of all others. In March o-f 1930,
he led the historic demonstration of more than 100,000
unemployed New Yorkers in Union Square.

The peaceable assembly was attacked by thousands
of police armed to the teeth. The ragged men and wom-
en, desperate fathers and mothers, were dispersed by an
unprecedented orgy of ofﬁcial force and violence. Foster
and his delegation chosen by the jobless at the Square-—
Robert Minor, Israel Am-ter, Harry Raymond among them
—turned up a few minutes later at City Hall to present
their program to Mayor Walker for immediate relief from
starvation. The police swooped down and prison fol-
lowed--a term up to three years in the pest-ridden city
prisons of the East River, a veritable Devil's Island of
misery, dope-smuggling, graft and raw inhumanity.

 

 

Released after seven months, as the jobless marched upon
City Halls and state capitals bearing placards with the
slogans for relief and unemployment insurance, he became
the party's banner bearer in the presidential election of
1932, with James W. Ford, the Negro Communist leader,
as his running mate. Despite physical strain after prison
and the long years of incessant activity before, he spoke
at hundreds of meetings to at least ﬁve hundred thousand
Americans nationally. He spoke on the radio, organized
demonstrations, gave newspaper interviews, traveled
scores of thousands of miles by train, auto bus, airplane,
steamboat, wagon and even on foot. And the inevitable
happened: he was stricken with a heart attack in Moline,
Illinois, and for ﬁve months was near death. Full con-
valescence required three years during which time he
dared not make even a ten-minute speech.

But his‘ indomitable will triumphed, and his health im-
proved, stimulated, no doubt, by the successes the counter-
attacking working class was winning. Unemployment in-
surance, espoused by the TUUL in the early twenties,
became the law of -the land in the middle ’thirties. As it
was for the jobless, so it was with the workers on the job.

It is exhilarating to recall, in retrospect, how the slogans
for industrial unionism came to life as the great mass
of workingmen swept into the giant strikes, sit-downs and
massive demonstrations. The Congress of Industrial Or-
ganizations was formed. The impetus of its existence
brought millions, almost overnight, not only into the
CIO but also into the older AFL. Communists were in the
van everywhere as organizers, strike leaders, pickets cap-
tains, and in many an industry, like maritime, steel, auto,
men like Gus Hall, Pat Cush and Bill McKie had laid the
original groundwork for organization of the unions. No
wonder Bill's heart could heal!

35

 

 

Dreiser and Foster

DURING THE TIME of his illness he learned to husband his
powers more cannily than ever. Every minute of his day
was organized to prevent the “leakage” of time. So many
hours for sleep, up early in the morning (6:00 A.M.) to
scan the morning newspapers, then to write a thousand
words on whatever project engaged his mind—an article,
a report, a chapter in a pamphlet or a book. Early in his
years he had revealed a deep, orderly mind, a strong in-
ner discipline which made him organize his days with care
and thought: the old railroadman accustomed to the re-
quirements of a time schedule.

Despite his immersion in the hot day-to—day struggles,
he had continued his readings, his studies, marked off
so much time for this endeavor, so much for that, always
leaving time (time, so precious and so scarce), to the
books he loved: history, the Marxist classics, the current
economic, political and literary writings of the time.
He had become the proletarian leader and intellectual
leader incarnate—the man whose deed was wedded to his
thought. Perfect for him was the Marxist dictum that
practice without theory is blind, theory without practice,
barren. In his own way he had been practicing that all
his life.

Health partly restored, he proceeded to leave his mark
on every poli-tical, economic and theoretical question of
his time. Yet he never lost touch with the daily life of
the American workingman, his advances, his retreats, his
hesitations and confusions. Presidents in the White House
and children of the slums came equally under his scrutiny.
And, if, on his way to his oﬂice to discuss a course of strat-
egy at some critical moment of our nation, he saw the city’s
children sweltering in the torrid summer streets, he
checked that fact in his mind to write, the next morning,
in his thousand-word quota, an article demanding sum-

36

 

\

mer vacations for the offspring of the poor in the country-
side, at municipal expense.

No, not only workingm-en loved him. If this writer
may interpolate a personal experience, he recalls the day
he encountered Theodore Dreiser in the Pennsylvania
coal ﬁelds near Avella during the 1931 strike which Foster
and his TUUL led. The eminent novelist told me, speak-
ing of Foster, that he regarded this Communist leader as
the foremost son of the American working class.

He spoke to me of Foster’s “Christ-like devotion to the
poor and dispossessed,” which he, the novelist, had ob-
served since the great steel strike of 1919. He planned,
some day, he said, to write a novel in which Foster would
be the hero. There is no question that F oster’s example,
his precepts, inﬂuenced the man many regard as the na-
tion’s outstanding novelist -to become a member of the
Communist Party.

War and Its Aftermath

When our nation entered the time of its greatest trial,
the war against fascism, the Communists stood in the fore-
front of all who advocated a total, unyielding effort for
victory. Its spokesmen, like Foster, argued the imperative
need for all-out production to win. It summoned all whom
it could reach in its appeal for an unparalleled national
effort. Fifteen thousand of its members fought in the armed

Robert Thompson, bearer of the Distinguished Service
Cross, and all others on the battleﬁelds. It urged our
nation to mount the Second Front that would cut the

as well as those of our” allies. It argued for close relations
and aid to that ally—the Soviet Union—whose sons were
dying by themillions for the cause of humanity.

Yet this patriot had no illusions about the high-and-

mighty who sat at the controls of that war. He understood,
why the proﬁteers of Wall Street refused to make a “No
Proﬁts” pledge whereas organized labor made and kept its
“No Strike” pledge-

The imperialists of this na_tion who helped Hitler in
his rise to power and had beenhis partner to the day of
Pearl Harbor would not, he knew, change their stripes
once war was won. He foresaw -that men whose concern
for proﬁt is paramount in their lives would plunge wildly
for world domination, try to cut down every obstacle that
stood in their way.‘

He collided head-on with the views of Earl Browder,
then secretary of the party, whose ideas, he insisted, would
lead the Communists into the swamp of opportunism that
had wrecked the old Socialist Party. Foster held that
Browder’s ideas were a rejection of Marxist-Leninist prin-
ciples. No, American capital would not voluntarily im-
prove the standards of life of the American working class
after the war, nor, on the international scene, would it

voluntarily abide by the “generation of peace” agreements’

at Teheran. Big Business, strengthened by the war, would,
on the contrary strive to gobble up world markets, subor-
dinate all other nations if at all possible. That was
the nature of the beast, as he had learned from his Marx-
ism, his Leninism. He acquainted his fellow members
of the National Committee with his views through a letter
which stated them explicitly. Foster bitterly opposed
Browder’s dissolution of the party and its transformation
into a mere educational society.

A party-wide discussion ensued on these ideas. Foster
felt that once they were aired the overwhelming majority
who had studied and lived the ideas of Marxism-Leninism
would see the truth. His stand was almost unanimously
vindicated. The party which was dissolved by Browder
was reconstituted: Browder, ﬁghting his party, was ulti-

38

 

mately expelled, and became an enemy of Marxism.

What Foster foresaw, as he had spoken and had written
in innumerable articles and pamphlets, came to pass: the
world trembled on the brink of another universal war;
this time, the menace of total annihilation hung over all
mankind. Preparation for absolute war has always, under
capitalism, led to the absolute repression of those who
stand for peace. And so, when the cold war settled down
in earnest, Big Business bared its fangs to devour the
rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The Wagner Act
was rescinded and the Taft-Hartley “slave law” took its
place, for ﬁrst and always, labor must be the victim when
the capitalist war hawks go on the rampage. To crush
labor one must begin with the suppression of the Com~
munist Party, a basic law of today’s politics, as Mussolini,
Hitler, T-ojo, Franco proved.

And so Foster, ill, his stout heart strained by years of
illimitable struggle, a victim of the heart disease which
struck in 1932, was arrested and manacled by the thought-
control police of the Smith Act. He was one of the twelve
Communist national committeemen arrested in July of
1948. The trial opened January 17, 1949, bu-t the authori-
ties desisted from bringing the sick man into court, know-
ing, as their doctors had warned them, that he was criti-
cally ill and the siege of trial could well prove fatal to
him. Periodically the doctors of the court examined him,
and still do, for they had hoped to clamp him behind
the same bars that held his fellow-leaders like Eugene Den-
nis, Benjamin J. Davis, Gus Hall, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn
and the many others. ’

A Monumental Task

AND so, IN this time of uncertainty, never. knowing when
the federal marshals would walk in on him in his little
study, in this time of slow and painful recuperation, he

39

 

continued to work. This time, he resolved, he would get
down on paper the basic outline of all working class ideas
and experiences of our age. It is his objective to write
a series of books that would embody the mainstreams of
history, the experiences and principles of the Marxist
movement, here and abroad, the course of trade-unionism,
the history and problems of the Negro people. He planned
to summarize the experiences of the working class so
that any thoughtful workingman would have, within arm's
reach, a basic proletarian education, “to condense,” as he
says, “but not oversimplify fundamental matters that have
great bearing on the worker’s life.”

He set about the monumental task with a zeal and an
application that would do credit to a Marxist sage half
his age and at the summit of his physical power. There is
something titanic in his determination, reminiscent of
Beethoven creating his greatest symphonies after he was
struck deaf, or Milton dictating his epic poetry after
he had gone blind. And, added to Foster's illness, the
police stood at the door. One thinks, too, of Marat, the
Incorruptible, pursued by the Emperor’s armed deputies,
writing his treatises on freedom in the dark alleys of
Paris as a companion held a lantern aloft.

It is a miracle for a man who has recognized no miracles
to have been able, these years of illness and unremitting
strain, to complete the trail-blazing volumes he has writ-
ten, in the past few years, each a major full—length work:
Outline Political History of the Americas, History of the
Communist Party of the U. S., The Negro People in
American History, History of the Three Internationals,
and his latest book, Outline History of the World Trade
Union Movement, to be published on his seventy-ﬁfth
birthday.

One cannot here attempt more than a rough, sketchy
summary of his thought-provoking concepts with which
these books ‘deal, ideas which, even in this time of syste-

40

 

matic repression, of thought-control laws, break through
the iron curtain of silence. His opponents, perforce, take
notice of his ideas for they know, or at least they sus-
pect, that thousands of workingmen and working women
in a hundred factory cities are studying the books of this
man, who, like the Renaissance giants, scrutinizes every-
thing that can speed the ultimate liberation of man.

It is signiﬁcant that the book Six Upon the World,
written in 1954, by the bourgeois scholar and former col-
lege president, Paul F. Douglas, published by Little Brown
and Company, included Fos=ter as one of the six principal
ﬁgures in the land representing the main currents of
thought in America at mid-century. The others Doug-
las described are Paul G. Hoffman, former head of the
Studebaker Corp., Alfred P. Sloan, ]r., chairman of Gen-
eral Motors; Walter P. Reuther, chairman of the CIO;
Francis Cardinal Spellman, chief ﬁgure in the Roman
Catholic Church, and James B. Conant, scientist and for-
mer head of Harvard University, and currently ambassa-
dor to West Germany.

Douglas, dealing with Foster, begins with an apt
allusion, a comparison of the Communist leader to Thor-
eau, the author of Walden, who had gone to jail because
he refused to pay his poll tax at the time of the Mexican-
American war, a crassly imperialis-t enterprise. Thoreau
did not want a single dollar of his to “buy a man or a
musket to shoot one with.” His friend, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, the foremost man of letters of his time, went to
see him in jail and asked, outside Thoreau’s cell, “Henry,
why are you there?” And Thoreau replied, “Ralph, why
are you not here?” And at the moment that Foster related
this story to Douglas, the Communist leader was himself
under a Smith Act indictment, which as Foster put it, “is
a trumped—up charge fabricated by warmongering Wall
Street capitalists.”

The remainder of Douglas’ essay is a summary of Fos-

41

_ ,_,«

 

ter’s life and views as the bourgeois economist understood
them. And concluding, Douglas quotes Foster: “In the
United States the Communist Party works for a people's
government representing a broad coalition made up of the
political and economic organization of the workers, the
Negro, small farmers, intellectuals and other democratic
strata who constitute the great bulk of the American peo-
ple.” Furthermore, he continues, “We are living in a
great historical period, that of the replacement of capi-
talism by socialism. The motive power behind the vast in-
ternational socialist movement is the imperative demand
of the workers for greater freedom and well-being. . . .
World socialism will liberate man from his age-old sla-
very and open up before him a perspective of freedom, de-
velopment, and happiness that he now hardly dreams of.”
It is a heart-warming, optimistic yet scientiﬁc perspective
that Foster presents, one which he has argued in many
pamphlets and books before: you found it far back in his
autobiographic work, From Bryan to Stalin, it appears
more recently in his book, Twilight of World Capitalism,
in fact it runs through everything that deals with his world
outlook.

Theory of Trade Unionism

FOSTER, THE THINKER, who has always been a simultaneous
doer, a leader of men in the dust of daily battle, has
gotten down on paper the- enormous wealth of his ex-
perience as trade union organizer who never regarded a
single aspiration of the working class as secondary or pica-
yune. If it helped the workingman raise his standard of
life by a slice of bread or raised the level of his vision
a fraction of an inch, it was his business. And so no man
in all the history of American labor approaches the breadth
and depth of his writings on the tactics, the strategy and
the basic -theories of trade unionism. He has not only
42

 

been a general on the ﬁeld of battle, he has, like a Clause-
witz in the arts of warfare, generalized his experiences
and those of others.

As I have said, space herein permits of scarcely more
than a brief description or mention of his more than 100
pamphlets and thirteen books. Among the writings on la-
bor questions, his pioneering book, Misleaders of Labor,
written in 1927, was already mentioned. The bookshelves
of thousands of workers still hold his pamphlets on com-
pany unionism and on strike strategy, like The Great Steel
Strike, his book American Trade Unionism, his writings
on Social Democracy, like The Crisis in the Socialist Party.
He has crowned these previous works on trade unionism
with his forthcoming major work, Outline History of the
World Trade Union Movement.

Illustrative of his thinking is the excerpt from this book
printed under the title “The General Law of Trade
Union Progress” in the July 1955 issue of Political A ﬁairs,
the monthly organ of the Communist Party, to which he
contributes virtually in every issue. In it he reveals a
profundity of approach to the study of trade unions which
is unequalled in American labo-r literature. One cannot
compare, one can only contrast, the thoughts in this work
with the ideas of men like Samuel Gompers, or Philip
Murray or John L. Lewis or any other renowned leader of
labor.

Scientiﬁcally, he demonstrates that the trade union
movement has speciﬁc laws of its own. “With some 140,-
000,000 members throughout the world and over two cen-
turies behind it, the movement has not grown and does
not function haphazardly. Unions are born, advance and
decline according to ascertainable principles or laws.”
He analyzes the reasons for their stormy, swift advance at
certain historic periods and why, at other times, “they
have expanded at a snai1’s pace, or even retrogressed.”
He charts the basic currents of the modern labor move-

43

 

men-t, probing their origins and outlines their inﬂuences.
Roughly, he groups these trends as Right Social Democracy,
Anarchism, Syndicalism and Communism. He describes
why the Right-wing Social Democrats have always based
themselves “upon a minimum of class struggle,” explores
the underlying forces that compel them to lead move-
ments of struggle “which they head only to behead.”
The Anarchist trend ignores the current urgent tasks of
day-to-day demands, struggles and organizations, relying
fundamentally upon “the spontaneous action of the
masses”; the Anarcho-Syndicalists have the same weak-
ness, “an over-reliance upon the spontaneity of the work-
ing class,” regarding the general strike as the “cure-all”
to be achieved by “arbitrary manifestos.” The Commu-
nists alone have shown themselves to be the best day-to-
day builders and ﬁghters in both phases of the trade union
process, the periods of relative calm, as well as during
periods of “the periodic expressions of high working
class spontaneity of ﬁghting spirit.” And he exhorts all
militant unionists to acquire a working knowledge of
the general law of trade union progress so that they will
more effectively work “during those calmer times when
the working class makes only a slow evolutionary advance
and during the militant upheavals when it makes revo-
lutionary leaps ahead.”

In his article, “Marxism and the Labor Movement,”
in Political Aﬁairs (November 1953), he proves that the
Marxists in America played a central part in helping
America's trade unions advance in the following areas:
the organization of the unorganized, the Negro-white-
labor alliance, governmental social insurance, trade union
democracy and an honest labor leadership, and labor’s
independent political action. True, he shows that the
road is long and these advances are but beginnings, but
they are signal advances compared with the past. The
spiral is distinctly upward.

44

 

And in this day when the historic merger of the
AFL and the CIO will create a single labor organization
of more than ﬁfteen million it is necessary to recall Fos-
ter's tireless and unceasing crusading for labor unity which,
years ago, focused national attention on the need. In his
book American Trade Unionism he proves—and it would
be well for all in labor to realize it—that the key to trade
union success in this country has always been the coop-
eration between the left and the middle-of-the-road forces,
and that the prime object of red-baiting is to break that
united front.

His writings on labor and his histories of American
Communism and of the world Socialist and Communist
movements crown the thinking of this American theoreti-
cian who began to grapple with the troublesome ques-
tions facing the American workers from his early years
as an organizer.

He never lost that deep sense of working class reality,
which he expressed so admirably in his autobiographical
Pages From a Worker’s Life, published in 1938, a book
unique in American labor. By every canon it belongs
to the category of permanent literature. He recounted
his experiences, in the form of sketches and stories, from
childhood on, through his years on the seas, his “hobo”
days, his organizing. Dominating this book is love for his
class, for his nation. Characters emerge in a few swift
strokes that enable you to understand, through his eyes,
why it is rational to retain through thick and thin a su-
preme faith in the working class. Yet the workers of his
pages are not gloriﬁed, unreal with attributes beyond their
time. They stand there in their strength and in the weak-
nesses of their day. The book is a masterpiece of observa-
tion, for the man has the eye for detail that is the portend
of the creative writer. Even H. L. Mencken, certainly no
friend of labor, praised Foster's craftsmanship.

45

 

Fountainhead of Ideas

BECAUSE HIS EYE is focused always on the needs of the
workingman, Foster has probed into every subject related
to his welfare and the destiny of his class. Hence he avidly
studies the latest developments in bourgeois economics.
Years ago he sounded the alarm against the theories and
practices of Keynesism which he described as “capitalist
economics in the period of the decline of world capital-
ism." Forever a dogged champion of the truth as he
sees it he exhorts Marxist economists the world over to
expose the erroneous and dangerous fallacies of the
Keynesian “Ponzi-like” schemes whereby all capitalist
countries hope to “combat” economic depressions in the
future. But Keynesism, Foster contends in abundant ar-
gument and documentation, cannot overcome the inner
contradictions of capitalism that gnaw at the Vitals of the
system, and he returns. again and again to the subject to
show, using the example of various government and cor-
poration economic programs in this country, that Keynes-
ism is indeed the doctrine of state monopoly capitalism
in the period of its decline.

It is doubtless not at all accidental that the man who
ﬁrst organized Negroes in a mass production industry
has written a classic work on the Negro question which
has been studied by prominent Negro commentators and
scholars. J. A. Rogers, in the leading Negro newspaper,
the Pittsburgh Courier, regarded it as “one of the most
scholarly, factual and comprehensive works on that sub-
ject.” Others agree with Rayford W. Logan of Howard
University, who writes in the Iournal of Southern History
that the book “cannot be summarily dismissed because it
is written by the former candidate for President on the
Communist ticket.” But the reviewers. in that land where
racism has been abolished, in the U.S.S.R., gave the book
unequivocal praise. International Aﬁairs, a journal pub-

‘ 46>.

 

lished in the English language, says: “For the ﬁrst time,
a scientiﬁc treatise, presenting the history of the Negro
people since their ﬁrst forcible importation into the U.S.A.
up to the present from a Marxist-Leninist standpoint,
has become available . . . it is a noteworthy contribution to
Marxist literature on the national question.”

Foster’s Outline Political History of the Americas, like
his other boo-ks, has been translated and published abroad
—in Hungary (1951), Czechoslovakia (1952), Japan and
the Soviet Union (1953), Romania (1954), Bulgaria
(1955), and is being translated currently in Italy and the
German Democratic Republic. A lengthy review in the
Communist, the organ of the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union said Foster’s book “is an outstanding study
of the history of the peoples in the Western hemisphere.”
It called attention to his main thesis that “the several
American revolutions in North and Latin America for
independence were but so many segments of one general
movement. The heart of this great movement was a revo-
lutionary attack against the feudal system. It was the
broad, all-American bourgeois, i.e., capitalist revolution."

And as these books come rolling off the presses of Inter-
national Publishers, Foster continues to wrte articles that
throw light on current matters, the Geneva conference,
for example, or the latest developments on the labor front,
or answering the question no few ask, “Is the U.S. in the

E Early Stages of FascismP,” or on such momentous topics

as “Sectarianism in the Fight Against White Chauvinism.”
The man is inexhaustible despite the precarious condi-
tion of his health, a veritable fountainhead of ideas!

So BRIEFLY, THESE ARE a few of the highlights in the life
of this man who had devoted sixty of his seventy-ﬁve years
to the American working class. Unique in the annals of

American history, it is clear why so many regard him as
one of the great ﬁgures of our time.

He celebrates three-quarters of a century’s stormy yet
abundantly fruitful life as his latest book, Outline History
of the World Trade Union Movement, comes from the
press.

What a pageant of mankind’s ‘genius he has seen, and to
which he has added! What an epic his own life is! Well
over a third of humanity has marched from the Kingdom
of Necessity into the Realm of Freedom, as Engels foresaw,
writing these words when Foster was a child in “Ski-
tereen,” the slums of Philadelphia. His is the time of the
turning point, the era when man is passing from pre-his-
tory, as Engels called all times before man's full libera-
tion, into Socialism. And the son of a poor Irish carriage-
washer not only saw these marvels, he is helping to create
them.

Imbued with a love for life that has survived an in-
ﬁnity of hazards, he pursues the s-ole ambition that moti-
vates his stormy Odyssey: the day when all men will live
as -brothers, enjoying the fruits of their labor in a world
forever at peace.

Truly, here is the happy warrior. As he himself has writ-
ten in The Twilight of World Capitalism, “My life in

the labor, left-wing and Communist movement has been

a very happy one. It has given me the opportunity to do
the thing closest to my heart and mind—to ﬁght for pro-
gressive socialism. From my earliest youth I have always
felt a great pride in being a worker, and it has ever been
a matter of the deepest" satisfaction to me to be able to
identify myself so closely with the struggles of the work-
ing class. If I were starting my life all over again, I would
take the same course as I have done. . . .”

OUTLINE HISTORY OF TRE
WORLD TRADE UNION MOVEMENT

By WILLIAM Z. FOSTER is

THIS NEW BOOK, -to appear on Fosterfs 75th birthday in February,

is a full-length study of the international .trade union movement. He
traces the growth of trade unionism from its birth in England in the

latter part of the 18th century to the present day—in the colonial world
and semi-dependent countries, as well as in the developed capitalist
lands. He also discusses the trade unions in the Soviet Union, China,
and the new European—democracie.s. This latest book from Foster’s pen
is a summation of his life-long experience as a labor leader and of
his constant observation and study.

FOR WORD

THIS IS THE story of an American whose life spans almost
half the years since our nation became a Republic. Wil-
liam Z. Foster will be 75 years old, February 25, 1956.
His years and achievements embody much of the history
of American labor on which he has made an indelible
imprint. He is the foremost Communist in America.
The members of his party revere him as patriot, leader
and exemplar of the power inherent in the working class
into which he was born and to which he has devoted his
life since the age of 14 when he participated in his ﬁrst
strike. '

Americans could well examine his life and see for
themselves the stuff of a Communist. It is wise, for serious
people, to go to original sources regarding the truth about
Communists and about Communism. This man, engaged
all his years as a labor and political leader, has put
down his ideas, his experiences, his theoretical conclu-
sions in thirteen books and in more than a hundred
pamphlets. The words that follow, in this booklet, are
written in commemoration of his seventy—ﬁfth anniversary
and in appreciation of the man and his work.

WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

An Appreciation
Child of ‘Skitereeln’

THREE YEARS AFTER the Civil War ended, James Foster,

a tall, blue-eyed, immigrant born of peasant stock int

County Carlow, Ireland, arrived in the United States and
settled in Boston. Alert, combative, and yet virtually
illiterate, he was a young man with an old dream. The
Irishman ﬂed his native land because he loved Ireland
well, so well that the Crown’s armed emissaries trailed
him after a projected revolt to win Irish independence
had failed. /

The Fenian brought his wife Elizabeth, a tall, slender
yet hardy woman of English and Scottish ancestry, a weav-
er whose young years were spent in the clatter of Britain’s
textile industry. She bore him twenty-three children.

Jim Foster was known as a ﬁghting Irishman, forever
ready to jump to the defense of the Ould Sod and his
Catholic faith, but he could take his religion or leave
it. Elizabeth, however, earnestly upheld the Faith.
Eighteen of her children failed to survive to maturity.
One of those who did, William, was the apple of her
eye. Frustrated in this life she was determined that this
son would become a priest of the more promising exist-
ence to come.

Theirs was the typical immigrant’s life of gaslit Amer-
ica. Bounded by the deserts of illiteracy and the peaceful
