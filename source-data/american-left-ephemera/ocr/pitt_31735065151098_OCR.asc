_ By JOHN CLARK-
r 1 ~ . , "Iva ,
' 1 HE MINE-MILL Executive Board at its last
meeting acted to place before the entire member-

 ship a referendum vote on_ two big questions: first, wheth-
er to raise our International"per capita by 25 cents a
; month, and second, whether to set afloor "of $2.50 for all

local union dues. ' - *

. There is, of course, going to_be debate among our
_ ‘members over the pros and cons of these proposals. That

i.s right in line with the_tradition in our union of arguing

over every major issue among ourselves before We cﬁst 
our vote in secret ballot. I m always proud to note t at
* ours 1S one of the very

few unions left who still stick

.; -to the democratic principle of secret-ballotreferendum.

By the time we vote January.12, I’m sure every
member will have a clear understanding of the two issues

' e -—per capita and dues. We in the International office

are trying to get out all the facts and information you
need ‘to make your decision intelligently.

Key issues

.-N THE AREA CONFERENCES we’ve gem in recent

~“.We€kS, the delegates have centered their attention on
.-three key issues: organizing, bargaining,‘ and defense of » _
A the union. All three of these furnish major reasons why A

our members should v-ote “yes” in the referendum. do

It’s no secret to anyone that the costof running a
ears. So has
the cost of operating the International _ nion.‘ V '
believe any other union covers more territory than Mine-

. Mi-ll or organizes in more far-flung’places than we
' do.

Our “spread out” diurisdiction means greatly added

costs for organizing an for servicing.

Organizing

AKE FOR EXAMPLE, the new locals that have been
organized in uranium and other 'metal fields in far north-
ern Canada—\-reaching all the way from.tl_ie shores of
Hudson Bay’ to Alaska. Now we are movin into thg
zinc an

fseem important, at first glance, to the worker, say, -in

- Montana. But if you think about it, you realize that the

=more non-ferrous metal workers we organize into Mine-
Mill, the‘-more we strengthen our bargaining power every-

where. ' Organizing and bargaining are _like corned beef . 

-and cabbage — they can’t be separated.
Wage gains

a E CAN BOAST of bigger wage .ains for our mem-
7-loers than-» almostany other union. ur wage increases
since 1950, for example, are way ahead of those for work-
ers in the steel industry. Mine-Mill wage gains this past

C “year ‘were made while the CIO Auto and other unions

'7 - tried throwing the Taft-Hartley,Act at, us.

 

E This is THE‘ Fl

were willingly taking wage cuts. ' ~
We believe this nation can achieve economic stabil-
ity only by constantly raising the buying power of its
workers. Cuts inbuying power -—‘ wage cuts —‘— can lead
only to depression. _ ' ~ '
* But we have reached the point where our local unions
must have more dues income andour International Union
must have more per capita income, if we areito continue

_ making wage and other contract gains and if we are to .

‘keep on organizing toward our goal of .complete jurisdic-
tion over this industry. I - T

The big reason 
I THINK ALL,our members understand by now the

big reason for the attacks both on our union and on its
leaders. We’re just too successful at the bargaining table

to suit the metal corporation owners. The employers’ union -

——American Mining Congress ——makes no secret of the
fact it is out to bring our gains to a halt. ‘

v Using the normal means, they found it impossible to
buck the united strength of our membership. So they
That didn’t_
do the trick, so they moved on to their supreme effort
-—-the Brownell-Butler act. Mining Congress lawyers

wrote one of thefirst drafts of the Brownell-Butler law.

They hope ‘to ~ divide us

THROUGH THIS LAW they hope to divide our unity
as a union. .

Through hysteria, stoolpigeons and_ witchhunting,
they hope to weaken our bargaining power. _
3 Through a hostile Attorney General, they intend to
still the voices not only of International leaders but of
local -union leaders, tligvoices which today demand higher
wages, better working conditions, improved welfare for

the families" of metal workers.

These things go—-toget_her‘-—- the “fight for better
—wages and conditions, the fight to organize all workers
T in the industry, the fight to defend our union and all

" ~ labor against laws which are meant to destroy unionism.

All of us 7,

so it eon continue to do a [ob foryou. , -.

It you and every other Mine-Mill brother paid another two bits a
month in er capita—as proposed in the January l2 referen,dum—-
here's what it would do: I i "  _ I A

I 0 Make sure your union has enough muscle to drive through all

the tough obstacles we know the metal companies plan to throw our

4 way, In next year‘: wage and, contract campaign.

0 Step. up thedrives to bring our kind of fightinglunlonism to metal
workers wherever they are—especially in Canada and the U. 5.
Southwest, . I - ‘ . ' I "

0 Enable your; union to'|oin the rest‘ of the labor movement in all C
offensive aimed at reversing the anti-union trend started in both
the U. S. and Canada seven years ago. ,

Maybe you don't know how much the expenses of your/own local
union have gone up these last few years. Make a spot check of 14
items of office supply every local uses—things like pencils.‘ letter-

"heads. envelopes. They cost $75.51 in 1947. ‘Today they come to

$ll0.58; '

International Union costs have tlumped the same way.‘ Transporta-
tion which came to 396.000 in l947. is running at an annual rate of
$126,000 in 1954. Printing the H53 Convention Proceedings cost

‘$4.737 as against $3.734 for the 1952 Convention Proceedings. , ~

,_ So lt,goes. Everything is higher. Economize? Stick to the essentials?" .
If you don't think there's a limit to how mu\ch economlzing can be
’ ~ done”. ask youriwife. ‘ s I ‘ s ‘ «

The 25 cent at month per capita incregse would mean $3 a year more
out of your pocket—-=to help make your union stronger than ever,

Since 1950. your union has won for the average Mine-Mill member
46 cents an hour. or $956.80 a year. plus pensions. health and wel-

fare benefits. holidays and all the other fringes. That's lust one way . .

of measuring how much your union means tosyougdnd your family.

  W/II] \)-afiae -t/re 'f/voI-.7 .:  

You may say-l—'iOkay. I'm sold." I'll vote for the per capita increase
But why raise the niinimum local union dues... to $2.50?‘ » -

because many Mine-Mill‘locals need  -dues increase lust as badly
as the International needs a per capita hike. The minimum dues un-
der the Mine-Mill Constitution right now is $l—-the same amount as

I per capita. \ V 4
There are 78 local unions with duesof two bucks a month tori."

less. When per capita goes up two bits. these locals just won't be
able to scrape along on their low dues any_ longer. "They'll need

L higher dues if /they,are to keep on doing a good’ iob fontheir members. ‘

' Monthly dues of two-fifty compares with a $3 minimum in the CIO

Steelworkers. $4 in the CIO Rubberworkers. $3 in -the Communica-
tions-union. $2.50 in CIO Auto.  < . ‘ .

This then is what the coming 2-point re-_Fwerendum boils down’ to. By C. It

voting "YES". on both questions. you voteto arm your ‘union with

urgently neededw’eapons. so it can stride forth confidently into bat-‘H    I

With a lot of enthusiasm, the Montana leadership

by International President John

dent Clark followed up with
this: ' ‘

meetings, the delegates gave

seriouslconsideration to the im-

, act,-of the anti-labor-Brownell-

/‘ ? - And,’ like the delegates in

earlier conferences, they came

to the conclusion that they

,would have to ﬁght the law, mo-
ftivated by self-preserva-tion‘: _<

“VICE - PRESIDENT Orville

compromised in its opposition to
a bad law. And it has shown
tolerance in,.other things, too—-

'like the fight for peace, for

world trade, the right of min-

7 ority believers to hold union

office.

MINE-MILL no longer is the
only group under attack. The
enemies of American democracy

want to suppress ALL‘ dissent.’

They have to keep moving onto
another and another and an-
other group, until everyone «in
the country thinks alike. Though
it is ostensibly directed at labor
unions, in the end the entire
American people will pay the

penalty of this kind of legisla- '

tion.” ,

Larson voiced the sentiments of .

the delegates when he said “We

to the American Mining Con-

boasting of. how the mining

to other Mine-Mill conferences

and reported in The MINE-

-‘ '_, " . International Vice President ‘ V
 TI‘IERE’S’a lot of talk about laboi; unity ‘
"these days and Awe’re,al1 for it. Not
;.’* because‘ we, just like to hear “talk ,but be-
t ‘ﬁcause discussion-——when enough people
I", join in—usually helps to clear up things
 and we -sure’ need a. lot of. clarity on this
fwhole issue of unity in the labor_ move-
 iment. '
  The way some newspapers report "it
  ’you’d think all thereis,to~this labor unity
  is for a. fewrunion big shots to pose for
" ‘~22-j :<pic‘tu«res;f have a 
 ‘~“f ﬁfe w Adrinks ’ to-
 «gether, and then

  That isn’t what
unity means to
‘ workers. Unity, to

 

 

 
  

 

_VVa worker, means i
getting together

° :" with other work-
?  ers so i as .to be
able .to present‘ a

‘.;  stronger front to e
" _ the bosses. It means working and fighting
;together for ‘a better ideal——-for higher
fwages and- better conditions, for more ef-

 

 fective political -action, and for an end to 

Taft-Hartley and Bro”w'ne1l=V_But1er."- ‘

_ No secret . . V
V HERE’S no secret aboutAany of this.
. ., Unity is why workers join unions in
 the first’ place./They know that, alone,
they’re helpless against the vast economic
«pow,’er of modern corporations. .
_ V IN THESE DAYS of monopoly.\;control
_VAwVgV' -—as in the non—ferrous metals \,industry—-V
;_ . it’s not enough to be able to unite with
 workers in the safne mine or plant; The
V Vlocal plant manager, as any negotiating
 ‘committee member can tell you, is usually
 eno.—more than an errand boyfor the corp-
_ “ " oration. If you-want to bargain. effectively
“ witl_1*a corporation you have to be_ able ‘to’
 be-1-gain for all workers in all operations
of the corporation. . 'i _ _
And then because all corporations in

 - ‘this industry work together on their labor’?

_ policy,.wo.rkers, too, have to unite with all

 ot‘he1' workers in,-the industry to be able

to counter the united strategy of the
corporations. ’ . A

A Yardsfick . , _ V A -
‘V -. THIS is the ABC of modern unionism.
f  3 — This also gives usan easy yardstick by -
which we can measure any’proposal for
labor unity. Our yardstick is simply this-
_ will this or that proposal bring. more or.
V _ less worke_rs togetherin jointiaction for
.; theircoinmon interests? . .1 7 3 ‘ , J
 IT’S A YARDSTICK we can’t afford to
lose, si'gh..‘C of 2th.ese days. For real unit'y.——
‘not the cheap imitations that some dues-
. hungry pie cards are". peddling-——is some-'-
, *t‘hin_9; we’ could all use a lot more of. .
d When I say “we” I mean also those of
us in h’Iine-Mill. Our union, despite raids,
is the dominant union in the industry. We .
have the vast majority of non.-.ferrou.s
_ ‘-workers inlour ranks. -We set th.eVba1'ga.in-
 ing pattern every year-—al pattern that ‘
«Aotlienunions, at best, can only hope to
follow. ' _ . » A .

 mad to 1-ml unity

ferrous workers outside of Mine-Mill, split‘

up into a.host of isolated locals among 20

or more Internatidnals, hurts all non-fer-.

rous- worl<e1;s——including those in Mine-

Utah Kargalning ‘ V i ,
AKE _'jl1SVt one‘ example——what happened

‘ in Utah this year. . _
,\ After our outstanding victory at Ken-
necott, ‘Steelworkers locals at Kennecott
and A. S. & R. went into bargaining. What

were their demands ?_ They. wanted, ac-s »

'. cording to the’ papers‘ “what Mine-Mill

had settled for.” , -

a "In order to get that, they were forced
into a four and a "half week strike,‘ went
back to work without; anything and then,
after further weeks ‘of hearings before a
Conciliation panel, were able to achieve
settlements that just about approximated
ours. ‘ A

T’ The obvious moral to this story is that
the Steelworkers locals could have gotten
their; settlenient-—.-without a strike--if,
even. while they insisted upon paying dues

A ‘to VP_ittsbu”rgh, they had worked out a

comnron bargaining program with Mine-
Mill. " _ . V V  it A ‘ 
 ‘ . ” . Could. be"be_ﬂ-er

T}lAT’S the obvious; point. The-re’s 8. lot
. more to this that may not be so obvious.

~ ‘ ~.If-.Steelworl~:ers and MineeMill locals

in Kennecott, for example, had bargained
together fora commonA‘program we think
that not onlythe St_eelWork’ers strike-% but.
possibly even .Mine-Mill’s shortenstrike
might have been avoided and the final
settlement, for all .Kennecott Workers,
could’ have been. better.‘, Joint bargaining

would have told the coinpany-—in unm_is- ‘
‘ takable terms——that tV'he'y could no longer
play off one union against the other andg

all workers wmouvld have gained t_hereby. 
_g_THAT’S WHAT wemean when We say-

unity ”pay7sV’ off for the Viworkers. eTha,t’s " A
» what we in Mine-Mill have been working
A for.‘throughout‘,th‘e "industry. ‘ "

V Anaconda workers,AAwhether in Mine-
Mill or any one of many AFL unions, know
that the’ pension plan wonithis year-——.the

rous ‘workers. To all offthem ‘we say——.

V regardless‘ of where you pay your dues or

who your leaders may be, let’s work to-‘

gether on getting‘ a better deal for all the’
.-worker's in this industry; A . A » A A »V
THIS IS THE ROAD to. real unity ‘in,’

this i'ndustry,——to one organization for all
wonlgers in the industry. We don’t insist
that the only way for. that _to happen is
by al‘l‘other workers joining Mine-Mill;.._We

do insist, though, that whatever way is,

‘followed, it be one in which all workers in
‘-th e_V industry, without‘ q‘u'alification., deter-
mine their own leader‘sh.ip, their own affil-
iation and their own policies. V_ ,
But today, while these’ other methods
are being considered-—and we ‘think they’

NEWARK, N. J .-—-Here
in another: example of .
how far the NLRB has
gone, down‘ the road to-
ward bankruptcy as a la-
bor board.

The AFL Jewelry &
Novelty Workers ‘union-”
has been raiding Mine-
_Mill‘ Local 628 at the
American Platiurn W o_rk-
"ers here for some time;
The raiders petitioned for
an election, apparently "
filing their‘ ‘petition with '
the Board-in secret. ' _ A"

The NLRB obligingly
«c’a'lle'd ‘for’ a V hearing on
the petition——-without‘ no- I ‘
tifying Mine-Mill,’ e v en
though Mine-Mill.+is the
union with the contract 
in the plant! ‘The hearing
Awas set'for October 11,";
and Mine-Mill’leade’rs only
found out about it on the; .
8th. ' . ‘ V " . _
'iWhen- Mine-Mi-ll offi-
cia_ls_ called the Board to
protest against, the fact
that a hearing‘ was called .
without notifying our un- . 1
ion, the Board still re-_
fused to ca.ll_‘the hearing .V

THE future -stability of‘ non-ferrous metals remains a trouble-

’ some question as we approach the end__of 1954.

This past year?/in" terms of prices and scales-ihas proven to

be better than most. observers predicted. Much of the improvement v

———as in lead and zinc, for example-—'can be attributed to emergency

’-measures such as the stepped-up government " buying proigram

which helped remove surpluses from the mark/ets. Improve Euro-
pean, demand also-relieved pressure on U. S. ma1‘kets,.\‘_ A ‘ .
“The continued gbasic instability of these‘mai‘kets'}s‘._shown ’
the factthat useof lead and zinc in the U.S. is below last Yel}1‘,5-
STOCKPILING, it is generally recognized, -has given. only
temporary relief. It. has not, for example, put more than 9- VBTY
few marginal mines back into production. ‘

Government decisions next year will again seriously "affect the

future ‘of many non-ferrous metals. High on“ the list of subjects
on which dq,-isions will have to be reached are: _ h '

_ 1. whether to continue the stepped-up buying program beyond
June 1955; s _ . 

2. subsidies for marginal mines; « .

3. tariffs; _ _ -.  e

4. such other issues as public works,- slum clearance, farm
subsidies, foreign trade, unemployment insurance —- ‘all of which
bear on the general economic situation and substantially‘ affect the
kind of markets» available‘ for metals. . T J’  .

ONE THING IS CL-EAR: Mine-Mill’s Job S./ecurity Program
for the non-ferrous metals industry is as necessary now as when
it was first adopted three years ago. Mine-Mill members will have
1. job on their hands to‘ make that program known to their Senators
and Congressmen. I — A \ « _, .

Here are some recent trends pointing up the ‘problems that

 fcopipnn  . .   

tight supply situation might indicate. . _’ . - .
There is little danger as of now that the price will soon drop
from the 30-cent level.-With only a few companies controlling the

industry, that i-sn’t very likely. ~'-_ - i

What is possible is that——as happened earlier this year-—these
companies will try to meet the problem of excess supply by cutting
back production and laying off workers in order to hold prices up.

DURING THELLAST YEAR, five new major copger projects
(not counting’ the Greater Butte project which expan’ ed output)-
came into operation. In '55, four morenew operations will start up,
and in ’56 the giant San Manuel operation, with expected produc-
tion of 70,000 tons per year, will be going strong.

LEAD am] znvci

In lead and zinc, recently released figures show that the price-
increases which have taken place cannot be attributed ‘to improved
demand. Use of both; of these metals in the U.S._ declined in the

A .first nine months of 1954 as compared with last] year.

Total use of lead fell 09%. Use of zinc suffered an even greater
decline in the same period-—a drop of 1-7 %.' ‘ ' 1

\ FORTUNATELY, im'ports dropped even more during the same

period—-lead by 37%% and zinc by 23%. The greater vuse-ofmejtals.

abroad relieved pressure on U. S. producers: Should the Aupwardr

trend in European industrial production reverse«.itself, the pressure

of imports would again fall heavily on U.S.-markets.

 At the moment, all~iion-ferrous metals. are. enjoying a rela-
tively healthy position, but‘ as. the above facts show, -there are .

danger signs ahead. We still have the very basic probleinr of being
‘ able to produce more than we now sell. In sh0rt5-unless our_ country

 ‘C0-existence or

Eco-annihilation’

“If we cannot achieve

co-existence (with people of

y .2 _ other ideologies), we may achieve co-annihilation.” This

warning was given by Dr. Hugh Keenleyside,,no_ted Cana- V’
dian economist and‘ Director of'Techn1cal Assistance 1n

" the U. N. Administration to a conference arranged by the

Social Service Council of

the Toronto Anglican Diocese.

The U. N. Director, who was summing up a panel

discussion of the impact of atomic energy upon human-

society before a packed audience at-. Grace‘ Church on

the Hill, here, emphasized that
“we are living in a dangerous
age though in on; in which
there are unparalleled opportu-

nities for good. We
achieved, or are about to
achieveﬁgthe power of self-de-
- struction. While “there have been
tremendous scientific changes
within our times, there have
been no corresponding moral
developments nor adaptations

for social purposes of what we

have learned. A

“It is. paradoxical that we
have come to the possession of
such tremendous power and to

. the growing recognition of‘ the
inequalities of happiness and’
comforts that exist in this world

. at the same time. Unless.some-
thing is done about these in-
equalities, we have a continuing

source of war, something the
world cannot afford. ,

“We cannot go on,‘ leaving: to
individual nations control over
war or peace. We must come to
international acceptance of this
fact, and we mustﬁmake meme

’ bers of our governments aware

of it.” '

technical advisor to the Cana-
'dian government both during
. the war against fascism and. in
the post war period, received-
considerable publicity. some two
years ago when herefuse to

  Smit  presents  brief to Yukon Council 

O N Friday, November 5,’jour
union made its first represen-
tation to the Yukon Territorial
Council dealing with matters of
interest to ou_r membership in

‘ H.  the Yukon Territory.

This session of the Yukon
Council is dealing with the con-
solidation of ordinances, some-
thing that has not been done
for approximately fifty years.

One of the main problems of
our membership in the Yukon
has been the enforcement of the
legislation already on the stay
tute books and in reply to the
speech from the throne Mr. F. ‘D.
Locke, representative for White-
horse, drew attention to " this A
weakness when he said that the
Council could sit forweeks and
pass laws, but they would be

useless unless thérewas some

‘ . method of _enforcement.

. A _ iwant self-government

 

The union brief "emphasized
that the people of the Yukon
Territory want to be governed
by an elected government re-_
sponsible to and to act on be-
half of the people of the Yukon,
rather than remain ‘as wards
of the Federal government.

The_ brief drew attention to
the vast industrial expansion
that has taken place in the past
few years in the Yukon Terri-
tory, and the continued expan-
sion that is anticipated, and

pointed to the need for legisla-

‘tion to take care of thehneeds of
the workers who wouldicome. to

, When the invoking of Bill-19’
(so called anti-communist meas-

ure) against the AFL‘ union",

failed to shake the unity of
plumbers in this area, the Que-,
bec Premier, rather than‘ put
his anti-union law to a test,

stepped into the dispute and ef-

fected an agreement that was

6 cents better than the Concilia-

tion Board Award rejected by

the employers. The stirring vic-

Seasonal workers 1 .

The Council was asked to
raise its voice in support of ‘the
union’s contentiona‘ that special
.coi1sideration should be given to
members of our union who are
in seasonal employment, partic-

I

". ularly in our Dawson local who

are deprived of the benefits of
unemployment insurance when
laid off at the end of a season
although theyhave the number‘
of shifts worked required under
the regulations. 1

The union proposed that the
maximum “limitation for the
purpose of computing compen-
sation be increased from $3000

I"..-

per year to $4500 per year and
that widows’ pensions be in-
creased from $50.00 to $100.00
and additional consideration
given to dependent orphans. ‘
Silicosis

It was also proposed that the
discriminatory section on ‘sili- '
“cosis which places the onus on
thevworkmen to prove disability
should ‘be removed and that
silicosis should be determined
by‘ scientific processes.»

Opposition was also regis-
tered to the position that .a man
must have’ been exposed; to

‘Ken Smith speaks A _ . F
Ken Smith, who presented the
~brief for eth. union, told _the/
Co.uncil ofltho =caso~of a man
'--who although everyone admits
- is dying of silicosis but who, by
virtue of this section in the Acts
of :’the‘ various provinces and
Territories is statutory «barred,
although he has in his lifetime
been exposed to silica. dust
while in the employ of one
company. A O 
Mr. Smith said that this man .
worked 18 months for the Con- ii
solidated Mining, and Smelting
‘Company ‘ at Goldfields, Sas-
katchewan and another, 18
,months for the same conipany
at Pinchl Lake, British‘Colum-
bia. " . ' ' .1 '
Mr. Smith -suggested 0 that
there should be some reciprocal
agreement between the . prov-
inces to take care of such situ-
ations and the least that should
be established is for the referee
to have discriminatory power to
allow a claim when in justice he
feels it should be: allowed.

Safety

The Councilwas asked to in-
troduce legislation that,..would
compel thegsetting up of safety-
first committees in all industrial
undertakings and that investiga-
tion be made with regard to es-
tablishing special ‘rules to suit
in various operations.

Charles (Chuck) Ravenhill,

 union-busting 

TORONTO, Ont.—Comes now
the proof in this Great Lakes
port that bosses and govern-
ments don’t unite to aid raids
on unions because they are
“Communist dominated,” but be-
cause they don’t Want any
union.

Five years ago Hal Banks, a
lieutenant of Harry Lundeberg,
was imported to Canada by
shipowners, with the blessing
of the government, to “bust up

‘ the Canadian Seamen’s Union,

and replace ‘it with the self-
styled “anti—communist” Sea-
farers lnteignational Union. He

was hailed as a ,knight—errvant.

by every ‘paper around the
Great Lakes, including. the or-
gantéof Big Business, the Finan-
cial Post.

‘BUT IN THE ISSUE_ of Oct.
16 the Post headlines another

full-page ‘story:__, “Hal Banks: .

White Knight on a Cadillac.”
The theme? District 50 is now
conducting a raid on the SIU
on the Great ‘Lakes, and the
Post is doing all it can to pave
the way. u .

‘They are telling all the things

the Coroi1er’s Act that would
require workmen actually. fa-
miliar with the type‘ of work
being done be placed on all in-
quest injuries inquiring into in-
dustrial fatalitiesifand that the
union be notified -‘of the time
and place of such inquest so,‘
that the representative of_ the

' workmen could be present with

the right to examine witnesses.

Vacations ‘‘ l 4 ‘

The brief took the Yukon Ter-
ritorial Council totask for’at_-
tempting to upset the position
taken by the union regarding

’ annual vacations during the ne-

gotiations ewith \ United Keno
Hill Mines, by introducing an

amendment at the last’ session

‘of the _Coun'.cil interpreting
basic pay, and pointed [out that
under the Territorial "Council’s
own Inteiqaretation Ordinance .
the courts were the proper place
to have such interpretation
made and proposed at this time
that’ the- Council’ should have
the ordinance "stated in the
court for interpretation. ‘

 Frank McIntosh, president of

Local 924 at Keno Hill, advised
the board it was the desire of
Mine Mill Membership that a
Workmen’s Compensation, Board

— should‘ be established for the
'Yukon, to take compensation
