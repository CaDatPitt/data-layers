“At   Last.”

expression to Communism in this
country.

The Communist Party, from the
very beginning of its existence, found
its work hampered because it had in
its ranks only a few men capable- of
expressing Communist principles in
the English language. There was a
powerful party organization made up
of the language groups,‘ ready to
serve as the driving force, but this
force could not be given full express-
ion because the medium for such
expression did not exist in the party.

The unity achieved during the
recent convention is unity between
the most aggressive and active
members of the language groups -
those elements which place the op-
portunity to work for Communist
principles above loyalty to language
group organizations, and the Ameri-
can elements which have the capa-
bility of making the party an organ-
ization that will function in the class
struggle in this country-—MAKING
IT A PARTY OF ACTION.

It is the juncture of these two
elements achieved at the unity con-
vention that give significance to the
“At Last.”

* >14 >l<

The words have still another
significance. The -two organizations
which are combined in. the United
Communist Party came into exist-

tion which is so fundamentally a
challenge to the whole capitalist
order as a communist party must
be, can escape the full weight of the

power of’p-ersecution w ‘ M the cap--

The United Communist Party
makes no pretense ‘of legality. It has
not attempted‘ to express the fun-
damental Communist principles in a
way to make them pass the censor-
ship ,,of its bitter enemy. The program
of the united party is, what it should
be, a bold challenge to the whole cap-

revolutionary purpose, without Ile-
servation or compromise.
The program of the party declares

that the final struggle between the

workers and the capitalists, between
exploited and exploiter, will take the
form of civil war, and that it is the
function of the United Communist
Party systematically to familiarize

the working class wlth the necessity
of armed insurrection as the only
means through which the capitalist
government and the capitalist system
can be overthrown.

This declaration in the program of
the united party marks an advance
over the previous program declara-
tions of the two Communist organ-

izations as great as the declaration A

of principles in these programs were
advances over the. principles of the
Socialist party, from which they
sprung. ‘ ,

The United Communist Party
enters the working class struggle
in this country as the first clear-cut
expression of the revolutionary move-
ment that has achieved a splendid
victory" in Russia, that temporarily
held Hungary and Bavaria, and that
is nearing its goal of the Workers’
Dictatorship for the transformation
of capitalism in Germany; in Italy
and the other European countries.
It not only clearly expresses the
principles which have guided‘ the
action in the working class victories
achieved thus far, but it has within
its ranks the men and women who
can carry those principles into action
and make the party a living, vital
force in the struggles of the workers
in this country. . «

The last eighteen months have been
the formative period for this move-
ment.’ It was to be expected that
during this period there should be
alignments and realignments of the
various elements of a revolutionary
character. The various factional
controversies ‘discouraged many
active and valuable comrades. They
refused to join either party until
unity was achieved, an.d thus the
Communist movement was deprived
of the support of many. who would
have been a source of added strength.

  r The Class Struggle.

  The conflict that is rending capitalist society

7  is a class struggle.'It is a struggle between ex-

ploiter and exploited, between oppressor and ,0}:-

pressed. The basic facts of the present economic

system place capitalist and worker in opposition

 ,to one another, in constant conflict over wages,

7, hours and working conditions.

 The overthrow of capitalism and the estab-

v  lishment of a Communist society is the historic
 mission of the working class. The United States.

‘L the class struggle of the workers against capital-
éism."

rests in monopolistic enterprises; its income
ends upon the adventures of finance-capital;
members secure positions of management in
, industries. Through various bribes the middle
 becomes the defender of imperialistic capi-
Vsm. Also the “aristocracy of labor” aligns

1; v p The Nature 0/’ the State.

. .l in every historical epoch the existing govern-

I gment — the state —- has been the organ of
‘coercion used by the ruling class to keep the
exploited class in subjection. The state is the
, expression of the organized power of the domi-
:nant irlass. ’

    
  
 
   

 In ijeapitalist society the state is sometimes
~ocrajtic in appearance. The workers are per-

 

. ,‘w_ ,  ,

THE COMMUNIST 11

mitted to take part in elections and seemingly
the government is the expression of “the wil1.of
the people.” The capitalist government is none
the less a class government, the organ of the
capitalists for the coercion of the workers.

So long, as the capitalists control the power of
the newspapers, the pulpit, the‘ politicians, the
schools and colleges; solong as millions of work-
ers are disfranchised through racial and resi-
dential qualifications and naturalization laws, the
capitalists can well afford to allow the workers
the empty privilege of periodically voting to con-
firm their rule.

As the class struggle develops more bitter
antagonisms the state arrays’ itself openly on
the side of the capitalists. In every strike the
state power is used to coerce the workers. The
steel strike and miners’ strike furnished con-
spicuous examples of this use of governmental
power.

In the control of the state power lies the
strength of the capitalist class. This control
places at its command the military and police
power for the protection of its class interests.

While this power remains in the hands of the

capitalists the working class cannot achieve its
emancipation. .

Election Campaigns.-

The United Communist Party participates in
election campaigns and parliamentary action
only for the purpose of revolutionary propaganda.
Nominations for public office and participation
in elections are limited to legislative bodies, such
as the national congress, state legislatures and
city councils. «

The "United Communist Party will make use at
appropriate times of the policy of boycotting
the elections, especially when the elections would
be a diversion from the mass action of the work-
ers. -

Moderate Socialism, such as that of the So-
cialist _Party, proposes to secure control of the
capitalist state through electing a majority of

- the legislative and constitution-making bodies, to

use the position thus achieved totransform cap-
italism. It proposes to capture political power
by’ strict adherence to exactly those constitutional
methods which capitalist representatives have
astutely selected to make their government im-
mune from fundamental change through the pop-
ular suffrage. '

The expulsion of the Socialist Assemblymen at
Albany, the expulsion of the Socialist Councilmen
111 Cleveland during the war, indicate‘ how sum-
marily the capitalists get rid of elected officials
who even in the least degree challenge the capital-
ist dictatorship. «

When Moderate Socialism assumes th'e ap-
parent control of the state power it uses this

power not to transform but to protect capital-

ism, as did the _Kerensky regime in Russia and
the Ebert-Scheidemann-Noske government in

12 THE COMMUNIST

Germany; that is, the condition upon which the
Moderate Socialists are allowed to hold the pol-
itical power without armed resistance by the ca-
pitalist class is that they shall betray the working
class struggle for emancipation.

The United Communist Party participates in
the election campaigns and in the legislative de-
bates only to avail itself of these propaganda

-opportunities to expose the sham of capitalist

democracy. It will not, however, be always and
everywhere the policy of the party to nominate
candidates, even though not prevented by legal
persecution. When the revolutionary crisis shat-
ters the mass illusions as to capitalist democracy,
it becomes unnecessary for the Communists to
direct their agitation to the destruction of these
illusions. The events of 1919 and 1920 have- gone
far toward enlightening the American workers
as to the real nature of capitalist democracy.

“But when.the workers win one or more battles
of revolutionary potentiality the doors of the le-
gislative halls are likely. to be thrown wide open
to the Socialist and Laborite betrayers of the
workers’ struggle. Then the “yellow” spokesmen
of Labor will become invaluable tothe capitalist
class as the most useful agents to bring to life
again the illusions of parliamentary democracy.
At such a time the consciously revolutionary
workers will send to the legislatures and to
Congress the Communist spokesmen: to expose

this deception and to keep to the front the slogan:,
Down with the parliamentary sham of capital- ‘

ism; Hail to the soviets and real working class
democracy!

Communist representatives will not introduce
nor support reform measures. They will make
clear that such measures are of no fundamental
significance to the working class; that they are
only the recognition by the capitalist represent-
atives that there are “efficiency” limits to the
using up ofathe health and lives of the working
men, women and children. At best they are be-
lated parliamentary acknowledgments of de-
fensive gains won by the workers in their indus-
trial struggles. Indeed, all concessions by the gov-
ernment to the Working class reflect the strength
of the workers in their distinct class organization.

The United Communist Party will maintain the

I uncompromising class struggle under all circum-

stances and refuse to cooperate with groups or

-. parties not committed to the revolutionary class

struggle, such as the Labor Party, Socialist
Party, Socialist Labor ‘Party, Non-Partisan
League, Municipal Ownership Leagues, and the
like. ‘ A C

A Industrial Unionism.

Industrial unionism is potentially a factor in the
action for the conquest of power, and it will con-
stitute a basis for industrial administration of
‘the co-operative commonwealth. The United Com-
munist Party therefore propagandizes industrial
1 unionism as against craft unionism ofthe A. F.
V of L. type.

   
    
   
    

Craft unionism has become the bulwark E
capitalism in this country. In. every re 3‘
struggle of moment the workers have been “
trayed by the reactionary officials of the A7
can Federation of Labor and the Railtoad :I
therhoods. The officials of the latter organizat  9
even went so far as to call upon the governm 1‘ .,

  

_to use the courts against the workers engaged it  9

what they chose to call “outlaw” strikes.e1§}" 
tactics of the trade union leaders are those W? W’
dickering with the capitalists and their gove Q‘

sitions for their trade groups, at the expense 2, ‘ .

The concentration of industry rapidly enlar V
the new class of industrial workers, the unskil . I
laborers and semi-skilled machine tenders. Its 
among these workers particularly that therel   '

the new method of struggle, mass strikes off ;
the workers in the industry. The common le ’
of labor and wages and.the common interest
workers by the millions bring class solidarity
opposition to craft‘disunity. e

The United Communist Party rejects the c 
ception, as advocated by the I. W. W-, that 1 j‘
dustrial unionism is of itself the means throt ,
which industry can be transferred from the 
talists to the workers. The proletarian revolutl A
cannot be achieved by direct seizure of indusj Q
by the workers, without the workers first havi
conquered the power of the state and establisli
themselves as the government. While poinf
out that industrial unionism cannot transfoj. :
society, the United Communist Party recognié L
that industrial unionism is a revolt against , ;¥’3€
existing trade unionism and offers’ more effici’ éke:
methods of struggle. _ A  ,

The Socialist Party policy of “boring fr 53‘

THE COMMUNIST . ‘ 18

The Communists aim to give these struggles ‘

the direction of conscious organization for the
final struggle; and, at the proper time, 1t-be-
comes the vital duty of the Communists to in-
itiate the creation of councils —— the soviets_——
through which the whole power of the working
class can be united into one overwhelming ‘offen-
sive against the capitalist police and military
power.

The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.

The immediate aim of the United Communist
Party is to overthrow and destroy the capital-.
ist government andi.-.to establish a workinglclass
government.

The form of the working class government which
must accompany the proletari'an° revolution is the
Dictatorship of the Prolet/ariat. It is the Dictator-
ship of the Proletariat which breaks the opposi-
tion of the capitalists and inaugurates Com-
munism.

The capitalists of this country have .iven
ample evidence that they Wlll not easily give up

their privileged position as exploiters. They have «

murdered thousands in their efforts to prevent
the workers from gaining better wages and work-
ing conditions. Homestead, McKees Rock, Law-
rence, Ludlow, Calumet and Hecla, Massaba
Range, Hammond and "scores of other industrial

struggles have shown that the capitalists do not _

hesitate to shed the blood of the workers in order
to protect their interests.

No ruling class in history has given up its
power without a bitter struggle. The final arbiter

in the struggle. between the classes which is

written across the pages of history is force.

The working class must prepare itself for this
conflict. It must develop organs of working class
power and government. The experience of the
proletarian revolution in other countries has
shown that it is through workers’ councils —
soviets —— that the power of the working class
can best be mobilized for the struggle against the
capitalists. These councils then become the basis
for the workers’ control of society, the initial
units for the organization of the Dictatorship of
the Proletariat. -

The Dictatorship of the Proletariat is the
means through which the workers reconstruct
the industrial system according to the program of
Communism.

In contrast to the Communists, the Anarchists
propose at one stroke to do away with all govern-
ment, not taking into account the need of the
workers for their own organs of governmental
power to crush the resistance of the capitalists.
Only after private property has been converted
into communistic property, by expropriation of
the bourgeoisie, do the class divisions disappear;
and with the passing of the class antagonisms
goes also the state —— organ for control of one
class by another. The workers’ government -—

the Dictatorship of the Proletariat -—- as the

division of the classes disappears, finally converts

ciety without coercive functions or power.

I mmediate T asksa

In order to enable the party to function more
effectively in the immediate struggles of the
workers, shop groups of the party must be organ-
ized to secure actual contact with the workers.
These shop groups, together with Communist
groups within the unions, shall carry on the ag-
itation for industrial unionism and against the
A. F- of L. -

The Communists in the shops and unions, and
the party through its general propaganda organs,
shall take part in the strikes in order to deepen
and broaden them —— to unite them on a class
basis and to give them revolutionary political
consciousness. \

The unskilled and semi-skilled workers, includ-
ing the agricultural laborers, constitute the bulk
of the working class. It is an important part of
the Work of the United Communist Party to
awaken these workers to industrial union organ-
ization and action.

In close connection is the problem of the negro
workers. The racial oppression which is the
special burden of the negro workers is essentially
an expression of extreme economic exploitation.
This complicates the negro struggle against op-
pression but it does-not separate it from the gen-
eral struggle of the working class. The United
Communist Party will carry on an agitation
among the negro workers to unite them with all
class conscious workers.

The United States is developing a large-scale
policy of militarism. Veiled or open plans for
compulsory military service are being formulated
and carried out. A tremendous semi-official mili-
tary organization, tending to maintain and keep
mobile the military power of the consciously
counter-revolutionary upper and middle class
elements —— the American Legion — is already
playing an active part in the struggle against

the militant proletariat. The Communists will

point out the class character of militarism‘; they
will aim to direct the mass protests against im-
perialist militarism and war toward the civil war
against the capitalist class and its organs of
power.

Non-intervention in the workers’ struggle in
Russia, in Germany, in Italy and in other
countries,_ must be brought to the front as part
of the strike demands, or made the basis of direct
political strikes. .

Likewise, the demand for release of class war
prisoners‘ must be projected 1nto the strikes and
other workers’ demonstrations and struggles.

The Communists must bring into these
struggles the tendency toward conscious organ-
ization of the workers for taking over complete
social control. Such control as the workers can
secure of capitalist industry through their mass

   
    
   
 
  

demands can best be exercised through sh
committees, shop stewards, or similar organi
tions. But control of industry won and maintai
by the power of the workers must not be confu
with the sham “industrial democracy” est. V

purposes as the political democracy of cap1tal1  E
At the appropriate stage of the struggle  1
Communists must take the lead toward the est

The breakdown of capitalist order and the desa It
truction of industry makes impossible recon- 
struction on the capitalistic basis. The workers ;
can become emancipated and social order can be ;
maintained only when production is controlled:
by the workers.

In order to crush opposition,,in order to raise -the .'

ship must proceed as rapidly as possible with the “ . M
expropriation of capitalism. The means of pr0= EA‘

the common property of the working masses or- 
ganized in a Council system. 
The power of the Councils must be built on direct

~ participation in control of the government and

of workers are brought more directly under state
and military control; the railroads are converted
into more effective instruments ‘for the militar-
istic program of capitalist-imperialism (as in
Germany and France, as in the United States
during the war, etc.).

There can be no true public services except
under the rule of the working class, since then
only is the government itself an instrument of
the mass welfare —— an instrument against ex-

ploitation. All of the Communist program for they

socialization of industry is to be understood only
in connection with ‘— as subsequent to -— the
conquest of the political power by the workers
as a class and the establishment of the Workers’
Dictatorship. ‘ ‘

As illustrative of the general Communist pro-
gram of economic and political reconstruction, we
present the guiding policy stated in the manifesto
of the Communist International, with the quali-
fication that the more exact and more detailed
program for the United States must await the
further, progress of the class struggle:

“The Dictatorship of the Proletariat does not
\in any way call for partition of the means of
‘production and exchange; rather, on the con-
' trary, its aim is further to centralize the forces
* of production and to subject all of production
to a symmetrical plan. As the first step toward
socialization of the eiitire economic system may
be mentioned: the socialization of the great
banks which now control "production; the taking
over by the state power of the proletariat of
all government-controlled economic utilities;
the transferring of all communal enterprises;
the socializing of the syndicated and trustified

- units of production, as well as all other branch- -

es of _production in which the degree "of con-
centration and centralization of capital makes
this technically practicable; the socializing of
agricultural estates and their conversion into
c_o-operative- establishments.

As far as the smaller enterprises are concern-
ed, the proletariat must gradually unite them,
according to the degree of their importance.
It must be particularly emphasized that small

V properties will in no way be expropriated and
that property owners who are not exploiters
of labor will not be forcibly dispossessed. This
element willgradually be drawn into the social-
istic organization through the force of ex-
ample, through practical demonstration of the

superiority of the new order of things, and the '

regulation by which the small farmers and the
petty. bourgeoisie of the cities will be freed
from economic bondage to usurious capital and
landlordi-smy‘; and from tax burdens (especially
by annulment of the national debts), etc.

The task of the Proletarian Dictatorship in
the ecoiiomic field can only be fulfilled to the
extent that the proletariat is enabled to create

* centralized organs of management and to ins-

titute workers’ control. To this end it must
make use of its mass organizations which are

in closest relation to the process of production.

In the field of distribution the Proletarian ‘

Dictatorship must re-establish commerce by
an accurate distribution of products. To this
end the following methods are to considered:
the socialization of wholesale establishments,
the taking over of all state and municipal ‘or-
gans of distribution; control of the great c_o-
operative societies, which organizations will
still have an important role in the production
epoch; the gradual centralization of all the-se
organs and their conversion into a systematic
unity for the rational distribution of products.

Besides expropriating the factories, mines,
estates, etc., the proletariat must also abolish
the exploitation of the people by capitalistic
landlords, transfer the large mansions to the
local workers’ councils, and move the working
people into the bourgeoise dwellings.

As in the field of production so also in the
field of distribution all qualified technicians
andspecialists are to" be made use of, provided
their political resistance is broken and they are
still capable of adapting themselves, not "to the
service of capital, but to the new system of
production. Far from oppressing them the prol-
etariat will make it possible for the first time

for them to develop intensive creative work. 
The Proletarian Dictatorship, with their «co-“W

operation, will- reprieve the separation of
physical and mental. work which capitalism
has developed and thus will Science and Labor
be unified.” V ‘

whiqh are actually unattainable by the prol-"C  C"  "

etariat, because of want of the material means
for their enjoyment‘; while the bourgeoisie
uses its material advantages, through its press
and organizations, to deceive and betray the
people. On the other hand, the Council type
of government makes it possible for the prol-
etariat to realize its rights and liberties. The
Council power gives to the people palaces,
houses,‘ printing offices, paper ‘supply, etc.,
for their press, their societies, their assemblies.
And in this way alone is actual proletarian
democracy .made possible.

Bourgeois democracy, with its parliamentary
system, uses words to ‘induce belief in popular
participation in_ government. Actually the
masses and their organizations are held far
out of reach of the real power and the real
state administration. In the Council system
the mass organizations rule, and throughthem
the mass itself, inasmuch as the Councils draw
constantly increasing numbers of workers into
the state administration; and only byjthis
process will the entire working population
gradually become part of the government. The
Council system also builds itself directly on the
mass organizations of. the workers: on the

   

 

.,§:.,5\- A

L.

urv ,

 

councils themselves, the revolutionary trade
unions, the co-operatives, etc.

Bourgeois democracy and its parliamentary
system sharpened ’the separation of the masses
from the state by division of the government
into legislative and executive powers, and
through parliamentary enactments beyond
popular recall. The Council system, bycontrast,
unites the masses with the government by
right of recall, amalgamation of legislative
and executive powers, and by use of workers’
administrative boards. Above all, this union is
fosteredby the fact that in the Council system
elections are based not on arbitrary territorial
districts, but on units of production.

In this way the Council system brings about
true proletarian democracy — democracy by

and for the proletarians against the bour-
geoisie.”

Social Reconstruction

Under Capitalism the very development of
higher productivity is inevitably accompanied by
an intensification, of the bondage and oppression
of the ‘workers. The machines invented to serve
humanity-have become the instruments for en-

of the producing masses.

Communism will release all the productive

,  energies for the common welfare of all the people.

In place of profit as the animating impulse to
production must stand the needs and enjoyments
of the producting masses.

The right and the obligation to labor —— service
toward the common enjoyment of all -— this shall
be the basis of citizenship under the Communist
regime. _

Education of the masses toward better social
‘service and toward higher appreciation of the en-
Joyngents of life is the foremost item in the Com-
munist transformation. This education must go
to the adult workers, who have so long toiled in
darkness, as well as to all the children‘ of the
nation. -

Education under Communism, as already in
process of development in Russia, takes account

of the physical welfare of the children along with
their mental training. Under_ the blockade con-
ditions compelling the rationing of food, it has
been the children who have always been
given the preference. Tens of_ thousands of chil-
dren of the poor in the big cities have been fed
on a communal basis. Meanwhile, too, the palaces
of czarism have been converted into homes for

the homeless war orphans. The general educa-

tional system includes periods for all city children
in the country, on the socialized agricultural

» estates, while the ‘village. children,  turn, will
be brought periodically into the cities, and in -

this way education is made to _include_contact
with every phase of the industrial, institutional
and cultural life of the nation.‘ ‘

Art, music, the stage —— all the cultural advan-
tages which have been held aloof for the enjoy-
ment of the privileged few, and in their more

‘vulgar forms have been used to deceive and cajole

the masses, —— become the institutions of the
working masses. Art is thereby released from
its prostitution to exploiting interests, and be-
comes imbued with new inspiration and vitality.

In a word, the working class will have at its
disposal all that civilization has thus far produced
for the enhancement of individual and social life.‘
The better organization of the industrial and
social system can in a single generation, with
the advanced technique and science of today,
achieve more toward the eradication of disease,
crime, depravity and superstition than has been
accomplished in all the prior centuries together.

C. E. C. Meeting.

MMEDIATELY after the conven-
tion the C. E. C. of the United party
went into session. The spirit of the
new organization showed itself in
the vigor and comprehensiveness
with which the,C. E. C. began its
work. One member made the comment
that more decisions ‘of highest im-
portance t-0 the organization were
made by this committee within two
hours than had been made by the
C. E. C. of the Communist Party in
all its eight months of existence.

The first task was the determina-
tion of districts and appointment of
organizers. Then the ' election of
officers of the national organization,

F on the convention plan that the C. E.

C. members should be composed, as
far as possible, of active party
workers, each one to take charge of
some special department of the work.

The districts are as follows (sub-
ject to modification upon recommen-
dation of the District Committees):

DISTRICT No. 1—New England
states; Boston the center.

DISTRICT No. 2-—New York state
to Syracuse; Connecticut; northern
New Jersey to Trenton; Panama,
Porto Rico. New York City the
center.

DISTRICT No. 3——-Eastern Pennsyl-
vania; southern/New Jersey; De-
laware; Virginia; Maryland; D. of

DISTRICT No. 10--California, Neva-
dag’ Hawaii. San Francisco as

DISTRICT No. 11-Oregon, Washing-
ton; northern Idaho; Alaska. Port-
land as center.

The appointment of organizers
was, for the most part, temporary, it
being impossible to communicate with
several whose names were under con-
sideration.

The list of party officials, some
combined in the same persons, was
agreed upon as follows: Secretary,
Treasurer, Party Editor and Asso-
ciates, Educational Director, Tech-
nical and Business Director, Defense
Director, National Organizers, Audi-
ting Committee.

Executive Secretary, Meyer; Treas-
urer, Flynn; Editor, Damon;’Asso-
ciate Editors, with special assign-
ments to various publications, Brown,
Caxton, Dawson; National Organizers
Flynn and Fisher; Technical Director,
Klein; Defense Director, Caxton;
Educational Directors, the Editor and
Associates; Auditing Committee,
Dawson and Damon.

Appointments were made of foreign-
language editors and organizers,
these to serve temporalily until na-
tional language conferences are held.
It was agreed that all official papers,
in all -languages, should be named
“The Communist,” all to be issued
bi-weekly and to be of uniform size.
Also, the leading’ editorials will
appear in all languages.

Careful consideration was given to
the situation as to each language
group, but final decisions were ‘de-
layed for the most part until con-
sultation could be had with the
members of these groups. In several
instances, however, immediate ar-
rangements were made for publi-
cation of language literature and for
work of organization, including the
language groups not heretofore re-
presented in the Communist organ-
izations, like the Finns. -

Wages of national. officials were

fixed at $50 for married men, $40

for single men, with per diem of $3
and $2 respectively while on road.

Organizers who can speak lan-
guages other than that of the group
to which they have been specially
assigned are instructed to, assist in
the work of the other language
groups. I

The location of national head-
quarters was left to the decisions of
the C. E. C. from time to time.

The following motion-is to be care-
fully. considered’ by those active in
the work of Communist legal; de-
fense: “that legal defense be strictly
controlled as to policy and finance
by the party organization; that com-
mittees of delegates be constituted
into organizations for raising de-
fense funds, these delegates to be

sent from the party branches; but
that all defense expenditures shall

‘be made only upon approval of the

C. E. C., the Executive Secretary, or
the Defense Director; that existing
committees shall be reorganized in
conformity with this decision; that
defense organizations render finan-
cial report at least oncela month to
the national office through regular

party channels; that funds shall be.

held by, the treasurers of ‘these de-
fense organizations subject to draft
by the national organization; that all
pending Communist cases shall be

handled without regard to the split in 

the C. P.
A motion was carried that the 75c
dues rate shall begin July 1st.

An organization stamp was ordered ,7

at 50c.

The International Secretary was

instructed to notify the Secretary of‘
the Amsterdam Sub-Bureau as to the?
Communist Party situation in thig

country; that the former Pan-Amer‘-” I‘

ican Provisional Bureau has split in
three parts, and that the U. C. P.

proposes to proceed with the prelimi-

nary organization of the _Pan-Amer-
ican Sub-Bureau. The International
Secretary and the two Delegates were
named a committee for the purpose
of establishing this sub-bureau.

 The Convention of Revolutionists.

URING the. first week of Sep-
tember, 1919, there were organ-
. ized in the United States two
Communist parties. Within two
months both parties together had

‘completed an enrollment of more

than 40,000 dues-paying members.
The prospects pointed.‘ to a quick
increase to 60,000, perhaps 70,000;--
about three-fourths of the former
Socialist Party" membership.

Along came the Lusk. Committee

raids and arrests in New York; also_

sporadic arrests elsewhere in connec-
tion with the November 7th celebra-
tion. Organization of Communists was
checked. Came an ominous lull then

the avalanche of the New Year -
' the Palmer nation wide raids, arrests,_

brutalities.

At the end of January Secretary
of Labor Wilson held that ‘alien
members; of the Communist Party
were subject to depotrtation. Com-
munists——members of both parties-—
were branded as outlaws in the
courts of New York and New Jersey.
Like ’results appeared imminent in
Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan,
California, Ohio, Indiana, in many
others states.

No longer were there party head-
quarters, neither national, state, nor
local. The active party officials were
in jail or were fugitives. No meetings
could. be held without inviting
arrests. Very little money could be
raised even for defense and relief of
prisoners.

By February 1920 the two thriving
parties of October 1919 had vanished.
The Luskers and Palmerites had done
their work completely, perfectly. This
country ‘was immunized from the
“red” terror — the terror which

Sometime recently, somewhere
between the Atlantic and
between the Gulf and the Great
Lakes, two groups of elected deleg-
ates assembled as the Unity Con-
ference of the Communist Party and
the Communist Labor Party. Of‘ the
former, 32; of the latter, 25, and one

fraternal delegate; also a represent—.

ative of the Executive Committee of
the Communist International. These
59 delegates came together from all
parts of the United States, held
sessions for seven days, debated every
issue with absolute thoroughness, laid
out the plan of work for the United
Communist Party; —— all under the
most perfect circumstances conceiv-
able for such a convention.

One who holds in his hand the
scroll upon which is inscribed the
record of this mysterious gathering
is amazed, for one thing, at the roll

of delegates. Communist Party and

In spite of the fact that these
delegates came together on a call for
a “Unity Conference”, in ‘spite of
all realization of the fearful blow it
would be to the Communist move-
ment in this country if unity were
not at once achieved, it was not
until noon of the seventh day that
this issue was decided conclusively.

Neither side was fully conscious of _

the undercurrentof sentiment on the
other side. Factional controversies of
nearly a year’s standing surcharged
the atmosphere with suspicion —

suspicion not only across the lines

but within each camp. None of the
delegates were willing to surrender
their reservations until after a long
series of debates, some of little

intrinsic importance, many on basic

questions of Communist understand-
ing and practicemquestions which had
never before been really faced in
United States.

One delegate hit upon the most
salient truth about this convention in
the remark that, in contrast to any
other convention in which he had
taken part either in Europe or Amer-
ica, this convention had met squarely
every essentialissue and debated it

» fully to its ultimate solution.

There were three separate advance
sessions of the two parties. To each
of these conventions was presented
the tentative draftof a Program and
Constitution previously prepared by
a Joint Committee: Damon, Caxton
and Fisher, C. P., and Brown, Klein
and Dubner, C. L. P.

During the second of these sessions,
a message came to the C. P. con-
vention that the C. L. P. convention
had accepted the agreements of the
Joint Committee as a basis for unity,
reserving all amendments for joint
discussion.

At this moment the C. P. conven-
tion h.ad under consideration a sub-
stitute Manifesto, Program and
Constitution presented by Ford for
the New York District delegation.
The debate quickly centered on the
declaration as to “mass action”, it
being conceded that the Joint Com-
mittee Program was more acceptable
as an entirety. The main contention
was that the Joint Committee had not
used direct and unequivocal language
as to force. It was answered that the
criticism was only of words; that
there could not possibly be any
doubt but that the Program pointed
clearly to armed revolt as the ulti-
mate and inevitable form of “mass
action.” '

A Personal ‘suspicion stimulated this
argument. The outside group of the C.
P.-—the majority members of the
Central Executive Committee — had

manufactured the issue of force as
a dominant item in the C. P. split.
There had never been such a fac-
tional issue. But the Eastern dele-
gates particularly were determined to
make certain that there would be
nothing about’ the handling of this
subject which might leave a loophole
for the C. P. opposition.

. Agreement was reached for the
revision of the Program in a number
of particulars, the C. P. delegates to
support these amendments as a
unit. The C. P. convention further
bound its members on the issue of
federations; also, to retaln the C. P-
name and emblem.

* * *

The first joint session opened with
a spirited dispute as to election; Of
committees. Some of the C’. P. de eg-
ates insisted upon_ discussion of the?‘
Program as the first order of bus-
iness. They said. that they were not
ready to commit themselves as to
jointproceedings until the Program
was disposed of. This brought forth
angry protest; it served as a chal-
lenge to the group un1tY_03l1 the 0- L-
P. It was urged -that unity had been
achieved by coming together on the
basis of the Joint Committee Pro-
gram and Constitution; that every
provision was open to amendment by

the convention; that there mightxbe T 

a new division on the issues to come
up, but that the old party division;
was gone. ' ‘ ‘ L
A belt of nine or ten of the C. 
delegates was started. Klein (C.L.P.) i
re-introduced the motion to proceed.
with the discussion of the Programg
Peace was restored. 

The opening debates were sparring“

matches, with a strong undercurrent 

Of nervousness. Threescore persons,

engaged in ‘a criminal conspiracy, ‘ p 

spent two hours to decide whether L
capitalism breaks down in . that. it i
fails to “produce” the needs of life,
or whether the collapse 1s'due to the

failure to “provide”. After consider-V 0

able uncertainty the argument pre- 
vailed that capitalism, .in spite of all ‘ .
its equipment, stultifies production; u
‘the wheels of industry turn only at

the call of ‘profit, regardless of all
capabilities for production; crisis or
no crisis, capitalism has never
functioned to “provide” the needs of
the masses...

In the playfulness of this debate
was expressed relaxation
forestalling of ‘ another premature
clash. Thisiwas the safe way of-.
“getting acquainted” —— the suppres-
sed form of the struggle for unity.

* * *

Restrained resentment. and sus-
picion broke loose into 1 a furious
storm during the next session. At the

first statement in the Program con- , _. 
cerning the overthrow of the cap- 

italist system. it was insisted that
the word 7‘forcible" be added. Like-

wise, at the first mention of “con-. 0’

quest of political power” it was de-

ti ﬂmanded that there be added “by the

use of armed force.” One amendment
was piled upon another — a veritable
“force” panic.

In vain was it argued that this
part of the Program contained only
preliminary definitions, statements
of the goal to be achieved; that the
Program, under appropriate sub-

 divisions, gave full attention to the

methods of action; that the item of
armed force does not stand by itself;

* but is the inevitable culminating

aspect of “mass action”; that this
tactic must be presented in its dev-
elopmental character -—— armed upris-
ing as the unavoidable sequence of

I the advancing class conflict.
I The C. L. P. delegates, for they

most part, were ready for a ‘test of
strength against the C. P..“irrecon-
cilables.” They were conscious that

iithis minority would have to accept

’ defeat, since the point to be voted
was only on what page something
should be stated in the Program.
Others sensed too ’much danger of
misunderstanding behind such a vote,
too much anger where agreement

. could easily be reached. Caxton moved

to recommit this part of the Program,
then to adjourn. There were some
 protests, but the motion prevailed.
Meanwhile the tension was relaxed by
the brilliant satirical speech of

_ Sherwood, whose Yankee wit was the

perfect antidote for passionate arg-
ument on an artificially stimulated

I issue.

on “Mass Action”, gave the conven-
,,.t'ion smooth sailing the next morning.

* * *

 A spirited debate ensued on the

‘proposition to limit nominations to
=“egislative officers, according to the
clause of the C. P. program. The

anti-parliamentarians. ‘took the side
i of limiting nominations as one way of
expressing opposition’ to all nomina-

U jtions. Brown (C.L.P.) and some of the

_C. P. speakers argued directly against

P.) contended that this clause was
needed to discourage petty nomina-
tions by local units of the party,
Raphailoff (C. L. P.) Caxton (C. P.),
Malcolm (C. L. P.) and others pointed
out that the general proposition of

parliamentary action was not in- A

ivolved in this debate; that to the
extent we were to have any nomina-
tions at all it wasindispensable, under
the American system, to name the
“head of the ticket”, the president,
governor or mayor; that this clause
had been written into the C. P. pro-
gram under the. misconception that
this was-the proper method of meeting
the “ministerial question,” the fact

M“ being that the Socialist ministers in
Europe had all been elected as.

legislative candidates; that in this
country the Socialists whether elec-

issue was not clear-cut, since the.

TEE COMMUNIST

‘ted to legislative or executive offices

had all behaved equally_ badly; that,
finally, it was no occasion to worry
about the actions of a Communist
president, because the revolution
would forestall this contingency, and
that minor executive officers could
serve'just as well to be thrown out
of office as the Communists elected
to the legislatures.

By a close vote the paragraph was
retained, but the limitation is of no
immediate practical moment since
the convention further went on
record against all nominations during
the 1920 campaigns.

* $ *

On the third day occurred the
longest and most stubborn debate of
the convention, that on industrial
unionism. This was another three-
cornered affair. The C. P. convention
had passed up the question of the
I. W: W. because it was apparent
that this question could not be settled
by agreement. Perhaps two-thirds of
the C. P. delegates favored a direct
endorsement of the I. W. W. and a
program of co-operation, reserving
criticism of the I. W. W. theorizing.
The other C. P. delegates considered
the I. W. W. as essentially no better
than the A. F. of L., citing the
reactionary character of the I. W. W.
in some of the Eastern cities. All of
the C. P. delegates were agreed upon
an absolute stand against the A. F.
of L. as an inherently anti-revolu-
tionam organization which must be
destroyed.

On the other hand, there was a
strong current in the C. L. P. ranks
for a treatment of the subject of
industrial unionism from a general
viewpoint which would neither include
direct endorsement of the I. W. W.
nor absolute condemnation of the A.
F. of L. The lead in this debate was
taken by Dawson who argued that

the A. F. of L. must‘ be considered ,

from the angle of the local unions,
not from the side of the Gompers
officialdom; that industrial unionism
was having a development in many
fields aside from the I. W. W.; that
the need was for a call to a new
general industrial union, a new One
Big Union.

' On both sides there was not only a
close analysis of the proper function

.of a Communist party in connec-

tion with the unions, but also a wealth
of illustrative material out of actual
shop and union experience. Machinists,
miners and ship-builders fused their
practical understanding with the
more ‘abstract conceptions of those
whose vision was focused on the ulti-
mate revolutionary clash.The cleavage
was not between “intellectuals” and
“rank and file,” but between workers
in the industries who had undergone
contrasting forms of experience.

The original Joint Committee pro-
posal on this subject had been taken
over from a draft by the Chicago
District Committee. Dozens of amend-
ments and substitutes were brought
before the convention, but finally the

 

- section was adopted as originally

presented. As a result of the debate,
however, the Committee opened the
subject for reconsideration the next
day,presenting _two' amendments which
were accepted. In the sentence. “A
Communist who belongs to the A.’F.
of L., on account of absolute Job
necessity, should seize every opportu-
nity to voice his hostility _ to this
organization, ‘not to reform. it but to
destroy it,” there was eliminated the
phrase “on; account of absolute Job
necessity.” The sentence, “A stronger
I. W. W. must be built,” was stricken
out.
*. * *

The unity issue flared up again
on the question of party name. On
the first vote there were 22 counted
for “Communist Party,” 24 against.
A roll call was demanded; the C. P.
names were read first; 30 votes were
recorded for “Communist Party.”

The C; L. P. delegates resented
what they considered a coercive vote
without any chance for discussion.
An indignation speech was made by
Flynn which proved the moral. power
of effective minority criticism; _—
with the opening of the next session
came a ballot vote on “United Com-
munist Party” or “Communist Party”
with “united” _ written underneath.
The vote was 33 to 22 for “United
Communist Party.”

This appeared to be the real achieve-
ment of unity, the breakdown of
the old party lines. . . But there were
still the elections.

it 3|! *

Two important debates came under

the consideration of the Constitution,-

one on party centralization, the other
on federations.

In the first instance the issue of
centralization came up on the amend-
ment making the C. E. C. appoint-
ment and removal .of ‘organizers

subject to the approval of the district _

executive committees. On the one
side it was argued that this meant the
substitution of autonomous districts
for autonomous federations, a central
executive shornof real authority and
real capability of action; that de-
mocracy was not to be obtained by
decentralization, but only by some
effective means for control of the
central authority; that district com-
mittees would lend themselves more
easily to factional manipulation than
the central committee elected in a
national convention by delegates well
known to the members. It was urged
that an underground party must have
the possibility of instant decision and
action by a small committee; it must
act as a single machine, else it can
never strike a decisive blow.

Lack of confidence in officials was
the central theme of the contrary
argument. The party affairs, it was
urged, must be brought nearer to the
control of the rank and file. The
central committees had been the
breeding place of factional contro-

.versies». It was not asking much to

give the district committees a veto

in the choice of the organizers upon
whom their work depended.

Upon the first vote the amendment
was declared adopted. It then appear-
ed that some of the delegates had
misconceived the ‘proposition to be
one of appointing all organizers
“from the top downward”, that is,

. sub—district, section, branch and
group organizers as well as the
district organizers. A motion to
reconsider (‘was made and declared
lost. Then followed a keen parlia-

 elections. Regardless of the sentiment
C .119 , V of the convention expressed by a
V -5 majority vote against further cau-

  
 
  

cuses, neither side was willing to
risk a surrender of its group strength.

A motion was made by Spark (C.
P.) that the C. E. C. be composed of
the five C. P. delegates and four
C. L. P. delegates receiving the
highest votes, without‘ contest as
between the C. P. and C. L. P. can-
diidat-es. The motion was not support-
e . I

Brown and Caxton were the
nominees for International Secretary.
Brown 30, Caxton 23.

With two to elect, there were four
nominees for International Delegate.
The vote stood Damon 30, Mieyer
(C. L. P.) 28, Caxton 26, Barry (C.L.
P.)26  The lines were not hold-
ing; four C. P. votes had been divided
between Meyer and Barry.

Then came ten nominations for the
nine places on the C. E. C. Damon,

Scott, Reinhart, Delion, Zemlin, .(C..

P.); Meyer, Klein, Flynn, Blrown,
Dawson, (C. L. P.). These were the
caucus nominations. Obviously the
C. L. P. caucus had determined to
avail itself of the dissensions in the
C. P. ranks and to attempt to elect
a majority of the committee.

At the night session was an-
nounced the result of the balloting;
Damon, Scott, Klein, Flynn, 29;

Brown, 33, Dawson, 32, Meyer, 30;
Reinhart, 26; Delion, Zemlin, tied
at 24.

Damon, Scott and Reinhart quickly
offered their resignations. A- bitter
discussion was precipitated. Both
sides had played for “control” and
the result had been a boomerang;
for how, it was urged, could the C. P.
delegates report back to their
members that they had been out-
witted in strategy in a way to give
the minority control of the united
party? Even though the fault was
that of the C. P. delegates them-
selves, how could that remedy the
outside situation?

The C. L. P. speakers vehemently
answered that what was done was
the result of the will of the con-
vention; that it was outrageous for
members to resign from the C. E. C.
simply because‘ they felt they could
not boss the committee and the
party; that-, after all, ‘this outcome
of the elections would be the best
proof to the members that the old
party lines had been forgotten.

A motion for a recess’ of half an
hour was adopted. Then began the
tug of war which went into the
middle‘ of the night, only to be re-

sumed the next morning — the two’

groups, apparently completely weld-V L;

ed, now standing sharply apart as
C. P. and C. L. P. The convention
vanished; in its place were

change of offers and counter-pro-c
posals. ’

The strained item in the C. P. camp t, 
had been an attack upon Caxton, based . «UT-
P. criticisms. 
In the C. P.. caucus, after long dis-L

on the “majority” C.

cussioii, he had been nominated for
the C. E. C., 18 to. 9. Later Caxton

withdrew his name. Now it was in- 4

sisted that his name be reintroduced,
making Zemlin first alternate. The
C. L. P. offered to substitute Caxton

for Brown as Inktergiatgonal Secretary.

The last morning found‘ the sit-.

uation deadlocked. To open the con-
vention again meant to give the
C. P. the advantage of the renewed
caucus pressure in favor of solidarity
for C.  control, all questions of
personality_ aside. The issue of
control having been precipitated by
the turn of the elections, the C. P.
delegates were in.no mood to give
up their demand for a majority of
the C. E. C.
The C. P. delegates made only one
demand, to reopen the convention. It

There is nothing in the official
record which suggests under what
sort of surroundings all these things
happened. As a matter of fact the
physical surroundings had a very
important part in the struggle for
unity; —- which is not at all illumi-
nating to the reader who is asked to
wait a few years for a description of
these surroundings.

Besides, how is one to visualize one
group of delegates‘, in heated, ar-
gument, while the other group is
engaged in the singing of revolution-
ary songs, mostly Russian, —— how

‘ is one to imagine all this without

something in the way of spacial di-
mensions ? The singing group
marches halfway toward the arguing
group -—- a challenge to unity, the
song of the Internationale —— and
reluctantly marches back to its own
meeting place.

There is a‘ committee conference.
Before the report comes back the
lines are formed for a new march,
this time to go all the way. Agree-
ment is reported: a C. E. C. of ten
members, the five C. L. P. candidates

- i’ to stand elected, five C. P. members-

now to be chosen. The march pro-
ceeds; it ‘is the only report to the

 anxious C. L. P. delegates; -— the

two groups merge into one another,
all singing the Internationale. There
is the grasping of hands, the
embrace of comradeship; nothing is
said —- there is too much feeling for

speech... Unity is achieved...

Recapitulating, the C. E. C. stands:
Damon, Scott, Reinhart, Delion,

An American convention of Com-

munists. Yet there was, more likely

than not, a majority of “foreigners”,
though the division was fairly even.
But these were Communists who were
vitally concerned about the class
struggle in America, men and women
who really expected to take part in
this struggle; not those who toyed
with the Communist movement here
as a method of ingratiating them-
selves in Moscow. '

_It was one of the most inspiring
things about this convention to hear

‘delegates painfully struggling with

the English language, no longer
depending for expression on the
artificial foreign-language caucuses
of prior conventions, but making
themselves one with all the other
delegates in defiance of barriers of
language or nationality.

Perhaps this was the greater
“un1ty” achievement of this con-
vention. . . «
’ * # *

Again and again the sentence was
heard: “We have crossed the Rubicon.”
Every’ delegate was in the hands of
his fellows; all subject to imprison-
ment, deportation, social and eco-
nomic displacement. Yet most of the
time, — not without thanks to the
irrepressible wit of the convention
secretary, Smyth, — the whole affair
seemed like a jollification. Or perhaps
it was the grim seriousness of it all

that challenged relief in playful-
ness . . . .

A revolutionary movement driven

..“underground” is_ apt to .be driven

away at the same time from its own
petty animosities and quibbles.
Forced to face the life and death
character of the combat, it is likely
to discard pretenses, evasions, pur-
poseless quarrels about persons.
Confusion gives way to clarity; hesi-
tation yields to stern determination‘.
A convention of revolutionists —
a convention which Iielentlessly
searched the truth of its every word
and the heart of its every delegate. . .

8 THE COMMUNIST

“The history of all hitherto existing society is
the history of class struggles. Freeman and
slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf, guild-
master an.d journeyman, in a word, oppressor
and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to
one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now
hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time
ended either in the revolutionary reconstitution
of society, or in the common ruin of the contend-
ing classes.

’ The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted

from the ruins of feudal society has not done
away with class antagonisms. It has but
established new classes, new conditions of op-
pression, new forms of struggle in place of the

old ones. A ».
Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, pos-
sesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has
simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a
whole is more and more splitting up into two
great hostile camps, into two great classes di-
rectly facing each other, bourgeoisie and prol-
etariat.”
' Communist Manifesto of 1847.

During the three-quarters of a century since
these historic words were written, the class an-
tagonisms in capitalist society have sharpened
and intensified to the point that brings us face
to face with the alternative of “a revolutionary
reconstitution of society” or “the common ruin

of the contending classes.”

A _ I. «
 A The Collapse of Capitalism.

- Capitalism today faces complete collapse. The
world war, which made a shambles of civilization, '
proved the utter incapacity of capitalism longer
to promote the progress of society.

The oppressions of capitalism, intensified by the
war and its aftermath of misery, have swept

1 "the working class into a revolutionary struggle

for the new social order — the order of Com-
munism — which alone can save humanity.

Civil war between the classes now holds the
world in its grip. On the oneside the League of
Nations rallies the forces of capitalism for a
last desperate stand; on the other side the Com-
munist International calls the workers of the
world to battle for the workers’ rule which will
save civilization.

A Ina large part of Europe capitalist economy is
no longer able to function so as to produce even
the bare necessities of life. Millions are starving;
semi-starvation, has. long been the normal lot of
the working masses of Europe and Asia. Even in
the United States, with all the fabulous wealth
of capitalism, government statistics show that
in the year 1920 more than half the ‘workers’

 

Program of the United Communist Party.

families are undernourished, millions to the point: A

of slow starvation. ‘

Central Europe is still the chaos which 
imperialistic'war made it. Capitalism, due to its "

 
  

own contradictions, has been unable to rebuild j 

the machinery of production. In Germany, Hun-
gary, Austria, Poland, Lithuania; in the Baltic

and Balkan countries; in Italy“, France, England,‘ ’ C ‘

Spain; in Egypt and the small nations of Asia *

Minor; in East India, China and Japan; —— in
every part of the world the working class arrays
itself more aggressively and decisively against
the capitalist rule of society. In the United States
the machinery of production and distribution is

disarranged and choked by widespread strikes in A

the basic industries, strikes compelled by the need
for the bare necessities of life.

This breakdown has resulted not from mysteri-
ous, unforeseen causes, but from forces innate

in the capitalist system, forces accurately chart-*

ed by the Communist pioneers of three-quarters
of a century ago. ~-

Capitalist Exploitation’.

The essence of the capitalist system is the
ownership and control of the materials and tools
of production, and distribution by a small class
whose legal title tothe lands, forests, mines, rail-
roads, quarries, mills, factories, and other in-
dustrial and commercial utilities andplants, gives
them control over the lives of the working masses.
The workers subsist in a new form of slavery,
wherein labor power is paid for by wages, and
the bare chance to live depends upon employment
by some capitalist master. t

Employment depends upon the production by the
worker of a margin of value over and above what
he receives for his labor power. The capitalist
master has no liability on account of the wage-
worker, except that of payment for labor-power
on a time or piece basis.

In its earlier stages, capitalism presentsitself
as a large number of small maunfacturers and
traders in competition. Through this competition

comes more efficient production, ‘by improve-,

ments of machinery and methods. The successful
competitor displaces his rivals, enlarges his plant,
increases at the same time his output and invest-
ment; decreases the number of workers needed
to turn out a given amount of product. As ma-
chinery develops in cost" and size, requiring
constantly larger outlay and larger plant, pro-
duction becomes centered in fewer large-scale
establishments.

This process, hastened by the piratical methods,

1,

of competition made familiar by the history of- '

our trusts, brings us to the stage of monopoly, I‘

concentration of ownership and control of the
economic resources of the nation in the hands

of a few individuals or corporations. This means
even more arbitrary‘ control of the lives of the
working masses by a decreasing capitalist class.
It means artificial manipulation of production for
maximum returns on investment, that is, the
attempt to limit production so as to maintain the
desiredlevel of prices.N otonly .lessened production
and higher prices result from the very progress

of capitalism —- by the innate character of the
system —- but also constantly recurring periods

of interrupted production .with hundreds of

' thousands of workers thrown out of their only

means of livelihood, the blind, ser-vile victims of
a system which responds to but one impulse —
profit.

Meanwhile, along with the creation of the army
of the unemployed, there is a vast accumulation
of surplus, since every item of production is ac-
companied by the taking of unpaid-for service.
Under developed capitalism this surplus increases
so rapidly that what's used up in the most lavish
and princely indul Yce in luxuries makes no
impression. In the Uﬂited States, it has been
calculated, this surplus exceeds 30 billions an-
nually.

This surplus cannot go back into the same
industries without rapidly increasing the out-
put, compelling lower prices and lower rates “of
profit. It becomes capital seeking new avenues
of investment. Investments are centered in the
finance institutions,.,«which are joined with the
monopolistic ente'rprises——in the banks, trust com-
panies, brokerage and mortgage houses, endow-
ments, foundations, etc. These institutions are
controlled largely by the same persons who own
and control the basic industries; also the finance
-establishments themselves have become highly
centralized. This tremendous concentration of
economic power le ds inevitably to the more open
political dictators/hip ‘of the capitalist class. Po-
litical control seeirves, in the first instance, the
immediate busin _ss objects, domestic and foreign.
Fundamentally, this control is needed for the in-
trenchment of class privilege. A powerful, highly
militarized central government is built up to
ward off working class revolt against this gi-
gantic system of exploitation. -

I mperialism.

The iproduction of tremendous amounts of new
capita/ll, with monopolization of the most import-
ant / investment opportunities in the home
coqzntry, compels an intense international com-
petition for investments in undeveloped countries.
I111 part, loans are made, and these serve as pay-

ment for our exports. Also new industries are‘

{established in these backward territories. Rail-
lroads are built, sometimes with very little regard
lfor the actual needs of the territory. In general,
3”the export to undeveloped countries tends to
l become more an export of steel and machinery for
ithe setting up of new industrial enterprises; and
.there is a quick transformation of the natives,
sometimes little removed from savagery, to the
“civilized” status of wage-slavery.

As a guarantee for these loans and investments
goes control over the governments of the ex-
plo1ted..territori?es. Sometimes this is secured by
a direct conquest, but since this '0 imposes the
difficult burdens of foreign rule the preferred
method is to obtain the real control while main-
taining a nominally independent native despotism,
or even a sham democracy. China, East India,
Turkey, Morocco, Algiers, Tripoli, Persia, Tunis,
Egypt, Abysinnia, South and Central Africa,
Korea, Madagascar, The Phillipines, Haiti, San
Domingo, Costa Rica, Mexico, Ireland—all these
tell the same. story, with inessential variation in
the forms of imperialistic exploitation.

In the competition between the national groups.

-of capitalists the governments act as agents of

the capitalists. Diplomacy is used—-bluff and
threats——until the pressure of conflicting eco-
nomic interests compels war. First the govern-
ment acts as agent in making the foreign loans,
as in the case of the six-power,1oans to China; or-
the government bargains directly for investment
concessions. Later the government steps in to
enforce the interest and profit obligations by
might of arms. The flag. follows the dollar; the
army and navy follow the flag. As in the case of
Mexico, where our government intervened
to dictate the rates of taxation on oil lands held
by American, English and German capitalists. It

is this partnership between investment capital  

and governments which has come to be known
as finance-imperialism. It is the epoch of finance-
imperialism, with its unbearable oppressions of
militarism and incalculable destructiveness of life,
and waste of productive energies, which compels

the workers to organize themselves for the over- ‘

throw of the whole capitalist system.

Capitalist-imperialism, particularly in" the
rivalries for the trade routes to the Orient, threw
tens of millions of workers at each others’ throats
upon the battlefields of Europe. It was American
capitalistic interests which brought this country,
into the world war, at a cost of 100,000 dead and
twice as many maimed. Capitalist-imperialism let
loose the forces of destruction which are condemn-
ing tens of millions to starvation and which
threaten to engulf the whole world in the mire
in which Europe is desperately struggling.

‘The War and Revolution.
During four years of war the capitalist nations

engaged in the greatest orgy of destruction which .

humanity has ever known. The entire energy of
the nations was directed to producing the imple-
ments and ammunition which were poured out
in an incessant stream upon the battlefelds.
Hundreds of billions of dollars worth of w alth
were produced for instant destruction; the direct
expenditures alone have been calculated ' at
$370,000,000,000. An equal amount is represented
in property, destruction, loss of production, inter-

ruption to ‘trade, etc. The United States alone, in .

less than two years, paid out over 32 billions.

Such sums are beyond the grasp of the mind.   _
