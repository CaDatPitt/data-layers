among themembership, it, should be remembered that it is and was
the policy. of this Union that has carried us through SO many Out‘

,_ The history of the American
Labor movement shows that em-
ployers resist all attempts at or-
ganization.‘ of workers, in trade
unions and in practically every
case they do so under a smoke
screen of red baiting.

McCarran, who has been lab-
eled as the senonbrial voice of the
' Kennecott Copper Corporation, I
, firmly believe has been delegated
. to do this jobof union busting-for
Big Business. ~
This attaclé upon“ our Union is
-not designed_solely to rid us of

for world peace, which is primarily the stepping stone for security and
freedom from fear and want. " / ’ '

and working conditions in the production of metals, and the exchange
of this information, is vital to the welfare of our members.

The same-forces monopolize the industry in other countries. The
low wages and pitiful working conditions carried on by them ultimately
affect the economic welfare of the workers in this country.

PROOF OF THIS is today's conditionlin the lead-zinc. industry.
where prices havecollaplsed. Mines and smelters‘/are reducingforces
or closing completely because of high production of these n_ietal_s'in_
other countries and theimpossibility of our workers competing with
forced low wages in Africa and other countries mining this metal—-
also to the lack of domestic consumption inother than war industries.

Our association with unions of other nations has been referred

or weaken us into a state of com-
pany unionism, .
When Senator McCarran said
‘ that he "does not care about the
Supreme Court" then that should
_ be a clear—cut indication to all
honest American citizens that ‘he
himself is the one . who is Un-
‘ American.‘ _ A , I
Finally, I‘ would like to state
that the only effective way of fight-
ing this ‘Committee is the manner
~ in which’ we deal with the "em-
ployers. By maintaining unity in
our ranks and by kicking out
scabs and 'dLsrupte_rs. Labor unity
is essential to labor's defense:

knowledge of ,peoples of all countries that a program of a world at

merits whatever their ideals or constitutions may be.‘

Today the very word peace is foundation for the accusations of
degenerates like Matusow and Company as subversive or Communist.

I_ can think of no better way to express the policy of our union
than by the following quotation, which embodies everything that We

Bessemer Council
okays Utah reports

BESSEMER, Ala. '— The Alabama
Mine—Mill Council gave an enthusiastic
response to reports from three of the
District Five delegates who attended
the Mine—Mill political action confer-
ence in Salt Lake City. '

The delegates, T. R. Chambless of
Local 626, E. J. Erickson of Local 157,
and J. T. Vincent Sr. of Local 109,
told about both the political action
meeting and the McCarran committee
hearings which they attended while in
Salt Lake.

Discussion which followed the re-
ports highlighted the failure of the
McCarran committee to permit any,
cross-examination of the “friendly wit-
nesses” who had tried to smear Mine-
Mill and its leaders. The importance
of the right to cross-examine was

pointed. up-by recalling what had hap'- ’

pened in one of the trials “growinglout
of the Battle of’ Jonesboro.‘

IN THAT TRIAL, the city“ attorney
claimed he was‘ putting only “neutral”
witnesses on the stand, on the assump-
tion that Mine-Mill witnesses would

testify against, Steel and Steellwitnes_-

ses would testify against Mine-Mill,

One of these"socal1ed “neutral” wit-.
nesses was a man who had - just hap-
pened on the scene of the shooting as
he was returning home from work. The
witness testifie‘tl in such a manner as
to make it seem that Asbury Howard
and Horace ‘White were guilty.

But the Mine—Mill attorneys had a
chance todcross-examine this “neutral”

_ witness. In the course of the cross-ex-

amination, the witness admitted these.

i facts:

That he worked for a subs_idiary of

I TCI. That he wasa member of the

CIO Steelworkers Union. That he per-
sonally knew John Harper, one ofsthe
Steelworkers wounded in the shooting.
That John Harper went to see him after
the shooting. And that he had been
drafted as a witness by "the Steelwork-
ers. ‘

. THE CROSS-EXAMINATION made’

itpossible to prove, of course, that this
witness was by no means “neutral,”
but that he was strongly biased on the
side of the Steelworkers. His testimony
was therefore proven useless.

Butthe McCarran committee .didn’t

even let the7Mine-Mill know what the
. “friendly witnesses”

had testified,
much less permitting cross—examination

( Harvester ‘strike

CHICAGO, Ill.——Thirty thousand

members of the’ United Electrical

are gong into’ their 11th W-eek of '

strike against the giant International

Harvester Corporationfs’ attempt to‘

slash wages. . _ ,. .
Even as the Farm’ Equipment-UE

[workers held theirvpicket lines solidly_

~The election victory marked the
fifth chalked up this ybar against
UAW-CIO at International Harvester"
plants. _ ' '_  '
Gerald Fields, chairman of the

Farm. Equipment~UE Harvester Con- ‘

ference Board, said: “The Canton vic-
tory against the entire Company team
should again prove to Harvester man-
agement that their employees in the
farm implement plants are determined
to maintain their ‘union against any
and all attacks. ‘
‘‘‘Since the election issue was wheth-
er or not the Canton workers wanted
to take—-via UAW-CIO-—the 5-year
wage-cutter contract our union ‘has re-
jected in negotiations, it should also
serve notice on the company that they
will have to settle our strike real-
istically. That means a pay increase

and contract improvements instead of ’

pay cuts and *a contract with 15 years
of gains gutted out of it." i

of anti-union persecution” is seen .by
John Steuben, editor of _March of La-
bor, inwthe government move” insti-

. tuted October 24 to deprive him -of

— Pointing out that the suit specifically .

. charges him with alleged activities in-
cidental to the 1937 Steeltstrike, when
he was employed as organizer by the
CIO Steel Workers Organizing .Com-
mittee, Steuben declared: 7, '

“The charges arising out of ‘the steel

their leaders are subjected to a. new and
vicious kind of 'int7Imz'da.tz'on.”.

TO SUPPORT HIS CHARGE of

anti-union persecution, Steuben called
attention to his long record as a.
union organizer, not only for the CIO
but also, more recently, as secretary-

VANCOUVER, B. C.——Copper nego-

have be-en adjourned until ‘sometime

The shutdown threat is regarded as
of the‘ perennial species, flowering
briefly. whenever negotiations com-
mence, but it has hitherto been most

,_ frequently encountered up in '0 the

In’ reply to the wage proposals of

sixamendments to the existing agree— «

ment, eachiof which would mean a.

TRADE UN

One of the guest speakers at the Mine-M ill 48th convention in New

York was the distinguished scholar and historian, Dr. W. E. B. Dub_ois.
Our delegates were so impressed with his analysis of the inter-relations
of industry and workers around the world——of why the welfare of

- workers on other continents affects us——that many asked for the com-

graphed form. ‘

. S plete text of the ‘speech. This was supplied to delegates in mimeo-

THE UNION is reprinting Dr. Dubois’ address so that all mem-
bers may read it. It is in three sections, of which this is the last. ‘

Final paragraphs of the preceding section are repeated here, for

the sake of continuity. ‘

A T THE BEGINNING of the 19th

Century in Cape Colony, one of the A

four states forming, the Unionof South

' i Africa, all races had the right to vote.

_“

 
 
  
  

In the other three provinces they had
,-no vote. In 1926 Hertzog began to at-

tack the right of the natives. in Cape.

Colony to vote, until in 1936 they were

,dis-franchised, after having had the,

' vote for 80 years. Their names were

I transferred to a separate list where

they could elect‘ three white members

to represent them in a legislative body '

of 153 members.
‘Finally in 1950 all persons of South

_ Africa were. classified as white, native

or colored, and an attempt was made
to separate them completely except in
the case of servants and city "workers.

These in order. to move to work are _

ordered ‘to "carry as many as 16 dif-
ferent written passes.
9--‘South Africa has more arrests than
any civilized nation. Out of a total
population of 121/2 million, the Union
A of South Africa has’11/g millionvoters,
of whom 50,000 are colored and none

are native. It is now proposed to dis-
franchise the colored voters.I

NATURALLY . the _ Negroes «have
protested. Twenty-five years ago
Kadalie formed a trade union which
was caller‘ Communist but which strug-

.gl,ed bravely for Negro rights until
Kadalie was driven out. A

i In 1946 fifty-thousand Negro gold
' miners struck and were subdued by
machine guns, tear gas and hand gre-
nades. In 1949 a riot in ‘Johannesburg
drove the police out but they returned
with tear gas and arrested 600 .men
and women. The Negro South African
National Congressbrganized in 1921
‘has repeatedly and carefully organized
protests. _

This Congress recently said: “As is
well knvwn, the government through

A -its repressive policy of trusteeship and

segregation and through legislation
that continues to insult and degrade
the African people by depriving them
of fundamental human rights . . . has
categorically rejected our offer of co-
operation. The consequence has been
the gradual worsening of the social,
economic and political position of the
African people and arising tide of

racial bitterness andtension. The cu,-c

mulative effect this legislation has is

r to. crush the national organization of

the oppressed peoples, .~ to destroy the

economic position of the people and to

create a reservoir of cheap labor for

the farms and] gold mines; to prevent

the unity and development of the Afri-

can people toward full nationhood, and

, to, humiliate ‘them in a host of other
ways.”

"THE CONGRESS therefore deter-
mined to demand a change in these
laws ‘or to defy them beginning the

THE PRESENT cold war, the K0-

natives and Indians have been ar-
rested and imprisoned for defying
segregation, On the other hand, the

white people’ of Africa areinot the sole ,.
_ exploiters. In 1949 the Union of South

Africa received 90 million dollars as a
loan from the United States‘, and the
Wall Street Journal predicts. that in
the next five years the‘ United States
will furnish a billiomand a half dollars
for South African mining and indus-
try. _ _ .

The Morgan and Rockefeller inter-
ests have been investing in South

"Africa for a long time. The Ford inter-

ests began investing 25 years ago. Gen-
eral Motors has. “recently built a 20
million dollar’ plant there.

this‘ theory has been proven false.

S But there is another and more funda-

modern world must consider. . They

J must get rid of the ancient idea that

certain kinds of labor, especially that
of miners and smelters and those who
do the hard and dirty work in steel
mills and building operations and par-

’ ticularly hired help in homes and on

farms—that this kind of work is in it-

cial condemnation and low wage.

to be avoided and regarding escape, 

from the status of laborer as the main.

object of their’ efforts, through trade

. unions. ~

THIS BRINGS US face to face with
a fundamental ‘contradiction. The hard

and dirty work of the world has got to S

be done. The better it is done, the more
carefully’ and effectively, the bette
the world will be. _‘ '

Whatever work is necessary and

beneficial should be performed be-

, cause and only because the world needs

it and the‘ reward of the laborer 

should be what he, needs in order to be
a healthy, intelligent and well-rounded

man, no ‘more, no less. Unnecessary’  *
‘work should not be permitted and re-

ward beyondreasonable needas well as 

starvation wage should be illegal.

' What, then, the World ‘wants and
what gradually it is comingto realize. 1

as its ideal, is a distribution of the

necessary work of the "world among ,
men carefully prepared in mind andf
* body to do‘ this work and to_do this. ‘

work for the benefit of a better and’
higher manhoodand not simply as

their sole means of survival. _ ‘
When this stage is reached, there‘

I must belno social degradation or com-

pulsory poverty, ignorance and disease.
attached to the performance of neces-
sary work. Because, indeed, there are
singular likenesses

ly rewarded. , ‘

Between the dentist and the miner,
for instance, there is no fundamental
difference. They both dig and extragt,

but the one is given education, train-
ing and a reward which furnishes him.

leisure to enjoy life, with recognition

from hissfellow-men, while therlmineri S

kinds of work which are very different-  '

The lawyer comes in contact with"  A

crime and shame more closely;than the fl

scavenger, but while the professional
man can attend the opera, the lowest

of the workers hardly gets a chance to /7 

sleep. ‘

So men must come to realize that it p
is, not the kind of work that a man _ .
.does which should‘ settle his ‘soci-al;,..-.j ‘

status, but theuiecessity of the work,

work deserves.

WHEN BY INVENTION and ma-
chine hard toil, lifting and digging,’
and repulsive conditions can be avoided,

the results of such invention should go, 
: to all workers and not be. the monoply’ ‘
of the few. The result of lessened-need '

of toil should not be unemployment but
better paid work forthe mass. Educa-

tion for all; higher training for the"
gifted; leisure for human beings, is-:_M

possible now and where these are lack-

ing something is wrong with our in- 5

telligence and organizagon.

This ideal is abroad in the world,
but it is being held back and kept down

by the status of colonial peoples who  A 
have been, more than workers in civil- '  V
ized lands, oppressed and distorted by 7
"poverty, ignorance, ‘and disease. No 

fight for the eventual improvement of
the workers in the United States,

cessful until they -cease to be pulled

‘er.,i,McCdrran show hits theroad

GREAT FALLS, Mont.——Senator. McCarran's Salt Lake City show
has gone on the road. Part of it, anyway. “The star “witness,” Harvey
Matusow, hasbeen on a speaking tour in. Montana.

Most of our churches, the Boy Scouts, the Farmers’ Union, and

the YWCA are "Communist-infiltrated.” That's what the man says.
' He should know. He knew about a 1950 “Communist-directed”

copperstrike, and he was‘ the only person in the country who did -
know about it. Must be an expert. ’ ’

Here's how the Great Falls Tribune reported Matusow’s speech

a in the Great Falls High‘ School:

‘ “His appearance’ was sponsored by

the American Legion——on‘e of the few .

organizations which he did not accuse

1 . of being Communist-infested-—the Jun.-'

 Qior Chamber of Commerce and the
p, Speakers Bureau. " -

, “He cited cases to show how religion

0 in th%‘United States is being used by

the Communists. He said the govern-

ment is plagued by Reds and the press,

radib, television, movies employ many .

Communists. ‘

“ ‘The Sunday section of the New ,

 York Times alone h.as Z26 dues-paying

 ' Communists.‘ he declared. ‘On the edi- =

H torial and research staffsof Time and
,_ Life magazines ‘are 76 hard-core Reds.
' The New York bureau ofthe Associated
Press ‘has 2.5.’_ "’ T S ,
“He said in order to get a job as a
‘radio writer or director in New York

_ I . _ ,
city, ‘you must be a member of the
Communist party.’ A T

.“In New York City, he dec'lared,i500
high school teachers are dues-paying
Communists. The situation‘ ‘is similar
in Los Angeles, San’, Francisco, Mil-

waulcee——‘ancl'maybe- in Great Falls,’ he ' _

asserted. .
“Heiclaimed ‘every major-college in

the country’ has at least bne Commu-

nist member. ‘ ’ '

“Some organizations he_.said were

Red-infiltrated : Columbia Broadcasting
System, State Department, Boy Scouts,
YWCA, USO, United Nations, Voice of
Americaand Farmers Union.

“He declared most churches are Com-
munist-infiltrated and when a "woman
in the audience asked if there were-any
that ‘aren't, he said ‘I .don’t believe
the Catholics or Mormons are’ "

p This is the man who was taken seriously by Pat McCarran as a
“witness” before a committee of the U. S. Senate! 

7. ' » Partsof the Matusow speechvwere describedas “dastardly” by ‘Leo

Graybill, Montana Democratic national committeeman, who added that

people like Matusow‘,promote Communism ‘by spreading false state- 

ments, defaming character ‘and insisting that too much education is a

cause of‘iCommunism; , \

What would you’ think if the head
- of Kennecott, or Phelps Dodge, or In-
"‘ the-rnational Nickel, was invited ‘to our
