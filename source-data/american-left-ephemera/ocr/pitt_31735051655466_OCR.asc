In our group in Springfield, we seek to un-

Atderstand better how institutions and social

8truotures.shape our minds and lives. We have
begun examining our own lives as well as look-
ing at different cultures.
By studying anthropology we have learned

that the real difference between the sexes is
not between male and female, but between the

‘ dominated and dominating sexes. The dominating

’sex (whether male or female) is usually inde-
pendent, more intellectual, physically strong-
er and larger, while the dominated sex is de-
pendent, domestic, sensitive, and physically

‘weaker and smaller. American women have the

latter characteristics because of generations
of conditioning and oppression in a patriarchal
society..Our history/as women shows us how dif-
ferently we have lived and grown in other soc-
ieties.

As matriarchs we have been the dominating
sex, and we have done the work while the men
took care of our homes and children. As Amag
zons we have built empires, ruled and fought~
for by women alone. As witches we have defied
both Church and state, rebelling against the
patriarchal Christian status quo. We have
helped build beautiful societies where the sex-
es lived in more equalized, communal, and free
relationships with each other. we have done ev-
erything we have been told was impossible.
(Helen Diner. Mothers and Amazons:The First
Feminine Histor"v—of Culture. N.Y.:Julian,1965.*)

Our Eulture hides these strong and beauti-
ful images from us. To bolster the oppressive
tocial order we have been given a false series
of images through our religions and media---
images pounded into our heads so often that we
have tried to believe them.

‘Our Judaeo—Christian religions are all pat;

.riarchal--with their male God, male Savior,

and male prophets and disciples. The Bible is
full of images of strong men and weak women.
Women like Mary who are held up as ideals are
self-effacing and supportive of their men. we
are told/to obey our husbands (Ephesians 4:22;
4:25) and not to speak in the churches (I Cor-
inthian 13:33-13:35)——we are told we are un—‘
clean and must be purified by ma1e—priests
(Leviticus 12 & 15:19-15:80). When the Bible
mentions a strong woman she is a Jezebe1——an
evil figure who is damned unless she is subdued
and converted like Mary Magdalene.

.These images are destructive ones for us to
believe and we refuse to believe in them any-
more. We know why the Pope is a man and why he
is against birth Control. We know why nearly
all our priests and rabbis are men, and we knob
why millions of our sisters have been tortured
and murdered as witches. We know that our reli-
gions have tried to keep us down so that we
will not destroy our malemdominated social or_
der. '

Advertising-filled American media, in its
drive to manipulate us into buying more, has
pounded a similar set of unreal concepts into
our minds. Magatines, newspapers, t.v.'S, radi-
os and billboards display a changing pattern
of,roles for us to live up to——roles based on
possessions and appearances. The media tries to
teach us to think of beauty in terms of its own
narrow standards of young, white "beautiful"
women whose lives revolve around their husbands,
children and lovers. _

We come in a wonderful variety of shapes,
sizes, colors and features, but we are told that
somehow we must all manage to look the same.
This helps to destroy any positive self-image
we might have by alienating us from our natural
physical beings. We disguise ou r bodies from
ourselyes as well as from others by our expen-
sive false eyelashes, lipsticks, hair rinses,
unstable shoes, and pointed bras. Our posses-
sions are our new and false identities-—ident—
tities based on media images——identities based
on things we have bought. _ _ _

The media has helped to make us materialistic,
object—oriented, and insecure. The insecurity
comes from feeling the uncomfortable gap between
ourselves and the media roles we try to live up
to, This distance can make us miserable until
we learn that beauty and reality come in the
same forms we do. We are real and beautiful——
it is the media that is false and ugly. We Can't

live up to media images because they aren't%w'
meant to be lived up to--they are meant to be
the carrot-happiness dream, held before our eyes
and ears to lead us into stores and up to the
cash registers. These manipulative images were
created by businessmen to increase their profits
and were never meant to portray our realities.
Media especially for women (Cosmopolitan,

Harpers' Bazarr) used to be controlled and pro-
duced by women. The images of these media empha-
sized women who had lively minds, interesting
lives and a will to live for themselves. After
World War II this branch of the media was tak-
en over by men, and the emphasis was switchedi
to women‘who were more selr—negating, who lived
vicariously through their men and children, and
who confined their lives and interests to their
homes. We reject all these negative views of
ourselves, and we will not be fooled by them

any longer. (Bett Friedan, The Feminine Myst-
igue. Dell, 1963.

We realize how much we have been manipulated
and degraded by our religions and media, and how
unfree and unhappy they have made us. We must
now create our own freeing images of appearance
and behavior, breaking out of all the old con-
fining roles and concepts. We must look at our-
selves to see gur realities, and stop letting
anti-women institutions put their lies into our
heads.

YOUNG WOMEN

America is obsessed with "identity" and find-
ing one's self. We believe this is largely due
to the fact that children are not allowed to
develop fr6?lY, Continually pushing out in what-
ever directions they desire. They are psycho1_
ogically and emotionally crippled by the arti-
ficial definitions imposed on them according to
their sex. From the moment a girlmchild is wrap-
ped 1n.a pink blanket in the delivery room, and
a boy in a blue, they are treated differently
from each other. Some of the treatment is overt,
some is subtle, but parents have quite definite
attitudes in realtion to sex. The girl tends to
be cuddled and pampered more. The boy is taught
to assert himself when he wants Something, to
be more aggressive. (H. Barry III, M.K. Bacon,

x I.L. Child. "A crossecultural survey of some
sex differences in socialization," Journal of
gggormal and Social Psychology, 1957, 55, 527- I

’Bbe put into the ac

They are given different toys to play with:
the girl gets dolls, miniature kitchens and "
makeup kits (idealizing the mother—home-domes-
ticity image); the boy gets trucks, planes,
mechanical and action toys (encouragin him in
turn to be mechanical and constructive . If a
girl still persists in being explorative, pull-
ing off her doll's arm to see how it works, she
is scolded and told that that's her baby and
she doesn't want to hurt it. If a boy manages
to get hold of a doll, he is called a sissy and
that carries all kinds of implications as to his
"ndrmalcy" or sexual preferences. (Unless he is
satisfied with a doll now on the market for
boys-—it is called GI Joe and is not meant to
be cuddled, but to play war with.) So she is
taught to be passive, quiet, unmechanical, moth-
erly——all her supposed natural characteristics
of being female, and he is taught the opposite.
(S. Goldberg & M. Lewis. "Play behavior in the
yearold infant: early sex differences", Child

Development, 1969, ﬁg, 21-31.)

  

These roles into which children are social-
ized find reinforcement everywhere. In school-

'~books (in most all books) men are depicted as

the Workers and real support of society, women

as merely helpers and homemakers. The girl learns
to value men above all else——what she wants most
is to get married. The boy learns to value his
future work--what he wants most is power over

his life.

By the time they reach high school age, girls
and boys have been forced into molds that they
couldn't define. The molding started before they
were able to control themselves and their lives.
By the time they are old enough for control,
the patterns are set.

‘When we enter high school we have little
choice as to which of the already defined roles
to assume. Our economic background determines
which track we'll be put in. If we come from a
lower economic bracket we'll be put into the
lower working class tracks——general, trade, or
commercial--in Springfield these tracks are so
well-defined that they are separate schools.

If we are from theaupper economic bracket we'll
emic track. Once we are put

poor jobs, and for 0st women, marriage. The
-priviledged few from the academic tracks go on

into these—tracks,

.to college, which for men is a ticket to a high-

er—paying meaningless job, and for women to a
higher-paying marriage. If a woman must work
and can find a job, it is lower pay and worse
work. So there we are in high school, preparing
for our limited future. ’

how to be passive and be manipulated while the
boy learns how to manipulate. It is okay for a
boy to be academic if he is in a college-bound
or white-collar track. Otherwise, if he tries

to be academic in the other tracks, his mascu-
linity is questioned (for him there is then the
exciting possibility of being an athlete).

we all want to be accepted, liked by our
peers as psychology puts it. There are differ-
ent roles for acceptance. Which one suits me
best? Since I'm a girl, I'll most likely try
first for popularity through dating--who I am
makes little difference: what counts is who asks
me out and how much. There are unspoken laws
governing who I can date, as well as all my
other social contacts. The sexual standards
differ—-some groups allow more sexual "freedom"--
that is, the girl is supposed to go farther——
not too far to endanger her reputation-—and the
boy is supposed to want as much sex as he can
get. The whole sexual experience ends up being
sterile. No one really knows about sex, and the
actual feelings of the couple matter little.
But very few of us make it in this role, nor
are those who do very satisfied with it. Another possibility is to devote myself to
a cause. Religion used to be popular, but now
it is civil rights or politics. Although it is
quite important and necessary for this devotion
I can't be too active if I don't have a self
to be active with. Too many of us spend our
lives fighting other people's battles, and we
are never able to see our own oppression. We
can't understand the situation of others until
we understand our own and how they are related.

There are plenty of opportunities in school,
things to keep us busy. We are taught how to
suffer through a five—day work week at a mean-
ingless job. At 9 o'clock we're supposed to be
interested in history, at 10 it's math, at 11
English... Yes, we're kept busy, so busy that
we never get to find out who we are,

One of the main advantages a woman college
student has over her non-student sisters is
that, for the moment, she is still public. She
has, in her classes and in her contacts on cam-
pus, the opportunity to express her ideas pub-
licly to males and females of all ranks. In
good schools, or at least in good seminars, she
not only has the opportunity\to express her
ideas, but she is expected to do so, and on an
equal basis with men.

Despite the fact that most schools continue
to have a blatantly double standard in their
social regulations, social restrictions on wo-
men ironically free them in one way. Since
many of us live in dorms where we cannot enter-
tain men privately, most social intercourse of
necessity takes place in public. We congregate
in coffee houses, bars, movies, or at parties
of the privileged few with apartments. We are
constantly forced into contact with a variety
of other men and women. We may long for the sup-
posed peace and security of an uninterrupted
relationship with one man. We may be searching
frantically for the satisfaction and self—iden-
tification which society has tried to convince
us we can get by ministering to the needs of a
man. But the rules delay that process. The re-
sult may be a miserable, nameless frustration
for us, but our belief in the existence of sex-
ual equality and in our own independent poten-
tials as human beings remain largely unchallen-
ged.

A fair amount of pressure to conform to the
prevalent images of women in the society may.
be exerted on us by our male co—students. Often
in co—ed schools the male students label cert-‘
ain female counterparts with a general epithet
like "grind", meaning that these women study
too hard, get all the good grades and thus make
it harder on the men. The men, of course, have
more need for those good grades, considering
the necessities of getting a good job and stay-
ing out of the army.Thus the women are held
responsible for prejudicing the very lives of
their male c nterparts by working hard. But
we are still public and able to argue against

such pressures. A

Many of us female college students go through
a training process at college which leads us
(without realizing what has happened) to accept
and rationalize a position of.inequality and
powerlessness for ourselves in society. It is
at college that the liberal tenets of "post-
war" America get hammered home. Everyone learn-
ed—-long before reaching college age-—that ours
is a classless society; that as free individuals
in a free society, success and happiness are
the results of individual integrity and hard
work; and that failure in our personal lives
is a calamity for which we as individuals are
responsible.

Later in our education (and especially in
college) we come to understand a new part
of that reality about our society--although
it rarely is allowed to do damage to the old

vision. We find out that for some people in
our society--for Blacks, for the poor, for the
alienated--these cornerstones of individual
success and failure don't always work. For
them individual initiative clearly is not en-
ough to overcome the weight of their oppressi-
on in our society. These people have to be
,"helped" to the take-off point where they can
compete with the rest of us. But priorities
have to be maintained; the business of the so-
ciety must go on as usual.

 

Since the business of this society is alrea-
dy the province of men, what better arrangement
could there be, but that the women should come
along in the aftermath to sweep up after a re-
lentless and sometimes callous world. It's a‘
plan of some beauty because it accomplishes
so much all at once. By putting the women to
work as social servants the possibility is
suggested that America can solve its social
problems without breaking stride, and at the
same time women can make a valuable contribu-
tion to keeping everything "functioning smooth-

ly". Social service is used to cover up the in
humanity of the system. Women are the nurse-
maids of an ailing system.

One of the most unhappy results of this pro-
cess is that thousands and thousands of college
women, longing for some alternative to span the
gap between their traditional role as wife and
mother and their desire to be active agents in
the world, file into the schools of education,
social work and nursing. Here we learn about
the overwhelming pain of disadvantaged people.
Here we learn to be properly thankful that we
weren't born hungry or Black. Here we learn to
ask no further questions about the conditions
of our own lives as women. Here we abandon the
undefined hope that, as educated women, we
might have an effect on the decisions and dir-
ections of our society. Here we assume the tra-
ditional image of women. 1

Those of us who end up choosing a social
service career after graduation may find out
immediately that the joke is on us when we try
to get a job. In many places, and Springfield
is one of them, there are more qualified B.A.'s
(especially in the area of teaching) than there
are jobs. And it is becoming increasingly diff-
icult for women fresh out of school to get such
jobs——when there is unemployment among B.A.'s,
women are the first ones to feel it.

Some of us don't immediately get swept into
those social service channels in college, but
rather turn to them after graduation when we
see the other alternatives are closed off. Some
of us may have planned to continue academic
work in graduate school, only to discover there

suddenly was no room for us in our chosen field'

or profession. To start with, we discovered
that women have to have a much higher grade av-
erage than men to get into the same graduate
school. The only graduate schools with large
percantages of women are those of education,
social work, nursing, and other social service
occupations-—in all these fields there is a
glut of women. .

A large number of college women, believing
in the myth of a liberal education, (that is,
going to college to learn something rather than
to train for a job) take no teaching credits.
Perhaps these women do not do especially well
in school. These women file into the insurance
companies, work also as secretaries, or clerks
in banks and department stores. The work they
face is of numbers and forms, divorced from the
intellectual framework of their college years.

Like their sisters in the social service,
their only plausible escape from frustrating
and often meaningless jobs is to the myth of
marriage.

The Mother

Unsatisfied and lonely in the midst of such
an arrangement she will probably decide to
have children. For most women having children
is a foregone conclusion anyway. Regardless of
how much a woman may struggle to put off child-
bearing, all the pressures of friends, family,
religion, education, and media push her to the
decision to begin a family. Often the absence

iof any real choice in the matter is more bla-

tant than that however.

Huge numbers of women become pregnant acci-
dentally, without ever confronting the ques-
tion of wanting to have children. Contracept-
ive devices and information are not readily
avaliable even to the married woman. In addit-
ion, most women, especially young women whose
sexual experience is limited, are made to feel
ambivalent about the use of contraceptives.

Contributing to that uncertainty are all
the contradictory judgements and misinforma-
tion which filter down to a woman from her re-
ligion, family and so forth. In addition,
since sexual intercourse is a sometimes guilt-
ridden, supposedly spontaneous and male-init-
iated experience for most women, the thought
of planning ahead for it is rather repugnant.
And finally, even for those women who know
they want to use contraceptives, there are
plenty of difficulties in getting them. The
office visit to a doctor costs $15 to $20 by
itself. And beyond that many women anticipate
the embarrasment and degredation of that visit
and put it off until it is too late.

Too often then, having children is a situa-
tion of rationalizing a fait accompli. '
However a woman may arrive at her first
pregnancy, she enters into a phase of her life
that is vastly different from anything she has

ever experienced before. To her husband and
most of the people around her, she becomes a
special person, the embodiment of the miracle
of life, literally "pregnant with meaning".
Many women feel they are their most beautiful
and healthiest selves when they are pregnant.
Most of the hard, glossy standards of beauty
are lifted from her. Her role as a sexual ob-
ject is temporarily set aside. Often the sex-
ual demands of her husband become gentler since

 

 

She is the living proof of his virility And
although his previous advances on her ma not
have considered her feelings in the mattgr he
probably shrinks from sexually mistreating’her
now.

. '80 for Hagy women the pressure is off dur-
ing most of bh9lT pregnancy and they are allow-
ed to bloom in a new soft and protective light,

Except perhaps for that new little uneasi-
ness that blossoms into uncontrollable fear as
tge t}me of del1VeTY approaches. For the birth

of the miseducation and manipulation of the
American woman. She is systematically stupe-

horror stories about birth. Unless she is Cor-
nered by an advocate of natural childbirth,
She Will probably never be given the informa_
tion necessary to counteract her fear. Her

questions with a pat on the head and a "Don't

image of an anesthetized woﬁﬁn surrounded by
antiseptic strangers, strapped to a table, to-
tally out of control, screaming with fearsand
pain, 1S unfortunately not far from the actual
experience of many women. “

Awakening hours later the woman may retain
only a vague recollection of her ordeal-per-
haps only enough to be thankful that her doc-
tor was there to "take care of everything".

At any rate, she is soon confronted with a
crushing responsibility from which there is no
escape.

However much a woman may convince herself
that her firstborn child will not rule her
life, she sooner or later discovers that it
does. Everything about her life gets rudely
jerked into a new order. Drafts and noises and
room temperature and housepets and soap brands
have to be watched with a new vigilance. Meals
and housework are rearranged, evenings out are
abandoned. Trips out of the house anywhere are
suddenly accompanied with laborious preparaa
:ion+—collecting the bottles, pacifier, blan-
kets, diapers, car bed, rattle, baby food,
powder, Desitine-so that it is usually far eas-
ier and more pleasant to just stay at home.

 

But mother's sleep is perhaps the worst cas-
ualty. Painfully aware of her child's help-
lessness and of the fact that she alone bears
the total responsibility for the nurturing and
protection of her child, the mother goes for
months, perhaps years, sleeping with one ear
open, hearing every cough and cry in the night.
Her husband, on the other hand, quickly devel-
ops an ability to sleep through the baby's
cries, once the pattern of the wife's total
responsibility is established.

A mother's responsibility not only affects
her sleep but her whole life. Suddenly the
pressure is on. She must be strong, cheerful,
encouraging, patient, always right, and must
always set a good example. She must teach her
child how to care for herself, she must keep
her clean, safe, happy and healthy. To do this‘
a mother must think in terms of her child every
minute of the day and night. It is easy to see
how women become so dependent on their children
_§nd why they end up living through them.

 

As a result, strains soon appear in the re-

'lationship of man and wife as well. The wife
‘is immediately returned to her pre-pregnancy

status of help-mate and sexual servant. Torn
by diverging responsibilities between husband

sand child, confused about her own identity, ov-

er-worked and over-tired, and totally depends
ent economically on her husband, the woman has
reached a new low in her ability to control her

‘own life.

Capitalism offers one escape from the home
for a woman whose husband is present and earn-
ing enough to support their family: a paying
job--providing she can make arrangements to
care for her children and still keep her hus-
band's house running smpothly. A job Will 8lV9
her the extra money she needs to buy the pro-
ducts that TV and the magazines have told her
she needs. This wife's job will be supplement-
ary to her husband's. Her position as a worker<
will remain secondary to that of domesticd
slave, lest she endanger the stability and
"happiness" of her family. d”' n

But of the entire female labor force, one-
fourth of us are married women who are the sole
support of their family. These women are work-
ing because they must, not because they have
"nothing better to do". 38.3% of the female
working force live with their husbands; One
might think that these women don“t.need to
work because their husbands support them. But
looking at the income statistics on these fam-
ilies. it is clear that these women, along with

1. The BLS Moderate Standard of living for a family of 4 is
$9,076. The median income for a family with a female head is
4,294.

2. The median income for family with a male head, wife not

in practice it is a good deal grimmer.

There are everyday disadvantages that don't
appear in numbers that make the life difficult
for any woman who must earn a living. Finding
a decent Place to live can be almost impossi-
ble. Landlords are hesitant to rent to single
girls for they are thought to be undependable,
messy and noisy. A woman with children must

can she pay the rent? And how many of us who

‘°But the biggest hardship is the job we must
take if we are to survive. Of the jobs open to
women, most are boring, menial labor, despite

jobs). In addition we are made to feel inferi-
or in a score of ways every day. Two working
women, with slightly varied jobs, have des-
cribed their working experiences below. Their
wages and functions differ, but their hard-
ships are similar to each other and to those of
the housewife.

-Sherri

. I am on a level that falls between the low-
level office clerk and the higher paid college
graduate. I am paid less than a clerk but I am

worker. As a dirty worker I'm repeatedly under
fire. I do the bosses‘ dirty work, ordering
around the employees. Then the workers turn.
on me because I'm the visible enemy.

For being willing to take all this I earn
enough money to pay my rent, buy my food, and
if I'm careful, manage an occasional movie. I
could never afford to support a family on what
I make. I have my job because no man would work
for my salary.

I realize now that single women who have
graduated from high school are a dime a dozen.
We are, indeed, surplus labor. We need a live-
lihood, not a career—-we expect money, not pow-
er. We won't demand a pay raise because we have
been made to lower our economic worth. And $50
a week is better than nothing.

In the end the job ceases to offer us any-
thing but a chance to get a man. So finally
the job serves to throw us back into the homes,
and the disillusionment is complete when we
realize that as housewives we are doing the
same thing we did at "at work". The only diff-
erence is we have got the "perfect man" who we
find is just fulfilling the role that our boss
used to fill..

But for all the times I have tried to speak
about what I think, to really help people, I

find that I can't overcome my labels. As "state

ded to the state by my salary. People who must
meet with me are reluctant to tell me the truth
because they know (and I find) that I will prob-
ably have to betray them someday by using the
information entrusted to me by them. I can't
promise that in a duel between them and the
state I will stick by them, for that would mean
forfeiting my job.

Yet my other label is that of a woman. I am
seen as sympathetic, kind and helpful. But it
is especially difficult to convince people that
I as a woman can be strong, dependable and
trustworthy.

My job is, essentially, just a series of
rules and regulations. I can go see people and
talk to them about my ideas, but when it comes
to doing something for them I can't. "Doing
something" means filling out forms and waiting
for the higher authorities to find the time to
review them. The state is not working for the
benefit of the people; legislators are not el-
ected on the basis of what welfare recipients
want, but more often by promising to deny those
wants.

But the state has instilled many fears in_
the people through investigations and inquiries.
You learn not to ask for help unless you want
to get into trouble. And the endless paperwork
makes getting help impossible.

WOMEN ON WELFARE

. ne of the most oppressed groups of women
in this coun1"y is the women on welfare. We are
poor, many of us are from minority groups’and
suffer from racial prejudice. And some of us
can't even speak English. A good number of us
are on welfare because we have lost a husband
either from divorce, desertion, or death. Some
of us are "illegitimate" mothers. Whatever the
circumstances, we are women who suddenly found
ourselves without any means of support and no
hope of earning it. Women with very tangible
children who must be fed and clothed. The num-
ber of women who find themselves in this pre-

ppdicament is growing every year.

Of the nine million people on welfare in this
country, over five million are children, The
majority of the other four million are mothers
and other unemployables such as the aged and
disabled. The interesting thing is that over
85% of the welfare families are headed by women.
In Springfield the figure is even higher. Why
is it the women who are always forced to go on
welfare? The answer is found in the status of
women in this country.

Girls are taught from the time they are born
to depend on others for their livelihood, Few
have the educational background to provide for
themselves. Those that do rarely have the time
or energy after dealing with childrearing, 4
household and other routine tasks all day. For
us, the poor women, there is no hope of hiring
someone to do these things. We are caught at
home with no chance of ever being able to sup-
port ourselves. WOMEN HAVE A STATUS OF DEPEN;
DENCE THAT DOES NOT CHANGE WHETHER THEY DE-
PEND ON ONE MAN OR ON THE STATE.

One of the biggest problems in talking.to
women on welfare is our reluctance to fight"
or even speak up for ourselves. We have never
had any effective power and never expect to.
We have neither made nor participated in most
of the decisions that have shaped our lives.
These decisions were made'for us by our fath-
ers and then our husbands--for example, where
we would live and how much we would have to
live on. Now these decisions.are being made
for us by the state. We continue to be passive
about our lives and continue to fear the pow-
era that rule._Although some organized work

has been done (i.e. the winter clothes allow-§
ance), many more welfare women could be brought
together if we felt more aggressive. .
The present welfare organizers in Spring-
field, as in most other places, are men. A
man has the tendency to promote feelings of
dependence, since he is a man organizing
women. We are much less likely to fight for
reforms that can get us 9;; welfare since we
are still in the position of depending upon a
man, still feeling incompetent to support our;
selves. Moreover, men who organize welfare a‘
women have a tendency to accentuate the work V
on reforms for fairer budgets, lenient rules,

‘ise hope of ending the situation. They can-
not understand our situation--they are neither
on welfare, nor a woman. Winning a winter
clothes allowance doesn't make welfare any

Reforming the WIP (Work Incentive Program)
so that it serves the people might. WIP has
been newly voted in in Massachusetts. The
program, in a nutshell, means that women on
welfare who have school-aged children will
be forced, if they do not volunteer, to place
their children in day-care centers or with
babysitters so the women can be trained for
jobs. The money that these women earn will be
deducted from their regular checks. On the
surface this may sound like a possible answerg
There are several dangerous points to the prq-
gram, however. First, we have no control oven
the form of these daycare centers and yet we
are forced to place our children in them.
Second, the jobs that we will be trained for
are thewsame old poor-paying jets that will
keep us at the same financial level, espec-
ially with our pay being deducted. So we are *
left in the same position, but with more to
do. The worst part of this is that we will be
forced to enter the program. What kind of de-
hocracy is that? ,

With a woman organizer we could take steps
to prevent this program from going through
and could perhaps demand a program which
would include-controllable daycare centers
which would be available but not mandatory.
Other work could also be undertaken so that
perhaps welfare would no longer be a trap,
but instead an optional way of supporting-omzs
selves, or-a temporary pain. More important,
‘with ohe of the wel re_wonen as our leader,
women would see that we are capable of more
than the'system prescribes.

We have not been allowed to search for a
healthier alternative for our sexual lives.
Young Women want to deal with such questions.
The seminar series will provide the opportun-
1 y.

We see such a program operating outside of
the school system. We hope to convince one of
the area churches to provide us with regular
meeting facilities. Eventually we would like
to establish a woman's place where such pro-
8?amS Vould 80 0n. as Well as research, women's
library, meetings, and perhaps daycare—-all in
one location for women only.

Implicit in writing such a paper is the re-
cognition that a movement for the 1iberation
of women from the myths and roles that confine
us and leave us powerless must be built. The
job of bringing women together isn't a job
easily done. We have been separated from each
other for generations, as we have been separ-
ated from the sources of power in our society
Bringing us together is not a process which
can be blueprinted from start to finish.

Even the question of where to begin looms
,large. Do we find and attack the real power-
holders in America? Do we point out that the
same men whose interests forced us into the
war in Vietnam also control the quality of
our lives at home? Do we attack issues like
contraception, abortion, legal rights and job
inequalities? Or do we build small discussion
groups of women--groups of friends and neigh-
bors talking about their personal lives and
immediate needs? The Women's Movement will
use all these approaches. '

A variety of educational methods and styles’
will be used. Some seminars will have a lect-
ure format with presentations by area doctors
and nurses, and women from our group who have
particular experiences (such as with natural
childbirth). Other sessions will be informal
discussions in which we can all talk about
our questions and problems. We plan to include.
films and exhibits, models and resource mater-
ials from nursing and medical schools. We plan
to develop a good library. We will give current
reports on our research into area medical fac-
ilities and doctors, including the "where" and
"how" of getting help with contraceptives and
abortions.

We intend that this sex seminar series will
be more than an educational service. Hopefully
many of the women who participate will get in-
volved in the on-going struggle to change the
patterns and roles which women have been forced
into

 

Our Women's Liberation group plans to devote
special attention in the next months to a sex
seminar series. Hopefully it will raise a var-
iety of issues and bring together women from
many social and-economic situations. We have
discovered young women of high school and col-
lege age have been given little or no informa-
tion about their own anatomy and physiology.
They have little information about sexuality,
pregnancy. childbirth, contraception, and ab-
ortion. They have had no opportunity to discuss
America's contradictory standards of sexual be-
havior, the conflicts we feel between the Vic-
torian moral woman and the playboy plaything.

 

Work on abortion is already underway. We
are doing research and providing women with
information about what's avaliable in this ar-
ea. We are searching for doctors and clergy
who are sympathetic to the fact that women
should be able to control their own bodies.

We want help in putting together a referral
service which is reliable and medically safe.
Much additional work must be done around the
issues of abortion and contraception--and it
must be public. Agitation must continue at the
local and state levels to abolish the laws
"limiting" abortion and contraception.

We see the seminar series leading into an
attack on the medical power structure in the
Springfield area. Most people in America can't
get adequate medical care. This can no longer
be tolerated. The interests of our medical sys-
tem have little to do with the health of the
American population. This system exists to the
detriment of virtually everyone. But it is par-
ticularly a problem for women. Responsibility
for maintaining the health of family members
falls almost entirely to the mother. She must
cope with illness, know what to do when no'doce
tor will make a house call or when the doctor's
only advice is to "give him an aspirin.and call
me in the morning". She deals with the tragic
results of too few doctors, too high fees, and
nonexistent medical facilities.—

A woman is not given credit for her own men-
tal abilities: she can't be "entrusted" by her
doctors with any information about what's going
on. Tests are done, shots .are administered,
treatments are given—- all in an atmosphere of
black magic and expertise.. She's lucky if she
finds out what's wrong before she is efficient3
ly whisked out of the office.

In addition, women have special medical prob-

lems, particularly relating to childbearing.

A woman's health is seriously endangered by
repeated pregnancies, by abortions, certain
contraceptives, by vaginal, uterin,/and-urinary
infections. Her health is endangered by gener-
al fatigue and emotional exhaustion, besides
the results of culturally induced problems

such as sexual abuse, rape, frigidity, and unb
fulfilling sexual relations. Yet, at best,~
she receives only partial and inadequate treat-
ment for such_problems;

 

, As women we are enraged that such a system
is allowed to function. We are researching to
find out who—— in Springfeild, at regional and
at national levels-- benefits from such a
system. We intend to publicize our findings
and to mobilize a movement to attack the exist-
ing medical structures and propose alternatives
Doctors and medical institutions must realize?
that they can't continue to help oppress women
by refusing us information and services vital
to our lives. Educational institutions should
also be attacked for their muddle—headed refus-
al tooprovide young wome with realistic infor-
mation about their ownxbodies.

. ,Such actions can take many forms. We could
boycott abusive drug firms and druggists. We

-could refuse to pay unreasonable fees to doctor
"and hospitals. We could agitate at the area

hospitals for changes in hospital policies. We
could set up alternative medical structures,

’such as inexpensive community health clinics.

p so in order is an attack on the health in-
surance plans of private insurance companies,
and on that paragon of virtue, Blue Cross-
Blue Shield.

All of these programs require resources and
women to work on them. We intend for the sex
seminars to be only the beginning, the bringing
together of the women who will find the
resources and continue work on the programs,
including the seminars. We think that the
Church is a logical place to go in search of
funds and support for our women's projects.
Historically, the Church, regardless of denom-
ination,.bears a substantial part of the respon-
sibility for the myths and images which confine
women today.

 

We see a need for women to do research and
work in other areas as well. An effective ef-
fort is needed to counter the influence of the
mass media on the images of women. Film and
slide shows and guerrilla theater are possibil-
ities. Bridal fairs, fashion shows, and beauty
contests should be denounced for attempting to
manipulate women. Obnoxious advertisements
should not be allowed to be displayed—- at
least not without a little spray paint retouch-
ing. We must make our situation a public ques-
tion.

Daycare centers are another need.’ Women need
free time to be able to affect change, and with-
out daycare centers to care for their children
they are very limited. Why doesn't the commun-
ity take any responsibility in the raising of
the community's children? We must question
the structure of the nuclear family. How nec-
essary and useful is it, both economically and
emotionally? But we must be careful that the
children and their parents make the decisions
about their daycare centers. Childcare centers
should be creative, not stifling.

Introduction

Poems are written by those who hold screams
inside. The high school student who wrote this
one is already facing the agony of being a wo-
man in America. What does this society offer
to her? A job as a file clerk, or a secretary,
perhaps a college education, followed by a job
like teaching or social work. Even if she de-
cides to work, however, she knows that society
won't really consider her "complete" until she
is married and bears children. So probably she
marries.

And perhaps the bloom lasts for quite a
while. But eventually she will discover, to one
degree or another, that a seemingly beautiful
experience, one for which she has probably been
subtly preparing most of her life, is actually
a confining, inhibiting, and often stifling one.
She sees she has a "role", a "place"--in the
home as well as outside of it. She has been
socialized to believe in that role as "natural",
womanly, and creative. But she finds that those
descriptions make a mockery of her day to day
life. ‘

After her child is born a woman becomes vir-
tually chained to her home. Her whole reason
for being is defined in terms of husband, child-
ren, and household. Her boundaries are determin-
ed largely by her activities as a homemaker--
activities which are similar enough from coast’

.to coast of this country to make a woman wonder

whether perhaps she rolled off an assembly line
in Detroit one day-—Ready for Service! Can
housewifery be called, by any stretch of the
imagination, "creative"? Ask almost any man.
Yet women are usually expected to fulfill this
role, without complaint. If they don't they
will have to contend with being considered "bad
mothers", unnatural, or just plain peculiar.
Ah——but someone will ask-—what about the
millions of working women who are mothers too?

They have expanded opportunities. That's true
enough-—but if they are forced by low income
and/or the emptiness of housework to leave home
for work, their lives are then bound not only
by housework, but also by_a low-paying, tediov
and marginally important job! Does the woman
who works as a secretary, teacher, factory work-
er or waitress find her horizons broadened
through that work? Hardly. In a country where
there are no economic provisions made for rais-
ing children (such as free day—care centers
controlled by the men and women who put their
children in them) the working woman has a doub-
ly difficult row to hoe. Her definition as a
woman does not change simply because she gets

a job. That definition only becomes much harder
for her to live up to. (After working an. 8
hour job, at minimum wages, then coming home

to fix dinner and put the kids to bed, who is
going to want to talk about the future of the
middle east?)

And so we speak of an oppressed group, one
which is, like other oppressed groups, develop-
ing an awareness. An awareness that we are paid
the worst wages for the worst work (or ng wages
as for housework); that we are often used as
surplus labor by businesses who do not wish to
pay the higher wages men demand; that we are
expected to raise the future population of this
country but are not given either social or ec-
onomic recognition for this crucial job; that
we are not taken seriously except on matters
concerned with "woman's domain", primarily the
home; that we see the possibility of control
over our bodies through contraception but that
information and its availability is denied to
us.

Just as black people are beginning to re-
write their own history, we have begun study-
ing women in history, about which even less is
known. If the white man's history is taught in
schools, it is clearly a history of white——
and man. The first person to sit in the front
of a bus in Montgomery was a woman——Rosalie
Parks—-she was just plain tired after a hard
day; and the famous bus boycott began. The in-
itiators of truly grassroots movements in the
South were women, Fannie Lou Hamer for one.
The people who became most involved in the is-
sues of decentralization of schools, more ad-
equate welfare, and day care centers are women.

Because the politics of America have not
dealt with the real problems of women (have
they dealt with the real problems of anyone?)
we will not deal with those politics. It is
said, and it is true, that a male—dominated
power structure now makes all the decisions
which govern our lives. Now,but for how long?
Revolutions are made when people cannot bear
the everyday, the seemingly little oppressive
conditions of their lives any longer. And when
voices cry "We've had enough!" the revolution-
ary process has already begun. Hundreds of wo-
men's liberation groups across the country are
already crying out, and it is clear that if
there is to be a revolution in America it will
no longer be a man's revolution.
