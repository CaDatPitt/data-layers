“Tyranny like hell is not easily conquered; yet we
have this consolation with us, that the harder the con-
ﬂict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain
too cheap, we esteem too lightly.”

Eternally vigilant, this defender of democracy further
warned the American people:

“It is not for the beneﬁt of those who -exercise .the
powers of government that the constitutions and the
governments issuing from them are established. In all
these matters, the right of judging and acting are in
‘those who pay, and not in those who receive.”

After licking the British Redcoats, those “who pay”
found themselves face to face with a new foe to their
aspirations and needs. The democratic mass movement of
the people, mobilized by the Revolutionary War, found
‘itself arrayed against America's native aristocrats, land-
owners, rich merchants—‘determined to harness the Revolu-
tion in their own interests, afraid of any threat to these
interests. They wanted to keep political power out of the
"hands of the people; to curb the forces of the people
without re-arousing their armed resistance to tyranny and
oppression. This ﬁrst battle between democracy and re-
action in the United States resulted in the formulation of
-our compromise Constitution with a Bill of Rights in the
form of ten amendments, added as a condition on the part
‘of democracy for its’ ﬁnal adoption.

On December- 15, 1791, the Bill of Rights became part
-of the basic law of the land. It guaranteed freedom‘ of
religion, of speech and of the press. It guaranteed the right
‘of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the
“government for redress of grievances; due process of law-—
all the civil liberties the American people were deprived
of and had to ﬁght for. Mistress Hutchinson has already

8

 

  

been cited as a victim of the bigoted theocracy that ruled
Massachusetts. Pages could be ﬁlled with the mere listing
of the names of martyrs to the cause of religious freedom
in colonial America—Q_uaker men and women who died
on the gallows, adherents of any other but the dogma of
the ruling clique who were hung from stocks, pilloried,
branded, driven from their homes, deprived of the right
to vote for which membership in a particular church was
a precondition.

How much freedom of speech was available to inden-
tured servants, who had, to slave for years to repay what
was supposedly the money for their passage to the new
world, is obvious. The secret activities of the Sons of Liberty
and the Committees of Correspondence further attest to the
absence of free speech

The case of John Peter Zenger (1697-1746), the ﬁrst_

real martyr to the cause of freedom of the press in this
country, illustrates that hard-won right. Brought to this
country from Germany as a child of thirteen, Peter Zenger
was apprenticed as a printer to Governor Hunter. In
the early 1730's he became editor, publisher and printer
of the New York Weekly Journal, a frankly anti-adminis-

tration paper. Its ﬁrst issue appeared on November 5, 1733.:

By the middle of 1734 its writings had evidently proved
effective enough for the Colonial government to order
Numbers, 7, 47, 48, and 49 of the paper burned because
of the “scurrilous rhymes” they contained. Zenger himself
was arrested and bail set at £400 (about $2,000 in present-
day money and a truly exorbitant sum in colonial New
York). For ten months, Zenger remained in prison. But
his cause won widespread support and when he was ﬁnally
brought into court in April,,1735, the proceedings became
an arena for a test of strength between the opposing forces
in colonial America. Zenger won a trial by jury, complete

acquittal and the ﬁrst real victory for freedom of the press
in America. '

Twoshort chapters from the struggle to win the right
peaceably to assemble and petition the government for
redress of grievances_—-one that came before and one after
the Revolutionary War.

Back in 1678, pioneer settlers from the Colony of Vir-
ginia, poor farmers, “ye scum of ye country” as they were
branded by Virginia newspapers speaking for the already
well-established landed aristocracy, were being shoved fur-
ther and further back into the wilderness. Squeezed off the
fertile farm country of the foot-hills by that aristocracy
and its speculators, they not only faced the natural hard-
ships of tilling uncharted, wild soil, but were seriously
menaced by the Indians. The landowners who had swindled
them were not too anxious for them to move westward.
They needed labor power for their own enterprises. At
the same time they turned deaf ears to the peaceful peti-
tions of the hardy pioneers who pleaded for armed protec-
tion against the Indians; These gentry were conducting,
as a side line, a lucrative business with the Indians—pro-
viding them with the very guns they used against the
farmers (and liquor) in return for furs.

Repeated failure to gain anything by peaceful petition
to the Governor and the House of Burgesses which was in
complete control of the landowners (no elections had been
held for ﬁfteen years) resulted in the organization of a
popular movement led by a young man of twenty-"eight
named Nathaniel Bacon. ‘

His ﬁrst step was to petition peaceably for the right to
organize a militia to protect the settlers from the Indians.
When this was refused he did it anyway. By the time

10

 

 

“Bacon’s Rebellion” had'assumed the proportions of an
armed uprising, its demands included the holding of a
popular election, reform of the whole system of colonial

.laws and the expropriation of the land swindled and stolen

from the people. By this time, too, all its “respectable”
allies had deserted and, despite early ’successes, his ill-
equipped, heroic little army was soon crushed. Governor
Berkley instituted courts martial to deal with the captured
survivors and murdered so many of them that his own
“packed” House of Burgesses protested—mildly—urging
“that the governor would spill no more blood.” His
savagery against the rebels was such that back in England,
King Charles II remarked: “The old fool has put more
people to death in that naked country than I did here for
the murder of my father.” \

The wrath of the aristocracy against Bacon and his forces
was best summed up, and its underlying meaning most
clearly exposed, in a speech before the Colonial Council
of Virginia: '

“Bacon gathered about him a rabble of the basest
sort of people . . . who for ye cause of the poor will
have no taxes paid . . . but would have all magistracy
and government taken away -and set upon themselves
and to make their good intentions more manifest, stick

not to talk openly of sharing men’s estates among
themselves.”

Up in New England, more than a hundred years later,
with the Revolutionary War triumphantly fought and won,
repeated attempts by debt-ridden farmers peaceably to peti-
tion the government for redress of grievances (in this case
excessive taxes) met with repeated failure.

Most of them veterans of the Revolutionary War, still
in possession of their arms, they rallied around Daniel
Shays, :1 Massachusetts farmer. His service to his country

11

 

  

had begun at the Battle of Lexington. It was continued
at Bunker Hill where he was de-corated for his valor. His
bravery at Ticonderoga and other crucial fronts won him
the rank of captain and the gift of a splendid sword from
Lafayette (which he was later forced by poverty to sell).

 

Shays’ battle-cry was redress of grievances. Armed resist-

ance was resorted to only after -all other methods had failed.
On August 29, 1786, Shays and his men prevented the sit-
ting of a Massachusetts court, intending,’ as -they stated in
the most humble and forthright terms, to prevent judg-
ment in debt cases arising out of excessive taxation before

redress of grievances could be petitioned for. Testimony‘

to their patience is the fact that they did not acually begin
ﬁghting until January, 1787. Shays’ small forces were de-
feated only after the governor of Massachusetts had fran-
tically appealed for aid from outside his own state. That
was none to easy to get either, for at about the same time,
over in New Hampshire, the movement against excessive
taxes was taking the form of armed delegations which
“called upon the state assembly.” Marching from thirty
New Hampshire towns they came, stated their case and
threatened to shoot their way out of the halls of the
legislature if troops were summoned against them.

Those arrested after the uprisings had failed were
charged with “high treason.” Shays himself was sentenced
to death, but popular opinion forced his pardon on
June 13, 1788. V

If I I!

As for other civil liberties set forth in the Bill of Rights-
protection from excessive ﬁnes, trial by jury, no cruel or
unusual punishments, indictment by a grand jury, no
-excessive bail, safety from unwarranted searches and
seizures—a few scattered highlights from the colonial and

12

  

revolutionary periods will have to suffice to illustrate their
origin.

For stealing ﬂour, the penalty was: ears sliced oﬁ, brand-
ing on the forehead, even death.

The punishment for debt was indeﬁnite incarceration in

the horror of disease-infested prisons, rotting in chains
made fast to the walls with iron bars, or even sale at
auction. Debt was a “crime” that sent 75,000 men and
women to prison in colonial America. Often it threw them
back into the ranks of bond slavery.

Here is a typical announcement from a colonial news-
paper (Virginia Gazette, July 14, 1737), which further
illustrated the need for some of the rights now embodied
in the ﬁrst ten amendments to the Constitution:

“Ran away some time last June from William Pierce
of Nasimond County, a bond servant woman named
Winifred Thomas. Welsh, short, young, black-haired,
marked on the inside of the right arm with gunpowder
WT and the date of the year underneath. She knits
and spins. Whoever brings her back to her master shall
be paid a pistole besides what the law allows.” (The
date referred to is the year of her purchase-burned
into her flesh.)

So much for the white colonists. What of the Indians
and the Negroes? The laws most eloquently describe their
status. For instance, one set enacted in 1669 provided that
the “casual killing of black slaves especially if the slave
resisted and chanced to die under punishment is not a
felony.” Masters were, in fact, reimbursed for any slaves
they permitted to be legally executed! Negroes, Mulattoes
and Indians were declared to be “real estate” by a law
enacted in 1705. If and when cases involving Negroes got
into the courts at all, the victim could be tried and con-
demned on the testimony of one white witness.

13

 

The Negro people in pre-revolutionary America strug-

gled for their rights with magniﬁcent courage. There were

 

repeated uprisings despite the fact that each was ruthlessly
quelled and the leaders killed. In a Virginia uprising in
1739, of ,the forty rebels captured, thirty-four were shot
and hanged. Cato’s Rebellion in the Carolinas in 1740,
whose well organized though inadequate forces succeeded
in seizing an arms warehouse and marching forth to battle
with drums and banners until surrounded by the militia,
ended with the merciless execution of all its leaders. An
uprising in New York, in 1741, which, according to tes-
timony gathered in the courts after its suppression, had
the support of at least twenty whites, ended in the execu-
tion of thirty-two Negro leaders—-fourteen burned at the
stake and eighteen hanged. A contemporary account of the
trial states: “Every one of the eight lawyers in town ap-
peared against the Negroes, who had no counsel and were
conoicted on insuﬁicient evidence.”

Ill t A It

The newly-won liberties of the American people faced

a new attack only seven years after the enactment of the

Bill of Rights.

The forces of property and reaction, formed into the
Federalist Party, had become ﬁrmly entrenched in the
national government. These gentry are best personiﬁed in
the anti-democratic representative of the moneyed interests,
Alexander Hamilton. The camp of reaction found its
reign threatened by the camp of democracy rallied around
its leader Thomas ]efferson—author of the Declaration of
Independence. Inspired by the political ideas of the French
Revolution, the scattered democratic forces were reorganiz-
ing themselves into political clubs, publishing anti-admin-
istration newspapers, denouncing wherever possible the

14:

 

 

tyranny and corruption of the new Tories. The Federalists,
determined to keep their power, resorted to a method only
too well known nowadays. They whipped up the ﬁrst
“Red” scare in American history, denounced Thomas

* Jefferson as an “atheist leveller from Virginia,” drummed

up a non-existent “war emergency,” ranted about “alien
and subversive inﬂuences” and “French gold.”

In the spring of 1798, the Federalists armed themselves
with what they trusted would be the strongest political
weapons, aimed directly against their enemies—the “un-
ruly masses” inspired by Thomas Jefferson and his party.
They passed the Alien and Sedition Laws (the criminal
syndicalism, Dempsey, Hobbs bills of today) with the ill-
distinguished purpose of destroying their political oppo-
nents.

The Alien Act (June 25, 1798), put dictatorial power 8

into the hands of the President. Designed to stay in /force
for two years it provided that:

“It shall be lawful for the President of the United \
States . . . to order all such aliens as heshall judge
dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States
or shall have reasonable grounds to suspect are con-
cerned in any treasonable or secret machinations . . .
to depart out of the territory of the United States
within such time as shall be expressed in such order."

Failure to comply with this order could be punished
by three years’ imprisonment and the loss forever of the
privilege of becoming a citizen of the United States.

The Sedition Act (July 12, 1798), was aimed even more
directly at -the Jeflfersonian forces and was left to the
courts to enforce. It was to remain as law until March 3,
1801. Imprisonment for two years and $2,000 ﬁne was the
penalty for violation of the Sedition Law which could be
applied against any person who should:

15'

“Write, print, utter or publish, or shall cause or
procure to be written, uttered or published, etc. ._ . . '
any false,‘ scandalous and malicious writings against
the Government of the United States, or either House
of Congress or the President . . . or to bring them into
contempt or disrepute; or to excite against them . . . the V
hatred of the good people of the United States, or to
stir up sedition in the United States, or to excite any
unlawful combination therein for opposing or resisting
any law. . . .”

Both bills were greeted with vigorous opposition and
resistance. Their intention was widely understood. As Con-
gressman Edward Livingston of New York put it at that
time:

“Let us look now at the consequences of this heinous
act. . . . Let no man imagine that a few unprotected
aliens are to be aﬁected by this inquisitorial power.
The same arguments which enforce these provisions
a ainst aliens ap ly with equal strength to enacting
t em against citizens. Will the people submit to it?
They ought not to submit.” V _

And they didn't. Very few prosecutions could be carried

' out. In all, there were perhaps twenty-four or twenty-ﬁve

arrests. Of these only some ﬁfteen resulted in indictments
leading to ten trials and convictions. These were secured
onlywith the aid of openly biased judges—forerunners of
a judiciary which has since proved what side in American
society can most safely depend upon its unfailing assistance.

The two outstanding prosecutions under the Alien and
Sedition Acts were those of Congressman Matthew Lyon
and David Brown of Massachusetts. Lyon was proud of his
title, “The Scourge of the Aristocracy.” He drew the full
penalty and adamantly refused to pay the ﬁne. The author-

16

 

ities in order to collect sold his home by lottery. But he

remained undaunted. He refused to apply for a pardon

and continued his opposition to the laws so effectively
from his prison cell that he was re-elected to. Congress
while behind the bars. p '

David Brown of Massachusetts, popularly known as the
“Wandering Apostle of Sedition” was sentenced to eighteen
months and $400 ﬁne. The evidence against him consisted
of a liberty pole erected at Dedham, Mass., and a leaﬂet
reading: ’ ' -

“Here is 5,000 out of 5,000,000 that receive all the
beneﬁt of public property—indeed all our administra-
tion is as fast approaching to the Lords and Commons
as possible . . . there has always been an actual struggle
between the laboring part of the community and those
lazy rascals that have invented every means that the
devil has put into their hands to destroy the laboring
partof the community. . . . I never knew a government
supported long after the conﬁdence of the people was
lost, for the people are the government."

The ﬁght against the Alien and Sedition Acts became
one of the major factors in Thomas Jefferson's successful
Presidential campaign and what is known as the Revolu-
tion of 18oo. One of his ﬁrst acts as third president of the
United States was to wipe out all of the prosecutions and
sentences under these laws. He tersely ended the chapter
of these undemocratic laws and the struggle against them
(both were repealed by his administration) as follows:

“I discharged every person under the punishment or
prosecution under the Sedition Law, because I con»
sidered and consider now that law to be a nullity
as absolute and inpalpable as if congress had ordered
us to fall down and worship a golden image. It was
accordingly done in every instance, without asking

17

what the offenders had done, or against whom they
had offended, but whether the pains they were suffer-
ing were inﬂicted under the pretended Sedition law.”

LABOR AND LABOR’S RIGHTS

EFORE the Revolutionary War, the status of American
labor and its rights was still for the most part deter-
mined by the conditions under which it had come to this
country (as Redemptioners, Bond Servants, Indentured
Servants, convicts, etc.). As late as 1817 notices offering
rewards for escaped indentured apprentices were to ’ be
found in newspapers. A V
The few scattered attempts at labor organization and
struggle for better conditions before the Revolutionary War
made no signiﬁcant headway. Shoemakers, tailors and

 

printers were the pioneers of trade unionism in the United -

States. It is among the shoemakers that we ﬁnd the ﬁrst
continuous organization of wage earners—the Federal So-
ciety of Journeymen Cordwainers of Pennsylvania—a secret
association with a primitive ritual of taking an oath not
to work at lower wages or with non-members.

Shoemakers’ "turn—outs”—strikes—occurred in 1792, 1794
and again in 1799, the last continuing for ten weeks. All
demands were won and the cordwainers struckonce more
in 1805, well prepared to hold out until victory. _

It was not mere instinct that led the employers to the
courts for protection against the workers and it is little
wonder that the militant shoemakers became the ﬁrst vic-
tims. The judiciary had proved its “reliability” in other
ﬁelds. Then too, English Common Law——still largely the
basis of decisions and precedent—provided further guaran-

18

tees. Repressive laws against labor abounded there——going
all the way back to the, Middle Ages and conveniently
depriving labor of all rights except to toil and be ex-
ploited. . V V

While the labor movement was still small and weak the
nature of the prosecutions in the courts was simple. Trade
union bodies were declared to lie criminal conspiracies, all
the members punished, in the fond hope that they would
thus be wiped out of existence. With the growth of the
trade unions these primitive methods became clearly unre-
liable. They were not entirely abandoned, until well after
the Civil War, through the great railroad strikes of 1877.
But the courts and their masters devised other means of
curbing labor’s rights. They created a distinctly American
contribution to the V history of oppression—the frame—up
system. When mere conviction of workers for insisting on
the exercise of their hard-won, right to organize failed to
halt the growth of their organization, it became easier and
more expedient to stab them in the back. Individual lead-
ers and members were charged and convicted for murder,
rape, dynamiting, obstructing traffic, treason, inciting to
insurrection, disturbing the peace, arson, littering the
streets, robbery, perjury.

But back in 1806, at the first labor trial in American
history—-the first struggle for labor’s rights in the courts——
the finesse of the twentieth century was still unknown.

On November 1, 1805, eight shoemakers were indicted
by a grand jury on charges of forming “a combination and
conspiracy to raise their wages.” The indictment was very
long and speciﬁc. It named all eight and went on to say:.

“Not being content to work at the usual prices and
rates for which they and other workmen in the same art
and occupation were used to work . . . they did with
force and arms combine, conspire, confederate and un-

19

lawfully agree together that they would not work but at
certain large prices and rates. . . .”

 

The shoemakers’ trial did not begin until 1806 in Mayor’

Inskeep's Court in Philadelphia, but their cause had been
made known throughout the thirteen states. Thomas Jeffer-
son’s newspaper Aurora took up their defense. Conservative
papers condemned them in advance, making of this labor
trial still another proving ground for the struggle between
the Federalists and Jefferson. V

Jared Ingersoll, counsel for the masters, was born into a
New England Tory family. Sent to old England to study
law in 1773, he lined up with the Federalists on his return,
becoming their leading legal light, his opinions grounded
ﬁrmly in the English Common Law.

The defense secured the services of Caesar A. Rodney,
signer of the Declaration of Independence, Congressman
from Delaware and Thomas _]efferson’s Attorney General.

The clarity with which the workers saw the issues at
stake in this trial is easily seen in an appeal they had
published in the columns of the Aurora on November
28, 1805: '

“In the constitution of this state it is declared, they
say, ‘that the citizens have a right in a peaceable
manner to assemble together for the common good.’
For ﬁfteen years upwards we have assembled together
in a dpeaceable manner for our common good, and to
guar against the accidents to which industrious men
are exposed, to promote the happiness of the individ-
uals of which our little community is com osed, and
to render service to those whom age or in rmity may
have rendered incapable of labor. . . .

“The Mastershoemakers, as they are called after the
slavish style of Europe, but who are only the retailers
of our labor, and who in truth live upon the work of
our hands, are generally men of large property, to
whom the suspension of business, though it is a loss, is

20

not so great a loss as the total suspension of the means
of subsistence is to us who obtain our income from
week to week. The Masters aslthey are called, and who
would be masters and tyrannists if they could, if the
law would allow them, have their associations, their
meetings and they pass their resolutions; but they are
rich and we are poor, they seem to think that we are
not protected by the Constitution in meeting peace- '
ably together and pursuing our own happiness. They
suppose that they have the right to determine for us
the value of our labor; but that we have no right to
determine for ourselves what we will or will not take
in exchange for our labor. . . {If the association of men
to regulate the price of their own -labor is to be con—
verted into a crime, and labeled with the reproachful
term of a design against the freedom of the nation, the
prospect is a very sad one for Pennsylvania. . . . What
we have here said will inform the public o£..our con—
duct and will show that under whatever pretenses the
thing is done the name of freedom is but a shadow if
_ for doing what the laws of our country authorize we
are to have task—masters to measure out our pittance of
subsistence—if we are to betorn from our ﬁresides for
endeavoring to obtain a fair and just support for our
families, and if we are to be treated as felons and mur-
derers only for asserting the right to take or refuse
whatever we deem an adequate reward for our labor.”

Fortunately the complete record of their trial has been,
preserved intact. The judges were the mayor himself and
three aldermen. The jury was composed of two ‘inn-
keepers, a merchant, three grocers, a tobacconist, a watch-
maker and a tailor. A man named Jonathan Wharton was
almost chosen, but when it turned out that he was aishoe-
m_aker, he was not allowed to serve. ' '

The case for the prosecution began with a sad picture of
the plight of the masters, harassed and worried by the
organized shoemakers. It denounced the Aurora for inﬂu-
encing the public in favor of the defendants and for

' x 21

attempting to “obstruct the pure streams of justice from
flowing in the established courts of law.” _

The ﬁrst witness for the prosecution, job Harrison,
frankly admitted to being a stool-pigeon and a scab. He
had belonged to the shoemakers’ organization for years,

 

had in fact been a member of the union’s “tramping” coma _

mittee in 17gg—its job was to see that no shoemakers would
“scab it.” One of the judges wanted to know what a “scab”
was. Shoemaker George A1corn—the court-room was jammed
with supporters of the defen(lants—sang out: “A scab is a
shelter for lice." He was ﬁned $10 for contempt of court.

The prosecution was determined to prove that the asso-
ciation forced shoemakers to join and the masters to pay
higher wages. They put Anthony Bennett on the stand. He
obligingly testiﬁed that he had been threatened with
death. Asked how he knew the union men would kill him,
he replied: “They have threatened to do it. Not to my face
but according to what I have understood. They have
broken my windows with potatoes. They have abused me.”

Ingersoll wound up the case for the masters with a
flowery Federalist oration. The ﬁnale was vivid and
succinct:

“Shall a secret body exercise a power over our fellow
citizens which the legislature itself is not invested with?
It now rests with the jury and the discretion of the
Court to say, whether we shall in the future be gov-
erned by secret clubs instead of the Constitution and
the laws of the state . . . a verdict of not guilty will
sanction combinations of the most dangerous kind, a
contrary verdict will give the victory to the known and
established laws of the commonwealth.” \

Caesar Rodney supplied the political ammunition of the
defense in a ﬁery attack upon the English Common Law.
He showed how the masters of American workmen were

22

looking for protection to a law passed. in England in 1349
after the Black Plague had wiped out half the working
population. The purpose of their Statute of Laborers, by
which they now hoped to crush trade unionism in the
United States, was to compel all surviving laborers to work
and to work at a maximum wage ﬁxed by law. He con-
cluded:

“If you are desirous of introducing a spirit of in-
equality into our government and laws, if you think
that the laborer and the journeymen enjoy too great a
part of liberty . . . such disposition and opinion will
lead you to convict the de endants. If on the other
hand, you are satisﬁed with the wise and liberal prin-
ciples of our government . . . if you are content with the
blessings enjoyed under our Constitution, which se-
cures to the citizens an equality of rights which recog-
nizes no distinction of classes—-I shall look for a verdict
of acquittal.” '

The jury did not deliberate very long. Its composition
assured the verdict. The men were found guilty and sen-
tenced to $8 ﬁne each and costs. They were to stand com-
mitted until all was paid, which meant they all went to jail.

Several similar trials followed: New York tailors, 1809-
verdict guilty, sentence $1 ﬁne each and costs; Baltimore
shoemakers, 18o9—guilty; Pittsburgh shoemakers—1814 and

1815—guilty. The relative insigniﬁcance of the sentences of_

small ﬁnes must not overshadow the importance of the
verdicts by means ofjwhich it was hoped to crush forever
trade union organization in the United States.

The 1815 trial of the Pittsburgh shoemakers was the
second to attract national attention. Labor editorials
blasted at the masters and the courts: '

“Shall all other, except only the industrious mechan-
ics be allowed to meet and plot; merchants to determine

dicial to théisuccessful enterprise of the capitalist in

The Pittsburgh prosecution was also entrusted to Jared

lngersoll, who once more elaborated upon the English
«Common Law and the Statute of Laborers of 1349. The
-~ defense went to great pains, particularly in cross-examining
the masters who were prosecution witnesses, to prove that
they too had associations to protect their interests. Witness-
Master Jared Harmon: stated thathe and other employers
met more than monthly to regulate the prices at which they
would sell their work. “Afterwards,.f’ he added, y“we met to

battle against the English Common Law:

The jury found all but one of the twenty-one on trial
guilty and all were sentencedto $1 ﬁne and costs. 8 '8
Despite the avalanche of convictions there were, by, 1838,
53 unions in Philadelphia, 52 in New York, 23 in Balti-
more, 16 in Boston. Undaunted, the rnasters.continued to
rely on the courts. In 1827 there was’ a great trial of 24
journeymen tailors in Philadelphia. While all previous in-
dictments had contained the charge ‘fdid with force and
violence,” it was in this trial.that the ﬁrst real attempt was
made’ to make it stick. ‘-
These tailors were real militants. They struck not only
for higher wages, but for the reinstatement of members of
their organization who had been disrﬁissed; They ‘waited for
the scabs engaged in their" places, followed  home,
argued with them to stop taking‘ the bread ,out,,of the
mouths of other men's children. These actions were for

\ ' 

 

the ﬁrst time listed as “overt acts” by the prosecution and
the masters who paid for it. y

A document was introduced in evidence—a letter sup-
posedly sent to Master Goodwin—containing threats that
his house would be burned and his family dispersed if he
did not meet the union's terms.

The prosecution, as usual, was aﬂame with impassioned
oratory. ’

“If you mean to say, gentlemen of the jury, that be-
cause we live in a land of freedom, two of your fellow
citizens [employers Robb and V/Vinebrenner] who have
been guilty of no offense, who are known to you and
every one in the community for their enterprise, in-
dustry and honest efforts to support their families and
acquire wealth which it is the laudable ambition of
every man to accumulate—is led astray by idle declama-
tion about liberty, equality and freedom, you mean to
say that such men are to be bound over hand and foot
and delivered over to the mercies of this remorseless
confederacy, given up by you and the court to a band
of daring and desperate conspirators, if you mean to
say and do this, gentlemen of the jury, give your verdict
for the defendants.”

The jury—impressed—returned a verdict of guilty.

The labor trials which followed emphasized, more and
more, the “injury-to-trade” angle of the conspiracies rather
than their so-called criminal aspects.

In 1835, came the case of the Geneva shoemakers. It took
the jury twenty minutes to ﬁnd the men guilty despite the
fact that their defense stated: ‘

“You forbid these men that union which alone can
enable them to resist the oppression of avarice . . . you
deprive them of the means and opportunity of learn-
ing the rights and du_ties which they are to exercise as
citizens.” '

~ 26

An appeal was carried to the New York State Supreme
Court, and was upheld by Chief justice Savage on the
grounds that where organized workers forced wages up too
high, employers could not afford to compete and thus they
obstructed the business of boot and shoe making and were
therefore guilty of injury to trade. A

By the time twenty-ﬁve members of the Union Society of
Journeymen Tailors in New York were brought to trial in
1836 on charges of “conspiracy to injure trade, riot, assault,
battery,” the trade union movement had grown strong
enough to ‘put up a real battle in their defense. The trade
union press carried no hint of submission in its editorials
(New York Union):

“If an American judge will tell an American jury
that these barriers which the poor have thrown up to
protect themselves from the gnawing avarice of the rich
are unlawful, then are the mechanics justiﬁed as our
fathers were justiﬁed in the days of the revolution,
arming for self-defense.” '

On June 14, 1836, a defense mass meeting was held at
City Hall attended by 2,700 persons. Judge Savage was
burned in eﬂigy. On the day of the trial the courtroom
was packed with sympathetic workers. The judge in passing
sentence on the men after they were found guilty sounded
a new and menacing note (all too familiar today):

“Your case affords a striking manifestation of the
necessity of the law to extend its protection to the in-
dividuals aimed at. . . . In this favored land of law and
liberty the road to advancement is open to all . . . every
American knows that or ought to know that he has no
better friend than the laws and that he needs no ar-
tiﬁcial combination for his protection. They are of
foreign origin and I am led to believe mainly upheld
by foreigners.”

Henry Faulkner, president of the Tailors Society, was
ﬁned $15o——0thers $100 and $50 each—a total of $1150.
While the defendants. were paying their ﬁnes, one man
stepped forward. and contributed his wages towards. the
fund. The progressive press protestedagainst the judge's
attitude and remarks. They hastened to point to the thou-
:sands of Americans who ‘belonged to unions and defended
their right to do so. .

Further conspiracy prosecutions continued, but at more
distant intervals and with less and less emphasis on the idea
that it was a crime to confederate for the purpose of raising
wages. The trade union movement grew in strength and
inﬂuence and aided by the third-party labor parties which
"ran candidates for office in many parts of the country, labor
legislation making trade unions legal began to be passed.

American labor has had to weather great storms through-
-out its history. Big Bill‘Hayw0od once said that that his-
tory was written in blood and tears. In any state where
workers have ever gone on strike there has been a taste of
martial law with the bayonets of National Guardsmen re-
placing civil liberties. There have been such bloody chap-
ters as Ludlow, Colorado, and Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. The
vpullman strike of 1894 led by Eugene V. Debs» was con-
-fronted by a military array of 1,936 Federal troops sent in
by President Cleveland, 4,000 militia men, 45,000 Federal
-deputy marshalls (thugs), 250 deputy sheriffs (thugs) and
3,000 police. During the Chicago teamsters’ strike of 1905,
twenty-oneiworkerswere killed and 415 wounded. In the
Paterson weavers’ strike of 191 ‘there were 2,238larrest,s.

But despite these statistics which are indirect tribute to
the determination of’ labor to defend -_and exercise its rights,
the struggle. for the enforcement of these rights is sharper
today thanit ever was before. Efforts to destroy the Wagner
Act and the National Labor Relations Board, by amend-

28

 

ment, Congressional investigation, radio debate, are only
slightly more sophisticated methods aimed at the destruc-
tion of trade unions and the right to organize, strike and
picket. The National Manufacturers Association makes no
secret of the fact thatpthis legislation is a threat to its
proﬁts which it does not choose to tolerate.

On a local scale, in most important industrial centers
and communities efforts to hamstring labor’s‘ rights are
present in anti-picketing ordinances, compulsory arbitra-
tion machinery (as in Wisconsin). Injunctions, developed
in the ’eighties of the last century, still appear throughout
the land, powerful anti-labor weapons wielded by employ-
ers through the hands of the courts. Hearst is today able
to prosecute Newspaper Guild strikers for ﬁfteen months
by means of injunctions. ,

One of the most serious threats to labor’s rights today is
the Federal Government's revival of the Sherman anti-
trust law prosecutions against trade unions and their leaders.
Fished out of obscurity by now Supreme Court Justice
Frank Murphy, Thurman Arnold has succeeded in starting
prosecution of building trades, teamsters and utilities
unions in several states and in securing his ﬁrst convictions
against New York's militant fur union leaders headed by
Ben Gold, and Local 807 of the teamsters. ,

The very name of this law gives away the Government's
clumsy dodge in using it against labor organizations—sud-
denly re-discovered to be conspiracies in constraint of trade.

The most alert defense of the Wagner Act, the victims
of “anti-trust” persecution—converging as they do during a

A crisis in the nation's history and accompanied by the beat-

ing of war drums-—is required to forestall this obvious drive
on the part of the ruling class to crush such organized re-
sistance to its plans as is represented by 8,ooo,ooo organ-
ized workers.

THE RIGHTS OF THE NEGRO PEOPLE

THE Civil War, the second great turning point in Ameri-
can history after the Revolution, brought the forces
of the people once again. into sharp and open conﬂict with
the forces of property and reaction. The slavocracy of the
South which had captured and maintained a stranglehold
not only over its own slave empire but on the National Gov-
ernment as well found itself faced with a ﬁght for power and
control by the banker—industrialists of the North, as well as
the forces of democracy determined that human slavery be
wiped out. We shall deal here only with that phase of the
struggle which concerns the Negro people and their rights.

In unwavering battle for an end to slavery, men and
women whose names will forever illuminate our heritage
of liberty—-Frederick Douglass, Lucretia Mott, Harriet
Tubman, Elijah Lovejoy, \Vi11iam Lloyd Garrison——led the

Abolitionists in struggle for human freedom despite every

form of terror and violence. V

It was hoped by the slavocracy that the legal doom of
Negro rights would be ﬁnally sealed by the Dred Scott de-
cision (1857) in which the Supreme Court of the United
States declared a Negro to be property with no rights a
white man was bound to respect. The Southern Bourbons
hoped also by this decision, which further declared that
Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in the territories
of the United States, to create a super government, an
avenue through which it could forever hold power. As Lin-
coln said of the Dred Scott decision, the slave—owners hoped
by “irrevocably ﬁxed decisions” to create asituation in

30

 

which “the people will hav-e ceased to be their own rulers,
having to that extent practically resigned their government
into the hands of that tribunal.” The decision was reversed
——by the Civil War.

The local governments of the slave-owners had plenty of
legislative ammunition in their arsenals of repression. There
were laws which forbade, on penalty of death, teaching
Negroes to read and write. Virginia had a law which pro-
vided:

“If a person by speaking or writing maintain that
owners have no right of property in their slaves, he
shall be conﬁned in jail for not more than one year
and ﬁned not exceeding $500.”

Some of these laws are still on Southern statute books.*

Enforcement of their meaning was largely accomplished
by mob violence against those who had the courage to
challenge slavery in its Southern citadel. ,

Garrison's Liberator reported on December 19, 1856:

“A record of cases of lynch law ‘in the Southern states
reveals the startling fact that over 300 white persons
have “been murdered upon the accusation, in most cases
unsupported by legal proofs, of carrying among slave-
holders arguments addressed to their intellects and con-
sciences as to the morality and expediency of slavery.”

It is important to note that these lynchings were for moral
arguments to slave-owners and -not for agitation among the
slaves themselves. Desperate defense of a system which the
landed aristocracy of the South felt to be essential to the

* It took from 1932 to 1937 and a nationwide mass defense cam-
paign for the life ' and freedom of a Negro youth named Angelo
Herndon to wipe out a Georgia statute of 1862. He organized Negro
and white unemployed to ﬁght for relief together. The South hoped
by calling it “inciting to insurrection” under a slave law to halt the
tide of growing Negro and white unity and retard the movement for
enforcement of Negro rights. '

31

perpetuation of its power led to every type of excess. The
brutal arrogance of those elected to public oﬂice ostensibly
to uphold law and order increased as the crisis that ended
in open warfare drew nearer. '

Washington was the scene of debate in favor of slavery

S that ‘makes an American blush today to read it. Senator

William C. Preston of South Carolina roared—and was
applauded: »

“Let an A bolitionist come within the borders of'South
Carolina. If we can catch him we will try him; and not-
withstanding all the interference of all the govern-
ments on earth, including the Federal Government,
we will hang him.”

We don't have to go back to pre-Civil War days for such

‘uncivilized, barbaric sentiments expressed on the ﬂoor of

Congress. The reader need only turn to the speeches of
Senators Ellender and Bilbo in the last ﬁlibuster that de-
feated the Anti-Lynching Bill to ﬁnd equally hair-raising
incitements to race hatred and bigotry. '

Rewards on the heads of Abolitionist leaders were posted
throughout the South- On December 26, 1831, Governor
Lumpkin of Georgia signed an act of the legislature offer-
ing $5,ooo“reward to anyone who wouldbring William
Lloyd Garrison to that state to stand trial under its laws.

Not content with the military defeat and execution of
John Brown on December 2, 1859, the slave power went
wild gloating over its murderous triumph:

“If ever another party invade the territory of Virginia
or any other slave state with a similar purpose, may
they be caught and without judge or jury burned alive
in a ﬁre of green faggots.”

This was a typical editorial in the Southern press.
In the North, too, Abolitionists were subjected to mob

32

 

violence ranging from tar-and-feathering to lynching. The
Northern allies of the Southern slave-owners—-bankers, men
of commerce—met the challenge of the Abolition move-
ment as far back as the ‘thirties. The national government
was then completely the creature of the slave power and
so it countenanced denial of the right of petition; riﬂing
of mails; burning of books and newspapers; attacking and
routing of anti-slavery meeting with the connivance of local
authorities.

When the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society advertised
a meeting on October 21, 1835,: the following placard soon
appeared upon the streets:

“That infamous foreign scoundrel Thompson will
hold forth this afternoon at the Liberator oﬂice. . . .
The present is a fair opportunity for the friends of the
Union to snake Thompson out. . . . A purse of $100
has been raised by a number of patriotic ‘citizens to
reward the individuals who shall first lay violent hands
on Thompson so that he may be brought to the tar
kettle before dar .” I

In New York the homes and offices of Abolitionists were
broken into and wrecked. In Philadelphia, where there were
many such, one anti-Abolitionist riot lasted for three nights.
Gentle Lucretia Mott was pelted with rocks and rotten
vegetables when she stood her ground and insisted on exer-
cising her right to speak. Churches attended by Abolition-
ists were stoned. In New Hampshire Abolitionist Minister
George Stores was dragged from his knees while at prayer
on December 14, 1835, and sentenced to three months at
hard labor as “a common railer and brawler.”

Violence against the foes of slavery in the North was
climaxed by the lynching of Elijah Lovejoy at Alton,
Illinois, on November 6, 1836. Champion of human free-
dom, Lovejoy was hounded out of Missouri where he edited

33

the St. Louis Observer, the ﬁrst anti-slavery paper in a slave
state. He re-establishedvhis press across the Mississippi at
Alton. Three tim-es it was wantonly destroyed by mobs.
Lovejoy was not intimidated. On November 6, came the
fourthyattack. The mayor of Alton whoihad watched the
murderers in action remarked that he had never seen “such
a gentlemcmly mob” as took the life of Elijah Lovejoy.

Wholesale murder and lynching of Negroes did not come
until after the Civil “far for the obvious reason that as
slaves they were valuable “property,” many of them bring-
ing a very high price.

Opposition to Abolitionism in the North was nurtured
by those forces to whom its exponents were dangerous
radicals in general. They spoke too enthusiastically of
human rights, civil rights, privileges. Their liberty crusade
was not always conﬁned to Negro slaves alone——it began to
extend to other persecuted and oppressed groups. Under
cover of the slogans “national unity,” “peace,” Northern
allies of the slavocracy were quite willing that the system
of slavery continue——even in a separate slave nation with
which, after all, proﬁtable’ trade and business could be con-

ducted unmolested. ‘Their vital interests, however, required

that full control-of the Nationals Government be wrested
from the hands of the slave-owners.

The labor movement saw most clearly the necessity for
destruction of the slave power as the basis for real national
unity, progress and the solution ofits own problems. Whole
unions enlisted to ﬁght in the Civil War. A Philadelphia
union recorded the following decision in its minutes:

“It having been resolved to enlist with Uncle Sam
for the war, this union stands adjourned until either
the Union is safe or we are whipped.”

The struggle for the rights of the Negro people was not
34

 

won with the Civil War. The war achieved the destruction
of chattel slavery, legally abolished‘ by’ the 13th Amend-
ment, passed January 31, 1865, and ﬁnally ratiﬁed on De-
cember 17 of that year. ‘ 8

The North itself was sharply divided on the question of
Negro rights. Radical Republicans meant to carry through
the basic purposes of the bourgeois-democratic revolution.
But they came face to face with stark reaction which already
showed its fear of the 4,000,000 potential allies of a rapidly

developing working class. The struggle raged around the

methods of Reconstruction and is clearly crystallized in the
compromising 14th Amendment to the Constitution. 8
Though it confers citizenship upon the Negro people and
recognizes their rights as citizens, it contains the invidious
“due process of law” provision which immediately served

as a handle for the Supreme Court to grab in behalf of the

ruling class. Clearest proof——not only of the fact that the
14th Amendment has not beenused to protect the rights
of the Negro people, but also of the usurped power of self-
appointed guardian of the Constitution which the Supreme
Court allocated to itself—-is to be found in decisions in-
volving the 14th Amendment. It says that no state can pass
laws depriving persons of the liberties setforth without due
process of law. A

Between 1868 and 1912 the Supreme Court handed down
312 decisions in behalf of corporations and businesses de-
ﬁned as “persons” under the 14th Amendment! During this
same period twenty-eight cases involving Negro rights under
the Amendment came before the same court—twenty-two
of them were decided against the Negro people.

The 14th Amendment is still——as far as the courts are
concerned——a bulwark of the capitalist system instead of a
political recognition of the rights of the people.

Some -progress has been made in restoring theoriginal

intention of those who fought for Negro rights during Re-
construction. In the ﬁght for the rights and freedom of the
nine innocent Scottsboro Boys—three times carried to the
Supreme Court of the United States by the International
Labor Defense on the grounds that they were not only
framed on “rape” charges but systematically deprived of
their constitutional rights—an historic victory for the 14th
Amendment was won. The Scottsboro victories not only
saved the lives of the nine boys but established in fact the
right of the Negroes to sit on juries throughout the South.
Evasion and trickery are still used to keep them off, and it
is still news that gets into the papers when Negroes are
summoned and seated for jury duty. In every case it is re-
corded as the first time in the memory of living man in the
particular community. Within the last year decisions by
Supreme Court Justice Black have attempted to restore the
clearly-stated meaning of the 14th Amendment.

The Negro people themselves were theymost heroic ﬁght-
ers for their rights in Reconstruction days. In the Consti-
tutional Convention called in defeated slave states, in the
Union Leagues, in the Negro militias, they battled against
the combined forces of bigotry and determinationito keep
them enslaved. Two things the defeated slavocracy and its
Northern allies were adamant about——the Negroes must not
get the right to vote or own land. \/Vithout either of these
it would be possible to assure them only the freedom to
starve or work as economic slaves.

In 1880, Frederick Douglass said:

"Today in most of the Southern states, the 14th and
15th Amendments are virtually nulliﬁed. The rights
which they are intended to guarantee are denied and \
held in contempt. The citizenshi granted in the .14th
Amendment is ractically a moc ery, and the right to
vote provided or in the 15th Amendment is literally
36

 

stamped out in the face of government. . . . They gave
the freedmen the machinery of liberty but denied them
the steam with which to put it in motion. They gave
them the uniforms of soldiers, but no arms; they called
them citizens and left them subjects. . . . They did not
deprive the old master class. of the power of life and
death which was the soul of the relation of master and ‘
slave. They could not of. course sell them, but they re-
tained the power to starve them to death, ‘and wherever
this power is held, there‘ is the power of slavery.”

_ The eloquent and clearly stated demands of the Negro
people for democratic rights, cash wages for labor, free
education for their children, equal political rights with all
men were met by such betrayals of the Bill of Rights, as the
Black Codes. The chief and undisguised aim of these laws
was to reshackle the 4,000,000 Negro freedmen with the
chains of forced and unpaid labor. The codes proscribed
what a Negro could do—the Mississippi Black Code is a fair
example——naming “committing riots, aﬁrays, trcspasses,
malicious mischief, seditious speeches, insulting gestures,
language or acts’_’ as forbidden and punishable by imprison-
ment and ﬁne. It is obvious that the,_new1ygfreed slaves
could pay no ﬁnes. Peonage-to the state or to individuals

-who paid for them became the reservoir ,for unpaid labor.

But the. Black Codes, economic pressure and. campaigns
of ridicule and slander failed to curb the inspiring struggle

A of the Negro people for their full freedom. And so open

violence was resorted to. The Ku Klux Klan was spawned.
Only the heroic activities ofthe Union Leagues and the
Negro militias prevented wholesale slaughter of Negroes
every time they attempted the enforcement of their consti-
tutional rights. ' — ' ‘

As it was, in Louisiana alone from 1866‘to 1875 over
3,5o0 were killed and wounded according, to an official re-
port from General Philip Sheridanito President U. S. Grant.

After 1868 there were no official investigations and there is
every indication that the ﬁgures are an underestimation.
In St. Landry, in 1868, General Sheridan stated that a
massacre lasting ﬁve days took a toll of 300 Negro lives.

The Negro militias defended their people as valiantly as
they could. They also defended white friends whose safety
was threatened for championing Negro rights. But they
were ﬁghting against insurmountable odds,

The debates in the Black Parliaments as they are still
called in official histories (the viliﬁcation of these bodies
is one of ‘the most shameful jobs of treacherous lying in
historiography), in state Republican conventions, in all
assemblies in which they participated are indestructible
monuments to the magniﬁcent courage, the inherent great-
ness of the Negro people. The short-lived constitutions
adopted in many of these state conventions provided for
Negro suffrage, complete equality of civil rights, rights for
women, prohibition of imprisonment for debt, expunging
forever of the term “nigger.” They were truly democratic
documents. The seldom-matched eloquence of the Negro
spokesmen for these measures was enriched by the heritage
of struggle they personiﬁed. Behind their words stood the
spirits of Denmark Vesey (1812),’ Gabriel (1800), Nat
Turner (1831) who had sacriﬁced their lives in armed up-
risings for liberty.

‘ A few examples:

From the Memorial to Congress from the Colored Peo-

ple’s Convention of South Carolina, November 24, 1865:

“We ask that the three great agents of civilized "so-
ciety—the school, the pulpit and the press—be as secure
in South Carolina as in Massachusetts or Vermont. . ~. .

“VVe ask that equal suffrage be conferred upon us, in
common with the white men of this state. . . . This we
ask because ‘all free governments derive their just

38

 

powers from the consent of the governed’ and we are
largely the majority in this state . . . we ask for equal
suffrage as a rotection from the hostility evoked by
our known faithfulness to our country and ﬂag under
all circumstances. . . . We ask that colored men shall
not in every instance be tried by white men; and that
neither by custom nor enactment shall we be excluded
from the jury box. . . . ‘We protest against any code of
black laws the legislature of this state may enact. . . 

From the Resolutions of the Virgihia Republican State
Convention, April 17, 1867:

“That we recognize the great fact that interests of the
laboring classes of the states are identical, and that,
without regard to color, we desire to elevate them to
their true position; that the exaltation of the poor and
humble, the restraint of the rapacious and the arrogant,
the lifting up of the poor and degraded without
humiliation or degradation to any; that the attainment
of the greatest amount of happiness and prosperity to l
the greatest number is our warmest desire and shall

' have our earnest and persistent efforts in accomplish-
ment; that while we desire to see all men protected in
full and equal proportions, and every political right
secured to the colored man that is enjoyed by any other
class of citizens, we do not desire to deprive the white
laboring men of any rights or privileges which they
now enjoy, but propose to extend those rights and
privileges. . . .”

A From the proceedings of the Colored Convention of that
State to the People of Alabama, May 21, 1867:

“As there seems to be considerable difference of opin-
ion concerning the ‘legal rights of the colored man’
it will not be amiss to say that we claim exactly the
same rights, privileges and immunities as are enjoyed
by white men. All legal distinctions between the races
are now abolished. . . . Color can no longer be pleaded
for ‘the purpose of curtailing privileges, and every

39

 

public right. . . . We have said that we intend to claim
all our rights, and we submit to our white friends that
it is the height of folly on their part to withhold them
any longer. One-half of the voters in Alabama are black
men. . . . There are some good people who are always

reaching patience and procrastination. They would

ave us wait a few months, years, generations, until the
whites voluntarily givetus our rights, but we do not
intend to wait one day longer than we are absolutely
compelled to. . . .

“The press of Mobile and other parts of the state
contains numerous threats that those colored people
who do not vote as their employers command will be
discharged; that the property-holders will combine,
import white laborers, and discharge their colored
hands. Numerous instances have already come to our
knowledge of persons who have already been discharged
because they attended'Republican meetings and great
numbers more have been threatened. ‘Vote as~we com-
mand or starve.’ . . . When the nation abolished slavery
you used your local overnments to neutralize and de-
feat its action, and t e nation answered by abolishing
your governments and enfranchisin us. If you now
use your property to neutralize or efeat this, its last
act, it will answer by taking away‘ the property you
are only allowed to retain through its unparalleled
mercy and which you have proved yourselves so un-
worthy of retaining. . . .” r

In this last hope the Negro people‘ were, of course,
tragically mistaken. Instead of what they asked for, by every
right, they got lynching as a national institution, the K.K.K.,
and similar terror organizations, poll taxes, grandfather 
i clauses, chain gangs, frame-ups. Jim Crowism is rife and 
rampant in our land. Educational facilities are still too
‘ inadequate to deserve the name. The struggle for -the en-
5» forcement of Negro rights is still one of the major problems
; facing the whole American people if civil rights are to be

stitution and the Bill of Rights; ‘Unless all attempts to "put

' them there are quashed it will be as Frederick Douglass

said: “The white man’s liberty has been ‘marked out for
the same grave as the black‘ man’s.’* ‘-

THE F.RAME-UP SYSTEM

WITH the expansion of American» industry-following the
A end of the Civil War, the labor movement launched
a vigorous drive to unionizeevery industry in the land.
Employers, failing by plain terror and. intimidation to
curb . this campaign, turned once more to the courts for
rescue. And the frame-up system was born. Labor’s rights

and the struggle to enforce them were to be hamstrung if *

they could not be annihilated.

The ﬁrst successful labor frame—up in American history
came in 1875-76 in the case of» the .Molly Maguires. This
was a nickname applied, to the Ancient Order of Hiber-

' nians, an «Irish fraternal beneﬁtisociety and the backbone

of Irish miners battling to bring trade union organization
into their industry. ‘

As an integral part of the ‘system, since become much
more polished and perfected, Pinkerton detectives were
sent in tojoin the Mollies, discover» the leaders of the trade
union movement and pin on_ them the guilt for a series of
terroristic attacks on mine supervisors and bosses. Prose-
cutions of the Irish ‘miners in; and around=Mauch Chunk,
Pennsylvania, covered a period of about two years". A

The state prosecutor in the Molllyhlvlaguire trials, Frank-
lin A, Gowen, was simultaneously president of, the «Phila-
delphia and Reading Iron and_.Coal Company .which em-

. 41 ’

ployed most of the accused. He shared the honor with a
General Albright who always came to court in military
uniform. In private life the general was legal adviser to
the Wilkes Barre and Lehigh Coal Company. Throughout
the trials the court room was heavily guarded by Coal and
Iron police—forerunners of the private armies since de-
veloped to greater efliciency by \/Veir, Girdler and Ford.

The ﬁrst important Molly Maguire trial was that of
Michael C. Doyle charged with the murder of Mine Super-
intendent john P. Jones. One hundred and twenty witnesses
were called by the prosecution. Their evidence consisted
almost exclusively of having “seen” the accused in the
neighborhood of the murder. Some of them added dramatic
interest by "providing bushes behind which the victim
“lurked.” The defense easily proved that there weren't any
bushes for miles around—nor had there ever been.

The constitutional rights of the defendant consisted
cynically of outward forms, indifferently observed. It was
an open trial—but guarded by Coal and Iron police. It was
trial by jury-but by a hand-picked dozen of hostile farm-
ers. That Michael Doyle had adequate defense was no fault
of the court or the prosecution whose true aims were de-
claimed in General Albright’s speech to the jury:

“The other side talks of the coal company and calls
them little better than a band of murderers, too. What
harm did they do to Doyle? If it were not for them
everything would go by the board. Where would your
farms ﬁnd a market were it not for the families of the
miners which the company supports?

“They talk about the Coal and Iron police and call
them hard names. . . . This court has asked for their
aid and they are responsible for the safekeeping of the
prisoner until you are ready to free him or send him
to his God. These men are ready to stand between you
and the mob and see that no violence is done you for

42

 

the performance ofyour duties. . . . If you, the jury,
do not return a verdict of guilty in this case, it will re-
sult in the formation of vigilance committees and the
resort to lynch law.”

How this summation proved Doyle guilty of murder is

diﬂicult to follow, but how it intimidated the farmers’ jury
into rendering a verdict that sent him to his death on the

gallows is easily seen.

In A a’ later trial, Coal Company-President-Prosecutor-
Gowen bared the fangs of the frame-up system more plainly:

“[If the miners were condemned to die] we can stand
before the whole country and say . . . ‘Come here with
your money. Make your residence here and help us
build u this industry. You will be safe.’ . . . I believe
I have one my duty, for God's sake let me beg of you
do not shrink from yours. Solemn judges of the law,
august ministers in the temple of justice robed for the
sacriﬁce, I bring before you this prisoner and lay him
upon your altar.”

Altogether nineteen Molly Maguires were sentenced to
death and executed—martyrs to the building of the trade
union movement in the United States.

Labor’s struggle for an eight-hour day led to a general
strike on May 1, 1886. Four heroes of American labor died
by the hangman’s noose for its successful organization. They
never knew that it became labor’s international holiday,
May Day. The frame-up system was well oiled to murder
them. They were accused of throwing a bomb into a meet-
ing they themselves had called to protest the police shoot-
ing of McCormick Reaper strikers on May 4, 1886. To this
day no one knows who threw that bomb. It killed one
policeman outright and wounded scores of participants.
But the state returned 69 indictments for murder, con-

\ 43

 

spiracy to murder and dynamiting against eight leaders of
.the movement for the eight-hour day. '

Their trial began on June 21, 1886, and lasted eight
weeks. The Mayor of Chicago, appearing as a defense wit-
ness, testiﬁed tothe completely peaceful nature of that
Haymarket Square protest meeting, _

The accused were outstanding ﬁgures in the labor move-
ment. Albert Parsons, thirty-six when he was hanged, and
August Spies had national reputations. So much so that
for weeks before the May Day strike inciting editorials
against them ﬁlled the Chicago press. A A

The prosecution’s case against them consisted of the
bloody clothes of a dead policeman; statements of news-
paper reportersjwho testiﬁed that they had been sent to
cover the meeting with instruction to take down only the
most “inﬂammatory” speeches; revolutionary literature
seized in the homes and offices of the accused; hysterical
.-speeches to the jury howling for the blood of “dangerous,
viperous anarchists.” A

The selection and ﬁnal composition of the jury deserves
special attention. It was a hideous example of what the
frame-up system can do to a,» basic constitutional right of
the American people. Judge. Joseph E. Gary questioned
prospective talesmen personally—with the following results:

The ﬁrst was prejudiced against all Anarchists, Socialists
:and Communists; the second admitted he had. formed an
-opinion prejudicial to the defendants; the. third that the
defendants were certainly interested in the crime; the fourth
that he felt somebody ought to be made an example of-"in
connection, with this affair. Despite defense challenges all

_ these men were seated. .

The Judge defended juror-to-be Snead against the pro-

 tests of defense counsel: -

“I know the purposes of Socialists, Anarchists,«,and H
44

. . ,,_.,.._, -./wk .,.,4,.,,_,

Communists, that they are as pernicious and unjustiﬁ-
able as horse thieves and therefore Mr. Snead’s preju-
dice against this class, even though he admits it is such
that he could not render a fair verdict where one of
them is involved, is not a disqualifying prejudice.”

Even this speech from the bench was not considered
suﬂicient violation of the constitutional rights of the Hay-
market martyrs to warrant interference by the United States
Supreme Court which ‘turned down their appeal.

This august tribunal was equally unimpressed with an
affidavit (undenied) quoting the following statement by
Bailiff Henry L. Ryce in charge of summoning prospective
jurors:

“I am managing this case, and I know what I am
about. These fellows will hang as certain as death.

I am summoning as jurors such men as they will be

compelled to challenge and when they have exhausted

their challenges, they will have to take such a jury as
will be satisfactory to the state.”

Five of the eight men were sentenced to death and four
of them—Albert Parsons, August Spies, Adolph Fisher and

George Engel——died on‘the gallows on November 11, 1887. ‘

Louis Lingg, the ﬁfth, died in jail on November 8. The
official explanation as reported in newspaper headlines read:

“Bombs are found in the jail. The villains have
sneaked bombs into the jails intended to blow up the
place. Lingg by accident blew his own head off.”

Michael Schwab and Samuel Fielden, sentenced to life
imprisonment, and Oscar Neebe to ﬁfteen years, were par-
doned in 1893 by Governor john Peter Altgeld of Illinois.
His famous decision oﬂicially recognized the frame-up
character of the entire proceedings. A

These pioneers of modern industrial unionism and the

shorter working day did not die in vain. The prophetic
words of August Spies spoken with the hangman’s noose
around his neck are eternally engraved on the living monu-
ment of the labor movement:

“There will come a time when our silence will be

more powerful than the voices you are strangling
today.”

With such “successful” results to inspire its perpetrators,
the frame—up system was employed against labor and its
leaders with greater frequency and efficiency. It received a
serious set-back at the hands of Big Bill Haywood in 1907.
With Moyer and Pettibone, two other leaders of the West-
ern Federation of Miners, he was framed in 1905 for the
murder of "an ex-Governor of the State of Idaho. In a trial
which last 83 days and became, incidentally, Senator Wil-
liam E. Borah’s ﬁrst stepping stone to fame and fortune
(he represen-ted the state) Big Bill smashed through the
shabby structure thrown up by the prosecution and the
silver mining interests behind it. With magniﬁcent pre-
cision he destroyed the plot designed to put a rope around
his neck. He unclothed all its machinations—his kidnapping
in Colorado, illegal transfer to Idaho where all three of the
intended victims were kept in jail for eighteen months
awaiting trial, the brazen decision of the United States
Supreme Court which coolly exonerated all the violations
of the law practised against -the defendants.

Big Bill Haywood brought right into the court room
the crimes committed against hundreds of miners and their
families by the silver mining interests. During one strike in
Idaho, 800 men were taken from the mines in their work-
‘ing clothes and driven into a few box cars and an old barn
turned into “Bu1l Pens.” For three weeks they remained
under bayonet guard with no beds to sleep on, little food,

\46

 

 

no defense. Several died and many contracted lingering and
serious diseases. Bill Haywood defendedythem all—not only
himself. He became the accuser instead of the accused.

He organized a defense campaign that blazed. across the

country. He got a labor jury to sit alongside of the “regular” _

jury for the duration of the trial. He even drew the cam-
paign posters—immortalizing in one of them the statement
made by an army officer in charge of persecuting striking
miners in response to their demand for constitutional rights:
“Habeas corpus hell. We’ll givedem post-mortems.” And
beside it he put the ringing slogan launched by Eugene V.
Debs in the Haywood-Moyer-Pettibone defense: “Arouse ye
slaves, their only crime is their loyaltyto the working class.”

Big Bill Haywood won. Completeacquittal. The cases
against Moyer and Pettibone. were dropped.

The frame-up system was not destroyed by this victory.
It reached new heights—or slimier depths—in the now world
famous Mooney-Billings case, in hundreds of other labor
cases, in -the Scottsboro case. It is still in. use and it still
works though its_eﬂiciency has been greatly impaired by
militant labor defense and an ever more powerful trade
union movement. In stands—a grim hideous blot. on the
history of American civil liberties. ’

CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE U.S.A.

HE civil liberties of the American people are today
Tthreatened withdisaster-—with wholesale violation on a
scale unprecedented in the history of our country. They
are threatened with the blackout that has swept across
western’Europe, leaving a grim line of concentration camps
and corpses in its wake. In Germany, Spain, Czechoslo-
vakia, France, England the proud gains of proud peoples
have been pulverized and trampled into the blood-soaked
ground. The warmongers of America are rushing with
obscene haste to bring about the same state of affairs on this
continent. ‘

It is well at this crucial moment to examine_the history of
our civil liberties and more especially the struggles in which
they were won.

President Roosevelt, Attorney General Jackson, F.B.I.-
Hoover, Martin Dies (who now has RooseveIt’s open bless-
ing) are riding high astride “Trojan Horses” shouting:
“Fifth column!—-Sabotage!—Parachute!” They have given
oﬂicial sanction to vigilantism against all opponents of war
and terror and oppression. V.

Citizens of the United States have been called upon to
act as spies against their neighbors. Americans exercising
their legal, constitutional right to-collect signatures on elec-
tion petitions ‘are slugged, threatened" with lynching by
carefully organized mobs aided and abetted by the police.‘

The Congress of the United States is on a rampage
against the Bill of Rights.

One House passes a measure transferring the Bureau of

3

 

forces of so-called law enforcement, headed by the Depart-
ment of Justice, are studying the earlier‘ period with great
care, sifting through the records and the methods in search
of those which brought the best results (though determined

A to carry it off more smoothly this time and within the frame-

work of constitutional forms, if possible) is already clear
from the opening guns ﬁred at the Communist Party since
September, 1939. x

In 1914 it was the I.’W.W., which most effectively mobil—-
ized working class opposition to the war and struggle
against the war proﬁteers, that was singled out for smother-
ing. Less than two months‘ after this country was swept into
the World War, 50,000 lumberjacks and 40,000 miners were
out on strike under “VVobbly” leadership in Montana,
Arizona and the Northwest. Protection of dizzily mounting’
war proﬁts required persecution of those who threatened
the loot by strikes and demands for higher wages. Between
3, 500 and 4,000 were arrested. By July, 1918, there had been
1,606 trials. Several hundred received long jail sentences.
Behind the slogan, “The I.W.W. is being paid by German
gold to hamper the war,” enemies of labor cracked down on
all militants. Twelve hundred miners in Bisbee, Arizona,
struck for higher wages. They were deported into the New
Mexico desert by 2,000 armed_thugs. Frank Little, crippled
I.W.W. organizer in the copper ﬁelds of Montana, was
lynched. Free speech became a legend. One victim of the war
terror on the West Coast where it was particularly sharp
summed it up neatly: “All you had to do was stand on a
street corner and say ‘fellow-worker’ and it was $100 ﬁne
or 60 days.” Protest from defenders of free speech was an-
swered by cops snarling: “Constz'tutz'on, hell.”

The procedure in most of the I.W.W. trials was really
very simple. Membership was the sole charge sought. It was
generally proved by three professional prosecution wit-

48

 

 

nesses: john Dymond, Elbert Coutes and W. E. Townsend,
who got $250 per trial for doing a sort of act on the witness
stand that might have been entitled: “The crimes I com-
mitted while a member of the I.W.W.”

The grand ﬁnale of the World War drive against the
Wobbliescame in September, 1917, in the mass trial of 115
of its leaders including Big Bill Haywood. Charged under
the newly-passed Espionage Act (June 5, 1917), with “con-
spiring to obstruct war work” 93 were convicted and given
sentences totaling 807 years. Haywood got twenty years.

What was meant to be the body blow to .the I.W.W. came
after the war, during the anti-Red hysteria inspired by fear
of the successful revolution in Russia. It was struck in Cen-
tralia, Washington, in the heart of the lumber country. The
Centralia Protective Association, the Chamber of Com-
merce and the American Legion got orders from the lumber
trusts to mop up. So they staged an Armistice Day parade

on November 11, 1919, routed to pass I.W.W. headquarters.‘

Warned of impending violence, a handful of Wobblies
prepared to defend themselves from’ inside their hall. The
parade came along led by Postmaster Thomas H. McCleary
and ex-Mayor Thompson, each carrying coils of rope. The
signal was a long whistle. Fire opened on the hall. It was
answered from the inside, led by Wesley Everest, recently
demobilized World W'ar veteran, still in uniform. The
armed mob broke through and Everest was shot down shout-
ing: “You haven’t got the guts to lynch a man in the day-
time.” He was right. They waited for darkness to ﬁnish the
job.

The Centralia trial followed. Thirteen Wobblies were
accused of murder. The judge opened with a eulogy of the
dead vigilantes. Legionnaires in uniform were paid four
dollars a day by the lumber interests to sit in the court
room in uniform. A detachment of the United States Army

49

 

 

was quartered on the courthouse lawn. Marines were added
later. The jury, out twenty-two hours and twenty minutes,
was reprimanded for leniency and sent back by the judge
with the instructions to bring in harsher verdicts. Eight
men got twenty-ﬁve to forty years at hard labor each. The
last of them, Ray Becker, was ﬁnally released in 1939.
Militant political resistance to the United States’ entry
and participation in the World War was prosecuted on
charges ranging from “obstructing the draft” to “treason”
and “espionage.” Some 1,500 men and women were victim-
ized by the Espionage and other special war laws. A good
many of the offenses were as trivial as remarks made in
private conversation. Conscientious Objectors judged “in-
sincere” were turned over to military courts as “disobedient
soldiers.” About ﬁve hundred men drew long prison sen-
tences in Alcatraz, Leavenworth and Fort Douglas from
these distinguished bodies. Outstanding victims of World

. War prosecution were Eugene Victor Debs, Charles E. Ruth-

enberg, Earl Browder, Big Bill Haywood, Rose Pastor Stokes
and Kate Richards O’-Hare. ‘ A

The constitutional question involved in most of these
cases was whether or not the Bill of Rights could be sus-
pended in times of war. Though the Constitution nowhere
makes anything like such a provision, that debate is still
"raking today.

Rose Pastor Stokes, for making an anti—war speech to a
woman’s club in Kansas City, got ten years under the Es-
pionage Act. Kate Richards O’Hare got ﬁve years in the
Missouri State Penitentiary for calling the war an imperial-
ist war in North Dakota on July 17, 1917, and adding that
women should not consent to become brood sows for cannon
fodder. Charles Ruthenberg got one year for a short speech
in Canton, Ohio, adjudged “conspiracy to obstruct the
draft.”

50

 

 

.Eugen.e Victor Debs made a speech in the same city, pro-
testing against the previous convictions and urging- a state
convention of the Socialist Party to oppose the war. He said: 

; “I have just returned from Canton Prison where
f A three of our most loyal comrades are paying -the penalty
for their devotion to the working class. They have
come to realize, as many of us have, that it is extreme-
ly dangerous to exercise the constitutional right of free
speech in a country ﬁghting to make democracy safe
for the world. They may put those boys in jail but
they cannot put the Socialist movement in jail.”

For this speech he got ten years on September 14, 1917.
The jury was composed entirely of wealthy men whose
average age was seventy. Debs’ speech in court is one of the “
truly masterful defenses of the rights of the American :1
people:

“I have been accused of having obstructed the war.
I admit it. Gentlemen, I abhor war. When I think of a
cold, glittering steel bayonet being plunged in the
white quivering ﬂesh of a human being, I recoil with
horror. Yes, 1 am opposed to the war. I am perfectly
willing on that count to be branded as a disloyalist
and if it is a crime under the American law, punish-
able by imprisonment, to be opposed to human blood-
shed, I am perfectly willing to be clothed in the stripes
of a convict and to end my days in a prison cell. . . .
It is because I happen to be in the minority of the true
inheritors of the revolutionary traditions of America
that I stand in your presence today charged with crime.
It is because I believe as the revolutionary fathers
believed in their day that a change was due in the in-
terests of the people, that the time had come for a better
form of government, an improved system, a nobler
humanity, and a grander civilization. . ”

Debs was no paciﬁst. He stated clearly:

“No, I am not opposed to all war, nor am I opposed
51

to ﬁghting under all circumstances, and any declara-
tion to the contrary would disqualify me as a revolu-
tionist. . . . I am opposed to every war but one; I am for
that war with heart and soul, and that is the world-
wide war of the social revolution. . . . While I have
not a drop of blood to shed for the oppressors of the
working c ass and the robbers of the poor . . . whose de-
bauched misrule is the crime of the ages, I have a heart
full to shed for their victims when it shall be needed
in the war for their liberation.”

On March 10, 1919, six months after the war that he was
sentenced for ‘_‘obstructing” was over, the United States
Supreme Court upheld the verdict against Eugene Victor
Debs. After announcing from his cell in Atlanta Peniten-
tiary, that he was not at all surprised by the decision of a
“coterie of begowned corporation lawyers” Debs added:

“Great issues are not decided in the courts, but by
the people. The court of ﬁnal resort is the people and
that court will be heard from in due time.”

The decision in the Debs case was not the only post-war
“war-time” prosecution. On January 8, 1919, ﬁve leaders of
the Socialist Party including Victor Berger and J. Louis
Engdahl, arrested ‘in a raid on Chicago Socialist headquar-
ters, were sentenced, on a secret indictment, to twenty years
each in Leavenworth by Judge Kennesaw Mountain Landis.

Many of the victims of the World War attack on civil
rights remained in jail long after the war was over. Debs
and twenty-four others were ﬁnally pardoned at Christmas,
1921. A dozen or so were released after a Children's Crusade
to Washington led by Kate Richards O’Hare brought
amnesty for their fathers. President Coolidge pardoned the
last thirty-one war-time prisoners for Christmas, 1923. By

1928, 1,500 victims of ‘the Espionage Act (suspended March
3, 1921), and related measures, had still not had their citi-

59~

 

zenship rights restored. And they didn't get them back till
Christmas, 1933. ‘

Unprecedented as it was in American history, the black-
out of civil rights during the World War was only a pre-
lude to the delirium which followed in what has come to
be known as the Palmer Days. A Mitchell Palmer (:1 Quaker

like Herbert Hoover) became Attorney General of the

United States in March, 1919. The record of brutality,
forgery and frame-up practised by the Department of Jus-
tice under this maniacal regime is indelibly recorded and
uncontroverted in the Report on the Department of Justice
prepared by Dean Roscoe Pound of the Harvard Law
School’ and eleven equally distinguished and unassailable
colleagues.

Palmer made the Department of Justice into an agency
for stimulating lawlessness. With Government funds and
machinery, he conducted a publicity campaign "frankly
dubbed a “Red Crusade” to poison the public mind against
all his intended victims. Thugs, scabs, employers’ as-
sociations were recruited and paid for to conduct Govern-
ment raids. The Department of Labor Bureau of Immigra-
tion became just another club in his hands. He got it to
issue batches of warrants for deportation in exchange for
batches of affidavits of “probable cause.” He got it to set bail
as high as $10,000. 1

The ﬁrst big Palmer raid was staged on November 7,
1919, in eleven cities simultaneously. Complete exposure of
the illegal, unconstitutional manner of their seizure and
conviction did not stop Palmer from getting 249 persons
caught in his dragnet, deported on the S.S. Buford on De-
cember 21, 1921.

His second big show was staged on January 2, 1920, with
the» stage enlarged to include thirty-three cities. Palmer
had secured 3,000 warrants in advance from the Department

53

 

    

  

of Labor. Official reports put the number of those arrested
at 2,500. It was probably nearer 6,500. In all, the Palmer
raids netted 6,000 victims on deportation warrants; 4,000
were held of whom 3,000 had to be unconditionally turned
loose. Most of those arrested were seized at indiscriminate
raids on meetings-—educational and recreation, open to the
public or private gatherings. All those present were hauled
off to police stations or hastily-created temporary detention
centers——he1d incommunicado, third degreed, forced to sign
statements. Many were seized when their homes were broken
intotand searched without warrants. In Boston, the Depart-
ment of Justice marched its “catch” through the streets in
chains. ' V

The most famous victims of Palmer’s deportation de-
lirium were “the good shoemaker and the poor ﬁsh peddler,”
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. It took their execu-
tioners seven years to get their prey, but their arrest, frame-
up on charges of murder and robbery are traceable to the
fact that they were on Palmer’s blacklist as “dangerous
aliens to be watched.” It was a perfect set—up for the local
witch-hunters of Bridgewater, Massachusetts, when they
“caught” Sacco and Vanzetti and were able to pin an un-
solved payroll murder-robbery on them at. the same time.
At the time of their arrest in 1920 there was in their pos-
session the text of a leaﬂet calling a protest meeting on the
occasion of the death of a Palmer raid victim, Andrea
Salsedo, who was thrown or forced to jump from the
eleventh ﬂoor of the Department of Justice's office in New
York. He was being third degreed there after being held
incommunicado for eleven weeks.

That infamous excuse, “consciousness of guilt,” which
served the murderers of Sacco and Vanzetti so well, can also
be laid at the door of Palmer. Spidery Judge Webster
Thayer, who boasted during the trial: “Wait till you see

54;

 

what I'll do to those anarchistic bastards” hid behind it
when he sentenced them to death. President Lowell of Har-
vard, head of an “impartial” commission set up by Governor
Fuller to investigate the case, calmly threw the switch that
took their lives, because of it. Sacco and Vanzetti were mur-
dered for showing “consciousness of guilt” because they told
conﬂicting stories at the time of their arrest. They were
shielding themselves and their comrades from what they
were sure was another attack by Palmer’s deportation blood
hounds. Their real “crime” was described by Vanzetti: “I
wan-ted a roof for every family, bread for every mouth,
education for every heart, the light for every intellect.”
Th¢vPalmer hysteria was followed by a series of uncon-
stitutional laws which contaminated the statute books of
thirty-six states by 1930; These so-called criminal syndical-
ism laws were primarily concerned with “utterances” and
“advocacy” of the bugaboo “force and violence.” Directed
mainly against the trade unions, they also served to strike
at the newly-organized Communist Party, twenty-two of
whose leaders were seized in a raid at Bridgeman, Michigan,
and persecuted under Michigan’s criminal syndicalism law.
It is important to note that the Minnesota Criminal Syn-
dicalism Law was passed in 1917 upon the heels of the great
Mesabi Range iron ore strike. Illinois’ law followed the
Packing House strike of that same /year. The Steel strike
of 1919 brought more of them. By January, 1921, 1,100
persons had been prosecuted under criminal syndicalism
laws most of which are still in operation. An International
Labor Defense victory won in the case of Dirk de Jonge
before the United States Supreme Court in 1937 not only
freed him from a seven-year sentence, but led to the aboli-
tion of the Oregon criminal syndicalism law under which
he was prosecuted and which had taken a heavy toll of
victims in that state. Repercussions of that victory led to the

55

 

 

wiping out or modiﬁcation of criminal syndicalism laws
in eight states.

THE history of civil liberties since World War days pre-
sents a varied and hectic panorama. Every movement
for improvement of conditions in the aftermath of the crash
of 1929 whether it was for the payment of the bonus to
starving World War veterans; or the demand for bread for
hungry children; or attempts to strengthen unions, hit stag-
gering blows by the crisis—each step in the road to jobs
and security meant overcoming obstacles placed there by
reaction. And the people fought in defense of the right
to live. _

A march of time throughthose years would recall such
sequels as Hoover's shooting of the Bonus Marchers at the
very steps of the nation’s capitol in 1932 when they peace-
ably assembled to petition the Government for redress of

W grievances; bloody beating and killings of the starving un-

employed between 1929 and 1933 in Chicago, Cleveland and
New York; bloody Harlan; Kentucky. It contains such
bright chapters as the ﬁnal freeing after twenty-two years

of Tom Mooney and Warren K. Billings, the liberation of ‘

four of the nine innocent Scottsboro Boys; decisions de-
claring local anti-leaﬂet ordinances unconstitutional and
in violation of the rights of freedom of speech and of the
press; the clipping of Mayor Hague’s wings; a testimonial
to the growing might of the trade union movement; the
heroic march to the polls by organized bodies of Negro
citizens in the face of K.K.K. threats of wholesale lynchings.

But the past year has been ﬁlled with danger signals
warning of renewed assault on the rights and liberties of

56

 

E

the American people. The ghost of Mitchell Palmer stalks V

again in the national legislature—his antics echoed in such
proposed laws as the Hobbs Concentration Camp bill, the
Dempsey Bill to deport all aliens who advocate “any
change” in the present form of government of the United
States or who belong to organizations favoring change. In
1920 Palmer asked for a law providing twenty years’ im-
prisonment as the penalty for “any act of hate against the
United States Government.” (Those who fought it used to
ask whether spitting on a postage stamp would come under
its provisions.) William  Burns, Palmer's head of the De-
partment of justice Investigating Bureau, demanded half a
milliogydollars more than his assigned appropriation to
“ﬁght the growing Red menace.” J. Edgar Hoover and his
F.B.I. want more money too-to perfect his system of terror
by index cards as it was so aptly dubbed by Congressman
Vito Marcantonio, the only member of the national legis-
lature to challenge this proposed rule by a “super secret
police, a Gestapo.” Hoover claims to have a beautiful sys-
tem of index cards, arranged alphabetically and geographi-
cally. It will enable him, he says, if he gets the extra appro-
priation—to nab at a moment’s notice—every person on his
index of possible committers of espionage or sabotage in
the event of grave» emergency. .

Attorney General Palmer's men raided homes without
warrants. Attorney General Jackson's men carried some
papers when they raided the homes of Detroit citizens
in February, 1940, breaking into them at 5 A.M., dragging
their victims to Federal jails to be held incommunicado on
charges of “recruiting for Loyalist Spain” under a law dat-
ing back to 1818! Indignant nationwide protest—-and no

hysterical blitzkrieg against all the dearly-won rights and
liberties of the people. ‘

These rights—freedom of speech, press, assembly, life,

the conscious creation of a war hysteria: scatter the forces
of progress by sniping at isolated persons in its ranks; whip
up “conspiracy-spy” scares; keep moving onward in the con-
certed drive to behead the forces of peace and liberty.

But the guerilla warfare on the Communist Party and its
leaders, conducted by the Department of Justice, begun
shortly after the outbreak of the second imperialist war,
using ﬂimsy technical charges of “passport fraud,” coun-
tenancing local round-ups, breaking up of meetings, threats
to cripple that Party's press——are sufficiently alarming signals
of what lies ahead for all who say “The Yanks Are Not
Coming” unless the battle for civil rights in America as-
sumes the proportions warranted by the well-prepared at-
tack now in progress against them.

The antics of the witch-hunting Dies Committee can no
longer hide the sinister, warmongering intentions of those
backing its assault on the Bill of Rights. It began by using
stool-pigeons, gutter-rats, men and women cast out of labor
and progressive organizations for their destructive activities,
whose lying “testimony” was to raise a red-scare smokescreen
from behind which Martin Dies and Co. could snipe at the
rights and liberties of the American people.,Failing in this
tactic, Mr. Dies has now turned to open terrorism against
progressives and their leaders. His agents raided the oﬂices
of two legal organizations in Philadelphia, the International
Workers Order and the Communist Party, illegally carrying
off two truck loads ‘of materials found there (they have
since been forced to return their “find” and the agents re-
sponsible were ordered arrested); they flew to Pittsburgh
to demand membership lists of the Communist Party; they
got local stooges in Birmingham to arrest a young attorney
engaged by the Communist Party and to hold him as a host-
age for the address of the Alabama leader of that Party.
Mr. Dies got a punch-drunk ‘Congress (with the notable

58

 

 

exception of Congressman Marcantonio of New York and
Congressman Matthew Dunn of Pennsylvania who _were.the
only two to vote no) to pervert a power intended as political
protection of citizens by voting citations of contempt against

V committee witnesses who refused to provide Dies and his

masters with blacklists of militants. Dies agents are making
their own blacklists by seizing election petitions as in West
Virginia.

The aim is clear-crush political minorities, destroy the
labor and progressive movement, disarm this mighty mo-
bilization of the peace-loving people of the country, then
you can more easily plunge the country into war.

The lg¥..K. rides again, its strength replenished by mys-
terious propaganda funds. Citizens are kidnapped and
flogged in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida. Crosses burned
in New Jersey and Oregon. It is striking all over the coun-
try, now adding to its oldest stock-in-trade of anti-Negro
poison, attacks on the Jews in particular, aliens in general
and the Communist Party first of all. It’s latest slogan is
signiﬁcant: “No job for any alien as long as a single Ameri-
can is unemployed.”

Couple this slogan with the constantly mounting Ku Klux

- legislation depriving foreign-born workers of relief, the right

-to jobs on public works, even the right to live in Govern-
ment housing projects if one member of the family is not a
citizen~and you can easily see where it’s all leading. Starve
the unemployed. It will then be easier to get them killed
off in the army raised to make the world safe for Wall
Street investments. '

The heavy artillery against the organized labor movement
has not yet been moved up to the ﬁring line. Union-busting
has not only taken on the usual form of unconstitutional
local legislation banning picketing, parading, striking, but

it has been more vigorous expressed in the open warfare of
vigilantism.

In 1934 a West Coast maritime strike which grew into a
general strike was marked by the murder of ﬁve strikers,
wholesale arrests, vigilante raids on ‘union halls, head-
quarters and printing plants right in’ the ‘ city of San
Francisco. '

Only two years ago, Ca1ifornia‘had two “purges” con-
ducted by vigilantes. Whole communities of men, women
and children were turned‘ out of their homes and sent to

' camp as refugees on the lawn of the State capitol at Sacra-

mento. The ﬁrst was the battle of Nevada City where 250
striking gold miners after six months of daily sluggings were
rounded up, dragged from their beds, leaders thrown into
jail with the choice of leaving or lynching and driven out
of town with clubs, lead pipes and riﬂe-butts. The next day,
the City Council passed a shameless resolution congratulat-
ing itself on the successful “purge.” A few weeks later a
similar assault was repeated on a larger scale against lumber
workers in Redwood City. At the very end of 1939, a cease-
less war on the rights of lumber workers in Washington,
especially on members of the International Woodworkers
of America, broke loose in a vigilate raid on the Finnish
Workers Hallin Aberdeen——literal'ly'ripped apart with the

_ connivance of local police—and followed by the murder of

Mrs. Laura Law, the wife of a militant union man.

John Steinbeck has written indelibly into the history of
American life the treatment of the migratory workers wan-
dering to golden valleys in search of work and food. Lead-
ing in the vigilante terror against. this group of disinherited

is the Associated Farmers, whose axe-handle brigades are A
financed by such “farmers” as the Southern Paciﬁc Rail-

road, the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, Paciﬁc
60 ’

 

 

Gas and Electric, etc. Millions of dollars is being poured
into the same union-busting mold.

Two attempts at nationwide vigilante organization have
been disclosed thus far. E. C. Crow, editor of the official
organ of the lumber interests, is calling for a continental
organization to break the back of organized labor in the
Northwest and on the V/Vest Coast and, as he says, to pre-
vent such setbacks for employers as the freeing of Harry
Bridges.

An earlier attempt was made-during the steel strike of
1937. The ﬁrst step was the introduction of scab-herder
Pearl Bergofs Mohawk Valley Formula for undermining
incipient union activity. Then came Tom Girdler’s open
call for bloodshed heeded in Chicago where ten strikers
were mowed down by police bullets in the Memorial Day
massacre. Finally there was the call for national afﬁliation
to the Johnstown Citizens Committee whose distinguished

leadership ranged from steel magnates (behind the scenes) _

to ex-convict Mayor Danny Shields and his tin-hatted thugs.
That move was stopped short in its tracks by the sterling
courage and clear sightedness of the steel workers them-
selves organized in the C.I.O., supported by the nationwide
protest of progressive defense forces from coast to coast.
Where and when it will be tried again is not predictable.
The menace of vigilantism is being aided and nourished by
such hysteria-creating outﬁts as the Dies Committee. The
Administration's “meeting force with force” proclamations
further ﬁll the air with sound and fury that is music to

‘vigilantes for it is always their hope that the voice of strug-

gle will be drowned out and their effectiveness destroyed.
There is the murkier shadow of M-Day, carefully plotted
and prepared for war-time extinction of the last vestige of
the rights of the American people. Industrial mobilization
entrusted to the tender hands of President Roosevelt’s

National Defense Commission whose members include U.S.
Steel's President Stettinius, General Motor’s Mr. Knudsen
and “labor’s” Sidney Hillman; the Joint Army and Navy
Munitions Board whose activities include, according to
Major Paul Logan of the Army Industrial College, “indus-
trial allocations.”
What is “industrial allocations”? The Major explains:

“At the present time over 10,000 factories are allo-
cated for war-time production. Some of these are very
large. For example, the General Motors Corporation is
considered as one single allocation. The amazing part
of this work . . . is t e intense spirit of patriotism of
the businessmen of this country and the unselﬁsh and
unlimited cooperation which they give to the armed
services. One large company in the East prepared a
factory plan for wartime operation which cost them
over $20,000. . .  - '

He adds: L

“Labor in our factories and on-our farms, especially
skilled labor, is equally important to the war as are
soldiers on the battlefront. The sufficiency of labor
must be assured to war industries. Labor disputes with
industry must not be permitted to interfere with the
production program. . . 

M-Day is prepared to take care of all such contingencies
with legislation all worked out and ready for speedy passage
as soon as it is needed!

The‘ dizziest armament budget in American history—in-
troduced by a hysterical call to fear and panic by the Presi-
dent of the United States—is being stampeded through a
Congress in which only one voice is raised in opposition,
that of Vito Marcantonio, who courageously voted “No.”

Anti-Semitism, anti-foreign-born, anti—Communist senti-
ments are encouraged by a punch-drunk reactionary press.

62

 

 

Fascist methods and theories ﬁnd fertile soil among
American reactionaries who have them refurbished and be-
spangled with the ﬂag in which they wrap themselves.

For every blow at the Bill of Rights an answering blow
for democracy is struck by the progressive forces of our
country. The economic royalist of today may have replaced
the British tyrant, the Hamiltonian Tory, the landed aristo-
crat of the past. But Henry Ford and other representatives
of the sixty families who own the greatest portion of this
country's wealth, Hearst and their spokesmen in national
and state governments, Wall Street and the National As-
sociation of wnufacturers wish to carry out the basic aim
of reaction—to deprive the people of their civil rights in
order more easily to keep them economically and politically
enslaved. They hope to achieve their aim with or without
the aid of “law and order,” and certainly without the Bill of
Rights. The Roosevelt Administration and the Democratic
Party, facing an election, is bidding for reaction’s favor by
cracking down on labor, the unemployed, political minori-
ties, slashing at the beginnings of social legislation thus far
won by the people. The Republicans promise to do an even
better job for American ﬁnance capital if the reins of gov-
ernment are thrown to them.

We, the people, achieved our charter of liberty in con-
flict with these forces through the centuries. Every right is
ours because of the blood and sweat and years of struggle
that went into the winning. We have defended it against
every attempt at emasculation, destruction, black-out.‘

The ultimate fate of our freedom lies in our hands. They
may be gnarled and knotted but they are powerful and
many. Obstacles lie ahead in the path of progress and liberty
and justice; the path itself winds through diﬂicult passes-
but the ﬁnal goal is clear and its achievement never for a
moment in doubt.

TI-IE BILL A OF RIGHTS

“Wheneverl any Form of Government -becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the right of the
, People to-alter or abolish it.”

c; E HOLD these truths to be self-evident,” says the

WDeclaration of Independence. But the battle-axes
who lead the good ladies of the D'.A.R.' sputter “subversive”
and “un-American” or maybe “propaganda” hoping to

drown out the simple truth _that the “R” in what has come .

to be their badge of bigotry stands for “Revolution.”
Their counterparts in the Dies Committee and its
stooges, that variety of patriot who goes about wrapped in
the night shirt of the Ku Klux Klan or hiding behind the
dubious authority of a deputy sheriff's tin shield and blood-
stained club, wave “Red" herrings to o/bscure—they hope-
another simple truth: that “this country with .its'institu-
tions belongs to the people who inhabit it."’l V
Especially does the whole crew of reaction wish to de-
stroy the fundamental truth that only through struggle-
through long years of valiant, bitter battle against oppres-
sion—were any of the rights and liberties of the American
people won. But like John Brown’s body,ythe truth goes
marching on—and so does the struggle. , - , - _

Take the Bill of Rights. Almost two centuries——roughly
from 1620 to 1791—were spent in struggle to create it and
make it part of the Constitution of the United States.

The Bill of Rights was born in colonial times when to
“speak evil of the King or to villify the London Compan.y”*
brought the death penalty. It was born in the contracts
of the bond servants, redemptioners, indentured servants“
who were sold to the highest bidder from auction blocks
set up beside the ships which brought them to these
shores, or who were chained together by speculators who
marched them through the countryside for resale. Father,
mother, children often went to different buyers..All could
be and were ﬂogged. In both the civil and criminal codes
these people, who made up the vast majority of America's
workers, were classiﬁed with chattel slaves from whom they
differed only in the fact that they were sold ‘for a limited
time.

The Bill of Rights was born in the hopes of those

 

seekers after liberty who dreamed to establish a new way .

of life in a new and unknown world; in the words of

Roger Williams, hounded by the Dies Committees of his .

day into exile for championing his ideals; in the spirit
of Mistress Annie Hutchinson who was tried and sentenced
into banishment where she was slaughtered by the Indians.

Roger Williams said in the 163o’s and defended his
right to say it:

“The Soveraigne power of all civill authority is
founded in the consent of the people.‘ . . . And if so
that a people may erect and establish what forme of
Government seems to them most meete for their civill
condition; it is evident, that such Governments as are
by them erected and established, have no more power,

“Chartered companies received grants from the king “to all the
lands, woods, soil, grounds, havens", ports, rivers, mines, marshes,
ﬁshing, commodities, hereditaments whatsoever.”

“" Bond servants—generally convicts; redemptioners——had to ﬁnd
someone in this ‘country to redeem their passage costs; indentured
servants-—signed an indenture contract in Europe for the repayment
of their passage costs.

6

 

nor for no longer time, than the civill power or people
consenting and agreeing shall betrust them w1th.”

Mistress Hutchinson “maintained a meeting and assem-
bly at her house that hath been condemned as a thing not
honorable nor comely in the sight of God nor ﬁtting ‘for
her sex.” It was a prayer meeting for women at which she
not only deﬁed the prohibition of such gatherings but
exercised what she ﬁrmly believed to be her right to her
own interpretation of what is good, just and honest. Annie
Hutchinson, who came to the new world with her husband

' among the ﬁrst settlers in search of freedom, was cruelly

grilled by a Massachusetts court for three days. She stuck
by her guns, refused to recant her heresy. She moreover
maintained that the “same rights of individual judgment
upon religious questions should be accorded to woman
which the Reformation had already secured to men.”

The people fought on for the Bill of Rights._ Some landed

on the gallows, others in the stocks. But gradually they_

began to land as duly-elected delegates in the Stamp Act
Congresses, the ﬁrst gatherings of colonists to consider
redress of grievances at the hands of England; in the ranks
of the Sons of Liberty, in the Committees of Correspon-
dence and Safety——America’s ﬁrst revolutionary. organiza-
tions. They rallied at Lexington and Concord where the
ﬁrst shots of the Revolutionary War for freedom from
British imperial tyranny were ﬁred. It took four years of
war and another decade still to forge into words and law
the aspirationsof a freedom-loving people as expressed in
the Bill of Rights. _

Thomas Paine, most eloquent spokesman of the cause
of liberty, wrote its prelude in 1776. He wrote it on drum-
heads at Revolutionary army campﬁres to inspire the
ﬁghters:
