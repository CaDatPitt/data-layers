against labor and the Negro people, indicted, arrested, pic-A

tu_red in the F.B.I. Rogues’ Gallery, put under heavy bail,
denied freedom of motion and rushed to trial for their obvious
criminal acts? No, Tom Clark is too busy indicting the 12

4 Communist leaders for advocating Socialism, a system which

 

would make such deeds impossible. I've seen pickets and
strike leaders arrested by the hundreds and innocent workers
framed up, like Tom Mooney and Sacco and Vanzetti, like
Eugene Debs and Joe Hill—but I have yet to see a mine owner,
mob leader, trigger-happy copper, strike-breaking thug, vigi-
lante or gunman, punished for crimes against the people. I
hope to live that long, dear reader. '

The Smith Act, under which the Communist Party leaders
are now indicted, was passed in April, 1940. There are two
indictments. One is for conspiracy, in which all twelve are
named. The other is an individual indictment, speciﬁcally
dealing with membership in the Communist Party. The man
on the street could logically ask why the Government waited
eight years if “a dangerous group of reds” were trying all this
time to overthrow our Government by force and violence?
Why does the indictment only cover from 1945 on, when the
Communist Party has been in existence for the last twenty-nine
years—-since September, 1919? Is it because during World War
II there were 15,000 members of the Communist Party in
the armed forces of the'U.S.A., or one out of every six members
of our Party, using force and violence to defeat fascism? That
would surely have been an ‘inconvenient time to charge Com-
munists with such an indictment, wouldn't it? Four of the
twelve‘ defendants were in the armed forces—Robert Thomp-
son, John Gates, Henry Winston and Gus Hall. All were hon-
orably discharged. Thompson won the Distinguished Service
Cross for extraordinary heroism in action in the South Paciﬁc;
Gates was a paratrooper in Europe. Both of these men fought
in Spain, against the fascists. Thompson was badly injured

both in Spain and New Guinea. Gates led some of the bloodiest ‘

battles on the Ebro in Spain. Gus Hall served in the Navy,
during the war. Henry Winston, Communist Negro, fought on
the European front. He handled military cargo at Antwerp,
under bomb ﬁre. In February, 1947, Presiden-t Truman wrote
to George Earle, former governor of Pennsylvania: “People of
10

  

this country are wrought up about the ‘Communist bugaboo’
but I am of the opinion that the country is perfectly safe as
far as Communism is concerned.” Where was the great “con-
spiracy” then? Isn’t it odd that it's alleged just the last three
years, when we fought Mr. Truman’s policies? His Department
of Justice whipped it up neatly on the eve of the Wallace
third party convention in Philadelphia, which should fool
nobody. It did not fool Henry Wallace who said: “The
indictments are, I feel, an attempt to promote new fears. They
are another series of diversions created for Americans who are
-complaining about mounting inﬂation, the stupid bungling in
Berlin and other problems. Both the administration and the
bipartisans in Congress make allegations to make headlines,
make headlines to make fear, and make fear to stay in power.
. . . Defense of the civil rights of Communists is the ﬁrst line
in the defense of the liberties of a democratic people. The
history of Germany, Italy, Japan and Franco-Spain should
teach us that the suppression of the Communists is but the
ﬁrst step in an assault on the democratic rights of labor,
national, social and political minorities and all who oppose
the policies of the government in power.” .

In the indictment, which the New York silk-stocking jury
labored over for over a year, there is no charge of the actual
commission of a single act of force and violence, not even as
much as throwing a brick. Advocating ideas, namely the
Socialist principles of Marxism-Leninism, is the core of the
indictments. The question at issue is—do these ideas constitute
advocating force and violence? We say they do not and that
what the Government is trying to do is outlaw the advocacy
of Socialism. "In the New York Times Sunday magazine section
on August 22, Professor Henry Steele Commager writes on
“Should We Outlaw the Communist -Party?” He is a professor
of history at Columbia University. His conclusions, after a

‘lengthy analysis, are as follows: “On all these grounds then,
. it would seem unwise to outlaw the Communist Party or to

punish those whose only crime is membership in that party.
It is unwise because it would surely fail of its objective. It is
unwise because it would be a grave_ departure from our tradi-
tions of law and constitutionalism. It is unwise because it
would endanger the position of other non-conformist groups,
prove an entering wedge to the" suppression of freedom of
11

speech and thought, and open the gates to the kind of despo-

tism that is most pernicious. It is unwise because it would
deny to our people and our Government the advantages of
criticism, which, whatever its animus,» is essential to our health
and prosperity.” A

The real issue in this trial will be “Can ideas be put in jail?”
People can, but the whole history of the human race has

proved it is impossible to imprison ideas. The cruciﬁxion of V

Jesus and the violent deaths of all the apostles who preached
his words; the torture of Galileo; the exiling of Roger Williams
and Anne Hutchinson, did not succeed in killing their ideas.

A We did not seek this opportunity to present our views on a

world scale. But since the Government compels us to do so,
we will use it for all it's worth. Not one American will be so
remote or isolated that our message will not reach him or her
during this historic trial. Millions will know that as Gene
Debs and Bill Haywood and their comrades represented the
cause of the workers before the courts in the 20's, that Bill
Foster, Gene Dennis, Ben Davis and their comrades repre-
sent it today. W-ho deprives the people of food, who wants
war, who uses force and violence, will be exposed by this
trial.

There isn’t one of these twelve men you would not ﬁnd it
a real treat to sit down with to talk over your own problems
as well as national and world affairs. For instance, Benjamin
]. Davis, Jr., is a City Councilman, elected twice over as a Com-
munist, on Manhattan Island. Born in Georgia, as a lawyer
he defended Angelo Herndon and the Scottsboro boys in those
infamous frame-up cases against the Negro people—his people.
He has led delegations to Washington against the poll-tax,
for an anti-lynch law, for adequate F.E.P.C., for the end of
discrimination in the armed forces and has been a thorn in

the side of the hypocritical Truman administration in his ,

demand for civil rights now for the Negro people. He has
equally challenged G.O.P.’s candidate Dewey on similar issues
within our state and especially on the unpunished brutality
and wanton murders of Negro people. The door of his ofﬁce
is always open for any aggrieved citizen who needs a champion.

In two minutes you'd be calling the Chairman of the Com-
munist Party “Bill.” Heworked at every kind of trade from
the age of 14. He is the best labor organizer this country has

12

yet produced. William_Z. Foster laid the basis for the C.I.O.
in organizing the 60,000 meat packing workers of’Chicag0 in
1917 and 365,000 steel workers in 1919. As a direct result of
his efforts a substantial gain was made for the employees of
the ﬁve big packers—who won $6,000,000 in back pay alone.
The steel strike was the ﬁrst powerful blow at the main
open-shop fortress and ended the 12-hour day in that indus-
try. Foster was attacked then, before there was a Communist
Party, as “the chief red” who was using these strikes “to start
the revolution.” Born in Taunton, Mass., of Irish revolutionary
parents, Bill Foster became a Socialist as a youth of nineteen
in 1900. Once before, in 1922 in Michigan, he was charged
with “advocating force and violence” but the case collapsed.
The only jail sentence Foster has ever served was for.leading‘
the great New York demonstration of the unemployed, on
March 6 in 1930. This tremendous nation-wide movement

helped to elect President Roosevelt in 1932, and to inaugurate I

the “New Deal” which included the right to work, social
security, unemployed insurance, etc. William Z. Foster is

known by millions, who should now speak out on his behalf.

Eugene Dennis, born in Seattle, Wash. of Irish and Nor-
wegian parentage, also began ﬁghting for Socialism as a youth.
He worked in lumber camps, as a seaman, a teamster, an
electrician and at other outdoor jobs. He too was arrested on
March 6, 1930, leading the unemployed in Los Angeles, Cal.
As General Secretary of the Communist Party, Eugene Dennis
was the ﬁrst ,people’s leader to defy the fascist Un-American
Activities Committee, by refusing to recognize a body set up
to suppress the rights of the people, having as a member the
illegally elected Jim Crow John Rankin of Mississippi where
only 4 percent of the electorate are allowed to vote. 9

Gus Hall was a C.I.O. organizer during the drive to hold
the line in the bitter Little Steel Strike in 1937, while-]ohn
Williamson, as the Ohio state organizer of the Communist
Party, helped to build the C.I.O. in steel and rubber. They
are well remembered by workers there. On the same March
6, 1930, that Foster in New York and Dennis in California
were arrested, Jack Stachel, then Communist Party leader in
Michigan, led a demonstration of 100,000 unemployed work-
ers there. As trade union secretary‘ of the Party and a leader

of the Trade Union Unity League, he helped to lay the basis _

13

 

 

  

for many of the industrial unions which exist today. Irving
Potash is one of the best-loved leaders in the International
Fur and Leather Workers Union‘ of the C.I.O. who played
a large part in routing the Lepke-Gurrah gangsters in the fur
market in the 3o’s. In his youth he was a victim of thelvicious
Palmer anti-red raids and in 1940 was again sentenced to
prison for his union activities. His comment as he entered
the Federal Building at Foley Square to surrender himself
was: “These charges are ridiculous. They tried in 1920 and
failed. The workers won’t take this as a substitute for higher
wages and peace.” Carl Winter, who leads the Communist
Party of Michigan, also got his early training in the depression
days. His parents were Socialists, as were his wife’s parents-
friends -of Eugene V. Debs. He helped organize steel, as
Williamson’s assistant, in Ohio. He led the ﬁght in‘ Michigan
which gathered 1oo,ooo signatures against the Callahan Act,
thus invalidating this cheap local version.of the Mundt Bill.
Gil Green, now Party organizer in Illinois, was secretary of
the Young Communist League for many years. His graduates
took part in the C.I.O. organizing drive, fought fascism in
Spain, and furnished some of the best soldiers and officers in
the Second World War, many of whom died in action while
the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey kept its cartel agree-
ments with the Nazis six months a.fter war was declared. You
can see from even this brief resume of these twelve that four
are veterans of World War II; two are veterans of Spain; one
is a popular ﬁghting public oﬂicial; two are leaders of the
Negro people; four were front-line leaders in the struggle for
jobs for the unemployed during the depression; one is a
loved and respected labor oﬂicial; seven were active organizers
in the American labor movement. They are family men, with
at least twelve young children dependent upon them; one
with a son in college; one with grandchildren, and one whose
wife is expecting another baby soon. Nine of the defendants
are native-born. Three are foreign-bom, coming here at a
very early age. These three are also held under bail for de-
portation, on the same charge of “advocating force and vio-
lence." How many times "can people be arrested and punished

in different ways for the same charge? Their only “crime” is’

very clear. It is the same as‘ that of Jesus of Nazareth: "He
stirreth up the people.” Yes, these twelve men, over the past

14

  

several decades, have stirred up the American people~to ﬁght
for jobs, for unions, for democratic rights, against capitalist
exploitation. For this——that they care what happens to people
—should they be cruciﬁed?

By this time you are wonderi-ng, I’m sure, “What about all
those ‘foreign agents’ and ‘spy’ charges?” I'm not surprised
you ask. The New York Mirror, for instance, had a headline
on July 21st, “Indict Top Reds in 5-Year Probe of Spy Net-
work.” Well, there’s just nothing to it except atmosphere. It
is a smokescreen to create a lynch hysteria, which makes a
fair trial practically impossible. There are no charges of being
foreign agents or of spy activities in the indictment. Attorney
General Clark recently reminded Senator Ferguson of this in
a public letter. The unproven Hitler Big Lie is “Communist-
conspiracy—foreign—agent.” On this basis, Mr. Mundt -tried
to pass his police state bill here. Yet in every country in the
world, including our own, during the war, Communists were
“defenders of humanity”—as General MacArthur called the
Red Army. How can people be among the best ﬁghters for
their country and be “foreign agents” at the same time?
American Communists did not ship scrap iron to japan. They
picketed and protested against -it. American Communists did
not ship armsto Franco. T-hey fought hard for an embargo to
PREVENT it. American Communists did not do business
with the Krupps and I. G. Farben gangs of Germany as Wall
Street did before, during and since the war. In 1938, Standard

. Oil turned over its butyl rubber secrets to I. G. Farben of

Germany. Who is a foreign agent, we ask you?

American Communists supported President Roosevelt in his
advocacy of “quarantine the aggressor.”'As my good friend
Larry Mahan, Secretary of the Communist Party of New Jersey
and a veteran of World War II, said in a radio address over
Station WAAT in Newark, New Jersey, on May 17th: “There
are foreign agents‘ operating in our country today——foreign
agents of Chiang Kai-shek, begging for billions in Washington
to continue the hopeless war against the whole Chinese people.
And there are agents of all the fascists and quislings in Europe,
living on State Department bounty. And also the agents of
all the broken-down kings of Europe, whose people have
ﬁnally outgrown them as we did way back in 1776. Our coun-
try is crawling with foreign agents, and they're all eating out

15

 

  

of our withholding tax. Whenever a fascist or reactionary is
voted out of oﬂice in Europe (and this sometimes happens in
spite of Wall Street dollars and bankers’ bribes, in spite of
State Department threats of starvation), wherever such a char-
acter is turned out of office, he sails for America—sure of a
warm oﬂicial welcome, wide publicity and free food and
drinks. And they’re all whooping it up for a war which they
hope will bring them back their thrones and estates, and their
oil wells and their factories.” That's what Larry Mahan, who
worked as a radio technician for the Navy, installing and

 

repairing super—secret electronic devices to help lick the Nazis .

—'thinks about the “foreign agent” situation in the U.S.A.

During the American’ Civil War a Communist, Joseph
Wedemeyenirose to the rank of Colonel. He was a German
immigrant, a friend of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, who
wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1848. He had helped to
campaign for Lincoln and to form the ﬁrst Communistclub
in the U.S.A. in 1857. Its. vice-president, Fritz Jacobi, was
killed  the Civil War. Another friend of Marx and Engels,
Adolph Chiss, was an engineer at. the U. S. Navy Yard in
Washington, D. C. Were these early Communists “foreign
age_nts”?' ' .

‘Thomas Jefferson was called a Red Republican.—an agent
of the French Jacobins of the revolution of 1798; Abraham
Lincoln was called a Black Republican, an’ agent of the devil.
As a result of the hysteria at the time of the Palmer raids over
500 workers, non~citizens, were torn from their families and
deported, many to certain death; and 877 citizens were con-
victed under the fake Sedition Act o_f that date, without one
proved act of injury to the military services. Not a single spy
was ever ‘convicted under the act. Among those Americans
who suffered were Eugene V. Debs and‘ Kate Richards Q’Hara
of the Socialist Party, and'William D. Haywood and others
of the I.W.W. Socialist Congressman Victor Berger was ex-
cluded from his seat and New York Socialist Assemblymen
were likewise expelled. All this was before there was a Com-
munist Party. The "spy-plot—conspiracy-foreign-agent” ‘gag has
been ‘used over and over again to create frame-ups against
labor. One is ‘not a foreign agent to express: international
solidarity with workers aridbto have common issues“ for com-
mon well-being. The United Nations symbolizes the. fact that
' i6 -

  

nations should act together. The World Federation of Trade
Unions expresses the common interest of 75 million trade
unionists. On this subject, and it should dispose of this vapid
and vicious lie as far as Communists are concerned, Abraham
Lincoln said: “The strongest bond of human sympathy, out-

.side of the family relation, should be one uniting all work-

ing people of all nations, and tongues, and kindreds.” We
believe in such internationalism. _

Recently we held the 14th National Convention of the
Communist Party, U.S.A., from August 2nd to the 6th in
New York City. If the enemies of our Party expected that the
indictments of our leaders would demoralize us, they were
greatly disappointed. There were 165 regular delegates, with

many additional alternates and visitors—from North, West '

and South. Fraternal delegates from England, France and
Norway were barred by the State Department, although they
were all Communist members of their respective parliaments.
Our delegates were a cross sction of America—coal miners,
steel, textile, railroad, packinghouse, needle trades, electrical,
rubber, auto and varied shop workers, also maritime, hard ore
miners, farmers, students, teachers," housewives, writers, artists,
editors, union oﬂicials and others. We were of all national
origins—American, Indian, English, Irish, Scotch, Spanish,
Italian, Jewish, Porto Rican, Russian, Mexican, Greek, Ger-
man, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, Yugoslav, Czech, and others.
We were men and women, Negro and white, young and old,
veterans of World Wars I and II, veterans of Spain. One
delegate, Alice Burke, our Party organizer in Virginia, brought
her nursing baby. Speak about children and pictures were
forthwith passed around the tables by fond parents. Father
and daughter were fellow delegates in silvery-haired, ever

, youthful Alfred Wagenknecht and his daughter Helen Winter.

Husband and wife delegates were.Henie and Marie Huﬂ? from
Seattle, -and Moe and.May Miller from New York. Nick Migas,
hero of the rank-_and-ﬁle steel workers for his courageous stand
for a wage increase at their Boston convention, where he was
bea_t‘e_n up by  thugsifrorn Alabama, was a modest un-
assuming delegate. If you could see and‘ meet our delegates
youlwould find them people just like‘ you—ﬂesh and blood of
the American working class, identiﬁed with all its needs,
strugglés"" and aspirations. The nice“ old ladiies who are‘ per-
17

 

 

  

manent residents at the hotel where we met were quite im-
pressed at our quiet, orderly, sober and serious convention,
which disturbed them not in the least day or night. The
longest and most involved discussion I recall was on‘=the sub-
ject of “cyclical crisis,” or depression to us.

The deliberations of our convention have all been pub-
lished. The 1948 Election Platform of the Communist Party
has much in common with the election demands of all pro-
gressive people in these grave times. It points out: “The
dangers of war and fascism are exceedingly great. Only the
common people of America, and in the ﬁrst place the work-
ing class, can change our nation's course and save it from
disaster. The 1948 elections can help determine which way
America shall go. Your vigilance, your united action in this
election and in defense of -your rights, can strike a blow for
peace and freedom. The future of our country is in your
hands.”

We discussed in our convention and wrote into our plat-
form our views on War and Peace; The Attack on Labor and
Our Living Standards; Civil Rights; Negro Rights; The Two-
Party System and the New Party. We differentiate between
the Progressive Party and the Communists not on immediate
demands upon which there is little disgareement, but on
our ultimate goal of Socialism. This is clear to us. It is, I'm
sure, clear to Mr. Wallace and all intelligent progressives.
It is a difference that permits us to participate in an anti-
monopoly, anti-fascist, anti-war broad coalition party—the
Progressive Party—and not expect it to become Communist.
Only those who are trying to create disunity and confusion,
set‘ up a great hue and cry that Mr. Wallace and the Pro-
gressive Party as such are Communists. We know and say
they are not. We are not seeking any special favors in this
movement. Nor do we accept any disabilities because of our
Socialist views. Here is how our own Election Platform of
1948 expresses our ultimate goal:

“We Communists are dedicated to the proposition that
the great American dream of life, liberty ‘and the pursuit
of happiness, will be realized only under Socialism, a
system of society in which the major means of production
will be collectively owned and operated under a govern-
18

  

ment led by the working class. Only such a society can
forever banish war, poverty and race hatred. Only in such
a society can there be the full realization of the dignity
of men and the full development of the individual. Only
such a society can realize in life the vision of the brother-
hood of man.”

Well now, dear reader, you’ve had a streamlined view of
the Communists—our work and ideas. But will you feel that
your duty is done in just reading this pamphlet? Are all the
things I talked about here the private concern of Communists
only? Do they also affect you and_your children? I am sure
you will readily agree: “What happens to America is my
business, too. What happens to Americans is my concern, too.
It's my life and liberty, tool” Right you are. And it’s not a
private ﬁght either. Everybody can get into it. It's your ﬁght
as well as ours. A prominent Washington news letter to top
capitalists has this to say: “The indictment of the U. S. Com-
munists is not a political gesture. It has been planned for a
whole year. Government wants to make a start at corralling
them to limit their mischief, just in case of emergency. Gov-
ernment has 200,000 persons under surveillance, can pick
them up as a matter of safety.” If you are a militant trade
unionist, maybe you, too, are among the 200,000. If you are
opposed to another war, even 'before our dead are all brought
home, maybe you, too, are among the 200,000. If you oppose
the Marshall Plan to mortgage needy countries to Wall Street's
dictates, maybe you, too, are among the 200,000. If you are
opposed to the draft of your young sons, whose education,
family lives and futures are thus cruelly interrupted by war
preparations, maybe you, too, are among the 2002000.

It is a frame-up for war! It is a “red scare” to screen war

' plans! Thousands of Negro American leaders realize this as

“an attempt to strengthen the current drive to war and re-
action in general, by intimidating all political opposition to
such a program.” They have issued an appeal “The First Line
of Defense,” signed by W. E. B. DuBois, Roscoe C. Dunjee,
Charles P. Howard and Paul Robeson.

A giant petition of 10,000 signatures is under way in San
Francisco, signed by leading A.F.L and C._I:O. oﬂicials who
“see political persecution as a dangerous step toward fascism.”

THE TWELVE AND YOU

By ELIZABETH GURLEY FLYNN

. \ A RE you losing sleep? What's worrying you? Spies? Con-

spiracy? Force and violence? There are plenty of problems
pressing on the American family today, but they are not the
ones in the scare headlines. Top priority worry everywhere is
when do we eat——and what? The high cost of living-that's
what’s eating us! We don't need ﬁgures and percentages. We
know from our daily buying and our shrinking purses that
everything from soap to beefsteak has gone up. Milk, eggs,
butter, bread, sugar, meat—are all skyrocketing. Wages are cut
to the bone in their actual purchasing power.

Greedy food gamblers squeeze the farmer and the public.
Millions of pounds of meat are held in cold storage. Men in
high oﬂices secretly play the market and get rich on food
speculation. It is a shameful conspiracy against the health and
well-being of our growing children. Worryis the lot of the
average parents trying to feed our families. It harasses us
daily, and cheats us of sleep. The Beef Trust, the Milk Com-
bines, the stock brokers, the big commission merchants, all get
their share of the take—out of us. They never do a useful day’s
work but grab millions in profits. Bandits and pirates are
gentlemen compared to them; Are they in the headlines? Are
they indicted, arrested, pictured in the F.B.I. Rogues’ Gallery,
put under heavy bail, denied freedom of motion, and rushed
to trial for their actual criminal conspiracy to swindle and
starve the American family, for stealing food out of the Ameri-
can market basket and from the mouths of children? No, they
are not. Tom Clark, the U. S. Attorney General, has done
nothing to bring these thieves to justice. He was too busy
indicting Communists for “conspiracy,” with the aid of a
“blue ribbon” jury made up of the so-called “better class” of
our democratic society--no workers, no Negroes, of course.

Top national leaders of 18 Australian trade unions cabled
Secretary Trygve Lie of the United Nations, requesting inter-
vention in these arrests. ‘A similar message was sent by 15
Queensland labor leaders. Copies were sent to ,the Prime
Minister to forward to the Australian delegate to the U.N.
and to Philip Murray of the C.I.O. The Australian labor
leaders consider the arrests a violation of the U.N. provision
“observance of human rights and fundamental _freedoms.”
Secretary Healey of the Queensland Trades and Labor Coun-
cil said in his letter: “We are aware that the attacks on the
Communist Party in America are due to the policy being

pursued by that party against the war plans of the United

  

States government and that the Communist Party are en-
deavoring to organize the people of the United States for the
preservation of world peace.”

As I am writing the date for trial has been set on October
15th. This means about six weeks for the defense attorneys
to prepare to defend a case which the government worked on
for nearly two years. It is a political case of tremendous mag-
nitude. It involves the life of the Communist Party. It
threatens the liberty of twelve human beings. It involves
civil liberties and democracy in the U.S.A. It is the Mundt
Bill in a new form. Communists are naturally deeply con-
cerned..But the millions who fought the Mundt Bill, who
may not agree with us politically, do care what happens to
the Bill of Rights and "to their own liberties under it. October
15th is not an accidental date. The judge remarked that this

 

is just an ordinary criminal case to him. But this date is.

exactly two weeks and three days before Election Day, when
one of the hottest Presidential campaigns will be coming down
the home stretch. The issues of this trial will be bandied back
and forth in unparalleled unprincipled and demagogic fash-
ion, so characteristic of American campaigns. Red baiting will
reach new heights and an all-time low simultaneously. The
attorneys demanded, but topno avail, that this case must not
be made into a “political football.” It will be difficult to get
a fair trial under even the best conditions. But it will be im-
possible in this hectic pre—election atmosphere. Regardless of
the judge's remark, setting the trial date so close to Election
Day is an admission of the political nature of the case and is
prejudicialto the men on trial.

In addition to rushing to trial, the Federal District Attorney
refused to allow any of the nine defendants who reside in New
York City to travel elsewhere, to address meetings on their
own behalf, to raise funds for their defense and to take their
side of the case to the American people. But a telling victory
was gained when the defendants won the right to travel which
the government refused at ﬁrst, prejudging them guilty before
trial. Gus Hall, another defendant, has been conﬁned to Cleve-
land until the trial date. But Mr. A. H. Giannini, friend of
Mussolini, head of the Bank of America, who has been indicted
for violating the Anti-Trust Law and faces trial next October,
has been given full right to travel anywhere he wants to go.
Meanwhile the U. S. Treasury Department, out of the kindness
of its heart, has been quietly issuing licenses for new branches
of Giannini’s vast banking network, which according to the

‘ indictment, is an illegal enterprise. judge Medina said of the

Communist leaders: “If we let them do that sort of thing
[carry out their political work] they will destroy the govern-
ment.” Help the banker, prejudge the Communist—seems to
be the rule of the government.

- The papers outside of New York City tell very little about
this case and that unfavorably. The ABC network refused
William Z. Foster time to reply to a “documentary attack”
on the American Communists, on the ground that it was
“fair, factual—and complete.” The traditional American boast
of fair play, a square deal, is no more in evidence here than in
preparation for a lynching in the South. The deliberate
silencing of the accused, while everybody can fire away at
them with the wildest accusations, is creating a lynch atmos-
phere. An election lynching is being planned by the two old
parties——G.O.P. and Democrats. It is to wipe out, as the Aus-
tralians recognized, the most uncompromising opponents of
their bi-partisan plan for war and to serve warning on all
others, “Let that be a lesson to you, too!”

It challenges every Communist, trade unionist, every pro-
gressive and even conservative Americans who have respect
for decency. People abroad, who know by bitter experiences
where the Hitler Big Lie leads to—the prison, the concentra-
tion camps, the ﬁery furnaces—are more alert to the far-reach-
ing implications of such procedure than is the average Ameri-
can as yet. The authorities act as if they were afraid to allow

21

the Communist leaders to tour the country and tell the Ameri-
can people the truth. Let _us all protest vigorously to Attorney
General Tom Clark and to the Federal District Attorney in
New York City against these high-handed methods of depriv-

if ing people of a fair trial. Let us guarantee the necessary funds

for their defense.

The Civil Rights Congress has undertaken the responsibility
to raise a Defense Fund of at least $250,000. Labor and the
people generally need a strong ﬁghting defense organization
now and in the stormy days ahead. C.R.C. chapters should be
built in every city, to ﬁght for labor’s rights, the rights of_the
Negro people, for all political and civil rights of all minorities,
for the abolition of the Un-American Committee and the free-
dom of all its victims. George Dimitroff, the hero of the
Reichstag Fire Trial at Leipzig in 1933, when the Nazis set
the Parliament building aﬁre and blamed it on the Commu-
nists, said of American fascism—“in contradistinction to Ger-
man fascism, which acts under anti-constitutional slogans,
American fascism tries to portray itself as the custodian of
the Constitution and ‘American democracy.’ ”

The infamous Smith Act, passed in 1940 to cripple -the
unions and shackle them with a no-strike policy, is the instru-
ment today. But with your aid our twelve Communist leaders
can “press our indictment against the men of the trustsé
and make it stick," as Eugene Dennis declared at Madison
Square Garden. The Nazis bitterly rued the day they put
Dimitroff on trial. In defending the lives of himself and his
comrades, he put Nazism on trial. The President of the Court
interrupted him to say: “It is not your business to engage in
criticism here!” He defended the Bulgarian people against
the slurs in the Nazi press when he said: “The only savages
in Bulgaria are the fascists. But I ask you, Mr. Chairman, in
what country are the fascists not barbarians and savages?” He
challenged them, as our comrades will challenge their accusers,
that the Reichstag ﬁre (like the red menace here) was a
provocation for an excuse to abrogate freedom of organiza-
tion, freedom of the press, inviolability of the person and
home. Goering, most powerful next to Hitler, was rushed to
the defense of the Nazis, now on trial‘ before the world. After
an hour and a half of withering cross examination, he could
only shout in hysterical rage: “I did not come here in order

k 22

that you might question me like a judge, in order that you
might hurl reproaches at me. I am not afraid of you.” With
your aid our comrades will lay bare, in similar fashion, the
tissue of lies built up to condemn our Party here; to serve as
a similar provocation for the same excuse to suppress the
rights of the people as the Reichstag Fire Trial.

Whether you agree with the Communist Party or not, I am
sure you want to help the Civil Rights Congress in its efforts

to provide an adequate legal defense for the 12 Communist

leaders and to give publicity to that defense, through radio
programs, literature, leaﬂets, mass meetings, etc. Therefore
I appeal to you to send a substantial contribution to the
Defense Fund and bring this appeal to all your friends and
any organization you may belong to, as well. Secondly, please
send for copies of the Dennis speech at Madison Square Gar-
den, the 1948 Election Platform of the Communist Party and
other literature, to 35 East 12th Street, New York 3, N. Y.
Thirdly, vote on Election Day to put in office men and women
who stand for peace, full democracy, and the rights of labor.
Help smash the frame-up system! Help bring to justice the real
conspirators against the life, liberty and happiness of the
American people—the men of the trusts! Help bring to justice
the real perpetrators of force and violence against the people
—the men of the trusts! Help bring to justice the real co-
operators with foreign Nazi groups to,the detriment of our
country’s interests—the men of the trusts! Help free the
champions of labor and the people!

Edmund L. Cocks, foreman of this Grand Jury, is a banker.
He is now exposed as ﬁguring in a conspiracy as Vice—President
of the Greenwich Savings Bank. The Federal Government
charged this bank and 27 others with combining to restrict
‘loans to housing projects for Negroes and Porto Ricans. This
illegal combination practically pleaded guilty last June and
promised‘ not to conspire further. They were not punished.
The complaint against the group was signed by U. S. Attorney
Francis K. McGohey. The Daily Worker had vigorously de-
manded their punishment. How does such a character head up
a Grand jury and have the opportunity to strike "back at John
Gates, Editor of the Daily Worker, and Benjamin J. Davis, _]r.,
President of its publishing company? It’s a question for our
Government to answer.

Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool all of the people some
of the time"—but not forever. Is it the fault of the Communists
that you can’t put a roast of beef on the 'table for your Sunday
dinner? What have the Communists to do with the high cost
of living? This much, dear reader, that we Communists have

‘fought it tooth and nail. We have exposed those who are

responsible, have helped to organize protests, demonstrations,
picket lines and lobbies against it. We are workers and farm-
ers, we are housewives who go forth daily to battle for a square
meal on our table. We are the same kind of people you are,
and when we ﬁght for your interests we ﬁght for our own. The
twelve arrested Communist leaders do not deprive people of
milk and meat. They are charged with a trumped-up "con-
spiracy” to draw your attention away from the real criminal
conspiracies against the welfare, safety and rights of the people,
fostered by capitalism.

Are you a capitalist? Do you live without work on the labor
of others? Do you collect dividends,. clip coupons, draw proﬁts?
Do you winter in Palm Beach and summer in Switzerland?
Are you one of the lucky sixty families who hit the jackpot in
our free enterprise system and now own America? Do you revel
in year—round luxury even to the third and fourth idle genera-
tions? To ﬁght the evils of capitalism is plain treason to such
birds of prey. Probably you’re saying, “Who? Me? Lady, you've
got me wrong. I work for a living.” So you won't have a stroke
if you keep on reading. We Communists consider you, the
American people, the real jury. We present to you a counter

3

indictment against the men of the trusts. They are the menace
to the well-being of our country. They accuse us to cover their
crimes.

Did you read a report, tucked away in an obscure corner
of the papers, where the Federal Reserve Board says that 28%
of U. S. families have spent all their wartime savings and that
over 13,500,000 families are today going deeper and deeper
into debt, spending more than they earn? Did the 12 Commu-
nists leaders put all these Americans “in the red”? No, in fact
the Communists are among these families. We are all “in
the red” together. This is far more important news than

‘ screaming headlines about fake spy scares. So is another story,

hidden away in the press. It is now eleven years since President
Roosevelt spoke of “one-third of a nation ill-housed.” The
latest U. S. Census statistics show itis still true. At least
48 million people or more than one-third of our nation today
are ill-housed. Six million families live in wretched city slum
areas; fourteen million live in city and farm dwellings that
are sub—standard. These are government ﬁgures. Communists
do not cheat people out of decent homes, nor force ten to
eleven million Americans, many of them World War II vet-

erans, to live “doubled up.” Is it the fault of the Communists ~

that you can’t have a new house or apartment or must live
with in-laws? Did the 12 Communist leaders conspire to
monopolize land, raise rents, refuse repairs, prevent low-cost
housing, corner building materials? What have the Commu-
nists to do with bad housing? This much, dear reader, that
we Communists have fought everywhere throughout America

for adequate low-cost housing for all-—regardless of creed, color _

or national origin. We too live in crowded places. We too are
veterans and their families who would like to live alone, and
who have a right to expect better after we fought a war against
fascism. The same proﬁteers who piled up huge fortunes dur-
ing the war have conspired since to cheat our third of a nation
out of decent dwellings. They .prefer to produce a stodcpile
of war materials while they whoop it up for another war. The
real estate combines, the big landlords, the construction com-
panies, the politicians, have conspired to defeat all proposals
for widespread adequate low-cost housing. Are they indicted,
arrested, pictured in the F.B.I. Rogues’ Gallery, denied free-
dom of motion, and rushed to trial for robbing American

4

families of a roof over their heads? No, they are not. Tom
Clark, the U. S. Attorney, has done‘ nothing to bring these
thieves to justice. He was ‘too busy indicting a political party
in an election year, depriving the Communists of their con-
stitutional rights to speak to you on election issues. V
Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool some of the people all
of the time”——but not forever. Are you among these “some”?

_I hope not. Ask yourself afew questions. Are you going to

get low prices by putting some guys in jail? Who——the food
proﬁteers or the Communists? Are you going to get a house
by putting some guys in jail? Who—the real estate proﬁteers
or the Communists? Where does all the red-baiting come from?
Who pulls out the old red herring every time‘ you ask fora
raise in pay? The Steel Trust and other big bosses shout:
“Tools of the Communists!” You want a sirloin steak or a
couple of lamb chops? The Beef Trust bellows, “Dupes of the
Communists!” You want a house with a bathroom? “Commu-
nist agents!” roar the Real Estate interests. When will you
get wise to all this ballyhoo? Communists are being constantly
abused in a stream of downright lies and slander, in the press
and over the radio. But consider the sources from which this
attack comes——Wall Street, Big Business, National Manufac-
turers Association, Chambers of Commerce, anti-New Deal
Democrats and Republicans. White supremacists in the South,
Ku Klux Klan, the notoriety—seeking Un-American Committee,
and even some. labor misleaders who don’t want .to stand up
and ﬁght but prefer the soft seats of appeasers of capitalism.
Is it just an accident that “red scares” and “spy plots” are
headlines, but food and shelter are not? Do you notice‘there
is a pattern to it? Prices go up, rents are upped, and we get
another red scare. Workers ask for a raise; the Progressive
Party holds a successful convention, and we get more red
scares. Everybody gets a chance to discuss the Communists-
except the Communists. Is this free speech? Is t-his the atmos-
phere for a fair trial? It creates a lynch atmosphere. How
about your union, club, fraternal society, church, asking a
Communist, not an anti-Communist, to speak on “What is the
Communist Party? What*does it do? Who belongs to it? What
does it stand for in the 1948 elections? What are its ultimate
purposes?” Who is better qualiﬁed to speak with authority
than the Communists themselves?

But in spite of all the present handicaps we have faith in
the ultimate justice of the American people, when the fog of

the present hysteria rolls away. Abraham Lincoln said: “You
can't fool all the people all of the time!” History has proved
that. We are willing to rest our case with our fellow Americans,
after they know the facts. History vindicated those who fought
and died for freedom of religion and science, for democratic

«rights against feudalism, and human slavery. Pioneers who

fought for women’s suffrage, free public schools, labor unions,
had a rough time. But they are honored today. The ﬁrst unions
‘in our country were charged with “conspiracy to injure trade

A _ and commerce.” They're still trying it in the Taft-Hartley

Slave Law over a century later. On Monday, June 6, 1836,
twenty-seven thousand people gathered in City Hall Park to
protest the sentencing of twenty New York tailors. “If this be
the law,” said John Greenleaf Whittier, renowned Quaker poet,
“It is unjust, oppressive and wicked.” “If this is not slavery,”
said William Cullen Bryant, poet and editor, “we have for-
gotten its deﬁnition.” They had experienced the repression of
the Allen, Sedition and Naturalization Laws, when many were
deported, persecuted and prosecuted. It was the Mundt Bill
of that day and was sent to its well-deserved grave when Jeffer-
son was elected, in 1800. Are we Americans of 1948 less con-
scious of our rights than were these ﬁghting offspring of revo-
lutionary fathers? _
“0verthrowing the government” has ever been the charge
hurled by the “rich and well-born” who agreed with John
Jay, first Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court when he
said: “Those who own the country ought to govern it.” To this
day this privileged class dare identify themselves with democ-
racy and consider that any attack upon their special system of
private ownership of our country's resources and industries is
a threat to government and to the American way of life. This
employing class dares to speak of “force and violence.” It would
be a farce if it were not so tragic. In the twenty-nine years of the
Communist Party's existence not a single act or advocacy of

force and violence has been proven against our party. In the _

case of our comrade, Schne-iderman, before the U.S. Supreme
Court in June, 1943, the issue was one of citizenship. Never-
theless the Court, after examining the practices and doctrines
of the Communist Party, remarked as follows: “A tenable

    

 
 

conclusion from the foregoing is that the party in 1927” [when
Schneiderman was naturalized——E.G.F.] “desired to achieve its
purpose by peaceful and democratic means, and as a theoretical
matter justiﬁed the use of force and violence only as-a method
of preventing an attempted forcible counter overthrow once
the Party had obtained control in a peaceful manner; or as
a method of last resort to enforce the majority will if at some
indeﬁnite time in the future, because of peculiar circumstances,
constitutional or peaceful channels were no longer open.”
Are there such cases? Yes, when the Southern slave-owners
refused to accept the election of Abraham Lincoln and took
up arms against the government. A similar recent case was the
fascist Franco’s' overthrow of the Spanish government. The
Communist Party constitution states clearly: “Adherence to or
participation in the activities of any clique, group, circle, fac-
tion or party which conspires or acts to subvert, undermine,
weaken or overthrow any or all institutions of American de-
mocracy, whereby the majority of the American people can
maintain their right to determine their destiny in any degree,
shall be punished by immediate expulsion.” The long range

' program of the Communist Party, the abolition of capitalism

and the establishment of Socialism, is possible when the major-
ity of the American people agree, by amending the Constitu-
tion of the U.S.A.', just as slavery was abolished by the Thir-
teenth Amendment and the slaves declared citizens of the U.S.
by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments (which the
Dixiecrats want to abolish). Any force and violence will be
on the part of the minority capitalist class against the will
of the people, as by the slave owners during the Civil War.
As Eugene Dennis pointed out in his magniﬁcent Madi-
-son Square Garden speech on August 2nd, the only blood
shed by American Communists was in ﬁghting fascists in Spain
and on every battle front of World War II. But the long
:and cruel record of capitalism in shedding the blood of
American workers can be proven by thousands of widows and
-orphans. In over forty years in which I have been active in
the American labor movement I can recall many such killings.

In 1911, there was the Triangle Fire, when 129 young girls
‘burned to death after the boss locked the doors against union
organizers. In 1912, Anna LaPizza was shot by a police-
:man and john Rami stabbed a guard, in the Lawrence,

7

  

Mass, textile strike. In 1913, two workers, Madonna and
Modestino, were shot by deputies in the Paterson, N. J., silk
strike, and the same year in Calumet, Mich., a group of strik~
ers’ children were smothered to death at a Christmas party,
when a thug yelled “ﬁre.”'In 1914, thirty-four men, women
and children were massacred when the strikers’ tent colony
was set aﬁre in Ludlow, Colo., and organizer Louis Tikas was
shot down trying to save them. In 1916 John Alar, a striker,
was killed on the Mesabi Iron Range in Minn. and ﬁve I.W.W..
members, Rabinowitz, Johnson, Baran, Looney and Gerlot,
were shot down at Everett, Wash., in a free speech ﬁgh-t. In

‘ 1917, a striker was killed in Bisbee, Arizona, and Frank Little,

I.W.W. organizer, was lynched in Butte, Mont. In 1919,
twenty-one steel strikers were killed in the big strike and Mrs.
Fanny Scllins, union organizer, was brutally murdered _by
deputies at Natrona, Pa. The same year Wesley Everest, World
War I veteran, was lynched by Legionnaires at Centralia,
Wash., following their raid on the I.W.W. hall. In 1925, Mike

‘ Saravich was killed by a Klansman in the Zeigler, Ill., union

   
 

hall. In 1919, Anna May Wiggins, textile striker, mother of
ﬁve children, was shot by deputies at Gastonia, N. C. In the
20's Sid Hatﬁeld and Ed Chambers of the U.M.W.A., were
shot to death as they walked unarmed up the courthouse steps
to trial. In 1931, Harry Simms, young Negro Communist
organizer, was killed in~Harlan County, Ky. In 1932, bonus
marchers William Hushka and Eric Carlson"were killed in
Washington, D.C., and "four ‘unemployed workers, ‘Cole-‘man
Leny, Joe de Blasio, ]oe Russell and Joe York, the latter two
Communists, were killed at Dearborn, Mich., by Ford Plant.
guards. In 1934, Nicholas Bordois‘, Communist," and Howard
Sperry, were killed inthe San Francisco general’ strike. In 1935,
Ioseph Shoemaker and Frank Norman were beaten to death
in Tampa, F 1a., by the K.K.K. In 1936, ten pickets were killed
by the police in the Memorial Day massacre of South Chicago,

 

111. These are some I remember. There were many more. But ‘

I do not remember a single case where the murderers were
punished—not one. Where was Tom Clark and his predecessors
when these hideous crimes were committed against workers
who had fought only for more bread? v

Five thousand,Negro Americans have been lynched since
1882 in this country, and no one was ever punished, according

to the Appeal to the United Nations submitted by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A'.A.
C.P.). Where was Tom Clark when two Negroes were mur-
dered by police oﬂicers in Columbia, Tenn.; the Ferguson
brothers murdered by police in Freeport, L. 1., and Marcie
Snipe, a veteran in Georgia, murdered by a mob? Snipe’s
“crime” was to register; William Milton was murdered by a
policeman on July 15 of this year in Brooklyn, N. Y. Is it the
Communists who are responsible for these tragic deaths which
disgrace America before the whole world?

What about the murder by cops of a . 15-year old Negro
youth,_ Leon Mosley, in Detroit? What happened to James
Harmon of Trenton, N. J., a Negro worker who went out for
a cup of coffee and died weeks later, all smashed up and unable
to tell what happened to him? Where was the F.B.I. when
these horrors happened? Too busy indicting the Communists,
who ﬁght for the rights of the Negro people. While the F.B.I.
were arresting the 12 Communist leaders, the Ku Klux Klan
was meeting in Konklave in Stony Mt., Georgia, plotting to

‘ deprive Negro Americans in the South of their right to vote-

by force and violence. V/Vere there any Communists. among
them? _ h

This oppressive capitalist system, which the Communists
charge with force and violence, was, guilty. of the deaths of
17,090 workers in preventable industrial accidents in 1947.
There were 1,165 coal miners killed underground and 63,000
injured. The most terrible accident was at Centr_alia, Ill.,
where 111 miners died, due to wilful negligence by the.com-
pany and the state. The doomed miners had warned the
governor of Illinois of the dangerous state of the mine. Did any
one go to jail for these crimes? Not one. The 80th Congress,
which passed the Taft-Hartley Slave Law "to shackle the miners,
failed to pass an Amended Federal Safety Code to prevent
such catastrophes. They failed to pass an anti—lynch.law. .

A Are th_eCommunists responsible for this appalling waste of
human life? Do they own themines and factories, hire guards,
ignore safety regulations and. make widows, orphans and
cripples? The hands of the rich are stained with blood. They
are guilty of murder underground, on the picketline, inthe
darkness of the night. Are‘ those who readily adv0eate...,and cqjn
be proven by thousands of overt acts to use force and violence
