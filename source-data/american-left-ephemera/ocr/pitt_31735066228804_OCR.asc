The expulsion of the I.‘ W. W, in 11912 soon cost the Party

an important minority of its 125,000 members, but new circum-
stances were nevertheless to result in a victory for its left wing.
The Party lost most of its intellectuals to the pro-war cause, but
its intransigent position against the war———until 1917 there was
nothing unique about its neut-ralism—-attracted, vast electoral sup-
port. In the 1917 municipal elections it increased its percentage
of total votes received from three to eight times by campaigning
on an anti-war platform, its vote being considerably. gre_ater in
areas with large Yankee populations. Indeed, by 1919 the Party’s
membership was almost restored to its 1912 -peak, but the “com-
plexion of that 7membership had radically altered, "Thirteen per-
cent of the Party belonged to foreign language ‘sections in 1912,
53 percentin 1919. The Socialist Party had movedto the left for
the first time, had become a party of immigrants, and was making
significant electoral gains.

Although internecine disputes have wracked the Socialist Party
since 1919 and would have destroyed it in any ca-se, it is worth
noting that at the very moment Amen on

of the Party were jailed, newspapers were denied mailing privileges

and otherm'se harassed, and in many localities the club, lock and ‘

prison ended Party activity. If" the Government used war and
patriotism as justification, it -should be recalled that leading prog-
ressives, with rare exceptions, also supported the Red Scare and
repressive laws for reasons always implicit in pre-war progressive
ideologies. Progressives wished to integrate the labor and im-
migrant community into an ordered, homogeneous society, and

"do:sQ. Roosevelt had never equivocated on the use of force against
dissident labor, and consistently endorsed majorinfractions of the _

civil liberties of unions and their leaders. Progressivism to men
such as Roosevelt was designed, among other things, to head off
the threat of socialism by reforming capitalism. The United States
Steel Corporati-on, accepted by Roosevelt as_a model of enlightened
business, could introduce both wel_fare__ measures and Pinkertons

_' when needed. In brief, if labor could’ not be-voluntarily integrated

into thesocial order by goodworks, it was to be tailored to size
by chopping ‘off its unmanageable left by any means appropriate to
the task, including" suppression. Only when one takes this equa-
tion into account can we comprehend the near unanimity of pre-
war reformers in favor of Wilson’-s Red Scare and the Espionage
and Sedition Acts. '

In a sense the failure of American radicalism was due, at, least
between 1917 and 1920, to the failure’ of American politics to
operate according to the conventionally accepted but rarely prac-
ticed ideal theories of democratic political processes. American
Socialism was unable to appreciate the limitations this breakdown
might have for their own concept of change, a view that remained
static until it was too late, To the extent the true ‘character and
the efficacy of a political structure is revealed only under the test
of pressure and crisis, it can be suggested that Socialists shared a
generally-held sublime innocence concerning the resilience of Amer-
ican democracy during crises. For Socialists this naiveté was deci-
sive, since their stake in the validity of existing mechanisms of
change was vital—for others, thefixity of the political machine
merely reinforced their interests in- the status quo.

Looking at American society and politics before the First
World War the Socialists could see a class structure as an objec-
tive fact, and sufficient tumult and noise within it to impute to it
a seemingly dynamic aspect. Such dynamics could be measured,
and if amplified held out hope of vindicating the socialist theory
of change. Classes, strata and competing interests were recognized
by Marx, though he neither created them nor was he the first to
discover their existence. Since politics was based ultimately on
conflict, the class context of such-conflict might lead to decisive

social change. Yet one other possibility existed which socialists

refused to consider, but which Thorstein Veblen had proposed
before the war. American‘society could also be understood as a
class structure without decisive class -conflict, a society that had
conflict limited to smaller issues that were not crucial to the exist-

ingv order," and on which the price of satisfying opposition was
relatively modest‘-from the viewpoint of V the continuation of _ the
social system.-' In brief, a static class structure. serving. class , ends
might‘ be frozen into American’ society even if the interests and
values served were those of .a ruling class. A sufficiently monolithic
consensus might voluntarily exist on the fundamental questions
indispensable to the continuation of the existing political and eco-
nomic ‘elites, and their primary interest would be respected_in the
last analysis; The functionally dominant conception. of interests,
the prime values of the society, did not have to be essentially
classless, as Louis Hartz and recent theorists of consensus have
argued, but merely accepted by those segments of society without
an objective stake in the constituted order. This, I believe, was
the point that Veblen was making, not in order to rationalize the
dominance of business in American life but to explain the extent
of its obvious spiritual and material pervasiveness.

The best argument for suchan interpretation is ‘the fact that
at no time in American -history in this century has the labor
movement or the dispossessed translated their struggles for specific
demands into a larger demand for fundamental change. The
mythology of American society as one that welcomes opportunity
and equality for all—as if a’ vaguely defined rhetoric is more
realistic than a frank appreciation of the functionally inegalitarian
and class nature of America—extends not only to labor, but even
to civil rights activists who seek entry of the Negro into a society
that is inherently stratified and class-oriented in decisive ways
having nothing to do with race. And if everyone does not share
this consensus consciously, and indeed even if the majority neither
agrees nor disagrees but is apathetic on such matters, the least that
can be said i-s that no one has been able to redirect such apathy
toward a meaningful alternative; Indeed, even the apathetic usual-
ly permit the consensual ideology of American life to be defined
for them during times of crisis and pressure, and they accept erst-
while national goals which are in fact class goals and interests.
The apathy itself proves less than the fact that conscious devia-
tions from manipulated consensual values have been roughly dis-
paraged in this century as “Hunism,” “pacifism,” “bolshevism,”

or what have you, suggesting that although voluntary most of the
time, the power of legal authority has also reinforced and defined
consensus to save society from dangers the possibility of functional
democracy posed to the existing order.

The failure of the Socialist Party, therefore, also reflected the
consensual and voluntarily accepted total domination of American

and well before the New Deal " reforms allegedly stole its'thunder
and presumably impinged -on its basic demands, the Sociahst Party
was quite dead. It existed, of course, but never as a serious factor
in shaping American politics or labor unionism toward some
socially meaningful new departure What it called “life” was a
factional precociousness that sharpened the polemical talents of its
brighter young followers, talents many were later to employ to
their own advantage as key spokesmen for anti-"communism after
the Second World War.

The leaders of the Socialist Party during the 1920’s fell into
quieter, bureaucratic ways, managing their existing institutions,
building‘ their private careers and maintaining a doctrinal purity
which was by this" time well to the left of that prevalent in the
pre-war party. The Communists, despite their anti-parliamentarian
rhetoric, ran their first Presidential candidate in 1924, and differed
only slightly from the Socialist -Party in their functional political
premises. The Communist Party too‘ was primarily a party of
recent immigrants, and during the 1920’s its amoebic internal life
kept-it preoccupied with Trotskyists and Lovestonites. Though it
created its own organizational forms for the purpose, it duplicated
the union and other activities of the Socialists. In brief, just_'_as
Social Democracy was bolshevized into bureaucratic channels ‘be-
fore the war, Bolshevi-sm was-being social democratized toward

parliamentarian and unionist directions after‘ 1924-“in a way hardly

designed to create a new order where others hacl".failed.

The divisions in the Socialist Party‘ after 1933 do not" war-
rant much consideration. Factors having to do with age, politics
or psychology kept the Party in factional turbulance to the extent

‘that from 22,000 members in 1934 it dropped to 7,000 in 1938

and 2,000 in 1941, and has notexceeded the lastefigure since that
time. During the 1930’s the majority of the S-ociali-st Party’s mem-
bers were foreign-born or first generation, and this pattern of

' immigrant domination was even more widespread in the Com-
munist Party. In this context both '3 parties became a kind of

fraternal center——.the majority of the literature of the Socialist
Party was 11ot in English——fora'\'=lonely migrants who might raise
funds at banquets for the ~Sco‘ttsboro boys but were -essentially

It may perhaps be suggested that in ‘fact the institutional and

well financed and thoroughly debilitating concern which has been
both a cause and reflection of the demise of the American left.
In its worst aspect it suggested that the Communist Party was an
important experience in post-World War I American history, just
as paranoid McCarthyites had .suggested. At best it was a dialogue
with McCarthyism on terms and issues defined. by that movement,
critical only insofar as it applied higher canons. of evidence. This
concern engaged an articulate sector of the non-Communist Party
left that implicitly regarded a discourse on an unimportant and
impotent party as a more serious undertaking than a confronta-
tion of basic social andpolitical questions. Indeed, the issue of the
Communist Party gave the left an excuse to postpone and ulti-
mately avoid dealing with the much more significant-and difficult
issues facing it in an age of nuclear‘ terror.

It was not -unexpected that the non-communist left might
fo_c.us~s_o closely on the Communist Party, since anti-communism
had become a categorical imperative of American life, and a way
for the left to integrate itself with thelarger assumptions of their
society and perhaps make itself more plausible. Succumbing to the
mood of the times, even while proclaiming a higher if not clearly
defined morality, theAmerican left gradually took over even more
of the crucial assumptions of conventional politics, aligning itself
with the more liberahwingspof the Cold War in the hope, quite
as chimerical, that it would succeed with the liberals in a way.it
had not been able to do with the workers. Turning an astringent
eye on the faults of the bolsheviks, the post-war left could not
recognize its own, much less see that their moral defects were very
much in the same category as those it attributed to the bolsheviks.
Both had lost critical perspective toward their favorite side, neither
had anything new to say in regard to the American scene and
its mechanics of change. 'I:he Eastern European situation was
described by the socialists in the blackest detail, but little was
said, for example, about the actions of French socialist ministers
who in Indo-China, "Madagascar and Algeria committed horrors
on behalf of an old order. thatpaled those of bolsheviks groping
their way against resistance_,toward new societies. The moral
distinctions that were _,evoked__ o1:i_ behalf of anti-communi-sm were
obscured when it was necessary‘ to give ‘critical support to the
West.. _ ‘ _ ’

Such policies were a ‘logical concomitant of social democratic
biases, but not entirely conscious. With the -exception of those who

gave up socialism for sociology and a ‘technical precociousness‘

which produced formal‘ structural theories with less historical relev-

ance than even hobbled socialist theses, American socialism of the
non-Communist variety was characterized by a pervasive dilettant-
ism. Crucial political judgments were made on the basis of the
most casual information, and a precise focus on the institutional
operation of society, politics ‘and foreign relations was just as
‘lacking as before ‘thewar. Socialism as an intellectual system be-
came, for the most part, impressionist and literary, which added

‘a sensitivity to subtle problems in only;_a_ few; a_reas.,,Ali_enation and

mass culture—the former had. been a’ familiar’ complaint of radicals
for decades—were deemed worthy of closer inquiry‘ than .econor'n-

ics or diplomacy. The "post-"war left preferred -taking its ‘insights

from ‘political novelists "who, for all their. A perception,5 saw the
world through a looking glass that obscured iinportant distinc-
tions that could be defined’ only. by viewing society directly. A
mediocre novelist such aiGeorg'e Orwell‘ was far ‘more inﬂuential
than considerably more intelligent social scientists, and his success
was based on the political favor with which his views were ‘held.
Once, socialists regarded totalitarianism, much less bolshevism,

as a cause of the world jcrisis, rather than" as the effect’ of the

collapse of liberalism and Western politics, it was possible for
socialists to enlist, with reservations that did not change their
basic commitment, _in the cause of the “Free World.” The results
were catastrophic. Americanradicals soon‘ found themselves cutting
the edge of their criticism and explicitly acknowledging the com-
munity of interests and assumptions with American politics and
society that had ‘always been implicit. ‘In this position they were
at a premium, their talents and books overpraised as they titillated
a jaded and casual upper middle-class, professional audience. A
few might sincerely maintain a semblance of critical integrity by
dissecting marginal aspects of American life and politics, aspects
that if altered would leave the larger society intact, but by 1952
no important neutralist or third-camp foreign policy position could
be found among articulate radicals. And what was never willingly
tolerated, above all, was a hard, dispassionate, uncommitted look
at the competing worlds, their attainments as well as their short-
comings, much less a searching. View of the foundations of Amer-
ican society "and its" purposes"-and historic role in the post-1945
crisis. Stronger claimants to intellectual and literary importance
who failed to accept these premises were isolated or ignored by
upper bohemia and the intellectual -set connected with universities
and the “cultural media.” Only the subterranean world of. the

without ever being acknowledged in the country he resided in the
last‘ 25 ‘years of_ his life; the anti-communist left read but also
reviled C. Wright "Mills. The post-war generation recognized the
need for new ideas, and the call’ for the application of intelligence

became a static posture, but little more. Intelligence was rarely .

applied to specific American issues in a way that increased knowl-
edge, and studies of communism failed to alter this deficiency.
In the name of humanism, socialists in the United States
gradually but firmly aligned themselves with the American cause
in the deepest political and cultural sense—-Castro, the Vietminh
and the victims of the post-war world crisis became first as guilty
as their‘ potential executioners, as culpable morally, and then
deserted in a manner that increasingly absolved the executioners.
The impact of the Western resistance against. revolutionary move-
rnents, ‘especially in Eastern ' Europe and China, was rarely con-
sidered in» evaluating the social '-systems" that ‘emerged; Again- vic-

.tims were condemned for their responses to: the crimes of” their

executioners, as if the Cubans, Vietnamese and Chinese had chosen
with deliberate ‘malice to violate a humanist tradition» they too
evoked and ‘claimed to act upon. The power of the old orders

"to shape the form of the new systems, and what was transitional

or "permanent, defensive, or deliberate in the synthesis was never

considered. Econornic development as a justification of their _ac- *

tion was dismissed as narrow economism, as if economic develop-
ment were "worth nothing, The losses involved in" sucha process
were carefully examined, but neverweighed and balanced against
the gains, particularly in those _areas that had precious little intel-
lectual freedom or political democracy to lose. Growth rates and
their distribution struck many as meaningless, and for litterateurs
as uninteresting. That the difference between bolshevik totalitarian-
ism with bread, and capitalist totalitarianism without bread, is the
elimination of_ hunger, filth and death was gainsaid. That a dyna-
mic society that ends starvation is freer in a crucial sense, and
saves far more life than it may -willingly or unwillingly destroy,
is a point that was never con‘fronted,'even.-when politically mean-
ingful options to the status quo or controlled planned economies
did not exist. A ~ - ' "

rupture between the non-communist American left and the social
order to which it had accomodated itself. To re-examine the poli-
tical context of socialism closely might have meant a new and
sympathetic alignment with forces throughout the world that have
rejected the hegemony of American leadership, and it would have

meant a return to isolation and discomfort. By the end of the
l950’s the left which emerged from the Socialist Party tradition
of the 1930’s was incapable of making this adjustment. For Q0
years the American left, because of ideological roots and optimistic
belief in the efficacy of transforming the existing order, had been
grounded in the acceptable myths- and premises of the existing
order. In the context of the world conflict, to refuse to align itself
with the United States would have been equivalent to breaking
the illusion of being political men with a political future. To
assume otherwise would have been to take the unenviable and
pessimistic position that radicalism, given the social and political
realities of America, had moved beyond politics not because it
had no political ideas but because it finally acknowledged it had
no political means. The left would have been beyond politics not
because politics is unimportant, but because the control and exer-
cise of power is nominally democratic but in reality voluntarily
totalitarian. To refuse to support the American cause would have
shattered the last illusions concerning the nation’s ability to tolerate
dissent which does not choose to mark out areas of agreement on
fundamental assumptions.

The failure of the left by the end of the 1950’s did not
eliminate the need for a left, nor did their forced optimism alter
the graver realities which underlay American domestic affairs and
foreign policy. That a “new left” should have emerged was both
predictable and logical, and that it should have all-too-many of
the characteristics of the older left should not be surprising. Its
factionalism is debilitating, and its view of the Negro and poor is

not unlike that of the old leftists or Wobblies who cultivated il-

lusions concerning mass industry or ‘migrant workers. There is no_

serious awareness that rnodestigains for the Negro and A_ poor may

change, impossible. A_ society that is poisoned produces poisoned

_ The new left has had the political courage to challenge the

THE DECLINE OF AMERICAN RADICALISM
IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

Gabriel Kolko

EXISTING THEORIES on the failure of American socialism in
the 20th century provide ample opportunity for American society
to indulge in self-congratulation, and this perhaps explains why no
one has defined a truly satisfactory view of the problem. The ab-
sorption of third party platforms" by major parties, the economic
prosperity of a society that met the economic grievances that led
to the formation of socialist parties‘ in other nations, the con-
sensual, Lockean basis of an American liberalism which was broad
enough to accept the demands of the left, the religious and racial
conservatism of the American workers, social mobility, or limited
trade union job consciousness———all these generally accepted inter-
pretations have permitted a narrower view than is justified of the
nature of the historical context in which American radicalism
failed.- If each has some merit, their collective thesis by-passes a
somewhat less attractive possibility that American socialism failed

_ partly because of its own internal life and ideology, but primarily
‘because in crucial respects American society and politics in the
20th century have also failed in a world wracked by war and

repression. Indeed, given the cataclysmic nature of a great part of
the century, tepid views of the demise of socialism avoid the tenor
of the period by ignoring the relationship of the failure of organ-

paralysis of the left in the face of reaction before World War I

in an elucidating manner to social reality. After the demise of
Austrian socialism and Rosa Luxemburg it may be argued that,
on the level of social and economic analysis, Marxists produced
remarkably little of value, and hence Marxism’s function as an
ideology and exaltation of social change was hopelessly limited
for the tasks at hand. And since‘ the Western left in general was
theoretically impoverished, it should come as no surprise that the
American left was not much below the intellectual par of the
international movement. There is nothing “exceptionalist” about
the fact that not one important or original socialist theoretician
emerged _in the entire history of American socialism—at best it
produced charismatic figures or men of rare degrees of integrity
admired for their constancy and dedication. Although American
socialism on an organizational level was infinitely weaker than
European socialism, what is important is that Western European
social -democracy and bolshevism could ‘never translate mass. poli-

tical movements into political success—in the form of a substan-

tially new social order—and for many of the same reasons that
prevented the emergence of a serious American left.

What were the intellectualcauses of the impotence of social-
ism and its failure to develop a dynamic social theory appropriate
to the complicated economic and political realities of this century?

Marx undoubtedly wished his intellectual system to serve
as the beginning of a theoretical reservoir that his successors were
to continuously apply and amplify, but the fact is that it was not.
What may have been a stimulus for social change eventually con-
stricted it as the left failed to keep abreast of the evolution of
modern capitalism and society. This widening gap between theory
and reality often led to the application of 19th century premises
to 20th century conditions, and Marx’ ame the deadening
burden on the left—the opium of optimism and certitude Marx
assimilated in the prior century disarrned the revolutionists of the
20th century save, as in the case of Lenin, where the will to
power led to the abandonment of ideology. The socialists certainly
did not fail because of Marxism, «but because their reliance on a
stulti-fied view of it was used to justify action for which no better
rationale was found. Marxism was, primarily effect rather than
cause, but it failed to correct opportunism and optimism.

Marx and Engels early took their stand against the assump-
tion of the utopian socialists that industrial technology was mal-
leable and capable of decentralized controls and direction by men
for their own social purposes. To Marx and the Marxists the in-

A evitable centralization and monopolization of industry under capi-

talism was not only a prerequisite to a ‘new social order but its
best guarantee. Marxists, from the American Socialist Party to the

 

Mensheviks, dismissed tampering with this inexorable trend as a ‘

hopeless undertaking, After the economic imperativesof the sys-
tem had spun itself into a giant tangled superstructure, capitalism
would presumably choke under its -own weight and contradictions._
Such an interpretation of the evolution of capitalism, logically
led to a consideration of the fragility of the economy in -the larger
social context rather than an inquiry into the extent to’. which big
business might have weaknesses not necessarily involving" constant
and variable capital, surplus value, or’ rates‘ of profitability, but
rather weaknesses reflecting innovation, _ decentralization of the
market, or the international econornyg ‘American socialists, with
the possible exception of William E. Walling, hardly ‘discussed the
prospects for the economy in a way that hinted‘ that the. character
and function of the political order might be deeplyginfluenced by
the needs of the economy, changing. the _’ features of "both politics
and economics in some decisive fashion requiring apolitical theory-
of change superior to Engels’ last expression ‘ of  This
shortcoming was just as‘ true in Europe among :the dominant
schools of socialism as it was in America. . I ' '

It is not unfair to suggest that the parliamentarian  legalist ‘

theory of social‘ change which the American. and European social-
ists accepted in theory and practice before the First" World vWar,
and that the ‘bol-sheviks ‘of Western Europe, accepted in practice
from the mid-1920’s onward, was also a logical outcome of Marx-
ist theory. It would be very easy indeed to catalog Marx and
Engels’ comments_ concerning the need for revolutionary action,
but both in their response to anarchism and the spectacular elec-
toral triumph of German Social Democracy Marx and Engels
eventually opted for left politics asth-e.-crucial means of social
change in the West, and  cal
theory that assumedthat the po it1cal structure in the last __a_r_ia_lysis

The belief in the efficacy ate
neutrality of the state laid the basis for the subsequent parlia-
mentary mechanism, ‘naiveté: and failure of Western European
socialism. A logical conclusion of this premise was a serious mis-
conception of the functions of the state in the economy and
society. American socialists could .'therefore see state intervention
in the economy as a kind of surrogate socialism, perhaps reﬂecting
the interests of small business against big industry, as Walling

interpreted it, but an important step toward true socialism. And
with their faith in parliamentarianism European socialism was led
down the less uncomfortable path of the “politics of responsibility,”
and an accommodation to a fragile and reluctantly liberal order
that failed after 1914- to stem the demise of that system before
the challenges of war and reaction. Responsibility to an irresponsi-
ble society did in fact lead to the-attainment of certain minimal
‘goals in Western Europe——to a kind -of welfare state——but the
socialist movement failed to reverse the deeply regressive aspects
of ‘Western capitalism that periodically expressed itself in crises
that threatened to wipe out, and frequently did so, welfarism and
much else besides, including the socialists. The view of socialists
in America and Europe alike by 1914- was that for all their limita-
tions the existing political forms could be utilized for a clean fight
for a clean victory, a victory that would not be borne in terror,
struggle and counter-terror. For thenew world the socialists wished
to create before 1914, the outlines of which Marx, Engels and
their successors only vaguely specified, the inherited structural
forms were still viable. Both the American and European socialists
accepted this assumption.

The vehicle for exploiting this structure was the working class,
which in its dynamism, strikes ;and organizations created in the
face of repression and conflict, seemed to be engaged in a con-
tinuous process which was, certainly in its American oontext, best
characterized by the term “struggle.” The socialists interpreted this
struggle as having a revolutionary meaning involving decisive
social change rather than limited ends, a confusion that historical
experience has yet to prove justified.  at
this epic of heroism and sacrifice might be directed toward §9__rne-
thing less than heroic and enIE5linE goals. The American socialist
movement, and certain revisionist schools in Europe as well, also
saw the need for winning over men of good will from the middle-
classes, classes that had economic problems also driving them to
socialism, but in the last analysis the concept of the working class
was the core of the theory of change,» ‘

Looking at the emergence of new efforts to regulate the eco-

- nomy prior to the First World War, socialists everywhere failed to

understand the political-economic process they were living through,
a process that was pragmatic, haphazard and hardly comprehended
by even .its most sophisticated advocates. Nothing’ in socialist theory,
much less laissez faire and marginal economic theory, prepared
Socialists for the possibility that a class-oriented integration of the

state and the economy in many’ kev areas would rauonahze and

them to understand and which by their endorsing helped lead to

the almost willing demise of the left. Like orthodox advocates of "

laissez faire, many socialists believed that state intervention in the
economy was a step toward socialism. >_

In all this the response of American socialism was not excep-
tional. The question is not merely why socialists failed to build a
party in" the United States, as important and as uniquely Ameri-
can as these causes may be, but why socialists also failed on the
decisive intellectual issues where they were well organized. To the
extent that the complexities of 20th century capitalism and politics
outstripped American socialism, it may be suggested N that it failed
for the same reasons that the European socialists failed.

II

Yet the distinctive American causes for the _failure of social-
ism and radicalism in the _20th century also deserve reconsidera-
tion. These causes were both external to the organized socialist
groups, rooted in the unique character of the larger social order,
and internal, reflecting the. special qualities of parties and their
followers. '

The political and intellectual history of the Socialist Party,
much less the Communist Party, is far better described and un-
derstood by historians than that of perhaps either major party over
a similar period, and this fascination with causes that have -failed
rather than those that have succeeded affords me the luxury of
generalizing on the thorough research of others. The genesis of
American socialism until 1900 was colorful, like an intellectual
hothouse, but not more so than that of the British Labor, Party,
which was at least as exotic. Socialism as a cause touched every
interesting intellectual current——Christians who saw in polite social-
ism a way to bring a piece of heaven to earth, funny-money ad-
vocates seeking deeper solutions than free silver, cooperative’ colo-
nization groups, led by Eugene Victor_ Debs, that could appeal ‘to

John .D. Rockefeller as _a “Christian gentleman” to bring the
frontier opportunities back to America, discontented intellectuals
seeking to end, the alienation of industrial society, followers of
Edward Bellamy’s—Nati_onalist movement, and, of course, the Marx-
i-st-oriented elements that were to effectively dominate the party
after 1901 when the Socialist Party was formed out of an amalgam
of various groups. ,  V ,

The internal world of the Socialist Party until 1912 was not
unlike that of German Social Democracy, from which it absorbed
many of the doctrinal positions of both Eduard Bemstein’s revi-
sionist school and_his seemingly left critics. The Party was not
merely partially German on ideological issues—borrowing from
the Bemstein-Kautsky debate was a convenience, not a cause—but
also in the classic bureaucratic sense described by Robert Michels
in Political Parties. From this viewpoint the Socialist Party was
a party of functionaries, officials and an elite quite impatient with
rank-and-file democracy and dissent. The Party, like most pre-
World War I European Social Democratic parties, was bolshevik
in structure though fairly democratic in organizational theory.
Later in 1919 the men who controlled the Party before the war
were to expel the vast bulk of ‘the members for their support of
bolshevik theory as well, just as they had expelled the embarrass-
ingly non-parliamentarian Industrial Workers of the World fac-
tion at the 1912 convention, The Party had never actively sought
to enlist the vast slum and industrial working class, and in purging
the I. W. W., it broke with  already minimal pre-war mass
working class contacts. It was, to cite Trotsky’s unkind but apt
remark, a party of dentists, and always remained so at the leader-
ship levels. .

The middle-class character of the majority of Socialist leaders
reflected their belief that the middle-class and skilled workers
were the most promising for membership, and this unconsciously
required a crucial conformity to dominant prejudices, assumptions
that guaranteed that the political strength of the Socialists could
never exceed the 900,000 votes of the 1912 election unless the
Party radically altered its tactics——_,which it never did. In the area
of trade unionism the Party alwaysimaintained its primary contacts
with the A. F. of L., which at this time was the most conservative
major union in the world.

The position of the Socialist Party on civil rights and racism
was hardly designed to win support from the Negro community
either. Before the war the Socialist Party tolerated within its
ranks social segregation, the exclusion of Negroes from Southern
