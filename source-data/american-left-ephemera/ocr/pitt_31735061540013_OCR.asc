HERDINGI THE YOUTH INTO WAR

How is it that the young toilers of Germany, France, Eng-
land, Russia and the other countries involved in the World War

 proved unable to resist mobilization and allowed themselves to

be used by the capitalists as cannon fodder?

It would not be surprising if the well fed sons of the land-
lords and the capitalists threw themselves enthusiastically into
the war in order to win proﬁts for their fathers. But it was just
these young men that were least of all in a hurry to proceed to
the first ‘lines of the front. Moreover, all kinds of privileges
and exemptions, as well as safe officers’ jobs at headquarters and
in the rear were granted to these young men. Those who really
bore the brunt of the war at‘ the front were young workers,
peasants, petty employees and students from poor families.

A considerable number of these young soldiers went to the
front convinced that the war was useful and necessary. The
ruling classes succeeded in persuading millions of toilers that
the war was useful to them too. The sermons in the churches,
the teaching in the schools, the stuff in the papers, the declama-
tions and songs in the theatres——all centered round the necessity
to go to war. Upon the outbreak of the war the timid voices
of some of the opponents of the war were immediately stifled
by the military censorship and by the threat of prison.

In each country the youth was taught to believe that its
nation was superior to all the other nations of the world. In
each country the youth was told: “We have been attacked and
we have to defend ourselves.” In France the youth which was

driven to the front was told that‘it was defending the Republic
10

against reactionary German imperialism, but nothing was said
about republican France ﬁghting in alliance with the reactionary
monarchy of the Russian Tsar. The Russian soldiers driven into
the war were told that they were “defending the oppressed
Slavonic brethren” but nothing was said about the nationalities,
oppressed by tsardom, for whom Russia was a real prison. The
British soldiers were told that they were defending Belgium
against the attack of the Germans, but nothing was said about
the ruthless oppression in the colonies by British imperialists.

Many young toilers succumbed to this crude lie. They would
never have gone to the front had they known that they were

helping to enhance the proﬁts of their own exploiters, helping '

them to grab foreign lands by violence and to subjugate foreign
peoples. They went in the sincere belief that they were ﬁghting
for freedom and right.

Others went because they believed that the war would im-
prove their condition. They believed that after the war their
country would become stronger and richer and then it would
be easier for them to live. They failed to understand that
war was profitable only for a small clique of capitalists, but not
for the workers and peasants who shed their blood on the battle

ﬁeld.

Others again were indifferent as to what was going to hap-
pen after the war. They believed that the war would be a short
one, and in the worst case, would be over in three or four
months; was it worth while quarelling over such a small matter?
They were ordered to go to the front, that meant that they
must go. All the same, they would be back home before Christ-
mas.

However, not all the young soldiers went to the front with
the belief that it was ‘necessary to fight. Many went to the
front because they did not know what they could do to avoid
killing their brothers and risk their own lives. Before the war

 

12 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

many a young worker, peasant or student must have thought
to himself: ‘ _

“I am against violence. I want to live and work and wish
that other people may live and work likewise. I do not want
to kill anyone and do not wish to be killed myself. If a war
breaks out I will simply refuse to go, I will refuse to handle
a riﬂe.”

However, when the war began it all turned out differently.
To refuse to handle a riﬂe was not so simple and not so safe,
and many young toilers had to go to the front against their
own will. They did not know which way to turn the riﬂe so
that the accursed war might be stopped. They did not know
with whom to conclude an alliance for a fight against the war.
There was nobody to tell them how to act. Even before the
war, many of the young toilers gave thought to the question of
how to alter life so that injustice might be abolished‘; how to
change life so that all might live well; how to abolish poverty,
starvation and misery and how to change the world so that there
should be no more oppression and violence, and no more war.
It seemed then that the most.‘ clear answers to these questions
were given to the youth by the Social-Democratic Parties. These
parties were formed many years before the beginning of the
World War. They were mass workers’ organizations, which set
themselves the aim of destroying the capitalist system and of
establishing a socialist society, where there would be no oppres-
sion and no exploitation, and where everybody would work. In
order to overthrow the power of the bourgeoisie, and to estab-
lish a new, free society, Social-Democracy considered it neces-
sary to unite the working class internationally. All the Social-
Democratic Parties were therefore afliliated to the Second Inter-
national.

Repucliation of imperialist war clearly followed from the Social-
Democratic views, since such wars served the interests of the
enemy and oppressor of the workers; As far back as 1907, the

 

HERDING THE YOUTI-I INTO WAR 13

Second International at its Stuttgart Congress passed a decision
indicating how socialists were to act in the case of war:

“In the event of the outbreak of war, it is absolutely neces-
sary to ﬁght for its rapid termination, and strain every effort
to utilize the war caused by the economic and political crisis in
order to rouse the people and thus hasten the end of the
domination of the capitalist class.”

This decision was ‘confirmed by the international Socialist
congresses in Copenhagen in 1910 and in Basic in 1912. Such
decisions‘ were also adopted by the Social-Democratic youth or-
ganizations, which, in 1907, united into an international organi-
zation. In the first days after the declaration of war, the young
socialists of the European countries expected that their leaders
would give the signal for action and show the young opponents
of the war how to act. But it turned out differently.

Even before the war there was a struggle between two
tendencies in most of the parties of the Second International:
the reformist tendency considered it possible to come to an ar-
rangement with the ruling classes, while the revolutionary ten-
dency was in favor of an irreconcilable class struggle of the pro-
letariat against the bourgeoisie. The Social-Democrats of the
revolutionary wing were of the opinion that so long as the bour-
geoisie was in power the proletariat had no fatherland and there-
fore, was not to defend it. The decision of the Stuttgart Con-

gress was adopted precisely at the request of Lenin and Rosa _

Luxemburg, the Socialists who adhered to the revolutionary
section of the Second International. The Social-Democrats of
the reformist wing, and the so-called center, who wavered be-
tween the revolutionaries and the reformists, at one time paid
lip service to the necessity of ﬁghting against the war (avoid-
ing, however, to indicate the way in which this ﬁght was to be
carried on) and at another declared that they would defend the
Fatherland if it were attacked. ’

 

14 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

It was in the nature of things that the reformists who were
adherents of the idea of class collaboration with the bourgeoisie,
betrayed the proletarian International, since proletarian inter-
nationalism. is opposed to the idea that the proletariat and the
bourgeoisie of any particular country have common interests,
and on the contrary maintains that the interests of the prole-
tarians of all countries are at one against the bourgeoisie of all
countries. Only the revolutionary socialists, who consistently
repudiated any collaboration with the bourgeoisie, could, right
to the end, remain internationalists and opponents of the fra-
tricidal war.

Even before the declaration of war, the leadership in all the
Social-Democratic Parties, except the Russian, was in the hands
of the reformists. The bourgeoisie succeeded in splitting the
ranks of the working class, in training a section of highly
skilled and highly paid workers who supported the reformists
and who believed that after all it was not so bad to live under
capitalism and one could get on without the class struggle. The
bourgeoisie succeeded-in attracting to its side the leaders of the
Social-Democratic Parties by bribing them with lucrative posts
in government institutions, and seats in parliaments and muni-
cipalities. The leaders of the Social-Democratic Parties be-
came ever more and more isolated from the masses and accus-
tomed to collaboration with the ruling classes.

The union of the reformists with the bourgeoisie gradually
became more close. At the beginning of the war the leaders of
most of the Parties of the Second International openly took
their stand on the side of the imperialists of their own country.
Not only did they refuse to declare their solidarity with the
proletariat of the other countries, but actively helped the cap-
italists to mobilize the people for war.

The parliamentary representatives of the Social-Democratic
Party in co-operation with the bourgeois deputies voted in favor
of war credits, in favor of giving to the bourgeoisie large sums

 

 

HERDING THE YOUTH INTO WAR 15

of the people?s money for carrying on the war. The most prom-
inent Social-Democrats in France and Belgium, like Guesde,
Sembat and Vandervelde entered the bourgeois governments
and began to take part in the management of the affairs of
their countries, acting exactly like bourgeois ministers. Their
example was followed later by the Social-Democratic leaders of
other countries. The Social-Democratic writers, journalists and
agitators, did all they could in order to justify the treachery of
the labor leaders to the cause of the working class. Following

in the footsteps of the bourgeois patriots, they repeated in vari- .

ous keys: "We were attacked and must defend ourselves.”

In justification of their treachery the Social-Democrats of
France declared that “unless German militarism was removed,
there was no possibility of achieving socialism.”

The Social-Democrats of Austro-Hungary cried menda-
ciously: “Let us go to war in order to liberate the slaves of
the Russian Tsar!”

The Social-Democrats of the belligerent countries openly
appealed to the toilers for reconciliation with the ruling classes.
"The whole German nation must be united in the war!” cried
Scheidemann, the prominent German Social-Democrat.

The leaders of the Young Socialist International acted in
the same manner. The Belgian Socialist, De Man, one of the
founders of the Young Socialist International, immediately
after the declaration of war became a rabid militarist and went
to the front as a volunteer. Ludwig Frank, the leader of the
German Social-Democratic youth, acted likewise. After he was
killed at the front, Arbeiter Iugend, (Working Youth) the
organ of the Social-Democratic youth, used this occasion to
appeal to the youth to follow his example. And indeed, 783
young Social-Democrats responded to this appeal and volun-
tarily joined Kaiser Wilhelm’ s army.

The leaders of the Social-Democratic youth organizations ex-
ercised all their inﬂuence on the youth in order to secure its sup-

  

16

 

THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD 

port for the war measures of the bourgeois governments. At
the beginning of August 1914 the same Arbeiter Iugend ap-
pealed to the youth of minor age voluntarily to join the sanitary
detachments and help gathering the harvest, so that their older
brothers might be released from agricultural work and taken
into the army by the war ministry of the Kaiser. When the
German war ministry organized youth detachments for defense
with the object of giving military training to youths below mili-
tary age, a number of leading workers of the German Socialist
Youth urged the youth to join these detachments.

While the leaders of the socialist youth in the belligerent
countries strained all their efforts to help the imperialists, the
leaders of the youth International found it proper to desist
from all and every activity for the duration of the war. The
secretary of the Young Socialist International, the Austrian
Dannneberg, posted the following notice on the door of the
International Youth Secretariat: “Temporarily closed on ac-
count of the World War.”

What were the young socialists to do?

Some of them said: "Since our leaders who jointly with us,
were going to ﬁght against the war, now tell us that it is neces-
sary to join the army, then surely this must be a different kind
of war, a just war. It is therefore necessary to follow the ex-
ample of De Man and Ludwig Frank.” Others following the
example of Danneberg, funked, and decided that for the dura-
tion of the war it was advisable to give up socialism and do
nothing. “It is not worth while joining the war as a volunteer,
since this is dangerous, but neither is it worth while fighting
against the war, since this too is dangerous. And besides, the
leaders do not seem to do it either.” This was their train of
thought.

True, the example of the leaders was not convincing for all
the young socialists. Many of them realized that neither those
who at the behest of the imperialists. went to the front, nor those

 

 

HERDING THE YOUTH INTO WAR ' 17

who helped the imperialists to carry on the war by refusing to
ﬁght against it, were right. However, the treachery of the
leaders came so unexpectedly and was so glaring that even those
who were convinced that both the Ludwig Franks and the
Dannebergs were wrong, felt helpless, lost and deluded. They
expected that the leaders would call them to fight against the
war but instead they now appealed to them to take part in the

. war or at least, to do nothing that would hinder it.

A few years ago, a certain French writer collected auto-
biographies of twenty-ﬁve French workers, who at the declara-
tion of the war belonged to the young generation. Every one
of them explained in a different way why, in 1914, he went to
the front. All these reminiscences show that the young rank
and ﬁle workers did not wish to go to the war but in spite of
that joined the army because they didn’ t know what to do.

George V, a miner, says in his reminiscences: “I had to go
to the front against my will like many others. And not before

I learned to know all the trenches from the North down to‘

Alsace did I realize with my young brains what war implied
and why we were compelled to kill our neighbors!”

George P, a plasterer, relates: “Before the war I belonged
to the Socialist Youth. I was active, but my views were not
quite formed. At the outbreak of the war I bowed before the
decision of the reformist leaders, believing that this was a war
for right and justice.”

Morris F, a metal worker, relates: “The war broke out. At
the bottom of my heart I expected that something serious would
happen. . . . I presumed that the working class would revolt
against the abomination of the war, but I was terribly disillu-
sioned and I began to doubt the Socialist Party when I saw
that it had not the courage to take responsibilities in this mat-
ter. I was called to the colors and had to go to defend my coun-
try. It was not a pleasant prospect. . . .”

Z The young workers in the other belligerent countries could A’ i

tell the same narrative, Those who went to the war with a

' feeling of disgust as well as those who remained in the rear

and had to bear all the burdens of wartime, were conscious that
the war was an unjust war and that they must put an end to
it. The question was how this was to be done. ‘

 

III

THE SOLDIERS FRATERNIZE

The first months of the war had brought many tortures and
disillusionments, even to those of the young soldiers who were in
favor of the war. The soldiers had to sit in the trenches in
dirt, suffer starvation, cold, and the rude humiliating treatment
of the officers without knowing how many more months or
years this war was going to last. And involuntarily the idea
sprang to the mind of many of the young soldiers:

“Just in front of me, in the trenches of the enemy there
is a worker or a peasant like myself with a rifle. He, like myself,
hoped when he went to the war, that within a few months, he
would be back home, but instead he has to freeze in the trenches.
I am made to hate him and he is made to hate me, whereas his
position in the trenches is just as bad as mine, and his family at
home fares just as badly as mine. He, the same as myself, is
tired from the intolerable life at the front, from the abuse of
the officers and is exhausted by bad and scanty food. Why
should he shoot me or I shoot him? . . .”

These ideas occupied the minds of the soldiers with particu-
lar insistence on Christmas eve of 1914. True, by that time
many of the soldiers, and particularly the young ones, began to
see clearly that religion did not serve the cause of peace and
of the brotherhood of nations. On the contrary, the priests of
all religions called on the people to go to war, vindicated the
war, declaring it to be a just and holy war and blessed the arms
of murder. Nevertheless, that day which they were accus-
tomed to celebrate, many of the soldiers, even the free thinkers,

' wished to spend in peace. ‘On that day they wished to put the

riﬂe aside.

From the reminiscences and letters of many of the par-
ticipants of the war, we know that in the last days of December
1914, for the first time _war operations ceased for at least a couple
of hours.

Here is, for example, a letter by a Scotch non-commissioned
oﬂicer in the British Times, dated January 2, 1915:

“We were in the trenches, and the Germans ‘began to make
merry on Christmas eve, shouting at us to come out and meet
them. They sang songs (very well); our men answered by
singing ‘Who Were You With Last Night?’ and of course ‘Tip-
perary’ (very badly). I was horriﬁed at discovering some of
our men actually had gone out, imbued more with the idea
of seeing the German trenches than anything else; they met
half-way, and there ensued the giving of cigarettes and re-
ceiving of cigar-s and they arranged (the private soldiers of
one army and the private soldiers of the other) a forty-eight
hours’ armistice.

“Christmas day was very misty and out came those Ger-
mans to wish us ‘A Happy Day’; we went out, told them we
were at war with them, and that really they must play the
game and pretend to ﬁght; they went back, but again at-
tempted to come towards us, so we ﬁred over their heads, they
ﬁred a shot back to show they understood, and the rest of the
day passed quietly in this part of the line, but in others a good
deal of fraternization went on.”

A former French soldier of the Twenty-Fifth Regiment who
two years ago wrote his recollections for the French L’Humam'te,
describes:

“December 1914. Section Mon-Sapin-Soupir at the front
held by the Second Company of the Twenty-Fifth Regiment.
“One ﬁne morning we heard a few calls in French. In front
of our trenches at a distance of ten metres, a German soldier

appeared. While one of our people signiﬁcantly exchanged

 

‘ tempts were made to establish the brotherly union of the soldiers

THE SOLDIERS FRATERNIZE 21

handshakes with the German, French and German soldiers
came out from the trenches of either side, exchanged friendly
handshakes. This fraternization continued the whole day.

“In order to stop any further attempts at fraternization,
strict orders were issued threatening anyone guilty of such an
attempt with court martial. In spite of that, on our section
of the front, all the time while we held it, there was no ﬁght-
ing, there was a tacit armistice concluded between ourselves
and the German soldiers. Only the guns never ceased roaring,
reminding us of the war.”

Thus the first, so far only accidental and unorganized, at-

of the belligerent countries with the object of stopping the war.

 

IV
KARL LIEBKNECHT’S GREAT FIGHT

At the same time in the rear, despite the treachery of the
leaders, the few young toilers who did not succumb to the in-
toxication of the general war spirit, began to look for means
and ways of ﬁghting against the accursed war. It was difficult

for these toilers to ﬁnd one another and prepare "concerted ac- ‘

tion. In the ﬁrst months of the war, every opponent of the war
felt himself isolated, ‘helpless, and dared not express his opin-
ions openly.

Not before a few months had elapsed from the beginning
of the war, did the glad tidings of the ﬁrst open action against
the imperialist war spread in the belligerent countries. It was
Karl Liebknecht’s speech in the German Reichstag.

Karl Liebknecht was one of the most gifted representatives
of the young generation of German Social-Democrats and one
of the organizers of the Young Socialist International. As
far back as 1907, at the first International Congress of the
Socialist Youth in Stuttgart, he outlined the tasks of the youth
in its ﬁght against militarism and war danger. He pointed out
that in order to ﬁght successfully against war, the socialists had
to win the soldiers on their side, the socialists had to make the
proletarians in soldiers’ uniforms understand that war, while
being proﬁtable to the capitalists, is a great calamity for the
toilets. Liebknecht realized that the bulk of the army is com-
posed of the toiling youth, and therefore, it was particularly im-
portant to carry on the propaganda of socialism and anti-mili-
tarism among the youth. He used to say: “Those who have
the youth, have the army.”

22 1‘

 

 

KARL LIEBKNECI-IT’S GREAT FIGHT 23

“Quite so,” the socialist reformists agreed, “but are we not
educating the youth in a socialist spirit? We organize lectures,
excursions, concerts, literary evenings, why then carry on special
anti-militarist propaganda? Why force the youth to engage in
politics so early?”

"No,” Liebknecht’ s adherents replied to the reformists, “this
won’t do; in order that the youth‘ may ﬁght against war, it is
necessary to prepare it in times of peace. We must explain to
the youth beforehand that wars, however terrible they may be,
will exist as long as capitalism exists. It must be explained to
the youth that the ﬁght against militarism and war is part of
the emancipationist movement of the proletariat. It is necessary
that the young workers and young soldiers understand that they
are brothers of one class. The socialist youth must work among
the soldiers, they must carry the socialist teachings into the bar-
racks so that we meet the war forearmed.”

This is how the revolutionary minority of the German Social-
Democracy, led by Liebknecht, argued with the reformists in the
years preceding the war. I

At the outbreak of the war, Liebknecht was a member of the
Reichstag. It pained him to see how his comrades openly be-
trayed the cause of the working class. On the fourth of August,
1914, when the Social-Democratic members of the Reichstag
voted in favor of the war credits, he was not yet resolved to come
out single-handed against the rest. Instead of voting against
the war credits, he left the hall while the vote was taken. How-
ever, a few months later, on December 2, when the German
Reichstag had to grant new war credits, Liebknecht declared
courageously that he refused to vote for them and made the
following statement:

“This war, which none of the peoples involved in it willed,
is not in the interests of the German or any other nation, it
is an imperialist war, a ﬁght of the capitalists for the monopoly
of the world market.

 

24 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

"Like the British and French slogan, ‘Against Imperialism’,
the German slogan: ‘Against Tsarism’ was utilized to press
the noble instincts, the revolutionary traditions and aspirations
of the peoples into the service of hatred stirred up among
peoples against each other. Germany which is partly respon-
sible for the crime of the existence of tsardom, and up to the
present serves as an example of political backwardness, is not
ﬁt to play the role of the liberator of peoples. The liberation
of the Russian, as well as of the German people is the cause
of these peoples themselves. . . . We must demand an im-
mediate peace, a peace which should not be humiliating to
any of the parties, a peace without annexations.”

Liebknecht’s courageous speech roused a storm of indigna- ‘

tion not only among the bourgeois members of the Reichstag,
but also among the Social-Democratic deputies. Most of Lieb-
knecht’s former friends turned their backs upon him. The
Social-Democratic leaders accused him of treachery to the coun-
try, and of violating party discipline. Liebknecht’s speech was
not published in any of the papers and was not even included
in the minutes of the proceedings of the Reichstag. However,
the news of Liebknecht’s speech rapidly spread throughout the
country, instilling courage and energy into thousands of the
opponents of the war.

The German government found a way of getting rid of the
recalcitrant member of the Reichstag: they sent him to the front.
But with the first months of 1915 a few of his nearest comrades,
fired by his example, began to work in the spirit of his views.
First of all they distributed thousands of copies of his speech.

Liebknecht, the oldest leader of the Socialist Youth, gave them '

the first example how to act.

Before the young socialists there was yet another example
of the revolutionary struggle against war—the example of the
Russian Bolsheviks, who represented the revolutionary party of
the proletariat of Russia. The Bolsheviks fought against the
oppression of the Russian autocracy in the immensely diﬂicult

KARL LIEBKNECHT’S GREAT FIGHT 25

conditions of illegality and constant persecution. While the
West-European Social-Democrats of the pre-war time had long
ago forgotten what it meant to be deprived of the possibility of
openly calling a meeting, had forgotten what it meant to be

subjected to persecution, the Russian revolutionary Social-Demo- >

crats, the Bolsheviks, were in the course of many years accus-
tomed to carry on their work, constantly risking their freedom
and life. The Bolshevik Party was a small party. Only those
who were resolved consistently to ﬁght to the end for the emanci-
pation of the toilets joined this party and held fast to it. There-
fore, when the war began, the Bolsheviks showed no waverings.
They saw clearly that the cduntry which was dominated by the
Tsar was not worth ﬁghting for. They were the most consistent
of all the opponents of the war.

When the first vote on the war credits was taken in the

_ Duma the Bolshevik members declared themselves against the

vote. From the very first days of the war the five Bolshevik
members of the Duma toured the workers’ districts, convened
illegal meetings of the workers and called upon the masses to

fight against the autocracy and the imperialist war. In the

spring of 1915 they were arrested and exiled to Siberia.

At that time a number of the most prominent Bolsheviks
who were too well known to the tsarist police and could no
longer work in Russia, emigrated abroad and lived in various
European countries. Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Party,
together with a small group of comrades was in Switzerland
from which place he maintained constant touch with the Party
organizations working in Russia. The underground work of
the Bolsheviks in Russia was conducted according to the direc-
tions of Lenin and his closest colleagues, Stalin and Sverdlov,
who, during the war, were in exile in Siberia.

In the first months of the war Lenin began to establish con-
tacts with those few European socialists who remained true to
the class struggle and to anti-militarism. The Russian Bolshevik

emigrants under the leadership of Lenin and with the help of
some Swiss socialists began to make preparations for the crea-
tion of a new International union of the socialists who opposed
the war, an International that should take the place of the Sec-
ond International which was collapsing in consequence of the
treachery of its leaders.

Lenin attached great importance to the youth. He was con-
vinced that it was precisely the youth which would be able to
take its place in the front ranks of the ﬁghters for socialism,
against the imperialist war. He very often met young Swiss
socialists, helped them with comradely advice and closely fol-
lowed their work. ° I

The peculiar position of Switzerland as a neutral country,
aiding the belligerent countries as well as the activity of the
Russian Bolshevik emigrants residing in it, had made Switzer-
land the center of the International youth movement against the
imperialist war.

The young Swiss and Italian socialists (at that time Italy
had not yet entered the war) were the first who conceived the
idea of calling an international conference of the socialist youth
who.were against the war. They were joined by the organiza-
tions of the socialist youth of Holland and the Scandinavian
countries. There were great diﬂiculties in organizing such a
conference. It was the first attempt of the socialists of various
countries to resume the connections which were broken as a
consequence of the collapse of the Second International. The
socialist youth of the countries which did not take part in the
war were able to send delegates to the conference. But the
groups of German young socialists which in spite of their lead-
ers, wished to work in the spirit of Liebknecht, could not be
fully represented. It was very diflicult for them to get across
the frontier. Even those three delegates (from Stuttgart, Gop-
pingen and Karlsruhe) who came to the conference had to ap-
pear under assumed names so as to avoid persecution on the

 

 

KARL LIEBKNECI-wIT’S GREAT FIGHT 27

part of the German government. The leaders of the French
socialist youth altogether refused to_ send delegates.

The Russian revolutionary Social-Democrats, the Bolsheviks,
had no independent organization of the youth, but two Bolshevik
emigrants were sent by Lenin and appeared at the conference.

The International Conference of the Socialist Youth was
opened in the People’s House at Berne on April 4, 1915. After
the speeches delivered by the delegates from the various coun-
tries, in which they expressed the readiness -of the organizations
and groups represented by them to ﬁght against imperialist
war, the conference began to draft its resolutions. The main
resolution drafted by the majority of the delegates contained the
following:

“The‘ present war is a result of the imperialist policy of
the ruling classes of all the capitalist countries. . . . The war is
in an irreconcilable contradiction with the interests of the
working class, whose vital forces it destroys, whose organiza-
tions it deprives of the possibility to work and whose militancy
it is hampering.

“. . . For these reasons the International Socialist Con-
ference of Youth calls for the immediate stopping of the war.
It considers it the duty of the young comrades in the belligerent
countries energetically to support the growing movement to-
wards peace. The conference expects the youth organizations
of the neutral countries actively to support this cause of peace.”

The Russian Bolshevik delegates requested that the resolu-

tion should clearly deﬁne the means by which the struggle

against the imperialist war was to be carried on, and point out
that the fight against imperialist war cannot be successfully car-
ried to a conclusion unless the war between the peoples is con-
verted into‘ a civil war of the toilets against the exploiters, a
civil war which will overthrow the power of the capitalists and
forever remove the cause engendering war, namely, capitalism.
However, the majority of the delegates were not inclined to
accept this amendment of the Bolsheviks. At that time many

28 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

of them were of the opinion that it was possible to persuade the
bourgeoisie to disarm. This belief of the majority of the del-
egates to the Berne Conference that the bourgeoisie might volun-
tarily agree to conclude a just peace and renounce all further
wars, was reflected in the resolution. Instead of pointing out
how to fight against the war, the authors of the resolution lim-
ited themselves to an "appeal for the immediate stoppage of
the war,” and believed that this was sufficient. Thus, the Berne
Conference gave no clear reply to the question of the means by
which the struggle against the war was to be carried on. Never-
theless it laid the foundation for the union of those forces of
the youth which desired to carry on such a struggle.

After the Berne Conference groups of young anti-militarists
in various countries no longer felt themselves isolated and help-
less. I

They knew that they had friends who were of the same mind
in a number of the belligerent and neutral countries.

Already in the Autumn of 1915 a number of organizations
and groups of the socialist youth declared their adherence to
the decision of the Berne Conference and entered into a corre-
spondence with the secretariat which was elected by the Inter-
national Conference and began its work in Switzerland. The
International Secretariat’s first work was to issue The Interna-
tional of Youth, an international anti-military magazine, which
appeared in several languages. . '

The young anti-militarists who published and distributed
The International of Youth were fully aware of the importance
of the work and in spite of all the diﬂiculties in their way never
interrupted this work. From the very ﬁrst issue the magazine
was prohibited in all the belligerent countries but nevertheless,
it was regularly smuggled through into these countries and
widely distributed. The means necessary for the publication of
this magazine were collected by the anti-militarists in the vari-
ous countries with great diﬂiculty. They collected contribu-

 

KARL LIEBKNECI-IT’S GREAT FIGHT - 29

tions and formed an International Liebknecht Fund for the sup-
port of the international anti-war work. Besides the ﬁght
of the youth movement in the West-European countries and
America, among the regular contributors to the magazine were
such prominent socialists of the revolutionary wing as Lieb-

knecht and Lenin. Lenin helped The International of Youth

to make clear the main question which for a long time exercised
the minds of the young anti-militarists of the various countries,
namely, the question of disarmament. Under the inﬂuence of
some of the Dutch, Scandinavian and Swiss delegates, the
slogan of disarmament was adopted at the Berne Conference by
a small majority as a correct and necessary means in the ﬁght
against war. However, even afterthe conference this question
was a debatable one and The International of Youth opened
its columns for a discussion upon it since the question was of
great interest to the young socialists.

The adherents of disarmament argued in the following
manner:

“We are against war because war means violence and cruel-
ty. We are against any militarism, against any war. We must
force our governments to disarm: when there will be no arms,
there will be no violence and no war.”

-..

Lenin took part in this discussion in the columns of The
International of Youth, criticizing in a comradely manner the
adherents of disarmament. He proved that wars were the
inevitable outcome of the capitalist order. The big imperialist
countries have long ago divided the world between them and
subordinated the weaker and more backward countries, but
none of the capitalist countries can be satisfied with what they
have, because production grows and they have to extend their
markets. Each capitalist country tries to extend the markets
for its goods by peaceful competition with other countries, but
none of them wants to yield its place voluntarily to its com-

petitor. Hence imperialist wars and as long as capitalism
exists, the bourgeoisie cannot renounce war. War will be abol-
ished only after capitalism has been overthrown everywhere and
the socialist order established through the dictatorship of the
proletariat. We must not delude ourselves with the false hope
that the bourgeoisie will voluntarily surrender its power to the

socialist proletariat. Before the glorious goal of socialism is '

reached a number of most bitter battles will have to be fought
by the toilets against the exploiters. And only after the vic-
torious issue of these battles, after the liberation of the entire
toiling humanity from oppression and exploitation, after the
abolition of the classes will it be possible to effect general dis-
armament. Later, many of the young socialists enlightened by
their own experience saw clearly that these ideas of Lenin were
correct.

The bourgeoisie of all the belligerent countries cruelly pro-
secuted everybody whose activity was directed to the stopping
of the war. Meetings of young socialists who took their stand
on the platform of the Berne Conference, the distribution of
The International of Youth and of anti-military leaﬂets and
even the correspondence with the International Secretariat in
Switzerland had to be conducted in a strictly illegal manner,
since the penalty for such “crimes” was prison. It was only
with great difficulty that many of the young anti-militarists ac-
customed themselves to these new methods of work. During
the war they realized at last what an extremely cunning and
cruel enemy the bourgeoisie was and saw that unless they wished
to give up the struggle altogether they had to adopt efficient
illegal methods.

The first international anti-military action of the Socialist
youth was the First International Youth Day on October 3,
1915, which was marked in a number of countries by youth
demonstrations against the war.

In the neutral countries these demonstrations proceeded

 

KARL LIEBKNECI-IT’S GREAT FIGHT 31

legally and unhindered. In Denmark, for instance, demonstra-
tions and meetings were held _in forty cities and districts, at
which 3,000 copies of The International of Youth and 30,000
leaﬂets were distributed and 1,200 francs collected for the Lieb-
knecht Fund. In Norway twenty-ﬁve meetings were held at
which 15,000 young workers were present. The biggest of these
meetings was held in Oslo. Six thousand copies of The Interna-
tional of Youth were sold, 1,000 francs were collected for the
Liebknecht Fund. A number of large demonstrations were
held in Sweden, Switzerland and Holland.

In America more than “ﬁfty meetings and demonstrations
were held. The International of Youth gave a description of
some of these demonstrations:

"The socialist youth of New York decided that the best
answer to the instigators of war was to call an international
anti-war demonstratiton on the day following the military
celebrations at Van Cortland Park. True, only a few hundred
-people took part in our demonstration, but all the young
people present revealed a truly internationalist spirit and were
ready to fight all and every variety of patriotism which sets

the_ nations one against the other. . . . Similar meetings and
demonstrations were held in Manhattan, Chicago and other
cities.”

It was much more diﬂicult to carry through the Interna-
tional Youth Day in the belligerent countries. In Italy and
Austria small meetings were held indoors, in France the reform-
ist leadership of the organization of the socialist youth deliber-
ately abstained from taking part in the International Youth
Day. Only the opposition groups of the German Socialist youth
succeeded in holding a number of meetings out of town in spite
of the persecutions of the police and the resistance of the oppor-
tunist leadership. At these meetings militant resolutions were
adopted calling upon the youth of all countries to fight against
the imperialist war. '

V
YOUTH OPPOSES THE WAR

Two of the big imperialist countries, the United States and
Italy, ‘did not join the World War at once, but after a certain
time. From the very beginning of the war many sections of the
Young Peoples Socialist League of‘ America which after the war
nearly in its entirety became a section of the Young Communist
International, held many anti-war meetings and succeeded in
holding the majority of its adherents under its sway and pre-
vented them from being carried away by the chauvinism of
the war. V

The young American comrades who by their demonstrations
and meetings have many a time proved that neither prison nor
police persecution could frighten them, nevertheless, were not
clear as to the‘ methods of mass struggle which were to be

 

adopted against the war besides meetings and demonstrations._

At the congress, which was held in 1916 and was devotedto the
question of ﬁghting against the war, the Young Peoples Socialist
League decided:

“If our country will nevertheless join theiwar, then every
member of the League shall refuse military service.”

In 1917 hundreds of active members of the League acted
accordingly. When the American government ordered the
mobilization they refused to go to war. Many of them were
sentenced to long terms of prison. Before the United States
entered the war the secretary of the Y.P.S.L. even addressed a
letter to President Wilson in which he tried to persuade the
head of the bourgeois government that war was unjust. Need-

32 "

5 .

YOUTH OPPOSES THE WAR 33

less to say, the ‘American government was not moved by this
letter or by the refusal on the part of many of the young social-
ist to‘ handle a riﬂe. In vain did the American young socialists
place their hopes in the pretended noble-mindedness of the rul-
ing class. In vain were all their hopes that by their respectful
requests or by their refusal to handle arms the war might be
stopped. They tried to persuade Wilson that it was not neces-
sary to ﬁght, but took no measures prior to the war to prepare
the young toilers for mass anti-war action. And as a result,
after the declaration of war the active members of the Young
Socialist League found themselves isolated. They could not
prevent the war, because in their ﬁght against it, they relied on
themselves and not on the masses. Thousands of young work-
ers, who hesitated to take the risk of going to prison by refus-
ing military service, went to the war. Since the young oppo-
nents of the war refused to go into the army and did not work
among the soldiers there was no anti-war movement among the
young soldiers at the beginning of the war, and there was nobody
to" tell them how to ﬁght against the war.

The young American anti-militarists employed only legal

methods and thus gave the government the opportunity of

breaking up the Y.P.S.L. Immediately after America’s entry in

‘the war, all the leaders of the League who were capable of

initiating a ﬁght against the war were arrested, while the rem-
nants who were not arrested went over to‘ the reformists. Thus
the ruling classes achieved their aim.

In the ﬁrst months of the war the Italian socialist youth had
several times, through its magazine, Avangardia, appealed to
all the toilers of the country to prepare for the ﬁght against
Italy’s joining the war. The Italian youth realized that work
in the army among the soldiers was the most important thing.
In January 1915 the organization of the Socialist Youth issued
a leaﬂet for the recruits in which it declared:

’ 34 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

“War is a capitalist crime. You are to be trained to take
part in the war in the interests of the greedy exploiters. Think
well over the question—why this war?”

In May 1915, i.e., on the eve of Italy’s entry into the war, the
Congress of the Italian Socialist Youth resolved that the ﬁght
against war was to be linked up with the ﬁght for socialism
against the exploiters. A number of young‘comrades at the
Congress expressed themselves in favor of a general strike in
case of war, but the leadership of the Social-Democratic Party
was against this proposal and the youth could not carry out the
general strike by its own forces. However, the worker youth
took an active part in the powerful demonstrations of protest
against the preparations made by the Italian government to join
the World War.

The anti-militarist movement of the toiling masses was not
strong enough to keep Italy out of the war. But the cruel perse-
cutions of the police could not stop the toilets of Italy and in
the ﬁrst place the youth from carrying on an active ﬁght against
the war even after Italy had joined it. The Italian young so-
cialists had established contacts in the army, distributing social-
ist papers and anti-war leaflets. The Italian revolutionary, Ger-
manetto, in his reminiscences, Memoirs of 4 Barber, writes:

“The soldiers were forbidden to visit our barber shop under
threat of punishment and immediate despatch to the front.
Nevertheless, they came to us and told us what was going on
in the barracks, read and paid their subscription to the papers.
Our contacts with the soldiers remained unbroken and more-
over we even succeeded in printing our Party material
on the typewriters of the General Staff.”

The young Italian comrades tried to master the methods of
illegal work. With the help of young typographical workers
_leaflets intended for the front were printed illegally in ordinary
printing shops without the knowledge of the owners. The leaf-

lets and the anti-war papers were distributed among the army
through the young soldiers on leave, or through young worker
recruits sent to the front who realized that in the army they

,. could do more work by helping to maintain contacts with the

soldiers than they would by refusing military service.

Thanks to the papers and leaﬂets which appealed to them
to ﬁght against the war, the soldiers began to understand what
this war was about, whose interests it favored and how the ﬁght
against it was to be carried on. Likewise the meetings with
young socialists have taught the soldiers on leave many a thing.
And so in the first year of the war, we see a mass movement on
foot among the Italian soldiers on leave against being sent to a
second time to the front. At the end of 1915 The International
of Youth wrote:

“In many cities of Liguria, Toscana, Lombardia and Pied-
mont, there were collisions ‘between the police and the soldiers
who refused to return to the front. At Ouix (Turin) there
were revolts of soldiers who refused to return to the front. . . .
At Aosta hundreds of soldiers who were ordered to the front
offered resistance. They shouted ‘Down with the war!’ Some
of them were arrested, others disappeared and scattered in the
country while the rest removed to Switzerland with all their
belongings. In Sachili (the province in Udine, an important
railway junction) 2,000 soldiers on leave refused to return to
the front and shouting ‘Down with the war’ overturned the
railway cars. In the evening 500 soldiers passed by this place.
When they learned what had happened they too joined the
movement and with songs marched through the city. . . .”

A mass movement against being sent to the front is some-
thing different from an individual refusal to join the army. By
their refusal to answer the call for mobilization the young Amer-
ican and Swiss opponents of the war could not hinder the war;
since every one of them acted single-handed, it was not diﬂicult
for the bourgeoisie to settle with each of them separately. But

 

35 . THE YOUTH IN THE ‘WORLD WAR

the mass movement in the Italian army had undoubtedly weak-
ened its militancy. The young Italian socialists who joined the
army and helped to set on foot this mass movement of the sol-
diers had done a great thing. There is no doubt that this move-
ment among the soldiers hastened on the readiness of the Italian
bourgeoisie to conclude peace. When the police discovered
and arrested the first group of youth for printing leaﬂets, the
entire bourgeois press was jubilant: a conspiracy had been broken
up! Surely the underground activity of the fomenters of trouble
which was disorganizing the army would now stop!

These hopes, however, did not materialize. The young Italian
socialists did not lose heart. When the active young ﬁghters
against the war were sentenced to four and six years imprison-
ment for printing leaflets and anti-war propaganda, their place
was taken by hundreds of others. The arrests and the sentences
did not stop the movement. Right till the end of the war the
Italian youth continued actively to take part in the workers’ anti-

wardemonstrations and in print or by word oftmouth to carry V

their propaganda among the workers and soldiers. After the
war the young Italian anti-militarists formed the Italian Com-
munist Union of Youth._ '

VI
THE LEGACY OF LIEBKNECI-IT

In Germany, after Liebknecht was sent to the front as a
punishment for his action against the war, several groups
of the youth, who were against the war, began to work in the
spirit of Liebknecht. They began to ﬁght not only against the
war, but also against the leaders of the Social-Democratic Party,
who had called upon the workers to go to the war, and in par-
ticular against E‘bert, Scheidemann and Noske, who later killed
Liebknecht. ’

Many of the young German toilers were indignant over the
nationalist war campaign of the §‘lrbez'ter Jugend, the organ of
the reformist leadership of the Social-Democratic youth. A
number of the groups of youth expressed their protest against
the war, first of all by painting black the most obnoxious war
articles in the Arbeiter Jugend before distributing the paper, or
by stopping their subscriptions to it. Instead of the patriotic
Arbeiter Jugend which endeavored to train the young toilers so
as to make them suitable cannon fodder for the bourgeoisie, the
anti-militarist groups of the youth began secretly to distribute The
International of Youth as well as leaﬂets, published by the Spar-
tacists, the adherents of Liebknecht who later founded the Com-
munist Party of Germany. To this group of Spartacists (who
called themselves after the name of Spartacus, the leader of the
uprising of the slaves in ancient Rome) among others belonged
Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin and Franz Mehring. As far as
it was possible Liebknecht maintained contact with this group.

In their leaﬂets and manifestoes the Spartacus group ex-
plained to the toilers that the war was the business of the ex-

37 ‘

 

  

38 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

 

ploiters and not of the toiling people; that the enemy whom the
German toilers had to ﬁght, were not the toilets of other coun-
tries, but German imperialism. In May, 1915, the Spartacists
published a leaﬂet written by Liebknecht in which it was said:

“The chief enemy -of the German people is in Germany it-
self. It is German imperialism, the German war party, Ger-
man secret diplomacy. The German people must ﬁght this
enemy in its own country, ﬁght politically, jointly with the
proletariat of the other countries, which ﬁghts its imperialists
at home. ' .

“. . . How long will the imperialists abuse the patience of
the people? Once more—have clone with murder! Down with

,the instigators of war on both sides of the frontier! Let us
put an end to this world slaughter!

“Proletarians of all countries, follow the heroic example
of your Italian brothers! Unite for the international class strug-
gle against the conspiracies of secret diplomacy, against im-
perialism, against war, for peace in a socialist spirit! The chief
enemy is in one’s own country.” ‘

_ The Spartacists said: “So long as capitalism exists there will
always be a danger of war.” This meant that every toiler could
help in the struggle. against war by means of an every day strug-

 

gle against the employers, against the capitalist State. The revo- V

lutionary youth, led by Liebknecht, began to work in the spirit
of these ideas.

In the early spring of 1916, in the back room of a small res-
taurant in the city of Jena, a few young men and women met
and listened attentively to what a comrade who seemed older
than all the rest was telling them. The restaurant-keeper who
had let the room was fully convinced that it was a conference
of the “Union of Free German Excursionists.” He never sus-
pected that the young excursionists were really young socialist
opponents of the war from various parts of Germany, and that
the older comrade was Karl Liebknecht, member of the Reichstag

 

THE LEGACY OF LIEBKNECHT 39

and now a common soldier of the German army. .
Having taken leave for a few days, he left the front and 
took part in this meeting in order to assist the youth in organiz- ' 
ing for the struggle against the war. l
The Jena Conference united the opposition groups of the I
Social-Democratic youth. They deﬁnitely decided to break with I
the reformist leadership and become an independent organiza-
tion for the class struggle of the toiling youth, to work jointly l
with the older comrades of the Spartakus Bund and illegally J

publish its anti-war papers. t
A German comrade who worked in Berlin during the war
relates the following:

“Our group like the other groups of the Spartacist youth 
energetically distributed anti-war papers and leaflets. We es- 
tablished contacts with the young workers and apprentices in
all the factories and mills of our district, we had talks with
them, trying to ﬁnd out their attitude to the war. We would
ask them: ‘Do you want the war to end?’ ‘Yes,’ they would
answer. ‘Then help us!’ Through the apprentices we regularly
distributed The International of Youth, the Spartacus letters
and our papers and leaﬂets in the factories and mills. This
was not an easy matter. A few of our comrades were caught
and arrested. Some of them had to spend a couple of months
in prison and some a year.

“On many occasions we succeeded in printing our leaﬂets
in private printing- shops whose owners sympathized with our
cause. Sometimes the printing was undertaken by young
typographical workers who had the possibility of entering the
A printing shop at night and there they printed our papers and

' leaﬂets; sometimes, where they were so trusted by their em-
ployers and masters that they were not watched, they would
do it during working hours.

“Several times in the course of a year our group organized
excursions out of town and invitations to take part in them
were sent to the youth from various sport and tourist circles,
such as the Young Friends of Nature, etc. At first only a
‘few people came to such excursions, but later when we united.

 

KARL LIEBKNECHT
Speaking at a Demonstration in Berlin During the War.

"This war, which none of the peoples interested
wanted, was not declared in the interest of the Ger-
mans or of any other people. It is an imperialist war
. . . for domination of the world markets, for political
domination of important quarters of the globe, and for
the beneﬁt of bankers and manufacturers . . . This
is not a defensive war . . . The only durable peace will
be peace based on the solidarity of the working masses
and liberty. The Socialists of all countries must work
for such peace even during the war . . . Away with
the hypocrisy of the civil truce——Forward to the class
struggle! Forward to the international class struggle
for the emancipation of the working class and
against war!”

 

   

 

TI-IE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

with other groups, we succeeded in bringing the number of
participants in such excursions to 1000-1200 people. Some of
thesewexcursions were arranged in the forests where there were
no police and nobody was watching us; our seemingly harm-
less excursion would then be transformed into a militant meet-
ing with speeches and discussion on the subject ‘Down with
the Imperialist War.’ Many of the young lovers of nature
and sport returned from such an excursion, fully convinced
opponents of the war, and afterwards gave us active help.
In this way we gradually extended our inﬂuence on the youth.”

The young Spartacists were not frightened by the difficulties
of the work among the soldiers. At the meetings of the groups,
some of the young comrades read aloud letters received from the
front from brothers and friends. From these letters the groups
learned to know about the prevailing mood among the soldiers,
about -their thoughts and the questions which were not clear to
them. And political answers to these letters were drawn up
collectively. New addresses of soldiers at the front were col-
lected and numerous letters were sent in which family affairs
were intermingled with an exposition of the latest Spartacist
manifestoes.

Various methods were adopted in the correspondence with
the soldiers. The letters were drafted in such a way as to give
no ground for suspicion to the military censorship. For instance,
the military censor surely would not object if the soldier wrote
home: “The oﬂicers treat us well . . . we try to execute all their
orders.” The relatives at home knew that all the words under-
lined in the letter were to be taken in an opposite sense.

Girls sent presents to the soldiers at the front. The military
censorship in most cases never suspected that in a box of cigar-
ettes, or of candy, an anti-war leaﬂet printed on thin paper was
cleverly concealed. In those cases where the leaﬂets were dis-
covered, the senders were not spared. A few girls‘ under eighteen
years had to pay with imprisonment for sending such parcels.

On May First, 1916, Liebknecht who took his leave from the

 

TI-IE LEGACY OF LIEBKNECHT 41

army was expected to arrive in Berlin. The Spartacists, young
and grown-up, were preparing to celebrate the First of May by
an anti-war demonstration. At that time the Berlin police suc-
ceeded in tracing some of the “suspect” private printing shops
and was shadowing them. However, the Royal Court Printing
oﬂice (Kaiserliche Hof Buchdruckerei) was of course, beyond
suspicion, and was not watched. And it'was in this printing shop
that the Spartacists printed the First of May manifesto in good
time in a few thousand copies. At seven o’clocl< in the evening
the Potsdammer Platz was ﬁlled with thousands of Berlin prole-
tarians, most of them young workers. Cries were heard: “Down
with Imperialist War! Long Live the Social Revolution! Long
Live Liebknecht! Down with the Government!” At 7:30 Karl
Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg appeared from the Potsdam-

mer Station. They were greeted with the strains of the I ntema- D

tional. The police with drawn swords attempted to disperse the
crowd. Karl Liebknecht, surrounded by the youth, shouted
aloud: “Down with the war, down with the government!” The
police pounced upon the comrades who surrounded Liebknecht,
pushed them aside, arrested Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg
and many of the demonstrators and carried them oil to the police
station. Liebknecht was condemned to four years’ prison. He
was released in the autumn of 1918 by the November Revolu-
tion.

By. that time the name of Liebknecht, the first champion of
the West European workers’ movement who dared to raised his
voice against the imperialist war, because known to the youth
of the entire world. On May 21 the youth carried through an
International Day of Protest against the sentence pronounced
upon Liebknecht and everywhere where the opportunity presented
itself the young and adultpworkers gathered to demand the lib-
eration of the leader of the revolutionary youth and the fearless
ﬁghter against the imperialist war. The First of May demonstra-

THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

tion, Liebknccht’ s action and his arrest, were the signal for hun-
dreds of demonstrations and meetings against the war and
against the sentence passed upon Liebknecht throughout all Ger-
many.

The German revolutionary youth, following Liebknecht’s ap-
peal, bore in mind that the enemy was in their own country, that
the fight against war meant also a fight against their own ex-
‘ploiters. In 1916 when the ﬁrst great strikes began in Germany
the working youth took an active part in them.

In the spring of 1916 the government granted permission to
the army command to issue so-called orders concerning savings
in the regions occupied by them. These orders represented
nothing else but compulsory subscription which the toilets had
to make for military loans. The first of these orders was issued
by the command of the Tenth Army, and concerned the work-
ing youth. According to this order, out of his wages every
young worker was not to receive more than sixteen marks, while
the remainder was to be retained for subscriptions to the loan.
Thus, the young workers, who were not old enough to shed their
blood in defense of the exploiters on the battle ﬁelds, had to pay
the expenses of the war by their hard earned pennies. They
were to deny themselves the last morsel of bread and with their
scanty means were to support the cause for which their elder
brothers were compelled to die.

The young workers of Brunswick, exhausted from ever in-
creasing misery, decided to resist this new robbery. On the First
of May, the young workers of Brunswick had struck. On the
following day, the army command expressed its readiness to
raise the margin of the wages paid to the young workers to 24
marks. However, the young workers were not satisfied with this
concession, and decided to ﬁght till complete victory. A few of
the mills closed completely. Every day the young workers held

‘ mass meetings against the war and the war loans.

THE LEGACY 04F LIEBKNECHT 43‘.

_ Shortly before this strike in Brunswick there was a rise in the
prices of potatoes and’ other foodstuils. The adult workers,
enraged by the high prices, and the army command’ s plan of
conﬁscating part of the wages of the young workers with which
many of them had to support whole families, took an active
part in the meetings of the youth, expressing their readiness to
support them in their fight.

The local trade union leadership, reformist to a man, at-
tempted to persuade the young workers to accept the concession
made by the army command. However, the indignation of the
workers in the city was so great that the trade union leadership
had to bow to their will and in their turn threatened the mili-
tary command with a general strike if this order was not abol-
ished. On May 5 the young workers gained a -complete vic-
tory. The order about compulsory savings was abolished. Sim-
ilar strikes of the youth took place in Hanover, Magdeburg and

other cities. The revolutionary youth was in the first ranks of I

the strike movement of the German proletariat, a movement
which was particularly widespread in the last few years of the
war. No police persecutions, no arrests and imprisonment could
hold the youth back from ﬁghting. By its propaganda in the
army it helped to spread the revolutionary movement among the
soldiers and sailors, who, in November, 1918, jointly with the
workers in the rear had overthrown the empire of Wilhe'lm and
thereby hastened the end of the war. '

 

VII
STRENGTHENING THE ANTI-WAR STRUGGLE

In Austro-Hungary, the neighboring country which was in

alliance with imperialist Germany, the young workers who were

under the inﬂuence of Liebknechtwand the young Spartacists, ac-
tively fought against the war.

The revolutionary youth of Vienna devoted special attention
to the work among army recruits. At first, there was a tendency
among the young workers by hook or by crook to evade military
service, the recruits were given advice as to what stories they
were to tell the doctor at the medical inspection so that they
might be released. Soon however, it became clear that this was
not the way to ﬁght against war. The groups of socialist youth
which opposed the opportunist leadership and which really wished
to ﬁght against the war, began to adopt different methods in
their work with the recruits; they organized talks on the sub-
ject: "What are you to do at the front?” These talks were
delivered in approximately the following vein:

“You must remember that the ofhcer is your enemy and
that the worker in the rear is your friend. You must explain
to your comrades in your regiment that it is not the country
that you are sent to defend, but the capitalists’ proﬁts. The
oﬂicers will tell you: ‘Let us go to defend our families from
the invasion of the enemy!’ But you must understand and
explain to your comrades that the worst enemy of your wives
and children who are left in the rear are the capitalists in our
country. The ofﬁcers will tell you: ‘The hardships of war-
time are borne by the whole country!’ But you think it over
and suggest to your comrades to think it over and compare

44

 

STRENGTHENING THE ANTI-WAR STRUGGLES 45

the life of the bourgeoisie in wartime with our workers’ life;
it will then become clear to you, that it is we, the workers,
who bear all the hardships of the war, while the capitalists
are reaping more proﬁts than ever they did in peacetime. The
oﬂicers will tell you all sorts of terrible things about the enemy’s
army, about its cruelty. But you must understand and explain
to the comrades, that the soldiers of the enemy are workers
like yourselves and are as little responsible for the war as you
are. In order to stop the war as soonpas possible, it is necessary
on every occasion to es-tablish contact with the soldiers of the
enemy and fraternize with them. However, in order that the
fraternization should prove successful, and you should not be
shot, it is necessary that many soldiers should take part in
such fraternizations. If there will be many of you the of-
ﬁcers will be powerless to do anything against you. Write to
us from the front butpwrite so that the military censorship
is unable to detect anything. Learn to handle the leaﬂets care-
fully, learn how to hide them well, so that neither you not
we should come to trouble.”

In this manner the Austrian youth established ﬁrm contacts

' with the army through the recruits and soldiers on leave. The

disturbances in the Austrian army in 1918 were to a consider-
able degree the eﬁect of the work of the revolutionary youth.
The anti-war movement of the youth in Hungary began only
in the last years of the war. At a patriotic demonstration in
Budapest in the beginning of 1917, several students who
shouted—“Down with the W/ar!”——were arrested. They were
members of the student circle, “Galileo Club,” which was the first
anti-war group of the youth in Hungary.

As long as the students were not connected with the workers
or soldiers, they could do nothing but take isolated action at
demonstrations; very infrequently they distributed leaﬂets, in
which the demand for peace was not concrete and was not
linked up with the necessity to carry on the class struggle against
the enemy in one’s own country.

Only after the January strike of 1918 in Budapest, which

 

46 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

stirred the revolutionary activity of the Hungarian workers, did
the students establish connections with the working youth who
were in opposition to the socialist organization of the youth.

In one of the districts of (Budapest, where the Social-Demo-
cratic organization of the youth had broken with the reformist
leadership and united with the student group, a strong group
of revolutionary youth was formed. The movement spread to
other workers’ districts in Budapest. .The leader of the move-
ment was Otto Korvin, who later became one of the greatest
ﬁghters for Soviet Hungary and was hanged by the fascists.
Korvin’s group carried on anti-war propaganda in the factories,
distributed leaﬂets against the war, and at the same time helped
to organize the struggle for the demands of the youth and of
the apprentices against ﬂogging, against rough treatment and for
an increase in wages.

With the help of a few Russian prisoners of war, who were
aa that time in Budapest, Korvin’s group had secretly published

and distributed leaﬂets. Through these leaflets in which the sol-

diers were called upon to turn their arms against their own op-
pressors and not against their foreign" brothers, the group gained
access to the barracks.

The movement under Korvin’s leadership rapidly spread and
counted among its followers a few hundred young Budapest
workers. In the beginning of May 1918, after the youth had
distributed a large number of leaflets on the first of May, the
illegal organization of the youth was discovered and thirty-ﬁve
of its active workers were arrested.

However, a few days later, a young man appeared at the
police headquarters and declared:

“You have arrested a score or so of people ‘for printing
and distributing leaﬂets. They are absolutely innocent. It was
I who did it.”

“And who are you?”

 

  

 

STRENGTHENING THE ANTi-WAR srnueems 47
“Emmerich Schallai, an employee. I have printed the
leaﬂets.”

In fact, Schallai was a rank and ﬁle member of the move-
ment. However, he somehow succeeded in proving that he alone
was the “guilty” person and most of the arrested comrades were
liberated. The heroic self-sacriﬁce of Schallai had saved the
organization. The anti-war movement of the youth continued,
it grew into- a Communist movement of the youth and later
served as a firm support of the Soviet power in Hungary..

“DOWN WITH THE WAR!”

In France the reformist leadership of the socialist organiza-
tion of the youth succeeded at first in maintaining its hold on
the youth and keeping it out of the anti-war movement.

Only in 1916 under the inﬂuence of the Russian Bolshevik
emigrants who were in France at that time, the ideas of interna-
tionalism began to spread among the French workers. Both
the Bolshevik delegates to the Berne Conference, George Safarov
and Inessa Armand, carried on revolutionary work in France
during the war. Very often Lenin helped them with his advice
and with his letters. I’ ‘

Despite the wish of the reformists, an opposition group of the
youth was formed in the province of Seine (in the central part of
France), which jointly with the Bolsheviks and the anti-militarist
comrades from the socialist parties and the trade unions, had set
to work. The Bolsheviks translated Lenin’s pamphlets and Lieb-
knecht’s articles into French, and together with the French com-
rades, distributed them among the workers and soldiers. At the
same time, independently of the Bolsheviks, small groups of
young intellectuals, students and teachers, carried on anti-war
propaganda. The works of prominent French writers directed
against the war, such as Under Fire by Barbusse and articles by
Romain Rolland had an enormous inﬂuence on the youth.

The French soldiers were more susceptible to anti-war propa-
ganda. They, like the soldiers of the other armies, wished for
a speedy end of the accursed war. Many of them were ready
to follow the advice given in one of the most popular socialist
48

 

“DOWN WITH THE" WAR!” 49

anti-war pamphlets which was distributed in the French army:
“The socialists of all the belligerent countries must act in the
way indicated by Liebknecht, namely, turn their arms against
their own governments.”

Raymond Poincare, the former president of the French Re-
public during the war, rightly nicknamed “Poincare-War,” in his
reminiscences, calls the year 1917, the “year of troubles.” This
year was really a year of troubles for the French bourgeoisie.

Beginning with the spring, big strikes and mass demonstrations

were held in Paris under-the slogans “Down with the War” and
“Send the Soldiers Home.” The working youth took an active
part in these strikes and demonstrations.

However, for the French bourgeoisie, still more terrible than
this movement of the urban workers was the movement of the

soldiers at the front. On May 29, 1917, Poincare enters in his
diary:

“Signs of lack of discipline are increasing in the army.
At Dormans, the soldiers shouted: ‘Long Live the Revolution,
Down with the War!’ A whole company refused to come out
of the trenches.”

On May 30 Poincare writes: “. . . quite recently two regi-
ments of the 30th and 129th Infantry have jointly decided ‘To
march upon Paris’. Measures were taken to disperse them. The
news that at Dormans, the soldiers shouted, ‘Down with the War,
Long Live the Russian Revolution,’ is being confirmed. Paciﬁst
pamphlets are distributed at the stations.” On June 2, Poincare
regretfully writes in his diary:

“. . . I learned from General Erbillion about new insurrec-
tions, this time in the 21st Corps. The soldiers refused to go
to the trenches. Order is threatened everywhere.”

On June 3 worse still:

THE FRUITS OF “VICTORY”

The twentieth anniversary of the World War in which
most of the countries of the world had been involved and which
had lasted over four years at a cost of ten million human lives
has just passed.

This year a generation of young men and women who practi-
cally do not remember the war, since their conscious life had
not begun before the war was over, will have come of age.
This generation does not remember the terrible calamities, the
misery, the starvation, the intense exploitation which the war
brought to the toilets of all the belligerent countries. They re-
member but vaguely how the workers’ families whose only
breadwinner left for the front fared in those days. They
hardly remember how people had to keep alive on the miser-
able rations of indigestible "war” bread and dry vegetables.
They do not remember how the workers had to give their last
pennies to the bourgeois governments as a “voluntary subscrip-
tion” to war loans. They do not remember the life of those
days full of fear of aerial bombardment, of an invasion of their
own or the enemy’s troops accompanied by expulsions and re-
quisitions. They do not remember the anguished searches. for
the names of dear ones in the lists of killed or lost.

This generation which has never been at the front does not
know what it means to be eaten up by gases, to be pierced by
bayonets or to feel the steel of the surgeon’s knife, It does

“New regrettable incidents at the front. General Fournier
informs that one division in the 21st Corps discussed the ques-
tion whether it should agree to go to the trenches and resume
the offensive. It decided to go to the trenches, but to remain
on the defensive. Another division of the 7th Corps refused to
go to the trenches.”

The anti-war manifestations of the soldiers and sailors which
caused so much worry to Poincare and the military command
ended in the suppression of the insubordination. The soldiers
were lacking leadership, the insurrections broke out spontane-
ously without preparation. A former soldier of the 46th In-
fantry Regiment in his recollections, tells us for instance how the
soldiers instead of directing their arms against the oﬂicers, at-
tempted to ﬁght against the war without arms and in consequence
had to obey their officers, and go into battle:

“We decided not to go whatever happened, and hid in the
nearest forest. Some of us had arms, but after a discussion, we
yielded to theeloquent and insistent soldiers and returned our
riﬂes, hand grenades and machine gun-s to the barracks. The
‘night passed. The oﬂicers tried to persuade us, but they were
met with curses and hostile shouts, ‘Down with the War,’
‘Grant Us Our Leave,’ and with the singing of the Inter-
national.

“Morning came, the forest was surrounded by cavalry and,
we were told, also by Senegalese, whom however, we did not
see.

“A powerful limousine drove up, Colonel Lapoin stepped
out and ordered us to go to the front line. The soldiers kept
silent. They waited. We discussed our demands.

“We exchanged glances. We were unarmed. The other
sections had gone to the front. The ring around us was grow-
ing narrower. We felt that at the slightest movement on
our part we would be attacked. We were defeated and we sur-
rendered without a ﬁght. We agreed to proceed to Craconne.”

The French soldiers who attempted to stop the war by dis-

obeying the ofﬁcers were not united, they received no advice from
anyone as to how they were to act. The leaders of the French
Socialist Party during the war were the true aiders and abettors
of Poincare. The soldiers could expect no help from them in the
ﬁght against war. The movement of the opposition groups of the
socialists who opposed the war, was not strong enough to take
the leadership in these insurrections of the soldiers. But, al-
though each of these soldier insurrections was suppressed sep-'
arately, they nevertheless compelled the French bourgeoisie to
hasten with the conclusion of peace. Taken together, all these
insurrections decidedly hastened the end of the war. And here
great credit must be given to the French working youth which
helped the older comrades to carry the revolutionary propaganda
into the army. —

YOUTH IN THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION

In tsarist Russia the movement of the youth against the war
developed under special conditions. No independent organiza-
tions of the youth existed in Russia. The tsarist government
considered the holding of meetings or the existence of workers’
organizations, and particularly of youth organizations in Russia
to be a criminal offense. The young workers and apprentices
who were entirely at the mercy of the arbitrary rule of the mas-
ter, had no right to form even the most harmless circles for self-
education. Pupils and students had no right to hold meetings
and were entirely at the mercy of reactionary teachers and pro-
fessors, who were devoted to the tsar. The tsarist government
considered circles and meetings as “sedition.” ‘

However, the working youth of tsarist Russia took a lively
interest in politics, precisely because they were forbidden to take
an interest in it, and because they hated the tsarist regime and
strove to get rid of the system of exploitation and arbitrariness.
Under the conditions of great oppression and police persecution
the youth without forming an independent secret revolutionary
organization, actively helped the general revolutionary movement
and took part in it.

In the years preceding the war and during the war itself, the
youth which wished to ﬁght against the war and against the tsar-
ist government rallied around the only revolutionary party of the
Russian proletariat, namely, the Bolsheviks. Wlﬁle the reform-
ist leaders of Social-Democracy in the European countries were

 

preaching that “the youth was not to meddle in politics,” the .

Bolsheviks, on the contrary, taught the youth to take an active
part in the political struggle and gave the young comrades
responsible work in the Party.

  

 

YOUTH IN OCTOBER 53

Thus, the ﬁght of the Russian youth against the war was
inseparable from the work and struggle of the Bolshevik Party.

We know Lenin’s views on the war and we know how the

Bolsheviks who were in exile in the various countries of Europe

had helped the international movement of the youth in its ﬁght
against the war. The views held by Lenin were sharedby the
Bolsheviks who worked secretly in Russia. They considered that
the ﬁght against the imperialist war was at the same time a ﬁght
of the workers against the exploiters, against the enemy in one’ s
own country. They considered that in order to ﬁght properly
against the war, it was necessary to carry on a ﬁght to a ﬁnish
against capitalism which engenders war.

The Bolsheviks realized that it was impossible to ﬁght against
the war or against tsardom and the capitalists and the landlords
without working in the army. They well remembered the experi-
ence of the Revolution of 1905, when the tsarist government
succeeded in suppressing the rising of the Moscow workers with
the help of the army. They paid particular attention to work
among the soldiers. They had a military organization which
worked in still greater secrecy than the Party. The Bolsheviks
sent their most tried and trusted comrades to work among the sol-
diers. During the war, the Bolshevik military organization in-
defatigably worked in the tsarist army, explaining to the soldiers
the cause of the war, and pointing out to them the way in which
the struggle against the imperialist war and against the tsarist
government was to be carried on. At the same time the Bol-
sheviks worked in the mills and factories, organizing the workers
for a struggle against the employers.

The ﬁrst revolutionary manifestations of the soldiers and
sailors began in 1915. The work of the Bolsheviks in explain-
ing to the soldiers that the cause of the working class was their
cause too, was not in vain. When the ﬁrst strikes during the war
began in Petrograd (now Leningrad) the soldiers in many cases

 

54 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

refused to act against the strikers. During the strike at Reno’s
works in Petrograd, the soldiers of ’the 181st Regiment which
was quartered in the near vicinity, helped the workers to drive
away the police. The military command removed the recalcitrant
regiment to a suburb.

In February 1917 the Russian workers, peasants and soldiers
overthrew the autocracy. The success of the February Revolu-
tion was decided by the Petrograd soldiers going over to the
side of the workers: Immediately all the military stores of the
capital fell into the hands of the insurrectionists who without
great diﬂiculty seized the arsenal. In most of the other cities
of Russia, the army likewise took the side of the workers. The
workers and soldiers overthrew the Tsar in the hope that this
would stop the war. But after the February Revolution power
was assumed by the bourgeois Provisional Government, which did
not even think of stopping the war, but on the contrary, pro-
claimed the slogan, “War to a victorious end.” It tried to per-
suade the workers and soldiers that now, after the tsarist op-
pression was overthrown, it was worth while continuing the war.

The Bolsheviks explained to the masses that even after the
overthrow of the tsar, the war remained as it was, a predatory
capitalist war which had to be stopped no matter what ﬁne
phrases the bourgeoisie and their Social-Democratic hangers-on
were using to cloak its imperialist nature. During the Febru-
ary Revolution mass elected organizations of the workers grew
up throughout Russia. They were the Soviets of Workers’,
Peasants’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. The Bolsheviks raised the
slogan of “All Power to the Soviets,” explaining to the toilets
that only their own power, only the Soviet power, could put an
end to the war. Gradually they began to prepare the toiling
masses for the new revolution, for the overthrow of the Provi-
sional Government and for the establishment of the government
of the working class, viz., the dictatorship of the proletariat.

 

 

 § I YOUTH IN OCTOBER 55 v

In the period of March-October 1917 the Bolsheviks devel- '
oped their agitation among the soldiers for a ﬁght for a Soviet
government and for putting an end to the war. They published
soldiers’ papers, The Soldiers’ Pravda, The Trench Pravda, The
Worker and Soldier, which in a plain, vivid language explained 1,;
to the soldiers the Bolshevik views on the war. Stalin, one of the 3;
editors and organizers of the Bolshevik soldier press, is the pres- :4
ent leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and of
the Communist International. 

The soldiers themselves wrote a great deal in these Bolshevik C
papers, which en-joyed great popularity at the front. Their let- i
ters showed how the will for peace grew in the Russian army. ll

For instance, the soldier, F. I. Ivanov wrote: Q

"Comrade soldiers in the rear, the oﬂicers tell us to get 
ready to resume the offensive. But how shall we resume the 
offensive, if in our company, out of 260 people, only 79 people ‘
are left? In the line, the distance between one soldier and 
another is 100 paces. How can we ﬁght? Very soon, even ml
those of us who are left will be killed and what for? Our 1
‘boots are terribly heavy and we get rotten bread. Comrade
soldiers, trust our letter, send all the capitalists here into the ‘
trenches, let them taste life at the front, so that they stop
goading us into resuming the offensive.”

The soldier, George Gladyshev, in his letter described how
the Russian soldiers fraternizecl with the German army:

“On Easter Day, at nine o’clock in the morning, the enemy
began to shout: ‘Russ, don’t shoot.’ We climbed out of the 
trenches, we embraced, shook hands, treated one another, we 
treated them with bread and they treated us with cigarettes 3;
and cigars. They spoke about peace, saying that they have 
been wishing for it for ever so long a time and we also spoke i
to them. They all looked pale and emaciated; they receive ;
only one and a half pounds of bread for two days. They say [1
that they are the miserable remnants from the French and

 

   

THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

British fronts. After that day, I feel like shouting, ‘Down
with the War, Long live international eternal peace!’ We
don’ t want to annex lands, while thousands of acres of the
landlords’ lands are lying waste.”

The letter of the soldier Tatarov gives an example, how under
the inﬂuence of the Bolsheviks, the soldiers gradually began to
learn how to act in order to put an end to the hated war. Tatarov
wrote in The Soldiers’ Pravda:

“Two days ago I succeeded in having a chat with one of
the soldiers of the Austrian army. He told me that their sol-
diers think the same as we do, and although'their emperor
assures everyone that he will hold out, the people want to
destroy the capitalists and stop the war. Before I arrived in
my regiment, the soldiers were incited by the bourgeois officers
against Comrade Lenin. The oﬂicers told them that Lenin
and his Leninists urged the people to acts of rob'bery and mur-
der and the soldiers believed them. But I began to explain to
them the ideas of Comrade Lenin and then all the soldiers in
our regiment came over to my side and realized that in order
to bring the war to an end it was necessary to destroy the
government of the bourgeoisie.”

Thousands of such Tatarovs, mostly young people, became
the carriers of the Bolshevik ideas in the army. They prepared
their comrades in the barracks for the overthrow of the bour-
geois government and for ending the war in a revolutionary man-
ner. The first legal organizations and circles of the youth made
their appearance after the February revolution. A strong or-
ganization of the youth, which was against the war and sym-
pathized with the Bolsheviks, was formed in Moscow, in the
summer of 1917. This organization was the first in Russia to
organize an anti-war demonstration of the youth on International
Youth Day. On October 15, a few thousand young workers
gathered in one of the central squares of Moscow, displaying

placards with inscriptions “Down with the war,” and “All Power

to the Soviets.” After a short meeting, a resolution was adopted
to the following effect: "We demand that an All-Russian Con-
gress of the Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’ and Soldiers’ Depu-
ties should immediately assume power and take steps to con-
clude an armistice on all the fronts and a general democratic
peace.” _

This wish of the Moscow working youth was very soon to
materialize. On November 7, 1917 * the Russian workers and
soldiers overthrew the Provisional Government. The power
passed into the hands of the Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’, and
Soldiers’ Deputies. The first step of the new government was
the offer of peace to all the belligerent countries. The Soviet
Government in Russia was the first government which proposed
to put an end to the World War. Russia was the first country
which ended the war. This became possible because the Rus-
sian workers and peasants who were longing for the end of the
war, took the power into their own hands, because the Russian
soldiers who were longing for the end of the war had turned
their arms against the enemy in their own country, against the
landlords and the capitalists.

The working and peasant youth of Russia took an active
part in the Revolution of‘ November 7. It helped the Soviet
Government to defend the conquests of the revolution against
the foreign imperialists and the armed forces of the Russian reac- _

Vtion, who wished to re-establish tsarism in Russia. During the

imperialist war the youth was loath to ﬁght and wanted’ peace.
[But during the revolution and the civil war against the bour-
geois landlords, counter-revolution, and foreign imperialists, the
best forces of the working youth of Russia joined the Red Army
and fearlessly fought on all the fronts because the youth was

58 THE YOUTH IN. THE WORLD WAR

against the re-establishment of tsarism, against the re-establish-
ment of the old servitude, against new imperialist wars.

Now, twenty years after the World War, the youth of the
Soviet Union is the only youth in the world which knows not
the scourge of unemployment, which is free to choose any pro-
fession it likes and before which the road is open to learning and
knowledge and to any independent organizing or creative work.
On the day of the twentieth anniversary of the World War, the
Soviet generation which this year turned twenty——the young
worker who, at one and the same time is studying and working
in the factory and will soon become an engineer; theyoung girl
in the collective farm who drives a tractor and is creating for
herself a well-to-do and cultural life; the student who is prepar-
ing to take up a responsible post in the socialist national econ-
omy—all of them remembered with gratitude their older
brothers who in the Bolshevik underground, in the battles of the
October Revolution and at the fronts of the Civil War have, by
their heroic independent struggle, won for the Soviet. youth of
the present day a free and happy life.

THE FIGHT AGAINST WAR IS A FIGHT
FOR SOCIALISM

The description of the struggle of the youth against the im-
perialist war of 1914-18 which we have given above does not
olfer an exhaustive picture of what the youth did in order the
sooner to stop the imperialist slaughter and overthrow the power
of those who had engineered it. But even that little which we
give here shows how great was the work done by the generation
of the fathers and elder brothers of the present youth in the
struggles against the war.

During the first imperialist war the young anti-imperialists
were in the front ranks of the ﬁghters against the war. Through-
out the four years of the war they have worked indefatigably
without shunning the diﬂiculties of the underground, without
fear of prison or court-martial. And their work and struggle
was not in vain.

True, the movement of the toiling masses against the war
began rather late. Before the war many of the toilers believed
that it was sufficient for the Social-Democratic Parties and the
other organizations who called themselves friends of peace to
adopt good resolutions against the war and the work was done.
They never thought that these parties would immediately upon
the outbreak of war not only refuse to ﬁght against it, but even
go over to the side of their exploiters, the capitalists. But this
is exactly what happened. The imperialist war and the treachery
of Social-Democracy took the toilers and the working youth
unawares.

During the first world war the anti-war movement of the
youth did not assume suﬂiciently broad dimensions, since the

59

 

 

I;

6 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

not know what it means to march to death under the thunder
of guns, through smoke, surrounded by gases, in mud and rain,
without knowing what one is ﬁghting for, for what one has to
starve and die.

However, this generation which does not remember the
World War now learns by its own experience that the war has
brought the toilers neither bread nor work. Twenty years ago
the fathers of this generation-——the present veterans of war-
went to the front in the hope that this war, according to the
promises held out to them would secure a better future for
their country and a better life for their children. However, the
children of those warriors now learn by their own experience
what this promised better life really amounts to: the young
unemployed are denied unemployed benefit, the youths are
“voluntarily” ﬂocking to the labor camps, the wages of the
young workers are reduced, the‘ students of the schools and
universities have lost all hopes of ever applying their acquired
knowledge. T

The World War has brought tremendous proﬁts to the
capitalists. It has enriched the speculating shopkeepers, who,
taking advantage of the famine which had set in during the
war, sold foodstuffs at exorbitant prices. The war has enriched
the armament manufacturers who have not only made huge
proﬁts on the war orders of the governments, but have also
supplied the enemy with arms when it was proﬁtable to them.
In each country the war has enriched the capitalists at the ex-
pense of the starving toilers while the capitalists in the conquer-
ing countries enriched themselves besides at the expense of the
conquered nations. However, the war demanded tremendous
sacriﬁces from the workers, peasants, the toiling middle classes
of both the victors and vanquished countries. But those who
have borne these sacriﬁces in the belief that this ﬁrst World
War would be the last one, are terribly disillusioned. The
World War has not removed the causes which engender war,

 

 

    

60 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

youth which fought against the war represented an insigniﬁcant
minority even inside the Social-Democratic youth organizations.
The ﬁght against the imperialist war was hampered yet by the
fact that most of the young opponents of the war were not very
clear about the methods and aims of the ﬁght. Only the Rus-
sian Bolsheviks realized in good time that unless the proletariat
and all the toilets of the various countries stopped ﬁghting one
another and joined in a common struggle against the exploiters
the imperialist war and war in general could not be stopped in
the interests of the toilers. This meant that the imperialist war
had to he turned into a civil war.

The example of the Russian Bolsheviks, the example of the
great October Revolution which established the Soviet power
in Russia, gave a powerful impetus to the mass movement
of thetoilers in all the belligerent countries against the imperial-
ist war and capitalists in their own country. Thus, the October
Revolution decidedly hastened the end of the World War.

The October Revolution has laid the foundation upon which
the new Third International was created by Lenin with the help
of all the parties and groups which, during the war raised
the standard of revolutionary internationalism and began
the fight against the imperialist war. Out of the unions and
groups of the youth whose active work we described above grew
the Young Communist International. Thus, a leadership has
crystallized itself for the toilers in general and the youth in par-
ticular in their struggle against a new imperialist war.

In the coming new world war the young generation will un-
doubtedly again be in the front ranks of the ﬁghters against the
imperialist incendiaries who foment war. And then, the experi-
ence of the anti-militarist movement of the youth in the period
of 1914-18 will prove very useful.

The conditions of the struggle now will be_ different and
incomparably more diflicult. In the course of the past twenty
years the ruling classes have learned many a lesson. They have

  

 

 

  

FIGHT AGAINST WAR IS A FIGHT FOR SOCIALISM 61

adopted new methods in the struggle against the labor move-
ment, methods more cunning and more cruel. They are mak-
ing wide use of the methods of torture, murder, espionage and
provocation against the revolutionary workers. They have
learned to dupe the toilets with still greater cunning than they
did during the first world war. They are abolishing all the ele-
mentary rights of the toilets even now in peace time in the same
manner as they did during the World War. Fascism with all
its horrors is only the preparation of an imperialist rear for an
imperialist war. I

In its military preparations, the bourgeoisie, as heretofore, is
utilizing the active support of the Social-Democratic Parties and
the unions of the youth as well as their internationals, the Sec-
ond Intrenational and the Young Socialist International which,
in the case of a new war, will again use all their inﬂuence on the
toilers, young and adults, for the purpose of sending them to
the slaughter in defence of the bourgeois fatherland.

However, it is not only the bourgeoisie that has learned a
lesson in the course of the past twenty years. The workers,
peasants and employees, all the toilets and the exploited have
learned too. They now have great experience in illegal struggle
against fascism and they possess now what they lacked in 1914,
namely, Communist Parties, affiliated to the Comintern, as well
as Communist unions of youth affiliated to the Young Commu-
nist International, the successors to and the continuers of the
cause of Lenin and Liebknecht.

In many countries, the Communists and the young Com-
munists have even in these days given proof of their readiness
and ability to fight most heroically against the danger of a new
world war. By their work in the army, the Japanese Communists
have succeeded in, hampering the Japanese imperialists in their
annexationist operations in Manchuria and North China. The
French Communists and young Communists have fought and are

 

    
 

62 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

ﬁghting energetically against the war waged by French imperial-
ism in Morocco. By their anti-fascist struggle carried on un-
ceasingly in spite of the savage terror, the German Communist
Party and the Communist youth are creating serious diﬂiculties
for German fascism, which is preparing for war. However, the
strongest and most reliable bulwark of the toilers of the whole
world in their struggle against the imperialist war is the Soviet
Union, the tremendous powerful country which ﬁghts and never
will cease ﬁghting for the cause of peace, the country which by
its peace policy, up till now succeeded in delaying the beginning
of a new war. I

In the future world war two fronts will clash with one an-
other—the front of the imperialist fomenters of war, who more
or less openly have adopted fascist methods in relation to the
toilers and the front of the toilers who are opposed to imperialism
and imperialist wars, the front at the head of which is the Union
of the Soviet Socialist Republics with a population of 170,000,-
000. It is the duty of every toilet in the world resolutely, un-
equivocally and actively to join the international front of the
toilers who are opposed to the war. For this purpose one must
not wait until the new world war begins. One must ﬁght against
this war even before it has begun. This means that it is
necessary to expose the secret military preparations of the bour-
geoisie, to prevent the transport of arms into the countries where
an imperialist war is being carried on now. This means that it
is necessary to spread among the youth in the factories and mills,
at the employment agencies, in the universities and in the villages
and mainly in the barracks the true facts about the future war.
Such fearless everyday struggle means preparing for the trans-
formation of the imperialist war into a civil war, preparing for
the establishment of the power of the workers on the ruins of the
power of the bourgeoisie, preparing for the establishment of an
order where there will be no classes and no wars, namely, the
establishment of the socialist order.

but on the contrary, has intensiﬁed them. In 1934 the danger
of a new war is just as acute as it was in the first half of 1914.

The boundaries of the various countries are even now too
narrow for their capitalists who cannot find markets for their

manufacturers. The masses of both workers and peasants are

so poor, so ruined by capitalist exploitation, that they are un-
able to purchase the product of their own labor. The capital-
ists look for suitable foreign lands which they could txploit,
lands where they could obtain cheap raw material and sell their
commodities at a profit. Again they prepare for an armed
struggle in order once more to effect a repartition of the world
among themselves. They strive to extend their frontiers at the
expense of their neighbors. They make preparations for
settling their differences as to the division of China, the fron-
tiers of Germany, the fate of Austria, of the Saar district, and
of the South American countries, by the force of arms. They
would like to find a way out of the crisis by appropriating, if
possible, part of the huge territory of the Socialist Soviet Union.
They intend to get rid of the hungry army of unemployed by
means of war.

With these objects in view, the capitalists of all countries,
and in the first place, the fascist governments of Germany and
Japan, and along with them democratic England, subordinate
all their policies and their entire national economy to imperialist
annexationist aims. In every country they have fortiﬁed their
frontiers, have developed motor transport and aviation, have
built railways and macadamized roads, in order that at the
necessary moment, they may rapidly transport troops across
them. They direct the creative thoughts of the scientists not

_ to inventions which are useful to humanity, but to the perfec-

tion of the most cruel weapons of destruction. They force in-
ventors in the engineering line to think not of lightening human
labor with the help of machinery, but of mechanizing armies,
of improving the capacity and the range of guns. They compel

 

8 THE YOUTH IN THE WORLD WAR

I chemists to think not of how to utilize science for the beneﬁt

of industry, agriculture and public catering, but how to utilize

‘ poisonous gases in war and how to poison a whole city by the

means of one bomb. They compel bacteriologists to think not
of how to combat bacteria which cause disease, but how to
spread plague germs in the rear of the enemy during war.
Anticipating that in the future war all distinction between
front and rear, combatants and non-combatants, will be wiped
out, that a belligerent country will form one continuous front

" and that tremendous numbers of people will be involved in mili-

tary operations, the capitalists endeavor to give military train-
ing not only to men, but also to women, not only to adults, but
also to minors. They strive to divert the legitimate hatred of
the toilers for the exploiters and turn it into a senseless hatred
of one nation to another, of one race to another.. They try to
persuade the unemployed and the starving that the fascist dic-
tatorship and the imperialist war will give them work and bread.
In the papers, in the books, in theatres, in the cinemas, they
paint war in attractive colors and praise military bravery, but
hide from the toilers the horrors of the future war. They
strengthen the police, they create semi-military fascist detach-
ments, preparing a strong organization of violence which should
be ready to act upon the outbreak of war and suppress the strug-
gle of the masses against the war.

In a number of countries warfare has already begun. The
seizure of Manchuria and part of Northern China by Japan,
the campaign which the Chinese militarists, supported by the
biggest imperialist powers, conduct against the Chinese Soviet
Republic, the war which French imperialism wages in Morocco,

the war in South America——all these events signify the eve of a -

new world war.

The youth will play a great part in the new world war. In
all wars the bulk of the armies is made up of youth. Youths
will also have to take the place of the older workers, leaving

 

 

THE FRUITS OF “VICTORY” 9

for the front. That is why the German,,Italian and the other
fascists try to win the youth by ﬂattery and by lying promises;
they try to recruit the youth into the various fascist organiza-

tions. They believe that the youth, which upon leaving school

had to go straight to the labor exchanges, the youth which failed
to ﬁnd work, failed to ﬁnd an outlet for its energies, will readily
proceed to the war, prompted by a strong desire for action,
ﬁght and heroism. That is why the German, Italian and all
the fascists try to recruit the toiling youth ‘into the various fas-
cist organizations, which are busy preparing for war. Japanese
imperialism is compelling about a million and a half young
people below eighteen years of age to undergo military training
at a, forced pace. Polish imperialists compel school boys under
sixteen years to go through military training. The countries
which call themselves democratic are not behind the fascist
countries in the militarization of the youth. Recently, Petain,
the French war minister, addressing the young unemployed, en-
joined them to enroll voluntarily in the army. In all the labor
camps a couple of hours is devoted to military drill and reac-
tionary nationalist propaganda.

The bourgeoisie considers that the generation of young men
who had not experienced the horrors of the last war and have
no hopes of obtaining work in the present, who have no oppor-
tunies of taking up a profession and a place in life will allow
themselves to be duped by the fascist lies, williallow themselves
to be made use of in the interests of imperialist robbery.

This generation which has no recollection of the war, should,
therefore, on the twentieth anniversary of the World War take
to heart not only the effect of the war on the toilets, who al-.
lowed themselves to be driven to the front, but also the lessons
of the ﬁght for the termination of the war once it had broken
out, a ﬁght which was fought by the young workers and peasants
who, though realizing the full horror of the war, had proved
unable to prevent it in time.
