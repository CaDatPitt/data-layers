peace. The center of the forces which are operating to bring about war,
to accelerate its outbreak, is fascism. . . .” This idea has been repeated
and reinforced until it is now a Stalinist commonplace.

From these various premises, it follows, according to the Comintern
logic, that the struggle for the proletarian dictatorship and for social-
ism is in the present period deﬁnitely removed from the agenda. “The
situation is different today,” writes Manuilsky. “Today, the proletariat
in most capitalist countries are not confronted with the alternative of
bourgeois democracy or proletarian democracy; they are confronted
with the alternative of bourgeois democracy or fascism.” Dimitroff
ampliﬁes: “Our attitude towards bourgeois democracy is not the same
under all conditions. For instance, at the time of the October Revolu-
tion, the Russian Bolsheviks engaged in a life-and-death struggle against
all political parties which opposed the establishment of the proletarian-
dictatorship under the slogan of the defense of bourgeois democracy.
The Bolsheviks fought these parties because the banner of bourgeois
democracy had at that time become the standard around which all
counter-revolutionary forces mobilized to challenge the victory of the
proletariat. The situation is quite different in the capitalist countries at
present. Now the fascist counter-revolution is attacking bourgeois
democracy in an effort to establish a most barbaric regime of exploita-
tion and suppression of the toiling masses. Now the toiling masses in a
number of capitalist countries are faced with the necessity of making a
deﬁnite choice, and of making it today, not between proletarian dicta-
torship and bourgeois democracy, but between bourgeois democracy
and fascism.”

This, then, is the theoretical foundation which provides the justi-
fication for the policy and tactics of the Peoples’ Front. And, in point
of fact, the Peoples’ Front does follow legitimately enough from this
foundation. There is only one diﬂﬁcultyz the foundation itself is entirely
false.

By their deﬁnition of the nature of the present historical period, our
Comintern scholars have already implied the proper strategy for the
proletariat. The task of the proletariat is, quite ﬂatly, to defend bour-
geois democracy. And, in accomplishing this task, the proletariat must
aim to ally itself with all other social groups which are threatened by
the encroachments of fascism. These include, we have seen, the peasants,
the middle classes generally, and likewise the non-fascist or rather “anti-
fascist” sections of the bourgeoisie. All of these social groups, from
proletariat to “anti-fascist bourgeoisie,” can, it is claimed, unite in a
common program for the defense of bourgeois democracy against fas-
cism. “We must,” Dimitroif advises, “strive everywhere for a broad
anti-fascist people’s front of struggle against fascism.”

This, then,‘is what the Peoples’ Front is, as deﬁned and advocated by
its most authoritative sponsors: the broad union of these various social
classes and groups on the basis of a common program for the defense
of bourgeois democracy against fascism. ’

It is the avowed aim of such a Peoples’ Front not merely to carry
on the day-by-day struggle and agitation; but, when conditions are
favorable, to accept governmental power. “If we Communists are
asked,” says Dimitroff, “whether weadvocate the united front [and, as
is shown by the next sentence, the Peoples’ Front] only in the struggle
for partial demands, or whether we are prepared to share the responsi-
bility even when it will be a question of forming a government on the
basis of the united front then we say with a full sense of our responsi-
bility: Yes, we recognize that a situation may arise in which the forma-
tion of a government of the proletarian united front, or of the anti-
faseist people’: front, will become not only possible but necessary in the
interests of the proletariat. And .in that case we shall declare for the
formation of such a government without the slightest hesitation.”

What is such a Peoples’ Front movement and such a Peoples’ Front
government able to accomplish? Our teachers will once again provide
the answers.

(1) The Peoples’ Front can win the middle classes to the side of the
proletariat, can win even the actual organizations and parties of the
non-proletarian groups. Dimitroff: “In the mobilization of the toiling
masses for the struggle against fascism, the formation of a broad
people’s anti-fascist front on the basis of t/ye proletarian united front
is a particularly important task. The success of the entire struggle of
the proletariat is closely ‘connected with the establishment of a ﬁghting
alliance between the proletariat on the one hand and the toiling peas-
antry and the basic mass of the urban petty bourgeoisie constituting a
majority in the population of even industrially developed countries, on
the other. . . . In forming the anti-fascist people’s front, a correct
approach to those organizations and parties to which a considerable
number of the toiling peasantry and the mass of the urban petty bour-
geoisie belong is of great importance. In the capitalist countries the
majority of these parties and organizations, political as well as economic,
are still under the inﬂuence of the bourgeoisie and follow it. The social
composition of these parties and organizations, is heterogeneous-~ ~ v———-~———~*"*‘“
This makes it our duty to approach these organizations in different
ways, taking into consideration that not infrequently the bulk of the
membership does not know anything about the real political character
of its Ieadelblxip. Under certain conditions, we can and must bend our
efforts to the task of drawing these parties and organizations or certain
sections of them to the side of the anti-fascist people’s front, despite

.

their bourgeois leadership. Such, for instance, is today the situation in
France with the Radical Party. . . .”

(2) The Peoples’ Front can prevent war (the claims, we see, are by
no means modest). Dimitroff: “The extent to which this world-wide
front is realized and put into action will determine whether the fascist
and other imperialist war incendiaries will be able in the near future to
kindle a new imperialist war, or whether their ﬁendish hands will be
hacked oif by the ax of a powerful anti-war front.” Or Manuilsky:
“We now have greater opportunities for waging a successful struggle
against imxperialist wars than we had on the eve of 1914. . . . Today,
relying on the U.S.S.R., taking advantage of the antagonism among the
capitalist states, the world proletariat has the opportunity of creating a
broad people’s anti-war front, which should not only include other
classes, but also weak nations and peoples whose independence is menaced
by war.”

(3) The Peoples’ Front can stop fascism. Dimitroff: “Will the
movement of the united proletarian front and the anti-fascist people’s
front at the particular stage be in a position only to suppress or over-
throw fascism [Note: This is the minimum claim which Dimitroff
makes for it.—J. B.], without directly proceeding to abolish the dicta-
torship of the bourgeoisie?” Or Manuilsky: “By its experience [in set-
ting up the Peoples’ Front], the French proletariat enriched the whole
of the world working class movement and demonstrated to it that
timely action against fascism (unlike what happened in Austria and
Spain) can avert heavy sacriﬁces and the bitterness of defeat.” Or from
our own Earl Browder, in his pamphlet, T/ae Peoples’ Front in America:
“There is a tremendous need for the united front of progressives [i.e.,
the Peoples’ Front] which can awake the country to the danger of
fascism, and organize the country to defeat this danger.” ‘

(4) Lastly, the Peoples’ Front government can provide a transi-
tional step to the proletarian dictatorship. Manuilsky sums up what he
pretends to be the differences between the “old-fashioned” type of
Social-Democratic coalition government and the new-fashioned Peo-
ples’ Front government, as follows: “One government [the Social-
Democratic coalition] paved the way for the fascist dictatorship; the
other government [of the Peoples’ Front] must pave the way for the
victory of the working class.”

Analysis of the Theory of the Peoples’ Front
1

IT would be a great mistake to imagine that the Peoples’ Front is a new
policy. It is, it is true, a new slogan; but, in actual content, it is simply
an old policy in a new disguise, an old strategy dressed up for the
new occasion.

The words of its defenders make entirely clear what the real content
of the policy of the Peoples’ Front is; and it is, therefore, not necessary
to give elaborate external proof. The Peoples’ Front is merely a
re-wording of the theories and practises of class collaboration and
coalition government, as these have been advocated by reformists since
the beginning of the modern labor movement. Class collaboration is
what the Peoples’ Front speciﬁcally proposes: the union of organizations
and parties representing various classes and sections of classes on the
basis of a common program to defend bourgeois democracy. A Peoples’
Front government means, as deﬁned by Dimitroff and Manuilsky, the
assumption of governmental responsibility in a capitalist state by the
coalition of these organizations and parties.

It is not proﬁtable to argue about words. There are many honest
supporters of the Peoples’ Front who will dislike and try to reject the
realization that it is identical with class collaboration and coalition
government. This is because they have previously been trained in an
attitude of hositility toward class collaboration and coalition govern-
ment as betrayals of Marxism. Indeed, this training is one of the
reasons why the Comintern invented the new. Phrase, “Peoples’ Front,”
thereby hoping to make the policy acceptable to those who would have
been suspicious of the old phrases. However, if we examine the actual
content, there can be no dispute. The Peoples’ Front proposes, quite
openly" and explicitly, the collaboration of classes and a coalition form
of government. Naturally it does so in the name of the proletariat, on
the alleged grounds that this strategy will under present conditions best
serve the interests of the proletariat. But reformism has always tried to

11

 

  

justify itself on such grounds——otherwise the proletariat would not be
inﬂuenced by it.-

A_ striking indication of the fundamental identity between the
Peoples’ Front and the traditional policies of class collaboration and
coalition government is provided by the ease with which reformists and
liberals in every country (who have always stood for these latter policies
and stand for them today) have gone over to the slogans of the
Peoples’ Front. They have done so because they have recognized that in
the Peoples’ Front, Stalinism—for its own reasons——has gone over to
their own policies, that is, to reformism. And, of course, they welcome
this; though they are still shy of the Comintern, fearing that Stalin
offers his reformist gifts only for the chance to swallow them up.

It is necessary to make a sharp distinction between the Peoples’
Front and the United Front. The Stalinist spokesmen are anxious to
lump the two together, and to claim that the Peoples’ Front is nothing
more than the logical extension of the United Front “to a higher plane.”
Similarly, they attempt to confuse the workers by trying to make it
appear that revolutionary socialists, in their consistent opposition to the
Peoples’ Front, are attacking the United Front. Nothing could be
further from the truth.

Revolutionary socialists have consistently stood for, and fought for,
the united front, and continue to do so. Indeed, during the years of
Hitler’s rise to power, one of the chief criticisms levelled against the
Comintern by the revolutionary Marxists was that by failing to adopt
a united front tactic in Germany, the Comintern guaranteed the victory
of Hitler. For this criticism, at that time, the Comintern branded the
Marxists as capitulators to the Social-Democracy, and as social-fascists.
The most elaborate defense ever made of the united front is to be found
in the pamphlets written about Germany during that time by Trotsky.

The united front, however, has nothing at all in common with the
Peoples’ Front. The united front consists in an agreement reached
between two or more parties and organizations, which have diﬁerent
programs, for joint action on speciﬁc issues. In this agreement there is
absolutely no question of a common political program. Each organiza-
tion retains intact its entire program; retains the right to put it for-
ward; retains the right to criticize the other organizations in the
united front agreement, either in general, or for failure to carry out
properly the united front agreement. Thus, in the united front each
organization guards its full independence; while at the same time the

12

 

  

Widest possible unity can be achieved for carrying through some action
accepted as desirable by all of the constituent organizations of the
united front. -

The united front is possible because various organizations differing
in complete program or in ﬁnal social aim may nevertheless all be in
favor of some speciﬁc action or set of actions. For example, united
fronts are readily possible on such issues as defense cases, support of a
strike, resistance to attack on civil liberties and other democratic rights,
breaking of injunctions, holding of demonstrations, etc. At more
advanced stages of social crisis, they must be formed on such issues as
the building of a workers’ militia, defense against fascist gangs, the
founding of workers’ and peasants’ and soldiers’ committees. The united
front on such issues is in fact not merely possible but .indispensable for
successful struggle. Through it the widest possible forces are organized;
and at the same time the masses are given a chance to compare in action
the worth and dependability of the ideas and methods of the various
organizations and parties which strive for their allegiance.

Revolutionary socialists do not merely accept the united front pas-
sively. They are the most active and the only‘ consistent advocates of
the united front; whereas reformists always resist the united front and
must be forced into it—just as the Stalinists now, in basing their policy
on’ the reformist Peoples’ Front, resist and ﬁght against the genuine
united front of action. How could it be otherwise? The ideas and
principles of the revolutionary Marxists represent the historical interests
of the proletariat. Consequently, any joint struggle byspeciﬁc actions
to the advantage of the proletariat will be welcomed by the Marxists;
and the broader the basis, the better. At the same time the Marxists are
anxious to have an ever broader mass arena for the presentation of their
own ideas" and a demonstration of their own methods, conﬁdent that a
true understanding of them will turn the masses away from the
reformists toward the revolutionists.

The Peoples’ Front, on the other hand, is not merely, not even pri-
marily, an agreement for joint action on speciﬁc issues. It ﬁrst and
foremost involves the acceptance by all members of the Peoples’ Front
of a common program. This difference is the key to the gulf which
separates the Peoples’ Front from the united front.

A What program? We have already seen the answer. The program of
the Peoples’ Front is a program for the defense of bourgeois democracy:
that is, for the defense of one form of capitalism.

Whose program is this? It is obviously not the program of the
proletariat. The program of the proletariat, accepted by revolutionists
since the publication of the Communist Manifesto, can be summed up
in two slogans: for workers’ power and for socialism. Naturally the

13

   

 

 

 

immediate tactic of the proletariat is not on all occasions the struggle
for state power: that is possible only in a revolutionary crisis. But at
all times and on all occasions the fundamental program remains the
same—for the overthrow of capitalism, for workers’ power and for
socialism. This program expresses the basic class conﬂict in modern
society; records the Marxist understanding that the problems of society
can be solved only by socialism, and that socialism can be achieved
only through the conquest of power by the proletariat. The duty of the
revolutionary party, the conscious vanguard of the proletariat, is to keep
this full and fundamental program always to the fore and always
uncompromised. In its program, the revolutionary party thus sums up
the independence of the proletariat as a class, and asserts its independent
historical destiny.

For the proletariat, through its parties, to give up its own inde-
pendent program means to give up its independent functioning as a
class. And this is precisely the meaning of the Peoples’ Front. In the
Peoples’ Front the proletariat renounces its class independence, gives up
its class aims—the only aims, as Marxism teaches, which can serve its
interests. By accepting the program of the Peoples’ Front, it thereby
accepts the aims of- another section of society; it accepts the aim of the
defense of capitalism when all history demonstrates that the interests of
the proletariat can be served only by the overthrow of capitalism. It
subordinates itself to a middle-class version of how best and most com-
fortably to preserve the capitalist order. The Peoples’ Front is thus
thoroughly and irrevocably non-proletarian, anti-proletarian.

By its very nature, the Peoples’ Front must be so. The establishment
of the Peoples’ Front, by deﬁnition, requires agreement on a common
program between the working-class - parties and non-Working-class
parties. But the non—proletarian parties cannot agree to the proletarian
program——the program of revolutionary socialism——without ceasing to
be what they are, without becoming themselves revolutionary workers’
parties. But if that should happen, then there would be no basis left
for a Peoples’ Front: there would be only revolutionary proletarian
unity. Consequently, the Peoples’ Front must always be an abandon-
ment of the proletarian program, a subordination of the proletariat to
non-proletarian social interests. In the Peoples’ Front, it is the pro-
letariat and the proletariat alone that loses. Earl Browder, in his report
to his Central Committee on December 4th, 1936, summed up the
whole matter: “We can organize and rouse them [the majority of “the
people”] provided We do not demand of them that they agree with our
socialist program, but unite with them on the basis of their program
which we make also our own.” [My italics.—J. B.]

14

 

 

The attempt of the Comintern apologists to ﬁnd a theoretical
foundation which will justify the Peoples’ Front compels them to make
a completely anti-Marxist analysis of the present historical situation.
They must corrupt Marxism with respect to every single important
issue:' bourgeois democracy; fascism; war; the problem and task of
the proletariat.

Let us summarize brieﬂy the analysis which Marxists make of the
present period, so that itgmay be compared with the Dimitroff-Manuil-
sky analysis outlined in the preceding chapter:

Marxism always approaches every social, political, and historical
question from the point of view of the class struggle. The basic con-
ﬂict in modern society—capitalist society—is, according to Marxism,
the conﬂict and struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
This conﬂict must continue, and progressively deepen, until capitalism,
on a world scale, is overthrown, and the bourgeoisie defeated, and
liquidated as a class. Only the two basic classes of- modern society—the
bourgeoisie and the proletariat——are capable of independent historical
action, and thus of formulating independent social and political pro-
grams. Reduced to simplest terms, the program of the bourgeoisie is
the defense of the capitalist order; the program of the proletariat, its
overthrow. The intermediary classes, however they may try to escape
it, always in actuality support one side or another in the basic conﬂict.

In the light of these elementary first principles of Marxism, the
Comintern division of the world into “war makers” and “peace lovers,”
its statement that the two great hostile camps are “democracy” and
“fascism,” its contention that the issue is “between democracy and
fascism,” are seen to have nothing in common with Marxism. Its propa-
gation of a program for the defense of capitalist democracy represents
merely the extension of one type of bourgeois ideology into the ranks
of the working class. V

Capitalism, Marxism teaches, went through a great progressive
phase. It was the bourgeoisie, the builders of capitalist society, who
broke through the fetters of feudal society, who developed modern
science and technic, who completely revolutionized industry and com-
munication, who laid the material basis for the adequate fulﬁllment of
human needs. During its progressive phase, capitalism was marked by
terrible and devastating conﬂicts, and by the periodic ravages of the
business crises. But after each crisis, capitalism rose stronger than ©V¢1_',
and went to new heights.

1

15

 

   

 

Now, however, capitalism, in the advanced period of imperialism,
has entered the phase of its general decline as a world system. It is
strangling itself. The very factors which once made it a progressive
force now act as a brake and obstacle to its further progress. The cap-
italist system can no longer handle the things which it has itself created.
And, as a consequence, the conﬂicts and crises redouble in intensity.
After each periodic crisis, capitalism rises weaker, not stronger. Per-
manent unemployment, insecurity, hunger, mass discontent progres-
sively grow. Great social upheavals multiply and increase in scope and
intensity. Wars and revolutions, on an unprecedented scale, become
the general rule instead of the exception, quieting down only long
enough to prepare for new world-wide outbreaks. _

In the face of this perspective, in the general decline of the capi-
talist order, the proletarian revolution on a world scale, the building
of socialism, presents itself as the only solution. Nothing else whatever
can alter the perspective, nothing else can halt the progressive degenera-
tion if not the utter destruction of civilization.

Bourgeois democracy, Marxism teaches further, is a form of capi-
talism, one of the political forms through which the dictatorship of the
bourgeoisie over the proletariat is exercised. It is, in a sense, the “normal”
form of bourgeois dictatorship during the progressive phase of capi-
talism. But Marxism is as unalterably opposed to bourgeois democracy

 

as to any other form of capitalist rule; it is opposed because it is opposed '

in general to capitalism and to bourgeois rule, and aims at the overthrow
of capitalism and the defeat of the bourgeoisie.

During the decline of capitalism, the bourgeoisie ﬁnds greater and
greater diﬂiculty in keeping the deepening social conﬂicts within the
basic framework of democratic parliamentarism. Democracy becomes
too awkward, too clumsy, slow, ineﬂicient, unreliable, as a mechanism
for class rule. Consequently, manipulating middle-class discontent
through a demagogic pseudo-radicalism, the bourgeoisie is compelled to
resort to the iron strait—jacket of fascism to insure its continuance in
power. Fascism, that is to say, is not a conspiracy or plot on the part
of anybody. It is nothing accidental; nothing that results from any
peculiar ill-will or viciousness. Fascism, or a fascist type of govern-
ment, is, on the contrary, a wholly normal development: the normal
(though not necessarily universal) mechanism for capitalist rule as
the decline and disintegration of the capitalist order deepens, just as
bourgeois democracy, parliamentarism, is the normal (though not neces-
sarily universal) mechanism during the progressive phase of capitalism.

It may thus be seen that there is no basic social conﬂict between
bourgeois democracy and fascism. If we examine social questions his-
torically, as Marxism does, we ﬁnd in a sense the contrary: fascism is

16

 

the resultant of bourgeois democracy in the period of capitalist decline;
bourgeois democracy is the precursor of and the preparation for fascism.

A similar analysis applies in the question of war. War, imperialist
war, is caused by the basic conﬂicts of capitalist society, by the struggle
to which every capitalist power is forced for cheap raw materials, addi-
tional markets, opportunities for the export of capital. These causes
operate within democratic capitalist nations as fully as in fascist
nations. Fascism, though it may be a stimulus to war, is not at all the
cause of war; war and fascism are both the results of capitalism. War,
or the approach of war, may, on the other hand, be an immediate stimu-
lus, to fascism: since a nation faced by war, or the prospect of war, may
well require the totalitarian state in order to prosecute the war
successfully.

It follows with full certainty that fascism and war can be defeated
only by the overthrow of capitalism. The attempt of the Peoples’ Front
to preserve bourgeois democracy, any attempt to base a strategy on such
a conception, is not merely helpless in the struggle against war and
fascism. It makes both inevitable.

History and the Peoples’ Front

WE have seen that the Peoples’ Front is in content equivalent to class
collaboration and coalition government. Consequently, the lessons of
history with respect to class collaboration and coalition government
apply with full force to the Peoples’ Front. It is not my intention to
examine these lessons in detail; but some brief reference is necessary.
The policies of class collaboration are based upon the assumption
that socialism can be achieved by peaceful and orderly evolution within
the framework of capitalist society. By education and organization, it
is argued, a majority of the people can be won to the side of socialism;
and a socialist society can then be introduced by the ballot. The War of
191-7, the Russian Revolution, and the triumph of Hitler have proved
that assumption to be utterly and grotesquely false; but it has, neverthe-
less, dominated the reformist parties of the world from shortly after

 

the founding of the Second International, and still continues to guide

their actions.

The inﬂuence of class collaboration spread throughout the world
labor movement because it was over a comparatively long period of
time able to show certain concrete achievements. And it could do so,
so long as capitalism as a whole was still in its progressive phase. During
the last decades of the Nineteenth Century, and up to 1914 in this
century, capitalism was still a great expansive force. The trend of capi-
talist production, in spite of the recurrent business crises, was upward
to ever new heights. As a consequence, the bourgeoisie was in a position
to grant considerable concessions to the proletariat, for the sake of
avoiding an intensiﬁcation of the class struggle. Class collaboration
was a method of bargaining for these concessions. And through it, the
reformists were able to establish at least to some degree such beneﬁts for
certain strata of the workers (the “labor aristocracy”) as social insur-

18

 

ance, cheap municipal housing, recreation centers, etc.; and to concen-
trate on “good government” campaigns which eliminated the grosser
forms of governmental corruption. ‘

However, in actuality, these concessions were simply bribes paid by
the bourgeoisie through the reformist working class leaders in return
for a renunciation of the revolutionary class struggle for workers’
power. These bribes were accepted at the expense of the independence
of the proletariat; and it could not have been otherwise. The policy of
class collaboration made the workers dependent, not on their own inde-
pendent class strength, but on the bourgeoisie; tied them to the bour-
geoisie through the bourgeois state. The reformist leaders became,
and could not help becoming, agents of the bourgeoisie within the
working class.

The results became openly apparent in 1914. At the outbreak of

the War, the reformists were confronted with the choice: 'for or against

the imperialist war; proletarian internationalism or social—patriotism.
And since their whole past policy had bound them within each country
to “their own” bourgeoisie, the reformists went over to the side of the
war, and led the masses to slaughter.

The same process went on during the post-war boom in the 1920’s;
and led, and could not help leading, to capitulation before Hitler as
soon as the ruling class decided that the time for fascism had arrived.

Thus class collaboration has always been anti-revolutionary, anti-
Marxist. But now, with the world decline of capitalism as a system,
even the feeble excuse that once was made for it no longer holds.
Capitalist production is no longer expanding, but is progressively drying
up. The bourgeoisie is no longer in a position to make major concessions
to the masses. In order to maintain capitalism and the domination of
the bourgeoisie, the concessions and the “privileges” must be one by one
withdrawn; real wages must be lowered; social beneﬁts cut off. And the
methods of class collaboration are no longer capable even of obtaining
the petty bribes. Even immediate demands and elementary rights can
be won and defended by the workers only by the methods of militant
and sharp class struggle. The advance of fascism,» the opening up of a
new series of wars and revolutions, have shattered the last remaining
“justiﬁcation” for the structure of class collaboration.

Coalition government is simply the general policy of class collabora-
tion carried into the parliamentary and governmental sphere. By enter-
ing into a coalition government, or equally by accepting oﬂice under

19

 

D)

capitalism as a “labor government, the proletarian parties undertake
to administer the bourgeois state. That is, they become the political
executives for capitalism. There is no way to avoid this; and the inten-
tions and wishes—however sincere——of the reformist leaders have noth-
ing to do with the political reality. The state, the governmental
mechanism, is, according to Marxism, the chief executive committee
for the dominant class in society; its function is to ensure the rule of
the dominant class, and to uphold the basic social relations upon which
that rule is based. At certain times this function cannot be carried out
when an openly bourgeois party is in oﬂice; the masses may have lost
conﬁdence in the bourgeois parties, and be ready to rise in revolt against
a government administered by them. The bourgeoisie then permits the
working-class parties to enter the government to forestall a revolu-
tionary assault on the capitalist state itself. The working class is thus
turned aside from its proper business of the struggle for power, and
deceived by its leaders into believing that the bourgeois state has become
its own government. The bourgeoisie allows its working-class agents to
do its business and maintain its rule.

The whole meaning of a coalition or “labor” government is clearly
described in a remarkable article which appeared in a private bulletin
of the Union of German Industry (the organization of the big German
industrialists) during the Autumn of 1932, six months before the
German bourgeoisie placed Hitler in power. This article discusses the
problem of whether the time has come for Nazism to be allowed to
take over the business of administering German capitalism. I give the
quotation (which I take from The Brown Book of tbe Hitler Terror)
at some length not merely because of its clariﬁcation of the present
point, but because of its further bearing on thewhole problem of the
nature and meaning of fascism:

“The problem of consolidating the capitalist regime in post-war
Germany is governed by the fact that the leading section, that is, the
capitalists controlling industry, has become too small to maintain its
rule alone. Unless recourse is to be had to the extremely dangerous
weapon of purely military force, it is necessary for it to link itself with
sections which do not belong to it from a social standpoint, but which
can render it the essential service of anchoring its rule among the
people, and thereby becoming its special or last defender. This last or
‘outermost’ defender of bourgeois rule, in the ﬁrst period after the war,
was Social Democracy.

“National Socialism has to succeed Social Democracy in providing
a mass support for capitalist rule in Germany. . . . Social Democracy
had a special‘ qualification for this task, which up to the present
National Socialism lacks. . . . Thanks to its character as the original

29

 

 

 

party of the workers, Social Democracy, in addition to its purely politi-
cal force, also had the much more valuable and permanent advantage
of control over organized labor, and by paralyzing its revolutionary
energies chained it ﬁrmly to the capitalist State. . . .

“In the first period of re—consolidation of the capitalist regime after
the war, the working class was divided by the wages, victories and
social-political measures through which the Social Democrats canalized
the revolutionary movement. . . . The deflection of the revolution into
social-political measures corresponded with the transference of the
struggle from the factories and the streets into Parliament and Cabinets,
that is, with the transformation of the struggle ‘from below’ into
concessions ‘from above.’

“From then onwards, therefore, the Social Democratic and trade
union bureaucracy, and with them also the section of the workers
whom they led, were closely tied to the capitalist State and participation
in its administration—at least so long as there was anything left of
their post—war victories to defend by these means, and so long as the
workers followed their leadership.

“This analysis leads to four important conclusions:

“1. The policy of ‘the lesser evil’ is not merely tactical, it is the
political essence of Social Democracy.

“2. The cords which bind the trade union bureaucracy to the State
method ‘from above’ are more compelling than those which bind them
to Marxism, and therefore to Social Democracy; and this holds in rela-
tion to the bourgeois State which wants to draw in this bureaucracy.

“3. The links between the trade union bureaucracy and Social
Democracy stand or fall, from a political standpoint, with parlia-
mentarism.

"4. The possibility of a Liberal social policy for monopoly capi-,

talism is conditioned by the existence of an automatic mechanism for
the creation of divisions in the working class. A capitalist regime which
adopts a Liberal social policy must not only be entirely parliamentary,
it must also be based on Social Democracy and must allow Social Democ-
racy to have sufficient gains to record; a capitalist regime which puts
an end to these gains must also sacriﬁce parliamentarism and Social
Democracy, must create a substitute for Social Democracy and pass
over to a social policy of constraint.

“The process of this transition, in which we are at the moment,
for the reason that the economic crisis has perforce blotted out the
gains referred to, has to pass through the acutely dangerous stage, when,
with the wiping out of these gains, the mechanism for the creation of
divisions in the working class which depended on them also ceases to
function, the working class moves in the direction of Communism,

21

 

and the capitalist rule approaches the emergency stage of military
dictatorship. . . . The only safeguard from this acute stage is if the
division and holding back of the working class, which the former
mechanism can no longer adequately maintain, is carried out by other
and more direct methods. In this lie the positive opportunities and
tasks of National Socialism. . . .

"If National Socialism succeeds in bringing the trade unions into
a social policy of constraint, as Social Democracy formerly succeeded
in bringing them into a Liberal policy, then National Socialism would
become the bearer of one of the functions essential to the future of
capitalist rule, and must necessarily ﬁnd its place in the State and
social system. The danger of a State capitalist or even socialistic devel-
opment, which is often urged against such an incorporation of the
trade unions under National Socialist leadership, will in fact be avoided
precisely by these means. . . . There is no third course between a
re-consolidation of capitalist rule and the Communist revolution.”

There is no avoiding the harsh logic of history. When the workers’
parties enter a coalition government, or form a labor government on
the basis of the bourgeois state, they thereby necessarily become the
administrators of capitalism. And they must, therefore, act to maintain
and uphold capitalism. In peaceful times, they do this as described in
the quotation, by canalizing the energies of the workers into peaceful
paths which do not threaten the overthrow of the capitalist order. In
this way, the coalition and labor governments of the Scandinavian
countries have functioned. Similarly in the case of the two Labor
Party governments formed in Great Britain: neither was able to take a
single step toward socialism; they had to carry out the mandate of
British ﬁnance-capital, even to the extent of upholding the extreme
Tory policy in connection with India. It is interesting to recall a
comment of one of the Comintern theoreticians writing in the days
just preceding the Peoples’ Front era:

“When the Labor Party first took over the administration of the
affairs of British imperialism, the MacDonald ‘Labor’ government
allowed the laws passed by the Conservatives and directed against the
miners to remain in force; it also set the seal of its whole authority to
the law providing for the lengthening of hours in the mines. When, for
the second time, it became the administrator of the British bourgeoisie,
it at once understood the latter’s program in the matter of ‘a standard
of life for the workers of Great Britain worthy of human beings’ in the
same way as German Social Democracy understood the program of its
own bourgeoisie in regard to this; it promoted capitalist rationalization
at the expense of the workers with all its might; through its peace-
makers it permitted the miserable wages of the whole of the textile

22

 

 

 

 

?=§;9

workers to be cut in the interest of making the textile industry capable
of competition; by rapid rationalization it increased unemployment to
an unprecedented extent, and prepared the wage cuts of the sailors and
the civil‘servants, as well as a reduction in the unemployed dole.” (Bela
Kun, The Second Internation in Dissolution.)

But in times of crisis, much more than this must be done. The
coalition or labor government, as the administrator of capitalism, must
defend capitalism if capitalism is attacked. Consequently, it must uphold
the imperialist war policy of the bourgeoisie. And, against the threat of
proletarian revolution, which would overthrow capitalism, it must take
steps to smash the revolution. This is precisely what happens. We
discover, for example, in the post-war revolutions in Germany and
Austria, that it is the Social Democratic parliamentarians who shoot
down the revolutionary workers. Quite literally shoot them down, as
the blood of Luxemburg and Liebknecht so unanswerably testiﬁes.

The reason why a coalition or labor government can never serve the
interests of the proletariat, and must always serve the interests of the
bourgeoisie, is, from the poirit of view of Marxism, easy enough to
understand. The bourgeois state, its entire apparatus and mechanism,
exists to enforce the rule of the bourgeoisie; and arose historically, out
of the ruins of feudal society, for just that purpose. Consequently,
being designed solely to uphold capitalist property relations and the
domination of the bourgeoisie, the workers can enforce their power
politically and achieve socialism, only through smashing the bourgeois
state in its entirety, and building another type of state, a state based
on different historical and social roots. The proletarian state, since the
Russian Revolution, has been known as a Soviet State: that is, a state
based on democratically elected soviets or councils or committees of the
workers and peasants. Exactly what form these will take in any given
country cannot be predicted with certainty beforehand. But it can be
stated with complete assurance that only such a political structure,
involving the complete overthrow of the bourgeois state machinery,
can uphold and enforce the power of the workers.

The classic proofs of the impossibility of the utilization by the
workers of the bourgeois state are to be found in the analyses of the
Paris Commune by Marx and Engels, and in Lenin’s State and Revolu-
tion; The latter work, read today, seems very much like a contemporary
polemic against the entire Peoples’ Front policy.

Lenin quotes Marx and Engels: “One thing especially was proved
by the Commune, 1/iz., that the ‘working class cannot simply lay hold
of the reaa'y-made state machinery and wield it for its own pnrposes’.”
Lenin continues: “Marx’s idea is that the working class must break up,
shatter the ‘ready-made state machinery,’ and not conﬁne itself merely

23

 

to taking possession of it.” And Lenin - goes on to outline the kind of
state which will replace the “ready-made state machinery.” Lenin’s
whole attack on Kautsky, which occupies a decisive section of this
pamphlet, is focused on Kautsky’s admission of the possibility of the
utilization of the bourgeois state for the beneﬁt of the workers and to
achieve workers’ power. “Kautsky may enjoy the pleasant company of
the Legiens, Davids, Plekhanovs, Potresovs, Tseretelis and Chernovs,
who are quite willing to work for the ‘shifting of the relation of forces
within the state,’ for ‘gaining a majority in parliament, and the con-
version of parliament into the master of the government.’ A most
worthy object, wholly acceptable to the opportunists, in which every-
thing remains within the framework of a bourgeois parliamentary
republic. We shall go forward to a break with the opportunists; and
the whole of the class-conscious proletariat will be with us—not for a
‘shifting of the relation of forces,’ but for the overthrow 07‘ the bour-
geosie, the destruction of bourgeois parliamentarism, for a democratic
republic after the type of the [Paris] Commune, or a republic of
Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, the revolutionary dictator-
I ship of the proletariat.” And he concludes his broadside against the
' reformists of the Second International: “Far from inculcating into the
 workers’ minds the idea that the time is near when they are to rise up
‘ and smash the old state machinery and substitute for it a new one,
thereby making their political domination the foundation for a Socialist
reconstruction of society, they have actually taught the workers the
direct opposite of this, and represented the ‘conquest of power’ in a
way that left thousands of loopholes for opportunism.”

The crucial historical example of a Peoples’ Front government, up
until the recent past, was none other than the Provisional Government
of Kerensky in Russia in 1917. Kerensky’s government in every respect
u conformed to the definition of a genuine Peoples’ Front government.
 In it were to be found all of the parties of the workers and peasants,
 with the exception, of course, of the Bolshevik Party. It was a govern-
ii ment sworn to uphold democracy. And, in August, 1917, it_ was
attacked by the troops of Kornilov, the then equivalent of a fascist.
 Nevertheless, the policy of Lenin, the policy which led to the suc-
 cess of the first proletarian revolution, was never for one moment based
i‘ on political support of the Provisional Government. From the instant
 of his arrival in Russia, he fought against all those who in any way gave
W the Provisional Government such support (among whom, when Lenin

'1 . 24

 

arrived, was to be found Stalin). Lenin’s policy was based upon the
transfer of state power to the Soviets; and in the ﬁnal analysis this had
to be accomplished not through, but directly against the Provisional
Government. The Provisional Government had to be smashed in order
that proletarian power could be achieved.

The decisive test of Lenin’s policy came in August, during the days
of Kornilov’s attempted counter-revolution. But, even though the
object of Kornilov’s attack seemed on the surface to be the Kerensky
regime, nevertheless Lenin maintained throughout his position of “non-
conﬁdence” in the Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks pursued an
in-dependent class policy in organizing to meet the immediate threat of
Kornilov, placed no reliance whatever on the government, and kept the
workers and troops under their inﬂuence from being subordinated to
the government and its policies. They did this because they knew that
the government would try to betray the workers and the revolution

(as indeed Kerensky did in fact try to do, in negotiating for an agree-,

ment with Kornilov), and that the progress of the revolution would
have to go on, after the defeat of Kornilov, to the overthrow of the
government and the transfer of power to the Soviets. “It is no wonder,”
writes Trotsky in his History, “that the masses led by the Bolsheviks in
ﬁghting against Kornilov did not place a moment of trust in Kerensky.
For them it was not a case of defending the government, but of defend-
ing the revolution. So much the more resolute and devoted was their
struggle. . . .” During their hours off duty the sailors came to the prison
for a visit with the imprisoned Kronstadters, and with Trotsky, Raskol-

nikov and others. “Isn’t it time to arrest the government?” asked the

visitors. “No, not yet,” was the answer. “Use Kerensky as a gun-rest to
shoot Kornilov. Afterward we will settle with Kerensky.” In June and
July these sailors had not been inclined to pay much attention to revo-
lutionary strategy, but they had learned much in a short two months.
They raised this question of the arrest of the government rather to test
themselves and clear their own consciences. They themselves were
beginning to grasp the inexorable consecutiveness of events. “In the first
half of July, beaten, condemned, slandered; at the end of August, the
trusted defenders of the Winter Palace [the seat: of the Provisional
Government] against Kornilovists; at the end of AOctober, they will be
shooting at the Winter Palace with the guns of the Aurora.”

How absolute a gulf between Lenin’s policy, and the policy of the
Stalinists and Socialists today in Spain—the gulf between revolutionary
Marxism and reformist betrayal!

IV

Can t.he Peoples’ Front Win the Middle Classes?

ONE of the chief arguments made in favor of the Peoples’ Front is that
through it there can be brought about an alliance between the working
class and the middle classes against the onslaught of extreme reaction,
of fascism. If this argument were true, it would be of great impor-
tance; and we must, therefore, examine it with care.

The middle classes consist of those social groups intermediary
between the two basic classes of modern society, the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat. Though it is diﬂicult to deﬁne exactly the boundaries of
the middle classes, they evidently include: peasants and small inde-
pendent farmers; shop-keepers and small business men; many types of
professional workers; independent artisans; artists and intellectuals;
minor executives; etc. These groups lead in capitalist society an
unstable and precarious existence, because of the ambiguity of their
relation to the means of production—they are not in the full sense
either workers or capitalists. They seek, naturally, their self-preserva-
tion, the defense and, if possible, the betterment of their economic for-
tunes. But the nature of their social position makes it impossible for
them to develop any independent program for the fulﬁllment of their
own interests. At bottom, there are only two programs for modern

society: capitalism, the program of the bourgeoisie; and socialism, the,

program of the proletariat. There is no third alternative.

Since they can have no independent program of their own, the
middle classes are forced to adopt, after their fashion, the social pro-
gram of one or another of the two basic classes. So long as capitalism
is progressive and relatively stable, the middle classes accept capitalism
without much question; and strive only to gain for themselves as large
a percentage as possible of the material beneﬁts of capitalism. But the
evolution of capitalism into its monopoly—imperialist phase, and the

26

 

 

recurrent crises, constantly undermine the economic foundations of the
middle classes. Shop keepers are forced down into employees of chain
stores; independent farmers become share-croppers or farm laborers;
various categories of professional workers are changed into wage
workers; artists and intellectuals are put to work for wages by the
government, big corporations, advertising agencies; the small business
men are driven out of business by the big trusts; taxes grow heavier.
The middle classes protest in their feeble and fruitless manner. They
call for anti-monopoly laws; beg for moritoria on farm loans; ask for
anti—chain store legislation; request protection for small enterprises;
look for a shift in taxes to other backs than their own. All their com-
plaints are of no avail whatever, since the inexorable development of
capitalism contains within itself the extension of monopoly and the
ever heavier crushing of the middle classes.

As the general crisis deepens, the discontent and turmoil in the
middle classes grows ever more turbulent. The middle classes toss back
and forth with increasing restlessness. Hare-brained ideas and theories,
fantastic groups and movements and parties, give expression to the
dreams and wishes and prejudices of the middle-class theoreticians. We
know dozens of them in this country: Utopia, Townsend, Huey Long,
back-to-the-land, Humanism, neo-feudalism, Union Party. . . . The
middle classes are seeking a way out of their impasse. But they have no
possible way out of their own. And at last they must, in whole or in
a division, face the ultimate choice: to line-up behind one of the two
basic classes and its program, to swing to the side of the bourgeoisie or
the proletariat.

The mere statement of the position of the middle classes in modern
society makes obvious the answer to the problem of “winning” them.
They are looking for a solution, for a “way out,” and they have none
of their own to offer. They grow gradually disgusted and despairing of
the pseudo-solutions proposed by their own ideologists. They are then
ready to turn sharply, and to follow that side which will give them
bold, decisive, vigorous leadership, which in ﬁrm accent will show them
a way out and a solution. How could it be otherwise? They themselves
are timid, frightened, hesitating; and they would not turn to a timid
and hesitating leadership as a substitute. They themselves have dis-
covered that bourgeois democracy has merely led them deeper and
deeper into the abyss, and they are searching for something to take its
place, not something to bolster it up again. They do not want a leader-
ship and a program which will pander to their own prejudices; they
have tasted the bitter fruits of these prejudices, and they look for a new
set of ideas, a new direction. The "alliance between the working class
and the middle classes” can be formed only if the working class holds

The New Betrayal

the leading position in that alliance, only if the alliance is founded on
the clear, frank, unafraid assertion of the proletarian program—for
workers’ power and for socialism. If, on the contrary, it is the bour-
geoisie or their agents that. give clear and uncompromising leadership,
while the working class hides its program and gives way to middle—class
prejudices, the middle classes are certain to go over to the side of the
bourgeoisie, to the side that demonstrates that it means business, that
it knows what it wants and is determined to go and get it.

These conclusions are confirmed time after time in every-day expe-
j rience. For example, nearly every big strike is an object lesson in the
E relation between the proletariat and the middle classes. The newspapers,
E as mouthpieces of the bourgeoisie, try always to make the strikers
‘ believe that if the conduct a militantl fou ht strike es eciall if
1 Y Y S 2 P Y
there is any violence, the “public” (i.e., the middle classes) will be"
I antagonized, and its sympathies alienated from the strike. The origin
of this “friendly” advice, repeated in every strike situation, should be
enough to make it suspect. And, in truth, exactly the contrary is What
normally happens. When the “public” is confronted with militant,
ﬁghting strikers, who make clear that they mean business and intend to
win, the public lines up with the strikers. And why not? The public
naturally wants to be on the winning side; when it sees the strikers
acting like winners, conscious of their own power, it draws appropriate
conclusions. Nor does violence, so long as it does not result in a com-
plete rout of the strike, change the picture in the least. It may offend
the moral feelings of the public; but when the middle classes see the
V. workers ready to defend their rights by force as well as by argument,
 this becomes an additional and compelling reason for the middle classes
to line up alongside them. After all, they do not want to see proletarian
violence turned against themselves. The 1934 strikes of the Toledo
Auto-Lite workers and the Minneapolis truck drivers—both fought
with uncompromising militancy—are admirable test cases for this
method of assuring at least sufficient support from the “public.”

It is when the strikers, under the inﬂuence of reformist leaders,
begin vacillating, backing down, avoiding struggle, that the public
turns its back on them andiswings to the other side. And once again,
how natural! When the public sees that the strikers are not sure of
themselves, do not know exactly what they want or how to get it, the
public concludes that it will be best for its own skin to line up With
the bosses—who make no bones about where they stand. The middle
classes love truth and justice, no doubt; but when it is a question of
their own pocketbooks and their own skins, they will always take care
to discover truth ‘and justice and what looks‘ to them like the
Winning side. I

Great social crises only conﬁrm the same lesson. Above all, the
experience of the Russian Revolution is decisive in teaching us how the
middle classes can be won. Who, indeed, won the middle classes (that
is, above all, the peasantry) in the Russian Revolution? Not at all the
Peoples’ Front parties of the Provisional Government. They——the Social
Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks—had the middle classes to begin
with; they formulated their policies and programs in accordance with
middle-class prejudices; and precisely for that reason, during the course

of 1917, they lost the middle classes. The peasants Went over, in their ’

overwhelming majority, to the Bolsheviks. They did so because the
Bolsheviks made clear that they meant business. The Bolsheviks did not
waste time on “the defense of bourgeois democracy” against the coun-
tter-revolution, or about middle-class fear of violence. From start to
ﬁnish, in sharp and uncompromising manner, the Bolsheviks put for-
ward the political program of the proletariat: for Soviet power and for
socialism. They showed the peasants that their needs—peace and land—
could be fulﬁlled only by adherence to the proletarian program and
proletarian leadership. And the middle classes decided that their best
bet was to come along under the banner of that program.

We are thus able to see that the Peoples’ Front conception is the
opposite of Marxism in its approach to the middle classes. Far from
winning the middle classes to the side of the workers, the Peoples’ Front
subordinates the workers to middle-class prejudices. It accepts a pro-
gram built out of middle-class illusions—illusions which the middle
classes themselves are beginning to discard, and accepts the leadership
of middle-class politicians. It gives up the independent class action of
the workers, through which alone the revolution can be won, in return
for—nothing at all. The temporary “alliance” superﬁcially achieved in
the Peoples’ Frontvcannot possibly hold together for any length of
time. The middle classes are looking for a way out; they are unable to
ﬁnd one of their own; the proletariat, by adopting the Peoples’ Front
policy, declines to offer them its socialist way out; and the middle
classes are left ripe for picking by the fascist demagogues. The fascists
are not modest or conciliatory in their approach, nor do they have any
qualms about violence. They shout for the “true revolution,” condemn
bourgeois democracy with contempt, preach a religion of blood and
iron and violence, announce openly their drive for power. However
false the doctrines of the fascists may be, the leadership they offer is

29

 

 

bold and decisive; and the middle classes will follow it unless the leader-
ship oﬂered by the proletariat is even more bold and more decisive.

Exactly this happened in Germany. It was the class collaborationist
policy of German Social Democracy (combined with the suicidal sec-
tarianism of the German Communist Party) which left the German
middle classes easy prey for Hitler. The Social Democracy called for
defense of the Weimar Republic exactly when the middle classes had
come to learn that they had nothing further to hope from the Weimar
Republic. Hitler called for “revolution”; and he was, in desperation,
believed and followed. Exactly this is now happening in France. The
despairing middle classes of France, their economic and social position
progressively undermined by the French bourgeois democracy—are
instructed by the Peoples’ Front to defend that democracy with their
; very lives. As a result, as they learn now that Blum’s government is
 just one more version of the same government that has failed them for
r so many decades, in increasing numbers they pass over to the camp of
the fascists. The fascists, at any rate, have a program and are not afraid
J to state it; they demand’ and promise a c/ozmge, a “revolution” even if
 they are not too clear as to just what kind it will be.

Marxism recognizes, and has always recognized, the crucial char-
acter of this problem of winning the middle classes——not the middle
1 classes as a whole, which is impossible, but the bulk of their lower strata.
J Indeed, Marxism declare that without the support of allies drawn from
non-proletarian social groups, as well as through the aid of anti-
imperialist colonial revolts, the working class cannot succeed and the
proletarian revolution is impossible. But Marxism insists that this alli-
ance can be formed only on the basis of the independent leadership of
the working class, only on the basis of the class struggle and the pro- J
letarian program for workers’ power and for socialism.

There is nothing hypocritical or dishonest about this conception.
What Marxism says in effect to the middle classes, or at any rate the
lower middle classes, is: you have grave and increasing problems in
modern society; you are unable to solve them through any independent
program of your own; they can be solved only through the proletarian
program, only through socialism. You want jobs, food, security.
Through a continuance of capitalism, in whatever form, you will have
}: less of all of them. Through the workers’ revolution and through

' |l socialism, all of these can be guaranteed, and your basic interests ful-

“ 30

 

ﬁlled to an ever increasing degree. These claims can be made, and must
be made, because they are true; and because they are the only founda-
tion on which the middle classes can be Won to the side of the
proletariat.

The Peoples’ Front is, on the other hand, completely false in all of
its claims. And the Marxist analysis shows that the Peoples’ Front, far
from being able to Win the middle classes", must necessarily lose them,
will simply turn over to fascism the.m_ass base which it requires.

31

V

Can the Peoples’ Front Stop Fascism?

WE have already seen, in general, the answer to this question. The
answer requires further ampliﬁcation. The Peoples’ Front cannot stop
fascism. The theory of the Peoples’ Front rests upon a false account of
the nature of fascism. It explains fascism as a plot by a small group
of extreme reactionaries, instead of as a normal development of capi-
talism in its period of decline, a development conditioned not by the
wills or wishes of any individuals or group of individuals (indeed,
ﬁnance-capital itself accepts fascism zmu/z'llz'ngly—it is a far more costly
and dangerous method of rule than parliamentarism) but by the inner
nature of capitalist society. Consequently, fascism can be stopped in
only one way: by the overthrow of capitalism. So long as capitalism
remains, the causes of fascism remain; and from the causes, the effect
will follow. But the Peoples’ Front gives up, explicitly, the struggle
for the overthrow of capitalism, and, therefore, cannot conceivably
stop fascism. ‘

The Peoples’ Front justifies its policy by stating that the funda-
mental issue at the present time is “Bourgeois democracy vs. Fascism.”
We have seen that there is no such issue, that the only issue is “Social-
ism vs. Capitalism.” Considered from a historical point of view—which
is invariably the view of Marxism—there is no fundamental social
opposition between bourgeois democracy and fascism. In the period of
capitalist decline, bourgeois democracy, one form of capitalist rule,
goes by a natural and necessary transition into fascism, another form of
capitalist rule. Bourgeois democracy prepares the ground for fascism;
fascism takes root, grows and matures, within the ground of bourgeois
democracy. No basic transfer of power is involved in the transition
from democracy to fascism; the same class continues to rule by other
means; fascism, in spite of its demagogic radical language, constitutes

32

 

 

   

no genuine social revolution. It is of the utmost signiﬁcance to remem-
ber that Hitler came to power in Germany within the framework of
t/ye Wcimar C0nstitutiow—the Constitution described by Social Democ-
racy as “the most democratic in the world.”

There is no moreibasic opposition between bourgeois democracy and
fascism than between middle age and old age. Old age is different,
certainly, from middle age; but one turns into the other by an unavoid-
able historical process. Unavoidable, except by one means: by death
. before old age is reached. The analogy is accurate: bourgeois democracy
i will give way to fascism—-unless bourgeois democracy is itself destroyed
’ by the proletarian revolution. The whole process is clearly described in

the long quotation given in Chapter III. When theruling class can no
longer maintain its power by “creating divisions within the working
class” through making concessions to the working class, it must aban-
don a liberal policy in favor of a “social policy of constraint” in order
to continue its rule. That is, it must pass from democratic rule to
fascist rule. It would be fortunate if working-class leaders thought and
wrote with even one-half the clear—eyed objectivity of this spokesman
for German ﬁnance-capital. ’

We have seen more than this: the Peoples’ Front is not merely
powerless to stop fascism. This policy, if unchecked, makes the victory
of fascism inevitable. It does so because it is based on the continuance
of capitalism; and if capitalism continues, fascism will conquer. It
does so, furthermore, because it turns the middle classes over to the
fascist demagogues.

....I:_

But,'it is ob'ected, is not bour eois-democrac , for all its failin s,

bourgeois democracy in contrast to fascism? After all, the working
class has at least some ri hts under ca italist democrac —some chance
8 P Y

i‘ to organize, agitate, defend itself. Whereas fascism destroys its organ-
 izations and all of its rights. ,
J This is, to many persons, perhaps the most persuasive of all argu- ;

ments in favor of the Peoples’ Front. And in this argument lies one of
the most dangerous and subtle of all the confusions through which the
proponents of the Peoples’ Front hope to be able to deceive the masses
into following their leadership.

The truth is simply this: the working class has no stake whatever
in bourgeois democracy, considered in the abstract, any more than in
any other form of capitalist dictatorship. Its stake is in proletaricm
democracy, in the socialist revolution. However, in the process of

33

-4 ~.-—-— -  
_.

 

 

achieving the socialist revolution, the Working class has a genuine inter-
est in—not bourgeois democracy—but concrete democratic rig/ots,
some of which exist under the regime of bourgeois democracy.

“Democracy,” as the word is used at the present time, has either
one or two entirely different meanings. In the first place, it is used to
refer to a particular form of state organization: the capitalist parlia-
mentary regime. As such, it stands for a speciﬁc social institution—the
bourgeois state. This institution is the executive arm of the ruling class,
whereby it exploits the masses, keeps them in check, and assures the
continuance of its own power and privilege. As such, it is in all respects
the enemy of the exploited class, of the proletariat. The central object
of the proletariat is to overthrow this institution, this state, and to
substitute for it a proletarian state, which will be the political arm of
proletarian power, and the instrument for the building of socialism. To
“defend democracy” in the sense of defending the capitalist state is
simply to defend the class enemy. Never, at any time, in this period of
the decline of capitalism, could this be a correct strategy for the
proletariat. .

In the second place, the word “democracy” is used to refer to
certain concrete “democratic” rights. These rights differ widely in
historical origin and social function, and the attitude of the proletariat
toward them must differ correspondingly. Let us divide them roughly
into three broad groups:

(1) The first group consists of those special “rights” which embody
and enforce bourgeois property relations. These include the right to
hold property in the basic means of production; the right to employ
wage labor; the right to monopolize for the sake of private proﬁt; the
right of individuals and private corporations to control the instruments
of propaganda——press and telephone and radio; the right to suppress
the products of science and invention in the interest of proﬁt; and many
similar “democratic rights.” Such rights as these it is the aim of the
proletariat to destroy, in exactly the same way that the bourgeoisie
itself destroyed the special feudal and slave-holding rights.

The bourgeois-democratic state, however, has as its primary func-
tion the defense and maintenance of just these “democratic” rights.
Thus the struggle against these rights is identical with the struggle
against the bourgeois state.

(2) There is a second group of democratic rights which, though
likewise having its historical origin in the struggle for power of the
bourgeoisie, has a different social status. These include many of the
so-called “civil liberties”: the rights of free speech, free assembly,
/aabeas corpus, petition, public secular education, etc. In bourgeois
society these rights are manipulated by the ruling class to its own ends.

34

 

 

 

For example, we discover that the campaign of the newspaper owners
against unionization of their employees proceeds under the slogan of
defense of free speech; or that the right of /oabeas corpus is used by
skilled lawyers to evade investigation and criminal punishment.

Nevertheless, the attitude of the proletariat toward this second
type of “democratic rights” is not one of simple and direct opposition,
as in the case of the first type. This follows for two reasons: ﬁrst,
because, in spite of their perversion by the bourgeoisie, these rights can
be used by the proletariat also in the defense of its own class interests
and in preparation for its own struggle for power. Free speech, though
its chief function in capitalist society is to permit a virtual monopoly
of propaganda by the owners of capital, can, nevertheless, be part of the
defense of a revolutionary and labor press. The defense of the right of
proletarian mass meetings can proceed at least partly under the form
of the defense of free assembly. The right of /aabeas corpus can be
useful as a legalistic weapon in the aid of class struggle prisoners. Sec-
ondly, the attitude of the proletariat toward this second group of rights
is different because part of the historical aim of the proletariat is, by
changing the social content of these rights and eliminating their class
bias, to deepen and extend them as part of the structure of the true
and genuine democracy of a classless society.

(3) There exists under capitalist democracy, to one or another
extent, a third group of rights which are not, properly speaking,
“democratic rights” at all, but rather proletarimz rights. These are such
rights as the rights to picket and to strike and to organize. The histori-
cal origin of these rights is in all cases to be found in the imz'epemle1zt
struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie
state. There is no need to stress the incalculable importance to the
proletariat of the maintenance of this third group of rights.

31- 3% 3’.-

We have seen, then, that it is to the interest of the working class
to defend unequivocally the third group of concrete rights; and to
defend the second group in so far as they aid the cause of the prole-
tariat. The problem is: How are these rights to be defended?

The propaganda of the Peoples’ Front systematically confuses the
two conceptions of “democracy” which we have distinguished: “democ-
racy” as meaning the bourgeois-democratic state; and “democracy” as
meaning certain concrete social rights. In this way, it attempts to get
the masses to believe that the defense of the concrete social rights is
necessarily bound up with the defense of the bourgeois-democratic
state. In this it should be noted that the Peoples’ Front is exactly on
a par with the liberal capitalist propaganda in this and every other

35

 

democratic country. This is the approach which the liberal press uses
to justify its “defense of democracy” against “dictatorship whether
of the Right or of the Left.” To this reactionary argument, the ideology
of the Peoples’ Front can find no convincing answer.

The truth is the opposite of what the liberals and the Peoples’ Front
theorists assert. The truth is that the defense of the concrete rights is
not merely, not bound up with the defense of bourgeois democracy, but
can be accomplished only against the bourgeois democratic state, as
against every form of capitalist rule. Let us examine brieﬂy why
this is so.

The only group of concrete rights which are essential to capitalist
rule is the ﬁrst, since this group sums up the basic property relations of
capitalism. The second group (the “civil liberties”) was useful to the
bourgeoisie in its struggle to accomplish the complete defeat of the
feudal aristocracy, and continues to be a pleasant social luxury so long

as capitalism as a whole is vigorous and expanding. The third group was;

never acceptable to the bourgeoisie, was wrung from it by the class;
struggle of the workers, and can be tolerated by the bourgeoisie only so)
long as capitalism is suﬂiciently healthy to permit such a concession,
only so long as the exercise of these “proletarian .rights” does not
threaten the actual existence of the capitalist order.

However, capitalism is now in decline as a world order. As the
decline deepens, the bourgeoisie is forced to an ever greater extent to
restrict the exercise of the second and third groups of rights (even
though the second group was itself first established by the bourgeoisie).
In the permanent crisis of monopoly-imperialism, the exercise of these
rights is far too dangerous to capitalist rule. Concessions can no longer
be afforded. Mass unrest, if the proletarian leadership is permitted to
organize and express it through the exercise of these concrete rights,
threatens the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. Fascism completes-.
the total abrogation of the third group of rights (the “proletarian
rights”), and the virtual abrogation of the second—at least so far as.
the second applies to the proletariat.

The restrictions of these concrete rights, however, begin long;
before fascism comes to power—fascism only completes the process..
In Germany, Austria, France, England, even in the United States, we-
have seen it and continue to see it happening. The executive arm of the-
government takes over more and more control, gradually introducing a.
“decree” form of government. Compulsory arbitration is introduced;:
censorship is established; free assemblage restricted. Pickets are either"
not allowed, or their numbers and activities limited.

It is the “democratic” state itself which in the ﬁrst instance carries:
out these progressive restrictions on" concrete “dernoC_ratic” rights. Evem

36.

 

 

 

more: it is the democratic state administered by Social Democratic
majorities, labor governments, or Peoples’ Front governments, that
carries it out. This is just what happened in Germany and Austria, and
what is happening today in France. Blum has passed laws restricting
the rights of political organization, of free press and propaganda, has
instituted a form of compulsory arbitration and other types of restric-

' tions on striking workers. Naturally he does so under the pretense of

delivering "blows” at the fascists. But in actuality his government
is destroying the democratic rights of the French masses—-all in
their name.

We reach a paradoxical sounding but none the less true conclusion:
In the present period of social crisis, the defense of the bourgeois demo-
cratic state means actually a defense of the abrogation of concrete
democratic rights. Concrete democratic rights can be defended only by
independent class struggle; and such a struggle ﬁnds itself in ever
greater conﬂict with the bourgeois democratic state which itself is the
agency that undermines democratic rights. In the name of democracy,
the Peoples’ Front, by calling for a defense of the bourgeois demo-
cratic state, sets a trap which will bring about the destruction of all
genuine democracy.

Nevertheless, the advent of fascism on a world scale presents a
new strategical problem to the proletarian movement. Fascism, the
"social policy of constraint” carried to its conclusion, completes the
destruction of the two second groups of demcratic rights; and is able
to consolidate power only by doing so. Consequently, the defense of
these concrete democratic rights assumes a new and greater importance
in-the strategy of the proletarian movement—a considerably greater
importance, for example, than it occupied during the days prior to
1914. This defense is not at all, as we have seen, for the sake of bour-
geois democracy, or in. alliance with or subordination to bourgeois
democracy. That is the fatal error of the Peoples’ Front. It must be an
independent class defense; and as such will have to be conducted in
the last analysis not alongside of but against the bourgeois demo-
cratic state.

The democratic rights are of inestimable advantage to the prole-
tariat in its struggle for power. Wherever they are threatened in prac-
tice this threat must be resisted, and the revolutionary socialists may
take the lead in organizing resistance. The resistance must depend ﬁrst
and foremost on mass action: on strong, militant picket lines, great
demonstrations and mass meetings, union organization; in the end, on

a workers’ militia and,workers’ councils. Legalistic means, pressure on
the “government,” are, of course, not excluded. Campaigns for the
“democratization” of the state apparatus, such as the Supreme Court
0 campaign in this country, or, more particularly, the campaigns for
the re-introduction of democratic forms in the fascist nations (as
attempted, for example, in Austria), are necessary. These must, how-
ever, be always subordinated to more direct forms of mass action, for «
it is the latter only that can in the long run defend the democratic
rights. When the crisis grows more acute, and the fascist gangs appear
on the scene to break up picket lines and workers’ meetings, once again 
the workers must defend their rights ﬁrst and foremost by independent I
organization and mass action: they, with their class forces, must settle
, directly with the fascists. The democratic government will not, cannot
E do so: as history has so conclusively proved to us, the democratic
government in the end will only hand over the reins to the fascists; or
if, as in Spain, it pretends to ﬁght at all, it will be only because of the
. overwhelming class pressure of the workers that compels it.
The struggle for the defense of concrete democratic rights is of
l the utmost importance at the present time. It can rally great sections
M of the masses, and offers one of the most fruitful of all ﬁelds for the
 application of the genuine united front tactic. And, behind the leader-
{E ship of the working class, it can draw middle—class as well as proletarian
I; groups, thereby offering an “approach to the middle classes” which is
i, in no sense Capitulation. Furthermore, this struggle is at present a
3 . revolutionary struggle. Through it, and not by the treacherous and
* illusory “defense of bourgeois democracy,” the road of the fascists will
l be impeded and blocked. And, since the protection of democratic rights
lg‘ can no longer be continued for any indefinite period of time under the
 capitalist order, the determined struggle to defend them will prove a
‘ compelling factor, leading to the proletarian revolution and to social-
« isrn', which alone can guarantee to men a true democracy.

VI

The Peoples’ Front in France
1

ON February 6, 1934, gangs of fascists, reactionaries and royalists—
for the most part young students and irresponsible sons of noblemen—
rioted in Pa-ris, across the river from the Chamber of Deputies. Less
than a week later, on the 12th, the working class replied in its own
way, spontaneously, by a vast general strike.

These events were of the highest symptomatic importance. They
demonstrated, beyond any shadow of doubt, that the crisis in France
had reached a point where it could no longer be quieted down, much
less solved, by legal and parliamentary means. They showed that the
issue was leaving the halls of the Chamber of Deputies and moving out
into the streets and the factories; that events in France were progress-
ing relentlessly toward a revolutionary climax; that within the next
few years the fate of France——fascist France or a workers’ France-—was
to be decided.

The underlying causes are, of course, to be sought in the status of
French economy. The peculiar conditions of French economy—the
already accomplished devaluation of its currency, the comparative
absence of gigantic industrial enterprises, the methods of French agri-
culture and the large number of well cultivated small holdings, the
huge gold reserve, and the advantages still at that time accruing to
France from the terms of the Versailles Treaty—had delayed the impact
of the world crisis. However, when the crisis, belatedly, hit France,
these same peculiar conditions, aggravated by the collapse of the Ver-
sailles system, undermined the resiliency of French economy, and made
it impossible for France to share proportionately in the world upturn
that began in 1933. In 1935, for example, production in France as
compared with production in 1928-29 was lower than in the case of

39

any other great power. The truth is that France has reached an impasse.
There are only two roads: the‘ salvation of French economy through
the workers’ revolution and socialism; or the solidification of disintegra-
tion by the strait-jacket of Fascism.

These conclusions, so incontrovertible in the light of any objective
analysis of French conditions, were, however, reached only by the bour-
geoisie and by the revolutionary Marxists, the latter tragically weak in
numbers and inﬂuence. The bourgeoisie drew appropriate conclusions,
and began carefully and systematically to prepare for the transition to
fascism, just as the German bourgeoisie had done before them; began
to take steps to take the fascist movement out of the hands of the
students and light-minded aristocrats, and to search for a serious mass
base; and began to make ready the arms, the pistols and clubs and
machine guns and airplanes through which the issue would be ﬁnally
decided.

The Marxists, also, drew appropriate conclusions. They called for
a direct perspective leading to the conquest of power. They called for
a concentration on the work of preparing the class forces, and a reduc-
tion of parliamentary activities to a secondary level. They called for
a united front of mass struggle; for the building of a workers’ militia
able to defend the proletarian interests; for steps to be taken toward
the formation of committees in the factories and shops, on the land,
and in the armed forces; for the transfer of the focus of struggle to
these committees, with the aim, when the revolutionary crisis reached
its climax, of the transfer of power to the committees: that is, with the
aim of the transfer of power to a Soviet State. They called for broad
mass actions, for boldness and decision, for the sharpening of the class
struggle. These were and continue to be their slogans; and in them
alone is the hope of the French working class.

The reformist leadership of the Socialist Party of France, on the
other hand, and the Stalinists, just then turning reformist under the
impulse of the new orientation of the Comintern, had quite different
views. The depth _of the crisis made no impression on their shielded
eyes. The approach of a revolutionary situation? Mere fantasy. Workers’
militia and factory committees? Only the delusions and idiotic provo-
cations of sectarian minds. The real business was to defend the great
French democracy, to “rehabilitate” democratic capitalism, to protect
it against its enemies. And their brains were little concerned with the
enemy within, with the French counter-revolution; the great enemy
was without——I-Iitler and German Nazism.

In the summer of 1934 the Socialist and Communist Parties con-
cluded what they called a United Front——the widely heralded "Front
Unique.” But this was in actuality at the farthest remove from the

40

 

 

 

genuine united front of action on speciﬁc issues. It was, ﬁrst, a "non-
aggression pact” whereby the two parties gave up the indispensable
right of mutual criticism; and, second, an agreement on certain purely
defensive measures whereby French “democracy” could be protected.
This, however, was only the beginning.

The key to French internal politics is to be found in the Radical-
Socialist Party. This is the great Center party of French capitalism, in
1934 the largest party in France, the ﬁrm and unwavering defender of
capitalist property rights. Its propaganda appeal is addressed chieﬂy to
the middle classes, and among them it has found the bulk of its mem-4
bership, promising them the scraps and leavings from the capitalist
table. In normal times, for many decades, the Radical Party has usually
formed the government, at one period in a coalition with the right, at
the next in a coalition with the left (ordinarily with the Socialist
Party), balancing itself delicately between the forces. It is a party shot
through and through with corruption and venality of every sort. In
1934, the measure of this corruption was beginning to be widely known
through a series of scandals; and, more fundamentally, the pressure of
the crisis was teaching the middle classes that the program of the
Radical Party had nothing futher to offer them, that they had to
abandon their traditional loyalty, and seek another way out. It was a
Radical government that held ofﬁce on February 6th; and in the face of
the disorderly demonstration of the impotent young students and
aristocrats, the Radicals showed how much courage and determination
they had in the "struggle against fascism.” The Radicals turned tail and
ran; they immediately resigned the government, and hid in fright their
political faces.

The proper conclusions were obvious. The problem of winning the
lower strata of the middle classes in France to the side of the ﬁght
against fascism and for socialism was nothing else than the problem of
winning them away from’ the Radical Party. The crisis and the conduct
of the Radical Party had made this, politically speaking, a compara-
tively simple problem. Its program and its leadership were completely
discredited before the masses. A bold and «independent. class policy on
the part of the proletarian parties would simply have destroyed the
Radical Party; with the bulk of the lower strata of its former sup-
porters going over to the side of the workers’ parties, its upper strata
going over to the fascists. And, in point of fact, in spite of the policy
of the workers’ parties, this has happened and is happening. The Radical
Party is falling apart (as indicated by its tremendous drop in votes
during 1935 and still more in 1936); but its disintegration is most
dangerously delayed, and the parties of the right——their bold policies
contrasting so sharply with the spineless policies of the left—derive

41

 

beneﬁts from the disintegration out of all proportion to what might
so easily be the case.

In direct opposition to the Marxist—indeed, the simple common-
sense-—answer to the question of strategy toward the Radical Party, the
entire policies of both the Communist and Socialist Parties have been
oriented toward conciliation to, bolstering up of the Radical Party.
This is, in substance, the organizational form of the Peoples’ Front in
France established formally in 1935: the coalition of the Communist,
Socialist, and Radical Parties. And, since the entire perspective of the
workers’ parties is directed toward the maintenance of the coalition
with the Radicals, it necessarily follows that the policy of the Peoples’
Front as a whole is dominated by the Radicals, since to break with the
policy of the Radicals would at once bring about the breakup of the
Peoples’ Front. The Radicals hold the whip hand. Their own necks have
been saved by the prestige loaned them through their alliance with the
workers’ parties; they have a time longer to fasten their prejudices on
the minds of the masses——the whole Peoples’ Front ideology being built
out of their prejudices; while, in increasing numbers, the masses, dis-
gusted with the emptiness of the program of the “left,” pass over to the
camp of the fascists.

There could be no other result from the Peoples’ Front policy. The
Peoples’ Front is designed to “save capitalist democracy from fascism.”
But to save and defend capitalist democracy is merely the traditional
policy of the Radicals—a policy proved utterly untenable by history,
by 1934, and half-understood as untenable by ever growing numbers
among the masses. The Peoples’ Front simply took over the policy of
the Radicals, and offers it as a solution under the cover of a new name.
The program of the Peoples’ Front is just the program of the Radicals
re-written (and could not be anything else, since then the Radicals
would not have signed it). It is in fact somewhat to the right of Roose-
velt’s New Deal program. It features planks on "good government,”
League of Nations, public works, better organization of credit and
banking, “democratic reform” of taxation, “against unemployment,”
rise in commodity prices, and (most revealing) “measures . . . being
taken to safeguard the interests of the small shareholder.” (Doubtless

the last provision is particularly appealing to the “bourgeois—minded”

French proletarian.) _

What lies back of this shameful capitulation to the Radicals? The
reasons can be brieﬂy stated: In return for the capitulation, the Stalin-
ists were granted the votes of the Radicals for the Franco-Soviet Pact.
The reformist Socialist Party of France has always had, at bottom, the
program of the defense of capitalist democracy; it has merely propa-
gated this program within the working class, dividing labors with the

42

 

 

 

Radical Party, which propagated it within the middle classes. In the
time of crisis, therefore, the Socialist Party lines up with its natural
political kin. To reformism, fascism or the proletarian revolution are
equally death-blows; and through the Peoples’ Front the Socialist Party,
like the Communist Party, tries to avoid both the one and the other.
And in the case of both of the workers’ parties, they ﬁnd in their coali-
tion with the Radicals in the Peoples’ Front the means of preparation
for the coming war: the war in which they propose to line up the
French masses for French imperialism against German imperialism—
the Stalinists in order to carry out Stalin’s conception of “defense of
the Soviet Union,” the Socialists because reformism, tied by its whole
nature to the bourgeois democratic state, is on all crucial occasions the
agent of the bourgeoisie.

The fruits of the Peoples’ Front policy, the policy of collaboration
with the Radicals, the policy of class collaboration, have not been long
in ripening. In general terms, the great crime of the Peoples’ Front has
been its complete disorientation of the French proletariat. The Peoples’
Front has prevented the working class from preparing and carrying out
its revolutionary class struggle for power—the only possible solution
from the point of view of the proletariat; and instead has deceived the
working class into putting reliance on class collaboration, on bourgeois
democracy, on the capitalist state. That is, the Peoples’ Front teaches
the working class to rely on the good will of the class enemy, and to
renounce the strengthening of its independent force.

In 1935, the Stalinists, with their eyes on their Radical colleagues,
repudiated the great strikes at Toulon and Brest as “provocations.”
The Peoples’ Front urges the workers to sing the Marseillaise and carry
the tri-color, and not to be too forward with the Internationale and the
red ﬂag. The Peoples’ Front hails the pitiful parliamentary victories in
the 1935 municipal elections as a major blow against fascism; and
greets the majority in the 1936 elections for the Chamber of Deputies
as a triumph. Under the compulsion of the logic of their policy, the
Peoples’ Fronters abandon all struggle against the two-year conscription
laws, and become whole-hearted supporters of the armament program
of French imperialism.

But the Peoples’ Front has at any rate been a great obstacle to
fascism? Not in the least. Fascism has continued its development
unhampered by the Peoples’ Front, at the tempo dictated by ﬁnance-
capital and the given relation of forces. In 1934 the fascist movement
in France was not suﬂiciently deep and serious; it was led and composed

43

 

of the froth of society, and was not the basis of a great mass movement.
The general strike of February 12th—the independent class action of
the workers—struck it a blow, and it recoiled; and it was held further
in check by the shipyard strikes in 1935. But it recoiled only to gather
new strength and to prepare more adequately. It won serious mass
leaders of consequence, like the renegade communist, Doriot. In 1936,
it again received a temporary set-back: not from the elections (for the
fascists are well aware that the issue will not be decided in parliament,
and in any case the Right increased its vote in the same amount as did
the Left, both at the expense of the Center), but from the mighty
and spontaneous general strike in June. Once again fascism goes for-
ward, this time on the main road; it laughs at the statutes passed
“outlawing” its organizations, merely changing names; and it feeds
delightedly off the weaknesses, contradictions, and failures of the
Peoples’ Front and the Peoples’ Front government.

In the Spring of 1936 the Peoples’ Front took over the government.
What is the record? In the face of the tremendous June strikes, involv-
ing 8,000,000 or more workers, and begun by the workers without a
word of leadership from the Peoples’ Front parties, the Blum govern-
ment, together with its Radical and Stalinist supporters, stood aghast,
frightened, breathless at the sweep of the masses. They explained to the
workers that “they must know how to end a strike as well as how to
begin one” (to quote the words of the Stalinist leader). Like true
reformists, they acted in the manner described by the theorist of Ger-
man ﬁnance-capital (in the same quotation I have given in Chapter
III). “The deﬂection of the revolution into social-political measures
corresponded with the transference of the struggle from the factories
and the streets into Parliament and Cabinets, that is, with the trans-
formation of the struggle ‘from below’ into concessions ‘from above’.”
They passed a series of laws, in agreement with the bourgeoisie—then
in strategic retreat before the mass offensive——to show the workers that
real beneﬁts came to them not through struggle but through the beneﬁ-
cence of “their” government. And already, during these short months,
the concessions to the workers, where not directly sabotaged by the
capitalists, have been more than wiped out by the increase in the cost
of living, resulting from the devaluation and other inﬂationary meas-
ures, which the government has been forced by economic compulsion
to carry out.

The Blum government is a capitalist government, like all coalition
governments; and as such it administers the affairs of French imperial-
ism. In the interests of French imperialism, to protect the remnants of
the Versailles settlement, it has undertaken an unprecedented armament

program. How revealing to read in the New York Times of February
3rd of this year that all parties of the Peoples’ Front voted for the
military budget. (Even at the time of the Seventh Congress, Dimitroff
argued that the Communists in France would not support the military
budget.) All likewise voted for the military loan to Poland, which
nation is now completing its transformation to fascism. The Blum gov-
ernment engineered the hypocritical “Neutrality Pact” in the Spanish
crisis, actively blocked aid to the Spanish workers, and is now in the
forefront of the international boycott. It passes laws restricting free-
dom and speech and assembly, and instituting compulsory arbitration;
and sends Mobile Guards against strikers. It suppressed an incipient
revolt in Syria, and continues in French Indo-China a régime which
jails and tortures revolutionists. It suppresses issues of revolutionary
journals in France (two issues, for example, of Lutte des Classes) and
emprisons French revolutionists. Blum cables personal congratulations
to Roosevelt on his victory in November. All parties of the Peoples’
Front announce the complete solidarity of all true Frenchmen against
the threat of Germany; all vie with each other in super-patriotism, and
the greatest scandal of the year arises when a Socialist is accused of not
having been sufficiently patriotic in the last war—-—the charge against
Salengro, which the Peoples’ Front so indignantly repudiated. The
Stalinists, through Thorez, call for the transformation of the Peoples’
Front into a “French Front.” And this last is the most revealing of

tall: for through the Peoples’ Front, there is being prepared in France
. the complete “national front,” once again national unity, as in 1914,

behind French imperialism in the coming war. ’

In all these weak, docile, spineless months, the Peoples’ Front has to
its credit only one bold and vigorous action. This occurred in January,
when French Morocco, key colony of French imperialism, was menaced
by Germany. At once, without a moment’s hesitation, the Peoples’
Front sprang to the helm, ordered the ﬂeet to sail, and stood by.to
defend with the lives of the masses the booty of the French bourgeoisie.

But underneath the fagade of the Peoples’ Front, deep down among
the masses, the crisis continues and extends. After a lull following the
June strikes, the workers are once more in motion. New strikes, not
yet wide and general as in June, break out day by day; and now they
are fought not in the holiday spirit of June, but in grim and bitter
earnest. The great class armies are, under the impact of the impassable
crisis, slowly aligning, in spite of everything the Peoples’ Front can
or will do. ’In the end, the issue will have to be met. Out of it will
come either a fascist triumph, and the setting back of the European
proletariat for decades to come, or the proletarian revolution. But to

45

 
  
 

achieve the latter the workers must, learning from their experience,
break utterly with the false, debilitating and treacherous policy- of the
Peoples’ Front; ‘and take the road of revolutionary class struggle for
power and for socialism. Without this, victory is impossible, fascism
is inevitable. ' «

 

 

 

VII

The Peoples’ Front in Spain

THE crisis in Spain is neither new nor unexpected. After its brief and
reckless period of glory at the dawn of the modern era, Spain was thrust
back into obscurity by the short-sighted policies of its rulers and the
advance of northern capitalism. For more than three hundred years it
has wallowed in ignorance and squalor, the heavy hand of the Church
combining with an odd mélange of semi-feudal lords, the monarchy,
great landed proprietors, a small and corrupt native bourgeoisie, and
foreign enterprisers, to exploit and oppress the Spanish people. The
capitalist revolution was never completed in Spain; its backward econ-
omy has been a hopelessly entangled mixture of capitalism combined
with the remains of another age. And at this late day, with capitalism
in decline on a world scale, and the great powers struggling to the
death for the possibilities of exploitation which remain, capitalism can
solve not a single one of the great problems of the Spanish economy.

The land of the great estates for the millions of peasants? But the
banking and credit system rests upon land mortgages, and to distribute
the land would destroy the banking system, that is, destroy Spanish
capitalism. The development of Spanish industry? But, on a capitalist
basis, this could be accomplished only in an open and expanding world
market, whereas the world market is monopolized by the great powers;
and even the internal market could not long remain in native hands
against the pressure of cheap goods produced by advanced techniques
in the imperialist countries. Separation of Church and State, secular-
ization of the nation, and abolition of the political power of the Church?
But the Church is itself the greatest capitalist of Spain. Democratiza-
tion of the army? But the army, the foundation of power, was in the
hands of reaction. Freedom for Morocco and autonomy for the Basques
and Catalonia? But Spanish capitalism depended upon the exploitation
of Morocco and the national minorities.

No, not a single majoriproblem of Spain can be solved by capital-
ism. The solutions can be discovered only through the workers’ revolu-
tion and through socialism—and indeed, not through the Spanish revo-
lution alone. Socialism, by destroying the capitalist order and doing
away with the iron bands of capitalist property relations, can give the
land to the peasants, expand a socialized industry, liquidate the Church
as an oppressive institution, build a workers’ and peasants’ army, and
form a free federation of Iberian Socialist Republics.

Such, however, is not the opinion of reformists. After the abdica-
tion of the King in 1931, the Socialist Party of Spain entered a coalition
government of bourgeois democracy. Two years were enough to expose
the hopeless weakness and completely false policy of the coalition; and
in 1933, after an electoral Victory, 9. Right coalition took over the reins
of the government. The advance of reaction continued unhampered by
the parliamentary maneuvers of the reformists. But the alarmed workers
took things into their own hands. In 1934, strikes followed one after
another in rapid succession. In October, the workers forced their
leaders into acquiescence in a revolutionary general strike which devel-
oped into an attempted insurrection. The insurrection was drowned in
blood by the Foreign Legion, but only after a display of the most mag-
niﬁcent courage and heroism. Far from being disheartened or set back,
the workers were in actuality greatly strengthened by the struggle, and
the forces of the counter-revolution injured. Once again not class
collaboration and reformism but the methods of revolutionary class
struggle proved themselves the decisive weapon to serve the interests
of the masses.

The workers had suffered a temporary defeat. But their morale was
high, their sense of organization strong; they had learned from their
bitter experience, and were prepared to enter the path of revolutionary
struggle for power and for socialism. Then: enter the Peoples’ Front,
putting a new face on the reformist policies that had lead to the disas-
ters of the past. In 1935, the Peoples’ Front program was signed by
the workers’ parties and the “left” bourgeois republican parties. It is a
document quite on a par with its sister document in France, a little to
the right of the New Deal. It bases itself on the defense of democratic
capitalism, and rejects——not merely implicitly, but in many cases ﬂatly
and explicitly-——every even near~socialist demand.

Nevertheless, the Peoples’ Front parties won an electoral majority
(though a minority by a small margin in popular vote) and formed the
government under Azaﬁa in February, 193 6. From the beginning, as in
France, the policy of the Peoples’ Front was, has been, and will continue
to be the policy of the “republican” bourgeoisie. To break with that
policy in favor of a proletarian policy would mean to break the Peoples’

“48

 

Front; and that, according to our reformists, is of course “counter-
revolution.” How amply the nature of the Peoples’ Front was dis-
played during the months from February to July, 1936! The masses
thought they had won a victory through the election of the govern-
ment, and began to act accordingly, began to take over the land, to
strike, to strive for control of factories and railroads. And the govern-
ment, after drawing back in alarm, then, for the sake of “order” and
to avoid “antagonizing” the republican allies or “provoking” the reac-
tion—the government naturally sent the Civil Guard against the peas-
ants who were taking over the land, ordered the strikes to stop, arrested
the strikers, broke up workers’ meetings. The government even censored
long columns from the papers of the parties—for example, the Com-
munist Party——which supported it! In May, 23 peasants were killed,
and 30 wounded by the Civil Guard; and the Minister of the Interior
sent a telegram of congratulations—to the Civil Guard.

Meanwhile the counter-revolution, aided by support from abroad in
Portugal, Great Britain, Germany and Italy, prepared its forces. It
controlled the army, and the government did not dare touch the army.
It controlled Morocco, and the government did not dare touch Morocco.
Openly, brazenly, it laid out its campaign, and chose its time to strike.
On the other side, the proletariat was blocked by the government and
by the whole Peoples’ Front policy, from making ready its own class
forces: it could not form and arm and train its militia, could not select
its factory and peasant committees to coordinate activities; its leaders
tried to teach it to put all faith in the government—that is, in the
political executive of the bourgeoisie—and in return the government
would handle the fascists. But in spite of and against the policy of the
Peoples’ Front, the masses went over to direct action, and in these
actions were further tested and prepared. The months between February
and July witnessed a continuous series of strikes by the workers and
seizures of land by the peasants.

On July 17, the counter-revolution struck. The answer of the
Peoples’ Front government—the defender against fascism—was: an
attempt to come to an understanding with the fascists, and a refusal to
arm the workers. But the proletariat took things into its own hands,
began its own mobilization, began simply taking the arms from arsenals
and barracks. The government was forced by the pressure of the masses
to reverse its policy, distribute arms, and call for resistance to the
counter-revolution. Once again direct class action, though hampered
and obstructed by the treacheries of Peoples’ Frontism, had proved the
answer and the only answer.

The Peoples’ Front was thus responsible for the untrained and
unprepared condition in which the proletariat and peasantry found itself

‘ 49

 

 

 

in July. A revolutionary policy would have put the workers in a posi-
tion to handle the counter—revolution with a few sharp blows, since
Spanish fascism had a comparatively small and uninﬂuential mass base.
As it is, the Civil War drags on endlessly, with hundreds of thousands
already killed and many more thousands yet to die. The crime of the
Peoples’ Front, however, does not end in July.

In the ﬁrst weeks after the start of the Civil War, the proletariat
and peasantry took, spontaneously, major steps toward setting up their
own councils and committees in the factories and shops and villages;
established their own police forces and de facto revolutionary courts;
and began the formation of their own independent class militia, the
foundation of a workers’ Red Army. In this way they were laying the
basis for a new state, a revolutionary workers’ state, which, by drawing
all power into its own hands and doing away with the existing bour-
geois state and its mechanisms, could conduct a revolutionary war
against the fascists, and begin the building of socialism. And only
through such a state and such a war can the workers succeed in Spain.
For the war against the fascists must be a revolutionary war, conducted
in terms of a revolutionary perspective. This is true not merely from
the point of view of military effectiveness, but, above all, politically. In
order to undermine Franco’s African base, and draw the Moorish masses
to the side of the Spanish workers, freedom had to be given to Morocco.
In order to assure full support from the Basque country and Catalonia,
autonomy had to be granted the Basques and Catalonians. In order to
solidify a genuine alliance between the peasantry and the workers, and
thereby also to make it impossible for Franco to consolidate his lines
of communication, the land had to be given outright to the peasants.
In order to protect the factories against sabotage, the workers had to
have control of them. In order to have an armed force that could be
relied on to ﬁght consistently for the revolution and to be protected
against any utilization against the workers and peasants, a new workers’
army, divorced in control from the bourgeois state machinery, had to
be built.

All of these, however, are revolutionary acts; and, therefore, cannot
be properly carried out by a bourgeois government, whether that gov-
ernment is called by the name of “Peoples’ Front” or any other. The
task of Marxists in Spain was to promote and lead the process of the
extension of workers’ power; to transform the war against Franco into
a revolutionary war for workers’ power and for socialism; to act along
the perspective of the transfer of state power to the workers’ and peas-
ants’ and soldiers’ committees. The Peoples’ Front leaders of the Spanish
working-class parties did just the opposite. After the first weeks of
the Civil War, when the Peoples’ Front government had become little

50

 

 

more than a helpless shell—the Communist and Socialist parties entered
the Peoples’ Front government, and Caballero, “the Spanish Lenin,”
became the premier of a bourgeois coalition government. In this way,
the workers were shunted aside from the revolutionary path, taught to
give up conﬁdence in their own class organs, their own committees and
councils, to put reliance on the government. The struggle was thrust
back into the treacherous “defense of bourgeois democracy” against
Fascism; Caballero dropped all his loud talk about “Soviets” and pro-
claimed to Spain and to the world that he was interested only in
protecting the “democratic republic.”

Step by step the consequences have been drawn out. The govern-
ment, as a bourgeois government, has been _compelled to check the
extension of proletarian class power, and progressively to liquidate the
steps that had already been taken. In the name of a “uniﬁed command”
it has cut off the development toward a genuine workers’ army, and
reconstituted the militia into a republican army. In the name of law
and order, it has eliminated the workers’ police in the cities, enforcing
proletarian justice, and has set up a republican police force, incorporat-
ing institutions and individuals already demonstrated to be betrayers
of the workers’ struggle. In the name of eﬁicient production, it breaks
down genuine workers’ control of the factories. Its great positive
accomplishment to date, proudly hailed and announced by Caballero,
is—to have balanced the budget! In this manner, the Peoples’ Front
government becomes a second line of defense for capitalism. If the
workers succeed, in spite of the government, in defeating the armies of
Franco, they will only find themselves bound to the capitalist order as
enforced by the Peoples’ Front. Unless they break with Popular Fron t-
ism, they will ﬁnd——and this is the real tragedy of Spain—that they
have given their lives and their blood in 1/aim, that their selﬂess and
heroic sacriﬁce, far from bringing emancipation, will have left them
where they began, tied hand and foot in the property relations of
capitalist exploitation.

Even more treacherous is the role of the Peoples’ Front in Catalonia,
for in Catalonia the process of extending workers’ power had gone
much further than in the rest of Spain. Nevertheless, the workers’
parties in Catalonia, instead of carrying through that process to its
culmination in the actual transfer of state power, likewise, under the
impulsion of the ideas of the Peoples’ Front, entered the Catalonian
coalition government. Even the P.O.U.M., though it had abstractly
maintained against the other parties that the issue in Spain was "Social-
ism vs. Capitalism” and not “Democracy vs. Fascism,” followed along
into the government. And just as in Spain proper, the consequences of
this step became at once apparent. The workers were turned aside from

the revolutionary path. The government strove to gather into its own
hands the organs of power that had slipped away to the proletariat:
control over the army, the police, the factories. The autonomous com-
mittes of the workers became “no longer necessary”——-as even the
P.O.U.M. explained-—because, of course, the government itself was a
“workers’ government.” In this way, the bourgeoisie, acting through
the coalition government, was preparing the re-consolidation of capi-
talism in the event that Franco should be defeated on the military front.
With startling suddenness, in November and December, the true
character of the Catalonian government became obvious to the world.
It was disclosed that representatives of the left republican parties in
the government were secretly negotiating in Paris for a “separate peace.”
A conspiracy was unearthed through which a group from the left
republican parties was aiming to assassinate the leaders of the workers’
parties. A campaign against the P.O.U.M. was started by the republi-
can parties in collaboration with the Stalinists (including the Soviet
consul-general, Antonov-Ovseénko) , on the grounds that the P.O.U.M.
was a disruptive and counter-revolutionary force through its insistence
on its slogan of socialism vs. capitalism. The campaign culminated in
the P.O.U.M.’s being driven out of the government, under the threat
of the withdrawal of Soviet material aid if this were not carried through.
Impelled thus by necessity rather than by its own clear will, the
P.O.U.M. has again turned toward the revolutionary path, and now
calls for a break with the policies of the Peoples’ Front, the transfor-
mation of the war into a revolutionary war, and the building of
workers’ power. -

The reply of the Peoples’ Fronters to the new turn of the P.O.U.M.
toward a revolutionary course has not been long in coming. Busily
re-constituting the Loyalist Army under a uniﬁed command on a
bourgeois basis, the leaders of the Peoples’ Front declare that the insist-
ence of the P.O.U.M. on a revolutionary war proves it the military as
well as political ally of Franco. The Madrid radio station of the
P.O.U.M. is raided and shut down; its journals are suppressed; a
“Peoples’ Tribunal” consisting of four judges, one from the Stalinists,
one Socialist, and two from the “left republican” parties, is appointed
to try the P.O.U.M. leaders for treason and “counter-revolution.” The
campaign for the physical annihilation of the P.O.U.M., under the whip
of the Stalinists, continually mounts, and is checked only by the resist-
ance it meets from the rank and file of the militia and the workers’
mass organizations. There should be no surprise. Such also was the
reply of the reformists in Germany to Luxemburg and Liebknecht. The
policy of class collaboration, of the Peoples’ Front, can no more endure
the proletarian revolution than the counter-revolution of fascism.

VIII
The Peoples’ Front in the United States

1

THE Peoples’ Front has not, of course, advanced as far in the United
States as in France or Spain. In the formal sense, there is not yet in the
United States an established “Peoples’ Front.” The United States is not
faced with a developing revolutionary crisis, as is France, nor is it in
the midst of a Civil War, as is Spain. Though the historical issue for
the United States, as is the case for every nation at the present time, is
socialism vs. capitalism, though only the workers’ revolution and social-

‘ ism can solve even a single one of the major problems facing United

States economy; nevertheless the issue is not yet posed in terms of the
immediate struggle for state power. The American proletariat is still
faced primarily with the more elementary immediate demands: the
struggle for the right to organize, for industrial unionism, for the exer-

' cise of democratic rights generally, for a powerful trade union and

unemployed movement, for relief and union conditions, for a conscious
mass revolutionary party of struggle. -

But just as the issue of state power can be settled in favor of the
proletariat only by the independent revolutionary class struggle of the
workers, and is lost for the proletariat through the reformist strategy
of the Peoples’ Front; in the same way, at the more elementary stages,
the interests of the proletariat can be served only by the appropriate
methods of class struggle, and are fatally undermined by the class
collaborationist methods of the Peoples’ Front. The Peoples’ Front in
this country, seeping into the labor movement under the sponsorship of
the Communist Party, has made considerable headway; and already its
disastrous effects are becoming apparent in a dozen ﬁelds.

53

 

Up to the present, the best known and most conspicuous result of
the Peoples’ Front strategy emerged during the 1936 election campaign.
From the point of view both of the social composition of his support
and likewise of the political content of his program, Roosevelt was in

 

effect a Peoples’ Front candidate. No one could doubt that he was a"
staunch and outstanding defender of capitalist democracy, nor that the ,

bulk of the proletariat, the farmers, and the lower strata of the rest
of the middle classes, were solidly behind him. Thus the upholders of
the Peoples’ Front ideology found themselves, willingly or unwillingly,
driven into the Roosevelt camp: either openly, as was the case with
many, or, like the Communist Party itself, through a back-handed and
ambiguous formula.

The Communist Party was compelled to deﬁne the issue of the
campaign as “Progress vs. Reaction,” “Democracy vs. Fascism.” It had
to discover the forces of fascism in the “Landon-Hearst-Liberty League”
combination. It was then required to raise as the central slogan,
“Defeat Landon at all costs!” And the only realistic interpretation of
this slogan——the interpretation which the majority of even its own
sympathizers made—-was to vote for Roosevelt. Browder admits quite
openly that this was the central direction of the Stalinist campaign. In
his post-election analysis of the elections, delivered to the Central
Committee of the party, he boasts as follows: “The ﬁrst objective was
the defeat of Landon. This was accomplished to a degree far surpassing
all expectations . . . this aim we shared with the largest number of
people. . . . Witliout exaggerating our role in bringing about this result,
we can safely say that the weight of each individual Communist in the
struggle was far higher, many fold, than that of the members of any
other political group in America.” He apologizes at length for the
nominally independent Communist Party ticket that was in the ﬁeld.
If only “a national Farmer-Labor party . . .” had “decided to place
Roosevelt at the head of the ticket nationally. . . . Would we have
refrained from putting forward our own independent tickets and
supported the Farmer-Labor party‘ ticket even with Roosevelt at the
head? I venture to say that under such circumstances we would almost
surely have done so.”

In point of fact, this was done in many localities either by the
Communist Party officially, or by individual party members. In Min-
nesota, Washington, California, the Stalinists supported Farmer-Labor
and “progressive” coalitions with no criticism of the fact that Roosevelt
headed their tickets. In New York, the Stalinists gave full support to

54

 

 

 

   

the American Labor Party, which entered the election campaign—as its
leaders openly declared—only to gather labor votes for Roosevelt. Indi-
vidual Communist Party members joined the American Labor Party,
and spoke from its platforms in support of Roosevelt.

The Peoples’ Front policy dictates a wholly anti—Marxist analysis of
Roosevelt. He can no longer be treated as the chief executive for the
dominant class. Criticism of him can only suggest that he is not
responsive enough in carrying out the “peoples’ mandate,” that he can-
not be relied on to take progressive steps unless a certain amount of
pressure against him is generated. Even when, after the elections were
safely under his belt, Roosevelt, at the bidding of his masters, ruthlessly
cut the WPA rolls, even in the light of Roosevelt’s attitude toward the
auto strikes, the Stalinist criticism must remain mild and “loyal.” The
Communist Party, having abandoned the revolutionary aim of the over-
throw of capitalist society, becomes the “party of Twentieth Century
Americanism”; its purpose as deﬁned by the Peoples’ Front, is to func-
tion within the framework of democratic capitalism, as a reformist
“pressure group.” It must strive to become "respectable,” to ingratiate
itself with the class enemy; to show that in return for vague promises
of friendship for the Soviet Union and polite words against fascism, it
is willing to do its part in smothering the class struggle and guarantee-
ing the protection of bourgeois democracy against the threat of
proletarian revolution.

A reformist political Iine cannot be isolated into any supra-mundane
sphere of “pure politics.” It must show its effects on every arena of the
class struggle. We thus ﬁnd during the past two years a cumulative
development of the Peoples’ Front strategy as applied to Communist
Party activities in the trade unions and unemployed organizations. We
may be sure that during the coming months this development will be
carried unprecedented steps" further. The basis of the Peoples’ Front is
class collaboration; and we know from past experience of reformism
what this means on the trade union ﬁeld.

Are the reactionary trade union bureaucrats agents of the class
enemy within the working class? Do their policies act as the major
brake to militant class consciousness within the unions? This is what
Marxism has always taught, but no one could possibly learn this from
the most detailed ,ct‘11t:ly o£ rcucllt Stalinist literature. Nowhere is there
any explanation of, or even reference to, the social function of the trade
union bureaucracy. At the most, there is occasional personal criticism
of some action too gross to ignore; but even this is kept to a minimum,

55

 

 

 

 
 

in the interests of currying favor with the maximum number of the
bureaucrats.

The policy of class collaboration forces the Stalinists to abandon
more and more the ﬁghting struggle for economic demands, and
through-that struggle the raising of the level of class consciousness, for
the attempt to come to agreements with the bureaucrats, to settle
disputes through deals behind the scenes, to rely on governmental
arbitration boards and mediators. The Stalinist work in the unions must
be subordinated to the great aim of achieving in this country a mass,
classless Peoples’ Front. To secure the adherence of a union to a Negro
Congress, or an American League Conference, or a Farmer-Labor—Pro—
gressive what-not, or a Social Security Assembly is far more important
than to get it to prepare and win a militant strike.

The results are already widely present within the labor movement,
though not yet so widely recognized. In the WPA sit-downs, the
Stalinists and the supervisors together explain why the workers must be
peaceful and go home. In Pennsylvania, the Stalinists declare that the
new policy for the Workers’ Alliance must abandon strikes as a method
for “settling disputes.” At the January unemployed demonstration in
Washington, not a single militant slogan or banner was permitted; the
whole demonstration was directed toward the achievement of a friendly
chat with the relief authorities. In the Federation of Teachers, the
general ﬁght against the Boards of Education is deprecated, dual organ-
izations (such as the Teachers’ Guild in New York) are met with
conciliation, and the open struggle against the A.F.of L. Executive
Council and for the C.I.O. principles is shunted aside. In the Cafeteria
Workers, there is disclosed an ironbound alliance between the Stalinists
and the older racketeers. The furriers, the wild men of the Third
Period, turn respectable, and devote their energies against the pro~
gressives and revolutionaries in the union. Ben Gold, who as leader of
the furriers roared for ﬁve years like an untamable lion, now speaks
like the mildest lamb. In the United Textile Workers, the Stalinists at
the Convention come to the rescue of the reactionary oﬂicials. On the
Paciﬁc Coast, among the Maritime Unions, the Stalinists last year ﬁrst
tried to put over the I."S.U. proposals on the Sailors, then attempted to
head off the strike, then insisted that it be delayed until after the elec-
tions (so as not to injure Roosevelt); and in the end were forestalled
only by the militant stand of the Sailors’ Union.

and more as a reactionary force, and the progressive movement in the
unions will have to be built not along with but in large measure
against it.

56

 

  

 

These conclusions are impressively supported by the Stalinist policy
with respect to the A.F.of L.-C.I.O. struggle. At the present time, as
Marxists have made clear, the progressive movement in the unions must
proceed in accordance with the basic slogans: for industrial unionism;
for organization of the basic mass industries; for a class struggle policy;
for trade union democracy. Every one of these slogans, taken indi-
vidually or together, dictates repudiation of the policies and course of
the A.F.of L. bureaucracy, and determined, though of course critical,
support of the C.I.O. This follows not because the C.I.O. as at present
constituted and with its present leadership is the sufficient answer to
the needs of the workers (indeed, through its fundamental class collab-
orationism and its violation of intra-union democracy, it acts even now
and will in the future increasingly act counter to the needs of the
workers) , but because in the light of the real and actual conditions of
the present, the direction of the C.I.O. is the direction of advance for
the labor movement, just as the direction of the A.F.of L. ofﬁcialdom is
the direction of decay and disintegration. As against the A.F.of L.
bureaucracy, therefore, Marxists must, whole-heartedly and unambig-
uously, support the C.I.O. Only such an attitude is at present com-
patible with progressive trade unionism.

The Communist party policy for the next period, however, is for-
mulated around the single slogan of “unity.” “We shall,” Browder says
in the report already referred to, “redouble our efforts in the ﬁght for
trade union unity, for the unity of the American Federation of Labor.
. . . We think that it would be harmful if any unions were divided, one
section going to the C.I.O., the other to the A.F.of L. . . . under no
conditions do we carry that ﬁght on in such a way as to make a split
in that union. . . . For example, in the probable organization of some
sections of heavy machinery, we will have the problem of whether
these new unions shall go into the Machinists or into some of the other
unions, whether it be the Amalgamated Association, or what not.
Generally, we have been clear on this last question. We refused to use
our forces to carry sections of newly organized workers away from the
jurisdictional claims of the Machinists Union over into some of the
industrial unions, where there was a fear that this would intensify
rivalries and sharpen the split.”

No one will argue against the desirability of trade union unity, nor
will anyone "advocate” splits. Nevertheless, it is always the concrete
content of unity, not unity as an abstract slogan, that is important.
And, under the present circumstances, in the labor movement, the
ﬁght for unity itself can be understood only as a ﬁght under the
slogans stated above, and—translated into organizational terms—for
the C.I.O. movement as against the Executive Council. Such a ﬁght

alone makes possible the re-integration of the A.F.of L. on a basis that
would mean an advance and not a defeat; and such a ﬁght is equally
necessary to prevent the C.I.O. oﬂicials themselves from betraying the
movement which at present they lead. Re-integration, of course, may
not be possible without capitulation; and if this is the case, then the
workers must be prepared to face the full consequences——prepared to
face the necessity for the building of a new Federation. The conduct
of a genuinely progressive campaign will have laid the basis for such
an eventuality.

The "unity” campaign of the Communist Party, on the contrary,
disorients the progressive struggle. It blocks the sharp and fruitful
ﬁght against the policies of the Executive Council, announcing in
advance a willingness to compromise and indeed to capitulate; and at
the same time it contributes to reactionary tendencies on the part of
the C.I.O. oﬂicials. To an increasing extent its results will be discovered
in one union after another—as, for that matter, they have already been
discovered in a number of speciﬁc instances: for example, in the Mari-
time Federation of the Paciﬁc, at the Convention of the Federation of
Teachers, and at the A.F.of L. Convention itself, in each of which
instances Stalinist inﬂuence smothered clear-cut support of the C.I.O.

In other fields of Peoples’ Front activities, the same general trend
is observable. For example, in youth work. Following the Seventh
Congress of the Comintern, and the subsequent Congress of the Young
Communist International, proposals were made in this country——as
elseWhere——for the liquidation of the proletarian political youth organ-
izations into broad, classless, non-political” (i.e., Peoples’ Frontist) youth
movements. When the position of the Young Peoples’ Socialist League
made this impossible, the Y.C.L. tried to gain the same end by the
creation of the American Youth Congress on the same Peoples’ Front
basis. The Y.C.L. now devotes a major part of its efforts to conciliating
Y.M.C.A. and religious youth groups so as to maintain a bloc with them
against revolutionary socialists. In the student ﬁeld, the Y.C.L. con-
sistently attempts to manipulate the American Student Union into a
straight Peoples’ Front program and organizational form.

Most signiﬁcant of all is the application of the Peoples’ Front policy
to "anti-war work.” Through a multitude of paciﬁst organizations, "and
especially through the directly. controlled American League against
War and Fascism, the Stalinists aim at the creation of a "broad, class-
less, Peoples’ Front of all those opposed to war.” The class collabora-

58

 

  

tionist character of the Peoples’ Front policy is strikingly revealed
through the Stalinist attitude in these organizations. They rule out in
advance the Marxist analysis of war as necessarily resulting from the
inner conﬂicts of capitalism and therefore genuinely opposed'only by
revolutionary class struggle against the capitalist order; and," in con-
trast, maintain that all persons, from whatever social class or group,
whether or not opposed to capitalism, can “unite” to stop war.

What this “anti—war work” means in actuality is suggested by the
fact that the Stalinists have abandoned attacks on the armament pro-
gram of American imperialism; greet the Buenos Aires Conference (a
mighty step forward in this country’s preparations for the coming war)
as a great advance toward “world peace”; and criticize revolutionary
socialists as planning to sell this country out to Japan, when they call
for non-support of the government in the war. The truth is, of course,
that through the Peoples’ Front, the Stalinists are making ready to
support the government, and to recruit the masses for such support, in
the new imperialist war.

The Real Meaning of the Peoples’ Front
1

EVERY important political act at the present time can be understood
only in the light of the approach of the new imperialist war. This is
true of the acts both of all national governments and likewise of all
important political parties and organizations. No serious politician
doubts that the new war is not far off. Indeed, the Italian invasion of
Ethiopia and the Spanish Civil War constitute a kind of prelude or
overture to the war, demonstrating that the conﬂicts within society
have reached a point where they can no longer be even temporarily
solved through parliamentary and diplomatic maneuvers, through the
League of Nations, conferences and pacts. The coming war, which will
be on a scale unprecedented in history, is at one and the same time a
struggle to the death in the rivalries among the great powers; and, even
more fundamentally, the crucial test for the survival possibilities of
the capitalist order. Mankind will emerge from the war either still tied
to capitalist social relations and, therefore, with the prospect before it
of unutterable misery and the thrusting back of civilization into the
depths of barbarism; or the ‘proletariat will utilize the war crisis to
throw off the yoke of capitalism, to achieve the workers’ revolution,
and to open out to men the mighty perspective of a socialist society.

With such stakes at issue, all governments and political parties
direct their policies toward preparation for the war. For them to act in
any other way would be blindness indeed.

Preparations for the war proceed simultaneously on a number of
fronts. Most obvious, of course, is the accumulation of armament,
which is now undertaken by all nations on a level far exceeding that of
1914. Along with this goes the internal organization of the national
economy in such a way as to make it ﬁtted to serve the war machine.

60

 

 

 

Simultaneously, each nation jockeys back and forth diplomatically
in an effort to form the most favorable alliances, and to break up
potentially opposing alliances.

Such means, however, are not of themselves adequate. Each govern-
ment must aim to achieve within its own conﬁnes national unity for
the conduct of the war. The war is for the bourgeois state a life or
death struggle; if national unity is not achieved, the effectiveness of the
nation in the war is weakened to such an extent that it will almost
necessarily lose. But to achieve national unity means that within the
nation the class struggle, which divides every nation internally, must
be suppressed or suspended; that, somehow or other, national solidarity
must be made to take precedence over class interest for the continuance
of the war.

National unity and the suppression of the class struggle is gained
in part through the very direct means of the physical elimination, by
execution or imprisonment, of those who advocate the class struggle.
But such means of themselves would be insufficient. Supplementing
them, and even more important, are the ideological means, the organ-
ized propaganda whereby the masses are taught that their supreme
loyalty is to the national state, that their interests are best served by
defense of the national state. If some formula can be found for enforc-
ing this lesson, the problem of the accomplishment of national unity
has gone a long way toward solution. _

In part this ideological preparation is carried out directly by the
capitalist state and by bouregois institutions. The schools, the press, the
radio, the Church, are utilized to imprint on the masses the duties of
patriotism and loyalty. But large sections of the masses, in the course
of their experience, learn to distrust the bourgeoisie when its face is
openly seen. And, consequently, a great part of the ideological prepara-
tion must be done by agents of the bourgeoisie operating among the
masses, and pretending to speak in their name. This is the historical
function of reformism. And it was the reformists, the Social-Demo-
cratic parties of Europe, which in 1914 reconciled the masses within
each nation to national unity in support of the war. Within Germany,
the reformists explained that the class struggle for socialism had to be
delayed until Tsarism was defeated; within France, until Kaiserism was
defeated; and so on. And thus, by "their own” leaders, the masses
were lead to imperialist slaughter.

By a judicious combination of the “physical means” and the ideo-
logical means, the fascist nations have alreadycompleted the process of
achieving national unity. (It is to be expected that all nations, upon
the outbreak of the war, will ﬁnd themselves compelled to adopt a
fascist form of government.) However, within the democratic nations

 

     

up to the present a suﬂicient degree of national unity has not yet been
gained, and attempts to complete it increase in intensity and rapidity as
the threat of the war draws closer.

The Peoples’ Front, understood in its fundamentals, is the major
form of the preparation among the masses for the achievement of
national unity within the democratic nations in support of the coming
war. Under the slogans of the Peoples’ Front, the masses will march
forth to ﬁght for "their own” imperialism. The basic formula is
extremely simple: Defend democracy against fascism; our nation
(France, Great Britain, or the United States) is a democracy; Germany
is fascist; therefore we must defend our nation against Germany.

Thus, the Peoples’ Front is ‘the contemporary version of social-
patriotism, the new form in which the betrayal of 1914 is to be
repeated.

It is easy to see why traditional reformists accept the slogans of the
Peoples’ Front (even where they temporarily reject, because of tradi-
tional antagonism, immediate alliance with the Stalinists on the basis
of these slogans). They have always stood for these policies and prac-
tices, reformism being nothing other than an agency of the bourgeoisie
within the working class. Reformism has always been ready to ﬁght a
war in defense of democratic capitalism, since its own fate is bound up
with democratic capitalism. But why is it that the Comintern has this
time initiated the Peoples’ Front movement, and stands as its most
untiring proponent?

The answer here also is not difﬁcult. The policy of Stalinism rests
upon the attempt to achieve national self-suﬂiciency for the Soviet
Union. It is this issue which forced the break between Stalinism and
Marxism, since the Marxists maintained that the Soviet Union could go
forward as a proletarian state, toward socialism, only in conjunction
with the struggle to extend the proletarian revolution to other nations.
Now, since Stalinism conceives its problems in terms of national self-
suﬁciency, it looks upon the solution of the question of defending the
Soviet Union as resting, ﬁrst, upon a maintenance of the international
status quo so long as this is possible (during which time self-sufficiency
will be built up); and, when the war comes, an alliance with whatever
bourgeois nations are willing, in order to prosecute the war successfully.

The Soviet Union believes that the coming war will witness at least
Germany and Japan aligned against it, with Germany the spearhead of
the attack (which is the explanation of what we noticed in the first
chapter—Dimitroff’s contention that German fascism is the “worst”

62

 

 

type of fascism). It is not sure which way Italy will swing (which
explains why Italy was not brought into the Radek Trial, though Ger-
many and Japan were) . It believes it has a good chance of alliance with
France and Great Britain, and a chance for at least benevolent neutral-
ity from the United States. Above all, it counts on military alliance
with France, the “traditional” enemy of Germany.

But a conﬂict arises. Between a workers’ state and every capitalist
state is a social gulf more impassable in the long run than that between
any two capitalist states. And, within the capitalist states function
sections of the Communist International, wholly subordinate to Stalin-
ist policy. If the sections of the Comintern carried out policies of class
struggle, they would threaten the respective bourgeois states with
destruction; and would, in any case, make impossible the achievement of
national unity (which requires suppression of the class struggle) within
those states. From the point of View of Stalinism, twin evils would
follow: the bourgeois states would then not be willing to trust the
Soviet Union as an ally; and even if they became allies, they would be
weakened internally through their inability to achieve national unity,
and would be ineffectual as military partners.

Stalinism must, therefore, make clear to its potential allies that it is
dependable; and must aid its potential or actual allies in their own
preparation for the war. It must show, that it is to say, that in return
for a military alliance it will do its part in suppressing the class struggle
and the proletarian revolution, in bringing about national unity, within
the allied nations.

The Peoples’ Front is a major device whereby just this is done. The
Peoples’ Front gives up the class struggle in favor of class collabora-
tion; it renounces the struggle for socialism in favor of the defense of
democracy (a position altogether acceptable to the capitalist democ-
racies of Great Britain, France, and the United States); it prepares the
ground for the transition from a Peoples’ Front to a “national front,”
to full national unity, ‘as has already been brought completely into
the open in France, and been made ready in Great Britain and the
United States.

The Peoples’ Front is part of the preparation for support of the
coming war. This, in the last analysis, is its real meaning.

Throughout the world, the revolutionary Marxists also prepare for
the coming war. They, however, and they alone, prepare the struggle
against the war. They raise aloft the slogans of revolutionary defeatism,

63

call for no support of any capitalist government, democratic or fascist.
They prepare, as Lenin prepared, to utilize the war crisis for the ever
more relentless advance of the class struggle, for the turning of the
imperialist war into a class war for the triumph of the workers.

In this way, they prepare also the only genuine defense of the Soviet
Union. The Stalinist bureaucracy, through the Peoples’ Front, and
through its alliances with the bourgeois—democratic powers, prepares
not the defense but the defeat of the Soviet Union. The defense of the
first workers’ state can rest only on the international working class, in
the last analysis can be accomplished only through the extension of the
workers’ revolution to other countries. The price exacted for “aid” by
French or British or American imperialism could only be: liquidation of
the revolution, and restoration of capitalist property relations. The
proletarian dictatorship is an inﬁnitely more profound danger to
French and British and American imperialism than the Nazi dictator-
ship. Fascist dictatorship is an “inconvenience” for capitalism; workers’
victory is the death thrust. The Stalinist foreign policy, considered as
a defense for the Soviet Union, is like asking a kidnapper to ‘take a job
as nurse-maid. The true defense of the Soviet Union is the world prose-
cution of the class struggle. And, since the policy of Stalinism acts to
suppress’ the class struggle throughout the world, the defense of the
Soviet Union must be undertaken not in common with but against the
Stalinist bureaucracy. The unrelenting struggle against Stalinism is a
necessary condition for the defense of the Soviet Union.

Not the least of the preparation of Marxists for the coming war,
and for the defense of the Soviet Union, must be the unswerving attack
against the theory and practice, the policy and slogans and, methods of
the Peoples’ Front. The Peoples’ Front condemns the workers, in
advance, to defeat. As against the class collaboration of the Peoples’
Front, Marxists uphold the slogans of the ﬁghting united front of
proletarian action, through which the unity of the working class will
be forged, its allies gained, and its compass set toward the struggle for
power. Only by breaking utterly with the policies of the Peoples’ Front,
and all that they signify, will the proletariat go forward to the sole
solution for it and for mankind: to the proletarian revolution, and to
the international socialist society. V

The Peoples’ Front

Origin and Theory of the_ Peoples’ Front
1

THE slogans of the Peoples’ Front were first advanced by the Com-
munist International and its sections. They began to appear toward the
end of 1933; moved forward slowly for some while; and received official
sanction and theoretical expression at the Seventh Congress of the
Communist International held during the summer of 1935. From then
on they spread out at a headlong pace, and now present themselves as
the key question of proletarian strategy throughout the world.

For some time these policies and slogans met with frantic resistance
from those outside of the ranks of the Comintern and its" sympathizers.
This resistance, however, was largely based on a misunderstanding.
Reformists and social-patriots could not at ﬁrst convince themselves of
the Comintern’s “sincerity.” They thought still in terms of the pre-
ceding strategy of the Comintern, the strategy of the so-called “Third
Period.” Their minds were ﬁlled with memories of “social-fascism,”
“united front from below,” and dual “red unions.’.’ But the resistance
was steadily overcome. The Comintern no longer even mentioned social-
fascism; the united front from below went into the discard; the red
unions were liquidated.

And, one after another, the reformist parties went over to the
slogans of the Peoples’ Front. In France the Peoples’ Front was formally
established; soon afterwards, in Spain‘. Throughout the world it made
headway in giant strides. Soon liberals and “progressives” began to

5

come over, in addition to the reformists and social-patriots. In this
country, for example, The Nation and The New Republic, the leading
liberal periodicals, became wholehearted Peoples’ Fronters. By now,
within the labor movement, and among the social groups sympathetic
to the labor movement, only one ﬁrm opposition to the Peoples’ Front
remains: the opposition, namely, of the revolutionary socialists.

The Peoples’ Front movement began under certain special inter-
national conditions; and it is necessary to review these, at least brieﬂy.

First: The series of defeats of the working class, following the
post-war revolutionary wave, had reached a climax in the triumph of
Hitler. Hitler came to power without a blow struck against him by
either of the great mass working—class parties of Germany. Fascism
seemed irresistibly on the ascendant.

Second: The threat of the new imperialist war, enhanced by the
victory of Hitler, was growing ever more menacing.

Third: Within the Soviet Union itself, where the Peoples’ Front has
its origin, great changes have been taking place during these years since
1933. The First Five Year Plan, with its forced and ruthlessly carried
through collectivization of the peasantry, and its almost exclusive
emphasis on the building up of heavy industry, gave way to the Second
Five Year Plan. Among the important characteristics of the new Plan,
we ﬁnd more emphasis on “consumers’ goods” as against heavy industry;
conciliation of the peasantry; the introduction of Stakhanovism, with
its stimulus to increased differentiation of wages and salaries, leading
to the rise of a labor aristocracy economically far removed from the
mass of the workers; abolition of the special economic and social privi-
leges of the urban proletariat. All of these and a multitude of other
similar changes are most strikingly summed up in the New Constitu-
tion, adopted in November, 1936, which puts the legal ﬁnish to the
Soviet foundation of political power in favor of a plebiscite form
of parliamentarism. '

Fourth: During these years the "Litvinov period” of Soviet diplo-
macy reached its climax. The Soviet Union entered the League of
Nations; and its series of treaties and alliances found culmination in
the signing of the Franco-Soviet Pact of military assistance.

As I shall show later on, these four major features of the recent past
provide a background necessary to any understanding of the policy of
the Peoples’ Front.

 

 

The most authoritative statements on the theory and justification
of the Peoples’ Front are contained in the speeches of Dimitroff, new
Secretary of the Comintern, to the Seventh Congress; and in a short
book, The Work of the Seventh Congress, written by the Comintern
theoretician, Manuilsky. I shall, therefore, base my presentation of the
theory of the Peoples’ Front on these works.

We begin, then, with an alleged “analysis” of the nature of the
present historical period. In this period, according to these new oracles
of the Stalinist Delphi, “the main danger is Fascism”—from whence
the Peoples’ Front is ordinarily known as the “anti-fascist” Peoples’
Front. The Seventh Congress, Manuilsky remarks on page 16, “turned
its ﬁre mainly against fascism.” But, itseems, there are many varieties
of fascism, "good” and “bad” fascisms. And much the worst kind of
fascism is German fascism, Nazism. Dimitroff explains: “The most
reactionary variety of fascism is the German type of fascism. . . . Ger-
man fascism is acting as the spearhead of international counter—re1Jolu-
tion, as the chief incendiary of imperialist war, as the initiator of a
crusade against the Soviet Union, the great fatherland of the toilers of
the whole world.” (The italics are all DimitroIf’s.)

Now fascism, we are told, threatens not only the working class,
but also the peasantry, the middle classes generally, and even certain
sections of the bourgeoisie, especially the "small business man.” Indeed,
fascism in actuality is nothing else than a plot or conspiracy on the
party of a small and vicious clique among the ruling class (“the two
hundred families,” as the clique is known in France, from the fact that
two hundred large stockholders guide the destiny of the Bank of
France). Let us hear again from Dimitroff: ". . . fascism in power is
the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvin-
istic and most imperialist elements of finance capital. . . . Fascism acts
in the interests of the extreme imperialists. . . . It is in the interests of
the most reactionary circles of the bourgeoisie that fascism intercepts
the disappointed masses as they leave the old bourgeois parties.” Man-
uilsky repeats virtually the same words, though adding a psychological
adjective of his own: “. . . fascism is the open and cynical form of the
dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinist, most imperialist
[this matter of "degrees” of imperialism is a most subtle point]
elements of ﬁnance capital.”

It is, moreover, fascism that makes war. Manuilsky: “The growing
menace of world imperialist war is causing all class, national and state
forces to separate into two camps: the camp of war and the camp of
