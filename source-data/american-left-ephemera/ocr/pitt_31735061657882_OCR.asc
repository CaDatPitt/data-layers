Press Coverage of the Convention

The 16th National Convention of the Communist Party received
the widest coverage of any gathering in Party history. The Convention
Press Committee—Simon W. Gerson, chairman, Abner W. Berry,
both of New York; William Allan, Detroit, and Al Richmond, San

, .Francisco——aecredited a total of 70 correspondents from newspapers,

weekly magazines, radio and television.

The correspondents included representatives of the great national
wire services, the Associated Press, the United Press and the Inter-
national News Service; foreign wire services, c. g., the Italian News
Agency (ASNA), the Soviet News Agency (TASS) and the Polish
press service (Polpress), all the great metropolitan dailies of New York
and a number of reporters from nationally—known newspapers located
in other cities. Several small-city newspapers were also represented.
The great TV and radio networks were likewise represented by
full crews.

Since about 50 per cent of the convention delegates worked in shops,
there was considerable feeling that in the current political atmosphere
publication of their names would result in loss of jobs. With that
consideration in mind, the convention decided for a policy of detailed
brieﬁng of correspondents in the press room but against their admis-
sion on the convention ﬂoor.

At the same session, the delegates voted to admit to the floor a
group of non-Communist observers.

Brieﬁngs were held frequently, with every major convention devel-
opment promptly reported to the press room. Texts of major speeches,
reports and resolutions were swiftly supplied to the press corps, as
were breakdowns on convention votes. Members of the Convention
Press Committee were constantly available and questioned and cross-
examined by the newspapermen on details. Requests of newspapermen
from various cities were ﬁlled wherever possible. A number of special
interviews, requested by TV representatives, were held by Party leaders.

Besides the briefing by the press committee, the non-Communist

7' observers were available to the press corps, which had an opportunity

to check the brieﬁngs against the notes of the observers.
Within the limits of the situation, the press corps, on the whole,
felt it received a fair total picture of the convention.

THE COMMUNIST PARTY OONVEN TION

(An Editorial reprinted from Political Affairs, April 1957)

THE RECENT National Convention of
the Communist Party was undoubt-
edly one of the most critically impor-
tant gatherings ever held by the
Communist movement in this coun—
try. Paradoxically, this convention-
held at a time when the Communist
Party is weaker organizationally than
it has been in many years——received
inﬁnitely more spotlighting and pub-
licity throughout the country than al-
most any of its conventions in his-
tory. Such publicity is not accorded
by the politically-competent capital-
ist press of our country to a move-
ment that no longer has any impact
upon the scene.

The challenge that faced this Con-
vention was, in a new form, the same
general one that has been met by
the Party at other critical moments
in the past——the challenge of re-
sponding to major changes in con-
ditions.

It =3 Q

The founding convention of the
Communist Party met in 1919 un-
der the inﬂuence of such tremendous
events as the ﬁrst socialist revolu-

tion, the end of the ﬁrst World War,
and the failure of the socialists in
Germany. The founding of the
Workers Party in December, 1921,
uniﬁed the various Communist
groups and marked the Party's
emerging out of the worst infantile
sectarianism and the state of illegal-
ity brought about by the Palmer
raids.

The Seventh Convention of the
Party in June, 1930, following the de-
fection of the Trotskyite-Cannon
group and the Right-opportunist
group led by Jay Lovestone, took
place at a time when the economic
crash had alreadiy unmasked the
false theories of the “new capital-
ism,” “permanent prosperity,” etc.,
and had demonstrated the Party’s
ability to give leadership to the
masses as exempliﬁed in the historic
March 6th demonstrations of the un-
employed. And though the Party
had been reduced to only 7,000 dues-
paying members, the morale of the
Party was high and it conﬁdently
faced the future, more consolidated
ideologically than ever before in its
history. Its subsequent growth of in-

 

6 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

ﬂuence and numbers justiﬁed this
conﬁdence.

In July 1945 the Party found it
necessary to adjust its line to the
realities of the situation immediately
following World War II, correcting
errors of revisionism put forward by
Browder. The Party emerged from
the situation with its organization
and the bulk of its membership in-
tact, with strong ties to important
sections of the labor movement, the
Negro people, intellectuals, and
others.

4 an I:

The present Convention in its turn
was faced with the necessity also
of adjusting to a new situation, a
situation resulting basically from the
great changes following World War
II. This situation has perhaps best
been "summed up in the proposition
that the emergence of socialism as a
world system is the chief feature of
our present era.

Within the country, the atmos-
phere has likewise changed consid-
erably from that at the height of the
Korean War when the last Con—
vention took place. Since then Mc-
Carthyism reached its peak and was
driven back by the American peo-
ple. Geneva has raised the hopes for
peaceful coexistence as a practical
goal. The AFL and CIO have been
re-united after nearly 20 years of
chronic split, and the liberation
struggle of the Negro people has
taken on a new dimension.

Yet, in contrast to the past con-
ventions referred to, the Party this
time found itself facing a most se-
vere crisis. This crisis was described

in the words of the convention reso-

lution as follows:

It is necessary for all members of
the Communist Party to face up soberly
to the fact that in this period the
Party suﬁered heavy organizational
losses, declined in political influence
in many areas of work, became dan-
gerously isolated from important sec-
tors of the labor and people’s move-
ment, is confronted with the jeopardiz-
ing of the Marxist press, and that in
general the Party is faced with a seri-
ous crisis of a political, ideological and
organizational nature.

It seems to us that the gravity of
the crisis was occasioned largely by
the fact that this time the Party
was exceedingly late in coping with
the changed situation. For years its
most authoritative leadership had
been in jail or scattered, and the
Party as a whole subjected to the
most massive and brutal attack by
every agent of the capitalist class and
government.

Inevitably when the Party reas-
sembled its leadership at the begin-
ning of 1956, not all sectors, either
in the leadership or among the mem-
bership, fully or immediately real-
ized the gravity of the situation. To
be sure there were exaggerations
as regards some errors, and under-
estimation of the Party’s past achieve-
ments and positive role, but in time
the overwhelming majority of the
Party, despite its pride in its great
contributions and many achieve-
ments, had to face up to the crisis.
The above section of the resolution
adopted by overwhelming vote of the

 

THE COMMUNIST PARTY CONVENTION 7

convention shows that the Party was
ready to meet the situation.

# It It

Without recognition of the seri-
ousness of the situation it would
have been impossible to seek out its
deeper roots and to lay the basis for
overcoming it. In the year-long dis-
cussion and at the Convention there
were wide differences of emphasis
as to the causes, some laying the
stress on the objective situation and
the attacks against the Party, others
on the Party’s sectarian errors. The
resolution of the convention summed
it up as follows:

Was it inevitable that the Party
should become so isolated and suffer
such organizational and political losses
as it did? The answer must be NO.
Against the background of the objec-
tive situation and its consequences, the
errors and long-standing weaknesses
of our Party had a particularly dam-
aging effect. . . .

In correcting such errors, the
Resolution points out:

In our struggle for a mass policy
we base ourselves on the following
Marxist-Leninist propositions:

a) that both Left-sectarianism and
Right-opportunism have objective roots
in reality—in the system under which
we live;

b) that the struggle must be con-
ducted on both fronts, with the main
emphasis against that which threatens
the Marxist line of our Party at the
given moment.

The most important mistakes made
in the period under review were Left-
sectarian in character. These Left-sec-
tarian mistakes, in the context of sharp

attack against the Party, are the main
reason for the unprecedented degree
to which it was possible for Big Busi-
ness and its political representatives
to isolate the Party.

To end its isolation and expand its
mass work, the main task of the Party
today is to overcome completely the
inﬂuence of Left-sectarian estimates,
policies and tactics in all fields of
work.

In the process of carrying out the
main task, the Party must struggle
against existent Right-opportunist ten-
dencies, combatting them at all times.
This is especially necessary in view of
the extremely sharp turn which the
Party is now making in many of its
basic policies. The necessary struggle
against Right-opportunist errors must
be carried on in such a way as not to
weaken the main task.

The impact of the Khrushchev
revelations was a major factor
throughout the year-long discussion
that culminated in the Convention.
These revelations of the harmful ef-
fects of the Stalin policies over a
long period of time, only served to
emphasize what was becoming clear
to many in the Party—the need to put
an end to uncritical attitudes towards
the views of Marxists of other coun-
tries. Needless to say, the shocking
disclosures also had—if only tempor-
arily—a tendency to disorient some,
at the same time that they caused
many to deepen their thinking.

The heart of the Convention's
analysis as to the causes for the
“serious crisis of a political, ideo-
logical and organizational nature,”
that which constitutes the basis for
the “new course” and without which

 

8 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the crisis could not have been met,
is contained in the following pas-
sage of the resolution:

The roots of these errors are not to
be found in the events of the past ten
years alone.

The Marxist movement in our coun-
try has suffered historically from dog-
matic application of Marxist theory to
the American scene. The Communist
Party inherited these weaknesses. In-
sufﬁcient development of the indepen-
dent theoretical work of the Party over
the past decades has contributed to-
wards our doctrinaire acceptance and
mechanical application of many theo-
retical propositions.

Our Party also suffered from an
oversimpliﬁed approach to and un-
critical acceptance of many views of
Marxists and Marxist parties in other
countries.

Bureaucratic methods of leadership,

failure to develop inner-Party democ-

racy and a frequent intolerant attitude
to the people we worked with have
been in large measure responsible for
our inability to correct mistakes in
time as well as for much of our sec-
tarianism. All these factors are inter-
related; each helped to reinforce the
other.

This is far from a routine or su-
perﬁcial analysis. A careful study
of these conclusions and a review
of the Party's past experience will
show that here are some fundamen-
tal, new propositions. They serve to
explain why the Party has repeatedly
made the same mistakes and not
corrected them in time, and at the
same time provide the key to the suc-
cessful outcome of the Convention
and a substantial basis for facing the
future with conﬁdence.

This new approach is already em-
bodied in the Convention documents.
All the major decisions of the Con-
vention reﬂect this new thinking.
As regards the approach to theory
this can be seen in the Preamble to
the Party Constitution which states:

The Communist Party bases its the-
ory generally on the democratic heri-
tage of mankind and particularly on
the principles of scientiﬁc socialism
as developed by Karl Marx, Frederick
Engels and V. I. Lenin. These uni-
versally valid principles, the Commu-
nist Party of the U.S.A. interprets,
applies and strives to develop further
in accordance with the requirements
of the American class struggle, demo-
cratic traditions and customs.

As regards relationship to Marx-
ists of other countries, the resolution
declares:

. . . The Communist Party recog-
nizes that over the years it held cer-
tain wrong and oversimpliﬁed con-
cepts of what its relations should be
to other Marxist parties. The Party
tended to accept uncritically many
views of Marxists in other countries.
Not all these views were correct; some
did not correspond to American con-
ditions. The Party also viewed un-
critically developments in the Soviet
Union and other Socialist countries.
It mistakenly thought that any public
criticism of the views or policies of
the Marxist parties of these countries
would weaken the bonds of interna-
tional working-class solidarity or bring
comfort to the enemies of peace and
socialism.

In abandoning the earlier idealis-

THE COMMUNIST PARTY CONVENTION

tic and uncritical attitude towards
the lands of socialism, while recog-
nizing their historic role and achieve-
ments, the Party has strengthened
its ability to promote true proletar-
ian internationalism.

This new, creative approach and
broader understanding of theory has
already resulted in the elaboration
of many policies in a new way. The
new emphasis on peaceful coexist-
ence as a practical possibility has
broadened the approach to the strug-
gle for peace. The American Road
to Socialism, while put forward in
earlier years, including the idea of
peaceful transition, likewise takes on
more content and reality. The Party
now places the struggle for an anti-
monopoly coalition as its main stra-
tegic aim along that path. And from
such a coalition which could break
the power of the traditional ene-
mies of the American people—the
monopolies—-it believes the Ameri-
can people could advance in a con-
stitutional, democratic and peaceful
transition to socialism.

Addressing itself also to the prob-
lem of the uniﬁcation of progressive
and socia1ist—minded currents among
the American people, the Convention
also adopted a new attitude towards
social democracy, noting the differ-
entiation within its ranks, viewing
its supporters as potential allies in the
labor and anti-monopoly struggle in-
stead of, as in the past, as bearers
of a trend which was to be organiza-
tionally defeated and liquidated.

Likewise it recognized the possi-
bility of a number of parties of so-
cialism existing side by side and

  

9

aﬂirmed the perspective and aim of
an eventual united Marxist party of
socialism.
'I= ii I

To those who kept themselves
informed of the progress of the dis-
cussion, including the various ar-
ticles that have been published in
Political A ﬁairs, and have pondered
the sharp differences, the proposals
for far more drastic changes, and
on the other hand the charges of
revisionism, it may come as a sur-
prise that such a high degree of
unity was reached at the Conven-
tion. Certainly the enemies of the
Party had engaged in considerable
speculation on the inevitability of a
split at the Convention. At the same
time, within the Party, many had
feared that the Party would be li-
quidated in one form or another and
its basic theoretical foundation-
Marxism - Leninism — abandoned,
while others despaired of the ca-
pacity of the Party to break with its
old sectarian policies and practices
and chart a new course in line with
the needs of the present situation.

Some have drawn the conclusion
that there was no real unity achieved
but instead a compromise of prin-
ciple. We do not believe this is borne
out by the facts. If argument and
debate does not have the purpose
of reaching agreement through ar-
riving at a more correct and accept-
able view than that held previously
by each proponent, then what would
be the use of conventions and collec-
tive discussions altogether? Thus,
basing themselves on the main line
of the Draft Resolution, the Con-

 

 

    

IO

vention strengthened the Resolution,
rounding out certain propositions
which had tended towards one-sid-
edness. The new draft constitution
was also adopted with only minor
changes.

On the much-discussed question of
name and form, the Convention took
the following position:

This convention goes on record to
affirm the continuation of the Com-
munist Party of the U.S.A. Our chief
task is to strengthen, rebuild and con-
solidate the Communist Party and
overcome its isolation.

This convention opposes the trans-
formation of the Party into a political
or educational association.

Although we oppose endless debate
on this question, this should not close
the door to all constructive explora-
tion and discussion of the subject as
may be organized by the incoming Na-
tional Committee.

We recognize that some ideas have
been brought forward in this discus-
sion that are revisionist in character.
However, it would be wrong to label
all proposals for change in name and
form as revisionist per se.

These actions do not represent
compromise, but instead principled
agreement.

Not the least among the reasons
for the high degree of unity was the
conscious desire of the delegates to
unite the Party and avoid the dangers
of a split or of continuing factional-
ism. But the factors that made the
unity possible were: ﬁrst, the new
approach to theory which loosened
the rigidity with which the member-
ship had been trained to regard theo-

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

retical and political questions; sec-
ond, the opportunity in the course
of the discussion to test ideas against
the events actually transpiring in the
world; and third, the growing demo-
cratization of the Party which had
already been under way in the course
of the whole discussion Without
waiting for its practices to be for-
malized in the new constitution at
the convention.

Thus, the lengthy discussion had
been the most democratic in the
Party’s history and the Convention
in which it culminated was likewise
the most democratic ever held by
the Party. It was the democratic
character of the convention that
made the biggest impression upon the
non- Communist observers who,
while having reservations and mixed
opinions on other aspects, bore wit-
ness publicly to its democracy.

The early announcement that the
constitution would formalize the
right of dissent likewise played a
major role in encouraging the mem-
bership to examine all questions
boldly, free from a dogmatic or doc-
trinaire approach, testing their opin-
ions in life and recognizing the pos-
sibility of honest differences on ques-
tions within a united Party. The
new Constitution conﬁrmed and
guaranteed the advances in inner-
Party democracy. This was further
demonstrated in the direct repre-
sentation in the national leadership
given to the State organizations.

The Convention, by its very na-
ture and the issues that had to be de-
bated and settled in a short four
days, was unable to give adequate

 

THE COMMUNIST PARTY CONVENTION

attention to a proposed program of
action or to the tasks in connection
with saving the Marxist press, es-
pecially the Daily Worker and the
Worker. Nevertheless the various
resolutions and documents adopted
by the Convention add up to a gen-
eral program of struggle. This is
true regarding the general line to-
wards an anti—monopoly coalition,
the resolution in support of the his-
toric struggle of the Negro people

for freedom and equality, and the c

resolution in support of labor’s strug-
gle for improved economic condi-
tions.

That these struggles are growing
in dimensions needs no extended
demonstration. The struggle in the
South is taking on new features as
the white supremacists more and
more find their legal resources ex-
hausted, and move in the direction
of increasing violence. In regard to
this question the Convention in nu-
merous ways dramatized its empha-
sis on the task of winning full citi-
zenship for the Negro people in the
South as the Nation’s Number One

- Democratic Task. A new and broad

anti-labor offensive is shaping up in
state and national legislation and
the demonstration of 10,000 workers
from all over the state at Indianapo-
lis, shows that labor, even if belat-
edly, is beginning to mobilize. The
recent farmers’ strike in the New
York milk—shed has again drama-
tized the chronic depressed situation
of the farmers. The events of Aca-
demic Freedom Week show a new

stirring among the students.

The decisions of the Convention,
when mastered by the leadership and
membership of the Party, should
equip them to give support to these
and kindred struggles in a new way,
that will ultimately result in the
overcoming of the Party’s isolation
from the basic organizations of la-
bor and the people. The struggle
against right-to-work laws, the issues
arising from the Senate labor investi-
gations, the struggle in the South
and the ﬁght for civil rights legisla-
tion, are all ﬁelds where the Party
can doubtless play a constructive,
vanguard role.

Many questions brought up in the
course of the discussion, of course,
remained unresolved. Some of the
theoretical questions will undoubt-
edly receive further study in prepara-
tion for the Party program that is to
be worked out in the coming year.
Others will, of course, be the subject
of continued examination in theory
and practice by the organizations of
the Party. But it seems clear that
the Party has taken a decisive step
forward in grappling with the new
situation and has taken the correct
road towards re-establishing its posi-
tion as an American Marxist work-
ing-class party dedicated to socialism
and re-establishing its ties with the
labor and people’s movement. In this
as in its entire work, we believe
the Convention has made a contribu-
tion to the American working class
and people. ’

Greetings!

I The National Committee summons the Communist Party of the USA
L to its 16th’ National Convention in New York City on February 9 — I2,
1957-

This convention takes place against the background of profound change
on the world scene and many favorable developments at home.

A new world situation and a new relationship of forces have come
into being. America is part of this vast process of change. A gigantic
united labor movement has been born, a tower of growing strength in
the whole democratic struggle. The Negro people are on the march as
they have not been since Reconstruction days. Together with many white
citizens they are writing new irnperishable pages in the history of the ﬁght
for American "freedom. Atomic energy and new technological develop-
ments are revealing unprecedented possibilities of peaceful progress and a
I life of abundance for all.

Monopoly capital in the United States presses its onslaught against the
living standards of our countrymen, against the dignity and freedom of
the Negro and other peoples victimized by racist oppression, against the
Bill of Rights and true representative government; but the democratic
labor and people’s forces of America are moving forward with a power
and tempo that assure the triumph of freedom and security in our land.

The American people stand on the threshold of great democratic ad-
vance. In crossing this threshold——and it can be crossed only by the most
determined and united struggle——there is lost ground to be recovered as
well as ground to be won. There are new vistas of peace; of a successful
struggle against poverty and economic insecurity; of progress in housing,

12

 

 

CALL TO THE 16th NATIONAL CONVENTION 13
health and education; of securing full citizenship for the Negro people,
undoing the evils of McCarthyism and Eastlandism, and achieving new
gains for democracy.

As we look back to December 1950 when the last convention of the
Communist Party was held, we can see how far our country and the
world have moved. Yet, despite this favorable new situation our Party
will not be able to play its role unless it corrects past errors and strength-
ens its ties with the American working-class and people’s movement. Our
Party is at the most critical juncture of its history.

Largely in response to these developments as well as the revelations
of serious Aweaknesses and injustices in the Socialist world, the entire
membership of our Party is engaged in spirited debate around our theory,
policies, program and organizational forms.

The Constitution of our Party provides that “Regular National Con-
ventions shall be held every two years.” However, the sustained repressive
measuresdirected against our Party during recent years, in violation of
our country’s Constitution and Bill of Rights, have made it impossible
for us to hold a regular convention since 1950. The decision to call this
16th National Convention was made by unanimous vote of the National
Committee at its meeting in August, 1956.

In preparation for the coming convention, the fullest democratic dis-
cussion should be organized in all Districts, leading Committees and
Clubs. The National Draft Resolution and other pre-Convention ma-
terials should be given the widest possible distribution among all mem-
bers, and also among other workers who are or have been in close associa-
tion with our Party. Special means should be devised to assure that the

    

opinions of those unable to attend Party meetings are registered in the

discussions.

In accord with provisions of our Party’s Constitution (Article III, Sec.
4; Article IV, Sec. 1; Article VII, Sec. 2), representation at the 16th Na-
tional Convention shall be on the following basis:

I) Delegates shall be elected on the basis of membership, to be
determined by average dues payments through the first ten
months of 1956 (i.e., through October). Dues standing for this
period will be determined on January 1st. Special provision
will be made to allot added delegates on the basis of further
dues payments for this 10-month period which are received
prior to February 1st. Delegates to the National Convention
shall have been members in continuous good standing for at
least two years.

2) Each District Party organization shall be entitled to elect:

a) 2 delegates where the total membership is 50 or less;

b) 3 delegates for the first I00 members, and 3 for each
additional I00 members up to 600; and

c) 2 delegates for each additional 100 members above 600.

3) In the case of Districts which are ﬁnancially unable to send their
full complement of delegates to the Convention, the number
of votes to which each such District is entitled shall be divided
among those of its delegates who attend, in such manner as
the District Convention shall decide.

4) Each District shall have the right to elect alternate delegates,
with voice but without vote. The number of such alternates shall
not exceed 25 percent of the total number of delegates to which
the District is entitled.

5) In order to help defray the expenses of the National Convention,
at Convention assessment shall be levied on each Party member
as follows: $2.00 for employed members; 50c for unemployed
members and housewives.

District Party organizations shall determine the time, place and basis
of representation for the local conventions (i.e., section, region, county,
state, etc.) to be held within their several Districts. It is recommended
that Section and District conventions be held, as a minimum; and that
District conventions take place no later than the weekend of Ianuary 26th.

All Sections and District conventions shall be held in two parts-one
prior to and the other after the National Convention. Part I, prior to the
National Convention, shall be devoted to discussion of the Draft Resolu-
tion and supplementary documents, evaluation of the work and leadership
of the Party organization involved, and election of delegates. Part II, after
the National Convention, shall be devoted to discussion of reports on the
National Convention, setting forth perspectives of work, and election of
leadership.

The problems confronting our Party are formidable; but they can be
solved. We are conﬁdent that our members, who have shown exemplary
devotion and courage during these trying years, will be fully able to cope
with the tasks our Party must now undertake.

February 9-12, 1957

Sessions of the Convention

OPENING Sr.ss1oN
February 9, 1957

Fred Fine, C/mirman, Pre-Com/em
tion Arrangements Committee, in
the Chair.

Chairman: The Convention will
come to order. We will open our
proceedings with the singing of the
Star Spangled Banner. [The dele-
gates join in singing the National
Anthem.] We would now like to call
upon the Chairman of the host state
organization, the New York state or-
ganization of our Party, to make a
few welcoming remarks. Comrade
George Blake Charney, Chairman of
the New York District and a Smith
Act defendant. (Applause)

George Blake Clzamey (New
York): Comrade delegates and
guests, I have the honor on behalf
of the Communist Party of New
York and as the gray-bearded
patriarch of the organization, to
welcome you to our 16th National
Convention. I would it were the

mayor of our city who would per-
form this honor. But after recent ex-
periences in our town I am afraid it
would create some confusion here
and in Washington and serve no use-
ful purpose.

Were we in City Hall, we would
welcome all those heroes of Spain
and its noble Republican fighters,
and not the agents of Franco. Yes, we
would greet King Saud——and not on
behalf of the oil trusts—as did our
President but with the aim of fos-
tering the aspirations of the peoples
of the Middle East for peace and na-
tional independence, and to give
our maximum encouragement to
achieve friendly relations between
the Arab nations and Israel so that
both can prosper.

I said if we were in City Hall. We
are not. Time was, as you comrades
recall, when we had two Commu-
nists in the City Council who per-
formed their duties with great dis-
tinction and authority. I refer to Ben
Davis and Pete Cacchione. (Ap-

plause.) I venture the prediction,
comrades, that time will be again
when Communists will sit in the
legislative bodies of our country,
serve as leaders of the trade union
movement and in the people's organ-
izations, and serve as honored lead-
ers of our community.

We of New York are a great
metropolitan community, responsive
to every development the world over
and especially the yearning for a
stable and lasting peace. We are a
community because of the very
nature of our city with its large
working class population, national-
ity and religious ties, its great center
of Negro life and culture in Harlem

and Bedford-Stuyvesant, its millions

of Iewish people, the expanding
Puerto Rican community, large seg-
ments of all groups moving forward
at times together in the ﬁght for
democracy‘ and better living. ' .

On behalf of the New York dele-
gates and our entire membership I
extend the warmest welcome to the
delegates. I hope that at our next
convention the delegates will be
handed the keys to the City of Chi-
cago by our fellow delegate from
that great city, and its distinguished
citizen, Claude Lightfoot. Thank
you.

Chairman: In our efforts to keep
the proceedings as streamlined as
possible so that we may get to the
bulk of our convention business with

despatch, I will introduce without
further ado, the National Chairman
of our Communist Party, Comrade
Wm. Z. Foster, to oﬂicially open the
convention.

Wm. Z. Foster: Comrades, the
16th National Convention of the
Communist Party of the United
States is oﬂicially declared open. My
remarks are going to be very brief.
It seems to me that this is one of the
most important conventions our
Party has ever held, and I think we
are all of that opinion. There is just
one thing that is happening in con-
nection with this convention that I
think we’d all do well to pay atten-
tion to. And that is the extreme im-
portance with which the bourgeois
press of the country is handling this
convention. Now there's a lesson in
that for us and the big lesson it
seems to me is that these people real-
ize how tremendously important our
Communist Party is here in the
United States in spite of our recent
reverses. I think in fact in this res-
pect they have a more lively appre-
ciation of the importance of our
Party than some of us ourselves do.
Comrades, you want to hear one
thing in mind. The Communist
Party is not just another Party. The
Communist Party is a very vital insti-
tution and is part of the whole World
movement which is building social-
ism in the world.

That’s how they look upon us.

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

Even in this great stronghold of
capitalism they know how vitally
important the Communist Party is.
Of course the bourgeois press is doing
its best to disorganize and confuse
our ranks, sort of bore from within
or without, to try to disrupt us with
all sorts of fantastic stories about
pro-Stalin groups and anti-Moscow
groups and» what not. But I’m sure
we’re not going to be disoriented by
such stuff. And another thing they’re
very anxious about in connection
with this convention is to see that
our Party is split at this convention.
They’re hoping for that. Nothing
could please the bourgeoisie of Amer-
ica more than for a split to take
place in the ranks of the Communist
Party. That would indeed be a real
victory for them. I think I can ex-
press the opinion of everybody here
that there is not going to be any split
at this convention (applause).
Comrades, in conclusion, let me
just say this. This convention I be-
lieve is going to take long steps to-
wards clarifying the matters we have
been discussing over the past year
and undoubtedly will go down in
the record of our Party as a unity
convention. I think this is the sense
in which we should carry on our
work in the convention (applause).
C/2.: At this point, on behalf of
the conventions arrangement com-
mittee I think the convention would
want to join with the National Com-
mittee in expressing its appreciation

 

I7

to the management of this hall for
having rendered a service to the con-
stitutional liberties of all Americans
by making this hall available to our
convention at a time when over I00
diﬁerent hotels and halls in the City
of New York refused to give a lease
for our convention. I propose that
we express our appreciation (ap-
plause). At this time it would be
customary to read the oﬂicial Call to
the 16th National Convention of the
Communist Party, U.S.A.""

A motion has been made and sec-
onded that we dispense with the
reading of the Call due to the fact
that all delegates here have read the
content. Are we ready to vote? The
question has been called. [Vote
taken.] So ordered.

At this time I want to introduce
the Temporary Rules Committee
which has been functioning in the
last couple of days on the eve of the
convention making the necessary
preliminary preparations for today's
organizing session. The co-chairmen
of the temporary Rules Committee
are Comrade Carl Winter, the State
Chairman of the Party of the state
of Michigan, and Comrade Claude
Lightfoot, the State Chairman of the
Party of the state of Illinois. Together
with these two comrades the com-
mittee consists of Comrade Benjamin
J. Davis of our National Committee,
Comrade George Blake Charney,

r8 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

Comrade Sid Stein, and Comrade
Fred Fine (myself). I ask that this
committee step forward and that
Comrade Winter take over for the
rest of our business.

Carl Winter (Michigan): Com-
rades, I should like to propose, ﬁrst,
the election of a chairman for this
organizing session of our convention.
The Temporary Rules Committee
puts in nomination the name of the
State Chairman of the Illinois Party,
Comrade Claude Lightfoot. The
proposal has been moved and sec-
onded. [Vote taken.] The motion
is carried.

(Claude Lightfoot, Illinois in the
Chair.)

Chairman: Comrades, the ﬁrst or-
der of business will be a report for

the Temporary Rules Committee by

Comrade Winter.

Winter: Comrades, there are many
aspects to this report which we will
ask you to act ‘upon seriatim. The
Temporary Rules Committee has
made every effort possible, after dis-
cussion with many of the heads of
delegations, and others from the
various parts of the country, to or-
ganize this convention in the most
eﬂicient manner possible so that we
may have the maximum discussion
on the political problems which we
are here to solve. The personnel for
various committees results from a
canvass of delegations and a careful
consideration of both the need for

expediting work and of guaranteeing
the maximum expression of various
points of view on questions that will
be under discussion. I should like
ﬁrst to propose that we elect a par-
liamentarian who will help us in the
solution of any knotty problems that
will arise in the operation of the con—
vention. We propose the election as
parliamentarian throughout this con—
vention of Nat Ganley of the Michi-
gan district.

Ch.: [Motion made, seconded and
carried unanimously] So ordered.
Will the parliamentarian take his
place.

Winter: Secondly, we propose the
election of four tellers for the count-
ing of record votes, namely, Phil
Shatz of Michigan, Lester Davis of
Illinois, George Sandy of New Jer-
sey and Robert of New York.
I move the election of these four tel-
lers. [Vote taken — unanimous.]
The committee proposes four con-
vention secretaries—-they are Esther
E. (New York), Geraldine Light-
foot (Illinois), John Hellman (Mon-
tana), and Anna Correa (Colorado).
I move the election of these four
secretaries.

Ch.: Is there a second to the mo-
tion? [Vote taken — unanimous.]
So ordered. Will the secretaries take
their places.

Winter: The Committee now

moves the seating of all delegates
who have been admitted to the con-

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

vention floor with oﬂicial delegates
cards to participate as temporarily
seated delegates until this convention
hears and acts upon the official Cre-
dentials Committee report.

C}z.: Is there a second to the mo-
tion? Any discussion? [Vote taken
—unanimous.]

Winter: Now I should like to call
your attention to the fact that each
delegate has received in his kit of
convention material a copy of the
proposed convention agenda and
rules. It should be noted in consider-
ing the rules and agenda that the
plans for this convention have been
made with a view to assuring the
maximum possible participation of
all delegates through the convening
of large committee sessions for ex-
change of opinion and formulation
of proposals relative to the main sec-
tions of the Draft Resolution and
main features of the Draft Constitu-
tion, which have been discussed
thruout the Party these past several
months. The convention will hold
general sessions with all delegates
participating simultaneously for the
purpose of hearing reports based
upon these committee discussions,
and will act upon ﬁnal questions to

~ determined by the convention as
a whole, in these general sessions.
The main work of this convention
however, is to take place in these
committee meetings, which should

distill the best thinking of our Party

I9

as represented through the delegates
and present conclusions for the
action of the convention as a whole.
Each delegation will have the task
of apportioning its members among
the various committees.

Now before we proceed to act
upon the proposed agenda I should
now like to read on behalf of the
Committee the Rules which it pro-
poses shall govern the operation of
all sessions. You have a copy in your
kit, of the proposed rules:

Winter: Now comrade chairman,
I should like to propose the adoption
of these rules, as proposed, by the
Temporary Rules Committee.

PROPOSED RULES

1. The Convention shall be called to order
at 10 a.m. on each of the four days. There
shall be two sessions on Saturday—one

day-——moming, afternoon and evening;
and two sessions on Tuesday, the conclud-
ing day, with the aim of adjouming at

6 pm.

Sessions shall be from 10 to 1:30; 2:30
to 6; and 7 to 10 p.m.

2. Main body of hall reserved for delegates
and alternates; visitors occupy rear of

al .

3. Delegates desiring to speak shall come
to floor microphones and will be recognized
by the chairman in order of appearance,

delegations and the credentials committee,

 

    

 

20 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

accredited alternate delegates may sub-
stitute for regular delegates absent. In all
other cases, accredited alternates shall
have voice but no vote in general and
committee sessions. On major questions
votes will be tallied by the chairman of
each delegatio~n——for, against and absten-
tions, and the delegation chairman will re-
port the vote to the tellers. Suspension
of Convention rules requires a two-thirds
vote.

5. All resolutions must be submitted to
the appropriate committee by 2 p.m.,
Saturday, Feb. 9th. No Resolutions can
be submitted directly to the ﬂoor without
having been acted upon by the appropriate
convention committee ﬁrst.

6. A motion shall not be open for discus-
sion until it has been seconded by a dele-
gate and stated from the Chair.

7. A motion to lay on the table shall not
be debatable.

A motion to reconsider shall not be en-
tertained unless by a delegate who voted
in the majority, and shall receive a major-
ity vote.

Previous question shall be decided by
majority voice vote.

No motion, or resolution shall be voted
upon until the mover or the introducer

has had a chance to speak, if he or she

desires.

8. Amendments. No amendment can be ac-
cepted by the Chair which changes the
basic intent of the main motion. Any pro-
posal that conﬁicts with the intent of the
main motion of a reporting sub-committee
shall be submitted through the appropriate
convention sub-committee as an alternative
proposal with the agreement and consent
of the majority of the delegates.

9. When a motion is pending before the
Convention, no motion shall be in order
except to adjourn, to refer, for the previous
question, to postpone indeﬁnitely, to post-
pone for a certain time, to divide or amend,
which motions shall have precedence in
the order named.

10. No proxy votes will be recognized. In
accordance with the National Convention
Call, the total vote of a State delegation
shall be equally divided among all at-
tending delegates for the purpose of voting
at general sessions, in those cases where
ﬁnancial limitations prevent full attend-
ance. In all other cases, there shall be one
vote for attending delegates .or properly
accredited alternates replacing delegates.

11. The convention will not recognize I-11.7
unit rule and will function on the. basis
that all delegates in attendance, while re-
porting the thinking and decisions of their
own state conventions, are expected to -ar-
rive at their independent conclusions on
the basis both of the discussions in their
parent organizations, as well as by the
discussion at this convention. _
12. The Convention shall elect a parlia-
mentarian, four secretaries and f_our tellers
to serve throughout the convention, and a
chairman for each session.

13. At the time when the convention agenda
is adopted provisions will be made for a
number of special orders of business which
shall take precedence at the speciﬁed
time over any other business that may be
before the house.

14. Supplementary rules will be introduced
on the elections procedure when the con-
vention comes to that order of business.
15. Roberts Rules of Order shall guide
procedure on all points not covered by the
rules that have been adopted.

C/1.: Comrades, when you Want the
floor, ask for it, because two or three
people can start talking at the same
time. I recognize the delegate at this
end.

Bob (California): I’d like to propose
that the rules be taken up seriatim, to
avoid a great number of amendments.

Ch.: Comrades, this convention can
do whatever you wish but I would like
to caution the convention not to get
hung up on a thousand and one little
details but that we get down to the
most pressing things that we’ve all
come here to do. We may ﬁnd that
we’ll be unable to conclude the busi-
ness of this convention. Now it’s up
to you to decide, but I want to urge
restraint on some of these problems
that are not necessarily principled
questions.

Archie (California): I want a couple
of points of information. First of all

 

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

can the reporter for the presiding com-
mittee give us information on minority
reports? What’s the score on that?

Winter: The way in which the
agenda is outlined, reports will come
before this body on behalf of the vari-
ous sub—committees and committees
that were listed. Those committees
will decide on the report to be present-
ed to the convention. In the event that
they should find it impossible to agree
upon a report by majority vote, they
have it in their power to decide on a
minority report as well as a majority
report and to designate the reports.
But it is in the hands of the various
committees to decide what type of re-
port will be submitted to the full ses-
sion.

C/1.: Is there a second to the motion?
On the amendment. It’s been moved
and seconded. We’ll act on the amend-
ment ﬁrst. State your motion, Archie,
and hereafter, will the delegates state
their names and the state they are from.

Archie: I’d like to amend the rules as
follows: The amendment is that the
minority report shall follow the major-
ity report from each subcommittee
when such notice has been given in the
committee that a minority report is
going to be made.

C 11.: Is the amendment clear to every-
body now? [Vote taken.] The amend-
ment is carried.

Archie: Comrade Chairman, I have
another amendment if I’m in order,
on the question of the Rules. My other
amendment has to do with Rule 8, re-
garding any proposal that conﬂicts with
the intent of the main motion, accord-

ing to this rule has to be referred back

    

21

to the appropriate sub—commitee. I
would like to amend the rules, com-
rade chairman, to the effect that sub-
stitutes for the whole on any particular
resolution shall be entertained if and
when the main motion is voted down.

Ch.: Is there a second to the amend-
ment? Seconded. Does the co-chainnan
want to comment?

Bernie (New York): Mr. Chairman,
on the amendment. I would like to
speak against it.

C /2.: Comrades, the chair at this time
would like some advice from the con-
vention. If on these procedural ques-
tions we have endless debate, we will
not get down to business. I would like
to entertain a motion that on these ques-
tions we allow a maximum of 3 min-
utes and 2 for and 2 against. The mo-
tion is made and seconded. [Vote
taken.] So ordered. The comrade has
the ﬂoor.

Bernie: I’m very much concerned by
that change of rules which permits the
introduction of a complete substitute,
that it has a tendency to negate the
work of the subcommittees which have
gone on for a matter of days and hours
in bringing their resolutions to the ﬂoor
and represent the combined think-
ing of everybody participating in these
committees. Therefore, I think that we
ought to go along with the rules sug-
gested by the Temporary Rules Com-
mittee and that is that nothing can be
introduced as an amendment which
contradicts the main intent of the
original motion.

AZ (New York): For the‘ amend-
ment. I ‘had intended to make the same
amendment. I haven't been in any

 

 

    

22

committee meetings so I believe I should
have the right to participate in whatever
the committee decides. It’s my opinion
that when there is a resolution on the
ﬂoor and there’s a discussion and a
number of amendments made, a sub-
stitute for the whole cannot be referred
to any committee but must be acted
upon by the entire convention. I have
never heard of such a procedure where
a substitute is sent to committee and I
am fully in favor of the amendment
because I think that anything else
would violate the democratic right of
this convention to act on such a motion.

C}z.: Is there another speaker
against?

Sid (Upstate New York): I would
like to make the point that if a com-
mittee after long discussion in subcom-
mittee as a delegated committee of this
body cannot reach agreement on a
formulation, it seems a little bit dif-
ﬁcult that one person acting alone shall
draw up a resolution on the ﬂoor be-
fore this body without discussion and
have that as the intent of this whole
convention. If a committee of delegates
can’t do it, I am quite sure no single
individual will be able to do it.

Archie: Comrades, I think we can
combine the speeding through of this
convention with the democratic expres-
sion of the will of this body and when
the committees come in and the report
ﬁnds favor with the majority of the del-
egates, why that’s it. It’s only if it does
not ﬁnd favor with the delegates, only
then can a person introduce a resolu-
tion and then as far as time is con-
cerned, once such a resolution is
introduced, why this body can limit

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the debate. That wouldn’t take too long
and you can vote it up or down with
dispatch. And this is the democratic
way to do it and fulﬁll everything that
we are trying to accomplish at this
convention.

C}i.: The chair recognizes the co-
chairman of the Rules Committee.

Winter: May I say on behalf of the
Rules Committee, that the purpose of
this provision in Rule 8 is related to
any proposal that conﬂicts with the in-
tent of the main motion. This is
normal, parliamentary procedure so
that the device of substitutes may not
replace the right of the convention to
vote a proposition down. If the conven-
tion wishes to act contrary to a motion
before it, it votes No. It doesn’t come
up with a new proposition and start
the discussion or the voting all over
again. However, we do not want to
prevent consideration of such negating
propositions. Rather we prefer that
they be sent back to the committee to
consider if there is some sentiment for
that. The committee regards this as
the most democratic and the most ex-
peditious procedure.

C/i.: You've heard the pros and cons
on the amendment. Are you prepared
to vote? All those in favor of the
amendment as read by Delegate Archie:
“After the main motion has been
voted down by the majority of the
Convention, then a substitute for the
whole shall be entertained”—Is that
clear to everybody? [Vote taken.] The
amendment is carried.

Winter: I now move on behalf of
the Temporary Rules Committee the
adoption of the proposed agenda.

6:00 ADJOURN

Ben Daz/is: Comrades, I am propos-
ing a change in the agenda which will
cover this afternoon's session. It is pro-
posed on the agenda that we would
have the speeches of Comrade Dennis
and Comrade Foster and then the dele-
gations would adjourn to committees.

    

24

Now I want to make an amendment
to it. I propose that after the speeches
of Comrade Foster and Comrade Den-
nis, this body shall have an opportunity
for a plenary or a general discussion
on the question of the Draft Resolution
as a whole and on the question of the
reports of Comrade Foster and Com-
rade Dennis.

I would say in support of this that it
is only fair that I should tell the com-
rades that this was considered by the
outgoing National Committee and this
proposition was lost. But I felt it suf-
ﬁciently serious to bring it before this
body. And my reason for doing so is
that I consider after two important re-
ports by Comrade Dennis and Com-
rade Foster, there should be opportun-
ity to discuss them on the part of the
delegates, maybe I0 or I2 delegates or
so.
Secondly, that the delegates should
have an opportunity to discuss the Res-
olution as a whole. Now when you
get this Resolution to discuss, it's going
to come out in piecemeal fashion. That
is, various subcommittees will report
on various sections of the Resolution.
Now I think that the delegates in addi-
tion to this should have the opportunity
to discuss the Resolution as a whole, to
express themselves on it, and in that
way this will not at all detract from
the ‘business of this convention but this
will give the delegates further expres-
sions from other delegates on how they
shall add and implement this discus-
sion in the various committees. Now I
consider that extremely important and
I would like to hear the opinion of the
delegates on this question and I think

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

it should be considered in that light.

Ch.: The amendment has been sec-
onded. In accordance with thc H116 that
you have made, two for and two
against.

Sid Stein: Comrades, this proposi-
tion was considered in the National
Committee, as Comrade Davis told you.
It was also considered in the Resolu-
tions Committee with the participation
of some 15 comrades from various dis-
tricts. The problem that it poses was
faced up to on the basis of the experi-
ence of the various state conventions.
And I want to give you some of the
thinking that went into this proposal,
both in the N. C. and in the Resolu-
tions Committee.

We felt that we have had in the
Party many months of discussion on
the Resolution. We have received hun-
dreds of resolutions from the state or-
ganizations, county organizations and
Party clubs, which express the views
of a cross section of the Party on the
resolution. We have honored these and
we have divided them according to
subject amongst the subcommittees and
they -will be given due consideration.
The convention as a whole and every
delegate here under the agenda propos-
ed will have the opportunity to discuss
both the specific questions under each
section as well as the general resolution.
At the end of our discussion on the
speciﬁcs, we will then have an oppor-

tunity to speak and to vote on the gen- .

eral.

The reason for it is, comrades, that
we have found in many state conven-
tions amendments to the resolution,
changes in the resolution, helped the

 

SESSIONS OF_ THE CONVENTION

comrades to unite and act upon the res-
olution based upon the changes made.
Therefore to discuss it first in general
and amend it later does not provide a
discussion that leads to decision on the
speciﬁc.

Further, the reports that are going
to be made here are not really reports.
They are not to be voted upon ‘by this
convention. This convention will vote
upon the resolution, not the reports.
We feel this will provide the widest
range of democratic discussion, and the
best opportunity to come to united de-
cisions on the question before the con-
vention. (Applause.)

Paul (New York): I rise to speak in
favor of the amendment oﬁered by
comrade Davis because I feel very
strongly that the rank and ﬁle of the
Party throughout the country should
have the opportunity in plenary ses-
sion to discuss their views and experi-
ences thru their state conventions, dis-
cuss speciﬁc examples and specific ex-
periences relating to the general ap-
proach of the draft resolution as a
whole, to be able to discuss major ques-
tions involving the vital content of the
line of our Party and the structure of
our Party against the background of
the two reports that are going to be
given by Comrade Dennis and Com-
rade Foster. I think that such a gen-
eral discussion would help to clarify
the comrades from all different parts
of the country as to the experiences and
feelings of the delegates of the various
states, give them a picture of the ap-
proaches of the various state conven-
tions and would serve as an overall aid
to the committee discussions.

    

25

I think it would help to expedite the
work of the committees, not in the
sense of coming to a conclusion con-
cerning the draft resolution considering
speciﬁcs, but to serve as a general back-
ground for the work and discussions
of the various committees. I think that
it would provide at the outset of the
convention the expression of the rank
and ﬁle comrades on the reports on the
Draft Resolution as a whole. I think it
would be a good and proper way to
start off the convention by allowing a
maximum of rank and ﬁle expression
on the basic issues as a whole.

Clz.: Comrade Paul referred to the
addresses as reports. I would like to
clarify. They are not reports. They are
addresses. One is a keynote by Com-
rade Dennis and the other is remarks
by Comrade Foster, who is National
Chairman of our Party. Iust want you
to get this point clear.

Bill Lawrence (New York): With
all due respect to Comrade Davis, I rise
to speak against the amendment for
the following reasons: First of all, the
proposed convention agenda proposes
reports from the respective subcommit-
tees which embrace all of the funda-
mental questions that we might differ
on or are anxious to exchange opinions
on. Hence, I believe that this conven-
tion as a general assembly will not only
have an opportunity to discuss, vote and
act on the respective fundamental ques-
tions, but will be able to act and dis-

cuss based on thorough discussion in ‘
the respective sub-committees; Second,
I believe inasmuch as the keynote ad-
dress and the remarks by Comrade
Foster are of a general character and

 

  

26

 
 

not reports in the sense that we under-
stand, and because we will have the
opportunity to discuss the various ques-
tions from the respective sub-commit-
tees, I am opposed to the amendment.

Finally, I believe that the proposal
as submitted by the Rules Committee
will provide greater democratic dis-
cussion, a more uniﬁed convention and
an opportunity for all the delegates,
particularly thru the medium of the
sub-committees as well as the general
assembly to take part in the various
questions as reported by the subcom-
mittees. ‘

C/1.: The chair proceeding under the
ruling of 2 for and 2 against, unless it
is otherwise the desire of this conven-
tion, will proceed to take the vote.

Milford (Washington): Point of In-
formation. Comrade Stein in explain-
ing his position on this question indi-
cates that after the various sections of
the resolution have been discussed,
that there will be opportunity in the
convention to discuss the resolution as
a whole. Yet in going over the agenda,
I ﬁnd no such place on the agenda,
and I would like to know what the
thinking is in connection with where
this is to be discussed on this agenda.
It would affect the question of how I
would vote if I knew where this was
to be discussed.

C/2.: Comrade Stein or Comrade
Winter, do you wish to clarify this
point?

Winter: Following action by the con-
vention on the reports from the various
subcommittees on the Resolution or on
the Constitution, it will be the property
of this convention. The convention

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

having heard and acted upon the re-
ports from the various sub—comrnittees
will then have a total picture before
it of what the Constitution looks like,
what the Resolution looks like and will
then be able to make whatever motions
it cares to make as to its disposition
of the document as a whole. Discussion
will proceed at the time that any such
motions are made. There is only a
leeway of one and a half hours in the
present agenda as proposed for such
general discussion not otherwise pro-
vided for.

Al (New York): I heard from the
chair that on the various reports of
subcommittees, there will be no action,

just discussion. No provision for action. .

C/2.: No one said that. There will be
action on the subcommittee reports.

Al: Well, I propose that that be in-
cluded on the agenda.

C}2.: It’s in the report, Comrade Al.
You misunderstood the report then.

C /2.: The previous question has been
moved and seconded. We are acting on
the previous question—that is to close
the debate on the amendment that was
proposed. The motion is carried. Now
the vote is on the amendment. All those
in favor of the amendment—that there
be general omnibus discussion follow-
ing the two speeches by Comrades Den-
nis and Foster. That’s the amendment.
Now all those in favor of this amend-
ment: 87—opposed; 62—for. ‘The
amendment is lost.

Tom Dennis (Michigan): I have just
one proposed change in the agenda and
that is that the report o-f the Credentials
Committee be moved up to Sunday morn-
ing because no delegates are actually of-
ﬁcially seated until that report comes in.

 

It-Irlﬂ-I‘:-J‘:-Gwen’-—G'f|6‘I

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

It doesn't come in till late Monday after-
noon and we will have acted on a whole
series of resolutions, changes, etc., and
I know there may be some people who
may have to leave before that and will
leave without ever having been seated
oﬁicially as delegates. So I propose that it
be moved up to Sunday morning so that
that can be done.

Ch.: Does the Rules Committee want to
accept the amendment? Yes. [Vote taken
——carried.]

Mollie West (Illinois): Comrades, I'd
like to propose a certain change in
the order of b-usiness to move up the
special order of business of the report
of the Elections Committee and discussion
to early Monday afternoon because a num-
ber of delegations have certain comrades
who must be back and who certainly can-
not stay any later than Monday night.
This being such an important order of
business I feel it should be so moved up.

Ch.: Would the co-chairman of the Rules
Committee like to accept that amendment?
Unless there is any strong opposition to it,
I’ll put it to a vote. The motion is we
move up the elections to Monday after-
noon some time in order to enable dele-
gates who may have to leave for work
or other considerations to be able to par-
ticipate.

Bill S. (New York): Comrades, I can

understand the feeling of the comrades.’

But we are going to elect pilots to navi-
gate a ship on a course that has been laid
out over some period of time on Marxism
and Leninism, and we’re going to have a
crew. Now I think it’s absolutely neces-
sary that the comrades have an opportunity
to know the qualiﬁcations, the leanings
and the capabilities, of that crew's leaders
before they have an opportunity to vote
for it. So it’s necessary for some of these
committees to report back and have a dis-

cussion that these comrades will know

how to really vote, and therefore I'm
against moving it up unless some provi-
sions could be made for full discussion on
the draft resolution and the people we are
going to vote on.

h: The chair would like to have a
motion to clarify the intent.

Mollie West: Comrades, my motion was
to move up the special order of business-
report of Elections Committee and Discus-
sion to be followed by the district delega-
tions meetings earlier Monday in order to

  

27

give every delegate an opportunity *9 3‘
least discuss it if they can’t stay for the
actual voting. Now if it’s possible to have
the whole elections business taken care
of Monday, alright, but at least that much
in my opinion has to be moved up. .

Fred Fine: I think that there is nothing
wrong with the motion except for one
thing, which I hope all the delegates_un-
derstand. The report of the Elections
Committee can only properly take place
and be acted upon by the Convention after
the Constitution is adopted. In other words
you could push it up at best about an
hour and a half or so, maybe two hours
but you would have to first act on the Con-
stitution.

Ch.: I propose that you make a motion
to accept the limitation and move it up
in accordance with that.

Hank (New York): I’d like to speak
against the proposed amendment. I am
not denying the validity behind it. A
canvass of the Industrial Division dele-
gates, at least a partial canvass, indicates
a substantial number of delegates cannot
be here Monday during the daytime due to
problems of employment. Many of them
have tried to get off and cannot. It’s not
a ﬁnancial question. It’s a question of job
security. Therefore I would like to urge
the delegates to vote against moving up
this special Order of business because
Monday night the chances are we will
have maximum attendance and therefore
maximum participation. At best perhaps it
could be moved up to 8 o'clock and the
Civil Liberties Committee could come
afterwards. But if you move it up during
the daytime, a substantial number of dele-
gates, and not of their own choosing, will
not be present and won’t be able to par-
ticipate. '

Ch.: Two spoke against the amendment
and now one for. The chair will recognize
another one for.

George Watt: As I understand the
amendment, the amendment deals not with
the election of a national committee: it
deals with a report from the Elections and

Leadership committee. I think that the 4

timing of this as it now stands would
provide for the district delegation caucuses
to go into session at 10 o'clock at night.
Now I think that would keep the delega-
tions here into the small hours of the
morning because there’ll be probably com-
plex and very knotty problems. Therefore

 

    

28

I would be for the amendment as made
by Mo-llie here to try to have an elections
report given before the supper recess on
that day.

Ch.: We will now put it to a vote. There
have been 2 for and 2 against. [Vote
taken.] The amendment carries. _

Hank (New Jersey): I should hke to
amend the agenda to move the report of
the Appeals Committee from 6 o’clock
Monday to precede the report of the Reso-
lutions Committee on 7:30 Sunday. I
make this motion because I feel that a
situation has developed in the State of
New Jersey that is of basic concern to
every delegate here. Therefore I think it is
of basic importance that every delegate
become acquainted with some of the prob-
lems confronting our Party and I think
it is of such magnitude that every dele-
gate here should know about it and express
an opinion on it. Therefore, I would
amend the agenda so that the report of
the Appeals Committee be moved up from
6 o’clock Monday to some time Sunday,
before the report of the Resolutions Com-
mittee.

Ch.: Is that clear now? Is there anybody
for or against the amendment?

Lou (New Jersey): Comrade chairman,
I have no principled objection other than
the fact that arrangements have been
made tomorrow afternoon to hear the case
the comrade refers to and I doubt very
much because of the complicated charac-
ter of the case that the committee will be
prepared to make a report at that time.
Other than that, I would be in favor of it.
It’s a practical matter.

C'h.: Further discussion on the amend-
ment? Hearing none, the chair calls for
a vote on the motion. The motion is lost.

Winter: I should like to inform the
delegates, as they may very well be
aware themselves that this conven-
tion has been the center of attention
on the part of many groups and or-
ganizations in the country who have
politically opposed our program and
activities. But amongst them there
are many organizations and indivi-

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

duals who are concerned about the
protection and preservation of the
constitutional liberties of political or-
ganizations in our country including
those of the Communists. Amongst
such groups and individuals there
have been expressed an interest, sub-
ject to our agreement, in taking some
action that would help us demon-
strate to the country at large that our
Party is a political party concerned
with the business which it declares
to be its object in its Resolutions and
Constitution and public pronounce-
ments, that it functions in no wise
as a conspiracy, as has been charged
against it and also to make it pos-
sible in the event of future diﬂiculties
following this convention to refer
to the evidence that may rest in the
observance of this convention by
prominent civic persons representing
organizations known to have been
in disagreement with the program
and purposes of our organization.
We have had inquiry and various
signs of interest and desire to co-
operate to these ends from a number
of groups, Catholic organizations,
various civil liberties groups, and
others. The National Committee
discussed this question and came to
the conclusion that it would be to
the distinct beneﬁt, not only of our
Party, its delegates to this conven-
tion and its membership, but of
particular beneﬁt to the struggle
which our Party has consistently

waged for defense of constitutional
liberties in our country, for the pres-
ervation and strengthening of the
legal status of our Party, to invite
as observers to this convention a
number of such prominent individ-
uals.

We have therefore, in the name of
the National Committee, informed
a dozen or so that we would pre-

sent this question to the convention I

for its action. I should like to read
the list of those who have declared
themselves available as observers to
serve the purposes I have indicated.
They are:

Former President of St. ]ohn’s
College, lecturer, Professor
Stringfellow Barr;

The Editor of The Catholic Work-
er, Dorothy Day;

The Executive Secretary Emeritus
of the Fellowship of Reconcilia-
tion, A. I. Muste;

Faculty Member of St. Lawrence
College, Dr. Roy Finch;

The former Chairman. of the New
York Civil Liberties Union, Rev.
Iohn Paul Iones;

The Executive Secretary of the
War Resisters League and a co-
organizer of the Montgomery
Anniversary Concert, Bayard
Rustin;

The Director of the Central Com-
mittee for Conscientious Objec-
tors, also former Secretary of

    

29

Peace Education and American
Friends Service Committee of
Iowa, George Willoughby;

The Director of Peace Education
of the Atlantic Region of the
American Friends Service Com-
mittee, Lyle Tatum;

The Director of Publications for
the Fellowship of Reconciliation,
Alfred Hassler;

Lecturer at the New School for
Social Research, Bernard Rosen-
berg;

Board Member of the New York
Civil Liberties Union, Carl Rach-
lin;

Board Member of the New York
Civil Liberties Union and pro-
fessor of psychology at New
York University, Dr. Marie Ia-
hoda; and

An attorney, for the New York
Civil Liberties Union, Lester
Migdall.

We indicated in advance that this
matter would be discussed upon
opening our convention, that ﬁnal
determination rests with the will of
the delegates and have suggested
to those who would be willing to
attend as observers under the condi-
tions I have described, that they be
available at about noon today. Per-
haps we somewhat overestimated
the possibility of our getting through
with some of the organization busi-
ness. However, at this time, on be-

 

    

3o
half of the Temporary Rules Com-

mittee, acting in accordance with
the decision of the outgoing National
Committee, I would move that we
open the Observers’ section of this
convention to the list I have named.
(Applause.)

lame: Ford (New York): Comrade
chairman: Point of information. I’d
like to know if any representatives of
labor and of the Negro people have
been informed of this invitation.

Winter: As for representatives of la-
bor organizations, the National Com-
mittee has canvassed energetically for
persons whose names would occupy
the necessary weight to enable us to
make reference in the future to their
participation as observers, representa-
tives of sections of the labor move-
ment not associated with our organi-
zation. We have not been able to
obtain any acceptance from such per-
sons. We have done the same with re-
spect to a number of persons promi-
nent in Negro life. However, we do
have as one acceptance Bayard Rustin,
the Executive Secretary of the War Re-
sisters League who is the co-organizer
of the Montgomery Anniversary Con-
cert, a prominent Negro leader.

Comrade Blumberg will be able to
inform us of preliminary efforts that
were made. Meanwhile may I say that
the committee would welcome further
proposals, whether they happen to
cover names already canvassed, or if
they give us additional names, the
committee will certainly extend addi-

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

tional invitations to this convention.

Albert Blumberg: I would just sup-
plement this by saying that a num-
ber of people indicated interest but
they would be out of town. What the
chairman has read to you are those who
indicated that they could and would
be present. Among those who indi-
cated interest but unavailability are:
Norman Thomas, Roger Baldwin, the
Rev. James Robinson from Harlem
and a number of others. So that in
the course of the canvass efforts were
made by those who initiated this
thought, to wit, Mr. Muste and Mr.
Thomas, they have been in touch with
a number of interested people. On the
speciﬁc question of A. Philip Ran-
dolph, he is out of town, as the press
indicates, speaking in the South.

[Additional discussion on sugges-
tions of persons to be invited.]

Helen Winter (Michigan): I would

like to rise in support of the recommen-

dation of the Rules Committee, con-
sidering it a very important step in
the direction of legalizing the various
elements and procedures of our Party
as a ﬁght for the full legalization of
our Party as a political party in the
United States. I think that otherwise
it will be very much to the good of our
Party if the various debates on the
matter of our Constitution and the
Resolutions before it, are left open
for the hearing of such individuals
named by the Presiding Committee.
Al (New York): Speaking against
the proposal. First, I want to object
to the method in which the National
Committee went about this so as to
put us in a position of chasing people

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 31

away from the door who have already
agreed to come. That's a squeeze play
in my opinion. Secondly, I’m against
it because the most important problem
here is our hammering out a program
and form of organization of our Party,
no matter what anybody else thinks
about it. The main thing is that we
do what we think is right and our
job, no matter what anybody thinks
about it, and what we do will be made
available to the world when we’re
through. I fear that having outsiders
will inhibit the discussion. I heard
from New Jersey already that some
delegates decided not to come, I don’t
know whether for this reason or what.
But I know there are people who are
coming here risking many things and
will feel inhibited as to how they speak,
how frankly they speak, feeling, well,
there’s a spotlight on them. And I
think the whole thing is wrong! I
think the Communist Party ought to
have a convention, decide what it
wants to do, and then tell the world
what it did. (Applause.)

Fred Blair (Wisconsin): I am very
much in favor of this motion. I have
been in the Party pretty near 27%
years, and I’ve never seen an inhibited
Communist yet. (Laughter, applause.)
It’s a sort of contradiction in terms.

As a matter of fact the complaint
usually is that we aren’t inhibited
enough. The usual complaint about
me is that particularly when it comes

to talking, I don’t know when to stop.

C/1.: You can stop in 3 or 4 minutes
(laughter).

Blair: I am well enough acquainted
with Comrade Lightfoot to know that

that will be true. I was wondering if
it isn’t possible to continue the can-
vassing to see if we can have some
more people besides these, along the
lines of what Comrade Ford was sug-
gesting. Like the American Socialist,
who have been busying themselves
wondering and worrying about what’s
going to happen to us because they’re
wondering what's going to happen to
them and think what we decide de-
termines what happens to them but
nevertheless who have some connec-
tion. Or do we want to leave this open
so there’s a possibility for further ex-
ploration of inviting people, present-
ing names to this convention. And I
think we have people who couldn’t
come here because of security, not be-
cause of inhibition, and I think that
everybody who is here, we can talk
what we have to say in front of the
whole bloody world and we don’t have
to be so timid. (Applause.)

Ford: Comrade chainnan, I want to
speak against the proposal. First of all
I think it is obvious that our conven-
tion meeting here today is concerned
with the whole field of struggle for
civil liberties, for the rights of the Ne-
gro people, for broadening our con-
tacts with masses of people outside our
ranks, and throughout the country. It
is also obvious that many of the peo-
ple that I’ve heard here have boldly
defended the Communists in their
rights, have defended Smith Act vic-

tims and have been friendly to the‘

Negro people. I think, however, that
our convention here is an unprece-

dented convention, convened for the.

purpose of discussing fundamental

\

 

32 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

problems of our organization and the
maintaining of our organization on
the basis of a Marxist-Leninist line.
And I think it is necessary for us to
solve that question among ourselves
and by ourselves. I am aware that
hundreds, and Comrade Foster has in-
dicated, even people opposed to us, are
concerned about our convention and
they want to know about it. And I
think therefore, whereas the intent may
be good, and has that broad approach,
I think it is not necessary and not ad-
visable. And therefore I am opposed
to it. And further, there would be
only one alternative to that proposal:
that if there had been in my opinion
a sincere effort to get representatives
of the Negro people who today rep-
resent the real civil rights struggle
in our country, I am sure, comrades,
we could have gotten them. I don’t
think that there has -been a sincere
effort even in the consultation of our
Negro comrades as to the security of
representatives and therefore I am op-
posed to it and I think that there is
a sort of a second-class treatment of
representatives to be invited to this
convention.

C/1.: Comrades we have had two for
and two against. The question has been
called.

Geo. Samson (New Jersey): Point of
order. I think that due to the importance
of this question and I might say there is
extremely sharp division on this question,
that there should be an extended period
of discussion.

d Ch.: Comrade, this is no point of or-
er.

Samson: All I can say is, comrades, if
this motion is carried I know that I and
a number of other delegates will just have

to leave this convention. And I think it’:
important enough to hear why.

Ch.: Comrades, if you want toextend
debate, the chair has no vested interest
one way or the other. It's up to the will
of this convention if it wishes to extend
debate on this question, to move a motion
and carry it to that effect and then well
do so. But I cannot act against the will
of the body unless it’s changed. So—.-

Winter: I ask for the privilege to inter-
vene at this point in an effort to appeal
to this convention and every single dele-
gate within it to respect the will of every
other delegate and the collective wisdom
of this body, whether it coincides with
his personal opinions or not. I think we
should reject from the outset o-f this con-
vention any proposition that anyone might
be tempted to present that counterposes
his intention of walking out of this session
to any possible decision of this body (ap-
plause).

Samson: I’d like to hear why because
that was not the intent of what I said,
comrades. You are giving an intent to
what I said which is not there. It is a
question of security involved and not a
question of opposing any decision of this
convention. I object very much to the
thinking you gave.

Ch.: Comrades, I would like to request
the comrade who is speaking to hold ‘his
point for a few minutes and let’s take a
vote as to whether or not we extend the
discussion. It is clear there are strong
feelings on this particular subject. The
chair would like to entertain a motion
to that effect. [Motion made and seconded.l
I would also like to be guided by two
for and two against, so that we will not
have interminable debate. [Vote taken.]
So ordered. The chair recognizes the com-
rade who had the ﬂoor, speaking against.

Samson: Comrades, we have for a
long time been debating and discuss-
ing our problems, as members of the
Communist Party. This National Con-
vention is the climax to this debate at
which very important decisions for our
activities, for attempting to resolve our
problems, to end our isolation, are to
take place. Because of the nature of

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 33;

the present situation within our coun-
try, there are many comrades who
should be here and are unable to be
here. On the other hand because of the
nature of the discussion, some comrades
engaged in important mass work, in-
dustrial activity, have made an effort
to come here under certain particular
circumstances. This is a convention of
the Communist Party. These people
involved in mass activity, in trade un-
ion activity and who are working in
the shops have come here to participate
in this debate, express their viewpoints.

The point that I made before was—-
not that I had any intention of walk-
ing out—if you pass a motion against
my position—but in relation to our
mass activity, in relation to our work,
I feel that this proposal would en-
danger us to the point that at this
particular point if I had known ahead
of time, I would not have come. We
are elected delegates to this convention,
we have a right to participate in this
convention, and these people, while I
consider the importance of their being
here, if the circumstances were differ-
ent I would be wholeheartedly in favor
of it, and I say the regularly elected
delegates to this convention who happen
to be in a similar situation as myself
have the full right to be here without
in any manner, shape or form, being in
"a situation where they feel their se-
curity is’ endangered so that they will
be unable to attend and participate in

the deliberations of this convention.

Charles Loman (New York): Point
of information. I want to ask a ques-
tion “along the lines Helen Winter
place‘d,;»,it.—V 1,-_'I:_@ere will be matters which

we may not want to take up in general
session. Now you’ve explained that.
But there is another factor here in-
volved. I received a number of tele-
phone calls from comrades this morn-
ing asking me in light of yesterday’s
story should they come to the conven-
tion. I told them by all means come
and it would be raised. Now I think
before we vote on this, we should not
think in the spirit of those of us who
are publicly known functionaries, we all
realize the importance of utilizing
every means to ﬁght for legality, but in
the interest of those people who we
fought to convince and to come, it
maybe a job or a contact, etc. I would
like to know. from the floor of this
convention how many people here feel
inhibited or feel they might be exposed
as delegates.

‘Clz.: I rule this question out of order
because a vote on the question will de-
termine that.

Bob (California): I am speaking for.
Friends, ﬁrst of all I want to say that
we had a great struggle to convince
certain people to come to this conven-
tion. But we have to remember that
the question of risk is not a question
of whether the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation knows that you’re here or
not. Anyone who humors himself to
think that they don’t know that (ap-
plause) simply because some guest or
other is not in the house is really put-
ting himself in a position where he
just doesn’t know what's going on in
this country. That’s. No. I.  what
is the question of security involved
here? The question of security is not
whether a certain member of our or-

ganization who works in a particular
shop or mass organization is known
to the F .B.I. Therefore, we have to say
that those people who recognize these
problems and in the face of these prob-
lems have made the great sacriﬁce of
coming here to this convention, as
some of us have——comrades, I almost
was divorced for coming to this conven-
tion, and I have four children (laugh-
ter)—those who have made this sacri-
ﬁce to come to this convention made
this sacriﬁce in order to get somewhere.
We didn’t make this sacriﬁce in order
to make some private party and then
go home. We made this sacriﬁce so
that when this convention is over,
more people in these United States will
say, “Well, regardless of whether we
agree with what these people say, at
least they’re honest and trying to get
somewhere.” (Applause.) And I’ll tell
you this. Some people have come up
to me and said, “Why don’t you point
out these people are being friendly.”
I don’t care if they’re not friendly. I
don’t care if they’re enemies. There’s
no reason in my mind why any single
person barring the question of space
should not be allowed to sit in this
convention. Thank you.

[aim (New ]cr:ey): Brother Chair-
man, brothers and sisters. I want to
speak against the motion. And I want
to say that I look forward to the
time when our Party will hold its con-
ventions openly with no question of
fear of prosecution, with no question
but that we want the American people,
as we do now, to know not only
through our own lips, but through
the lips of observers both biased against

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

us as well as unbiased where we stand.
I think ﬁrst we have to find out how
we stand. I respect very much my
good brother from Wisconsin who says
in his 24 years in the Party he has
never seen an inhibited Communist.
I’ve been in the Party 24 years and I
know that we would not be having
the kind of convention we are having
today if we had not had the kind of
bureaucratic system which made for
very few but inhibited Communists.

I know that there are members of
the New Jersey delegation who upon
hearing that observers have been in-
vited, are absent from this convention.
I think this is to be regretted. I am
not one to condemn them. I know
there is some dirty linen that must be
washed at this Convention. I think
we must come out of here clean and I
for one will be inhibited, although I
am not normally an inhibited guy, from

saying the things that I feel must be.

said before people who are good people
but are not members of this conven-
tron.

C/2.: The -chair now recognizes Com-
rade Ben Davis for a point of clariﬁ-
cation.

Ben Dar/is: Comrades, I am going to
speak for the motion, and not so much
clariﬁcation. I want to express my agree-
ment with this proposal in principle and
to say the following: ‘It is my feeling
here, comrades, that our Party is at-
tempting to do something new, and
is trying to make a turn in answering
many of the slanders against our Party
as a conspiracy, as secrecy and to es-
tablish good public relations. Now this
is important. It is important that we

L-

‘r are

make this turn. It is important also that
we try to do it in as perfected a man-
ner as possible. Now I think since
this is something we have never tried
before, it’s natural that we are some-
what new at it and that we haven’t
perfected it. For example, I don’t think
there were enough Negroes. I don’t
think there were enough workers. I
don’t think that there were enough rank
and ﬁlers invited from various places
and industries and mass organizations.
Well, the fact that we didn’t does
not mean that our Party committee op-
poses it, but I think it grows out of
the rush, the attempt of our Party
to make this turn, to do this service,
which I think is very important and
not at all due to the fact that some
comrades wanted to restrict the calibre,
type or any other designation. I think
that this is a weakness of the proposal
that has been made, but I do think
that in principle there’s nothing wrong
with it. It’s sound.

Now I too had some reservations
about it and I share very much the
reservations of those comrades who
spoke about security. But as I under-
stand it, this matter has been talked
over with many of the district leaders,
that this has been cut down to a mini-
mum and we all know that they’re all
around here, the FBI and everything
else, and that no matter what we do
there’s a certain amount of risk. We
have to decide whether we have any-
thing to gain from it. I think we do.
(Applause.)

Lil Gate: (New York): Comrade
chairman, point of clariﬁcation. Before
we take a vote, I would like to ask the

    

35

committee that worked on this to an-
swer this question of there being a pol-
icy of not asking Negroes or labor
people which was implied in the re-
marks, which should be cleared up be-

fore we vote.

C}z.: There was no such policy. I
consulted with Comrade Ben Davis on
this and he informs me that there
was not. [Vote taken.] It is obviously
overwhelmingly carried. (Applause.)
The observers will be brought in.*

Winter: Now the Temporary
Rules Committee wishes to propose
the committees to be constituted by
the Convention and propose the
chairmen and secretaries of these
committees. Again I want to call
attention to the fact that the bulk
of the work of this convention will
be conducted in committee. A great
deal of preparatory work has been
done under the direction of the Na-
tional Committee jointly With the
various state committees in setting
up temporary subcommittees for
preparation of material for this con-
vention.

In proposing the oﬂicers of conven-
tion committees we have taken into
account the need for continuity of
work already initiated by subcom-
mittees working in preparation of thc
convention. We have taken into ac-
count the need to give maximum
representation to all parts of the
country, to the major districts, and

the areas of concentration in the ac-
tivities of our Party. The leaders
of the major delegations have been
consulted in preparation of these
proposals.

I would urge upon the comrades
to bear in mind that this list is not
easily transposed, although there will
undoubtedly be a desire to change
one o-r another name. But I would
like to remind you that the commit-
tee has been constantly readjusting
names on this list in consultation
with various delegations. In compos-
ing the proposals the committee also
took into account the character of
the discussions at the various state
conventions. So that we could where-
ever possible include the most im-
portant though differing viewpoints
on various questions that were re-
flected in the respective state discus-
sions.

The Rules Committee proposes:

plus the National Secretariat consist-
ing of Comrades Foster, Dennis,
Davis, Gates, Weiss and Fine. So that
it is proposed that the Presiding
Committee to be elected which will
consult on the proceedings of this
convention, that will receive sugges-
tions of the respective delegations
and will report back to this body
on any action to be taken that rep-
resents any change from the rules
and agenda already adopted or any
other matters that may come before
it, and which should elect a small
Steering Committee for the moment
to moment direction of the work

    

37

shall consist of a representative from
each delegation, Comrade Foster
and the outgoing National Secretar-
iat comprising the additional ﬁve
comrades named and the Temporary
Rules . Committee which prepared
the material on which you have
acted and are now reaching ﬁnal ac-
tion on. The Temporary Rules
Committee consists of co—chairmen
Lightfoot and Winter, plus George
Charney of New York, Sid Stein of
New Iersey, Fred Fine of Illinois
and Ben Davis of New York.

I move, comrades, the adoption of
the committees, chairmen and secre-
taries as proposed.

C /1.: Is there a second to the motion ?_
Discussion?

Charles Loman (New York): Could
we have a ﬁve-minute recess? There
are a couple of problems. Some have
one chairman, some two chairmen,
some have not enough Negro represen-
tation. I would like to propose that
you give us 5 minutes to study these
and then we’ll vote.

C}z.: [In answer to question from the
ﬂoor.] Each district delegation will
select the person to serve on the pre-
siding committee.

Winter: This question calls my at-
tention to the fact that I neglected one
feature of the composition. of com.
mittees: Heads of delegations have re-
ceived from the Temporary Rules Com-
mittee a proposed schedule of organi-
zation, which is based upon the num.
ber of voting delegates to which each

i
i
c
l

 

 

38 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

district is entitled. That schedule of
organization allots to each district dele-
gation a number of delegates to serve
on as many of the convention com-
mittees and subcommittees as it is pos-
sible to do in accordance with the
number of delegates. The personnel
to be assigned to these committees is
entirely at the discretion of the delega-
tion. We had in mind that We could
not satisfy all requirements in naming
the officers for these committees but
that there would be provision for
strengthening the composition of the
committees by action of the delegations
themselves in assigning members of
delegations to serve on various com-
mittees in accordance with the table
of organization in the hands of each
delegation leader. In addition to that
the presiding committee will have a
representative elected by each delega-
tion, as a member of the Presiding
Committee.

Ch.: The chair would like to urge
upon the convention to accept this re-
port, including the remarks.

[Vote taken.] I think it is over-
whelmingly accepted.

Winter: I should like to move now,
comrades, approval of the Tempor-
Rules Committee report as
amended by the convention and dis-
missal of the Temporary Rules
Committee.
[Motion seconded and carried.]
Ch.: The chair now recognizes
Comrade Martha Stone from New
Iersey.

Martha Stone: Comrades, we have

reached a solemn moment in our
convention proceedings. Between the
15th convention held in December
1950 and the 16th convention of our
Party, death has claimed a number
of very beloved comrades. Some of
the best sons and daughters of our
country who gave the best years of
their lives to the liberation of man-
kind are absent from our convention
today. We honor these fallen com-
rades for their contribution to the
democratic achievements of our great
country. Among them are comrades
who suﬁered privation, with re-
peated, sometimes long, prison sen-
tences for ﬁghting for the right to
picket, to organize, in the struggle
for Negro rights, against frameups of

‘Tom Mooney and Sacco-Vanzetti.

These comrades have lived through
very hard times. They experienced
poverty and war like millions of
people in America who also lived
through such hard times. But these
comrades distinguished themselves
among the people because they were
able to come up with alternatives
to the lawless and brutal attacks of

capitalism, pointing the way to the.

socialist reorganization of our society
where exploitation of man by man
is completely eliminated. Their role
as Communists, like that of the
Party they represented, was always
a constructive one throughout the
years, as the American working class
and the Negro people fought for
higher living standards against all

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

sorts of fascist attacks and McCarthy-
ism and for a policy of peaceful oo-
existence. We honor today such dear
comrades as Alfred Wagenknecht,
charter member of our Party, known
for his nationwide campaign for
strikers’ relief in the period of the
depression, in the Sacco-Vanzetti
and Scottsboro cases, for years a resi-
dent of Chicago and a leader of the
Communist Party there.

We honor a giant of a man not
only for his physical stature, but
his great contribution to our Party
and our people. We honor Robert
Minor, a native of Texas, an artist,
a great champion in the cause of civil
liberties.

We honor here today Ray Hans-
boroug/1, a Negro leader of the Com-
munist Party, who took leadership
in Wisconsin, Illinois, New York,
was a former member of the Na—
tional Committee of Y the Party and
in the period of time when he was

‘ very ill, shortly before his death, was

the organizer of the Communist
Party on the South Side of Chicago.

We honor that man whose name is
a beloved one to the rank and ﬁle
of our Party; a leader of our Party,
the former New York State Chair-
man of the Party, Israel Amter,
whose years in the unemployed
struggles, and whose close and in-
timate ties with the membership of
our Party endeared him in the hearts
of all of the members in New York

   
 

39

and in many other districts of our
country.

We honor a woman whom many
of us had unfortunately no opportu-
nity to honor at the time of her fu-
neral—M0t/zer Ella Reeve Bloor-
who until the very last days of her
life had the closest ties with the so-
cialist-minded people from one end
of the country to the other, regard-
less of their political diﬁerences
with the Communist Party. Ella
Reeve Bloor, prominent woman lead-
er, maintained this close association
and today when we emphasize this
aspect of our work, in this regard as
well as in many other respects, she
stands out as a proud example of
a Communist who always worked
as a mass leader.

Another illustration is our own
proud figure, Anita Whitney, who
was a charter member of our Party,
the honorary chairman of the Cali-
fornia District, who is known in this
country as her name is linked with
the Suffragette movement, and who
was a former member of the Nation-
al Committee of our Party.

Frank M ucci who in Chicago and
in other parts of the country car-
ried with his name the symbol of a
working class ﬁghter, a man who
came from a working class family,
himself a coal miner, and one who
was promoted to a position of oﬁ‘icer-
ship during the battles of the Second
World War.

40 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

We honor William Weiner, a mod-
est man, whose name is held dear
by thousands of people in the na-
tional groups ﬁeld from one end of
the country to the other, as he was
related with the International Work-
ers Order and the problems of the
people in these great movements.

We honor here today a man who
acquired the culture and tools of a
brain worker by his arduous toil up
from poverty like that of the poor
white people in the South-Sam
Hall———who was a district organiz-
er of North Carolina, Alabama,
Louisiana and Texas, a man who
knew how to write and talk in the
language of the people, and whose
wife today carries on bravely his ac-

tivity in behalf of the Communist.

Party today in the South.

I ask you, comrades, to rise for a
moment of silence in honor of these
as well as of our rank and ﬁle mem-
bers and other beloved ﬁgures in our
State organizations — all valiant
Americans who have passed away
since our last convention.

Ch.: I recognize at this time Com-
rade Winter on a special order.

Winter: Comrades, I rise to offer
a motion which I think the dele-
gates will agree should constitute
the ﬁrst business-like work of this
convention. I propose that this con-
vention address a telegram to Presi-
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower at
Thomasville, Ga., reading as fol-
lows:

President Dwight D. Eisenhower
Thomasville, Ga.

The bombs are falling in Alabama,
not in the Middle East. The threat to
American democracy is not 5,000 miles
away. It is here at home. Your rejec-
tion of a request of outstanding South-
ern Negro leaders that you speak in the
South against the immorality of racist
violence has shocked millions of Ameri-
cans, Negro and white.

At your press conference last Wed-
nesday you defended your refusal on
the grounds that you were too busy.

What business could be more impor-
tant than enforcing the Constitution
of the United States now under attack
by a small minority of southern white
hoodlums backed by state and local
officials? You are now in Georgia, one

hour’s ﬂight from the bombings. The

President of the United States should ,

ﬁnd the time to defend the Constitu-
tion and the rights of all Americans.

We, over 350 delegates to the 16th
national convention of the Communist
Party, believe we express the wishes
of the majority of the American peo-
ple in urging you to issue in the South
a new Eisenhower doctrine for en-
forcement of the Supreme Court's de-
segregation decisions and against the
racist advocates and practitioners of
force and violence.

I move the adoption of this tele-
gram (applause).

[Vote taken—so ordered.]

 

SESSIONS OF‘ THE CONVENTION

AFTERNOON S1-:ss1oN

February 9, I957

C/2.: Fraternal greetings have been
received from the Communist Parties
of many countries including: France,
Italy, Japan, Bolivia, Colombia, Great
Britain, Australia, Puerto Rico, the
Netherlands, Canada, Bulgaria, Bel-
gium, Trieste, Korea, Czechoslo-
vakia, the Soviet Union, Ecuador,
El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala,
Uruguay, Chile and Romania—and
I understand there are more coming
in.*

[Greetings read from Canada,
Puerto Rico, Czechoslovakia and
Italy.]

Hearty fraternal greetings to your na-
tional convention. We wish you success in
strengthening and consolidating the Party
in common resolve to contribute yo-ur in-
valuable aid to win peace, progress,
greater democracy for the working peo-
ple of your country and to further de-
velop your views on the American path
to socialism. Your Party has courage-
ously fought for civil rights amidst great
diﬁiculties. We are conﬁdent that work
of the delegates will advance cause that
binds together working people of all
lands, liberation from war, insecurity and
exploitation of man by man.

National Executive Committee,

Labor Progresive Party of Canada

We deeply appreciate the invitation of
the National Committee of your Party to
send a fraternal delegation to the 16th
Natio-nal Convention of the Communist
Party of the United States.

Since the trial of the principal leaders
of our Party is scheduled to begin Febru-
ary 11th, we are not certain we will be
able to send a fraternal delegation to the
national convention that you are holding
February 9-12, 1957.

’ List of greeting: appears on page 351.

Nevertheless we wish to extend our best
wishes for the success of your national
convention and hopes that your Party
will emerge united with a political orienta-
tion that will permit it to make the action
of the working class and people of the
United States effective for the achieve-
ment of peace, social well-being, respect
for equality and democratic rights and
the recognition of the national indepen-
dence of peoples.

F ratemally,
Communist Party of Puerto Rico
Ramon Mirabal, General Secretary

The Central Committee of the Commu-
nist Party of Czechoslovakia send mili-
tant comradely greetings to the 16th na-
tional convention of your Party. Our
Party and all the -Czechoslovak people
hold in high regard the courageous strug-
gle of American Communists who under
very difficult conditions consistently de-
fend the interests of the workers, farmers
and all the working people of the United
States, ﬁght undaunted against feverish
arming and for the preservation of peace
and peaceful coexistence between all
countries. We ﬁrmly believe that your
convention will further strengthen the
Marxist-Leninist unity of your Party and
its ﬁghting capacity. Long live the Com-
munist Party of the United States. May
the unity of the Communist and work-
ers’ parties leading the working people
to a happy future grow ever stronger on
the basis of Marxist-Leninist teaching.

Central Committee of the
Communist Party of Czechoslovakia

On the occasion of your 16th National
Convention, we extend to you our frater-
nal greetings and good wishes.

The Italian Communists, engaged, in ac-
cordance with the decisions of the VIIIth
Congress in the struggle for an Italian road
to Socialism, follow with lively interest
the efforts and the experiences which the
brother parties, having in common the
same cause, can'y out in the particular
conditions ﬂowing from their own tradi-
tions, from the class relationships and na-
tional characteristics of their own‘country.

This struggle of ours is the best con-
tribution which we consider we must make
to the great international working class
movement of which we are part.

Faithful to the spirit of proletariat: in-

ternationalism, we are convinced that the
solidarity of all fraternal parties is essen-
tial for the development and success of
the common struggle fo-r peace, freedom
and the independence of peoples and for
the victory of socialism in the world.

In this spirit, in the name of the Ital-
ian Communist Party, we wish your con-
vention fruitful work and full success in
the strengthening and further ‘development
of a working class party guided _bY the
principles of Marxism-Lenimsm, in the
struggles which you will undertake _ for
peace, progress, democracy and socialism.

For the Central Committee,
Communist Party of Italy
Palmiro Togliatti

Clz.: We have received two greet-
ings from the Communist Party of
France. The first arrived on ]anu-
ary 21st signed by Jacques Duclos.
The second arrived last night by
cablegram from the Central Commit-
tee of France. It has been decided
to read both of these greetings to
the convention.

To Comrade William Z. Foster
To the Executive Committee, CPUSA

Dear Comrades:

The Central Committee of the Commu-
nist Party of France received with great
pleasure the invitation of the Executive
Committee of the Communist Party of
the United States to send a delegation
to its 16th Convention.

The Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the CP of France warmly
thanks the Executive Committee of the
CPUSA for this. We take great pleasure
in informing you that we have designated
a delegation of two members to be present
at the 16th Convention. These comrades
are Raymond Guyot, member of the Po-
litical Bureau and Maurice Kniegel-Val-
rimont, member of the Central Committee.
We have requested visas and we hope that
the American authorities will place no
obstacles preventing the arrival of our
comrades in the S.

While awaiting the decision of the
State Department on this request for

visas, we would like to express to your
Party as a whole and its leadership the
interest which the holding of your 16th
National Convention has evoked in our
Party, by exchanging with you some opin-
ions relating to the general political situa-
tion of the Communist movement. We have
attentively studied the stages in the dis-
cussion opened in your Party and which
will constitute the essential work of your
16th Convention. This concerns, in gen-
eral, the determination, in 1957, of the
role, the ideology and the organization
of the Party of the working class in your
country.

We understand the diﬁiculties and the
special character with which a Commu-
nist Party can be faced in a country
like the United States where the power
of monopoly capitalism imposes special
forms of ideological, political and social
oppression and where the labor movement
is often penetrated with non-Marxist
ideology.

However, the history of the American
labor movement is rich in magniﬁcent
struggles. It is precisely these special
characteristics of the implacable iron heel
and of the spirit of struggle which makes

it more necessary for the Party of the

working class to remain ﬁrm on the prin-
ciples of class struggle so that the inter-
ests of the workers are always correctly
defended and the social future of the
country assured. Only the Communist
Party can guarantee that.

But also, the Communist Party can play
its role of revolutionary Party of the work-
ing class acting in the interest of all the
people and the nation only if it is
built and ﬁghts in the framework of
the fundamental principles which have
been tested in other countries, in the
ﬁrst place in the Soviet Union, thanks to
the victory of October 1917; only if it
determines its internal life and its politi-
cal struggle in the framework of the prin-
ciples of Marxism-Leninism; only if it
ﬁghts for its leading role in the revolu-
tionary struggle for Socialism.

In examining with great attention the
opinions expressed by different comrades
in your discussion, and the oﬂicial docu-
ments like the Draft Resolution for the
Convention, the November 6th statement
of the Communist Party of the U.S. con-
cerning the events in Poland and Hungary
and other documents, we believe that we

 

SESSIONS OF , THE CONVENTION

discern dangerous departures from these
principles; we have at the same time,
however, been happy to see that a more
profound study of the real facts has al-
ready permitted you to make certain pre-
cisions and happy corrections for our com-
mon cause and the future of the Commu-
nist Party of the United States.

The class struggle was and remains the
motor of history and it is only a Marxist-
Leninist Party which can extract its laws
and make the working class victorious
in its struggle against capitalism; the
dictatorship of the proletariat is the in-
dispensable, inevitable arm for the exercise
of the power by the working class allied
with the farmers, whatever are the par-
ticular forms of transition from capital-
ism to socialism; all that which can weak-
en or deny the class struggle and the exer-
cise of the dictatorship of the proletariat
is contrary to the interests of the social
revolution, is contrary to Marxism-Lenin-
ism.

Leninism, the development and victori-
ous application of Marxism, has in our
opinion as French Communists, prodigi-
ously achieved the building of the Com-
munist Party and of socialism in the
USSR, in China and in other countries.

The universal truth of Marxism-Lenin-
ism could not be denied by any true
Communist. It is not true that the Lenin-
ist principles of the building of the Party
and socialism would only be valid in the
Soviet Union, that the socialist system
would not have permanent worth, taking
into account national characteristics which,
in particular, Lenin advised should be
carefully taken into account. To deviate
from these basic conceptions is to slide
into the morass of social-democratic op-
portunism; still more, it is to fall into
liquidationist revisionism, that is to say,
to turn one’s back on the revolution, on
Communism, the class struggle; it is to
play the game of Project X, of the re-
actionary plots organized on the basis of
Mutual Security Laws, as in Hungary.

We who had to face the highly organized
oﬂensive of the criminals and assassins
of the counter-revolutionary reaction of last
November 7th and who smashed it, to-
gether with the working class of France
November 8th and 13th, we understand
the diﬂiculty which you had to face in rela-
tion to the events in Poland and Hungary.
But it is now well known to American

clarity of the proletariat—thus of the na-
tional parties of the working class is con-
sidered by us as one of the categoric
imperatives of the present period of the
international class struggle, which implies
solidarity with the foreign policy of the
Soviet Union corresponding to the essen-
tial interests of the international prole-
tariat, of Peace and Socialism, to the in-
terests of the independence movements
of the oppressed and dependent countries
in the world.

That is why any penetration of the
echoes of the anti-Communist and anti-
Soviet campaign in our ranks must be an-
swered by an unrelenting resistance and
pitiless rebuff.

We are happy, dear comrades, to -be
able freely and fraternally to exchange
our opinions with you for the success
of our common cause. We wish your Con-
vention fruitful and valuable work for
the Communist movement in the U.S.

With the hope that our delegation can
attend your 16th Convention, we send
you our fraternal greetings.

For the Central Committee of the

Member of the Political Bureau
Secretary of the Central Committee

Paris, Feb. 8, 1957

Message from the Central Committee

of the French Communist Party to the

16th Congress of the Communist Party of
the United States.

William Z. Foster
101 West 16th Street
New York

Dear Comrades:

The Central Committee of the French
Communist Party warmly greets the 16th
Congress of the Communist Party of the
United States, a congress whose work
unfolds in a troubled and dangerous pe-
riod. It is evident that following the set-
back of the aggression against Egypt by
the F ranco-British imperialists and their
accomplices of the Israeli government,
American imperialism is seeking with the
Eisenhower Doctrine to plunge the world
again into the cold war in order to realize
its expansionist aims and plans for world
domination.

The Central Committee of the French

Communist Party regrets very much that
its delegation cannot attend your congress
because of the denial of visas by the
rulers of the United States. This does not
prevent these rulers from speaking un-
ceasingly of liberty. The facts expose once
agains the hypocrisy of the imperialists
of the United States who cynically violate
liberty, feed racism, attack the sovereignty
of nations, and set up obstacles to the or-
ganization of peace, at the same time as
they slander the countries of the camp of
socialism who make peaceful coexistence
the fundamental rule of their foreign
policy.

Despite the absence of representatives
of the Communists and workers of France
from your congress, the militants o-f our
Party will follow the work of your con-
gress with an interest all the greater be-
cause they attach considerable impor-
tance to the future of the Communist
movement in the United States.

We know that your Party is struggling
under difficult conditions and must con-
front attacks of a ferocious cla-ss enemy
which combine systematic anti-Communist
repression with very strong ideological pres-
sure upon the workers in order to prevent

the working class from determining and

following an independent policy. Never-
theless, the history of the American labor
movement is rich in magniﬁcent struggles.
It is precisely these special features of
the implacable iron heel and of the spirit
of struggle of the workers which oblige
a party of the working class to stand
ﬁrmly on the principles of the class strug-
gle in order that the interests of the work-
ers will always be properly defended, in
order that the social future of the country
will be assured.

Only the Communist Party can guar-
antee that. The experience of the inter-
national workers’ movement shows that one
cannot stand up victoriously against the
assaults of the enemy except by remain-
ing faithful to the principles of Marxism-
Leninism. Only in this way can a work-
ing-class party develop soundly and surely
the struggle of the popular masses against
imperialism, again-st war and for socialism.

We have the ﬁnn hope that the Com-
munists of the United States will know
how to avoid the pitfalls which they may
encounter on the road of revolutionary
struggle and will not depart from the
fundamental principles of Marrism-Lenin-

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

ism which have been tested in other
countries, especially in the Soviet Union
and China.

After the events which international
capitalism provoked during these last
months and which it seeks to exploit pre-
cisely to divide the world movement of
Communism, the imperative thing for
every Communist Party is the clariﬁcation
and deepening of the principles of prole-
tarian intemationalism in the course of
checking those who would divide the
workers’ and socialist movement, reinforc-
ing the unity of the ranks of the Party,
enriching the methods of the class struggle,
strengthening the international solidarity
of the proletariat around the Soviet Union
and the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union whose XXth Congress has opened
for the entire workers’ movement immense
possibilities of development. It is to this
that our French Communist Party is ﬁrmly
attached. We who have had to confront
the oﬁensive of the incendiary criminals
and assassins of counter-revolutionary re-
action last November 7th and who shat-
tered it together with the French work-
ing class from the 8th to the 13th of No-
vember, we understand the dilficulty which
you have had to face in connection with
the events in Hungary. But it is now
much easier to help the workers grasp
who are the true organizers of these
events, in particular of the counter-revo
lution in Hungary.

We are convinced that in their I6th
Convention, the Communists of the United
States, drawing inspiration from the expen-
ence of the world Communist movement,
will determine their national policy while
taking into account the documents_ of
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
of the Chinese Communist Party, of the
Socialist Workers Party of Hungary, as
well as the communiques published fol-
lowing the recent conferences among van-
ous fraternal parties. All of these docu-
ments re-aﬂirm the established (sacred,
“untou.chable”) principles of Marxism-
Leninism and in particular the need for
class vigilance. _

The French Communist Party sends its
fraternal wishes to the 16th Congress of
the Communist Party of the United States
for success in its work for the well-being
of the American working class and of the
exploited Negro people, f01‘ 1nt31"}at}°na1
solidarity, for peace and for socialism.

Long live the Communist Party of the
United States, vanguard of the working
class in the struggle for the true democ-
racy of the people.

Long live proletarian internationalism.

Long live Communism.

Central Committee of the
French Communist Party.

rade Eugene Dennis for the Keynote
Address.

Eugene Dennis: Comrades and
Friends:

For well known reasons I was not
able to be with you at the time of
our 15th National Convention in
December 1950. In the interim, we
were scattered to the four winds,
ﬁguratively speaking, and due to no
fault of our own, were not able to
convene a national convention ear-
lier. Now that we have assembled
again I wish to convey warmest and
comradely greetings to all my fellow
delegates. I also wish to extend a
hearty welcome to all our honored
guests and to our distinguished ob-
servers. By Way of caution, if not
compassion, I desire to inform you
that my address is neither an over-
all, nor an abridged report. The
only general, comprehensive reports
for this convention, are those to be
submitted in the form of thc
amended Draft Resolution and Con-
stitution. My opening remarks,
th¢1’Cf01'€, will be limited in scope
and subject matter, and it is with
this understanding that I will now
Droceed.

46 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

In the course of its 38 years of
existence, our American Comrmmist
Party has weathered a good many
storms, and more than one stormy
convention.

This convention meets at an es-
pecially diﬂicult moment in our
Party’s history. We have been en-
gaged in a painful and searching
effort to correct past errors, to sur-
mount losses sustained during the
cold-war decade, to overcome our
relative isolation, as well as to probe
a host of new problems arising out
of the changing world in which We
live. This already protracted endeav-
or is by no means over. But we
anticipate that our Convention will
go forward, making some impera-
tive changes and that we shall
emerge a wiser, stronger, and a more
united party.

Our problems are part of those
confronting the American working
class as a whole, some of these arise
from the objective situation which,
together with new opportunities,
presents diﬂiculties for all of Ameri-
ca’s working people. Attempts to
revive the cold war, to suppress the
Negro people’s struggle for equal-
ity, to shackle the trade unions with
the Taft—Hartley Act persecutions
and “right-to—work” laws, and to
rob the workers of the beneﬁts of
automation and atomic energy—af-
feet Communists and non—Com-
munists alike.

It is to equip our Party to cope
with this complex situation, espe-
cially to play a more active and in-_

ﬂuential role in the rising struggles
of labor, the Negro people, and the
peace forces—that we are deter-
mined to solve our own grave in-
ternal problems.

Of course, the vested corporate in-
terests are not going to make our
task any easier. Reaction continues
its campaign of repressions; and
monopoly’s ideologists step up their
psychological warfare against Marx-
ism, socialism, and all progressive
thought and activity.

=I= it =l=

Starting with the April National
Committee meeting, our Party took
some important first steps toward
grappling with the most pressing of

your many complicated problems.

We correctly emphasized, among
other things, the urgent need to
eliminate from our ranks all dog-
matic views and sectarian and bu-
reaucratic practices. Shortly there-
after we laid the basis for further
progress by approving the main pol-
itical approach of the Draft Resolu-
tion, and submitted the Draft for
general discussion and amendment.

But, during this same period,
when the facts in the Khrushchev
speech on Stalin became known in
this country, and again after the
tragic events in Hungary, impor-
tant sections of the Party at all levels
were temporarily disoriented and
demobilized. Some tried to start a
stampede. Some wandered into

strange pastures; while others ex-

hibited a hardening of the political
arteries.

Temporarily thrown oif balance,
the Party began to become enmeshed
in a bitter and divisive internal strug-
gle, and was in danger of being torn
apart. In this situation, the struggle
against doctrinairism and for effect-
ing big and long overdue changes in
our functioning and style of work,
in our relationships with masses, as
well as the ﬁght against revisionist
tendencies, became hampered by fac-
tional attitudes and extremism.

Without going into the matter
fully, I believe all of us on the Na-
tional Committee must share re-
sponsibility for this situation. But
some of the N.C. members who, at
least until recently, clung to inﬂex-
ible policies and pursued extreme
political objectives will perhaps take
on themselves more than the com—
mon share.

Fortunately, as the zero hour ap-
proached and the danger of a split
in the Party loomed as a possibility,
substantial sections of our member-
ship and some of the leadership rose
to the occasion. As distinct from the
conciliators of either the “Right” or
the “Left,” they began to intervene
forcefully. They combined a resolute
struggle to save the Party, defend its
Marxist-Leninist principles and make
the necessary changes, with an all-
out effort to preserve its unity.

Our task here is greatly facilitated
by the partial success of these prin-
cipled efforts to achieve Party unity,
which had a positive effect on many
state conventions. I am sure we all

47

appreciate the special contribution
made by the New York State con-
vention when it achieved unity on
the thorny question of Name and
Form, and on support for the gen-
eral line of the Draft Resolutionas
supplemented by appropriate amend-
ments.

As a result of the New York and
several other state conventions, it is
clear that the bulk of our members
have aﬂirmed the continuance of our
Communist Party and opposed its
replacement by a political action as-
sociation. They have overwhelming-
ly re-emphasized their unshakable
conviction that the American work-
ers, like the workers in every other
country, need an independent, work-
ing class, Marxist-Leninist vanguard
organization devoted to the welfare
of our people and the national inter-
ests of our country. They have also
made it clear that any and all pro-
posals to change the name, form, or
policies of the Party can and should
be examined and discussed on their
merits, in accordance with regular
Party procedures—in accordance with
the provisions of the Draft Constitu-
tion.

It is true we still have many serious
differences in our ranks on a host
of important questions, some of
which we shall not be able to re-
solve at this convention. Nonethe-
less, we are now in a position to
hammer out a collective and uniﬁed
approach to many programmatic
questions _and to most of the pressing
issues facing us and the American
people generally.

48 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

This is not wishful thinking; and
we should not let the heat of con-
troversy obscure this important fact.
For it is signiﬁcant that most state
conventions, while submitting vari-
ous and much-needed amendments,
have approved the main political di-
rection of the Draft Resolution
which is based on a sound, scientiﬁc
socialist approach to our own Ameri-
can conditions and problems.

# II! it

Thus there is substantial agree-
ment that the world forces of peace
now deﬁnitely outweigh those mak-
ing for world war, and that hence
the peace aspirations common to all
peoples, including our own, have be-
come more attainable. ,

World war is no longer inevitable.
If the popular peace forces every-
where, together with the socialist,
the Bandung and neutral states, ac-
tively unite their efforts—world war
can be successfully averted.

In approving this estimate, on
which the Draft Resolution bases
its outlook of a realistic perspective
for promoting peaceful coexistence,
most state conventions have correctly
stressed the reactionary and aggres-
sive role of U.S. imperialism. They
have emphasized the need for vigi-
lance and struggle against the pro-
vocative Eisenhower—Dulles Mid—East
Doctrine, the atomic war buildup,
and other sinister attempts to revive
the cold war.

Yet most have recognized that
even such explosive events as the
British-French—Israeli aggression in
Egypt and the imperialist-backed at-

tempt at counter—revolution in Hun-
gary have not reversed or cancelled
out the basic world trends and rela-
tionships making for peace.

While these developments aggra-
vated international tensions and jeop-
ardize the peace, the strength of the
peace camp was and is so dynamic
and powerful that the aggressors in
Egypt were quickly checkmated,
and the imperialist designs in Hun-
gary were thwarted. Obviously, the
world of 1956 is qualitatively differ-
ent from that of 1946, not to speak
of 1936.

Nonetheless, the American people
know all too well that we are not
free of the danger of an atomic holo-
caust. They recognize in the H-bomb
tests the possible rehearsal for such
horrors, and see that the radiation
from these tests already threatens the
health and future of the entire hu-
man race.

This is why the mass of the people
in our country are prepared to help
assure that a third world war will
never occur. The peace sentiments of
the American people helped bring
peace to Korea and facilitated the
Summit meeting at Geneva. These
peace aspirations are an integral part
of the new world relationship of
forces which can yet assure the ful-
ﬁllment of the great promise of
Geneva. Thus it is that around the
paramount issue of peace, the basis
now exists for united action with the
widest sectors of the American peo-
ple, including with many Social-
Democratic and reformist leaders and
groups in and outside of the ranks
of organized labor.

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

General agreement has also been
expressed on the Draft Resolution’s
estimate that conditions are matur-
ing which will make possible the
crystallization of an anti-monopoly
coalition led by labor, embracing
wide strata of trade unionists, farm-
ers, the Negro people, small busi-
nessmen, scientists and cultural
workers.

For the coming period this is the
main strategic task, the concrete way
to curb the monopolies, effect a new
democratic political alignment, and
pave the way to signiﬁcant social ad-
vance.

This convention will no doubt
help to deepen our understanding of
all that is implied by an anti-trust
and democratic coalition led by
labor, particularly as it probes deeper
into the effects of the giant corporate
mergers and the economic situation
and trends within the country. But
our common understanding of this
concept will best be advanced as we
work to popularize this idea which
we, as a vanguard, have projected,
especially in the course of our active
participation in the mass political
and economic struggles now unfold-
ing.

The state conventions further af-
ﬁrmed the Draft Resolution’s em-
phasis on the democratization of the
South as the Number One task for
the whole nation. They responded
enthusiastically to the need for
strengthening Negro-white unity, es-
pecially the alliance of labor and the
Negro people; for mobilizing all-out
support to the Negro people's great

49

and heroic struggles in the South, as
well as everywhere in the country;
and for stimulating the drive for the
trade—union organization of the un-
organized in the South on the basis
of Negro—white unity.

Just what we mean by placing the
struggle to democratize the South as
the nation’s Number One task will
best be spelled out by what we do to
make it the Number One task for
our whole Party and those whom we
influence.

it It it

The Draft Resolution’s concept of
our advocacy of and endeavor to
chart a peaceful, democratic, and
constitutional road to socialism in
America has also been approved

overwhelmingly. For this concept ex- T

presses what we American Com-
munists strive for, and is 3 fufthgf
development of our established posi-
tion. it embodies our basic view that
socialism can be established only
through a radical and fundamental
extension of American democracy
and a revolutionary transformation
of all property relations. And it em-
phasizes that all roads to socialism
are roads of mass struggle, waged
under the leadership of the working
class and its Marxist vanguard. But
i1OW.tl'11S. concept takes on new mean-
ing in light of the profoundly new
and favorable changes in world re-
lationships. .

The state conventions also reﬂect a
serious effort to come to grips with
the complex question of how we ful-

ﬁll our vanguard role under changed
conditions, at a time when the
merged AFL-CIO and other inﬂuen-
tial mass organizations are giving

_ day—to-day leadership in many im-

portant economic, social, and legis-
lative struggles.

There is an increased realization
that the Left, inclusive of the Com-
munists and other socialist—minded
forces, has a special contribution to
make in the struggle for militant and
united labor action; for defending
the economic interests, rights, and
social welfare of labor and its allies;
for trade—union autonomy and de-
mocracy; for organizing the unor-
ganized; for advancing the struggle
for Negro rights——including in. the
unions and on the job; for promot-
ing independent political action and

a broad people’s democratic alliance,.

having as one of its initial objectives
to break the Dixiecrat—GOP road-
block in Congress; and for promoting
labor’s solidarity at home and abroad.

There is also a growing under-
standing in our ranks that trade-
union rnilitancy does not automatic-
ally grow into socialist conscious-
ness; and that even very big strug-
gles do not imbue labor with class
consciousness, or spontaneously make
the working class aware of its class
role in leading the nation to the next
big democratic and social advance.

The state conventions further re-
veal that we are agreed on the need
to put an end to harmful bureau-
cratic practices, to the distortions
of democratic centralism, which

plagued us in the past and led to

many violations of inner-party de-
mocracy. There is emphatic agree-
ment on the paramount importance
of democratizing our Party.

There is also a realization that the
more truly democratic we become,
the more we need to be a cohesive
and united organization which guar-
antees the minority’s right to dissent
at all times, but does not at any time
give it a veto power over policies and
programs of action that have won
majority support.

Further, I believe that there is
much sober thought being given to
what we mean by a new and sounder
relationship with other Marxist par-
ties, including those in the socialist
countries.

We American Communists, who
have always constituted an independ-
ent American political party, have
been unaffiliated with and organiza-
tionally independent of other Marx-.
ist parties for nearly twenty years.
But we are only now beginning to
get straight on the need for achiev-
ing full independence of thought
withinpthe framework of a common
Marxist ideology; on the need to
combine our unshakable feelings of
close fraternal solidarity with all
Marxist p-arties with the under-
standing of the equality, creative re-
sponsibilities, and the independence
of our own indigenous Communist
movement.

There is no contradiction between
the true national interests of our own
people and the common working-
class interests of the peoples of all
countries. It is by starting with the

v—Ij\Ill—r| lvv

 

SESSIONS OF ' THE CONVENTION

needs and interests of our own peo-
ple and by creatively utilizing the
science of Marxism—Leninism to help
solve the problems of the American
people, to effectively resist and help
check the predatory drive of monop-
oly capital,—that we will best pro-
mote international working-class
solidarity and peace, that we will best
advance the friendship and anti—im-
perialist cooperation of the peoples
of the USA and Latin America,
Asia, Africa and Europe.

We still have a long way to go to
grasp the new relationships now de-
veloping among Marxist parties. For
the habits of nearly a life-time are
very diﬂicult to break. I-t will take a
long time to overcome the deeply in-
grained tendencies to try to apply
mechanically the experiences of other
Marxist parties, and to view uncrit-
ically, unscientiﬁcally, some of their
anaylses.

But in struggling to eradicate these
habits, we re-afﬁrm that there are
universally valid Marxist principles.
We condemn cynicism of and hos—
tility to the socialist countries and to
their Marxist parties. We reject any
view which sees only the gross viola-
tions of socialist principles which
have occurred, but does not see the
historical achievements of the USSR,
the Peoples Republic of China and
the other lands of socialism, and the
processes of self-correction and dy-
namic advance of these new social
systems which are now taking place.

Despite the “critics” of socialism,
it is the world of imperialism that is
in profound crisis, is becoming
smaller and is torn apart by insolu-

ble contradictions, whereas the so-
cialist third of the world is not “fall-
ing apart,” but is growing stronger.
It embraces almost a billion people
who are building a new society in
which the working people, for the
ﬁrst time in history, are shaping
their own destiny. And it is this de-
velopment which makes it possible
to prevent another world war and to
achieve peaceful coexistence.

We welcome and are proud of the
fraternal greetings we have received
at this convention from so many
Communist Parties of other lands.
We appreciate their observations and
expressions of solidarity. And we are
not taken aback by the fact that
among these valued greetings, here
and there, there may be an open or
an implied note of criticism.

In our judgment, mutual fraternal
exchanges of opinion and criticism
among Marxist parties is a beneﬁcial
and necessary development. We be-
lieve it is most useful when exercised
in a scientiﬁc, objective, and com-
radely way, on the basis of equality
and fraternity. ,

It is in this spirit that we are happy
to receive the greetings of all brother
parties. In respect to the ‘misgivings
expressed in the greetings signed by
Jacques Duclos, let me say that we‘
American Communists ﬁrmly be-
lieve in our great majority that the
main line of our convention resolu-
tions is Marxist-Leninist in content
and fully in accord with the interests
and democratic traditions of our
country, with proletarian solidarity
and with the new and ever develop-
ing generalized experience of the in-

ternational working class.

In any case, our decisions will be
our own, made by the collective
judgment of this convention, and
will be based on our Marxist under-
standing of American reality and the
needs of our people and nation.

After making the necessary amend-
ments, this convention, I trust, will
adopt the Draft Resolution and the
new Constitution. It will also act
upon a much—needed program of im-
mediate action. In mapping out such
a program, I hope the convention
will consider what can be done in-
dependently by the Party, as well as
what we can do in cooperation with
others to help promote the broadest
kind of unity of action. I

I hope we shall get away from
rigidly conceived national campaigns,
but rather seek ﬂexibly no focus at-
tention locally and in the states on
speciﬁc issues already projected by
the labor and people’s movements.

High among these are such vital
demands as: enforcement of desegre-
gation everywhere; reduction of the
arms budget; cutting of taxes on low
income groups; introduction of the
30-hour week; extension of social se-
curity; repeal of all legislation which
violates the Bill of Rights; banning
all H—bomb tests and atomic weap-
ons; the calling of a new Summit
Conference.

Whatever program of action we
proiect for the coming months, I am

To pose these key questions is to
suggest that one of our special and
major contributions will be made in
the ideological arena. I am not pro-
sure we shall give high priority to
waging a many-sided struggle for the
enactment of a federal civil rights
program. I hope that this program
will lay special stress on what can
be done to get city councils and state
legislatures, as well as trade—union lo-
cals and civic and church organiza-
tions, to memorialize Congress and
the President, as well as to act on
urgent community and shop de-
mands to end all jimcrow practices
in housing, schools, and employment.

This kind of activity would get
down to the grass roots level, and,
at the same time, exert effective in-
ﬂuence on Congress and the Admin-
istration, on state legislatures and
municipal councils, as well as on the
national mass organizations of the
people.

I strongly recommend a similar
approach to the supremely impor-
tant issue of banning the genocidal
H-bomb tests and weapons.

Whatever else this Convention
does, it must at least lay the foun-
dations for grappling with these big
mass problems which have been neg-
lected in the heat of our internal
struggle: how to expand our work-
ing—class base, ties, and inﬂuence;
how to help promote the united ac-
tion of labor, of Negro and white,
of the people against the trusts, the
white supremacists and the war-
mongers.

posing we become a Brain Trust,
or act like self-appointed “idea men”
for the existing mass organizations.
On the contrary. We must ourselves
engage more fully in all mass strug-
gles if we are to aid these movements
to attain their objectives, to go for-
ward and to deepen their under-
standing of all economic, social and
political issues.

The battle of ideas--in which the
monopolists have for too long main-
tained the initiative—is bound to
grow much sharper as we move
deeper into the age of atomic energy
and automation. Both their good and
evil potentialities are becoming ap-
parent to millions of Americans. But
these millions are not yet aware of
their collective power to decide the
outcome, and are still less conscious
that the die can be cast against catas-
trophe only through a united and
resolute mass anti-monopoly move-
ment, led by the working class.

Within this context there are, and
will be, new opportunities to advance
our basic socialist aims and concepts.
We should exercise a new initiative
to make known what we are doing
here to develop our program, to
widen the exchange of views among
those of socialist persuasion,'and to
reach new sections of the working
class with the goals, ideas, and prin-
ciples of scientiﬁc socialism, of Marx-
ism-Leninism.

To bring to the millions, already
concerned about the future, greater
consciousness of why and how its
shape will be determined by con-

53

certed popular mass action to curb
and eventually break the power of
the monopolies-this is labor’s and
our greatest challenge. The place to
carry on this education is in every
school of experience where large
numbers of people are learning
through mass activity.

In this connection, the Daily and
Sunday Worker, and the magazine,
Political A ﬂairs, can be exceptionally
signiﬁcant. This requires that we
take extraordinary measures to pre-
serve them and to increase their cir-
culation and use, and markedly im-
prove their Marxist content and
readability.

an as 1:

In emphasizing all of these ques-
tions, I do not mean to imply that
we are already out of the woods of
our internal diﬂiculties, or that the
crucial question of Party unity has
already been settled.

On the contrary. We still have
sharp and unresolved differences on
a host of vital questions. We still face
inﬂexible tendencies to crystallize an
extreme polarization of views which
foster dangerous divisions and fac-
tionalism.

Therefore one of the central ques-
tions before this Convention is: What
are some of the prerequisites for
achieving that principled unity
which is indispensable to the life and
progress of our Party, to enable us to
enhance our contributions to our
people and country?

Communist unity can be forged

working class, Marxist—Leninist prin-
ciples. These scientiﬁc and univer-
sally valid principles must be fought
for ﬁrmly, and in a comradely spirit.

But it is not enough to recite or
proclaim these Marxist principles.
They must be grasped scientiﬁcally
and applied creatively in accord with
the concrete conditions of our coun-
try and the needs of the American
working class. We need to study
more deeply the science of Marxism-
Leninism and American traditions
and conditions. We need to synthe-
size and enrich these, bearing in
mind the big and favorable changes
in the world and the new trends de-
veloping in our own country.

Our unity must be founded on a
common policy and on a practical
program of mass activity that ex-
presses the interests of the people,
and the collective experience and the
will of the majority of the Party
membership. I am conﬁdent that the
political orientation and the changes
proposed in the amended Draft
Resolution and the Draft Constitu-
tion will provide a sound basis for
such unity, and that it will be fur-
ther strengthened by the subsequent
drafting and adoption of a basic Par-

ty program.

I believe too that what has hap-
pened in regard to Party unity and
the lessons of the past decade under-
score the great need for boldly re-
freshing our Party leadership at all
levels, for effecting a united team
which embodies the best of the old
and the new, with special stress on

Negro, shop, trade union, women,
and youth representation.

# l 0

Let me also suggest a few addi-
tional guidepos-ts to aid us as We
strive to weld the unbreakable unity
our Party so sorely needs:

(I) The enemy of the American
people is our enemy. That enemy is
not here in Houston Street; its head-
quarters is in Wall Street. The dif-
ferences that divide us here are not
irreconcilable contradictions arising
from a conflict of class interests.
They are essentially conﬂicting
opinions of Communists which have
to be hammered out collectively, in
comradely discussion.

(2) We must therefore not per-

- mit criticism of the Party’s errors to

degenerate into undermining the
sterling contributions and role of our
Party. We must make sure that all
our criticism is constructive, that it
deals with issues on their merits, that
it does not degenerate into personal
viliﬁcation, and that it does not give
the class opponent comfort or polit-
ical ammunition. We may use a
sharp surgical knife to cut away the
chronic disease of dogmatism or to
curb the growth of revisionism. But
let us not forget that our purpose is
to save and strengthen the Party, and
that no operation can be considered
successful if it leaves the patient low
in morale, mutilated and half-dead.

(3) We must use our heads-not
lose them. It is better to make haste
slowly than to improvise gimmicks in
the false hope that we can come up

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

with all the answers at once. And in
this respect, we must understand that
this Convention cannot deﬁnitely de-
cide all questions with which we are
confronted.

(4) We must guard against one-
sidedness in our thinking, our work,
our decisions. For instance, I believe
my report to the April National
Committee meeting was correct in
emphasizing as the main danger the
serious left—sectarian errors of the
past and in sharply calling attention
to our weakness and defects for the
purpose o-f highlighting the crucial
need to overcome them.

However, that report would have
been better balanced if it had pre-
sented more fully the positive and
noteworthy contributions of our
Party during the cold—war decade,
and if it had forewarned more ex-
plicitly against the growth of right-
opportunist tendencies in our sharp
turn against Left—sectaria.nism.

The curse of one-sideness has be-
come even more pronounced since
the emergence of new problems and
points of controversy. This is all too
evident in the approach of many
comrades to the inter—acting dangers
of left-sectarianism and right—oppor—
tunism—both of which are clear and
present today.

Dogmatism and doctrinairism are
still the main danger, and will be
the main danger and the chief ob-
stacle to eﬁecting a decisive turn in
our relations with masses for some
time to come. They are too deep-
seated to be eradicated by the mere

55

adoption of resolutions. They still
aﬁlict our mass work and policies.
They even lead to a narrow and un-
dialectical approach to such pro-
found Marxist-Leninist documents
as the recent statement of the Com-
munist Party of China, “On the His-
torical Experience of the Dictator-
ship of the Proletariat.”*

Therefore it is necessary to wage
the most resolute and systematic
struggle against dogmatism and left-
sectarianism. At the same time, we
must sharpen up and wage a more
determined struggle against oppor-
tunist and revisionist tendencies
which, far from disappearing, are
growing in our Party.

Another, thing: in the process of
correcting mistakes, whether of the
“Left” or “Right” variety, we have
too often failed to help friends and
allies understand what it is we are
trying to correct—and why. It does
not necessarily follow that when we
make changes in policy we also break
off united front relationships, as we
seem to have thought sometimes in
the past. We are agreed that in
many instances, our estrangement
from the Left and Center forces in
the trade unions was largely our
fault. Let us try to correct our mis-
takes in a manner that will help end
those estrangements and establish
new mass ties and cooperative rela-
tions.

We are going to need a lot of pa-
tience with each other, and with old

friends and allies whose patience we
have sometimes tried to the breaking
point. In the past period some com-
rades have left us because of the im-
pact of certain grievous departures
from Leninist principles in the so-
cialist countries, as well as because
of our slowness in overcoming our
own internal mistakes and diﬂicul—
ties. We should not forget that most
of these stood ﬁrm during the rough-
est days of the cold war and Mc-
Carthyite hysteria, and that today
most of them are not lacking in
courage, and that many remain ad-
herents of socialism.

Let us be slow to condemn the
temporarily disoriented, and ever
ready to help those who wish to ﬁnd
their way back eventually, or who

presently may engage us in friendly-

discussion or join in united-front
activity on certain speciﬁc issues. Let
us distinguish between those who
have been shaken by recent events
and seek clarity, and those who have
forsaken Marxist principles.’ But at
all times let us vigorously defend
the honor, integrity and morale of
our Party.

Finally, let us remember that there
is legitimate place in our ranks for
differences of opinion, both before
and after the majority arrives at a
decision. But there is no place in
our Party for factions or factional-
ism.

At this critical juncture in our
Party’s life and history, we would
do well to heed the sage counsel
of Abraham Lincoln: “A house di-
vided against itself cannot stand.”

If we collectively keep uppermost
in our thinking and endeavors the
common socialist aims and principles
to which we are dedicated, then I
am confident that our house shall
stand and will be built ever strong-
er; and the ties of comradeship and
high purpose which bind us and all
other like—minded people can and will
be strengthened.

# =5 5*

Comrades, today our Party is small
in numbers and in many parts of
the country is relatively limited in
its mass inﬂuence. But we are learn-
ing from our mistakes. We are
looking and moving forward. In
the process we are beginning to es-
tablish new mass ties and relation-
ships with valuable friends and al-
lies.

Moreover, we are a party in league
with the future, a party based upon
and representing the fundamental
interests of the American working
class—Negro and white. We are an
American party, based on the tradi-
tions of Sylvis, Debs, and Ruthen-
berg—and with ideological ties of
fraternal kinship to the hundreds of
millions moving toward world
peace, national liberation, and social-
ism. We should not lose sight of
that truth, even though now and
then the winds shift.

Frederick Douglass once wisely ob-
served that: “If there is no struggle,
there is no progress.”

Well, comrades, struggle is what
we are going to have plenty of. For
whatever the state of the economic
barometer, political and economic

struggles of great magnitude lie
ahead. .

Labor, the Negro people, and the
great mass of Americans are unwill-
ing, as they are unable, to retreat
before monopoly’s offensive against
their living standards, their demo-
cratic rights, and their peace aspira-
tions. Nor are labor and the peo-
ple, in this era of automation and
atomic energy, either able or willing
just to stand still. Our Party’s abil-
ity to contribute more effectively to
the American people’s struggle to de-
fend what they have won and take
a giant step forward will depend,
to no small extent, on how we meet
the challenge that now confronts us.
V Our task is indeed a diﬂicult one.
But if the convention tackles it
boldly, with conﬁdence in America’s
working people, and with truly crea-
tive Marxist—Leninist understanding,
I am sure we will make the neces-
sary changes and do what needs to
be done. [Applause.]

From the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union: '

To the 16th National Convention,
Communist Party, U.S.A.:

Fraternal greetings to the 16th Con-
vention of the CPUSA from the CP USSR.
The Communists in our country are watch-
ing with warmest sympathy how your
Party is coping with the great hardships
imposed on you in the recent period. All
the activities and struggles of your Party
prove that you have no other interests than

57

the interests of the working class and all
working people of the U.S.A.

The CPUSA consistently defends the
democratic rights of the American people,
continues and develops the best tradi-
tions of Lincoln, Jefferson, Debs and Ruth-
enberg and other outstanding sons of
America. Your Party exposes the con-
spiracies of aggressive American circles
attempting to turn the people toward a new
war.

The American Communists are ﬁghting
heroically for the preservation of the
Party, for strengthening the unity of its
ranks on the basis of tested Marxist-
Leninist principles. In its ﬁght for the
rights of the working class the CPUSA is
striving to safeguard fraternal ideolo-gical
relationships with other Communist and
workers’ parties which is sacred for the ad-
vanced workers of all countries on the
principles of proletarian internationalism.

We wish the Party of the U.S.A. suc-
cess in the struggle for the democratic
rights of the American people——for the
economic interests of the working class
and all working people of the U.S.A., for
the further ideological and organizational
strengthening of the Party.

May the friendship and cooperation of
the people of the Soviet Union and the
people of the United States, for the mutual
beneﬁt of our countries and for peace
in the whole world, strengthen and ﬂour-

C/1.: We have reached the sched-
uled time for the address of the
Chairman of our Party, Comrade Bill
Foster, who is seated here on my
left, and I recognize at this time
Comrade Ben Davis, who has been
asked to read to the convention the
remarks of Comrade Foster. (Ap-
plause.) ‘

William Z. Foster: Comrades:

The crisis afflicting our Party is

58 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

both organizational and ideological.
Among its main origins are: the
corruptive effects of imperialism upon
the working class and the Party dur-
ing the many years of “capitalist
prosperity”; the protracted attack of
the Government upon the Party; the
many serious left-sectarian mistakes
made by us during the cold war
years; the negative results of the
Stalin revelations; the serious Right
mistakes of recent months-and all
these factors operating in a rapidly
changing national and world situa-
tion.

My remarks are not an opposition
report to Comrade Dennis’ keynote
speech; they also do not constitute
a separate program, nor are they so
presented. They do, however, em-
brace fundamental steps necessary
for the Party, and they have all been
matters of serious dispute in the top
leadership of the Party, of which the
Convention is entitled to a clear pic-
ture. My remarks are not directed
against the main resolution as such,
but to amend, strengthen, and adopt
it, as has been done in the various
state conventions. The political de-
marcation in the Party has not been
between supporters and opponents of
the main resolution, but between
those who want to maintain the
Communist Party and those who
would give it up for a political action
association. Now to my specific re-
marks and proposals:

1. Re-aﬁirm the continued exis-
tence of the Communist Party: By
eliminating the central question of
dispute in the Party—the political
action association—-this action is the
main single thing the convention
must accomplish. For months there
has been an intense agitation in the
Party by the Right tendency to the
effect that we should transform the
Communist Party into a political
action association—as proposed con-
cretely by Comrade Gates in the
November 1956 number of Political
Aﬁairs. But such a step would mark
the end of the Party as a fighting
organization and would reduce it to
a body of socialist propaganda. It

would also largely liquidate our

forces, because it could not have a
mass character. It would likewise
worsen our position among the broad
masses, as it would be highly vul-
nerable to charges of being a sinister
“boring—from-within” body. And it
would provoke fresh governmental
attacks upon us by appearing as a
legal maneuver upon our part. The
whole thing is only a resurrection
of the discarded Browder Commun-
ist Political Association of 1944-45.
Its formation would constitute a dis-
astrous step backward for us in the
face of militant American imperial-
ism, and it would be so understood
by our friends and foes.

The advocates of the association,
which is the heart of the Right pro-

SESSIONS 01-‘ THE CONVENTION 59

gram, have pressed it upon the Party
with such vigor that the very life of
the Party became threatened with a
factional split. However, the rank
and ﬁle, as soon as they grasped the
import of the political action asso-
ciation, let it be known, in the con-
ventions and in the press, that they
did not want this liquidatory organi-
zation but were determined to main-
tain the Communist Party. This
membership response caused the

sponsors of the association to make-

a sudden move to save their project
by by-passing the national conven-
tion. That is, the convention should
not vote on the association, but
should delegate the question to a
continuing Party discussion, with its
solution delayed indeﬁnitely.

This is a dangerous proposal; if
successful, it would; sen'tenc)_e the
Party to a protracted factional strug-
gle over the issue, thereby imperil-
ling the life of the Party. It would
also be a grave violation of Party
democracy, by preventing the dele-
gates from voting on a vital matter
which they had been discussing for
months. Unfortunately, the National
Committee, in its “Name and Form”
Amendment III, supported the prop-
osition. But again the rank and ﬁle
had a different idea. In the state
conventions they have been voting
overwhelmingly for the Party and
against an association.

In this respect, the New York

State convention spoke out very clear-
ly and emphatically. Comrade Ben
Davis introduced a resolution pro-
viding for an endorsement of the
Party, a rejection of the association,
and the reference of any further dis-
cussion on the matter to the National
Committee. This proposition was
well received by the delegates, and
Comrade George Charney of the
State Committee joined with Com-
rade Davis in re—introducing the res-
olution jointly as a unity proposal.
With enthusiasm, the convention al-
most unanimously adopted it. This
New York action points the main
way to Party unity. If similar action
is taken by this convention it will
avert the danger of a split by remov-
ing the contentious association ques-
tion from factional struggle.

In disposing of the political action
association, however, let us not fall
victims to a drive from the Right for
a so—called new mass party of social-
ism. For such a body there is no
prospect in the political situation,
neither now nor in the foreseeable
future. It must be held as a future
perspective. Untimely action by us
in this direction would be just about
as harmful as turning the Party into
a political action association. This
convention should let it be known
that it is resolved to build the Com-
munist Party and not some futile,
opportunistic substitute for it.

2. Re-endorse the Party’: theoret-

 -,’-

ical base of Marxism—Leninism: To
take this action decisively is of fun-
damental importance for the life
and growth of the Communist
Party. During the past year there
has been an incessant campaign by
the Right in the Party press and
elsewhere against Marxism—Lenin-
ism. This has gone on virtually un-
challenged by the National Board.
They try to separate Marxism from
Leninism. The central idea in this
campaign is that, whereas Marxism
is of universal validity, Leninism, as
basically a product of the Russian
Revolution, has only limited valid-
ity. Especially it is said to be left-
sectarian so far as the United States

is concerned. This is Right revision— .

ism, which goes in the general direc-
tion of Social Democracy. If it
should prevail in our ranks it would
cut the heart out of American Com-
munism.

Unfortunately, much of this in-
correct line has been injected into
our draft resolutions for the conven-
tion, including the main resolution,
the constitution, and others. Thus,
the term “Marxism—Leninism” was
stricken from the Party preamble;
the concept of the Party’s vanguard
role has been weakened, and demo-
cratic centralism has been rejected
in principle. But worse yet, in the
main resolution the Party’s accept-
ance of Marxism—Leninism has been
made conditional. This document

endorsed Marxism—Leninism only to
the extent that it is “interprete ” by
the C.P.U.S.A. Such a concept would
at once strip Marxism—Leninism of its
scientiﬁc and its international char-
acter and reduce it to a matter of
innumerable national interpreta-
tions. This is an impossible position
for a Communist Party. It was in
an effort to get this concept changed
that I voted against the resolution.

In its letter of greetings, signed
by Secretary Iacques Duclos, the
Central Committee of the Commu-
nist Party of France is correct in
warning us of revisionist tendencies
in our Party. Many in our Party
have been saying this for months
past. And its truth is manifested by
the many basic amendments made
in our main resolution by the vari-
ous state conventions. This conven-
tion should welcome the sage and
friendly advice of our French com-
rades as well as others. Of course,
the convention will work out its pol-
icies and estimates upon the basis of
American and international condi-
tions.

Obviously, we should support
Marxism—Leninism, not as a dogma
but as a guide to action. We should
ﬂexibly develop and apply it to spe-
ciﬁc American conditions, with a
constant alert against every form of
doctrinairism. At the same time, we
must recognize the universal truth
of the vast body of Marxism—Lenin-

SESSIONS OF  CONVENTION 61

ism as the science of the world pro-
letariat. These elementary facts were
again made clear to us in the recent
splendid document of the Chinese
Communist Party. Our national con-
vention should re-aﬂirm clearly the
Party’s endorsement of Marxism-
Leninism, and also take the neces-
sary steps to cleanse its convention
documents of the various revisionist
conceptions that have been injected
into them. Along with the re-aﬂ°1rma-
tion of the Communist Party itself,
this re—dedication to Marxism—Lenin-
ism is the most vital business before
this convention.

During the long Party discussion
the rank and ﬁle of the Party have
also let their voice be heard upon
this matter. They have declared un-
equivocally for a Marxist—Leninist
Party. So clear has been their voice
that some Party leaders who only a
few months ago were speaking out
against Marxism—Leninism, are now
proclaiming themselves and the
Party to be Marxist—Leninist. The
national convention should declare
its adherence to the fundamental
principles of Marxism—Leninism.
Without such an unequivocal state-
ment, our Party would be in danger
of political bankruptcy.

3. Changes in the Party’: struc-
ture, policies, and methods: In order
to cope with the political urgency
of the rapidly changing national and
international situations, to lift the

Party out of its critical position, to
apply the deep-going lessons of the
Stalin cult of the individual, and
generally to re—establish its mass
strength and prestige, the CPUSA
must improve itself in many direc-
tions: in its organization, in its ideol-
ogy, in its leadership, in its policies,
and in its methods of work. The
whole Party is conscious of this
need for change and progress.

Under the general head of
“change,” the Right tendency, how-
ever, advocates proposals which, if
adopted, would be disastrous for the
Party. Among them are: to aban-
don the Party for a political action
association, to consider a “new mass
Party of socialism” as an early possi-
bility, to devitalize Marxism—Lenin-
ism, to develop a pro-Tito interna-
tional course, and to destroy the pro-
gressive and heroic history of the
Communist Party by a reckless, dis-
torted and damaging criticism, as ex-
empliﬁed in the Schrank New York
report, in the “Vanguard Role”
Amendment, in the published trade
union “material,” and in various
other documents.

Our Party does not need nor
want such destructive projects of
“change” as the Right tendency has
been proposing. It does want, how-
ever, the numerous constructive
changes that have been proposed in
the Party discussion, many of which
have been incorporated in conven-

 

62 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

tion documents. These include:
Marxism—Leninism, freed from all
forms of dogmatism and doctrinair-
ism and closely developed and ap-
plied to the American situation; more
Party democracy, less bureaucracy,
and a Party discipline based upon
democratic agreement and not upon
“commands”; greater participation
of the membership in policy—mak-
ing; more genuine self—criticism by
the leadership; a refreshment and re-
organization of leading bodies upon
a local, district, and national scale;
broader united front practices and
less sectarian conceptions of the
Party’s vanguard role; more coop-
erative relations with other Ameri—

can Left groupings; comradely criti- A

cism of brother Communist Parties
and the countries of socialism; the
cultivation of more political initia-
tive by the Party, etc. In this spirit
the convention should handle the
general question of Party change
and progress.

4. Solve the Party leadership
crisis: For the past year especially,
the Party has been experiencing a
grave crisis of leadership, which is
one of the major causes of its crisis
in general. It has done far more
to disorient the Party than the gov-
ernment attack upon us. This lead-
ership crisis has been marked by
many of the leaders going far to the
Right themselves, or by their deﬁ-
nitely conciliating the Right. Con-
sequently, the top Party committees

have failed to give ﬁrm leadership
to the Party during these critical
months. This failure has much to do
with the present low prestige of the
leaders in the Party. In New York
State the leadership crisis is particu-
larly acute. It is a basic task of the
convention to strengthen the Party
leadership, especially in the National
Committee and the National Board.
To this end there must be more
worker members, and fresh leading
forces brought in, especially mass-
workers —— proletarians, Negroes,
youth, and women. We must become
really the Party of the working class.
The leadership must be required to
practice more self—criticism and to
operate within the framework of a
democratic centralism closely keyed
to American conditions and tradi-
tions. The Party especially needs
staunch leaders—who believe in the
Party and will ﬁght for its program.
We must have leaders with prestige,
but we must not spoil them with
adulation, and especially we must
not allow them to develop bureau-
cratic habits. While reducing our
excessive numbers of full—timers, we
must also maintain a strong core
of “professional revolutionaries.”
One of the keys to the Party’s
present difliculties, and particularly
to its leadership crisis, is the fact
that during recent diﬂicult months
the Party has been led, especially
in the National Board, by a work-
ing combination of the Right and

some comrades who, while not
themselves Rights, nevertheless run
a sort of political interference for
the Right. The Right has its main
strength in the New York State
Committee and in the staff of the
Daily Worker. It also acquires much
help from the above described con-
ciliationism. This is the main reason
why, in the Board, the Right, al-
though a minority in the Party, has
been able to write so much of its line
into the policy and convention docu-
ments of the Party. To eliminate
such conciliation practices is one of
the important changes needed by the
Party.

5. The ideological ﬁg/2t on two
fronts: A major cause of the confu-
sion in our Party during the past year
has been the abandonment by the
Party leadership of the Leninist pol-
icy of the ﬁght on two fronts. When
the National Committee began its
sharp attack against left—sectarianism
at its April meeting, it was necessary
also to issue a warning against the
outcropping Right danger. This was
an ABC matter of practical need to
prevent a pendulum swing to the
Right, for this wrong trend also had
roots in the Party. But this was not
done, and those who proposed that
attention be paid to the rapidly
sprouting Right were accused of try-
ing to cover up left—sectarian mis-
takes. Not until September was a
warning issued against the Right

danger, and this was so toothless
that even the comrades on the Right
voted for it. Not until this day has
the national leadership made any seri-
our criticism of Right tendencies in
the Party. The general result has
been that the Right has grown like
a bay tree.

The national convention should
change this impossible situation by
putting the Party’s ideological strug-
gle on a two-front basis, with the
main weight directed against left-
sectarianism. This is the traditional
weakness of the Party, especially
with regard to doctrinairism and
wrong methods of work, as was es-
pecially manifest during the diﬂicult
cold war years of struggle against
fascism and the war danger. I my-
self made my share of these errors of
the characteristic sectarian type of
the period. It is a misjudgment of
my position, however, to allege that
I now underestimate them. If I have
not seemed to dwell upon them so
much as some other comrades, it was
because my attention has been di-
rected so largely towards defending
our basic theory of Marxism-Lenin-
ism and also the very existence of
our Party itself from the sweeping
attacks that were being made by the
Right against them.

The danger from the Right has
been discussed very little during
these past months, although it is now
threatening the life of the Party. It

has its main roots in the “prosperity
illusions” generated among the
workers and in our Party, and by
the many—years-long boom period.
Thus, this Right tendency is a di-
rect political descendant of the Love-
stone opportunism of the boom
192o’s and the Browder revisionism
of the boom I94o’s. The Right trend
manifests itself by a softening of
the Party’s theory and ﬁghting poli-
cies, and it po-ints in the direction
of class collaboration. It has
worsened all the problems that the
Party has had to contend with dur-
ing the past period. Its main out-
look is for a minimum of class strug-
gle; it seeks to emasculate Marxism-
Leninism; it plays down the Negro
question, and it makes the parlia-
mentary road to socialism appear as a
mild evolutionary advance, instead
of the sharp class struggle that it
will be. The danger of the Right
tendency has been fully demon-
strated by the bitter factional strug-
gle it has been carrying on dur-
ing recent months for its proposal to
transform the Communist Party into
a political action association.

6. For a class struggle program of
work: It is fundamental that this
convention should produce an eEec-
tive program of immediate tasks and
should organize the Party to put this
into effect. It should also lay the
basis for a general Party program,
embracing such questions as an anal-

ysis of the industrial outlook, a re-
statement of the Negro question, the
perspective for a Labor-Farmer party,
a rehandling of basic trade union
questions, a clear statement of the
American road to socialism, and
many other problems——all this, of
course, to be tied in with the Party’s
ﬁght for an anti—monopoly coalition.

The Right tendency in the Party,
like that of Lovestone and Browder
before it, tends to overestimate the
strength of American imperialism.
It plays down the effects of the gen-
eral crisis of world capitalism, so
far as the United States is concerned.
For the Right, too, the possibility
of a serious American economic
crisis is virtually excluded. The in-
evitable conclusion from such ideas
is a perspective of little class strug-
gle, as illustrated in Comrade Gates’
article in the November 1956 P0-
litical Aﬁairs, and of sharp tenden-
cies to minimize the vanguard role
of the Communist Party. Such
trends have been injected into the
published material for a trade—union
resolution, in which class collabora-
tion, the policy of the AFL-CIO
top leadership, is glossed over as of
no particular importance, instead of
being characterized as a deadly dan-
ger.

Contrary to such revisionist ideas,
our Party must base itself squarely
upon an outlook of sharpening class
struggle. It must realize that world

 

V1

 

w;3’»=‘>~::;‘ 2-,  .  3 .

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 65

capitalism is sinking into general
crisis in the face of the rising so-
cialist world, and that the United
States, although still very powerful,
is no basic exception to the general
capitalist crisis. The present high
industrial activity in the United
States is essentially temporary in
character. The workers, the Negro
people, and other democratic strata,
face a perspective of increasing class
struggle, in which they will be com-
pelled to defend their living stand-
ards, their organizations, and their
civil liberties. It is upon such a per-
spective that we should base our
tasks and general program, and not
one of a placid evolutionary ad-
vance. Only with such a ﬁghting
perspective can we build, on the
domestic ﬁeld, the an.ti—monopoly
coalition, or be a factor in ﬁghting,
on the international scale, fo-r the
peaceful coexistence of all nations.
Only thus, too, can we think realis-
tically of the American road to so-
cialism.

7. Strengthen the Party’: interna-
tionalismz The CPUSA must, of
course, base its policies upon speciﬁc
American conditions and upon the
class and national interests of the
working class, the Negro people, and
other democratic strata who form the
great majority of the American
people. This, however, in no way
conﬂicts with the Party’s need to
carry on a vigorous international

struggle for such overriding inter-
ests as peaceful coexistence of all
nations, world socialism, and other
issues. The true national and inter-
national interests of the people are
harmonious, not contradictory. Our
Party———an American party——indepen-
dent, and Leninist—mus»t cooperate
freely with all other Communist par-
ties.

A marked phase of our Party's

present crisis is a serious weakening‘

of its proletarian internationalism.
This is partly an “over-correction”

of errors made in this sphere during _p

the Stalin regime, but mostly be-
cause of the pressure of the very
sharp imperialist influences upon the
Party. This weakness manifests it-
self, among other tendencies, by an
underestimation . of the war danger
and of the aggressive role of Ameri-
can imperialism, by virtually ignor-
ing the general crisis of world capi-
talism, by a certain acceptance of the
bourgeois theory of American excep-
tionalism, by sniping at the Soviet
Union, by cultivating a pro-Tito
orientation, by scorn for the opinions

,of foreign comrades regarding our

Party’s policies, etc. Such incorrect
ideas, freely expressed, have done
grave damage to our press and also
the Party, by isolating us- from the
American workers and from the
world Communist forces.

Our worst mistake in this general _

respect was in connection with P0.-

.._.......,.....;. :‘  .  ,-

 

 

 

 

66 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

land and Hungary. Here we tended
to put the national question of po-
litical independence ahead of the
higher questions of world peace and
socialism. While criticism of the
Hungarian and Soviet Communists
for previous mistakes was undoubt-
edly in order, our press greatly over-
did the matter. The National Com-
mittee also misunderstood the grave
danger of war and to socialism that
had been provoked by American im-
perialism in this crucial situation.
This wrong line was especially ex-
pressed by the National Committee
Resolution of November 20, in which,
overlooking the “grim necessity” of
the situation, it took the impossible
position of neither justifying nor
condemning the Soviet military oc-
cupation of that country. This was
an impermissible yielding before ag-
gressive American imperialism.

To re—strengthen the proletarian
internationalism of our Party stands
as a major task for this convention.
Especially we must revamp the Na-
tional Committee position on Hun-
gary, recognizing that under the ex-
isting dangerous circumstances the
military and political actions taken
by the Soviet Union in helping to
defend Hungarian socialism against
the acute threat of fascism and war
was imperative.

8. The Convention must establish
Party unity: For almost a year now
our Party has been stirred by an in-
tense discussion. On the whole much

good has come from this, but there
has also been the danger of a split.
Now the Party is demanding that
unity be established and the Party
get to work among the masses. This
convention, therefore, should put the
matter of Party unity to the fore-
front in all its work and strive for
this unity around a Marxist—Leninist
program.

Party unity can be achieved only
upon a sound political basis. It can-
not be Won by bridging over dis-
puted questions, as has been tried
by the National Committee on re-
cent occasions. I refer particularly
to the impossible straddle our Party
made on the vital question of Hun-
gary, in which we neither condoned
nor condemned the Soviet military
occupation of that country in No-
vember. Of the same type of straddle
is the proposal, contained in Amend-
ment III on “Name and Form,”
which would have us take the disas-
trous step of not voting in this con-
vention upon the political action as-
sociation. In the same category are
the placing in the main resolution
of incorrect “unity” formulations of
Marxism—Leninism and the statement
that the political action association
is not liquidationist. These straddles,
however well-intentioned, in no way
promote Party unity, but instead
conciliate the Right tendency in the
Party. Such wrong formulations
should be corrected by the conven-
tron.

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 67

In its work to establish Party unity,
the convention should seize upon the
key link in the chain. This it can do
by promptly taking a decisive vote
upon the political action association.
It would be a tragic mistake to by-
pass such a vote. As I have men-
tioned earlier, the New York State
convention hit precisely the right
note in this respect. Its unity reso-
lution reads as follows, and I move
that it be adopted:

“Rcsolz/ea’, that this convention
aﬂirms the continuation of the
Communist Party of the United
States and opposes its replacement
by a political action association;
and be it further

“Resolved, that this decision does
not foreclose further exploration
and discussion as organized by the
incoming National Committee.”

By thus fully re-afﬁrming the ba-
sis of the Party and by removing
the political action association as a
matter of factional controversy, a
fundamental groundwork would be
laid for developing Party unity. This
would not settle all questions in dis-
pute, but it would provide a far
more favorable basis for their ob—
jective consideration. The conven-
tion would do well to adopt the New
York unity resolution at the outset
of its proceedings and thus strike
a decisive blow for Party unity, the
effects of which would be cumula-
tive all through the convention.

In conclusion, let me re-emphasize
that objective conditions are growing
more and more favorable for our
Party. New possibilities for struggle
are opening up. A deep—going stir
is taking place in the broad ranks
of the trade—union movement and
the Negro people, displaying a mag-
niﬁcent spirit of struggle, are the
vanguard of the democratic masses.
Internationally, the forces of social-
ism, learning the hard lessons of
the Stalin revelations, are girding
themselves for a new push forward
towards world socialism, while the
forces of bankrupt world capitalism
are experiencing one defeat after
the other.

In this vast ﬁeld of struggle our
Party has a vital role to play. Our
convention, by establishing Party
unity around a sound Marxist-Lenin-
ist program and leadership, can over-
come the crisis that has been crip-
pling the Party. We need a will to
unity. If we will rise to the impor-
tance of our Party tasks in the spirit
of the many lessons We have learned
during our long and rich Party dis-
cussion, we will be surprised at the
speed with which our Party can im-
prove its legal position, strengthen
its ranks, break its isolation, and
again become a real factor in the
growing struggles of the working
class, the Negro people, and all the
democratic forces in this country.
(Applause.)

68 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

MORNING SESSION

February 10, 1957

Dorothy Healey (California) in
the Chair.

Ben Davis: It is my privilege to
read to you greetings to the wives
and families of those who are now
in prison. In doing so, I wish to
preface the greetings with the fol-
lowing remarks: First I consider this
a very important moment in our
Party’s convention and I am sure
we all would regard it with funda-
mental, touching and human im-
portance apart from its great political
importance that we should.

One of the most heroic chapters of
our Party’s life is the way it stood like
an oak against the storms of McCarthy-
ism, war hysteria and persecutions of the
last few years. No greater symbol of this
heroism exists than the list of our comrades
who are Smith Act victims now in prison.
The names of our Communist leaders who
now have numbers are: Bob Thomp-son,
Henry Winston, Gus Hall, Gil Green, Alex
Bittelman, V. J. Jerome, Louis Weinstock,
Pettis Perry, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Irv-
ing Potash, Arno-ld Johnson. Nor will we
forget Comrades Claudia [ones and John
Williamson who were ruthlessly torn from
our midst and from their homes.

We greet the wives of these leaders,
their sons and daughters and loved ones.
We greet each and every one of our com-
rades and co-workers who are in prison
through their loved ones. Let me extend
this National Convention’s deepest appre-
ciation to each of the wives for their
staunchness, their courage, their initia-
tive and their leadership. Let us con-
gratulate them for serving as father and
mother to their families, their children,
under great handicaps and despite painful

suffering, frequently not basically or suf-
ﬁciently understood by our Party and by
us individually. Most of the wives have
become leaders in their own right. They
have worked imaginatively, broadly, ef-
fectively bringing to the aid of their hus-
bands forces and voices never before
raised in our country in behalf of so
noble a cause.

They have demonstrated that there is
no facet of life and struggle that will not
yield its mysteries to the advanced theory
of Marxism-Leninism. The pity of it is
that too often they have worked alone.
How many of us can say that we have
planned and fought for the freedom of
our Smith Act comrades as Communists
should? If we haven't it can only mean
that we have not basically understood
this question and its far-reaching signiﬁ-
cance. In this respect the wives have set
our whole Party an example. We cannot
heed this example until we wage a piti-
less struggle against bureaucracy, until
we restore to its rightful place in our
Party that human warmth which is the
essence of Marxism-Leninim and which
is one of the finest traits of our proud
people, the American people. No Commu-
nist Party is worth its salt if it does
not ﬁght for its own leaders.

The central challenge before us is the
case of Bob Thompson. He ﬁrst miracu-
lously escaped death when his skull was
broken by a fascist-minded criminal whose
mind was crazed by the war hysteria of
the sanctimonious “peace-lovers” in Wash-
ington. Twice since he has undergone
operations under prison conditions, either
one of which could have meant his life.
Despite everything, he is now recovering.
We must free Bob Thompson. We can
free Bob Thompson. With the know-
how of our comrades, were our Party in
its full ﬁghting trim, we could do so in
association with others almost by a snap
of the ﬁnger.

We can do so now, if we cut through
the fog of timidity, o-f self-ﬂaggelation and
downheartedness that tends to sap our
self-conﬁdence. We have played a major
role in freeing frame—up victims when
there was no world socialist system, when
Asia and Africa were much more quiet,

and can we not do so today when the
growth of socialist ideas in the world is
one of the main reasons that compels
the capitalist press in our own country
to hang on to every word of our conven-
tion? We can. We need the understand-
ing and we need the will. We are in this
Convention forging the policies and sharp-
ening our skills and our political weap-
ons.

These men are Smith Act prisoners by
the will of reaction and its Washington
government. We shall hold the government
responsible, that means Eisenhower and his
billion--dollar Cabinet, for their safety and
their welfare.

To you, the wives, you are American
patriots, devoted mothers, and among the
ﬁnest of American womanhood. In ﬁghting
for the freedom of your husbands and loved
ones, you are contributing to the peace and
democratic progress of our entire nation.
You are upholding the Bill of Rights. We
love you and we are proud of you. This
Convention stand-s solidly with you and
pledges that we shall renew our determi-
nation for the ﬁght for the immediate
freedom of your loved ones in prison.

Now, comrades, I propose that we adopt
the following greetings: ’

“Dear Comrades, the 16th National Con-
vention of the Communist Party of the
U.S.A. greets you. We express to you our
profound comradely regrets that our com-
rades are, through imprisonment, absent
from this historic gathering. To you, whose
loved ones are in prison, we in this Con-
vention treasure the hope for their speedy
release. We pledge that every effort shall
be made to achieve this end. The demo-
cratic spirit of the American people is
not dead. It is rising. Once again we
will clasp hands with those who because
of their love of the people, their love
of truth and justice and peace, and their
hatred of man’s oppression of his fellow
rhnan, were arbitrarily thrust behind prison

ars.

“The cause of the people moves for-
ward. Its triumph is inevitable. We
salute you.

Comradely,

16th National Convention

of the Communist Party.”
[Applause]

Chairman: It has been moved and sec-
onded to adopt this greeting. [Vote taken.]
Adopted. In the same sense we recommend
for your consideration the following mes-
sage of greeting to a number of our com-
rades who have been deported from our
country and our labor movement:

“Dear comrades, the 16th National Con-
vention of the Communist Party sends you
from afar its warmest comradely greet-
ings. Your splendid contribution to our
Party's activities have not been forgotten.
Never were they more sorely needed than
at this hour when we are confronted with
the most varied and perplexing problems,
and our deliberations will be poorer be-

cause of your absence. We pledge you

who for reasons beyond control were forced
to leave near and dear friends and rela-
tives, we will conduct a ceaseless ﬁght
for your return. We remain fast in our
opposition to deportations such as yours.
And we are unalterably opposed to the
dissolution of families by government edict.
We believe that deportation based upon
political dissent does violence to the
spirit and letter of the Constitution of
our country.

“We are sure that those among whom
you now live and work are the richer for it
and that you are advancing the interest
of the people, defending the conception
of co-existence in the interests of peace.
Through you we send greetings to the
people in whose midst you have found a
haven. Tell them we -stand for the de-
fense of peace in the interest of the peo-
ples of the world.

“Until we meet again, we are
Comradely yours,

16th National Convention
of the Communist Party.”

[Motion carried unanimously to transmit
these greetings] ‘

Ch.: In addition, Comrade Ed Strong,
one of the leading national comrades of
our Party, distinguished Negro leader of
our Party, is in the hospital. It 15 pro-
posed that this convention .send greet-
ings to Comrade Strong, with warmest
wishes for his immediate. speedy re-
covery. [Motion is carned.l

 

7o PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

C/2.: The next thing on the agen-
da that we voted for yesterday is
the report of the Sub-committee of
the Constitution Committee on
Name and Form. I recognize Oleta
O’Connor Yates.

Oleta O'Connor Yates (Califor-
nia): Comrade Chairman and Com-
rades: In reporting for the Sub-
committee of the Constitution Com-
mittee on Name and Form, there
are ﬁrst a few remarks to be made
on behalf of the Committee.

As to the composition of this com-
mittee, it was representative of sev-
eral states and districts, including
New York, California, Massachu-
setts, New Jersey, Eastern Pennsyl-

vania and Illinois. The committee

likewise contained exponents of
varying viewpoints on the question
of name and form, including those
positions that have been so strongly
marked in New York State in par-
ticular. The Chairman of the Com-
mittee was Oleta Yates of Califor-
nia, the co-secretaries of the com-
mittee, Charles Loman of New York,
Sam Coleman of New York. The
Sub-committee which was delegated
to prepare the recommendations for
the convention, after discussion in
the full committee, contained the
following people: Pat Tloo-hey,

“Charles Loman and Oleta Yates.

The recommendations which this
committee will present to the con-
vention were voted unanimously by

the entire membership of the com-
mittee.

As to the materials which this
committee had before it, there were
24 resolutions from sections or divi-
sions, club-s, individuals and groups
of individuals, representing a host
of different positions on name and
form. There were 3 resolutions from
large county organizations, all of
which endorsed the National Com-
mittee Amendment No. 3, with some
minor modiﬁcations. There were II
resolutions from State or District
Conventions. These included New
York, California, Michigan, New
England, Illinois-Indiana, Washing-
ton-Oregon, Eastern Pennsylvania
and Delaware, Montana, Minnesota
and Colorado. The content of these
II resolutions from the state or dis-
trict conventions may be summarized
briefly in the following way.

In the main, these resolutions
supported the proposition that this
convention aﬂirm the continuation
of the Communist Party, without
foreclosing discussion on name and
form in an atmosphere conducive
to the freest exchange of ideas. This
was true with respect to the resolu-
tions from New England, Minnesota,
California, Washington, New York,
Michigan, Eastern Pennsylvania, and
Illinois. Not all of these resolutions
stressed the same points.

Colorado reported that there were
three trends present in its conven-

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION D 71

tion discussion, giving a vote of those
people who wanted to keep the pres-
ent name and form, those who ad-
vocated a change of name and form,
and those who took the position
that decision should be delayed.
Montana expressed itself as oppos-
ing both change and any continua-
tion of discussion; Oregon took a
similar stand.

None of the resolutions that came
from State or District Conventions
called for or advocated dissolution
of the Party, nor did they advocate
making any changes at this time.

Next, with respect to the approach
of the sub—committee working on
this. Despite differences of opinion
that existed in our committee, and
a clash of opinion that found ex-
pression there, there was give and
take by the members of this com-
mittee, and the committee as a
whole fought in a principled way
to ﬁnd those areas of agreement
that would promote the broadest
unity of our entire membership.
Several members expressed the View
that name and form is no-t a prin-
cipled question but a secondary one,
secondary to the content of our or-
ganization. It was felt that it is, in a
sense, regrettable that this subject
took precedence in much of the dis-
cussion over matters of ideology,
policy and program, since politics
must necessarily precede organiza-
tion. Organization cannot be deter-

mined in a vacuum, nor can it be
settled properly through endless de-
bates which divert from construc-
tive participation in the vital peo-
ple’s movements and activities that
are surging around us.

Many members of the committee
deplored the polarization of views
that arose in some areas, and pointed
to examples throughout the coun-
try which demonstrate the possibil-

-ity of airing conflicting views in

friendly debate, without recrimina-
tions. Some comrades-and for that
matter some areas—expressed them-
selves as believing that the Draft
Constitution provides adequate chan-
nels for the re-opening of discussion
on any question without any further
provision. However, it was the pre-
dominant view that the way in which
the discussion around name and
form has unfolded, and the atmos-
phere surrounding this problem,
was such as to require assurances
to many comrades in our Party that
mere advocacy of change to an as-
sociation should not be indiscrimi-
nately stigmatized. It was felt, too,
that the membership has played a
constructive role in probing and
examining in a new way the many
problems connected with the ques-
tion, and seeking to ﬁnd a solution
that will be a correct one, that such
probing and investigation should be
welcomed by this convention. It
was felt that a variety of views have

1 (.1,

 

72 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

come forward in the course of the
discussion. Few will dispute that
some of them have been liquida-
tionist in character. But many of
them have not been, and it would
be incorrect to lump them together
as one undifferentiated mass.

Finally, it was the view of the
committee that at this time the con-
vention should express itself with
respect to the necessity of strength-
ening, consolidating and building
the Communist Party for the many
tasks that it has in the future.

I will now proceed to read the
unanimous recommendation of the
subcommittee on name and form.

The Sub-committee on Name and
Form recommends unanimously;

(1) That this convention go on
record to alﬁrm the continuation of
the Communist Party of the United
States of America.

(2) That this convention opposes
the transformation of the Party to a
political or educational association.

(3) That, although we oppose
endless debate on this question, it
should not close the door to all con-
structive exploration and discussion
of the subject as may be organized
by the incoming National Commit-
(I66.

(4) That we recognize that some
ideas that have been brought for-
ward in this discussion are revision-
ist in character. However, it would
be wrong to label all proposals for

change in name and form as revi-
sionist per se.

Comrade Chairman, I move the
adoption of the report of the Sub-
committee.

C/z.: The motion has been made
and seconded. There will now be
discussion on the motion. I want to
remind the convention that there is
a ﬁve minute time limit on discus-
sion, which was ordered yesterday.

George Blake C/zarrzey (New York):
Comrade Chairman and Comrades: I
rise to support this amendment, and
to compliment the work of this com-
mittee. As the comrades may know,
I, and many of us who advocated
change in nameand form, supported
this approach in the December meet-
ing of the National Committee. In that
spirit, I co-sponsored with Comrade
Ben Davis a resolution along these
lines in the New York Convention,
for the purpose of unifying the con-
vention and the Party. Comrade Fos-
ter, in his comments on this resolu-
tion yesterday, failed to take note of
the fact that the resolution in eﬁect
took issue with those who would fore-
close discussion following the conven-
tion.

My experience has been, comrades,
that the discussion has been quite un-
even. Even in New York there are
areas where this issue has not been
discussed. At any rate, an unreadiness
on the part of many who favored
change to take action on this question
at this time. We have come to the
conclusion that to press the issue would
make for serious division in our ranks.

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 73

We respect the views of the comrades
who have apprehensions about a P0-
litical Action Association, though we
do not share them, or who argue
that, though the question may be im-
portant, it’s secondary to questions of
program and policy, and with the
great controversy on these issues, this
could not be resolved until we have
decided on our program.

At the same time, comrades, in
voting for this amendment, I want to

make it clear that, while this issue

is resolved at this convention, in af-
ﬁrming the continuation of the Party
as is, which I unreservedly support,
I do not consider that the question is
dead, that it can be legislated out of
existence without jeopardizing the
unity of the Party. Hence, I favor
not only the spirit of the resolution,
but urge adherence to its letter, that
calls for further exploration and dis-
cussion in proper fashion as organized
by the National Committee.

Secondly, comrades, I reject the
charge made from the outset by Com-
rade Foster and others, that this idea
was revisionist or liquidationist, that
it represents an abandonment of prin-
ciple, or that its supporters perhaps
belong to the “rogues gallery” of the
Marxist movement. There can be no
proper discussion in our ranks, no
matter how you underline the right
of dissent, in such an atmosphere. The
right of dissent itself would become
a sham.

I venture to say that, if we were
to take a referendum, and I do not
propose a referendum, approximately
20 per cent of our membership, in New

York at any rate, would support it.
To ride these people out as liquida-
tionists—is this» the way to contribute
to the unity of the Party? Is it a radi-
cal idea? Yes—it may be invalid in
whole or in part. Time, experience,
and our own discussion will resolve
that on its merits. My own conviction
is that, rather than liquidationist, it
would help to break the bonds of our
illegality, would contribute in time-
as I see it, comrades-—to help organize
a broader base for the Marxist move-
ment in our country, and help revitalize
the movement as a whole.

The main issue is not, and has never
been, the question of the Political Ac-
tion Association. The main issue is
the main line of the Draft Resolution.
And those who insist that this issue
of name and form is the main issue
tend to conceal their own stubborn
opposition over all of these months to
the main direction of the resolution.

These things I must say, comrades,
but conclude that, without reservation,
I support this amendment because I
believe it contributes to the unity of
the Party, and would make it possible
for us to go forward. (Applause.)

James Ford (New York): I am not
ready to speak on this now, until some-
thing is clariﬁed for me. I’d like to ask
an explanation of Point 4 in particular.
I want that point explained very carefully.
For example, what is exactly meant when
we say, “It’s wrong to label all proposals
revisionist per se”? I’d like ‘to have that
deﬁnitely explained by the Chairman of the
Committee or somebody els&—ex/actly that
Point 4.

Gh.: Well, I would imagine that the
members of the committee are going to
be participating in the debate, and inas-
much as that question will be in the gen-

eral content of discussion, with Comrade
F ord’s agreement, I would urge that it
be handled within the framework of the
debate and discussion on the motion itself
this morning.

I would now like to ask for those who
are going to speak for and against the
motion, so that the Chair can have some
indication of the line-up.

I will recognize you as you are lined
at the microphone. I would suggest that
you comrades get to a mike. Comrade
Alan Max is first in line.

Alan Max (New York): I grabbed
the mike so fast because I spent three
days unsuccessfully at our State Con-
vention and never got the floor, but
I’d be glad to yield it to some of the
comrades from out of town, if some
of them want to speak, because Com-
rade George Charney has spoken for
New York. I will get it then later.

C/2.: The Chair can’t guarantee
that.

ing in our own ranks, and particularly
in newspaper accounts of what was
going on in the Party, I think from
the very beginning it has been untrue
that there are three main directions
in our Party, each of them symbol-
ized by one of the leaders of the Na-
tional Committee. I think that, far
from there being three, there are thou-
sands of differences of opinion on thou-
sands of questions, but actually there
are two main directions and have been
two main directions, since the very
outset of this discussion, and these
two directions were given to us yes-
terday in the addresses that we heard.

One of these directions, from the
very beginning, has been against the
fundamentals that were put forward
with all their weaknesses, hesitancies,

Max: Contrary to some of the think-

inconsistencies, perhaps, in the Draft
Resolution. And this is in opposition
to the Draft Resolution, although it was
not always treated that way; it was
very often cloaked under a guise of
charging everybody else with revision-
ism, liquidationism, anti-Sovietism,
anti-socialism, plots in the Daily Work-
er and in New York State, and par-
ticularly used the question of name and
form as the worst symbol of everything
that was unmentionable.

And the other direction was the
direction embodied in the Draft Reso-
lution, trying to solve the crisis within
our Party. And in that direction are
included differences of opinion on al-
most every question by almost every
one of us, including on major ques-
tions such as Hungary and so on. But
nevertheless, all of us who share this
general direction have the opportunity
to determine to carry out through dis-
cussion whatever differences there are,
and can do that successfully so long
as we reject the attempts to stop dis-
cussion, attempts to brand ideas, in a
way which is thoroughly unjustiﬁed
and unwarranted.

It seems to me that the two main
directions were very well dramatized
in the contradicting remarks with re-
gard to the fraternal and welcome
message of Jacques Duclos. In one
address, we were urged to accept the
opinions given by Iacques Duclos; in
the other, from Gene Dennis, that we
ﬁrmly but fraternally reject the criti-
cism—the main criticism—-of the Draft
Resolution. And I say, comrades, that
that section of Comrade Gene’s report
is a landmark in the history of our

 

 

SESSIONS OF - THE CONVENTION ‘ 75

Party. Not only did it show the dif-
ference between 1945 and 1957, but it
was the ﬁrst time that anything like
that has happened in the entire history
of our Party.

Finally, I would say that this con-
vention, in my opinion, is going to
reject the opposition, in whatever form,
to the Draft Resolution, and reject what
I consider taking a road to nowhere
and getting there fast. And secondly,
in my opinion, to indicate and drama-
tize, not only before the Party but
before the working class as a whole,
that this is an independent Party, in-
dependent because that is the only way
that we can understand and help play
our part among the American people,
and it is the only way that we will
be able to move the American work-
ing class to a position of real interna-
tional working-class solidarity. And
third, and ﬁnally, what this convention
is going to do, and is doing, is opening
up and legitimizing all serious, honest,
conscientious forms of thought and ex-
ploration on all the questions which
we can only begin to touch on at this
convention, but which all of us unit-
edly, if we have this object in view,
will do in the coming months and
years. (Applause.)

C/2.: May I urge the delegates to
limit their remarks to the subject un-
der debate? I hesitate to interrupt a
speaker at the mike, but please re-
member the subject matter of the de-
bate, and conﬁne your remarks to that
question.

Betty: I rise in favor of the proposal
of the Resolutions Committee because
I feel it most clearly reﬂects the will

of our membership. I think all of us
delegates here have not only welcomed
the constructive proposals of our mem-
bership, but recognize the fact that
our membership added the note of so-
briety to our discussion that saved our
organization.

Our membership wanted to settle the
question of aﬂirming that our Party
continue to exist because our member-
ship wanted to get down to work and
resolve the fundamental questions that
are facing our Party. Our member-
ship felt that, in settling this question,
we then had an opportunity to test what
we are discussing among the masses,
and not in corridors. Our membership
spoke unequivocally also on the fact that
we must not preclude discussion on any
question. No Communist Party can
fulﬁll its role if it puts a period on
any question. We are living in a
changing, dynamic world, and we must,
therefore, guarantee that we will al-
ways, with an open mind, look at all
questions again, and resolve them in
the interests of the cause for which
we stand.

But we Communist delegates here
have to ask ourselves the question:
why did our membership oppose the
Political Action Association?

What the membership sensed and
some of us didn’t sense is that there
are liquidationist ideas in the proposal,
in the very character of the proposal,
and we did not address ourselves to
them. I’d like to list a few of those
that I considered had liquidationist
ideas, whether that was the idea of
the exponent or not. But the mem-
bership sensed it. First of all, I think

 

 

76 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

those who said that we need a change

in name and form because our Party is —

discredited, because of the many er-
rors that it made, had—whether they
liked it or not—an inclination in that
direction, because they accepted the
judgment of the enemy, and the tem-
porary inﬂuence of the enemy among
the mass of the people, without a ﬁght
to re—establish the honor of our Party.

The second idea that I feel is li-
quidationist, is that the only task our
Party has is to build the united so-
cialist movement. I am for a mass party
of socialism, but I'll be darned if
that’s all the task of the Communist
Party! Or that we can ever build a
united socialist movement, if that’s all
we’re going to do! We’re going to
build a mass party of socialism only
when we win the workers for that
cause, and that means identifying our-
selves and working with the people
now on the things they want, and
showing that we understand their as-
pirations and their interests.

The third idea is that the Party has
no distinct role to play. We’ve got an
advanced labor movement, an advanced
Negro people’s movement, an ad-
vanced farmers’ movement, an ad-
vanced everything—what the devil do
we need Communism? And we so
undermined the morale and conﬁdence
of our Party that We did not see that
you cannot realize the strategic aim of
our resolution--for an anti-monopoly
coalition—without the Communist
Party being in and among the workers,
let alone socialism, without the Com-
munist Party being in on it.

There are many more of this char-

acter. The membership sensed it, re-
jected it, and that’s why—in my opin-
ion, comrades—I think it is .wrong
(maybe I shouldn’t use “wrong” and
be a little bit more humble) for com-
rades to say that they withdraw this
proposal, because the membership is
not ready for it. I would rather say,
“Thank God for the membership; they
approve what they wanted, and not
us!” (Applause.)

Helen (Illinois): Comrade Chair-
man, Comrades: I want to read the
action of the Illinois convention. It’s
brief, and I’ll just read it straight
through, so that you can get the sense
of what we did.

“I. This convention goes on record
as opposed to change in name or form,
that we re-afﬁrm that the organization
remain the CPUSA.

“2. This convention is opposed to

the formation of a Communist Politi-

cal or Educational Association to re-
place or to reorganize the Communist
Party.

“'3. We are opposed to endless debate
on this question of name and form.
It is our desire that the National Con-
vention take a clear—cut position on the
matter of form and name, as expressed
in the near unanimous vote on motions
I and 2 at this state convention.

“This does not foreclose future ex-
amination or discussion of the matter
at any level of the Party. We recog-
nize that, based on the constitution,
the proper Party body shall have the
right to consider the matter, just as
they can consider any other matter.”

I want to say that, as I understand
the motion that is before us, it is vague

 

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE. CONVENTION 77

and it leaves the thing open for con-
tinued wrangling, for continued discus-
sion, for continued division and fac-
tionalism. The fact that, in the State
of New York, we have a situation
where I come in from out of town, and
I’m thrown into the middle -of it—-
to the place where people aren't speak-
ing to each other and that sort of
thing—-now we aren’t at that stage in
Chicago, I think because we're more
removed from the problem. That’s my
0p1I110I1.

Now, I think we have to foreclose
this business of endless discussion; that’s
the point that I’m making, and I
think it should come through the
regular channels, so I’m not making a
motion to alter this, but I do hope that
somebody does, so that we get a re-
ferring to the proper bodies, to the con-
stitution, and go through regular pro-
cedures, as our state convention voted.
(Applause.)

George (New Iersey)’: Comrades, I
don't want to get into this big politi-
cal question. I’m a county organizer,
responsible for maintaining the Party
organization, and I want to say that,
for ﬁve years, we maintained our Party
organization. As a matter of fact, in
spite of all the problems that we had,
I think we gained a little bit until
this year. This year I come to this con-
vention with a loss of 20 per cent of
our membership. And the problem, as
I see it, is how are we going to build
and hold what we have.

I’m in favor of the proposals of
the sub-committee because I believe
that these proposals make it most pos-
sible for me to go back to the indus-

trial area where I’m working, to dis-
cuss with my membership this prob-
lem, to take it into the re-convened
county convention, to utilize this resolu-
tion in order to bring back into the
Party those people who are dissatisfied
and have left, and to draw into our
Party some other people on the fringe,
who will see a possibility in this change,
and in this kind of an approach, for
discussing in the Party many of the

_problems that they feel they have not

been allowed to discuss in the past.

This practical approach for me means
that I have a chance to hold our mem-
bership in Mercer County, where I
come from, to draw them into activity,
and in the activity, to ﬁnd out what
mistakes still need to be corrected,
to make whatever changes we need to
make, and to build and consolidate
our Party as it was the intention of
our county convention, and as I am sure
is the intention of this National Con-
vention.

George Morris (New York): Com-
rades, I’d like to support the proposal.
I think it’s a good proposal. I agree
with it. I do not agree with it for any
maneuvering purposes, but because I
really feel that all of its four points
are justiﬁed, and should be supported
on that ground.

I support it, first of all, because it’s
a proposal to maintain Party unity, and
that’s a very important idea, because,
if we don’t have Party unity, and if
we are so weakened as to be confined
to a much smaller organization, and
perhaps a sect, the question of name
and form won’t count very much,
anyway. So the problem is one of pre-

serving the Party, preserving its unity.

I think the proposal also reflects
the overwhelming decision of the com-
rades in all the districts. And I think
it also rejects such proposals as have
been made of revisionist character,
and some have. It categorically rejects
the idea of an association.

Now I think Comrade Foster’s
speech is very disappointing, in rela-
tion to the question of name and form.
He conceded, in his speech, that basi-
cally there was agreement on the issue,
and yet, after conceding that there was
cagreement, conceding even that there
was agreement on the general line of
the Draft Resolution, he proceeded
with a very factional speech, the kind
«of speech that has been feeding some
«of the extreme Right opportunists in
our movement. I think it is this po-
"larization between this extreme on one
side and the extreme on the other side

that has caused this intense factional
-situation we have in our movement,

and which is so appalling to the com-
rades outside of New York, because

"New York has had the worst of this

- disease.

Now I think, comrades, that this mo-

tion before us——-the basic motion be-

fore this convention, I think, despite
what comrades say—I think that that
spells unity. It spells basic agreement
from which we can proceed. And I
think, by voting for this motion, we
at the same time reject very decidedly
this concept of factionalism, that we
place the emphasis on the need for
maximum agreement, maximum unity,
from which we can go forward, and I

‘think that Comrade Dennis, speaking

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

on this question yesterday, gave us the
right tone. And it was all the more
deplorable to listen to the kind of
speech on this question that we had
from Comrade Foster later on, in face
of the basis that was laid for unity
by Comrade Dennis.

So, in conclusion, comrades, I say
that we should give this proposal very
emphatic and I hope unanimous sup-
port here, in order to indicate the will
of the membership, in order to once
and for all put an end to all this ma-
neuvering and speculation that has been
going on on the future of the Party.
( Applause.)

Martha Stone (New ]crsey): Com-
rades, the New Jersey State Conven-
tion of the Party voted overwhelmingly
to accept the national amendment on
the question of name and form. In our
ranks in the Party, this amendment

' was greeted at that time because we

felt that this corresponded to the feel-
ing within our leadership and within
our membership on this question. Many
of us felt we needed more time to ham-
mer out things. In our district, some
of us in the leadership were for change
of name and form. I, for example,
was inclined in relation to change of
name. And we found that sectors of the
Party that were pushing in the direc-
tion of basic changes they felt were
required, nonetheless were not ready
to be stampeded for settlement of this
question. When the national amend-
ment came out, it corresponded to
what the Party desired in our district,
and that is why the comrades were
glad to see that this question was re-
moved as an issue, and that at a subse-

  

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 79

quent time, corresponding to further
solutions of program, we would arrive
at further clariﬁcation.

Now I consider the proposal of this
sub-committee not only a continuation
in that spirit, but I think it adds some-
thing with which I wholeheartedly
agree. It adds a note that differen-
tiates between Party comrades at what-
ever level that may have been search-
ing for new answers in a new way and
were probing and giving serious argu-
ments for change of name and form
as distinct from those who had many
concepts that would have led to the
liquidation of a Communist Party that,
regardless of what its name or form,
has to have a Marxist character, has
to have a character in which it gives
leadership to the day to day struggle,
and is not just some debating society.

I cannot speak on this question with-
out stating what I think to be the facts
in the National Committee of the
Party, and the National Board and I
have been invited to a number of meet-
ings, and attended all of the meetings
of the National Committee where this
question was debated. In neither

v place have I found comrades that were

discussing any question of name and
form ever putting it forth from a re-
visionist standpoint, or from a stand-
point that would make our Party some
little sewing circle or debating so-
ciety. Furthermore, it never was an
issue in the National Committee of
the Party. It never was a major issue
within the National Board of our
Party. There were mixed opinions, just
as we found in the Party as a whole.
And, in fact, when the Draft Resolu-

tion was adopted by the National Com-
mittee, at that time this question was
even left open because nobody felt like
getting in and discussing it. People
did not have their ideas ﬁxed, and they
said, “Let’s take this to the Party,
and let the Party talk about it, and we,
together with the membership of the
Party, will enter into discussion.”

And I think that the characteriza-
tion that the source of revisionism in
respect to this proposal stems from
the National Committee, or the Na-
tional Board——that is not borne out
by the facts. Furthermore, it seems
to me that we have learned one thing
in this discussion, that when we are
making a turn, and that when there
are new questions to be tackled, we
must learn from the past, and from
1945, and the entire thirty years of our
history. We must learn how, when we
make a turn, to see that we do not
swing to the Left or to the Right.
And we must also learn to tolerate
each other’s views.

I end with the point that it seems to
me we must ﬁght for an atmosphere
which permits the cadre of our Party
to discuss this free of label, to discuss

this when there is an organized dis--

cussion in the Party for proper settle-
ment of the issue. (Applause.)

Charles Loman (New York): Com-
rades, as secretary of the committee
on this resolution, I support it, and am
grateful for the opportunity to partici-
pate in this convention, which I be-
lieve will ﬁnally help to unite our
Party, and put an end to this debate,
which has been tearing our Party to
pieces in New York.

Now, I hope the out of town com-
rades will bear with me, because for a
solid year, we have been saturated with
this discussionof Party versus Associa-
tion in the New York State Board, and
those who have been minorities in
their districts understand, as I have
certainly learned and feel, that the right
of dissent will always be fought for
by all members of our Party who rec-
ognize the need to express differences
in points of view. For I have been a
minority of one for a year in our
State Board—basically because I was
for the Party——and the ideas of associa-
tion were wrecking our Party through-
out the state.

Now I gather, comrades, that on the
question of labeling and name-calling,
we all want to discuss things in a
comradely atmosphere. That’s the
only way we are going to resolve dif-
ferences. However, there are certain
propositions which are what they are.
When a patient has smallpox, the dis-

ease is labeled smallpox, not the pa-

tient. Malaria is labeled malaria-
not the patient, but the disease. There
are ideas, as I understand it from
Marxist-Leninist terminology, that have
to be called what they are, and I want
to recite to you a number of ideas
which have frightened the membership
of our Party, and based upon the strug-
gle against these ideas, they rose up
to see that the association was being
pushed and nurtured by certain ideas
which helped to further split the Party,
and would lead us down the path to re-
visionism.

Now, one: Marxism-Leninism in the-
ory and organization helped to bring

PROCEEDINGS or 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

about socalism——true, but only in
backward countries——Russia, China,
Eastern Europe, other colonial countries,
etc. It is not suited to Western capi-
talist countries—England, France, the
U.S.A., etc. That is, Marxism-Lenin-
ism is not a universal science. We
therefore need a new science which
we must develop, we need —a Western
socialism as against an Eastern so-
cialism.

Further: socialism does not really
exist anywhere in the world. We have
been taken in by false pronouncements
from the so-called socialist countries,
and this, of course, coupled with anti-
Soviet attacks, etc., etc. A new feature
of the period today is that Commu-
nists are killing Communists.

A Delegate: Point of Order: It is
my opinion that the last remarks are
completely out of order, as was ruled
by the Chair, as far as the type of
discussion we are to have.

C/2.: The Chair will request the
speaker to limit his remarks solely to
the questions of name and form.

Loman: Well, name and form, com-
rades, are part of this discussion, in
that point four on revisionism. I’m dis-
cussing revisionist ideas, not person-
alities. I have the right to speak on
it. (Applause.)

The Soviet troops in Hungary are
equated to troops of imperialist powers,
dominating oppressed nations, thus ad-
vocating the bourgeois propaganda of
“red imperialism.” Doubts expressed
that an economic crisis is any longer
inevitable, because capitalism has now
learned how to smooth out the econom-
ic cycles. Thus we, after achieving

 

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 81

an anti-monopoly coalition, can reform
gradually into socialism.

Six. I want an association so that
I can stand up in my mass organiza-
tion and truthfully say that I am not
a member of the Communist Party.
Further, the Negro question in the
U.S. today is predominantly‘ and
mainly a moral question. We only have
to persuade our united front force
friends, etc., etc., and we can then
support, etc.- It’s not an economic
question based upon imperialist op-
pression. Negroes come into the Party
with more nationalism than white com-
rades with white chauvinism. There
is no white chauvinism in the Party,
only mild racial prejudices——therefore,
we should drop the word chauvinism.

Labor can eventually take over the
Democratic Party, and transform it
into a people’s party. O-ur Party never
had the opportunity to make a Right
opportunist error, let alone veer to the
Right, etc.

Now, comrades, I could go on with
more. These are ideas which were
leading comrades to drop out of the
Party. These were ideas utilized to
nurture the association—and I’m not
saying that everybody who was for an
association, as the amendment says,
were revisionists, or had these ideas.
But, in our New York organization——
and I’m quoting the thoughts of Party
leaders in New York State, and I can
give names, places and times, but we
don’t want that. (Voices: “Yes, we
want that!” and “No!”)

Now, I want to conclude. And it’s
this that’s the body of revisionism,
and a deviation from Marxism-Lenin-

ism that frightened me, and that the
only thing I knew that the membership
would oppose this and defeat it that en-
abled me to stand in that State Board
and fight for a solid year, comrades-
a solid year, against every kind of op-
pressive maneuver and tactic that
would box us out of the Party. Now
I want to conclude on this-—just two
points in relation to this. Now, I’m
happy that Comrade Blake is joining
in support of this resolution, because
I‘ helped to draft it, along with the
other comrades. And on that, we can
unite around the Party. But there are
other political questions which still
have to be resolved, around which
there is not unity, but which can be
resolved within the framework of the
Party, and when this convention helps
to resolve that, that will be the basis
around organized channels of discus-
sion.

Ch.: I want to call the attention of the
convention to a problem which this con-
vention jointly faces. Yesterday, we voted
to allot one hour to this discussion. The
hour is now up. Comrade John Gates has
asked for the ﬂoor; Comrade Bernie
from the subcommittee on this question
has asked for the ﬂoor; Comrade Ben
Davis has asked for the floor——— (Voice:
And I’m asking for the ﬂoor) —and you
can see the line-up at the mikes of com-
rades who have also asked to speak. It
is obvio-us that, in order to carry through
the activity of this convention, and the
time allotment on it, the Chair will have
to be guided by a motion from the ﬂoor
on the question of the further procedure.

Monris (New York): Point of Per-
sonnal Privilege: The last speaker

stated that, for the past year, he was a
minority of one in the discussion in the
New York State Board on the question of
the political association. As a matter of
fact, I am a member of the New York

 

82 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

State Board; Comrade Si Gerson is a mem
ber of the New York State Board, and
nelther Comrade Si nor I voted for the
establishment of a political association. We
both voted against it.

‘The point is that Comrade Charles, in
his remarks, stated that the entire New
York State Board voted one way.

Ch.: All right, comrade, your point has
been made.

A Delegate: On procedure: I’d like to
move that we allow Comrade Gates his ﬁve
minutes, and close the discussion.

[After considerable procedural debate,
the motion was carried with the amend-
ment of one additional speaker against the
report.I

]o/m Gates: Comrades, I wish to sup-
port the motion of the committee. In
saying this, I wish also to state that
I continue to advocate my views. In
fact, everything including the discussion
at this convention has convinced me
all the more that the transformation
of our Party into a political action
association is necessary and desirable

in the best interests of our Party. But‘

I support this motion because I con-
sider it necessary to subordinate my
views to the need for unity in our
Party. The need for unity arises because
there are some comrades in our Party
who favor the continuation of our
Party in its present name and form
and there are other comrades who op-
pose it. And we are trying to unite
those comrades who both
and oppose these ideas.
What is the essence of this motion?
In my opinion it has been one of the
most harmful things in our Party dis-
cussion of the past year and the dis-
cussion within this convention that we
have divided our Party into comrades
who are for the Party and comrades
who are against the Party. I believe

advocate‘

that all of us are for the Party. I be-
lieve that it is arrogant and conceited
on the part of some comrades to set
themselves up as the self-appointed sa-
viors of the Party and that they are
to be considered Party patriots, while
others who oppose their views are to be
considered enemies of the Party.

All of us want to save the Party.
Some of us have different points of view
as to the best way to save our Party.
Let me remind you comrades that after
we dispose of this the chief problem
that concerns our Party will remain
the chief problem——and that is the iso-
lation of our Party which has been
the main issue in this discussion.

We will still be isolated when this
convention is over no matter what we
do on this question. It remains to be
seen what we will do after the con-
vention to overcome our isolation. We
saved our Party in 1945 when we re-
constituted our Party and some com-
rades thought that’s all that had to be
done.

But we reconstituted our Party in
1945, and look where we are now!
So it is not so simple, comrades, that
all you have to do is retain the name
and form of the Communist Party, and
that solves all of our problems.

It is my view, which is shared by
many comrades in the Party, that life
and reality will determine this ques-
tion. I believe we will come to see, as
time goes on, that it will be necessary
to make changes in the name and in
the structure——the form—of our Party.
And I think it ﬂows out of the policies
We will adopt at this convention, the
policies I am conﬁdent we will adopt.

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION i 83

I have never been one who has said
that this question is the main question
before the Party. I have always said
that we should subordinate‘ it to policy.
And I still believe that. But it is just
from this point of view that I wrote
about and advocated a change in the
name and form of the Party. In my
article which you read in the Novem-
ber issue of Political A ﬁairs, the over-
whelming bulk of that article is de-
voted to the policy and program of our
Party, and only a small part of it was
on the question of change in name and
form, which in my opinion was a logi-
cal continuation of what I thought
were correct policies for our Party.

I think, in connection with what is
the main aim of our Party in the com-
ing historical period—-helping to build
an anti-monopoly coalition in our
country—given the level of develop-
ment of the labor movement in our
country and the people’s movement
and the necessity to bring about a
political realignment along these lines,
we have to consider the existence of
our Party as to how best to function,
how best to assist this new political
realignment. _It is my opinion that this
can best be done by a change of name
and form.

Now, to conclude, it is all right to
say, as many comrades have said, that
discussion on this issue will not be fore-
closed. Comrades, given the under-
standing of some of the comrades who
present this question here at this con-
vention, it would be a brave soul indeed
who would dare to discuss this question
after the convention. If one is to be
branded a revisionist, a liquidationist,

and all of the names under the sun
because you advocate these things, how
can we have a proper discussion in the
Party on this question? It is just be-
cause of this kind of atmosphere that
we have not had a proper discussion
up until now on this question! (Ap-
plause.)

C/1.: We now have one comrade
speaking against the motion.

Bill S. (New York): I think the
question of liquidation has been an-
swered by the previous speaker. He
deplores the fact that there hasn’t been
sufficient discussion. Yet there was a
majority in the State Board who had
adequate time to hand down litera-
ture to the county, to the districts,
and what have you, for us to have a
discussion on it. We didn’t have a
discussion on it out in the streets,
and we could have no discussion be-
cause, if we upheld it, we couldn’t even
have meetings—we couldn’t even have
meetings. And the reason that we had
meetings is because we walked the
streets and got the people together.
Because we weren’t getting any direc-
tion. That’s why we’re here. I’ve never
been to a National Convention before

as a delegate in my life, and it’s only ‘

because the rank and ﬁle sent me
here. (Applause.)

We have Communist Parties all over
the world that call themselves some-
thing else, but that form is the main
thing, and when you start to fooling
with the form, then you fool with the
content. You just can’t have one type
of building and form it into the form
of another. It’s basic.

And I am independent—sure, I’m in-

 
 
 
   
   
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  

dependentl I’m just as independent
as other Negro people, who have been
stepped on, from the physician to the
lowest worker, because when he’s
stepped on, he’s coming right down
with me. And all other workers. I
don’t consider any worker, because he’s
got a higher job than I, any less than I.
I’m for the amendment that says-
that we have a Party.

Now, comrades from out of the state,
the Party isn’t my responsibility, or the
State’s responsibility. It’s your respon-
sibility. And if you don’t Want a
change in name or form, you have a
right to say so. I don’t think New
York State has any right to say any-
thing about it. I’m from the South,
too, and I’m ﬁghting for my people
down there, as well as for anybody up
here. I hold that to be true. And not
only that, but people all over the world,
because it don’t have any boundaries"
and is not independent, even if we
profess to be.

I am against the question of continu-
ing debate on the question of name and
form. (Applause.)

Archie (California): I offer an amend-
ment to the first point to include the
words: “Our chief task is to rebuild and
strengthen the Communist Party.”

Oleta Yates: Unless some member of
the committee takes issue with this, I
would say that, based on the discussion
in the committee last night, Archie’s
amendment to include the statement for
building, consolidation and strengthening
the Party would be quite in line with the
general spirit of the committee discus-
sion.

Parliamentarian: On that basis, the
amendment is obviously in order under
the rules.

Archie: Point of order. Are you allow-
ing all amendments to come in now? Is

84 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

that right? And then you are going to
take up the questio-n of whether to close
debate or not?

Parliamentarian: First there’s a general
principle that’s involved here. The high-
est authority in the Communist Party of
the United States is the National Con-
vention, and it’s assembled here.

Secondly, within that highest authority,
the highest authority is the general meet-
ing of the delegates. That’s now assembled
here. Whatever you decide goes, includ-
ing the living up to the rules you your-
selves have adopted. And one rule, known
as Rule No. 8, which you can all look up,
has a lot of complexities to it that’s based
on trying to combine the democratic con-
cept that this convention is the highest
authority ruling itself with the fact that
you are trying to expedite business and
prevent a ﬂood of various business being
done on the convention ﬂoor, rather than
being presented through the committees
that you have elected.

You have already interpreted Rule 8
by one decision here, and that interpreta-
tion, carried by a majority vote in the con-
vention, i-s that you are not allowing a
substitution of the committee report to
be made from the floor of the convention.
And that’s why, in connection with your
amendment, I tried to put it within that
conﬁne to determine whether it was a
substitute or consistent with the main mo-
tion before the body, and that will be my
ruling from here on out until this con-
vention in its wisdom decides to overrule
me, which they have a right to do, in-
cluding removing me, which I would
greatly appreciate. (Laughter.)

Burt Nelson (Washington): I rise in
behalf of the Washington delegation, in
full support of the committee’s recom-
mendation, to offer an amendment of im-
plementation. The amendment is that
there be no future action on the question
of name or form, except at a convention
of our Party. This is action—not talk, dis-
cussion.

Ch.: I will ask the Chairman of the
Sub-committee, in terms of the Sub-com-
mittee’s own discussion on point 4~——onJy
the convention could rule on this question,
anyway. The amendment is not necessary.
No other body of the Party could rule on
this but at a convention, Burt.

Paul (New York): I rise to amend one

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 85

word. In place of the word, “oppose"
change of name and form, insert the
word “reject.” .

Ch.: The committee does not accept
the change, and therefore, under the pre-
vious ruling, it would have to go to the
subcommittee first for debate.

A Delegate: On the third point, I would
propose the deletion of the first phrase
“although we are opposed to endless de-
bate,” and have it read that “we will not
close the door on discussion in any body
of our Party.” (Applause.)

The same ruling, comrade. I would
suggest that we ﬁrst vote on the report
of the committee. Comrades who have ad-
ditional changes to submit them to the
committee.

Celeste (California): Comrade Chair-
man, I would like to add three words to
Comrade Archie’s amendment. I have in-
formed him of the thing I wish to add,
and the Chair can ask him if he will accept
this into his amendment. I would like to
add to his formulation, which was “our
task is to rebuild and strengthen the
Communist Party,” the following words:
“and to overcome its isolation.” (Ap-
plause.)

Ch.: The chairman of the sub-com-
mittee states that this would also be con-
sidered within the discussion of that sub-
committee, and will accept it as a portion
of the ﬁrst amendment.

Comrades, may I call to your attention
just one point, and that is in regard to
the exact language of each resolution that
is going to be appearing before us, and
I think we have all experienced this in our
own conventions at home—all of us could
probably ﬁnd diﬂerent words we would like
to insert, but let me urge that we restrain
our literary talents, and in some cases,
political reactions on some of these ques-
tions, in favor of the general political
direction that a resolution goes, so that
we can proceed to the other resolutions.

We will now proceed to vote, com-
rades, on the committee’s report. First:
the motion has been made here to close
debate. [Carried.] Secondly, on the mo-
tion that was just asked, to vote on the
committee’-s proposals as a body. That is
the motion that was made by the chairman
of the subcommittee in the report to us.
_ [Cpntinued lengthy procedural discus-
sion.

Ch.: First, on the amendment of chang-

ing the word “oppose” ‘to “reject.”

[Further procedural discussion] _

Yates: The point in question is _point 2
of the report of the sub-committee. I
would add here that this sub _
which did reﬂect the most widely d"°"'
gent views, agreed on point 2 word for
word, and it is as follows: [reads point
2

Ch.: All in favor of the word “reject”
signify by raising your cards. [Vote
taken.] The Chair rules that the amend-
ment has lost. We will now proceed to
vote on the sub-committee’s motion. [Vote
taken.l Opposed: 3. Abstentions: 17.

AFTERNOON SESSION

February 10, 1957
Pat (New Iersey) in the Chair.

[Additional greetings are read, in-
cluding greetings from Colombia,
Great Britain and Korea.]

Chairman: The Chair calls on Sid
Stein, for the Resolutions Commit-
tee.

Sid Stein: Comrade Chairman,
Comrades: I have been asked to in-
troduce the work of the Resolutions
Committee, and to make some re-
marks in explanation of the process
that this
through and how it came to be What
it is today. What it will be tomor-
row, that you will decide.

The original Draft Resolution, is-
sued by the National Committee on
September 15th, was the product of
the collective efforts of the Party,
and not the work of some individ-
uals. It was based on the discussion
in the Party, and by the Party mem-

Draft Resolution went .

-committee, ‘

bership, especially on the discussion
that took place between April and
September.

The resolution that went before
the sub—comrnittee last night was al-
ready amended on a number of ques-
tions. It had a new economic sec-
tion. It had a post-election political
analysis. It had an up—to-date dis-
cussion of the international situa-
tion. It had a new section on the
struggle for Negro rights and Negro-
white unity. It had a new section
on trade union work. It had a sec-
tion on social democracy, and three
amendments on the Party. These
are extensive changes indeed.

What do these changes signify?
In our opinion, they signify that
our Party has already changed, that

there is something new in this Party ’

of ours, that we are having a truly
democratic discussion, that we have
no longer a one—way street, where
the leadership issues documents, and
they do not get the full treatment
by the membership of the Party, that
we have now a two-way street, in
which the ideas are ﬂowing both

ways. The membership has regis-

tered its views before the conven-
tion; it will do so through the dele-
gations in the convention, and we all
hope that this will become a normal
way of life for our Party.

" My task here is facilitated by the
discussion this morning, and by the
overwhelming vote on the name and
form proposition. Because, to me-

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

and I believe to a majority of the
Resolutions Committee that worked
on this resolution up to the conven-
tion, and to the majority of the Na-
tional Committee, it is quite impor-
tant that We settle a couple of ques-
tions, one of them being our ap-
proach to the resolution. There are
varying estimates of the resolution
and of the discussion, and comrades,
it depends on where you start from,
what your estimate is as to how you
approach it. If one starts from the
proposition that what we have here
before us is the product of some kind
of an unholy alliance between li-
quidationists, revisionists and con-
ciliators who make up the majority
of this National Committee, as
against a minority of Marxist-Lenin-
ists, then we have one approach to the
resolution, we have one approach
to Party unity, we have one ap-
proach to every question that comes
before us. If we take up the posi-
tion that this resolution repre-
sented, as some comrades said earlier
in the discussions, conciliation with
the Left, and that the resolution
doesn’t go anywhere, then again we
take a certain point of view—a cer-
tain point of departure. This Na-
tional Committee and the Resolu-
tions Committee, on the basis of the
policy discussions, have fought these
past eight months for a line of ac-
tion which, in our opinion, neither
conciliates the Left nor conciliates
the Right, but is trying to establish

 

 

s

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION — 37

a basis to make it possible for our
Party to rebuild itself, to re-establish
its past connections with the people
of our country, with the Working
class and with the Negro people.

What has been the View of the
majority of the National Commit-
tee? In the very ﬁrst draft, we
stated, in the process of carrying out
the main task, which is the struggle
against left-sectarianism, the Party
must “continue to maintain its vigi-
lance against right—opportunist ten-
dencies, combatting them at all
times. This is especially necessary
in view of the extremely sharp turn
which the Party is now making in
many of its basic policies. The neces-
sary struggle against right-opportu-
nist errors must be carried on in
such a way as not to weaken the
main task.”

I submit, comrades, that the vote
this morning indicated that the over-
whelming majority of the delegates
to this convention, like the majority
of the Party, wants this kind of an
approach. What did the National
Committee try to do? Let us ask this
question-——in what way were the Na—
tional Committee and the Resolu-
tions Committee conciliatory to the
so—called Right? Precisely in the
same way that this convention was
conciliatory this morning. It refused
to drive these comrades out of the
Party. It refused to label them re-
visionists. It said, “We disagree
with some of their propositions, but

these comrades have a right to argue
for those propositions.” The Nation.-
al Committee, in its majority, and
the Resolutions Committee, in its
majority, have seen these drafts as
something to be debated, amended
and improved by all Party com-
rades, those who Want an associa-
tion and those ‘who didn’t want an
association. Not just by some-by
the whole Party. This National
Committee was always opposed, in
its overwhelming majority, to chang-
ing the Party into an association,
but it insisted that to brand those
comrades who Wanted one or an-
other change as liquidationists was
wrong and harmful. And the con-
vention this morning said as much.
This National Committee also in-
sisted that it is possible to liquidate
the Party even if you don’t change
its name and form. And that much
of it was done in the past ten years.
The majority of this National Com-
mittee and Resolutions Committee
insisted that our Party must base it-
self on Marxism—Leninism, but it

insisted likewise, as the membership '

is insisting, that the use value of
Marxism—Leninism is not enhanced
but destroyed and undermined by
our past approaches to it———approaches
by the leadership, in the first place
—of dogmatically latching on to
catch phrases which turned our ar-
dor for socialism into adoration of
clichés.

The majority of this National

 

 

 

88 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

Committee and the Resolutions Com-
mittee were also in full agreement
with the Party membership and
learned much from the Party mem-
bership in our insistence that this
draft resolution make clear our ﬁght
for international working-class soli-
darity, at the same time making
it clear that we must break with
our uncritical acceptance and dog-
matic application of positions pro-
mulgated by Marxists in other lands,
which very often—-not because they
did wrong, but because we did wrong
in accepting it in that manner-
turns our science, that has the power
to help the working class liberate
humanity, into a religious tract that
imprisons the very Party of the
working class, and that builds a

wall between us and our mother,‘

the working class, and our brothers,
the Negro people, and our natural
allies.

I believe there is no growing gap
in our Party. I believe the gap is
being closed because we are facing
up to the issues in thisconvention.
And I believe the gap between the
Party of the past and the leadership
of the future—the new leadership
—is going to be closed, by this two-
way street. We will have Party
unity. We will have it because our
unity will be built upon a mass policy
that unites us with our class. There
can be no effective Party unity on
its own and by itself, away from the
working class. Party unity is mean-

ingful, Party unity is solid and last-

ing if it is not just unity of the
Party, but it is unity of the Party
with our class and our natural al-
lies.

In closing, comrades, may I sug-
gest that the resolution, together
with the discussion, and the amend-
ments, will—by the will of this con-
vention and by your actions—make
possible the unity of our Party, and
unity between our Party and our
class, and will make possible for our
Party to give concrete and meaning-
ful expression to one of our most
cherished principles, the principle of
international working class solidarity.

Clz.: The Chair calls on Hy Lu-
met to report for the Resolutions
Sub-committee No. 1.

Hy Lumcr (Ohio): Comrade
Chairman, Comrades: Our sub—com—
mittee is responsible for three sec-
tions of the draft resolution. Num-
ber one, the section dealing with the
economic situation, economic ques-
tions; Number two, the ﬁght for
peaceful coexistence; three, the sec-
tion which, in the present draft, is
Part 2, “The Path Ahead.” We pro-
pose to present these three sections
individually, with opening remarks
on each section by a member of the
committee, and discussion on one sec-
tion at a time, rather than a com-
bined discussion on all of them.

I am to report on the economic
section.

Well, there has- been much dis-

 

 

SESSIONS 01-‘ THE CONVENTION 89

agreement among us on a host of
questions. On one point, there has
seemed to be virtual unanimity, and
that is, on the inadequacy of the
original economic section that ap-
pears in the printed draft resolu-
tion. Because of this, the pre-Con-
vention Resolutions Committee un-
dertook to re-write the section rather
than to attempt to amend the origi-
nal. The re-written section has
been given to all delegates in their
kits, and I hope by now the dele-
gates have had a chance to read
it. I can gather from the reaction
that some haven’t.

What the section attempts to do as
it stands is as follows: One, to pre-
sent a brief general evaluation of
the postwar American economy,
with a characterization of the na-
ture of the postwar boom period;
second, on the basis of this, a reit-
eration of the basic Marxist economic
principles by which we have been
governed, and a re-statement of the
fact that these are not invalidated
by the developments of this period.
We felt that this was necessary be-
cause this has become a major point
in the discussion. Third, a presen-
tation brieﬂy of the nature of our
economic errors and estimates, and
of the roots of these errors. Fourth,
a presentation in outline form of the
new features of the American econ-
omy in the present period, and some
speciﬁc features of it, whose study
we have tended to neglect, and

whose study is a key to the correc-
tion of errors and the improvement
of our work in this ﬁeld, and call-
ing for the establishment of a com-
mission by the incoming National
Committee to carry out such studies.
Finally, the rewritten section presents
some elements of an immediate eco-
nomic program.

We have not attempted in this
draft any analysis of the immediate
economic situation; we have made
no attempt to go into the question
of economic perspectives. A number
of resolutions and individual com-
rades felt that the resolution should
do so. However, it was omitted
for the following reasons. While we
believe that such an analysis is
necessary, we felt that it would be
wrong to attempt any kind of a
brief, sketchy statement of a few
paragraphs of a superﬁcial charac-
ter; we felt that it would be wrong
to attempt it, also, on the basis of a
hasty look at things, that to do so
would be merely to repeat some of

the mistakes of the past. We feel-

that this needs to be done, and that
this should be one of the major tasks
of such a commission as is proposed.

We received so-me resolutions

which stated that an analysis of eco-
nomic perspectives was necessary in
order for us to be able to draw any
conclusions as to our work for the
future in all phases, and one stat-
ing in effect that we could not really
have a draft resolution or any kind

 

    
 

9°

of resolution‘ unless we were able to
do this. We feel that this is unwar-
ranted, and that such a View should
be rejected. This was the only ma—
jor question raised in resolutions
from districts and district conven-
tions on this section. Others called
for minor changes of one sort or an-
other, most of which had already
been incorporated in the rewriting.
In the discussion in the committee,
only additional changes were made
for minor revisions, and the general
line of the resolution was accepted.

Clz.: The committee moves the
adoption of its report; it is seconded.
Any discussion upon this? Is the
question called? [Vote taken.] The
report of the committee is adopted.

The Chair calls on Comrade Lil

Gates for the second section of this ‘I

sub-committee’s report.

Lil Gates (New York): Comrades,
the committee felt that this is an
extremely key section of our draft
resolution. In fact, it might well
be called the foundation of our draft
resolution, vital because it establishes
a perspective for the whole period
ahead of the kind of world we live
in, the direction in which that world
and our country are moving, the
possibilities that are open in this
period—all of which are fundamen-
tal to any policy or any other aspects
of the work of our Party.

There Was a great deal of interest
shown in the various state conven-
tions, as we could gather from some

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

of the resolutions submitted, on
the theme of this section, which is
—peaceful coexistence and the esti-
mate of the international situation.
Many of these resolutions indicated
general agreement with the over-all
perspectives, while also indicating
some questions which needed to be
brought up to date, and other ques-
tions which needed clariﬁcation.
There are also certain speciﬁc pro-
posals which I’ll refer to a little bit
later in the course of this report.
The committee felt that the key
aspect of this section was to estab-
lish the validity of the outlook of
ﬁghting for peaceful coexistence,
bringing that perspective up to date
in line with recent developments.
We felt that we should hew pretty
closely to establishing clarity on this
question, and that whatever changes
are recommended should avoid any
pitfalls of beclouding or glossing
over or weakening this central im-
petus. The majority of the commit-
tee felt that this was extremely im-
portant because the root of our er-
rors in the past was particularly the
failure to see what was new and
arising in the world, the new rela-
tionship of forces which had its basis
in the defeat of fascism in World
War II, the further strengthening
of the Soviet Union, the establish-
ment of socialism in China, the
growth of a system of socialist states,
the new level of the colonial lib-
eration movement, and the rise of the

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 91

peace forces throughout the world,
and especially noteworthy, the
growth of peace sentiments and the
peace aspirations of the American
people.

We recognized that it was neces-
sary to clear up legitimate questions
which had arisen in the course of the
discussion which would make clear
that we do not believe that the era
of peaceful coexistence has arrived,
and been achieved, but that it must
be struggled for, that what we have
is a new period opening in the his-
tory of mankind which requires
struggle to guarantee and to achieve.
And if we are armed with this two-
fold approach, then we will not be
caught by surprise; but neither will
we equivocate in seeing what is new
in this world situation; we will not
be without a rudder; we will be able
to project, in the most powerful and
positive way, the ﬁght for peaceful
coexistence, and in this way, over-
come a basic weakness in the past
policy and outlook of our Party,
which was one—sided, and did not see
the dialectical development of these
new forces on a world scene.

Therefore, the Resolutions Com-
mittee had before it some very im-
portant amendments, which had been
prepared, and which we accepted,
which we felt would clarify ques-
tions which had arisen, and would
clarify these questions in a way
which would not weaken, but would
strengthen, the ﬁght for peaceful co-

existence. It would answer the ques-
tions that some comrades have
raised, that in view of the Hungarian
events and the Egyptian events, that
the concept of peaceful coexistence
is not a legitimate one. It would an-
swer the questions of some who said
that there were views that consid-
ered that peaceful coexistence was
already an established fact, and it
did not have to be fought for. We
feel that these amendments are a
very important contribution to the
peace question, and therefore we of-
fer them in answer to many other
points which were made in some of
the statements.

Secondly, we had a number of
questions raised about the struggle
against United States imperialism,
and here, too, we feel that the en-
tire draft resolution was a concrete
American form, and the best direc-
tion and guidance that could give
us a correct policy precisely in the
struggle against United States im-
perialism. We also feel, however,
that it was necessary to bring the
resolution up to date, to take into
account the fact that the Eisenhower
administration and certain sectors of
U.S. imperialism have attempted to
project policies and programs which
heighten the war danger and increase
tension. I think you will find this
aspect of the question dealt with in
this amendment.

But we rejected ideas which
would once again so hedge in our

 

* 9 ~’—=;~;_::v‘®‘-' '~é.:=:.T3<?fL;.-.’ .'_-.

 

    

92

position with qualiﬁcations that we
would be left with uncertainty as to
what we believed to be new and
possible in this period ahead, and
would lead us back into the type of
errors which we made which were
so fatal to all aspects of our mass
work.

Another question which was raised
in the committee was the question
of a plan of work around concrete
aspects of peace activity and speciﬁc
slogans, and so forth. We thought
that this was a valid question, but
we did not propose to handle it
within the framework of this section
of the resolution. We understand
that the committee on plan of work
will bring in concrete proposals on

various aspects of the struggle for _

peace and speciﬁc slogans.

Now we had one particularly difﬁ—
cult question which arose in our com-
mittee, and that had to do with the
developments in Hungary. It was
the opinion of our committee that
this was not within the purview of
this particular committee. Our job
was to deal with the estimate of the
relationship of forces on a world
scale, and to answer whether or not
the concept of peaceful coexistence
is a valid and guiding one for us
in the period ahead. Of course, as
you will see, the resolution says that
neither the developments in the Mid-
East nor the developments in Hun-
gary undermine the validity of that
concept, but it was only in this con-

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

nection that these developments were
discussed. There were some contro-
versial sentences—at least one——in the
amendment which you have, which
I hope you will take out, on the in-
ternational situation around Hun-
gary, and we proposed, after con-
sultation with the Presiding Com-
mittee, that this sentence be referred
to the general Resolutions Commit-
tee, which will discuss how to deal
with the question of Hungary, and
that we do not entertain discussion
on that issue under this particular
int.

Finally, I would also like to say,
before I read the speciﬁc amend-
ments, there were some differences
among the committee which we
could not fully resolve around some
questions of formulation in the draft
resolution. I think Comrade Will
will speak for himself on this. But
it was the opinion of the committee
that, in dealing with the question of
Geneva, the draft resolution simply
discussed what had transpired there,
and we felt that the amendment
which I am going to read to you in
concluding this report took care of
any questions as to how the devel-
opments in the last few months re-
lated to our estimate of Geneva and
the ﬁght for peaceful coexistence.

And we have one other very im- ,

portant amendment which I’ll refer
to at the conclusion of this amend-
ment, and that was to add a section
on the responsibility of the American

people in general, and the Ameri- amending the resolution on that point.

can Communists in particular, to
strengthen the ﬁght against U.S. im-
perialist domination of South Amer-
ica and the people of Puerto Rico,
and while we don’t feel that the sec-
tion we have drafted is as yet ade-
quate, due to lack of time, we do
want to propose that this section be
expanded in the ﬁnal and edited por-
tion in the draft resolution.

And therefore, with this intro-
duction, I will move the adoption
of this section of the Resolution with
the three amendments that you have
before you. I will say, comrades,
I cannot help expressing a personal
note here, that I hardly know—I
can think of few questions more im-
portant for this convention than to
come out of it with a clear and clar-
ion call that yes, we, the Commu-
nists of America, believe in, will
ﬁght for, and help to bring about this
era of peaceful coexistence and the
prevention of another world war,
which is possible.

Will Weinstone (New York): I think
Comrade Gates has given you a good
representation of the proceedings of
our committee. We were in agreement
on most of the questions. But on two
questions there were some differences,
as I think the convention ought to
know. They are not unimportant ques-
tions. One deals with a formulation,
but it is not a question of Wording,
and the second deals with the question
of imperialism and the necessity of

First, with respect to imperialism. We

felt, and Comrades Gates has indicated

it, that it is necessary to put in a sec-
tion in this part of the resolution on
the necessity of exposing the reaction-
ary role of American imperialism. I
introduced that in the committee on
behalf of the New York resolution. The
proposal was made in the committee
but I did not propose at midnight
to try to formulate it. But I would
like to propose to the convention that
we get in a good, substantial para-
graph or two exposing the reactionary
role of American imperialism on a
world scale in the interests of the
struggle for peaceful coexistence.
Comrade Gates did say she feared
that, unless we get in a proper kind
of statement, it might unbalance it,
and create the impression that we are
in the pre-Geneva days, and I can well
understand her caution on this point.
But we can get in a proper statement,
which is not the kind that we did in
1948, when we devoted ourselves quite
correctly to an exposure of the role
of American imperialism. But, you
can’t ﬁght for peaceful coexistence if

you do not know the enemy. It is not.

enough for us to point out the new;
that is absolutely essential. It is also
necessary to know that, if you want to
impose peaceful coexistence upon
American imperialism, then you can
do it only if you know the trend and
direction that American imperialism
1S moving in.

The second point, and a matter of
formulation, deals with p. 18 of the
draft resolution. A motion was made
in the committee, and unfortunately

94’ PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

lost by a vote of, I think, eight to
six, to strike out in the paragraph be-
ginning “The growing crisis” the last
words, that the “Eisenhower adminis-
tration at Geneva formally renounced
the use of force to resolve differences.”

I stated in the committee, that the
formulation that the Eisenhower ad-
ministration had renounced the use of
force to resolve differences created il-
lusions in the Party. By the action of
the resolutions committee in opposing
striking out that at Geneva, they for-
mally renounced the use of force to
resolve differences, and if we leave it
stand, it means, on page 18, they for-
mally renounce, and on page 19, the
Eisenhower doctrine is in force.

Now, what is the Eisenhower doc-
trine? It is the threat of using force
in the Middle East. On one page, they

renounce, and on the other page, they

threaten to use force.

Now, what is the question at issue?
It is that there were illusions. Now it
is true that the Eisenhower administra-
tion at Geneva did state that they did
not intend to use force in order to re-
solve differences-that is true, and the
world “formal” means that they for-
mally did it, but did they actually do
it? Did we believe, and did we not
create the impression by the use of this
term “formally,” that the Eisenhower
administration had given up its policy,
representing a threat to the peace? In
my opinion, by introducing what was a
diplomatic term, we tended to play
down the danger of war represented
by American imperialism and the ad-
ministration.

Now, the statement made at Gen-

eva was not without meaning. Even
though it was a diplomatic statement,
it of course had some effect upon the
world, under the pressure of world
opinion. It had the effect of lessening
tension. And it should have been used,
and was used, by the Party in the
situation. But I think that by omitting
the fact that not only did the admin-
istration continue the cold war, but
continued also the policy of huge arma-
ments and projects, we tended there-
fore, not to be prepared for the develop-
ments that took place. And I think
we must recognize it, and not con-
tinue that, by a formulation in this
resolution which may still tend to
confuse the situation.

I want to say, in conclusion, that it
is a mistake for anyone to believe
that, because the cold war is being
heated up by reaction in the United
States, therefore we are back to pre-
Geneva, period. I think there are such
tendencies in the ranks of our Party,
that do not see the main direction and
trend of events, but I think, that while
we must stress the possibility for co-
existence and the draft resolution does
it and the amendments do it, we must
put the situation clearly before the
Party, and that is, if we want to get
peaceful coexistence, we must not only
recognize the new situation that exists
and utilize it, we must recognize that
only the'people’s struggles, and a mass
struggle, against American imperial-
ism and American monopoly will
achieve it. And we must eliminate
therefore any formulations——even be it
only a few words, that might tend to
blur this important conception and

task that is before our Party. (Ap-
plause.)

C/1.: Any comrade speaking should
be prepared to close his remarks in
ﬁve minutes.

Morris (Illinois): Comrades, I think
that, while we must recognize that
there is an increase in world tension
between the imperialist states and the
oppressed peoples, or the people who
recently gained independence, and the
socialist states, nevertheless the idea
of the striving for peaceful coexistence
is still valid. Not only is it valid, but
we, who claim to be Marxists and
Leninists, should understand that the
idea of peaceful coexistence was not
something that came into being only in
recent years. This has been a policy
for which the ﬁrst workers’ republic
strove for from its very inception, in
order to achieve an understanding
with the rest of the world for peace.
You will understand that, at the be-

ginning, there was only one workers’ A

state, and it could not hope, after the
revolutionary struggle was defeated in
other countries, to remain in being
without the idea of a long struggle,
which took into consideration the idea
of peaceful coexistence with other social
systems. I say this because we have to
answer the imperialists. They say that
Communism is out to conquer the
world, that it is responsible for the war
tensions and so on, while the reverse
is true. And it isn’t merely a change
of tactics on the part of the socialist
states.

We have to become more involved
in the struggle for peace. There is a
big debate raging on foreign policy

in the United States. And some that
should be our allies are lining up on
the other side. You know that the lib-
eral forces, so-called, represented by
the people on the New Republic, the
people around the magazine The Re-
porter, in the universities and intellec-
tual circles, are trying at the present
time to condemn the policy of non-in-
volvement, let’s say, as a policy of ap-
peasement. They are talking about our
poor allies, the way they’ve been de-
serted by the State Department. And
they attack the Eisenhower adminis-
tration for the only thing which they
should not attack it for.

Where were we in this debate?
Where were we when this Professor
Morganthau came forward with a so-
called liberal peace policy and The Re-
porter talked about “peace-mnongep
ing”? And they are continuing this
debate, and we are not involved in it.

And there’s another problem. There’s
the problem of the labor movement.
While it is easy to say, in general,
that the labor movement was on the
side of the State Department, but it’s
not so completely. The labor move-
ment had some struggles with the

State Department. Take the question '

of colonialism. Yes, the Meanys and
others may support the State Depart-
ment, but you read about the struggle
where labor wanted to send observers
to Algeria and Tunisia, and the French
government did not permit these ob-
servers in there. So, therefore, we have
to reach labor. No matter how it
raises its slogan in its concrete form,
the fact is that when the labor move-
ment at the beginning of the year out-

96 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

lined its program, one of the first de-
mands was peace. We have to con-
cretize this.

Finally, take this present situation
in the Mid-East, and the ﬁght against
the Ike doctrine, of intervention. Con-
gress is having an investigation. They
are going to investigate what happened
to the price of oil. Every American
is involved in this. Here is a concrete
way to link up the struggle for peace
with what is happening every single
day. _

And then here is another thing, in
conclusion. The question of non-in-
tervention and isolationism. I think
that, when the American people talk
about isolation or non—intervention,
they have in mind peace, and just be-
cause we have an international concept
doesn’t mean that we have to scoff at
the idea of isolationism. It should 
utilized—the instinct of isolationism,
non-interference—in the struggle for
peace. I say this, comrades, because
the casualty during this discussion was
to look inwards without being involved
in the struggles of the people. I think
We have an opportunity to change this
situation now. (Applause.)

Irwin (New York): It seems to me
that in the addition proposed to the
draft resolution relating to the aggres-
sion in Egypt, a serious omission has
been made, and I wonder whether or
not the committee gave any considera-
tion to the role played by the United
States government in relation to the spe-
ciﬁc attack on Egypt. Now, I’m sure
that none of the comrades here have
any illusions as to the role played by
the United States government, and the

reason for the kind of intervention that
it made in helping to bring that par-
ticular aggression to an end. However,
it seems to me that it would be a serious
mistake, it would be closing our eyes
to what actually happened in the world,
to totally ignore the role played by our
government.

Now I’m not very expert at formu-
lating questions in relation to interna-
tional policy. However, I would like
to offer an amendment to the com-
mittee to cover this point. I don’t

 

stand by the words, and if they want to ~ .

change it to make it better, that’s all
right with me. But the essence of the
amendment would be to add some-
where in paragraph 2 in this proposed
addition to the draft resolution con-
cerning the international situation the
following: The conflict of interests be-
tween British and French imperialism,
on the one hand, and American im-
perialism on the other, placed o-ur own
government in the position of playing
an important role in bringing this ag-
gression to an end.

Sid (Upstate New York): I am
speaking in support of the resolution
as presented by Comrade Gates, and
in opposition to the general formula-
tion rnade by Comrade Weinstone. I’d
like to make the point here that the
contradiction in the resolution is a con-
tradiction in life; it’s a very genuine
contradiction. And it is not the formu-
lation in the resolution that we must
oppose, but the contradiction within
the imperialist world which makes such
objective facts exist. There is no ques-
tion about the fact that the Eisen-
hower administration took a forward

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 97

step at Geneva, and a backward step
in its Eisenhower doctrine. We cannot,
in our resolution, overlook the fact
that these are two objective facts. We
do not negate either one of them. We
do, however, point out to the people,
as well as to our own organization,
that when the Eisenhower Administra-
tion moves forward under pressure
of the people, it can be a progressive
step. When it moves back under pres-
sure of imperialism, it can injure the
interests of the people. I do not think
that we should close our eyes to pro-
gressive steps, even taken by an im-
perialist force under pressure. Nor do
we close our eyes to the backward
steps taken, as in the Eisenhower doc-
trine.

I think this whole movement of
peaceful coexistence which is progress-
ing, not retrogressing, in the main, is
one which must be viewed objectively
from every aspect. Those positions
which are forward positions we ap-
prove and ﬁght for and try to advance
further. Those which are backward
we point out to the people and fight
against them. Our position is not one
of support for reaction; it is support
for progressive movements in every di-
rection. Therefore, I am in support
of the resolution and opposed to the
Weinstone formulation. Thank you.
(Applause.)

AZ (New York): I want to speak
in favor of the formulations presented
here by Comrade Weinstone, and I
also believe that the resolution as a
Whole needs to be even further strength-
ened on this question. I agree with
Comrade Morris that the struggle for

peaceful coexistence started with the
very inception of the first socialist re-
public—a basic point—in the struggle
against Trotsky around the question of
the possibility of building socialism in
one country, which could not be done
without its existing in a world where
there were also capitalist countries.

I believe the struggle for peaceful
coexistence has been an essential part
of our Party program for many years,
and that what’s new in the world has
strengthened the possibilities of achiev-
ing victory, and not that now that it’s
brought us to our senses, we’ve got to
ﬁght and see the possibility of peaceful
coexistence. That’s been our ﬁght in
every phase of our work——our struggle
against war, over many years. I think
that, after the war, the strengthening
of the socialist camp, the lessons learned
by the people of the world in the war,
and so on, have increased the possibil-
ity for winning this ﬁght. And it is
a ﬁght. Peaceful coexistence must be
fought for. And it’s not enough to say
that the situation in the world is such
as to bring it about.

Especially on the part of the Ameri-
can Communists, the American work-

ing class, their special job is not to.

register developments in the world,
their special job is the exposure of
American imperialism, which is a main
threat to the peace of the world; which
is a main obstacle to the liberation of
the colonial peoples, and which is the
main organizer of counter-revolution in
the socialist countries. And our Party,
to fulﬁll its responsibility, to the Ameri-
can working class and the world, must
make  maior Point. the <.=xp0$urt; of

the role of American imperialism and
the organizing of the people in the
struggle against that imperialism.
I believe it is not enough to say that
for lack of time, and maybe in some
other resolutions, we don’t deal enough
with the question of Latin America.
That is our job-—that is one of our
number one jobs—the exposure of and
the struggle against American impe-
rialism and the subjugation, economic,
and political, of Latin America. I
think we must reject the line projected
only last Ianuary by Norman Thomas
when he said that the Latin American
dictators, such as Batista and others,
are trying to fool the democratic
United States, and further, when he
said, Latin America is full of pseudo-
democrats, who trample on the rights
of man in the same way that the So-
viet dictatorship does. I think that
this only conceals the main enemy—'—
American imperialism, and makes an
excuse for an attack against the best
ﬁghters of the Latin American peo-
ple.
And I say that, if nothing else, our
resolution must make clear that our
main job is to expose the fountainhead
of world reaction, American imperial-
ism, and organize the people to ﬁght
it. In this way, we will bring into
life our slogans for the possibility of
peaceful ooexistence. (Applause.)

Ben Davis (New York): Comrades,
I wish to support the formulations of
Comrade Weinstone, and to say just a
few more words on this question. Now
comrades, I have heard Comrade Lil
Gates’ presentation here, and there is
much that she says with which I

can agree. But my opinion is, com-
rades, that infighting for peace, and
in fighting for peaceful coexistence,
our Party has to have a class struggle
approach to this proposition. And we
cannot consider that the class struggle
ends at the water’s edge of our own
country, that the class struggle is tak-
ing place on an international scale.

The great possibilities of achieving
peaceful coexistence did not arise out
of the brow of Jove. This was a direct
result of the growth of the socialist
forces in the World, the burgeoning
colonial liberation movement, and the
beginning collapse of the colonial sys-
tem, and the sympathies of the peoples
of the world for peace and freedom
for the colonial peoples in all the capi-
talist countries.

And incidentally, comrades, it is my
opinion that we must tackle, not only
just a critical attitude toward the Eis-
enhower administration and its poli-
cies, but we have to come to grips
with this whole concept of a free
world, which is being led by American
imperialism, and British and French
imperialism. We have to challenge that
whole concept, and the whole basic role
of imperialism, and that Geneva was
something that arose with its great
possibilities, as a result of the growing
strength of the working class forces
of the world against the imperialist
forces of the world.

The class struggle which we have
in our country, and which takes place
in all capitalist countries, is a reﬂection
of and a part of the basic class strug-
gle on an international front which
is taking place between world impe-

 

up

‘pJ(l(| r'PUl\l‘*lFPVIuIv-rI—I-

rialism and the world socialist system.
And we will have peaceful coexistence,
and we’ll be able to realize this pros-
pect, to the effect that we seek to up-
hold, to strengthen the hand of the
world socialist system, of the working
class forces all over the world. And
that is the basic necessity of proletarian
internationalism, and not to water
down in any sense our struggle against
American imperialism.

Now this is not a struggle at all that
must be placed against our aim of an
anti-monopoly coalition. This is a part
of that struggle. But our Party has a
special vanguard role to play in connec-
tion with this proposition, and what is
it? It is our role to ﬁnd new ways,
modern ways, more self-effacing ways,
but nevertheless, ﬁrmly, to introduce
into the ranks of the working class and
the masses of people in our own coun-
try a consciousness of the struggle
against imperialism as imperialism.l

This is our link with the colonial
peoples of the world. What is it that
ties us with the people of Latin Amer-
ica, the people of South America, the
people of Asia, and the people of
Africa? It is precisely our struggle
against imperialism, and American im-
perialism, in the ﬁrst place. So we
have to talk differently about this, and
place this question centrally, as well as
our ﬁght to establish an anti-monopoly
coalition in our own country.

Now, comrades, it seems to me, in
the struggle for peaceful coexistence,
which is much more possible today
than ever before, I think that we have
to see it from both sides, and that we
don’t have to, in correcting our past

sectarian methods, set up some new
dogma here. That’s what we want to
avoid. Now, for example, you take the
phrase in the proposed addition to the
draft resolution, part I, re: the inter-
national situation. “The events in
Egypt and Hungary conﬁrmed the per-
spective set forth in draft resolution.”
I think that’s a one-sided statement
of the proposition. It just wipes off
the fact that thousands of Egyptians
were killed, that Israeli forces were
killed, that people lost their lives in
this war.

Wherein the forces of peace, operat-
ing in the spirit of Geneva, were able
to halt this war, and we should make
no doubt about it——the Soviet Union
was the primary one that contributed
to the halting of this war—America
helped, too, but it was the powerful
colonial movement which got America
to dissociate herself from Britain and
France. But we can’t be hesitant and
indecisive about this question; it was
the Soviet Union, primarily, that of-
fered to shed her own blood, along
with China. For the ﬁrst time, a great
power has offered to shed her own
blood on behalf of a colonial peo-
ple against imperialism.

But my opinion is that, wherein the
forces of peace were strong enough to
halt this war before it really spread-
and there was a serious danger of its
spreading, just like in Hungary-
American imperialism and its allies
took advantage of the mistakes made
by the Soviet and Hungarian forces.
Had they succeeded there, there would
have been a serious and tremendous
change in the basic relationship of

Ioo PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

forces, and we cannot be lulled that
world imperialism is not going to
change this basic relationship of forces.
So just this word—not even a minute,
just let me ﬁnish this sentence-and
that is, comrades, that wherein the peace
forces were strong enough to halt this
war, which took place in Egypt against
the Egyptian people, it was not strong
enough to prevent this war, and we
must have a peace movement which is
strong enough to prevent wars as Well
as to halt them after they get started.
(Applause.)

Dzmny (California): The section un-
der discussion lists a number of reas-
ons that have improved the peace forces
and the chances of peaceful coexistence.
However, there has been one factor that
I don’t think has enough attention in
the draft resolution as amended, which
is, in my opinion, a very real factor
in improving the strength of those
forces which have decided that war is
no longer a solution that can be tol-
erated by mankind, and that is the
end of the American monopoly on
hydrogen and atomic bombs—the pos-
session of those weapons, by more than
one side in the present world situation.
I think that this situation, the end of
the American monopoly, has convinced
millions of people that they can no
longer sit back and allow those who
prefer war-like solutions to continue
their machinations unhindered. And
while apparently the imperialist pow-
ers still feel a degree of freedom to
engage in a war against what they con-
sider small second or third rate colo-
nial powers like Egypt, the threat of
involvement of forces that represent

bigger powers causes them to retract
their position and to retreat very
quickly.

Now I would like to amend the sec-
tion, if I could, and I have only a very
rough wording—something to this ef-
fect-—“The ending of the monopoly on
atomic and hydrogen weapons tempor-
arily hel-d by the United States has
served to curb those in our country
who seek to impose United States for-
eign policy unilaterally. This more
universal possession of nuclear weap-
ons has helped convince many more
millions that no war-like solution to
future diﬂiculties can be tolerated if
mankind is to continue to exist.” (Ap-
plause.)

C/2.: We will hear from the chair-
man of the committee, in answer to
some of the questions raised.

Lil Gates: Comrades, I would urge
that, on this question, we do not at-
tempt to widen diﬁerences where there
is no basis for differences to exist. In
the opinion of a majority of the com-
mittee, the draft resolution as it is now
written, with the amendments that you
all have, clearly establishes a line of
struggle against US. imperialism. We
do not want to lay ourselves open by
adopting a general statement which
does not specify what is meant by that
motion, to a change in emphasis in this
resolution, and for that reason, the com-
mittee was not willing to go along
with the statement which says that the
draft resolution should expose United
States imperialism. It feels that it does.
And furthermore, with the amendment
that is added, that further strengthens
it and brings it up to date.

SESSIONS OF  CONVENTION 101

I also do not feel that there is any-
thing in the draft resolution which is
contrary to the question of class strug-
gle, because obviously, when we are
talking about a struggle for peace,
while this will go beyond the working
class, it is a struggle also involving
the class struggle, and I don’t think
we should attempt to judge the merits
or demerits of a particular document
by how many times we use the word
“struggle” or how many times we em-
phasize the word “ﬁght.” We are all
agreed on that, so why should it be
an issue? (Applause) What we wanted
to emphasize here was a clear line, what
is new in our thinking in relation to
the question of peaceful coexistence,
and for that reason, the majority of
the committee did not accept these
amendments.

Second, in relation to the amend-
ment that the comrade offered on the
H-bomb; it’s acceptable to us. We felt
that it was implied, or in fact, stated
in one way in the resolution, but if the
comrade feels that this particular
thought would aid, we certainly would
accept it.

Thirdly, on the question of the
United States role in Egypt; it is true
that the United States government
played a different role. As I explained
to Comrade Irwin, I don’t think his
particular formulation fully covers the
situation, but again, I think that there
is no objection to working it out ﬁnally
in such a way as to indicate what took
place in this situation. I felt that his
formulation would not cover it because
since that time, you have the Eisen-
hower doctrine on the Middle East,

and we would not simply want to be
at fault in ignoring that. If Comrade
Irwin would be satisfied with that ex-
planation, I believe it might be satis-
factory.

We would urge that we do not
quibble about this, but pass the main
sense of this resolution, and do it in
a way that will be crystal-clear what
we are saying.

Ch.: The question before the con-
vention is the adoption of the commit-
tee’s report, in which is incorporated
the amendment made by the delegate
from California. Are you ready to
vote?

A Delegate: Point of information: Does
the proposed amendment on the intema-
tional situation include the “Alice in
Wonderland” phrase at the end of number
two, saying that the intervention in Hun-
gary was primarily the intervention of the
imperialists.

Lil Gates: I have already explained,
comrades, that the sentences dealing with
the Hungarian situation are being turned
over to the general resolutions committee
for consideration, and it does not include
that sentence, whatever anyone’s 0-pinion
may be about it, one way or the other.

The Delegate: O-n Procedure: What guar-
antee have we, in terms of the scheduling
—this is perhaps for the Presiding Com-

mittee—that it will be possible to discuss A

this fundamental event of recent months,
that places the entire position of our Party
in question, at this convention before the
body?

Ch.: It would seem to me that every
question before the convention runs into
the same difficulty. We are trying to do
the best we can with l of them.

Weinstone (New York): On the ques-
tion of American imperialism. As I un-
derstood it in the committee, the commit-
tee was ready to consider it, but it had no
formulation before it. I therefore propose,
on the question of American imperialism,
a short section of one or two paragraphs
be introduced, and that this matter be re-

ferred to the resolutions committee for
editing, to see if we cannot get an agree-
ment. I am of the opinion that we will
get an agreement.

The second point, in regard to the ques-
tion of “formally renouncing” on page
18, I would like to propose to strike that
out. I have the feeling that if we had
more time last night that we would prob-
ably have come to an agreement on that,
too, and I hope the chairman of the reso-
lutions committee would accept a little
further discussion in the resolutions com-
mittee, and we may co-me in with that
proposal, too, and an agreement on that.
At any rate, if there is no agreement, I
would propose an amendment to strike
out those words on page eighteen.

Lil Gates: For the committee: I told
Comrade Will I had no objection, and never
will have any objection, to considering any
motion that is in writing. Since this is
being turned over to the resolutions com-
mittee, I think it is within Comrade Will’s
province, or anyone else in the convention,
to turn over to the resolutions commit-
tee the sense of what they would 'like to
be included, and then that will come be-
fore the convention, so I have no dis-
agreement with that proposal. »

I do disagree with striking out the
few words, because I think that this
gives a wrong impression of what is in
that section. The section simply describes
what happened at the Geneva Conference,
and if we are going to be so technical that
we want to strike out a few words, we
are going to get terribly involved——and the
committee felt that we did not go along
with that procedure.

Ch.: We’ll have to rule that the first
amendment made has been accepted by the
committee, and is a part of the general
motion. The second amendment contradicts
the motion as a whole, and is, there-
fore, out of order. The question follows
upon the adoption of the report of the
committee. Are you ready to vote?

A Delegate: Comrades, I was a member
of the committee which brought in this
report. We were informed by Sid Stein
that the oﬂicers of number six committee
were of the unanimous opinion that to pose
the question of Hungary before this con-
vention would be a provocation. I per-
sonally do not share this opinion. How-
ever, since that is the opinion of the oﬁ-
cers of the sub-committee which has to

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

deal with whether we get a chance to
discuss the matter or not—that is why I
must ask for a ruling as to whether we
can discuss this now, or at some other time.

Ch.: I’ll have to rule it out of order, be-
cause it is not the subject on the ﬂoor
at this time. And if it comes up, it will
come up in a more proper and appropriate
form than we are dealing with at the pres-
ent time.

A Delegate: Sub-committee number six
on miscellaneous resolutions has taken no
action up to this time on any resolutions
dealing with Hungary.

01.: There is no law that prevents sub-
committee six, eight or ten from so dealing
with it.

Chairman: The 3rd section of the
report of Sub—Comrnittee No. I will
be presented by Anna Correa of Col-
orado.

Anna Correa (Colorado): Com—
rades, this is the report on the 3rd
section of the Draft Resolution, call-
ed “The Path Ahead.” Resolutions
dealing with questions under Section
2, “The Path Ahead,” have been re-
ceived from New Iersey, Eastern
Penn., Indiana, Illinois, California,
Washington, and New York.
There are no resolutions that
take issue with the line and di-
rection of Section 2. There are
no proposals from any state or-
ganization or delegation to alter any
principled question or to substitute
some new major propositions for
what is now contained in Section 2.
There are a number of Resolutions
and proposals for additions to this
very important section. Your com-
mittee recommends that we agree
with the sense of a number of these

  

 

'.'cp|..aI-11';'(‘D|-ID

O

 

SESSIONS OF ‘THE CONVENTION I03

proposals and that we refer them for
inclusion when the Resolution is
edited. They are as follows: a pro-
posal to include at the bottom of page
30 in the printed copy of the Draft
a demand for the elimination of
depletion allowances whereby mon-
opolists who engage in the extraction
of oil and mineral wealth from the
earth are allowed to write off their
taxes the depletion of these natural
resources and so on. The proposal is
that we include a demand for an end
to this give—away practice. Also, a
proposal that a section be included
which deals with the Puerto Rican,
Mexican, Indian and other national
minorities as special victims of mon-
opoly, pointing up the need for spe-

cial approaches to these groups as

unique sources of strength to the
anti—monopoly coalition.

Your committee took note of the
fact that a number of state conven-
tions and in some of the pre—conven-
tion discussion a certain amount of
confusion was evident in relation to
anti—monopoly coalition and anti-
imperialist struggle. The committee
proposes that a brief section be in-
cluded -which clariﬁes the matter,
pointing out that these two are not
identical, that the anti—monopoly
coalition is one which is capable of
embracing vast forces that are either
not anti—imperialist as yet or who
would not accept anti—imperialism as
a condition for joining the anti—mo-
nopoly coalition even though they

may become anti—imperialist in the
course of events, or forces who have
differing views as to what anti—im-
perialism really is.

Everyone remembers, for example,
the shameful attitude of many labor
leaders in support of the reactionary
Wall Street-backed intervention
which overthrew the popularly elect-
ed government of Guatemala. And
while we denounced such support
we would also condemn any effort to
read these labor leaders out of help-
ing the anti-monopoly coalition be-
cause of it. To equate the anti—im-
perialist struggle with the anti—mon-
opoly coalition would cause great
harm to the development of that
coalition. At the same time the Com-
munist Party has a special duty to

carry on anti—imperialist propaganda .

and agitation, to raise anti—imperialist
slogans in a politically appropriate
manner and to seek to win ever wider
sections of the people to the anti-
imperialist struggle.

How this is done, in what way is

a matter of tactics that must be‘

worked out concretely in each given
case. In addition to including a sec-
tion on this question in the Resolu-
tion, the Committee recommends
that the incoming leadership issue
educational material for further
clarification on this matter.

Now the Farm Commission of
New York State had a proposal on
farm policy, urging that the sense
of it be included on page 30 or page

  

is;

31 of the Draft. We propose to turn
over to the editing committee the
complete proposal recommending
that its essence be included in brief
form and because this is a problem
of great importance to the Conven-
tion, we propose to read a few para-
graphs here, and I quote:

“It is our aim to defend the interests
primarily of the family farmer against
the greed and robbery of the food, feed

and equipment monopolies which

-threaten to put him out of business.

We recognize the mutual interests of
all farmers in improving the price
structure for all farm products. We
reject Secretary Benson’s concept of _the
farm surplus as the major agricultural
problem today. Government stocks of
farm products are insigniﬁcant com-
pared to the needs of our citizens and
of the world. They are not distributed
to hungry consumers only because they
are useful to the food trusts in driving
down farm prices. We believe that a
longer range solution to the problem
of the farmer can only come through a
rounded program of government pro-
tection of family-sized farmers from the
trusts. This will undoubtedly include
production payment to family-sized
farms, a sound soil conservation pro-
gram to restore soil fertility, energetic
government effort to expand the use of
farm products to alleviate hunger and
undernourishment at home and abroad,
low interest loans, publicly owned
‘yardstick’ processing plants, etc.
“The aim of all farm policy must be
to enable the family-sized farmer to
utilize latest agricultural techniques

and machinery and to raise his income
to a parity with that of other sections
of the population.”

[The speaker then called attention to
the amendment prepared by the pre-Con-
vention Resolutions Committee on the re-
sults of the 1956 national elections.]

Finally the Committee proposes
the following addition to the end of
Part 2 on page 34 of the Draft, fol-
lowing the last paragraph on that
page: '

“Many questions of the content of
the anti-monopoly coalition and espe-
cially of labor’s role in relation to it
remain unanswered. In order for our
Party to make its maximum contribu-
tion towards helping the labor move-
ment emerge as an independent polit-
ical force, and thereby promote the
progress of the anti-monopoly coalition,
it is necessary to determine the present
level of development of the working
class as distinguished from the ’3o’s
and ’4o’s, the character of the labor
movement, its present-day program,
the direction in which it is moving, the
chief ideological questions confronting
it, how it can develop heightened polit-
ical consciousness in the course of eco-
nomic and other struggles, and many
other related questions. Towards this
end the National Committee shall or-
ganize a series of regional conferences,
bringing together National Committee
members and representative groups of
industrial workers for a common
searching into these matters, on the
basis of which it shall organize either
an extraordinary national conference or
a special enlarged National Committee
meeting devoted to working out these

problems in their most essential and
basic aspects.”

Comrade Chairman, the Committee
moves that these proposals and amend-
ments be adopted.

[Motion carried to postpone action pend-
ing mimeographing of the proposed
amendments.l

Fred Blair (Wisconsin): Amend-
ment, brother chairman. I’d like to
make an amendment that speciﬁcally
the part dealing with the farm ques-
tion be referred to sub-Committee No.
6 because they have other material
relating to this question.

C}I.: We are now ready for the re-
port of the subcommittee of the
Resolutions Committee on Negro
rights and Negro—white unity. I call
on Comrade Jackson.

lame: Iackson: Comrades, the
chairman of each delegation should
have received a copy of the amended
version of a substitute section of the
Draft Resolution pertaining to the
struggle for Negro rights which you
have in your kits. It is headed “Rally
to the Banner of the Struggle for
Negro F reedom—Key to Strengthen-
ing American Democracy.” Now this
is the document submitted by the
sub-committee of the pre—Convention
Resolutions Committee which has
subsequently undergone several
amendments and additions and sub-
tractions in the course of the deliber-
ations of the sub-committee of this
Convention.

Now because of the length of time
I will forego any extended remarks
introducing this resolution, but will

read it as amended. However, let me
point out one or two facts about the
progress of this resolution to this
point. There is probably no (;lOCli=
ment you will act on in this conven-
tion that has been more vigorously
handled, amended and compared
with state documents, using numer-
ous contributions to the discussion on

theoretical aspects of the Negro

question to documents and reports
made in state conventions and sec-
tion conventions in an effort to go
through and screen the best ideas:
that would add to our direction in
the preparation of this draft amend-
ment for your consideration.

It is well known that the outstand-
ing exciting feature of struggle on
the American frontier of social pro-
gress is the great and inspiring strug-
gle being spearheaded by the Negro
people in Montgomery, Alabama. It
is well to note and to cite the words.
of Frederick Douglass because this
is the week that we observe the an-
niversary of the birth of Frederick.
Douglass. He said at one time: “It
is well said that a people to whom
freedom is given can never wear it
grandly as can they who have fought
and suffered to gain it. Here as else-
where what comes easily is liable to
go easily. But what man will ﬁght

to gain, that man will ﬁght to main-
tain.”

And indeed in the Deep South,

the Negro people as demonstrated in
the headlines of the _ daily papers,

I06

hold no illusion that freedom will be
given to them as a boon, they are in
the process of a determined course
of struggle to win it as a natural
right. And this great struggle of the
Negro people today inspires all
Americans to the promise of what
America can become with unity,
with ﬁerce determination and skill-
ful tactics in struggle.

We have particularly been influ-
enced and guided by a study of a
series of state resolutions on this
question as well as participating in
many discussions with a number of
comrades. Particularly the resolu-
tions of Washington, Michigan, Los
Angeles County and the California
resolution, Illinois, Virginia, South

Carolina, Florida, Eastern Penn.,‘

Ohio and New York. Particularly
these states will recognize certain
points of emphasis in this resolution
which they contributed to. In addi-
tion, there are many other important
contributions, which have been sub-
mitted in resolutions or statements or
letter form which will be referred to
a theoretical commission which is
dealing with the question of formu-
lating basic ideological premises and
policy on the overall theoretical pre-
mises of the Negro question. This’ is
ruled out as a province for this sec
tion of the Resolution.
Furthermore, one should bear in
mind that this is not a resolution in
itself. It is a section of the main gen-

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

eral resolution that this convention
is called upon to adopt with all the
necessary amendments. And con-
sequently, we should examine the
context of this proposed substituted
section bearing in mind the context
in which it will appear, that is, there
will be several other general sections
of the general resolution which will
also have its relationship and interac-
tion on guiding our Work in the ﬁeld
of the struggle for Negro rights.
Now, if you will follow with the
copy you have, I wish to read the
amended copy, to replace the portion
in the Draft Resolution, entitled,
“For full economic, political and so-
cial equality for the Negro people,”
pages .21, 22, 23, 24, and 25, of Sec-
tion I, and pp. 49, 50, 51 and 52 of
Section 4, entitled, “The Party and
the Struggle for the Negro People.”

[The Speaker then read the text of the
Resolution, which appears on page 253.]

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 107

Harry Haywood (New York): I
greet whatever points towards a pro-
gram of action in the ﬁeld of Negro
work projected in this resolution. But
let us have no illusions. The struggle
to put into life even these minimal
points can only proceed within the
framework of a consistent, relentless
ﬁght against the right-revisionist posi-
tion on the Negro question——a blatant
line of abandoning the leading role

of our Party in the struggle for Ne- _

gro rights.

Fundamentally, while the sharpening
contradictions and social antagonisms
involved in the Negro question are
demonstrated in life, the Right at-
tempts to underplay these contradic-
tions—to deny the basic anti-imperialist
character of the Negro question, and
thus to capitulate to U.S. imperialism.

The Right—revisionist line of trailing
behind the top NAACP leadership
caught us unaware at the sudden out-
burst of mass struggle under new,
militant, petty bourgeois leadership in
the South; and by the vicious, deter-
mined Dixiecrat-Wall Street counter-
offensive of intimidation and terror.
We were training the top Right-re-
formist leadership, while the masses
ran far ahead of them, and us, under
new, militant leadership.

The Right-opportunist position on
the Negro question was most clearly
elaborated by Doxey Wilkerson in No.
2 discussion bulletin. What is his esti-
mate of the present situation? He ex-
aggerates the gains of the war and
postwar boom period to the point
where he sounds like the Voice of
America. Nor does he see the tenuous

nature of the advances made. He “over-
looks” the role of U.S. imperialism.
His is a line which can only spread
illusions, disarm and disintegrate the
Negro freedom movement. Fortunately,
the Negro people are not following
his “leadership.” Wilkerson’s position
leads him to the point where even in
the face of the Dixiecrat counter-of-
fensive of terror unleashed since the
Till case, and gaining momentum dur-
ing this present period, he can claim
that anti-Negro terror has abated in
the South! _

In his attempt to revise our basic
position on the Negro question, Wil-
kerson tries to make a big point about
the out-migrations of Negroes from the
Black Belt area. This is a piddling
point——a prime example of a schematic
non-dialectical approach. It is an at-
tempt to reduce the national question
to nose-counting.

The Negro national question involves
the entire deep South. The tremen-
dous proletarianization of Negroes in
the deep South has only sharpened the
fundamental contradictions involved in
the Negro question. These changes
only emphasize the special, national
character of the Negro question. I

Wilkerson and the Right do not see
the inevitable next step in the face of
shattered illusions concerning the role
of the Supreme Court and the Federal
government. That is, the perspective
of a developing national revolutionary
Negro movement in the deep South,
the eventual aim of which will be some
form or degree of autonomy—-or suf-
ﬁcient political power in the hands of
the suppressed to guarantee their

;.
l

 

I08

rights. This in no way is in contra-
diction to the slogan of democratic
integration. Thus the Negro people’s
movement becomes an especially sig-
niﬁcant part of the international anti-
colonialist upsurge—a national revolu-
tionary movement in the heartland of
U.S. imperialism, the bulwark of
world reaction.

Conditions now exist for a united
front of militant, anti-imperialist
struggle—for the ﬁght for the hege-
mony of the Negro working class with-
in the framework of all-class unity, of
which a constituent part is the ﬁght
for the vanguard role of the Commu-
nist Party in the Negro freedom
movement. Thus, the Negro working
class will emerge as an independent
force in the united front—-the only
consistent force that sees the road
ahead, all the way through.

It is not enough to greetjthese new,
heroic struggles in the South. The
embattled Negro people want our help.
They cannot win alone. They need our
Party, and the international working
class movement, to support their
struggle.

We don’t have all the answers. But
we can‘ distinguish between a revolu-
tionary line and a capitulatory, reform-
ist position as elaborated by Doxey
and supported by the associationists.

A Delegate (New York): Comrades,
the comrades who sent me here as dele-
gate asked that when I come to the Na-
tional Convention I extend the greet-
ings of the Iamaica section of Queens
County and the assurance that we will
try to carry on the work of the Party
in this period.

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

First I support the resolution gen-
erally overwhelmingly. But in that sec-
tion dealing with the main weaknesses
of the Party, I think that we have to
be more speciﬁc. For our Party in
Iamaica, if you take the ﬁeld of civil
rights, if you take the ﬁeld of political
work, if you take the ﬁeld of public
education, where you ﬁnd that the
Party membership is enjoying broad
relationships, you find that they are
enjoying positions of responsibility and
trust among the masses of the people.
But this same approach does not per-
tain to the Party, even though many
of these people are known as Party
people. So I think that there must be
made a distinction when we speak of
relative isolation of the Party between
the isolation of the membership and
the position of isolation of the Party
organization.

Now I’d like to present some means
of overcoming the isolation of the
Party. I think that for one thing, the
Party’s isolation is due in a measure
to our objective situation, but due to an
extent because of our own methods of
work. In the main the method of work
of our leadership is much removed
from the mass struggle. Nothing would
bring forward the Party as an organ-
ization in the Negro people’s move-
ment, I believe, better than if we would
step forward within the movement of
the people as representatives of the
Party.

Mort (Wisconsin): I’d like to speak
in approval of this resolution. I con-
sider this a very strong document and
a very good resolution on the Negro
question. And also I wish to approve

~ »s-.-.w.,1--.--s-—,i.-‘~.-~ -

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 109

this resolution because it points to
white participation in this struggle.
In every ﬁeld, in labor, on the hous-
ing question and our other struggles, I
think that this is a key point. There
were many times in Wisconsin when
we thought that our job was always
to place the burden of this struggle
upon the Negro comrades. And I think
that was incorrect. We felt that the
main emphasis was to struggle to unite

the Negro people, the Negro organiza- .

tions, behind certain struggles, and we
found that that was done without our
work. But where the thing was lack-
ing was that our organization or lead-
ers did not participate in the struggles
and the problems that the Negro peo-
ple were faced with.

For instance, just lately there was a
so-called “rape” case engineered by the
police in Milwaukee in order to inti-
midate newcomers to our city, and the
whole thing was sharpened by the way
in which the newspapers cooperated
and almost 250 Negro people were
dragged into the police were ﬁnger-
printed, were mugged, and were put
before the line, and it was found that
there was nobody that they could
identify. Then the NAACP, the Urban
League, and other organizations step-
ped forward and protested. But not
any labor unions came forward. Nor

did labor nor anything near the Left

or on the Left protest. Therefore, I be-
lieve that this resolution which points
directly at our weakness and tries to
correct it, should be endorsed by this
convention.

France: (Pennsylvania): Comrades,
first I would like to say that I feel the

Resolution begins to make the first
contribution that we’ve made in a_ long
time in the struggle for Negro rights,
in the struggle for Negro liberation.
However, we cannot consider this reso-
lution the full program of the Party
nor its policy. It is but the first totter-
ing step in that direction. I have found
in discussions with comrades over a
period of time now and I think the Re-
solution indicates this to some degree,
that the Party cannot do anything but
aid the Negro liberation movement,
that it cannot at this time play a role
of leadership, giving leadership to the
movement as a Whole.

Now I feel that in committee such
an ideology does exist and I think
that the Resolution does to some degree
permit it to continue, that we would
not only be negating the role of the
Party, but then why belong to the
Communist Party? There are many
other organizations that can aid the
Negro people’s liberation. What it is
that we have to contribute is far be-
yond that. That is the socialist content
of our Party, our Marxist-Leninist
ideology and yet our vanguard role in
the whole Negro liberation struggle.

And I don’t feel that at this time
we should permit our Resolution to go
through without some further exami-
nation of this question. A comrade
spoke earlier and spoke about in his
section the comrades having ties with
the masses, yet this has not been relat-
ed to their membership in the Party
or the Party’s role in regard to giving
them leadership and their leadership
there. If we are only a part of that
movement without giving it the Com-

munist content that we can give it,
then certainly we are not playing our
role as Communists within the move-
ment as a whole and within the whole
struggle for the building of an anti-
monopoly coalition as well.

I would like to see the Committee
re-examine this question and write
another paragraph or something to the
effect on this question.

Herb Whccldiﬁ (New York): There
are a number of good things in this
Resolution, and yet I ﬁnd myself in the
position of being forced to oppose the
Resolution as it presently stands. I
shall have to address my remarks to
those things which I consider negative
in the Resolution because time won't
permit me to deal with those things
which are positive. I therefore will not
touch on the question of the language

sider the language is not a_ model of
Communist modesty and I’m not trying
to be anti-semantic in that respect. I
think, however, the main objection that
I would have to this resolution, with
certain reservations, is that this Reso-
lution could have been written in 1936
or 1946 and does not take into account
the fact that this is 1957. And I ﬁnd it
a little diﬂicult to understand how it is
that some of us as Communists who in
fact are specialists in change, who want
to change the whole world, don’t take
into account the changes that are tak-
ing place. There are constant changes
that are taking place in the world. This
Resolution makes no reference to a
whole series of things which have
changed conditions among the Negro
people in this country which must be

of the Resolution as a whole. I con»

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

taken into account before our Party
can scientiﬁcally develop a program
which is going to appeal to the Negro
people. In the ﬁrst place there has been
a change in the economic status of the
Negro in this country. It’s not the same
as it was I0 years ago. It seems to me
the Resolution must register that.

In the second place, new methods of
struggle have developed in the South.
This Resolution to some extent is mis-
leading, because you do not get the im-
pression that the new methods of
struggle in the South developed, not

‘from a Marxist-Leninist approach, but

from the methods which Ghandi em-
ployed in India. I think this deserves
some analysis and some estimate and
some conclusions drawn from that.

Third, it does not record the fact
that in the labor movement there is
occurring a very basic change. There
are 2 million organized Negro workers
in this country today, a larger Negro
proletariat than exists in many of the
smaller capitalist countries in the
world, a most important and dynamic
factor in helping to inﬂuence the polit-
ical future of the Negro people as well
as the entire American people.

The fourth thing is that the Resolu-
tion makes no reference to the “Free
by ’63” program-—and ’63 isn’t too far
away. I think it should have something
to say on that.

Fifth is, it makes no reference to the
tremendous movement which is de-
veloping among the white masses, par-
ticularly under the leadership of the
churches. Today the churches are tak-
mg an active role to win advances for
thc N¢8'1’0 people. Also it doesn’t rec-

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION rrr

ord some geographical and statistical
facts that, for instance, New York State
today has the largest Negro popula-
tion of any state in the country. Cali-
fornia is third or fourth. These are
changes that have taken place in the
last 5 or ten years.

Finally, I would say that we cannot
have a Resolution that does not at least
refer to the fact whether we are still
or not a nation in the South, because
many of our tactics and approaches
arise from that basic position. And I
think the Resolution has to at least
reﬂect some opinion on that.

Finally, on a point of personal pri-
vilege, I for one as a delegate to this
convention want to dissociate myself
from the kind of remarks made by
Comrade Haywood with reference to
Dqxey Wilkerson in this discussion.
(Applause.)

Bill S. (New York): Comrades, I
rise for the Resolution. I am not one
to say take everything on the Negro
question and study it. I happen to be a
mass leader and I have been before
different government bodies speaking
on behalf of several issues (I won’t
name the issues). But you are all
acquainted with the fact that even in
Washington on the question of Negro
homes being bombed, they won’t send
anybody to investigate. You know. And
I’m against all this examining what
we mean, and all that. I’m ready to do
something.

On the question the comrade just
spoke about, the tactics used in Ala-
bama, and the tactics used by Gandhi,
he also tied that up with the economic
conditions. But he failed to state that

passive resistance was the key thing
in Gandhi’s territory where they were
sitting on the ground and living in mud
huts. Passive resistance is the basis in
the South, and they have nice homes
down there, and are not living in mud
huts. The economic conditions may be
better but in New York City when
somebody talks about the good stan-
dards of the Negro people, and we had
one comrade at our state convention,
she said, “I don’t know what we are

i talking about when we say the million

people have so many dollars invested,
etc., etc.” She said, “all I know is that
when I came here I didn’t have carfare.
And I live about 21 blocks away and I
had to walk to this meeting. And I'm
still hungry.” So what they are talking
about don’t mean nothing to me. It just
means that they are getting a little
more and I’m getting a few bigger
crumbs. And as for the American tra-
dition and the Negro people today,
they are still hungry. Sure they make
$3000 a year and they pay more taxes
in a year than some have paid in a
whole lifetime, to say nothing of other
things like the cost of living, etc.
Now I am for this Resolution. It
doesn’t spell out every detail. It never
will because in some 75 or 80 years or
more of struggle for Negro rights, I
feel that we are going to do something
about it if we struggle. As long as we
talk, we do nothing. So far as the Ne-
gro people’s struggle is concerned, I'm
not worried too much about the Negro
struggling for political rights. I think
we should worry about what the white
comrades are going to do about this
particular struggle, because as far as

 

.112

some comrades are concerned, the Ne-
groes understand that you want to ﬁght
but we want to know how you are
going to do it.

Wm. Patterson (New York): Com-
rades, I want to speak first for the Re-
solution. It is my opinion that this
(convention cannot report out a resolu-
‘-tion of this character without sending
a special message to the Negro people.
‘I believe that this convention should
send an Open Letter, a special message
to the Negro people, and I think that
one has been placed in the hands of the
chairman of this committee. Secondly,
it is my opinion that while the Reso-
lution is an excellent step forward, the
vanguard role of our Party is not suf-
ﬁciently brought out in this resolution.
Therefore, with reference to page 4,
.and the provision marked I, I would
like to make two amendments. One is
that while we speak in that paragraph
of the role in part of the Iudiciary and
speak also of the Congressional branch
of government and legislative branch
of government, there ought as well to
be a criticism there of the failure of the
executive branch of government to
use its police power and the power
of its Department of Justice and while
I am not formulating that now, I shall
formulate it and hand it to the chair-
man.

Second, I believe that in the same
paragraph there should be a speciﬁc
call for the impeachment of Eastland
and maybe some others, but Eastland

‘ in particular.

Now I come to a point on a matter
which I believe is of vital importance.
This Resolution nowhere mentions the

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

United Nations and yet the attitude
of the American government to the
Negro people is a violation, not only
of the Charter of the United Nations
but as well of the Universal Declara-
tion of Human Rights of the United
Nations which our Government has
not yet ratiﬁed. We remember that
when a question was raised of this
character against the South African gov-
ernment it had such great vitality that
the South African government was
forced even to withdraw from the Lea-
gue on several occasions. I believe that
incorporating in this resolution the
question of the failure of the U.S.
Government to live up to the charter
with reference to the Negroes would
have a tremendous impact on the whole
world situation in that as far as our
Party is concerned, it would bring it
forward as carrying out in this way
its international solidarity against segre-
gation.

Next, comrades, I feel that also in
the United Nations our government has
failed to ratify the Convention on
Womens Rights. It has failed to ratify
the Convention for the Punishment of
Genocide, and this also should be put
in this resolution. -

Charles (New York): I am prepared
gracefully to withdraw, keep quiet as
I usually do. However, I think the
schoolteachers have a contribution to
make to this discussion in view of the
fact that teachers and parents too are
faced with this subject of the integra-
tion of the schools, and that’s not
simply a southern problem. In fact,
sophisticated and complacent New
York has that problem on its hands

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION ii}

right now. I know this will be adequ-
ately dealt with but I think as a South-
erner, born and bred and educated in
the South, I do have something to say.
As I said to Comrade Berry once, what
I have learned about this so-called Ne-
gro question I’ve learned the slow and
hard way. But I told him that I had the
advantage of studying it from the point
of View of a hill-billy of the South.

Now traditionally the poor whites of
the South and the Negroes have gotten
together very easily on many historic
occasions. That’s one reason why I’m
speaking. But it’s not- the main reason.
Now, as I say, we are faced with a
practical problem and here’s a good
test of our method of work as an op-
portunity for mass activity—and by
the way, I’m for this resolution-—I vote
for those six pages without a question.
I’d vote on faith. I don’t think that
literally if this were from heaven, six
pages would be perfect. But I would
vote for this without any amendment.

But on this matter of segregation, I
attended a hearing of the Board of
Education 2 or 3 weeks ago. I didn’t
participate, but I listened to the hear-
ing. There were ’many civic organiza-
tions there and numerous teachers or-
ganizations. Well, the teachers let them-
selves in for a lot of hard drubbing.
I think it was a leader of the Urban
League made the remark, “It looks
as if the teachers themselves are going
to have to be integrated.” But the
Teachers Union there spoke out very
clearly and unequivocally for enforcing
the integration of the New York school
system right away. That stood out clear-

ly. For the beneﬁt of the Philbricks, the
Wolfsons and Harry Schwartzes, that
may be around, I’m not speaking for
the Teachers Union. I’m speaking for
myself.

Glemiora (Calz';‘ornz'a): I rise to speak
for the Resolution. I worked on the
Committee and I think it’s a good reso-
lution. Now I feel that for the first
time we’ve come out with something
that Negroes want and not what the
C.P. wants Negroes to want. (Ap-

'plause). I really feel that this is im-

portant. Now one or two people got
up and spoke about liquidationist
trends, etc., but I feel this way that the
Party has to set down on paper what
it believes in conjunction with the
actual experiences of life.

Now along these lines I have a lot
of criticism of the resolution, especially
the part that a couple of other people
mentioned regarding the main weak-
nesses. But I still feel it should be
adopted because I feel that out of this
we can go home and say, “start a strug-
gle on housing.” It speaks of where
labor should stand and for the first
time it’s a practical approach. It isn’t
full of a lot of words stretched out in
our phraseology which I don’t think
many Negroes and workers understand.
Now I think it’s very clear and very
much to the point on this subject.

Another thing that I feel very sin-
cerely about is on this last part of it.
Even though it isn’t a drawn-out affair,
I think it faces the issue clearly and it
does give a slight ideological direction.

Don W/zecldizz (California): As dis-
tinguished from Herb Wheeldin in
New York, I want to say that we have

 

I14

differences. I support the Resolution
(applause). But by the same token
I want it unmistakably clear that
thoroughly associate myself with hi
in his defense of Doxey Wilkerson
(Applause).

Comrades, I understand that there is
to be called a special conference that
will go into some of these questions
that have been raised by those who are
not prepared as yet to support the re-
solution. Such a conference will at that
time deal with all the questions of the
Negro people as a nation, will deal
with the situation as regards Negroes
in this country. And as for the question
of the language of the resolution, it’s
my view that that language is con-
sistent with the language used by Ne-
gro leaders and may well be an enrich-
ment of the whole body of approach to
these questions by our movement. ‘

I think that we can certainly find
that in the developing struggles in the
South, including Montgomery, that
there’s one thing that should impress
us: that that struggle has begun to de-
velop the syrnpathy of millions of peo-
ple, white Americans in these United
States. And we are going to have to
skillfully develop a program that will
address itself to winning that kind of
sympathy in order to help bring a full
measure of freedom to the Negro peo-
ple here in our country.

Paul (New York): I have a speciﬁc
amendment with reference to page 5. Very
brieﬂy on the section “forms and methods

. of struggle" page 5, 2nd par., to state in

a positive way, in place of saying, “It is
not the task of Communists etc.,” that it
should say “It is therefore the task of Com-
munists to play their special role basing

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

themselves upon the forms of struggle and
on the tactics which ﬂow from the historic
development of the Negro people.”

A number of amendments are proposed
from the ﬂoor.]

Parliamentarian: Amendments even un-
der my liberal interpretation, which really
should be amendments going to the com-
mittee and not to the ﬂoor of the conven-
tion, -should have been made when the
discussion was not closed. Every one of
these amendments is in the form of par-
ticipating in the discussion. We’ll be here
all night, and we haven’t got the time.

[Procedural discussion.]

Chairman: Before we vote on the
motion to accept the report, I’ll recog-
nize Comrade Iackson for a few com-
ments on the discussion.

Iacksortz Iust a few remarks, oom-
rades. First of all, certain resolutions
have been passed up, like one for further
detailizing the relationship of the de-
velopment of the Negro movement to
the anti-monopoly coalition, and cer-
tain of these propositions that have
been passed up will be given the con-
sideration of the committee.

Iust a couple of words on some of
the commentary on the resolution as a
whole. The resolution was challenged
by one of the speakers with the sug-
gestion of tabling on the basis that it
utilizes the term “vanguard role.” The
term “vanguard role” is used; it’s made
clear as to its function. There’s no am-
biguity that Communists have a role
of initiative, responsibility, and to ex-
ercise that vanguard role is a question
of correct policies, methods and tactics,
and has nothing in common with sep-
aratism, where separatist action is not
called for. But like all progressive
forces, the Communists in the first in-
stance have a responsibility of inﬂuence,

 

 

SESSIONS OF  CONVENTION 115

of leadership in the sphere of inﬂuence,
and policy-elaborating to further the
struggle for Negro rights.

In reference to the indictment of the
resolution by Comrade Haywood as
suffering the inﬂuences of right liquida-
tionism, tailism, and so forth, I don’t
know what resolution Comrade Hay-
wood was addressing himself to. This
resolution, in my opinion, and the
unanimous opinion of all states repre-
sented here through their resolutions
committee, is that this resolution neither
tails nor projects imagery, but is rooted
quite ﬁrmly in the realities of the de-
veloping people’s struggles and the
necessity for further developing them.
Therefore, in the name of the resolu-
tions committee, I reject their charac-
terization and its accompanying identi-
ﬁcation of this inﬂuence with Comrade
Wilkerson, who worked as one of the
secretaries in the convention resolutions
committee of this subcommittee, along
with Comrade Carl Winter and myself,
with much of the responsibility for
further editing this resolution. Other
resolutions made will be presented to
the resolutions committee for further
elaboration. The comrade from Ohio,
after consultation, agreed that the cen-
tral ideas he was concerned with are
already adequately covered in the reso-
lution, and consequently, has with-
drawn his amendment.

As to the challenge to the resolution
made by Comrade Herb of New York
—“it could have been written in any
year, in 1947, for example,” that “its
language is not ﬁttingly modest.” In
my opinion, this has been adequately
answered by Comrade Wheeldon from

California. The resolution starts with
the most ﬂaming realities in life——the
struggle unfolding, which is a headline
phenomenon of our time, which gives
tone and inspiration to all phases of
the people’s struggle. It could not have
been written in 1947—that phenomenon
wasn’t there. It isn’t the business of
the Communist Party or anyone else
primarily concerned with advancing
the rights of the Negro people, to pre-
occupy themselves with the ground al-
ready covered. The business of the
Communist Party and all other forces
of social consequence in the fight for
Negro rights is to address themselves
to the ground yet to be covered, closing
the gap in inequalities. It isn’t to
catalogue and Write hosannas to the
achievements that have been wrought
out of yesterday’s struggle, but the
directions as to how to fulﬁll and real-
ize the necessary and vital universally
agreed upon goals of equality now.
The proposal of Comrade Patterson
of a special salute to the Negro people
from this convention I propose be taken
up by the resolutions committee as _a
whole. We have a copy of such a

proposed draft, and I propose that,

action on it be submitted subsequently.
I move the adoption of the resolution,
with such amendments as referred to.
(Applause)

C/2.: Are you ready for the vote?
[Vote taken.] Four opposed. Eight
abstentions. Carried.

I will now call on subcommittee
No. 4, on the American road to so-
cialism. Comrade Krchmarek of
Ohio is reporting.

    

116

A. Krchmarek (Ohio): Reporting
on the committee on the American
road to socialism. This report will be
presented in two parts: myself re-
porting on the American road, and
Comrade Blumberg reporting on the
resolution on social democracy and
the question of the mass party of so-
cialism. In order to conserve time,
I will be very brief in the presenta-
tion. The committee took note of the
fact that there has been broad agree-
ment on the discussion in our Party
of this section of the draft resolution,
dealing with the general direction
and projecting the outlook for a
peaceful constitutional transition to
socialism in the United States. In
fact, the resolutions and amend-
ments submitted to the committee
dealt mainly with proposals to
strengthen the resolution by emphas-
izing and clarifying a number of
questions, such as intensiﬁed class
struggle during the period of transi-
tion, and the need to spell out more
clearly the constitutional aspects of
the transition.

The committee came to the con-
clusion also that this section of the
draft resolution raises a number of
important theoretical questions which
require some intensive study and

clariﬁcatio-n. We felt that neither the

sub—committee nor this convention
are in a position to give these ques—
tions adequate attention and treat-
ment, and therefore, that something

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

should be done about it. Among
these questions are the following:
(I) The role of the state as an in-
strument of class rule in the period
of peaceful transition. (2) The need
to elaborate more clearly the speciﬁc
form of the constitutional procedures
in achieving a peaceful, democratic
transition. (3) The need to clarify
the relationship of the anti—monopoly
coalition to the transition to social-
ism, and the forms of struggle to
facilitate this. (4) The need to deal
more adequately with the question
of democracy and civil liberties un-
der socialism in the United ‘States.
On this question of civil liberties, it
was felt that a much more positive
treatment is needed in presenting
the enormous expansion of democ-
racy, far greater than under any
bourgeois form of democracy, that
would come into existence with the
coming in of socialism. In this res-
pect, we should learn from the errors
committed in other countries in de-
veloping our own forms, which are
in accord with the democratic tradi-
tions in our country.

The committee recommends that
the elaboration of some of these theo-
retical questions be included in the
Party program that is to be under-
taken on the basis of the decisions
of this convention, as well as in other
Party documents.

In view o-f the above, the commit-
tee proposes to the convention the

 

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

following action on this section of
the draft resolution: (I) that this
convention favors and approves the
sense and the intent of the draft re-
solution, presenting the concept of
the advocacy by the Communist
Party of peaceful, constitutional, dem-
ocratic socialism in the United States;
(2) that the theoretical questions
relating to this question be given
serious study and elaboration in the
forthcoming Party documents, par-
ticularly in the Party program; (3)
that in the ﬁnal editing of this sec-
tion, it be strengthened along the
lines of the concise paragraph in
Comrade Dennis’ keynote speech,
which reads as follows: “The draft
resolution’s concept of our advocacy
of and endeavor to chart a peaceful
and democratic and constitutional
road to socialism in America has also
been approved overwhelmingly. The
concept expresses what we Ameri-
can Communists strive for, and is a
further development of our estab-
lished position. It embodies our basic
view, that socialism can be estab-
lished only through a radical and
fundamental extension of American
democracy, and a revolutionary
transformation of all property rela-
tions. And it emphasizes that all
roads to socialism are roads of mass
struggle, waged under the leadership
of the working class and its Marxist
vanguard. But now this concept takes
on new meaning in light of the pro-

117

foundly new and favorable changes
in the world relationships.”

Comrade Chairman: I move the
adoption of these recommendations
by the committee.

C/2.: You have heard the motion.

Is the motion seconded? O.K., we’ll?
now recognize Comrade Blumberg,
and then we’ll vote on the whole’
thing.

Al Blumberg: Comrade Chair-
man and comrades: I have here the
second report from sub-committee
No. 4, which is a unanimous re-
port.

The resolution on social democ-
racy you have in your kit. Your
committee regrets‘ that this resolu-
tion on social democracy reached the
Party too late for the state conven-
tions and the Party generally to dis-
cuss it. We consider this resolution
a major contribution to the central
problems which our Party faces, to
the struggle to overcome our isola-
tion as a Party, from the trade union
movement, from the Negro people’s
movement and struggles, as well as a
tremendous contribution to enhance
the struggle for an anti—monopoly
C03liti0I1 and for socialism.

This resolution examined those
forces in our country which cor-
respond to social democracy. It points
out the tremendous role they play in
the labor movement and the Negro
people’s movement. It considers our
past errors in regard to how we

I18

dealt with the question of social de-
mocracy. What is new especially is
our discussion of certain questions
with regard to which, as a result of
recent developments, our differences
with the social democrats have nar-
rowed. It makes the point, however,
that these differences have not dis-
appeared. On the contrary, many
important ones exist. And yet it calls
for, and points the way toward, co-
operation despite these differences,
based upon an approach which
strives for cooperation with such
groupings and no-t for their liquida-
tion as organizations.

Now this is not to say that the
resolution is the last word. The com-
mittee feels that, in connection with
our work on the Party program,
there will be a need for further ana-
lyzing the role of social democracy
in this country, especially with re-
gard to clarifying the question of
class collaboration, that there must
be a further study and spelling out
of these differences which are nar-
rowing between us and the social
democrats. The motion is that we
endorse the basic ideas of the reso-
lution on social democracy, and ask
that, in editing it, it be strengthened
along the following lines: First, that
it make more clear that the coopera-
tion which we seek is intended, and
will in fact result in the strength-
ening of all participating socialist-
minded forces, and in no sense will

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

result in our seeking to, or in fact
taking them over.

Number two, that in connection
with our errors, the resolution
should expand on some of our posi-
tive experiences as well on this ques-
tion in the late ’thirties.

Number three, that we should
make more clear the need, in con—
nection with this question, for mu-
tual and friendly criticism. And
ﬁnally, as the draft resolution itself
does, this resolution should stress
left-sectarianism as the main danger,
but likewise should indicate the dan-
ger of right—opportunism -in this
movement of cooperation unfold-
ing.

The ﬁnal point in the committee
report is a motion on the question
of the other section of the draft reso-
lution part 3, which Comrade Krch-
marek did not report on. The com-
mittee unanimously recommends
the endorsement of the basic ideas
on the perspective of an eventual
united socialist movement or party.
At the same time the committee
stresses that this section of the reso-
lution will be strengthened if it in-
cludes the following: (I) to make
more clear that the perspective of
an eventual socialist regroupment is
not an immediate perspective, but
must be viewed as the climax of a
series of struggles and develop-
ments, and to make clear that any
so—called “quickie” approach to the

 

  

SESSIONS OF _THE CONVENTION

question of regroupment and social-
ist unity would serve only to Weak-
en our own Party, as well as to dis-
tort its perspective and its achieve-
ments; (2) that we should make
clear that the road to advancing
socialist unity in our country is a
complicated process with many as-
pects, and that, in a general sense,
this road lies through the follow-
ing: it lies through the develop-
ment of joint and parallel action
on the main issues of the day.
Through participation in these strug-
gles will be found the key to strength-
ening the socialist components, the
socialist element, in the developing
anti-monopoly coalition.

Finally, that this road lies through
furthering the process of frank and
full exchange and discussion that
has been developing during the past
year; that this can and will lead to
the clariﬁcation of many questions
of program and outlook, and that
there is a great need for the Party,
at all levels, increasingly to partici-
pate in this process. And in relation
to the resolution, once again, on
social democracy, it will be a very
important aid in furthering this proc-
ess of socialist uniﬁcation.

Your committee moves that these

two motions be accepted by the con-

vention.

Grace (New York): I’d like to dis-
cuss the first motion, on the question
of the American road to socialism.

119

Comrade Foster’s speech yesterday, one
of the things he said that impressed
me was that the revisionist trend in our
Party has presented the peaceful road
to socialism as a mild evolutionary
advance instead of a sharp struggle,
and I believe that there was some
recognition of this in the resolution
as it was presented. I, would still
like to speak against it, because I be-
lieve that it represents a departure
from the Marxist-Leninist theory of the
state and of the dictatorship of the pro
letariat, and of the varied aspects of
the question which the committee it-
self proposed to study further. And
I believe that while we are in the proc-
ess of studying this question ‘further,
and really investigating where we
stand in tenns of our basic principles,
we have no right to adopt such a reso-
lution, which may be actually in oppo
sition to what we decide after further
investigation is our basic principle.
I believe that this emphasis on the
peaceful parliamentary, constitutional,
mild and evolutionary road to socialism
is a projection of our legitimate and
natural desire, which we all have and
which we all share for peaceful transi-
tion, into an unrealistic and very prema-
ture picture of the future relationship
of forces that it is impossible to pre-
dict at this time here in the heart
of world imperialism, and that such
a projection is contrary to all of our
working class experience in the United
States, as well as to our Marxist-Lem
inist theory.

I propose to substitute for this mo-
tion that the section in the draft reso-
lution on pp. 35-36 be removed, and

 

izb

be replaced by a statement that our
Party never has, and does not now,
advocate force and violence, that this
has always come from the ruling class,
here as elsewhere, and must be ex-
pected with increasing intensity from
the imperialists in America, as the
working class and people’s forces ad-
vance in the struggle for socialism.

C/2.: I’ll have to rule that substitute
out of order, because it’s contrary to the
rules adopted by this convention, name-
ly that, inasmuch as there is a com-
mittee report on the ﬂoor, no motion
to the opposite can be made.

A Delegate: I want to speak on the
second part of the second report. I
am very happy that, after all these
years, we are making a serious attempt
to analyze the role of social democracy
in the United States. I have been un-
able to read it so far, but I am sure
it is going to make a contribution,
whether I agree with it or not, if we
start to really pinpoint the question of
social democracy.

I want to address my main remarks,
however, to the question of the mass
party, the future perspective for a mass
socialist movement or, mass socialist
party. In my opinion, the way that is
projected by the reporter for the com-
mittee is by and large correct, and
I’m for that 100 per cent, and if we
would have had the discussion around
this question, instead of the political
association, or any other such muddled
up thing, we would be much further
ahead. We have already passed a mo-
tion to build, strengthen and consoli-
date our Party, but with that, we have
to understand that we need a real

Pkoéiiiibiixiés or 18TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

vanguard movement in this country,
of a mass character, and as time goes
along we have to bend everything we
possibly can, every effort consistent
with the class struggle and traditions
here, to move forward for a mass move-
ment and a mass socialist party in this
country that can really give leadership
to the American workers, and the
phase we’re in, we’re just starting on
this thing, and it is something for the
future, but this is the thing We have to
keep our eye on. (Applause.)

Comrade Dell (California): I want
to say something about the question
of socialist unity; it’s partly our own
experience in a small area, one of the
small counties. It’s probably unique
because of a certain amount of tradi-
tion of struggle around water and
power issues that still contribute to
the liberal tradition in the area. We’ve
had a lot of differences with social
democratic elements in this area for
the past ten years, and some very sharp
conﬂicts with them. Our Party there
has handled these differences fairly
well, and tried to understand how—-
even during all this cold war period
—how we could cooperate. Because
the social democrats, who are of many
different trends in thinking, have ac-
tually been thinking along these same
lines.

They’ve been anti-Communist, and
I’ve been in meetings Where they have
not been vicious, but they have cer-
tainly been red—baiters, knowing I was
there and what my politics were, and
still now, at this time, because of a
development on their part, through
getting into organizations and struggle,

SESSIONS OF - THE CONVENTION I21’.

I feel that their position is certainly
not the same as it was before. As I
say, it may be unique, but as we know
because of——around the United Auto
Workers and Reuther, I don’t know
whether he still considers himself a
socialist but evidently there is some
democratic orientation in the forces
around him; they are moving ahead
on these issues. I have heard this from
a comrade in Michigan. These people
—and we know it from reports—they
are moving ahead on issues.

But what I want to point out par-
ticularly is the fact that, at the present
time, especially in the struggle around
the Negro question, the social demo-
crats have gone out of their way, be-
cause we have been active and have
really done a job, in cooperation with
them as much as we could. They went
out of their way to ﬁnd ways of co-
operating with us. A

AZ (New York): I want to speak
against the report of the sub—commit-
tee. Since in ﬁve minutes you can’t
very well go into the matter very much,
I want to register my point as to why
I am against the report.

I think that in the manner the peace-
ful road to socialism is developed, it’s
nothing but creating illusions. While
we ﬁght for and want the peaceful
road to socialism, there are a number
of conditions which are necessary be-
fore that can be possible—conditions
which can come about only through
the mass revolutionary struggle of the
people of America, led by the working
class, which is led by the vanguard
Party, the Communist Party. And I
think all these talks about studying

the need for more democracy under
socialism than we have now, after
spending a couple of years in jail, I
don’t think we have much democracy,
as personiﬁed in China, the Soviet
Union, and the People’s Democracies.

But the proposals made here smack
to me too much of national commu-
nism, which has nothing in common
with Marxism-Leninism. On the ques-

_tion of social democracy, I think the

effort here is to slur over and obscure
the differences that exist between our-
selves and social democracy. We are
not discussing here what are the possi-
bilities for a united front—that’s one
thing, but no united front is possible
without a clear understanding of what
our differences are. United fronts
come about not by slurring over differ-
ences and hiding them. And one of
the biggest questions is social democ-
racy—biggest differences which we
must make crystal clear—their rabid
anti-Sovietism. And I’m for a united
front with social democracy, but al-
ways making clear that we" are not
social democrats. We have a different
program, and united front is based on
certain common needs which both agree
to while we disagree. So I’m opposed
to that resolution, because I think it
waters down the whole question.
Secondly, on the question of a mass
party of socialism, I think that’s just
pointing to pie in the sky, and will di-
vert, because I think the pre-condition
to that is a centering all of our work
on the rebuilding and the reconstitut-
ing of a Marxist-Leninist Communist
Party of the American working class,
a vanguard party, and when that’s

I22

done, that perspective opens up. I am
not opposed to a mass party of social-
ism, but I am opposed to the way it is
projected because I think it diverts
from the main aim, and only when we
build our Party and begin to do work,
then we can talk about that question.
So I am opposed to the entire report
of the sub-committee. (Applause.)

Sigmund Ez'sen‘.s'clzcr (Wisconsin):
Comrades, I happen to come from Wis-
consin, and I believe that everybody
here knows the reasons why I am par-
ticularly speaking on this subject. Be-
cause if we speak of any place in the
states where this is pertinent, we must
first of all speak about a state which
today even has the prestige of having
a mayor who calls himself a socialist,
and which has been the heart of a vast
movement which had for generations
existed under the banner of socialism.

Now we may have our opinions as to
the character of the program which
constituted the body of theory amongst
these people organized, but the ‘fact is
that these people had committed them-
selves to the name of socialism. It
would seem strange indeed, I think,
if we did not give some thought to
the fact that today in Wisconsin the
socialist movement has all but died
away, that the Socialist Party itself
exists as a sort of a skeleton form, and
that those thousands of people who,
only a few short years ago, had been
banded together actively as an organi-
zation with tremendous inﬂuence in the
state and surrounding states, is a shad-
ow of its former self.

The position that our Party in Wis-
consin has taken is that we regret-—

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

I repeat, we regret the passage of this
vast movement, because it’s my opinion
that, if the Socialist Party in Wiscon-
sin were a live organization, it would
only be because it reflected credit on
the type of activity which that move-
ment would be promoting in behalf of
its policies. But such is not the case.

However-, we are concerned with
those thousands and thousands of peo-
ple who have passed through the door-
ways of the Socialist Party and out
again. And where are they today?
They are still living, most of them;
they haven’t all died away. We are
concerned here at this convention-
our Wisconsin delegation—that we do
not take a position which slams the
doors of our movement in the face
of those people who today, I believe,
can be affected by the type of policy
which our Party can adopt at this
convention. .

I do not think it is in any wise
opportunist for me to say that I favor
the reports both on social democracy
and on peaceful change. Because I be-
lieve that it would be the height of
opportunism to turn our backs upon
these people that we would like to in-
fiuence in the direction of our move-
ment. Because, if we rejected this re-
port, that’s what we would be doing.
I think if it would affect us anywhere
in this country, it would decirnate our
movement in Wisconsin——which has
suffered enough already from this.
(Applause.)

Bill S. (Illinois): I’m terribly sorry
to hear Al speak the way he does be-
cause I think that his position could
lead us to inability to help plow new

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

ground for the propagation and dis-
cussion of socialism in this country.
Al seems to be under the mistaken
impression that the Communist Party
alone will plow that new ground. And
while I believe that the Communist
Party must carry on a ﬁght to re-win
thousands of its own lost members,
and to win new members to its ranks,
and to build and strengthen the Party,
I think that the situation in the coun-

try proves that the CP will not be able '

to do the job of propagating socialism
and discussing socialism on the broad-
est plane by itself. And anyone who
rejects the cooperation, the assistance
and the plowing of ground with new
elements to make this subject a point
for debate throughout the country, it
seems to me is missing the opportu-
nity.

I feel that there will not be a mass
party of socialism tomorrow, or in
the next few years perhaps. Perhaps
there was a big mistake in the original
proposal about a mass party of social-
ism, but that is not what is being
proposed here, and in fact, even the
question of a united party of social-
ism is being projected to this conven-
tion, not as something that will take
place tomorrow, or as something that
will happen automatically, but as a
process for which we will work. How
anyone can oppose that concept is be-
yond me.

It seems to me that there are many
individuals who today would be ready
to speak up for socialism, or to express
the socialist viewpoint on the issues of
the day, and who would do it, not
in the ranks of the CP—they wouldn’t

123

be in the CP—-but they would do it on
the public platform in many parts of
the country. We have that experience
in Chicago. You people, including
myself in Chicago, are meeting and
working with several dozen individuals
who believe that the whole question
of the discussion of socialism should
be brought to the people of Chicago.
Now, We’re not moving mountains.
We’re just making some very, very slow
progress.

We’re working to develop a forum;
we have a discussion group, We’re
meeting new people, We’re ﬁnding
people who say they believe in social-
ism and have never been Trotskyites,
Schachtmanites, members of the CP,
or what have you? They are people
who are honest; they have, in my opin-
ion, confused ideas, and they think
I have confused ideas, but at least
we’re talking together, and I think
that through the people, yes, the hand-
ful that we have gotten together, that
we are going to have a forum; we are
going to bring together three, four,
ﬁve hundred people a month in public
discussion; We’re going to have forty,
ﬁfty, sixty people once a month in dis-
cussion groups; We’re going to meet
other people, and We’re going to be
plowing that ground which will make
socialism a public issue, such as it is
not in Chicago today, and I think
that these tiny efforts are important,
and are written into the resolution,
and they deserve every support of this
convention. (Applause.)

A Delegate (Ohio): Comrades, I’m
for a party of socialism, too, but I’m
against this resolution because it’s not

 

I24

posing here the question of how to
build a broad party of socialism, because
it’s leaving out the whole question of
the people who are going to be respon-
sible for building a broad party of so-
cialism. Where is the pre-requisite for
a broad party of socialism? You have
hundreds of thousands of workers who
have been in both the Socialist and the
Communist Party for a long period of
time. Today these workers in the
shops, factories, mills and mines and
lumber camps of our country, these
workers are experiencing many ques-
tions of the attacks against capitalism,
not from the point of View that they
are trying to build socialism, but from
the point of View that they are trying
to get some common way to live and to
raise their standard of living.

And here you are, instead of throw.-
ing the main emphasis on the working
class, which will be responsible for
building a party of socialism in this
country, you’re talking about making
your main emphasis on trying to or-
ganize all—out the little socialist groups
that exist in the country today—to-
day they are not even leading their
own struggles of the workers that they
are supposed to be responsible for.
The next thing is you’re raising ques-
tions here, in my opinion, which are
eliminating and actually deviating from
the whole policy that you claim to sup-
port, and t.hat’s the question of Marx-
ism—Leninism.

Secondly, I want to finish up by say-
ing this: it is impossible for myself
as a worker, and I’ve worked in all
kinds of industries, to understand how
people can reach such conclusions when

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

you can’t even have a peaceful strike
in this country, much less a peaceful
road to socialism. And here’s the
whole question of the class struggle,
leading up to the proposition of prepar-
ing the working class, and organizing
them behind any kind of a party,
whether it is the Communist Party or
this broad party you’re talking about,
in order to train them what the road
is to socialism——you’re not saying any-
thing about it, not saying anything
about it.

It may be true that these things
sound good to a lot of comrades here,
and I’m quite sure that this is just a
voice hollering in the wilderness. But
I’ll say this and ﬁnish. Anybody in
this country that talks about peaceful
roads to socialism without first deal-
ing with the whole problem and spe-
ciﬁc measures of American capitalism
and its relation to the exploitation of
the working class here, and its whole
rotten robbery of the world today,
where it’s cooperating with the rest of
the imperialist forces to rob all peo-
ples in colonial countries and other
workers, I’ll say what we are really
doing here is degrading and degener-
ating the whole question of Marxism-
Leninism. (Applause.)

Si Gerson (New York): Comrades,
I rise to support the resolution and the
report. It is rather sad that we are dis-
cussing the most profoundly important
question of the Marxist movement at a
late hour in the night, when many
of us are tired. Nevertheless, I feel
that it requires all our attention and
our energies.

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 125

The concept of the American road
to socialism has been maturing in our
movement for the last twenty years,
ever since the 7th World Congress.
It is no new or no legal gimmick, de-
signed to meet any speciﬁc situation.
It is a principled development arising
out of a whole new world situation
and the situation in our country. And
it’s nothing new for the world move-
ment. In 1950, the British comrades
issued their famous pamphlet, The
British Road to Socialism. The very
greeting we got from Togliatti spoke
of the Italian road to socialism, based
on the Italian constitution. The his-
toric decisions of the 20th Congress
of the CPSU spoke about the possi-
bilities of a parliamentary ro-ad to so-
cialism.

Comrade Foster has been quoted
here, but I urge the comrades who
have quoted Comrade Foster to re-
read some of his writings on the
American road to socialism. I speciﬁ-
cally refer to Twilight of World Capi-
talism, published in 1949, his History
of the CPUSA, published in 1952, and
his answers to the Herald-Tribune,
the 23 questions.

The American road to socialism, as
outlined in the draft resolution, does
not refer simply to dropping ballots in a
box. It is a road of titanic economic
and political struggles. The peaceful
road to socialism will not be accom-
plished without the victory of democ-
racy ﬁrst of all in the South, without
winning the right to vote, the right to
organize, the right to strike. These are
going to be titanic struggles. A whole
new body of Congressmen are going

to have to be elected from the South
and elsewhere. This is not a mild,
peaceful, evolutionary thing. This is a
road of struggle. But what it does
state, is that the road of armed insur-
rection, as undertaken in a number of
European countries, and particularly in
the Soviet Union, is not necessarily
our orientation. So that these struggles,
these great economic and political strug-
gles, must be seen as the prerequisite

.for the peaceful road to socialism.

That is encompassed in the report,
and in the draft resolution.

Finally, comrades, the peaceful road
is not a prediction. It reflects our
orientation, and the possibility, given
the gigantic labor movement that we
have in the United States, and par-
ticularly, the tremendous opening up of
democratic possibilities by reason of the
historic Negro people’s movement. This
concept of a peaceful road to socialism
is premised on the development of a
great new political realignment in our
country. That is the prerequisite—an
anti-monopoly coalition. We don’t see
the peaceful road to socialism as simply
emerging out of thin air. It emerges
as a historic process, the great pre-
requisite of which is an anti-monopoly
coalition, which is our ‘strategic aim
for the next period. (Applause.)

Merle (California): I support the
resolution. I think that it is very well
for us to place before us the perspective
of a united party of socialism, of a
mass party of socialism. I think, on
the question of a united party for
socialism, the arguments for it, as pre-
sented in the resolution are suﬂiciently
clear and strong, insofar as. joint. ac-

I26 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

tion, discussion and so forth. As for
a mass party of socialism, I think there
are suﬂicient gaps in the way that the
resolution was presented. For a mass
party of socialism, in the last analysis,
is dependent on the ability of the so-
cialist movement, and first and fore-
most, ourselves, to merge socialist con-
sciousness with the working class move-
ment in this nation. There will not be,
nor can there be, a mass party of so-
cialism, until many thousands of work-
ers become convinced of socialism,
and the need to organize for socialism.
I think, therefore, we must strength-
en this approach, and counteract any
illusions that a mass party of socialism
will come about by mergers or amal-
gamations. We must recognize that a
mass party for socialism—and such a
mass party will be necessary to accom-
plish our objective of a peaceful transi-
tion—will be dependent on our Party’s
revitalizing in a new way the slogan
of turning the face of our Party to the
working class. It will mean that our
Party will have to tackle in a new way
a problem it has never successfully
grappled with——how to become part of
the working class movement, and in
the course of participating in the
struggles of the working class move-
ment, to raise their level of conscious-
ness. It will mean that, in our rela-
tionship with other socialist groupings
we will have to convince them, too,
to turn their face, to join together
in accomplishing a historic task in the
United States, and that is, merging
the socialist consciousness with the
working class movement. That is the
road to a mass party of socialism.

lame: Ford (New York): Comrades,
I must confess, as the Chairman said,
that we are so fatigued that all that I
could do here now is to register my
opposition to both resolutions, and not
to develop it. But I do want to say
that I am particularly opposed to the
resolution on social democracy. With
regard to the question of the peaceful
transition to socialism, well, comrades,
35 years ago, I personally, probably,
without knowledge of Marxism, would
have hailed any news coming out of
the South that the Negro people were
rising up in revolt against their con-
ditions down there, and it might have
been possible in those days, because of
the way the Negroes felt.

But today, I would not hail news
coming from the South that this mag-
niﬁcent struggle of the Negro people
has to resort to force and violence.
I would not hail it because, during these
35 years, there has developed a Com-
munist Party of Marxism-Leninism, a
party that can give proper guidance
to the Negro people and to their allies,
the working class. Nonetheless, one can
not ignore the fact that there is immi-
nent possibility of provocations against
the Negro, and that’s an important
part of the question of force and vio-
lence, of so-called peaceful transition.

What would we do today if tomor-
row we read the papers that there is
provocation against the Negro people.
I’ll let you think about that question,
and not to wave it aside, but you know,
you’ve got to think dynamically about
this question. And as Marxist-Len-
mists, we must. And I am opposed to
this resolution as it is presented now.

 

E

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

On social democracy. Well, com-
rades, again, that resolution can serve
some purpose for study and investiga-
tion, but I don’t think it can serve as
a document for our Party. I think that
we have to consider fundamentally the
role of social democracy. It’s all right,
we can collaborate and go along. But if
we take it historically, we haven’t, and
the resolution doesn’t analyze the role
of social democracy today, for example.

The social democrats in France, the

social democrats in Europe, and their
attitude to the colonial peoples. I say,
comrades, social democracy has to be
studied, within the period that we are
now living, and I agree with Al that
we’ve got to look into this question
of social democracy and know What role
it plays, and study it carefully before
we can adopt this resolution.

Mike Russo (Massachusetts): Com-
rades, I rise in support of the reports
and the resolutions that deal with the
prospect of a peaceful transition to so-
cialism in the United States. For some
time, we have been saying that our
Party is in a profound crisis. So far as
I am concerned, and I am sure that
I speak for many more, whether or
not we emerge from this crisis and take
the path that leads to becoming a mass
party of socialism in the United States
lies along along the lines of a forthright
declaration that the American Commu-
nists will grasp every possible oppor-
tunity to turn these possibilities into a
reality. Any other position, in my
opinion, will lead to oblivion.

Now, what is there new in the pres-
ent situation that makes it possible
for us to adopt this position, and that

127

distinguishes it from the past? Now
it was always true that we aspired to a
peaceful transition, but the new thing
is that today we have the material pos-
sibility of transforming these desires
into practical reality. These are things
that did not exist in the past. More-
over, we are able today, because of the
existence of these practical possibilities,
of bringing our Party, its policy, its
theory, its tactic, its leadership, its meth-

. od of organization, fully into line with

this new central concept that emerges
as a result of the profound develop-
ments that have taken place in this
world.

Those comrades who speak against
this possibility, and do so in the name
of Marxism-Leninism, however sin-
cerely they are motivated, in all hon-
esty are doing violence to Marxism-
Leninism, because it is precisely Marx-
ism and Leninism that teaches us and
tells us that we now have these prac-
tical possibilities. Moreover, no one
suggests that they will be achieved in
the United States on the basis of present
class relationships. In all likelihood,
this will take place at a time when
we will be surrounded by what amounts
to a socialist world. Is there anyone
in this room who will say that this
profound world-wide development will
not have a powerful impact upon the
masses of people in the United States,
and direct them to socialism as an in-
evitable necessity in our country?

Moreover, no one is suggesting that,
because the possibilities exist, they will
automatically become transformed. As
Comrade Si Gerson has said, and as
others have stated, this will not be

achieved spontaneously, or automati-
cally, but only through sharp struggles
waged by the working class of our
country, led by the Marxist—Leninist
vanguard.

Therefore, I want to underscore the
"need for this convention to choose
that course unequivocally, as the course
that can lead to the development of a
mass party of socialism in the United
States. Moreover, the choice of this
course, as I have already indicated, not
-only does not exclude the development
of a broad mass movement and strug-
gle, but this course is based upon the
development of the working class
in the ﬁrst place. Therefore, we do
not see it as a parliamentary develop-
ment, as a legal development, without
any big mass movement. We see the
profound mass movement as the car-
dinal thing which will transform the
legal possibilities and the peaceful pos-
sibilities into the reality and bring
socialism in our country.

ing mimeographing of amended sections.l

MORNING SESSION

February I I, 1957

I Dave Davis (Eastern Penna.) in the
Chair.

Carl Winter: The presiding committee
proposes to re-arrange the order of business
for today in the following manner: that
we hear, as ﬁrst order of business this
morning, the report of the resolutions sub-
committee on trade union work, that we
make a special order of business, no mat-
ter where we may be on any other matter

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

at that time, at 11:30—the report of reso-
lutions sub-committee No. 5 on the Party,
taking into account that this has been
the subject of greatest discussion through-
out our ranks this past several months,
and that this convention must afford the
greatest possible opporttmity for an ex-
change of views and reaching conclusions
on this report as the basis for many other
actions of this convention. That would
mean that we would interrupt the discus-
sion on the trade union committee report
at 11:30, to be resumed whenever this con-
vention decides, at a later time. The plan
is to provide a total of three hours for
all reports, and discussion on the Party.

The second special order to be taken
up at 3:30 covering three matters in the
following order: ﬁrst, the credentials com-
mittee report and seating of delegates;
second, a partial report from a section of
the constitution committee, dealing only
with that portion of the constitution which
will set out the method of election of the
National Committee, so as to provide us
with the rules under which to proceed
to elect. Following immediately after-
wards, the report of the Elections Com-
mittee on procedure and a number of
other details with respect to the new
national committee election. When we have
disposed of these three matters under a
special order of business beginning at
3:30, we will be in a position to return
to the unﬁnished business on the agenda
which we have previously adopted.

I therefore move, on behalf of the pre-
siding committee, these amendments to
our previously accepted agenda. .

York, Maryland, California, New
Jersey, Missouri, Washington, Indi-
ana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Con-
necticut, Ohio. These comrades came
from their shops and local unions
with a variety of opinions based
on their local experiences. In spite
of differing points of view, at the
ﬁnal session the comrades who were
present, some 29 of them, achieved a
unanimous outlook in support of
the material that is being submitted
by the trade union resolutions com-
mittee.

It is my opinion that this trade
union resolution that is being pre-
sented to this convention in its ﬁnal
draft represents a fresh approach to
our problems in the labor move-
ment. It is not a revisionist docu-
ment, and those who believe so
should prove it in this discussion.
It is one, in my opinion, that will
aid our Party to more accurately
deﬁne our past role, more clearly
estimate the labor movement and its
problems today, and establish a ba-
sic policy for developing our tactical

‘ approaches following this conven-

tion, in order to begin to break with
the problem of our isolation.

This trade union resolution was
based on the trade union material
contained in the National Discussion
Bulletin No. 3. This material was
drawn up as the result of wide con-
sultation, with 15o to 200 comrades
in industry throughout the country.

However, the original material suf-
fered from the fact that, in the pre-
convention discussion, it did not re-
ceive the attention that it deserved,
since the comrades were discussing
what they considered the more de-
cisive problems of the moment. As a
result, when the committee came to-
gether, it was for the ﬁrst time able
to gather the important and valuable

. views of many of our shop comrades

on the resolution. All comrades were
not satisﬁed with the limited time
for discussion, and would have liked
to go much deeper into an examina-
tion of our detailed problems in in-
dustry. As a result of this, some
comrades felt that the resolution was
inadequate, in that it did not present
a more speciﬁc plan of work for us
in industry. We all agree that such a
speciﬁc plan of work is necessary,
and the suggestion was made in the
committee that we hold national and
regional industrial conferences fol-
lowing this convention in order to
draw up such a plan of work.

This resolution which we are sub-
mitting today, with the additions
which you will receive, is based on
the general line of our draft resolu-
tion, and will, in my opinion and in
the opinion of the comrades, pro-
vide a proper political basis for work-
ing out such a plan.

Now, what is the intent, and what
is new in this trade union resolu-
tion? First, that the AFL-CIO mer-

 

130 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

ger has brought a new quality to
the labor movement, that it is play-
ing a greater role in the life of our
country. At the same time, there are
no illusions in the minds of anyone
that there are not continuing diﬂi-
culties and problems. The AFL—CIO
is facing increasing difficulties at
the hands of growing powerful mo-
nopolies. This is most clearly seen
by the workers on the job, who feel
it on their backs. And herein lies
a very fundamental contradiction,
that must be resolved by the labor
movement, with our aid, in the next
period of time, and that is that these
unions which have at times demon-
strated their increased strength and
power nationally, are more often than
not characterized by an absence of
strength at the shop level in rela-
tion to on the job grievances and
struggles.

A highly institutionalized appara-
tus has been developed, which more
and more tends to exclude rank and
ﬁle participation. This is as a result
of the three—year contracts, the long
grievance procedures and so on. We
Communists, who have consistently
been the best ﬁghters for trade un-
ion democracy, must in this coming
period help the workers to under-
stand that the ab-ility to win new
victories will be determined, to a
considerable extent, in direct rela-
tionship to the participation of the
workers themselves. As a matter of

fact, the future of labor struggles
hangs in the balance, and they will
be difficult ones.

A whole set of new problems is im-
posed upon the labor movement by
the very facts of life. Among these,
as our resolution describes, is the
question of the struggle for further
trade union unity, the organization
of the unorganized, and particu-
larly in the South, the need for the
shorter work week as a result of
growing automation in the plants,
the need to extend the alliances of
labor with other sections of the peo-
ple, the need for greater independent
political activity on the part of the
labor management. Thirdly, our
resolution takes note of the debate
that’s going on on the question of
peace and foreign policy in the labor
movement, one which we have to
give serious consideration to, and
not be blinded by the anti-Sovietism
of a George Meany or any other
leader in the labor movement-
George Meany, for example, who
just had to step down from the in-
ternational affairs committee of the
AFL—CIO because there is no una-
nimity in support of his policy.

Now, these are not questions
which we have determined are
the ones which the labor movement
must take up in the next period of
time. These are questions which
are already being discussed and in

part being acted upon by sections

of the labor movement. But we
should take note of the fact that
these are also questions with which
we have concerned ourselves, and
thereby, we have a better estimate of
the progress and the motion ahead
that is taking place in this labor
movement, insofar as they are al-
ready beginning to grapple with a
whole series of questions which we
know are extremely important and
decisive in relation to the future
struggles of labor and the nation as
a Whole.

What we can modestly contribute
is not only a shoulder-to—shoulder
ﬁght for these objectives, but to help
to give consciousness, purpose, di-
rection to these struggles, so that the
struggles of labor around these par-
ticular questions can more rapidly
permit it to play its role in a develop-
ing anti—monopoly coalition in this
country.

This resolution brieﬂy examines
the contributions of our Party as well
as the errors over the last decade. It
is our opinion that, despite the highly
important and historic contributions
over the last period, we have com-
mitted gross sectarian errors that
have increased our isolation. These
were real errors, not imaginary-—
policy errors as well as tactical. The
main responsibility for these errors
rests with the national leadership of
our Party. These errors included an
exaggeration of the strength of the

Left in the labor movement, follow-

ing World War II, a failure to recog— T

nize the serious objective conditions,
the severity of the attack on the Left,
and the need to modify our approach
to cope with the situation, the failure
to see the split that was being en-
gineered in the CIO from ’46 on,
and to over—exert ourselves, when it
_was still possible, prior to ’49, to
avoid it.

Our weakness on the whole ques-
tion of organic unity, particularly
after 1952, kept our Party, the
traditional and most forceful pro-
ponent of unity of labor, from play-
ing its full role on this question.
Experiences from comrades in shops
show that in the last period we have
begun to struggle to overcome these
errors, and some limited progress
has been made. However, there is a
continuing gap between the integra—
tion of individual Communists in the
life of the unions, and the continu-
ing isolation of our Party. There is
a need for an even more detailed
examination of these questions,
among which we have to determine,
much more seriously than we have
in the past, to overcome the lack of
attention to the work of our Party
and its activities at the shop level.
This must be corrected.

One of the most important sections
of the trade union resolution is its
examination of trends and currents
in the trade union movement. The

 

I32 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

approach of this resolution clashes
sharply with our past viewpoint on
this question. This is as it should be,
for many of the rigid approaches of
the past hindered the struggle for a
correct united front policy in the

ranks of labor.
What is the approach of this trade

union resolution? It is our opinion
that the time calls for fresh initiative
and bold perspective. There have
been changes and shifts in the world,
in our country and in labor which
require new analysis and fresh judg-

‘ments. Despite the opinions of some

comrades that the merger could only
result in a reactionary combination
ﬁrmly ﬁxing itself on the workers,
events have shown quite the oppo-
site. What we have seen since the
merger, in spite of all the continuing
problems, is that there is sharp con-
flict in the ranks of the trade union
leadership.

What is new and What is neces-
sary, in our opinion, for valid judg-
ment, is to see that there is a great
deal of ﬂuidity in the labor move-
ment at the present time. The trade
union leadership does not line itself
up in the same fashion on all indi-
vidual questions of struggle. This is
what is characteristic today. There
is no ﬁrm and ﬁxed division; the
chips have not all fallen on this ques-
tion. While this is true, there are
certain general trends that are be-

ginning to shape up in the labor
movement.

Our resolution points out that
there is a general relatively more
progressive trend that is developing
around the former CIO unions and
some unions of the AFL, that there
is a more conservative and in some
instances reactionary trend that is
developing particularly around the
building trades and the teamsters
union, but while the beginnings of
these trends are apparent, what is
clear is that all ﬁrm and hard divi-
sions as yet have not developed.
This is extremely important, because
here lies the signiﬁcance and the im-
portance of the intervention of the
millions of workers themselves in
helping to determine the policies
within the labor movement.

Now, we are going to be able to
take this question in a fresh way,
in our opinion, if we will begin to
free ourselves from some of the rigid
characterizations of the leadership
of the labor movement of the p-ast
period. And I am referring to the
characterizations of “left,” “right”
and “center.” In no way attempting
to pass judgment on the validity of
these concepts in past years, it is the
opinion of this committee that at the
present time the continuing use of
these old labels in no way accurately
helps us to deﬁne various conﬂicts
and differences which exist in the
ranks of the labor movement. More

than that, it was the opinion of many
comrades in this committee that
what we should be discussing is not
the characterization and pigeonhol-
ing of individuals but rather the
characterization of trends in the la-
bor movement, for individuals shift
and change as they have over the last
many decades in the labor move-

ment. One who may have been called‘

a Left, a number of years ago, today
certainly is playing a most reaction-
ary role in the labor movement, as
for example, Iohn L. Lewis. So the
labeling of individuals implies
nothing in terms of a knowledge of
what is going on, and what changes
have taken place; more than that, it
is our opinion that it tends to inhibit
the ability to unfold the widest unit-
ed front policy around struggles on
individual issues within the labor
movement.

We feel that the outlook of the
draft resolution, the question of the
ﬁght for an anti—monopoly coalition,
the ﬁght for working class unity in
the struggle against the monopolies,
this concept which is embodied in
the draft resolution should apply in
relation to the labor movement, and
that is the struggle for all—embracing
unity on speciﬁc issues of struggle,
and where individuals stand in rela-
tion to these issues, we will be able
to characterize the role of the indi-
vidual trade union leader. But to
pigeonhole him in advance, to make

a pre—judgment as to where he must
inevitably stand means, in our opin-
ion, to substitute general historic
truths for the practical problems in
the labor movement that we face to-
day, and this kind of substitution of
general truths for tactical solutions
has been a curse upon our Party in
the struggle in the labor movement
for many years of the past.

I think that on this question of a
fresh approach to these trends that
exist within the labor movement,
our resolution has given us some-
thing which will free our hands in
the struggles in the labor movement
in the next period of time. There are
no illusions contained here on the
characters of the various trade union
leaders. It is not, in our opinion, the
decisive question at this moment that
we continually repeat that these la-
bor leaders are staunch defenders of
capitalism. That they are, and
nobody denies that. But we also rec-
ognize that, in a labor movement
that has been organized today, these
same labor leaders also have the
problem of the pressure from, and
the responsibility to, their own mem-
bers; and there are conflicting ten-
dencies among these labor leaders,
which the rank and ﬁle can take ad-
vantage of in the form of greater
pressure and struggle against the
monopolies, and thereby help to re-
solve some of the contradictions in

I 34 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the thinking of the labor leaders
themselves.

The last section of this resolution
deals with the question of the rela-
tionship of the Party to the labor
movement. It deals with the ques-
tion, among others, of our class strug-
gle viewpoint as against the question
of class collaboration. However, the
resolution makes one additional
point that we have not made in our
documents prior to this, and that is:
not only do we take our stand on
the question of class struggle as
against class collaboration, but also
we put forward the outlook of unity
of all those who are willing to par-
ticipate in the struggles of labor,
whether they support the idea of
class collaboration or class struggle,
unity of all forces in the labor move-
ment who claim that they are on la-
bor’s side in the struggle on indivi-
dual issues. We take note of the his-
torical role of the socialist forces in
the trade union movement in the
past, and that this will undoubtedly
and must continue in the future.

Finally, you have before you now
a whole series of additions to this
resolution. Just to make the follow-
ing point, the additions include the
following questions: ﬁrst, an enlarge-
ment of the trade union resolution
on racketeering, which is inclusive
of the question of the recent policy
statement of the Ethical Practices
Committee of the AFL-CIO, as well

as the contributions of our Party
in the struggle for trade union de-
mocracy. Second, the additions in-
clude more on the role of monopoly
and its attack on the conditions of
the workers. Third, additional mate-
rial to describe the struggle of the
workers in the shop, the economic
struggles and the fears of insecurity.
Fourth, an additional section on the
question of legislative activity of la-
bor. In addition, it places more
sharply the relationship between the
trade union struggle and the ﬁght
to develop socialist consciousness
among the workers. There is more
on the question of upgrading and
the ﬁght for Negro leadership, and
so on. A whole series of additions
have been made which, in our opin-
ion, strengthened this trade union
resolution.

In conclusion, comrades, this reso-
lution, in our opinion, and this whole
field of discussion has not been
adequately handled in our Party in
the course of this pre—convention dis-
cussion. Our Party is a working class
Party, but the trade union material
and the detailed discussion of the
problems of our comrades in indus-
try has not been characteristic of the
discussion in our Party up to now.
Our committee proposes that, in
initiating this discussion today, we
once again reassert and reaflirm the
fact that our Party is a party of the
working class, and that we continue

in a more detailed fashion to seek
out the answers that are necessary to
break with our isolation in the labor
movement. (Applause.)

(.71.: The Chair has before it a request
of Comrade Foster to speak on this issue,
and he intends to present some basic ideas,
and he feels that he would need approx-
imately some 12 minutes. What is your
pleasure? It has been regularly moved and
seconded that Comrade Foster be given
the time of 12 minutes. [Vote taken] So
ordered.

/1 Delegate (Ohio): I’d like to speak
in favor of the resolution. There have
been considerable differences of opinion
over this resolution, and they were ex-
pressed at the committee meeting. I
feel that these differences arise out of
the particular problems our Party is
faced with in trade union work. We
have seen, since the establishment of
industrial unionism in this country, a
considerable growth in the strength
and size of the trade union movement,
though we have seen no corresponding
growth in the socialist consciousness
of the organized workers. This has
resulted in a relative decline in the
strength and inﬂuence of our Party in
the trade union movement. We are
faced with the task of trying to in-
crease our strength, overcome our iso-
lation, in this situation.

I think we should proceed from
the basic class outlook that the basic
struggle in the trade union movement
is the ideological struggle between so-
cialist and capitalist ideology. The
union reflection of this is the conflict
between class struggle and class col-
laborationist ideology. However, in to-

 

3:. 1;._,__

 

   
 

day’s labor movement, there are many
struggles and movements going on
which are not direct expressions of this
basic conflict. On the contrary. Strong
groups of organized socialist conscious
workers are practically non-existent. So
we have the question, then, what do
these movements and activities which
we see going on in the trade union
movement consist of? To my mind,
some of them are expressions of Left
trends, Right trends, and so on, but for
the most part, they represent differences
of opinion in the trade union leader-
ship, conflict over questions which do
not directly relate themselves to strug-
gles over class collaboration or class
struggle ideology.

The question of Left-progressive,
Center and Right groups enters into
this question. To my mind, throughout
the ’twenties and ’thirties, Left-progres-
sive groups, Center groups and Right
groups were clearly deﬁned in the labor
movement, because they were crystal-
lized in the process of some thirty years
of struggle for certain key tasks: the or-
ganization of the unorganized and the
building of industrial unionism. To-
day, however, some ﬁfteen or twenty
years later, the labor movement is
faced with new tasks which, as yet,
have not brought about such a sharp,
clearly defined crystallization of forces,
with the result that Left—progressives,
Center and Right groupings in the
trade union movement have become
considerably disintegrated, the picture is
not quite as clear, and therefore, we
face considerable confusion in regard
to this question. Without saying much
more, I would just say that I think that

the draft resolution ‘is correct in

  

   

 

136 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

stressing the need for greater ﬂexibility
in application of united front policies,
of seeking out new forms of building
coalitions, with all groups in the labor
movement, all trends, all outlooks, and
at the same time, undertaking to build,
to strengthen, the Left trend, within the
framework of the complex situation
which cannot be deﬁned as simply and
as clearly as it was back in the ’twenties
and the ’thirties. _ .

Wm. Z. Foster: I want to speak on
just one question. That is this matter
of the left-center bloc. I think our res-
olution needs a lot of strengthening in
this respect.

Now, we’ve got to recognize the
fact clearly that there are generally
three currents in the labor movement:
conservative, progressive and Left, or
Right, Left and Center, as we often re-
fer to it. Now, this is not only in our
trade union movement, it’s in every
trade union movement. In every polit-
ical party in the capitalist world, you’ll
ﬁnd these three currents. You’ll even
ﬁnd them in the Communist Party of
the United States——Right, Left and
Center, as we have seen in this con-
VCI'lt10Il.

Now, comrades, our job is not to
ignore such a great reality as this. Our
job is to analyze these currents and take
a certain position towards them. Now
I don’t have any argument with com-
rades who speak about the ﬂexibility
and the ﬂuidity of these currents-they
are. The personnel changes around
various issues and so on, but by and
large, these three great currents exist
in all countries. Even in the Republican
Party, the Democratic Party—you

couldn’t name any political organiza-
tion that doesn’t have these three broad
currents.

Now our Party in the past has made
many mistakes, of course, over the
years, but we never had frozen, rigid
ideas of these currents; even in the
most left-sectarian days, our Party al-
ways saw the ﬂuidity and was always
ready to change its line to a certain ex-
tent to meet these changes.

Now, comrades, the question of these
currents—our Party traditionally has
followed a policy of working with the
progressive group, or the so-called mid-
dle group, in the trade unions. Now
that has been for the purpose of what?
Of developing the full strength of the
labor movement. And this combination,
if we look into the history of it, was
always ready to work with anybody
who was following a progressive line,
no matter what his previous record
had been. And I want to say this, com-
rades, and you must pay special atten-
tion to this fact, this policy we’ve never
discussed much, but this Left-center
bloc policy was the main policy of the
Communist Party since it was born,
among the masses. Not only that, but
this was the policy that we build the
Communist Party on—this Leftcenter
bloc—and that’s how important that
is. This policy is not to be just thrown
away, just off-hand. If we’re going to
discard this policy that has played such
a tremendous role in our Party life, we
had better examine the question pretty
carefully.

Now, it was this policy of the Left-
center bloc that broke our Party’s isola-
tion in the first place. It taught our

to

eft-

our

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 137

Party not to be against leaders in gen-
eral, but to work with the constructive
forces in the labor movement, and this
policy linked us with progressives gen-
erally, and broke the isolation of the
Communist Party in this country. And
we can’t just discard a policy of this
character.

I just want to say a few words about
the historical role of this policy. Even
before our Party was established, this
policy began to take shape in the Left
forces. For example, it was on the
basis of a bloc between the Left forces
such as they existed at the time and the
leaders of the Chicago Federation of
Labor and all that that involved which
carried national implications with it,
that organized the packing industry of
this country. It was the same Left-cen-
ter bloc that organized the steel indus-
try. That wasn’t just the Left who did
it, that was a Left-center bloc. It was
also, when our Party came into exist-
ence, after its first year or so of deep
isolation, it took up this policy.

I tell you, with this policy of the
Left and the center cooperating to-
gether, almost instantly our Party be-
came a national factor in this country
in the labor party movement. It was
the same policy that was the basis for
the spectacular successes of the TUEL
in its first year. And we had many
other examples of this policy in opera-
tion as the years went by. Strikes, elec-
tion campaigns in various unions——for
instance, in the miners’ union, the left
and the progressive forces at that time
in opposition to Lewis, we carried on a
left-center election campaign of the
United Mine Workers that had as its

candidates three district presidents of
the UMW then, and we defeated Iohn
L. Lewis in his own union with this
kind of a combination. This is what
we get with this policy. Let’s not throw
this policy overboard so quickly.

Well, then came the period of the
building of the CIO. Now, something
very important happened with this
policy at that time. We proceeded with
the policy, along about 1935, to ex-
pand it to take in active cooperation
with men that previously we’d been
ﬁghting-—]ohn L. Lewis, Dubinsky
and all the rest of them, in the found-
ing of the CIO. And for fourteen years,
our Party carried out this policy of
Left-center collaboration, or the Left-
progressive is what we called it at the
time, in the CIO, and that policy was
spectacularly successful, comrades. We
built our Party with it! Built the CIO
with it as well; certainly we played a
very important part. And the basis of
it was Left-center collaboration! That
was the foundation of our policy.

Now we have had two breaks in this
policy since our Party began it about
1921. One break was in 1923, when
we split with the middle group over
the Labor Party issue. That was our
fault, the fault of the Communist
Party——a mistake, and it led to one of
the most severe isolation periods that
our Party has ever faced. Now we had
another break with the middle forces,
that was in 1949, and that Was not our
mistake. In spite of all of these hints
that we were responsible for that
break, we were not responsible for the
break in 1949, and we did what we
could do avoid it.- And to state our

138

position at the present time, in a cer-
tain sense it is that we have broken
with these progressive elements. That’s
really the problem that we confront!
We have broken our connections with
these progressive elements and this
carries with it a large measure of isola-
tion in the labor movement. And our
problems in the trade unions can be
stated in the same sense, that our
main task at this time is to re—estab-
lish our contacts with these progressive
elements in the labor movement—our
natural allies are these progressives-
and that’s our big job, to develop work-
ing contacts with them.

Now, is this a sectarian policy?
Well, the history of it shows that it
isn’t. But let me give you a couple of
examples. We Worked not only with
these middle groups, but every reac-
tionary or conservative who showed
the slightest tendency toward any pro-
gress, our Party showed a willingness
to work with them. Let me give you
just three examples. First, in support
of Roosevelt. We worked with these
conservative elements in support of
Roosevelt. We worked with the con-
servative elements at the head of the
AFL in World War II. We worked
concretely with these elements in sup-
port of the no-strike plan, for example.
And the whole history of this policy
has been a Willingness to cooperate
with these conservative elements. We
must not consider the American trade
union movement as just some sort of
an amorphous mass. It is not. It has
these distinct currents. And our job
at this particular time is to study these
currents, and to re—establish our align-

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

ment with the more progressive forces
which, in my opinion, at the present
time are pretty much the CIO forces
in the labor movement. These are the
people we have got to consciously work
with. We cannot have a vague,
amorphous problem that ignores these
natural divisions in the movement and
tries to bridge them over. Do you
know what that means for our Party?
I’ll tell you what it would mean. If
we have a “Left” orientation, that could
mean isolation. That could line us up
against oﬂicials in general, and all
forces that are not of the Left. I don’t
think we're going to make that mis-
take. Or, if we have a Right orienta-
tion, or a tendency in that way, it
could cause us to tail after the leaders
of the American Federation of Labor
with practically no line of opposition
to them. Well, I hope we don’t make
that mistake. Comrades, we have got
to work out in our resolutions a much
more deﬁnite analysis of the labor
movement, and much more alignment
with these progressive forces than has
been indicated in our resolutions. (Ap-
plause.)

A Delegate (Pemzsylvania): I’m
from Pennsylvania. I want to address
myself to the question of the Negro
i.n the shops and in the trade unions.
How can we raise the question of trade
union unity without the integration of
the two and a half million organized
Negroes in the trade union movement?
They are part of one of these currents.
The status of the Negro in the shop
and in the trade unions is one of sec-
ond-class citizenship in the main, and

in particular in the basic industries,
in steel. The Negro workers there have
organized themselves into caucus
movements in some places with a pret-
ty high degree of organization. This
movement is growing and expanding
constantly.

These Negro workers have organiza-
tional. experience. They are members
outside of their place of work in the
fraternal organizations, they are leaders
here in the churches, and in the general
Negro rights, they play a role; they
have many ties and connections. The
Negro caucus movement is strongest,
I think, in Pittsburgh, in District 15,
where you have a movement there-—
an organization known as the “Fair
Share” group. They are supporting an
Indiana Negro for International Teller
who is running on a program of anti-
dues increase and Negro rights. This
“Fair Share” group is also—they
haven’t come out with it yet-—but the
trend is to support McDonald. But
the main question is the question of
democratization within the union, and
on the job. Chester, Wilmington,
Delaware, Baltimore and Houston,
Tex., are other centers.

The program of this movement is
this: to get Negroes to attend local
meetings, to bring democracy into the
union and equality on the job. Now
these Negro workers going into the 10-
cals and taking a role will certainly
bring greater democracy to the unions.
The trade union movement as yet has
not spoken out sharply enough on the
question of the South. The bringing
of these Negro workers and the role
they can play and greater democracy

into the trade unions will certainly
strengthen this question and make for
a stronger position and greater unity
within the trade union movement itself,
and therefore, it will strengthen the
ﬁght in the South, and bring democ-
racy all over the country to a greater
degree.

In this connection it just has to be
spelled out and elaborated on in the
resolution on the trade union ques-
tion, and in the resolution on the Ne-
gro question.

[Some discussion about delegates
getting the ﬂoor.]

Ch.: The Chair has received com-
plaints from the delegates. They claim
that some delegates seem to be speak-
ing on every issue without rotating the
discussion. No personal implications
meant, or anything of that sort. I can-
not deprive anyone from speaking. I
have no such authority. I can only ap-
peal to the conscience of the individual
comrades to use their best sense and
judgment. I wanted to make this per-
fectly clear because the comrades com-
plain as though we run this situation
from the Chair. You determine the
situation, not us.

Iamer Ford (New York): I don't
want to take the time of this conven-
tion, and no special privileges in this
convention. I. don’t have to make my
protestations here about the endorse-
ment of this resolution, and I Won’t
waste any time with it. I am for the
resolution, and I am for the historical
role that our Party has played in the
labor movement of this country. I
wanted to direct my remarks to one
point made by the reporter, Comrade

140

Simon. He said that we should not be
blinded by anti-Soviet attack by the
oﬂicials of the trade union movement.
Now, I don’t have to analyze all the
questions as to how do we deal with
this thing, but I think that it would
be a disastrous policy if we took that
literally, and just closed our eyes to
the attack of this trade union official-
dom upon the Soviet Union. This is
one of greatest issues in the world to-
day—the Soviet Union. And when we
see these guys—I don’t care who they
are—if we can’t ﬁnd a way to clarify
this issue without breaking up any
sort of a unity, we are not performing
our task in the trade union movement.
When Meany or anybody else goes
around attacking the Soviet Union, we
have got to show it to the Working
class, because when they attack the So-
viet Union, they attack the colonial re-
volutionary movement, and hold back
the development of the Negroes in the
trade union movement of our country.
The two go together. Attacks on the
Soviet Union and attacks on the Negro
people. That’s what I want to say.

And we can take the example of the
Labor Party of England. When the
Soviet delegation, who went there with
the honest intention to establish eco-
nomic relations, they get up with some
damn fool idea of attacking the Soviet
Union. The Soviet Union attacked
them back, and we have got to do that,
too.

Secondly, I want to agree with this
idea advanced by Comrade Foster in
another sense about the Left-center. If
it had not been for the Left—center, and
for the policy of our organization in

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the 192o’s, the Negro workers would
never have been brought into this trade
union movement. That policy of our
organization, based on the Marxist
conception, as I stated last night, work-
ers in the white skins are not eman-
cipated as long as workers in the black
skin are branded. And from that
elementary Marxist principle, we at-
tracted the Negro workers to the trade
unions, and today there are two mil-
lion, thanks to the Communist Party
and to our white workers who under-
stood this slogan and brought it to a
high level, to make the white workers
see that their interests were involved
by bringing the Negroes in, that they
could not be emancipated without the
Negroes. And I’ll tell you today-—
Townsend (unfortunately the late
Townsend is dead) but Townsend and
Randolph are the presidents of AFL
and CIO unions, today, primarily be-
cause of the work of our Communist
Party in the early periods in ﬁghting
for the rights of the Negroes, and these
so-called caucus groups of the Negroes
were responsible for that. We cannot
ignore this question.

And I would say, if a personal refer-
ence here—and I don’t mean it that
way—in I926, thirty years ago in the
Chicago Federation of Labor, if it had
not been for the lefts in there, when
these scoundrels—and I use that word
advisedly—wanted to throw me out of
a window in the Chicago Federation
of Labor, it was the left trade union
leaders that came to my defense and
attracted the interest of the Negro
workers of Chicago. That’s the role
our Party has got to play, but I admit,

 

 

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 141

on a higher level today.

Bernie (New York): I first would
like to say that the connotations of
right, left and center in the Commu-
nist Party are being used today loosely
for identiﬁcation purposes only. His-
tory will yet determine whether it was
the right, left or center—whether the
so-called right is in fact correct, and
what we are dealing with is a left and
a super-left. I want to say, first of all,
that I support the trade union resolu-
tion, even though I consider that it is
inadequate on a number of points.
One of the inadequacies is in relation
to past errors. Where the resolution
speaks, in fact, that where ruptures be-
tween the left and the center were
probable, we tended to make them
inevitable. Now, most people at this
convention of the Party are ardent
proponents of left-center unity. That is
not the problem. The problem is What
steps does the left take to maintain
the left-center unity, under any and
all conditions. And if we probe this
question, we will see that we were
greatly lacking in ﬁghting for left-
center unity. In the first place, it seems
to me that, under certain conditions,
the left must go out of its Way to help
new center forces to emerge. In the
second place, left-center unity contains
within it also a relationship of who
holds the 1eadership—the left, or the
center? Now we have had examples,
both prior to the expulsion from CIO,
and in more recent days, which indi-
cate that, within at least one major
union in this country, where prior to
1949, the left was willing to let leader-
ship pass into the hands of the center,

the left-center coalition was maintained,
that union stayed in CIO, and the
left, as a result, was not only able to
maintain, but to strengthen, its base to
this very day.

Secondly, after the expulsion from
the CIO, and in more recent days, we
have seen that where we have permit-
ted leadership to pass to new forms
of center, which I do not Want to elabo-
rate on this floor, it was possible to re-
establish unity, and to maintain the
left-center coalition within which
framework the left was able to main-
tain and strengthen its base at this
very moment. From that point of view,
I consider that the resolution is
inadequate in dealing with our past
errors, in that it does not probe our
weaknesses in the maintenance of that
left-center unity, which we all espouse.

Secondly, I consider the resolution
inadequate on the question of legaliz-
ing socialism in the trade union move-
ment. It is not enough to speak of the
so-called low level of socialist consci-
ousness in the labor movement; it is
necessary to speak of how to change
that situation. Now, for my part, I was
greatly heartened by Comrade Dennis
in April when he launched the slogan
of a united party of socialism, even
though I knew it was not on the im-
mediate order of the day. I am some-
what dismayed that Comrade Dennis,
in his remarks to this convention, made
no mention of that slogan. I am more
dismayed that Comrade Foster lumps
that slogan in a loose category of right
opportunist, liquidationist proposals.

Comrade Dennis will explain for
himself what his attitude is on the

 

142 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

slogan he issued in April, but I want
to say I support that slogan, and if our
Party would adopt that position, I know
in one industry, not to speak of others,

where, working properly in the next_

years, it would be possible to make an
organization—a socialist organization
—of at least two or three thousand
members, instead of the forty that we
now have.

From this point of view, from the
point of view thatthe delegates at the
subcommittee all raised the question
of how do we legalize socialism, I con-
sider that the resolution is inadequate
in that it doesn’t even begin to answer
this question. (Applause.)

Manny Blum (Indiana): I would like
to express my agreement with the report
of the Trade Union committee. I think
this report gives us a basis for going
back with a policy through the appli-
cation of which we can move forward._
There were many comrades—the 29
comrades, including shop comrades, on
the committee, which worked on this
resolution, which had various differ-
ences, as now indicated. In spite of
reservations, this was an adequate
presentation of a Marxist-Leninist ap-
proach to the trade union movement at
this particular time. And I think, in
the light of all the discussion about a
possible split, in the light of wrangling
on parliamentary questions on this
ﬂoor, that is the decisive question that
comes out of this convention.

On the question of left, right and
center, I agree with Comrade Foster
that this has been a basic policy in the
history of the American labor move-
ment. I agree with him also that we

have to analyze the various currents at
a particular time. But it seems to me
that what this resolution says is that
the lines of right, left and center have
not crystallized at this particular mo-
ment in American labor history. For
example, Comrade Foster refers to the
fact that, in 1936, Lewis became the
decisive factor in the center, whereas,
just before that, had we determined,
without looking at life and its develop-
ment, that Lewis was to the right, and
rigidly adhered to that position, we
would have had no left-center coalition.
And it seems to me that this is the
key to the situation. You’ve got to ex-
amine the main issues confronting the
working class at a given moment in
history, and on that basis, determine
what is the relationship of forces and
where these forces stand. And it seems
to me that, at this moment, on the
main questions of peace and civil rights,
various forces are in flux, positions are
being taken, shifts are under way, the
left itself is far from crystallized, and
this resolution says simply that we
must free ourselves from the frozen
geography of right, left and center,
and re-exarnine this question.

We know, for example, that on the
peace question the American labor
movement—certain sections of it—are
examining aspects of peaceful coexist-
ence, but a position has not yet crystal-
lized. I think, in this connection, the
section on page 5 of the resolution in-
dicates a very important feature of this.
It says lines have not fully hardened
—-that means that there is a crystal-
lization taking place, although certain
general tendencies seem

apparent.

 

 

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 143

Around most of the former CIO un-
ions, and some of the AFL, there is
developing a relatively more positive
and militant perspective. And Comrade
Foster says it is particularly around
the CIO that a center will develop. I
don’t think there’s a contradiction
there. I think it’s a question of watch-
ing life, and as trends become more
crystallized, we take a clearer position
as life takes that clearer position.

Hal did not read that section of the
resolution which is not before you
which deﬁnes a developing left trend
in the American labor movement and
says that there will be a revitalized left.
And for that reason, I associate myself
with the general remarks of Comrade
Foster, and with the resolution.

C/1.: Comrades, we are now ready
to proceed with the special order of
business, the report of the Resolu-
tions Sub-Committee No. 5 on “the
Party.” The Chair recognizes Com-
rade Schneiderman of California.

Wm. Sc/meidermlan (California):
Comrades, I am reporting for the
committee which is dealing with part
4 of the resolution on the Party. That
section of the resolution which runs
from page 40 to page 59, with the
exception of the section on labor and
Negro struggles, which was taken
out and handled by other commit-
tees (the section running from page
46 to 52). We deal with the section
on the Party up to the point on con-
cepts of Party organization, which
was also handled by another com-

mittee——the constitution committee.

The discussion in our committee
was limited to three main subjects,
and we have divided our reports ac-
cordingly. They will be given separ-
ately to the convention.

First, on the nature of the errors;
secondly, on our approach to our
theory; and thirdly, our relations
with other Marxist parties. This re-
port will deal only with the section
dealing with the nature of the errors,
and the other two reports will fol-
low.

Our committee had a total of some
sixteen hours of discussion, and this
report will speak for a majority of
the committee, and will be followed
by a minority report. It is no acci-
dent that this section of the resolu-
tion has had the most intense discus-
sion in the Party. The Party mem-
bership rightly felt that in it was a
key question which determined all
others. Therefore, when most state
conventions voted on the line or the
direction of the resolution, and when
they were voting to endorse, or to
greet, or in some other way support
the purposes and concepts of the re-
solution, they were voting especially
on the underlying concepts of this
section of the resolution on the
Party.

These, of course, have been the
issues of sharpest controversy and
debate in the Party, in the various
conventions, and naturally became

 

 

I44 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the subject for the sharpest divisions
in our committee. And though we
strove to bring about a uniﬁed re-
port, and if possible, a unanimous
report, it was clear that these dif-
ferences were not over this or that
phrase, were not over some better
way to state the thing, but primarily
this sharp division of views dealt
with the line and the content of what
this discussion is all about.

The key paragraphs are the para—
graphs that deal with the nature of
the errors, on p. 53 of the resolution,
which states: “The most important
mistakes made in the period under
review were left sectarian in charac-
ter. These left sectarian mistakes are
the main reason for the unprece-
dented degree for which it is possible
for big business and its political
representatives to isolate the Party.
To end this isolation and expand its
mass work, the main task of the
Party today is to overcome com-
pletely the inﬂuence of left sectarian
estimates, policies and tactics in all
ﬁelds of work. In the process of car-
rying out the main task, the Party
must increase its vigilance against
right opportunist tendencies, com-
batting them at all times. This is
especially necessary in view of the
extremely sharp turn which the Party
is now making in many of its basic
policies. The necessary struggle
against right opportunist errors must
be carried on in such a way as not

to weaken the main task.”

The debate revolved largely around
the sense of this section, and the com-
mittee voted, by a vote of 19 for and
6 against, to support the sense and
the underlying concept of this ques~
tion, to endorse its line and direction.

Secondly, the question arose
whether we could pose the question
of the right opportunist danger in
the form of a two—front struggle, that
we have a situation where we must
even—handedly ﬁght against right
and left errors. There were a num-
ber of different amendments which
posed this question in various ways
and degrees. Whether the right
danger is the main danger, whether
we should conduct a struggle on two
fronts, and so on. I am not going to
go into the phraseology of them, be-
cause the sense of the committee-
and I believe of this convention—is
to discuss the meaning and content
rather than the speciﬁc words or
phrases.

In each case, the committee voted
against what it considered watering
down or changing the meaning of
the section that I have read, not be-
cause there Was anyone who felt that
we did not need to ﬁght against right
opportunism———on the contrary, the
comrades saw the necessity for this,
in varying degrees, and unanimously
agreed to insert the Word “in-
crease” so that it reads that “the
Party must ‘increase’ its vigilance
against right opportunist tendencies.”

 

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

But the great fear of the majority
of the committee was that, if We
blunted the main struggle, if we
blurred or diffused the main lesson,
we would lose the main thing that
the Party is struggling to achieve
this last year—to make a basic change
from the past period, to break our
isolation by striking at its main
direction, without voting down or
diluting it. So the majority opposed
acting on some amendments which
in themselves sounded to some
simply as speaking about ﬁghting
right opportunism, which is already
dealt with in the draft. But these
amendments, taken in the context of
the whole, would lose the impact of
the main thing that we must learn
if we are not to be right back where
we started from at the beginning of
this discussion.

There was also fear on the part
of many that it might actually re—
verse the main direction of the draft
resolution, and without attempting
to impugn the motives of any com-
rades who make amendments or
such proposals, it is known to this
convention and the whole Party that
there is a current which is ﬁghting
to reverse the main direction of the
draft resolution. And it is in this
spirit that the votes on the question
of the content of this resolution, re-
gardless of phrases, were taken.

The committee adopted a brief
motion which attempted to clarify
our understanding of what we are

143

driving at, which said, in essence,
that the main character of our errors
in the last period was left sectarian-
ism, that this should not obscure
the need to ﬁght against right oppor-
tunism, especially in the efforts to
break with sectarianism, but that we
should not obscure that the main
task in ﬁghting to change our Party
must be to guarantee that we break
with those errors which were res-
ponsible for our isolation and the
position which we are in today.
Comrades, it seems to me that,
aside from any wording that we dis-
cuss, the delegates must be aware
that what this convention must de-
termine is whether we have grappled
with the nature of our errors and the
roots of our errors. I am only deal-
ing with one aspect of it, and there-
fore, can deal with it only in a partial
way. Because the deep roots of our
errors, which go into more funda-
mental questions, also point to the
fact that if our Party is to survive as
more than a mere sect, and is to
make any real change in the direc-
tion of breaking with its isolation,
this convention will have to decide
whether it will agree to change or
blunt the direction that we believe
the Party must take, and has begun
to take; whether it will see its main
task as that of directing its main
blow in such a way that all comrades
will see it without any confusion or

obscurity—the task of ﬁghting

against left sectarian errors, not only

 

 

  

146

as errors of tactics or political esti-
mates, but of striking at the deep-
seated dogmatism an.d doctrinairism
which has hung so heavily on our
Party in the past.

It is in this sense that the majority
of the committee presents this report,
and asks you to consider the basic
propositions that were put forward
in this section of the resolution, and
to consider also whatever arguments
or amendments there may be made
against it, or to change it, because
this convention is going to have to
determine the main task that is going
to lead our Party to break through,
and become a mass party and part
of a broader mass movement mov-
ing in the direction of socialism.

I move you, Comrade Chairman,
the adoption of the majority report
of the committee for the section on
the Party. (Applause.)

Cl2.: We will now proceed with
the report for the minority of the
committee. The Chair recognizes
Comrade Esther Cantor from New
York.

Est/zer Cantor (New York): Com-
rades, because this has been such a
hard—working committee, I have been
unable to write out my report, and
am speaking from notes. I’d like
to ﬁrst go to the heart of the ques-
tion. I asked the committee last
night one question which, I feel, is
a question which faces this conven-
tion. How is it possible that in every
convention I attended, two questions

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

were agreed upon: that there was a
growing right danger, and that there
was need for a struggle on two
fronts? That was true of the indus-
trial convention in New York; that
was true of the New York State con-
vention. And in this committee, for
the ﬁrst time in my experience in all
convention discussions, there was no
basic. agreement on any amendment
to the draft resolution, which every-
one, more or less, has said needs
serious amendments.

I think that’s a serious problem for
us, because I do feel responsible, and
I am sure the other comrades do,
too, that there not be a polarization,
that we recognize the questions that
do face us. And frankly, I speak now
from long experience, and bitter ex-
perience, that under the guise of the
main line, our Party has jumped
from pillar to post, swinging in pen-
dulum, and that there is need for
assessing questions in a fundamental
way if we are to chart the course for
building our Party, and steering the
path toward socialism.

And there were just three or four
fundamental propositions that I feel
were presented. I frankly don’t like
to speak as a minority, because these
propositions were the unanimous
majority decision in all the conven-
tions that I participated in, and that
one can agree with a number of
assessments, and yet feel that there
must be amendments in order to
guarantee a definite approach. What

ls

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 147

were those propositions? That, ir1
this section on the errors, there is
an underestimation of objective con-
ditions, in terms of the status of our
Party, that that was not a minimi-
zation of our errors, that didn’t seek
to undermine the errors that We
made, and that this was recognized
by every convention I attended, and
that therefore there had to be a
phrase inserted, which said that, in
addition to the left sectarian errors,
there were objective conditions
which contributed to the isolation
of our Party. That was point num-
ber one.

Point number two was the grow-
ing right danger, in my opinion,
recognized in practically every
amendment adopted so far in the
convention to date, regardless of what
disagreements still have to be ironed
out, regardless of what diﬂiculties
we still face.

Point number three was, that in
deﬁning the roots of the errors, if
you don’t deﬁne the roots of the right
errors that the Party has made in its
history, you not only confuse the
question of what are the roots of the
errors that we have to ﬁght, but you
act as if this Party hasn’t been in
pendulum swings before, and that we
have to have a sober approach to the
tasks ahead of us.

And point number four was, there-
fore, a conclusion of the struggle on
two fronts, without minimizing the
character of the errors.

Now I want to make another
point, comrades. I submitted I
don’t know how many amendments
in trying to get agreement on this
question——the industrial, and the
New York, and this point and that
point—bec;1use I frankly couldn't
understand, including comrades who
had voted from New York on this at
the New York convention, and then
felt that this was not necessary,
at this committee meeting. I couldn't
understand this point, because it
seemed to me that, in every section
of the resolution, there had been
this growing recognition of the fact.

Therefore, I tried to propose the
question in the following way. On
the three key paragraphs, the ﬁrst
sentence remain, and be -unanimous.
It describes the character of the er-
rors of the past; that the second
sentence, there just be one phrase
inserted, which says approximately
that the objective conditions and the
left sectarian errors contributed to
the isolation of the Party. That the
third sentence, we either could
change a word or not a word; that
wasn’t the decisive thing.

That the third paragraph, which
the committee proposes be italicized,
include the growing right danger,
and also include one aspect of the
character of the errors——the roots
of the errors—both of left sectarian—
ism and right opportunism, which_
relates to the impact and pressures
of U.S. imperialism on our course

 

 

I48 ' PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

in all periods and all phases of
work.

And ﬁnally, in an effort to remove
the impact of the struggle against
left sectarianism with this question,
I suggested that the struggle on two
fronts be discussed in terms of the
roots of the errors, that is, a page
and a half after this section, in which
I added to the three discussing the
roots of our left sectarian errors one
section which deals with the roots
of our right errors, revisionism, in
terms of our history.

I felt that this would not mini-
mize, therefore, the questions of the
struggle against left sectarianism,
but would balance the source of the
historical errors of our Party, in-
clude as under consideration the
roots of the right opportunist and
revisionist errors that have plagued
us from time to time, and would
highlight the whole question of a
mushrooming right danger.

Now, all these points were made
in an effort to see whether the com-
mittee would not reﬂect at least con-
ventions that I had participated in,
and as Comrade Schneiderman re-
ported, we were unsuccessful. I feel
there are a number of errors in the
resolution as it stands, and that the
issue of the resolution—the resolu-
tion as amended—has been the oc-
casion of tremendous debate in our
Party, and one of the things that
perplexes me is that, with so many
criticisms and characterizations of

this resolution, the holy of holies be-
comes I4 pages of errors, each of
which really requires detailed ex-
amination and discussion and analy-
sis, and considerable compression,
in my opinion, in order to get a
clearer picture both of the roots and
the character of the errors, and the
direction which the Party has to
face.

But I conceded the question of
the compression of the errors, al-
though, in my opinion, it was one of
the most poorly worked out sections
of the whole draft resolution. That,
I felt, should not be a basic ques-
tion. But when we say that the main
errors of the past were left sec-
tarian, I think that that’s generally
correct. When we point to our dog-
matism and doctrinairism, and a
whole history which requires that
we overcome, not only a style of
work but overcome some of the
weaknesses in the resolution—which
the resolution attests to-—its failure
to discuss, analyze and project a
fully comprehensive program on the
issues of American monopoly capi-
tal, including issues of the labor
movement—when we discuss these
errors, it seems to me that history
requires—including current history
—that characterization of the errors
of the past is not adequate to guar-
antee characterization of the current
situation and guarantee the approach
to the path ahead.

In my opinion, the characteriza-

tion of the path ahead requires a
vigilant struggle against left sectar-
ianism, a recognition of a mush-
rooming right danger, and a recog-
nition of the need for a struggle on
two fronts. And it’s in that light,
comrades, that I’d like to make four
proposals. One, that the convention
Vote to amend the resolution to in-
clude the following: the inclusion
of the relationship of the objective
conditions to our isolation, in terms
of those three paragraphs under dis-
pute; two, in the third paragraph,
a recognition of the growing right
danger, and a recognition of the
past roots of the right and left er-
rors that we have been committing;
three, that, on p. 55, in addition to
the three errors given, that there be
a recognition of the need for struggle
on two fronts, based on a descrip-
tion of the right error.

I, for example, felt that the reso-
lution should say something like
this: While vigorously combatting
left sectarianism and doctrinairism,
the Party must at the same time
resolutely oppose right opportunism
and revisionism, which represents a
strong, dangerous current in the
Party today. Right opportunism has
deep roots in the labor and Marx-
ist movement, dating to the oppor-
tunistic features of the Knights of
Labor, to Gompersism, to the Social-
ist Party, which became dominated
by opportunism, and from which the
left wing correctly split in 1919 to

form the Communist Party. Right
opportunism and revisionism be-
came dominant for a time in our
own Party, as during the period of
Lovestone and Browder. This cur-
rent strongly expresses the pressure
of bourgeois ideology and especially
the inﬂuence of labor reformism and
social democracy, and the theory
that the United States constitutes an
exception to, and is not affected by,
the general laws of capitalist devel-
opment. Hence the necessity of a
two- front struggle ideologically
against doctrinairism and revision-
ism.

Now, comrades, I don't want to
hold a brief for this formulation.
There may be other comrades who
can do it better. All I am saying
is that it seems to me that, in a
resolution as, wordy as this—in _a
resolution as overwhelming as this
——there are four serious weaknesses
in the section on the nature of our
errors, one of which denies the im-
pact, in my opinion, of objective con-
ditions, in terms of the status of the
Party, second, denies the growing
right danger, which I think this con-
vention has increasingly recognized,
third, fails to characterize the roots
of the right error, and fourth, to
insist on the struggle on two fronts.

Comrades, I move the adoption of
those four points. (Applause.)

C/2.: We have before us a ma-
jority and a minority report. While
the makers of the minority report

did not make it oﬂicially, actually,
the motion is to substitute the min-
ority report for the report of the ma-
jority. Now, that’s before the house.

[Lengthy procedural a'z':cu:5z'on.]

Io/m (New Iersey): Comrades, I be-
lieve that the main character of our
errors since 1946 was left sectarian.
I believe that ﬁrmly, I believe it ﬂatly,
and I don’t Want any question on it.
In the resolutions committee (I say
this because the views of some com-
rades have been not accurately re-
flected) the feeling of a number of
comrades, including myself, was that
the draft resolution, correctly stating
that the main line of our errors since
1946 was left sectarian, had failed to
deepen the understanding of -what was
involved in that left sectarian course.

It is of that that I would like to
speak, particularly at this moment. In
doing so, I recognize that the draft
represents an advance, let us say, over
the April report of the National Com-
mittee, which in a most Olympian
fashion, said that the source of left
sectarian errors was wrong estimates.
This is an Olympian view. It assumes
that we have a ﬁfty-ﬁfty chance of
being right—sometimes we’re right,
sometimes we’re wrong, it’s like the
fﬁghter who is told to zigzag, and
then gets clobbered, and says, “Well,
I zigged when I should have zagged.”
We can’t be content with a view that
says, “We made a wrong estimate or
a right estimate, therefore, our line
for ten years is wrong.” But rather,
we must go deeper into our roots and
the style of work of our Party.

To a degree, the resolution attempts

I150 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

this, but curiously missing from the
draft resolution is a very important
root, and that is the class root of left
sectarianism, which in my opinion
must be included in any sober esti-
mation of what are our left sectarian
sources. Particularly, the element of
retreat or capitulation that is often
at the heart of a left line.

Lenin made important contribu-
tions to the analysis of leftism. In his
view, it has much in common with
right opportunism in that both reflect
a political retreat before powerful op-
posing forces or diﬂicult objective cir-
-cumstances. In the case of right op-
portunism, the retreat takes the form
of abandoning openly Marxist prin-
ciples. In the case of left sectarianism,
it takes the form of abandoning the
masses. In the case of the latter, par-
ticularly, we must note that it took
the form, in the period we are discuss-
ing, of a kind of retreat to an ivory
tower in the form of left centers be-
cause we could not cope with the real
conditions in which the American peo-
ple were willing to struggle against
war (which was a real danger), or re-
fused to do so in the enforced condi-
tions that we imposed upon them
in the form of left centers. Both, how-
ever, represent a capitulation to a pow-
erful opponent.

There is no more powerful oppo-
nent on earth of the working class than
U.S. imperialism. It is our opponent,
it creates the conditions in which we
work, and they are diﬂicult conditions.
Yet, considering the pendulum pattern
of our Party's errors—-from right op-
portunism to left sectarianism, and

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION I 151:

back again—it is curious that our draft
resolution overlooks that element in left
sectarianism that might lead to a deep-
er theoretical understanding of our
left-right swings, and fails to mention
the approach to U.S. imperialism that
links them both.

I believe that the omission of this
factor from the draft resolution‘ im-
pedes a full understanding of our er-
rors in the period under review, and
that it leaves us unarmed to the danger
of a right opportunist swing in the
period we are coming into. I urge
its inclusion, and I wish to point out
that the thought represented in this
was an II-IO vote in the resolutions
sub-committee. ’

Charles Loman (New York): I want
to support the minority reporter, who
maintains that we must at all times
wage a two-front struggle against both
left-sectarianism and right opportu-
nism, with the orientation, as is gen-
erally agreed, that we have to wage a
greater struggle at the present time
against our isolation, while recogniz-
ing the right danger. Now this strong
right danger, comrades, is something
that will be with us, in one on an-
other form, as long as we have a Com-
munist Party in the United States,
and the failure ever to struggle on two
fronts is going to lead us into a pen-
dulum swing.

Now I want to quote briefly here
from an actual worker in Comrade
Schneiderman’s own district, as to
one of the basic material reasons for
this, as to why we will always be con-
fronted with right opportunist ten-
dencies, although at one or another

time we may be isolated. One of the
roots of the past errors and the pres-
ent disastrous situation—it all boils
down to the historic, heroic, unequal
struggle between powerful American
imperialism, ﬁghting in its own back
yard against the small, predominantly
middle-class American Communist
Party. The history of our Party has
been a valiant struggle against almost
unbelievable odds-—David against Go-
liath. The tremendous superiority and
strength of American imperialism over
its tiny adversary has, of course, ex-
pressed itself in many ways. It ex-
presses itself in the sheer ability to cor-
rupt wide sections of the American
working class. The German, Engels,
spoke of a bourgeois proletariat for a
nation which exploits the whole world.
The Russian, Lenin, spoke of the ten-
dency of imperialism to divide the
workers, to encourage opportunism
among them, and to cause temporary
decay in the working class movement.
Historically, yes, it is temporary, but
meanwhile it presents the American
Party with a superhuman task of con-
vincing a working class of the need
for socialism that, as Engels put it,
merrily shares in the feast of world
exploitation.

The major decisive cause of the Par-
ty’s isolation in the past decade has
been the prosperity bubble so carefully
nurtured by American imperialism.
Yes, persecution and the anti-Commu-
nist hysteria were basic and strong
factors, but they would never have
had‘ their deadly effect without the
all-decisive prosperity bubble as its
foundation. Voices will of course cry,

    

 

 

I52

"But you are saying what the ene-
mies of Communism are saying, that
the Party likes to see the workers in
misery, and hates to see them well 0 .”
It is no such thing. What Marxist-
Leninists have been saying, is that the
prosperity which the American work-
ers enjoy is rotten, and for two reasons:
first it is built on sand and will not
last. We do not advocate depression
-—we predict it! We have no power to
inﬂuence capitalist economic forces.
To warn the workers of economic dis-
aster is to do them a service. To per-
petuate the fairy tale of permanent
prosperity is to leave them blind to
catastrophe.

Second, part of the economic com-
forts are based on the exploitation of
the rest of the world by American im-
perialism. Would it be an honest thing
for the American Communist Party to
conceal this embarrassing fact? Lenin
went into great detail about one na-
tion living high and mighty off the
backs of other nations. It is not a
popular nor a pleasant fact, but it is
nevertheless a fact that is an absolutely
essential ingredient in the education
of the American working class. Any-
thing else is chauvinism and opportu-
nism. Did I say opportunism and
chauvinism? Yes, toward Asia, Africa,
Latin America, and the Negro people
at home. Even Europe chips in part
of her standard of living to raise our
standard of living a little higher. Each
colonial nation and continent has its
standard of living lowered so that ours
may be raised to what is known as
the American standard of living. For
this very reason, the parasitic character

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

of modern American capitalism has
stood out with particular prominence.
To put it bluntly, American impe-
rialism is a swollen parasite.

What are the symptoms? Our un-
usually large middle-class, and our un-
usually large number of skilled work-
ers, which represents a shifting of the
burden of arduous toil to the backs of
the colonial people. We can see it here
with the Negro people getting the dirti-
est and hardest jobs. Has anyone failed
to see the American custom of a white
foreman standing over Negro or Mexi-
can workmen digging ditches? It’s
classic. (Applause.)

[Chairman calls time.]

Comrades, I say that this is one
reason why this will always be with us,
and we will always have to struggle
against right opportunism.

Bolza Baxter (Michigan): Com-
rades, I think that it is impossible
to satisfactorily amend this section of
the resolution. I believe that for the
reason that the amendments and reso-
lutions submitted thus far deal with
only part of this section, and take
for granted that we are all agreed on
what constituted the errors and weak-
nesses. Hence the reports do not dis-
cuss pages 43-46. Within those pages,
there is the charge that we underesti-
mated the war danger, that we under-
estimated the fascist danger, and things
of that sort, and these were errors.
Then we proceed to discuss the na-
ture of those errors, without having
agreed upon whether these were errors
in fact, or whether these are exaggera-
tions, or only part truths, to say the
least.

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION I53

Secondly, this section treats with the
mistakes and weaknesses of the Party
as if our whole history has been one
serious mass of mistakes and weak-
nesses, without pinpointing the speciﬁc
periods in which certain estimates were
presented, and indicating the periods
in which certain of these incorrect
estimates were changed. Unless We are

' that speciﬁc and not so general, then

we present ourselves to the American
people and to our membership as one
bunch of political infants, which I do
not think we are.

Therefore, I am hard-pressed to take
a position, either on the majority re-
port or on the minority report. I feel
that we made perhaps the most out-
standing contribution in the ﬁght for
peace, taking second place to no or-
ganization on the American scene, in
that we constantly kept our eyes on
the development in the international
arena as it related to the question of
war and peace, and we brought to the
American people a certain conscious
ness of the war danger as it mani-
fested itself in speciﬁc instances. It
was necessary at certain times to take
a position that would counteract the
efforts of the bourgeoisie to give us
the impression that the die had been
cast, and world war was upon us, as
a part of a process of trying to win
us for War. These, in my opinion, were
correct measures; they did not under-
estimate the war danger, they did not
oyerestimate the war danger for a whole
historic period, maybe, in certain in-
5t3‘1C¢S, for short periods, yes. It is
my opinion that page 43 to page 45
of this draft resolution should be elimi-

nated. In order to present a satisfac-
tory discussion and position on the er-
rors, what they were, their nature,
their origin, it is necessary in my opin-
ion that we re-write this in a calm trian-
ner, taking all the necessary time to
cross the “t’s” and dot the “i’s.” (Ap-
plause.)

C/1.: Will the next speaker indicate
whether he is speaking for the major-
ity or for the minority, now.

Lou Malinow (New Iersey): Speak-
ing in favor of the majority report,
and against the minority report: First of
all, I would like to inform the con-
vention that, at the New Iersey state
convention, there was an endorsement
of the section dealing with the errors
by a vote of 32 for, 3 against, and 2
abstentions. I would like to make my
position clear in speaking for the ma-
jority report, and against the minority
report. I want to state very ﬂatly
that I believe that right opportunism
is a danger; I also believe that we have
to ﬁght on all fronts that would pre-
vent our Party from carrying out a pol-
icy designed to win allies in a struggle
that we are carrying on.

However, comrades, I believe that
this minority report does not do a
service to our struggle, because I think
there is a difference of estimates as
to what is the situation in our Party.
The minority report makes the argu-
ment that there has been an increase
of right tendencies in the Party. It is
my judgment that, when we started
out this discussion, we said that the
main source of our errors and the
source of our isolation was left sec-
tarianism. I believe there is a danger

that this lesson will be killed before
it is born.

Before this struggle against left sec-
tarianism has gotten off the ground,
there has been an avalanche of heavy
artillery that has now placed the right
danger as the main danger in the
Party. I think that this would do a
disservice to our struggle, and that if
we were to accept this kind of an es-
timate, it would not be a struggle on
two fronts, but essentially, would be
a continuation of our policies and prac-
tices that we have dealt with in the
past.

It seems to me that there is one
new feature in our discussion today,
different from any time in the history
of the Party. I think, in an effort to
move in a progressive and forward di-
rection, we are exploring new areas
of problems that we lever looked into
before. I refer to those sections of the
draft discussing the errors on those
points dealing with doctrinaire and
dogmatic approaches to theory. It is my
opinion that this new area of explora-
tion is something which, again, must
be emphasized if we are to re-root our
Party in accord with the needs of the
present day.

I think that to those comrades who
have been making the big argument
of right opportunism in connection with
concepts of the Party, we have to say
that in actuality, our Communist Party
has dwindled over the years because
of left sectarian practices and concepts
in Party organization. These happen
to be the facts of life. It has to be
understood that the danger that is
crippling our Party and that which has

caused our isolation, is this left sec-
tarianism. The right opportunist dan-
ger, in my judgment, is subordinate
to this left sectarian danger. In fact,
I believe that, to the degree that we
will effectively combat left sectarian-
ism, to that degree will we be also
making guarantees that we will be
ﬁghting right opportunism, because I
think that the experiences of the past
show that there were many comrades
in our trade union movement and in
mass work who went off on right op-
portunist tears because of the failure
of our Party to effectively combat left
sectarianism. So that I do not see a
disconnection between the struggle
against left sectarianism and the strug-
gle against right opportunism.

And therefore, Comrades, I believe
that the majority report places this
question properly, I urge the adoption
of that report. (Applause.)

Olga (New York): Speaking for
the minority, I come from Lower Har-
lem, which is a Puerto Rican and work-
ing class community. We have on our
staff majority and minority forces, be-
sides two other members who have
been called middle forces. Yet, when
it came to completely analyze the er-
rors of the past ten years in our area,
all four of us, including Mercedes,
who had voted with the New York
State Board, agreed that the main er-
ror in our area had been of a right
opportunist character. I’m not saying
this is the over-all error of the Party;
I am talking only about the one area
where I have had experience, which is
Lower Harlem.

In the thirties, in Lower Harlem,

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

we had as many as 1,400 members.
As late as 1954, we had 400 members.
Today, we have dwindled to less than a
hundred, of which only about a third
are active. It was the consensus of
our section convention, of our staff,
that one of the main reasons for the
dwindling of our membership and our
inﬂuence in Lower Harlem has been
because the Party has abdicated its
leadership in Lower Harlem. In the
past, we correctly supported Marcan-
tonio, who was a lighting Congress-
man, who fought for the rights of the
Puerto Ricans, for the Negro people,
and for the working people. He fought
for peace. But in ﬁghting for Marcan-
tonio, and in supporting the ALP, we
abdicated the Party role in Lower Har-
lem. The people no longer came to
recognize as they had at one time in
the thirties the one party that was
always ready for the Puerto Rican
people, that was ready to fight for bet-
ter housing, for better schooling. In
’53, we conducted a campaign to get
signatures to put Charney on the ballot
to run for district attorney in New
York State, in which most of the sig-
natures were obtained from Lower
Harlem. I don’t think there’s a single
canvasser who canvassed in Lower Har-
lem who can tell you that when we
knocked on doors and said we were
canvassing in the name of the Commu-
nist Party that he was turned down,
or in any way felt that the community
wasn’t ready to listen to us if we had
been willing to raise our voice on any
ISSUC.

When, as late as about ten months
ago, just at the beginning of all these

155

discussions, one of the Smith Act vic-
tims, a member of the Puerto Rican
Communist Party, came here, and a
meeting was held in support, and leaf-
lets were distributed, the people of
the community _ turned out and gave
their support to the Smith Act de-
fendant. Yet, with the exception of
these two actions, not once has the
Communist Party of Lower Harlem
taken a stand on any issue which af-
fects the Puerto Rican people. We
have abdicated on the issues, and there-
fore, some of us who are in mass or-
ganizations have at times committed
left sectarian errors, because we were
trying to get our mass organizations
to do the work that the Party should
have been doing in Lower Harlem,
and not the mass organizations. (Ap-
plause.)

When the Party abdicates its van-
guard role, it forces our comrades who
are in other organizations to very often
take incorrect left sectarian roles in or-
der to try to get those organizations
to do the role of the Party. So I feel
that, when the draft resolution slights
the right opportunist mistakes we made
in the past, and only emphasizes the
left sectarian errors, it is making a
disservice to the Party. We have to
ﬁght on two fronts, and we have to
fight equally on two fronts——left sec-
tarianism and right opportunism at the
same time, because one leads to the
other both ways, and so I support the
minority report, and reject the concept
that our main fight is on left sec-
tarianism. We have to fight right op
portunism because it’s not only a grow-
ing danger, or a danger of the past

ten months, but these are errors that
we have committed in the past ten
years, too. (Applause.)

Iim West (Illinois): I speak for and
against (laughter). I am for Bill
Schneiderman’s report in its entirety,
I am for Esther Cantor’s report, in
spite of the fact that I disagree with
a few formulations in it. I am against
being put in a position where I have.
to choose between these two. I am for
adopting both of these reports. I do
not regard these reports as being mu-
tually exclusive. I regard them as com—
plementary and necessary to the unity
of our Party. I am for a united Party
in a spirit of the statesman—like address
of Comrade Gene Dennis; I am for
uniting all of our ranks to a common
struggle against isolation; I am for re-
assuring the fears and apprehensions
of those of our comrades, in industry,
especially, who have become fright-
ened—if you wil1—at the specter of
right opportunism.

I am for reassuring them. In my
opinion, the rejection of the majority
report will only raise these fears anew.
This convention has taken some very
important steps toward allaying those
fears. I think we have to go further
in that direction. In my opinion, the
main danger was, and remains, left
sectarianism. And I am glad to see
the minority report acknowledge this
and place this to the fore. In my opin-
ion, we will not fight left sectarianism
with right opportunism, or vice versa.

I think the most important thing
is not to adopt the idea that we, who
have made so many mistakes, are go-
ing to guarantee the non-repetition of

mistakes in the future by the words
or phrases we are going to adopt here.
We’re going to make many, many
more mistakes. As far as our future
is concerned, I am quite optimistic,
because, if success comes out of a lot
of mistakes, we’ve got a great big suc-
cess ahead of us.

From that point of. view, the most
important thing is to take our mem-
bership along with us in this struggle
against isolation. I am for the adop-
tion of both reports. (Applause.)

C/2.: I’d like to have the next for
the majority, if I can.

Sam Coleman (New York): Speak-
ing for the majority, I think it’s inter-
esting that some of the discussion would
lead you to believe that the mistakes
of the past decade were right opportu-
nist. Because all the reasons given were
that these mistakes should have. been
right opportunist. But, in fact, they
weren’t. And I think we should not
lose sight of the fact that what we are
discussing is a decade of left sectarian
errors.

Secondly, I would like to point out
that, while it is true that both right
and left errors may occur in ﬂight from
struggle, what we are concerned with
is, why did we ﬂee in the left direc-
tion, if that was what it was. If it was
a ﬂight. That’s the problem we have
to discuss.

Now, it has been said that we are
a little weak on self-criticism in our
Party, and I think that this has been
revealed in the discussion. Self-criti-
cism is not the recognition of errors
alone. You’ve got to say what you
did Wrong first——I think that’s clear.

 

-.«~. .. :=.--¢a; ,

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 157

And we’re trying to do that. You’ve
also got to say why you did it wrong,
you’ve got to do then the hard thing
——correct those errors, learn to do it
right. And this is what troubles me
about the minority report. I think it
would prevent our learning how to
do it right, it would prevent the cor-
rection of these grave, serious e'rrors
that have helped to isolate our Party
over the past decade.

Why do I say that? Well, we have a
section that said why we made the
left errors. It says we made them be-
cause of our dogmatic and doctrin-
naire approach to theory. I don’t think
anyone here can really question. that.
Speaking for myself, some friends tell
me that, in a brief visit between trial
and jail in New York, I wrote an ar-
ticle on foreign trade. In the course
of that article, in ’53, I just casually
said that the GAW couldn’t operate
because you can’t have it under capi-
talism. That’s what I consider simple
dogmatism. And that’s the kind of
dogmatic attitude I think I shared. I
don’t think I was alone.

Are we going to overcome this dog-
matism in a week, in a month, in ten
months, or a year of discussion? Or do
we have to work and study and learn
our country and our class forces over
a period of years, to correct that left
sectarian error and that theory? We
say we had as a root source of that
leftism uncritical and over—simpliﬁed
attitudes towards other parties and other
socialist countries. I think this is true.
Are we going to overcome those over-
simpliﬁed and uncritical attitudes in a
ten months’ discussion, or is it going

to take years for us to figure out how to
do it? We say that our bureaucracy
bears a share of the responsibility. Is
that overcome? Who would dare to say
that we have solved the problems of
our bureaucratic methods of work? I
think the minority report would pre-
vent self-criticism, would prevent cor-
rection, prevent us from doing that
which will take us a long time, be-
cause it blurs the whole impact of the
discussion of the past ten months, the
recognition of the errors and the at-
tempt to ﬁnd out why we made those
errors.

Are there right errors being made?
I think there are. I think the proposal
that we organize a Fabian Society is
a right opportunist deviation. I have
heard one comrade suggest that, for the
next period, we don’t make socialism
a major point, because we want the
anti-monopoly coalition. I think that’s
a right deviation and revisionism. I
think, however, that these are ade-
quately handled in two ways. First,
the resolution is sharpened up, as Com-
rade Schneiderman reported, with vigi-
lance against these right errors. Sec-
ondly, I think that the correction of
our left errors is a fundamental way
to prevent. the so-called false mush-
rooming of the right, because the right
feeds upon the left, and proper strug-
gle to correct the left errors will pre-
vent the development of these right
errors.

I agree, therefore, with the way the
majority report places this question.
I think that, in the true Leninist spirit,
this convention must undertake the
elimination, the uprooting of the roots

    

158

of these errors. I think this requires
study, the concrete analysis of con-
crete conditions of our country, fuller
exploration and investigation, and
learning how to be Marxist-Leninists
on the basis of the very speciﬁc con-
ditions which we confront. I consider
therefore, there should be nothing said
which blurs the fact that what we need
to correct has been terrible, deep-go-
ing, old, deeply-rooted left errors. I
think that the minority report prevents
our carrying through the ﬁnal stage
of self—criticism, and I urge full sup-
port for the majority. (Applause.)

Gideon (New York): This question,
which has been reported by the ma-
jority, and the discussion in terms that
the minority is not in favor of the
idea that sectarianism is a major dan-
ger—major danger—I think has to be
clear. I think everybody here recog-
nizes it, even the minority report.
Agreed, as far as left sectarianism is
concerned, it has been and still re-
mains a danger. But at the same time,
and the minority report emphasizes,
we cannot ignore the question of right
opportunism as well. And I think this
has to be made clear.

I know, for instance, in my own in-
dustry, in New York, where for the
past three years, we have been ﬁghting
against left sectarianism, and we’ve
been trying to make corrections in our
work, and in the past three years, We
have been taking positive roles in our
union, what does the Party do? Comes
down to our organization, makes criti-
cism of our past work, writes articles
in Political Aﬁair: about our union’s
leadership, where it developed a situa-

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

tion where the people are isolated, not
by our work, but by our Party leader-
ship in New York City. And I think
to blame the membership on the ques-
tion of left sectarianism is a little-
I don’t know how to express it—I think
the responsibility lies, not in the mem-
bership in our industry, but in the lead-
ership, in the bureaucracy in the lead-
ership of our Party in New York
City. (Applause.) And I think that
they should express this criticism of
themselves here on the ﬂoor.

The question of right opportunism
——now let’s not kid ourselves. I know
in our union we made mistakes, and
I wouldn’t say it was deﬁnitely in terms
just of the membership of our Party,
and I am sure that the Party lead-
ership in New York recognizes that the
mistake was more on the top leader-
ship in our Party than on the mem-
bership down below. We know what
happened in our industry. Everything
was done on top, and it happened in
practically every union. So how the hell
can you take the responsibility to the
membership, when actually the re-
sponsibility should be on the top, on
this basic point?

Now I think we have to understand
these questions on the basis of trying
to realize how to work and how to
ﬁght to be able to know to deal with
the people who work in the shop. I
know how to work with the workers in
my shop, and I damn well know that
the people on top don’t know how to
work with these people! Every Party
person in my club, in my organization
knows much better how to work with

 

 

 

 '   SESSIONS or THE CONVENTION :59

the people in the shop than the people
on top in our Party! I don’t think
people recognize this question. They're
criticizing every time in terms of our
work, and yet do not realize what
our problems are in the shop at the
same time.

I believe the dangers are on both
sides—-—-left sectarianism and at the
same time, right opportunism as well.
(Applause.)

Betty: I speak for neither, and
I refuse to be placed in a strait-
jacket of speaking either for one or
the other. And because I feel so strong-
ly about it, I would insert a contribu-
tion by the Illinois delegation, which
I want to read for, perhaps, a little
lighter feature of our convention.

"I envy those who seem to know
That things must be exactly so,
That black is black, and white is white,
That wrong is wrong, and right is
right,
And things are thus and so.

I only wish that they could see
That they are they, and I am me."
(Laughter.)

I agree with Comrade Schneider-
man that we must not do anything at
this convention to blunt the main di-
rection of our resolution on this ques-
tion, and I also agree with him that,
an equal struggle against right and left,
would, in my opinion, be disastrous
for our Party. But nevertheless, be-
cause of life itself, I am deeply con-
cerned about the failures in the reso-
lution, because of what has happened
in the recent months in our Party.

I am concerned about the sentence
which says, “The necessary struggle
against right opportunist errors must
be carried on in such a way as not to
weaken the main task.”

I am concerned about that because,
in practice, it has meant silence on
right errors. And when we look back
historically in our Party, and I will
say that the comrades are blind who
fail to see that historically, and in the
recent period, left sectarianism has
been the disease of our Party, even at
the moment when we had the biggest
and most intimate connections with the
people. But, when I am running in a
certain direction, I don’t want to run
either to the right or to the left. And
the danger today is that some people,
correctly ﬁghting in order to overcome
our left sectarian errors, consider that
it is a very good thing to keep silent
on the right, because the right is
bold, it is growing with new prob-
lems, it is for change. But those of
us who say that the answers of ’33
can’t meet the problems of _today,
when the world is so different, are
also not ready to say that we are at
a point in history when everything
in the past is thrown overboard, and
Marxism-Leninisrn is valid only to the
extent that the subjective eye deter-
mines what those principles are.

Reality is reality, and MarXist-Len-
inists arrive at a conclusion collectively.
No individual can say, “I will agree
with those principles that I consider
valid.” It ‘is the principles we con-
sider valid that determine the science
of Marxism-Leninism, and it is because
of this—and a whole number of other

 

 

 

 

 

r6o PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

things that have taken place within
the recent months—that many of us
who were against both extremes be-
lieve it is necessary at this moment,
while doing absolutely nothing inso-
far as minimizing that left sectarian-
ism in relation to the people of our
country has been and remains the dis-
ease, that we include, in a form that
doesn’t blunt that major struggle, the
necessity of vigilance and a struggle
against right opportunism. (Applause.)

Iolzn Hellman (Montana): I would
like to support the position of Jim
West, for some important reasons. For
one thing, I think there is a tendency
to consider that the situation in the
Party throughout the country is the
same everywhere, and this is deﬁnitely
not the case. I am certainly not try-
ing to judge what the situation is in
New York, but apparently, it is quite
diﬁferent from that in Montana. And
therefore, since this draft resolution
supposedly applies to the entire na-
tion, including Montana, we have to
view it in regard to how we will ap-
ply it in Montana, as well as how you
will apply it in New York.

And I want to say, too, that we are
probably the most autonomous district
in the nation. We haven’t seen anyone
from the National Committee or the
National Oflice in many, many years.
(Laughter.) I understand, when I
was arrested under the Smith Act, that
everybody said, “My God, who is he?
I’ve never seen his name before.”

Now, I say we should adopt both
reports because, seriously, in Montana,
about four years ago after the disas-
ten of the Progressive Party cam-

paign in 1952, we had a complete re-
assessment of what everybody was do-
ing, and we really feel that, at that
time, we corrected practically all of the
left sectarianism that was involved in
our work, and that, for the past four
years, we have been on the sort of path
that apparently now everybody agrees
is necessary. We had people who were
isolated; we had a certain amount of
demoralization, but I’d like to report
now, after four years of getting away
from left sectarianism, we’ve had a state
convention—while we’re very small——
where we had complete unanimity, we
had a lot of optimism, we have not
lost a member in Montana for over

three years. (Applause.)

Therefore, I think we in Montana
are rightly concerned that the resolu-
tion not stress just left sectarianism,
because, for us, seriously, that will be
a complete distortion of what we will
have to do in Montana.

Now, I want to say, too, while there’s
an awful lot of attitude of, “Well,
Montana doesn’t amount to much,”
I’d like to just point to a thing or
two that has been achieved in Montana
as the result of a real farmer-labor
coalition. For one thing, the delega-
tion in the United States Congress
is backed by the farmer-labor coalition.
In Butte, a labor led coalition has
elected the majority on the school board
of Butte, and signed a union shop con-
tract with the teachers’ union. (Ap-
plause.) And we ﬁnd that, after four
years we have changed, we are differ-
ent, and we’re not going to get way
out in left ﬁeld. We ﬁnd we are ac-

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

ccptcd again. This is something that
people are learning in practice—that
we’ve changed. And no resolutions
will convince them, only our activity.
And as I said before, I therefore think
that we should adopt both reports. (Ap-
plause.)

AFTERNOON SESSION

February II, 1957

Doxcy Wz'lI(er5on (New York):
The report of the Committee ma-
jority would have this Convention af-
ﬁrm a truth which should be clear to
all who are willing to look; namely,
that the main subjective weaknesses
of our Party during the past period
have been of a left-sectarian charac-
ter. This is a fact we have got to
recognize; because our understanding
of how our own errors contributed to
the crisis we now face is absolutely es-
sential if we are to move forward
again as a vital part of the political
life of our country.

The sectarian distortions which have
prevailed in our theory and practical
work can be illustrated from many
fields. Since I did not get the ﬂoor
last night during the discussion of the
Negro question, let me cite a few ex-
amples in this ﬁeld.

Aside from our persecution by the
class enemy and its government, what
explains our marked isolation from
the burgeoning Negro people’s move-
ment today? I think the answer is

161

found in such facts as a theoretical
orientation which looked toward the
development of an autonomous Negro
nation in the Black Belt, which we per-
sisted in holding while obviously the
Negro people were moving in quite
a different direction. It would be found
in the rather sneering and contemptu-
ous approach we have taken to the key
middle-class leaders of the Negro people
and the organizations which they lead,
and a rather one-sided, mechanical ap-
proach to the Negro working class,
ignoring the real relationship of forces
at the present time. It’s to be found
in such things as our contempt for the
legal struggles around the schools,
which I think all of us now recognize
has loomed into one of the major
political issues confronting us at the
present time.

Not only in this ﬁeld, but in other
ﬁelds that have been discussed here,
do we ﬁnd the same kind of thing
true. I heard one comrade discussing
the Negro question last night who was
obviously back in the 1920's. It would
seem to me that we have got to recog-
nize in this ﬁeld, in the ﬁeld of trade
union work, in the whole question of
the ﬁght for peace, the question of the
American road to socialism, that a lot
of things have happened in the past
quarter century, which some of our
comrades seem not to want to recog-
nize. Surely it is the main reason
—aside from the objective factors that
have been operating, but in terms of
our own weaknesses-—the main reason
we ﬁnd ourselves isolated from the
people’s movement today. We have
persisted in distorted theoretical for-

 

 

‘I62 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

mulations, in sectarian policies and

tactics, the eﬁect of which was to
alienate us from those people whom
we must seek to inﬂuence. And surely
it is this that must be recognized as
our main error, if now there is any
hope of our recouping our lost inﬂu-
ence and moving ahead.

I often think, in the course of some
of the discussions we have, of the days
of my childhood, when I used to go
to church and sing, “Give me that old-
time religion; it was good enough for
my father, and it’s good enough for
me.” When I hear some of the people
who are preoccupied with what they
call right revisionism, I am inclined to
think that what they are really con-
-cerned with is that same fundamentalist
approach that made my communicants
in the church insist that creation hap-
pened just the way it is written down
in Genesis.

They speak in the name of Marxism-
Leninism, but it is not the vital science
of Marx and Lenin; it is a dead, dog-
matic, Talmudic quoting of phrases,
Without the recognition that life is
moving ahead, and our science must
be modiﬁed in relationship thereto. I
think unquestionably that it is this
general approach, reﬂected in much of
our discussion, reﬂected in our actions
during the past decade, which, despite
our important contribution, has been
the main factor leading to our isola-
tion from the people’s movement, and
the recognition of that fact by the adop-
tion of the majority report is an es-
sential step in our moving ahead. (Ap-
plause.)

A Delegate (New York): I speak,

comrades, for both reports, and I wish
I could say that I am I, and they are
they, because-—if I could—then I would
say that both reports should be
strengthened, and that we should go
on from there.

I want to start about criticism. Be-
cause I think that there’s been no real
criticism in any of the discussion bul-
letins, in any of the papers anywhere,
of the leadership giving real criticism
to their own errors. (Applause) And
I feel that if we had this kind of
criticism before, then we could have
come into these conventions and begun
a real program where we are going
from here. But I think that there has
been no relationship of how these left
sectarian errors were gone into, how
we were forced into these errors, be-
cause, comrades, I am sure that if it
had been up to the rank and ﬁle peo-
ple working in shops, mass organiza-
tions, unions, etc., we would never
have had the problem of consolidating
our membership as closely as we did
in the past period because we didn’t
feel that it was necessary. We were not
so isolated from the problems of the
workers; we felt this grave danger that
hung over us, but we felt our very best
protection was if we stayed among
these people, ﬁghting and acting on the
day to day problems that faced these
people.

We don’t have time in ﬁve minutes
to go into these things, but I think
that if we did an evaluation in our
Party of the whole country, of the eco-
nomic conditions, of proﬁt, of wages,
of cost of living, and an estimate of
what we actually have, where we in-

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

tend to go, that we wouldn’t have so
much problem of assessing which is
right, and what our position is, and
what our status is right now. In the
South, comrades, in this period when
we talk about so much higher wages
and etcetera, in the farm areas there
was mass unemployment of farm
workers, there was a whole mass‘ of
small farmers who left their farms to
go into factories to work, and if we had
estimated that in its proper place, we
wouldn’t have made the wrong con-
clusions about the depression coming
next year or the year after that, but
we would have had a clear estimate of
where we were going and the errors
would not have been made.

I think we ought to go a little bit
into the living standards of people, and
their rate of unemployment. Because
conditions in the country are not so
much as they are in certain sections of
New York. Because today, in New
York City, there are thousands of peo-
ple who can’t get their relief checks,
who have been thrown off the rolls
because the list of unemployment is so
great that they don’t get to them, or
they have no way of carrying this out.

I just want to say that even on this
business where they talk about—I don’t
know how to express it, but I don’t
know what you’re going to call the
bombs and the shootings and the
lynchings and the killings and the
repression of the Negro people in the
South, who are strugg1ing—and the
people who have thrown their children
into the struggle—and when a mother
throws her children into a struggle of
this kind she must mean business. And

163

I don’t know if it’s in the main stream
of American life, but if this isn’t a
real radical change, comrades, then
our estimates are really bad.

I feel that we have to adopt both
these reports, and that we have to go
on from there to strengthen it by the
facts of life in our every day work in
the future. (Applause.)

[Motion passed that the oﬂicers of the
over-all Resolutions Committee, the oﬂicers
of the Sub-Committee and the Minority
Reporter (Stein, Jackson, Healey, Schnei-
derman, Sparks, Weiss, B. Nelson and
Cantor) get together and try to bring in
a unanimous report.]

C}1.: We will now hear the second
section of the report of Sub—Commit—
tee No. 5. This section deals with the
question of theory. The Chair recog-
nizes Max Weiss.

Max Weiss: Comrades, this ﬁrst
paragraph which you have before
you was preceded by a clause which
read: “Doctrinaire forms of Party
organization, bureaucratic methods
of work, etc.” The question was rais-
ed in the committee that this is inter-
preted to refer to the fact that the
Party form of organization was
considered to be doctrinaire, and it
was felt that, since this was not the
intent of the draft, the best thing to
eliminate any such reference was to
strike out the clause, “doctrinaire
forms of Party organization,” which
was done, by a vote of 14 to strike,
7 against, 2 ab-stentions. The second
change was the addition of what is
now the fourth paragraph, which is

 

164

underlined. I read that paragraph
to you. It reads as follows:

“In carrying out this central ideol-
ogical task, we should bear in mind
our Party’s past errors in the direction
of revisionism and guard against any
such tendencies in the present period.
This must be done in such a way as to
reinforce the struggle to overcome the
main obstacle which is our deeply
rooted doctrinairism and dogmatism,
a struggle which is still only in its
initial stages.”

The Committee felt it necessary to
insert that paragraph, particularly be-
cause the main weight of this whole
section is directed to the ﬁght against
doctrinairism and dogmatism and
we felt it was necessary to place the
struggle against revisionism in the
proper context, without detracting
from the main direction of our strug-
gle. This proposal was carried by a
vote of 19 for, I against, with I ab-
stention.

Now we come to the ﬁfth para-
graph, directly following that. In
dealing with this paragraph, our com-
mittee was called upon to debate one
of the most decisive questions before
the Party in the present discussion.
A motion was made to strike the
word “interpret” from the draft res-
olution, on page 56, and to substitute
for it a section which would seek
only “creatively applying” the prin-
ciples of Marxism—Leninism. The
motion to strike the word “interpret”

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

was defeated by a vote of 14 to 12.
In the draft resolution, it’s on page
56.
The position of the majority of the
committee, which supported retain-
ing the word “interpret” was as fol-
lows: such an insertion is necessary
as an explicit declaration of the in-
dependent and equal status of our
Party in relation to all other parties
in the world Communist movement
in matters of theory. This has not
always been the case. The past his-
tory of our relations with other Com-
munist parties has largely been one
in which we tacitly assumed that the
interpretation of the principles of
Marxism-Leninism, as made by the
Communist Party of the Soviet Un-
ion, was ipso facto valid, and that
all we had to do was to creatively
apply their interpretation to our con-
ditions.

But this past history, as well as
the present situation, proves that
conﬂicting interpretations of these
Marxist-Leninist principles inevitably
arise. There is, for example, the pres-
ent controversy between the French
and Italian parties over whether the
Italian Communist Party’s slogan
for the reform of that country’s so-
cial structure violates the principles
of Marxism—Leninism. The French
Communist Party interprets the prin-
ciples of Marxism—Leninism in such
a way that the Italian position is a
departure from principle.

There is, for example, the different

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

interpretation of the Marxist teach-
ings of the absolute and relative im-
poverishment of the masses. The
French Communist Party, as ex-
pressed in a report of Comrade
Thorez, makes one interpretation;
however, others, for example the
Italian party, present a somewhat
different interpretation of this prin-
cipled question. The letter read by
Comrade Duclos to our convention
also makes it clear that the interpre-
tation of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of France of
the principles of Marxism—Leninism
is such that our Party, and our reso-
lution, is departing from these prin-
ciples. C
Our Party; and particularly this
convention, is called upon to decide
for itself whether it agrees with the
interpretation of the principles of
Marxism—Leninism as made by Duc-
los, or whether we have a different
interpretation of these principles, in
such a way that we consider our re-
solution as being consistent .with
these principles. There are clearly
involved here two different interpre-
tations of what these principles are.
Finally, it should be known that,
when our Party’s exposition of the
possibility of a peaceful transition to
socialism in the United States was
first made public, there were im-
portant Communist parties which
considered this position to be a de-
parture from the principles of Marx-
ism—Leninism. Clearly there was a

165

difference in interpretation between
our Party and these other important
parties. It is fortunate that our Party
stuck to its guns in our interpreta-
tion of the principles of Marxism-
Leninism on this important question.
History has proven that we were
correct on this matter, and that they
were wrong.

The majority of the committee is
of the opinion that our Party must
continue, while paying the closest
attention to the valued opinions of
other parties, to decide for itself the
interpretation of Marxist—Leninist
principles. Why did the majority of
the committee feel that we cannot
accept the formulation “creatively ap-
plied” as a substitute for the word
“interpret”? For this reason. The
creative application of a principle
depends upon the prior question of
the interpretation of that principle.
We cannot agree with any position
that some other party will interpret
for us what these principles are, and
all that we are called upon to do is to
apply as creatively as we can their
interpretation.

Therefore, the motion to substitute
the formulation “creatively applied”
for “interpret” cannot be accepted
by the majority of our committee,
and it was rejected by a vote of 14
to 12.

Now, many comrades agreed fully
with the necessity to declare clearly,
unmistakeably and publicly that it
is our Party which must interpret

 

 

166

these principles, that no other party
in the international Communist
movement should be assumed to
have any authoritarian, ex cathedra
right to interpret these principles for
our Party. However, these comrades
expressed fear that, as originally for-
mulated in the draft resolution,
doubt might be cast on the objective
character or universality of the prin-
ciples of Marxism—Leninism. There-
fore, a reformulation was made of
the sentence containing the word
“interpret.” It was broken into two
sentences, and additional language
added at the beginning of the parag-
raph to remove any possible basis
for inferring that we cast doubt on
the universality or objective charac-
ter of the principles of Marxism-
Leninism.

This reformulation, which our
committee adopted, was introduced,
and by the way, adopted by the
Michigan convention of the Commu-
nist Party. This reformulation was
introduced at a special meeting of
the committee this morning, incor-
porating that formulation. It was
adopted by a vote of 17 for, I against,
with 3 abstentions, and the agree-
ment not to have a minority report.

I now read that paragraph:

“Marxism-Leninism is a scientiﬁc
analysis of the universal and objective
laws of social development. It is the
generalization of the experience of the
working class in each country, and of

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

all lands, and like all science, is an
international product. The principles
of scientiﬁc socialism were first put
forward by Marx and Engels. They
were further developed in the im-
perialist era by Lenin. They were later
enriched by contemporary Marxists in
many countries. The Communist
Party bases its theory generally on the
cultural heritage of mankind, and par-
ticularly on the principles of scientiﬁc
socialism developed by Marx, Engels,
and Lenin. These principles the Com-
munist Party of the United States in-
terprets and applies and tries to de-
velop further in accordance with the
requirements of the American class
struggle and democratic tradition. We
must learn much better how to ex-
tract from the rich body of this theory
that which is universally valid, com-
bining it with the speciﬁc experiences
of the American working class in the
struggle for socialism in the United
States. In doing this, the Party must
distinguish better between those addi-
tions to Marxist theory which are valid
for all countries, and those which
reﬂect exclusively the unique features
of one or another country.”

Now, additionally, the committee
agreed to re—write the paragraph
which is two paragraphs away from
the one I just read. The main thing
achieved here is to retain the full
sense of the original in the draft; it
eliminates the identiﬁcation of Lenin
or Stalin with certain theories which
we consider to be either obsolete
or incorrect at this time. In every-

 

.‘rp;.‘.J5.I.-+i—-UH"-as-In tn‘-It-I--I-rt--WW

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

thing else, it remains substantially
the same. It reads as follows:

“Already in response to these new de-
velopments, important new elements
have been introduced into the body
of Marxist theory by Marxists in many
countries, and other theoretical ques-
tions are still under discussion. For
example, we, as well as other Marxist
parties, have already discarded as obso-
lete the thesis that war is inevitable
under imperialism. We have also re-
jected as incorrect the concept of in-
evitable, violent proletarian revolution,
recognizing the possibility in our coun-
try of a peaceful, constitutional transi-
tion to socialism. We are in full agree-
ment to study further the question of
our theoretical and_ tactical approach
to war, theory of the state, dictatorship
of the proletariat, and other questions,
which time does not afford an oppor-
tunity to resolve at this national con-
vcntion.”

This re-wording was adopted by a
vote of 14 for, II against, with 2 ab-
stentions. The only other change
made was in language in the last
paragraph, which deals with the nec-
essity for the Party to work out a
new program. That is, the draft said
that we recommend to the Na-
tional Committee to propose to the
convention. Since the convention is
here, that has been changed; as the
document says, “The convention in-
structs the incoming National Com-
mittee.” This is the section which is

167

proposed now replace the section
originally in the draft resolution, be-
ginning the middle of page 55, going
to the top of p. 57.

I move the adoption of the com-
mittee report.

A Delegate (California): Mr. ‘Chair-
man, brother delegates, friends. I’ve
been here for about an hour and a
half, and what I wanted to speak an
hour and a half ago was on, I believe,
one subject which has been a little
bit altered from the previous report.

My position in regard to the present
struggles that are taking place here
in this convention regards to the unity
of the Party. I identify myself, and
also, I believe, identify many other
people where I come from, along the
lines of Iim West. I think that what
has to be noticed here, from my point
of view, is that in this struggle we
have to take into consideration that
the opinions have to be of a nation-
wide character, and that no one_group
must try to subordinate the rest of the
country to anybody’s position. (Ap-
plause.)

I therefore reject the ruling or what-
ever you want to call it, that one must
come here and speak for or against any
proposition. Along with it, I would
say that, in the beginning of the con-
vention, it was my feeling that the dele-
gates struck a blow against the disunity
that was being created here. But I
would caution against anybody getting
the feeling that, because we were
united yesterday or. the day before,
now we have the power over somebody

else. I think we still have to guard
in these decisions we are making to-
day that unity is the acceptance of
both sides, the arguments of both sides
of this story.

I would say, insofar as the draft reso-
lution is concerned, that I am in sup-
port of the majority as presented here,
although I do not like to characterize
it as a majority report. I would like
to characterize it as those propositions
put forth by the committee. I would
like to minimize the fact that there
is a minority, not from the point
of view of not recognizing it, but
because to give it emphasis is to
sharpen the conflict within the Party
here.

Further, I think that one question is
being very sadly missed here. As a
delegate that comes from working in
the shop, working in a minority, as one
who has always fought bureaucracy
in the Party, and many times been en-
dangered by ﬁghting bureaucracy in
the Party, many times a delegate who
has taken the position “To hell with it
al ”—today I ﬁnd myself here ﬁght-
ing for the preservation of the Party
because I see that the historical times
today are the ﬁrst times that I have
seen the possibility of really destroying
bureaucracy and dogmatism in the
Party! And for that very reason, I say,
let us look at the essence of the reso-
lution, that the full solution and
phraseology of that resolution is not go-
ing to be settled here, but by the at-
titudes the delegates here take back
to the rank and ﬁle, and let the rank
and ﬁle give the ﬁnal analysis by their
experience of this resolution. If this

is not taken heed of, and the delegates
feel that the phraseology, the battle of
the vocabulary, is the dogmatism pres-
ent in this convention, and unless the
attitude——a Marxist, scientiﬁc attitude
—-is taken, that this resolution repre-
sents words from the comrades in the
ﬁeld, and there you must take it back to
the delegates in the area—not words,
but positions of struggle, based on a
new historical period. (Applause)

Mike Russo (Massachusetts): I urge
the adoption of the majority report,
and the defeat of the minority report.
We should categorically reject any im-
plication that, by so doing, a delegate
places himself in opposition to Party
unity. In my opinion, a vote for both
the majority report and the minority
report is fundamentally a vote for the
minority report, to water down the
main line of the draft resolution. I
want Party unity as much as anyone
in this hall does. But it must be
meaningful Party unity. It must bc
Party unity based on a line that will
lead us out of the sectarian rut that
we are in, and put us on the highroad
to becoming an effective political force
in American life. I do not want the
kind of Party unity that will hasten
our transformation into an evangeli-
cal sect. Therefore, I am not for con-
cealing the issues, but bringing thcm
out into the open.

The kind of unity we all desire,
I.am sure, presumes the existence of
differences, sharp differences, provided
there also exists a community of ideol-
ogy-_  do not want to accept a po-
larization of opinion on this or any

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION I69

question we are now confronting, as
denoting an identity of views on either
side, or that one side possesses the sole
and exclusive truth on these questions.
It is my opinionithat the majority of
the membership of our Party, having
discussed the national draft resolu-
tion, believe that the main obstacle
to the further advances of our Party
exists, and has existed, in the form of
deeply ingrained and encrusted sec-
tarianism, against which we have
scarcely begun to struggle. I believe
that the membership of our Party wel-
comes this as something new and re-
freshing. However, there has developed
in the ranks of our Party in the recent
months a very legitimate concern with
the manifestation of certain right ten-
dencies. It seems to me that this con-
vention and our Party should note these
developments as an inevitable conse-
quence of any serious discussion
against so deeply entrenched a danger
as left sectarianism. In my view, the
majority report recognizes the emer-
gence of these dangerous tendencies,
and proposes to handle them in a way
that does not obscure the main danger,
which remains left sectarianism.
However, it is necessary to observe
that all of the reservations and all of
this concern with the developing right
danger does not stem from a common
base or a common outlook. There is
a majority, in my view, although as-
sociating itself with the main line of
the draft resolution, that is consider-
ably apprehensive over these new
manifestations of right opportunism. It
is my purpose and my suggestion that
this convention—and I believe that the

majority report suggests that-—shou1d
note this very genuine concern for
these right dangers, and make these
corrections, as it does, while singling
out the left danger as the basically
entrenched and strong danger against
which we must struggle.

And on the other hand, there is a
small group that is raising this ques-
tion, and the purpose of this group,
in my judgment—and I do not wish
to impugn the motives of this group
in any way, I do not impugn the in-
tegrity or the objectives of anyone in
this convention, insofar as our ultimate
objectives and the aims of our Party
are concerned—but nevertheless, it is
my opinion that the purpose of this
small group is to reverse the main line
of the draft resolution, and to make
right opportunism and revisionism
the main danger to the Party. I say
that if we reverse this line, we will de-
stroy what we are beginning to
achieve, and nullify the only possible
basis upon which we can move for-
ward. (Applause.)

Morris D. (New York): I don’t want
this Party liquidated through left sec-
tarianism or right opportunism. And
I say that because someone is afraid
that we may put our attack only against
right opportunism. I think we all agree
that we are against liquidation, from
whatever source, but our theoreticians
who worked out the formulations of
these resolutions forget to look at real
life.

I am a practicing Communist, work-
ing for a living all my life, and dedi-
cated for over twenty-ﬁve years to the

 

 

170 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

cause of socialism. And I hope to see
it in my time. But I recognize a few
things—that for the last ten years un-
der that slogan socialism is not on the
order of the day, we will ﬁght for day
to day efforts, we have identiﬁed our
day to day tactics with our long range
goal of socialism to the extent that we
never spoke of socialism. Is that right
or left?

Later, we said we’ve got to reach the
level of the masses, and from that level,
go one step higher. In many places,
we reached the level of the masses,
and failed them. We in the labor
movement, because we were known
as Communists, because we did not
honor the proﬁt system, were re-
spected by labor as a class-conscious ele-
ment in the ranks of labor, who would
never betray the interests of labor, be-
cause we were socialist-minded indi-
viduals. Lately, we won’t even ﬁght
against racketeering and class collabo-
rationist lieutenants of monopoly capi-
tal. It is sectarian to mention it, to
the extent that labor doesn’t see the
differences between us and the reform-
ists. And therefore I feel that this
proposition made by Comrade West is
a correct proposition. I know we made
mistakes, left and right, and we were
never isolated from the workers, in
spite of the mistakes. When we saw
we lost votes, we analyzed it and we
did what we thought, in spite of Party
lines, many times.

Therefore, I say that we, in the last
ten years, have been surrounded by
the pressures of right opportunism at
all times, that tactically we made left
mistakes, because today to ﬁght some-

times for Labor’s League for P0-
litical Education, or COPE, in certain
locals would be considered left, be-
cause Hutcheson and the carpenters
don’t want it.

The question is, how you ﬁght. In
the painters union, in the last three
years, not one single progressive ac-
tion was taken in reference to the Ne-
gro people’s ﬁght for desegregation.
Years ago, they did. Is that right or
left? To give out a leaﬂet, regardless
what it is, could be considered leftist.

I want to remind the delegates of
the following: The history of our
Party has been the history of our
struggles against American imperial-

ism, and its corruption of American

workers with opportunism. Lenin
spoke of that bond between imperial-
ism and opportunism. The receipt of
the high monopoly proﬁts by the capi-
talists makes it economically possible
for them to corrupt certain sections of
the American working class. And our
American Communist Party remains
free from the ravages of parasitism that
afflict the working class of the na-
tion? Of course not! We are an integ-
ral part of the American working class.
We beneﬁt from its strong points, and
we suffer from its weakness. My con-
clusion is that, while left sectarianism
may lead to right opportunism, but
right opportunism and left sectarian-
ism comes from the concepts and the
poison of our capitalist class. (Ap-
plause.)

Ch.: I just want to remind the dele-
gates that there are two reports that
we are d1S-CL'lSS1I1g now. On the second,

there is no majority or minority re-
port.

Celeste (California): I rise as a mem-
ber of this committee to support the
majority report. I would like ﬁrst to
call the attention of the delegates to a
very important paragraph which was
not read to this body in the ﬁrst sec-
tion of the report by the Chairman
of our sub-committee. It is the last
paragraph underlined on the ﬁrst page
which you got, which ﬁxes some of
the responsibility with regard to the
errors made, a major share of it on
the national leadership of the Party. I
read: “While these errors (speaking
of the left sectarian errors of the dec-
ade) were the property of the Party
as a whole, a major burden of responsi-
bility must fall upon the leadership
of our Party, who were in the main re-
sponsible for the formulation of these
sectarian policies and estimates without
the widest consultation of the member-
ship. On most occasions, the general
membership did not have an opportu-
nity to express their opinion on these
questions, so that these policies re-
ﬂected—not the collective estimate of
the entire Party—but rather the think-
ing of the leadership itself. Had the
leadership fully understood the role the
membership could have played, many
of these mistakes could have been
avoided, or corrected more quickly.”

We also added, in speaking of the

inconsistency in the struggle against

sectarianism during this period, the
following sentence above: “More-
over, the political struggle against sec-
tarianism was undermined, and in fact,
contradicted, by the continuation of

the organizational policies which flowed
from the National Committee’s 1951
decisions on the system of leadership.”
It is our judgment that this viewpoint
represents the viewpoint of the over-
whelming majority of our membership
on this question, in terms of making
sure that these errors are not heaped
on the back of the membership alone,
but in the ﬁrst place, must be assumed
by the responsible leadership of the
Party.

Secondly, I want to address myself
to the main direction before the Party
in the essence of this report of the
majority of the committee. On this
question, I come from a state where
there has been a very broad area of
unity and agreement, and where I
trust there will continue to be so. But
I think we must understand that such
unity and agreement can be brought
about, not on an unprincipled basis,
but on the basis of the widest discus-
sion, out of which ﬁnally we do have
to make decisions. And we cannot,
unfortunately, on a matter of this fun-
damental nature, have our cake and
eat it, too, much as we might desire to
do so.

I sympathize with those of the dele-
gates who ﬁnd themselves in a posi-
tion where they would like to do this,
but unfortunately, comrades, political
life is not always so comfortable or so
easy, and for the responsible dele-
gates to the highest body of our Party,
we have the responsibility to make this
decision we have failed to make clearly
over the last ten year period. We must
decide what is the direction our Party
is going in.

 

I72 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

We are, I know, agreed that it must
move to overcome its isolation as its
main task. This is not so much the
problem. The problem is, what is the
main obstacle to be overcome to over-
come our isolation. And this, our report
holds, is the continued existence of left
sectarianism in the Party, which is with
us today, and will be with us when we
leave this convention, irrespective of
the resolution that we pass. It’s going
to require a protracted and stubborn
struggle to eliminate this.

Which is not to say that there are not
right dangers. There are. I have seen
them; I have even tried, in a small
way, to deal with them——for example,
in the ﬁeld of economics. We will con-
tinue to have to deal with these ques-
tions, and the second report which was
introduced here inserted a formulation
on revisionism, for this reason. But
we must not blunt the main direction
in which we must strike our blow.
Otherwise, we will repeat on a grand
scale that 1952 resolution, into which

all people could read all things, de-

pending on how they wanted to look at
it. I am sure you comrades remem-
ber this sad experience.

I think we have enough wisdom here
to make a deﬁnite decision, and I urge
that we do so by adopting this re-
port. (Applause.)

C/1.: Will the members of the steer-
ing committee please come to the
front?

Steve Nelson (Western Penna.):
Comrade Chairman and comrade dele-
gates: I missed the 1950 convention,
although I was elected a delegate, be-
cause I could not get permission. The

courts prevented me from coming to
that convention. Today I’m here as a
delegate from Pittsburgh, but as far as
the convention is concerned, I am
permitted to appear here in behalf of
us who are about to go on trial in
Pittsburgh, to make an appeal on be-
half of our cases, that is, our Smith
Act trial that’s going to begin soon.

In the meantime, until we come to
that, I’d like to make some comments
on the point before the house. I think,
comrades, what we need here in this
discussion is not just blind and well-
meaning appeals at all times on unity,
which I’m for, and I think we’ll get it,
but let’s also know where we’re going.
On the ﬁrst point that was reported
here by Comrade Schneiderman, on
the nature of our errors, unless we
make clear what these errors were, it’s
going to be impossible, merely be-
cause we agree with the main objec-
tive, to Find the right path.

It seems to me that unless we make
that point at this convention clear,
both on a theoretical level as well as in
our tactical application, we’re not going
to be able to make the correction which
our Party has a chance to make at the
present time.

You say that we made left sectar-
ian errors, and we say we did. Com-
rades, we’ve done that from the time
our Party was organized. V

Comrade Pat sits behind me here,
who knows that when the National
Miners Union was organized, it had a
point in its program for a dictatorship
of the proletariat in the United States
—a miners union, mind you. When a
“Save the Union” committee of the

miners was organized, it had a point
that it had to recognize the Commu-
nist Party as the Party of the working-
class, and when the secretary refused
to accept that, he had to be removed
from that position. I saw this individ-
ual the other day. He said, “See?
When are you going to learn?”

Comrades, that’s the issue before us.
We’re paying for those mistakes made
in the early ’twenties, and the late
‘twenties, and the ’thirties, and now
we have the chance to make that cor-
rection.

Yes, as a result of discussion in the
world Communist movement, and as a
result of a certain loosening of certain
strings that were tying us down-that
is being broken down, and therefore
I think this convention is going to see
that We’re going to ﬁght¥—yes—against
the right danger wherever it appears,
but the main danger now has been
these left sectarian errors, and that we
have to see.

Can I mention just three points?
What did we do in 1948? We said
that the P.P. had to be organized even
if the labor movement isn't in. In
1950, we said fascism was coming,
when the unions were free, the mass or-
ganizations were free—the only ones
that were being driven underground
were us, at that time. We accepted
that drive underground ourselves. What
was that? Left errors, comrades.

And that doesn't mean that there
weren’t any right errors. I can men-
tion a real lulu in 1949, when we were
arrested in Pittsburgh first, the Dis-
trict Committee decided that the best
defense of these comrades is by de-
fending the Party, and we were left to

stand trial by ourselves. (Applause.)

[Motion for extension of time—speaker
declines]

Carl Winter: Comrades, the presiding
committee wishes to remind the convention
that you adopted a special order of busi-
ness to take effect 45 minutes ago. You
are now almost four and a half hours he-
hind schedule.

Therefore, the presiding committee

‘urges that we suspend all other business,

return to the special order which you
have adopted, and call now for the cre-
dentials committee’s report, to be followed
by a report of the constitution committee
on the method of election of the National
Committee, after which we shall hear the
proposals of the Election Committee on na-
tional leadership.

A Delegate: Are we coming back to this
discussion?

Ch.: I would assume, on the basis of the
adopted order of business, that you would,

after you complete the other special re-
port.

[Further procedural discussion.]

C/1.: We will proceed with the re-
port of the Credentials Committee.
I call on Charlene Alexander of Cali-
fornia.

C/mrlene Alexander: 25 states are
represented, with 298 delegates, *1
fraternal delegate, 26 alternates, 165
guests; 209 male delegates, 78 fe-
male delegates; 54 Negro delegates, 2
Mexican delegates, 1 Puerto Rican.
The age breakdown is as follows:
from the age group 18-25 :5 delegates;
2635: 39; 36-45: 126; 4655: 90; 56
65: 14; over 65, 5. Not given: 4.
(Laughter.) The length of time in
the Party: 5 years or under, 6; 6-10
years: 30; 11-15 years: 27; 16-20
years: 65; 21-25 years: 83; over 25
years: 72. Not given: 

[A number of the registration
blanks were incomplete.]

As much as we could break it
down, these were the Party posts rep-
resented: national leadership: 15;
state leadership: 55; county leader-
ship: 37; section leadership: 24; club
chairmen: 15; regional leaders: 2;
youth committee: 5. There were 50
Smith Act victims.

This is an incomplete breakdown
of various areas of work, since it was
impossible to break them all down.
Farmers, 3; members of trade un-

\ions, 80; people in Negro work, 34;

in Mexican work, 2; students, 1;
community organizations, 27; Jew-
ish work, 5.

The credentials committee heard
and acted upon some problems and
challenges presented to it. The re-
port from those challenges and prob-
lems follows: Some delegations‘ had
vacancies because the elected dele-
gates were unable to attend. In these
cases, the persons next in line and
approved by their delegations were
seated. In one section of the Bronx,
there were two elections for conven-
tion delegates. The second election
upset the ﬁrst. The two people
elected from each of the sessions ap-
pealed to the credentials committee
to decide which was the legal dele-
gate. The committee voted to seat
the delegate from the second election
and to unseat the comrade from the
ﬁrst. A comrade from an Up-state
New York section made a challenge
of the seated delegate. The chal-
lenge was denied by the committee,

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

and the original delegate remained
seated. The challenger was given
alternate status, with voice but no
vote.

There was a challenge to the seat-
ing of the New York at—large dele-
gation. The proposals made by this
challenge were:

I) The recommendation that this
convention order an investigation in-
cluding an immediate recount of the
ballots.

The credentials committee was in-
formed that a sub-committee of the
National Committee had already
been formed to investigate this ques-
tion.

2) The recommendation is that
pending the completion of this in-
vestigation all Delegates-at—large from
the New York delegation be tempor-
arily seated with voice but no vote.

The committee voted against this
proposal with a vote of 5 against
and 3 abstentions. The committee
voted unanimously against the un-
seating of that delegation.

3) The recommendation that this
Convention reject and condemn the
false press reports being circulated
which are a slander of our whole
Party.

The Credentials Committee would
recommend that the Convention ac-
cept this recommendation.

In another appeal comrades asked
to be seated where there were vacan-
cies. However, there were no duly
elected delegates to those seats and

 

‘V g—— nu Ill \v FT V‘ '

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 175

the committee did not feel it could
ﬁll seats that were left vacant by
their state conventions. Therefore
the committee voted to deny the ap-

peal.
We move the adoption of this re-

port.

[The Credentials report is ac-
cepted with 12 abstentions.]

C/2.: We will now hear from Sub-
Committee No. 6 on General Reso-
lutions. Comrade Kushner of Illi-
nois.

Sam Kushner: The Committee on
General Resolutions submits to the
convention at this time a resolution
on changing the national headquar-
ters city of our Party (Applause.)

For a number of years, proposals
have been under consideration or dis-
cussion to return the national head-
quarters of our Party to Chicago,
where our Party was founded:

Whereas, ours is a very large coun-

i try, and our Party headquarters

should be centrally located and rela-
tively easily accessible from all parts
of the country; and

Whereas, since our Party is
primarily based on the working class
and the poor farmers, its main oﬂice
should be located in the heartland
of industrial America, and near its
major agricultural areas, and

Whereas the re-location of our
National Oﬁice in Chicago would
place our leadership closer to the
areas of basic industry, steel, auto,
rubber, packing and so forth, areas

in which large concentrations of Ne-
gro industrial workers play an impor-
tant role in key unions, linking the
labor and Negro people’s movements,
as Well as being closer to the major
farm regions and organizations;
therefore be it

Resolved: that this National Con-
vention instruct the incoming Na-
tional Committee to move the na-
tional headquaters to Chicago With-
in the period of one year.

On behalf of the committee, I
move its adoption. [Vote taken.]

C/2.: It is so ordered.

At this time the Chair is informed
that the committee that has been
working to see if they can reach
some unanimous agreement on the
majority—minority report is ready to
report, and we recognize Sid Stein.

Sid Stein: We are happy to report
that, with the assistance of some
comrades from many delegations, we
have reached unanimous agreement
to ‘the amendments to this section
of the resolution. (Applause.)

It consists of three paragraphs
that will precede the section ‘en-
titled “Nature of the Errors,” page
53. I now read the proposed section
as amended:

“In our struggle for a mass policy,
we base ourselves on the following,
Marxist—Leninist propositions: (a)
that both left—sectarianism and right-
opportunism have objective roots in
reality—in the system under which
we live; (b) that the struggle must

  

 

I76

 

be conducted on both fronts, with
the main emphasis against that
which threatens the Marxist line of
our Party at the given moment.
“The most important mistakes made
in the period under review were left-
sectarian in character. These left-
sectarian mistakes, in the context of
sharp attack against the Party, are
the main reason for the unprece-
dented degree to which it was pos-
sible for Big Business and its political
representatives to isolate the Party.
“To end its isolation, and expand
its mass work, the main task of the
Party today is to overcome completely
the influence of left-sectarian esti-
mates, policies and tactics in all ﬁelds
of work. A
"In the process of carrying out the
main task, the Party must struggle
against existent right—opportu‘nist
tendencies, comhattin g them at all
times. This is especially necessary
in view of the extremely sharp turn
which the Party is now making in
many of its basic policies. The neces-
sary struggle against right-opportu-
nist errors must be carried on in such
a way as not to weaken the main
task.”
These are the amendments.
move adoption. (Applause.)
A Delegate: Comrades, I move the
unanimous adoption of this section
of the report. (Applause.)
Ch.: All right, we have the report
of the committee, and it has been
properly moved and seconded. Are

we ready for the question? The ques-
tion has been called for. [Vote
taken]. The vote is virtually unani-
mous.

Ch.: Next is the report of the

Committee on Leadership and Elec-
tions. I call on Helen Winter of
Michigan.
..Helen Winter: We don’t have a
written out report which would
have all the i’s dotted and all the
t’s crossed, and I hope that it will
be possible for me to present this in
a brief and concise form and at the
same time have the significance
which the Committee expressed.
Your Committee on Leadership and
Elections met a number of times.
We lost track of the hour. It was
imbued with a desire to make ascri-
ous contribution, in sharply chang-
ing and improving the methods and
form of leadership and system of
leadership under which we have
been functioning for a long period
of time. At this point all I can say
is that I hope we have at least been
partially successful in making such
a contribution. The committee
wanted to, and it worked very hard
in an effort to do so.

Now, ﬁrst we had some general
discussion on the question of the
problems before us, what it was we
had to solve, to improve the methods
of work, the composition, and the
system of leadership. And we at-
tempted to set forth a number of
guiding principles. First and fore-

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 177

most we believe that the incoming
National Committee must as fully
as is possible express the policies
determined by this convention, but
that no point of view should be
eliminated. In other words, all points
of view should be included in the
incoming leadership.

Secondly, there must be some seri-
ous changes in the leadership. Par-
ticularly is it necessary to bring in
new forces in a serious effort to re-
fresh our leadership. Now how can
this be done? We are confronted
with a number of very thorny and
diﬂicult problems. We believe that
it is necessary to strive to bring
into leadership a group of comrades
that have strong ties with the Party
organization and the Party member-
ship, that have strong ties with the
working class, the trade union
movement and the Negro people’s
movement. We believe there must
be emphasis on comrades from shops,
comrades active in mass work and

comrades who are representative of

all important sectors of the popula-
tion of our country.

Now we are confronted with some
problems in this connection and we
have to face up to them. We are
not in a position where it is possible
for us to nominate, elect and have
a person accept a position in the Na-
tional Committee who may be work-
ing in a shop in basic industry.
There happens to be legislation

which is repressive in character and
which does not permit them. There-
fore, what we Want to try to do at‘.
this convention is to make improve-
ments far beyond what we have at?
the present time and to simultanc-r
ously conduct a struggle for full
legality for our Party so that in the
future we may be able to overcome
this obstacle. Therefore, we have to
recognize that while we may not be
able to elect here comrades from
shops or from certain important sec-
tions of our population, nonetheless
we can elect comrades who have
strong ties with them, who live and
work daily among them and who
therefore in a sense represent them.

Then we believe it is necessary to
elect a cadre, a national leadership
which is fully capable of making
the turn which this convention is
determined to make and which
will make a serious effort to over-
come all past errors and put our
Party on the correct path to progress
and in our work for socialism.

Now, there are some new features
of our elections at this convention
which it isn’t necessary to present
and discuss. I would like to call
your attention to the fact that the
committee working on certain sec-
tions of the Constitution will come
in later on with some constitutional
provisions which will take care of
elections at conventions after this.
What I am attempting to do there-

fore is only to handle the present
situation.

A new feature will be that unlike
the past there will be on the present
National Committee representation
from districts. That will also give
the committee a new quality. Now
I would like to say a few words with
respect to composition. There have
been strong demands, and rightly
so, that there should be brought into
the National Committee additional
Negro comrades, particularly Negro

‘ women comrades, and that we should

be refreshed also with a larger num-
ber of young comrades. This is neces-
sary and our committee urges upon
you in making your nominations
to bear this in mind. We would only
like to sound one little warning
note, and that is that there should
be serious and down to earth con-
sideration in making your nomina-
tions, because it is possible to im-
prove the composition so that it
appears good, but when it comes
right down to brass tacks it may be
that these comrades are not in a po-
sition to fulﬁll their obligations.
And therefore let’s not just consider
this for the sake of composition, but
let’s consider it also for the sake of
content and for the sake of quality.
And I am sure that the comrades
will appreciate the fact that this is
what the committee intends.
Finally, I would like to deal brief-
ly with the question of style of work
of the leadership. In the past there

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

has been a development which has
been commonly called bureaucratic
where a limited group of full—time
workers usurped the responsibilities
of the National Committee. Now I
don’t want to go into all the reasons
for this here. I am not blaming
necessarily the comrades who were
in this position. In fact I think it
would be a serious setback on our
part if we would give such a con—
notation to it. We have had a situa-
tion where we have worked in a
very difficult way over a long period
of time with some members of the
National Committee in jail, some
still in jail, others having taken over
their responsibilities, and working in
various ways which in some re—
spects created quite a crisis in this
particular respect.

But what we want to do now is
to guarantee that our leadership is
not based upon the full—time work-
ers, that our leadership is within
the National Committee itself, with
the full—time workers determined by
the National Committee and respon-
sible to the National Committee for
everything they do. Now I don’t
know whether it is necessary for me
to elaborate any more or not. I think
that we should understand—I am
sure it is true in all of the districts
—that there has been considerable
discussion on this particular qucsr
tion and I believe it has been fairly
well thrashed out.

Now in an effort to pin down ex-

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION I79

actly what our committee believes
the incoming National Committee
should comprise, we have tried to
put it in several different sections.
First, with respect to size. It was
considered that the committee should
be considerably larger than the out-
going committee. On this there
were proposals from some districts,
I believe just one or two, and from
a number of individuals. These pro—
posals varied from a committee of
35 to a much broader and larger
committee of 100. Your committee
in discussing this matter considered
that the majority opinion which had
been expressed prior to the conven-
tion as well as in the committee was
for a committee of 60.

It was further agreed by your
committee to recommend to this con-
vention that one—third of the total
number of members on the commit-
tee should be elected at large, that
is, by this Convention, and two-
thirds to be elected by districts.
Now, a few words of explanation.
If our convention had taken place
after a Constitution was adopted to
this effect, we would have known
about this provision and we would
have made provision for the election
of the two-thirds by districts to take
place in the state conventions. That
did not happen. Only one or two
districts came to this convention
prepared by a mandate of their dis-
trict conventions to put names in
nomination. Therefore, we found it

necessary to propose a certain pro-
cedure as to how this should be done
at the present convention.

The first proposal, therefore, is
that the National Committee should
be in size 60 members. Secondly,
this should be elected one—third by
the convention and two-thirds by the
districts. Third, that the rep-resenta-
tive of the National Committee from
the district be elected at this con-
vention by district caucuses, so in in-
stances where the district caucuses
cannot complete their full comple-
ment of representation, they com-
plete it at the next session of their
state conventions. Now there will
be a provision made later on as to
how this will all ﬁt together. Fourth,
the representation from districts for
the National Committee shall be ap-
portioned as follows: that is, the two-
thirds—I had better insert here, just
so there’s no fussing around about
it that when we say 60, we are not
going to quibble over whether it’s
59 or 61. We are attempting to ap-
proach a target, and the same goes
for the one—third and the two-thirds:
New York—1I; Ca1ifornia—5; Illi-
nois———4; New Jersey, Eastern Penn.,
Michigan, Ohio, and the South-
2 each; New England, Western
Penn., Maryland, Indiana, Wiscon-
sin, Connecticut, Minnesota and the
Dakotas, Oregon, Rocky Mountain
area, Washington—Idaho——I each.

Now, your committee had consid-
erable discussion about this. It is

 

 

180 . PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

evident that we would not have
adequate representation from vari-
ous parts of the country including
the industrial heartland in the mid-
west if we were going to proceed
with respect to this apportionment
on the basis of proportional repre-
sentation. Therefore we attempted
to apportion the representation in
what appeared to us to be the most
reasonable possible method, and we
hope that it is satisfactory.

I have several more motions. Next

~motion, that this convention declare

its desire to include in the National
Committee comrades now on the
National Committee who are now
serving prison terms due to their
unconstitutional imprisonment for
working class political leadership,
namely the Smith Act. We therefore
authorize the incoming National
Committee to add to its membership
over and above the 60, from among
those comrades, as soon as they are
able to serve and express their per-
sonal agreement to do so.

Next (I’m sorry that it is neces-
sary to put this next question in the
form of a negative point, but we
could not ﬁgure out how to do it
any other way and if anybody has
something better to offer, we’ll ac-
cept it I’m sure), that at this conven-
tion we do not elect general officers.

Next, this is the thorn which has
taken so much time and we believe
the great majority of the committee
agreed, although there were some

that did not agree, and let’s see if
we can work this out so that it really
is understandable and we get the
sense of it across. The 20 members-
at—large of the National Committee
elected at this convention meet as a
nominating committee for a tempor-
ary secretariat of 7 members to be
approved by this convention. That’s
the motion. Now, an explanation.
When the election of the district rep—
resentatives has been completed,
which should be no later than
March 31st, then the full national
committee will meet. It will elect
its permanent executive body, wheth-
er it be a secretariat, a board, or a
group of oﬂicers, and at that time
the temporary secretariat will be re-
leased.

Next, there is a motion to instruct
the incoming National Committee
to move its headquarters to the in-
dustrial heartland of our country,
namely, Chicago.

Finally, we have a sub—committee
which was working on the question
of nominating and election procedure
that will report after we have taken
care of the various propositions that
I have placed before you.

Now, on behalf of the officers of
the Leadership and Elections Com-
mittee, I want to give sincere thanks
to the very excellent participation,
desire for unity, desire to make a
serious eﬁcort to solve the various
problems of leadership of our Party
that was exhibited by all members

 

 

 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

of the Leadership and Elections
Committee.

I move the adoption of this re-
port.

A Delegate: Point of information: in
dealing with the question of repre-
sentation, the State of Missouri has been
left out and I wonder are we going
to have representation or are we to be
part of the Southern Region?

Helen Winter: There is an important
point I left out. Our committee, in
discussing the question of some of the
smaller areas, agreed that a district
organization that had a membership
of under I00 should not be included
in this representation.

Mike (South): As a member of the
Elections Committee I want to correct
an error which I believe crept into
the report.

In the method of selection of the 40
members of the National Committee
who are to be designated by the dis-
tricts it was the feeling, I believe,
of the majority of the members of the
Elections Committee that they were to
be elected by their district conventions
and not by caucuses here, in the sense
of the greater democratization of the
selection of our leadership and also I
believe it is not necessary to belabor
the point. I want to make only this
point that it is the sense of the com-
mittee that that is the method that
would be recommended and not elect-
ing by caucuses here.

George Watt: In clariﬁcation of this
point, there was a difference of inter-
pretation as this comrade just reported.
However, at the last minute just be-
fore we came in here a motion was

181

made and carried by the majority
of the members of the committee that
there be no election of the delegates
from the districts at this convention,
but that they be held at the subse-
quent state conventions. That is a cor-
rection of the report, and the comrade
who just made it is correct. This ques-
tion is before you for discussion.

A Delegate: Point of information:
The reporter stated that this conven-
tion will elect a temporary secretariat
of 7 until the end of March, I be-
lieve was the date, at which time the
National Committee in full session will
then proceed and the reporter said to
elect a secretariat," general officers or a
board. I know that the reporter was
being general on the question. What
I am interested in is who determines
at what point, where, exactly what
the National Committee will be elect-
ing when it convenes in full session at
the end of March?

George Watt: Exactly as the motion
stated. I want to correct one thing.
The way the motion reads at the pres-
ent time is that the 20 members-at-
large elected here at this convention
will serve as a nominating committee
for a temporary secretariat. With re-
gard to the second part of the question,
that is left open to be covered by the
temporary character of the committee.
The understanding of the Elections
Committee was that at such time as the
full National Committee assembles,
then the National Committee can then
decide what kind of collective body
it wants to set up to carry out its func-
tion, whether it be a secretariat, a,
board or some officers.

 

182

The Delegate: I don’t want to take
up the time of the committee but
would suggest to the Presiding Com-
mittee that there is a gap here which
should be explained to the convention,
that is, how did they arrive at the de-
cision as to whether there are general
oﬂicers or a secretariat or a board or
any combination of these, how will this
be determined, or did this body eﬂect
such a decision.

C/1.: It is the understanding of the
chair on the basis of the information

- given that it’s left to the National Com-

mittee, because no other recommenda-
tion has been made, unless this conven-
tion wants to change it. This is the
highest body and you can make any
changes in the report.

The Delegate: Wasn’t there a recom-
mendation made that no general of-
ﬁcers will be elected?

C/2.: That does not apply to what the
Committee might do after March 31st.
This report is only up until the end of
March when the full National Commit-
tee will convene. Now, are we ready
for discussion?

]ames Iacksonz I want to speak in
support of the proposition contained in
the report of the Elections Committee,
particularly in regard to the election
of the National Committee and the
bases on which the National Commit-
tee is to be elected and the composition
and distribution of principles proposed.
I want to support wholeheartedly the
proposition that this election would
elect one-third of the projected 6o mem-
bers of the National Committee and
that two-thirds or 40 of these 60 mem-
bers would be elected by mandate of

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the now-recessed state conventions. I
want to support further the proposition
proposed by the committee on the dis-
tribution which in my opinion is a fair
distribution of National Committee
members to be elected by the respective
states and would largely take into ac-
count the necessities of adequate geog-
raphical representation and the oppor-
tunity for better composition.

I think that the powers of this con-
vention are fully adequate by resolu-
tion action to allow for this form of the
election of the National Committee.
And I would anticipate and respond
to any objections to this procedure on
constitutional grounds. The constitu-
tion to be adopted as has already been
indicated will be a constitution to gov-
ern and direct our conventions and
our Party procedures subsequent to the
termination of this convention. There-
fore the rules and regulations would
be for purposes of this election elabor-
ated and authorized by this conven-
tion.

Now, I just want to speak in sup-
port of agreed procedure by the com-
mittee for the election of a National
Committee and it is my belief that this
procedure will be welcomed by the
membership which is in the process of
very fundamental reformation in the
inner democracy and other aspects of
the inner life and outward look of our
Party, and is therefore in full conﬁrma-
tion with the democratic will and
aspirations of the membership of the
Party.

For these reasons and because it will
serve the best interests of fostering
unity in our Party I fully endorse this

 



 

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 183

projected plan for the election of the
National Committee..

A Delegate: Comrades, I am also a
member of the Elections Committee.

_I want to speak on two points. One is

the relationship of objective conditions
in our country to the nature of our
leadership, and the second one is the
question referred to on representation,
Negro, women and youth.

On the general question, first I would
like to say, comrades, that I am one
of those people who believe that the
major errors in our organization can
be attributed to objective conditions.
That includes all the other weaknesses.
I also would like to point out that the
question of full-timers and utilizing
full-timers in leading positions is not
a characteristic of our organization. It
is a characteristic of American organi-
zations generally, and is not an alien
concept. It is a bad concept, but any
of you who are in a trade union and
know the relationship of the business
agent to the executive board know all
about full-timer usurpation of leader-
ship. So I wish that we would recog-
nize this question for what it is—a
question of a bourgeois characteristic
that has to be fought as such.

On the other question of Negro,
women and younger members—as a
former youth leader—incidentally in
New York—I’m glad I’m out of it—
out of New York, that is (laughter),
I’d like to say that there has been a
tendency in our organization over a
long period of time to try and look
around to see if they could ﬁnd a
young Negro woman and thus fulﬁll
their composition. They have a Negro,

a woman and a youth and they all feel
better. And I maintain that this is not
a problem to be able to show people
in our composition, in writing, that we
have one Negro, one woman, and one
youth. I maintain that this is a prob-
lem of guaranteeing certain inﬂuences
on our committee, and I think that
we shouldn’t be afraid and shouldn’t
emphasize too much and worry too
much that these people if they might
be a little immature, can hurt us any

-more than we are now.

Finally, I want to support the re-
port as a whole of the committee and
end by urging all delegations not to
be diverted by the fact that two-thirds
are to be elected in the districts, not
to be diverted from the problem that
the character of our National Commit-
tee should apply to the delegates-at-
large also. Because there is a tendency
sometimes to say, “Well, we’ll take
care of it back home. It’s not so im-
portant whom we elect here.” I thank
you.

Iames Ford (New York): Comrades,
I can be very brief. I want to support
the report with regard to the election
of our National Committee, with re-
spect to its democratic procedure, with
respect to the suggestion for composi-
tion and in general I want to support
the report with regard to the election
of the N.C. And meanwhile I want
to withdraw a proposal which I made
sometime during the beginning of this
discussion, both in the Daily Worker
and to the National Board, with respect
to the election of a Negro in the na-
tional leadership of our Party, but I
must give my reasons for at that time

 

:84

making that proposal. At that time I
had a feeling after many years in the
Party, after we had developed many
splendid leaders in our Party among
the Negro people, that there was a lack
of equality of leadership with respect to
Negro leaders, a lack of authority, and
also that this lack of authority expressed
itself among the Negro people to the
point that many times they openly
stated to individual members and
otherwise that Negroes had no authority
in our Party. I think they do and I
think that will be respected.

I also want to say that at that time
I felt, and over the period of years
I still think it prevails, that we have
had three crises in our Party and that
these crises have affected the leader-
ship among Negroes, and some of it has
not yet been resolved. Mainly in the
question of the attitude of playing
one Negro against another, or groups
of Negroes against another. I think
that our national leadership should
take this under consideration when they
get down to the election of a national
leadership. I therefore had intended
to propose to the national constitution
committee that if there were secretaries
of our Party, at least one should be a
Negro with equal authority. I with-
draw that.

Martha Stone (New ]er5ey): Com-
rades, I think that all of the delegates
to begin with should appreciate the
problem that the Leadership Commit-
tee had under the conditions where
unlike all other committees, there was
not the necessary attention and work
to this aspect of the problem as we
gave to sections of the Draft Resolu-

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

tion. So I think it is necessary to ex-
ert the maximum of discipline and pa-
tience in an attempt to resolve some
problems. It is my own opinion, com-
rades, that the most desirable thing
for our Party to culminate our con-
vention with a feeling of unity and a
detennination of its personnel through
the election of a National Committee,
that the best thing possible would be
if we were able at this convention to
elect through district caucuses, repre-
sentatives from districts to the Na-
tional Committee, supplementing those
elected at-large.

Now, I think those comrades who
raise the point that the state conven-
tions should be the place where this is
done, are absolutely sound and correct
in terms of the future. But for this
convention I think it would be a big
gap and serious weakness if we were
to culminate our debates on policy
without the determination of the per-
sonnel. We did not have enough time
in this committee, resulting in out
not having accurate enough information
from all of the districts. This had to
do with the status whether the district
caucuses were in a position to elect.
There were some districts who in the
beginning said they were not, and
they have changed their opinion. It
seems to me that if this aspect was
referred to the Presiding Committee,
that given a little of time and a check
with the districts, I think we would be
able to ascertain this fact and resolve it.
Because I think the needs of our Party
require that in the election of a pro-
posed temporary secretariat submitted
to the ﬂoor to be finalized after the

SESSIONS  THE CONVENTION 185

complete National Committee is elected
through state conventions, we would
have the participation of the forces from
the districts as well as the forces that
are elected here at large. Without
that I think it would be a very un-
satisfactory situation. So I would move
that the Presiding Committee have
the opportunity to examine this as-
pect, checking with the districts in
order to ascertain the actual state of
affairs regarding the district caucuses
and their ability to elect as much of
the full complement of the delegation
as possible.

Ch.: This is an amendment to the
committee’s report. We are still dis-
cussing the report. Would you hold
that motion off?

Cal (California): Comrade chair-
man, I would like first to comment
that I appreciate the chairman’s ex-
cellent point regarding the need for

. brevity in this discussion.

There has been a great deal of talk
at this convention thus far regarding
the nature of our errors and the need
for change. It is my feeling that this
report, with which I am in full sup-
port, will bring a different kind of
wind into this convention, a very fresh
spring breeze. Because it provides a
basis for a leadership which is drawn
from the regions where our members
are located, where they have their ex-
perience. It provides a basis for draw-
ing in a leadership which maintains
the various points of view and I hope
that is the will of the convention to
endorse the election of the 20 delegates
at large that are proposed, but it also
provides a basis for introducing a num-

ber of non-full-time people onto the Na-
tional Committee who will be able to
bring their experiences to the N.C., with
the working class, with the mass or-
ganizations, etc. This is something We
need badly at this time, because the
changes we are talking about are not
simply problems that have to do with
whether the words are this way or that
way or the other way. These changes
are practical things that have to be
worked out by a practical group of peo-
ple with experience in the field, with
contact with the masses.

I would like to call the attention of
the convention to one of the very im-
portant parts of this report which
deserves special consideration. This is
that part of the report which has to
do with the election of top leadership.
You will note - that we have called
in the report for not electing a chair-
man and secretary at this convention
but rather for developing a secretariat
on an interim basis to be eventually
replaced with oﬂicers elected by the
National Committee after they have
learned to work together in behalf
of this program. This, I feel, is the
kind of an approach which can _suc-
cessfully bring forward the prosecution
of the program which we seek.

Hal Simon (New York): Comrades,
I think that the amendment which I
will submit at the appropriate moment,
if it isn’t now, will be along the fol-
lowing lines: that when the full Na-
tional Committee convenes and releases
the temporary secretariat, it is my opin-
ion that the National Committee at that
time should only be empowered to
elect another -group of permanent sec-

 

    

I86

retaries and not to elect general na-
tional olﬁcers, such as a chairman or
general secretary. It is my feeling
that such a decision should only be
made by another session of this con-
vention, or at the next convention of
the Party.

I say this is in conformity with what
the intent of the committee’s report
was. The committee stated in its re-
port to this convention, that even
though it may be desirable, we should
not at this convention elect a national
chairman or a secretary. I agree with
that even though I feel it would be
desirable if we could do so, but the
reason why we cannot do so at this
time is because there are no individ-
uals in my opinion either for national
chairman or secretary around whom
the whole Party could unite as a re-
sult of the divergence of opinion that
has been expressed in the debate
prior to the convention.

I think that’s the reason why we
are not electing a national chairman
and secretary A at this particular mo-
ment, and therefore I feel that it should
be clear in this convention that because
that is the situation—it will not change
two months from now—that we need
an opportunity to examine the vari-
ous comrades who participate in the
national leadership and otherwise on
the basis of their political position, on
the basis of program, on the basis of
their activity in helping break our
Party out of its isolation. And the
subsequent convention, with all of us
assembled, can determine then much
more clearly whom we want to elect
as the chairman and general secretary.

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

I think that an amendment is needed
to the report to clear up this particular
point and when the appropriate time
comes, I shall so move.

AZ (New York): I ﬁnd myself in
agreement with a good part of the re-
port of the committee, but I think
it should be somewhat stronger. If as
it is said here and as it is said in the
Draft Resolution, we are in the most
serious crisis in our Party brought
about by some serious weaknesses
which are mainly the responsibility
of the leadership, then I believe this
leadership should be completely rc-
constituted because I think that re-
freshing, adding a few faces, or shift-
ing around like migratory workers, of
full-time functionaries here and there
will not solve the problem. I was a
full time functionary from 1938 to
laﬂllary 1955 when I went to jail.
find it took some serious thinking
in two years in jail for me to fully
appreciate how far away I had gotten
from the non-Party masses and how
operating in inner-Party work, dealing
with loyal Party members was able
to breed bureaucracy, and I believe I
became a good bureaucrat. Let me
just speak for myself. And I believe
the most refreshing thing that could
happen to our Party leaders, to
strengthen them, the bulk of them, as
well as to strengthen the Party, is to
send them back to the point of pro-
duction.

Now there seems to be a theory pass-
ing around which I call “the cult of the
present leadership” and that is, people
will say, “Well, whom are we going
to have as leaders? There are security

problems.” Well, one of the Ways of
solving the security problem is to take
a number of good shop workers out of
the shops and put them in as full-time
functionaries, and have the full-time
functionaries except those who are
physically unable, go to work. And I
think it would be very good, if we
adopted an old procedure whereby after
so long a period as a full-time func-
tionary it would be mandatory for a

Party leader to go back to the point.

of production. I believe also the past
year, the serious crisis that faced the
world-—I think the test of a Party
leadership is not how it writes resolu-
tions or makes speeches, but how it’s
able to stand up in such a serious
crisis. And I’m not talking here now
about physical courage. But I say
in the past period, especially in the
Hungarian situation, the majority of
our National Committee lost their
bearings, and as far as I am concerned,
have lost their right to be members of
the National Committee.

I think this proposal about the
Smith Act victims, that the only ones
who have a right to bejcandidates for
the National Committee, are those who
are now National Committee members,
is a violation of the democratic rights
of the Party members. My opinion
is that anyone that’s in jail that the
people want to nominate for the Na-
tional Committee should be nomi-
nated and then with their agreement
they can serve or not serve. But I
think that every member of the Party
has a right to be nominated and not
just members of the National Commit-
tee who are in jail. There are people

in jail who are not members of the
National Committee and I have a right
to nominate them just as anyone else.

Finally, I believe the majority of
the National Committee should be
workers, or of working-class back-
ground, and lastly, I don’t think we
should fear taking the elections of the
district representatives to the National
Committee back to the conventions.
It seems to me with all this talk about
democracy, that that’s the democratic
thing to do. And I don’t believe we
should be stampeded into this busi-
ness about speed. That’s become more
important than solving the problems
of the Party.‘ So I believe that the elec-
tion of district representation should
take place at their duly convened con-
ventions. (Applause)

Iolzn Hellman (Montana): Some
small districts will not be holding con-
ventions after the national convention.
Therefore, from a procedure standpoint,
it is absolutely necessary that caucuses
of the delegates here representing those
districts or groups of districts name
their National Committee members
here. I gather from Martha's amend-
ment that this will be taken care of but
if it isn’t, we’ll have to amend it so it
can be.

cept for amendments.]

The Central Committee of the Commu-
nist Party of Mexico sends warm fraternal

 

 

 

 

 

I88 PROCEEDINGS OF r6TI-I CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

greetings to the 16th National Convention
of the Communist Party of the USA.

In transmitting the revolutionary greet-
ings of our Central Committee to your
national convention, we want to inform

' you that we are carrying on in Mexico the

struggle against North American impe-
rialism, chief exploiter and enemy of the
Mexican people. For success in this na-
tional liberation struggle the Mexican
Communist Party considers it essential to
forge the greatest anti-imperialist unity
of patriotic and democratic forces; to
build the anti-imperialist alliance of the
working class, the peasants, the middle
class and the national bourgeoisie through
a powerful Democratic Front of National
Liberation as the basic condition for over-
coming this powerful enemy and achieving
an independent, democratic and happy
life. The Democratic Front of National
Liberation will be victorious if it is based
on the ﬁghting mobilization of the masses
of the people, if it is built around the
most solid worker-peasant alliance, if it
marches under the leadership of the work-
ing class. This will happen if we_ forge
in Mexico a mighty Communist Party con-
structed on the scientiﬁc principles of
Marxism-Leninism.

Part of the historic struggles of our peo-
ples is the great battle for world peace.
This struggle is urgent and necessary be-
cause of the grave danger of the provoca-
tion of a new war by the warmongering
monopolists, chieﬂy those of the United
States. The Egyptian events and the fas-
cist-type counter-revolution launched _ in
Hungary under the direction of world im-
perialism are clear proof that the war
danger has not disappeared. This danger
has been strengthened by the policy of
your government in the Middle East ‘by
means of the Eisenhower Doctrine, which
the House of Representatives has just ap-
proved and which leads directly to war
provocation. The events toward the end
of last year, while demonstrating the grave
danger that hangs over humanity, at the
same time show that war is not inevitable.
War can be prevented since the peace camp
now has suﬂicient moral and material
strength to do so. The facts that _prove
once again that the ﬁght fol‘ Peace 15 “Qt
futile impel us to organize and develop it
with greater tenacity. _

In the struggle of the Mexican people

for national and social liberation we are
certain that we can count on the fraternal
solidarity of the North American working
class and people, guided by their revolu-
tionary vanguard, the Communist Party of
the USA, which will triumph in its strug-
gle against the people’s worst enemy, the
brutal instigator of wars, insatiable oppres-
sor of weak peoples—-North American im-
perialism. We know that ﬁghting in the
center of the leader of world reaction,
under conditions of a powerful “labor
aristocracy” which deceives the masses, the
revolutionary work of the Communist
Party of the USA is not easy. This is a very
difficult struggle that the North American
Communist Party will know how to wage
victoriously, guided by the invincible prin-
ciples of proletarian internationalism, by
the scientiﬁc, ever-new theory of Marxism-
Leninism, which has been tested in the fire
of the class struggle of the world prole-
tariat, under the most complex and varied
conditions of different countries, especially
in those where, thanks to the correct use
of that theory, the working class has
achieved power.

Under the creative guidance of Marx-
ism-Leninism, fortifying their internal
unity and their course toward the masses,
rooted in the clear-cut principle of Party
life——democratic centralism—-the Commu-
nist Parties that have not yet won power
for the working class, such as our own
Party, will emerge victorious fro-m this
great struggle and will justify historically
their existence before the working class
and people of their countries.

The Mexican people are conﬁdent that
the Communist Party of the United States,
guiding the revolutionary action of its
people, will overcome the voracious im-
perialism of your country. When that day
comes the relations of our two countries
will no longer be that of subjection and
plunder of the weaker by the stronger;
they will be fraternal relations of equality
that will greatly strengthen the deep
friendship of our two peoples.

The aggressions, the exploitation of our
raw materials and cheap labor power, the
monopoly of Mexican foreign trade, the
economic and political domination of our
country by North American imperialism,
will be things of the past, swept forever
from the stage of history by the Mexican
and North American peoples, and there

will ﬂourish the new life of friendship
and complete equality.

In this struggle that soon will bear fruit
we are inspired by the existence of the
powerful world system of socialism headed
by the great and beloved Soviet Union,
which marches in the construction of Com-
munism from victory to victory, under the
wise leadership of the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union, created by Lenin—the
party which has demonstrated its maturity
and skill in the fulfillment of the prole-
tarian revolution, in the consolidation of
its fruits and the building of socialism.

Our Party has attentively followed the .

process of discussion in preparation for the
16th National Convention of the Commu-
nist Party of the United States. We do not
hesitate to express our ﬁrm conviction that
the North American Communists, faithful
to the best traditions of the revolutionary
working-class movement in your country,
will take at this convention a decisive step
to strengthen the role of the brother Com-
munist Party of the United States as revo-
lutionary vanguard of the working class
and the North American people, developing
the Party’s internal life and political line
in accordance with Marxist-Leninist stand-
ards, the invincible foundation that guaran-
tees the inevitable victory of the Communist
Party and people of the United States in
their struggle for democracy, peace and
socialism.

At a time when in all sorts of ways
there have unfolded attempts of imperial-
ism and reaction to sow ideological con-
fusion in the ranks of the revolutionary
workers’ S movement——attempts which have
already suffered severe defeats——we Mexi-
can Communists are certain that the na-
tional convention of the Communist Party
of the USA will mark another step in the
defense and strengthening of the revolu-
tionary ideology of the proletariat in face
of the enemy maneuvers that seek to weak-
en it. That will undoubtedly be a contri-
bution of great importance to our cominon
struggle ‘for peace, against iinrperialism,
for democracy, national liberation of
peoples and for socialism. .

Great victories await the Communist
Party of the USA!

Long live the camp of peace, democ-
racy, socialism, whose main pillars are
the Soviet Union and the Chinese Peo-
ple’s Republic! Long live proletanan in-

ternationalism! Long live the fraternal
friendship of our two peoples! Long live
the Communist Party of the USA, revolu-
tionary vanguard of the working class and
people of its country!
Workers of the world, unite!
Central Committee,
Communist Party of Mexico

C /2.: We will hear from the chairman
of the Elections Committee.

Helen Winter: The committee was
handed a number of amendments,
nine to be exact. Between George Watt
and myself, we will try to explain
them. There is one amendment that
has to do with replacing any member
of the National Committee who may be
arrested or deported or unable to func-
tion for whatever reason, and the mak--
er of this amendment recommends that
a referendum be taken to replace such a
person. It is the opinion of many
members of the committee that this
rightfully belongs in the Constitution
Committee and We are referring it
there for consideration for the Consti-
tution.

There is an amendment request-
ing that Southern representation be in-
creased to 4 members rather than 2.
This is contrary to the motion and the
committee has not accepted it.

It was felt that under the present
conditions of the functioning of our
Party, that 2 representatives from the
South was the maximum that could
be secured.

There is an amendment that general
officers be elected at this convention, at
least two, one of which to be a Negro.
This is considered contrary to the in-
tent of the report.

There is an amendment which has

 

I90 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

a relation to an amendment which
Martha Stone was supposed to present.
There is no such amendment in our
hands, therefore I am simply not do-
ing anything about it.

There is an amendment that reads
as follows: In cases where districts
will not have conventions after the na-
tional convention, they should caucus
here to name their members of the
National Committee. It is agreeable
with the committee that they do so.

Then there is the following amend-
ment: When the full National Com-
mittee convenes and releases the tem-
porary secretariat, it shall only be em-
powered to elect a permanent group
of secretaries, or a secretariat, who will
work under the responsibility of the
National Committee. The election of
general officers, such as chairman and
secretary, shall not be in order until
the next convention of the Party. Now,
while our motion may not have been
quite as clear as this, it was the intent,
and therefore we are accepting this
amendment. Now Comrade Watt has
2 or 3 other amendments he will pre-
sent to you.

George Watt: We have one amend-
ment here that this convention should
end with as complete a National Com-
mittee as possible, that the state and dis-
trict caucuses make nominations sub-
ject to approval by the convention. I
believe that as the motion stands now
from our committee, that this is con-
trary to the report, and therefore can-
not be accepted.

We have an amendment here, a rath-
er long resolution, to guarantee direct
youth participation in our national

leadership, that the proposed 60 be in-
creased to include 4 youth members,
and it proposes I from California, I
from Chicago, I from the Southern
region, and I from New York. It is
the belief of the committee that we
are in sympathy with this amendment
and we feel that the intent should be
communicated through the district
delegations, so that the districts when
they elect their representatives to the
National Committee we should take
into consideration the election of
youth and we feel that, however, to
accept this as an amendment at this
time would not be a practical way to
solve this problem, and therefore we
are not accepting it as a concrete
amendment.

An amendment that the State of Mis-
souri be allowed one representative on
the National Committee and be at-
tached to either the Midwest or the
Southern region. Unfortunately, within
the yardstick measure that was set up
by the committee in adopting the sys-
tem of apportionment, Missouri does
not at this time come under that and
we feel that to accept this would open
up the door to a number of other very
small districts of equal size and would
throw out of balance the entire report
and plan that was presented here,
and therefore we are sorry to say we
reject this amendment.

I want to move now that this body
accept the report as amended.

[Motion to close debate. Chair rules
motion undebatable. Decision is appealed
by John Gates.]

John Gates: Comrades, I make this ap-
peaI——-that discussion be re-opened——for
one reason. I believe there is one point

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 191

in the report and the motion that is before
you that requires separate consideration
and which I believe ought to receive a
separate vote. And that is, that particular
section of the report that deals with the
election of a National Committee by this
national convention. As the motion now
stands, 20 members of the National Com-
mittee are to be elected at large by the
convention and 40 members are to be
elected by the -States at their respective
state conventions.

There is another proposal before this
convention, and an amendment was made
to that effect, which was not accepted
by the comimittee, that half of these 40
members to be elected by the state con-
ventions be elected here at this convention
by the respective state delegations. I
believe that this is a very serious matter
which has not received suﬂicient consid-
eration by this body. I could speak on
behalf of this particular proposal. I don’t
know whether it would be proper at this
moment. I only make the point now that
it has not received the proper considera-
tion.

What this means if the motion is passed
by you as it now stands is, that this con-
vention will elect only 20 members of a
National Committee of 60, and then a
temporary -secretariat will be elected by
these 20 members subject to the approval
of this national convention. Now I believe
that we ought to elect at least half, and
I believe more than half, of the members
of this National Comamittee at this conven-
tion. I believe also that we can do this,
elect at least half of our state representa-
tion here, and at the same time these
will be seated temporarily as members of
the National Committee, and they would
still be subject to replacement by the
various state conventions. This would cast
no reﬂection upon those delegates who
may be elected to the National Committee
here from the respective states. But I
think it would be very important that we
elect here at least half and more than half
of the members of the National Commit-
tee at a national convention of the Party.

Now, the point here is that I do not be-
lieve this important matter has received

. sulﬁcient consideration due to considera-

tions of time, to the pressures because of
the fact that we are crowded, and so on,
but I think it is such an important ques-
tion that we ought to separate this speci-

ﬁc question from the motion as a whole
and vote separately upon that section.
I think it would be in the best interests
of the Party, if we gave it that kind of
important and serious consideration which
in my opinion we have not given it so far.
I think, comrades, that we should not
approach the pro-blem of the election of
a national leadership of our Party in such
a light fashion and to not give it proper
consideration. (Applause.)

Ch.: Comrades, I will conﬁne my re-
marks simply to the facts of the pro-
cedure. The riﬂes for the convention
which you adopted and the only issue in-
volved in the challenge to the ruling of the
chair is not the substance of the question
but whether or not the chair ruled fairly
in conformity with the rules of the con-
vention which you adopted. I submit
that after question is called one must
proceed with the vote. Therefore it is my
contention that I ruled fairly in conformity
with the rules adopted by this con-
vention. That’s the only issue. (Applause.)

Parliamentarian: The vote now appears
on the motion to sustain the chair. [Vote
taken] I hereby rule that the chair has
been sustained by a big majority vote.

Ch.: Comrades, we’ll proceed with the
vote on the report of the Elections Com-
mittee as amended. [Vote taken.]

201 for the report as amended; 33
against; 8 abstentions. The report is
carried.

Comrades, Comrade Lester Davis from
the Elections Committee, will now report
on the procedure.

Lester Davis (Illinois): Before proceed.
ing with the procedures outlined by the
committee for conducting the elections, let
me hasten to say that there are no policy
questions ‘here, that we are concerned
mainly  the problem of expediting
and facilitating the elections and guaran-
teeing a fair election for all concerned.
We propose the following rules of conduct
for the elections:

We propose that nominations for dele-
gates-_at-large be made by a roll call vote
of districts represented with 2 minutes
allowed for nominating talks. And that to
the extent that it is possible, no name
should be placed in nomination until the
person making the nomination has the
agreement of the person involved that he
or she will accept the nomination and will
serve if elected.

 

    

192

That no one who is not present will be
nominated without the assurance on the
part of the person making the nomina-
tion that the nominee will accept.

That after the roll call of districts the
floor will be open for -additional nomina-
tions.

On balloting: All nominations for mem-
bers-at-large of the National Committee
shall be placed on a mimeographed ballot.
The 20 persons receiving the highest num-
ber of votes will be declared elected.

The Balloting committee will consist
of tellers plus the subcommittee of the
Elections Committee, and this committee
will work out the details for control, se-
curity and the counting of the ballots.

To the larger delegations, if they so
desire they may elect two watchers to
assist or to watch the distribution, col-
lection and counting of the ballots.

Ballots will be handed to the heads
of delegations, and collected in the same
manner under the supervision of the
Elections Committee.

During the process of conducting the
election, the ﬂoor will be cleared of all
but voting delegates. When the election is
in process, every one who is not a voting
delegate will be asked to move to the rear
of the hall.

Ballots will be distributed on the basis
of one to each voting delegate present,
at the time of the elections, with the ex-
ception of California, where ballots will
be proportionately weighted to get credit
for their total delegation.

Ballots will be declared void and in-
valid if more than 20 are voted for.

Mr. Chairman, I move the adoption of
these rules of procedure. .

George S. (New Jersey): I wish to
offer the following amendment. Accord-
ing to the provisions announced by the
Elections Committee, of the 20 highest
votes being elected, it would be possible
to elect a member of the National Commit-
tee without a majority vote. And I would
propose that every member must have a
clear majority. Otherwise there should be
a run-off. Now I know that this takes
time but I do not think that we should
leave this convention hall without having
elected a National Committee by clear ma-
jority. That's Amendment No. 1.

The second amendment is that there
should also be a ruling, in view of some
of the bitterness that exists at this con-

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

veiition, that those ballots which do not
contain 20 votes, whether they contain
more than 20 or less than 20, are invalid,
that everyone shall vote for 20 members
of the National Committee.

I offer these two amendments separately.

Davis: The committee considered the
matter of trying to guarantee that each
elected member of the National Commit-
tee have the endorsement of more than
50 per cent of the convention but it was
felt that in view of the large number of
nominations we are apt to have, it would
necessitate several ballots and we would
ﬁnd ourselves in a procedure comparable
to that of the Democratic and Republican
national conventions whereby it would re-
quire several days to elect 20 delegates.

Ch.: The Chair rules out of order the
proposed amendment on the grounds of
Rule 8 of the Convention Rules that they
are contrary to the report and therefore
would have to be submitted to the Elec-
tions Committee.

Davis: The committee wishes to apolo-
gize for a point of unclarity. We neglected
to recommend that the state delegations
during their caucuses discuss the matter
of nominations to the National Committee.

At this point they will arrive at a conclu- '

sion as to those people whom they ‘wish
to nominate. They will then be given 2
minutes to speak for each person whom
they wish to nominate.

Ch.: The committee's ruling is that one
cannot vote for more than 20. One could
vote under that for less than 20.

A Delegate: Mr. Chairman, I should
like to ask ﬁrst whether the committee
has given any consideration to the problem
that at least our delegation has that by
tomorrow less than half of our delegation
will be present, because the other com-
rades have to go back to work, and whether
they have given any consideration to the
question of permitting the delegation to
have its full vote and if it has, why it
has rejected that idea and made the pro-
posal that it has.

Davis: We considered it but we couldn’t
come up with a solution. If the comrade
has a good solution, we would consider
it. The problem is that there are a num-
ber of delegations that had to go to work
today and will not be on hand for the
elections.

Ch.: Further on that, I am just advised
that the Presiding Committee has not ruled

 

»t

.e
h

b'<'a—D.-Q30-.t7z'.:l'."

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION ’ 193

on the precise time of the voting but they
will do so shortly.

Lil Gates (New York): I want to raise
two questions, first, in addition to the
problem that Comrade Hy raised, we have
a large number of delegates in New York
who are working and cannot come dur-
ing the day. We have a very representa-
tive delegation and we do have shop work-
ers. We tried very hard to get them to
this convention. Therefore I would like
to propose to. the Presiding Committee or
the Elections Committee that some provi-
sion be made for these comrades to vote
later on when they come to the convention
regardless of the time of the election.
Perhaps something can be worked out in
relation to the problem Comrade Hy
raised.

The second proposal I want to make is
this: I think in view of the fact that these
are 20 delegates-at-large, they are not
delegates from the state alone, as I un-

» derstand it, that there is insufficient time

to discuss these comrades. I cannot see
how, on the basis of a 2-minute nominating
speech for each comrade. I would like to
propose that the Elections Committee take
this proposal back, and also consider how
they will guarantee the election of a com-
mittee which will reﬂect the various view-
points at this convention. I think that the
procedure as it is now outlined is extremely
limited and does not guarantee sufﬁcient
discussion on this. So I would like to ask
the Elections ‘Committee to take this spe-
ciﬁc amendment back for further discussion
and consultation as to how to do this in a
manner giving more thought and atten-
tion to it.

Ch.: The Committee is considering the
questions raised by the comrade, and
would like a few minutes to consider them
a little further. As I followed the amend-
ments, they were not substitutes for
parts of the rules proposed in the Rules
Committee’s report. In my opinion, they
would be additions.

The question has been called. [Vote
taken.] The report of the Sub-Committee
on Election Procedure is carried.

C/2.: We will interrupt this ques-
tion to bring before the house at this
time a non-debatable motion to adopt
the section of the Resolution on the

“American Road to Socialism” as
amended. Debate was terminated on
this report but voting was deferred
subject to receiving in typed or mimeo-
graphed form the report of the com-
mittee.

The question has been called. [Vote
taken.] The motion is carried.

A Delegate (New York): Poii'i‘f"$f in-
formation: If the shopworker delegates
whom we have who cannot be here—who
are going to work tomorrow—will not be
here at 11:00 a.m., what provision is the
committee making for these delegates to be
able to cast their votes for the National
Committee? It’s my impression that, out of
140 New Yo-rk delegates, there must be at
least sixty or seventy-ﬁve such delegates
in this position. I think it would be
highly unfair if they cannot cast their
vote.

Ch.: If they are here at the time of the
election, which will take place some time
in the late afternoon, they will be able to
vote.

A Delegate: Can these delegates who
know they are going to work tomorrow
cast their votes late tonight, after the
nominations, and leave it with the Com-
mittee?

Ch.: The ballots will not be printed.

The Delegate: Then what provision is
being made for these sixty or seventy-ﬁve?

Ch.: The ruling of the Rules Commit-
tee representative is that there will be no
special provisions for casting absentee
ballots.

A Delegate: Now then, we do have in
New York 40 to 50 per cent delegates
who are shop workers. I think it would be
highly unfair to be so rigid as to refuse
to make provisions for these comrades
to vote when they get here from the shops.
Furthermore, the delegates from New York
do not receive any expenses whatsoever,
and only because we happen to have a larg-
er membership, I don’t believe we should
be penalized for that. I should like to em-
phasize the fact that this matter never
came before the elections committee, and
there is no ruling from the elections com-
mittee on this matter. (Applause.)

. A Delegate (Illinois): Point of informa-
tion: I was under the impression that we
came here to a National Convention and
that all deleﬁites arle (going to electdmim-

ers o t e ationa « ommittee, an t at
we agreed,.I think, on twenty members-
at-large, with delegates from all states
present at the time that balloting is taken.
In the Illinois delegation, some of the
comrades have to go home because they
have to go to work and for other reasons.

Obviously, they can’t come back from
Illinois _to get a ballot tomorrow at ﬁve
o clock they cant vote. Our alternate
delegates took their place. I don’t see why
any exceptions should be made for the
delegates from New York. (Applause.)

 I recognize the chairman of the
pres] mg committee.

Carl Winter: Comrades, the presiding

s us ion in
this convention, but the steering commit-
tee has consulted and has a suggestion to
offer. If members of the presiding com-
mittee dpd niitk object, the steering commit-
tee wou i e to ro- ose in the name
of thﬁ. presiding C0 ttee’, th? following
proce ure: t at we a journ or caucus
meetings or delegation meetings by states,
for the purpose of considering names to
be placed in nomination. That these dele-
gation meetings prepare a consultative
vote, to be reported out later this evening,
in full SCSSIOII, indicating the nomina-
tions proposed by the respective delega-
tion meetings. That a ‘ballot then be pre-
pared (additio-nal nominations, of course,
may be received from the ﬂoo-r at large)
and mimeographed tonight, however late
that may be. (Applause.) That any dele-

an t at tomorrow, we ave e e ections
for the balance of the convention.

The order of business as it now stands
calls for the election as a special order at
11:15 tomorrow morning. As far as I can
see, that is the only reason that there is
no_ other proposal about the time of bal-
loting. Otherwise, it might be possible,
by changing the special order, to have
general balloting. However, we would have
to consider whether everyone would stay
as late as would become necessary to
await the mimeographed ballot, or whether

who anticipate being absent tomorrow
for work.

A Delegate: Point of information: I’d
like to know whether in this new proposal,
we propose that those delegates from other
states that have to leave, and no provi-
sion has been made for it, will the rest of
the delegates be able to vote for their full
delegation? ~

Ch.: May I call the com.rade’s attention
to one of the rules established by the
National Committee in the call to this con-
vention? The National Committee call
for this convention, which was adopted
on the opening day, provided that there be
no proxy voting, with the exception that,
where full delegations are unable to attend
from any state, for ﬁnancial reasons, that
their votes may be equally apportioned
among the attending delegates. No other
provision has been accepted by this con-
vention for the casting of votes for ab-
sentees.

A Delegate: I would like to express my
opinion in favor of this proposal, for the
following reasons. First of all, I think it
is unfortunate that the N. Y. delegation did
not arrange, as did the out of town dele-
gations, for their delegates to take time
off, so that they’ are able to attend the
convention in full. However, inasmuch as
they did not, it is my opinion that it is a
mistake to penalize delegates by disfran-
chising them for not doing so.

It would be wrong if we exhibited
some kind of ridiculous vindictiveness and
disfranchised those delegates and did not
permit them to participate. Therefore, I
favor that the nominations be made to-
night and that those delegates be permitted
to vote their choice for the National Com-
mittee. (Applause.)

[Further procedural discussion.l

Another Delegate: On procedure: Is it
possible, as a result of the proposal of the
Presiding Committee, for all delegates
to vote tonight? It’s just as easy for all
delegates to mark their ballots.

Ch.: We’ll call upon the Chairman of
the Presiding Committee, Comrade Win-
ter, to restate the essence of the amend-
ment which will be the subject to be
voted on at this time.

Comrade Winter: I think perhaps
comrades, we should act on these features
of the voting procedure seriatum. The ﬁrst
proposal I would submit, therefore, is

that we adjourn to delegation meetings
for the purpose of preparing nominations.

[Further procedural discussion.]

Ch.: You have heard the motion, what
is your pleasure. [Vote taken.]

Carried and so ordered.

Chair. '

C}z.: We will have the report of
the Elections Committee. Comrade
Lester Davis.

Lester Davis: The report of the
elections sub—committee in charge of

the elections is as follows: There

were a total of 258 ballots issued.
Weighting the California ballot on
the basis of one and two—thirds vote
for each ballot, the Oregon vote on
the basis of two to one, and the C010-
rado vote on the basis of two to one,
we get a total of 2811/; cast. Charlene

foot 2012/3; Iim Iackson 186 votes;
Dorothy Healey I761/3; Ben Davis
I742/3; Eugene Dennis 174 votes;

In accordance with the rules estab-
lished by the elections committee,
these comrades are declared elected.

The elections sub—committee Wants
to‘ thank the comrades for their ex-
cellent cooperation and conduct of
the election, and I want to state fur-
ther that a number of comrades have
congratulated me, but I wish to in-
dicate that the conduct of this elec-
tion was the product and the work
of all the comrades who worked to-
gether to try to guarantee an elli-
ciently run election. (Applause.)

Comrade Chairman, I move the
adoption of this report.

[Proposal to declare elected the 21st
highest candidate in the voting, who re-
ceived one-third vote less than the 20th,
in view of the fact that he is a Puerto
Rican. After considerable discussion, the
proposal is defeated as contrary to the
rules and procedure of the elections.]

A Delegate: Point of Special Privilege:
I would like to ask the New York dele-
gation as a whole to guarantee this con-
vention that it will guarantee Puerto Rican
representation among its eleven members
of the National Committee that it is en-
titled to. (Applauseu)

[Procedural discussio-n.]

George Blake Charney (New York):
Comrades, I would like to speak for more
than a moment, but for the beneﬁt of those
comrades who asked me to put it into
one sentence, I would say that I consider
this election a mandate to the New York
convention to elect a Puerto Rican com-
rade to the National Committee.

A Delegate: Point of Information: At

 

196 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

what point will the Appeals Committee
report out its ﬁndings? I make this point
because I think that there are some im-
portant and basic issues that all of us are
concerned with, particularly in New Jer-
sey, and I think it very important that we
hear the nature of these appeals.

Ch.: The Chair doesn’t precisely know
when we are going to get to this ques-
tion. I think it's up to the will of the
body whether they stay here long enough
to hear this question. If you want to
make this a special order of business some-
where, take it up with the Presiding Com-
mittee, if they can get it in, and if they
can’t, come back and make a motion
on the floor.

The motion now is that the report of
the Appeals Committee be a special order
of business, immediately following the re-
port of the Constitution Committee.

[Further procedural discussion.l

Eugene Dennis: Comrades, all of us feel
very strongly about things that are coming
before this convention. All of us are also
extremely tired because of the sharpness
of controversy on certain things which
have transpired; our patience is somewhat
at a breaking point. But let us remem-
ber a few very vital things. The member-
ship of our Party, the workers, Negro peo-
ple and others, who are looking with great
expectations to the decisions of this con-
vention, are expecting more progress and
constructive things from us, even in these
few concluding hours. (Applause.)

Our membership, and people who re-
spect our Party, don’t want answers that
we got hung up on procedural questions,
points of order, special privilege, etc. We
yet haven't adopted a constitution; we
haven’t adopted our program of action,
and comrades, I want to appeal to you to
subordinate some of the things you feel
strongly about, subordinate it in the in-
terests of the Party! (Applause.)

C/z.: The motion is to make a special
order of business of the Appeals Commit-
tee, after the Constitution Committee’s
report. [Vote taken.l The motion is car-
ried, 104 to 87.

Can we now proceed with the
report of the Resolutions Commit-
tee——Sub-Committee No. 5? The
Chair calls on Nemmy Sparks.

Ncmmy S-par}{:: Comrades, the
subject before the body at the pres-
ent time is the section of the sub-
committee report that was reported
on yesterday by Comradﬁ Max
Weiss. This is the section dealing
with theory that was reported out by
the entire sub-committee. I re-state
the motion to adopt the report of the
sub-committee on this section.

Will Weinstone (New York): Com-
rades, I believe it’s very difficult to do
justice to questions of theory at this
late moment. And one has to be in-
deed brave to expect that this matter
can be handled fully. Nonetheless, we
all know that matters of theory are de-
cisive in our movement, and that errors
of theory, errors of formulation, even
if they be a single word, may lead
to great harm to our movement, and
that is why our movement has al-
ways preserved the full integrity of our
theory.

I believe that the formulation in re-
gard to Marxism-Leninism presented
to the convention has been strength-
ened over the previous formulations,
and I think, in this respect, the com-
mittee has made progress. I have,
however, three objections still to the
salient formulations in regard to Marx-
ism-Leninism, in its application to the
United States. And that is what we are
discussing—the two-fold aspects of the
question of Marxism-Leninism. One,
the acceptance of its validity and the
opposition to doctrinaire interpreta-
tions of that validity. We are also
striving to achieve a better understand-

ing of Marxist-Leninist theory in the

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 197

applications to the United States. That
is also a basic task.

My opinion is that the formulations
in the draft do not make clear wheth-
er, in accepting the universality of
Marxist laws, this applies also to the
United States. That is not clear. It is
stated that they are universal, but
if they areuniversal laws, they should
state also that they are valid for all
countries, including the United States.
Now, this validity, comrades, is thrown
doubt upon by three formulations in
the draft. One, in purpose; two, the
formulation that we will extract from
the rich body of theory and speciﬁcally
apply it to the United States; and
third, that we are going to study the
state, the dictatorship of the prole-
tariat, etc.

I welcome all study of the state, dic-
tatorship of the proletariat, dialectical
materialism, American history and
everything. But I want to know: are
you studying it because you believe that
it is no longer valid for the United
States? Are you studying it because
in the first draft you said we have
modified Lenin’s theory of the state?
And I think in your formulation you
threw doubt upon the validity.

Now, it is possible to interpret it
otherwise, and that’s just the trouble.
It is all things to all men. Therefore,
in my opinion, we should not triﬂe
with the matter. I doubt that we can
succeed in doing it now, and my re-
marks are more as a matter of Wam-
ing. I have the following formulations.
In my opinion, the following formula-
tion takes care of what the committee
designed. The Party bases itself on

the principles of Marxism-Leninisrn.
These principles are universally valid
for all countries, including the United
States. They must be applied, not dog-
matically, but ﬂexibly. (Chairman Calls
time.)

Steve Nelson (Western Pa.): Com-
rade Chairman and Comrade Dele-
gates: I believe this is one of the most
important questions before our conven-
tion. I think the question that is be-
fore us has been debated in this dis-
cussion and we will have to draw a clear
line just where we stand on this mat-
ter. Why is it important that we make
clear just what our Party—just what
this convention—understands by this
formulation that has been brought here
by the committee on the matter of
Marxism-Leninism? The main attack
against the formulation comes from
those comrades who contend that our
position should be strictly like the old
one, in the sense of referring to it as
Marxism-Leninism, and that will be
enough. That’s been our trouble.
Those comrades who think that to have
the words in there merely—Marxism-
Leninism—and object to the idea of
interpreting, they are delaying our
Party from going forward and making
a break. They are putting a sectarian
muzzle on our Party which will ham-
per its development.

Now, those comrades who think it
is enough to say Marxism-Leninism,
and therefore that answers everything,
let me ask you this? Did you ever
take a look at the position that the
Trotskyites take on this matter? They
call themselves Marxist—Leninist Bol-
sheviksl Does that make them—that

#98

which we want to strive to be? Does
it prevent them from being sectarian?
No! It seems to me, comrades, that
the question of interpreting by this
Party is a key question. You heard
here a letter from Comrade Duclos,
in which he chooses to interpret what
this convention ought to do. And I
think we are here discussing the ques-
tion, is someone else going to interpret
it or is this convention going to in-
terpret it? (Applause.)

Now, comrades, I think it is time
our Party grew up. We had a sec-
tarian tradition from the days of Marx.
He was able to tell the early Marxists
here, “Don’t just quote it as scripture;
don’t repeat it as we do in Europe and
Germany; you’ll never make progress.”
This was said some eighty years ago.
And comrades, again, since our Party
was organized, we have been plagued
by the same proposition that we have
copied and we have imitated, and we
have repeated things that are not
worth while repeating at this conven-
tion because they would make us all
sick! We want to put an end to that,
and the only way that can be done,
comrades, is by adopting the position
of the resolutions committee. (Ap-
plause.)

Ch.: The Chair neglected to inform
you that the proposal of the Presiding
Committee was that we would have two
speakers for and two speakers against.
We had one against and one for.

A Delegate: Point of information:
This report was in two sections. I
want to know, as a member of the Sub-
Committee, when the second part of
this report will be given to the con-

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

vention—the one on our relationships
with other parties.

Sparks: The report was not in two
sections but in three sections. You dis-
cussed and accepted the first report
yesterday, after that negotiating com-
mittee deal. And now this is the sec-
ond section. The third section will
come on the ﬂoor whenever the Pre-
siding Committee ﬁnds space for it.

C/2.: The rest of the Presiding Com-
mittee’s recommendation was for three
minute limitation. I am sorry; I forgot
to tell you that.

AZ (New York): Speaking against,
I ﬁnd myself in sharp and complete
disagreement with this report, as I
found myself in disagreement with the
reports of all convention committees.
I am against this report because, in
spite of some good amendments—in
quotes—-this report dangerously waters
down the Marxist-Leninist character of
our Party, and injects a strong Right
opportunist, revisionist tendency, which
will be destructive of all that our Party
has stood for since its very birth. This
destructive tendency, which I ﬁnd
throughout the draft resolution, in my
opinion, cannot be eliminated except
by the complete rejection of this report,
as well as a rejection of the political
line of the entire draft resolution.

While I believe our past work has
suffered from certain mechanical in-
terpretations of Marxism-Leninism, it
is impossible for me to understand
how this convention can obscure the
fact that, when you reduce a science
to something that you interpret, you
are throwing the science out of the
window. It is my opinion that this

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

strong Right opportunist, revisionist
tendency that permeates the draft reso-
lution and the reports made—the li-
quidation of this tendency, the politi-
cal defeat of this tendency is the ma-
jor problem that life has placed be-
fore this convention. And only the de-
feat of this tendency will enable us
to properly. and critically review our
work, and adopt the proper program
and policy for the future.

While I fully appreciate the desire
of many comrades to maintain the
unity of the Party, it is my conviction
that unity which is not based upon
principle is an illusory unity, and that
the so-called unity spirit that is being
fostered here is nothing more than an
effort to blur over sharp differences
which, if not decisively settled, will
tear our Party to pieces in the future.

Imze (CaZif0mia):Comrades, my con-
viction is that the essence of Marxism-
Leninism is that it is not a dogma, and
that the major lesson we can learn
from Lenin himself is that we have a
responsibility and an obligation to
interpret Marxism-Leninism in terms
of the problems and history and tradi-
tions of our own country. I want to
speak particularly on paragraph 3 of
this resolution, which calls upon the
Party to study thoroughly the realities
of American life today and its history
and traditions. But I want to speak
against the vague, general Way in which
we refer to American traditions, and
ask that we make a very thorough
and concrete study of it. Every Com-
munist Party in the world has the ob-
ligation to independently study and
apply Marxism to its own particular,

199

yes, comrades, its unique tradition,
and the unique nature of its own his-
tory and culture.

We have a great deal to learn from
foreign parties, and we can learn from
Lenin and from Mao Tse-tung and
from Togliatti, and other Communist
leaders throughout the world, the nec-
essity of studying and knowing our
own country. Comrades, we don’t
know as much about American history
as we know about Russian history,
and we’ve got an obligation to learn
it. Marxism is a generalization of
world experiences, and Marxism ap-
plied to the United States must be a
generalization of world experiences,
plus particularly those of our own
country.

I would like to urge that the in-com-
ing National Committee institute im-
mediately a real study of the history
of our country, its political, its eco-
nomic, its social and its cultural his-
tory and traditions, so that we can
ﬂexibly understand and apply and
create our theory and move forward
into the struggle of the American peo-
ple for socialism. (Applause.)

C/2.: We have now had two speak-
ers for and two against. Under the
rules, We will proceed to vote. [Vote
taken.] The Ayes have it. Four ab-
stentions.

The report of the committee has been
adopted.

Ch.: The next order of business is the
report on the Preamble of the Consti-
tution.

A Delegate: On procedure: It was origi-
nally proposed by the Presiding Commit-
tee that this subcommittee of the Reso-
lutions Committee would report on three

subjects: the nature of our errors, theory
and theoretical questions, and relations
with other Communist Parties. We have
not taken up the third point which was
supposed to immediately follow, and un-
less we change the rules thatwe adopted
on that question, that is next in order.
Ch.: O.K. The Chairman says he is now
ready to report on the third section of the
Resolutions Sub-committee on the Party.

Nemmy Spar/(5: With the emer-
gence of socialism as a world system,
it has become necessary to recognize,
besides the contradiction between
the forces of imperialism and the
people, a new type of contradiction:
a contradiction between socialist
countries, or between the Commu-
nist parties of different countries.

In the early days before World
War I, it was generally thought
that national boundaries and na-
tional consciou_-'sness woulld disap-
pear with the coming of socialism,
but Lenin insisted even before World
War I on the continuing importance
of the national question.

As it happened, the socialist revo-
lution was not world—wide in 1917,
but succeeded in only one country.
Since then, socialism has developed
within national lines and in a world
where national consciousness is
stronger than ever. This greatly
complicates the problems of prole—
tarian internationalism.

Thus today, despite their com-
mon aims and outlook, we ﬁnd that
the unity of the socialist world is
by no means automatic. It was
chieﬂy to the solution of this ques-
tion that the Chinese Communist
Party recently devoted their excel-

lent article, and the visits of Chou
En-lai to the Soviet Umon and the
People’s Democracies.

The method of solution of this
contradiction between socialist coun-
tries is the method of criticism
and struggle, but that criticism
must be within the framework of
recognition that the fundamental
conﬂict is between the forces of
the peoples and the forces of im-
perialism. We were correct in rec-
ognizing this new type of contra-
diction, but it must be admitted that
in dealing with it recently, we made
many errors, either confusing the
two contradictions, or failing to
maintain the primacy of the fun-
damental contradiction. Undoubt-
edly it will take some time and
further experience for all of us to
learn how to handle this new type
of question correctly, through all
the maze of historical events that
characterize the period we live in.

The failure to recognize the
complications of the historical de-
velopment of socialism led also to
our uncritical acceptance of the
developments in the Soviet Union,
and our tendency to accept uncrit-
ically the views of Marxists of other
countries. We exaggerated the pos-
sibilities of a single world view,
not recognizing that it can provide
only a general guide. This resulted
in strengthening doctrinairism on
our part, led us to mistrust the ob-
servations of our own members
working in the ﬁeld, and hindered
the normal development of our
theoretical work.

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

As long ago as July, 1943, the
Communist International gave as
one of the main reasons for its de-
cision to dissolve, the following
judgment:

“The profound difference in the
historical roads of development of
each country of the world, the di-
verse character and even the con-
tradictions in the social order, the
difference in level and rate of their
social development, and ﬁnally the
diﬂerence in the degree of con-
sciousness and organization of the
workers, have also conditioned the
various problems which face the
working class of each individual
country.”

How much more true is this to-
day with the vastly greater com-
plications of the situation! There-
fore, more than ever, must we be,
as Comrade Dennis placed it in his
keynote “not only organizationally
independent, but ideologically in-
dependent.”

We should carefully study all
criticism and opinions, as we, in
a fully responsible way, criticize
others, but no opinions from else-
where can determine our policy.

Only those policies, which arise
out of our own interpretation and
application of our Marxist-Leninist
scientiﬁc principles to the needs
and interests of the American work-
ing class and people can be valid
for us.

Therefore your committee pro-
poses the adoption of this section of
the Draft Resolution, page 57

201

through the top of Page 59, W131
only one amendment. This amend-
ment is based on a Resolution by
the Illinois State Convention and
was adop-ted unanimously by your
committee.

It reads as follows:

“New problems of relations have
arisen as a result of the emer-
gence of socialism as a world sys-
tem comprising a number of na-
tional states in place of one en-
circled socialist country. Serious
mistakes and shortcomings in the
relations between the USSR and
other socialist states—as in the ex-
amples of Poland and Hungary-
have been revealed. Efforts are
being made to correct these mis-
takes on the basis of a fur-
ther development of the Marx-
ist-Leninist principles of prole-
tarian internationalism, national
independence and equality. Cor-
rection of errors in relationships
between socialist states is facili-
tated by the fact that the funda-
mental basis of such relations is
common ideology, common aims,
mutual assistance and cooperation.

“International working-class soli-
darity includes the right to friendly
criticism of brother parties or the
actions of socialist governments. At
the same time it requires that such
criticism shall be within the frame-
work of recognition that the funda-
mental conflict of all peoples is with
the forces of imperialism.”

I move the adoption of this report.
(Applause.)

202

Ch.: The motion is to adopt the
report of the committee. We will
have two speakers for and two against.

Manny Cantor (New Icrsey): I want
to speak brieﬂy on how the great Chi-
nese Communist Party comes forward
in the world at this critical juncture
to express its international solidarity
and to give assistance to the world
movement. Some months back, it
sounded warnings against both great
nations’ chauvinism and small na-
tions’ nationalism. It proceeded to probe
deeper into the political lessons and
significance of the Stalin period, errors
and abuses, which the Communist Party
of the -Soviet Union has not as yet
adequately presented to the world
movement. And more lately, we have
the article to which Comrade Sparks
made reference, this valuable contribu-
tion against the danger of both right
opportunism as well as left sectarianism
and dogmatism. And it’s up to the
Marxists of each country to determine
which warnings of the Chinese com-
rades most apply to their given situa-
tion. And in some discussions, I be-
lieve there has been some hasty read-

ing of this document, and some would .

view this document——and I have heard
such expression in this convention—
as settling the main questions raised
in our discussion.

I believe that the Chinese comrades
never intended this; it is contrary to
their whole approach to their own
problems. There are big questions and
vital ones under international debate.
Togliatti in the Italian party has di-
vergences of opinion with the French
comrades, while also oﬁering them

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

sage advice which they do not choose
on some points to take. There are
differences in regard to the possibili-
ties for peaceful constitutional transi-
tion in big capitalist countries, and
the possibility of curbing ruling class
violence. I think all of us want to
weigh the opinions of Gomulka and
the Polish Party on problems of transi-
tion and other questions, despite some
French opinion that Gomulka is wrong.
Above all, we want to examine all
ideas, theories, proposals and advice
from the standpoint of their application
to this country, with a View to deter-
mine, in free discussion and exchange,
what aspects—as the Chinese put it
——are common to all, and what aspects
are different.

Now, how does the Communist
Party of China apply its position, as
developed in this article? I think we
can examine it by looking at the Chou
En-lai tour. The result of his visit to
Warsaw is strengthened unity of P0-
land and the socialist countries. It
aided the bonds of solidarity. And one
of the most important reasons that this
result was achieved is that Chou did
not try to pressure Gomulka and the
Communist Party of Poland into sev-
eral positions that would have created
rifts and problems within the Com-
munist Party of Poland, and would
have weakened the ties of that party
with the Polish working class and peo-
ple.

And so, on the Hungarian question,
their joint statement did not endorse
Soviet troop action, but supported the
Kadar government. So in regard to re-
lations with the Soviet Union, there

 

I [U (P

‘| id-|\JUlidd|

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 203

was a variation between their joint
statement and, for example, the Czecho-
slovak Party. It took into account the
real situation in Poland. The question
I would ask is, what would have hap-
pened in Poland if the Polish leaders
had acceded to the opinions of the So-
viet leaders some months ago? Would
they have won overwhelming support
of the Polish people? Would interna-
tional solidarity have been strength-
ened? Were relations with the Soviet
Union and the socialist camp im-
proved? I think the answer is obvious.
And I a.m conﬁdent that the Soviet
leaders today are happy that they
were not successful in persuading the
Polish Party leaders of their course,
and the lesson for us is to strengthen
international solidarity to defend the
‘cause of international socialism. We
must approach these and similar ques-
tions (and many more will arrive)
from the standpoint of the American
workers, the American conditions, the
level of struggle and the understand-
ing here.

Iacob Mirzdel (New York): Com-
rades, our discussion about the Soviet
Union wasn’t anything to be proud of.
Iust a while ago, we adopted a resolu-
tion which tells the international Com-
munist parties “Keep Out of the United
States.” Now, we take freedom to dis-
cuss and tell the parties of the socialist
countries what they did well and what
they didn’t do well. I think that the
danger we are facing is making the
criticism of the Soviet Union our
main problem. While We recognize
that the Soviet Union and other Com-
munist parties made mistakes, we

should also recognize that since the
20th Congress, we had a declaration of
October 30th, a declaration of Novem-
ber 23rd, and if we are to tell some-
thing to these parties, we should say
that, while they made mistakes, we
congratulate their efforts, and recog-
nize these documents as a step forward
to consolidate the international stand
of the working class. And I deplore
that we are not consistent. If we
want to be opportunists—let us be on
the whole line. That’s what you’re
trying to do! And you’re telling that
one party cannot butt in in the business
of another party. That is isolationism
of the worst kind.

I Why? Because the problems of the
United States cannot be solved in iso-
lation. They can be solved only in
conjunction with other countries (ap-
plause), and when we put ourselves
in other relations, we are only saying
that we don’t adhere to Marxism-Len-
inism.

And I propose that, if the committee
sees its way to include the actions of
the Party since the 20th Congress-
otherwise, I propose that we vote
against the resolution. (Applause.)

Bob (New York): I believe the reso-
lution is inadequate because it does not
suPriciently explore one of the major
factors responsible for our errors, both
to the right and left, throughout our
history, and that is, a fundamentally
incorrect conception of proletarian in-
ternationalism. For us, this has meant
not only support for the socialist coun-
tries and the workers’ governments,
it has come to mean tailing critically
behind and tailing all our policy and ac-

tivity to the particular turns of Soviet
foreign policy, whether right or wrong.
We have tried to squeeze all of life
into this narrow framework, to evaluate
all other events, movements, organiza-
tions and individuals on this basis,
and we attacked all of those who dif-
fered with us, including friends of the
Soviet Union, as enemies. And this dis-
torted concept, I believe, is exactly
what Comrade Foster continues to ad-
vocate.

Second of all, by our unwillingness
to support any peace movement until
the Soviet Union did so, we isolated
ourselves much more than necessary
from the peace movements of this coun-
try. Proletarian internationalism means
that if we believe in and support the
Soviet Union and socialism, we must
speak out against every Soviet policy,
whether domestic or foreign, which
hinders socialism in the world. Dialec-
tical materialism requires that we see,
not only the main truths, but the con-
tradictions. If we ask for fraternal
friendly discussion, we must point out
that discussion is limited when we print
all views, but Pravda refuses to print
any of our views except Dennis’, and
censors that!

Comrades, belief in socialism and
support for the Soviet Union means
that we must criticize and state the
full truth without equivocation on
every issue. We,- who do not want
to blind ourselves, have, I believe, more
faith in the basic strength and resiliency
and power of socialism in the Soviet
Union than those who quake and quiv-
er. For these reasons, I am convinced
that the line being advocated at this

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

convention by Comrade Foster is not
only not dialectical materialism but
dangerous rejection and attack on the
true meaning of proletarian interna-
tionalism. (Applause.)_

Millie (New York): Comrades, I
am very glad I Finally got recognized.
I am a section organizer in Manhattan,
who has sat through the County, State,
and—so far—the National Convention,
and still hasn’t gotten a chance to speak
until just now! I would hate to have
had to go home to my section without
having had the opportunity to express
my section’s views on something in this
convention.

I would like to read to the conven-
tion from a report adopted unanimous-
ly by the two staffs of my section and
the adjoining section on relations with
the world Communist parties. As much
as I have time for, anyway.

“The overwhelming majority of the
Soviet Union’s policies have been in the
interests of peace, socialism, equality
of all peoples, an end to colonial rule
and defeat of fascism in the world.
We are proud to have supported these
policies. Up until the 20th Congress
of the CPSU, however, and the signifi-
cant theoretical generalizations devel-
oped therein, particularly on separate
roads to socialism and peaceful transi-
tion, we justified, explained or ra-
tionalized every Soviet move, and de-
fended their policies as totally correct
to all comers. The revelations, self-
criticisms of the Soviet Central Con-
mittee at the 20th Congress, however,
showed that, in relationship to Yugo-
slavia, the Nazi-Soviet Pact, the ques-
tion of the cult of personality, rela-

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 205

tionship with non-Communist social-
ists, they committed errors. We have
committed the same errors. The
Khrushchev report on Stalin, and the
shocking violations of socialist democ-
racy and legality showed that our un-
critical attitude toward the Soviet Un-
ion and socialist countries had led us
to the edgeof moral and political col-
lapse.

“It is not enough to say that we did
not know what was going on. Other
people——progressive, socialist-minded-
knew, and when they said so, we at-
tacked them as being enemies of the
people.

“Unless we clearly establish our inde-
pendence as a political organization,
and base ourselves upon the American
working class and an American road to
socialism, we shall be lost. Irrespective
of the magniﬁcent contribution that
the Soviet Union has made to world
socialism and world progress, we can-
not here in America use the Soviet
experience as a model for the American
working class. The material conditions
are different, the historical background
is different, the atmosphere of the
American bourgeois-democratic revolu-
tion is different.” (Applause.)

Ch.: We’ve had two speakers for
and two against.

Archie (California): I wish to make
an amendment. I ask that, in the third
sentence of that ﬁrst main paragraph
of the amendment, which starts in
“Efforts are being made to correct,”
I want to add, “and certain important
corrections have been made.” Would
the committee accept that?

671.: The oﬂicers of the committee

do not object to it. They say they
accept it.

Paul (New York): The amendment
that I offer is the following: As the
last sentence following what we have
here, the following additional sentence
I would urge for inclusion in the
amendment, as fulﬁlling the sense of it
for our Party. “In the light of this
recognition, we must self—critically re-
ject the November 5th statement of
our resident National Committee,
denying the central role ofU.S. impe-
rialism in the tragic Hungarian events,
as a default of our obligations both
to the American and the world Work-
ing class.” If I may speak on that,
I would.

C/1.: You can’t speak on it. There is
a division among the oﬂicers, but a
majority of them say it’s not accept-
able.

A Delegate: I would like to offer an.
amendment which was adopted al-
most unanimously by the New York:
State Convention. The amendments:
are as follows. The first part on p..
57 of the draft resolution, to replace
the two sentences at the end of the first
paragraph, beginning with the words,
“The only allegiance.”

Sparks: The committee rejected that
same amendment in the full commit-
tee meeting.

A Delegate: In the last paragraph,.
I’d like to include two more words.
“international working class solidarity‘
includes the right and resp0n'5z'l7z'lity~
to friendly criticism of brother parties.”"
Is that acceptable to the committee?

C11,: No objection, they say. The:
question has been called for.

All those in favor of adopting the
Committee’s report? [Vote taken.]
Carried.

The next order of business is the
Constitution.

[Owing to the pressure of time, the Re-
port of Fred Fine, co-chairman of the
Constitution Committee, was not actually
delivered, but a motion was passed to in-
clude it in the record of the Convention.
The Report follows.]

Fred Fine: A constitution is a ba-
sic document. It is a statement of
prmciples and purpose. It is a codiﬁ-
cation of the structure of our or-
ganization, and the rules that govern
its conduct. It is a spelling out of
the means and procedures to imple-
ment our organizational principles,
and to enhance the maximum effec-
tiveness of our Party as an organized
body.

It was inevitable that out of so
-fundamental and searching a discus-
sion as has engaged our Party during
"the past year there would emerge a
new fundamental charter for our or-
ganization. Inevitably, too, considera-
tion of a new constitution increas-
ingly involved consideration of the
most fundamental principles of a
Marxist party—vanguard role, mon-
olithic unity, democratic centralism,
the Party’s class character. It would
be useful—if there were time—to
trace the evolution of the discussion.
But there is only time enough to say
that as the discussion developed, the
attention of our membership increas-
ingly centered on questions relating

; to organizational principles and their

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

expression as constitutional provi-
sions. The National Committee has
received hundreds of resolutions from
clubs, sections and state organiza-
tions, and from individual members,
concerning these questions. The
major time of many of our Party
conventions at other levels was de-
voted to such questions.

The formidable job tackled by the
Constitution—Organization Commit-
tee was to seek a synthesis of the
many expressions of opinion that
would embody the will of the mem-
bership. Before proceeding to the
questions that occupied the commit-
tee and will be presented for your
consideration, a word about the
status of the Party.

Your committee recognized that
at this Convention we will not be
able to have the “traditional” organ-
izational report, nor a discussion of
the speciﬁc and detailed organiza-
tional prob-lems we face in the Party
today. These are important ques-
tions, but the answer to them is de-
pendent upon the main political di-
rection we chart and the constitution
we adopt. We propose that the con-
z/ention instruct the National Com-
mittee to convene a national confer-
ence on Organizational Problems in
early autumn, when they can get the
attention they merit, and when we
have some experience under our belt
in carrying out the policy adopted at
this convention.

In drafting a constitution we are,
of course, in the first instance shap-
ing a charter that will embody our
principles and govern our conduct.

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

But we would be shortsighted if we
did not recognize that what we do
affects our relationships with others.
Like Robert Burns, we ‘Fmight well
hope for the gift to see ourselves as
others see us. While that is an elusive
gift, it is readily recognizable that
many are looking at us today. Thou-
sands of words have appeared in the
newspapers and journals of opinion
in our country, many of them recog-
nizing the pregnant nature of our
internal debates, and the promise
they give of new initiatives and ad-
vances by our Party.

What we do in our convention will
have an influence on the direction of
the Left as a whole, enhancing our
ability, together with other socialist-
minded Americans, to enter’ into a
new stage of the movement for so-
cialism in our country. An essential
fact is that the changes which this
convention will inaugurate have al-
ready——in large measure—begun to
be put into practice in the very course
of our pre—convention discussion.

This is recognized by many ob-
servers, anti—Communist as well as
liberal and socialist—minded, who
have written about our discussion in
such journals as the Catholic Com-
monweal, the ‘Progressive, the Re-
porter—and even in The New
Leader and Fortune magazine.

Sidney Lens, an oﬂicial of a Chi-
cago labor union, writing in the
Progressive, speculated that Ameri-
can Communists will “develop new
forms and new approaches different
from those of Yugoslavia, Poland
and Hungary” and that “American

207

Socialists and liberals, who will
clearly not rush to embrace it [Com-
munism], will be watching with
profound interest.”

I could, given the time, cite other
such expressions of opinion.

But if all this is being noted as
significant by observers outside our
orbit of inﬂuence, it must be even
more important for the thousands
who at one time were members of
our Party, who left with no hostility
to the cause of socialism, but who,
for a variety of reasons, found mem-
bership and activity in our organiza-
tion diﬂicult or impossible because
of disagreement over some policy or
our methods of work.

The changes we are debating are
also of great consequence to those in
our ranks who have doubts about
their continued association with our
Party, and are wondering whether
this convention will and can in fact
answer the problems We face in a
way that will give them good reason
for continued active association with
our Party.

Thus, the policies and Constitution
we adopt can initiate a renaissance
of activity and growth, which will
renew the power of attraction our
Party can and should have for many
thousands who wish to enlist in the
ranks of a socialist movement.

I now pass on to some of the spe-
ciﬁc elements of the Constitution.

First: the Preamble. What is our
preamble designed to achieve?

The preamble is designed to place
new emphasis on the Party's indig-
enous character, its native roots, its

208

devotion to the class character of the
American working class and the na—
tional interests of the American peo-
ple—and this in conjunction with a
reaﬂirmation of the cardinal prin-
ciple that there is an identity of in-
terest and historic destiny that serve
as the common bond uniting the
workers of all lands. In this light,
we indicate the new relationship
among the workers’ parties of various
lands, based on fraternity, equality,
independence, and mutual assistance
in the form of comradely and con-
structive criticism.

The preamble is designed to cm-
phasize our departure from the
dogmatic and doctrinaire rigidities
of the past, and to give expression to
a more creative, more ﬂexible, more
self-reliant approach to our theory,
a theory which exists objectively and
has universal validity, but which
comes to life for us and grows in
effectiveness as it is applied and de-
veloped in accordance with the tra-
ditions and realities of the American
class struggle. .

The preamble is designed to aﬂirm
that the American Communist Party
seeks no narrow partisan monopoly
in the struggle for socialism, while
it continues to play its vanguard role.
Our party ﬁghts side by side with all
who struggle for socialism and seeks
to cooperate with other socialist-
minded Americans in working to-
ward our ultimate goal. Our Party,
which many years ago recognized
that there were various roads to so-
cialism and that the American
working people would travel their

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

own road, now gives a new dimen-
sion to the movement for socialism
as we emphasize our advocacy of a
peaceful, democratic road to social-
ism. .

Our new draft Constitution, in its
Preamble and various clauses, reiter-
ates and makes clear that we have
no room in our ranks for those who
advocate force or violence or ter-
rorism, or who by word or act seek
to subvert, undermine or overthrow
the institutions of American democ-
racy through which the majority of
American people can maintain their
right to determine their destinies.
Our Party, which has pioneered in
the struggle against all forms of na—
tional oppression, national chauvin—
ism, discrimination and segregation,
makes it the obligation of all of our
members to struggle against the
ideological inﬂuences and practices
of racial theories such as white
chauvinism and anti-Semitism, and
makes it one of its cardinal principles
to ﬁght for the full social, polit-
ical and economic equality of the
Negro people and to promote the
unity of Negro and white as essen-
tial for the advancement of their
common interests.

In a sense, the preamble serves as
a capsule summary of a Party pro-
gram. As you know, the drafting of
a full Party program is a job that is
still before us. The draft resolution
recommends that this convention in-
struct the National Committee to
draft a new, more comprehensive
and more adequate program for our
Party and present it to the Party for

| 'I \v \d

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 209

discussion and action within the next
year. The Constitution Committee
associates itself with this proposal.

In treating the next speciﬁc issue
before the committee~—vanguard role
of the Party——I again revert to the
preamble.

The Draft Preamble describes the
Communist Party of the United
States as “an American working-
class political organization which
bases itself upon the principles of
scientiﬁc socialism” and which
“champions the immediate and fun-
damental interests of the workers,
farmers and all others who labor by
hand and brain, against capitalist ex-
ploitation and oppression.”

This cogently describes the char-
acter of the Communist Party and
delineates its vanguard role. Since
considerable pre-convention debate
revolved around the question of the
“vanguard role,” it is proper that we
spend a few minutes on this ques-
tion, preparatory to hearing the re-
port of the subcommittee.

The Constitution and its pre-
amble re-aﬂirm that the Commu-
nist Party places foremost the interest
of the entire working class and all
the oppressed people. As an organ-
ization of advanced workers, it
strives to bring a socialist outlook
into the working-class movement and
to heighten the political initiative
and understanding of the working
class and its allies in the solution
of the day—to-day problems in their
current struggles. This is a role for
which our Party is uniquely equip-
ped in that our program and policies

are based on the theory of scientiﬁc
socialism. It is the creative, ﬂexible
application of this theory, tested in
the crucible of the class struggle and
enriched by the experiences of the
workers in their daily struggles,
which endows our Party with ‘the
ability to participate in all struggles
of labor and the people for progress.
With such application, this can be
done in such a way as to help make
the working class conscious of itself
as a class, help it grasp the relation-
ship of class forces, the meaning of
speciﬁc struggles, the interconnection
of these struggles with the necessary
and inevitable victory of socialism.

The gross errors we committed in
the past in the mechanical, arrogant"
way in which we assumed the role
of "the vanguard party” as though
we were the sole and exclusive em-
bodiment of leadership of the work-
ing class——and at a time when our
Left-sectarian attitudes and practices
caused us to suffer the most painful
isolation from the working classl-
has nothing in common with the
genuine and realistic position we
strive to hold in American political
life, particularly in relation to the
working class and its allies, a posi-
tion of fulﬁlling the role and main-
taining the quality of a class mn-
guard. As a foundation for effective
leadership, we strive to earn the
esteem of the working class, listen-
ing and learning from the workers,
participating in their everyday strug-
gles at the level at which they are
being waged.

The concrete expression of this

. vanguard role

 

21o PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

leadership role will of necessity be
different today in the presence of a
powerful organized labor movement
and Negro people’s movement than
it was in the early ’3o’s when these
movements were much smaller in
size and narrower in content. The
advanced p-rograrns brought forward
in recent years by many labor and
people’s organizations and the initi-
atives taken by many of these organ-
izations on many issues pose new
challenges on how we strive to ful-
ﬁll our role.

In answering this “how,” we must
differentiate between what is our
ideologically and
politically and how we express our
so-called “independent role.” Our
independent activities —— which in-
clude the projection of program,
mass educational and propaganda
activities, the activity of our mem-
bers and organizations in the com-
munities on the issues, our relations
as a party per se within united fronts
——help to fulﬁll our vanguard role.
In this area, we must give new and
deep consideration to the question
of how we loo-k as an organization
to the masses of the people, how
clearly and well we are able to pro-
ject our socialist outlook and win
adherents to the perspective of so-
cialism, how skillfully we develop
tactical approaches for implementing
the strategic aim of an anti—monopoly
coalition and government as an im-
portant stage in the transition to so-
cialism, how to project demands
which meet the needs and serve the
best interests of the working class

and its allies in particular moments
in the struggles on issues.

In striving to fulﬁll an ever greater
role of leadership ideologically and
politically, it is first of all necessary
to grasp the essential quality of the
Communist contribution in the
struggles as they unfold in today's
conditions. A resolution adopted by
the Michigan State Convention des-
cribes this contribution in the fol-
lowing way:

In the current struggles of labor and
the people for progress, led by their
mass organizations——such as the daily
job struggles, the ﬁght for Negro lib-
eration, work for peace and democ-
racy—the Communists in these move-
ments assist by their experience and
understanding, their tireless efforts and
devotion, in furthering the unity and
effectiveness of these movements.

In the past, we gave some grounds
for the idea that we sought “harm-
ful factionalism” and “inﬁltration
within other organizations for sinis-
ter purposes.” This must be shown
to be entirely false. The Draft Con-
stitution (Article VI, Sec. 9) states:

“All Party members in mass or-
ganizations (trade-unions, farm and
fraternal organizations, etc.) shall
cooperate to promote and strengthen
the given organization and shall
abide by the democratic decisions of
these organizations.”

Finally, in our opinion, the draft
trade—union resolution made a signal
contribution in its examination of the
relationship and role of Communists
and the Party to the trade—unions

 

 

SESSION-S OF THE CONVENTION

. cl .
and labor movement. This 1'CSOll.1t10I1
states:

It is not the policy of the Commu-
nist Party to interfere with, “bore
from within,” or to seek to capture or
control the trade-unions. We reject any
allegation that this is our policy. We
respect the complete political and or-
ganizational independence of the trade
unions and other organizations of the
working class. We Communists seek
to inﬂuence the organized workers by
persuasion, discussion, and example,
as we do any other section of the popu-
lation.

Alongside of this, the trade-union
resolution concludes with a listing
of the reasons why Communists are
needed among the workers:

For their conscious participation in
the daily struggles; for their ability
to help draw lessons from each battle
and to help chart the course ahead-
for an anti-monopoly coalition of la-
bor, the farmers and the Negro peo-
ple; for their unreserved position on
the side of the workers in the class
struggle; for their conviction of the
identity of interest of the workers of
our country with the workers of others;
for their profound belief in the desir-
ability and the inevitability of a so-
cialist transformation of our country.

In striving to overcome our isola-
tion from the people's movements
and in once more entering into the
movements and struggles on a whole
variety of issues stirring the Ameri-
can people today, we must be mind-
ful of our present status. This re-

2II

quires the most realistic appraisal of
our strength and capacities which
inevitably set certain limitations on
the scope and character of the plans
of action we shall undertake and on
the load of activity we can expect
our organization to carry. It requires
further a far more penetrating ex-
amination of the kind of tactical ap-
proaches we develop in the ﬁght
for unity on the issues, in implement-
ing our policies in the day—to-day
activities among the people, always
taking into consideration the think-
ing and desires of the people with
whom we are working. Such exami-
nation and planning must be con-
crete, down-to—earth and realistic.
Now is not the time for grandiose
plans and projects. Now is the time
to begin to test in work, in mass
activity, the new direction of our
Marxist organization, undertaking
such activity as our membership and
organizations are capable of measur-
ing up to with some expectation of
progress. Among our foremost and
decisive tasks is a new initiative in
building the Marxist press. With a
few victories under our belt We can
raise our sights.

Now——to Democratic Centralism.
Without a doubt, no other single
question has attracted so much and
such intense discussion in the ranks.
Obviously, a great deal of discontent
existed in our Party over democratic
centralism as it has been practiced.
Possibly in this ﬁeld we had the
worst manifestation of a dogmatic,
doctrinaire and inﬂexible application
of a principle. For that reason, a

    

  

212

fresh and creative approach is need-
ed—indeed, is demanded by the
whole Party. -

Is our need more centralism? I
hardly think so. The cry has been
for more democracy. And our prob-
lem is how to expand, enrich, and
deepen the democracy in our Party
-—while retaining the capacity to act
as swiftly as the exigencies of the
struggle might require, and to act
with cohesion and strength.

' I do not need to cite the speciﬁc
forms that bureaucracy has taken in
our Party. For every example I could
cite. any comrade in this hall could
cite another. Of course, there are-
there have been and will be—indi-
viduals with bureaucratic inclina-
tions and institutions with bureau-
cratic tendencies within our Party.
But the question we must face is one
of climate and soil which permitted
such individual inclinations and in-
stitutional tendencies to ﬂourish so
luxuriantly that, like certain parasitic
plants, they threatened to strangle
everything about them. There is no
question that we in the leadership
have been guilty of commandism
and other forms of bureaucracy. It is
not to excuse the individuals or the
leading committees responsible for
such practices that we examine some
of the principles and methods of or-
ganization that our Party has had
from its inception.
Where did we go wrong? Man-
ifestly it is not a matter of terms.
It is, in the first instance, a matter
of practice, of the content we im-
parted to the principle called demo-

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

cratic centralism. Our first concern,
therefore, must be with the practices
we have followed and the content of
our organizational methods.

The classic objective of democratic
centralism is a maximum of unity
of action based on the will of the
membership. In substance, this pre-
supposes a ﬂexible, a dialectic unity
of opposites. In my judgment, there
is no contradiction between the clas-
sic objective of democratic centralism
and the new departure: from past
practice: called for by the new Con-
stitution.

Democratic centralism has been
deﬁned as “a ﬂexible system of party
organization which guarantees all
the conditions for combining the
conscious and active participation of
the whole Party membership in
Party life together with the best
forms of centralized leadership in the
activity and struggles of the Party
and the working class.”

In practice, of course——and not
only during the recent past, or dur-
ing the Browder period—democratic
centralism guaranteed no such thing.
Which should prove once again that
parroting a phrase and the meaning
it is supposed to have is no open
sesame to the solution of our prob-
lem.

By the same token, the simple
abandonment of a term does not
solve anything either.

We have got to get at the substance
of the qu.estion—which means up-
rooting bureaucratic practices that

have become systematized, encrusted
and hallowed by tradition. Which

 

 

SESSIONS   CONVENTION

’\
means guaranteeing full democracy
at every level of the Party. Which
means a recognition that unity is not
conformity, that discipline is not
obedience, that effective action ﬂows
from conviction and not command.

As to monolithic unity. Originally,
this term means simply a common
ideology or outlook as opposed to a
mixture of ideologies. In practice, it
came to mean a rigid conformity of
views on all matters of theory, policy
and tactics. The concept of a com-
mon ideology must be retained as
essential to a Marxist party. But
large sections of our Party have
spoken out in favor of dropping the
term because of the harmful practices
and connotations that have grown
around it.

Bureaucratic methods of work
exact a terrible toll in our political
work; they disrupt Party unity, stul-
tify policy and work, and weaken
our organization. Our Draft Political
Resolution graphically placed the
problem which we must attack:

Bureaucratic concepts of Party or-
ganization, systems of leadership and
relations between the Party and the
masses have been a prime factor in con-
tributing to our errors. They hindered
the early and timely correction of these
errors. Wrong concepts of leadership
discouraged full and free participation
of the membership of the discussion of
policy and tactics. They stood as insur-
mountable obstacles to the efforts of
comrades in mass organizations to chal-
lenge sectarian policies and tactics.
They contributed to the weakening
of inner-party democracy. In many

213

cases they resulted in departure from
from the very procedures established
by their own constitution. They re-
sulted in disciplinary actions which
further inhibited expressions of dis-
agreement. They made the life of the
Party largely routine, devoted, at least
between pre-convention discussion pe-
riods, to the organization of a multitude
of campaigns without adequate exami-
nation and testing of our policies and
tactics in actual life by our members
in the shops and organizations.

These bureaucratic methods of work,
system of leadership and organization
have been accentuated in part by the
mechanical application of certain prin-
ciples of organization adopted by other
Communist parties that functioned un-
der diﬁerent historical conditions.

Our new Constitution attempts to
outlaw such practices. The important

new provisions that buttress the right ,

of dissent and the new methods for
electing leadership and making all
leading bodies more responsive to the
will of the membership are historic
innovations for our Party.

Nevertheless, even the best pos-
sible constitution is only as good as
the life that is breathed into it. There
have been periods in our Party life
when the Party Constitution was a
lifeless document which had little
meaning in our everyday life. In re-
cent years many of our members
never saw a copy of our Constitution,
and few of our Party bodies lived by
the provisions of the Constitution ex-
cept in a general way.

I believe the present mood in the
Party won't permit this to happen
again. The new constitution is the

 

 

214 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH' CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

true, democratic and thoughtful prod-
uct of our whole Party, and a far
better Constitution than the one
being supplanted. There is a uni-
versal determination to base our
functioning on its principles, and to
respect and enforce its provisions.
This Constitution can become a liv-
ing, growing instrument in the pro-
cess of making our Party more dem-
ocratic, more cohesive, more effec-
tive, and better understood by the
great mass of American workers.

It is in this spirit that we submit
through the reports of our sub-com-
mittees the draft for our new Party
Constitution.*

C/1.: The next order of business is the
report of the sub—committee of the Con-
stitution Committee on the Preamble.
Comrade Ross of Minnesota.

Carl Ross: I am reporting for the
majority of this committee, recom-
mending adoption of the Preamble,
with certain changes which I shall indi-
cate.

Your committee was composed of
some nineteen members, worked at
great length, and came to the conclu-
sion that it would be necessary to sub-
mit a majority and minority report.

What are we dealing with in this
question of a preamble? We are here
attempting to give a short, program-
matic basis for the work of our Party,
an approach to which has already been
established and dealt with elaborately
in the resolutions of this convention.
Essentially, our question is: are we
satisﬁed with this Preamble as pre-

 

" The text of the Constitution, as adopted
by the Convention appears on page 335.

sented to you as a brief, conclusive
summary of the basic principles and
purposes of our organization?

The ﬁrst action of our committee
was to affirm, by a vote of 12 to 3,
to proceed to act on that draft which
has been before the Party for discus-
sion these last several months.

I would say that the most substan-
tial debate and discussion revolved
around the formulation of paragraph
6, and that is what I would like to
deal with in the main.

Our Committee was in a dilemma

because we had no previous action -

of this convention by which to guide
ourselves at the time we met. Sub-
sequent to that, this body has adopted
a resolution which deﬁnes clearly, in
unmistakable language acceptable to
this convention, the attitude of our
Party toward some questions of its the-
oretical base, and has in fact, in one of
the paragraphs of that resolution, es-
tablished essentially the identical word-
ing your committee here has. I would
call attention to the fact that para-
graph 6 of this preamble is worded
in the language of the resolution the
convention voted upon one-half hour
ago, with the exception of three words.
Those three words in paragraph 6 are
in the third line—“generally valid”
and “work” before the word “prin-
ciples.” It was the judgment of a ma-
jority of your committee that the ad-
dition of these three words serves to
emphasize the general universality of
basic Marxist principles, and to make
more clear the meaning and intention
in adopting this preamble.

A number of State conventions

SESSIQNS OF THE CONVENTION 215

adopted the draft as it was presented
to them, but a substantial number
also amended it. Apparently, there
were expressed in some conventions
some misgivings that the words and
purpose might, in the context of that
paragraph, imply some reservations as
to the general validity or universality of
basic Marxist principles. The Michi-
gan convention, the Illinois convention,
satisﬁed themselves that they had ap-
proaches which were adequate by re-
writing those sentences slightly, and
then adopting them, including the
word “interpret.” You will note that
the ﬁrst sentence here has become a
separate sentence which, in the judg-
ment of those conventions, expressed
that thought of the universality of
Marxist ideas, and then proceeded to
state afterwards, in a separate sen-
tence, that the Party interprets, ap-
plies, and strives to develop those
principles. We thought this was sound
thinking, and should guide our con-
vention here.

We gave considerable thought to
the question of the word “interpret,”
which I mentioned has been acted
upon in a previous resolution. The
Michigan, Illinois, California, New
England, Eastern ‘Pennsylvania,
Western Pennsylvania, Minnesota
and Colorado conventions, and a
majority of the resolutions commit-
tee of the New York convention,
voted to retain the word “inter-
pret.” We felt that our recom-
mendation was in keeping with this
spirit of the major state organiza-
tions of our Party.

I should say that the New York
convention, while it had committee
action, referred those directly to this
convention.

We had in our committee pro-
posals and motions recommending
that the Word “Marxism-Leninism”
should be either substituted for or
inserted in this paragraph. It was
the judgment of the committee that
our formulation adopted ﬁrst by a
vote of IO to 4, and reaﬂirmed later
by a vote of II to 7, was adequate
and was correct to express our
thought on these matters.

The issue here is not an issue of
what theory the Party is based upon.
That is established. The question
solely is how to state that approach
in this preamble. Nor is it a question
here of deﬁning conclusively and
deﬁnitely all of our approaches to
questions of theory. That is dealt
with in our resolutions. In our judg-
ment, the sole matter is the merits
of the Wording of this particular
approach, in which I believe it is
the thinking of the majority that we
speak of our theoretical principles
interchangeably as scientiﬁc social-
ism as the principles deﬁned by
Marx, Engels and Lenin, or as
Marxism-Leninism. And in the con-
text of a document intended to be
used as a deﬁnition of the basis of
membership in our Party to new
members, and intended as a public
statement of our purposes, we strove
to ﬁnd that formulation of our prin-

 

 

    

   
 

216 PROCEEDINGS’ OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

ciples that is most generally ac-
cepted, most generally understood,
and would in such language make
clear the intent of this Party with
respect to the public declaration of
its aims. _

I would move, Comrade Chair-
man, the adoption of this majority
report, as presented. I should add,
however, that this committee was
also charged with the task of mak-
ing recommendations with respect
to the statement of purposes of the
organization, which is on the bottom
of the same sheet, and appears as
Article 2 of the Constitution. Your
committee voted to bring before this
body without any disagreement in
the committee a formulation slightly
revised, which we felt broadened the
scope of the statement in the draft.

You will recall that the draft re-
ferred to the fact that the Party,
exercising its constitutional rights
and working in the electoral process,
especially by projecting candidates,
strives to promote certain ends. We
felt that the wording of this pur-
pose, as now projected, is broader,
more deﬁnitive, and more accurate
in deﬁning the mode of operation or
method of struggle by which our
Party proceeds to work towards this
end—that is, the purposes of this
organization are, through exercising
our democratic and constitutional
rights, and participating in the elec-
toral process and political life of our
nation to promote, etc. I submit also

this proposition with respect to the
re—formulation of the purposes as
a motion for approval by this con-
vention.

I stated, but was requested to state
again, that the actions on the New
York amendment with regard to the
preamble were committee recom-
mendations referred to this conven-
tion. The New York convention
never did ﬁnd time to act upon
them during its deliberations.

C/1.: You have heard the report
of the majority. We will now hear
the minority report.

Speal{er for the Minority: I was
asked, on behalf of the minority, to
make this report. But, in all fair-
ness, I must say that this task was
given to me in the last few minutes;
therefore, I am not adequately pre-
pared to make a minority report.
However, I think Comrade Ross has
given a detailed analysis of what
has happened in the committee. A
big discussion was held around the
words “as interpreted” and I think
that this discussion has been held
in all State conventions of the Party,
as reported by Comrade Ross.

However, very brieﬂy, it was the
feeling of the minority that to use
the words “as interprete ” would
water down and Weaken the meaning
of Marxism—Leninism in our Consti-
tution. We felt that Marxism—Len-
inism is a universal science, used by

all Communist parties. To put in
the words “as interpreted” would

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

lead us into all kinds of misgivings,
and as I said before, weaken the
concept of this thing.

Therefore, I would very brieﬂy
like to present the minority view-
point on this question, which, as
Comrade Ross has said, was on a
vote by 11 to 7. We propose the fol-
lowing: I shall very briefly read the
proposed changes that we recom-
mend.

The first sentence should read:
“The Communist Party of the
United States is an American work-
ing class political organization,
which bases itself upon the principles
of scientiﬁc socialism, Marxism-Len-
inism.” That’s the only change in
that paragraph.

In the sixth paragraph, we pro—
pose the following change: “The
Communist Party bases its theory
generally on the democratic heritage
of mankind, and particularly on the
principles of scientiﬁc socialism,
Marxism—Leninism. These univer-
sally valid principles the Commu-
nist Party of the United States strives
to creatively apply and develop fur-
ther, in accordance with the require-
ments of the American class strug-
gle and democratic traditions. We
propose to continue to examine all
aspects of our theory. The Party
must discard those concepts and poli-
cies which the experience of the
World working class have proved in-
valid and to formulate whatever
new concepts are necessary.”

217

I move to adopt the report of the
minority.

C/2.: We will proceed with the dis-
cussion, with the following rules, two
for and two against.

Ianet (New ]er.s'ey): For thema-
jority report: Comrades, I believe we
have an extremely important document
before us. When we go back to our
states, to the people whom we repre-
sent, and to the many people whom
we want to interest in our Party, we
are not going to be able to go back
to them with a 50,000 or so word reso-
lution which we are in the process of
adopting today. We are going to go
back to them with some simple ideas,
with some simple documents. And
therefore, I think that the preamble
to our constitution, which boils down
the many ideas we have been debating
for three days now, becomes one of
the most major contributions of this
convention.

Therefore, I think the wording of
this document is very important. And
I don’t think we are quibbling around
the term “interpreting.” I, like many
other comrades, have sat in Smith Act
trials—as an observer, fortunately-—
and have heard all kinds of interpre-
tations of our theories. I have heard
what the government has to interpret,
and I have heard some of our own
writings, unfortunately, which I think
all of us would shrink from today.

I think it is very important for
us to state here, in a positive and af-
ﬁrmative way, what the Communist
Party of the U.S.A. today has to say
about its program, its policies and its

218

theories. And it is in that sense that
I am very much in favor of incorporat-
ing the word “interpret” into this re-
port. ’ .
I will not take up the time of the
convention by going into other ques-
tions, and I am fully in accord with
the majority report. (Applause.)

Paul (New York): For the minority
report: First of all, I agree very much
with the sense of the changes advo-
cated by the minority report, and I feel
called upon to rise to speak on it, par-
ticularly since I am mandated by the
decision of the New York State con-
vention on this subject. First, I would
like to state that the reporter for the
majority was in error when he said
that the New York State convention
did not decide on this question. We
did not take up the preamble. How-
ever, in adopting unanimously the gen-
eral sense of the draft resolution, we
added three fundamental amendments
to the draft resolution. I will not deal
with the others on imperialism and
on internationalism, but I would like
to deal with and read the amendment
which was adopted unanimously on
Marxism-Leninism. And I think it is
incorrect for comrades to avoid this
convention knowing that we stated at
our convention that we must build the
Communist Party on the solid founda-
tion of the American working class,
that our Party must be based upon the
principles of Marxism and Leninism,
as creatively applied to concrete Ameri-
can conditions.

Therefore, I think it is important
to register that there is great senti-
ment in many State conventions, and

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

among many of the delegates here,
that the question of interpretation-
however We have adopted it so far-
does not mean that we intend to water
down the fundamental principles of
Marxism-Leninism, and that we cer-
tainly do not intend not to base the
theoretical and practical approach of
our Party on the theory and practice
of the working class throughout the
world. And I think that, in the sense
that it is here used, it does do away
with the idea that We will only ‘apply
principles as we interpret them. But
we base ourselves on these fundamen-
tal universal principles, and that we
are going to make the effort to use
these principles in such a way that we
can further and develop the class strug-
gle in this country so that we can build
mass struggles, so that we can learn
from the experiences of the working
class and people, and so that we can
become real, practicing Marxists, in
the sense that we are identiﬁed with,
that we can give political leadership
to the Working class movement through-
out our country. (Applause.)

Morris D. (New York): My amend-
ment is as follows: at the end of the
second paragraph, if the following
would be put through, then I would
be for the whole resolution. And I’ll
read a sentence or two. The end of
the second paragraph. “We see the
possibility of containing or restraining
violence on the part of the bourgeoisie,
which will do everything within its
power to prevent such a peaceful transi-
tion. We believe that the people
marching irresistibly toward socialism
will and can by its vigilance and

strength enforce its will against the
class enemy. This above all is true:
we must at all times be prepared to
meet the frantic efforts of the hour-
geoisie to thwart the will of the peo-
ple.”

C/2.: The committee says it’s unac-
ceptable, so your amendment is out
of order. — Now, you’re speaking
against.

Morris D.: Against majority: We
went on record in a two-pronged
ﬁght, against right opportunism and
left sectarianism, but in reading all
the amendments on the constitution,
we ﬁnd an extreme partisan effort to
negate what we went on record be-
fore. And that’s why I ﬁnd myself
against the amendments—against this
amendment that is offered now, and
I feel that, for the sake of living up
to our pledge that we made on our
vote, that we are not in a position to
discuss things in a rational manner,
that these resolutions should be turned
back to the National Committee to be
edited in the spirit of the resolution
that we passed on the question of
what is the main danger, and where
do we go from here.

Fred Blair (Wiscon:z'r2): Against the
minority report: I was a member of the
committee, and we had hours of very
instructive and varied discussion.
There is not as vast a difference be-
tween the feeling of the majority and
the minority in this committee as some
might think.

What was the position of our State
delegation and our State convention?
We were against including the words
“Marxism-Leninism” in the preamble,

219

and we also were against including
the word “interpret.” Hearing the ar-
guments here, particularly the Smith
Act defendants, and others who have
had experience, I have come to the
conclusion that the formulation we
have here is the best-—it meets the aims
of all of us, the real aims. It was in-
jected into our convention that without
putting Marxism-Leninism in words
in here, we would not be Marxist-
Leninists. That was the contention.
Yet the same people did not argue for
including the words “dictatorship of
the proletariat.” We’re beginning to
understand, we want to get at the sense
of things, and explain the sense to the
American workers and farmers and
Negro people, and not just repeat in-
cantations! (Applause.)

I understand the feelings of many
comrades in New York and elsewhere,
that if we don’t say Marxism-Lenin-
ism, we might leave the essence out.
I say the essence is here, and let us
not be confused between essence and
words. After we have abandoned many
other terms that we used to consider
so precious, for the sake of explaining
the sense, let’s not hang onto these
words “Marxism-Leninism” like a kid
hangs onto a rag doll when he is four-
teen years old before he goes to sleep.

William Patterson (New York): I
think these amendments are funda-
mental to this preamble. And, if that
were denied, I would have to ask a
point of special privilege as a Negro
Communist. I want two amendments,
one to the ﬁrst paragraph, and an-
other to the fourth paragraph, and the
one to the fourth paragraph, with the

220 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

State of Georgia already repudiating
the 14th, and 15th amendments to
the constitution of the United States,
is in my opinion of paramount im-
portance to the Communist Party.
And I want to speak on it. The Pre-
amble reads:

“The Communist Party upholds the
achievements of American democracy
and defends the United States Consti-
tution and its Bill of Rights,” and I
would like to add after that “particu-

‘larly the 14th and 15 amendments,

which guarantee equality to the Ameri-
can Negro.” I believe that this is abso-
lutely necessary, in view of the strug-
gle against the Constitution itself
which is now being waged in the
South.

C}z.: The committee says there is no
objection to that. It will be included.
Both the majority and the minority
agree to that inclusion. '

Patterson: Thank you. Good. I’m very
happy. (Applause) '

The second sentence reads, “It cham-
pions the immediate and fundamental

interests of the workers and farmers,-

and all others.” Now, I recognize that
this “all others” and also the workers
and farmers, includes the Negro. I
recognize that fully. But I believe that
in a preamble of the Communist Party
of the United States, it is not suﬂicient
to place this question of Negroes in
such a vague way. I therefore want,
after the term “farmer,” inserted, with
special emphasis in some way, upon
the interests of the Negro people. In
other words, I want the question of
the Negro people highlighted, so that
we will distinguish ourselves in this

respect. from any other body, socialist
or otherwise, in the United States,
that would write such a preamble.
(Applause.)

R055: The Committee had felt that
the preamble was putting a new em-
phasis on the whole struggle against Iim
Crowism in America. However, I
think the amendment is well taken,
and would suggest that the sense of it
be agreed upon, and in consultation
with Comrade Patterson, the exact
wording be worked out.

A Delegate: I would like the com-
mittee to consider one of the following
two proposals. Either to restore, in
paragraph 6, the word “cultural,” or
to consider the phrase reading “gen-
erally on the scientiﬁc, humanist and
democratic heritage.” I have the feeling
that just using the word “democratic
heritage” means that we are not ﬁnd-
ing the correct words for the words
“total sum of human -knowledge,”
which includes science, culture, etc.,
and this weakens the base of our
theory. I

Ross: The committee discussed this
word, the substitution of “democratic”
for "cultural” at some length, and
was unable to completely satisfy all the
members of the committee, including
myself. I would accept the amend-
ment proposed. It is agreed here, and
by the minority reporter, that it should
be accepted.

The Delegate: The second amend-
ment, Which I think has already been
decided by this convention as well,
in the resolution adopted today on
Marxism-Leninism.
that we change the words “generally

valid world principles” to “these uni-
versally valid princi les.” The words
generally can be interpreted in two
ways, and it’s not just semantics.

Ross: The entire committee agrees,
with the majority expressing itself to
the effect that this is acceptable, so long
as the word “interpret” appears in
the‘ paragraph. It would then read
“these universally valid principles.”

C/1.: That is part of the motion. Are
there any further amendments? If
not, we’ll put the question.

A Delegate: I think it is an uncon-
troversial amendment to strengthen
the sense of Comrade Patterson’s
amendment by making some reference

in the section on “purposes” to the

struggle for the rights of the Negro
people. I think it’s essential, when we
talk about struggling to promote the
welfare of the working people of the
United States, that some phrase be
added in terms of struggle for the full
rights of the Negro people.

.Cl1.: The Committee is in accord-
ance with the sentiment. They ﬁgure
it’s covered; if they can ﬁx it, they
will. .

All those in favor of adopting the
majority report? [Vote taken.] Car-
ried.

This vote automatically negates the
minority report.

[Owing to pressure of time, the
report of Constitution Sub—Commit-
tee No. 2, Louise Todd (California)
Chairman, was not delivered, but
a motion was passed to include it in
the record. The report foll0ws.]

Louise Todd: This sub-committee

had before it amendments to the
draft resolution on the vanguard
role, democratic centralism and
monolithic unity. Represented on the
committee of 17 were the districts of
New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illi-
nois, Minnesota, Alabama and Cali-
fornia.

VANGUARD ROLE: The following
state conventions endorsed the NC
amendment on Vanguard Role:
Washington, California, Minnesota,
Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Ier-
sey, Eastern Pennsylvania, Connecti-
cut and Utah.

The New York state convention
did not act on this amendment.
However, represented in the decisions
placed before our sub-committee were
the views of the Constitution Com-
mittee of the New York State Con-
vention. A number of county organi-
zations reported through their repre-
sentatives on our sub—committee, en-
dorsement or agreement with the
NC amendment on vanguard role.

There was general agreement that
this amendment clariﬁes the meaning
of the concept vanguard role as dis-
tinct from the term leadership or
leadership role.

A Marxist working class party,
fulﬁlling the role of class vanguard,
has a distinctive role to play in de-
veloping socialist consciousness
among the working people as well
as fulﬁlling a role of leadership in
the everyday struggles.

222 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

The consensus of opinion in the
sub-committee was that the NC draft
amendment be reformulated to make
more clear this distinction. There-
fore, you have before you an
amended draft which in substance
does not change the general content
of the NC amendment but attempts
to place the question more clearly.
This was felt to be necessary be—
cause some of our greatest sectarian
errors in the past can be traced to
wrong concepts of what the term
“vanguard role” meant. In moving
toward the correction of these errors,
our Marxist organization needs to
face up to the problem of learning
better how to fulﬁll our leadership
role.

The draft we now present re-
ceived the unanimous vote of the
sub—committee.

DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM AND
MONOLITHIC UNITY: The following
state conventions endorsed the NC
amendment on Democratic Central-
ism (some with certain qualiﬁcations
which I will indicate):

New Jersey (majority report, 26 for,
15 against. Minority report, 17 for,
24 against).

Ohio—in accord with the general
aims of the amendment. Registered
the opinion that the “substance
of the concept should be retained
as a basic principle.”

California—-“We think a debate on
the term ‘democratic centralism’

a fruitless one.” Their resolution
devoted itself to delineating sub-
stance of organizational principles
guiding the organization.

Michigan—Interpreted NC amend-
ment as “in harmony with the spe-
ciﬁc provisions in the draft con-
stitution on the practice of democ-
racy in the Party.”

New England, Eastern Pa., Connec-
ticut, Utah, Minnesota, New York
did not act at State Convention.

State Conventions which took action
against NC amendment: Illinois
and Washington.

MONOLITHIC UNITY: The sub-com-
mittee agreed unanimously with the
paragraph at the end of the NC
amendment on the question of mon-
olithic unity, namely, to drop the
use of the term, retaining concept
of a common ideology as essential
to a Marxist Party. A

DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM: The
scope of the work of the sub-commit-
tee did not include the question of
the root causes of bureaucracy in our
Party. However, because of the
strong sentiment on this question
both within our sub-committee and
generally in the Party, we wish to
call attention to the section in the
draft resolution dealing with this
question—pp. 59 to 62, entitled “Bu-
reaucratic Concepts of Party Organi-
zation.”

The amendment we are now dis-
cussing is directed toward this sec-
tion of the draft resolution. In ap-

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 223

proaching the question of demo-
cratic centralism, our effort in the
committee was first of all to ﬁnd
the areas of agreement on which
to base our action. We found that
there was general agreement on:

(a) overcoming the bureaucratic
suppression of democracy in Party
life, for a revitalization of our Party
on the basis of broadening the possi-
bilities for democratic expression;

(b) establishing the right to dis-
sent even after decisions have been
reached;

(c) maintaining a cohesiveness
and unity so that we can be an ef-
fective force in carrying out our poli-
cies once the majority has decided,

The questions on -which sharply
divergent views were expressed in
the sub—committee related to the con-
cept of democratic centralism. In
this regard, the opinions expressed
fell approximately into three cate-
gories:

The view holding that democratic
centralism, as a theory and system,
was the root cause of bureaucracy
in our Party.

The View holding that the correc-
tion of our practices of democratic
centralism was needed, with a re-
aﬂirmation of democratic centralism
as the basic concept underlying our
Party organization.

The View holding that it is not
now necessary to decide the question
of basic concept at this time (not

confusing this with the proposal not
to use the term to describe our or-
ganizational principles), but rather
it is now necessary to deﬁne in sub-
stance the component parts of demo-
cratic centralism as they apply in
the American party, guaranteeing
their implementation in the draft
constitution in such a way as to help
correct the practices of our Party
and the distortions in the concept it-
self which resulted from these prac-
tices.

(The committee did not act spe-
ciﬁcally on the question of use of
the term, on which there appeared
to be general agreement in any case.
The arguments for dropping the use
of the term itself have been fully
stated in the pre-convention discus-
sion—because bureaucracy has be-
come identified with the term demo-
cratic centralism; because it does not
adequately describe our organiza-
tional principles in terms under-
stood by both our membership and
people outside the Party; that the
substance of the principles need to
be clearly enunciated.)

In view of the positions in the
sub-committee, We drafted an
amendment to the draft resolution
which incorporated the areas of
agreement, on substance of the or-
ganizational principles to guide our
organization. The vote in the sub-
committee on this amendment: For
IO, against 6, abstaining 1..

An amendment was offered as

224

follows in the sub-committee-—(to
replace the ﬁrst sentence in para-
graph 2 of the amendment) : “Demo-
cratic centralism provides the Hex-
ible guide to establishing the correct
relation within the Party between
democracy and centralism, in ac-
cordance with our circumstances
and conditions. There is no single
formula for establishing the proper
relations between centralism and de-
mocracy for all countries and in all
conditions.”

This amendment was defeated by
a vote of IO to 6, I abstaining.

Those voting against this amend-
ment did so not all for the same
reasons. Some voted against it be-
cause the amendment was a judg-
ment on a question we are not at-
tempting to resolve at this time (the
theory of democratic centralism).
Since the majority of the sub-com-
mittee regard the draft amendment
as an expression of areas on which
we could agree, leaving aside at this
time any deﬁnitive action or ﬁnal
judgment on the theory of demo-
cratic centralism, the amendment
as formulated is aimed at creating a
basis for correcting practices in our
Party. I

Therefore, the action of the sub-
committee needs to be understood
as follows: As not rejecting demo-
cratic centralism; as not abandoning
the effort to retain and implement
the correct and ﬂexible balance be-
tween democracy and centralism; as

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

not judging the question of whether
bureaucracy stems from the system of
democratic centralism; nor is it a re-
aﬂirmation of democratic centralism
as such.

It was the feeling of the majority
in our sub-committee that we have
not had the necessary examination
and debate on this question, and in
the light of the international dis-
cussions on democratization of the
internal life of many Marxist parties
(Britain, Italy, Poland, China and
other countries), this subject will be
under discussion for some time.

C /1.: The Chair calls on Tom Den-
nis, of Michigan, reporting on the re-
mainder of the constitution, and
the rule here will be two for, two
against, three minutes.

Tom D'em2z':: Before I begin, I
would suggest that‘ each of you
thumb through all of your material
and ﬁnd the revised or amended
cop-y of the draft constitution which
was distributed to you this afternoon.
While you’re looking for that, I’d
like to say a few words about the
problems.

Comrades, the sub-committee of
the Constitutional Committee had
before it for consideration some 274
changes and amendments to those
sections of the draft constitution,
which starts with Article III through
the end of the constitution. They
ranged from as few as 6 on a single
article to as many as 92 on a single
article. The character of many of

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 225

these resolutions, amendments and
changes were editorial in nature.
The comrnittee—and there were
some that had considerable import
——and the committee considered all
of these. We also, you should real-
ize, had the main body of the con-
stitution, which contained some of
the knottiest and most controversial
parts of the constitution in relation
to organization. On most of the
changed amendments, the commit-
tee was unanimous in relation to
them. There were some that were
decided by majority vote.

I would like at this moment to
ask the convention to join me in a
special commendation to the Cali-
fornia delegation and the California
district for the contribution which
they made in helping us come to
conclusions that we did in relation
to the draft constitution. Other dis-
tricts made important contributions
also, b-ut this particular district, I
think, made the main contribution
as far as our deliberations were con-
cerned.

C/1.: The press committee has
called a matter of some urgency
here. They have to meet a deadline.
They want to read a very brief state-
ment here, and get the concurrence
of the convention.

Si Gersonz It is a wire to
Richard Nixon, Presiding Oﬂ'i-
cer, U. 8. Senate, and Vice Presi-

dent, and Samuel Rayburn, Pre-
siding Oﬂicer, House of Representa-
tives, Washington, D. C. “On this
date, February 12th, the celebration
of the birthdays of Abraham Lin-
coln and Frederick Douglass, the
16th National Convention of the
Communist Party, U.S.A., calls upon
the Senate of the United States and
the House of Representatives to help
speed up the implementation of the
U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on de-
segregation of schools, and? in
strengthening the defense of the
civil rights of all the American peo-
ple. This would be a proper recog-
nition of the birthdays of these two
great Americans.” I move the adop-
tion of this telegram.

C/z.: Moved and seconded. Car-
ried.

T. Dennis: I would also like to in-
dicate how we went about trying
to wrassle through this maze of
material. First of all, we divided the
various articles up among the mem-
bers of the committee, and gave the
proposals to them, after one of the
secretaries, Joe Roberts, had already
divided up the main ones according’
to article, so that they could go over
them and weed out those that were
similar, etc., and they came back
to the committee again considering
the various amendments. Then we
found that we were in such a rough
stage that we decided to set up little
sub-committees in order to expedite

226

things, and they came back with con-
crete formulations based upon con-
sidering the amendments, and then
the recommendations were voted
upon by the committee.

I would like to read to the con-
vention only those sections and ar-
ticles in which changes are proposed
of the draft constitution which you
had for discussion in your various
districts, and then, when I ﬁnish
all of these, I will move for its adop-
tion, and throw the thing open for
the consideration of the convention.
I would also like to call your atten-
tion to the fact, and suggest you
keep this very much in mind, that
there is a provision in the constitu-
tion for referendum on any very im-
portant changes that are necessary.

We will start with Article III. In
section /2, the only amendments
there are:

“Applicants for membership . . .
Such applications shall be subject
to approval by a majority vote of
the club to which the new member
is presented.” Further in the same
article, section 4, is amended. You
see the underlined portions are the
amended portions. “Party members
three month: in arrears in payments
of dues. . . . (it was originally six)
cease to be members in good stand-
ing. . . .”

Now, in Article IV, that was
changed from “regular ﬁnancial re-
ports” to “at least quarterly.”

Section 2, this sectio-n was replaced

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

—this represents a replacement of
the original draft.

Now in the next section there
was an amendment in section 5 of
the same article. “All oﬂicers of lead-
ing committees derive their authority
from these committees. Policy deci-
sions shall be made only by the re-
spective committee. Committees and
oﬂicers must report regularly on their
activities to the body which elected
them, or the body to which they are
responsible.”

Now turn the page to section 4,
Article V. The only change in that
was changing the sixty days to ninety
days’. I won’t read the whole thing;
1t’s not necessary.

In sectio-n 5 of that article, the
following was substituted: “The Na-
tional Convention shall elect a Na-
tional Committee in the following
manner: All State Conventions
meeting before the National Con-
vention shall elect their members
of the National Committee to be
submitted to the National Conven-
tion for approval. Approximately
two-thirds of the total number of the
National Committee shall come from
the districts, and one—third are to
be elected at large by the conven-
tion as a whole. The scale of rep-
resentation to be determined by the
National Convention.”

Now, in section 9 of the same ar-
ticle, there’s only one change. In
the second paragraph, second sen-

 

 

of

re

:i-

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 227

tence, “a majority” was changed to
“two-thirds.”

Section 12 of the same article,
page 4. The following is the amend-
ment: “Policy questions shall be re-

viewed or new policies submitted for

adoption on the initiative of one-
third of the members of the National
Committee.”

I move the adoption of the entire
Draft Constitution, as amended in
this report.

Ch.:i There is a minority report
which, the Chair is advised, is a
very brief one. We will now hear
from the minority.

Charles D. (New York): My min-
ority report is that I am in agree-
ment with the majority report on all
points except the two points on which
I make amendments.

In Section V, Article V, section
9, third paragraph, the last sentence
reads: “Co-nflicting views in the Na-
tional Committee on all major pol-
icy questions and arguments ad-
vanced for or against a proposed
policy shall be made known to the
membership.” My amendment is to
add this qualifying phrase: “In the
form and to the extent permitted
by circumstances.” In the mandatory
form in which it stands now, there
might be whole pamphlets to be
published about discussion. The
member may insist on a whole
speech to be published. There will
be a bulletin, and they will publish

excerpts, and so on. Another thing

we have to remember also is that
some discussions within the Na-
tional Committee are of such a na-
ture that they should not be dis-
closed in the exact form in which
they have been made. Now, that’s
one amendment.

And then, Article VI, on “Rights
and Duties of Members,” section 2,
page 4——paragraph 2, reads in the
amended copy, “Every officer and
member shall have the right to hold
and express a dissenting opinion on
any matter of Party policy with re-
spect to which a decision has been
made by majority vote of the ap-
propriate committee or Party con-
vention, provided that such dissent-
ing officer or member does not en-
gage in factional or other activity
which hinders or impedes.” Now,
the published draft at the respective
place reads as follows: “provided that
such dissenting oﬂicer or member
act: to carry out such policy so long
as it remains in effect, and does not
engage in factional, etc.,” and so on.
So my amendment there is to restore
the text of the original draft. That’s
all I wanted to make in my minority
report.

I move that these two amend-
ments be first acted upon as a minor-
ity report, and then, if they are ac-
cepted, the majority report would
be taken up as amended by the

minority report.

Ch.: The comrade clearly here is

228

trying to make a small minority report,
which in effect would be an amend-
ment to the majority report. It is
here before us as a minority report,
and we will now proceed with the dis-
cussion.

We’ll have two speakers for and
two against.

T. Dennis: It is called to our atten-
tion that no procedure was made for
bringing requests for review before the
organization. We felt to leave it like

that would lay the way open for shop-I

ping around, so we felt that an amend-
ment, which was proposed by the Ier-
sey delegation, and was acceptable to
the oﬂicers of the committee, should
be included in the motion to adopt
the constitution. It reads as follows
(last paragraph of Section ):

“In such case, the proposed policy
change desired by a club shall be put
in writing and submitted to the next
higher body, which shall distribute
copies of the proposal to all clubs in
its jurisdiction for their action.”

C/2.: Now, if we can get this report
ﬁnished, the Chair is going to make a
suggestion about our getting some-
thing to eat. So. We’ll have two
speakers for and two against.

Sid (New York, Upstate): For the
majority, I want to point out that,
in dealing with a question such as this,
there are many many hundreds of
problems. The committee, which is com-
posed of many divergent viewpoints,
realized that, if it was to accomplish
the task set before it, which was to
establish a structure for the imple-
mentation of the preamble and the pur-
pose, it would be necessary to com-

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

promise, to act in the direction of
reaching agreement, not act in the di-
rection of reaching disagreement. The
disagreements were many, but there
was one basic agreement among the
whole committee. That agreement
was, that if we were to continue to
exist, we would have to exist only on
the basis of agreements, not on the
basis of disagreements. The main
agreement was that this organization
required democratization. The second
agreement was that it required the
pinning of responsibiilty upon individ-
uals, so that the dangers of bureaucracy
would be as much as possible elimi-
nated.

We on this committee feel proud
of our ability to unite, feel proud of
our ability to accomplish a given task
within a given limit of time, and
therefore feel that the majority report
as is should be accepted. Thank
you.
Glenn (California): For the major-
ity: Regarding this minority report,
I’m not pleading for this on the basis
of unity. I think something is right
or wrong because of principle, and if
the majority is wrong, I will not unite
with it if it is against principle. But
in this case, I don’t feel that the Party
of this country or any organization has
the right to go out and tell someone
to do something that they believe is
wrong. I think that this is opposite
to the entire moral code of human be-
ings—to do something wrong is not in
any sense Marxist.

The other reason I feel that this is
bad—although that’s the main reason
—-is that I think it just adds to the

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

over-all interpretation that the capi-
talists place on us, that we are a dic-
tatorship, and when we say “dictator-
ship of the proletariat,” we mean dic-
tating to the proletariat. And this is
not what I think we intend. So I
would like to see/us adopt the majority
report. (Applause.)

A Delegate: Point of procedure: I
think we are not concerned here with
“for” and “against”——we are con-
cerned with speciﬁc proposals. I’d like
to urge‘ that we have speakers on
amendments and that we vote on each
article of the constitution separately.
I know it takes time, but it’s only
this convention that has the power to
prepare the constitution for the Party.

C/1.: Comrade, it would take us hours
to do that.

T. Dennis: We have a couple of
amendments which the committee has
agreed to include. It may meet some
problem which is coming up, and
therefore I’d like to present it now.

Now, if we’ll turn to page 5. Section
I2, to be changed as folloWs—and I
think you will see the improved qual-
ity:

“The Communist Party recognizes
the right of any member to resign
without prejudice,” instead of the way
it is now. The committee has agreed
to accept this amendment. (Applause.)

A Delegate: I have two amendments
to strengthen the educational work in
the Party. In article IV, under Struc-
ture, the third paragraph under Sec-
tion I, the oﬂicers should include an
educational director as well as a club
chairman and a financial secretary.

T. Dennis: Acceptable. Proceed.

229

The Delegate: On page 3, in Article
IX. It says that among the responsi-
bilities are to organize and supervise
its political and organizational work.
I ask that we include educational Work
in that paragraph, as well.

T. Dennis: Acceptable.

T/ze Delegate: Another amendment:
Page 3, section 6. The sentence that
begins: “Members at large may be re-
called for cause by the aﬂinnative vote
of two-thirds of the members of the
National Committee, and vacancies in
the post of Member-at-large shall be
ﬁlled by a majority vote of the Nation-
al Committee.” Now, I am pretty ap-
prehensive about this. I feel that it
should say subject to approval by nation-
al convention or review. For this reason.
When the districts have the right to
recall members, they were the ones
who elected them. This is not true
of the members-at-large in the Na-
tional Committee. At the same time,
there is no speciﬁc provision made for
review.

A Delegate: On page 1, Article III,
section 3. The section reads, “A Party
member shall accept the Party program
as determined by the constitution and
conventions of the Party, belong to a
Party club and pay dues.” I propose
to add “and engage in the activities
of the Party.”

I

C/2.: I am advised this is in another
section—the same language, almost. It’s
in the rights and duties.

The Delegate: I would like to pro-
pose that it be placed in that section.

C/2.: The committee rejects it.

A Delegate: At the end of Article IV,

 

230 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the one on Structure, a new section:
“Any Party ofﬁcers may be removed
at any time from their positions by a
majority vote of the body which elected
them, or by the committee to which
they are responsible.” This would mean
the county committee, regional com-
mittee, and so forth, which is not pro-
vided in the present constitution, and
I don’t believe it is in contradiction
to what the report has been.

Cl2.: They have a provision in there
covering it; if I remember, it's two-
thirds. I

A Delegate: To be inserted prior to
Section 5. “When possible, in prepara-
tion for and prior to discussion on any
major policy by a leading body, sys-
tematic efforts shall be made to ascer-
tain the collective opinion of the mem-
bership on the question under consid-
eration by the widest means possible.
This collective opinion shall include
non-Party opinion to the extent pos-
sible, and once gathered, shall form
the basis of the discussion by the lead-
ing body concerned. When the policy
has been arrived at, it shall then be
submitted to the membership, as indi-
cated in Article VI, section 5.

Ch.: O.K. What does the committee
think?—The committee feels this is
covered. in other places.

A Delegate: Section 2, Article VI,
“Rights and Duties of Members.” After
“provided that such dissenting oﬂicer
or member does not engage in factional
or other activity,” I would amend to
take out “other,” as being a nebulous
term, and I also want to have removed
“Which hinders or impedes the execu-
tion of such policy--or endangers the

unity and solidarity of the Party,” be-
cause if you have a dissenting opinion,
you will not be able to say anything
if someone is going to say to you,
“This endangers the unity of the
Party.” Therefore, this is again a
danger to-—

C/2.: No speeches, please. (To Com-
mittee) Do you accept or reject? This
is rejected.

A Delegate: In Article III, section 4,
changing the length of time allowed
in arrears in payment of dues, tightens
up the Party organization beyond the
point of reality. We’ve all had experi-
ence with dues arrears which run to
a certain extent beyond what we would
like to see. We ﬁght for better pay-
ment of dues, but we are not going
to observe this condition if it is included
in the constitution. I propose changing
it back to the original statement that
six months in arrears loses good stand-
ing, and members who are twelve
months in arrears shall be dropped
from Party membership, including the
addition, after a personal effort has
been made to bring such members into
good standing.

Clz.: The committee rejects this be-
cause they say this is patterned after
the majority of amendments opposed
by the states.

A Delegate: I should like to strength-
en Article VI, section I, third para-
graph, by making the language more
positive, “Members shall strive to be
active”——to make it more positive by
deleting the word “strive” to make it
read “Members shall be active in carry-
ing out the program of the Party, in
circulating its press and literature, in

increasing their knowledge of scienti-
ﬁc socialism and agitating for it, and in
regularly attending club meetings.”

C/2.: The committee doesn’t agree.
Now, comrades, we have heard amend-
ments here for nearly an hour. Are we
ready to vote on the question?

A Delegate: Poifit of clariﬁcation:
There are two points here. Article IV,
section 2, paragraph 5, says that “the
state should elect its officers.” That
seems to be in contradiction to para-
graph 9 of that same section, which says
that the states can name ofﬁcers.

C/2.: To clear that up, the Commit-
tee wants to insert the word in that
paragraph in relation to “the state
committee shall name”—-let’s say, “such
oﬂicers who are not members of the
State Committee,” let’s put it that way.

[The Committee Chairman reads
off all accepted amendments.]

C/1.: The motion before the conven-
tion is to adopt the entire report of
the Constitution Committee as amend-
ed. [Vote taken.] The motion has
clearly carried the majority report,
and removed the minority report from
the ﬂoor.

T. Dennis: We have a motion now
from the committee on the dues struc-
ture problem. The committee moves
that the dues structure be revised,
effective 1958, and that the incoming
National Committee shall set up a spe-
cial committee to study the dues ques-

_ tion and the relation to ﬁnances, and

convene a national organizational con-
ference in the early fall to review and
adopt a schedule of dues structure,
in accord with the amendments sub-
mitted to this convention.

23x

The reason for this is that the con-
stitutional committee could not con-
sider the question of dues structure
because it is integrally bound up with
the whole ﬁnancial picture of the or-
ganization. As a matter of fact, the
committee was informed that practically
the entire income of the national or-
ganization is from dues at the present
moment.

We did not feel we had an opportu-
nity to review this‘ prior to bringing
the report in here, and therefore, we
brought in this motion so that it can
be done.

C/z.: All those in favor of the mo-
tion? [Vote taken.] I guess it’s carried.

The Presiding Committee now seems
to have returned to our midst. The
question before us is whether we con-
tinue or we go get something to
eat.

Comrades, we have just received a
greeting by cable to this convention.

“To the Communist Party of the U.S.A.
——The Central Committee of the Commu-
nist Party of China (applause) extends
hearty fraternal greetings to the 16th Na-
tional Convention of the Communist Party
of the U.S.A. Under the leadership of the
National Committee headed by Comrades
Foster and Dennis, the Communist Party
of the U.S.A. has in recent years carried
out heroic struggles for peace, democracy
and socialism in extremely diﬂicult con-
ditions. The Communist Party of China
wishes the 16th National Convention of the
Communist Party of the U.S.A. desired
success in defending the principle of in.-
tegrating the universal truths of scientiﬁc
socialism with the practical conditions of
the respective country, and on the basis
of Marxism-Leninism, consolidating the
Party, and strengthening proletarian in-
ternational solidarity. We wish the CPUSA
to achieve momentous advances in the
struggle for strengthening working-class

sive forces, and for vital interests of the
working people and civil rights. (Ap-

new success in the ﬁght to defend world
peace and develop friendly cooperation
among people of all countries. Signed:

All I can say is “Long Live the
Communist Party of China!” (Ap-
plause.)

Now, Comrades, let me have your
approval of our proposal for an act-
ing parliamentarian in place of
Comrade Ganley, who has to return
to Michigan. I’m sure We all ex-
press our thanks to Comrade Gan-
ley for a ﬁne job. (Applause.) We
propose as parliamentarian for this
ﬁnal session the delegate from East-
ern Pennsylvania, Dave Davis. All
those in favor, say Aye. Any op-
posed? So ordered.

Bill Albertson, of New York,
in the Chair.

C}z.: The Convention will please
come to order. Will Comrades Den-
nis, Foster, Ben Davis and Gates
please come to the platform?

The next point on the order of
business is the report from our newly
elected National Committee as to
the Secretariat or Board that they
are proposing. Comrade Gene Den-
ms.

Eugene Dennis: Comrade Chair-
man, as the delegates recall, the
Convention by previous‘ action in-
structed the twenty members of the
National Committee elected yester-
day to nominate a committee of
seven as a temporary secretariat. It
was clear to all of us that the elec-
tion, even of such an interim com-
mittee, was a very heavy responsi-
bility, and it required very serious
deliberation, and adequate consid-
eration of a number of very key
questions, such as the composition
and the calibre of such a commit-
tee, its ability to help guarantee and
implement the many decisions of
this convention and its main political
line. It also requires, as a neces-
sary part of such an undertaking,
that it provide a collective, and that
it would at least make a start to es-
tablish a team, even if it is only
temporarily constituted—a team to
blend some of the old in the leader-
ship and a number of comrades
who have not heretofore worked in
the center. And also in this team, to
guarantee that it represents differ-
ent points of view, but that it should
be so constituted that it will not be
paralyzed with this work, that it can
get down to and on with the work,
both in terms of internal problems
and making a beginning in helping
the entire Party move in the direc-
tion of mass activity, and a commit-
tee, of course, pledged to carry out
the decisions of this convention.

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 233

The comrades of the National
Committee met, as you well know,
under considerable duress—the time
factor, and the problems and the
strains with which all of us are con-
fronted during the closing hours of
the convention. The twenty mem-
bers of the National Committee felt
that more time was required, im-
possible in the few hours at our dis-
posal, to cope with the weighty
problem that you confronted us with.
We didn’t have suﬂicient time to go
into considering all the duties, the
functioning and the responsibility
of a temporary secretariat, nor to
get into at least some evaluation of
the work of the proposed members
for such a committee, as well as a
preliminary consideration of what
their individual responsibilities would
be in such a collective.

Confronted with this situation,
and we understand that the con-
vention was desirous of terminating
its sessions as quickly as possible,
we came up with an alternative p-ro-
posal, one which we believe is in
the spirit of the motion adopted on
this question, an alternative which
we believe has many merits in -its
own right, and one which will go a
considerable way towards meeting
what the convention desired, in re-
spect to the establishment of a tem-
porary secretariat.

Therefore, comrades, I present the
proposal unanimously adopted by all
members—all twenty members of the

National Committee-—which reads
as follows:

“That a National Administrative
Committee be set up, charged with
the responsibility of implementing
the decisions of the convention be-
tween now and the first full meet-
ing of the National Committee after
the State Conventions;

“That this National Administra-
tive Committee shall consist of all
resident members of the twenty
elected members of the National
Committee;

“That these shall work in the
closest consultation with all other
elected National Committee mem-
bers, who shall be polled on all ma-
jor policy questions; and

“That at the first meeting of the
full National Committee, which
shall follow upon the completion of
the recessed State Conventions, the
National Committee shall elect a
Board, a Secretariat, or other such
committee as may be necessary.”

This would then mean concretely
the following: The temporary Na-
tional Admnistrative Committee
would be composed of the following
comrades: George Charney, Benja-
min Davis, Eugene Dennis, Earl
Durham, Fred Fine, Bill Foster,
Iohn Gates, James Jackson, Charles
Loman, Sid Stein and Doxey Wil-
kerson. If this proposal is accepted,
it would enable this temporary Na-
tional Administrative Committee
to consult closely and work in col-

. a
if.

234 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

laboration with all members of the
National Committee including those
as far west as California, and addi-
tionally, it would make possible for
the Administrative Committee to in-
volve directly and in frequent meet-
ings, Comrades Claude Lightfoot,
Carl Ross, Carl Winter, and Dave
Davis.

I repeat, Comrades, it is the unani-
mous opinion and the earnest de-
sire of the twenty comrades of the
National’ Committee that you act
upon this favorably. We are of the
opinion that it is in the spirit of the
motion previously /adopted by the
convention, that at this particular
moment, it will provide a broader
representation than is presently pos-
sible in a committee of seven, that
the comrades enumerated above as a
collective and Working together, will
be qualiﬁed to cope with the needs
and problems of a national center
pending the election and action of
the full National Committee, which
will be toward the end of March,
and we believe that this committee
and its members are cognizant in a
new way, personally and in the be-
ginning of a new collective approach
to the problems of making a new and
a serious and a resolute effort to
achieve and to strengthen the unity
of the Party on the basis of the de-
cisions and the political line of this
convention.

Comrades, I move the adoption of
the recommendation of the twenty

members of the National Commit-
tee.

C/2.: The chair recognizes Comrade
Ben Davis to speak on the motion.

Ben‘ Davis: Comrades, let me express
my support of the proposal and say a
few words in addition. Our convention
is coming to an end. I think it has been
a very constructive and fruitful con-
vention. It is hammering out a line;
it is reafﬁrming our Party, to break its
isolation, to build our Party; it is
adopting the main line of the Draft
Resolution which has been hammered
out here, and it is now, with Com-
rade Dennis’ proposal, electing—I hope
it will be accepted—a collective lead-
ership.

Let me say, comrades, that this has
been a great contribution to the unity
of our Party, that this contribution
comes, in its biggest part, from the
membership of our Party as a whole,
and from the delegates to this conven-
tion acting as a united body, and
with a will for unity.

Let me say, comrades, that I sup-
port the line of our Party adopted
here, that I shall ﬁght for it, and fight
for it in the spirit of the unity which
expresses the will of this convention.

Now let me say also, comrades, that
I think that the degree to which there
has been factions or groupings or
circles of any kind in our Party-
let’s have an end to these now! (Ap-
plause.) And I assure you, comrades,
that I shall ﬁght in that spirit, and
that I shall do everything possible to
see that any such process in our Party,
which is un-Marxist, un-Leninist, and

-on-aL—An_-|—n._.A

 

 

[.

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 235

certainly wrong in the spirit of our
Party and achievement, I’ll see that that
does not happen.

We still have differences, comrades,
and we have to realize that these dif-
ferences are still to be fought out,
fought out in our Party’s getting back
to work and cementing its ties with
masses of people, and fought out inter-
nally on the basis of the spirit of unity
and line and collective leadership,
which I am sure that this convention
is going "to adopt. And that, in this
spirit, we now have a real basis upon
which we can have an exchange of

- comradely opinion, and ﬁght out what-

ever sharp diﬂerenccs we have in our
Party, and really become experienced
in this new democracy which must
infuse our whole Party.

It is in that spirit, comrades, that
I want to urge the adoption of the pro-
posal of Comrade Dennis, and that
we should end this convention on
such a high note of spirit and militancy
and newness and change and unity as
will guarantee that, in the coming
weeks and months, our Party will be
a big and powerful and important force
in American life. (Applause.)

Ch.: The Chair recognizes Com-
rade Gates.

Ia/m Gates: We have expressed——all
of us, many different points of view at
this convention. Some of us have lost
out "on these points of view, but no
matter who lost, the Party has won.
(Applause) This has really been a
new kind of convention for our Party.
Not only in the manner in which it
has been conducted, in the quality of
this discussion, but above all, in the pro-

gram and policies that we have
adopted. This program, in my opin-
ion, is genuinely a historic one, and
one which has had and is having and
will have an enormous impact on our
country. In fact, I do not recall a
convention of our Party which has had
such an impact on the country as this
one. I consider that the program which
we have adopted is an historic one
because of the decisions we have
adopted, and the approaches we have
developed towards a better understand-
ing of our Marxist theory, to help us
to do away, once and for all, with
the old approach toward our theory
that made of it a straitjacket and to
really use our theory as the science
that it is, which will liberate our
minds and free us to do what is neces-
sary to free the American workers
from capitalist exploitation and to
achieve socialism.

I believe we have made history in
the new approach that we have de-
cided upon with respect to interna-
tional working-class and Communist
solidarity, and that the best way that
we can promote this international
solidarity is on the basis of a program
that is in the true interests of the
American workers and nation, and one
in which our relations toward other
Communist parties and countries is
one of fraternal criticism and equality.

Lastly, I think this has been an his-
toric convention because, for the first
time, since we began to develop a
program along these lines, a conven-
tion of the Communist Party has ofIi-
cially adopted a program for an Ameri-
can road to socialism, along the lines

236

of a peaceful, constitutional struggle
.for socialism in our country.

I think, therefore, because of this
kind of a program that We have de-
veloped and adopted, we have laid the
basis for the unity of our Party. Not
a unity in which there does not con-
tinue to be differences, but in which
we are beginning to develop an at-
mosphere where we can discuss these
differences with tolerance toward each
other and mutual respect for each
other’s ideas.

I look now, as a result of this con-
vention, with full conﬁdence to the
future, and I believe that we have
adopted a program which will en-
able us to earn the conﬁdence of the
American workers and the nation. And
it is because of this that I second and
support the motion made here by Com-
rade Dennis and urge its unanimous
adoption by this convention. (Ap-
plause.)

C/2.: The Chair recognizes Comrade
Foster.

William Z. Foster: Comrades, I, too,
want to support this recommendation.
I think it is the best we can do under
the circumstances, which are quite dif-
ﬁcult, of course. And I, too, want to
support the general work of this con-
vention.

Over the past months, our Party
has confronted a whole series of very
serious problems, and these have called
upon us for our best knowledge of
Marxism-Leninism in working them
out. And during the course of this
discussion, something has happened
which has never happened before in
the history of the Communist Party,

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

and that is the tremendous role that
has been taken by the rank and ﬁle
of the Party in the districts in solving
many of these problems. (Applause.)
All sorts of questions--I could name
a dozen of them oﬁ’hand—that have
been solved, and some of them of the
most basic character, have been solved
by the discussion that has been carried
on in the Daily Worker and other
papers.

Now this Convention here is a con-
tinuation of this same healthy process.
I think everybody will agree, espe-
cially comrades who have been at pre-
vious conventions of the Party, that
this has been primarily a rank and
ﬁle convention. The oﬂicials of the
Party, as far as I have been able to
gather, have had not so much to
say as we have had in previous con-
ventions, I can assure you.

Now, comrades, the process of this
convention, it seems to me, has not
reversed what has been taking place
through all these months of discussion
in solving these various problems, but
has continued this process, and brought
us to a climax in the general line and
the various documents that have been
produced by the convention. And I
must say that I have voted for every
one of these documents, that I have
been present when they were adopted,
and so far as I know, there were no
others that I would vote against.

The work of this convention, it
seems to me we have got to understand
it, as Iohnny said, as a victory for the
Party, and not a victory for any
particular group or faction in the Par-
ty. (Applause.) Comrades, we have

 

 

ll’-
l/C

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 237

been passing through a very severe
test in every respect, and it would be
silly on our part to say that we have
resolved all the differences that exist
in the Party and amongst the lead-
ership. But I think we have done one
thing, and that is, we have solved
some of the biggest of these problems
in this convention, and we have laid
the groundwork for the solving of
more of them.-

Comrades, as I said in the opening
of this convention, the bourgeoisie of
this country was sure that we were go-
ing to split our Party in this conven-
tion. Well, we just didn’t do it! (Ap-
plause.) On the contrary, we have laid
the basis for unity, and comrades, if
we act as Communists should, my
opinion is that we should be able to
develop this unity from the point we
have arrived at here, and go forward
with the re-building of our Party.

I want to say again, as I said at the
beginning, this is the Communist Party
that you’re dealing with; this is not
an ordinary party; this is the party of
socialism. And we must understand
it as such. And we must cherish this
party. And no matter how sharply
we may struggle amongst ourselves,
we must always‘ bear in mind the unity
of the Party. There is nothing more
precious than the unity of our Party,
for without that, we have nothing!
(Applause.)

Clz.: Further on the motion?

William Mandel (New York): I’d
like to speak against the motion.

C/1.: Speak.

Mandel: For the most serious politi-
cal reasons. This convention has only

advanced far enough toward indepen-
dence to make the Party useful to the
Voice of America as a stick with which
to beat Communist Parties abroad.
It has not advanced far enough to be
acceptable to the American working
class or to the American people at
large. This was put in simplest words
the other evening by an industrial work-
er here, in rejecting nomination to the
National Committee offered by the
Gates group. He said that he wanted
to spend his time ﬁghting the capitalist
system, not ﬁghting communism.

C/z.: Comrade Mandel, are you
speaking on the motion that was made
by Comrade Dennis?

Mandel: I am speaking for rejection
of the motion to accept this Board as
proposed by Comrade Dennis.

C/2.: O.K., "continue. Complete your
three minutes.

Mandel: This convention, having
patched up unity between two irre-
concilable viewpoints, has failed in
what appears to be its very success.
The full independent element will be
the distinct minority in the full Na-
tional Committee of the Party. This is
because the most convinced adherents
of the Gates viewpoint will not reap--
pear at the reconvened State Conven-
tions to vote for New York’s eleven
members of the National Committee,
and the same thing will happen else-
where. Of my section’s delegation to
the State Convention, there were ﬁve
all-out supporters of the Gates posi-
tion. One, an effective seven—day-a--
Week community worker in the Party
force, refused even to attend the State
Convention when the compromise pol-

238

icy of the Gates leaders. became clear,
and has left the Party.

I am trying to explain why I am
against this, and I hope that the com-
rades will not take the few minutes-

C/2.: We will have order! Will you
complete your remarks, please?

Mandel: Thank you, comrade. Two
more of these five left after the State
Convention. Thus, after the constitu-
tion of the full new National Commit-
tee, the Foster-Dennis forces will be in
full command. These two men have
lost all possibility of respect of this
Party. Among the people from whom I
spring--the Jewish people——when they
didn’t open their mouths against the
contemptuous and chauvinistic action
of Pravda in deleting from Dennis’
article on the Stalin cult his words
on the extermination of Iewish cultural
ﬁgures. The American people will
never regard as independent a Party
marked in the slightest degree by the
presence of such leaders, or by half-
way statements on such policies, if that
is the future assured by this conven-
tion. I believe that the Gates views
contain a potential as great for Amer-

ica as those of Gomulka for Polish and ~

world socialism. I believe that an or-
ganization founded on those views
could, even today, and under condi-
tions of prosperity, win a hearing _for
socialism among the workers, Negroes
of all classes-~

C/1.: Your time is up, Comrade Man-
del. Be seated.

A Delegate: I want to speak in sup-
port of the motion. I feel we have had
a very good discussion from two differ-
ent points of view, which is the correct

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

Communist way of ﬁnding out where
we stand, having our differences out
openly, and then coming together on
a synthesized program of action. I
want to support the motion before the
house, and I am very happy if we can
go out of here united, all of us.

I am proud of the work of the rank
and ﬁle in this convention as well as all
over the country. I think we have had
some wonderful work done by our
leadership also, in preparing this con-
vention——the technical preparation as
well as the thinking that has gone into
the documents which have been laid
before us for us to tear apart or leave
as is. And we have done our best.
I think we have done a good job. We
still have problems. We still have a

lot of things to iron out. We still have.

personal differences. But those must
be subordinated, and we must go out
of here as Comrades, friends, co-
workers, all over the country together,
and show the imperialists that we can
not be destroyed in America. (Ap-
plause.)

Helen Winter (Mic/2igan): I want
to appeal to the delegates of this con-
vention to use some common sense
and sober judgment. Now, I believe
that when a committee of this charac-
ter comes out on the convention ﬂoor
with a unanimous recommendation,
we should give very serious thought
to reconsidering our former decisions
and adopt a decision that they have
suggested to us.

There seems to be considerable ap-
prehension among some comrades as
to the sincerity or the honesty or the
integrity of this proposal, and I would

SESSIONS or THE CONVENTION 239

like to allay all fears by just stating
a few facts.

Yesterday, in adopting your leader-
ship and election committee’s recom-
mendation, I am sure that you all un-
derstood that this committee of 20 is
only one-third of our total National
Committee to be ﬁnally constituted no
later than March 31st. Secondly, I am
sure you all understood that, what-
ever temporary secretariat comes
from this committee, it also will only
be in operation until the full meeting
of the National Committee, no later
than March 31st. Therefore, it seems
to me that, if the committee was able
to achieve a unanimous agreement, we
should do nothing more than approve
the report of this committee unani-
mously. And I would like to so sug-

gest. (Applause.)
C/1.: The question has ‘been called.
[Vote taken.] Carried and so ordered.

We will now vote on the report of
the committee. All in favor of the re-
port of the committee as delivered by
Comrade Dennis? [Vote taken.] It
is carried and so ordered.

C'h.: The next point on the order of
business is the continuation of the trade
union report. Comrade Winter recognized.

Carl Winter: In order that we may con-
clude the business of this convention, and
in light of the decisions you have just
taken, particularly on the basis of the
unanimous action, which declares confi-
dence in the capacity of our Party lead-
ership to execute the mandates of this con-
vention, the presiding committee proposes
that all the material relating to the trade
union resolution, all proposed amend-

ments, and all as yet undelivered re-‘

marks relative to that report which dele-
gates my care to prepare in writing,
shall be turned over to the National Com-
mittee for study for preparation of the

ﬁnal trade union resolution which as
quickly as possible shall be made‘ avail-
able to the Party membership. I so
move.

[The motion is carried.]

Ch.: Comrades, the presiding commit-
tee chairman has asked me to recommend
that this convention send its greetings to
one of our oldest trade union comrades,
who was one of our leaders in the Party’s
trade union work, and "at one time was a
leader of the workers in the International
Ladies’ Garment Workers Union. This
comrade would be present if it were not
a matter of her health. This comrade
has also, I believe, up until the 1945 con-
vention, when her health failed her, for
many years been a member of the Na-
tional Committee of our Party. The mo-
tion is that this convention send its greet-
ings and wishes for a return to health to
Comrade Rose Wortis. Are there any ob-
jections? Carried and so ordered. The
presiding committee, I assume, will write
the appropriate greetings.

The next point on the order of
business is the report of the Commit-
tee on Appeals.

lame: [ac/(son: Comrade Chair-
man, I would like to make a pro-
posal. In view of the lateness of the
hour, it is obviously quite impossible
to give adequate and ‘judicious re-
view to the accumulation of unre-
solved appeals to this convention.
Therefore, with the agreement of
waiver on the part of the comrades
appealing, I would like to propose
that all materials on the/ appeals be
referred to the incoming National
Committee, which shall be instructed
to act on these appeals within sixty
to ninety days. I would urgently ap-
peal, on the basis of good common
sense, in recognition of the hour,
without at all waiving the standard

 

240 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

rights of Communists with griev-
ances and appeals against various
committees and levels of leadership
at all future conventions, that this
procedure be adopted. I so move.

C/1.: The motion is, to refer the
recommendations of the committee
on appeals to the incoming Na-
tional Committee, with full power
to act within a period of sixty to
ninety days. [Vote taken.] The mo-
tion is carried.

C/2}: The next point on the order
of business is the report on a ques-
tion which, in the humble opinion of
your Chair, is as important as any
other question with which this con-
vention has been confronted. The re-
port of the “Save Our Press” Com-
mittee, Comrade Max Gordon.

Max Gordon: Comrades, I, too,
would like to be able to refer this
question. I will not take very much
time, but I feel that it is necessary
to place before the House the deadly
seriousness of a problem which
faces our movement. Unless the
convention, takes dramatic and dras-
tic action to change the situation re-
garding the circulation of The
Worker and the Daily Worker, this
movement will, within a very short
time, be deprived of all journalistic
expression—the major method by
which the Left makes its position
known both to the country, and to
the people of the Left.

You have before you a resolution
which was drafted by the Commit-

tee on the Press. The Committee
had several State and section con-
vention resolutions before it. Some
are incorporated in the resolution.
One, from Ohio, the Committee did
not go along with. This would have
urged our Party to propose the elimi-
nation of the Daily Worker. The
Committee, in its large majority,
voted emphatically that this conven-
tion affirm the Party’s determination
to ﬁght to maintain the Daily Work-
er. (Applause) *
Let me say just one word on the
Committee. There were 60 sched-
uled to be members of it. Twenty-
one were present. From New York,
there were supposed to be 35; there

were no more than half adozen. Yet

the comrades knew that the issue at
stake was whether or not this move-
ment, for the first time in 33 years,
was to have no public voice. This, in
short, is the problem that confronts
us.
Let me put the facts very bluntly
before you. In the past eight years,
the circulation of The Worker has
declined by more than 80 per cent.
The statement incorrectly said 75
per cent. The Daily Worker, by
two-thirds. The figures show that,
from about 80,000 Worker circula-
tion in 1949, we are down now to
about 14 and a half thousand. For
the Daily Worker, from 20,000 in
1949—in Ianuary of this year, it was
only 6,700. There has been a contin-
ued sharp drop this past year. And

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 241

the reason for that you comrades
are pretty well aware of. Number
one is the fact that, because of the
situation in the Party over the past
year, many of our Party organiza-
tions have just completely ceased to
circulate the paper, and as a result,
some 3,000 copies of Worker cir—
culation have been lost in bundles
circulated by the Party organiza-
tion. The seoond factor is that we
have completely failed to develop a
circulation campaign the result of
which has been a further drop of
some 3,000 Worker subs and some
550 Daily subs.

Immediately following this con-
vention, within the next thirty to
sixty days, we will lose several thou-
sand more readers unless there is an
immediate pick-up in the circula-
tion campaign. That is the problem
that confronts us.

The ﬁnances of the situation, the
statement before you, means that
we will have no possibi1ity—no
means by which to maintain the pa-
per. That is the situation that con-
fronts us right now.

I don’t want to say any more about
this, comrades, except to call your
attention to the conclusion of the
statement, that is the proposals that
we make. We ﬁrst propose that the
convention recognizes that the cir—
culation of the Marxist press is a
fundamental political necessity for
our Party, and that we resolve to end
the Party’s long neglect in this re-

gard, that this convention instruct
the incoming National leadership
and call on all incoming State and
local leadership, and particularly on
the re—convening State conventions,
to make this an essential and cen-
tral part of their order of business.

The convention expresses the de-
termination of our Party to strength-

en the Marxist press by throwing‘
its full backing to the improvement
of The Worker. There were many
comrades in the committee who felt
that special attention has to be paid
to the improvement in The Worker
as the means by which we approach
many people outside of our move-
ment. And at the same time, we
express the determination of the
Party to throw its full backing to
maintain the Daily Worker and im-
prove its circulation, especially in
New York. V

Now, comrades, the committee
also proposes that this convention
urge the staffs of the Daily Worker
and The Worker that they consider
the immediate launching of a joint
$150,000 Fund Drive and subscrip-
tion campaign to continue until

June 30th, with the Party throwing‘

its full weight and ‘resources into the
campaign in order to ensure its suc-
cess. Such a circulation and ﬁnancial
campaign, tough as it will be, is
decisive for the continued existence
of the two papers.

We also urge—the way we place
the question in the statement is that

242 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

we continue the drive, by recogniz-
ing that it has not gotten off the ﬂoor,
and give it a new initiative in the
launching of this new $150,000 drive.
We also propose that the Party be-
gin to pay some attention to getting
the paper back on the stands in the
many cities from which it has been
thrown off, and in New York City,
where it has also been taken off
many of the stands that we used
to have.

We call upon the convention also,
and the incoming National Com-
mittee, to initiate within the Party,
within the next several months, dis-
cussion on a State, and then on a
national scale, with regard to the
future of our paper, how it can be
improved, how we are going to cir-
culate, and how we are going to
ﬁnance it.

Well, comrades, no resolution by
itself can do the job. The extent
to which you comrades, the State
and local leaders of our movement,
get to work on this drive to save
the paper, as the central feature of
your activities, will be decisive for
the paper. (Applause.)

A Delegate: The statement of our
“Save Our Press” Committee points
out the reasons for the crisis and de-
cline of our labor press. At one point,
it mentions the sharp attack of reac-
tion. Another point is the errors of
our movement. This is very well put,
and I agree with it, but I would liketo

bring out another point.

On the other side of the report,
there is a section which says it consid-
ers that The Worker and the Daily
Worker are major journalistic expres-
sions of the viewpoint of the Commu-
nist movement. Here I want to bring
some criticism of the way the Daily
Worker has presented the Hungarian
question. I don’t think it presents it
from the viewpoint of the Communist
movement.

After the ﬁrst day of the Hungarian
outbreak, the Daily Worker seems to
have had a very good standpoint‘—-
point of view, where it brought out
that the counter-revolutionary forces
had taken advantage of the situation
in Hungary, and that they created and
were the main force of the conditions
there. But soon after—I should put it
this way, after the Imre Nagy gov-
ernment made the statement that it
is a mistake to take this as a counter-
revolutionary event, from that point on,
the Daily Worker also changed its
stand.

I just want to bring out the point
that the Daily Worker has lost read-
ers, and the support of many good
old—timers, who have sacriﬁced their
lives to ﬁght against fascism and to
ﬁght for socialist internationalism.
They have stopped buying the Daily
Worker, reading the Daily Worker,
or supporting the Daily Worker. If we
want to do work for the upkeep of our
paper, of the saving of our paper, I
think the ﬁrst thing would be that
the Daily Worker should change its
previous stand on this question, and
at the same time, I would ask the Na-
tional Committee to do the same thing,
pointing out that probably our Com-

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 243

munist Party, if I am not mistaken, is
probably the only Communist Party
in the world that is taking this wrong
stand in connection with the Hungar-
ian movement. (Applause.)

C/2.: Will the comrades please keep
order during the discussion?

Another Delegate: Comrades, as a
member of the committee I would like
to say a few words in relation to the
program presented to you. All of the
people who attended the sessions had
criticism of one character or another
in relation to the contents of the pa-
per. However, every one of us simul-
taneously felt that the key question
before us at this moment was to save
the paper in the first place, in order
to guarantee that we have an organ,
an ideological weapon, which we can
use in the coming unfolding struggles
that lie ahead of us, particularly in
terms of the program adopted at this
convention. In light of that, we all
agreed that we would not permit the
differences which each and every one
of us may have to stand in the way,
that we would use all of our effort to
help to convince this convention that
this was the key question before us.

Comrade Gordon has related to us,
and the statement before us that the
Committee presented indicates the dire
necessity of our getting to work around
this main question. I hope the con-
sideration that this convention gives
to this question will be a lot more seri-
ous in this direction, or else we will
not have an organ to discuss whether
it has a good or a bad content, and
that will mean that all the discussion
here will have been in vain in the
first place.

So I would like to see the seriousness
of this question placed before us to-
day, rather than some of the other ques-
tions around which we can argue and
discuss for many, many hours, and
I am sure that all of us have some-
thing to say in regard to that.

A Delegate: As one who is vitally
concerned with the press, and has been
active with the press for a period of
about seven or eight years, I am very
glad to see this resolution, and I cer-
tainly urge its adoption. But I would
like to say a few words with regard
to the press, because it is our sharpest
weapon. It is the best weapon we
have. Yes, there are features on which
I have happened to disagree in the
past with Tlze Worker. In spite of
that, I have done everything in my
power to keep the paper going, even
as an individual, for the past period
of time.

Now, we have talked about isola-
tion here. We are not as isolated as you
would think, because I have found,
in my experience with the press, that
I personally have contact with hun-
dreds of people. The only problem
is that I don’t have more than two
arms and two legs. Now, the question
is, we all have to begin to get back
to the point where we distribute the
paper at the shop gates, return our
paper to the working class, bring it
to the people where we can. We must
also begin to make every effort to get
out on the Sunday or the Saturday for
the mobilization of the paper, to be-
gin to carry the message of socialism
in the paper. I think that is one thing
that I ﬁnd in particular lacking, that
we have talked about everything but

244

socialism, and I think that the paper
has got to reflect the sentiments of
the convention here, that we begin
to turn, not only the paper towards the
working class, but our agitation for
socialism toward the working class.

I would like to reiterate that we
should go on record for the adoption
of this, but everybody get to work
and help build the paper. There is no
reason inthe world why we can’t in-
crease the circulation of The Wor/(er,
in particular—the week—end paper—if
given an improved content, and we also
get out and work at it, that paper
should be able to reach a circulation
of 50,000 to 100,000 people reading it
regularly on the week-end, if we really
work at it. (Applause.)

C/1.: The question has been called.
We will now vote on the report.
[Vote taken.] The report is carried.

A Report of the Civil Liberties
Committee. I will call on Comrade
Si Gerson of New York.

Si Gerson: On behalf of the co-
chairman, Comrade Patterson and
myself, and the entire committee,
we want to state that, due to the
pressure of time, we will not read
the ‘entire resolution on the Smith
Act. We want to propose the fol-
lowing: that we refer all of the docu-
ments of the civil liberties commit-
tee, which worked hard and long
at this convention, to the incoming
National Committee for action.

I do want to take this "opportunity
to remind the comrades of some-
thing they may have seen in this

 

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

morning’s newspaper. Yesterday,
the U.S. Court of Appeals in this
circuit aﬂirmed the sentencing of
Comrades Gil Green and Henry
Winston to an additional three years
for contempt. That means that these
comrades have to serve eight years.
Besides those comrades, there are
nine other comrades in prison,
seventy—one are awaiting the outcome
of appeals--many of you are here
—-and twenty-four are awaiting trial.
I’m sure you understand the neces-
sity of speed and unity and for mo-
bilizing the Party to a ﬁrm united
front policy, and the possibility-
never greater than today.

Your civil liberties committee
recommends, in the enactment part
of its resolution, the following: that
the incoming National Committee
take all steps necessary to place this
work on a high priority basis, includ-
ing (1) strengthening and enlarging
the Party Commission on Civil Lib-
erties and Defense Work, (2) to con-
voke a two-day working conference
on a national basis within two
months, this conference to prepare a
plan of work on the defense of the
Party and the ﬁght for civil liberties.
This plan to include the ﬁght on
the Smith Act, for amnesty, and
against the McCarran Act and the
Walter—McCarran Law. Your com-
mittee moves the adoption.

C/z.: It has been regularly moved

and seconded that this report be- ’

adopted. Are we ready to vote?

[Vote taken.] This report is car-
ried.

The audit report. I recognize
Comrade Winter.

Carl Winter: The audit report
was to have been presented to this
convention several sessions ago. It
is proposed by the presiding com-
mitted that we refer this report to
the incoming National Committee
for its records, and whatever action
may be necessary. So moved.

Clz.: It has been moved and sec-
onded that the report of the Audit
Committee be referred to the Na-
tional Committee. [Vote taken.]
Carried and so ordered.

Comrade Carl Ross, for the Pre-
siding Committee, on the reply to the
fraternal greetings.

Carl Ross: One of the matters of
special pride to this convention, I
am sure, has been the many messages
of fraternal greeting received from
Communist parties abroad. We were
especially recommended by this con-
vention to prepare an answer to one
of these greetings, which I propose
to read, and then to make recom-
mendations for action:

To the Central Committee of the

Communist Party of France:
Dear Comrades:

Our national convention has received
many warm and fraternal messages from
the Communists of many lands. We wel-
come them as expressions of that impor-
tant principle once voiced by Abraham
Lincoln, “The strongest bond of human
sympathy outside the family relation,

should be one uniting all working people
of all nations and tongues and kindreds.”

We are pleased to respond to the greet-
ings we received from Comrade Jacques
Duclos, for the Central Committee of the
French Communist Party, one week be-
fore our convention, and from the Cen-
tral Committee on the eve of its open-
ing. We pay tribute to the great Party
of the resistance movement and the
staunch sons and daughters of the French
working class that your Party represents.
We place great value. upon your expres-
sions of sympathy and solidarity to our
own hard-pressed Party, especially as we
recall the spirit of friendship that has
animated our two peoples in the cause of
democracy since the establishment of our
Republics. This historic friendship can-
not be extinguished by the anti-demo
cratic and aggressive actions of the men
of Wall Street which run counter to the
will and traditions of our people.

We deeply regret, and strongly protest,
the arbitrary exclusion of the fraternal
representatives of your Party from our
country by our State Department. These
cold-war barriers have been injurious also
in preventing full exchanges of informa-
tion and opinion, making it more diﬁicult
that you in France or we in America
might be fully acquainted with condi-
tions in each other’s country.

In the greeting signed by Comrade
Jacques Duclos there is expressed mis-
givings and criticism with respect to the
course we are following. We do not ques-
tion his right to do so. Mutual criticism
is beneﬁcial and most useful when exer-
cised on the basis of fraternal and equal
relations between the respective Commu-
nist Parties.

We are in the closing sessions of the
National Convention of our Party. As an
independent working ‘class Party we are
motivated by the best interests of our
class and nation, whose true interests co-
incide with those of the common people
in all lands. In four days of free debate,
we have arrived at our decisions, and for
these we are accountable to our Party
membership, our class and the American
people, who will be the ﬁnal judge of the
correctness of our decisions in the light of
their experience.

The heart of the decisions of this con-
vention is the charting of a road ahead
for our Party and our judgment as to the

 

246 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

path to Socialism that the American peo-
ple must eventually take by their own
free choice.

We are deeply persuaded that our deci-
sions are based on sound principles of sci-
entiﬁc socialism, of Marxism-Leninism,
rather than being revisionist. We are of
the opinion that some of our past con-
tributions to America have been limited by
dogmatic and doctrinaire understanding
and application of these principles, as
well as the oft-times uncritical acceptance
of views of Marxists in other countries, and
often by a failure to appreciate thoroughly
enough the co-nditions and democratic tra-
ditions of our country. We believe that our
Resolutions express an important depart-
ure from the past in stating that: “The
Communist Party bases its theory generally
on the cultural heritage of mankind and
particularly on the principles of scientiﬁc
socialism as developed by Karl Marx, Fred-
erick Engels, and V. I. Lenin. These prin-
ciples the Communist Party of the U.S.A.
interprets, applies and strives to develop
further in accordance with the require-
ments of the American class struggle and
democratic traditions.”

Our Resolution also clariﬁes our con-
cept of relations among working class
parties. “These relations must be based
on the principles of scientiﬁc socialism,
on proletarian internationalism, they must
be based on each Communist Party serving
the best national interests of its people
and thereby the common interests of all
progressive humanity. This requires the
equality and independence of Marxist par-
ties in the mutual discussion and resolu-
tion of common problems; the right and
duty of the Communists of all countries
to engage in comradely criticism of the
policies and practices of the Commu-
nists of any country whenever they feel
this necessary. This will strengthen, not
weaken, international solidarity. It will
advance the cause of socialism in all
countries.”

It is in this spirit that we have given
careful consideration to the opinions ex-
pressed in your message, and extend to you
our own warm and comradely greetings.

16th NATIONAL CONVENTION
COMMUNIST PARTY, U.S.A.
February 9-12, 1957.

(Applause.)

[The text given above is the ﬁnal form
of the letter, as amended slightly by the
National Committee in accordance with the
following motion.l

I move that this message be re-
ferred for ﬁnal action to our Na-
tional Committee, and that the Na-
tional Committee be directed to take
appropriate action to reply to all of
the fraternal greetings we have re-
ceived, in the spirit of this conven-
t1OIl. V

C/2.: The motion is to refer. There
is no debate on a motion to refer.

[Some questions and procedural
discussion.]

Ross: It is the opinion of the writ-
ers of this letter that essentially it must
stand as is, in its content, because it
is based on direct excerpts and quota-
tions from the work and the resolu-
tions adopted by this convention.

Iames Iackson: Point of information:
I see that we are going to answer all
greetings that have been brought to
us. I think it is very important, and
I’d like to know why we did not at
this convention have an answer to the
Communist Party of Mexico, written
out for us to be answered here at this
convention. Also, shall all of these
telegrams and greetings that have been
sent to this convention be printed in
pamphlet form, or any other form that
will be distributed for circulation?

Ross: Unfortunately, your conven.
tion established a small committee for
this job. Its members were busily oc-
cupied, and could not complete the
work that was assigned to them. In

I-1 !\ U} (5 PL?!

 

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION 24»,-

my opinion, it is regrettable that we
do not have all the necessary messages
of reply, but at this stage, I think we
should express our feelings that this
convention desires such replies shall be
made.

As to the last question, I can only
say it would be appropriate to refer
to your committee established here the
question of. what action to take with
regard to these replies.

A Delegate: I would like to know
whether, in referring to the National
Committee, the N.C. will put this mes-
sage in line with the amendment which
has been adopted by this convention
to the Draft Resolution. This message
does not stand in line with this.

Ross: I would recommend that the
intent of the motion to refer be un-
derstood, that if the National Commit-
tee should ﬁnd this inconsistent in any
way with the decisions of this conven-
tion, it should so bring it in line. I
indicated that it was based on resolu-
tions adopted here; perhaps it can be
improved upon to more accurately ex-
press those decisions.

A Delegate: Point of information:
Is it correct that the resolutions on
the Iewish question are also being re-
ferred to the National Committee?

Ch.: I gather from the committee
that these documents are going to be
referred to the National Committee
for guidance and action, and that they
have the same status as the previous
letter.

Sid Stein: Comrades, we have two
different types of resolutions before us.
One, based upon documents of this
convention, that were discussed here

and adopted; and the National Com-
mittee, if it ﬁnds anything inconsistent
with these decisions of this conven-
tion, can and is instructed to, change
it accordingly. The document just pre-
sented was presented by agreement
with the Presiding Committee and
the Resolutions Committee for only
one purpose: to instruct the National
Committee. . A

Now, there were a number of reso-
lutions on the Iewish question. There
were a number of documents pre-
sented. The purpose here is ma-
terial for study. This material, and all
other material that is before the com-
mittee now, will be turned over to the
National Committee, and all comrades
are invited to send any further ma-
terial on the question to the commit-
tee. And the National Committee will
discuss it, and then will draft a docu-
ment. This question was not discussed
here, was not adopted here, and there-
fore, we did not bring it here with
any intent of being a guide to action
by the National Committee. And
these two documents, therefore, are
different and to make them the same
is merely to confuse the issue.

C}z.: The motion before the house is
to refer this to the full National Com-
mittee. [Vote taken.] It is carried and
so ordered.

A Delegate: Point of procedure: We
went on record to go to nine o’clock. I
submit it is after nine. I think that we
have to decide what we are going to do
at this point. I would like to move that
we extend our convention until 10:30.

Ch.: A motion has been made to extend
the convention time until 10:30. [Vote
taken.] Carried.

Another Delegate: Motion on procedure:
I would like to offer a motion that this

 

248

body go on record protesting the method
of getting these items through.

Ch.: That is not a motion on procedure.
That is" a motion of substance.

The chairman of the committee
will now conclude his report on
resolutions. '

Stein: Very brieﬂy, the Commit-
tee, which had over 100 resolutions
before it, with many of them pre-
pared to submit to the convention,
moves that all resolutions acted upon
by ‘the Committee, and others not
acted upon, and particularly empha-
sizing for the purpose of the knowl-
edge of the convention delegates
here that these resolutions include
one on .farm Work, work among
Women, on the youth question, work
in national groups, and the question
of culture; a quite important reso-
lution which our convention took
note of in its elections—the ap-
proach to the Mexican-American
question, which is much needed in
our Party; a resolution on Latin
America, Puerto Rico, and other im-
portant subjects, will be referred to
the incoming National Committee
for disposition. I so move.

C/1.: It has been regularly moved
and seconded that the remainder
of the general resolutions be referred
to the National Committee. [Vote
taken.] Carried and so ordered.

C/z.: Comrade Steve Nelson will
report for the Plan of Work Com-
mittee.*

;‘The Draft Plan of Work appears on page

PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

Steve Nelson: As we expected, this
matter would come before you when
you were very tired, and the mem-
bers of your committee are tired
also. We decided to cut down the
report to the bone, and to indicate
the central point that our committee
considers we ought to tackle when
we go out of this convention. There
were quite a few meetings of this
committee, and there were quite ‘a
number of recommendations and
resolutions brought from various
delegations. We can’t even list them
here——we’re not going to, comrades.

There were two central questions
that were agreed to that we should
emphasize in closing this convention.
It was felt, comrades, that, in the
spirit of what most comrades had to
say on the matter confronting the
Negro people in this country, that
that be the point we should empha-
size here, the point on which we
should concentrate our work when
we go back from here, and that is,
the whole struggle for Negro rights
to be a long-range proposition before
us, as we return to our districts. We
considered that it would be impos-
sible, and presumptuous on our part,
to attempt to work out a plan, the
kind we used to work out in the
past, where we would say, “Do this,”
and “Do that,” and “Do the other,”
because there is already a tremen-
dous movement here that doesn't
require us to initiate it. Further-
more, in many of our communities,

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

there are all kinds of activities go-
ing on in which our comrades are
active in this movement.

The point that we wanted to
stress is that the Communist partici-
pation in this work on all levels can
deepen this struggle, and can bring
greater meaning to it. I think we
are all heartened by the fact that a
new thing has developed in our
country with reference to the ques-
tion of Negro rights. I don’t think
that we have ever had a situation
where so many people of diverse
opinions are interested in the Negro
question in one way or another. We
are urging, therefore, that we don’t
try to invent campaigns, we don’t
need to. What we do is to go back
into our districts and putit on the
agenda, and see what is going on in
the community, and see in what way
we can deepen that struggle in the
various communities.

If time allowed, we could illus-
trate to you, as illustrations were
given, of how this struggle is moving
in different ways in different places.
Now the problem is how to play a
role in the struggle, and give it some
orientation. And that can be done.

In the various organizations, peo-
ple agreed to carry on the struggle
on the level of the particular or-
ganization’s principles and under-
standing. But if we go into, and
give some substance to the struggle,
it can be raised to a higher level.

b For example, we note that the trade

349

union movement has endorsed the
struggle for Negro rights gener-
ally, unions up in the_ North, and
down South, and all over. And yet,
comrades, when the struggle was go-_
ing on in the South, there were not
enough concrete actions in the North
by white workers, in white unions
and other organizations, but which
they were ready for. I can tell you,
comrades, in one place in Home-
stead, in the Steel Workers Union,
workers have been stirred to such a
point where they have undertaken
all kinds of actions on behalf of the
South, and they have also gone fur-
ther, so that there is a greater
activity on the part of the steel work-
ers in this particular union.

What we are trying to say is-
examine this question, everywhere
in your community, make this the
major campaign in the spirit of the
NAACP, in the long-range way——
“Free by ’63”—not a campaign that
starts today to ﬁnish tomorrow, but
a long-range one. So that’s one of
the recommendations we made:
concentrate on this issue.

The other issue is the peace strug-
gle, and that’s the only point we want
to recommend. This issue of strug-
gle for peace. It’s agreed here that
the struggle for peace ﬁnds its ex-
pression in various ways in various
communities. We know now that
there have been already some senti-
ments on the part of workers in
many industries where they are com-

 

250 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH

plaining about the high taxes. They
are beginning to see that the big
atomic program and the war pro-
gram and the “cold war” digs at their
pockets. And there is a big resent-
ment growing against this heavy
taxation. It is felt that one of the
things that should be emphasized
wherever possible in this phase of
the struggle against war and for out-
lawing the atomic bomb and the
H—bomb, that it be tied in with eco-
nomic problems of the people, espe-
cially with the question of taxes, and
then you will see that this struggle,
too, will be raised to a higher level.
Comrades, those are the two main
suggestions that we have to make at
this time as to campaigns. We are
not making any other recommenda-
tions because you are tired and we
are tired. We had no intention of
working out a plan in detail. How-
ever, we have a recommendation for
the incoming National Committee,
that they should work out a rough
plan of work in the near future, send
the draft out to the districts, that
it be discussed in the districts, and
that, if possible, a conference be
called in the center of comrades
active in this phase of work, and in
that way, discuss the details of the
program which could more con-
cretely be brought before the Party
than we can possibly do at this con-
vention.
I thank you for your attention.
(Applause)

CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

C/1.: It has been regularly moved
and seconded that this report be
adopted. On the question.

A Delegate: I don’t want to be repe-
titious, neither do I want to burden
this convention with a question that
I have already raised here. I endorse
this plan of action proposed by Com-
rade Steve Nelson on two points, par-
ticularly—and I think it is a splendid
plan of action—on the Negro people’s
movement and on the problem of peace.
But I cannot understand why we can-
not do what I tried to propose before,
and I cannot understand why we can-
not develop a plan of action of a simi-
lar scope with regard to the Iewish
question. I didn’t see, in the original
resolution, their proposal about dis-
cussing this question, but I don’t think
that is adequate, and I am therefore
proposing that we add to this plan of
action a third point, that the National
Committee be instructed to develop a
plan of action, also to study it care-
fully. I don’t suppose that the two
things are parallel—they have some
similarities but that we develop a
plan of action with respect to develop-
ing a campaign around the whole ques-
tion of the Iewish people in our coun-
try.
Mimi (New York): I don’t want to
go into the details of the report, be-
cause, as Comrade Steve knows, the
report is one that has been building up
in the Party for many years, and one
that the Party will continue to build.
It is particularly on the plan of action,
comrades, that I want to pay special
tribute to the unsung heroes of this con-
vention. We named them so in our
board. These are the comrades, hun-

SESSIONS OF THE CONVENTION

dreds of whom in our area and all
over the country, I am sure, are now
continuing their day to day work for
the questions before the house here-
on the question of peace, on the ques-
tion of integration, on the question of
trade union work, PTA, political ac-
tion—every form, you name it, they’re
in it—-comrades that have been part
of our deliberations and are part of
the work that is going on today. I
think they have helped make this con-
vention, and they have sent a mandate
to us in this convention to come out
with a sense of unity, come out with a
sense of conﬁdence that we can solve
the problems, and that we can work
together in developing our principles
and our plan of action.

I would like to make one comment
that I think is necessaryfor us to learn
out of this convention. I say us ad-
visedly, because I am standing on this
side of the house, and this is my own
personal thinking and opinion. And
that is, out of all the discussions that
have gone on through the year, there
have been many things learned. There
have been sharp discussions; there have
been emotional discussions; there have
been personal discussions; there have
been objective discussions. I think that
out of New York, we have had some
wonderful discussions. I think also
that you have felt a note of bitterness
creep into the discussions, and a note
of distrust. I think we have not had
an opportunity to hear enough from
the out—of-town delegations on some
of the ways we have conducted our-
selves on this platform. I feel that
we in this convention—I for one——have

251

learned a great deal more about how
discussions have been conducted in
many of the other districts and in the
delegations there, and that we will
learn a lesson on how to bring this
back into our State convention, and
conduct our discussions with a greater
degree of clarity, understanding and
respect for each other, and bring New
York into a strong, healthy Party,
which will carry out this plan of work.
(Applause.)

A Delegate: My amendment is that
in order to expedite this matter, the
coming district conventions be in-
structed to take up this question and
forward immediately their recommen-
dations to the incoming National Com-
mittee to supplement and help in
guidance for a plan of Work. .

C/1.: Is that accepted by the commit
tee? V

Alex: I would like to propose, on the
question of plan of work, conferences
to be called not later than within three
months to discuss the trade union prob-
lems that have been touched on in the
trade union resolution at this conven-
tion. The trade union resolution did
not get the necessary time for discus-
sion, and I think it is necessary that
immediately after the convention con-
ferences of a regional or national na-
ture be held, so that we have a proper
understanding as to how we will apply
the resolution adopted in the various
industries on a local and national scale.

A Delegate: Comrade Chairman, I
would like to make a motion that the
report given by Comrade Steve on the
plan of work be referred to the Na-
tional Committee for working out a

252

more detailed statement to be issuedand who have no direct voice or

for the membership of our Party——a
plan of work around which we can
rally our Party membership.

C/1.: It has been regularly moved
and seconded that this report be re-
ferred for the purposes indicated. [Vote
taken.] The report as amended has
been referred to the National Com-
mittee.

I recognize Comrade Fred Fine
for the Presiding Committee for a
special motion. ‘

Fred Fine: I think all the dele-
gates will agree that a number of
comrades who have been with us
throughout the session, and some of
them were in these halls many hours
before we started, and will be la-
boring many hours after we leave,

vote, deserve a vote of thanks from
the delegates for their devotion be-
yond the call of duty in the techni-
cal and administrative Work of this
convention. (Applause.)

I move that we give them a vote of
thanks.

C/2.: All in favor will signify by
saying “Aye.” Opposed, if any? Car-
ried and so ordered. v

We will now sing “The Star-
Spangled Banner” as our adjourn-
ment of this convention.

munist Party of the United States

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION
Adopted by the 16th National Convention, C.P.U.S.A.
February 9-12, 1957

I. THE SITUATION TODAY

For a Prosperous America; For an End to Poverty;
For a New Program of Social Advance

The years since 1939 have witnessed a huge expansion in the
American economy. During this time, our productive capacity has
more than doubled, and today the United States towers over the capi-
talist world, surpassing in productive power and wealth all other
capitalist countries put together.

This enormous power, monopolized by a handful of giant corpor—-
ations, rests on a tribute drawn from the whole capitalist world through
a vast expansion in foreign investment. It rests on two wars and
extensive militarization of the American economy. It is the power of
American imperialism, more grasping and parasitic than ever before.

These same years have witnessed also a prolonged period of rela-—
tive prosperity—a period of nearly two decades without a major
economic crisis. A .

The wartime boom, in a country untouched by the destructive
effects of war, has continued into the postwar years. Since 1947, despite:
temporary declines, industrial production has risen by 42%. Cor-~
porate proﬁts before taxes have nearly doubled. Real wages in organ-
ized industry, particularly during the last few years, have risen
substantially. And by mid—I956, employment reached a record level of"
661/2 million.

As in the ’twenties, the current boom has once again given rise-
to illusions of permanent prosperity. Crises, say the spokesmen of‘
big business and the Eisenhower Administration, are a thing of the
past. The government, through its capacity to intervene and to “man-

age” the economy, can prevent any major disaster and can limit
economic ﬂuctuations to mere “adjustments.” Moreover, they assert,
we have developed a “people’s capitalism,” in which the share of
income and wealth going to the working people is steadily rising,
while that going to big business is falling.

But such Wall Street-inspired illusions are entirely unfounded.
In reality, the very factors sparking the boom serve also to increase the
underlying instability of the economy and the imbalance between
productive capacity and the market. Outstanding among these fac-

tOl‘S are:

1. A high rate of investment in ﬁxed capital throughout the
postwar period. This has been motivated principally by the need to
restore world—wide damage and domestic shortages arising from the
war, as well as to replace obsolete and wornout equipment, by techno-
logical advances, and by the expansion of basic industrial capacity to

 

ﬁt the enlarged world role and military program of American

monopoly capital. Coupled with this has been an expansion of
the consumer durable goods market and an extended boom in hous-
ing construction.

But today the rate of increase in industrial capacity far exceeds
the rate of growth in purchasing power. This disparity ultimately
leads to a point when continued expansion in the face of inadequate
markets is no longer proﬁtable and capital investment declines.

2. A vast growth in government spending. For the current ﬁscal
year, cash outlays of government at all levels will total nearly $100
billion, of which federal government expenditures account for some
$69 billion. V
I Of the federal outlays, about two—thirds goes for “national se-
curity.” In large part, therefore, the present high level of the economy
is based on the unreliable prop of arms spending, which during the
Korean war hit a peak rate of $55 billion a year, and is today running
at an annual rate of about $41 billion. And for the coming ﬁscal year,
President Eisenhower has proposed a record peace-time federal budget
of $72 billion, $45 billion of it for military purposes.

Among the consequences of such spending are the postwar inﬂa-
tion which has brought prices of consumer goods and the cost of liv—
ing toitheir highest level in history; a federal debt of $276 billion, only
slightly below the World War II peak, with its billions of dollars in

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 255

interest charges; and a tax burden which consumes one-third of the
earnings of the average worker.

3. An unparalleled inflation of private credit. Corporate debt has
grown 21/2 times since 1945. Personal indebtedness——home mortgages
and consumer debt—has risen to $137 billion, of which more than
$100 billion was accumulated during the last ten years. Consumer
credit alone has grown to nearly $41 billion and amounts to 15% of
all consumer disposable income—an all-time high.

The most recent economic upsurge, since 1954, has been stimulated
chieﬂy by such credit inﬂation, together with a large volume of tax
rebates and give—aways to big business. Hence, our economy today has
taken on much of the aspect of a typical speculative peace-time boom,
reminiscent in many ways of the boom of the twenties. The mounting
volume of credit, with its attending threat of further inﬂation, con-
tributes greatly to the underlying instability of the economy.

4. Postwar expansion of foreign investment. Today, American
investment abroad, in all forms, totals $45 billion, or four times the
pre—war level, and the proﬁts extracted (both admitted and con-
cealed) are estimated at nearly $10 billion a year. In the main branches
of American industry, proﬁts from foreign investment range from
10% of total proﬁts to as high as 50% in the case of the oil trusts.
These volumes of investment and proﬁt exceed those of all other
imperialist countries combined. (And this is in addition to the bil-
lions in extra proﬁts obtained through the super-exploitation of the
Negro people in this country.)

But these foreign investments rest on a very shaky foundation.
The growing breakdown of the colonial system and the spreading
movement for national liberation threaten the continued extraction of
these super-proﬁts and the whole parasitic structure built on imperial-
ist exploitation.

Clearly the foregoing features render the future of the economy
far less secure than depicted by those who speak for big business.

Moreover, today’s boom has by no means brought prosperity for
all. A

It has not been shared by the great majority of America's farm-
ers. From 1947 to mid-1956, farm incomes fell by one third. In 1955,
the Department of Agriculture reports, net farm income was lower
than in any year since 1940. Small and family-sized farms have de-

 

256 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

clined in number while corporation farms and the holdings of the big-
gest operators have increased. Added to this is the growing impact of
such natural disasters as Hood and dr0ught—disasters contributed to
by deforestation and other destruction of natural resources by big
business interests. I

The persistent agricultural depression places a heavy economic
burden on the shoulders of the small marginal and family sized farm
operators, and the outbreak of a general crisis would have a catastroph-
ic effect on the small farmers. For never before was the agricultural
economy so closely bound up with the country’s industrial and ﬁnan-
cial life, and never was it under such sharp pressure from monopoly.

One—ﬁfth of a nation suffers poverty in the midst of plenty; one
family in ﬁve earns less than $2,000 a year-—that is, less than $40 a
Week. Among Negro families, the proportion is more than two in
ﬁve. Ten million American children live in slums. In the midst of
the boom, the country is dotted with distressed areas and “sick” indus-
tries plagued by high unemployment.

Despite the record national employment, the rise in production
since 1954 has brought no corresponding rise in factory jobs. The auto
workers, during the past year, suffered an alarming growth in unem-
ployment, with 100,000 of those laid off still not absorbed at the cur-
rent peak of production. And with the further extension of automa-
tion and increased productivity, unemployment threatens to spread
further.

Nor has small business ﬂourished in recent years. The rise in
proﬁts has been concentrated in the biggest corporations, and bank-
ruptcies of small business ventures have reached their highest rate
since 1939.

The chief beneﬁciaries of the boom have been the giant trusts
and monopolies. The year 1955, says Fortune, was “very deﬁnitely the
best year ever for big business.”

The monopolies have continued to grow and to become ever
more powerful. Today, the 500 largest industrial corporations account
for about half of all production and employment. These giants rake
in the lion's share of the proﬁts. In the ﬁrst quarter of 1956, proﬁts
per dollar of sales for the biggest companies (those with assets of
$100,000,000 or more) were nearly ﬁve times those of the smaller
companies (with assets under $250,000). And under the Cadillac

 

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 257

Cabinet, with its give-aways and its policies favoring big business,
mergers are taking place at a higher rate than ever before.

The enormous proﬁts of the trusts are obtained at the expense
of the workers, the small farmers and small business. Though real
wages are rising, they have not kept pace with the rise in productivity
or the still greater growth of corporate proﬁts, and the worker’s share
in his product thus continues to decline. ,

Hence, despite the prolonged prosperity and despite the signiﬁcant
efforts of the new features which have emerged in the American
economy, the basic contradictions inherent in capitalist production are
not abating but are becoming sharper. The fundamental factors mak-
ing for economic crisis continue to operate today, no less than in the
boom of the ’twenties—in particular, the basic factor which Marx
described as “the tendency of capitalist production to develop the
productive forces as if only the absolute power of consumption of the
entire society would be their limit,” while the actual purchasing power
of the masses remains relatively restricted and lags increasingly be-
hind. 9

The boom, with its growing credit inﬂation, only conceals the
sharpening contradiction between the forces of production and the
capitalist relations under which they are operated—a contradiction
which can be ﬁnally resolved in the people’s interests only through
the establishment of a socialist society. The Marxist theory of crisis
is not invalidated by the prolonged period of prosperity.

In assessing the postwar economic developments, the Party was
correct in giving ‘special weight to the effects of extensive growth in
military expenditures. However, in 1945, 1949 and 1954, we incor-
rectly predicted that the then current declines wo11ld develop into
crises of major proportions.

At times, the Party gave a one—sided appraisal of the effects of the
arms program. It overlooked the extent of continuing investments
in ﬁxed capital to replace, expand or modernize equipment which
had worn out or become obsolete since the last major cycle of ﬁxed
capital renewal in the ’thirties. Together with this, it failed to size up
adequately the level of commercial and residential construction, the
scope of unsatisﬁed consumer demand, the possibilities of credit ex-
pansion, and the government’s tax program of rebates, rapid write—oﬁ‘s
and lowered excess proﬁts taxes.

258 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

At the root of these mistakes has been our acceptance of the er-
roneous thesis, widely prevalent among Marxists in all countries, that
in the postwar stage of the general crisis of capitalism no signiﬁcant
peace-time expansion of capitalist production would be possible. This
contributed to a one—sided and incomplete study of economic data.
At the same time, our inadequate attention to the new and speciﬁc
features of the American economy led to the application of the
Marxian theory of crisis in a routine, formal and doctrinaire manner.

Our repeated estimates of impending economic crisis had many
harmful effects: projection ‘of unrealistic economic programs; over-
estimation of the tempo of radicalization of the masses, with re-
sultant mistakes in tactical approaches to united front relations,
especially in the trade unions; and ﬁnally, encouragement of all ten-
dencies to overestimate the imminence of war and fascism.

The correction of our wrong approaches in this ﬁeld is a vital
prerequisite for obtaining a proper understanding o-f the present—day
American economy and for the development of a correct economic
program. The National Committee proposes, toward this end, that a
special commission be established to launch a thorough-going study
of the main theoretical questions confronting us, and on this basis to
make a fresh analysis of the total economic picture. All Party mem-
bers are urged to participate to the fullest extent in the study and dis-
cussion of these problems.

For, American capitalism has undergone great changes since the
pre-war years. Many important developments have become intensiﬁed
to such a degree that they have taken on certain new features—fea-
tures which have a pronounced effect on the course of the economic
cycle and all related economic factors.

Central among these is the tremendous growth of monopoly, as
a result of which the impact of monopoly control on the determina-
tion of prices and production, and on the position of small business,
has greatly increased.

Hand in hand with this has gone a tremendous increase in the
intervention of the government in the economy. This intervention,
whose primary aim is the protection of monopoly proﬁts, today pene-
trates every aspect of our economic life. Huge government expendi-
tures, chieﬂy for military purposes, government subsidies, guaranteed
markets, stock-piling, tax Write-offs and give—aways——all these have in

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION _259

turn had far—reaching effects on the role of taxation, government debt
and monetary policies. Government economic intervention has been
a contributing factor also in the unequaled rise in the volume of
private debt and particularly in the enhanced role of consumer credit
in the economy.

Another important feature is the new wave of technological
advances, particularly the development of automation, which has not
only greatly increased productivity, but has also begun to affect pro-
foundly the composition of the labor force, the role of skilled labor,
and the growing shift in employment from manufacturing to service
occupations. And these effects will be vastly increased once the tre-
mendous potential of the peace—time harnessing of atomic energy
begins to make itself felt. ,

An especially signiﬁcant new development is the impact of a
greatly expanded socialist world on our economy. Particularly im-
portant is the peaceful competitive bid of the socialist countries for
world markets, and their growing ability to offer underdeveloped
countries a source of capital goods independent of the imperialist na-
tions. Also of great signiﬁcance is the potential role of uninhibited
trade between the capitalist and socialist worlds.

There are also certain special characteristics of the American
economy—for example, the exceptionally prominent part played by
the production and sale of consumer durable goods, notably the auto-
mobile——-which require examination.

Finally, there are certain long—unresolved theoretical questions,
such as the operation in this country of Marx’s law of the impoverish—
ment of the working class, or the operation of the law of value under
monopoly conditions, which demand answers with growing in-
sistence.

The failure adequately to study these new and special features
is a major cause of economic errors which we have committed in
recent years.

A most important factor on today's economic scene is the ex-
istence of a greatly strengthened, more uniﬁed labor movement,
whose power has been enhanced especially by the AFL—CIO merger.
Labor has won signiﬁcant economic gains during the postwar years,
among them a virtually uninterrupted series of annual wage increases.

But today labor faces new and more acute problems. Though

  

 

 

    

260 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

production has risen during the past few years, factory employment
has fallen off. Among industrial workers, there is a growing sense of
job insecurity and mounting pressure for the thirty—hour week with-
out reduction in take-home pay. There are intensiﬁed problems of
speed-up and worsened working conditions. In many industries the
runaway shop evil is reaching more and more serious proportions.

Organized labor has developed an extensive economic program to
combat poverty and depression. Included in it are demands for higher
wages, an end to discrimination in employment and pay, a shorter
work_ week without reduction in pay, a reduced burden of taxes on
low—ir1come groups, increases in the minimum wage, in unemploy-
ment compensation and in social security beneﬁts generally, large-
scale public works, and aid to small business and farmers. In addition,
labor has sharply demanded government investigation of monopoly
prices and proﬁts.

We Communists endorse and support the forward—looking pro-
posals of the labor movement and other democratic organizations for
economic betterment and social welfare. It is through the develop-
ent of a united movement behind such a program that the American
people can advance their economic welfare against the encroachment
of the trusts.

We urge, on our part, a peace—time economic program which in-
cludes:

I. All necessary measures for the defense of the economic condi-
tions of the working people against the destructive effects of eco-
nomic crisis;

2_. Reduction of arms spending, together with other measures
to combat inﬂation;

3. A program on a grand scale for development of public water
power, ﬂood control and conservation projects, as well as the building
of highways, schools, housing and other vital public works;

4. A positive world economic role, with the provision of real
economic aid—not arms—to underdeveloped countries, and with the
restoration and expansion of East—West trade;

5. Large—scale economic development of underdeveloped areas in
our own oountry—notably the South;

6. Defense and extension of national property—forests, oil and
other natural resources, as well as atomic energy installations—against
the inroads of monopoly.

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 261

The age of automation and the atom, with its great promise,
stands in glaring contradiction to widespread poverty, to inadequate
educational and health facilities, and to growing insecurity and‘ fear
of the future. But to fulﬁll the promise of plenty which automation
and atomic energy hold forth will require concerted struggle by labor
and its allies against the big monopolies. In the course of such strug-
gles, if Communists and other socialist-minded Americans work ef-
fectively, the working people of this country can achieve a fuller
understanding of the need for a socialist economy as the only basic
answer to their problems.

For Peaceful Coexistence and an End to the Cold War

Having lived for a decade under threat of atomic war, the
American people, like peoples everywhere, deeply desire to enjoy in
peace the great beneﬁts which they rightfully demand of the coming
atomic age. -

Soon after World War II, the giant corporations which dominate
American political and economic life set about trying to extend their
domination to the rest of the world. They caused our government to
scrap FDR’s policy of American-Soviet friendship and Big Three
unity for peace. They also brought about the scuttling of F DR’s “good
neighbor” policy in Latin America, which, despite serious limitations,
had curbed aggressive intervention and developed better relations
with the peoples of that area. Acting through the Truman and Eisen-
hower Administrations, the economic royalists replaced these policies
with one of atom-bomb diplomacy, military alliances, war bases, and
active intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. Under
the pretext of “defense” against a mythical “Soviet menace” they
built up a very proﬁtable arms economy at home.

This policy had its domestic counterpart in the smog of intimida-
tion and conformity that polluted American life, in the persecutions,
repressions and witchhunts that steadily eroded the Bill of Rights.
The pall of McCarthyism grew until it threatened to blot out Ameri-
can liberties.

Over the years Wall Street's war—like, anti-American policy suf-
fered one setback after another. Our country became isolated, its good
name dishonored. Aggressive acts and threats of “massive retaliation”
precipitated differences with our “allies.” The newly independent na-
tions of Asia refused to toe the State Department and Pentagon line.

    

 

 

 

262 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

A great people’s peace movement embracing hundreds of millions
all over the world, insisted on an end to the cold war and the settle-
ment of differences through negotiations. The Soviet Union refused
to behave in accordance with the myth of “Soviet aggression,” and
instead the socialist countries directed all their efforts toward prevent-
ing war and achieving peaceful coexistence.

The growing crisis in American foreign policy ﬁnally reached the
point where in July 1955, the Eisenhower Administration was com-
pelled to drop its opposition to great power negotiations, meet with
the Soviet Union at Geneva, and formally renounce the use of force
to resolve differences. '

The changed world situation, symbolized by Geneva, came about
because the American people, no less ﬁrmly than other peoples, re-
fused to accept the prospect of atomic annihilation. In 1952 they elected
Eisenhower on the strength of his pledge to stop the war in Korea;
in 1954 they vetoed Nixon’s plan to use American troops in Indochina;
in 1955 they quashed the Dulles-Radford provocations around Que-
moy and Matsu.

And Geneva was also made possible because the American people
refused to bow to McCarthyism, but instead, through their struggles
in 1953 and 1954, administered serious defeats to the McCarthyites and
began the still incomplete process of restoring the Bill of Rights.

Now there has come into being a vast “zone of peace,” embracing
socialist and non—socialist peace—seeking states populated by well over
half the human race. And this “zone of peace” may also be said to
include the peoples of all other countries irrespective of the policies
of their governments.

This situation has opened up the prospect of bringing the cold
war to an end and ushering in a new era of peaceful coexistence and
competition of different social systems.

The realization of such a perspective necessarily involves intense
and protracted struggles on the part of all peace forces. For we live
in the epoch of imperialism and imperialism breeds the danger of
world war. The imperialists will never voluntarily accept peaceful
coexistence. It must be imposed upon them by the organized
pressure of the peace forces. These forces are growing stronger, where-
as the imperialists are being weakened.

 

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION — 263

While the heightened tensions caused by the imperialist aggres-
sion against Egypt and by the events in Hungary are beginning to
abate, these developments sharply emphasize three fundamental con-
siderations:

I. A successful struggle for peaceful coexistence requires that we
be on guard against certain illusions and distortions that tend to
grow up around this perspective. These include the false conceptions
that peaceful coexistence is already assured or that it will come about
automatically; or that temporary setbacks and periods of heightened
tension are henceforth excluded. Above all, this perspective does not
in any way imply a freezing of the status quo in regard to social and
national liberation. On the contrary, it facilitates the struggle of the
peoples to realize their aspirations for social change and national
independence. ‘

2. Far from invalidating the perspective of peaceful coexistence,
these developments demonstrate anew the real relationship of forces
upon which this perspective rests. For, while the imperialists were
able to launch the aggression against Egypt, the strength of the peace
forces——the Soviet Union, China, the people’s democracies, the Ban-
dung nations, as Well as the peace sentiments of the people of the
United States and other major capitalist countries—Was able to stop
it quickly. And while the imperialists intervened in the Hungarian
tragedy, they did not dare to make it the occasion for open large—scale
military intervention.

3. At the same time, while the outcome of these events conﬁrm
the perspective, they are a grim reminder that the imperialists have not
reconciled themselves to the relationship of forces which makes this
perspective possible. While they dare not under present circumstances
launch any general war, they seek constantly to change this relation-
ship of world forces. This they do by various means and especially
by attempting to split the socialist world or undermine the countries
of socialism.

Thus the events in Egypt and Hungary confirm the perspective set
forth in the Draft Resolution. At the same time they lead to a deeper
and more complete understanding of the conditions under which the
struggle must be waged if this perspective is to be realized.

The basic factors that brought Eisenhower to the Summit meeting
are today stronger than ever. They make possible a successful strug-

 

 

 

264 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

gle to ‘ defeat the present effort of American imperialism to exploit
certain temporary difficulties in the socialist world in order to heat up
the cold war.

Scrapping his election—eve pledge of no military involvement in
Egypt, Eisenhower has opened a campaign to win popular backing
for Wall Street’s policy of taking over the Middle East from the weak-
ened British and French imperialists. This is the essence of the Eisen-
hower-Dulles doctrine.

The American people are increasingly expressing their opposition
to this new colonialist venture as a threat to peace.

The foreign policy debate continues amidst much confusion, shift-
ing and partisan maneuvering. Among the trends reﬂected are in broad
outline the following:

A. Certain of the most reactionary ﬁnancial and political circles
openly oppose Geneva and ﬂatly reject peaceful negotiations, trade,
and coexistence, especially with China. They want to heat up the cold
war and compel the “allies,” the neutrals and the UN to toe the line.
Their ultimate aim is a fascist Fortress America, equipped with over-
whelming superiority in air-atomic arms. In its crudest form this is the
View of the McCarthy-Jenner-Eastland forces and in a more refined
form, of Knowland and of Nixon. It inﬂuences some of the Dulles
bluff-and-bluster policies. Its virulent anti-Sovietism ﬁnds an echo in
the utterances of a number of leading Democrats.

B. The predominant Wall Street forces, Whose policies are re-
ﬂected in the Eisenhower wing of the GOP and most of the Democratic
leadership, favor a continuation of the main features of the cold war—
especially the arms budgets, NATO and the like. At present, they are
attempting to exploit the events in Hungary to intensify the cold
war. With varying emphasis they call for greater ﬂexibility in relations
with the “allies” and neutrals. Along with the Eisenhower Doctrine,
they are putting more stress on the economic and ideological aspects
of the international struggle. This does not exclude negotiating some
partial steps to disarmament.

C. Some spokesmen for Big Business (Lippmann, Eaton, Flanders,
Bowles) appear to go farther. They put their main stress on the shift
to economic competition and Point 4, while advocating the retention
of the arms budget. They favor increased trade and exchange, and
continued efforts to achieve some progress towards disarmament.

 

 

 

MAIN‘ POLITICAL RESOLUTION 265

Our general outlook towards the struggle for peace can be summed
up as follows: .

War is not inevitable, though the danger still exists. Imperialism
generates this danger, as shown again in the aggression against Egypt.
For the big trusts and corporations have not given up their aim of
world domination. The danger of another world war, however, has
considerably subsided. This remains the main feature of the post-
Geneva situation.

This feature can be a powerful stimulant to the people’s struggle
for peaceful coexistence and an end to the cold war. This struggle will
be accelerated, and the myth of the “Soviet menace” further dissipated,
as our people come to understand the profound changes and correc-
tions of serious errors now taking place in the socialist countries. It
will be helped by the continuing Soviet peace initiatives as well as by
the progress being made in correcting past weaknesses and improving
relations with other countries. This is bound to exert a favorable inﬂu-
ence on the attitude toward peaceful negotiations and coexistence in
labor and liberal ranks.

The immediate outlook in our country is for the further growth
of broad popular movements on speciﬁc peace issues. Inﬂuential groups
in labor, women’s, church, Negro, farm, youth and other organizations
are calling for concrete steps towards universal disarmament, especially
for banning A- and H-bomb tests and withdrawing all foreign troops
from all countries. There is growing opposition to the Eisenhower
Doctrine. These groups and other United Nations supporters are ask-
ing that that body be strengthened by the seating of People’s China.

The unprecedented rise of the Negro people’s movement is closely
linked with rising sympathy and support for the liberation struggles
of the colonial peoples in Africa and elsewhere.

In the labor movement there has been growing dilferentation on
foreign policy and peace within the past few years. On the one hand
certain national leaders have adopted an aggressive and rigid anti—co-
existence, anti—Geneva position. On the other hand, the sentiment of
the majority of the rank and ﬁle has found expression in varying de-
gree in the position of other leaders of important international unions,
and in a number of trade union publications. These leaders and pub-
lications criticize the more aggressive aspects of Washington’s foreign
policy and urge negotiations, curbing the A- and H-bombs, support

 

266 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

of anti—colonial struggles, expanded foreign economic aid and various
forms of peaceful competition with the lands of socialism.

There is growing concern in the labor movement on the question
of economic aid to underdeveloped countries. In contrast to Meany’s
anti-coexistence position, Reuther’s Io—point program for aid envisages
joint action through the UN by the USA and USSR. Such proposals,
along with a program for expansion of East-West trade and exchange
of delegations, can win broad support in labor and liberal political
circles.

Such movements as these will bring to bear the inﬂuence of labor
and the other main sectors of the American people upon the foreign
and domestic policies of the new Administration and Congress. They
will help realize the new perspectives of peaceful coexistence.

II. THE PATH AHEAD

The principal obstacle to all advance of the American people to-
day, as in the past, is their traditional enemy: The Monopolies.
Blocking the path to the new great advances possible today stands
Big Business. The giant trusts through their control of the overwhelm-
ing majority of American production dominate the economic and
political life of our country.

While Big Business has been increasing its domination of the
economic system in the postwar years, it is by no means inevitable
that it should continue having its way in the political life and direc-
tion of the country. The workers, farmers, Negro people, small busi-
nessmen and professionals, who suffer directly from the exploitation
and depredations of Big Business compose the overwhelming majority
of the American people. They have the potential political strength, if
united in a great coalition, to curb the power of Big Business far
more even than in the heyday of the New Deal.

The formation of an anti-monopoly coalition, led by labor, and the
election of an anti-monopoly coalition government which would ef-
fectively curb the power of Big Business is our main strategic aim in
the period ahead. The accomplishment of this aim will signify a new
stage in the relation of class forces. It will open the path to realization

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 267

of the American ideal of government of the people, by the people, for
the people.

Labor, the farmers, the Negro people, and small business are
already in actual struggle against the monopolies. Increasingly——
though still inadequately——they have been seeking and giving one an-
other mutual support. The idea long cultivated by monopoly propa-
ganda that the interests of these natural allies are contradictory has
been proved false.

Political cooperation based upon mutual economic interests and
interdependence between labor and the farmers has registered big
gains in the past period. In a number of states, such as North Dakota,
Iowa, Oregon, South Dakota and Montana, labor—farmer cooperation
has been maturing rapidly. The main joint effort has been to defeat
the “right—to—work” laws menacing labor and to support the farmers’
demands for full parity. In such industries as farm equipment and
meat packing, labor and farmers have made common cause against the
squeeze of the trusts.

The labor—Negro alliance, despite certain strains, remains a foun—
dation stone of the people’s strength. A million and a half Negro
workers belong to the trade unions, and the Negro people refuse to be
moved from their support of trade unionism. On the other hand,
labor gives a growing measure of support to the struggles of the
Negro people, and tens of thousands of trade unionists are members
of the NAACP.

So far, however, the struggles of these great popular forces are
not united. They remain only at the stage of limited mutual support.
Yet labor, the farmers and the Negro people, together with the small
business people and professionals, constitute the actual majority of
the American people. The central task facing the American people in
their struggle against the giant force of monopoly is to bring about
great unity of action in the struggle for their common objectives.

In the course of the struggle for these objectives the forces of the
people could develop their common action and move towards the
formation of an anti—monopoly coalition strong enough to curb the
power of the monopolies by effectively resisting their offensive and
enacting measures:

a) To establish the sovereignty of the Nation over its most vital
facilities;

b) To limit the economic concentration and power of the trusts;

c) To reduce their incredibly swollen share of the national
wealth. ,

Common action could realize such demands already current in
the labor and people’s movements as:

a) Return the scandalous “give-aways” (Tidelands oil, etc.) to
the government;

b) Plug up the notorious loopholes in the income and corporate
tax structure through which the monopolies and their magnates evade
the major portion of their taxes; raise the capital gains tax and the
income tax in the higher brackets;

c) Enforce the anti—trust laws so that instead of being merely a
nuisance to the trusts and a bonanza for the legal ﬁrms, they function
as actual deterrents to monopoly proﬁteering and concentration;

A d) Expose and prohibit the functioning of Big Business lobby-
ists in buying and dictating legislation in Congress;

e) Nationalize the atomic energy industry, and all public utili-
ties with full safeguards for the wages and conditions of the workers
as well as the right to organize and strike.

The historic struggle of the American people for public power
takes on wholly new dimensions today in the light of atomic energy.
This vast new source of power was developed out of the public re-
sources of the American people in wartime. It cannot be allowed to
remain a private domain of the trusts, subject to their notorious greed
and obstruction. The immense scope of this development, the inherent
dangers, and the widespread economic effects all require that it be
subjected to public control through the nationalization of the industry.
In recent months the AFL-CIO has been demanding the partial restora-
tion of public control over the peacetime use of atomic power.

Inevitably Labor, as the basic antagonist of Big Business in mod-
ern America, will prove to be the giant force around which all other
anti-monopoly elements will gravitate and to which they will look for
leadership. While such a perspective is not consciously recognized in
most sections of labor’s leadership, nevertheless, there is growing ap-
preciation of this outlook within its ranks, as well as among other
sections of the people. Over the past years labor has been playing
an increasing role in the life of the nation. With the recent AFL-CIO
merger it has placed itself in a position to play a still greater role.

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 269

The struggle to curb the monopolies cannot be properly devel-»
oped unless the growing coalition also finds its way towards effective
political expression. In the course of the campaign to organize the-
mass production industries, labor became increasingly aware of the-
fact that the defense of the interests of the workers and of their unions.
requires the extension of the struggle to legislative and political action.
This has become a permanent feature of the labor movement.

Independent political action of labor has been developing in vari--
ous forms.’ Such activity under the leadership of PAC, LLPE and
more recently the united body, COPE (Committee on Political Edu—-
cation), as well as by unions directly, takes the form of national and
state legislative conferences, delegations to Washington and state capi-
tals, participation at important levels of the major political parties-—
in most cases the Democratic Party—and large scale electoral activity-
The recent regional conferences of COPE have initiated a new cam-
paign broader than ever before to secure registration by union mem--
bers and their families and to distribute millions of copies of the-
voting records of Congressmen and Senators.

Most important, labor is taking steps in a number of places.
(notably in Detroit) to organize its own congressional district struc-
ture. If developed more broadly, this would represent a qualitatively
new forward step on the road of independent political action.

Labor, the Negro people, the farmers and small business, as they‘
confront the bi-partisan maneuvering with their most essential de-
mands, are giving more and more thought to the problem of political
realignment. This is taking the form at present of a new re—grouping
of their forces to combat the most reactionary elements, in certain cases.
within the GOP, but especially within the Democratic Party.

In Michigan, labor joined with liberal Democrats to oust the reac-»
tionary old guard from control of the Democratic state machine. In ..
Texas labor joined with other popular forces, as well as conservatives,
to break the grip of the Shivers Dixiecrats on the state Democratic-
Party. In Louisiana, labor, in parallel action with the Negro people
and other democratic forces, helped secure the defeat of the extreme -
Dixiecrats and the partial repeal of the state “right—to-work” law.

It is out of such experiences, developing in the states, that the
heightened consciousness of the need for political realignment will "
grow. The situation varies greatly from state to state. The possibility W

 
 

 

    
 
  

270 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

of the-labor and popular forces gaining decisive inﬂuence in a number
of key Democratic Party state organizations in the future, coupled
with a growing collaboration of independent and liberal Republican
political movements, may determine the form in which a new anti-
monopoly party emerges. For in the long run the working class and its
allies will have to have their own anti-monopoly coalition party capa-
ble of bringing about the eventual election of a people’s anti-monopoly
government.

Among those who are seeking a political realignment, some see
the possibility of transforming the Democratic Party into such an anti-
monopoly coalition party. They believe it possible to oust the Dixie—
crats, break down the inﬂuence of Big Business, win over liberal Re-
publicans and establish a coalition leadership of labor, farmers, Negro

_ people and small business.

Some, on the contrary, see the Democratic Party nationally in-
evitably continuing under the control of Big Business, surrendering
to or compromising with the Dixiecrats, vacillating or retreating on
labor and other democratic issues. They believe this will make it
necessary for labor and its allies to break away in order to form a new
mass labor—farmer party.

It is wrong to assume that the only possible form of political
realignment is a labor—farmer party. This rigid assumption can only
serve to hamper the actual development of labor’s independent polit-
ical action. At the present moment the task of the progressives is not
to prejudge the form of the eventual political realignment. The ex—
pansion of labor’s independent political role and all serious efforts to
transform the Democratic Party by ousting the Dixiecrats and under-
mining the inﬂuence of Big Business, help create the pre—conditions
for a new political alignment under labor’s leadership, whatever its
form. At the same time, the widest and most extensive education for
the formation of a new party led by labor facilitates labor’s current
struggle to inﬂuence the situation within the Democratic Party. For
it demonstrates that labor is not forever committed to the Democratic
Party and will eventually, in one way or another, build a new political
home for itself and its allies.

But irrespective of these viewpoints, the struggle to build the
people’s anti-monopoly coalition and to achieve its eﬂective independ-
ent political expression m.ust be carried forward. It must be carried

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 271

forward regardless of which major party controls the Administration
and Congress.

The signiﬁcance of the 1956 election is by no means limited to the
fact that the GOP lost the Congress and the Democrats lost the
Presidency. Beneath the surface were deep-going movements of labor,
the Negro people and the farmers which could ﬁnd expression only in
a limited, distorted way in the two-party electoral battle.

The , election outcome in a number of states, such as Michigan
and Washington, was inﬂuenced by a marked growth in labor’s polit-
ical activity, expressed especially in the Work of COPE, although in
many other places labor continues to lag in political action.

Large sections of Negro voters moved into the Republican column
as a result of Democratic refusal to break with the Eastland Dixie-
crats.

The growth of labor-farmer collaboration in the farm and West-
ern states brought about the defeat of a number of reactionary Repub-
licans west of the Mississippi.

Labor faces new challenges and new opportunities. For the grow-
ing contradiction between pre-election promises and post-election
deeds, requires, as never before, the expansion into all areas of labor’s
independent political action.

While Eisenhower exploited to advantage the universal desire of
the people for peace, the Eisenhower Doctrine deeply disturb-s wide sec-
tions in all walks.

While Eisenhower reaped a harvest of votes from amongst grow-
ing numbers who recoil against the Dixiecrats, and who demand
100%, full coverage of the Constitution to the Negro people, his post-
election failure to tackle the South as the Nation’s number one prob-
lem of democracy gives rise to ever-growing dissatisfaction.

The Democrats captured both houses of Congress as a result,
among other things, of widesp-read dissatisfaction over GOP failures
to halt inﬂation and to lower taxes. The people now expect Congress
to deliver on long-deferred promises to cut taxes, curb high proﬁts
and high prices.

While labor defeated many anti-labor Congressmen, control of
Congress remains in the hands of the reactionary anti-labor bloc of
Dixiecrats and die-hard Republicans. It is this bloc which prevents
not only civil rights ‘legislation, but also legislation on wages and

  

272 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

 

hours, housing, health, taxation, federal aid to education, public power,
social security, anything of an advanced or progressive nature. It is
this bloc which upholds Taft-Hartley, the Smith and McCarran Acts,
the “right to work” laws, the Un-American Committees.

It is this bloc which promotes the cold War and aggressive foreign
policies.

It is this bloc which keeps the South unorganized and at the
mercy of the Eastlands. This bloc is the guarantee of Dixiecrat mino-
rity rule in the Congress and hence in the nation. It is this bloc which
is the means whereby the two—party system at present affects the will
of the reactionary imperialists. The Dixiecrats are the weakest, most
vulnerable section of this bloc, the most obvious and immediate ene-
mies of labor and the Negro people.

It is this bloc which has launched new and menacing anti-labor
“investigations” parallelling dangerous Taft-Hartley persecutions un-
der the Justice Department, confronting the labor movement with the
need for a new initiative in defense of its gains and of democratic
rights generally.

The 1956 elections and developments in Congress since then have
raised more sharply than ever the need to oust the Dixiecrats, the need
for a new political realignment. More and more do events of the day
impel the labor movement to take commanding positions in the great
endeavor for political realignment.

But to be successful in this historic struggle for realignment, it
becomes necessary for labor, in collaboration with the Negro people
and farmers, to develop an independent program, an independent
policy, an independent position, which is advanced both within the
two—party arena of struggle, in the Democratic Party in particular,
as well as outside it, through labor’s own, independent political organ-
ization.

Hand in hand with the development of a people’s anti-monopoly
coalition, and indispensable to it as its chief dynamo, the emergence
of the American working class at long last as an independent political
force in the life of our nation stands out as an historic task on which
depends the further social progress of our country.

There are growing signs that awareness of this great need is
developing in the labor movement. A decade ago the voice which
called for a conference of labor, the Negro people and other forces to

 

i
3'

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 273

formulate and advance an independent people's program for the coun-
try was a voice in the wilderness. Today, the number of unions call-
ing for such a conference is growing apace as the political necessities
become clearer and the need more evident.

Innumerable opportunities face the forces of labor and the people
to advance the anti-monopoly coalition and promote labor’s independ-
ent political role in the many local, state and national struggles that
are being waged on the community, shop, legislative and electoral
level, before, during and after the 1957 local and state elections.

If it is to advance, this struggle will also have to overcome a num-
ber of road ‘blocks and bring about certain long overdue democratic
reforms. These are necessary to correct abuses which have developed
in our system of government and operate to thwart even that degree
of majority rule which is possible under the present political parties.

Outstanding among these reforms are:

a) Federal guarantee of the right to vote in all elections without
discrimination;

b) Abolition of the seniority system in Congressional comrnit-
tees;

A c) Amendment of Senate Rule 22 so as to make possible the
ending of a filibuster;

d) Abolition of gerrymandering by state legislatures in laying
out the size and boundaries of Congressional districts, as well as in
representation to state legislatures, in order to correct inequities in
representation as between urban and rural areas and to assure the right
of the Negro people to full representation;

e) Abolition of the electoral college and election of the President
by direct popular vote;

f) Elimination of legal obstacles to placing minority parties and
independent candidates on the ballot; adoption of proportional repre-
sentation;

g) Introduction in all states of initiative, referendum and recall.

The struggle to bring about a political realignment, based on the
formation and election to power of an anti-monopoly coalition led by
labor, is the great strategic task of the next stage in the democratic and
social advance of the American people. It is the giant corporations
which block the path to economic progress, civil rights, fuller de-
mocracy and durable peace. It is their challenge that must be met by

 

 

274 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the American people as they carry forward their struggle under the
new conditions of today.

Many questions of the content of the anti-monopoly coalition, and
especially of labor’s role in relation to it, remain unanswered. In order
for our Party to make its maximum contribution towards helping the
labor movement emerge as an independent political force and thereby
promote the progress of the anti-monopoly coalition, it is necessary to
‘determine the present level of development of the working class as
distinguished from the ’3o’s and ’4o’s; the character of its labor move-
ment; its present—day program; the direction in which it is moving;
the chief ideological questions confronting it; how it can develop
heightened political consciousness in the course of economic and other
struggles, and many other questions.

Towards this end, the National Committee shall organize a series
of regional conferences bringing together National Committee mem-
bers and representative groups of industrial workers for a common
searching into these matters, on the basis of which it shall organize
either an extraordinary national conference or a special enlarged
National Committee meeting devoted to working out and resolving
these problems in their most essential basic aspects.

III. COMMUNISTS AND THE LABOR MOVEMENT*

The merger of the AFL and the CIO has greatly increased the
strength of the organized working men and women of this country.
This movement of 18 million workers has great power to advance the
economic interests of themselves and their families, and, if properly
employed, great power to stand at the head of a people’s movement
for the defeat of the reactionary policies of the big monopolies and for
taking the high road to a better life for the American people.

Labor is displaying new vigor in economic struggles. Its growing
maturity is expressed in its increased concern for demands and issues
presented by other sections of the population. Labor forces interest

themselves in community relations of all kinds and are beginning to
form alliances with other sections of the population—both for labor’s
program and also for a people's program.

While these 18 million organized workers today constitute a
greater numerical force than the eight million of the I93o’s, they did
not grow up in the same experiences of class struggle. The workers in
the ’3o’s went through the great unemployed struggles. They knew
the open shops and they learned the lessons of class struggle in the bit—
ter battles to organize the mass production industries. For many work-
ers today, union membership is often little more than a condition of
employment.

The chief antagonists of labor, the monopolies, strengthened by
grabbing imperialist super—proﬁts, have also increased their power, by
forming new mergers and more powerful combines, by the Cadillac
Cabinet’s anti—labor orientation, by their stranglehold on the economic
life of the country. Because they fear the growing strength of the
labor movement and its new alliances and community responsibility,
they will continue to try to cripple labor’s economic and political
activity through anti—labor legislation (the Taft—Hartley law, “right to
work” laws), through monopoly—dorninated government agencies, and
legislation restricting labor’s political rights. They carry on a battle
of ideas directed toward “brainwashing” the class feelings out of the
workers on the one hand, while on the other they attempt to arouse
the hostility of non—labor sections of the public against trade unions.
In the name of combatting inﬂation, they are getting ready to resist
the continuing wage demands of the workers.

The ﬁght for a higher standard of living is at the heart of the
everyday existence of the trade unions. Insecurity casts its shadow
over the present “prosperity.” The people are loaded down with in-
stallment and mortgage debts. Between two and three millions of
workers are totally unemployed. Millions more cannot get a full
week’s work, and there are “pockets of unemployment,” areas where
joblessness has become critical and lasting. Compounding all this is
the fear that the advance of automation will cost the jobs of millions
more.

Automation is leading to increased productivity and the begin-
nings today of the displacement of labor. Workers everywhere are
uneasy about the future of their jobs. Herbert Hoover, Secretary

  

 

 

276 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

 
 

Humphrey, James Carey, have all expressed their concern about the
possibility of an economic setback. This has created demands among
the workers for a program of job security, involving GAW, much
larger pensions and severance pay programs and a deep concern for
job security in terms of the entire economy.

The employers count on day-to-day introduction of speedup, cut-
ting of rates, cutting of crews and other devices to increase the ex-
ploitation of the workers. The workers are correctly not limiting the
struggle in the shops to the once—in—three years contract struggle. In
the basic industries, in the auto shops, in the steel mills, the ﬁght
against such grievances is the heart of union activity as the workers
see it. It reﬂects the class struggle at its roots.

The American workers are not taking all this lying down. They
are aggressively advancing new demands: annual wages, supplement-
ary unemployment beneﬁts, the shorter work week, new sights on
health and welfare, pensions and severance pay.

The search by labor for more lasting answers to these problems
is giving rise to a variety of proposals. The sum total of many of these
could comprise a program of action. So-me of the main points are:

1) Further Development of Trade Union Unity. The advances
towards eliminating jurisdictional quarrels and craft-industrial differ-
ences, the merger of a few international unions, important progress in
state mergers, examples of joint organizing and negotiating activity-
these meet with hearty approval by the workers. They feel that un-
resolved problems must not be permitted to prevent united activity.

There is a growing consciousness that Negro—white unity is the
bedrock for the advance of the whole labor movement. Every blow
aiding the elimination of discrimination strengthens unity.

All-embracing unity requires tackling in a similar spirit the spe-
cial problems o-f skilled workers. It requires an appreciation of the
need for united action with a large segment of workers in independent
unions. Attention is also needed for the problems of women and
young workers who play a decisive role in many industries and yet
do not take their proper role in the life of the unions.

The racketeering, gangsterism and undemocratic practices plagu-
ing some sections of labor stand astride the path of unity. Doing in-
jury to labor’s reputation with the general public, they retard the
formation of a coalition of labor and its allies. We greet the new de-

 

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 277

termination on the part of the labor movement to cut out this mal-
ignancy as shown in proceedings initiated by the Ethical Practices
Committee of AFL-CIO. At the same time, there is a grave danger
for the rights of all labor in the decision of the AFL-CIO policy state-
ment recommending removal of trade union leaders who use the
Fifth Amendment in investigations before Congressional Commit-
tees. For while the workers correctly wish to curb and end racketeer-
ing in unions, it is a serious mistake and harmful to deprive labor of
its constitutional rights and thereby to deprive it of the means of de-
fense against witchhunting and labor—busting employers and their
stooges in Washington.

There are a number of practical tasks which can help develop
unity. Common programs can be worked out among competing unions
for organization of the unorganized particularly in the South. Joint
conference board meetings can be held of unions organized in the
same chain. Joint negotiations can take place where more than one
union has a contract with a single employer. Such steps, for which
there is already some experience, would in a practical way contribute
to solidifying trade union unity.

In addition there are the contributions that can be made to over-
come the obstacles to the merger of the city and state federations; the
move to encourage the amalgamation of unions in any single industry
and ﬁnally unity and parallel action of all kinds on all issues that ad-
vance labor’s interests.

2) Organization of the Unorganized. Millions of workers are
in the open shops. The non-union low—p-aying shops of the South
stand as a threat to the wage standards of organized workers. The
South is also the source of much of the anti-labor legislation and of
the so-called “right to work” laws. The South, with its jimcrow sys-
tem rivets reactionary monopoly domination upon the whole country.
Organizing the unorganized in the South would bring in its train a
whole fresh democratic upsurge in the country. Yet the job has not
been begun in spite of many declarations by the leaders of AFL-CIO.

The recent decision of the AFL-CIO to launch a mass organizing
drive of non—production workers in industry is a necessary task and
possible of achievement. But it cannot be regarded as a substitute for
the decisive task of organizing the unorganized in the South.

3) The Demand for the Shorter Work Week. More and more

 

 

 

 

 

278 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

unions are placing this demand for a shorter work week with no
reduction in pay as their chief answer to the problems of insecurity
and of advancing automation.

Big Business with its false propaganda that automation will in-
crease the number of jobs, and that the country faces a “labor short-
age” in the period ahead, is preparing to do battle against this demand.
Conscious of the fundamental nature of this demand especially in a
period of economic instability and the rise of a radically new tech-
nology, Communists give their wholehearted support to its realiza-
tion through economic and political action.

4) Extension of Alliance: Between Lab-or cmd Its Allies. Unions
have begun more and more to participate in the struggles of the Negro
people and the farmers. There is an increasing recognition that their
ability to achieve trade union objectives is bound up with the struggle
of all democratic forces in the country. The expansion of cooperation
between labor and these groups, the increased activity of the unions
on Education, Health, Civil Rights and other questions, will bring
closer the realization of a people’s coalition.

5) Greater Independent Political Activity. The uniﬁcation of
labor has given a new quality to its political activity. COPE’s political
activity has helped to produce a more independent and outspokenly
critical attitude, and has increased labor’s influence in the Democratic
Party. The growth of this inﬂuence on the part of labor was observed
in the recent period in the role of the UAW in Michigan and in the
inﬂuence of organized labor in the California Democratic Party organ-
ization. A minor but noteworthy fact too is that a few prominent labor
leaders have recently made reference to the possibility of a new party
to be led by labor. More decisive participation on the part of the 18
million organized workers and their families, more energetic inter-
vention by the unions in political life, is the prime requisite for creat—
ing a new political alignment in the country, through which labor, the
farmers and the Negro people will best beat back the monopolists and
lay the basis for a better America.

In this connection, labor can most effectively develop its independ-
ent political activity by involving the membership of the unions in
support of the legislative program of AFL-CIO, around questions of
anti-labor legislation, such as the state “right to work” laws, state

 

(U "I \J U)

legislation of supplementary unemployment beneﬁts and increase of
beneﬁts, the struggle for tax reduction, etc.

6) Towards Peace in the World and a Peace-time Economy.
There is a wholesome debate in the labor movement on foreign policy.
It reﬂects the pressure of the workers’ desire for lasting peace and
secure peace—time jobs as against those in the labor leadership who go
along with Dulles’ Big Business foreign policy. Proposals and actions
from some international unions around an “Atoms for Peace” pro-
gram, economic aid (without strings) to underdeveloped countries,
for peaceful competitive coexistence, banning of A- and H-bomb tests,
and an end to the threat of atomic war——these represent a response to
the workers’ sentiments. However, this is not the dominant trend.
What is dominant in the AFL-CIO leadership is a trend bitterly
hostile to the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This infects
their attitude on all aspects of foreign policy and runs contrary to the
desire for peace of their own members and the public at large. This
dominant trend equates negotiations with “appeasement,” keeps an
iron curtain between workers of our country and workers of socialist
lands and rejects the possibility of peaceful coexistence.

Under the hammering of the debate, under the inﬂuence of the
Geneva Conference, under the impact of the membership’s desire for
peace, the cold war outlook was compelled to give some ground. How-
ever, the drive of the State Department to give support to the move-
ment to overthrow socialist governments, to put across the Eisenhower
Doctrine for intervention in the Mid-East and to attempt a general re-
treat back to the cold war, has had an effect on some of the leaders
of the labor movement. Some of them have joined the campaign for
so—called “liberation.” In spite of these negative developments, the
workers’ desire for peace can restore the movement for peaceful coex—
istence on the basis of the positions already taken by AFL-CIO and
many of its aﬂiliates.

There is a basis for such a movement among workers. It lies in
their fear that the Eisenhower Doctrine may lead to a new Korea in
the Middle East. It lies in their concern about not getting involved in
the internal struggles of Eastern Europe to the point of world war.
It lies also in the fact that some unions have called for limiting arma-
ments and ending H-bomb tests. It can be developed on the basis of
workers’ fear of the economic and social consequences of the war pro-

 

  

 

 

  

 

 

280 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

gram, such as the high taxes. A movement based on the above can set
roadblocks in the path of the Wall Street war makers and open the
road to a second Geneva.

7) Trade Union Democracy. In the course of the past two
decades, a vast trade union structure has developed which tends to
exclude the rank and ﬁle from the affairs of the union and in defense
of their day—to—day shop conditions. Contracts, once relatively simple,
are now replete with hundreds of complicated, procedural, delaying
clauses, particularly those dealing with the grievance procedure. Com-
pany security clauses, penalization clauses, long term contracts, union
time study “experts” who do not oppose company production stand-
ards—all make it more diﬂicult for the workers to carry on the daily
struggle in the shop.

As a result, the full ﬁghting strength of the union is not mobilized
in forcing the company to improve conditions within the shop. Faced
with piling up of grievances and increased exploitation, the workers
in many shops are now searching out ways to rally and to fight the
companies in spite of these restricting inﬂuences. All this forces the
Workers to struggle for greater participation in the aﬁairs of the union.
It forces them to search for new ways to utilize the union machinery
for their struggle against the companies. The recent “raise in dues”
and election struggles in Steel bear this out. The struggle to increase
trade union democracy by the greatest participation of the rank and
ﬁle is a decisive prerequisite for further substantial advance by the
trade union movement.

Such is the general outline of a long range program shaping up
outof the economic and political facts of life pressing upon the labor
movement. One cannot say, however, that there exists any Wide
recognition that the acceptance of this program and its implementa-
tion, would make the trade union movement the leading component of
the people’s anti—monopoly coalition. This important ingredient of
understanding has as yet not developed.

We of the Communist Party will do our best to contribute to the
clearest grasp of these questions. We will do our utmost, side by side
with the workers, to help achieve the successful outcome of these new
undertakings by our participation in struggles and by helping to
give them a conscious direction and purpose.

The Communist Party has made signiﬁcant contributions to

labor’s history. Communists pioneered for industrial unionism and or-
ganizatron of the unorganized in basic industry. Unemployment insur-
ance was once called “red” because Communists ﬁrst fought for
it. To many hard—fought strikes the Communists contributed support
and leadership. Long before the labor movement achieved its present
stature, Communists urged independent political action, unity of
labor, unity of Negro and white. We always stressed the common in-
terests of the Workers of all countries and the need to unite for their
common goals. These ideas and proposals played a part in the forum-
tion and growth of CIO, and in the forward movement of AFL. Mil-
lions of workers tested in life many of the ideas and slogans ﬁrst
advanced by the Communists. This has been a recognized contribu-
tion of the Communist Party to labor.

At the close of World War II American Big Business thought it
had its golden opportunity to boss the world and beat down the work-
ers at home. The American workers fought back in a tremendous
wave of successful postwar strikes.

But Big Business achieved some sinister successes. They were able
to put over the idea of imminent “Soviet aggression” and “subver-
sion” as a cover-up for their own aggressive schemes. With the hys-
teria—mills working full blast, they began to weaken labor militancy
and unity by stimulating attacks on Communists and Left—progressive
workers. This made it easier for them to put across their anti-labor
legislation.

It was a service to the labor movement and the American people
that we Communists exposed and gave warning of the real objectives
of Big Business. Yet we recognize that in exposing these real aims,
in trying to help the labor movement to ﬁght back, we Communists
made some serious and harmful mistakes. The leadership of the Party
Was mostly responsible for these errors and often imposed them over
the resistance of the Party membership in industry.

In spite of our long years of participation in the leadership of
outstanding economic struggles, we failed to remember that the unions
are in the ﬁrst place organizations dedicated to the improvement of
economic conditions. We assumed that the political questions most
important in our minds were most immediate in the minds of the
Workers. We failed patiently to make clear the connections between
the day-to-day struggle of the workers and these same issues.

 

 

 

 

282 . PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

In pursuing this attitude, we exaggerated our inﬂuence and sup-
port. We did not realize that a union might elect some Left forces to
the leadership without being a Left union. In the diﬂicult postwar
period many important labor leaders, with whom we had worked
harmoniously, began to go along with many phases of the Govern-
ment—Big Business foreign policy outlook. They inﬂuenced the big
majority of the unions’ membership in the same direction.

With our somewhat inﬂated estimates of our base, we proved in-
ﬂexible when the times called for ﬂexibility in tactics. On too many
occasions when ruptures had become probable, we helped to make
them inevitable.

The expulsion of the progressive—led unions from C.I.O., for ex-
ample, was part of an organized campaign led by certain labor leaders
with the approval, if not under the direct instigation of the State De-
partment, to split the trade union movement and guarantee support
to the cold war. As correct as was our struggle for peace and independ-
ent political action, our inflexible insistence on the adoption of a
third party perspective and a condemnation of the Marshall Plan
facilitated the objectives of the cold war splitters.

For their part, the progressive—led unions fought bravely and well.
Despite the violence of the attacks against them, their ﬁght for policies
of peace, civil liberties and civil rights, and on economic questions,
gave heart to many workers, and stirred other sections of labor. Un-
fortunately, within these unions the struggle to re—unite the labor
movement—a demand getting increasing response from the workers
—did not command the same energetic attention. The split took its
deadly toll.

We Communists failed to pursue policies after the expulsions that
could have led in the least possible time to re-uniﬁcation.

The workers then, as now, faced harsh and immediate economic
problems. Here above all was the basis for a ﬁght on our part for con-
tinuing class relations with masses of Workers. This would have favor-
ably inﬂuenced eﬂorts to continue a minimum united front even with
the leadership.

The kind of mistakes we have been discussing are left-sectarian
errors. These mistakes were reﬂected generally and did injury to the
ﬁne tradition of our Party as the outstanding advocate of trade union
umty.

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 283

In this postwar period, our thoughts, interests and concern began
to center around those in the labor movement who agreed with our
point of view, rather than on the essential but inﬁnitely more diﬂicult
task of resolutely ﬁghting to unite all labor to meet employer attacks.
While we were quite correctly concerned with the most dynamic sec-
tion of labor—the CIO-—our concern got to be one-sided. In fact, we
ignored a consideration of the problems of the majority of the work—
ers in the AFL. This was particularly true after the unjustiﬁed expul-
sion of the progressive-led unions from the CIO in 1949.

After the 1952 elections, as demands for unity became more in-
tense, our Party more energetically called for united labor action as a
step in the direction of labor unity. This call, valid as it Was, neverthe-
less did not measure up to what was needed. Hobbled by our estimate
of the political situation and our evaluation of the trade union leader-
ship, our call for united action was in effect suggesting a pre-unity
“trial period” which workers felt had long since passed. In the absence-
of a real and sustained ﬁght for trade union unity, many comrades in
the Party were unprepared for the rapidity with which organic unity
was achieved between the AFL and the CIO. A few even felt that this
was in fact a State Department “plot,” not warranting our support.
Hence, as a consequence of our back-sliding on this question, the
Communists, the traditional and most forceful proponents of such
unity, had little to contribute to realize the full potential of organic
unity when the merger of AFL and CIO ﬁnally came about.

As a result of the postwar attacks, taken together with our own
errors, the Party today does not have the inﬂuence among workers it
had in past years. Today, some union leaders feel called upon to vie
with each other in expressing their opposition to the Party and Com-
munism. Innumerable constitutional provisions bar Communists from
membership or from holding of-lice in many unions. There is a fear
among many workers to knowingly associate with us. In spite of this,
there have been some changes taking place in the most recent period.
The easing of tensions on a world scale as well as the correction and
overcoming of a number of the fore—mentioned errors, is making it pos-
sible for Communist workers to participate on a more normal basis
in the trade union activity of their shops and local unions. In some
instances, new coalitions, including workers long known as Left—wing-
ers, have been formed. This trend towards fuller unity, especially at

 

 
 

 

 

  

 

 

284 ‘ PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

the local union level, has been growing. While this is true, the ab-
normal and harmful attitude towards the Communist Party as such on
the part of the labor leadership and most workers, still prevails. This is
of no help to the labor movement itself.

An examination of the work of our Party in the last period shows
that we have a considerable distance to go to eliminate the mistakes
of the ‘past. These errors are the responsibility of the Party leadership.
They penetrated deep into the organization. Therefore, many hang-
overs of the past still remain. We particularly need a ﬁrmer effort to
eliminate sectarian “oppositionist” ‘policies not based on program,
and to develop a clearer understanding for ourselves and others on
the relationships between the Party and the trade unions. We have
been very slow to overcome our errors in the ﬁeld of trade union
policy. This only emphasizes the need for closer relations between the
Party leadership and the workers in our Party. The experience of
these comrades emphasizes that the main thing for the Party is work at
the shop level, that trade union work is above all shop work, con-
cern about what is happening in the departments, the grievances, the
thinking and discussion there, the problems of developing one’: base
there. It requires an end to the “departmentalization,” the separation
of industrial problems from the leading committees.

##1##

In this spirit we must examine the trends in the labor movement,
and the conceptions on which we have heretofore based our analysis.

.We should free ourselves from the frozen “political labels” of
“left,” “right,” “center.” For some time now such characterizations
have not given a valid picture ofwhat has actually been happening.
These conceptions were no longer levers of our understanding; we
failed to see, study and assess the new changes, the shifts, the differen-
tiations that were shattering all “compartments” and dissolving old
“labels.”

On this score there are profound lessons for us in the merger
itself. The sharp diversity of views that existed prior to the merger,
and which still exists, was not an insurmountable barrier to uniﬁca-
tion and has not prevented the subsequent advance of unity. In rela-
tion to the struggle for Negro rights, the fact that there were what we
have called “left,” “right,” and “center” views, did not prevent the

merger convention from unanimously electing two Negro vice—presi-
dents. Therefore, the overwhelming unity of the most diverse elements:
in labor is possible of achievement on decisive questions. The best way
to contribute to that unity is not to “pigeon-hole” the various forces,
but to see their many-sided character in relation to each speciﬁc issue.
Above all we must bear in mind that life and struggle compel
changes. The movements of the millions of workers, their growing,
consciousness and will, are the primary force for welding the unity of
membership and leadership around the major tasks.

The use of old formulas led some progressives and some in our
own ranks to hold the opinion that the merger of leaderships of AFL
and CIO would result in nothing but a “reactionary combination.”
Those who came to such a conclusion took no account of the move-
ment of millions of workers, and what large numbers of them expected
and demanded of the merger.

Most of the trade ‘union leaders in AFL—CIO are staunch defend—-
ers of capitalism. This affects their view on all questions even though
they are often impelled by the offensive of the employers and the
struggle of the workers to oppose the capitalists. However, it causes-
them to hesitate and backtrack even on slogans like that of the 30-hour"
week. They tend in the direction of uncritical support of the Demo--
cratic Party.

Such trade union leaders are caught in a contradiction between
their staunch support for capitalism and the need of the workers to-
engage in sharp battle against the employers’ oﬁensives. Often the
leaders themselves are threatened with extinction by these offensives
against the unions. Therefore, to maintain themselves and to retain
their base, they must, often in spite of themselves, engage in and lead‘
sharp struggles, however unwelcome such struggles may be to them.

But this in itself further conﬁrms the idea that the corporations,
and not these trade union leaders, are the main enemy against whom
the main blow must be struck. The path to victory lies in the fullest
mobilization of the rank and ﬁle on the main issues——shop conditions,
civil rights, peace, independent political action—against the monopol-
ists and their political agents in Washington. On the basis of a full‘
mobilization on such issues will it be possible often to develop move-
ments including many reluctant leaders of the trade unions, who,
while they deplore class struggle, must at the same time retain their

286 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

connections with the workers. That is why freezing people into cate-
gories of “center” or “right” with the idea that they cannot be budged
into a position of struggle on concrete questions can prove—and has
proved—very harmful in developing the widest unity in the actual
course of the struggles of labor.

At the same time, one must take into account that when some of
these labor leaders, in the course of the struggle, take the side of the
employers on speciﬁc questions, such as speed—up in the mills or spon-
sorship of wage cuts, the consistent struggle against the employers
forces the rank and ﬁle into conflict with these trade union leaders.
This is true in principle of political questions as well, although there is
no movement of the rank and ﬁle to the same degree as on economic

 

questions. Failure to take note of this can lead to serious right oppor—'

tunist errors and to isolation from the mass militant movement of the
rank and ﬁle against such leadership.

What is new, what is important, what must be seen for valid I

judgment is that there is a great deal of fluidity: the leadership do
not group themselves in identical fashion in relation to all questions.

Lines have not fully hardened, although certain general tendencies
seem apparent. Around most of the former CIO unions and some of
the AFL, there is developing a relatively more positive and militant
perspective. Among leaders of the Building Trades, the Teamsters
and some others, there is a more conservative trend and in some in-
stances, reactionary points of view. This latter trend has been the
major source of obstacles to the strengthening of the federation’s unity

and of continuing attacks on the industrial unions. Within this trend

are to be found the most conservative positions on the political ﬁeld,
and a “go slow” attitude towards the whole federation’s organizing
objectives. Thereby they inhibit the activity of the merged labor move-
ment and lessen its effectiveness.

Yet, as has been seen, on individual questions even some of these
leaders can be moved to proceed in unity with the majority of the
labor leadership.

On the grounds of such an estimate, which does not pre—fabricate
hard and fast lines of division, the signiﬁcance of the intervention or
the millions of members becomes overwhelming. That intervention,
based on the workers’ desire to move ahead, can defeat any grouping
or trend within the federation that obstructs progress on speciﬁc issues.

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 287

What is new and different, corresponding to the new situation in
our country and the world, is that the defeat of any reactionary trend
and real advance in meeting unprecedented historic tasks, can only be
accomplished by the struggle for an all—cml7racz'n g unity around speci-
ﬁc issues, a struggle that can move even some of the most reluctant.
Such a unity cannot be achieved by continuing to think in old terms
and to judge the present positions of leaders by the use of old labels
of “left,” “right,” and “center.”

The most conscious, active and militant workers, including those
of socialist conviction, can add strength and consistency to the struggle
and gain strength and support themselves by virtue of their contribu-
tions. We believe and regard as vi.tal that there will be a new and re-
vived Left in the American labor movement. It will emerge from
militant forces which exist and assert themselves primarily on ques-
tions of economic struggle and civil rights today in many unions.
Such a movement of the workers has not yet crystallized on other
political questions, such as foreign policy and safeguarding democracy
around which struggles will undoubtedly develop in the future. The
sharpening attacks by Big Business, the urgent need and advantages
for the working class of a policy of peaceful coexistence, we believe
will in time stimulate the emergence of a revived and revitalized Left
in this country, and it is the task of Communists to stimulate and en-
courage such a movement.

The body of more than two million Negro unionists, now organ-
ized within the federation, constitutes a great power for furthering
the labor—Negro people’s alliance. They not only compel attention to
their economic demands as unionists, but also bring forward to labor
the struggles of their own people for elementary democratic and equal
rights. In so doing, these millions of Negro unionists give stability and
depth to the alliance.

The southern organizing drive would be the single most power-
ful factor in welding the Negro-labor alliance in a common struggle
against the Dixiecrats, who are the main obstacle to the freedom of the
Negro people and the forgers of chains for labor in the halls of
Congress and in the open shops of the South. The merger of these
two great struggles of our times into one great common battle would

mark the high point of the American people’s struggle for a better
America.

 

 

 

 

28_8 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

This developing Negro-labor alliance, however, has formidable
opponents within the labor movement. Except in the South, they dare
not now operate in broad daylight. But in large areas of the labor
movement the Negro is still barred, if not by regulation, then by cus-
tom or practice. The leading jimcrow “bitter—enders” in labor’s ranks
ﬁght policies of integration and equality for Negro workers and try
to check the Federation’s full participation in the surging battles
around school desegregation, against the White Citizens’ Councils,
and for the right to vote.

This alliance is now intertwined with the very ﬁbre of the labor
movement. It makes its mark on every major policy and action of
AFL-CIO. Certain of our more recent judgments of this alliance,
which were founded on suspicion of the “motives” of various Negro
and labor leaders—incorrect at the time—would be disastrous today.

True estimates must be based on reckoning soberly with the
movement of millions of Negro workers, _of the entire 16,000,000
Negro people, who have set a new time schedule for complete
emancipation now.

The advance of the Negro—labor alliance is supremely important
for the progress of labor and our nation. But its advance will not be
automatic. All who see this have the prime responsibility of giving
their best thought and effort in the continuing ﬁght for its existence
and furtherance. This requires a practical day to day struggle against
every form of discrimination.

Keeping ever mindful that the need for supporting the desire of
the Negro workers to have direct representation in the leadership of
this labor movment is in the interests of all workers, we must ﬁnd
ways to move for and support the desire of the Negro workers to
rise from the unskilled classiﬁcations. The ﬁght for upgrading is a
key ﬁght in the shops today.

Over and above all this, there is needed the commitment of labor’s
full strength in support of the battles of the Negro people in the
South. There is also required an alert response to the intensiﬁcation
of the job problems created by the new technology.

know that the Communists are capable of the greatest devotion and
self—sacriﬁce. We pledge that devotion and self—sacriﬁce, not only to
the everyday struggles of the workers, but also to helping labor accom—
plish those historic goals which arise out of the new era in the life of
the labor movement itself.

It is not the policy of the Communist Party to interfere with,
“bore from within,” or to seek to capture or control the trade unions.
We reject any allegation that this is our policy. We respect the com-
plete political and organizational independence of the trade unions
and other organizations of the working class. We Communists seek
to inﬂuence the organized workers by persuasion, discussion and ex-
ample, as we do any other section of the population. Abiding by the
discipline of the union, we always favor the full involvement of the
membership in policy-making as well as the activities of the unions.

Workers who are Communists are organized on the basis of their
natural day—to—day working life in shops and industries. There has
been a general reafﬁrmation of this form of organization. Along with
this there is not only a desire for strengthening, but also for ﬂexibility
of application in certain areas of work.

Much has been made of the Party’s emphasis on the role of work-
ers in the most basic industries of our country—steel, auto, and the
like. The word, “concentration,” has been given all kinds of sinister
meanings. In point of fact, the concern of the C.P. for these workers
is entirely natural. Our Party is an organization of the working class.
It is just these workers who are by the circumstances of their lives
placed in direct conﬂict with big business. They constitute the largest
portion of all industrial workers. Producing directly for the monop-
olies they daily come face to face with monopoly greed, monopoly
speed-up and monopoly discrimination. American labor history has
shown that it is these workers who have engaged in some of the long-
est and bitterest struggles. Their organization into the ranks of the
CIO during the late ’3o’s had great inﬂuence on the militancy of all
labor, gave a new lift to the American labor movement.

For these reasons our Party believes that in the coming together
of all those who want to curb the monopolies, these basic industrial
workers will be the very bone and sinew of the movement.

We further believe that of necessity, such will be their role
through all of those sharp class struggles which must precede any

 

.290 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

peaceful changing over to socialism in our country, a transition which
we envision as possible and which we want to make real. Militant
trade union struggles, however, do not lead automatically to socialist
consciousness. If our Party helps the workers to draw the lessons from
these struggles they will begin to see that only a socialist transforma-
tion of property relations can bring about a ﬁnal solution to their
problems.

The Communist Party is deeply convinced that the workers of
our country are that class which will lead the whole people towards a
better future. This conviction leads the Communists to do all in their
power to help the workers in all their struggles, to assist in organiz-
ing them, and to stand shoulder to shoulder with their fellow-union-
ists in the front ranks when the battle grows hot.

Others insist that we have “People’s Capitalism” and that capi-
talists and workers are “co—partners,” or have a “mutual trusteeship”
for the system as a whole. Alongside such views exists a theory (often
put into practice) that the workers should even “sacriﬁce,” and by
accepting lower wages or speed—up or both, assist their own employer
to “compete” with others.

The point of view of the Communist Party is that of class strag-
gle, and the need to support without reservation the side of the work-
ing class. Other views may be generally termed as those of class col-
laboration, and its adherents within labor also assert the need to
strengthen labor’s side in a collaboration that they are compelled to
admit is far from tranquil. For our part, we Communists say there is
a clear basis for the unity of all those who are on labor’: side in those
everyday struggles whose existence no one can deny, and whose solu-
tion demands united effort.

The Communist Party believes that the interests of the American
workers are at one with the workers of other lands. We hailed world
labor unity which came about as a by—product of broad anti-fascist
unity, victorious in World War II. With the coming of the Cold
War, the disruption of this unity, instigated by the monopolies, did
harm to the aspirations of world labor. The easing of world tensions
following upon the Geneva Conference gives hope for the resumption
of that unity. Certainly, the far-ﬂung nature of American Big Busi-
ness with its branches and properties stretching around the world,

spurs the need for international united action of the workers. The -

common objectives of the ICFTU and the WFTU, the two centers
of labor on a world scale, should inspire conciliatory discussions of
past differences and a fresh approach to united action and to unity.

Ours is the age of atomic energy and automation. A power of
production beyond the dreams of any previous generation has come
into being. Yet in our country there is not just rejoicing, there is also
fear. Why should this be so? It is because deep down in the minds of
millions of our countrymen is the question: will these enormous forces,
monopoly—owned, result in abundance for all or further enrichment
of the few and the ruin of the many? Monopoly—owned, will these
gigantic productive forces mean unending peace. or a war that will
end all?

The people’s concern is just. They have seen what was called the
“industrial revolution” in our country during the ’2o’s wind up in the
colossal crash of 1929, a crash from which we did not emerge for a
decade, and then only under the stimulus of a new World War. The
people have seen capitalism unleash two world wars in successive gen—
erations.

Therefore an irrepressible searching for new answers is astir in
America. In the labor movement it shows itself in discussion over
whether atomic energy shall be privately developed and controlled or
whether it shall be the government’s province. It shows itself in labor’s
refusal to accept assurances that automation will bring nothing but
good, in labor’s restless search for a program to meet already-felt prob-
lems.

We of the Communist Party share in the popular feeling that
there must be new answers. The labor movement has a strength that
can impose demands that are unprecedented, demands required for a
situation without precedent. Certainly labor is grimly determined never
again to permit the full and ghastly toll of economic storms to be prin-
cipally exacted from the working people. A great coalition of the
people, led by labor, can achieve that goal towards which they have
striven for nearly a century: to curb the monopolies by winning politi-
cal supremacy.

Communists believe a socialist reorganization of our society to be
the ultimate answer. We believe, to the extent that the vast new pro-
ductive forces develop, they will more and more put unbearable strains
on social relations that permit such forces to be owned by a handful of

 
 

 

. 292 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

monopolists and operated to serve their proﬁt aims. Atomic energy
and automation press against such restraints; they demand a social sys-
tem of production for the use and beneﬁt of all, a system possible
only under the people’s ownership of the means of production. Such
a system, socialism, can only come about when the working people
and the majority of all the people of our country have become con-
vinced of its desirability through their own experiences and thoughts.
The Communist Party seeks to further this through its advocacy of
socialism, to be achieved democratically by majority will and by peace-
ful means.

This then is why we are convinced that there is a special role for
Communists among the workers:

‘ 0 For their conscious participation in the daily struggles;

O For their ability to help draw lessons from each battle and

to help chart the course ahead——for an anti—monopoly coali-
tion of labor, the farmers and the Negro people;

0 For their unreserved position on the side of the workers in

the class struggle;

O For their conviction of the identity of interest of the work-

ers of our country with the workers of others;

0 For their profound belief in the desirability and the inevita-

bility of a socialist transformation of our country.

The experiences of the workers themselves as they live and ﬁght
and think deeply about their problems is the only way in which they
will come to conclusions. Our Party with its scientific socialist outlook
can help spark this thinking. The future of the American labor move-
ment will also be shaped by the tremendous force for progress that
has arisen from within the ranks of labor and is sweeping across many
lands. For the American trade union movement is part of the labor
movement of the world.

IV. RALLY TO THE BANNER OF STRUGGLE FOR
NEGRO FREEDOM—-KEY TO STRENGTHENING
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY

The Negro people of our country are ﬁghting with unbending
will and irresistible resolve to secure now the whole measure of their

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 293

constitutional rights as free and equal citizens. The determination is
dramatically portrayed in the massive battles they are waging against
segregation in the South today.

Over a half million Negroes in deep Southern cities are participat-
ing daily in organized direct action: to break the Jim Crow barrier
in bus transportation. More than a hundred thousand are engaged
in organized campaigns on a single issue——to secure the right to vote;
they aim to utilize the ballot as a weapon in the struggle to deregregate
and to democratize Southern life. I

Millions of Negroes the country over are giving moral and ﬁnan-
cial support to the legal battles being waged in hundreds of school
districts against the Jim-Crow barriers to equal and non—segregated
education. And ﬁercely proud and courageous Southern Negro par-
ents commit their children to the battle. These daring boys and girls
defy hate-inspired mobs to attend “desegregated” schools. They are
the heroic “Young Guard” of a people ﬁghting for their freedom.

In scope, militancy and effectiveness the Negro People's Move-
ment has reached a maturity unparalleled in recent generations.

This fact of glorious struggle is the most vital reality in Negro
life today. Not the quantity or ‘character of their recent gains, not
even the continuing depths of their daily oppression—but the com—
pellin g magniﬁcence of their united struggle is the most distinguishing
and socially signiﬁcant factor in the lives of 17 million American
Negro people.

The Southern ruling class responds with frenzied violence to the
Negro people’s insistent demands, the mass assertion of their just, hu-
man and constitutional rights. The struggle reaches a climactic phase.

Over a hundred ministers among the Negro people’s leaders have
been arrested. More than a score of churches and homes of leaders
have been bombed. Women have been shot on buses. Homes and cars
have been ﬁred into. The racists have spilled the blood of the protesting
victims of ]im—Crow tyranny.

But the army of Negro freedom ﬁghters stands ﬁrm. Each day
new recruits join the ranks, new fronts of struggle are opened.

The massive movement and heroic struggles of the Negro people
are daily etching into the consciousness of millions a new sense of
the enormous import which an oppressed people’s ﬁght for equality
lends to the general cause of social progress in the nation.

    

 

 

 

294 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

Millions, hitherto indifferent, now begin to realize that the tre-
mendous economic, political and social potential of our country can
never be achieved so long as any barrier to Negro equality remains
standing. Millions begin to see that the particular needs of all prog-
ressive social strata of the population are served by this urgent struggle
of the Negro people. They begin to grasp the social truism that what
is good for the Negro people is good for every progressive sector of
white Americans——both for the fulﬁllment of their immediate needs
and the accomplishment of their long-term aspirations.

The Negro people’s leaders, therefore, serve the nation’s best in-
terests no less than their people’s dire needs when they issue a call to
action to all who honor our nation’s democratic heritage, to all who
aspire to a nobler future for our common country.

Now is the time for all progressive Americans to add the full
force of their power to the great lever for democracy forged by the
brave struggles of Southern Negroes. Now is the time for all be-
lievers in democracy—by strengthening and heightening even further
the great Negro people’s oﬂensive against hidebound reaction—to
raise to new heights the whole plane of democratic opportunity for all
to struggle for social progress in our country.

More than this, the Negro people’s struggle is an increasingly po-
tent factor in the world-embracing battle for democratic rights in
subject lands, for freedom from colonial domination, for peaceful
relations among nations. The protestor against bus segregation in
Montgomery and Tallahassee draws inspiration and precept from the
colonial revolts of the East and the independence stirrings in Africa.
He sees himself debased by the same shibboleths of white supremacy,
the same imperialist arrogance and violence which would deny to
Egyptians sovereignty over the Suez Canal and to Nigerians control
of their rich and ancient land.

He knows, and the world knows, that the monopolists’ protesta-
tions of democracy are rendered a hollow mockery by the persistence
of Dixiecrat rule of the South and dominance in the federal Congress.

The question of Negro freedom, then, is the crucial domestic issue
of the day, and a factor of growing international consequence.

The circumstances of their common oppression and the unani-
mous demand for equality of rights and status as American citizens
are the ties that bind together all strata of the Negro population. The

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 295

steadily growing unity of the Negro people is manifested in the con-
tinuing growth of their mass organizations and institutions, in the
singularity of their basic demands, in the militancy of their advocacy
and action for equal rights, in the developing coordination and colla-
borationtbetween the respective organizations which constitute the
Negro People's Movement.

This new strength of organization not only provides for the greater
mobilization and exercise of the ﬁghting power of Negro Americans
to effect change; it also establishes the basis for more formal and
equitable alliance relations with organized labor and other progressive
organized formations of the general population.

The struggles of the Negro people and the resultant signiﬁcant
advance inspired Negro Americans with a new quality of self-conﬁ-
dence. A profound spirit of national consciousness and pride in their
racial identification permeates the Negro people of the U.S. today.
It ﬁres their determination to build ever closer their unity in order
to wage the struggle even more militantly to break down all barriers
to their exercise of any and all political, economic and social rights
enjoyed by any other citizens.

Negroes unite not in order to separate themselves from the politi-
cal, economic or social life of our country. They unite to more effec-
tively employ the strength of their own numbers and the weight of
their alliance with other parts of the population to‘ level all barrzers
to their fullest integration into all aspects of the economic, political and
social life of the American people as a whole. They are forging an
internal national unity to facilitate their struggle for full integra-
tion as free and equal American citizens.

The Negro people’s movement is today’s standard bearer in the
struggle to open up the now—restricted areas of democracy. It is the
decisive strategic ally of the working class in the current struggles for
liberty and livelihood and in all stages that lead to the subsequent
achievement of the necessary fundamental transformation of Ameri-
can society from the present capitalist exploitative system to that of
socialism. Now to cement the Negro—Labor alliance, through power-
ful mass struggles for Negro rights, is to lay the cornerstone for that
broad anti-monopoly coalition of labor and people's forces on which
the progressive future of our country depends.

Against the background of this estimate of the Negro people and

their liberation movement, what are the special tasks and responsi-
bilities of Communists? First and foremost, it is the obligation of the
vanguard Party of the American working class to lend every support
to the Negro people’s struggle. This. is the main uncompleted demo-
cratic task of our country; and its fulﬁllment will enormously ad-
aance the goals of the working class and our entire nation.

Communists are also called upon to make their maximum inde—
pendent contribution towards winning the just demands of the Negro
people.

It has for three decades been the honorable task of Communists
to set a high standard of devotion to and energetic leadership in the
ﬁght for Negro rights. Recognizing the special national character
of this question, we have raised our voices among’ the workers when
others stood mute. We have stirred masses to battle against the bar-
barities of ]im Crow while others chose simply to deplore injustice from
the sidelines. We have in the past often been the pace—setters when
others lagged behind.

This vanguard role of the Communists in the ﬁght for Negro
freedom has been correctly based on a fundamental concept of Marx-
ist-Leninist social science: that the working class can achieve its class
aims only by wiping out the divisions and the inequities created and
fostered among the workers by the ']im-Crow system of the ruling
class. On this basis the Party can and must play a decisive role in forg-
ing an unbreakable link between the Negro people’s movement and
the organized labor movement.

In a real sense the Communist Party, with its insistence on full
political, economic and social equality for the Negro people, with
the example of Negro—white solidarity achieved within its own ranks,
has served as an indispensable forerunner of today’s tremendous
struggles for freedom.

As the advance guard of the American working class, the Com-
munist Party must continue to make its contributions to the ﬁght
for Negro rights, under the changed conditions of today, as eﬁ'ec-
tively, as honorably, as it did in previous periods of struggle. The
ﬁght for Negro rights needs the contribution which Communists,
guided by Marxist-Leninist theory, are in a position to make.

It is essential, therefore, that we thoroughly appraise our policies
and tactics, our internal functioning and our external relations to the

cause of Negro freedom. In this connection, we must assure the
early completion of the study and reassessment now under way of our
previously asserted theoretical position on this question.

The primary weakness of our Party on the front of struggle for
Negro rights during the past decade has been our relative isolation
from the struggle. This has been partly due to the political attacks
against the Party and the McCarthyite anti-Communist poison pumped
into the bloodstream of the workers’ movements.

It has also been due, however, to our own errors. The Party’s
work for Negro freedom has been hampered by doctrinaire con-
cepts, hangovers from past periods, which have resulted in outmoded
practices and a sectarian method and style of work. These sectarian
practices have resulted from a failure to fully grasp the signiﬁcance
of the new forces, the new level of struggle and the new possibili-
ties for victory that have become apparent in the Negro people’s
movement in the course of the past decade.

Another weakness has been that many comrades, Negro and
white, have responded to the failures which accompany both sec-
tarian and opportunist practices by recoiling from any signiﬁcant par-
ticipation in the Negro people’s struggle, by deprecating any project
which assigns to Communists a leading role in the struggle—by
abstentionism. A prevalent form of this abstentionism is a lack
of initiative and imaginative action in moving broad white masses
to act.

A third reason for the isolation of the Party in this ﬁeld of work
has been the failure to establish and sustain new norms of Negro-
white unity——norms which must reflect and correspond to the new
level of the demands for full, not conditional, equality being advanced
by the Negro liberation movement itself. These new norms must have
their reflection in a higher standard of inner-party Negro-white unity.

Over the past few years, there have accumulated innumerable
problems of personnel in the ﬁeld of Negro work: an unsatisfactory
deployment of Negro personnel in leading positions on a national
and district scale; strong manifestations of bureaucratic methods
in dealing with problems of Negro work and inner-party relationships
between Negro and white; the failure to reﬂect in our Party the
leading role played by Negro women in the Negro people’s move-
ment; in some cases a pronounced tendency to give insuﬂicient at-

 

 

 

 

 

298 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

tention to the repeatedly-expressed views of Negro personnel; and a
serious loss of Negro membership.

The improvement of the level of the Party’s ﬁght for Negro rights
and the enhancing of the quality of Negro—white unity within the
Party require the maximum participation of and consultation with
Negro comrades at all levels of Party work in the formulation of
policy and the disposition of personnel. Special measures must be taken
and guarantees provided to ensure such participation.

It should always be borne in mind that the improvement of the
Party’s work in the struggle for Negro rights will have vitality and
will succeed to the degree that it meets the needs of the Negro people
and wins the support of the Negro membership in the first place,
and of the membership as a whole.

A further factor tending to explain our weaknesses in the struggle
for Negro rights has been the recent failure to sustain a continuous
and effective ideological campaign against racism, against every mani-
festation of white supremacy thinking and big nation chauvinism.
It has been and remains the duty of Communists to patiently and
persistently point out to the workers that anti-Negro racism is the
ideology of the ruling class, that its purpose and effect is to wring
super-proﬁts out of the sweat of the doubly—exploited Negro workers
and to frustrate the demands of the trade unions and all workers for
a greater share of their production. It has been and remains our
duty to point out, without ceasing, that the racist denial of political
and social rights to the Negro people of the South is the shield be-
hind which the Dixiecrat-minded capitalists restrict the exercise of
democratic rights by all Southerners and foist the reactionary rule of
monopoly on the country as a whole.

Particularly in light of the upsurge for colonial independence in
the East, in light of the historic achievements of the Chinese Peo-
ple’s Republic, the emergence of India as a potent world factor, the
straining of the whole African continent against centuries-old shackles,
it is our responsibility to convince all sections of the American masses
that the cause of Negro freedom serves the cause of world peace.

Solid bonds of unity between Negro and white Communists and
progressives can be realized and sustained when white Communists

tions of racial prejudice. When white Communists fail to join the
struggle for Negro Americans to share in and enjoy all the rights
and opportunities which they are privileged to exercise——be it in mat-
ters of employment and promotion rights, housing, cultural or recrea-
tional pursuits, of the simple amenities and courtesies of everyday
relationships—then the Party forfeits its stellar role in the freedom
struggle of the Negro people, the bonds of unity dissolve, suspi-
cions and antagonisms replace mutual conﬁdence and Party unity
deteriorates.

The exploiters of the Negro people and the working class thrive
upon and incessontly propagate white supremacist ideas among the
popular masses; and we must equip all our members to recognize
and combat this divisive ideology. To neglect or weaken the ﬁght
against white supremacy ideas or practices within the mass move-
ment or "their inﬂuences without our own ranks would constitute
abandonment of principle, destruction of the foundation for Negro—
white unity and the lowering of the Party's proud banner of equality
and comradeship.

All Communists, and all progressive Americans, are called upon
to marshal their maximum strength to enhance the liberation move-
ment of the Negro people. This requires:

1. Full participation in and support of the all-sided anti-:egrega-
tion movement in the South. This is a battle to remove a festering,
unsightly sore from the national body politic; to free the Negro people
of the unequal opportunity and the social degradation heaped upon
them by a system which renders them outcasts; to enforce the Con-
stitution of the United States as interpreted by the Supreme Court.
A popular and irresistible demand must arise for Congressional ac-
tion to end ﬁlibustering and pass civil rights legislation, for effective
federal executive intervention to stay the murderous hands of the
Southern racists, to enforce integration in all aspects of public life, in
all Southern states, now.

2. The strengthening and broadening of the battle for the unfet-
tered right of suﬁrage for all Southerners. The right to vote and to be
voted for must not be restricted by race or property. Poll taxes, which
persist in ﬁve Southern states, must be abolished. Discriminatory
registration practices, aimed at disfranchising Negroes and white work-
ing people, must be ended. Intimidation and terror, still the customary

 

300 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

accompaniment of elections in Southern states, must cease to bar the
way to the ballot box. This struggle for democratic elections in the
South must be buttressed by intensive campaigns to increase Negro
representation on all levels of government, both North and South.

3. An intensiﬁed struggle for equal employment and upgrading
practices in all industries, everywhere in the nation. The trade-union
movement will be greatly strengthened to the degree that it insists on
the slogan long inscribed on its banners: equal pay for equal work.
Apprenticeship training must be opened up to Negro youth on an equal
basis with young white workers The strengthening of the activities of
the anti—discrimination committees of the AFL—CIO, and of interna-
tional and local unions, should continue to be regarded as a matter of
urgent concern for the labor movement. Special attention should be
given to advancing Negro participation in the leadership of the
trade-union movement at all levels. The American labor movement
must be helped to understand that racism and unionism are funda-
mentally incompatible.

4. The unfolding olf major campaigns to break down segregation
in housing. Hemmed into the dilapidated tenements and ramshackle
dwellings of our urban ghettos, the Negro masses are made the prey
of merciless rent-gougers. They are thrice robbed by higher prices
for inferior commodities and services in the stores of the Jim-Crow
communities. Housing segregation is another barrier to the unity of

" Negro and White workers. Public funds spent for housing develop-

ments, whether public or private, should be administered so as to com-
bat Jim-Crow practices and make housing available to all who need it.
Communists and progressives are called upon to lead the ﬁght for
integrated housing in the communities, neighborhood and multiple-
dwelling units in which they themselves live.""

 

* The uestion of decent, desegregated housing is one of_ the most ur in life-and-death
needs of the egro people the country_ over and in Northern cities particular y. Within Negro
communities there is an almost unbelievable degree of overcrowding, accompanied by untold
human misery, disease and death from ﬁres. _ _

During the last census decade, 19fi0~5.0, overcrowding of Negroes increased 11 per cent.
Of the nine million new dwellings built since 1953, _less than 1 per cent went to non-whites.
who are more than 10 per cent of the total population. In New York's Harlem _alon_e there
occur 2,500 rat bite cases a year. The pressure of a steady How of Southern migration _has
made this an irrepressible focal point of the sharpest stru gle. _Forced into sub-standard dwellings
and paying "luxury apartment’ rents, and prevented y Jim-Crow and mob violence from
moving from the conﬁnes of segregated areas, the Negro people demand solution of this
problem now. _ _ _ , _ .

Jim-Crow in housing exists primarily because it is proﬁtable to a host of parasites who
make money directly out the existence of the ghetto. This includes the rent-gouging land-
lords, real estate sharks, merch:-ints and others who rob the Negro at every turn.

But the vultures are not the cause of the corpse. Nor are the greedy landlords and blood-
sucking loan sharks the cause of the Negro slum. The real cause is segregation itself, and no

, 5. Action for desegregation of public schools. In the South this
. requires support of the program of the National Association for the
, Advancement of Colored People and other organizations of the
; Negro people to accomplish desegregation of the schools in accordance
; with the mandates of the federal courts. It will require, in some
instances, federal protection of the lives and limbs of Negro students
of “desegregated” schools. In Northern communities the ﬁght against
school segregation, which is still widely maintained, involves primarily
the struggle to re—district school lines on an integrated basis. Funda-
mental to a correction of this discriminatory practice is the ﬁght to end
Iim-Crow housing.

6. Intensifying the ideological struggle against racism. Since the
Supreme Court decision of May 17, 1954, the country has been ﬂooded
with an ocean of racist literature, and television, radio and news-
». papershave been used in the South to saturate the minds of white
masses with the false doctrine of white supremacy. The task of
propagating the truth of the equality of all peoples, the necessity of
convincing the white workers and the democratic masses generally
that equal rights for the Negro people is a matter of their own self
interest, is more urgent than ever before.

All of the class strata in Negro life have a stake in the goals of

There is good reason for the special hostility to integration in housing. For segregated
housing is fundamental to the whole system of Jim-Crow in the North. It is this which er-
petuates segregation in the schools, almost _as eﬂectively as if it were done by law, as wel as
segregation in recreational and other facilities: The existence of the ghetto slums also serves as

302 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

and are represented in the Negro people’s movement for democratic
rights and equality. Nevertheless, the Negro people are, in class com-
position, essentially a working people. The preponderant member-
ship of the Negro people’s mass movement organizations is of the
Working class and toiling farmers.

This working-class component, working side by side with white
workers in shop, mine and mill, sharing in the activities of the com-
mon unions of all workers, is the guarantee that the bonds of fraternity
will be strengthened between the liberation movement and the work-
ing class. Its preponderant strength in the Negro people’s movement
for freedom enhances the prospects for the development of this move-
ment in conformity with the aims and interests of labor. This is the

 

major factor which gives substance to the outlook and the program-

for complete integration which characterizes the Negro liberation
movement today.

Similarly, because of its experience and discipline in the struggles‘

of the American labor movement, the working—class component of
the Negro freedom movement will of necessity leave its imprint of
militancy and united mass action on that movement. It may be ex-
pected increasingly to inﬂuence program and tactics of the Negro
liberation movement, and more and more to contribute outstanding
personalities to its leadership. Our Party must base itself on this work-
ing-class strata of the Negro people.

The tacticsand modes of struggle of the Negro people’s liberation
movement are decisively determined by the relationship of class and
national forces in the nation as a whole and in the South in particular.
They are also inﬂuenced and shaped by the objective class relations
within the Negro people’s movement and the common social and
cultural life of the entire Negro people. Those forms of struggle
which prevail at a given moment are likely to be those most congenial,
familiar and acceptable to the Negro people themselves. Their tactics
of struggle correspond to the realities of the circumstances and condi-
tions within which the struggle unfolds. '

It is therefore not the task of Communists or any other group to
impose upon the Negro people new forms of struggle, tactics alien to
their historic development as a people. Rather it is the task of all
supporters of the Negro liberation movement, including the Commu-
nists, to lend their unreserved support to, and to take an active part

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 303

in those programs and techniques of struggle which now embrace and
propel into action the great majority of the Negro people.

The great labor movement of our country and all democratic forces
in American life are called upon to recognize in the struggle for Negro
rights the decisive task before the country today. The Communist
Party sees in this struggle the number one challenge to action for all
Communists. It is the portal to new advances in all spheres in the ﬁg/it
for social progress.

Without the enfranchisement of the Negro masses in the South
the road to an anti-monopoly people’s government will remain blocked
by the Dixiecrat reactionaries who dominate Congressional commit-
tees by virtue of the disfranchisement of Southern masses.

The organization of the unorganized Negro workers in common
unions with their white brothers in the South is the surest security
against the runaway shop and the prerequisite for labor’s further ad-
vance 'on the economic front of struggle to raise the living standards
of all who work.

The plantation system, which still holds some 5 million white and
Negro farm workers under barbarous conditions of exploitation and
oppression, must be eradicated. In the mounting struggle for the
democratic reconstruction of the South, there must be special efforts
to win governmental measures to secure land and land tenure for
Negro croppers, tenants and small owners, and to provide cheap
credit and capital goods for agricultural cooperatives.

Equality and full integration in the economic life of the country
would force the monopolies to disgorge the $25 billion in super—proﬁts
which they now rob from the Negro people’s just share of the gross
national product and add to their mountainous store of privately—
owned public wealth. The restoration of this $25 billion to the Negro
people must be regarded as a vital element in any sound anti—depres—
sion program in our country.

Success in the struggle for Negro freedom will add moral tone
to the national democratic spirit. It will radically advance the progres-
sive potential of the American people in determining their domestic
affairs and inﬂuencing the international relations of our country in
the service of democratic and peaceful relations among nations.

Much as the destruction of slavery in the South became imperative
for the forward movement of our nation a century ago, so the destruc-

 

304 PROCEEDINGS OF r6TI-I CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

tion of the ]irn—Crow system centering in the South has become neces-
sary for the democratic progress of our country today. Now, as in the
I85o’s, ever larger sections of the American people—foremost among
which is the organized labor movement--can be won as powerful
allies in the struggle for Negro rights. 1

The Communist Party of the United States pledges itself to the
accomplishment of this task.

V. THE AMERICAN ROAD TO SOCIALISM

The people’s anti—monopoly coalition would have as its central
aim the improvement of the conditions of the American people and the
defense and extension of their democratic rights. Its success in electing
a people’s anti—monopoly government would open the way to a vast
and unprecedented expansion of democracy. Such a government could
curb the repressive economic and political powers of the monopolies and
deprive them of the ability to promote violence to frustrate the will
of the people. Under such conditions, whenever the majority of the
American people become convinced of the necessity of a socialist reor-
ganization of society, they would be able to advance to their goal along
peaceful and constitutional lines.

, Ever since the rise of the struggle against fascism and the fascist
danger in the ’3o’s, our Party has been elaborating such a program for
a peaceful and constitutional transition to socialism. In 1938, the 10th
Party Convention adopted the first written constitution of the Com-
munist Party. It expressly stated that any advocate of force and violence
would be excluded from the Party.

In the succeeding years many additional steps were taken. The
leading spokesmen of the Party, Chairman Foster and General Secre—
tary Dennis, expressed this position of the Party in 1947-48 in articles,
statements and interviews with such leading newspapers as the New
York Time: and Herald—Tribune. A high point in the presentation
of this question was Comrade Foster’s deposition, “In Defense of the
Communist Party and Its Indicted Leaders,” at the first Smith Act
trial in 1949. This statement of policy was endorsed by the National

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 305

Committee of the Party. It was expressed in the Party Program, “The
American Way,” adopted in 1954. Comrades Dennis and Gates at the
first meeting they addressed after their release from jail, at Carnegie
Hall, January 20, 1956, reiterated our Party’s advocacy of a peaceful and
constitutional road to socialism in our country. A

Some have challenged this view on .he ground that the capitalist.
class of the U.S. is strong and the forces of repression at its disposal are
powerful. They point to the character and sharpness of the class and
people’s struggle in the past and today. These points are unquestioned.
The trusts will continue to try to promote demagogy, division and
force and violence to halt social progress and democratic advance.

Titanic economic and political struggles will intervene in our
country before the majority of the people take the path to socialism.
In the course of and as a consequence of such struggles of the working
class, the Negro people and others, the power of the monopolies could
by drastically curbed through the election of an anti—monopoly gov-
ernment. There would be a new strength, a new class consciousness
and political maturity within the labor and people’s movements which
would also be reflected in the strength of the party or parties of
socialism. ’

That is why we state that the possibility exists for the peaceful
and constitutional transition to socialism. This transition will become
possible when the majority of the American people so decide in the
course of their struggles against the monopolies. Only the American
people will make that decision.

This concept of our advocacy of, and endeavor to, chart a peaceful,
democratic and constitutional road to socialism in America expresses
What we Communists strive for. It is a further development of our
established position. It embodies our basic view that socialism can be
established only through a radical and fundamental extension of
American democracy and a revolutionary transformation of all prop-
erty relations. It emphasizes that all roads to socialism are roads of
mass struggle, waged under the leadership of the working class and its
Marxist vanguard. But now this concept takes on a new meaning in
light of the profoundly new and favorable changes in our own country
and in world relationships.

The history of our country, the struggles of our people to fulﬁll
the Bill of Rights, their attachment to the Constitution all point to the

 

 

306 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

further conclusion that socialism in the U.S. will provide full civil
liberties to all, including the right to dissent, and, as long as the people
so desire, a multi—party system. This is not an academic question for
our Party. This stand by our Party on civil liberties under socialism is
of value in clarifying our perspective of socialism and also assists in
strengthening the unity of the democratic forces of our land for com-
mon action today.

Socialism in America will be the realization of the dream of eco-
nomic independence and political freedom, of “life, liberty and the pur-
suit of happiness” under the conditions of today, in the age of atomic
energy and automation. It will carry forward the best traditions of
Jefferson, Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, and of the great American
pioneer labor and socialist leaders, William Sylvis and Gene Debs.

Socialism is no more un—American than is capitalism particularly
American. Capitalism and socialism are social systems growing out of
the evolution of society and its struggle toward greater progress. Capi-
talism in the U.S., because of the peculiar features and historical condi-
tions of its development, has brought a relatively high standard of liv-
ing to a large number of people. But it also has brought economic crisis,
wars, colonial exploitation and oppression, unemployment, insecurity,
crime, socal degradation and discrimination. The people had to ﬁght
for their standard of living and for their democratic liberties against
the forces of privilege and reaction at every stage in the history of our
country. They fought for independence, for the Bill of Rights, for the
right to vote, for the right to education, for the abolition of slavery, for

‘ the rights of Women, for the abolition of child labor, for the right to

build unions, for social insurance. And to this day the Negro people
are denied equal rights, are discriminated against, and are doubly ex-
ploited.

Today socialism, embracing a third of the world’s people, has
grown to a world system. In the coming period the superiority of so-
cialism over capitalism will become ever more apparent to all peoples.

Socialism in the U.S. from the beginning will be able to provide all
our people with the highest standard of living, the fullest economic
security. For ours is the most technically advanced country in the
world. Our resources, our skills, our technology, our organizing capa-
city and experience, our workers, scientists, will assure a rapidly in-
creasing standard of living for all. Socialism in our country will bring

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 307

not only the fullest satisfaction of our material needs but also the fullest
democratic liberty and cultural satisfaction.

The Communist Party from its inception has been the party of
socialism. Because of this it has brought strength and understanding
much greater than its numbers to the struggles in which it fought as
part of the American working people. But our Party never fully mas-
tered the task of successfully combining the immediate struggle and
socialist education. In the early period policies and slogans were put
forward as if socialism were around the corner. Later on, when the
Party, making a more sober and realistic analysis of the situation,
came to the conclusion that socialism was not on the immediate order
of the day in the U.S., educational work for socialism was neglected.

This resulted from our narrow and sectarian conception of social-
ism, of what it would be like in the U.S. and of how it would be
achieved. We failed to see in the many struggles for greater economic
security, in the strong anti—m0nopoly tendencies, the basis for reach-
ing the people with fundamental discussions of issues and for pro-
moting socialist education among them.

But the enemies of socialism have never ceased their attacks and
are today carrying on widespread propaganda not only against the
socialist lands and against the Communist Party of the United States,
but also against the ideas of socialism.

This should make clear that the Communist Party cannot limit
itself to a mere declaration that socialism is not on the immediate order
of the day in our land. This is undoubtedly true. But socialism is
nonetheless an issue: socialism in the Soviet Union and other socialist
countries, and most of all, what socialism would be like in the U.S.
and how the Communist Party hopes the American people will
achieve socialism.

The historic conditions deriving from the First World War, the
Russian Revolution, and the split in the socialist movement have now
given way to new conditions. The emergence of socialism from the
limits of one country to a world system embracing several states and
one—third of mankind was described by the 20th Congress of the Com-
munist Party of the Soviet Union as “the chief feature of the present
era.”

These conditions make possible a great new trend towards unity
among socialist—minded people which has already begun to be felt not

 

 

 

308 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

only abroad but in our own country. The new features of independence
and mutual criticism in the relationships among Communist Parties
also tend to remove barriers between Communists and other supporters
of socialism.

For some months our Party has had under consideration the
question presented in Eugene Dennis’ report to the National Com-
mittee meeting last April, of our attitude towards the perspective of
a united party of socialism in this country.

The new developments point to a certain revitalization and
growth of socialist—oriented and pro—Marxist currents and groupings.
In the past we tended to assume that all that was worth while in other
socialist currents and groupings would inevitably flow into our own
organization. This assumption was always incorrect and should be
replaced by serious and painstaking eﬁorts to assist in the eventual
development of the broadest possible unity of all socialist—minded
elements.

The perspective of an eventual united socialist movement or party
must be viewed as the climax of a series of struggles and develop—
ments. It is not a quick and easy solution to the common problems
of all socialist groupings, or to the speciﬁc problems of our own Party.
Such an approach would both weaken our Party and distort this per-
spective. Least of all could this objective be advanced by any ten-
dency to weaken or dissolve the Communist Party. On the contrary,

.it is essential that the Communist Party strengthen in every way

its organization, mass work and inﬂuence.

The prospect we hold forth for our Party likewise requires a re-
invigoration of the Marxist press. A prerequisite for an effective hearing
for Marxist ideas and for making their inﬂuence felt in respect to the
course of our country’s development is that we spare no effort in
helping to ﬁnance and solve the distribution problems of The Wor/(er
and the Daily Worker. Stabilizing the ﬁnancial base of the Marxist
press and building its circulation will establish the practical founda-

It lies along the path of extending the process of frank exchange
and discussion that has been taking place during the past year and
ensuring that our Party at all levels increasingly participates in this
process.

It would be wrong to identify the extent of socialist traditions
and thinking with the low level of socialist organization today.
Among the trade unions, in the building of which Socialists and
Communists played a major role, among the Negro people, the work-
ing farmers, the professionals and the youth who are pondering the
signiﬁcance of the growth of the socialist world system, as well as
among the many thousands who at one time were members of our
Party or who participated in mass struggles under our leadership, are
to be found many who would welcome the perspective of a united
party of socialism. The National Committee should be charged with
fostering this perspective. _

The historic objective of achieving unity of all honest socialist-
minded forces to develop the American people’s anti—monopoly coali-
tion, as well as for the ultimate achievement of socialism, throws an
added light on our re-appraisal of our Party’s past and present func-
tioning, its mass activity and its vast role in the period ahead.

VI. OUR PARTY

The Communist Party made a vital contribution to the welfare
of our country since the end of World War II by its unﬂinching ﬁght
for peace, against the danger of fascism, for the civil rights of the
Negro people, and for the economic needs of the working people. It
continues to do so.

Communists fought consistently through the years of the cold
war to help bring about the present improved political situation. In
so doing, they served the best national interests of our country with
patriotic selflessness.

At its Emergency Convention in 1945, the Communist Party

Party alerted the American people to the emergence of a serious
danger of a new world war. It exposed and combatted every policy
and action which jeopardized or broke the peace; the notorious “get
tough with Russia” policy; the war—inciting Fulton, Missouri, speech
of Winston Churchill; the Truman doctrine of “containment,” atom-
bomb diplomacy and military intervention in China and Greece; the
Marshall Plan; the “positions of strength” policy embodied in the
Atlantic Pact, NATO, SEATO and other military alliances, as Well
as the building of military bases all over the world. The Communist
Party fought consistently under diﬂicult conditions for a negotiated
peace to end the Korean War. It vigorously combatted the Big Lie of
an alleged threat of Soviet aggression. It called for the negotiation of
diﬁerences between the Big Powers, the end of the cold war and its
replacement by a policy of peaceful coexistence between our country
and the Soviet Union.

Our Party’s Achievements

During this period the Communist Party took the lead in com-
batting a host of repressive measures and policies designed to silence
those ﬁghting for peace and to intimidate the American people into
acceptance of unpopular military adventures. It exposed and fought
against the Sehwellenbach proposal for outlawing the Communist
Party, the Mundt-Nixon Bill, the McCarran Act, the Taft—Hartley

.Act, the Attorney General’s “subversive list,” the thought-control

“loyalty” order and civil service witch-hunts, the persecution by Con-
gressional committees, the Smith Act prosecutions, the McCarthyite
inquisition and the “atom—spy” hoax which resulted in the frame-up
and execution of Iulius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well as the imprison-
ment of Morton Sobell. The Party exposed and fought against re-
pressive measures and policies adopted in many states.

Throughout this period the Communist Party actively supported
labor’s struggles for improved economic and working conditions, par-
ticularly during the big strikes of the miners, the railway, packing-
house, steel, auto, electrical and farm equipment workers. Commun-
ists championed labor’s united action in defense of its hard won gains.

 

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 311

They contributed to labor’s growing appreciation of its unique and
decisive role in the life of the nation. They helped labor gain a better
understanding of its relation to the struggle for Negro rights. They
urged closer working relationships between labor, and the farm
population. They fought for democratic, militant trade unionism and
against expulsions, raiding, secessions and the fragmentation of the
labor movement. They popularized independent political action as
the key to the future not only of the labor movement but of the en-
tire nation.

The Communist Party energetically championed the struggles of
the Negro people for full economic, social and political equality. It
made notable contributions in defending Willie McGee, the Martins-
ville Seven, the Trenton Six, Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram and Wesley
Wells; in combatting segregated housing in Stuyvesant Town, Levit-
town, and Parkchester in New York, in Park Manor, Peoria Street
and Trumbull Park in Illinois, and in many other communities
throughout the nation; in popularizing the battle for Negro repre-
sentation in all elective and appointive government bodies; in pro-
moting the struggle for inclusion of model FEPC clauses in union
contracts; in ﬁghting for election and appointment of Negro leaders
to top positions in the lily-white leadership of many unions. These
and similar activities of the Communist Party contributed substan-
tially to the emergence of the current broad movement for civil
rights.

The struggles waged by the Communist Party in the past decade
constitute a notable chapter in the history of the American working
class. As the tide continues to turn against McCarthyism and the cold
war, sweeping away the frenzied insanity of a decade of red—baiting,
lies and distortions, the justice and courage of the Communist Party’s
struggle will be increasingly vindicated in the eyes of all Americans
who have the real welfare of our country at heart. Every member and
friend of the Communist Party has reason to be proud of the contribu-
tions made to the great task of helping save America from the catas-
trophe of war and fascism.

The Communist Party and its supporters have reason to be proud
of the staunchness with which they met the wave of persecution
against them. Nonetheless, this persecution was not without effect. It
took the form of an expanding pattern of repression including: Taft-

 

 

 

3I2 ‘ PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

Hartley Act aﬂidavits and perjury prosecutions; Smith Act arrests,
trials, convictions and jail sentences; Congressional committee inquisi-
tions and contempt citations; the screening of whole industries and
the entire civil service; ﬁrings from jobs, hounding from professions,
establishment of industry-wide blacklists; McCarran Act persecutions;
widespread deportations of foreign-born; deprivation of legal rights to
halls, radio time, advertising space, etc. All this put the Communist
Party in a position of de facto illegality.

Furthermore, the attacks on the Party occurred at a time when
the overall economic situation, with the exception of the chronic post-
war agricultural crisis, was characterized by high levels of employ-
ment and increased total earnings by workers’ families. This situation
gave rise to two trends in the ranks of the working class. On the one
hand, the absence of an army of unemployed who might be used as a
club against them encouraged the workers to ﬁght militantly through
this period for wage increases and important fringe beneﬁts. This is
a positive feature of the postwar decade. On the other hand, the
growth of class consciousness was inhibited by the spreading of Key-
nesian theories in the labor movement to the eﬂect that capitalism
could permanently solve the problem of “boom or bust” through a
“managed economy” with built—in stabilizers. This helped erode the
class consciousness of many labor leaders who in past years considered
themselves adherents of socialism, but who today have abandoned
their socialist convictions. In this situation, the capacity of the labor
movement to understand the signiﬁcance of the attack on the Com-
munists was also weakened and its defense of the rights of Commun-
ists was relatively limited.

The attack unleashed against the Communist Party was designed
to destroy it. In this, it did not succeed. It did succeed in weakening
and isolating the Party. It is necessary for all members of the Com-
munist Party to face up soberly to the fact that in this period the Party
suffered heavy organizational losses, declined in political influence in
many areas of work, became dangerously isolated from important sec-
tors of the labor and people's movement, is confronted with the grave
jeopardizing of the Marxist press, and that in general the Party is
faced with a serious crisis of a political, ideological, and organizational
nature.

Was it inevitable that the Party should become so severely iso-

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 3:3

lated and suﬁer such organizational and political losses as it did? The
answer must be NO. Against the background of the objective situa-
tion and its consequences, the errors and long—standing weaknesses of
our Party had a particularly damaging effect.

Errors and Weaknesses of the Party

The most important of these errors include:

A. I n the Fight for Peace. The Party's estimate that Wall Street’s
drive for world domination created a serious danger of a new world
war was correct. With this analysis our Party made a signiﬁcant con-
tribution to the mobilization of American and world pcace forces. At
the same time some serious sectarian mistakes were made in analyzing
important phases of the struggle between the forces of peace and war.
While we repeatedly asserted that World War III was not inevitable,
we tended to weaken this correct estimate by declaring that each new
defeat for American imperialism increased its desperation and, hence,
increased the danger of war. This was coupled with an analysis that
the only major difference in the ranks of monopoly capital was be-
tween those who want war now and those who want war later.

This overlooked the fact that Wall Street’s ability to achieve its
predatory aims was diminishing and that the setbacks to the imperial-
ist drive sharpened all differences within the ranks of monopoly
capital as well as between the imperialists of various countries. It
overlooked the fact that the overall situation of American imperialism
still gave it room to maneuver short of world war rather than reduc-
ing it to desperate alternatives.

In effect, such estimates excluded the possibility of the peaceful
settlement of differences except through a major change in the relation
of class forces in the United States. They made it diﬂicult to convince
the Party membership and the masses of the possibility of achieving
under existing conditions a protracted period of peaceful coexistence.

Certainly, when Dulles three times took our country “to the
brink of war,” this represented on each occasion an acute sharpening
of the danger of wars which might have had global repercussions. But
Dulles’ inability to take our country over the brink revealed the
strength of the obstacles to war. It was precisely this strength that our
Party underestimated.

 

314 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION. C.P.U.S.A.

That is why, despite our statements regarding the profound
signiﬁcance of the armistice in Korea and the negotiated peace in
Indo—China, our Party did not draw full conclusions from the favor-
able changes in international relations which these events signalized.
Because of a narrow concept of the division of the world into two
camps we did not properly assess the growth of a neutralist bloc in the
world, especially the newly liberated colonial countries, as well as like
forces in our country. In fact, up to the very eve of the Geneva
Summit meeting there were strong tendencies to underestimate the
ability of the peace forces, within our country and internationally, to
compel the Eisenhower Administration to enter into peaceful nego-
tiations with the socialist world.

B. In the Fight Against the Fascist Danger. The Party correctly
assessed the connection between American imperialism’s aggressive
foreign policy and the host of reactionary and pro-fascist measures
which began to be promulgated, adopted or enforced in the late I94o’s.
These measures were designed to intimidate and suppress all opposi-
tion to the aggressive policies of Big Business. Contrary to opinions
prevalent in some circles that this development was a temporary post-
war aberration which would automatically subside in time, the Party
emphasized the potential fascist danger if it was not checked by the
active struggle of the American people.

However, the errors made by the Party in estimating various
phases of the struggle against the war danger also inﬂuenced its judg-

‘ ment of the fascist menace, particularly in relation to attempts to out-

law the Party. This took the form of overestimating the scope, level
and tempo of the process of fascization under way generally. Our
evaluation also tended to equate the attempted outlawing of the
Party with fascism.

This led to wrong organizational decisions in 1950, including
conscious efforts to reduce the size of the Party membership. While
this particular error was quickly recognized by the Districts and the
National Committee and corrective steps were taken, it nevertheless
resulted in serious damage to the Party organization.

Subsequently, in 1951, the National Committee statement on the
Vinson decision upholding the first Smith Act conviction of Com-
munist leaders estimated that we had entered a wholly “new situa-
tion”; in other words, that a qualitative change had taken place in the

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 315

process of the fascization of our country. This led to the introduction
of a system of leadership which virtually gave up the ﬁght for legal-
ity, tended to accept a status of illegality and abandoned many pos-
sibilities for the public functioning of the Party.

While it was essential to safeguard the Party and enable it to
function under the diﬂicult conditions it faced, and while numerous
Communists displayed great steadfastness in this task, nevertheless,
as a result of a sectarian approach to this effort, the Party needlessly
lost thousands of members. This facilitated the efforts of reaction
to isolate us from the masses who, naturally, could not understand
the Party’s course in the given situation.

Contributing to these left—sectarian errors were:

a) the failure to recognize that the ruling class was not so hard
pressed as to be unable to continue its established method of govern—
mental rule even as it sharply curtailed the Bill of Rights by launching
unprecedented attacks against the labor and people’s movements, and
in the first place, against the Communist Party;

b) underestimation of the strength of American democratic tra-
ditions among the people, their readiness to defend the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights, the latent power of the trade unions as a bul-
wark against fascisrn, the peculiarities of American governmental
structure, as well as the struggles between and within the two major
parties which act as impediments to the repressive drive of the most
reactionary circles. T

Nature of the Errors

In our struggle for a mass policy we base ourselves on the follow-
ing Marxist—Leninist propositions:

a) that both left-sectarianism and right—opportunism have ob-
jective roots in reality——in the system under which We live;

b) that the struggle must be conducted on both fronts, with the
main emphasis against that which threatens the Marxist line of our
Party at the given moment.

The most important mistakes made in the period under review
were left-sectarian in character. These left-sectarian mistakes in the
context of sharp attacks against the Party are the main reason for the
unprecedented degree to which it was possible for Big Business and
its political representatives to isolate the Party.

 

 

 

 

316 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

To end its isolation and expand its mass work, the main task of
the Party today is to overcome completely the influence of left—sec-
tarian estimates, policies and tactics in all ﬁelds of work.

In the process of carrying out the main task the Party must strug-
gle against existent right-opportunist tendencies, comhattin g them at
all times. This is especially necessary in view of the extremely sharp
turn which the Party is now making in many of its basic policies. The
necessary struggle against right—opportunist errors must he carried on
in such a way as not to weaken the main task.

This effort has been under way in the Party particularly since
the end of 1952. Following the results of the 1952 elections, the Na-
tional Committee began a serious struggle against left—sectarianism as
the main danger in our mass work. This found expression: in the

resolution on the results of the 1952 elections, which sharply criticized 4 ‘

the sectarian direction of the Party’s electoral tactics; in leading articles
in 1953, which outlined the path for a sharp break with sectarianism
in our mass work and for redirecting the Party toward the main-
stream of the labor movement; in overcoming hesitation on the pro-
jection of our position on peaceful transition and an American path to
socialism as initiated by Comrade Foster; in the opening of a con-
certed political struggle against sectarianism in many phases of our
Negro work, including the issuance of “The Common Program for
the South,” as well as publication of various articles; in the initiation

of new approaches to the Smith Act trials; in serious efforts to influ-

ence the Left-led unions to re—enter the mainstream of the labor move-
ment; in the Party Program adopted in 1954 which, despite certain
errors in estimate gave new and broad perspectives to the Party both
in its immediate work and long range outlook; in the gradual aban-
donment and ﬁnally complete liquidation of unnecessary and extreme
security measures.

However, this struggle was carried on in a piece—meal manner with
considerable inconsistency and vacillation because it met with strong
resistance in the Party. This resulted at times in conciliation with or
continuance of sectarian policies and practices. Moreover, the political
struggle against sectarianism was undermined and in fact contradicted
by continuation of the organizational policies which flowed from the
National Committee’s I951 decisions on the system of leadership.

Nevertheless, as a result of these beginnings of the battle against

sectarianism during 1953, 1954 and 1955 (taken together with favor-«
able changes in the political situation), some advances have already
been made in unfreezing relations with important center forces in the
trade unions, the Negro people’s organizations and the communities,
as well as in beginning to overcome the Party’s formerly extreme isola—»
tion in many fields. Basically we could not correct our past mistakes
as long as we had not yet recognized the sources of left—sectarianism.

While these errors were the property of the Party as a whole, a
major burden of responsibility must fall upon the leadership of our
Party, who were in the main responsible for the formulation of those
sectarian policies and estimates without the widest consultation of the
membership. On most occasions, the general membership did not have
an opportunity to express their opinion on these questions, so that
these policies reflected not the collective estimate of the entire Party, but
rather the thinking of the leadership itself. Had the leadership fully
understood the role the membership could have played, many of these
mistakes could have been avoided or corrected more quickly.

The April 1956 meeting of the National Committee inaugurated
a new phase in the struggle against sectarianism. The report of Com-
rade Dennis advanced the struggle against left-sectarianism by exam-
ining the b-asic estimates in which the sectarian tactical line of the
Party has been rooted. The report established that the main task of
the Party in the present period was to eliminate every vestige of left-
sectarianism in policies and activities.

The roots of these errors are not to be found in the events of the
past ten years alone.

The Marxist movement in our country has suffered historically
from dogmatic application of Marxist theory to the American scene.
The Communist Party inherited these weaknesses. Insuﬁicient devel-
opment of the independent theoretical work of our Party over the past
decades has contributed towards our doctrinaire acceptance and me-
chanical application of many theoretical propositions.

Our Party has also suffered from an oversimpliﬁed approach to
and an uncritical acceptance of many views of Marxists and Marxist
parties in other countries.

Bureaucratic methods of leadership, failure to develop inner—party
democracy and a frequent intolerant attitude to the people we worked
with have been in large measure responsible for our inability to correct

 

 

 

318l PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

mistakes in time as well as for much of our sectarianism. All these
factors are interrelated; each helped to reinforce the other.

To advance the struggle in the United States for peace, democracy,
civil rights and socialism, the Communist Party must further develop
its independent theoretical work. It must free itself from deeply in-
grained habits of dogmatism and doctrinairism which breed sectarian-
ism, and which in turn lend encouragement to right—opportunism.

In order to succeed in this, the Party must study thoroughly the
realities of American life today, the history and traditions of our work-
ing class and people, the special features of capitalist economy and
bourgeois democracy in our country, the distinctive features of the
American road to socialism.

In carrying out this central ideological task, we should hear in
mind our Party’s past errors in the direction of rez/isionism and guard
against any such tendencies in the present period. This must he done
in such a way as to reinforce the struggle to overcome the main ob-
stacle which is our deeply rooted dogmatism and doctrinairism, a
struggle which is still only in its initial stages.

Marxism—Leninism is a scientiﬁc analysis of the universal and
objective laws of social development. It is the generalization of the
experience of the working class of each country and of all lands, and
like all science, is an international product. The principles of scientiﬁc
socialism were ﬁrst put forward by Marx and Engels. They were fur-
ther developed in the imperialist era by Lenin. They were later en-
riched by contemporary Marxists in many countries. The Communist
Party bases its theory generally on the cultural heritage of mankind,
and particularly on the principles of scientiﬁc socialism developed by
Marx, Engels and Lenin. These principles the Communist Party of
the United States interprets, and applies, and strives to develop fur-
ther, in accordance with the requirements of the American class
struggle and democratic traditions. We must learn much better how
to extract from the rich body of this theory that which is universally
valid, combining it with the speciﬁc experiences of the American
working class in the struggle for socialism in the United States. In
doing this, the Party must distinguish better between those additions
to Marxist theory which are valid for all countries and those which
reﬂect exclusively certain unique features of one or another country.

Likewise, the Communist Party will have to be bolder in re—ex-

amining certain Marxist-Leninist theories which, while valid in a
past period, may have become outdated and rendered obsolete by new
historical developments. For entirely new and unprecedented prob-
lems are emerging today which were never treated by Marx, Engels
or Lenin. They arise from the new world situation and its impact on
all countries.

Already in response to these new developments, important new
elements have been introduced into the body of Marxist theory by
Marxists of many countries and other theoretical questions are still
under discussion. For example, we as well as other Marxist parties
have already discarded as obsolete the thesis that war is inevitable
under imperialism. We have also rejected as incorrect the concept of
inevitable violent proletarian revolution, recognizing the possibility in
our country of a peaceful, constitutional transition to socialism. We are
in full agreement to study further the question of our theoretical and
tactical approach to war, the theory of the state, dictatorship of the
proletariat and other questions that time does not afford an opportun-
ity to resolve at this national convention.

We must undertake to make our own independent contribution
to the further development and enrichment of the theory of scientiﬁc
socialism. Creative Marxism is impossible without ceaseless re—examin—
ation and reappraisal of theory in the light of ever—changing reality.

This Convention feels that it is incorrect to continue to function
without a comprehensive and basic written program. The program
adopted in 1954 is inadequate for that purpose. Such a program is
necessary in order to deﬁne clearly and unequivocally the viewpoint
of American Communists on all fundamental problems of the strug-
gle for socialism in the United States. The Convention instructs the
incoming National Committee to elect a program’ committee to begin
drafting such a document, which will be submitted to the member—
ship for general discussion.

The Communist Party——Independent Party of
American Workers

The Communist Party is an independent party of American
Workers dedicated to socialism. Its primary concern is for the present
and future welfare of the American people. Its only allegiance is to the

 

 

 

 

320 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

working class and people of our country. Its consistent objective is to
promote the national welfare and advance our country's true national
interests.

The Communist Party formulates its policies independently. It is
not subject to any external allegiance or discipline either of an organ-
izational or political character.

The Communist Party works for friendship between all peoples
so that our country may prosper in a World at peace. In this spirit
it advocates friendship and cooperation between our country and the
socialist countries. This has been one of its major contributions to the
national welfare.

The Soviet Union, People’s China and the People’s Democracies
of Eastern Europe are socialist countries. The system of capitalist
exploitation has been abolished in these countries and, together with
it,‘ the cause of poverty, fascism, war, national oppression and race
discrimination. From the beginning the Communist Party has greeted
and supported the efforts of the Working people of these countries to
build a new life for themselves on socialist foundations.

Big Business tries to vilify these countries, to slander and defame
them, to incite hostility against them. In the interest of the American
people the Communist Party is concerned with nailing these lies and
exposing these slanders.

The attitude of the Communist Party to these countries reflects
its devotion to the great principle of working—class internationalism

' which has deep roots in our country’s history. This tradition of inter-

 
 

 

national solidarity is a proud one. The Communist Party continues it
and considers it a badge of honor.

At the same time the Communist Party recognizes that over the
years it held certain wrong and oversimpliﬁed concepts of what its
relations should be to other Marxist parties. The Party tended to accept
uncritically many views of Marxists of other countries. Not all these
views were correct; some did not correspond to American conditions.

The Party also viewed uncritically developments in the Soviet
Union and other socialist countries. It mistakenly thought that any
public criticism of the views or policies of the Marxist parties of these
countries would weaken the bonds of international working—class
solidarity or bring comfort to the enemies of peace and socialism.

The incorrectness of this view was highlighted by the revelations

 

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 321

in Khrushchev’s special report to the 20th Congress of the CPSU.
Because it held this view, the Communist Party of our country was
entirely unprepared for and deeply shocked by the admissions of
crimes, violations of socialist justice, mistreatment of certain national
minorities, and the basis for the rupture of relations with Yugoslavia
——all at variance with the truly liberating character of socialism. The
courage shown in making these disclosures and the profound process
of self-correction, begun some years ago and sharply accelerated since
the 20th Congress, are irrefutable evidence of the historic role and
vitality of the socialist system.

Socialism is strengthened, not weakened, by the fraternal and
constructive criticism of Marxists of many lands.

New problems of relations have arisen as a result of the emergence
of socialism as a world system comprising a number of national states
in place of one encircled socialist country. Serious mistakes and short-
comings in the relations between the USSR and other socialist states-
as in the examples of Poland and Hungary—have been revealed. Ef-
forts are being made to correct these mistakes and certain important
corrections have been made on the basis of a further development of
the Marxist-Leninist principles of proletarian internationalism, national
independence and equality. Correction of errors in relationships be-
tween socialist states is facilitated by the fact that the fundamental
basis of such relations is common ideology, common aims, mutual
assistance and cooperation.

International working—class solidarity includes the right and re-
sponsibility to friendly criticism of brother parties or the actions of
socialist governments. At the same time it requires that such criticism
shall be within the framework of recognition that the fundamental
conﬂict of all peoples is with the forces of imperialism.

Our attitude was used to refurbish the slanderous calumny which
has been used historically against all radical movements in our coun-
try—the lie that the Communist Party is “the agent of a foreign
power.”

This despicable charge is a lie cut from the whole cloth. We are
American Communists, patriots. Our allegiance is to our own coun-
try, the United States. In representing and advancing the fundamental
welfare of the working class we aim always to serve our country’s
true national interests.

   

 

 

 

 

322 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

The Communist Party must continue to correct the oversimpliﬁed
relations which have existed between itself and other Marxist parties.
These relations must be based on the principles of scientiﬁc socialism,
on proletarian internationalism; they must be based on each Com-
munist Party serving the best national interests of its people and
thereby the common interests of all progressive humanity. This re-
quires the equality and independence of Marxist parties in the mutual
discussion and resolution of common problems; the right and duty of
the Communists of all countries to engage in cornradely criticism of
the policies and practices of the Communists of any country whenever
they feel this necessary. This will strengthen, not weaken, interna-
tional solidarity. It will advance the cause of socialism in all countries.

Bureaucratic Concepts of Party Organization

Bureaucratic concepts of Party organization, systems of leadership
and relations between the Party and the masses have been a prime
factor in contributing to our errors. They hindered the early and
timely correction of these errors. Wrong concepts of leadership dis-
couraged full and free participation of the membership in the discus-
sion of policy and tactics. They stood as insurmountable obstacles to
the eﬂorts of comrades in mass organizations to challenge sectarian
policies and tactics. They contributed to the weakening of inner-party
democracy. In many cases they resulted in departure from the very
procedures established by our own constitution. They resulted in
disciplinary actions which further inhibited expressions of disagree-
ment. They made the life of the Party largely routine, devoted, at
least between pre—convention discussion periods, to the organization of
a multitude of campaigns characterized by inadequate examination
and testing of our policies and tactics in actual life by our members
in the shops and mass organizations.

These bureaucratic methods of work, system of leadership and
organization have been accentuated in part by the mechanical applica-
tion of certain principles of organization adopted by other Commun-
ist parties which functioned under different historical conditions.

The history of factional struggle which almost destroyed our
Party in its early years gave rise to a correct desire to defend Party
unity against the danger of factional splits. But this was distorted by
cﬁiorts to achieve formal unity instead of uniting the Party on the

basis of principle, a full democratic inner life and free, open discussion
of differences.

This convention must completely abolish these bureaucratic meth-
ods of work, organization and leadership. It must clearly deﬁne the
character of our Party and its proper method of organization and
functioning.

The Communist Party is an American working—class political
party. It is a Party of white and Negro unity. It is devoted to the
struggle for constant advancement of the welfare of the working
class, the Negro people, the farming population, small businessmen
and professional people. Its ultimate aim is the socialist reorganiza-

tion of society in a peaceful, constitutional manner by the majority
choice of the American people.

On Vanguard Role

Our effort to advance these objectives requires that we retain the
fundamental concept of our organization as a vanguard organization,
one which is based on the scientiﬁc theory of socialism and which
strives at all times to strengthen its ties with the working class and
people, to win their conﬁdence and support by participation in their
everyday struggles.

The spontaneous struggles of the working class against capitalist
exploitation can, at best, lead only to trade union consciousness. So-
cialist consciousness must be brought into the working—class move-
ment by a party which is based on an advanced theory, scientiﬁc so-
cialism. Only such a party can help make the working class conscious
of itself as a class, help it grasp the relationship of class forces, the
meaning of speciﬁc struggles, the interconnection of these struggles
with the necessary and inevitable victory of socialism.

The Party of Communists always places uppermost the interests
of the entire working class and all the oppressed people. It dedicates
itself to helping the working class and its allies gain, step by step,
ever greater victories leading toward their historical goal of ending
class exploitation. This is the essence of the concept “vanguard role’’
which we seek to fulﬁll.

The concrete expression of this role will of necessity be diﬂerent
today in the presence of a powerful organized labor movement and
Negro people's movement than it was in the ’3o’s when these move-

 

324 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

ments were much smaller in size and narrower in content.

A Marxist Party which seeks to gain the conﬁdence of its class
cannot do so by arrogantly assuming that it is already the leader of
the workers. The possession of advanced theory and the ability to proj-
ect advanced ideas in the current struggles can and should lead to the
ever greater identiﬁcation of such a Marxist party with the class, and
the enhancement of its leadership role. But this is not an automatic
process.

In the past we have mechanically assumed the position of “the
leader of the working class” without regard to our real position of
strength and influence. This attitude hindered the very aim of provid-
ing Marxist guidance to the working class. As a result, the term “van-
guard role” assumed connotations of unrealism and arrogance, with

. which we seek to break. Listening and learning from the workers,

particularly in their everyday struggles at the level at which they are
being waged, we strive to earn the esteem of the working class as a
foundation for eﬂective leadership.

On Democratic Centralism and Monolithic Unity

Democracy is vital to a Communist Party. It is the method
by which the rich experience of the members of the Party and the
masses of people become available to the Party as a whole. It is this
experience and democratic participation together with the power of
Marxist analysis which enables the Party to keep Marxism from being
a dogma, and instead makes it a living, growing, developing science
with which we can serve our class and nation ever more effectively.

Whatever views may exist in our Party on the theory of demo-
cratic centralisrn, our concept and application in the past has led to
highly centralized forms of organization and leadership with the
democratic features of Party life subordinated. Experience has shown
that our concept of democratic centralism as we practiced it in the
past has fed a system of bureaucracy. We have tended to take o-ver
mechanically forms of organization and practices from abroad, rather
than assimilate critically the experiences of brother parties, utilizing
what is valid and applicable to our situations and problems. All this
has helped bureaucracy to ﬂourish at the expense of inner-party de-
mocracy.

It is these concepts and practices which we seek to modify in

 

Ft-s¢n""""

 

MAIN POLITICAL RESOLUTION 325

order to establish a foundation for a vast expansion of inner-party
democracy. We therefore propose that our Constitution shall seek to
guarantee that the will of the majority of our membership determines
all policy decisions and the election of committees. At the same time
provisions should be made for the right to dissent after decisions, while
guaranteeing our ability to act in a united way, guarding against
factionalism, federationism and parallel centers of leadership.

We must establish the broadest possibilities for democratic ex-
pression within our Party and procedures for regular review of policies
and the right to dissent even after decisions have been reached. Our
system of organization, leadership and concept of discipline must be
revised. Being a party of action, and not a debating society, we must
maintain a cohesiveness and unity so that we can be an effective force
once a policy is decided. Thus the problem is not to abandon all
forms of centralization but to ﬁnd the correct limits.

We want a maximum of internal democracy combined with the
necessary unity in action. The Draft Constitution develops proposals
that will bring our organization into harmony with the traditions and
experiences of American working-class organizations and potentially
acceptable to large numbers of American workers and socialist-rninded
militants as the kind of organization they would want to be identiﬁed
with.

As to monolithic unity: Originally, this term meant simply a
common ideology or outlook as opposed to a mixture of ideologies. In
practice, it came to mean a rigid conformity of views on all matters
of theory, policy and tactics. The concept of a common ideology must
be retained as essential to a Marxist party. But the term should be
dropped because of the harmful practices and connotations that have
grown around it.

The Communist Party is a democratic organization based on
majority rule. It is a cohesive organization for the purpose of acting
unitedly to carry out the policies and program decided by its mem-
bers. The inner life of the Party shall be regulated by the provisions
and rules of its constitution which will emerge from this Convention,
following prior discussion by the whole membership. The unfolding
of a correct mass policy by the Party, as well as its ability to attract and
hold masses of socialist—minded Americans, requires extensive changes
in its structure and methods of work. Among these are the following:

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

326 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

Guarantees of real inner—party democracy through provision of
channels for freedom of discussion, dissent and criticism within the
framework of carrying out the majority will.

The National Committee should issue a special publication on a
regular monthly basis devoted exclusively to articles or letters dis-
cussing, debating or differing with Party policies, whether current or
long-range. Such a publication is necessary to encourage the greatest
possible participation by the membership in the formulation, correc-
tion or abandonment of policies or tactics.

The decisions of all Party bodies shall continue to be made by
majority rule. Minorities or individuals opposed to such decisions
shall be required to abide by them. But the right of such individuals
or minorities to express their views shall be guaranteed in all cases.
However, this does not mean that factions—groupings with their own
platform, discipline, organization and publications set up in opposi-
tion to the regular program, discipline, organization and publications
of the Party———can be tolerated. The whole history of the Communist
Party shows that factionalism actually destroys inner—party democracy
and shatters Party unity.

Between pre—convention discussion periods the National Commit-
tee must take special steps to involve the membership in making basic
changes in policy. Such methods may involve setting aside limited
periods for Party-wide discussion on draft policy resolutions; or con-
vening special delegated conferences with power to act on speciﬁc
questions presented beforehand to the membership; or the organiza-
tion of referendum votes on questions.

Establishment of closest ties between membership and leadership
and creation of political and organizational guarantees against bureau-
cratic separation of leadership from membership by the following:

a) Proceedings of the National Committee shall be publicized,
including digests of speeches or reports as well as votes of National
Committee members on important questions. Where possible, State
Committees shall do likewise.

b) Minutes of National Board meetings shall be circulated among
all members of the National Committee. Periodic summaries should
be sent to State Committees.

c) The National Committee should be considerably enlarged.

d) The National Committee shall meet a minimum of three times

per year, with agendas and draft documents to be discussed sent in
advance to all members.

The important and deep—going changes on questions of program,
policy and organization will expand the opportunities of our mem-
bers to work with ever larger sections of progressive Americans and
their organizations. It will provide the basis for building our Party
into an effective Marxist organization capable of coping with the chal-
lenging problems before the American working class and people.
There are no valid grounds for any destructive attitude towards the
Party’s past contributions and the vital role the Party has to play in
the future. Neither is there any justiﬁcation for proposals to liquidate
our Party so as to “clear the way” for a broader party of socialism at
some future time.

This convention goes on record to aﬂirm the continuation of the
Communist Party of the USA. Our chief task is to strengthen, rebuild
and consolidate the Communist Party and overcome its isolation.

This convention opposes the transformation of the Party into a
political or educational association.

Although we oppose endless debate on this question, this should
not close the door to all constructive exploration and discussion of the
subject as may be organized by the incoming National Committee.

We recognize that some ideas that have been brought forward in
this discussion are revisionist in character. However, it would be wrong
to label all proposals for change in name and form as revisionist per se.

The People’s Struggles Today

It should be our concern to help the labor and people's move-
ments bring the decisive issues to the forefront and win signiﬁcant
gains.

High among these issues is the peop-le’s standard of living: job
security, farm income, the high cost of living, the crisis in schools,
housing and health, the chronic poverty of one-fifth of the nation,
segregation and discrimination.

The new outburst of struggles in the South again highlights the
central importance of the civil rights struggle of the Negro people and
their allies. Therefore we demand full equality in jobs, housing, educa-

tion and political representation, and the abolition of all forms of
segregation.

Vital questions affecting the civil liberties of all Americans are at
issue before the Supreme Court, Congress and the Administration:
the Taft—Hartley Act, the “loyalty” program, the Smith Act, the Me-
Carran Act, the McCarran-Walter Act and the demand for amnesty
for Smith Act prisoners. These require the rallying of the American
people to regain their lost liberties and defend the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.

Above all, the people’s profound desire for peace and an end to
the cold war calls for concrete steps toward disarmament and a policy
of peaceful coexistence: for an end to H-bomb tests, for drastic cuts
in the arms budget and the like.

In the struggles around these issues in the shops and communities
our concern at all times must be to help strengthen and unite the
organizations of labor and the people. It must be to help build under
labor’s leadership an ever more effective people’s coalition directed
against the great monopolies and striving to elect a people’s anti-
monopoly government.

Our Party stretches out its hand to all workers and the whole
American people in the fellowship of common struggle for the goal of
peace, democracy and social progress.

Resolution on Social Democracy

Adopted by the 16th National Convention, C.P.U.S.A.

February 9-12, 1957

Social Democracy continues to be a major inﬂuence in the labor
and people’s movements of almost all capitalist countries. It plays a
signiﬁcant role in a number of colonial and semi-colonial countries. In
our country, while the actual Social Democratic organizations and
their inﬂuence are relatively small, reformism in its speciﬁc American
form is the decisive inﬂuence in the labor and people’s movement.

It is clear, therefore, that a correct attitude towards Social Democ-
racy and other reformist organizations and movements is most essential
to our Party. Without it, it is impossible to overcome our sectarianism,
to break out of our isolation and to effectively advance the struggle
either for our immediate objectives or our socialist aims. In the past
we suffered both from a woeful underestimation of the role and
inﬂuence of Social Democracy and other reformist trends, as well as
from a narrow sectarian policy towards them.

The very terms Social Democrat and Social Democracy were used
by us almost exclusively in a derogatory fashion. While we did take a
very positive position towards reforms under capitalism, our use of
the term reformist only in a derogatory manner sometimes tended to
give the impression that we feared or opposed many reforms because
they might strengthen capitalism. Quite often, by centering our main
criticism against the Social Democratic and other reformist leaders of
the labor, Negro and other people’s organizations, we weakened the
necessary unity against the common enemy.

By the thesis that it is essential to smash all Social Democratic
organizations as a condition to win the masses to socialism, we weak-
ened both the unity in the immediate struggle and the winning of the
workers to the socialist goal. By adopting a policy of striving towards
the liquidation rather than the cooperation of the Social Democratic

329

  

330 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

organizations, we undermined rather than promoted the united front
of the Communists and Socialists. Most of these errors were common to
the world Communist movement and their harmful effect was most
sharply expressed in the characterization of Social Democracy as
social fascism at the very moment when fascism was menacing the
entire working class and all its organizations and trends. In the middle
’3o’s these errors were corrected in part. This resulted in many positive
experiences in the anti—fascist struggles of that period.

A speciﬁc error prevailing for many years in our Party was the
theory of “skipping over the reformist stage,” which grew out o-f the
fact that the Social Democratic organizations, as well as the trade
unions, were relatively weak in our country. This led to the theory
that the Communists would thus lead the workers in organizing trade
unions, a labor party, etc., free of reformist leadership. This attitude
was carried over in other ﬁelds of work, including the Negro liberation
movement. Remnants of this theory are still prevalent. It is one of the
specific manifestations of our sectarianism, and a complete break with
this “skipping over” theory is essential for a successful struggle against it.

While there is no mass Social Democratic Party in the USA, it

. would be a mistake to underestimate the inﬂuence of the existing

Social Democratic groups, trends and organizations, whose inﬂuence
is far greater than their mere number or current activities in their own
name. The trade union movement, now grown to more than 16 rnil—
lion members, is led primarily by labor and social reformists whose
policies determine the program of the trade union movement.

To a degree, the cooperation of labor reformists (trade union
leaders who stand for capitalism and with no socialist background or
traditions), social reformists (those labor leaders who have a socialist
background), and bourgeois reformists (liberal wing of the Demo-
cratic Party) in such organizations as Americans for Democratic
Action is, in the absence of a mass Social Democratic Party in the
U.S., and under the conditions prevailing in our country, performing
the function of Social Democracy.

We should not push this comparison too far. But it can emphasize
for us the fact that we do have the inﬂuence of reforrnism in our
country, even though it is not identical with that of most of the other
capitalist countries. We also can see from this that correcting the previ-
ous error that we have no problem of Social Democracy or reformism

 

 

 

RESOLUTION ON SOCIAL DEMOCRACY 331

in this country should not result in labelling every reformist a Social
Democrat.

It is erroneous to think that the American workers and their allies
will create an anti-monopoly coalition and establish an anti-monopoly
government without the trade unions and other reformist—led organi-
zations being the very basis for such a movement. This does not mean
that all reformist leaders will readily support such a movement and
objectives or that many of them will not offer strong resistance to it.
It will be a steady struggle in which the masses will push forward
because of necessity and the experience they will gain in‘ the course
of the developing struggles on immediate issues. It will be a struggle
that will inevitably result in differentiation within the leadership of the
trade unions and other mass organizations.

In this developing struggle for the anti-monopoly coalition the
more advanced forces of the labor and people’s movement can and
should play a most important and essential role. This is why, among
other reasons, there is need for strengthening our own Party. This is
one of the tasks that can be performed by the cooperation of the Com-
munists and other socialist—oriented forces in the labor and people’s
movement. Such cooperation, as well as united action in defense of
peace, civil liberties, equal rights and economic security will no doubt
facilitate clariﬁcation of ideological questions among many and pro-
mote the movement for a broader united Marxist Party in our coun-
try.

We must be on guard against confusing the need for a labor-
people’s anti-monopoly coalition with the perspective for a broader
united Marxist Party. In some Left circles outside our ranks, such
confusion can already be noted. Lack of clarity on this question can
lead to a narrow sectarian position towards the anti-monopoly coali-
tion and an opportunist position on a united Marxist Party. It is clear
that these movements will develop simultaneously. They will gen-
erally support each other, objectively. But they must be seen as distinct
movements with distinct objectives. Obviously, all those favoring and
striving for anti-monopoly goals to be achieved under capitalism can
be won for the first. Only those favoring socialism can be won for
the latter.  ,

Our emphasis on a new approach to Social ‘Democracy and re-
formism generally is not based upon and does not imply the opportun-

 

332 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

ist idea of the disappearance of all differences between the Commun-
ists and Social Democrats, between the Marxists and reformist trends
in the world labor movement and here in the USA. The new approach
is ﬁrst a recognition of a new situation, new relations of forces, new
tasks, first and foremost being that of preventing a third world war.
It flows from the fact that in the present situation, the paramount is-
sues confronting the labor movement are the defense of peace, na-
tional freedom and democracy.

Our new approach does recognize past errors as well as narrowing
of differences. On a world scale the new theoretical proposition that
wars are no longer inevitable under present conditions does not auto-
matically wipe out the danger of war, but on the other hand places
new emphasis on the need for and the possibility for cooperation on
the part of all workers’ organizations in defense of peace. Without
question, our renewed emphasis———now also adopted by the world
Communist movement—on a peaceful and constitutional road to
socialism, removes one of the major differences of the past. Our
Party’s new approach to civil liberties now, and our pledge to preserve
and extend the Bill of Rights under socialism should remove one of
the major barriers toward cooperation with those socialists who really
strive to achieve democratic socialism.

Our position on the possibility of socialism being achieved through
the cooperation of a number of workers’ and other democratic peo-
p1e’s parties, as well as the continuance of a multi-party system under
socialism, so long as the people desire this, is another major step in
the direction of cooperation of all Marxist and socialist—oriented forces
NOW and towards the ultimate creation of a broader united Marxist
party. Our abandonment of an idealistic, uncritical attitude towards
the lands of socialism, for one of a more mature and critical support
of their socialist achievement and contribution to world peace and the
strengthening of the world labor movement, should greatly strengthen
our Party’s ability to promote true internationalism generally, and win
support for a better understanding of the socialist world among the
socialist—minded workers.

The ideological differences that divide the Social Democrats from
the Communists remain fundamental and numerous. Here we refer
not to certain groupings like the Nenni Socialists in Italy, like G. D.
H. Cole in Britain, or some like those grouped around the Monthly

 

 

RESOLUTION ON soCIAL DEMOCRACY 333

Review here. We refer to the ofﬁcial Social Democratic movement, its
main leaders in such countries as Britain, France, West Germany, etc.,
and those in the U.S.A. who occupy the same place in the political
spectrum. And we limit ourselves to ideological differences and do not
speak of such obvious differences as those of the policies of the French
Socialists (now the government party) in Algeria or Egypt, or similar
differences with Social Democrats in our country.

These differences include their rejection in whole or in part of dia-
lectical and historical materialism; their adherence to class collabora-
tion as against the class struggle; their rejection in practice of
internationalism, exempliﬁed, among other things, in the negative
attitude to the USSR and the other socialist lands; differences exist
on such important matters as the national and agrarian questions,
colonialism, imperialist war, the role of the working class, the role of
the Marxist party of the working class and the allies of the working
class.

Among those who still formally adhere to the aim of socialism,
it is conceived as the end product of a series of capitalist reforms and
not as a radical transformation of society, and hence our difference
with them is not merely one of how socialism is to be achieved. And
on this question too, our conception of the peaceful and constitutional
road to socialism is not identical with the classic “parliamentary road”
put forward by the Social Democrats and which has as yet nowhere
led to the establishment of socialism.

In our conception the struggles of the people, the role of the
workers and their allies is a basic factor at every stage of the struggle
to achieve the radical reorganization of society, in creating the condi-
tions for the people’s parliamentary victory, for carrying out of the
people’s will. All this shows that while we have much in common
with Social Democracy and this must be emphasized, many funda-
mental differences remain. .

Our new approach however, is not based on these differences. It
is dictated by new possibilities and paramount needs, despite these
differences. While we should develop the most thorough and friendly
discussion on all questions, including. ideological "differences, trying
to ﬁnd basic agreement where and with whom .we can, it is on the
basis of the vital issues now confronting the" workers and their allies
that we must strive to ﬁnd the basis for  In this Way life itself

will contribute towards dissolving or resolving many differences which
discussion alone will not achieve. And even where differences remain,
we must learn to disagree in a new way. We must not take the posi-
tion that we have all the answers and have nothing to learn. This in-
cludes all questions, theoretical, political and organizational.

We should look upon the Social Democratic organizations, includ-
ing their elected leaders, as workers’ organizations. We must deal with
these organizations fraternally, and not as enemies. We strive for their
cooperation, not liquidation. Such cooperation will be beneﬁcial to
all who participate and to the working class as a whole.

CONSTITUTION

Adopted by the 16th National Convention, C.P.U.S.A.

February 9-12, 1957

PREAMBLE

The Communist Party of the United
States is an American working-class
political organization which bases it-
self upon the principles of scientiﬁc
socialism. It champions the immediate
and fundamental interests of the work-
ers, farmers, the Negro people and all
others who labor by hand and brain,
against capitalist exploitation and op-
pression.

The Communist Party believes that
the abolition of the exploitation of
man by man, of poverty, war, racism
and ignorance will be ﬁnally achieved
by the socialist reorganization of so-
ciety—by the common ownership and
operation of the national economy un-
der a government of the people led
by the working class. The Communist
Party holds that there are various
roads to socialism and that the work-
ing people of our nation will ﬁnd
their own road to socialism. We ad-
vocate a peaceful, democratic road to
socialism through the political and
economic struggles of the American
people within the developing constitu-
tional process.

The Communist Party seeks to ad-
Vance the understanding of the work-

ing class in its day-to-day struggles
for its historic mission, the establish-
ment of socialism. Socialism, through
the achievement of a vastly widened
democracy, will fulﬁll the promise of
an atomic age and guarantee the real-
ization of the right to “life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness,” turning
the epic achievements of American
labor, science and culture to the use
and enjoyment of all men and women.

The Communist Party upholds the
achievements of American democracy
and defends the United States Consti-
tution and its Bill of Rights, particu-
larly the 14th and 15th Amendments
which guarantee equality to the
American Negro, against those who
would destroy -democracy. It ﬁghts un-
compromisingly against imperialism
and colonial oppression, for curbing
and breaking the power of monopoly,
against racial, national and religious
discrimination, anti-Semitism and all
forms of chauvinism. It regards the
struggle to wipe out the system of jim-
crowism and to win immediate and
full citizenship and unconditional
equality for the Negro people as basic
to the ﬁght for democracy.

The Communist Party holds as a
cardinal principle that there is an iden-

335

 

 

 

 

 

tity of interest which serves as a
common bond uniting the workers of
all lands. It recognizes that this com-
mon bond is strengthened when work-
ing-class movements operate in an
atmosphere of independence and equal-
ity and exercise the right of fraternal
and constructive criticism. It holds fur-
ther that the true national interest of
our country and the cause of peace
and progress require the solidarity of
all freedom-loving peoples, peaceful
coexistence of all nations, and the
strengthening of the United Nations
as a universal instrument of peace.
The Communist Party bases its
theory generally on the scientiﬁc, hu-
manist and democratic heritage of
mankind and particularly on the prin-
ciples of scientiﬁc socialism as devel-
oped by Karl Marx, Frederick Engels
and V. I. Lenin. These universally
valid principles the Communist Party
of the U.S.A. interprets, applies and
strives to develop further in accord-
ance with the requirements of the
American class struggle, democratic
traditions and customs. In the struggle
for democracy, peace and social prog-
ress, the Communist Party strives to
carry forward the democratic tradi-
tions of Jefferson, Paine, Lincoln and
Frederick Douglass, and the great
working-class and socialist traditions
of William Sylvis, Eugene V. Debs
and Charles E. Ruthenberg. In the
struggle for socialism the Communist
Party seeks no narrow partisan mo-
nopoly. It ﬁghts side by side with all
who struggle for socialism and seeks
to cooperate with all socialist-minded
Americans to achieve socialism.

. 336 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

DRAFT PLAN OF WORK

We have just concluded a deep and
far-reaching discussion on the problems
facing our country, our class and our
Party. The time has come to issue
a ringing call to all our members to
swing into action. The central Reso-
lution adopted at this convention gives
us the instrument. It outlines a per-
spective for the American people; a
perspective that arises out of their
needs and their demands.

What American doesn’t want an end
to poverty, and a program of new so-
cial advance? Such a program is re-
quired by the new age of atomic pow-
er, automation and the growth of mo-
nopoly, that directly threatens all the
advances the American workers have
attained through struggle.

The American people in their great-
est numbers want peace. Increasingly
they are coming to understand that this
can only be achieved by once and for
all ending the cold war and ushering
in an era of peaceful coexistence.

The heroic and valiant struggles of
the Negro people in the South is mak-
ing an increasing impact on the con-
science of all Americans. Victory in
this gigantic struggle is the number
one democratic task facing the nation.
It will not be halted. It will gain in-
creasing widespread support until the
Negro people have achieved. full eco-
nomic, political and social equality.

Our country’s historic and ingrained
tradition of democracy gives us full con-
ﬂdenoe that the American people, now

345

as in the past, will rise in defense of
our Constitution and our Bill of Rights.
They will preserve our democratic heri-
tage from all those who would deny
or take it away.

Our Convention has united in the
view that for those who believe in sci-
entiﬁc socialism to contribute to these
broad objectives, it requires at this
time a consolidation of our Party and
an expansion in the circulation of the
Marxist press. _

Our comrades, however, have given
evidence of great dissatisfaction. On
the one hand, so much is going on
around us in the people's movement.
On the other, we are isolated from
most of these movements through
which lies the only possible road to
achieve the objectives laid down in our
resolution.

The trade union movement, the Ne-
gro people’s movement, farm and lib-
eral organizations have already de-
termined and begun to move on many
questions that contribute, in large
measure, to meeting the immediate
needs of the American people. This
includes resolutions, actions and cam-
paigns on a great variety of questions.
We wish to state ﬂatly—we will en-
dorse and work for all proposals aris-
ing from among these organizations
that will aid in advancing the interests
of the working class and other sections
of the people against their common
enemy——the monopolies. In order to
fulfill this pledge, in order to con-

 

 

 

  

346 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH

tribute to these objectives, we must un-
rcservedly enter the main arenas of
struggle where these issues are being
fought out, in the shops, in the com-
munities, in the national and state
legislatures and in the pending munici-

pal elections.

Economic Program

The labor movement has an exten-
sive economic and social program deal-
ing with the needs of the workers and
the interests of the people generally.
This includes the ﬁght for a minimum
wage of $1.25 per hour; general agree-
ment on the need to organize the un-
organized with the South as the main
geographical area; opposition to the
so-called “right-to-work” laws; opposi-
tion to the high cost of living and a
need for the Government to investigate
proﬁteering; drought relief and ﬂood
control and aid to the family and
middle-sized farms in their struggle
against monopoly. At the local union
level there is an intense concern for
the deterioration of on-the-job condi-
tions as a result of heightening speed-
up.

However, the demand that is taking
shape and gathering increased support
in labor’s ranks to meet the growing
problems of speed-up and automation
is the shorter work week with no re-
duction in pay.

Peace

There is a growing recognition
among the people that increased arma-
ments are no guarantee of peace.
Throughout the last period the Ameri-
can people have found many ways to

CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

express their deep-seated desires for
peace. Among others, it has included
opposition to universal military train-
ing; the need for big-power negotia-
tions; fear of increasing radioactivity
and consequently opposition to con-
tinuing A- and H-bomb tests; the need
to withdraw troops from all foreign
countries; universal disarmament and
support for the United Nations. The
peace sentiment of the people has not
been expressed in direct opposition to
the whole imperialist line of the Eisen-
hower Administration. Most often it
has taken the form of opposition on
single issues, many times indirectly.

The labor movement, for example,
is uncompromising in its demand for
a basic change in the tax structure,
to lift the unjust burden of taxes from
the lower income groups. This comes
in direct conflict with the budget based
on expanded military spending, mili-
tary bases and military threats that re-
quires such taxes. The demand for
an increase in tax exemptions for those
with lower incomes, for an end to
the World War II withholding tax,
contributes to the struggle for peace.

More directly, there is growing fear
of involvement in a new war. There
is fear that the Eisenhower-Dulles doc-
trine for the Middle East will once
again bring us to the “brink.” There
is no desire on the part of the people
to enrich the oil monopolies at the ex-
pense of American lives.

The Negro People

The violent, illegal attack upon the
Negro people in the South must be

stopped. It endangers the entire demo-
cratic fabric of American life. The
forcible denial of civil rights to the
Negro people, the open and cynical
Dixiecrat revolt against the Supreme
Court decisions stand as an obstacle to
the further advance of the labor move-
ment. It rivets the power of extreme
reactionary Dixiecrat control on our
national Congress and as a consequence
obstructs and threatens democratic
progress for all the people.

The Supreme Court decisions on de-
segregation and transportation must be
enforced. There must be no interfer-
ence With the right of the Negro peo-
ple to vote. Illegal barriers to the or-
ganization of the unorganized in the
South must be wiped out. This re-
quires the active support of the
American people through direct aid
for these valiant struggles in the
South. It also requires a struggle to
achieve full equality and democracy
for the Negro people on the job, in the

T schools and in the community all over

the country. It demands a vigorous
struggle for the adoption by this Con-
gress of a bi-partisan National Civil
Rights program.

Above all, the bombing, shooting
and bloody attacks on Negro men,
women and children must be stopped.
The refusal of local and state adminis-
trations to enforce the laws of our
[and demands that President Eisen-
hower speak out and direct full Fed-
eral intervention to enforce the law
and to restore the legal rights of the
Negro people.

Defend the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights

The latest insidious plot against de-
mocracy is the attempt to use the Taft-
Hartley law to_ do the job of the Smith
Act which is coming under increasing
challenge. The setbacks to McCarthy-
ism by the democratic forces have been
insufficient. The time has come to chal-
lenge the whole system of repressive
legislation that still threatens to en-
velop our land. It jails Americans
for holding unpopular opinions; it de-
nies jobs to those who will not pledge
loyalty to un-American committees; it
challenges the right of the labor move-
ment to expand; it prohibits free travel
between countries.

Among the many tasks required to
defend our Constitution and the Bill of
Rights outstanding is the demand for
repeal of the Taft-Hartley Law and
amnesty for all political prisoners.

Consolidate Our Party

Our Party can supply the spark,
ﬁre and campaign spirit that will aid
in achieving the objectives of the peo-
ple’s movement. We can help supply
that special ingredient of conscious-
ness and purpose that will shape the
struggles on the various issues into a
developing anti-monopoly coalition. We
say this fully aware of how our Party
has been weakened in this last period.
We recognize that there has been a
letdown in these activities as a result
of our internal debate. But the time
has come to test, in life, the conclusions

 

343 PROCEEDINGS or 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

and the tentative opinions arrived at
in this discussion. Dedication to these
objectives is not enough. We need to
get to work with the people. It is only
in the course of such mass activity and
experience that we will further resolve
our internal diﬂerences—for these mass
tasks and struggles unite all of us.

We live and work in a vast nation
composed of regions, states and locali-
ties with their own and distinct prob-
lems, political and social movements
and traditions. The working class and
people confront and attempt to meet
their problems through community,
municipal, state and regional institu-
tions. All the great problems facing the
nation are manifest here. It is incum-
bent upon our Party, in striving to be a
more indigenous political movement,
to shape its policies and especially its
plans of action fully taking the fore-
going into account.

More than ever before, our Party
needs a mass voice to speak up to the
people. Leaﬂets and pamphlets are not
enough. To fulﬁll these objectives we
need an expanded circulation of the
Marxist press—T}xe Worker and the
Daily Worker.

On this then we should center our
attention. In every shop, union, mass
organization and community one or
more sections of this program already
have considerable support. The task
of progressives is to help transform
this support into activity.

I. We support the demand for Eisen-
hower to intervene to stop the blood-
shed in the South and enforce the

port the bi—partisan demand for a
National Civil Rights program.

2. We oppose the Eisenhower-Dulles
doctrine of intervention in the
Middle East. We support the de-
mand for halting further A- and
H-bomb tests.

3. We support the demand for in-
creased tax exemptions for low in-
comes. »

4. We support the demand for a short-
er work week with no reduction

- in pay.

5. We support the repeal of the Taft-
Hartley Law.

6. We are for amnesty for all political
prisoners.

7. We call for an expansion in the cir-
culation of the Marxist press——The
Worker and the Daily Worker.

To guarantee the execution of this
program we call on the incoming Na-
tional Committee to make the ﬁght
for this program one of its first orders
of business and to take all necessary
steps to see that it is carried out. This
must include a fresh approach to how
this program can be carried out.

We call upon the next sessions of
the State Conventions to hear a report
on this program and to merge it with
their local issues and municipal cam-
paigns. For it is only through partici-
pation in these important local activi-
ties that we can begin to overcome
our isolation. We suggest to the State
Conventions that they likewise instruct
their incoming State Committees to
make a State Program of mass work
one of its ﬁrst orders of business and
to take steps to guarantee its execu-

Supreme Court decisions. We sup- don.

STATEMENT OF OB SERVERS

At the 16th National Convention, C.P.U.S.A.

February 9-12, 1957

[Following is the text of a state-
ment issued by eight of eleven observ-
ers invited to attend the Communist
Party’s 16th. National Convention.]

The undersigned were “observers”
at the recent Communist Party conven-
tion in New York attending one or sev-
eral and in the case of some of us all
sessions. The initiative for the project
of having some non-Communist citi-
zens, who are in fundamental disagree-
ment with much of Communist phi-
losophy and program, present at the
convention and free afterward to re-
port in any way they wished, came
from A. I. Muste and others, with
strong support from Norman Thomas.
The suggestion was conveyed to offi-
cers of the Communist Party and ac-
cepted by them. -They issued _invita-
tions to persons suggested by Mr.
Muste.

Since reference has been made to
these matters in the press and else-
where, we wish to state that the ses-
sions of the convention were demo-
cratically conducted with vigorous dis-
cussion of all matters brought to the
floor. There were many indications

that no individual or group was in a
position to control the convention.
All documents coming out of con-
vention committees were made avail-
able in mirneographed form to dele-
gates and observers, and were made
available to the press immediately after
the delegates had acted upon them.
The votes on divisions in committees
were reported to the delegates. So far
as we could tell, Robert’s Rules of
Order and the Rules adopted by the
convention for its own conduct were
scrupulously carried out.
Nominations for 20 out of 60 mem-
bers of the incoming National Com-
mittee were made from the ﬂoor. There
were 46 nominations for the 20 posi-
tions. The votes were widely scattered,
with no one receiving more than about
70 percent of the votes and the high-
est votes going to others than nation-
ally known leaders who would pre-
sumably have been unanimously
elected at old style Communist con-

’ ventions.

As the press reported, the former
national secretary, Eugene Dennis, in
his opening report rejected the propos-
als of the French Communist, Iacques

350 PROCEEDINGS OF 16TH CONVENTION, C.P.U.S.A.

Duclos, on certain key issues such as
the primacy of the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union. Duclos has been
regarded as an important channel for
conveying the views of the Soviet Com-
munist leaders to Western parties. This
time there were no recantations when
the Duclos position was disclosed, as
used to be the case. Refusal to follow
certain of the Duclos “directives” was
sustained by the convention by a two-
thirds vote or better when matters of
this kind came before it.

It is always necessary to probe be-
neath the words of political conven-
tions to determine what they mean
in terms of solid political reality, and,
in view of the many admissions of
gross Communist errors in the past by
this convention, it is specially valid in
this case to suspend judgment as to
the extent to which the Communist
Party has achieved independence and
moved toward democratic socialism,
and to let the actual behavior of the
Party and its members determine the
verdict. We deplore the fact that the
convention arrived at no clear con-

demnation of the military intervention

in Hungary.

However, in view of the upheavals
in Poland and Hungary, the open air-
ing in the Daily Worker in recent
months of wide divergences among CP
leaders and members, and the conduct
of the recent convention as we observed
it, to suppose, as some apparently do,
that the ferment in the Communist

movement here and abroad is merely an
elaborate stage effect and that nothing
is really happening seems to us to
ﬂy in the face of the evidence.

Finally, we wish to protest vigorously
against the continuance by Senator
Eastland’s Senate Internal Security sub-
committee of the un-American practice
of governmental inquisition into politi-
cal opinions and activities, as instanced
by the summons to Eugene Dennis to
appear next Monday before the sub-
committee. That the security of this
country is actually threatened by any-
thing that may have happened at the
convention of the drastically weakened
Communist Party is an idea which it
is not possible to take seriously.

The signers of the statement were:

A. I. Muste, secretary emeritus, Fel-
lowship of Reconciliation.

Dorothy Day, editor, Catholic Work-
er.

Roy Finch, chairman, War Resisters
League.

Stringfellow Barr, lecturer and publi-
cist.

Lyle Tatum, peace secretary for
Middle Atlantic Region, American
Friends Service Committee.

Bayard Rustin, executive secretary,‘

War Resisters League.

Alfred Hassler, director of publica-
tions, Fellowship of Reconciliation.

George Willoughby, director, Cen-
tral Committee for Conscientious Ob-
jectors.
