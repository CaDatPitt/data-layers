The Twenty-One
Conditions Of
Admission Into
The Communist  
International

national (as we know, the decision of the Congress has twenty-one
conditions). In the first condition, the Communist Parties and those
who wish to join the Communist International are required to carry
on really daily Communist agitation in the spirit of the program and
decisions of the Third International. The organs :of_ the press-

"should be edited by reliable Communists who have proved their
loyalty to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The dictatorship
of the proletariat should not be spoken of simply as a current hack-
neyed. formula, .it should be advocated in such a way that its neces-
sity should be apparent to every rank and ﬁle working man and
woman, to each soldier and peasant, and should emanate from every-
day facts systematically recorded by our press from day to day.”

In view of the fact that the periodical press and the Party publica-
tions, in the Social-Democratic Parties, were usually in the hands of
professional journalists and parliamentary politicians, and not subor-
dinated to the Central Committee, the ﬁrst point in the conditions makes
it obligatory on the parties wishing to join the Communist Interna-
tional to take the periodic press and the Party publications ﬁrmly into
their hands. The first point of the conditions requires the parties
wishing to join the Communist International to "systematically and
mercilessly denounce in the press, at meetings, in trade unions and
co-operatives, not only the bourgeoisie, but its assistants, the reformists
of every color and shade.” (My italics.)

In the second point of the conditions of admission it is made obliga-
tory upon all parties wishing to join the Second International to "sys-
tematically and regularly remove from all responsible posts in the labor
movement (the Party organization, editorial board, trade unions, par-
liamentary fraction, co-operative society, municipalities, etc.) all reform-
ists and followers of the 'Center’ (my italics) and to have them
replaced by Communists, even at the cost of replacing, at the beginning,
‘experienced’ men by rank and ﬁle working men.”

As the Social-Democratic Parties in the bourgeois countries, even
when in opposition to the government, do not break from coalition
with the bourgeoisie, and avoid revolutionary methods of struggle, they
value their bourgeois legality very highly. We know that during the
war, under the false pretence that it was impermissible to sacrifice the

legality of their existence, they did not decline even the dirtiest and

bloodiest forms of serving the imperialist State. Therefore the great
importance of the third condition‘of acceptance is plain, namely, the
duty for legal parties to form a parallel illegal apparatus for better

10

organizing ‘the struggle and for illegal parties to combine legal and
illegal possibilities of struggle.

The Social-Democratic Parties of the Second International, in con-
formity with their general attitude to the bourgeois state, excluded the
work among the soldiers from their practice, both before and still more,
during the war. On the contrary, the fourth condition specially em-
phasizes the duty of carrying on systematic work among the soldiers,
and where such work cannot be carried on in a legal manner, it must

be done illegally. “The abandonment of such work would be equiva- -

lent to the betrayal of revolutionary duty and would be incompatible
with membership of the Third International.” Lenin stated in his
speech on the question of the Communist Party joining the British
Labor Party:

“We see in Ireland 200,000 English soldiers, oppressing the Irish
by means of the worst imaginable terror. No revolutionary propa-
ganda is being carried on among these soldiers by the English So-
cialists. But we clearly state in our resolutions that only those
English parties can be admitted into the Third International which
will carry on great revolutionary propaganda among the British
soldiers and workers.” (Minutes of the Second Congress, session on
August 6th, page 412.)

The majority of the Social-Democratic Parties of the Second Inter-
national did not work among the peasants, and the ﬁfth condition of
joining the Communist International makes work in the villages a
duty of. the Party.

“Communist work in the rural districts is acquiring a predominant
importance during the present period. It should be carried on
through Communist workmen, of both city and country, who have
connections withlthe rural districts. To refuse to do this work or to
transfer such work to untrustworthy half-reformists, is equal to
renouncing the proletarian revolution.”

The sixth condition of acceptance into the Communist International
obliges the Party to expose not only social-patriotism, but also hypo-
critical social-paciﬁsm, to "systematically demonstrate to the workers
that without the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism no international
arbitration courts,'no talk of disarmament, no ‘democratic’ reorganiza-
tion of the League of Nations will save mankind from new imperialist
wars.” This is all the more necessary, because not only the bour-

11

geoisie but the social-democrats, both the rights and the center, preached
among the working class that this war was the last war, that the
League of Nations (which contained the imperialists) was capable’ of
abolishing war and peacefully "solving” all the conﬂicts, which arose,
etc. From the very beginning of the League of Nations, the Com-
munist International warned the workers that the League of Nations,
which was under the power of the strongest imperialist robbers, who
enslave countries and colonies, did not want to and could not abolish
war, but, on the contrary, was the organizer and instrument of im-

perialist wars and counter-revolutionary intervention. Need it -be -

added, that the entire history of the League of Nations, particularly
its role in the -bandit attack of Japan on China, in the preparations
for the partition of China, the vicious intrigues against the U.S.S.R.,
has completely confirmed this forecast. Even in 1920 the Communist
International pointed out that, behind the cackle about the reduction
of armaments was concealed the preparation of the imperialists for
a new war. , The Disarmament Conference, at present rotting away,
plainly shows the masses that the imperialists cannot and do. not want
to reduce their armaments, that, on the contrary, during the last few
years, they have increased their armaments to a tremendous -extent, while
the antagonisms between the imperialists have become so intense that
the economic war which is already being carried on throughout the
world, the actual closing of borders to the import of commodities from
other countries, currency warfare, etc., may unexpectedly" change into
military conflicts between the imperialists and still more into attacks on
the Soviet Union.

The seventh condition compels the Parties not only to split com-
pletely with reformism, and the policy of the “center,” and propaganda
of this split among the broad circles of Party members, but “uncondi-
tionally and peremptorily requires that this split be brought about with
least possible delay. The Communist International cannot reconcile
itself to the fact that such avowed reformists as, for instance, Turatti,
Kautsky, I-Iilferding, I-Iilquit, Longuet, MacDonald, Mordigliani, etc.,
and others should be entitled to consider themselves members of the
Third International. This would make the Third International re-
semble the Second International.” .

In view of the fact that, even before the war, there was a view in

the Social-Democratic Parties that the bourgeoisie, the imperialists, ‘

“introducecivilization into the colonies,” while during and after the
war, the social-democrats with particular cynicism, supported the plun-
der and division of the colonies‘, the Communist International demand-
ed, in condition No. 8, from the parties wishing to join it——

12

 

"a specially clear line of the parties in those countries where the
bourgeoisie possesses such colonies and oppress other nations. Every
Party desirous of belonging to the Third International should be
bound to denounce without any reserve all the methods of ‘their
own’ imperialists in the colonies, supporting, not in words, but in
deeds, every independence movement in the colonies. It should de-
mand the expulsion of their own imperialists from such colonies, and
cultivate among the workers of their own country a truly fraternal
attitude towards the toiling'population of the colonies and oppressed
nationalities, and carry on a systematic agitation in its own army
against every kind of oppression of the colonial population.”

At the Second Congress, in the reports and discussions, and espe-

cially in the resolutions, the main ﬁre was directed against the reform- -

ists, social-chauvinists and social-paciﬁsts of all kinds-—against the
rights and "center.” But simultaneously, both in the reports, the
discussion and the resolutions, a struggle is carried on also against left
phrases and sectarianism.

At the Second Congress there were speeches against work in the
reformist trade unions, and in Parliament. In the vote on the reso-
lution on “the trade union movement, the factory committees and the
Third International,” thirteen delegates abstained. Immediately after
the war, among the revolutionary workers there began a strong ten-
dency against joining the reformist trade unions and working in them
(and also against the participation of Communists in Parliament), in
spite of the fact that the reformist trade unions had become much
larger than they were before the war. The deep roots of these feel-
ings are shown by the fact that they appeared simultaneously in a
number of the biggest capitalist countries. The First Congress of the
Communist Party of Germany, under the inﬂuence of these elements,
decided against participation in Parliament (the C.P.G. did not partici-
pate in the elections to the Constituent Assembly) and against work in
the reformist trade unions. Even at that time Lenin foresaw the
danger of neglecting the work in mass organizations like trade unions.
Before the Second Congress he published an article in No. 10 of the
C. I .: “Should Revolutionaries Work in Reactionary Trade Unions?”
and issued a booklet, Left-Wing Communism, an Infantile Disorder. In

both the article and the book (the article was included in the book as

Chapter 6, under the same title), Lenin sounds the alarm against the
“left” tendencies and feelings. First of all, the pamphlet was directed
against the Communist Labor Party in Germany, the Shop Steward
Movement in England, the revolutionary syndicalists, Bordiga and his

13

 
 
 

followers. The following years showed how far-seeing Lenin had been
in attacking this "left-wing sickness of Communism.” The Commu-
nist International and the Central Committees of the Communist
Parties have not yet sufﬁciently carried out the numerous decisions on
the work of Communists among the reformist, Catholic and Fascist
mass trade unions. Many revolutionary workers, including members
of the Communist Party, have been caught by the provocation of the
trade union bureaucrats, who do everything in their power to make
the work of the revolutionary elements in the trade unions impossible.
Instead of strengthening the work in the trade unions, the revolution-
ary workers left them wholesale, enabling the trade union bureaucrats
to carry these unions along the path of reformist treachery without
hindrance.

The ninth condition requires that the Parties entering the Commu-
nist International and those wishing to join it should “carry on sys-
tematic and persistent Communist work in the trade unions, in workers’
and industrial councils, co-operative societies and other mass organiza-
tions. It is necessary to organize Communist groups in these organiza-
tions which, by means of practical and stubborn work, must win over
the trade unions, etc., for the cause of Communism. These groups
should constantly denounce the treachery of the social-patriots and
the vacillations of the ‘center’ at every step. These Communist groups
should be completely subordinated to the Party in general.”

The tenth condition requires the struggle against the Amsterdam_
Trade Union International and support for g the “incipient interna-
tional alliance of Red trade unions aﬂiliated to the Communist Inter-
national.”

The eleventh condition was a particularly sore point for the leaders
of the Socialist Parties. All the activity of the Social-Democratic
Parties before the war, and also after, took place in and around Parlia-

- ment. All the Party leaders, the entire C.C., were in the parliamentary

fraction, the whole practice of which. was directed to collaboration
with the bourgeoisie. On the other hand, as mentioned above, at the
Second Congress there were representatives of sectarian tendencies
which spoke against work in Parliament. A number of delegates from
various countries-—France (Goldenberg, from the Youth League), Italy
(Bordiga), Great Britain (Gallacher), Germany (Suschi, a revolution-
ary syndicalist), Switzerland (Hertzog) spoke against the participation
of Communists in Parliament, against_ the utilization of the parlia-
mentary tribune (seven delegates voted against the resolution on “The
Communist Parties and Parliamentarism”) . On this question the Con-
gress carried on a struggle for the proper tactics on two fronts, con-

14

 

 

centrating the ﬁre upon the reformists and "centrists.” The eleventh
condition of admission is based on the recognition of the necessity of
utilizing the parliamentary tribune for really revolutionary propaganda
and agitation. All parties wishing to belong to the Third International
are obliged to revise the parliamentary fractions and remove from them
“unreliable elements, to control such fractions not only verbally, but
in reality to subordinate them to the Central Committee of the Party,
and to demand from every Comm-unist Member of Parliament that he
devote his entire activity to the interests of really revolutionary propa-
ganda.” The parliamentary politicians of those Parties which wished
to join the Communist International, fearing to lose their soft seats
in Parliament, did everything in their power to hinder their Parties
from joining the Communist International.

The twelfth condition deals entirely with the structure of the Party
on the principle of democratic "centralism.”

"At the present time of acute civil war, the Communist Party will
only be able fully to do its duty when it is organized in the most
centralized manner, if it has iron discipline bordering on military
discipline, and if the Party center is a powerful authoritative organ
with wide powers, possessing the general trust of the Party members.”

Many Parties wished to assure themselves “autonomy” in the Com-
munist International, like that which they had in the Second Inter-
national. We know that the Congresses of the Second International
could decide what they liked, but the various Parties could avoid
carrying these decisions out. Even now the resolutions passed by the
Second International are not compulsory on the organizations belong-
ing to it, and on" many occasions they are adopted with the full real-
ization that they will not be carried into practice, adopted merely for
the sake of form, to deceive the masses. g

But even inside the Parties themselves, the parliamentary fractions,
leaders, editors, public speakers, writers, etc., do not submit to the
decisions of their Congress, and still less to the decisions of their C.C.
The point on iron discipline, and “discipline bordering on military dis-
cipline,” naturally frightened away all such “lovers of freedom,” who
were accustomed to "space” such as is given by parties of the social-
democratic type, and these parties, in turn, were frightened away from
the Communist International. The history of the _last few years shows
that even among the parties which accepted the twenty-one conditions,
or which joined the Comintern even before the Second Congress, there
were leaders who did not wish to submit to the discipline of the Com-

15

intern, or the discipline of their own parties, as required by the twelfth
condition of acceptance into the Comintern.

The thirteenth condition is quoted at the head of this article. It
refers to the systematic cleansing of the Party from petty-bourgeois
elements which attach themselves to it. The Communist Parties have
not in a single country such legal conditions as the Social-Democratic
Parties had before the war. Up to the present, no section of the
Comintern carries on such periodical cleansings as that of the C.P.S.U.,
the only revolutionary and simultaneously absolutely legal Party and
Government Party. Cleansing from reformist and “centrist” elements
takes place in the sections of the Comintern in a different manner,
which will be dealt with later. ,

The fourteenth condition requires the parties wishing to join the
Communist International to "give every possible support to the Soviet
Republics in their struggle against all counter-revolutionary forces. The
Communist Parties should carry on a precise and" deﬁnite propaganda
to induce the workers to refuse to transport munitions of war intended
for enemies of the Soviet Republics, carry on legal or illegal propa-
ganda among the troops which are sent to crush the workers’ republics.”

During the war of Poland against the Soviet Union, the workers,
under the leadership, both of the Communist Party and of those par-
ties which really wished to join the Communist International, brought
about a stoppage of aid for the Denikins, Kolchaks and other White
Guard gangs, handicapped the transport of munitions, and in general
hindered the imperialists in giving aid to Poland, and struggled for the
recall of the interventionist troops from the Soviet Union.

The ﬁfteenth condition required the _parties joining the Comintern
to change their old programs, to work out "a new Communist pro-
gram in conformity with the special conditions of their country and in
accordance with the resolutions of the Communist International,” and
demanded that these programs should be presented for conﬁrmation
to the Communist International, a thing which the Second International
never demanded.

The sixteenth condition requires the parties which join the Commu-
nist International to submit‘ to the decisions of the Executive Com-
mittee, thus making the Comintern into a united world party, in con-
tradistinction to the Second Internatioal.

The seventeenth condition requires every party to take the name of
the Communist Party, Section of the Third Communist International:

“The question of the name is not only a formal one, but is a
political question of great importance. The "Communist Interna-

16



at-O?»

W:

W??-

tional has declared a decisive war against the entire bourgeois world
and all the yellow Social-Democratic Parties. Every rank and ﬁle
worker must clearly understand the diﬁerence between the Com-
munist Parties and the old oﬂicial ‘Social-Democratic’ or ‘Socialist’
Parties which have betrayed the cause of the working class.”

 

The eighteenth condition requires the leading printed organs of ‘the

Communist Parties of all countries to publish all the chief documents
of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.

The nineteenth condition demands that, not later than four months
after the Second Congress, the parties should call a special Congress

and that, before it was called, the local organizations should become

acquainted with the decisions of the Second Congress.

The twentieth condition requires that the Central Committees and
the chief institutions of the Party should consist to the extent of at least

‘two-thirds of comrades who, even before the Second Congress, had

"openly and deﬁnitely declared for joining the Third International.”

Finally, the twenty-ﬁrst condition says: "Members of the Party who
reject the conditions and theses of the Communist International on
principle must be expelled from the Party. This applies also to the
delegates of the special Party Congresses.” These special Party Con-
gresses were to discuss the question of joining the Third International.

Thus the Second Congress not only required the parties, which
wished to join the Communist International, to relinquish the old
social-democratic program in practice, tactics, organizational methods,
the old inter-relations between Party organizations and the fractions of
mass non-Party organizations, not only demanded the expulsion of the
old reformist and “centrist” leaders, of the parliamentarians, but that
the parties wishing to join the Comintern should expel those members
who rejected on principle the decisions and theses of the Communist
International and the conditions of admission. All this was done so
that the reformists and. centrist elements which were in the previous
Socialist Parties, so that the leaders who were compelled, under the
pressure of the masses, to join the Communist International, could not
remain in the Party with the aim of turning it into a party of the
ordinary social-democratic type, at a suitable moment.

The absolute correctness and the undoubted necessity of all this was
shown by the struggle which later took place in the Communist Par-
ties, when the reformist and centrist elements who remained in the
parties and who tried to carry on a struggle against the principles of
the program, tactics and organization of Bolshevism, were driven out

17

  

of the parties in accordance with the line laid down in the twenty-one
sonditions.

The twenty-one conditions of admission into the Communist Inter-
national were adopted at the Congress with only two delegates voting
against. '

What Was the Attitude of the Social-Democratic Parties
Seeking Admittance, to the Twenty-One Conditions?

The Italian Socialist Party, whose representatives at‘the Second Con-
gress of the Comintern voted for the twenty-one conditions, called a
Congress in Livorno in January, 1921. At this Congress the Com-
munists who proposed that the decisions of the Second Congress be
conﬁrmed entirely and without reservations received 58,000 votes.
Seratti, who stated at the Second Congress that the twenty-one condi-
tions were unsuitable for Italy; that the expulsion of the reformists from
the Party would mean a split to which he could not agree (Se.ratti and
his supporters in particular left the trade unions in the hands of the
reformists), received 96,000 votes at this Congress. The reformists
obtained 14,000 votes. Seratti, who based his centrist position on his
wish to avoid a split, drew the following conclusion from the distribu-
tion of votes at the Congress: He did not wish to struggle against
the reformists who received 14,000 votes, so he split with the Commu-
nists, who received 58,000 votes. The Communists left the Socialist
Party and organized the Communist Party.

There is nothing surprising in the fact that Seratti and his support-
ers followed the reformists at the Congress, as the Socialist Party of
Italy, on the eve of the Congress, at a decisive moment had shown in
practice that it did not stand for revolutionary methods of struggle
for the dictatorship of the proletariat. From August 27th to Septem-
ber 19th, 1920, the Italian workers seized the factories throughout all
Italy. The Socialist Party_ did not stand at the head of the move-
ment. Not only did it fail to organize immediate support for this
revolutionary action of the proletariat, but throughout the country it
tried its utmost to crush it. At that time the Communists had not
their own party. They only constructed it after the January Congress
in 1921. However, the seizure of the factories by the workers could
have served as the starting point for a victorious proletarian revolu-
tion if, at that moment, the vanguard of the proletariat had been
organized as a Communist Party. The situation which arose at that
time as the result of the occupation of the factories in 1920 was de-
scribed as follows by Bonomi, the Prime Minister of Italy, in his
reminiscences Del Sozializmd e alel Fascizma.

18

 

 

“Finally, in September, 1920, it seemed that the time had come
for the Italian Socialists to be bold [he is speaking of the seizure of
the factories]. This was the culminating point in the development
of revolutionary Socialism, the only great revolutionary experiment
tested simultaneously throughout all Italy. But it was defeated
owing to causes which will astonish future historians, namely: the
movement was victorious and unresisted. It did not meet with any
difficulties in its path. This movement had not the boldness to take
on itself the initiative of attacking and winning political power, and
limited itself merely to occupying the factories, expecting that capi-
talist economy would capitulate to the Red Flag waving along its
front. A few days later the movement exhausted itself in its own
impotence.”

In these words we ﬁnd the admission by the class enemy that, if the
Socialist Party of Italy had been really revolutionary and taken the
lead of this movement, giving it the necessary scope, it could have
led to an armed revolt and. the seizure of power, as the government
power in Italy was shattered and very weak at that time.

At the conference of the three internationals which took place in
April, 1923, Seratti was present as the representative of the Socialist
Party of Italy, which had not joined any of the three internationals
existing at that time. ' '

In October, 1922, before the Fascists came to power, the Italian
Socialist Party split at the Rome Congress. The supporters of Seratti
received 32,000 votes, while the reformists increased the number of
their votes to 29,000 (a year previously the.reformists had received
only 14,000 votes). Thus, at the time the Fascists came to power in
Italy, there were three parties which arose from the Socialist Party of
Italy—the Communist Party, the Maximalist Party (supporters of
Seratti) and the Reformist Party. After the Fascists came to power
in Italy, in reality only the Communist Party continued to exist, as the
other two parties gave up their existence in Italy itself while the most
prominent reformists (D’Arragona and Co.) went over to the Fascists.
It is known that recently the German social-fascists followed the ex-
ample of D’Arragona and handed over the trade unions to the Fascists,
just as he did.

In August, 1924, Seratti and some of his followers returned to the
Comintern, having joined the Italian Communist Party. This took
place after he had become convinced that his refusal to accept the
twenty-one conditions put forward by the Comintern had deprived the
Italian proletariat of Bolshevik leadership at the decisive moment, and

19

    

    

Into the Communist International’?
By 0; PIATNITSKY

"The Communist Parties of those countries where the Commu-
nist activity is legal should make periodical cleansing: (re-registra-
tions) of the members of the Party organizations, so as to sys-
tematically cleanse the Party from the petty-bourgeois elements
who inevitably attach themselves to it.” (Point 13 of the Condi-
tions of Admission into the Comintern.)

EFORE the war, the social-democratic parties and reformist trade

unions comprised the Second International. In the developed capi-
talist countries, both the social-democratic parties and the reformist trade
unions were mass organizations, with millions of members. Since they
were parties formed of a bloc of proletarian and, petty-bourgeois inter-
ests which gratiﬁed the petty-bourgeois social-nationalists and the social-
chauvinists, the Second International, in adapting itself to the moods
of the revolutionary workers, found itself compelled to pass resolutions
against war at its international congresses (Stuttgart, Basle).

In these resolutions it stated that it would be a crime on the part
of the workers to participate in the bourgeois war which was in pre-
paration, and gave warning that this war would lead to a proletarian
revolution. In some countries, the social-democratic parties before the
war carried on quite an intensive verbal campaign against war, publish-
ing articles on the subject, calling mass meetings, appealing for peace,
and against war; while just before the war itself they organized protest
meetings and demonstrations. The workers believed that the social-
democratic parties and the trade unions really intended to struggle
against war, and would carry it on. But when the war broke out, all
the social-democratic parties, and trade unions went over to the side of
their imperialisms openly, helping to drive the workers and peasants
to the front, to increase the exploitation of the toilets and mercilessly
crush the slightest manifestation of the class struggle of the proletariat.

" Adopted at the Second Congress of the Communist International held in Moscow,

July 17th to August 7th, 1920. The full text of these Conditions is printed in the
Appendix of this pamphlet beginning on page 27.

The Tiwenty-One Conditions of Admission’

had thus caused the defeat of the proletarian revolution in Italy for
a number of years. i

The Congress of the Socialist Party of France took place on Decem-
ber 25th, 1920, in Tours. The vast majority of the Congress voted for
joining the Communist International. Of the party leaders of that
time, Cachin, Frossard, and Daniel Renault remained. The right
leaders Renaudel, Blum, Faure, Longuet, .etc., split away and organized
the Socialist Party.

In autumn, 1920, there was the Congress of the German Independent
Social-Democratic Party. The overwhelming majority were in favor
of accepting the twenty-one conditions, and all the decisions of the
Communist International. Among the party leaders who were present
at the Second Congress of the Comintern, Daumig and Stoecker went
with the majority. This majority of “Independents” joined with the
Communist Party of Germany. As for the minority of “Independents,”
they continued to exist for a short time as an Independent Party, but
soon returned to the fold of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany.
Crispien and Dittmann, who were also present at the Second Congress,
quietly went over to the old Social-Democratic Party, which suitably
estimated their counter-revolutionary services, and even put them in
its Central Committee.

The I.L. P. of Great Britain did not join the Comintern. It re-
turned to the Second International. As part of the Labor Party,lit
shared the “fate” of the latter. Together with the Labor Party, at
the decisive moment of 1926 it betrayed the general strike, and later
the miners’ strike. Together with the La-bor Party, it afterwards be-
trayed the interests of the working class through the first and second
Labor governments. Very recently, when the crisis greatly affected the
economic situation of the British working class, when the British
workers began to get more radical, under the inﬂuence of the growing
crisis and increasing poverty and unemployment, striking and organ-
izing big unemployed demonstrations, the members of the I. L. P. began
to respond to the call of the Communists for the formation of a united
front of struggle against the capitalist offensive, fascism and the war
danger. The I.L. P. again left the Second International and under
the pressure of its members is again negotiating with the Communist
International regarding assistance in its struggle against the bour-
geoisie, both in Great Britain and on an international scale. There
can be no doubt that the leaders of the I. L. P. are using ‘every effort
to drag out the negotiations in the hope that the crisis will soon "end,

» and they will be able to return once more to the Labor Party and the

20

 

 

Second International. The future will show whether the members of
the I. L. P. will follow their leaders a second time.

Although the representatives of the Norwegian Labor Party voted
at the Second Congress for accepting the twenty-one conditions, they
did not greatly hurry to carry them into practice. Tranmel and Co.,
the leaders of this party, waited for the revolutionary tide to fall and
sought a convenient opportunity to split with the Communist Inter-
national. ~

The Norwegian Labor Party regarded itself as part of a general
federative international organization and was against democratic cen-
tralism, and the Comintern discipline. In reply to all the demands of
the E:.C. of the Comintern to change the name of the central organ
of this party (it was called the Social-Democrat), no satisfactory reply
was received. The Norwegian Labor Party continued to build its
organization on the basis of collective membership, just as before enter-

ing the Communist International. The trade unions in toto.were mem-'

bers of the Norwegian Labor Party, and this is still the case.

The Norwegian Labor Party in practice collaborated with the bour-
geoisie. It supported the liberal ministry, in spite of the protests of
the Comintern. Therefore a split became inevitable. After this split,
an independent Communist Party of Norway was organized.

How the Communist Parties Cleansed Themselves from
Reformists and "Centrists” on the Basis of the
Twenty-One Points

During the whole of their existence, the sections of the Comintern
have carried on a struggle in their own ranks for Bolshevization, the
growing soundness of their programs, tactical and organizational prin-
ciples, against all kinds of opportunism in theory and practice, against
all deviations and a conciliatory attitude towards them, and have
cleansed and are cleansing their ranks from petty-bourgeois elements,
on the basis of the principles set out in the twenty-one conditions.

We give here a few examples of such an actual cleansing of the
ranks of the sections of the Comintern from old leaders, who con-
cealed their social-democratic essence, but exposed themselves at de-
cisive moments, when‘ the Party passed on to more determined methods
of struggle in accordance with the changed situation. '

The Secretary of the Socialist Party of France, Frossard, who was
at the Second Congress of the Comintern and at the Congress of the
Socialist Party in Tours, voted for this party to join the Communist
International. He remained in the Party until 1923. Under the
cover of left phrases, at one time he spoke against the tactic of the

21

  

united front, and then advocated unity with the Social-Democratic
Parties. He opposed the carrying out of one of the twenty-one points,
on the subordination of the Party press to the C.C., regarding this
as an expression of “barrack regime in the Party.” When the Com-
intern demanded that the newspaper Journal de Peuple, which was
edited by Fabre, a warm supporter of Frossard, should be submitted
to the control of the C.C. of the Party, Frossard ﬁnally exposed him-
self, split with‘ the Communist Party, and after a short existence as an
“independent” Socialist, returned to the Socialist Party, where he is
now in the extreme right wing, together with Renaudel.

Paul Levi, who at the Second Congress, under the_ cover of left
phrases, was against the acceptance of the “independents” into the
Comintern, acted as a reformist and opportunist in 1921 in the March
events. He was expelled from the Party and soon_ drifted into the
Social-Democratic Party of Germany.

Daumig, who assisted in the adoption of the twenty-one conditions
by the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, left the
Party after the March events in 1921.

I-Ioglund, the leader of the left Swedish Social-Democratic Party,
like the Norwegian Labor Party -and its leader Tranmel, sought for
an excuse to leave the Communist International. When the Comintern
put before him, in a decisive form, the necessity for a real struggle
against the Swedish Social-Democratic Party and opportunism inside
the Communist Party of Sweden, the necessity for a struggle against
paciﬁsm, Hoglund and his few supporters stated that they would not
submit to these decisions, and were expelled from the Comintern
(August, 1924). Hoglund and his supporters at first prided them-
selves on their “independence,” but quieted down and returned to the
fold of the Social-Democratic Party.

Kilbom and some other leaders of the Communist Party of Sweden
displayed their social-democratic essence much later, after the Tenth
Plenum, when the Comintern pointed out to the Swedish and other
sections the necessity of carrying on a more direct and determined
struggle, in connection with the new conditions, against the Rights and
against a conciliatory attitude towards them, and to carry out the
tactic of class against class in practice. Kilbom and Co. supported the
Brandlerites and did not agree with the decisions of the Sixth Congress
and the Tenth Plenum, and made up their minds to split. Conceal-
ing themselves beneath a “loyal” attitude to the Comintern, they tried
to seize the newspaper and the property of the Party, to strengthen
their position in the struggle against the Comintern and its Swedish
section, and leave the Communist International. They did not suc-

22

 

 

 

ceed in this. They met with decided opposition from the Party mem-
bers in the local Party organizations, and were expelled from the
Party. Now they differ very little from the Social-Democratic Party
of Sweden. '

The "left” Bordiga, who at the Second Congress opposed the ac-
ceptance of the German _“Independent_” Social-Democrats and the
French Socialist Party into the Comintern, opposed the use of the
parliamentary tribune, and the tactic of the united front, soon drifted
from this "left” sectarianism into right opportunism. Returning from
exile he split with the Party, and now works as .an engineer in Italy
under the Fascist regime.

Brandler, Thalheimer and Walcher, ex-Spartacists, showed them-
selves as opportunists when they let slip the revolutionary situation in
Germany in 1923. They were then removed "from the leadership and
later (Thalheimer and others) from German work owing to their
factional struggle. In general they continued to insist on their mis-
takes, to deepen them, and, after the Sixth Congress, they were ex-
pelled from the Communist Party of Germany for opposition to the
tactic of class against class, the independent conducting of the eco-
nomic struggle, the organization of the trade union opposition in the
trade unions, and the estimate of the Sixth Congress of the instability
of the temporary stabilization. -The handful of opportunists who
followed them joined with the “left” social-democrats, Seidewitz and
Co., who had left the Social-Democratic Party of Germany, and
formed the so-called Social-Democratic Labor Party, which has now
completely disappeared from the political horizon since the Fascist
coup d’eta't.

The Czecho-Slovakian Social-Democratic Party by a majority de-
cided to join the Comintern. The minority remained in the Czecho-

‘Slovakian Socialist Party. But for a number of years the Communist

Party of Czecho-Slovakia was incapable of liberating itself from its
social-democratic past, and did not carry out the twenty-one conditions
in practice. It remained passive and incapable of the mass revolu-
tionary struggle. However, fresh forces matured in the Party, capable
of putting forward new leaders and beginning the Bolshevization of the
Party. In 1929, when conducting the "Red Day,” the Party leaders
ﬁnally exposed themselves to the Party masses as incapable of organ-
izing and carrying on the mass revolutionary struggle. The leaders
boastfully stated from the parliamentary tribune and in the press that
the “Red Day” would be held, even if it were prohibited. But when
it was really prohibited, the Party leaders hid themselves, although the
masses came on to the streets without receiving leadership from the

23

    

C.C. and the Prague District Committee. This gave the signal for
a campaign to start against the opportunist leadership.

After this disgraceful collapse of the "Red Day,” the active Party
members, with the help of the Comintern, brought about a determined
change in the practice of the Party. A number of opportunists, Mem-
bers of Parliament, were expelled from the Party—and many deserted
themselves. The opportunists who had dug themselves into the lead-
ership of the Red trade unions tried to split the Red trade unions, in
which the Communist Party of Czecho-Slovakia had great inﬂuence.
The previous leaders tried to emaciate the Party, seizing the newspapers,
printing plants and property of the Party. But the revolutionary work-
ers, the Party members, put‘ forward new leaders, enlivened the Party
organizations and for several years have carried on economic and po-
litical strikes, utilizing the parliamentary tribune for revolutionary
speeches. The Party press is becoming the agitator of revolutionary
action, and the organizer of the masses. Whereas previously, under
the opportunist leadership, the government did not touch the Com-
munist press, did not close down the Party papers, at the present time
a censorship has been introduced on our press and even Members of

Parliament are arrested and tried. The number of members of the.

Party. which fell from 150,000 to 27,000 in 1930, has risen already to

80,000, while the Red trade unions are ﬁghting and increasing their A

membership. In the course of the struggle against opportunism, and
the cutting oi’f of these unreliable opportunist elements, the Commu-
nist Party of Czecho-Slovakia strengthened its ranks, improved its
revolutionary activity and strengthened its position in the working class.

The carrying on of the tactic of class against class, which was em-
phasized by the Eighth Plenum of the Comintern, assisted the French

section of the Comintern, as mentioned above, to cleanse itself from.

unstable opportunist and right elements, for whom election agreements
with the left bourgeois and Socialist Parties were more important than
the tactics and program of the Communist Party. But in England,
when the Communist Party, which did not previously put forward its
own candidates for Parliament, but supported the candidates of the
Labor Party, began to put forward its own candidates in the chief

industrial districts, when the minority movement began to organize

independent strikes despite the trade union bureaucrats, many oppor-
tunist elements which called themselves Communists left the Party,
or were la-ter expelled for their anti-Party conduct. The Communist
Parties cleansed themselves of counter.-revolutionary and Trotskyist ele-
ments, from all the Rosmers, Trients, Urbans, Nins, etc.

24

Thus a cleansing takes ‘place in the Communist Parties, which, in
A reality, are semi-legal, because in no country, not even in England, is
g the Communist Party really legal, having the possibility of publishing
what It likes and calling for demonstrations or strikes.

“Only the Communist Party, if it is really the vanguard of the
revolutionary class, if it includes all the best representatives of this
class, if it consists ofcfully conscientious and loyal Communists, edu-
cated and steeled by the experience of stubborn revolutionary strug-
gle, if this Party has succeeded in linking itself iindissolubly with
p the life of its class and through it with all the exploited masses and

creating complete conﬁdence among this class and these masses, only
1 such a Party is capable of leading the proletariat in the most merci-
= less and decisive ﬁnal struggle against all the forces of capitalism.
On the other hand, only under the leadership of such a Party can
the proletariat develop all the power of its revolutionary onslaught.”

. (Resolution on the basic tasks of the Communist International, Sec-
tion 1, par. 4.)

There are already_ such Communist Parties in the capitalist countries.

The Communist Party of Germany has shown in practice that it not
_ only rapidly adapts itself to unusually difficult illegal conditions, but it
 has not lost contact with the masses. The Communist Party alone has
i preserved and rapidly restored the local Party organizations, which were
3 destroyed by the Fascists from top to bottom. It has not lost con-
tacts with the mass non-Party organizations and, through them, with
the working masses. The Communist Party of Germany not only
publishes literature, but it holds demonstrations and leads strikes. It
is a center of attraction, mobilization and organization for everything
which is revolutionary and growing in the working class of Germany.
And never was its moral political authority among the working masses
, so high as at the present time. _
5 The Communist Party of Bulgaria, in the kingdom of bloody Fas-
g cist terror, carries with it the majority of the workers of Bulgaria. It
l has great inﬂuence in the villages, and carries on work in the army.
The military state of siege and the terror cannot destroy this inﬂuence.
l The Communist Party of Poland, which ﬁrmly resists the blows of
' fascism and tirelessly exposes the "left” tricks of the Polish Socialist
Party, leads the struggle of the Polish proletariat in the factories and
the struggle of the unemployed. It stands at the head of the struggle
I of the peasants not only in West Ukraine and West White Russia,
5 but in Poland proper. It is linked up with the great masses of the
proletariat, and the poor of the villages.

25'

 
 

 

The Communist Party of China, in spite of the unprecedented terror
(execution for distributing proclamations), issues an enormous amount
of propagandist and agitational literature. It organizes and leads the

strike struggle, heads the mass movement directed against Japanese

imperialism, and appears before the masses as the only force capable of
struggling for the independence of China against imperialist oppres-
sion. The Communist Party of China leads the Soviet districts, where
the Soviet power is established in practice on a large territory. It is
building and strengthening the Red Army of China.

The Communist Party of Japan, since the first days of the war
against China, is endeavoring to carry out the Leninist position in the
struggle against war. In spite of severe persecution and repression,
espionage and provocation, the vacillations and treachery of individual
intellectuals—leaders of the Communist Party, it is widening its inﬂu-
ence on the organized and unorganized workers, among the peasants
and the petty bourgeoisie. All the subtle and cunning struggle against
"dangerous thoughts” was found helpless in isolating the Communist
Party from the masses, or bringing disruption into its ranks. The Jap-
anese bourgeoisie try to destroy the imprisoned Communists, leaving
them to rot in prison, but the working class puts forward new cadres
of ﬁghters and organizers of the struggle.

There are not a few such really ﬁghting Communist Parties in the"
Communist International. In the second cycle of wars and revolu-«

tions, the working class will not be under the leadership of treacherous
social-democracy, as in 1918-19. The Communist Parties, armed with

the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, steeled in the struggle_

and with ranks cleared of opportunists of all kinds, will lead the work-
ing class to victory.

CONDITIONSIOF ADMISSION INTO THE COMMUNIST
INTERNATIONAL

The First Inaugural Congress of the Communist International did
not draw up precise conditions for the admission of separate parties
to the Third International. At the time the First Congress was con-
vened there were only Communist trends and groups in the majority
of countries.

The Second World Congress of the Communist International has
met under different conditions. There are now in most countries not
only Communist trends and tendencies, but Communist Parties and
organizations.

The Communist International is now more and more often receiv-
ing applications from parties and groups which, but a short time ago,
belonged to the Second International and now desire to join the Third
International, but which have not really become Communist organiza-
tions. The Second International has completely collapsed. The inter-
mediary parties and groupsof the “Center,” realizing that the Second
International is utterly hopeless, are trying to lean upon the Commu-
nist International, which is growing ever stronger; at the same time,
however, they hope to preserve such “autonomy” as would enable them
to pursue their former opportunist or "Centrist” policy. The Commu-
nist International is, to a certain degree, becoming the fashion.

The desire of some of the leading groups of the “Center” to join
the Third International is an indirect conﬁrmation of the fact that
the Communist International has gained the sympathy of the over-
whelming majority of the class-conscious workers of the whole world,
and that it is becoming a greater and greater force every day.

Under certain circumstances, the -Communist International may be
threatened with the danger of ‘dilution by wavering, vacillating groups
that have not yet abandoned the ideology of the Second International.

Moreover, in some of the large parties (Italy, Sweden, Norway,
Yugoslavia and others), the majority of whose members adopt the
Communist point of view, there still remains a considerable reformist
and social-pacifist wing, which is only waiting for the opportune mo-
ment to lift its head again, to begin an active sabotage of the prole-

27

    

tarian revolution, and thus help the bourgeoisie and the Second In-
ternational. .

No Communist should forget the lessons of the Hungarian Soviet
Republic. The alliance between the Hungarian Communists and the
so-called “Left” social-democrats cost the Hungarian proletariat dear.

Hence, the Second World Congress of the Communist International
considers it necessary to lay down the most precise conditions for the
admission of new parties, and also to point out to those parties which
have already been accepted as members of the Communist Interna-
tional, the obligations that rest upon them.

The Second Congress of the Communist International resolves that
the conditions for membership in the Communist International shall be
as follows:

1. The daily propaganda and agitation must bear a truly Com-
munist character and correspond to the program and all the decisions
of the Third International. All the organs of the press that are in
the hands of the Party must be edited by reliable Communists who
have proved their loyalty to the cause of the proletarian revolution. The
dictatorship of the "proletariat should not be spoken of simply as a
current hackneyed formula; it ‘should be advocated in such a way that
its necessity should be apparent to every rank-and-ﬁle working man and
woman, each soldier and peasant and should emanate from the facts
of everyday life systematically recorded by our press day after day.

The periodical and non-periodical press and all Party publishing or-
ganizations must be wholly subordinate to the Central Committee of
the Party, irrespective as to whether the Party as a whole, at the given
moment, is legal or illegal. That publishing organizations, abusing their
autonomy, should pursue a policy that does not completely correspond to
the policy of the Party, cannot be tolerated.

In the columns of the newspapers, at public meetings, in the trade
unions, in the co-operativq societies—wherever the adherents of the
Third International gain access, they must systematically and mercilessly
denounce not only the bourgeoisie, but also its assistants, the reform-
ists of every shade.

2. Every organization desiring to belong to the Communist Inter-
national must steadily and systematically remove from all responsible
posts in the Labor movement in the Party organization, editorial boards,
trade unions, parliamentary fractions, co-operative societies, munici-
palities, etc., all reformists and followers of the “Center,” and have
them replaced by ‘ Communists even at the cost of replacing at the
beginning, “experienced” leaders by rank-and-ﬁle working-men.

28

    

3. The class struggle in almost all the countries of Europe and
America is entering the phase of civil war. Under such conditions the
Communists can have no conﬁdence in bourgeois law. They must
everywhere create a parallel illegal apparatus, which at the decisive
moment could assist -the Party in performing its duty to the revolution.
In all countries where, in consequence of martial law or exceptional laws,
the Communists are unable to carry on all their work legally, a com-
bination of legal and illegal work is absolutely necessary.

4. The obligation to spread Communist ideas includes the particular
necessity of persistent, systematic propaganda in the army. Wherever
such propaganda is forbidden by exceptional laws, it must be carried
on illegally. The abandonment of such work would be equivalent to
the betrayal of revolutionary duty and is incompatible with membership
in the Third International.

5. It is necessary to carry on systematic and steady agitation in the
rural districts. The working class cannot consolidate its victory without
the backing of at least part of the agricultural laborers and the poorest

peasants, and without having neutralized, by its policy, a part of the -

rest of the rural population. Communist work in the rural districts is
acquiring a predominant importance during the present period. It
should be carried on in the main, by revolutionary Communist workers
of both city and country only, who have connections with the rural dis-
tricts. To refuse to do this work or to transfer such work to untrust-
worthy half-reformists is equal to renouncing the proletarian revolution.

6. Every party that desires to belong to the Third International
must expose, not only open social patriotism, but also the falsity and
hypocricy of social-paciﬁsm; it must systematically demonstrate to the
workers that without the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, no
international arbitration courts, no disarmament, no “democratic” re-
organization of the League of Nations will save mankind from new
imperialist wars.

7. The Parties desiring to belong to the Communist International
must recognize the necessity of a complete and absolute rupture ‘with
reformism and the policy of the “Center,” and they must carry on
propaganda in favor of this rupture among the «broadest circles of the
party membership. Otherwise a consistent Communist policy is im-
possible. '

The Communist International unconditionally and peremptorily de-
mands that this split -be brought about with the least delay. The Com-
munist International cannot reconcile itself to the fact that such avowed
reformists, as Turatti, Kautsky, Hilferding, Hillquit, Longuet, Mac-
Donald, Modigliani, and others should be entitled to consider them-

29

Such open treachery, on the part of the parties of the Second Interna-
tional, could not but rouse indignation, not merely among the great
working masses, but also the lower activists of the parties and trade
unions.

The February revolution in Russia, the organization of Soviets of
Workers’, Peasants’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, the rise of soldiers’ com-
mittees at the rear and the front, the widest and most fearless agitation
against imperialist war carried on by the Bolsheviks, the fraternizing
which they organized at the fronts, plainly showed the toilets of the
whole world how it was possible and necessary to struggle against their
bourgeoisie, even in war-time. The slogan of the Bolsheviks, on the
conversion of imperialist war into civil war, met with a wide response
throughout the world.

The October Revolution, which overthrew the power of the land-
lords and the bourgeoisie, and showed the revolutionary way out of
imperialist war in practice, produced a stupendous impression on the
masses of workers and soldiers. These masses not only began to see
the deception of the -bourgeoisie and the social-democratic parties more
clearly, but they also saw the actual possibility of struggling against
them, and the bourgeois State, as a whole.

The imperialist peace showed to the masses that all the promises
of the bourgeoisie and the social-democrats during the imperialist war
were false and hypocritical. The bourgeoisie and their agents, the social-
dernocrats, had promised that the war would bring an improvement in
the situation of the workers and peasants; social insurance; even the
abolition of exploitation; equal rights to oppressed peoples, etc.,
that "the country would never forget its heroes”. In reality, after the
horrors of the front, the workers and peasants were awaited by exploita-
tion and oppression at the rear, poverty and degradation and a bandit
peace as a continuation of the bandit war. The bourgeoisie of all coun-
tries threw themselves against the victorious proletarian revolution in
Russia, and began armed intervention against the U.S.S.R.

All this heightened the revolutionary activity of the working masses
in general, especially the workers in the social-democratic parties and
the reformist trade unions. The demand for organization immediately
after the war evoked an unprecedented flow of workers into the trade
unions. (Before the war the German trade unions had 2,250,000
members, immediately after the war 8,000,000; in Great Britain the
number of trade union members increased from 4,500,000 to 6,500,000;
in France from 400,000 to 2,000,000; in Italy from 400,000 to 2,000,-
000; in America from 2,000,000 to 4,000,000.) The workers demanded
that the trade unions organize a struggle to redeem the bourgeois prom-

3

 

 

selves members of the Third International. This would make the Third
International resemble, to a considerable degree, the late Second In-
ternational. N
8. On the question of the colonies and oppressed» nationalities an
especially distinct and clear line must be taken by the parties in those
countries where the bourgeoisie possesses colonies or oppresses other
nations. Every party desirous of belonging to the Third International
must ruthlessly denounce the methods of “their own” imperialists in

the colonies, supporting, not in words, but in deeds, every independence-

movement in the colonies. It should demand the expulsion of their own
imperialists from such colonies, and cultivate among the workers of
their own country a truly fraternal attitude towards the toiling popula-
tion of the colonies and oppressed nationalities, and carry on systematic
agitation in its own army against every kind of oppression of the
colonial population.

9. Every party that desires to belong to the Communist International
must carry on systematic and persistent Communist work in the trade

' unions in workers’-« and industrial councils in the co-o erative societies,
7 7

and in other mass organizations. Within these organizations it is neces-
sary to create Communist groups, which by means of practical and
stubborn work must win over the trade unions, etc., for the cause of
Communism. These cells should constantly‘ denounce the treachery of
the social-patriots and the vacillations of the “Center,” at every step.
These Communist groups should be completely‘ subordinate to the
Party as a whole.

10. Every party that belongs to the Communist International must

carry on a stubborn struggle against the Amsterdam “International” of

yellow trade unions. It must persistently propagate among the organized
workers the necessity of a rupture with the yellow Amsterdam Inter-
national. It must give all the support in its power to the incipient
international alliance of the Red trade unions aﬂiliated to the Com-
munist International.

11. The parties desiring to belong to the Third International must
overhaul the membership of their parliamentary fractions, eliminate all
unreliable elements from them, to control these fractions, not only
verbally but in reality, to subordinate them to the Central Committee
of the Party, and demand from every Communist member of parliament
that he devote his entire activities to the interests of really revolutionary
propaganda and agitation.

12. Parties belonging to the Communist International must be built
up on the principle of democratic centrfrlism. At the present time of
acute civil war, the Communist Party will only be able fully to do its

30

 

 

duty when it _is organized in the most centralized manner, if it has
iron discipline, bordering on military discipline, and if the Party center
is a powerful, authoritative organ with wide powers, possessing the
general trust of the party membership. -

13. The Communist parties of those countries where the Com-
munists’ activity is legal shall make periodical cleanings (re-registration)
of the members of the Party organizations, so as to systematically
cleanse the party from the petty-bourgeois elements who inevitably
attach themselves to it.

14. Every party that desires to belong to the Communist Inter-
national must give every possible support to the Soviet Republics in their
struggle against all counter-revolutionary forces. The Communist parties
should carry on a precise and deﬁnite propaganda to induce the workers
to refuse to transport munitions of war intended for enemies of the
Soviet Republics, carry on legal or illegal propaganda among the troops,
which are sent to crush the workers’ republics, etc.

15. The parties which up to the present have retained their old
Social-Democratic programs must in the shortest possible time overhaul
these programs and draw up a new Communist program in conformity
with the special conditions of their respective countries and in accordance
with resolutions of the Communist International. As a rule, the prog-
ram of every party that belongs to the Communist International must
be ratiﬁed by the next Congress of the Communist International or by
the Executive Committee. In the event of the Executive Committee
of the Communist International failing to ratify the program of a par-
ticular party, that party has the right to appeal to the Congress of the
Communist International.

16. All decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International,
as well as the decisions of its Executive Committee, are binding on all
parties afﬁliated to the Communist International. The Communist In-
ternational, operating in the midst of most acute civil war, must have
a far more centralized form of organization than that of the Second
International. At the same time, the Communist International and its
Executive Committee must, of course, in all their activities, take into
consideration the diversity of the conditions under which the various
parties have to work .and fight, and should issue universally binding
decisions only on questions on which the passing of such decisions is
possible.

17. In connection with all this, all parties desiring to join the Com-
munist International must change their names. Every party that desires
to join the Communist International must bear the name: Communist

31

Party of such-and-such country (Section of the Third, Communist In-
ternational) . This question as to name is not merely a formal one,
but a political one of great importance. The Communist International
has declared a decisive war against the entire bourgeois world and all
the yellow, Social-Democratic parties. Every rank-and-ﬁle worker must
clearly understand theidifierence between the Communist Parties and
the old oﬂicial “Social-Democratic” or “Socialist” parties which have be-
trayed the cause of the working class. _

18. All the leading Party organs of the press in all countries must
publish all the chief. documents of the Executive Committee of the
Communist International. __

19. All parties belonging to the Communist International, or having
made an application to join it, must, in the shortest possible period,
but not later than four months after the Second Congress of the Com-I
munist International, call special Party congresses, for the purpose of
discussing these obligations. In this connection, the Central Committees
must take measures to enable all the local organizations to become
acquainted with the decisions of the Second Congress -of the Com-
munist International.

20. The parties that would now like to join the Third International
but which have not yet radically changed their former tactics, must,
before joining, take steps to ensure that their Central Committees and
all most important central «bodies of the respective parties, shall be
composed, to the extent of at least two-thirds, of such comrades as even
prior to the Second Congress of the Communist International have open-
ly and deﬁnitely declared for joining the Third International. Excep-
tions may be made with approval of the Executive Committee of the
Third International. The Executive Committee of the Communist
the representatives of the “Center” mentioned in point 7.

21. Members of the Party, who reject the conditions and theses of
the Communist International, on principle, must be expelled from the
party.

This applies also to the delegates to the special Party Congresses.

ises, given during the war. The members of the social-democratic parties
demanded that their party leaders immediately split from the Second
International, which had betrayed the working class in such a criminal
manner. Under the pressure of the workers, social-democracy was com-
pelled to avoid interfering with the workers when they organized the
struggle against anti-Soviet intervention, particularly against the sending
of munitions to Poland which had attacked the Soviet Union. The
social-democratic workers demanded that their parties join the Third

 

International, the initiative in the formation of which "had been taken‘

by the Bolsheviks of the Soviet Union, led by Lenin.

Under this pressure of the workers, and with the object of avoiding
complete isolation from the masses, one social‘-democratic party after
another "adopted a decision to leave the Second International. As the
result of a unanimous decision of its Congress, the Swiss Social-Demo-
cratic Party left the Second International. The Congress of the Inde-
pendent Social-Democratic Party of Germany also made a decision to
withdraw from membership. At the end of January, 1920, at the
Strassburg Congress, the French Socialist Party broke with the Second
International (4,200 for leaving, against only 337 votes). The Nor-
wegian Social-Democratic Labor Party, the American S.L.P., the Bul-
garian S.D.P. (“Tesniaki”), the Italian Socialist Party, the Interna-
tional of Youth, the British I.L.P., all deserted the decaying Second
International. Even the Russian social-democrats, the Mensheviks, on
March ,10th, 1920, resolved to leave the sinking ship of the Second
International, although, as is well known, -they had supported the bour-
geoisie, in carrying on the imperialist war, collaborated with them in the
Provisional Government, tried to save them from proletarian revolution,
at first disorganizing the forces of the working class, and then, during
the October days, trying to drown the armed insurrection of the work-
ers in blood and ﬁnally, after the victory of the revolution, organizing
sabotage and counter-revolutionary attacks on the Soviet power and
participating in imperialist intervention and armed attacks on the Soviet
Union. Even these contemptible lackeys of foreign imperialism, who
had fallen so low that it would seem they had nothing more to lose,
preferred to abandon the decaying Second International, at any rate,
in words. ’

The Strivings of the Revolutionary Workers’ Organizations
Towards the Third Qommunist International

At the first Congress, when the Third Communist International was
founded in March, 1919, only a small number of representatives of

4

the revolutionary workers’ organizations of capitalist countries were
present, owing to armed intervention and the blockade of the Soviet
Union. And the very parties which took part in the Congress, with
the exception, of course, of the Communist Party of Russia, were still
very small, and had only just been formed. At this first Congress, the
following took part: C. P. Russia; C. P. Germany, C. P. German-
Austria, Hungary, the Swedish left S. D. Party, the Norwegian S. D.
Party, the opposition Swiss S. D. Party, the American S. L. P., the
Bulgarian “Tesniaki”, the C.P.’s of Poland, Finland, Ukraine, Latvia,
Lithuania, White Russia, Esthonia, Armenia and the Communists of
what is now the German Volga Republic. _

In the interval between the first and second Congress, the Communist
International was joined by the Italian Socialist Party, the Swedish
League of Youth, -the C.P. of East Galicia, the Socialist Party of
Alsace-Lorraine, the Ukrainian Federation of Socialist Parties, and a
number of Finnish organizations in America, the British Socialist Party,
the Bavarian Independent Party, part of the Danish Social-Democrats,
the Communist organizations of Bohemia, Lorraine and Mexico, the
International Congress of working youth at which there were delegates
from 220,000 members, the Scottish Labor Party. The Congress of the
Swedish S. D. Party adopted a decision to join the Communist Interna-
tional. A large number of local organizations of the French Socialist
Party decided to enter the Communist International. At the Strass-
burg Congress of the Socialist Party of France, a resolution to join the
Communist International obtained 1,621 votes out of 4,667.

The following conﬁrmed their adhesion to the Third International:
the Congress of the Italian Socialist Party in Bologna, the Congress of
the Norwegian Socialist Labor Party, the Conference of the Left

Swedish S. D. Party, the Congress of the Bulgarian S. D. Party—i

“Tesniaki”, the Polish Communis-t Party, the Congress of Socialists of
the U.S.A. At the Congress of the Spanish Socialist Party, 12,500
votes were cast for joining the Communist International (against 14,000
for remaining in the Second International). At the Scandinavian

' Workers’ Congress in December, 1919, at which there were 268 dele-

gates from 300,000 workers, the Communist resolutions were adopted
unanimously. 0

In the Austrian Social-Democratic Party there was also formed a
working association of revolutionary social-democrats of Austria, which
struggled in the committees for the Soviet dictatorship and adhesion
to the Third International. They sent greetings to the Second Con-
gress of the Comintern. Even at the Conference of the Labor Party
of Great Britain the question of joining the Third International was

5

    

  

raised, and referred to the local organizations of the Labor Party for
discussion.

At the Second Congress, in addition to Communist Parties which
had decisive voting rights, there were syndicalist and revolutionary or-
ganizations, I.W.W. organizations from various countries, the Spanish
National Federation of Labor, the British Shop Stewards who had not
previously belonged to any political party, the Communist oppositions
in the Social-Democratic Parties and Socialist Parties, which joined the
Third International before the Second Congress.

At the Second Congress, the representatives of the Independent So-
cial-Democratic Party of Germany and the Socialist Party of France
were admitted with a consultative voice, in view of the fact that both
parties had decided to negotiate with the Third International, with a
view to joining it.

Statements of the wish to join the Communist International not only
came from revolutionary organizations, but from parties which remained
under the leadership of reformists and centrists, who were prepared to
"turn their coat” under the pressure of the masses with the object of
deceiving them. In the resolution on the fundamental tasks of the
Communist Parties, adopted at the Second Congress, we read:

“One mistake, very serious and presenting great direct danger for
the success of the cause of the liberation of the proletariat, consists
in the fact that part of the old leaders and old parties of the Second
International, partly unconsciously yielding to the wishes and pres-
sure of the masses, partly consciously deceiving them in order to
preserve their former role of agents and supporters of the bour-
geoisie inside the labor movement, are declaring their conditional or
unconditional aﬂiliation to the Third International, while remaining
in reality in the whole practice of their party and political work on
the level of the Second International. Such a state of things is ab-
solutely inadmissible, because it demoralizes the masses, hinders the
development of a strong Communist Party, and lowers their respect
for the Third International by threatening repetition of such betray-
als as that of the Hungarian Social-Democrats who had rapidly
assumed the disguise of Communists” (Par 1, II Section).

This is why the Second Congress paid such great attention to the
question of the acceptance of new parties into the Communist Inter-
national.

As mentioned above, the Independent Social-Democratic Party of
Germany and the French Socialist Party were present at the Second
Congress with a consultative voice. The debates on the conditions of

admission into the Communist International turned chieﬂy around the
question_ of accepting these two parties, though later it turned out that
the conditions which the Comintern presented to parties wishing to
join it were not acceptable to the .leaders of parties which had joined
the Communist International even before the Second Congress: to the
Socialist Party of Italy, the Labor Party of Norway, etc.

The Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany from No-
vember 19th, 1918, participated in the government, together with the
right social-democrats Ebert, Scheidemanni and Lansberg. Together
with the latter the independents refused the cargoes of grain which

the workers of the Soviet Union were sending to support the German '

revolution. Together with the right social-democrats, they took the
line of conciliation to the Entente and America (calculating on Wil-
son), did not restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and
conﬁrmed the expulsion of the Soviet ambassador who had been com-
pelled to leave Germany under the regime of Wilhelm. Together with
the right socialists, and with the aim of beheading and betraying the
revolution, Ehey delfided todcallda Corgﬁituen-t l;s‘Sl:eI'Iill)lE, simiﬁltineously
nullif in t e wor ers’ an so iers’ viets. e ea ers o t e in e-
pendelntsgwere for collaboration with the bourgeoisie, against the dicta-
torship of the proletariat, against the Soviet system, for the bourgeois
republic. But the Independent Social-Democratic Party was a mass
party. Under the pressure of its members and local organizations,
which, together with the Communists, had taken part in the revolu-
tionary struggle for Soviet Germany and in practice had demonstrated
their readiness to make sacriﬁces in this struggle, the right leaders of
the independents (Crispien, Dittman, Hilferding, Kautsky, Breitscheid)
were compelled to enter into negotiations with the Communist Inter-

ional.
na'tThe same may be said of the leaders of the Socialist Party of
France. The majority of the leaders occupied their old ‘position ‘of
collaboration with the bourgeoisie, and only opened negotiations with
the Third International under the pressure of the masses of members.

Frossard was present at the Second Congress, and voted after the
Second Congress for the conditions of acceptance formulated by it.
Not long before the Congress he wrote in a leading article in H umcmzte

on February 13th, 1920:

"As for the policy of our Party, it is obvious that it remains the
same as before . . . Elections take’ place. If circumstances arise,
the Third International does not in any way hinder the "formation of
en bloc, sometimes even during the first round of the elections.”

This proves that they either did not understand, or did not want to
understand, that membership of the Communist International made it
compulsory for them to change their previous reformist policy and
tactics in reality. 1 -

For this very reason, not only in the twenty-one conditions, but in the
resolution on the basic tasks of the Comintern, the Second Congress
clearly and sharply exposed the treacherous’maneuvers of those parties
which only adopted the basic principles -of the Comintern in words.

“The ‘whole activity of these parties,” says the resolution (refer-
ring to the French Socialist Party, the Independent Social-Democratic
Party and the Swiss Socialist Party), “proves——and any given period-
ical paper of these parties conﬁrms it——that they are not Communists
as yet and frequently even are in direct opposition to the funda-
mental principles of the Third ‘International, namely, the recognition
of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Soviet power instead
of bourgeois democracy. ‘Therefore the Second Congress of the Com-
munist International should announce that it does not consider it.
possible to receive these parties immediately, that it conﬁrms the
answer of the Executive Committee of the Third International to the
German ‘Independents’; that it conﬁrms its readiness to carry on
negotiations with any party leaving the Second International and
desiring to join the Third; that it reserves the right of a consultative
voice to the delegate of such parties at all its congresses and confer-
ences; and that it proposes the following conditions for the complete
union of these and similar parties with the Communist International:
(1) the publication of all the resolutions passed by all congresses
of the Communist International and by the Executive Committee in
all the periodical publications of the Party; (2) their discussion at
the special meetings of all sections and local organizations of the
Party; (3) the convocation after such discussion of a special congress
of the Party for the weeding out of all elements which continue to
act in the spirit of the Second International. Such a congress to be
called together as soon as possible within a period of four months
at most following the Second Congress; (4) expulsion from the Party
of all members who persist in their adherence to the Second Inter-
national; (5) the transfer of all periodical papers of the Party into
the hands of exclusively Communist editors; (6) the parties wishing
to join the Third International but which have not yet radically
changed their old tactics must, above all, take care that two-thirds
of their central committee and the chief central institutions consist
of such comrades who have declared their adherence to a‘party of

8

 

 

the Third International even before the Second Congress.” (Resolu-
tion on the basic tasks of the Communist International, Section 3,
par. 13.)

These conditions, which were put forward by the Second Congress
in addition to the twenty-one conditions of acceptance into the Com-
munist International, at once showed which of the leaders of the Second
International who had joined, or wished to join, the Third Interna-
tional had really abandoned the program and tactics of the Second
International. The fact that such a- sharp formulation of the ques-

tion was really necessary with the aim of discovering hidden reformists ‘

and centrists, is shown by the conduct of the leaders of the Swiss
Social-Democratic Party. After the First Congress of the Comintern,
the Congress of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party (August, 1919)
decided, by an overwhelming majority, to join the Third International,
but the leaders "organized” a referendum among the members in such
a way that there were -15,000 votes against joining the Third Interna-
tional and only 8,000 votes for, although in all the Social-Democratic
Parties, the mass of members was more revolutionary than the dele-
gates elected to the Congress, and consequently a correctly conducted
referendum should have shown a higher percentage of votes for joining
the Third International than -even the Congress voting. This indicates
the swindling the leaders of the Social-Democratic Party sank to, to
hinder the efforts of the rank and file members to join the Third
International.

There is no need to speak of the importance of the periodic press
passing into the hands of Communists, as mentioned in point 5. Take,
for example, Humcmite, the central organ of the French Socialist Party
at that time. At the head of the party were supporters of the "center”
(Comrade Cachin and Frossard). At the head of the left wing of
the party was Loriot, at the head of the Rights, Renaudel. The leading
articles for Humanite were distributed among these three trends as
follows: Center 8, Lefts 4, and Rights 3 articles per week. Thus,
every week the readers received a proportional number of articles of
the three tendencies, which contradicted and frequently opposed each
other, inamanner far from open discussion, and as the result there was
much confusion.
