WHEN six men on the U.S. Supreme Court voted to uphold the
Smith Act on June 4, they threw a big road—block in the path of

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

American labor.

For the Smith Act is more like a man—trap than an act of Con-
gress. In fact, there hasn’t been a law like it on the statute books

since the Alien and Sedition Laws way back in 1798.

For the first time since those days, the Smith Act makes it

a crime to teach and advocate ideas.

Under this act, you can now be hauled into court and
charged with “conspiracy to teach and advocate force
and violence” if you speak at a union meeting in
favor of a wage-increase or a strike

for a union contract.

(Hard to believe? Sure —

but read on.)

Eleven men — Communists —

have already been found guilty
under the Smith Act and
sentenced to jail for five-

year terms.

In the words of Su-
preme Court Justice Black, who called their conviction a violation of the First Amendment to the

Constitution :

“These petitioners were not charged with an attempt to overthrow the Government. . . .
They were not even charged with saying anything or writing anything designed to over-
throw the Government. The charge was that they agreed to assemble and to talk and

publish certain ideas. . . .”

In other words, these men were convicted for their ideas — even though the Bill of Rights

says Congress can make no law abridging the freedom of speech.

Maybe you feel: “Well, it’s just the Communists thegfre after. The rest of us don’t have to worry.”

If you feel that wa y, then read this T

 

 

NE of the II Communists sentenced under the Smith Act is Irving Potash, vice-president of the

International Fur and Leather Workers Union. He is now in jail on a ﬁve-year term.

A few weeks after he was imprisoned, the FBI began picking up men and women, Negro and

white, from coast to coast, and throwing them into jail for “violation of the Smith Act.”

Included in these new roundups were two men -— Al Lannon, a founder of the National Mari-
time Union, CIO, and Louis Weinstock, for 9 years secretary-treasurer of

the New York District Council No. 9 of the Painters Union, AFL.

These union leaders, and many others, now face $10,000 ﬁnes and

ﬁve years in jail because of their ideas — and nothing more!

 

And that’s not all.

In August, at the very moment he was engaged in negotiations for wage increases for 25,000 Ha-
waiian workers, ]ack Hall, International Longshore VVorl<ers Union vice-president, who had signed
a Taft-Hartley oath swearing he was not a Communist, was arrested and indicted under the Smith Act

)9

charged with “conspiracy to teach and advocate. . . .

Then on September 4, reporters for the New York Daily Mirror wrote that the ‘government is ex-

pected to charge the leaders of 13 big international unions with violation of both the Smith and Taft-
Hartley Acts. '

And this is only the beginning. Last year the Department of justice admitted
that if the Supreme Court upheld the Smith Act it is prepared to proceed
with charges against at least 12,000 Americans!

(Remember Germany? Remember the pattern there? First the Communists,
then the trade-unions, then the rights of all people. . . 
What does it all add up to? ]ust this:

 

Under a big whooptydo about “stopping Communism,” certain big corporations
and their friends in the Justice Department and the Courts are using the Smith Act
to chop away at any union or union leader who doesn’t agree with their policy of

a freeze on wages and sky’s-the-limit for proﬁts.

The Smith Act is supposed to ﬁnish the job of sending us back to the days of com-
pany-unionism and belly-robbing wages that the Taft-Hartley Act began.

What the monopolies and big anti—union employers could never accomplish through

company-police, scabs, labor-spies and Taft-Hartley Act injunctions, they’re now trying to put
across with the Smith Act.

This Is Tlreir New A tomic Weapon Against labor.’

 

   

labor Figlrts Back!

But American labor isn’t taking this new below-the-belt attack lying down.

Read for yourself what a few unions and public ﬁgures——most of them anti-Communist-
have to say about the Smith Act:

_ HUGO ERNST “If Communism is right, we cannot stamp it out by jailing its representatives.
President, AFL International If it is wrong, on the other hand, it cannot survive the struggle of ideas. . . . Our
Hotel and Restaurant Waakeas fear of losing democracy is likely to drive us into enacting laws which by their
nature will defeat the ends of democracy.”

FRANK .ROSENBLUM “A wave of legislation, beginning with the Taft-Hartley Act and the Smith
Vz'ce-Pre5-jdgnt, National C10; Act, and embracing the McCarran Act and similar measures, has created in
Secretary-Trea3a¢a,-2 Amalgamated effect, a parallel legal‘ system superseding the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and
Clothing Workers of Ame,-iaa our traditional body of law. . . . This is a dangerous movement toward fascism,
representing a real threat to labor and liberal elements in this country.”

WILLIAM R, HOOD “As one who feels strongly about the way Negroes are treated in this ‘Ameri-
Rooordmg 5oo,.oto,.o, can way of life,’ I am calling upon my people everywhere, no matter what their

pom Loool 600, political beliefs or ideology, to join in the struggle now for the defense of these

United Automobile Workers victims of fascism, for this is our ﬁrst line of defense against this new attack.

I call upon organized labor to join in the defense of these victims because your
time is closer than you think.”

And they’re not the only ones.

Other unions that have blasted the Smith Act invasion of labor’s rights include the CIO Packinghouse Workers;
“Textile Lab01‘»” Organ of the G10 Textile Workers Union; the Executive Board of the International Mine, Mill &
Smelter Workers; the oﬂicial organ of the O-il Workers International, CIO; the International Longshore
and Warehouse Workers Executive; and many others.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said of the Smith Act convictions: “Never before has such a restriction been
placed on the right: to hold opinions and to express them in the United States of America.”

 

The magazines,’ Nation and New Republic condemned the Act. The New York Times editorially suggested
the Supreme Court reconsider its decision. Educators, church leaders, and prominent public ﬁgures—of all religions,
colors and creeds—are speaking up, together with millions of Americans, saying:

"The Smith Act Must Go!"

 

E, who issue this folder, are representatives of various sections of American labor. We have
our own political views and differences. Many of us are what is called “right-wingers.

We say it’s time to bring out the old labor slogan: “An injury to one is an injury to all.”

We need just three things to stop the Smith Act conspiracy against us — plenty of
understa.nding, plenty of unity, and plenty of ﬁght.

No American worker asked for this fight. All of us have enough to do to get along 9 what
with high taxes and higher prices and the war-drums beating in our ears.

But the people who hate labor have brought the ﬁght to us. And if we don’t light back
and win, then taxes will go higher, prices will rise like balloons, and you’ll either have to
take it and shut up or go on trial for “conspiracy” if you so much as open your mouth.

There’s danger ahead, all right. But it can be stopped.

HERE'S IIOW. . .
