Author of RUSSIA'S FIGHTINII FIJRUES

 

Many of the facts are not known yet. Many ﬁgures are
incomplete at this time. But out of the great adding machine
of the Second World War enough ﬁgures have emerged to
see what's what. , ‘

I will try to present here the basic facts and ﬁgures per-
taining to the effort of the Soviet Union in this war. For

the sake of simplicity and to aid the memory of the reader,“
‘ most data will be given in round ﬁgures. Let‘ us add that this

pamphlet is not an effort to show that the Soviet Union won
the war alone. Most Soviet war leaders ‘headed by Generalis-
simo Stalin have said that victory is a result of a common

effort. In this effort the leading United Nations chipped in »

with their best. What I hope to demonstrate conclusively is
that the Soviet eﬁort was decisive and that Soviet power, in
alglits manifestations, played a decisive role in. that eﬁort.

World War I and World War II

Russia entered the First World War as a full-ﬂedged mili4
tary partner of France and England. In spite of certain dif-
ferences between the social-political internal set-ups of Eng-
land and France on one hand, and Tsarist Russia on the
other, they were bound together by common imperialistic
interests, interests which were being threatened by German
imperialism. The latter, having embarked on an aggressive

international policy at the end of the nineteenth century,

intended to crush England and France and at least greatly

weaken Russia by strip-ping her of the Ukraine, Poland, the

Baltic countries and Finland. ’ _
Community of interests brought about the formation of the

I Entente. The latter was formed in stages: the Franco-Russian

alliance dated from 1891, the Franco-British alliance from
1904, and the Russo-British understanding from 1907. Thus,
when the war broke out in 1914, Russia had been in the
so-called “western family” for seven years. Russia was not in
the least isolated, either politically or psychologically.
The international position of the Soviet Union on the eve

of World War II was diametrically opposite. The “latent wari’ ,

1 of European reaction against the U.S.S.R. had ﬂared and

smouldered intermittently between 1917 and 1941. In 1938
the Munich Pact, so often conveniently forgotten, had in fact
cementeda pan’-European coalition against the Soviet Union,
including even the latter’s ex-ally of 1935—France.'1 The Soviet

Union was literally alone. She did not even have her pro- ._

verbial “only friend”—Montenegro——on her side. The imperial
interests of the Anglo-French bloc and of the German bloc
united them in their hatred of the socialist state.

The First World War hadsmouldered for years. The sides

, were lined up. There was no strategic surprise. There was

no tactical surprise, because the assassination of Archduke
Franz-Ferdinand had given all concerned more than a month's
warning. On the other hand, Hitler’s9 attack. on the Soviet
Union, coming as it did in violation of a pact of non-aggres-

ision, without the slightest warning, achieved the initial tacti-

cal surprise so essential to the success of a lightning war.

Imperial Russia met Germany in 1914 on a frontier which
had existed for generations, with a borderland fully fortiﬁed.
The Soviet border of 1941 was of recent formation and had
not been fully prepared for defense yet (although the extra
strip of iﬁghting sp-ace, some 175 miles wide, in Western
Belorussia, the Western Ukraine, in the Baltic and in Bessa-
rabia did play the salutary role of buffer. Even so, however, in
1914 the distance between the German border and Moscow,
along the central Berlin-Moscow direction, was some 900 miles,
while ‘in 1941 it was only 650 miles.

On the ﬂanks of the huge front, Russia’s position. in 1914
was incomparably more secure. In 1914, the nearest enemy
to St. Petersburg was in East Prussia, 500 miles away. In 1941
the enemy was in Finland, only 100 miles away and would
have been only 18 miles away had it not been for the pre-
ventive war against Finland, in 1939-1940.

In 1914 the nearest enemy was 250 miles from Odessa (in '

Hungary). In 1941 the enemy was only 120 miles away (in
Rumania). .

In 1914 Murmansk -was absolutely safe (except for enemy
submarines). In 1914, thanks to “dear little” Finland and the

9

occupation of Norway by the enemy, this only Soviet‘ outlet
to the West was under direct and severe attack.

In 1914 Japan was an ally of the Entente and Russia was
able to move practically all her troops from the Far East to
ﬁght the Germans. This writer remembers witnessing the
arrival of Far Eastern divisions in Poland after a train trip of
ten weeks (in October, 1914). Japan supplied weapons and

munitions to Russia. In 1941 the Soviet Union was compelled _ I
to keep a great army in the Far East because half of the ]apa- ‘

nese army remained concentrated on the horseshoe border

of Manchuria and Outer Mongolia. Of course, this time Japan

did not give the Soviet Union as much as a riﬂe cartridge.
While during World War I Turkey was ﬁghting Russia,

and while it remained outwardly neutral during World War 4

II, the U.S.S.R. still had to keep troops on the Turkish border
in 1941-45 because of the suspicious character of that neu-
trality. ‘

The Central Powers in 1914 were considerably, less strong
than Hitler's Germany was in 1941, with almost all of Europe

at her beck and call. All you have to do is compare the Ger-

many-Austria—Hungary-Bulgaria—Turkey bloc with the Ger-
many-Italy, Austria-Hungary-Rumania-Finland-Bulgaria-Slo-
vakia-Croatia bloc, de facto allied with Spain, and controlling
all the rest of continental Europe with its resources, produc-
tive capacity and millions of slave labor. Furthermore, in 1914

Germany was squeezed between two fronts right from the-

start, while up to June, 1944, Germany’s control reached

to the Atlantic Ocean with all that implies strategically.

And this brings us to the most important difference between
Russia's strategic position in World War I and World War II.

The difference can be told in a very few words and with a
handful of ﬁgures.

During the entire World War I a Western Front existed, A

and it was a “ﬁrst front,” not a “second front” in importance.
But during three of the four years of World War II the Soviet
Union fought Germany and German-controlled Europe alone.

Let us look at the deployment of forces on both fronts in

1914. This initial deployment gives a measures of the situation’ -

1 O "

/

R which obtained throughout the whole course of that war A

(with only temporary changes). . 9 .
The forces deployed in the initial stage of the war were as
follows:

, Allies N Central Powers
Western Front 85 Inf. Div. (Fr.8cBr.) 86 Inf. Div. (German)
’ 12 Cav. Div. (Fr. 8: Br.) 10 Cav. Div. (German)
’ Eastern Front 521/2 Inf. Div. (Russian) 17 Inf. Div. (German)
21 Cav. Div. (Russian) 1 Cav. Div. (German)

35 Inf. Div. (Austro.—H.)
11 Cav. Div. (Austr.-H.)

It must be noted that the ﬁre power of an Austro-I-Iungarian
division was rated at about half of the power of a German
division. Thus at the outset the Russian Army faced about the
equivalent of 35 German Infantry and 12 Cavalry divisions

‘while the French; Belgian and British faced 86 German In-

fantry and 10 Cavalry divisions. This, of course, was’ due to
the so-called Schlieffen Plan according to which the Germans
intended to crush France ﬁrst and then turn on Russia.

The greatest German concentration in the East was effected
in the campaign of 1915, but even then the Russian Army
never faced more than half of the Central Powers’. effectives.

At the end of thewar when Russia was practically out, the
Germans kept 20 per cent of their divisions in the East and
80 per cent in the West.

Thus, barring the time when Russia was temporarily
eclipsed as a military power, the Russian Imperial Army had
to face between 30 and 50 per cent of the enemy divisions.

‘The Eastern Front, barring its meanderings, was roughly
1,000 miles long from the Baltic to the Black Sea. The deepest
enemy penetration (before 1918 when the Germans occupied
the Ukraine and reached Rostov) was about 300 miles in the
center. —

The Russian Imperial Army won only one campaign. That
was the,Brussilov offensive in the summer of 1916. Even then,
the operation, brilliantly ‘successful, was robbed of real
strategic results by the inept leadership of the Russian Su-

11

preme Command (nominally under the Tsar) which, did not
support General Brussilov’s effort- The Russian Army won
a number of tactical successes, some of them of great scope

(such as the early Galician operation), but the war as a whole_

can be called a series of failures, some of them pre-eminently
heroic (such as the invasion of East Prussia to save the Allies
at the Marne). The result leaves no doubt: Russia was de-
feated and knocked out of the war. It must be added here
that, contrary to popular opinion, the Russia revolution was
hastened by military defeat, and not military defeat caused
by the revolution.

The Allies lost 9,300,000 killed, missing and prisoners dur-
ing World War I; of these Russia lost 4,200,000 (we do not
count the wounded which were 12,800,000 and 5,000,000 re-
spectively). Thus Russia lost less than half of what the other
Allies did. This happened because the Russian Army through-
out the war faced less enemies than her Allies did.

Let us add to this that Space, Mud and Traditional Russian ’

Heroism were as much on the side of Russia in 1914-18 as they

’ were in 1941-45, with all other strategic and political factors

in her favor as compared to the U.S.S.R. And still Russia lost
World War I and the U.S.S.R. won. World War II. .

We have compared in this chapter the initial political and
strategic factors which shaped the course of World War I as
far as Russia was concerned. We also. mentioned the basic

military facts and ﬁgures pertaining to Russia in World War I. 0

The basic military facts concerning the U.S.S.R. in World
War II will be the theme of the next chapter because they
are too tremendous in scope to ﬁt into a point-by-point com-
parison with the facts of World War 1.

Highlights of the Soviet-German War

The Soviet-German War lasted 1,416 days and raged over
a theater of approximately 1,250,000 square miles. _
The German-Soviet front was nevershorter than the dis-

tance between the shores of the Barents Sea and the Black

Sea (except in the ﬁnal stage when Finland was knocked out

12

 

and the front stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea) . This
distance, as the crow ﬂies is 1,700 miles. It was. the distance
between the Soviet right-flank sentry on Cape Rybachi near
Murmansk, and the left-ﬂank sentry on Cape Khersonese,
near Sevastopoli '

In the late summer of 1942, when the front bulged eastward
to touch Stalingrad and Grozny and the Soviet ﬂank sentries
stood on Cape Rybachi and on the ruins of the cement factory
at Novorossisk, the front was roughly 2,700 miles long.

The line of the front did not budge in the extreme north;
it swung 650 miles in the center, from Brest-Litovsk to V0-
ronezh; it swung 1,000 miles in the south, from Przemysl in
Galicia to Stalingrad on the Volga.

In this tremendous ﬁghting space the Germans kept an
average of 240 divisions ﬁghting.

A rough comparison of the “volume of ﬁghting” in the
East and in the" West would run something like this:

_ East—24o enemy divisions engaged during 47 months-
1 1,280 mos /div."‘ .

West—7o enemy divisions engaged (France, Germany) dur-
ing 11 months, plus 20 divisions (Africa, Italy) engaged
during 36 months, plus 110 enemy divisions (Low Countries,
France, 1940) engaged during 11/2 months—-1,655 mos/div.

Allowing for small or short-lived action like the “sitzkrieg”
in 1939~4o, Poland, Norway, Greece, East Africa, etc., it can
be said that the rough ratio between the “volume of ﬁghting”

(expressed in “division-per-month” units) done by the‘ West- ‘H

ern Allies and by the Soviet Union is 7:45, or about 1:6%).

This ratio is also borne out by the respective Allied casual-
ties in the war against Germany. They run like this:

British Empire and U. S. killed, missing and prisoners:
7 1,100,000
Soviet Union, killed, missing and prisoners:
6,500,000
(estimated, see "chapter on COST, p. 31)

* Mos/div. equals one division ﬁghting one month.

is

 

Finally, if we compare the areas over which active land
operations were conducted, we see roughly the following:

The Red Army fought over 750,000 square miles_ of territory
when retreating eastward and over the same 750,000 square
miles when advancing westward. In addition it fought over
roughly 500,000 square miles of foreign lands (between April,
1944, and May, 1945). This is a total of about 2,000,000 square
miles of ﬁghting space. i ,

The Anglo--American (and smaller Allied) armies in Eu-
rope and North Africa fought over an area of about 350,000
square’ miles (not counting the ﬁghting of Polish troops in
1939 and the ﬁghting of the French Army in 1940, but count-
ing the marching and counter-marching of the British in the
Libyan coastwise corridor).

All these calculations may seem to some rather, mechanical.
However, the fact that the three basic rati0s—of volume of

ﬁghting expressed in duration of ﬁghting and‘ the number of ~

enemy troops engaged, of area of ﬁghting, and of losses in-
curred—all point to an over-all ratio of effort expressed in the
symbol 1:6—shows that this ratio does express the true pic-
ture. The Soviet Union did roughly eighty-ﬁve per cent of
theﬁghting against Germany and her satellites.

Having established the approximate ﬁgures pertaining to
the width and length of the space within which so many Red
Army men fought and gave their lives, let us examine the
course of the war.

This course from the viewpoint of higher strategy can be
divided into four periods; the ﬁrst period lasted seven months,
between the initial German attack and the end of the Battle
of Moscow; the second lasted a year between the Battle of
Moscow and the end of the Battle of Stalingrad; the third
lasted six months between the Battle of Stalingrad ‘and the
end of the Battle of Kursk (the so-called Kursk Arc); the
fourth lasted 21 months between the Battle of Kursk and
the end of the ﬁnal Battle of Berlin. '

Moscow, Stalingrad and Kursk are three strategic turning
points of the war. Berlin is the pay-off. ’

THE FIRST PERIOD

Germany attacked the Soviet Union with close to 200 divi-
sions, of which 175 were “pure German.” No other Ger-
man troops were engaged anywhere except for the skirmishing
in Libya by the British against three German divisions and
a depleted Italian expeditionary force. British troops had
pulled out of Greece in May. America was still virtually un-
armed. Britain was slowly recovering from the so-called
Battle of Britain. All Europe, with its 32o,ooo,ooo people
and a yearly production of 50,000,000 tons of steel, was Hit-
ler’s. The German Army could face eastward without hav-
ing to look over its shoulder. World public opinion on June
21, 1941, was still babbling about “Communazism”; the So-
viet Union was politically and militarily isolated.

The German High Command set itself the following strate-

gic goal* (or objective): to destroy the Red Army within»

three months and to force the U.S.S.R. to capitulate before
winter, 1941. -

Territorially, the objective was: the capture of the Lenin-
grad-Moscow-Kharkov-Rostov line, thus bringing about the
utter paraylsis of the Soviet transportation system. _

The Red Army was to be destroyed west of that line, thus
making it unnecessary for the German Army to extend its
communications beyond the 6oo-mile mark (Brest-Litovsk—
Moscow). -

The attainment of that goal would have also cut the Mur-
mansk route, made the Iranian route virtually impracticable,

-destroyed the Soviet Baltic Fleet, bottled up the Northern

Fleet and made the Black Sea Fleet almost useless by depriving

it of its main bases (at least, so the Germans thought).
Furthermore, the Soviet Union, deprived of 30 per cent

of her population, of half of her food producing area, 40

"‘ The term “strategic goal,” which will recur frequently in the forth-
coming exposition, can be deﬁned thus: the objective of a war, or military

campaign, set by the High Command, the attainment of which must bring «

decisive results.

per cent of her coal, half of her steel and iron, was not ex-
pected by the Germans to be able to continue its resistance.

The 2oo—odd German divisions plunged forward in one

strategic echelon, blitz-fashion.

They beleaguered Leningrad, they took Kharkov, they cap-
tured Rostov (holding it for only a few days before being
ejected), they reached the outskirts of Moscow.

Vast as the enemy armies attacking Leningrad, Kharkov
and Rostov were, the direction of the main blow lay on the
Brest-Litovsk-Moscow line. Here the blitz was stopped for the
ﬁrst time in September, east of Smolensk and two-thirds of
the way to the main goal (i.e., Moscow). After that it never
blitzed again. It was a decisive delay which threw the Ger-
mans two months off schedule. Instead of opening the Battle
of Moscow in August the Germans were forced to start it in
the beginning of October.

They concentrated ﬁfty-one divisions, of which 13 were
armored, for the attack on Moscow. Three quarters of a mil-
lion men, 1,500 tanks, 3,000 guns and 700 planes attacked a
perimeter of 300 miles, forging a pair of pincers aimed at the
capital. In that battle the Germans had a numerical superior-
ity of 3:1 in tanks, 2:1 in planes, better than 2:1 in guns and
11/211 in mortars.

At the eleventh hour the Soviet High Command, under S

Marshal Stalin, delivered a blow in the north which frustrated
the German maneuver to cut the Murmansk railroad and be-
siege Leningrad instead of blockading it (which is more than
a ﬁne point), struck a blow in the south which recaptured
Rostov and, ﬁnally, struck the big blow at the central group-
ing of the German 51 divisions, completely routing them and
throwing them back as much as 250 miles in some sectors of
the Moscow front. ‘

Moscow, Leningrad and Rostov remained in Soviet hands,
the Red Army was not only not destroyed, but on the offen-
sive, Soviet industry by a “miracle” of organization had been
largely moved from the war theatre hundreds (and more)
miles to the east. Part of the population of the occupied ter-
ritory became partisans, another part was evacuated.

16

 

 

The German Army had failed in the attainment of its
strategic goal.
November 16 and January 1, 1942, i.e., during the Battle of
Moscow, the Germans had lost 2,200 tanks, 14,000 motor
vehicles, 2,000 guns and 140,000 killed (which means certainly
another 400,000 wounded). Fifty of their best divisions were
shattered to the tune of 50 per cent losses.

Here are the results of the Battle of Moscow: it made the
Germans fail of the strategic goal of their decisive campaign;

it destroyed the legend of German invincibility; it inflicted
terrible human and material losses on them; it actually killed

the blitz; it saved the Soviet Union and thus the United Na-
tions. After the Battle of Moscow, the Germans dared no
longer thrust directly at the Soviet capital, but advanced in a
roundabout maneuver, a maneuver which, by the summer of
1942, brought them to Stalingrad.

At the time of the Battle of Moscow the U.S.A.A.F. was not
inaction and the bombing of Europe by the R.A.F. was in
its infancy. One hundred and fifty ton raids on Hamburg
were still making headlines. The inﬂuence of such bombing
on the campaign on the Soviet Front was practically nil. As
to lend-lease, it was nothing more than a signed protocol, and
a small one at that (one billion dol1ars—promised, but still

— undelivered) .

Russian Winter helped because the Red Army was pre-
pared for it (through training, clothing, special oils for mo-
tors, special weapons, special methods of transport) and the
Germans were not.

Russian Space helped because it was well defended. Un-
defended space, ‘passivespace, does not help.

What’ decided the campaign was Soviet organization and
discipline, military skill, superior military direction and “tra-
ditional" Russian courage with which the people had become
imbued through education and their own experience and

‘ outlook.

As far as Germany, backed by all Europe, and the Soviet
Union are concerned, the Battle of Moscow was purely a
”man-to-man" affair; with the rest of the Allied world unable

It had failed with its‘ blitz-method. Between_

  

to do much more than cheer. However, out of those cheers
grew the great war-and-peace alliance of the Big Three. Thus,
the Battle of Moscow actually won the war and saved hu-
manity.

THE SECOND PERIOD

As has been shown above, the ﬁrst period of the Soviet—Ger-
man war, culminating in the gigantic Battle of Moscow, proved
to be a German strategic, operational and tactical failure.

In view of the obvious potential superiority of the anti-Hit-
ler coalition over Germany and her satellites, the Hitler bloc
stood before ominous perspectives. A ring of land fronts,
surrounding Germany, was the nightmare of the German High
Command, which simply had to do something and use to the
best advantage the time which was being afforded it by the
unpreparedness of the Western Allies and the lack of strate-
gic coordination between West and East. In the spring of
1942 nothing outside the Soviet front threatened the Wehr-
macht, because the front in North Africa absorbed only be-
tween 3 and 6 German divisions and half a score Italian
divisions of doubtful quality.

« The Germans mustered an overwhelming majority of their
forces and again struck at the Red Army in a desperate new
attempt to crush the Red Army. The offensive, however, in-
stead of developing between the Baltic and Black,‘Seas as in
1941, was limited to the southern wing (roughly between Orel
and the Black Sea). Of the available 256 German divisions
the German High Command mustered 179 in the East plus

.61 satellite divisions, or 240 in all. A front of 375 miles ﬂared

up in June, 1942, but only after the Germans had been de-
layed about two months by the epic defense of Sevastopol and
by Marshal Timoshenko’s counterblow in the Izyum-Berven-
kovo sector. ‘ ‘

Again, as in 1941, the Germans planned to advance in blitz-

. tempo: July 2l5—Stalingrad; August 15—Kuybyshev; September

1o—Arzamas; October-November—the attack on Moscow from
the east. Note that this time the Germans had to limit their
18

offensive to the southern one-third of the front, that they did

A not dare attack Moscow head—on, but had to pursue a round—

about course and, ﬁnally, that their blitz remained on paper.
They were late at Stalingrad and never reached any of their
other objectives. A

A Aside from the maximum objective (capture of Moscow
from the rear), the Germans had immediate goals of limited

strategic importance: they intended to capture the entire’

Donetz industrial region, the wheat of the Don and Kuban,
the oil of Maikop, Grozny and Baku. They were trying to

V cut the artery of the Volga‘ and thus deprive the U.S.S.R. of

Caucasian oil and of American materials being shipped via
Iran up the Caspian and the Volga.

Stalingrad became the strategic center of gravity of the
whole campaign, THE objective. , It was also destined to be-
come the “zenith" of the war. A

The Germans threw a total of about 60 divisions into the
Don--Volga Battle. It began in the end of August and lasted

, until the beginning of February.

It is not our intention to give even the most general de-
scription of this colossal battle about which volumes will be
written. Suﬂice it to say that the Germans pushed a great
spearhead to the Volga. This spearhead consisted of 22 of the
best divisions Hitler had, a total of 330,000 men. When the
Soviet double concentric pincers closed on November 24, 1942
(after ﬁve days of ‘offensive operations), one—third of a million
enemy troops were in the bag of a “super-Cannae” from
which practically none escaped. (“Cannae” is a battle which
Hannibal won over the Romans in 216 B. C. It is consid-
ered a classic of encirclement and annihilation.) The victory
of Stalingrad was the signal for a series of Soviet olfensive op-
erations ranging from Leningrad (where the blockade was
lifted) to the Sea of Azov.

Between November, 19, 1942,tand March 31, 1943, the Red
Army liberated 185,000 square miles, retook a dozen of the
most important German-held key strongholds, as well as thou-
sands of towns and villages, and piled up the following tro-
phies:

19

 

 

1 , Destroyed . v Captured

Tanks . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,520 — 4,670
Guns . . . . . . .  . . . . 4,600 ' 15,860
Trucks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 123,000

A total of 350,000 enemy soldiers were captured and 850,-
000 killed. Counting the inevitable amount of wounded, it
may be said in the fall, winter and early spring campaigns
of 1942-1943 the Red Army destroyed single-handedly an
enemy army equivalent to the one which invaded the Low-
lands and ‘France in the summer of 1940 and conquered
Western Europe in six weeks. 4

While the Battle of Stalingrad was raging, Allied troops
landed in North Africa in an unprecedented armada of ships.
The operation was a masterpiece of planning and execution.
Far be it from this writer to claim that they should have
landed in France instead of Africa. Military history will pass
its verdict on this question when all the data are in. Never-
theless the fact remains that’ the Allied landing did not
threaten the bulk of the German Army. It only put R0mmel’s
half dozen German divisions in a trap, forcing them to pull

 

out of El Alamein and speed-back to Tunisia where they were _

battered into defeat, although not without a great effort.

In the fall of 1942 a pair of Axis pincers threatened the
Middle East. Paulus was moving to the Volga and Rommel
was moving to the Nile. However, it must be borne in mind

that the arms of the pincers were very uneven: Paulus and the‘

second strategic echelon backing him up between the Don and
the Volgaphad 61 divisions, while Rommel had six German
divisions and a handful of Italian divisions. ’

The Allied campaign in North Africa netted about 150,000
Axis troops (including probably most of the wounded who
were captured in the Cap Bon trap). Concurrently, the cam-
paign on the Soviet front netted 1,200,000 killed and captured
alone.

The Germans did not achieve any of their strategic obje_c—

tives and met with an unprecedented military disaster. After 4

20

 

Stalingrad the German Army never isuceessfully ‘went on the
oﬂensive on a strategic scale.

A As an offensive machine the Wehrmacht was through for
good. Thus, we see that Stalingrad and not El Alemain was
the crucial battle of the war. In order to understand this just

imagine Paulus victorious at Stalingrad with Rommel beaten

at El Alemain. The U.S.S.R. (taking the extreme view) goes
under and the Wehrmacht turns west in the Spring. What
value would have attached to the Tunisian victory if Allied
troops in Africa who had had a difficult time beating six Ger-
man divisions and ten Italian divisions, suddenly had had to

A face in May, 1943, 250 German divisions along the Atlantic

and Mediterranean “walls”?

Now imagine the opposite contingency and you will see
that even a victorious Rommel could not have done anything
decisive in Egypt with his handful of men if the Germans still
had been thrown back from the Volga to the Donetz.

Stalingrad without the slightest doubt must be considered
the hub of the war. '

Let us turn to another aspect of the Stalingrad victory.
Against the ﬁgures we quoted on German materiel captured
by the Red Army, let us see how much lend-lease materiel
had been delivered to the U.S.S.R. at the time of Stalingrad.

By December 31, 1942,. the United States had sent to. the
U.S.S.R.: 2,600 planes; 3,200 tanks; 81,ooo trucks (and other
materials). Britain sent 2,600 tanks and 2,000 planes. It is

known that the deliveries in November, 1942, were 13 times

greater than those in January, 1942, On the other hand
no material received after August could have possibly been
used by the Russians at Stalingrad. Thus during the crucial
batle doubtless much less stuff than the above totals was avail-
able to the Red Army. , s

, As -a matter of fact, Leland Stowe’s testimony in his recent
book They Shall Not Sleep is revealing. Mr. Stowe says that
after early June no more convoys arrived in Murmansk until
September (the ﬁrst American train arrived in Teheran from
the Gulf of Persia with war material for the Red Army only
in March, 1943). On page 227 Mr. Stowe says: ’

As a matter of fact, Allied materials could not become
3 T of some decisive quantity in the Soviet Union until the
;‘3; end of 1942~after the decision at Stalingrad had already
 if ~ been settled.” (My emphasis—S. K.) '

Writing of lend-lease help to the U.S.S.R., Prof. George ‘B.

Cressey, of the University of Syracuse, says: “It was Rus-
sian planning and Russian equipment which won the victories
of Leningrad, Moscow and Stalingrad.” (The Basis of Soviet
e Strength, page 247.)
e » ‘g T It is interesting to note in connection with the “argument” _ ,
T S about the respective importance of Stalingrad and El Alamein, .
that German tanks, painted sand-yellow for desert ﬁghting ap-
_ peared at Stalingrad, but no German tanks painted white for
 ? snow-ﬁghting were ever seen at El Alamein. , ,

As to the bombing of German-held Europe from the West
. at the time of the Battle of Stalingrad, it could not have ' - .
}  helped much. Between the beginning of the war and May 25, ~
; 1} 1 1943 (i.e., about four months after the end of the Battle of 5
1; 3  - Stalingrad), the R.A.F. Bomber Command had dropped only j
‘ if 100,000 tons on Germany. The ﬁgure for the U.S.A.A.F. was

‘ certainly less. The total was probably about one-tenth of the
total dropped on Germany from the west to the end of the
war.

 

THE THIRD PERIOD

During the Battle of Stalingrad the Germans attempted to
 S relieve their trapped Sixth Army Group with an attack by
3 ii 3 some eleven divisions from the southwest. The counter-blow
' ’ was a ghastly failure.
 1 During the third period ‘of the war, preceding the Battle of
f}; T Kursk, the Germans repeated that maneuver in February-
.i 5 J March, south of the Donetz. Here they succeeded in stopping
the Soviet olfensive which was aiming at the elbow of the
1 . Dnepr and in saving their own troops in the Donetz Basin.
This offensive between the Dnepr and Kharkov, in the early
spring of 1943, was the last successful limited offensive of the
German Army. It was successful in a strictly limited sense: it
22

saved the German troops in the Donbas from a huge trap, it
permitted the Germans to hold and exploit the mines of the
Donbas for another eight months (until September, 1943), it
checked the Soviet offensive which had rolled uninterruptedly
from Stalingrad almost to the Dnepr, a distance of roughly
400 miles in three months, it recaptured Kharkov. After that
and up to the end of 1944 the Germans staged counter—blows
on a smaller scale——at Uman, in the Ukraine; at Kiev; in
Galicia; at Warsaw; in the Baltic region; at Avaranches, in
Normandy, in the Belgian Bulge; at Budapest; but not one
of them succeeded in delaying their opponents more than for
a few weeks and most of them ended for the Germans in dis-

aster. An analysis of these multiple operations of the Wehr-

macht conclusively shows that after November 19, 1942, the
Germanyzirmy was not able successfully to take the oﬁensive
on a strategic scale. The three great German offensive blows
were delivered roughly with two-and-a-half to three score divi-
sions at a time, in 1941 (Moscow), in 1942 (Stalingrad), and
in 1943 (Kursk-Orel); of these the latter was a complete failure
as we shall see presently. The counter—blows we mentioned
before. were conducted by the Germans with an average of
between 12 and 20 divisions and, therefore, cannot be consid-
ered of strategic scope. Three big offensives and a dozen of-

fensive-defensive counter-blows—such are the highlights of the

German operations in Europe after June 22, 1941. Of these
ﬁfteen operations, thirteen (three large ones and ten small
ones) were directed against the Red Army and two small ones
against the Western Allied armies. No German operation was

successful after the Donetz local counter—blow in February,

1943 (I do not count a small and temporary success like Kas-
sarine Pass, in Tunisia). This is important to remember in
considering the last German strategic offensive attempt in the
summer of 1943, around the Kursk Arc. «
Concurrently with and immediately after Stalingrad, the
Red Army had lifted the blockade of Leningrad, and had
recaptured Rostov (which had been lost to the enemy for the
second time in 1942). It had pushed a salient beyond Kursk
between the German-held strongholds of Orel and Kharkov.

The Germans were afraid of this great salient which had

been built up into a gigantic fortress (they were right because;

in fact the Kursk salient when it started rolling in early
August, 1943, ended up 21 months later non-stop, 900 miles
and 1,100 miles to the west, on the Elbe and the Muerz.)
The German High Command decided on a minimum and
a maximum plan. Plan-minimum envisaged nipping off the
Soviet salient at Kursk and the destruction of the Soviet
armies concentrated there..Plan-maximum envisaged, in addi-
tion, a breakthrough of the Soviet front and a new march
on Moscow. . *
Just before this offensive, the Germans, sensing that the

Western Allies, Italy-bent, would not invade France, concen-g

trated 207 German and 50 satellite divisions on the Soviet

front. Just as the Western Allies were taking their ﬁrst steps 1

in Sicily, the storm broke over the Kursk salient.

Reviving the pincer-pattern, 17 armored divisions and 21.

infantry and motorized divisions struck at the Kursk arc from
both ﬂanks (from Orel and from Belgorod). No such concen-

tration of tankshad hitherto been assembled. (It was matched A
and bettered only by the Russians during the Oder break-
/ through in April, 1945). - 

The German grand offensive lasted little morethan two
weeks and penetrated less than 20 miles in depth*_. As the
battle developed toward its climax, the Germans threw in
one-ﬁfth of the 250-odd divisions they had on the Eastern
Front. A month after the start of the enemy offensive the
Red Army had not only repelled it, but had captured Orel

and Belgorod (the Western Allies captured Catania in Sicily,

on that very same day, August 5). The Germans on the

Eastern Front had suffered in one month the following losses,

in men killed and captured (not counting the wounded),
and materiel destroyed and.captured:

The German front was broken through in the widest astra-
tegic sense of the word. The Soviet offensive spread from the
Kursk bulge to the Dnepr and up and down its course, from

, the Smolensk Gap to the Black Sea. Generally speaking, after
. Kursk the Red Army never stopped anymore until it reached
Berlin and Vienna, except to repel occasional German counter-'

thrusts and for regrouping. After Kursk, never was the entire
Eastern front quiet again, not even during the ﬂoods of
Spring (in March, April and May, 1944, the Red Army
marched to the Carpathians and recaptured Odessa and

e Sevastopol). After its terriﬁc defeat at Kursk the Wehrmacht

could only retreat with occasional attempts at making a stand

‘on such’ exceptionally advantageous defensive positions as

the Dnepr, the Dnestr, the Vistula, the Danube and the
Oder and in the Carpathians. In fact, the “march to the Spree”
was on.

While the Battle of the Kursk Arc was developing (together _

with the subsequent Soviet offensive) and -the Eastern Front

was keeping some 2 50 enemy divisions busy, ﬁghting on other

fronts was engaging a score of enemy divisions in Sicily and
Italy and another score or so in Yugoslavia. Thus, in the
summer of 1943 the ratio between the “volume of ﬁghting”
on the Eastern Front and on all the other fronts of Europe
was more than 6: 1. This ratio will appear still more dramatic
when one looks on the map at Sicily, Southern Italy and Yugo-
slavia on one hand and at the land ‘mass between the Arctic
Ocean and the Black Sea on the other. '
Let us now look at the amount of lend-lease materials re-
ceived by the U.S.S.R. up to the end of 1943, i.e., the stuff
that was used by the Red Army during the campaigns of

, 1943 (we have already seen that nothing could have been

used ‘at Moscow and very little in the daysof Stalingrad and
the 1942-1943 winter). . 4
FEA chief Leo T. Crowley reported in March, 1944 (New
. 25

 

 

 

York Times, March 12, 1944) that up to December, 1943, the
U.S.S.R. had _received lend-lease valued at $4,241,oo0,0oo, or
slightly more than one quarter of the total amount lent and
leased by the U.S.A. to Allied powers. This amount repre-
sented as far as munitions of war go, 7,800 planes, less than
5,000 tanks, 33,000 “jeeps,” 173,000 trucks, and other materials
such as machines, food, special metals, etc. (This total by
far did not reach the U.S.S.R. in time for the Battle of
Kursk.)

A It is enough to turn back to the statistics of Soviet materiel
losses during the ﬁrst two years of the war to realize that this
was a small, though welcome, addition to the Soviet arsenal.
(During the first two years of war, the Red Army lost 35,000
guns, 30,000 tanks and 23,000 planes and inﬂicted on the
Germans the following losses: 56,500 guns, /42,400 tanks and
43,000 planes.)

THE F0 UR TH PERIOD

This is the period beginning after the Battle of the Kursk

Arc and ending with the German capitulation at Berlin. Al-
most two years of ﬁghting are lumped together into one “pe-
riod,” by me, because the campaigns of these two years are

characterized by one common feature: the Red Army was al-,

ways on the offensive and the German Army was always on the
defensive. This “Kursk-Berlin” period can be subdivided into
two distinct phases: during the ﬁrst period (August, 1943-

June, 1944) the Red Army continued to ﬁght the German‘

Army virtually alone, thus rounding out almost three years
during which the Western Allies fought only against minor
enemy forces, while during the second phase the European
war assumed its long—awaited two-front pattern.

Following the victory of ‘ Kursk-Orel-Kharkov, the Red
Army offensive spread along the front and in one sweep
reached and hurdled the lower half of the Dnepr and

reached the upper Dnepr. In the Fall it cleared the Donetz ”

Basin. In the winter it broke the Germans on the Leningrad
front and reached the Narova and the Lake of Pskov. In
‘ 26

 

 

|_p_|__aA

the Spring it reached the Dnestr and crossed into Rumania
over the Prut and reached the Carpathians. It cleared the
Crimea and recaptured Sevastopol. In early June it crushed
Finland. Thus, by the time the Western Front was opened
by the Western Allies on June 6, 1944, the Germans in the
East had already lost everything they had been ﬁghting for.
They had been frustrated in the attainment of all their stra-
tegic goals in the U.S.S.R., both unlimited and limited.
During this phase, the Germans were keeping well over
three-quarters of their divisions in the East because they well
knew that the Western Allies were not ready to do anything
exceptcontinue to ﬁght the slogging campaign in Italy where
they still faced the same twenty-odd enemy divisions, with the
Yugoslav Army holding almost as many divisions with no
tanks,,a handful of planes, and no shipping to bring supplies.
During this phase of the war the aerial offensive against
Germany from the West was only beginning to hamper the
German industrial effort, but the Red Army could not possibly

A A have felt its effects until the end of 1944 and the beginning

of 1945, if then. I say “if then” because the study of the
operations of the latter period (such as the Battle of the
Vistula and the Battle of Hungary) shows very plainly that
the Germans did not lack equipment. This is proved, among
other things, by the fact that during their defensive counter-
blow near Budapest around Christmas time, 1944, they were
able to squander as many as 200 tanks a day during more
than a week. An army which feels the industrial pinch cannot
afford such lavishness. ' .

On March 7, 1944, we see a New York Times headline:
“Air war at peak . . . loose 2,000 tons on German capital.”
On May 2, 1944-“81,400 tons hit Nazis in April.” On June
2——“118,940 tons rained on Europe in May.” July- 3, 1944-
“122,750 tons poured on the Germans in June.”

Thus, from these ﬁgures we can draw the conclusion that
of the roughly 1,500,000 tons dropped on Germany and
Europe during the whole war (from the West) less than
500,000 tons were dropped during the time when the Red
Army was retreating from the Bug to the Volga and advanc—

almost reaching its pre-1939 border and crossing it at some

points. In November, 1943, the RAF and the U.S. Eighth 4 
Air Force dropped 13,000 tons according to the New York.

Times, December 10, 1943; during August, September and
October, 1943, the RAF and USAAF together dropped
70,000 tons; a number of other ﬁgures, such‘ as a weight of
17,000 tons dropped during the “peak week” of February 13,
1944, as reported in the New York Times of May 6, 1945,
all show that the really heavy bombing of Germany started
after the Red Army had already set Germany on her heels
by wresting from her all the fruits of her conquests in th

East. 1 A ‘
. The tonnage of bombs dropped on German-held Europe
from the west before D-Day (probably not more than half a
million tons during roughly thirty months) is interesting

to compare with the 66,000 tons of shells ﬁred against the A
enemy by American forces during less than 3 months (82 days) = 5

on Okinawa. The area of Okinawa is less than 500 square
miles. The area‘ of German-held Europe was more than

1,000,000 square" miles. Europe in two years got only eight 4
times the explosives the pin-point of Okinawa got in 82 days.

The above ﬁgures conclusively prove the correctness ‘of
the statement by Soviet Professor S. Vishnev, who says (Soviet
Information Bulletin, July 7, 1945): “Besides weapons and
materiel, the Allies rendered economic support'to the Red
Army, weakening Germany’s war potential by blockade and
aerial bombing. Germany’s industrial centers hit by the

1 Allied Air Forces were largely reduced, but the effect was not

felt by the Soviet Armies before 1944-1945.”

Thus, up to the end of the second phase of the Fourth A

Period, i.e., up to the moment of the commencement of the
finaldrive from two sides, the Red Army had received only

very scant assistance from any quarter and its ‘emergence on A
v a line running from Viborg to Narva, Gomel, Sarny, Czerno-

witz and Odessa must be credited overwhelmingly to the

128

 

A The two-front war, against Germany began at long last on
June 6, 1944. This last phase was to last for eleven months.
The invasion of France was followed 17 days later by the

_ Red Army offensive across the Upper Dnepr (the Battle of
Belorussia). While the Western Allies were battling in the

Cotentin Peninsula (the Battle of the Hedgerows), the Red
Army crashed from the Dnepr to the Bug and Neman, to
the near approaches to Riga, to the Upper Vistula, and to the
San. At the time of the Allied breakthrough at St. Lo, in
Normandy, the Red Army had cleared all Soviet territory
except for the western half of the Baltic region and the
southern part of Bessarabia.

The over—all line-up of enemy forces during this campaign
was approximately this: 100 enemy divisions facing the Allies

A in Western Europe, Italy and Yugoslavia; at least 240 enemy

divisions facing the Red Army on a curving 1,300-mile front
from the mouth of the Narova (Gulf of Finland) to the mouth
of the Dnestr (not counting the still active front in Lapland
where action stopped only toward the end of October). The
estimate of 240 enemy divisions operating on the Eastern

»Front in the summer of 1944 is based on the fact that the

Germans themselves said they had 200 divisions between the
Baltic and the Carpathians alone, as well as on the incon-
trovertible fact that in the battles of encirclement at Minsk
(July) and Kishinev-Jassy (August), as well as in Kurland,
the Germans lost close to 55 divisions encircled and anni-
hilated, or blockaded and left to rot until they surrendered
(in Latvia) in May, 1945.

After August 1, while the Allied armies were sweeping
almost without opposition from St. L0 to the German border,
the Red Army was ﬁghting for every town and village, for
every marshy little river right up to’ the border of East
Prussia and Czechoslovakia. While the Allies fought a counter-
blow by six German divisions at Avranches, the Red Army
warded off a counterblow by 30 German divisions before
Warsaw. 

As the Allies entered Paris amid cheers, the Red Ar’my~ en-
circled, near _]:~assy-,« 15%German-infantry divisions and several

29

 

  

 

 

 

Rumanian divisions and shattered seven German divisions
which tried to break through to their encircled troops. The
Germans lost, at Jassy, 106,000 prisoners with 13 generals,
830 tanks, 3,500 guns and 33,000 motor vehicles. This opera-
tion ushered in the brilliant march to Vienna which upset
the entire German defense plan by attracting German strategic
reserves to the southern wing of the front, and forcing them to
weaken their Italian front by the withdrawal of several divi-
sions which were rushed into Hungary.

In December, von Rundstedt_began his ill-starred counter-
offensive against the Allies in the “Belgian Bulge.” While this
battle with 20 German divisions was raging, the Red Army
was warding off a similar blow in the Budapest-Lake Balaton
region. Rundstedt managed to escape from the Bulge with his
best troops, but in Budapest almost a score of German and
Hungarian divisions never got out of the trap.

While the Allied Armies were regrouping and recuperating
from the Rundstedt blow, the Red Army opened its big winter
offensive on the Vistula (Jan. 15, 1945), in East Prussia, and
in Czechoslovakia.

When the Western Allies made their famous crossing of
the Rhine, at Remagen (early March, 1945), the Red Army
had already reached the Oder and was getting ready to strike
at Vienna.

At last the pay-off was at hand.

In the West the Germans offered only sporadic, spotty and
uncoordinated resistance to the Allied Armies. Up to April,
1945, any large movement of German troops took place usually
from West to East. Now German divisions were scurrying
westward . . . to surrender to -the Americans and British.

While the Allies were marching, against little opposition, to

the Elbe, the Red Army effected its-massive breakthrough on '

the Oder (end of April) and began the battle of Berlin
against 100-odd German divisions. Simultaneously, the East
Prussian pocket was liquidated and the enemy defenses were
broken through in Upper Silesia and in Austria.’

The Red Army battered its way into Berlin .21 day before

30

 

 

the British entered Hamburg and three days‘ before General
Patton roared into Linz. During ﬁve days after the German
capitulation (May 8), the Red Army fought a whole German
army group across the western part of Czechoslovakia. The
last shots of the war were ﬁred on the Eastern Front on

May 13, 1945-
The Cost
HUMAN LOSSES

Only the ﬁgures on American and British Empire losses
have been made public. Taking only the killed, missing and
prisoners, we see that U.S. losses are roughly 450,000 of which
it is estimated that six-sevenths were incurred in the European-
African theatre of war. Thus, in the war against Germany,
American casualties (killed, prisoners and missing) are about
375,000 men.

British Empire casualties (killed, prisoners and missing.

both in the Armed Forces and civilians) are roughly 865,000,
of which probably 700,000 were incurred in the war against

5 Germany and her satellites. Thus the total of Western Allied

casualties (killed, prisoners and missing) in the war against
Germany is slightly more than 1,000,000 men.

Soviet military casualties have not been computed for the
whole war. We know ofﬁcially only that during the ﬁrst three

years of the war the Soviet Armed Forces lost (in killed, pris- *

oners and missing) 5, 300,000 men. Considering that during the
fourth year of the war such gigantic battles as the Battle of
Belorussia, Poland, the Danube, East Prussia and Germany
were fought, it is reasonable to assume that the Soviet casual-
ties for the whole war are not far from 6.5 million men. Thus
we have a ratio of 6.5: 1 as between Anglo-American casualties
and Soviet casualties.

As to casualties among the civilian population of the Soviet
regions which were occupied by the Germans-“Thou alone,
0 Lord, knoweth their numbers." ' 4

’MA TERIAL COST AND LEND-LEASE

The total amount in lend-lease materials sent by the U.S,A.
to the U.S.S.R. through to. April 1, 1945 is as follows (in
thousands of dollars): 7-

_ Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 8,409,695

This total of almost eight and one-halfbillion dollars repre-

sents, among other thing:

Motor vehicles of all types . . . . . .4’ . . . . . . . . Q 406,000

If one adds to this the lend-lease material received by the

U.S.S.R. from or through Great Britain, the total will amount '

to $ 1o,000,o0o,o00. -

The above ﬁgures have to be viewed against the back- .

ground of other ﬁgures, such as the following:

The U.S.A. spent on the war close to $3o0,0o0,000,0o0.
Thus, even if one should include lend-lease from Britain, the
U.S.S.R. received slightly more than three cents of every
dollar’ spent on the war by the U.S.A.

According to the estimate of French Minister Pierre Cot,
the U,S.S.R. spent the "equivalent of 17o,00o,o00,000 gold

32

dollars on the war against Germany. Thus, if weaccept the
ﬁgure (and it is more than plausible, if one takes into con-
sideration the enormous amount of ﬁghting done by the Red
Army) we see that lend-lease equipment and materials
amounted to less than 6 per cent of what the Soviet Union
manufactured itself and used in the war.

It also must be considered that a substantial part of lend-
lease went to the Soviet Far East to bolster the Far Eastern
Red Armies for the eventual struggle against the Japanese
Army. Thus, not all the munitions which were lent and leased
to the U.S.S.R. went to the German front.

It must also be remembered that the above ﬁgures represent
stuff delivered f.o.b. at American ports. How much stuff was
sunk in the terrible run to Murmansk, especially in the
early months, we don't know.

"And here is another angle to the question: On the basis
of Soviet material battle losses during the ﬁrst three years of
the war only (30,000 planes, 49,000 tanks and 48,000 guns),
we can surmise that such Soviet lossesfor the’ whole warwere
no less than 35,000 planes, 60,000 tanks and 60,000 guns.
Now, the Red Army obviously not only replaced its losses,
but added to its equipment as compared with the ﬁrst years
of the war. Thus, taking the losses to be one-third of the stuff
available at the time, we see that Soviet industry must have
produced no less than four times the above ﬁgures of losses
(inclusive of replacements) z'.e., a total of some 140,000 planes,
240,000 tanks and 240,000 guns.

These ﬁgures are borne out by the following fragmentary
data: one Soviet tank factory alone produced 35,000 tanks
during the war; one factory alone built 15,000 planes; the
Stalin Ordnance Works alone produced 95,000 guns of all
calibres. , 1

Looking at the lend-lease ﬁgures of materials shipped to
the U.S.S.R. during the battles of Moscow and Stalingrad,
we see that the amount could not have had an appreciable
inﬂuence on their outcome. (Practically no materials had
arrived during the Battle of "Moscow. As to the battle of

33

 

 

 

  

had reached the U.S.S.R. at that time.) _

At the time of the Battle of Kursk when the last German
offensive attempt was shattered, the U.S.S.R. had been allotted
only slightly more than $2,0oo,000,0oo of stuff (the United_

Kingdom had already received two and one-half times that 4

amount). V

Thus we see very plainly that the decisive battles of Moscow
and Stalingrad were won almost exclusively with Soviet stuff.
The victory in the Battle of Kursk was made easier by lend-
lease. -
It must, of course, be understood that such inconspicuous
lend-lease items as those entered as “miscellaneous” probably
contain precious alloy metals, vitamins, or sulfa drugs, etc.,
whose value in the struggle cannot be measured in tons or
dollars because they mean the saving of human lives through
tougher tank armor, better diet, medication, etc.

In order to grasp the whole idea of lend-lease, one must
understand its basic meaning: the U.S.A. in 1941, 1942, and
even 1943, was not able to put enough trained men in the
ﬁeld to use all the stuff they could produce under the peace-
ful conditions prevailing in the U.S.A., with their immense
resources and industrial establishments. It was natural then
for the U.S.A. to give part of what it produced to those men
who were on the spot, were trained to use the stuff and were
in a position to use it to the best advantage.

Some of the stuff lent and leased was as important, to take
a trivial and homely example, as a box of matches while
camping. One man cut, trimmed and hauled the wood for
the camp ﬁre. Another brought the matches. True, it would
have been possible to light the ﬁre by rubbing sticks, but it
would have taken so much longer. Without the 400,000
trucks and other vehicles received by the Red Army it would
undoubtedly have moved slower. Without vitamins and lard
it would have been weaker. Without sulfa drugs more men
would have suffered more. And so on down the line.

Lend-lease was well given and well used. This means that

34

 

Stalingrad, only about one-seventh of all lend-lease stuff V

it was to the mutual advantage and all talk about “charity,”
or “ingratitude” is so much nonsense.

The object of talking about it at all, except for the record,
is to show that on one hand lend-lease was highly important,
on the other that the U.S.S.R. did not in the least “live on
lend-lease only” because it produced, on its own resources,
90 per cent of some items, 75 per cent of others, 100 per cent
of still others, probably an average of 95 per cent of all it used
in this war (this estimate is based on the ﬁgures of the prob-
able total cost of the war to the U.S.S.R. and on the value of
lend-lease received).

I think that Generalissimo Stalin put the whole thing clearly
when he said on June 12, 1945, in a message to President
Truman: -

“On the day of the third anniversary of the conclusion
of the Soviet American agreement on the principles to
be applied to mutual assistance in the conduct of the war
against aggression, I beg. you and the U.S. Government
to accept this expression of gratitude from the Soviet
Government and myself personally.

“This agreement, on the basis of which the U.S.
throughout the whole war in Europe, through lend-lease,
has been supplying the S.U. with arms, strategic mate-
rials and food, played an important part in and made a
considerable contribution to the successful conclusion of
the war against the common enemy, Hitlerite Germany.”

And Soviet People's Commissar of Finance Arseny Zverev
said, in presenting the 1945 budget to the Supreme Soviet
(Parliament):

“In making a preliminary review of the ﬁnancing of
the Red Army, we must remember the substantial assis~
tance received in 1944 as well as during this year from our
Allies, in the form of armaments, materiel and foodstuffs."

It would be unfair to deny that lend-lease assistance was
“substantial," but it would be just as unfair to claim that it
was these supplies, which, thrown into the scales, turned the
balance in favor of Russia simply because the balance had

35

 

already been basically turned in the-Battles of Moscow and

 

 

 
  
 

Stalingrad. .
Lend-lease to the U.S.S.R. did not win the war,‘ but it
speeded its victorious conclusion. '

The Role of Air Power

In speaking of the role of air power in the war against
Germany, it is impossible to omit the so-called Battle of

Britain. Without in the least detracting from the staunchness »

and courage of the British peop1e——qualities which are known
all over the world—in a battle which made “so many owe so
much to so few,” this battle must be viewed in its true per-
spective. In the brilliant phrase of Churchill we ﬁnd the very
negation of the erroneous idea that the so-called Battle of

Britain could have won the war. No handful of heroic young

men can win a modern global war. What British resistance did

i was to prevent the war from being dragged out for many

   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
   

years longer than it did, but it did not win it for the simple
reason that it could not win it.
The notion that Britain “stood alone” and repelled the

Nazi ﬂood from its shores also is erroneous. The myth of the .

German invasion attempts in the late summer of 1940 has

been dispelled. The famous invasion barges photographed by.

British ﬂiers in the‘ mouth of the Schelde turned out to be
only ﬁfty in number and were hardly designed to carry the
invasion. Another myth—the story of the wall of ﬁre around
Britain’s shores burning to death the invasion ships and
troops has also‘ been exploded. Such a wall of ﬁre was pre-
pared and we even saw it in the movies in 1945, but no Ger-
man invasion was burned in the purely experimental holo-
caust. .

But the fact that the Germans did not invade Britain,
remains incontrovertible. Why didn't they do it?

History givesius anexample and a parallel which is worth
examining, but with all the caution with which historical
parallels and “repetitions" should be approached.

In early 1805 Napoleon had collected an army of 130,000
and was building 2,000 special ﬂat-bottomed boats ‘for the
invasion of England. All this was concentrated at the camp
of Boulogne. The British and French ﬂeets in those days
played a part" not unsimilar to that which. aviation played
in 1940. Some people think that it was the defeat of the

French ﬂeet under Villeneuve at Trafalgar by Nelson which A

saved England. But the fact is that Napoleon suddenly lifted

his camp at Boulogne in the summer of 1805 (weeks before \

Trafalgar) and marched to the Danube and the victories of
Elchingen, Ulm and Austerlitz. He turned his back on Eng-

_ land in order to face the threat of the Austro-Russian coali-

tion on the Danube.

' Now, in 1940 the situation was not without parallel if one
considers that precisely at the time when France was collaps-
ing and Germany seemed free to turn its entire armed might

against almost defenseless England, the Red Army advanced V

to the Baltic, to the border of East Prussia, to the Prut and
the mouths of the Danube, taking up its “initial position”
for the coming epic struggle against Germany and German-

9 held Europe. Hitler read “the writing on the Eastern Wall.”

It is clear that this was the determining factor which made
the modern “Napoleon” give up any idea of the invasion of
England, and start preparing for his march to the East.

Thus, it is clear that England was not in the least “alone”
in that summer of 1940. The fact that so many‘Englishmen
did not know it makes theiriheroic struggle still more glori-
ous in the eyes of the world. Between August 8 and October 31,
1940, the British fought off a part of the Luftwaffe (but not
all of it because the rest was watching the eastern ramparts).
-The British lost one out of every ﬁve houses destroyed or
damaged, they lost several thousand people. They downed

”2,375 German planes and lost about 750 themselves. They

lost 37 5 airmen killed. But their industries continued to grow
and Britain emerged from, the battle with a reorganized and
rejuvenated army, because she had not been invaded and,
except for the Channel Islands, no German foot was set on
British soil. The key to that fact is to be found in Tallin,

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Sergei Kournakoff is one of the foremost military analysts

to emerge from World War II. Unlike many armchair and

air wave strategists, he is uniquely qualiﬁed as a writer on
military theory and practice by his entire career and back-
ground. Formerly a cavalry officer in the Imperial Russian
Army, he fought through World War I and the Russian Civil
War (on the “White” side).

Kournakoff is the author of Russia’s Fighting Forces, pub-‘

lished by Duell, Sloan and Pearce and International Pub-
lishers, and of numerous articles on military matters which
have appeared in Soviet Russia Today and a number of other
magazines. He has won a wide reputation in the United States
as a writer and lecturer on military problems as they enfolded
in the crucible of the great war of liberation, and has called
the turn on major military events with almost uncanny
precision. On July 2, 1941, Sergei Kournakoif, in a speech at
Madison Square Garden, said: -

“Ten days ago Hitler hurled his Wehrmacht to eventual
and total destruction.”

Very few people agreed with him at the time.

Riga, Kaunas and Kishinev, into which the Red Army
marched at that time.

I have shown in preceding chapters that the aerial assault
on German~held Europe could not have had any appreciable
inﬂuence on the land war on the Eastern Front either in 1941,
1942, or 1943. Thus, it is clear that the Soviet victories of
Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk and on the Dnepr were won
without any appreciable assistance from the air power of
the western Allies in a wide over-all sense (however, it is pos-
sible, of course, that, for example, a British air blow at the
port of Rostock did hamper German communications on the
Leningrad front for awhile). Now what about the campaigns
of 1944? Were they materially assisted by Western air power?

Numerous highly paid pressure salesmen for aviation con-
cerns, sanguine prime-ministers, certain enthusiastic air gen-
erals with a juvenile outlook on war, as well as numerous
headline hunters have been trying ever since 1943 to sell the
world the idea that air power, almost alone, was turning the
trick. . '

Chief Air Marshal Harris said in 1943: “Every ton of
bombs dropped on German industries will save the lives of
ten United Nations soldiers when the invasion comes.” Ac-
cording to this statement, some ﬁfteen million United Nations
soldiers were saved by the bombing‘, of Germany which is
about twice the number they lost altogether, and about three
times the number the western Allies put in the ﬁeld. The

4 absurdity of this assertion does not need any explanation.

Fawning and servile Nazi generals and industrialists, diplo-
mats and even hausfraus, trying to ingratiate themselves with
the Western conquerors at the expense of the Eastern con-
querors, screamed, mumbled and whispered in a chorus:.
“You, Americans, won the war with your air power. We
would never have been beaten if it were not for your
bombers.”

On the other hand there are some factual statements and
documents which throw a realistic light on the question of the
role of strategic bombing on the German war effort during
the years 1944 and 1945. Here are some of them:

38

 

John McCormack of the New York Times reported from
Nuernberg on April 30, 1945, that two industrialists of the
gigantic Siemens-Schuckert Co. stated that their company’s
production reached its high peak in 1944.

In the preceding chapters we have shown that the Germans
used military equipment with great lavishness as late as De-
cember, 1944 (at Budapest, for instance, and later on in East
Prussia, in Poland, and on the Oder). Obviously they were
not short of planes, tanks, guns, shells, steel, oil, etc.

‘However, such reasoning might not sound convincing to
some. _
Let us turn to various statements by Allied authorities who

now .see that the main difﬁculties confronting German in- _

dustry are not so much plants and machines, but fuel and
manpower.

For instance, Drew Middleton cabled to the New York
Times (July 15, 1945), from Frankfort-on-the-Main:

“The factories, it will be argued, are, however, largely
intact and capable of being rehabilitated into full pro-
duction in the near future. This isn’t so. Considered
against the background of German economy today, they
cannot be expected to return to production for years to
come. For industry includes not only the plant and physi-
cal assets but fuel and labor as well. And in Germany
today the two principal shortages are coal and manpower,
shortages which cripple every part of German economy.”

Before the end of the war, especially in 1944, these crip-
pling factors operated only partially. On the other hand the

‘fact that German factories are “largely intact” is conﬁrmed.
‘Coal became scarce when it was seized. Men became scarce

when they were killed and captured. .
However, the most convincing document is a statement by

Senator Harley M. Kilgore (C. P. Trussell’s Washington dis-

patch to the New York‘ Times, August 8, 1945) in which he

said that captured documents of the German Ministry of ‘

Armaments and War Production (the reports were captured
in the spring of 1945) showed that “in 1944 three times as

39

   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

many armored ﬁghting vehicles, more "than three times as
many ﬁghter-bombers and eight times as many night bombers

‘ had been produced as in 1942. . . . In 1944 coal mining in
Germany was only slightly lower than in 1942, crude steel
only 11 per cent lower. Additional power plants were made
available in 1944. . . . By the autumn of 1944 suﬂicient reserves
of material had been accumulated, with the result that, in
spite of more diﬂicult conditions in the basic industry . . .
the output of armaments could be maintained and insome
cases even increased. . . ., .

“Taking the basis of 100 per cent in 1942, hard coal pro-’

duction in 1943 increased by 8 per cent. It was 11 percent

i le_ss last year. The production of aluminum increased by 3
per cent in 1943, and in 1944 by 11 per cent more. . . . If the ._
production of powder in 1942 be considered 10o.per cent, it
increased in 1943 to 158 per cent and reached 171 per cent .
in 1944. Forty-ﬁve per cent more explosives was produced in
1943 and 75 per cent more in 1944 than in 1942.” .

T Here are some facts submitted to the Kilgore Committee by
investigators who have returned from Germany to report on
the defeated nation's industrial capacity and the effects of
air bombing: Z

1. Germany today has 4,000,000 tons of machine tools and a
vast undamaged capacity of producing more.

2. The iron and steel industry, productive capacity 2 5,ooo,- ‘
000 tons a year, can be restored with only minor repairs.

3. The great chemical and dye industry—including that part
manufacturing expl0sives——is only slightly damaged.

4. The synthetic rubber industry can produce 10,000 tons
a year.

5. If the war had lasted six months more the entire oil
reﬁning and storage industry would have been underground,
safe from all bombing (this was before the atomic bomb
was announced).

“The total German productive capacity affected by the
bombing,” sums up London's Tribune (July 20) “was about
20 per cent; less than half the earlier expert estimates by
Bomber Command Public Relations.

40

“These are hardlfacts. They show that bombingdid not

win the war, contrary to what each and all of the captured

German generals hastened to assure us. 1

“Bombing did contribute to ﬁnal victory, but essentially so
only whenit was harmonized with land operations.” (In Fact,
August 20, 1945.)

Thus, we see that even in 1944 and in the beginning of
1945, strategic bombing did not reduce materially the power
of Germany to resist and that the common victory of the
Allies must be chieﬂy credited to the valor, skill and power
of their ‘armies. It follows from this, in the light of all the

T foregoing, that the Red Army carried the overwhelming

burden of the war against Germany and her satellites from
June 22, 1941, until June 6, .1944, or during almost three
years. It carried the larger part of the. burden from June,
1944, right up to V-E Day.

The Soviet.Air Force

Soviet military doctrine never envisaged air power as some-

thing which could bring a decision by itself. The Soviet Air A

Force is closely integrated with and in the Army and Navy.
Its main function was not strategic bombing, but close support

of the land operations. The plane was not considered as a

“thing in itself,” but as a member of a close—knit team work-
ing on land, sea and in the air.
A Therecord of the Soviet Air Force is nothing to be dis-

' missed with a shrug. On the basis of the known ﬁgure of 60,-
1000 German planes downed on the Eastern Front during the
_ ﬁrst three years of war, it is reasonable to assume that Soviet
; ﬂiers and AA—defenses have disposed of approximately 80,000

German planes during the whole war. “
Information about‘ the work of the Soviet Air Force is frag-
mentary. But some of these fragments can give one an idea
of what the Soviet ﬂiers did.
For instance we know that in the Spring of 1943 Soviet ﬂiers
had to ﬁght three large-scale air battles. The Germans massed
2,000 planes ‘over the Kuban area, picked squadrons at that.

 

More than 100 air battles were fought here every day. Soviet
ﬂiers destroyed more than half of the enemy planes and mam-
tained their initiative. V

Just before the Battle of Kursk, the Germans launched

‘massed air raids on Rostov, Kursk, Yaroslavl, Gorky and other

cities. Kursk alone was raided repeatedly by 500-600 enemy
bombers. All onslaughts were repelled with huge losses to the
Germans. ‘

 

During the Battle of Kursk itself, i.e.', ‘during its ﬁrst days,

more than 1,000 German planes were downed.
Right from the start of the Battle of Belorussia imthe sum~

Amer of 1944, the Luftwaffe was swept out of the skies by the

Soviet ﬂiers.
Soviet ﬂiers and AA-defenses destroyed throughout the war
an average of more than 50 German planes per day.

The Soviet Navy

The four years of struggle of the Soviet Navy in theatres so
close to land differed markedly from classic naval wars. There

were nogrand naval battles between the main forces of the

opposing ﬂeets. Neither were there usual lulls in ﬁghting
which inevitably follow major engagements. -

The Baltic, Black and Barents Seas extended along the
1,800-mile ﬂanks of the vast land front where the outcome of
the war was being decided. Naturally, operations at sea were
subordinated to the objectives of the land front. ~ The prin-
cipal task of the Soviet Navy was to facilitate the operations
of the army. The Germans on the other hand did not wish
to risk their major naval units against the Soviet Navy be-
cause they intended to keep them intact for the future inva-
sion of Britain, when victory over the U.S.S.R. hadbeen won.

The Soviet Navy not only protected the communication

lines to Murmansk as well as across the Black Sea, but it took*

part in countless amphibious operations. Its river ﬂotillas did
yeoman work hand in hand with the Red Army.

just as in the case of the Soviet Air Force, there are no
comprehensive data on the work of the Soviet Navy as yet.

42

However, fragmentary data are available and they give a fairly
good idea of the whole. a e

In the summer of 1942 Soviet submarines sank more than V

60 German transports in the Baltic (total displacement-
5oo,ooo tons). _

During the ﬁve weeks preceding the ejection of the Ger-
mans from the Crimea, 200 German and Rumanian ships
were sunk in the Black Sea.

In the four weeks preceding the ouster of the Germans from
Lapland, more than 150 enemy vessels were sunk in the Far
North. V

In March, 1945, 350,000 tons of enemy shipping was ‘sunk
in the Baltic.

These ﬁgures show that .the naval war in the East, though
devoid of major naval battles, inﬂicted tremendous losses on
the enemy and the Soviet Navy can match the Battle of the
Atlantic with the long and gruelling Battles of the Barents,

Baltic and Black Seas.

Summary

All of the foregoing has served to demonstrate the following
truths: -

1. The Soviet Union made the major contribution toward
victory in World War II under incomparably more adverse
external conditions than those under which Russia was

defeated in World War I. Obviously, the explanation of this

fact lies in the internal conditions of the country. '

2. Russia had space at its command, in fact more space

~ than the Soviet Union had (the central sector of the border

of the Russian Empire in 1914 was some 250 miles farther
from Moscow than the border of the U.S.S.R. was in 1941).
As to the c1imate—snow, mud, frost, etc.——it can be said the
climate of the Soviet Union is no different than the climate
of Imperial Russia. Furthermore, it must be noted that the
Red Army won its greatest victories in winter, summer,
autumn and spring.

43

   

4:.

3. The decisive battles of the Soviet-German war, at
Moscow and Stalingrad, were won without appreciable assist-
ance either from the Western air war against Germany or
from lend-lease. During the summer battles of 1943 both
categories of help were only beginning to be felt. How-
ever, neither type of help became considerable until the fourth
period of the war. ‘

 

4. The Soviet people have paid the greatest price of all ;

nations in blood, devastation and treasure. They could stand
the price because of their internal organization. While Im-

Q perial Russia was growing weaker and weaker under the

hammerblows of World War I, the Soviet Union was growing

' stronger and stronger in the war against Germany and its

satellites. This radical and decisive difference cannot be

cred-ited to the “traditional” heroism of the Russian people,

simply because this quality was inherently present in 1914.
5. The course of the war plainly shows that it was the

Battle of Moscow which killed the blitz and the legend of"
German invincibility, and the Battle of Stalingrad which’

marked the end of ‘German offensive power. I 4
It now remains to be seen what made this tremendous and
brilliantly successful Soviet war effort possible.
The over-all plan of this effort was broadcast by Marshal
of the Soviet Union Stalin in his radio address of July 3, 1941

(twelve days after the German attack). In this address, con: i

ceived in the darkest hours Russia had ever experienced,
Marshal_ Stalin expressed the supreme conﬁdence of the
Soviet people in victory when he said “this (the German)
army. . . can be smashed and will be smashed, as were the
armies of Napoleon and Wilhelm.”

At the same time he proceeded, calmly and deliberately to _

outline the nation’s plan of defense.
The concept of the People’s War was expressed in the words:
“Side by side with the Red Army, the entire Soviet people
are rising in defense of their native land.” V r
The concept of scorched earth was expressed in the words:
“In case of forced retreat of Red Army units .4 . . the enemy

44

 

must not be left a single engine, a single railroad car, not a .

single pound of grain or gallon of fuel. . . . All valuable
property . . . which cannot be withdrawn must be destroyed
without fail.” -

The plan for guerrilla (partisan) warfare in the enemy rear,

was planned as follows:
“In areas occupied by the enemy, guerrilla units, mounted

' and on foot, must be formed, ‘diversionist groups must be

organized to combat the enemy troops, to foment guerrilla
warfare everywhere, to blow up bridges and roads, to damage
telephone and telegraph lines, to set ﬁre» to forests, stores and
transports.”

The concept of the Great Patriotic War was expressed thus:

“This war with "fascist Germany cannot be considered an
ordinary war. It is not only a war between two armies; it is
also a great war of the entire Soviet people against the
German-fascist forces. The aim of this national war in defense
of our country . . . is not only elimination of the danger
hanging over our country, but also aid to all European
people groaning under the yoke of German fascism.”

And, prophetically he declared:‘

“In this war of liberation we shall not be alone. In this
great war we shall have loyal allies in the peoples of Europe
and America. . . . Our war for the freedom of our country

A will merge with the struggle of the peoples of Europe and

America for their independence, for democratic liberties. . . .

Finally, on popular levies to assist the Red Army in combat,‘

especially in the defense of great cities (such as Leningrad,

' Odessa, Tula, Moscow, Voronezh, ‘Stalingrad, Sevastopol):

“. . . popular levies must be raised in every city which is
in danger of enemy invasion, all the working people must
be roused to defend our freedom, our honor, our country. . . .”

And on the leadership for this great effort:

“In order to insure rapid mobilization of all the forces of
the peoples of the U.S.S.R. . . . a State Committee of Defense
has been formed in whose hand the entire power of the State

. has been vested. The State Committee of Defense has entered

45

 

  
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
   
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 

on its functions and calls upon all our people to rally around
the Party of Lenin-Stalin and around the Soviet Government
so as self-denyingly to support the Red Army and Navy,
destroy the enemy and secure victory.”

Here was the grandiose plan which made the Soviet war
effort possible. Titanic effort is reﬂected in its every word.
Take for instance the four simple words in the sentence
about the destruction or evacuation of valuable property-
“which cannot be withdrawn.” But great industries were with-
drawn and “put on wheels” in the Ukraine, in Belorussia, in
Leningrad, and the Donbas. They were moved in July and
August, 1941, hundreds of (and even more than a thousand)
miles to the east and set up in the wilderness with such dis-
patch that their military products—-tanks, guns and planes
made their appearance at the front in November, during the
crucial Battle of Moscow. The men who set up these industries
often lived in igloos and snow dugouts for weeks because the
machine shops had to be set up before the dwellings for the
men could be built.

Take, for instance, a tank factory evacuated in July, 1941,
from the vicinity of Kharkov to somewhere around Nizhni-
Taghil in the Urals. The distance by rail is‘ more than 1,200
miles. The trip east over bombed rail lines, against the tide
of general mobilization moving west, the setting up of factory

cold and privation are an epic in themselves. And in spite
of all that, tanks manufactured in the transplanted factory
made their appearance in the‘Batt1e of Moscow, only four
months later. ,

Perhaps the reader of this account will feel that in setting
up the balance sheet of the war I did notgive enough credit
to the American-British Battle of the Atlantic. Of course,
this battle was a miracle of organization, dogged determina-
tion, magniﬁcent seamanship and all-around heroism, but isn't
it balanced by the Battle of the Great Russian Plain in which
whole industries moved eastward hundreds and thousands of
miles and later their products moved back westward to the
front? Only it was trains that moved instead of ships, with

46

 

 

buildings in the wilderness, the unspeakable conditions of *

 

men freezing in cabooses and on open platforms instead of on
bridges and decks. Trains being bombed just as the ships
were. The comparison would have been still more apt if the
Allied convoys in the Atlantic had had to carry a lot of in-
dustries, say, from France in 1940 to Detroit, and then carry
their products back to the European Front. The Battle of the
Great Russian Plain/was a two-way affair.

The famous Soviet weapons such as the rocket-gun “Katu-
sha” (which later acquired quite a “family” in the persons of
“Andryusha,” “Ivan the Terrible,” etc.), the new Stalin tank,
the new ﬁghters and “stormoviks” (attack planes), the anti-
tank gun, were born in the darkest days of the war, under
the indescribable conditions of the mass migration of heavy
industry to the East.

Stupendous as these achievements are in themselves, the
planning and controlling apparatus is still more stupendous.
There is not the shadow of a doubt that all this was planned
and controlled by the Communist Party and its leaders. It was
the Communists who invariably provided the leadership in
partisan warfare and were the mainspring of the total effort in

the people's war. They knew where they were going and

that is why they came to victory, in spite of all adverse condi-
tions and obstacles.

The industrial effort of the Soviet Union under the condi-
tions described above can be fully appreciated by Americans
reared in the tradition of American industrial achievement.

It is a different matter with the concept of the People's War
and Guerrilla War because America has never been invaded,
at least for the last 175 years, and seven or eight generations
of Americans never had the occasion to practice either type
of warfare.

This writer feels that it is not within his modest means to
describe fully the magniﬁcent scope and meaning of Soviet
Guerrilla warfare and People's War—that defense in depth
carried to its ultimate conclusion.

He therefore appends two Soviet accounts, one written by
a Guerrilla chief, the other by an eye-witness of the People's
War. These two documents, which appear at the end of this

booklet, will tell at least partof the story much better than
this writer ever could hope to do.

Decision in the Far East

The global war was bound to end globally. All the major
Allied powers inevitably were to play a role in the Far
Eastern decision. It had been clear ever since the day when
the Soviet Union cancelled the Japanese concessions in
Northern Sakhalin that the Red Army would take a hand
in the conﬂict at the proper moment. Now Japan is, militarily
speaking, through. Much has been said and written about the
causes which precipitated the Japanese surrender.

Over-enthusiastic scientists, justly proud of their successes
in unleashing atomic energy, claim that it was the atomic
bomb which ﬁnally licked Japan. 4

Some air generals with a juvenile outlook on the facts of
war and life assure the world that it was the superfortress
which, basically, did the job. . '

Here again we have two variants of the old so-called “air-
power-alone” theory. But the theory is no more convincing
in Asia than it was in Europe. \

It is true that new and powerful factors entered the war
against Japan in such quick succession that it is not easy

 

to decide which one of them was most instrumental in break-J

ing Japan’s “moral back.”

Large scale bombing of Japan from the Marianas bases
started in the Spring. Admiral Halsey and his Third Fleet
went on thebrampage along the shores of Japan on July 10,
and kept up a constant bombardment for three weeks. The
atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6. The
Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8.

On the face of it, Japan surrendered only after the Soviet
Union declared war. True, she had offered (tentatively) to
surrender in mid-July, but somehow nothing came of it then.

Japan had built up a great continental military and indus-

- ‘trial base in Manchuria. She most probably had hopes at least
to prolong the wartby holding out there even after Allied

landings in Japan were made. The military leadership of the
United States was obviously ﬁguring on that because as late
as the ﬁrst week in August there still was seemingly serious
talk of the need of seven million American troops to subdue
the Japanese army in Asia.

The entry of the Soviet Union into the fray made all this
unnecessary. The ten-day whirlwind campaign of the three Far
Eastern Soviet armies over a theatre of more than half a mil-
lion square miles was a blow which knocked the props from
under any Japanese idea of continuing resistance outside
]apan itself. ’

The truth of the matter is that while Soviet military action
in Manchuria shortened the war for the United States, so
the brilliant three-year effort of the armed forces of the United
States made the Soviet whirlwind tempo in Manchuria pos-
sible.

The main military factor, within the limits of the period of
warfare in the Far East and in the Pacific, contributing to the
defeat of Japan, was the dogged, efﬁcient and heroic march
of American forces from the International Dateline to the
shores of Japan. The greater glory (if glory can be thus
apportioned) goes to the United States Navy and its correlated
branches of the service. «

However, in considering the actions from Tarawa’ to
Okinawa and from Guadalcanal to Borneo and Luzon, we
should not forget the fact that all these countless hard-won
enemy strongholds would have been garrisoned by the Japan-
ese much more strongly, if the Soviet Union had not managed
to keep about a million crack troops on the Manchu border
throughout the European war (even when, in the life and
death struggle before Moscow and Stalingrad, every single
man counted) thus immobilizing a large Japanese army.

Here are some ﬁgures on the Japanese contingents in

Only in 1943-1944 did‘ the Japanese forces in Manchuria
decrease somewhat because the Japanese command realized
that it was too late to. attack the Soviet Union, but still too
early for the Soviet Union to attack her. But the moment
Germany surrendered, Japanese troops began to stream north-
ward from China into Manchuria to face the threat of the
Red Army thus enabling Chiang Kai-shek’s troops to win
‘some local victories south of the Yangtze. J

The question arises now as to why the Japanese did not.

attack the Soviet Union at the time of the Battle of Moscow
or the Battle of Stalingrad? The answer is that they had
received,two painful lessons in 1938 and "1939 (at Changku-
feng and at the Kalkin-Ghol) and had found out that their
army could not stand up against the Red Army even under
circumstances favorable to Japanese arms.

General (now Marshal) Zhukov had, in the summer of 1939
at Kalkin-Ghol, given the Japanese a foretaste of what was
going to happen to them in the summer of 1945. The result
was that ever since then the Japanese, while keeping more or
less quiet in Manchuria, were compelled to divert to that po-
tential front a great portion of their best troops from the
struggle against the United States and Great Britain. Thus
the contribution of the Soviet Union in the Far Eastern war
goes far beyond the actual ﬁghting which took place after
August 8, 1945. It antedates~Pearl Harbor by almost three
and one-half years.

This contribution should be viewed against the background if

of the terriﬁc struggle of the Red Army against Germany. The
ability to maintain a large and modern, almost self-suﬂicient
establishment some 5,000 miles from the European front when
every man and every gun were needed before Moscow, Stalin-
grad and Leningrad, is a great achievement in itself.

*At that time Japan kept in Manchuria half of her artillery, three-
quarters of her cavalry and two-thirds of her tanks.

APPENDIX

GUERRILLAS on THE UKRAINE
By MAJOR GENERAL SIDOR KOVPAK
Twice Hero of the Soviet Union

The guerrillas of the Ukraine had reason to be envious of
their comrades in Byelorussia who were ﬁghting the invaders.
The vast forests and impassable swamps of Byelorussia were
favorable arenas for partisan warfare. Every detachment and
unit of the guerrillas there had its zone of action and a more
or less stable base in the forests, to which it returned after
an operation. *

Steppes predominate in the Ukraine. Facilities for shelter
are rare or non-existent. A blind emulation of the tactics used
by the Byelorussian guerrillas would lead to futile losses.
Other tactics had to be worked out. We discovered that the
most effective method for us was a swift and complex maneu-
ver, and we formed our striking units accordingly. Safety lay
in the suddenness of our appearance, the brevity of blows
dealt, and our swift withdrawal to great distances.

September 10, 1941 was a memorable day in my life. A
peaceful civilian chairman of the City Soviet of Workers
Deputies in the town of Putivl, Sumy Region, I made the
decision to remain in the territory occupied by the Germans
and to organize a guerrilla force.

My group at first included 13 people with whom I had
worked at various times and whom I could trust. Two months
passed in minor acts of diversion, a study of the enemy's
tactics, and most of all in establishing contact with the
population.

In guerrilla warfare the sympathy of the people and reliable
and constant contact with them are everything. Such warfare
is inconceivable without the support of the people; if the
population is with you, then you are invincible, no matter

how strong and well-armed the enemy may be. He who fails _

to understand this cannot understand the essence of our
strength.

Certain of ﬁnding supporters everywhere, and having estab-
lished close contact with reliable people in the towns and
villages, our detachment grew rapidly. Without difficulty I
increased the number of my ﬁghting men to 2,500. More could
have been added, but I did not consider this expedient. The
larger the striking units, the more difﬁcult it would be to
maneuver, and the greater the tendency to diminish the pace

of action. ‘
Constantly in action against the enemy beyond his lines

and in his hinterland, our detachment covered some 15,000‘

kilometers and several times forced such rivers as the Desna,
Dnepr, Pripet, Prut and Dnestr. We moved on an average
of 25 kilometers daily. This is no mean distance when one
remembers that our men advanced only by night and on foot;
our horses carried only the wounded and sick, ammunition
and food.

We were well armed with tommy guns and machine guns,
trench mortars and light cannon, including several 76-mm.
guns. Like all guerrillas, we acquired our arms at the expense
of the‘ enemy. ' I

I can say without exaggeration that we grew to be a terror
to the Germans. After striking a sudden blow and routing
one of the enemy garrisons, we. would vanish as abruptly as
we had appeared, burning the bridges behind us. The Ger-
mans would strike out in all directions, but within a short
time we would hit them again, some 200 to 300 and even 500
kilometers from the former place.

Having acquired considerable ‘battle experience in the war
zone, we began operations in the remote rear of the enemy.
Here are some examples:

In June, 1943, when the Red Army was ﬁghting its historic
battle at the Kursk bulge, we were engaged in an operation
in the Rovensk Region, some 800 kilometers from the front.
The Germans never expected us here. They had placed a
price on my head long before, but "now displayed incredible
generosity. In their newspapers they published a notice that
they would pay for my head 1oo,ooo rubles in gold or bullion,
as the murderer desired. This was a lot of money and I

52

couldn’t‘ help feeling a bit ﬂattered. Not once, however, did
the Germans catch me.

Finally they combed the- Rovno forests in grand style.
We had had similar experiences on no less than 30 previous
occasions—and this time too we broke out of the encirclement.

. Pushing westward to surprise the Germans we penetrated to

the oilﬁelds of Drogobych, in the Carpathians. This_ was in
July, 1943. While the Red Army was crushing the enemy’s
defenses at Sumy and Belgorod, we were destroying oilwells,
cracking plants and pipe-lines in the Carpathians, a thousand
kilometers from the front. ’
“Wieder—Kovpak!” (Kovpak again!) screamed the German
newspapers, and this time the enemy sent eight of his picked
regiments and ﬁve battalions to intercept us at Drogobych.
They planned to force us against the Carpathian heights. By
a complex maneuver we evaded them and got away in an
easterly direction to the Sluch River. True to our rules, our
partisan units on their way inﬂicted heavy losses on the

Germans. We approached our rendezvous in seven groups

along a front of 200 kilometers.

All that could prove of value to the enemy was burned and
destroyed.

There are some who say the successes of my detachment
were gained by s-heer luck. Luck has been with us at times, of
course, but it is impossible to beat the enemy again and again
by. luck alone. Miracles don't happen in war. Those who are
unable to ﬁght well are soon abandoned by fortune. Guerrilla
actions require creative skill. I remember one occasion when
fortune seemed to smile exclusively upon the enemy. Pursuing
us, the Germans closed in between the Dnepr and Pripet
Rivers. Here they massed six infantry divisions and two tank
regiments.

Superior in armaments, the enemy also outnumbered .us

20 to one. We were pressed against the Pripet and harried.

from its surface by _ﬁve armored tugs and 10 other well-armed
ships. It seemed they had us—and the Germans no doubt
anticipated the pleasure of an easy victory. Fierce ﬁghting
began, lasting for two days. The situation became puzzling:

53

 

we were beating the Germans, instead of their beating us.

They were never given a chance to beat us. The trick was
simple. Filtering through to the woods, we arose on the
enemy’s ﬂanks, struck suddenly, annihilated as many as we
could, and vanished. While our tommy guns mowed the
Germans down, now here and now there, our artillerymen
gave their attention to the enemy boats, and our sappers built
a ﬂoating bridge 240 meters long. Destroying the ﬂotilla, we
crossed the river and got away.

This engagement cost the Germans 1,100 dead ofﬁcers and
men. Our losses were one man killed and four wounded.
This could scarcely be termed luck. The entire operation was
well conceived and skilfully carried out.

My detachment during its period of action annihilated
18,000 German soldiers and 0fﬁcers——including three generals.
We also burned 55,000 tons of oil cached by the Nazis, derailed
many of their trains and wrecked many trucks loaded with
war materials. Our losses have been comparatively small.

Still in action in the Carpathians, my men are adding to
their list of victories day by day.

The following ﬁgures may give an idea of the scale of .

guerrilla actions in the Ukraine: The main detachments in
the Ukraine, exclusive of communications groups and scouts
in towns and villages, numbered 115,000 men. In all, this
force annihilated 310,000 German soldiers and oﬂicers, wrecked
4,060 locomotives and 39,700 freight cars, and blew up or-
burned 6,693 trucks, 810 tanks and armored cars, 324 guns
and 108 aircraft. .

The German conquerors hoped to establish themselves
ﬁrmly on the steppes of the Ukraine. They dreamed of
colonizing this country of lush pastures where Ukrainian
shepherd slaves would tend the splendid herds for them;
of fertile ﬁelds where people would gather great harvests of
wheat for them; of mines where subjugated people would
dig coal and ores for their enslavers.

Things turned out differently, and this was due in a

measure to the part played by the comrades-in-arms of the

Red Army~—the Ukrainian guerrillas.’

THE ROAD THROUGH THE SWAMPS
~ By YURI NAGIBIN

The old man approached the colonel’s dugout by way of a
secret forest path. ‘Many of the trees had been hit by shells,
and were exuding resin and transparent sap through their
wounds. He watched a soldier ﬁt some cups to .a stricken birch,
saw them ﬁll rapidly with the clear sap, and silently approved
of the Red Army's thriftiness. .

The colonel’s dugout was lit by a sooty kerosene lamp.

1 There were two men inside—the colonel and his aide-de-camp.

The colonel was bent over some papers. The other was playing
a gramophone—the record was “The Blue Scarf.” He had
stuffed the sleeve of his quilted jacket into the ampliﬁer, so
that the noise should not disturb the colonel.

But he was not even aware of the music. He was reading
and re-reading the message that lay before him. It informed
him that two truckloads of ammunition had got through to
a group that had wedged its way far into the German lines.
But the road was under ﬁre. It was extremely doubtful how
long it could be kept open. .
A The men, full of ardor after their successful breakthrough,-
were marking time and losing momentum. But the command
could not supply enough sappers to lay another road. And
in any case, where could another road be laid, when all around
was impassable, sedge—grown swamp?

There was only one last hope—the villagers of Lyubino
Polye, a little marshland settlement recently liberated from
the Germans. And that was why the colonel had sent for the
old man, the chairman of the village Soviet.

The colonel had grown very fond of the sturdy, clean people
who inhabited these northern places. Taken unawares in their
village by the Germans, they had not remained in their homes
for a single day. The very ﬁrst‘ night of the occupation they
had picked off the German sentry and gone off to the woods
with their wives and children.

55

 

 

Even the cripples had crawled oif with their fellow-villagers.
The only traitor among the lot-one . mangy sheep from an
otherwise sound ﬂock-had his fate decided for him by the

 

men of Lyubino Polye, who stole into the village under the
noses of the Germans, and did away with him in their i

own way. _

The people of Lyubino Polye were capable and industrious.
They knew the swamps, knew how to ﬁght them. They knew
how to build a house in the fenlands, how to lay a road or
plan a park. They knew every mood of the swamps. ,

Furthermore, from ancient times they had been known for
their excellent woodwork. They were cabinet-makers, carpen-
ters, bridge-builders. It was said of them that they had stolen
the soul of a tree, and that was how they knew all the secrets
of wood.

It was part of the ‘village tradition that the young men
should specialize in carved cradles, things of wonder and de-
light. The wood they made those cradles from had a remark-
able melodious quality, as though there were lute-strings in
it, so that when the cradles rocked they sang of themselves
and lulled the children to sleep.

In their later years, nearer to the twilight of their lives, the
Lyubino Polye craftsmen turned to road-making and bridge-
building, and in their old_ age, by tradition, they made only
cofﬁns. These coﬂins were dependable, solid affairs, which the

people of the district ordered in advance. n
=3 # it

The old man spoke deliberately: “We’ve talked the matter A.

over, Colonel, and you needn’t worry. You don’t need your
sappers. They'll come in handy somewhere else. This road-
building job is a simple matter for us.”

“But surely you can't manage without help?” the colonel .

asked, amazed. “Will you really be able to do it on your own?”
“Well, not like sappers would do it, of course,” said the
old man with a discreet smile. “We may even do it a little
better.” -
The colonel thought. Then he sighed. He stood up and
spoke ﬁrmly. “Quite impossible, I’m afraid. The zone will be
\ 

 

 

under ﬁre, and enough of your folk have been killed already
in the guerrilla detachments.” ' 3
“My dear boy, people are like corn. You can grow a whole

H ﬁeld from a single grain. And we are ﬁghting for life.”

» “Grandpa, I can’t let you.”
“Now you leave it to us. We'll build it on the quiet.”
“But how can you hide what you're doing?”
"‘Come, come,” grinned Grandpa. “Don’t ask a craftsman
to give away his secrets.” G _
“Well,” said the colonel, sitting down again. ‘‘I’m acting
against my better judgment. How long will it take you?”
“Thirteen days.”
“Beter make it three weeks.”
“Thirteen days,” insisted Grandpa. “The number thirteen

is sacred in Lyubino Polye. We drive thirteen nails into each‘

coffin lid. And the timber has to be treated for thirteen weeks

before it can be used for ikons.”
=5 =5 #

W Next day ﬁve old men in white newly-washed homespun

‘tunics set out along the road which led to the advanced group

of Soviet forces,‘ the vanguard that had wedged deep into the
German lines. There was not a soul i_n sight. Only the wrecked

trucks by the wayside belied the stillness.

To the left of the road there was a sniper-infested copse.
To the left, also, the swamp was visible, an unhealthy bright

- green, with a bush here and there. The‘ old men moved along

a river—bank skirting the swamp. After about a mile they

branched oil‘, and four of them kneeled down and inspected

the grass. Then they reported the result of their inspection

to the ﬁfth, Grandpa Kondratenkov, the oldest and most

experienced of the party.

He was so ancient that he had forgotten his own age, nor
was there anyone in the village who could enlighten him,
for the oldest person remembered him ﬁrst as a full-grown
man with a tinge of gray in his beard.

“A likely spot,” Makar Savelyich suggested.

“Mark it out, »Makarushka,” said Grandpa. “Mitrofanych,
youihurry back to the village. Tell the men to say goodbye

to their womenfolk. Tell ’em they’re going ;to live a military
life from now on.”

Four old men moved across the bright swamp toward the
forest. In the forest they pulled their belts tighter and, hatchets
in hand, strode off through the thickets to mark off trees,
those that were straightest, and with the cleanest trunks.

“Don’t take ’em too close together, boys,” Grandpa warned.
“Or the Germans in those tree-tops will notice the gaps.”

By noon, the other old men of the village had reached the
spot, and work proceeded apace.

After marking the necessary number of trees, the old men
removed their padded jackets and lay down for a nap until
the protective darkness fell. Then, when the moon appeared
from behind the clouds, there was a dull tapping in the
swampy wood by the river, as though huge woodpeckers with
metal bills were pecking away at the trees.

Each tree was felled with three strokes: the ﬁrst was an
oblique one, and tore off a long strip of bark, as though
preparing the tree for pain and death. The second stroke
penetrated the tree to the very core. The third, dealt with «
the butt-end of the axe, severed the tree from its life-giving
roots. The tree toppled to the ground, its leaves swishing sor-
rowfully through the branches of its neighbors.

Each tree was trimmed of its lower, branches. Then the
old men lashed the logs together in rafts.

=X= # =3

A week later the colonel sent his aide to see how the work
was progressing, and to ask if the old men needed any help.
But all he could getout of them were barely perceptible sly
smiles. “Do you know what goes on top of the sub-ﬂooring?”
they asked. The aide looked blank. So they dismissed him
politely. “Well, you.’ really can't help us much, in that case.”

“What goes on top of the sub—ﬂooring!” shouted the colonel,
when informed what they had said. “Why, man, the ﬂoor,
of course! Oh, well, if theyifeel like joking, I suppose I
needn’t worry. Things must be getting along all right.”

“Perhaps they are, perhaps they aren’t,” said the aide,

58

 

 

 

‘rather stilfly. “All I can say is I've never seen anyone build

a road like that before.”
it ill it

Next day the colonel himself rode down to the site. It was
nothing like any road-building ‘job he had ever seen. The
swamp showed no mark of pickaxe or spade. Indeed, what
could axe or spade have done in that spongy morass?

He began to wonder whether he had come to the right
spot. Yes, it must be right. There, out of the forest, ap-

' peared the stately ﬁgure of Makar Savelyich, walking toward

him across the swamp. The colonel had an impulse to, give a
warning shout, but checked himself when he saw how con-
ﬁdently the old man moved over the treacherous surface.
Makar Savelyich was as lean as a wolf in early spring, and
the colonel asked him anxiously: “Are you getting anything to
eat out here?” —
“Two meals a day, and -good hot food, too. What brings
you along ahead of time, Colonel?” s
“Why, I just wanted to see if there was anything you

i wanted,” the colonel answered, afraid of offending the old

man, “and ‘to have a look around.” V

“You won’t see anything here. The road is being laid
through the forest. Look—there goes part of it now.”

Eight old men had come out of the forest, carrying a wooden
raft suspended on ropes. They looked rather like pallbearers
with a hearse. They lowered the raft to the ground, and were
followed by eight more old men with a similar contraption.

, The rafts were laid end to end. Then two of the men began

to lash them together with some kind of cloth.

“Why, Makar Savelyich, they’ll be sucked in by the swamp,”
the colonel said, distressed. “There are quagmires here you’d
never get out of alive.” _ . ,

“Aye, aye, boy, so there are. Only not where we’re laying

the road. Just turn round and take a look over there, over

the top of the grass, where it’s longest. What can you see?”
“Grass, only green grass,” the colonel replied, staring at the
gently tossing surface.

59

 

 

 

“Have. another look. Is it all green, or; can you see a bit
of yellow, as well?” I

The colonel strained his eyes until he saw, or thought he
saw, a. sort of thin, yellowish stripe treadding the lush green-
ery. ‘

“Yes, I see,” he said.

 

“Well, that yellow tells you it’s not real swamp. The tips V

of the grass are scorched by the sun. That means they get
less moisture. Now real swamp grass is never like that. In
a_real swamp the sun never scorches the grass, no matterhow
hot it is, because the roots are resting in water below the
surface. But here the roots are in ﬁrm ground, and there’s
less moisture. At ﬁrst glance it looks like real swamp grass.
But actually the soil is only damp near the surface, where the

rain wets it. Underneath, its quite hard and dry. You can '

rest supports onhit. Let’s have a look at the planks.”
They moved toward the forest. In spite of the old man’s

reassurances, the colonel stepped along very gingerly, the L

ground beneath him swaying and bobbing as he moved.

Five or six rafts were lying on the ground, and the colonel
noticed that the road they formed had began to‘ curve, fol-
lowing the direction of. the ye1low—tipped grass.

The logs were nailed together on a cross-beam, and the ﬁn-
ished rafts were laid on, thick, transverse logs which held them
clear of the ground. Makar Savelyich singled out a blade of
grass with a dark brown tip from its hiding place between
two sorry shoots of wild pea. Then he probed about in the

soil for its root, and pulled it up. The root looked like a A

long, white worm. It was dry, and forked at the end. He
held the root against one of the transverse logs. The thickness
of the log and the length of the root were the same.

“Now, do you see? With these for sleepers, the road’s as
ﬁrm as a rock.” ‘ '

“I understand,” replied the colonel respectfully.

“Aye, that’s it,” said the old man proudly. “Everything
in nature’s topsy-turvy with us.’T t -

“Take cover!” A ringing boyish voice broke the silence. I

The shout came from above, as if from a tree.

“My little grandson,” explained the old man. “He’s our
spotter.” A pulsating roar burst on them from over the for-
est, and a Henschel dived low over the trees, almost grazing
their crests. Then it soared above the swamp.

The old men had already thrown a net of green grass over
the rafts. The bomb fell about 300 yards from where they
stood. A green fountain of grass and water,»shaped like a
poplar, spurted up and fell in a shower of spray.

“Restless devil, that one,” observed Makar Savelyich.

“Comes over every day. He seems to smell the rat, but he V

doesn’t know ‘quite where it is.”

The plane dropped another bomb and vanished behind the
trees. Over the forest it released a third. A tree toppled
over, splintered by the blast. A confused noise of shouts and
curses followed. One of the old men ran out of the forest
with a birch-bark pail, and hurried down to the river.

“What’s happened, DanilychP”

The colonel and Makar Savelyich rushed into the forest.
Near the stricken tree lay Grandpa Kondratenkov, his face
dark and dour. His friends stood around him in a circle.

“Almost knocked the wind out of me,” Grandpa gasped.
“I feel quite empty inside, and as light as a feather.”

“Eat a bit of the soil, and you'll feel heavier,” Makar Sa-
velyich advised him.

They turned Grandpa over on his stomach. He pressed his
mouth to the dark moist ground, churned‘ up by the explo-
sion.

“No good, boys,” he groaned. “Makarushka, I didn't fasten
the rope at the ﬁfth lap. See you don't forget it. Keep a bit
more to the right of the stream, when you get deeper into the
forest. The ground’s ﬁrmer. _

“Don’t you worry about that, Grandpa,” soothed Makar

Savelyich.
“I know, I know, Makarushka,” sighed the ancient. “But
folk are so young, so spoiled. . . ." His voice was barely a

whisper. Then he suddenly sat up. “I -can't die with every-
thing in such a mess". Give me some water.”; -

They gave him some cold water from, the stream. After
swallowing some of it with diﬁiculty, noisily, he got up. He

 

swayed. Then, leaning forward slightly, he steadied himself .
on his wide-spread bandy legs, planted so ﬁrmly on the

ground that he looked as if he had taken root in it.
“Hand over that brace, Danilych,” he said, breathing heav-
ily. i

T On the thirteenth day, when the sun was well up in the

sky, the chairman of the village Soviet appeared at the col-

,onel’s dugout and reported, military fashion, that the job

was done. That evening there was a meeting, at which the
colonel expressed the gratitude of the- Red Army units which,
thanks to the labors of Lyubino Polye, were able to launch
an offensive against the enemy.’ 

Next morning the ﬁrst column of loaded trucks drove over
the new road. The planks sighed heavily and sank to the
level of the ground, squeezing moisture between the edges,
and then settled down ﬁrmly, for all time. v

NOTE

These are examples of the big and little things that went
on for forty-seven months in the rear of the Wehrmacht and

‘in the rear of the Red Army. These big and litle things done
by the people of the Soviet Union made it possible for the.

Soviet Army, Navy and‘ Air Force to do the seemingly im-
possible. From Generalissimo -Stalin who inspired, directed
and sustained the titanic effort, down to the last ..woodsman
and partisan—the Soviet people dearly bought Russia's share
in our partnership of triumph. This brief and inadequate
account is written lest that share and its price be forgotten

it and the ‘Russian achievement obscured by the dazzling explo-

sions of atomic bombs which, let us remember, occurred when
the war had already been won and which, furthermore, will
never be able to take the place of the eﬁort of valiant peoples
in their righteous struggle for freedom. v

WIIAT RUSSIA um F01:
vwronv  

By SERGE] /KOURNAKOFF

NORMAN CORWIN is absolutely right. Right and dis-
couraging. Discouraging to the one who, like myself,

\ has set himself the task to be the “learned cog" which will

attempt to compute, albeit in the most general way, the
military effort of the Soviet people and their armed forces.
The military effort of a people, especially a people who has
felt theboot of the enemy on their soil, whose cities and
villages have been transformed into little more than charred
spots on the landscape and cherished memories on maps,
whose sons and daughters have been killed and tortured,

V limbs cut off, minds set wandering—cannot be measured only

in dollars, tons, miles and days.

The mourning of the wife or mother in Ohio, tear for .tear, V
is the equivalent of the mourning of the wife or mother in _

Smolensk. But somehow mourning is more bearable when
the boy’s room in the family nest is intact, when other mem-
bers of the family are alive and well. Mourning the dead on
a charred beam lying in melting snow in a place that was a
village—is somehow less bearable. And then there is another
thing, a thing which means little to the individual mourner,

_ centered in his own grief, but which is important in the life

of a nation or country: the number of mourning mothers and
wives. While “-holes punched in cards” cannot measure the
grief of the individual, they can and must record the numbers.
Nothing expressed in tons, miles, days and dollars can give
the whole picture of acountry’s war effort, for sobs, spasms,
pangs will be left uncounted, but the relative eﬁort of eac

country which took part in the anti-Hitler coalition can be

expressed only in dry ﬁgures.

Expressing this relative, comparative effort is important.

if Not for the sake of glory and self-satisfaction, but for the sake

of the soundness of the structure of peace which is being built
now. The “engineers” who are doing the building must know
the relative strength of the stones theyare using for the arch
of security, lest they use limestone for a key and shove the
granite into a remote corner where it will be wasted.

The test by steel and_ ﬁre, the trial by war provides the
“engineers” with convincing data on the strength of the

‘material at hand," for the stubborn facts of the battleﬁeld
cannot be faked. The dice of total war cannot be loaded.‘
The truth comes out in the wash for all to see. However, in‘

almost every country on ﬁve-sixths of the earth there are
people who do not wish to see any social changes take place
because they have a stake in the social status quo, people who
by the same token do not wish a new society to succeed and
who, therefore, try to obscure the vision of the people by
belittling the astounding achievements of a truly planned

/society in this war. There are also those who have been

beaten and who do not wish to acknowledge that they have
been beaten to a great extent by a social system they hated
most and swore to wipe off the face of the earth. Finally,

a there are those who simply want to ﬂatter their national

ego by strutting around, beating their chests and clamoring:
“WE did it all.”

The ﬁrst category are the reactionaries, fascists, semi—fascists

and para-fascists everywhere; the second are the Nazis; the
third are not quite as dangerous (because they are primitive
and naive)—the nationalists and bhauvinists, the “we ﬁrsters”
of many colors and ﬂags. All these groups have one common
political denominator—anti-Sovietism, mixed in some cases
(as,in the case of some ‘British Tories), with long standing
russophobia.

, The anti-Soviet propaganda of these people has become
crystallized in half a dozen basic slogans (which are being
used with certain variations).

Here are these catch phrases:

The Imperial Russian Army in the First World War did
better than the Red Army in the Second World War. The
Tsar"s soldiers retreated only to the marshes of the Polessye

while the Red soldiers were pressed back to the Volga and .
the Terek. Ergo—the Imperial Army was better and the

Tsarist system was better.

The Red Army won. because it had space and climate on
its side. «
I Q I

The Red Army won because the Allied Air Forces bombed
Germany into submission.

# II III

TheiRed Army won because it got its weapons through
lend-lease.

III '1! =3

The Red Army won because of the traditional “fatalistic”'

heroism of the Russian people who fought in spite of the

Soviet regime, the communist leadership, etc.
3)? BIB I!

The Red Army in fact did not win at all because it was
the battle of Britain whichlsaved the world. (Another variant
is—El Elamein was the real turning point of the war; or,
St. Lo was Germany’s ’Waterloo.)

=K= ii 5!!

Every thinking person understands the hollowness of these
catch phrases, as well as their purpose (the purpose becomes

. clear when one notes that every Nazi general and bigwig

who hastily ﬂed westward in the corridor between the Oder
and the Elbe, in April 1945, uses them), but the thinking

' non-military person must have the facts marshalled in order

to puncture the hollow catch phrases with the pin of logic. .
