Dear Sirs and’ Brothers: _ . .

 This is an informal report». to the
 membership from’ the International of-
ficers‘ in meeting. Februa_ry.18, 19 and

 20',‘ 1954. , '

 First, we report with the greatest

_ pride in. our membership that our un-

il ‘fion-A has defeated the most widespread,

 

coordinated attempt ever made to-

_ ' weaken ‘our union. We can ‘say, with
 passurance . that the major raids
 . :launched— since the first of this iyear
nfhave failed. This will be. given finality
.  _when the NLRB election is held in Butte
I *”_.and Anaconda on March. 22. We shall’

 

 (enter bargaining ;with our union in-..

, “tact, and stronger than before.
We are stronger for having elimi-

nated weak spots in our leadership--ﬂ

A those; who could not stand up against
 employer propaganda, brib e s, or
 .»threat,* and ‘those who placed . their
, ‘« own selfish inte1'est,above those of the

Z . membership. I

Our sources, of strength ~
Let usconsider for a moment, the
sources of our union’s strength as; we
move,into,one of the.mo_st_ difficult
periods that working people havexever

faced in the U.’ S. and Canada. ' l
' We have a democratic union. Next‘

/

ferences, we will develop our 1954
bargaining demands and overalljunion
policy through a‘ procedure that gives’
every local union 9. voice andxvoten
Every member is encouraged to ex-
press ‘-his» views at union meetings and
through letters for publication in THE
UNION.  A V p -
Our union is stronger this‘year be-'
cause of a more representative’ Inter-«
national Executive Board. Among the
International offic’ers‘we have our new
Eastern Vice -President," Brother As-
bury Howard, an outstanding leader of
labor and of" the Negro people. Next
month, our International. -leadership
will be further strengthened by the
f additionlof a Canadian 1_Vic'e rPreside'nt,
» to.be selected at the Canadian Mine- 
»Mill Convention. Our 'Mexican-Ameri-
can membership :‘.nQW ~has representa-
. tion in the top leadership of the union
‘~ in the person of Brother J. B. Chavez,
Board Member for District 2. In, Dis- 
trict 1’ we now have as Board Member
(, Brother.Erne_st Salvas, who drepreseints
. the. rank-and-file militancy and en-
thusiasm of the Montana workers.

.. Program for JOBS
  _0ur union has _a program to . solve.
the ‘crisis in- the metals industry,
through public works, freer-world trade
and subsidies. , .  . _
We say the way to make jobs for un- -.
‘employed miners,‘ smeltermen and oth-' ~

r -er. workers is-,. to face the facts of 1”

growling depression and take measures.
to create ‘jobs andbuying power. .. .
Big ‘business , men _ with comfortable
incomes may see 7no cause for worry .
when millions are jobless. They -may '‘
shout “communist” and “purveyor of
gloom and doom” at those who are
concerned about want in the midst
Of plenty. They may try to forestall
action in the crisis by smearing the
great Fijgnklin D. Roosevelt and even.

We have also a proposal to increase —

Butte Miners No. 1. and Anaconda ‘Mill

V and Snr"1elterrnen’s Union No. 117. And

it- wasn’t easy.

\When\ District Judge John B. Mc-
Clernan upheld’—Mine-Mill’s historic oc-
cupation of Miners Union Hall after a
Sunday march of 800 miners, he let it
be known in his opinionfrom the bench
that he‘ Wanted somekind of election

heldfor Butte miners.

Mine-Mill, meanwhile, hadfilet‘. a pe-
tition for an NLRB election in‘ Butte.
Asa stalling tactic, the. Steel raiders
refused" to consent to such an election,

demanding instead that an election be
held for both the Butte miners and

-Anaconda smeltermen as a single bar-

gaining unit. ‘

ACCORDING to past NLRB rules,,.

an election could notsbe ;held in Ana-
conda prior to next August 24 because

a'"certification election had. been held
, for Local117 onithat date‘ last 'year:.» ,

Mine-Mill‘ countered with a consent
for the double-barrelled electicin, pro-
vided that if the NLRB -ruled it wa"s-il-
legal, the boardwould proceed with an
immediate election in Butte. -The raid-

stalling and refusing’ to consent.

 Judge ordered election

The raidershad no sooner issued

.this":.~falsehood than Judge McClernan"

appointed 9." “Butte Labor <Re1ations
-Board” -and ordered it‘ to me'et[ on
-~March "1 to hold an» immedia"te"’el'ectiont
in Butte.‘ Theraiders became, hysteri-
T cal.‘ -They‘ even » accused the judge or 

~’.being a ‘fCommunis:t ag_en'"t.’’ ‘

Thé;cfourt’s.,order‘ for -an election led. 
Lito quick’ action by the NLRB. The 
«_ raiders. complained loudly that the‘,

court‘ order. was a shotgun at their

.. head. -Another" NLRB conference was
Q called,j"thi.s time‘ with a Board attorney.. --

Steel refused a quick election. "They ’
insisted that the only" election they

would agree to was the single unit
version -at both Butte and Anaconda.‘
Mine-Mill agreed,"in order to get ac-
tion. "Then came the question 0'.‘ dates.

MINE-MILL askedfor March 1 and

 ‘Steel’ ,"1-efu'sed. ‘ The raiders- rejected

every single date until March. 22—ob-‘
serving they had to have time to clear
up"""the . “con'fusion’_’ caused by Judge
McClernan. Mine-Mill agreed to March
22 when it was apparent that an ‘earli-

er date would be impossible to achieve,

because of‘ Steel’s stalling.

When the proposed March 22 election‘
‘was"’brought to the Butte miners they '

insisted, in an unanimous vote by 600
members, that the court election pro-

ceed. Mine-Mill officers were ,author-.

ized. to notify the court _of the miners’-
opinion. ’ ' ‘

'_So that's theway matters‘ stood ‘early
last week. Denied a referendum vote
.by_th_e Mason ‘crowd when the “seces-
sion” motion was voted upon, the min-
ers now face‘. the possibility of voting

in two .elections—one held by the dis-

trict court, the other by the NLRB.

"Worst mud-slin-"gingh

While the Mason gang has proved
it has few equals in the art of red
baiting and hysterical propaganda, the
stepped-up campaign has brought on
the worst mud-slinging that Mine-Mill
members have seen.anywhere, anytime.
The ‘raiders are desperate men and

miners and smeltermen are expecting.‘

A few days ago I had the ' great privilege of seeing the

Little Recital Hall, at aspecial preview for some 300,represen—
tatives of more than 20 New York City unions. ,
Througho‘yIt the showing, there was repeated spontaneous‘
applause. At the end there was acclaim for the picture itself,
for the producers and particularly. for each memberof the cast.
Close-‘ups of each actor and actress were shown on th$ screen,
and the applause was stupendous. V ; . ‘_ H 
‘Then there was a‘ buzzing of ‘conversation, as everyon.e I
said, in effect, “-We have got to support the showing of this ‘
picture so it will be seen all over thecountry.” ,
It is expected that_“Salt of the Earth? will be premiered
in two /or three weeks at three .large New York- theaters. It _
will then be ready for showing elsewhere as schedules can be

But when he testified before the Tariff Com-

what the answer was. He merely pleaded with
Government officials to “do something.”

David McDonald, President o-f the Steel-

President’s Commission on -Foreign Economic
Policy, -says: “. . . I "firmly believe that the
United States should reduce its tariff barriers.”

is better thanfthe tariff plan in three im-
portant ways:  ,- -

H. We know’ the Murray bill will work. Itis
based on principles that have worked
effectively in the past, not only in our in-
industry but in otherfields as well. ‘It is
an up-to-date peacetime version of ‘ the
Premium» Price Plan which from 1942 to
1947 successfully kept U.S. mines operat-
ing -at" peak capacity -—‘- and ‘at -minimum

L cost to the public. - i

2. The Murray bill makes sense. It would
 apply the medicine where it’s needed, and
only in the amountrneeded. Tariff backers

V . want to‘ help the needy -.by pgivingpeveryli ‘
companyin“ the industryfan extra bonus. U

Thelneedyfwould not get as much as they

need; theil-jjvell-to—do would get what they

don’t neved. _;

 The Murray bill is economical.‘ It gets a lot
done,-at asmallcost. The cost of ‘benefits

« .to needy lead and zinc producers, for ex-
ample, would comejito less than one—tenth

as much as the «tariff -would cost c‘on- .. .

sumers.

Two changes suggested    

Mine-Mil-1 has proposed two amendments to
the Murray billéas it is now- written.

» First, payment of subsidies is ‘now limited

by the bill entirely to the needs of the national.

security stockpile. The Munitions ‘Board could;

stop payments by deciding arg_i-ve'n metal is no
longer needed for they isftockpile. «A better
approach, we believe, would be to create a sep-

. arate stockpile for the express purpose of

promoting conservation of resources and sta-
bilizing metal pric_es. P s P i- .v . V

This first amendment would separate the
issue of meta} market stability from the shift-

ing winds of the cold war. We have in mind".  ‘

the kind of conserVati,on stockpile proposed-in
Senator Johnson’s ‘metal corporation “parity

, i. plan.” _bil1._ . V .

Second, we oppose the _sectio'n,whi'eh would 
imine. ope1'- .
ator paid wages liigjlier than those ‘prevaili11_’g
_in his district. Senator Murray probably put’

step i subsidy payments wherever ya

this in to block, a11y"piI'ati11g" of labor in a

period of manpower shortage. However, there _'
is"""no likelihood of a manpower shortage in the.
. non-ferrous metals industry either now or in.
the near future; _.-J \” ' A ‘ V

Moreover, this section could‘ make it impos-

sible to negotiate a‘ wage increase with any
singleoperator in a district unless a1l*operato,_rs

agreed to the increase. .We think that -is both? ’

S Subsidies Ere. castes
old as the USA  

We've had subsidies ever since the
. first U. S. Congress. ..Here are some of
. the. best known :' '

TO R A IL’RO  D S. When railroads

were being built across the country, Con-
gress voted the RR companies huge land
grants, usually every other quarter sec-
tion along the right of way. ’

TO. LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. Con-

- gress Voted large tracts to Land-Grant
Colleges tohelp them get started, and.has_
since voted big sums to help‘ maintain
them. ' '

To HOMESTEADERS. In 11862, Con-

gress voted 320 acres of land free to any-'
one who would live on it and maintain’ it
in newly-opened western territories.
Later, this was raised to 640 acres.

TO. NEWSPAPERS. For many years,

. newspapers have been able to mail copies_, a ,
of. their publications, under second-class] .
- mailing privileges at less than it costs the
‘ ~ . government to handle them. + ‘

TO FARMERS: Parity and soil con-

. servation payments, mortgage debt ad-'
justments, are among the many agricul-
tural subsidies. ‘ '

T0 BANKS. Bankshave a variety of
government-sponsored privileges includ-
ing most of _the benefits of government ’
credit business thaﬂ no institution other
than banks can carry, 2 per cent issues of .
bonds ‘to recompense them for services,
etc. ' 1

TO CORPORATIONS. Corporations

have always been given many tax.immuni-
V ties, including the 5-year amortization set-
up. under which the government” in effect l
absorbed much of the costof the post-war
plant and mine expansion program. :

T0 INVESTORS. ‘Holders of state and

local bonds donlt pay taxes on interest re-
ceived from the'se bonds.

. T0 MANUFACTURERS. The protec-- 
vtive tariff, levied by the first U. S. Con-
gress, has since enabled industry to
charge consumersibillions of dollars. The
tariff is a hidden subsidy that government
allows industry to collect from consumers. L

’ ( Continued from last page)
would then‘ come off for the ‘next three
months. - t ‘

That’s the tlieqry. All the large companies
with foreign holdings would need to do is to
hold their metals out of the ..U. S. long
enough to bring prices up. As soon as prices’
reached the'151/2-cent point; the tariff would
come off. Foreign metails could be poured
into the country for the next three months.
This would again depress prices.
would be ‘put back‘ in force-——and the whole
cycle would repeat itself. Prices would move
up and down like a boy ’on'a Pogo stick.

. No onecould pre-dictprices for more than

, a fewrweeks ahead at most. Users of lead and

zinc. would have no sure way of estimating
their raw material costs. Markets would not
be stable,‘but unstable. C r
The -upsetting effect‘ of the Simpson bill
would tend to force more substitution of

other metals and plastics for lead and zinc.

Companies noweusing lead and zinc to make
their products‘ ‘ would find it ' easier and
cheaper to shift to ‘other metals, and plastic/s
with more stable prices. _ r
, A more basic fault with thejtariff plan is
that_.it would -aggravate.the very problem it
seeks to solve. .

The world‘ nov_v"‘produces more non-ferrous ~

metals than can be sold. The main job___ is to
expand markets-. Tariffs don’t éipand’ mar-
kets. They try only to get at larger share of
a declining. market for home producers. They

end up by shrinking the homejmarket still
— .__further. '

Trade is a two-way street. When other

. 4 countries can’t sell to the U.S., they have less

money with which to buy from the U.S.
“So what ?” some say. “We don’t sell non-
ferrousfmetals ouside the U.S. anyway.” 
That’s partly true. W e haven’t sold much

copper, lead or zinc as such. But we have A
sold ‘a lot of things that use a great deal of ,.
copper, lead and zinc. _Oursales itooforeign ‘
. markets include autos, machinery of all kinds,
_ electrical equipment, chemicals, paint, etc.

When ‘other countries can’t earn enough
money to buy these metal—using things from

us, that further depresses’ metal markets.

There’s another ‘side to the same coin.
Tariffs by one country always provoke retali-
ation. In 1930, another Republican Admini-

stration decided’ that U.S. industries needed =
.more tariff protection. It passed the Smoot-

Hawley Tariff Act, one of the highest tariffs

C - in U.S. -history. Other countries hit‘ back.

They set up high tariff barriers, too.‘ -The.»’re-

‘ sult was a major. trade ‘war. International
r trade was cut down to a mere shadow of what

it could have been. , s ‘ V V 
The stagnation of world trade in the 30’s

aggravated andprolonged the world-wide de-

pression. ,Nearly everyone today agrees to

that. World trade wasn’t L revived until’ tl1é"‘_
' Roosevelt Administration enacted the Re-‘

Those who heard defense attorney John T. M cTern"an’s final

‘finest pieces of courtroom oratory ever cleliizered. It is impossible

ver? He said he did this only for “ex-
penses.” Then he said _he' was paid a
flat sum, and if anything was left over

after expenses, he kept it. We got _the _

real factsby subpoening the govern-
ment records. Ford was paid for ex-
penses $466.73. And for services against
the friends he loved and admired he_
was paid.$7,025. /

‘T,,hat’s patriotism that pays, gentle-

men, especially when you’re in debt. I
ask you to consider, didn’t Ford have a

' financial interest and_ therefore, isn’t 

his word suspect? .

“ Or take the witness George Knott.

He said he made a trip to Silver City '

in 1946 or early 1947. During that en-

tire period, according to Mr. Knott’s

own signed expense vouchers, he was a
minimum of 1,500fmiles away from Sil-
ver City. Brain washing? Who washed

that story of a meeting in Silver City
into Mr. Knott’s brain? 3

1 V Changed T his story

I
I don’t want to spend too much time
on the witness Peterson, but let’s not
be‘ misled. Petersion said he was sure
about that meeting in Salt Lake City.

. He was sharp, the way, he fixed things

in his mind. He was awfully sure about
that meeting in May or June iof 1947
because of the campaign against; Taft-

Hartley.

Butwhen his cross-examination had
been deferred to giveus time to get
some facts, the witness
changed his story.

Peterson was in charge of {arrange-
ments for‘ that meeting in 1947, and the
minutes of the meeting show that
Jencks wasn?t there. So. Peterson says
the meeting took place in late ’47 or
early ’48.' And then on*cros.s“—examina-

‘ tion the same. thing happens. The meet-

ing about which he says he is talking

W ' actually “took place in February :of
' 1948. And they show that J encks wasn’t

there, either. What's more, Pet_erson’s
own expense vouchers show that he

wasn’t there, either. He ‘says_ he sat ‘

around in his underwear inhis hotel

room and his recollections changed.’

Did he just “make a mistake?”
Let’s turn to the ‘witness Brooks.

‘ DENVER-——An appeal to all Mine-
Mill locals to join the campaign for
Clint Jencks’ freedom as “a major fight

in defense of our Union,” was made"

by the International Officers during
their recent meeting here. 4 _

A -letter to all local unionsfrom
President" Clark, Vice Presaident's\,Lar-

. son and Howard and Secreta1'yT-Treas-

urer Travis, commented: vif‘Ev'erything

that happened in the.trial proved what

Habitual not

Then we have the witness Matusow-
I call him the “Pro.” This is the super-
patriot who assisted McCarthy in 1952.

All in all, he took in [$10,000 in that.

venture in 1952, all from professional

' anti-communism, a pretty good game.

I think we have demonstrated to you
that Matusow is an habitual liar, a man
bereft of moral sense. He calmly sat

there and told you that he deliberately‘

misled his friends into joining‘ the
Communist Party and then deliberately

. turned their names. over to the FBI——

for money. _

Remember the stories about his resi-
dence? Remember his registering to
vote in three different places in a little
over a year? How does he get out of
that? He says the. record is wrong. The
officials are wrong. I am right, he
says.‘ . .

But this is not all—lying in Manhat-

V tan, giving contradictory oaths in Day-

ton. He gets into a‘ divorce squabble
and runs out to Santa Fe and says:

,“I’ve been living here for more" than a

year.” Apparently legal residence‘ is
whatever the needs of the moment call

‘for,'in the eyes of Mr. Matusow.

Why didn’t he give accurate _street
addresses? When I asked him that, the
Pro turned to his smear tactics. He said
the Communist Party w.ouldn’t guar-
antee him protection. So then I took
him through a pile of records showing
he’ gave hisstreet address five times
under oath-——during the year when he
said he had a policy not to give his

. street address. N

This is the kind of oath they want
you to accept. People who would ymis-
lead their friends "to turn them over to

Ithe FBI, people caught in their own’

records. Are Ford, ‘Currie, Matusow

table to stand in the shadow of the man ~

who after risking _his life in the Pacific

came back and gave seven years to _

fighting for the miners of New Mex-
ico? .

Nothing proved

My second main -point is that the

prosecution has not proven thatthe af- .

fidavit was -false, not even if you take

all these witnesses at face value. Re-
member the old adage, keep your eye"

on the ball. April 28, 1950, that’s the

_ .ba-lI——-that’s the issue.

Most.of the evidence, .almost all of
it, relates to what happened before
'1950. None of this ,'evidenc_e __ can prove

‘membership in the Communist Party

/‘.

ness of the case against you by the

Isn’t it strange that if the charge
here is true and if the resources of-the ‘ . _ J.

more than $7,000 to a single person for

way of putting the many thousands of unemploye_d"back to work. ._,

’The‘14-page brief, dealing with many problems of theprovincel and the union,‘ _ ’

was presented by District President. Ken Smith, leader of a delegation consisting

ment gavean expression of opinion on, one point only.  ‘ ‘

IN REPLY to the union’s charge that Kitimat, new site of, the Aluminum A
Company of Canada plant, ‘was being’ made a closed company-town, withjofficers ’ P
andorganizers being refused transp'ortation_ there by the steamship companies, the - 
'Attorney—General statedrthat no law permitted them to -do this, and that the union

should press, through the courts for establishment of the right to travel there.

The company imported an unknown AFL; union from the States, signed an

‘agreement with them and then got them certified, while denying Mine-Mill access.

The AFL gang get transportation at any time, but the steamship companies,.on
the demand of —Alco, refuse tickets on the groundthat there is-no accommodation

is now pressing suit, and the case is expected to come up
shortly. " - i " ' e ’ ' ‘

Neither, states the brief, is the situation the ‘result of “high wages pricing

arguing. No minevin the world produceslead and Jzinc as cheaply as does the
Sullivan; yet the CM&S, in spite. of the highest profits in history, has laid off
many hundreds with others on short time. / . - B

THE DELEGATION asked the government to pass a special resolution at this

session of the Legislature, calling on the Federal government to ‘open trade with

‘Reduction in the hours of work by legislation, and}; the initiation of public,
works programs were other expedients suggested by the delegation to deal with
unemployment. A custom smelter at the coastwas demanded again (an old objec-
