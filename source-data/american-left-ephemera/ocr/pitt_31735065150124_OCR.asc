Lead-Zinc Job Figures

DENVER—President John Clark charged here April
19 that fewer lead-zinc mining industry workers are pro-
ducing more per man-hour than official U. S. Labor
Department estimates indicate.

In a letter to Secretary of Labor James P. Mitchell,

Officers Urge
Local Actions

* On Forand Bill

-DENVER —- Immediate ac-

tionby all_ locals insupport

of the Forand bill, providing
medical insurance for the aged
under social security, was
urged last month by Mine-
Mill's top officers. _

A letter signed by President
Clark, Vice-Presidents How-
ard and Skinner and Secre-
tary-Treasurer Dichter was
sent to the locals on April 8
suggesting intensified pressure
on Congress.

Failure of the House Ways
and Means committee to free
the Forand bill for floor de-

lbates, the letter pointed out,

“has caused a tremendous
groundswell of protest from
all sections of the country and
from every section of the labor
movement.
* >l< >l<

“THE REACTION is such
that there is every possibility
that the ‘Forand bill or some
form of medical insurance for
the aged will have to be con-

7 sidered during this session of

Congress.”

sEmpha.sizi.ng the importance
of letting ‘Washington know
Where the rank and file stands
on this issue, the union leaders
suggested that all locals 

' 'mediately wire their congress-

men and senators urging pas.
sage of the F01-and bill in this
session, begin a postcard and
letter campaign in support of
the bill and, wherever possible,
to organize community-wide

V meetings inviting congression-

al candidates to state their
views on the Forand bill.

the Mine-Mill leader called

' for a revision of the de-

partment’s employment fig-
ures the use of which, he said,
tended to understate recent
increases in productivity of
lead-zinc miners.

He cited latest surveys by
the U. S. Tariff Commission
and the Census Bureau which
reveal greater loss of jobs and
higher productivity among the
industry’s workers than the
Bureau of Labor Statistics in-
dex shows.

Local Political Action
Shfts into High Gear

DENVER—Mine-Mill locals around the country began shifting their legislative

 

and political action gears into high last month as Con

adjournment with an eye on the November elections.

A blueprint for stepped-up membership activity was
gram projected by the International Executive board,

Battle for Aged Medical Care

Hinges on Social Security Use

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

WASHINGTON, D. C.—
After spending some 10 weeks
riding civil rights into the
ground, the 86th Congress en-
ters its home stretch with
medical care for the aged and
other welfare issues holding
the center of the legislative
stage. A

Final action on the Civil
Rights Act of 1960 came April
21 in the House. The end prod-
uct of the lengthy debate was
anything but the “m.eaIl.il1g'
ful” bill promised the country
by liberal lawmakers.

Its main feature is the au-
thority for Federal judges to
appoint voting referees to con-
sider the applications of Ne-
groes who claim they have
been denied the right to regis-
ter and vote by State election
officials.

plan, along with the worth
of the bill as a whole, drew

these comments from leading
Senators:

Paul Douglas of Illinois-
“The bill . . . sets up an elabo-

rate obstacle course which the
disenfranchised Negro in the
South must successfully run
before he will be permitted to
vote at all . . .”

Pat McNamara of Michigan
-—“We have a watered-down
bill that has been so further
diluted that it will wash right
out of this chamber and hard-
ly be noticed in the main.-
stream of American life . . .”

Joseph Clark of Pennsyl-
vania;“Those of us who sup-
ported a meaningful civil
rights bill have suffered a
crushing defeat.”

WASHINGTON, D. C.——
Developments in the on-
again-off-again Subversive
Activities Control Board
hearings involving Mine-
Mill took ‘ a sensational turn
hereilast month which ripped

a gaping hole in the govern-

ment’s 5-year-old case against
the union.

Six witnesses, whose stool-
pigeon testimony made the
newspaper headlines in every
Mine-Mill area when they orig-
_inally recited their accusations,
were dropped by the govern-
; .

ment. No newspaper clarioned
this startling move.

The development came on
April 18 when the proceedings
were once again resumed .be-
fore SACB hearing officer
Francis A. Cherry after having
lain dormant for more than a
year. Nothing quite like it has
ever occurred in a legal case
before.

PENDING before Cherry
when the hearings resumed
last monthwere motions ar-
gued some 14 months ago by
Mine-Mill general counsel Na-

than Witt under the so-called
“Jencks law” for the produc-
tion by the government of
statements the witnesses had
made to the FBI before they
took the stand in this case.
Attorney L. E. Broome, rep-
resenting the government,
arose to state that six of the
prosecution witnesses had told
him they -would refuse to ap-
pear for further .cross-examina-
tion by Witt on the basis of
the statements. Because of
that, Broome said, he was mov-
ing that all their testimony

against Mine-Mill be stricken
from the record.
Objections were immediately

registered by Witt who argued.

that the entire case should be
dismissed. But hearing officer
Cherry granted Broome’s Ino-
tion as to five of the six wit-
nesses, and reserved his rul-
ing as to the sixth.

IN NEW MEXICO, the mem-
berships of Carlsbad Local 415
and Bayard Local 890, as Well
as members of the El Paso
locals who live in that state,
began the work of mobilizing
voter support for the candi-
dates they had already en-
dorsed on the basis of record
and program.

The renomination of Con-
gressman Joe Montoya in this
montl1’s Democratic primary
was pointed up as the key goal
in New Mexico’s political
battle. Montoya 'is endorsed

both by Mine-Mill and the-

state’s AFL-CIO COPE. Con-
gressman Tom Morris and
Senator Clinton P. ’Anderson

are also being backed for re-

election.

Endorsed for state posts arezl

Joe Bursey for Governor, Bet-

mission, and Robert Mayse for

Mine-Mill local leaders from

as the Mine-Mill Union went
to press. Full reports will be
published in the next issue.

Delegates to the American
Brass Council were scheduled

Pensioner Sends

Donafion, Wishes

Among the hundreds of in-
dividual contributions and sup-
port messages received in Den-
ver for the Mine-Mill defense
and strike funds, here is one
of the most notable addressed
to President Clark on April '7
from an 89-year-old pensioner
in Elsinore, Calif:

,“I am happy to'lear—n that
the union has ‘concluded the
great strike with good con-
tracts. I approve your inten-
tion to follow up by interesting
the entire labor movement in
your union's efforts. Success,
I hope, for you in this.

“I am enclosing three dol-
lars as an evidence of my ap-
proval. It is just a token con-
tribution, I realize, but my
good wishes go with it. Much
sickness, at age 89 years, and
old age pension limitations
have held me at a rather low
ebb.

“My memory goes back to
the miners, milllmven and
smeltermen of the ‘I. W. W.
in struggles from 1906 to
1917, inclusive. I think of
Frank Little, of the thrusting
forth at Bisbee, of the :inva-
sion of federal troops in the
Miami-Globe section. I recall
county jails '-and Leavenworth
and my refusal to accept
President .Harding’s stinking
‘Amnesty P-ardon’.

“Well, God bless the miners
and all the rest.

Fraternally,
“Harry F. Kane”

initiation into the union of
some. 80. new members of the
local and 100 new members in
the auxiliary, the first union

auxiliary in Superior’s his-
tory.
“This is one of the real

bright spots in the Interna-
tiona ,” Clark said, in congrat-
ulating both groups of" new of-

ficers, “particularly as to the

local coming out of a victory
in a decertification election
and - settling their strike with
a contract that is completely
satisfactory not only to the
membership but to the Whole’

again,” Clark said, “is a lo--

cal on the move, active on con-
solidation and with hard-work-
ing committees set up both on
the political front and the or-
ganizational problems facing
it.”

In a discussion of finances
later in the meeting, Clark em-
phasized the need. for build-
ing a sound financial basis of
operation both in the locals
and International Union after
the long and expensive strike.

Saturday Evening Post
Features Taylor Article  

An article by Telford Taylor was featured last month
in the April 16 issue of one of America’s most popular
weekly magazines, The Saturday Evening Post.

Most Mine-Mill members know of Taylor only as
defense counsel in the Taft-Hartley conspiracy case of

nine past and present Mine-
Mill leaders, and that he is
heading the fight for reversal
in. the higher courts.

OF INTEREST, then, are
these additional facts about
Taylor’s background noted by
the Post’s editors in a caption
about the author which accom-

panied a full-page ‘blow-up of

his portrait:

“Telford Taylor will be re-
membered as deputy to Jus-
tice Robert H. Jackson, and
later as brigadier general. and
chief counsel at the Nurem-
berg war-crimes trials. Mr.
Taylor has spent ten years in
Government service in various
legal and executive capacities,
was an Army general staff of-
ficer during World War II and
at present is engaged in pri-
vate law practice. A Williams
graduate‘ (Class of '29), he is
Visiting Lecturer at the Colum-
bin.» and Yale law schools, and
has. written two books dealing
with recent. German military
history and a third one; Grand

Inquest, about congressional

investigations, as well as nu-
merous articles on political,
legal and military subjects.”

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Presiclenl-'s Corner:

Political Action
Vital for Labor

OLITICAL action for labor through-
Potit the country is the most vital issue
facing all of us.

The passage of the Taft-Hartley Act
was the signal for a continued all-around
attack on organized labor
by the employer group and
their Washington and State
Charlie McCarthys to fur-
ther hamstring and if pos-
sible to d e s t r o y labor’s
strength in the economic
and social life of this nation.
They took advantage of the
division and the turmoil in
labor’s leadership which fin-
ally culminated in the pass-
age last year of the Ken- 
nedy-Landrum-Griffin AOL, Clark
or using a short term, the “Labor Control Act.”

Rank and file labor should only have to

look back at the cross purpose program of
lobbying by its own leadership during the de-
ibate of this bill both in the House and Senate,

and the complete ignoring of the intent and the
ultimate results of the act to place the responsi-
bility Where it belongs—-on the shoulders of the
top leadership of the claimed merged labor
movement of this country.

*A'**

T IS CLEARLY seen now that the destruc-

tive forces against labor feel that they have
these vacillating leaders on the run and are in
the process of further contemplating larger
doses of knock-out drops. Proposals of perma-
nent committees to keep a watch over labor
calls for a Federal right-to-Work act. Putting
labor under anti-trust laws are some of the

‘snares also being thought of.

‘The continuance of the McClelland Com-
mittee to focus the limelight on labor in its in-
quisitorial method is part of the fertilizer to
be spread to build up fertile ground for public
consumption and create support for the law-
makers to continue their depredations against

 organized labor. This is why political action is
 the vital issue confronting labor_ this year.

How far can top leadership in labor be

 trusted to programize joint action among its
- ,members is extremely doubtful, and this doubt
_ is well founded. Already the rumored support
V. of this candidate or that candidate, most of
-‘I them conflicting, is permeating the labor 0-
; Zone.

* * ‘hk
NLY IN ONE or two scattered places has
there been any attempt to‘ join together or

solidify labor’s political stand, and this is in‘

the rank and file of labor and the lower

_ echelon leadership who show more perception

of the trend against labor than does top leader-
ship.

1 Labor in many sections is the key to both
Senate and House aspirants. Division of this by
any action could result in losing friends in
either branch.

Our Union, pa.rticularly in the Rocky Moun-
tain states, is a factor. Any action that will
negate that factor is a traitorous act to the
labor movement in general. We take the stand
that whatever our differences, nothing should
stand in the way of joint action in the political
field. This is an obligation of all of us.

' ' Another factor to be considered, and it is

Z "not very favorable or heartening, : is the in-

decision and the family differences that seem

- . to be cropping out in the political party that

labor generally feels isthe one that would sup-
port labor. ' ‘ V, = t r
a ‘k * *~- ~ - I
N‘; THE MEANTIME, some,:def,i_nité,pressure

are looking to remain t-hereas peopleis repre-
sentatives. = .

‘ '_',There isthe an important Eorandl bill HR-

‘ I, 4700, ‘to cover medical ‘and hospital care for
._ _Social Security pensioners. Senator Morse has

introduced amendments to. the Kennedy-Land-
rlun-Griffith Act, S-3097 and S-3098, which do
not go far enough but will help to eliminate
some of the pitfalls. Other. important bills
worthy of support are HR-4488 on Unemploy-
ment Compensation and HR-22 Federal Aid to
Education. '

One sacred duty we have as good citizens
is to register and vote and t9 see that our
neighbors are registered and will Vote. Express
your feelings on both good and harmful legis-
lation and get those who aspire for high offices
as your representative to declare themselves
on this legislation. That is at least half the
battle to offset the, strangulating anti-labor
laws being planned that are not for the people

but for special interests.——JOHN -CLARK.

    

 

PRESIDENT ROBERT BEY of Mine-Mill Chicago local 758 hands out leaf-
lets as other local members carry signs in support of student sit-in
clemonstations for de-segregated lunch counters in the South. Many
other unions conducted similiar picket lines at Woolworth and other
(time store chains around the country.

Southern ‘Sit-in’ Protests
Gain Nation-wide Support

CHICAGO—Members of Mine-Mill Local 758 here
last month joined with political, labor, civic, university
and church groups all over the country in a show of
support behind the student sit-in demonstrations for
non—segregated service at dime store lunch counters in

the South. .

Countless parallels to the
Local 758 action in picketing
Woolworth’s could be found in
diversified quarters.

IN CALIFORNIA, for in-

voted overwhelmingly to back
the Negro students’ protests
against lunch-counter segrega-
tion. I
1 From the deep South itself,
Governor Leroy Collins of
Florida went on a. statewide
TV broadcast to state that, in
his opinion, “lunch - counter
segregation is morally wrong.”

The North Carolina State
AFL-CIO, in probably one of

the strongest civil rights reso-,

lutions ever passed by a labor

body in the South, threw the

support of its more than 35,-

ins” staged by Negro stu-
dents.

Health Care for
Aged Top Issue 

EDICAL care for the aged has sudés
denly become the hottest domestic
issue in this 1960 election year. The health
needs of 16 million Americans over 65 are
the stake in this most important piece of
Social legislation since the --   
Social Security law was en‘
acted in 1936. Many of our
members will remember "an
the furor and ph”o'n‘e‘y"
charges raised by the re-
actionary politicians and the
press against Social Secur
ity legislation almost 25
years ago. They tried to
scare Congress and the
American people with
charges of “Socialism,”
“Communism” and the hor- Skinner .
rible specter of the country going broke at-
tempting to support such an impossible finan-
cial burden as Social Security. V ’
But 1936 was the era of the “New Deal,"
and in those days the" Democratic Party under
Franklin Roosevelt was a people’s party . . .so_,
despitethe organized opposition of big business
and the press the Social Security law was en-
acted and became effective in 1937. -

*.—‘k*

OW, THAT a ‘few conscientious men ‘in
Congress have introduced legislation. to
extend Social Security benefits to include hos-
pital and medical care the same hue and cry

    

rm. any

of exhorbitant taxation, bankruptcy and "so. ,

cia1ism” is being raised again by the sameen-
trenched interests who fought the orignial So-
cial Security Law 25 years ago.

Isn’t it odd that these. big business leaders
who fret so much about the cost of medical
care for aged Americans never bat an eye
about spending over 50% of;.theV annual govern-

ment income for armaments, atom bombs,

satellites and moon shots?

But what about the health and welfare of‘

16 million of our elderly citizens? By 1970 the
population of Americans. over 65 years of age
will reach 20 million. Isn’t it important that
many thousands of these citizens die unneces-
sarily every year because they can’t afford to
pay for proper medical care when they become
ill? . ’ I

Isn’t the welfare of these senior citizens
just as important to our country as who gets
to the moon first——Uni‘ted States or Russia?

LMOST EVERY Mine-Mill member with

experience -on negotiating committees in
recent years knows how difficult it is to wring

any concessions from the corporations for _medi- .

THE. MINE-MILII. UNION

  

Congress

(Continued from Front Page)
weeks ago, the Forand meas-
ure has become the hottest
issue in Congress.

A rising tide of grassroots
pressure forced the Demo-

cratic leadership into 21l’firma-

tive action. House S p e a k e 1-
Sam Rayburn and Senate Ma-
jority Leader Lyndon Johnson
both promised Congressional
consideration of a compromise
medical care program.

For their part, Republican
leaders, frightened by reaction
in their ranks to the Presi-
dent’s flat rejection of the

”Forand program, are scratch-

ing _around for alternatives
which will. place their party
in a more favorable light with
the nation’s 16 million persons
aged 65 and over.
* >14 >l=

THE MOST likely Demo-
cratic plan is one offering
“optional” health insurance
for Social Security pensioners.
The optional feature was in-
cluded to get around opposi-
tion, stirred up by the Ameri-
can Medical Association, to
any compulsory program.

Under the plan, pensioners
would have the choice of hos-

pitalization insurance or high-
er cash retirement benefits.

The costs would be financed
by increasing Social Security
taxes.

Such a compromise, while
preserving the principle of the
Forand bill, falls far short of

_its benefits. Its most positive
_aspect, as seen by liberals, is

use of the Social Security sys-
tem. Largely from that stand-
point, it is regarded as a step

in the right direction.

>3 * *

THE ADMINISTRATION,
as a first step in meeting
election year pressures, an-
nounced “guidelines” for a.
voluntary he a 1 t h insurance
program. These suggestions
flatly rejected the concept of
fitting such insurance» within
the framework of Social Se-
curity.

As outlined by Senate Mi-
nority Leader Dirksen, the Ad-
ministration was said to be
prepared to support a health
insurance bill if it were volun-

tary, not excessive in scope,

somewha.t limited in benefits,

not linked to a. Social Security
tax increase, based on private
health insurance systems, and
operated at state levels.

Dirksen stated the Federal
Government would help fi-
nance the program out of gen-
eral tax revenues but the actu-
al extent of Federal and state
participation was a question
not yet worked out.

LATER, e i gh t Republican
Senators, led by J avits of New
York, introduced‘ a. Health. In-
s ur a n c e- for the Aged Act,
S3350. Vifhile even this bill
was regarded as too generous
by the Administration, it ap-
peared to have broad. support
in Republican ranks as an off-
set to the Fora-nd measure.

The Javits bill would pro-
vide Federal and state sub.-
sidies to help pay for insur-
ance against costs of hospitali-
zation, home nursing, medical

and surgical care. Pa.rl;icipa.- ’

tion would be voluntary, with
anyone over 65 eligible. Pre-
miums would range from 50
cents to $13 a month for per-
sons with an income of $3600
and over a year.

Completely outside the So-
cial Security system, the Jav-
its program would be adminis-
tered by‘ the individual states,
each of which would set its

own level of benefits.
* vlt *

THE JAVITS bill was. im-’

mediately denounoed by Dem-
ocratic liberals. as “pie-i:n.-the-
sky,” “a cruel? hoax," “a wind-
fall to insurance companies
but a shabby subterfuge so
far as meeting older people’s
need for medical? care.”

In a detailed analysis of the
Republican alternative, AFL-
CIO Social Security Dir. Nel-
son Cruikshank said there was
“virtually no possibility” that
each of the 50 states. could or
would raise their share of the

Mine-Mill Labor Unity Fight
Draws Canada-Wde Support

TORONTO,'Ont.—Oil and chemical workers, steel workers, painters and decora-
tors, carpenters, electricians, machinists and pulp and sulphite unions are among some
of the affiliates to the Canadian Labour Congress who have publicly expressed sup-

filiation before the convention of the Congress.

The Kootenay District

Council of Carpenters rep- I

resenting all affiliated local
unions in Kimberley,
brook, Creston, Nelson and
Castlegar in British Columbia
wrote CLC President Claude
Jodoin that “it is the unani-
mous feeling of our members,

, that to refuse such a. request

would be a violation of one of
the basic principles of justice
on which 0 u r Congress is

founded and operated.”

“All, of our local unions in
this area,” said the letter to
the Congress from the Car-
penters, “have a particular in-

- terest in this union's applica-

tion since Mine Mill is the
largest organized body in our
area, and any efforts of or-
ganized labor in his area with-

,out the active support of this
— largest group becomes little

morethan a futile gesture.”

Strong criticism of the Jav-

testifying before the Senate

leading advisor on Social Se-
curity, assailed it as “a clumsy,

reports from mines and mills

all lead-zinc mines except those
of the “gopher-hole” variety,
and was close to a 100% count
of all production workers.

Because of the way in which
the data are gathered, the
Tariff commission and Census

of the consumer price index
(heavy line) and price trends
for such items as food, rent,
transportation and m e d i c al
care.

Immediate cause of the rise
in March was a jump in food
prices as meats, eggs and
vegetables went up. Govern-
mernt"s tight money policy has
also influenced cost-of-living,
as it has pushed up cost of
buying autos and other things
bought on time, and has added
to interest cost of home buy-
"mg.

Government economists say
the March price jump may be
the beginning of a new round
of retail price increases that
could last at least until mid-
summer. In recent years Au-
gust has generally registered
a decline as fresh produce
reached markets in full vol-
ume, Government pessimism
stems in part from the big-
gest jump in two years in
wholesale prices, to a new high
last March.

Wholesale prices were still
going up in April according
to latest reports. Wholesale
prices usually have a delayed
reaction on consumer prices.

were unable to reach agreement among themselves.
A majority, four of the six commissioners, declined

tions in response to a re-
quest from Congress for
specific ‘findings as to addi-
tional lead-zinc quotas or
tariffs, if any, needed to put
lead-zinc mining on a sound,
stable basis. The four commis-
sioners said that to make
such recommendations would

"TWO commissioners recom-
mended that tariffs on lead

The proposed tariff rate

legislation as the President,
while he can increase rates
above existing levels, lacks the
power to raise them to the
proposed amounts.

THE REPORT gives the im-
pression that the four com-
missioners who made no rec-

favor increased tariffs rather
than quotas.

Capital observers consider it

of this session, especially since

INDUSTRYOTB.

BRASS MILL LAYOFFS and short weeks are in the news
from coast to coast. Brass valley in Connecticut, Buffalo, Los
Angeles and other major industry centers have been hit by a
slump in orders for sheet, strip, tubing and other mill products
since early last December. For the four months December
through March, orders received by ‘U. S. brass and wire mills
have run nearly 25 percent below the average monthly orders
of the poor years 1954 and 1958, and about 35 percent below 1959.
Mills’ backlog of unfilled orders is lowest in nearly two years.

Troubles of brass mills began with first signs of an end to
the 1959-60 copper strikes. Mill’s customers started cutting down
on size of brass inventories as soon as danger of a supply pinch
lessened. For them, this meant less money tied up in inventories,
and less danger of getting stuck if price of copper went down.
On top of this, brass mills have been hit by slowed auto produc-
tion, low level activity in construction, and declining U. S. in-
dustrial ‘production since January.

Some improvement in brass is expected later in the spring,
but business this year may not be as good for brass mills as in
1959. Relaxation in government’s tight money policies, plus ‘sub-
stantial federal aid for school and hospital construction and a
-100;%- increase in housing starts would restore lost brass mill

business and create additional jobs in brass.

- . *

‘ ‘’ IMPORTS of brass mill prtdueirs in 1959 were 200 million
pounds, a new record, ten times as much as in 1949 and four
times as much as in 1954. 1959 imports were about one-tenth as
large as shipments by U. S. brass mills.

Stung by growing foriegn competition, U.S. brass mills cut
prices of tubing by 5 percent last March and some sheet prices
about 14% in April. New prices are expected to win back busi-
ness lost to foreign‘ competition.

* ‘k
COPPER MINE OUTPUT in the United States as reported"

by Copper Institute hit a new record of 107,995 tons in March,

marking virtually full resumption of production after the long,

strike. Foreign mines also turned in a new record in March,
producing nearly 200,000 tons of the red metal.

If production kept up at this rate for the rest of 1960, the
total for the year, including both domestic and foreign, would
be over a half million tons more than were minedin any previ-
ous year. Phelps Dodge president Robert G. Page says in first
three months of 1960 world copper production exceeded copper
use by about 5 percent despite continued U. S. strikes at some
mines. in January and February. '

BUNKER HILL and ST. JOE LEAD have run afoul of the
Sherman Anti-Trust act. Under an arrangement dating back
for nearly forty years to 1922, St. Joe Lead has been the ex-

and in certain foreign countries.

Last month in the Federal District Court of New York,
Judge D. J. Edelstein ruled this agreement was in violation» of

Sales of nickel-cadmium batteries were up as high as $20
million last year, compared with $625 million for lead-acid bat-
teries, such as used in automobiles. Autos are likely to con-

of outstanding issues March 25. Maintenance workers were
immediately recalled, and the 175,000 tons per year plant

LEAD-ZINC MINE ‘subsidy legislation was considered at
hearings of a House Interior Committee sub-group_late in March
and again in mid-April. At.press time no action had been
taken by committee. One difficulty facing law makers was that

several different proposals had been submitted and united sup- _

port behind any single bill was lacking.

Chances of favorable action were dimmed by testimony of
Eisenhower administration spokesmen opposing subsidy legis-
lation and taking credit for the lead-zinc import quotas pro-
claimed by Eisenhower on October 1, 1958. _Assistant Interior
Secretary Royce Hardy testified “since imposition of the quotas,
the position of the domestic industry has steadily improved... .
Dramatic advances have been recorded for zinc, and although
similar advances have not yet been realized in the case of lead,
the way has been opened for solid ga1ns.’’ “

Hard rock miners have failed -thus far to note any dra-
matic advances” in the number of jobs in lead-zinc mining. On
the contrary, jobs have. continued to shrink, year after year
since 1956.

West Virginia involving Senators Kennedy and Humph-

Mine-Mill Legislative commit-
tee, headed by District 1 Exe-
cutive Board Member Ernest
Salvas, were invited to and at-
state AFL-CIO
COPE convention which inter-
viewed and endorsed primary
candidates for national and
state office. The Mine-Mill fra-
ternal delegation was intro-
duced by Montana AFL-CIO
President James Umber and
welcomed by the COPE con-
vention.

Among the top candidates
endorsed by Montana COPE
were Arnold Olsen and Leo
Graybill for U. S. Congress
and Paul Cannon for Gover-
nor. No. endorsement was made
on the U. S. Senate race in
which Congressman Lee Met-
calf is a candidate against Sen-
ator James Murray.

The Mine-Mill committee it-
self was withholding formal
endorsement recommendations
until after the April 28 closing
of candidate filings, although
rank-and-file membership ma-
jority opinion has already in-
dicated support for Metcalf,
Olsen and Cannon.

leaders in other cases. They
are Ralph Locke, James E. Pe-

Horie and George Knott. Pe-
tersen is now Industrial Rela-
Ations Director for the Kenne-
cott Copper Corporation. Ortiz
and Horie are on the staff pay-
roll of the Steelworkers union.

The sixth witness, on whom
Cherry reserved ruling, is Ken
Eckert who quit as board
member in 1948 to lead a raid
against Mine-Mill by the Auto
Workers. He is still on the
UAW payroll.

There have been cases be-
fore when the testimony of a
witness has been stricken from
the record upon his refusal to
subject himself to cross-exam-
ination. But this is probably
the first case in American le-
gal history when .there has
been such a refusal by SIX
witnesses!

It should be remembered
that when these witnesses tes-
tified for the government in
the SACB hearings in 1957,
the Jencks case had not yet
been decided by the Supreme
Court of the United States;
nor had the so-called “Jencks

" law,” based on that decision

a which freed Jencks, been
. passed by Congress.
>l= =l£ =l=

AT THE TIME the witnesses
testified,‘Witt moved for pro-
du tion of the statements they
had previously made to the
FBI, but Cherry reserved his
ruling on this request until
after the J encks case had been
decided. With the Court's de-
cision and the subsequent-corp
gressional statute, the govern-

Rips SACB Case

ment was required to produce
the statements.

Rather than do this, govern-
ment attorney Broome has now
had their testimony stricken.

At last month’s hearing, Witt
pointed out that one or more
of these witnesses had testified
against Mine-Mill- in other
cases over the years. He also
made the point that Locke,
Petersen, Ortiz and Eckert had
testified in the Taft-Hartley
conspiracy case last year.

WITT ARGUED further that
it was therefore especially im-
portant to find out whether
these witnesses had told the
truth in the SACB case, and
that. their statements would
help show this.

When his motion to dismiss ’

the entire case was denied,
Witt then asked that Cherry
himself examine the state-
ments to see if they were con-
sistent with the testimony of
the witnesses, or that Broome
should state for the record

whether that was the case.‘

Otherwise, Witt said, the sus-

picion could not be avoided
that Broome was refusing to
produce the statements be-
cause they would discredit the
witnesses.

Cherry, however,

these requests also.
‘ 34 >9 =l=

denied

IN THE CASE of six other
witnesses, Cherry ruled that
their statements did not meet
the requirements of the
“Jencks law” and therefore
they would not be turned over
to Witt for examination.

The only witnesses in the
case whose statements Broome
did produce were the four paid
FBI informers—Harold Kent,
Rowena Paumi, Art Moralez
and Bellarmino Duran.

On the basis of the state-_
ments, Witt cross-examined

Kent and Paumi at a further

hearing in Bridgeport, Conn.,
on April 25, and was scheduled
to cross-examine Moralez and
Duran at a hearing in Salt
Lake City on May 5.

Details will appear in the
next issue of the Mine-Mill
Union.

WITH THE California pri-
mary date June 7, the same as
Montana, Local 700 in Los An-
geles is planning political ac-
tion on all cylinders this year.

IAM-member John C. Stres-
ky, who is seeking the Demo-
cratic nomination in a race
against Congressman Clyde
Doyle from California’s 23rd
Congressional district, was en-
dorsed by the Mine-Mill local’s
executive board. Doyle was the
only Democratic candidate not
endorsed by the Democratic
party’s central committee,
mainly because he voted for
the Landrum-Griffin bill.

The Local 700 board also ap-
proved the action of Los An-
geles Democratic Councilman
Edward Roybal who is form-
ing a new state-wide organiza-
tion called the Mexican-Ameri-
can Political Association to

promote, through political ac--

tion, the social, economic, cul-
tural and civic betterment of
Mexican-Americans and other
Spanish-speaking people. In-
vited by Roybal to participate,
Local 700 plans to be repre-
sented at a Los Angeles re-
gional conference of the asso-
ciation when it is called.

Telegrams were also sent by  A

 btually Happened!  

' so help us, the following news item about Mine-Mill Ari-‘ ’ I
zona Regional Director Jack Marcotti is reprinted here exactly
as it allbeared in the April 20 Tucson ‘Daily Citizen:

It’s A Fact;
Marcotti
Likes Dogs

Jack Marcotti, 802~ Tipton
St., a well-known labor leader,
likes dogs. He wants his neigh-
bors to know that he likes
dogs. ‘

It was not he who let a tiny
Beagle out to roam the streets.
And it Wasn’t he who locked
the Beagle in the yard to leave
it yowling all day.

Here is Marcotti’s dog story
which he hopes will clear up
the case of mistaken dog iden-
tity:

Last Wednesday, Marcotti,
leaving on a trip to California,
left his four-month-old female
Beagle, Duchess, in a private
kennel.

On Friday, another Beagle
which was a dead-ringer for
Duchess, showed up in the
neighborhood. Some neighbor-
hood children mistook it for
Duchess and locked it up in
the yard.

As the dog was unattended
for hours it began howling to
the annoyance of the neigh-
borhood.

When Marcotti returned
home over the weekend, he

found a note on his door from
the Animal Shelter stating
that his dog was impounded
as the result of complaints.
“The circumstantial evidence
was against me,” Marcotti
said, “but for one thing. The
stray dog was a boy. .

“I’ve brought Duchess home .
from the private kennel, but
‘somebody’s pet is now at-tPIer%"-‘f-7f'ii'

Animal Shelter. Whoever the
owner is should contact the
shelter,’—’ he said.
