    

The Negro workers and masses fully demonstrated their readi-
ness to struggle for peace in the Chicago Negro Labor Conference
last June and in the exceptional response to the Stockholm Peace

Pledge. Now is the time for them to break through the walls of '

separation which the Negro reformists and Social-Democrats have
attempted to erect between the Negro masses and the broad people’s
coalition against war and fascism. Unless this moment is quickly
and ﬁrmly grasped it could be frittered away in fresh outpourings
of demagogy, bribery, and McCarran Act terror against the Negro
liberation movement. Within the ranks of the Negro people, upon
the shoulders of Negro Communists, in particular, falls the supreme
task of winning the Negro people’s movement directly for the
broad people’s coalition for peace.

It is necessary to stimulate all forms of peace and freedom com-
mittes among the Negro people, based upon their existing organi-
zations and upon the distinctive characteristics of the Negro lib-
e ation movement, South and North.‘ ' _ ' _

First of all, it is vitally urgent to help bring to life the Con-
tinuations Committee of the Chicago Negro Trade Union Confer-
ence. Every assistance should be given to the Negro Labor Councils
to establish or fortify themselves in each urban center of basic Negro
workers, North and South. These Negro Labor Councils, in addi-
tion to their other central tasks, can give indispensable aid to the
mass civilian movement for the freedom of Lieutenant Gilbert and
the ending of army Jim Crow, whose immediate demand is to
bring our boys and their fellow white soldiers back home away
from the brutal arrogance of MacArthur.

It especially means plunging more fully into the Negro liberation
movement, at whatever point and level affords an entry. It means
foreseeing the special economic doom which the war economy
is bringing down upon the Negro people, and tackling the job,
relief and housing problems of the Negro people now, not to-
morrow. It means raising the struggle for civil rights to a new
level in the 82nd Congress. S

It means above all helping the Negro workers and people to
draw the conclusion that the defense of their liberties and the ad-
10

    

vancement of Negro rights are bound up with the key struggle
against a third world war; that the success of all their liberation
struggles depends upon the ability of the Negro and white workers
and people together to impose a peace policy upon the maniacal,
war-mad ruling class and its two corrupt party machines.

II.. The New Features of .'l'he Negro Liberal-ion
Movemeni

Comrade Hall has dealt soundly with the new features of the
Negro liberation movement, as correctly posed in our Resolution.
I want to deal principally with certain disputed questions and with
new points of emphasis.

Can it be said, as was forcefully argued by certain comrades in
the pre-convention discussion bulletin, that the chief new feature
of the Negro liberation movement is the shift of large and inﬂu-
ential sections of the Negro bourgeoisie to the war camp of U.S.
imperialism? Yes, comrades, it can be ‘said-. But it is not true.
Such a view will seriously disorient the struggle for Negro liberation
and for peace. ’

The shift of inﬂuential sections of the Negro bourgeoisie to the
role of outright agents of Wall Street imperialism, and even as
open anti-Communist, anti-Soviet trumpets of war, is one of the
features of the new period. But it is not the most important ele-
ment. However, it is an element that should not be under-esti-
mated, any more than over-estimated.

This is a narrow view, and objectively tends to deny the national
character of the Negro liberation movement, a character that is
growing constantly sharper. Any policy which objectively tends
in this direction, obviously aids reactionary Negro bourgeois re-
formists, like Lester Granger, who deny the national character
of the Negro movement and constantly chatter that the struggle
against segregation is over, and all one has to do is to ’ pick up
the pieces. Granger thinks that the poverty, police violence and

11 ' ‘

    

segregation, suffered by the Negro masses, -no longer exist because
the war-mad capitalists, like the late James Forrestal, gave him a
crumb or two from their Jim-Crow table.

The most important new features of the Negro liberation move-
ment are: First, the international signiﬁcance of this question,
originally noted by Comrade Poster at the March plenum this year,
and reﬂected in the present crisis in U.S. foreign policy. Second,
the intensiﬁcation of the pro-fascist oppression of the Negro peo-
ple nationally, and in the Black Belt in particular, in consequence
of U.S. monopo1y’s drive toward world domination, war and fas-
cism. Third, the increased militancy of the Negro people and
their white supporters, particularly in the deep South among the
workers and sharecroppers, where they are defending their lives,
frequently with arms in hand as is their constitutional right, and
where the Negro workers symbolized especially in the Negro rail-
road workers, are assuming a more leading role in the struggle
for national liberation. Since the new turn of events in Korea,
the militancy and consciousness of the Negro workers have become

even sharper than they were at the time of the Chicago Negro-

Trade Union Conference.

The principal questions ﬂowing out of the developments in the
Negro people’s movement over the past period fall into three main
categories.

First, perspective. The unique contribution of Communists in this
movement is to imbue it with a revolutionary perspective, as
against a reformist perspective. A new emphasis on this feature
should dominate our work in the existing Negro people’s organi-
zations, unions and communities. One of the cardinal reasons for
thesporadic and uneven practical work in the struggle for Negro
rights on a national scale is the lack of a uniﬁed perspective and
an organized mass base among the Negro people ﬁghting for a
revolutionary Negro people’s movement, with the working class
as its leader.

W/all Street’s Negro reformist agents have converted the
N.A.A.C.P., the National Council of Negro Women and, even
the Brooklyn Dodgers, into a base for their warmqpgering sub-

12

    

{\-

{-

servience to imperialism and their undermining of the Negro peo-
ple’s unity and militancy. The central weakness of our work in
the historic N.A.A.C.P. Washington Mobilization was the failure
to introduce into this ﬁght a revolutionary content, namely, the
consciousness that this vast people's movement is part of the ﬁght
for peace and against American imperialism. The main example
of this weakness in revolutionary content is the failure to realize
that the heart of the Negro liberation movement is the question of
freeing the Negro nation in the Black Belt, the base of the whole
national system of oppression.

Such a revolutionary perspective is not a rejection of reforms or
of working with reformists per se, but on the contrary, the surest
guarantee that partial and big reforms will be achieved to relieve
the growing misery and war-inspired persecution of the Negro
people. -

Second, at all times, the Left and progressive forces among the
Negro people should champion the unity of the Negro people-
including their all-class unity—around a minimum program on
partial issues. This is the essence ‘of the united front from below.
It is the treacherous Negro bourgeois reformists and Social-
Democrats who split the Negro people, but the Negro people can
never be united in support of Wan Street’s aggressive program
to subjugate the Negro or any other oppressed people. It is es-
pecially vital and urgent to ﬁght for the unity of the Negro people,
and for their alliance with white labor, progressive and peace
forces. . ‘

Third, to assure Negro working-class leadership of the Negro
liberation movement. By far the most important new factor es-
sential to achieve the central objectives of the Negro liberation
movement—to transform this movement into a national upsurge——
is to establish the leadership of the Negro workers. In the Black
Belt this must be buttressed by the alliance between the Negro
workers and the sharecroppers, the peons and poor farmers.

It is not enough _to talk generally about establishing this lead-
ership. Unless Negro Labor Councils are supported, talk of estab-
lishing such working-class leadership is opportunist phrasemonger-

13

    

ing. ‘While the Negro bourgeoisie as a class cannot lead the Negro
people’s movement, many of these elements can play a progressive
role, but only under the leadership of the Negro workers. The
leading role of the Negro workers is the key to unity of the Negro
people within, and with their staunch white working-class and pro-
gressive allies.

The test of political understanding of this new period of the
Negro liberation movement is the extent to which Negro Labor
Councils are built and a mass circulation secured for the monthly
journal Freedom, organ of the developing anti-imperialist and
peace currents among the Negro people. Freedom is not just
another newspaper but a fighter for, leader, and organizer of,
the Negro people’s movement for freedom and peace. Its place
is in the Pittsburgh and Chicago steel mills, the West Virginia coal
mines, the New York and Southern railroad yards, the Black Belt
plantations, the homes of the Negro workers in the urban indus-
trial centers of the North.

‘-1

ill. it The Economic Front

Economic issues are basic to the struggle for Negro rights, and
will become more so. Yet this is the weakest front in the struggle
for Negro liberation. This reﬂects a fundamental lack of orienta-
tion on the Negro workers. It also mirrors the petty bourgeois
and bourgeois pressures upon progressive, and even Communist,
forces. It is a negative tribute to the hypnoticupower of the lying
capitalist propaganda machine, which is trying to hide the sharp-
ening misery of the Negro masses behind a few jobs to hand-picked
individual Negroes.

Judge Hastie has a $15,000 job. But Negro workers cannot get
jobs to drive milk wagons. Dr. Ralph Bunche has a $20,000 a year
job. But the airplane factories in Long Island will not hire Negro
workers. Channing Tobias is the ﬁrst Negro. director of a ‘Wall
Street bank. But the brewery corporations, General Electric and
other giant monopolies will not employ Negroes. Edith Sampson
is ‘a U.S. delegate to the United Nations. But Negro women are
14

   

- .. ,‘......

virtually driven out of industry and Rosa Lee Ingram is still in a
Georgia dungeon, a living sacriﬁce to the degradation imposed
upon Negro women by the lynch system. There is a $28,000-a-year
General Sessions Negro judge in New York. But the Negro Black
Belt sharecroppers do not make enough to live on, and never get out

i of debt. ,

 

These relatively high paying jobs come to individual Negroes
in an attempt of the ruling class to head off and undermine the
militant struggles of the Negro workers for jobs and freedom. All
such crumbs thrown to Negro leaders are supposed to hide the op-
pression of the Negro people, and in the first place the fact that
the Negro people, beginning with the Black Belt, are a source of
super-proﬁts to American imperialism. The double and triple op-
pression of the Negro people is class oppression by the American
monopolists and their landlord-bourbon agents in the deep South.
The Wall-Street war economy aims to sweat more blood and proﬁts
from the Negro people than from any other section of the popu~
lation.

Typical of the stiﬂing ghetto conditionsvamong the Negro people

are these shocking ﬁgures from Harlem. Recently there has been-

a rise of 44- per cent in tuberculosis among the Negro population,
and of 181 per cent among the Puerto Rican population! This isn’t
only a health problem. It shows that these people do not have
jobs and money to pay the doctor, cannot live in decent houses,
cannot buy clothes for themselves and their children, cannot pay
the rising costs of the rotten food which the monopolies dump
upon the Puerto Rican and Negro communities. Harlem, and every
cth-er Negro ghetto, is literally falling to pieces. In its draughty, un-
heated slums, it is not necessary to go outside the apartment to-tell
when there is zero weather.

The struggle for jobs, relief and housing must be given a new
quality of political attention and mass support in the Negro people's
movement. The Negro workers cannot reach the level of conscious
lcafership of the Negro liberation movement unless the basic eco-
nomic issues of the Negro masses are tackled, and victories wrested
from the greedy, war-drunk capitalists.

15

  

 IV.: The South

. Comrade. Jackson made extended remarks on.,the question of the
South, which our Convention would do well to heed. But the new
element..in.., this which I want to emphasize is the .need_-to secure

 

a drastic improvement in the Northern workers’ political under?

standing of their major responsibility to the South, especially to the
Negro nation in _the Black Belt. This means a heightened appre-
ciation of work in.Harlem, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Philadel-
phia and_other cities having Negro basic workers. - _ ,

The C.I.O. Southern organizing drive «foundered because it would
not face up to the key importance of the Negro question inthe deep
South. What is needed is a Southern organizing drive that faces
upto thisaquestion. Such a drive will replenish the depleted ranks
ofrmany unions, the Left-led unions as well.

-The advanced forces of the trade unions in the North must make
it their central -task to imbue their activity for Negro rights with
recognition of its basic relation to the imprisoned Negro nation
in the South. These unions, and other politically advanced forces,
must assist the development of Negro proletarian leadership in the
Black Belt area for the Negro nation in the South—a cardinal
political task and an act of proletarian internationalism, for which
an occasional small contribution "is no substitute.

Caravans‘ of food were trucked to the embattled Southern miners,
and correctly so.‘ But Negro shatecroppers and white comrades
from the Black Belt must come all the way to the Northern "centers

‘to take pot hick at meetings and parties which net them a few paltry

  

pennies. This situation has nothing in common with aVLeninist
understanding of the dignity of an oppressed nation, and its role
in the ﬁght against war andvfascism. It is’ due to a basic political
shortcorriing and should be drastically and quickly overcome.

' I  Remarksuonwilhe Pqrfyi

‘Since the'Ii(orean war,.tl1ere_‘L has been a noticeable in. our
Party’s struggle for Negro rights." A period of complacency set

 

 

in with respect to. the ﬁght against. the main danger, white» chauvin-
ism. . ' :. .  ' 
~-This ‘is not due to our Party’-s main 5line in- this ﬁeld. For ex-
perience since the last Convention has conﬁrmed its correctness,
and the soundness._,of its tactical elaborations. The- absence of our
teacher-and leader, Comrade» Foster, and the imprisonment of - our
General Secretary Comrade Dennis, have found Comrade Gus
Hall, With, the collective assistance of Comrades Winston and Wil-
liamson and the National -Committee, measuring up to the diﬂﬁcult
and intricate tasks in this ﬁeld. ‘

The main reason for this let-down was the increased spewing
of white and national chauvinism against the Negro and" other
minority groups by the American monopolists,‘ who in Korea"'went
over to actual war against a colored colonial people "heroically
ﬁghting for their national independence, peace‘ and democracy. '
" "The existing level of our struggle against white chauvinism, the
main danger, was not high enough to face up toithe increased
racism fostered among the American people by the pro-fascist im-
perialists. ' V ' ' :

This level is still too low, although _a beginning was made -in
thecase of Lieutenant Gilbert, the Martinsville Seven,_ and in nu-
merous other cases of police violence in various parts of the
country.’ , A _ _ _

_Comrades_, it is shocking that, in spite of the gains made. in
the ﬁght against white chauvinism, primitive acts of white chau-
vinism can still reveal themselves even at the level of County and
State Communist.Party conventions. We must quickly getup off
that level, for time does not wait.

. Drastic discipline has to be imposed in such cases. For some of
these crude.-cases, comrades, a-re astounding.

Our Party is not a white chauvinist organization, but the leader
of the ﬁ=ght- against ‘«white chauvinism. And ‘despite its weaknesses,
there’-are -far' fewer acts of whitetthauvinism-in its ‘ranks, and "more
realwdemocratic» brotherhood, than in any organization in the United
States. ‘That-’s’beca&-1se' the Communist Party is- a ‘working-class-’ Party,

._,-;--..'‘-1-,. j.-; 7.. .:‘=-.;":.- . —l7 .  , 

 

based upon Negro and white workers, and equipped with the science
of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.

Raising the level of the ﬁght against white chauvinism means
not merely Party discipline against internal acts of chauvinism,
highly important as they are. It means developing a mass struggle
against white chauvinism which will reﬂect itself in the development
of a national upsurge of the Negro liberation movement for equal-
ity, democracy and peace and against the war program of the
American monopolists. This mass character of the struggle against
white chauvinism should be the new emphasis in the struggle
against white chauvinism. It means recognizing that the imperialist
war has sharpened the national character of the Negro liberation
movement, not blunted it.

‘This requires in the ﬁrst place the ﬁght for the line of our Party
on the Negro question as a national question, including the right
of, self-determination for the Negro majority in the Black Belt.
It must be understood that our campaign against white chauvinisrn
flows from the correction of our basic line in 1945 and the adoption
of the position that the Negro‘ question is a national question in
1946—all under the leadership of Comrade Foster. It requires
that a stop be put to all tendencies to regard the strategic objective
of the liberation of the Negro people as correct, while regarding
our Party’s tactical line on this question as a free-for-all. This
tendency would permit each state organization, or group of so-
called expert tacticians, to decide whether the building of Negro
Labor Councils meets their highly unique situation, or whether
it would have been better if the magazine Freedom had been
merged with something else, and to sit back while tactical differ-
ences are endlessly debated.

Readiness to accept and fight for the tactical line of our Party
on the Negro question, down to every detailed Party decision, is the
first test of resolute struggle against white chauvinism. Either this
test is met, or we open our Party to Social-Democratic, Right-op-
portunist deviations which will damage every single aspect of our
work. The Party’s tactical line on this question cannot be opposed
without throwing into question the whole strategic objective of the

liberation of the Negro people, of the emancipation of the working

18

class from capitalist exploitation and the establishment of Social-
ism. Our Party’s line on the‘Negro question is a Leninist-Stalinist
principle and method of work.

Our Party ﬁghts for the unconditional political and economic
equality of the Negro people—and especially for their social equal-
ity. Petty bourgeois concepts of a person choosing his own friends,
that his social life is his own personal concern, smell of the slave
market and are alien to Marxism-Leninism.

Tendencies to treat the Negro people as mere victims of op-
pression, without seeing their unique positive and revolutionary
role in the struggle against capitalist reaction are a patronizing
form of white chauvinism. ’

Other hidden expressions of white chauvinism reﬂect theclinging
tenacity of anti-Leninist theories of American exceptionalism. There
is a “not-so-bad,” “respectable” white chauvinism. For example,
an evaluation of a comrade that he is "quite good,” except that he
is a “little weak on the Negro question.” Undoubtedly, a com-
rade "weak” on this basic question, is weak on all questions.
All white chauvinism is impermissible and. must be eradicated.

Then there are tendencies to require that a Negro comrade be
better than all the white comrades within a thousand miles of the
Party body that is considering him. Such un-Marxist standards have
their roots in chauvinism. But it is" equally incorrect to encourage
lower standards of work among our Negro comrades; This also
negates the special and national character of the Negro question.
Sometimes it is apparently required that a Negro Party functionary

be a combination of Stalin, Foster and Frederick Douglass. This is

objective aid to false white chauvinist standards of leadership. It is
not a Leninist-Stalinist cadre policy applied to our Negro com-
rades.

A basically serious reﬂection of white chauvinism is the failure of
our Party boldly to promote Negro working-class, women and
youth cadre, a tendency which negates the main task of the Negro
liberation movement, namely to help establish the leadership of
the working class "in this movement. Often this weakness is accom-
panied" by’ another, which tends to make invidious comparisons

Nofe fo +he Reader

This pamphlet contains the full text of the report of Benjamin
J. Davis, former Councilman of the City of New York and member
of the Communist Party’s National Committee, to the Party’_s 15th
National Convention, held on December 28-31, 1950, in New York
City.

Mr. Davis, an outstanding leader of the Negro liberation struggle
in the United States and a militant ﬁghter for peace, is one of the
eleven Communist leaders convicted in the notorious Foley Square
“thought control” trial, and is now free "on bail while his conviction
is under appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court.

He was formerly a defense attorney in the Scottsboro and Angelo

A Herndon cases, and his active participation and leadership of the

  

labor and Negro people's struggle for peace and freedom has
brought him national prominence. C

He is also author of The Path of Negro Liberation, published by

on the professional social origins of some of our staunchest Negro
cadres. All our Negro cadre are Communist Party cadre.

It will be a sign that we are seriously ﬁghting white chauvinism
when our white comrades on every level of the Party take the lead
in combatting this millstone around the neck of the American
working class in its struggle for peace, democracy and, ultimately,
Socialism. Comrade Gus Hall's treatment of the Negro question
and white chauvinism is worthy of emulation by our entire Party
membership. Many white comrades who do not take the lead in
this ﬁght compound their anti-Marxist weakness by falsely charging
Negro comrades who do with Negro bourgeois nationalism.

Recognizing the main danger within the ranks of the Negro
people, namely the Right reformist and Social-Democratic danger,
our Negro comrades must ward off the Right-main danger, as well
as the Left-sectarian danger. _The Right danger is reﬂected in a
hesitancy boldly to inject a revolutionary, anti-imperialist content
in our mass work, in a timidity to speak against the forcible im-
prisonment of the Negro nation in the Black Belt. For example,
in the January N.A.A.C._P. Civil=..Rights Mobilization, it was re-
ﬂected in a reluctance to infuse into that reformist-led struggle
the ﬁghting truth about Negro liberation and the decisiveness of
peace for the liberation battles of the Negro people. A revolution-
ary Negro liberation content must be injected into the fight for
such important reforms as civil rights legislation. Every anti-
Soviet slander, and anti-Communist lie, of Wall Street's Negro
agents must be challenged as a danger to the unity and effectiveness
of the Negro liberation movement -and must be exposed and
rejected. -

It is a sign of Right-opportunist pressures upon our Negro A

comrades when Negro workers do not feel at home among our
Negro cadres, when insuﬂicient work is carried on among the Ne-
gro workers in all sections of the church-going population, when
there is a lack of concentration upon basic Negro proletarians in
Negro communities, and when our Party’s main emphasis on the
united front from below is watered down in Negro urban centers.

Key in all our mass work in the Negro communities is the com-
batting of "Left” sectarianism, which ﬂows from an over-estima-

20

 

 

 

tion of the strength of the Negro reformists and Social-Demo-
crats. Our Party’s ability to fulﬁll its historic responsibility in this
new period of the Negro liberation movement depends upon our
ability to break through among the Negro workers and in Negro
communities, where we often impose a self-isolation. Though Red-
baiting and warmongering have had a substantial effect upon cer-
tain sections of the Negro people, the reservoir of good will for
the Communists has not run dry. We must strive to be worthy of
that good will by our selfless struggles for Negro liberation, for
peace and for freedom of the Negro people from every aspect of
Jim-Crow oppression. '

In the struggle against Negro bourgeois nationalism, I think
more and more we have to grasp the fact that we have not suﬂi-
ciently sharpened up this question, just as we have not sharpened
up the struggle against white chauvinism, which is the main
danger. Negro bourgeois nationalism and reformism, fed by exist-
ing white chauvinism, have an economic base among the Negro
people. The position of the Negro bourgeoisie, however small and
parasitic, arises from the class divisions among the Negro people.
Negro bourgeois reformists who sell out to Wall Street and its war
program place their narrow class interests above the national
interests and liberation struggles of the Negro people.

In the ﬁeld of Negro rights our Party has a precious ﬁghting,‘

crusading tradition which we will ever uphold and expand. The
Negro people have shown they are not going to accept the burdens
of a war. economy and lynchdom which the bourgeoisie wants to
impose upon them, and this demonstrates their understanding of
the great signiﬁcance of the peace movement as well as of their
ﬁerce passion and burning hatred for the acute repression heaped
upon them by the war-bent ruling class.

The ﬁerce hatred of white chauvinism by Negro trade unionists
is not to be feared but encouraged and given expression. These
trade unionists play a dual role-—as Negro members of the Ameri-
can working class, and as leaders of an oppressed nation. It is no
cause for alarm that Negro shop workers get together in factories
and meetings and want to discuss problems, but ways and means
should be found of bringing them together to help deepen their

21


!

ii

class-consciousness. We should foster this spirit of militant struggle,
which is at a high point among the Negro workers, and help them
transmit it to the Negro people as a whole. It is our desire to help
the Negro workers and trade unionists give leadership and develop
the Negro people’s ﬁerce burning hatred of American imperialism
into a united and powerful movement for liberation and peace.
Thus the growing national consciousness of the Negro workers is
one of the most valuable assets, not only of the Negro people's
movement, but of the American working class and trade unions.

We must pay special tribute to the work of Comrade Pettis Perry
on our National Negro Commission, who has made outstanding
contributions to its work. We have been favored by more than our
share of guidance and assistance in this ﬁeld by Comrade Winston,
who is no stranger as a mass ﬁgure in the Negro liberation move-
ment of this country. And I want to take the major share of the
criticism for many of the weaknesses of our work in this Commis-
sion, and express appreciation for the many splendid suggestions
sent from our comrades out in the ﬁeld. Among these weaknesses,
particularly "mine and those of the Commission, were insufficient
attention to the work of the Party in the South and to the role of
the Negro workers, hesitancy to plunge fully into the Negro libera-
tion movement and enhance its conscious relation to the ﬁght for
peace, and insuﬂicient carrying through on the over-all fact that
peace is the central issue before the Negro people as it is before
every other section of our population.

I have a feeling of optimism seldom before felt, because of the
great number of remarkably ﬁne Negro comrades, theoretical and
political leaders and organizers, coming up in our Party. I know
that this Convention is going to give a real guarantee of reaching
rich, qualitatively high levels in the Negro liberation movement and
in the ﬁght for peace.

We have been thrown so many brickbats with respect to our
Party’s interest in the Negro liberation movement that I want to
take time out to read this ﬁnal quotation from the speech of Dr.
Mordecai Johnson at the C.I.O. convention. This speech was given
by the man at the head of Howard University, directly ﬁnanced by
the U.S. government. Dr. Johnson has more than once been a victim

22

 

 

of the efforts of the Un-American Committee, led by Rankin, to
kill off this university and get rid of its president and other progres-
sive forces. He made this speech before the C.I.O. convention, under
the glowering and hostile eyes of Murray and other labor traitors.
In the course of his speech he said many things with which we
might disagree, but he said other things which reﬂect the develop-
ment and maturity of the Negro masses all over this country. Among
these things, he said:

"At the basis of Communism there is this simple and passion-
ate belief: that the scientific and technical ‘intelligence which we
have at our disposal in the Western World and by means of
which the United States of America has been able to arrive at
a productive capacity of $250,000,000,000 a year, is an instru-
ment which, in the hands of men who love the human race, could
reorganize the entire economic structure of the ‘world so as to
overcome the worldwide struggle for existence and build up a
working population, regardless of race, creed or nationality, which
could feed and clothe and house its children without taking any-
thing by violence from any human ‘soul. . . . , 4

"Communism has its ﬁnger on the desire of men and it is say-
ing to men all over the world, we have come at last from the
ranks of those who suffer, not to make you rich, not to make you
powerful, not to place you in a position where you dominate
through life, but to ﬁx it so you can sit down with your brothers
of every race, creed and color all over this world and eat your
simple bread in brotherly peace and affection. . . 

This non-Communist Negro leader in a speech which contained
much Communists would disagree with but which described the
struggles of the oppressed and exploited in all corners of the globe
for freedom, equality and security, had this to say of the liberating
ideas of Communism which guide all freedom-striving peoples.

What more can I say to inspire all of us to build our great Com-
munist Party and the Maxist press in our country?

I. The Struggle for Peace and Its Relation to
the Negro Liberation Movement

The indivisibility of the struggle for peace and the struggle for
freedom—which takes its most basic form in our country in the
battle for Negro liberation—was always of major importance. It
began to take on ﬂesh and blood during the “cold war." But since
the American monopolists launched their gangster war against
Korea and China, this battle has become a matter of vital urgency
in the effort to halt the drive to fascism and another world war.

The new element in the relationship between the struggle for
peace and for Negro liberation is the growing? acuteness of the con-
tradiction between American imperialism and its war program on
the one hand, and, on the other, the struggle of the Negro people
and their supporters to defend their elementary liberties and to ad-
vance the cause of full citizenship. This is by far the most important
single new factor of the general political situation to be noted in con-
nection with the struggle for national liberation of the Negro people;

The prompt, skillful and bold seizing of this factor can advance
the whole cause of Negro rights and raise the American people's
struggle for peace to a new high level, nationally and internationally.

The case of Lieut. Gilbert, the mass frame-up of Negro soldiers
in Korea, the wanton police lynching of John Derrick, Negro vet-
eran, in Harlem, the brutal mistreatment of Negro inductees in the
segregated, Jim-Crow camps of the mainland—are the most spec-
tacular expressions of the contradiction between Wall Street’s war
program and the struggle of the Negro people for freedom and
dignity. These are also the most spectacular links between the
struggle for peace and the struggle for Negro rights.

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 

 

  

This contradiction has become so acute that even imperialism’s
Negro reformist agents have become impaled upon it, caught
between their subservience to the white capitalist warmongers and
their fear of the increasing militancy of the Negro people.

Hence the reformist national leaders of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, under ﬁre because of their
surrender of the ﬁght for civil rights to Truman’s war program,
were compelled by the militancy of their rank and ﬁle to dispatch
an attorney to Tokyo to defend the framed Negro soldiers.

This temporarily brought the _national oﬂice of the N.A.A.C.P.
into sharp clash with the chief spokesman of American imperialism
in the Far East, namely, butcher MarArthur. This arrogant repre-
sentative of the American monopolies issued an edict banning, not
a so-called Communist or Left-wing attorney‘ (with an “insolent,”
"unruly" devotion to the Bill of Rights), but a safe, decorous Negro
attorney who, fully sympathetic to Truman's war, wanted to say a
few timid words about the barbarous persecution of his brothers.
But "hard-hit American imperialism cannot take even such gestures
for Negro liberation, especially when they come at the point of
production of its wars of aggression!

The Pittrburgb C ourier, largest Negro reformist weekly, which
long ago battered its soul to the war-mongering white ruling class,
also reﬂects this sharpening contradiction. Its main editorial of
December 23, a classic of double-talk, declared for the ﬁrst time
since the Korean war: ‘

“The fact that the life of the nation. itself is in critical jeopardy
must have as ‘much meaning to Negro citizens as it does to all
segments "of the population. The Negro has not shared -fully in
thefruits of American democracy nor in the largesse of her na-
tural resources. In a very real sense, his citizenship rights have
been proscribed and he has been compelled to accept the crumbs
from the master’s table. Second-class citizenship and poverty
are his mecd.

“How many young Americans were ever’ consulted about
their desire to die in order to guarantee democracy for the South
Koreans? How many Americans were ever consulted to deter-

mine if they wished to foot the bill for such an enterprise?

"What are we doing in Asia? Why must we be there? Do the
people of Asia want us?.

“We don’t believe the Asians want us. We don’t think they’re
interested in our democracy or our way of life. We don't think
they like us. They look to our record of arrogance and exploita-
tion in the past and they have a feeling of hatred for us. This is
as true in Korea as in China.

"Only recently it was reported that Mao Tse-tung, the Chinese
Communist leader, might be willing to talk with the Western
powers if he were accepted as an equal. That is the point that
rankles in the breasts of Asiatics. They don’t trust us to treat
them as equals. We can’t eliminate this distrust by ﬁghting wars
in Asia and preaching democracy.

“We believe our government should find some way to get out
of Asia, including Japan, and leave Asia to the Asiatics.”

The vacillating Negro bourgeois reformists must quail before
the incessant pounding of the Negro workers .and masses for their
full liberation from such atrocities at the hands of the American
counterparts of the Prussian" master race, as have befallen their
sons, husbands and fathers in Korea.

Or take the exclamation of the distinguished Negro chemist, Dr.
Percy Julian, after the hoodlum bombings of his new home in
Chicago: “I'm going to stay right here. I’d just as soon die here
as in Korea!”.

All of this is but the reﬂection of the deeper and more mili-
tant stirrings of the Negro workers and masses, on every front,
where they defend their lives and liberties and seek to advance
their rights.

These expressions of the acute sharpening of the contradiction
between the war program of the American billionaires and the
struggle for Negro liberation can be duplicated on the fronts of
civil rights, police brutality and Klan terror, jobs, housing, health
and education——with Negro women and youth playing an ever
more important leading role. These struggles are taking on an
increasfngly distinct, though not yet conscious,'anti—imperialist char-

acter, and are hampering the war plans of the would-be dollar rulers

 

 
 

of the world. A
The principal lesson to be drawn from this new and sharpen-
ing element is that the Negro liberation movement is objectively a
movement for peace and against war, and that the working class
and all other peace forces must give the most determined and un-
compromising support to this movement in all of its aspects.

To win the Negro people——the Negro liberation movement-
as a conscious sector of the people’s coalition for peace, is a re-
sponsibility and opportunity that falls heaviest upon the advanced
white workers, trade unionists and peace forces. It is they who
must wage the struggle against the Right danger, against, the poison
of national and white chauvinism, which is spewed forth by a lily-
white ruling class at war with colored, colonial peoples.

Winning the Negro workers and masses for peace is not just
winning another section of the country’s population. It is mobiliz-
ing a people whose right to self-determination and nationhood
in the Black Belt, where they are a majority, is denied by the very
imperialism which is pretending to liberate another colored na-
tion from so-called “Communist tyranny.” We must expose this
pious fraud and ﬁnd the way of raising the timely world-wide de-
mand that the Wall Street liberators free the Negro nation im-
prisoned on the American mainland from the tightening reins
of pro-fascist oppression. Let them do this before they pretend to
ﬁght for the liberation of the Korean people!

It is the profound duty of the white trade unionists and peace
forces—in the vital self-interest of preventing another world war—
to support the national liberation struggles of the Negro people,
which are objectively anti-imperialist, even though they are neither
consciously anti-imperialist nor consciously anti-war. All-out support
and participation of the white workers in these movements is the
first pre-condition for helping them to become consciously anti-war
and consciously anti-monopoly. Such a participation is necessary for
advancing the cause of Negro rights and of advancingithe struggle
against fascism and war. ‘

First‘ among theidangers which have appeared to hamper these
objectives is the substitution ofisymbols, that is individual "Negro

leaders, for the involvement of the Negro workers and masses in

the peace movement. The second World Peace Congrss, even more

than the first, was featured by the brilliant, numerically large, and

signiﬁcant Negro participation, including outstanding professional

and middle class representatives. While the national character of

« the Negro liberation movement presents a rare opportunity for an

all-class people's peace movement, the principal new concentration

and involvement should be of the Negro workers and sharecroppers,

- who are feeling the heaviest blows of the imperialist war program
and who constitute the great majority of the Negro people.

Integration of distinguished individual Negro spokesmen for

peace~—and this needs to be done on a far wider scale—cannot

serve as a substitute for a grass roots peace movement, based upon

the Negro liberation struggles, and upon the growing leadership

of the Negro workers in that struggle. Otherwise, this becomes

a "Leftist" error, which leads to the same consequences as Right

opportunism—that is, white chauvinist contempt for the Negro

workers and masses. ; 
Such an error led to a major set-back] for the third-party peace
forces in the 1950 New York elections. Here the peace forces in- :_
tegrated into their ticket an internationally eminent Negro cham-
pion of peace. But these forces virtually detached themselves from
the new upsurge of the Negro liberation movement as such, and
dircted their main ﬁre in "Leftist” fashion against a community
* ﬁgure who had not yet exhausted his reserve among the Negro
masses who still saw him as a militant spokesman for F.E.P.C. and 
Negro rights. Consequently, the electoral instrument of the peace
‘ camp was unable to reﬂect either the national aspirations of the
Negro people or their deep desire for peace. ,
The second main danger to assuring the fullest support of the
Negro liberation movement by the working class beginning with
the Left trade unions, and other peace forces, is a mechanical appli-
cation of the sound Leninist theory that theworking class must 
lead the Negro liberation movement. In practice this has amounted '
to holding back the, Negro liberation movement to the level of
the most backward sections of the white workers. This has nothing
in common with the Leninist concept of national and colonial lib-

Our Party must overcome a certain sluggishness in grasping the

struggles. A beginning. has been made with the development of
the ‘civilian campaign for the freedom of Lieutenant Gilbert, for

dread of the struggle for Negro liberation.
