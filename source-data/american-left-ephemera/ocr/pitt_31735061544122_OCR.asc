SOCIALIST PARTY LEAFLET,.No. 4.

IIOW SOCIALISTS ORGANIZED
THE UNIONS IN GERMANY.

By ROBERT HUNTER. _

Unfortunately it takes time. for zealous, vigorous minds to
battle FOR two big ideas at once. a

The German working class movement began as a political
movement. [The working class leaders were chieﬂy political
leaders.

They felt at ﬁrst that unions were of quite minor importance.
They proceeded then with enormous energy, ability and devotion
to build up the purest, greatest and mostipowerful political move-
ment in the world.

And anyone who knows Germany today knows the marvel-
ous inﬂuence that political movement has had.

IT HAS IMPROVED THE CONDITION OF THE
WORKERS; FOUGHT THEIR BATTLES; OBTAINED
FOR THEM IMPORTANT ‘ REFORMS,_ AND DONE A
GREAT AND CREDITABLE WORK. I

  

Again and again the So-cialist party declared that all its
members should join the unions of their respective trades, and
if no union existed they should create one.

Again and again all the energy, ability and power of the
party has gone into the work of Trade Union organization.

It was not, however, until 1895 that the Trade Unions of
Germany began to make notable progress, but within fourteen

 

years they have marched onward with immense strides until to— .

day their membership is 2,000,000.
The ﬁgures, as published by the Bulletin of the Department
of Labor of New York, are as follows: V

The German working class has developed two powerful
weapons, a Trade Union movement and a Socialist movement.

THE TRADE UNIONS DO THEIR WORK ON THEIR
OWN LINES. THE SOCIALIST PARTY DOES ITS WORK
ON ITS OWN LINES, BUT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE
UNIONS AND OF THE PARTY IS MADE UP PRACTI-
CALLY OF THE SAME MEN.

 

 

The old German Socialists understand the value of an indus-
trial movement. The Trade Unionists understand the value of a
political movement.

But when the Socialists of Germany saw the need of an in-
dustrial movement they set out to make one, and in recent years
they have advanced to the position of the most powerful Trade
Union movement in the world. ‘

The Trade Unionists of America still scoff at political activ-A

ity. They will ﬁght Socialism. They refuse to be “visionaries
and fanatics,” and SO LEAVE THE AMERICAN WORKER
POLITICALLY HELPLESS. ,
Today in Germany the Socialists have a Trade Union move-
ment numbering 2,000,000 men. They have also a political

0 movement that musters over 3,250,000 votes.

The American Federation of Labor has a membership of
1,586,000 men and NO POLITICAL MOVEMENT.

Yet the American movement considers itself practical, con-
gratulates itself for being free from visions, fantasy and fanata-

‘cism.

German Socialists may be visionaries and fanatics, but they
HAVE over 3,000,000 men ﬁghting-for their political rights and
nearly 2,000,000 men ﬁghting for their economic rights.
