‘But that is merely a part, and not the greatest part

at that, of the monstrous betrayal of the interests of the
nations perpetrated by fascism. Under the yoke of fascism
the nations wither and fall into a fearful state of decay. .
German fascism has occupied Austria and dismembered Czecho-
slovakia; it has increased the territory and the popula~
tion of the German Empire. Germany appears to have grown
in extent, as the obese increase in girth, but in the
bloated body the life of the German nation is being
smothered. Each new conquest is a new heavy burden on the
German people. Each new conquest brought in its train
increased oppression, lengthened hours of labor, more
intense speed-up, increased compulsory "donations" for the
Nazi funds, etc., and a strengthening of the state machin-
ery of coercion. With the increasing compass of the Ger—
man Reich we see increasing the”extent of the slavery,

by fascist tyranny.

Gneisenau, one of those who roused the German nation
to the struggle against the alien rule of Napoleon, wrote
in his essay "The Freedom of the Rear": "Every nation
must honor itself and should not tolerate in its midst_
conditions which degrade it in the eyes of other nations."
Fascism is a system of conditions which not only degrade
the German nation in the eyes of other peoples but which
also in actual fact induce a progressive decay, an alarm~
ing degeneration and destruction of the German nation
itself.

This degeneration and destruction of the nation through

fascism become most obvious if one calls to mind the revo-

III. The Birth Of Modern Nations

The nations of our time are the offspring of the bour-
geois revolution. Their coming into being was, of course,
not a single act but the result of a lengthy historical
process. The development of the nation was at the same
time the development of democracy, of the_self-determina-
tion of the people. The complete amalgamation of various

= es’and*nationalities into a nation is effectedioniyol
The
dominant forces of medieval feudal society, nobility,
church and crown, are super-national and anti-national.
The struggles of the urban burghers and the peasants

against the feudal lords were the first national movementsi

It is from these movements that a united speech of the
people developed out of the local dialects in opposition
to the Latin of the church. It is from these movements
that we see emerging the idea of a democratic alliance of
various cities and provinces against their feudal oppres-
sors and frequently also against an alien domination.
These movements raised ever louder the demand for a com-

*mon law, for a uniform taxation, for a strong central

power which was to put an end to the intolerable privi-
leges of the feudal oppressors.
contemporary nations were laid in the struggle for thee
democratic liberties of the people. Unity of the people
against its oppressors - such is the vital principle of
every nation. '

It was only the development of capitalism which, of
necessity, brought about also the possibility of the
amalgamation of the mass of the people into a nation.
Rising capitalism was a mighty revolutionary force. It
burst the narrow bounds of the cities and provinces. It
shook the customs barriers, it undermined the special‘
privileges, arbitrary taxation, all the warren rights,

tel’ ’.‘._' _

France was the country in which a nation was developed
earlier and in clearer shape than in many other countries.
The development of the French nation was favored by a
variety of circumstances; by the natural resources of the
land, by its advantageous geographic position, by the par-
tial preservation of Roman culture in the Middle Ages, by
the early inception of centralization, by the alliance
between the crown and the urban bourgeoisie, etc.. The line
of historical progress in France is not so tangled and.
irregular as in Germany for instance. Hence it is expedi-
ent to demonstrate the general development by the example _
of France. The laws of social development, which are valid
everywhere, have found a particularly rich and instructive
expression in France.

Despite the relatively high degree of centralization
and despite the relatively advanced development of capitalé
ism, pre-revolutionary France was very far from being a
united entity. Though national development was compara-
tively advanced, there was yet no French nation in the
proper sense of the word. Mirabeau described the France
of Louis XVI not without justification as a "formless heap
of disunited people."

The frontiers of France were not defined. German
princes and bishops exercised their feudal rights in J
French territory. More than onewlocality was subject to _ ,
several feudal lords at the same time: to the French king,
to the German emperor and to some great nobleman on top of
that. Many provinces such as Provence, the Dauphine, the

own fate, turned from an object into an active and ruling
subject of politics. Thus and in no other way did the
spokesmen of the French revolution regerﬂ the nation.
Robespierre expressed this idea eleerly in the discussion
on the constitution on eeteher 22,’l?89,‘ehen he said:

"The eonstitutieh lays ﬂown that-the sovereignty of
the people ﬁwel1eTih'ever§ single inﬁividual belonging
to the people;'vEvery single inﬁivideel hes the right
therefore to eeepeeetevih.fheming the lee which binds

.him and in the aeministhatieh of the public cause which

is his own. ~If that is net so then it is not true that-
all men are equal in right, that all men are citizens.“

The suhjest_ie transfermed into the eitisen and it is
only thereby thet_the people is threes into a nation.
This conception wee elreeﬁy eontsinee in the introductory
remarks in the eemp1eint‘heok of the eity of Paris; they
say: , . ~» in M .

to chauvinism with which the imperialist gangsters inspire

conception that it was possible to "grow into" socialism
within the bourgeois state, that the working class need
not smash the old state machine but could gradually‘
take it over led to terrible reverses of the working
class movement. This conception was carried into the
ranks of the working class movement by agents of the
bourgeoisie. Sections of the working class were cor-
rupted. Especially in the advanced capitalist coun-
tries a labor aristocracy was born which came to terms
with the bourgeoisie, which did not give a lead to the
people but trotted along in the wake of the ruling
class._ This petty-bourgeois oppnrtunism was accom-
panied by narrow craft prejudices. The representatives
of the labor aristocracy left the political leadership
to the bourgeoisie, took no notice of the claims of the
peasants, of the urban middle classes, of the whole
working population and regarded as their task merely the
defense of the economic interests of the working class
within the bounds of bourgeois-dapitalist society. They
came more and more under the influence of bourgeois na-

people constituted themeelvee e nation under contradic-
tory and eonfueed hietorieel eenﬁitione and did so much
later than other peoples. At all decisive points in its
national development it wee reaction and not revolution
that gained the upper hand in Germany. Every time the
German people were confronted with vital issues of na-

tionhood they fell under the influence of reaction, af-
ter a transitory revolutionary upsurge. Hence, they tra-

versed a wrong path, the path of "national misfortune"

leading to catastrophe. People who today ask how it was
possible for a nation that gave the world Goethe and
Heine, Marx and Engels, to sink so low in Hitler barbar-
ism must take note of these fatal winding paths of Ger-
man history. But it is a thousand times more important
that the German nation itself see the fatal errors of
its historical development and realize that again, for
the last time, and for what may be a long period, it
stands at historical crossroads.

On November 9, 1941, Goebbels spoke of the German
nation's most decisive and last chance. But we must
say - and in quite a different sense than that implied

.by this fascist monger of vileness and diabolical lies

— that the German nation is now presented with the very
greatest and, as far as can historically be foreseen,
perhaps the very last chance of casting off the yoke of
reaction and, by exerting its every effort, of trans-

'forming the other Germany, a Germany of liberty and

progress and of constructive self—determination of the
people from a possibility into a reality.

In the preface to his masterly work on the history of
the peasant war in Germany, Friedrich Engels wrote,
“The German people have also their revolutionary tradi-
tion." This "also" epitomizes the whole tragedy of
German historic development. The gigantic armed rebel-
lion of the German peasants in the first half of the
sixteenth century was unsuccessful and ended in defeat.
The political program of the most progressive and con-
scientious leaders of the peasantry — Thomas Muenzer,
Wendel Hipler and Michael Geismaier - demanded unifica-
tion of all German lands and states under one central-
ized power, the overcoming of their feudal acatteredness
and anarchy. Betrayed by their central imperial govern-
ment, ahandoned,to its fate by_the town hnrghers, hunted
down by Catholic and Protestant Church Princes, this
huge peasant revolution collapsed. From the epoch Of
reformation, which Engels called the "national misfor-

The rise of the Prussian rdbber state with its
- -43-

whip of discipline, of hard labor and prison, with its
bully Junkerdom and militarism, which like a cancerous
ulcer destroyed all the vitality of the nation, became
Germany's new national misfortune.\ Leasing, the great’
German humanist, condemned Prussia as the most slavish
state in Europe. One of Germany's finest patriots, the
nobleman von Stein, who proclaimed a national liberation
war against Napoleon. branded the Prussian Junkers as
"antedeluvian creatures."

The Prussian military state grew up in a struggle a—
gainst Germany and at the expense of Germany. Friedrich

II rented his sword first to France and then to England.‘Wa$

He used every means and method to fortify the privileges
of the Junkers and officers against the burghers. It
was he who set forth all the principles" of the notori-
ous Prussian discipline in a brief formula: "the soldier
must‘fear his officer more than the enemy." The vaunted
army of this adventurer king, pride of the Prussians and
object of Europe's undivided hatred, was shattered to
pieces when at Auerstadt it first came into contact with
the non—serf army - Napoleon's army. ' .

Friedrich's spirit was smashed at Jena and Auerstadt
by the influence of the new epoch, the epoch of bour-
geois revolution. The spirit of the new epoch found its
way into Germany and inspired the works of German human-
ists and German philosophers. Lessing and Herder, Kant
and Hegel, Goethe and Schiller — they constituted the
great dawn of another Germany. In the midst of Prussian
sergeant majors and executioners, faced'with feudal. I
tyranny and provicial burgherdom, they expressed in
their works the great Germany of progress and human dig-
nity. German humanism and German philosophy did not ori-
ginate on the basis of the national state nor on the
basis of a society encompassing.the whole nation; It
sprang from a distorted political purpose. The great
German thinkers and writers sought to escape from German
‘national misfortune," from the chaotic and seemingly
hopeless policy of niggardly shortsightedness, into the
realm of ‘pure reason and ‘pure art;" ‘They visualized

German unity as the aim of their creative work, but they

particular. They were the initiators of the struggle
for the liberty, progress and culture of the German
people and the greatest champions of that struggle. They
championed the cause of the truly greater Germany. Nor

is it accidental that these outstanding champions of Ger-'

man salvation and its future had to live in exile and
their voice of enlightenment and warning could reac
Germany only from afar. -

In England and France the maturing problems of na-
tional and social development were solved by the hour-
geois-democratic revolution. In Germany they were solved
by reaction.‘ Every revolutionary democratic upsurge of
the German people has had its bitter reactionary after-
math. The first upsurge of this kind since the days of
the great peasant war of 1525 was the liberation war
against Napoleon in 1809 — 1815. This struggle was fet-
tered by the existence of numerous scattered tiny midget
—states and cities, deep seated prejudices and hypocriti-
cal romanticism, by the immaturity and backwardness of
the German bourgeoisie. And it resulted not even in a
half victory for the people, but in a nightmarish "holy
alliance" - the most oppressing and unbearable forebear
of the present Nazi reaction. The "German alliance" was
a mongrel, an insult and humiliation of the finest hopes
of the German patriots, who longed to see unity of the
German nation grow out of the liberation struggle against
But German unity remained a dream while a con-
stant and furious struggle between Prussia and Austria
in Central Europe became a reality.

The Hapshurgs and Hohenzollerns could see eye to eye
only on one question - the persecution of the German pa-
triots. The bourgeois-democratic revolution was irresist-
ibly maturing in Germany in the forties of the last cen-
tury. The development of modern industry and trade and
the growth of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat cut a
path through the case-hardened craft spirit, tariff bar-
riers and parcelized state organisms. And then, in 1848,
the people arose to destroy the bonds of this state par-
celization and put an end to political oppression. They
wanted to throw out the rotten corpse of medievalism to-

, gather with all its attributes — heraldic emblems, knng’s
} mantle, Junkerdom and the caste spirit. This revolution
3 failed because of the apprehension of the bourgeoisie at
the social demands of the "fourth estate" — the rising
proletariat. It failed because of cowardice, half-

‘ heartedness and lack of resolution on the part of the5
petty bourgeoisie, which shuddered at its own_"audacity."

The conditions of the bourgeois—democratic revolution
in Germany were extremely complicated and contradictory.
There was the time—honored political routine on the one
hand, and the beginning of the class struggle between ,
the bourgeoisie and proletariat already developing within
the shell of the semi-feudal society on the other. Ger-
man capitalism is younger than that of other European
countries. But it even then exhibited senile reactionary
features. It regarded the proletariat as its mortal ene~
my and maintained family relations with the old feudal
aristocracy. The result of this struggle was the betray¥
al by the bourgeoisie of its own revolution. The hour-
geoisie fell to its knees before the King of Prussia,
whom they humbly petitioned to take over the direction of
the revolution and to generously deign to accept the
ﬁg crown of the German empire. '

 

J The Communists Marx and Engels and their small band of
" followers were the only consistent democrats, the only
conscientious and unswerving champions of the bourgeois-
»; democratic republic. The German bourgeoisie regarded the
g; bourgeois-democratic revolution as an accidental mis-
carriage. And no wonder that German bourgeois historians
, styled 1848 as a "year of madness," depicting it as an

Ag exaggeration which, "thank God," had no repercussions.
mg Germany was united not by revolution but by the Erussian

sword.

when the king of Prussia in l866.galloped over the

battlefield at Koeniggratz he remembered the "year of
madness" and said with a sigh of relief, "Now this is a

real king's gallop.”

We can observe the same development in all countries.
In the struggle against fascist imperialism and its reac-
tionary acﬁomplices the working class and its Communist
Party are the only consistent defenders of national.in-

‘dependence. The modern nations were born in the process of’

the bourgeois revolution. The reactionary bourgeoisie is
betraying the national interests together with the whole
heritage of the bourgeois revolution. It is the working
class and its Communist Party which take over the legacies
of the bourgeois revolution, maintain them against the
traitors and develop them to a richer, fuller life. It is
not a new "tactic" which we see reflected in the relations

of the working class to the nation but a historical develop-

ment.

 

‘Three years ago Comrade Dimitroff told the delegates to
the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International:

"...We are concerned with every important question, not

only of the present and the future, but also of the past of

our own peoples. We Communists do not pursue a narrow policy

based on the craft interests of the workers. We are not
narrow—minded trade union functionaries, or leaders of me-

.dieval guilds of handcraftsmen and journeyman. We are the
»representatives of the class interests of the most impor-

tant, the greatest class of modern society — the working
class, to whose destiny it falls to free mankind from the
sufferings of the capitalist system, the class which in
one-sixth of the world has already cast off the yoke of
capitalism and constitutes the ruling class..... *

"We Communists are the irreconcilable opponents, on prin-

ciple, of bourgeois nationalism in all its forms. But we are
not supporters of national nihilism, and should never act as

such.....

"It goes without saying that it is necessary everywhere,
and on all occasions to expose before the masses and prove

in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, spectators were"

dazzled by the brilliance of the uniforms and decortations,

but the German people were absent. Bismarck was the sole
"civilian" in this background of militaristic-display
when the empire was being formed. And accordingly he was
looked upon with disparagement, Germany was here annexed
to Prussia and thus there came into being, to use Engels’
apt expression, "a German'empire of the Prussian nation."
There is no doubt that even this German unity was histor-
ically progressive. But what a terrific price was paid
for this progress! National traditions of the German
people, not based on any revolutionary experience, were\
historically interwoven with reaction, militarism and
predatory wars. The new national state made for a rapid
development of industry and capitalism. State unity re-
leased tremendous productive forces. The German working
class grew at a rapid pace, winning its place in the so-
cial life. Marx and Engels armed it with the epoch-mak-
ing ideal of scientific socialism. 7But at the same time
the German working class was influenced by the reaction-
ary traditions of the German nation. Lassalle - that
shadow of Bismarck in the German labor movement - was but
the first forerunner of the notorious "national social-
ism," and his ideological influence was never completely
overcome by Marxism. Even such-a profound Marxian
scholar as Franz Mehring did not appreciate the great
significance of the struggle which Marx and Engels waged
against Lassalle. Mehring even tried to "restore the
honor" of Lassalle, considering it possible to form

some "synthesis" of Marx and Lassalle.

Reformism within the German labor movement deliberate-
ly clung to Lassalle and made of this Prussian national-
ist its idol. But if the working class was not in a
position to rid itself fully of reactionary traditions
in German_history, the situation was many times worse
with regard to the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie.
The German petty bourgeoisie could not look back to any
great revolution. It had neither its Rousseau nor its
Robespicrre. For it the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles

with its brilliant display of martial splendor was the
apex, the zenith of national history.

this chance too was passed by. Once more the destinies of
the German people were in the clutches of reaction; The
victory or defeat of the 1918 revolution should have for a
predictable political period decided the fate not only of
the working class of Germany but of the whole German na-
tion. A victorious revolution would have spelled Germany's

‘shouldered tremendous historical responsibilities when, in

the struggle against revolution, they sided with the

of big landed estates and the power of the Prussian Jun-

‘the Krupps and Thyssens, those who were to blame for the
crime of the World War.‘ They called all the officers and
generals of the old army to their aid in order to crush

the revolution.

From the very first day reaction could install itself

tragedy for Germany. The way was now finally cleared for
German imperialism to solve German problems after its own
fashion - by a sanguinary war for world domination. On
the whole, the empire policy of the leading cliques of"
German imperialism was nothing but a systematic prepara-
tion for war. German finance capital, centered in a nar-
years developed the concen-
tration of industry and capital to an incredible degree.
Tremendous war potentials were merged. With the help of
foreign loans and at the expense of the working people of
Germany there was created a powerful, technically well
equipped, industrial apparatus. Exploitation of the work-
ers was constantly being intensified.

The world economic crisis which broke out in 1929
brougat social tension to an extreme limit. It had a
particular effect on Germany, with her high concentration
of capital. The horrible impoverishment of the masses as
wel as the development of the class consciousness of the
German workers created favorable prerequisites for a new
revolutionary upsurge. The German imperialists felt the
ground burning under their feet. Resorting to brutal
terror and incredible demagogy, they set about establish-
ing a relentless terrorist dictatorship._ Their plans
were aided by several factors. ‘One of these was the pol-
icy of sbeial-Democracy, which was repelling the petty-
bourgeois sections of the people. Split and undermined
by internal strife, the working class possessed only a
limited power of attraction for other sections of the
toiling people._ Millions of peasants, civil servants,
office employees and intellectuals looked into empty
space.

Catastrophic unemployment was demoralizing a part of

The German nation has traversed a fatal historical path
— a path leading from reaction to reaction and from catas-
trophe to catastrophe. It should now be clear what a hell
of suffering, horror and dishonor reaction holds for it.
Its fatal double has appeared in his last touch of fascist
tyranny. It is time, high time, to inflict a mortal blow
on this double and bring into historical realities the

of Marx and Engels, the Germany of liberty and peace..The‘
German nation has a great chance - but for a long time to
come the last chance - of redeeming the.crimes and dis~

and by real national action, of ending the war by over-
throwing the Nazi band and re—establishing the.trust of
other nations. . —

THE NAZI IMPERIALLSTS' EATIONAL MASK

By Peter Wieden
April, 1942

"Adolph Hitler and his gang of murderers, incendiaries
and highway robbers call themselves "National—Social— '
ists."' They dare to speak in the name of the German na-
tion and hope to justify their crimes by asserting that
they, the German fascists, serve the interests of Germany
while the misdeeds they commit correspond to the interests
of the German people. 'But is it true that these xecu~
tioners, these enemies of humanity, are inspired by the
desire to.serve the German nation? Is it true that all
their atrocities, perfidy and cowardly murders are dicta~
ted by motives of national interest? Is it true that
,their policy of subjugating other nations and of war
without end is a national policy? Stalin, in his histor-
ic speech of November 6, gave a clear and Castigating
reply. He said:

"Can the Hitlerites he considered nationalists? Actu-
ally, the Hitlerites today are not nationalists but im-
perialists. While the Hitlerites were uniting German
lands and incorporating the Rhine region, Austria, etc.,
they could in a certain sense he considered nationalists.
But after they captured foreign territories and enslaved
European nations - the Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Norwegians,
Danes, Dutch, Belgians, Frenchmen, Serbs, Greeks,
Ukrainians, Byelorussians, and the Baltic peoples, etc. —
and began to drive for world domination, the Hitler party
ceased to be nationalist, for from that moment it became
a party of imperialism, conquest and oppression."

Hitler's whole policy is one long chain of crimes
which tend to push the German nation ever nearer to an
abyss. But how could it come about that this path of
the German fascists, this policy of national suicide
was not curbed by popular insurrection? How could it
happen that over a course of years this policy met with
the support of considerable sections of Germany's popu-
lation? Hitler understood that the strongest and most

\

 

     

daggerous poison had to be used to stun and enyenom the
German nation._ He himself defined the aim of his agita-
tion as "helping to make them_die." sThe poison which he
first of all used against the German nation was lies
about Versailles, lies about "lebensraum" and lies about
racial_superiority.

It was Soviet Russia which from the very first day took
a stand against Versailles, and not Italy and Japan, who
hear the full share of responsibility for the Versailles
Treaty. , ~ ’

In all countries the Communists waged a tenacious and
persistent struggle against the Versailles Treaty. The‘ _
Communists branded the_Versailles Treaty as violence ’ ’
against the right of nations to self-determination.

The German fascists denounced Versailles not out of
any principle. In their View the mistake was only that y
it was not Germany which imposed on other nations such a
peace treaty but that other nations dictated it to Ger-
many. In that vile book of his, "Mein Kampf," Hitler
already said that it was not at all a question of repeal-"
ing the Versailles Treaty but of
conquering new territories, making Germany the master of
Europe, converting her into the sole military force on
the continent. Hitler and his party were out to use the
German people's national indignation against the Vere
sailles Treaty to.prepare a predatory imperialist war of
conquest. —

Lies about the Versailles Treaty spread by the whole
German reaction and primarily by Hitler and his gang were
built up on the most brazen forgery of historic truth.
The Hitlerites maintained that Germany's national catas-
trophe began only in November, 1918. .But is that true?
No, it is a lie. Germany's national catastrophe began
on the day when the German imperialists took arms in
order to force a new redivision of the world. The war in
itself was a national catastrophe, a senseless squander-
ing of the wealth and blood of the German nation. And

this catastrophe was carried to the extreme when Germany's

coal barons to build up enormous heavy industry and fa-
cilitated an unprecedented concentration of capital and
economic power in the hands of a few. In actual fact,
already at that time there was set up that colossal in-
dustry which later enabled Hitler rapidly to effect Ger-
many's rearmament. '

The German imperialists had, therefore, no grounds to
be dissatisfied with this financial mechanism of the Ver-
sailles system. But the German people were compelled to
bear bitter suffering under the yoke of this Versailles_
mechanism, which was incomprehensible to them.
workers and office employees, peasants and handicraftsmen
believed it was France, England and America who were
fleecing them. But in reality the German people were
being robbed by their own German capitalists, who were
constantly pointing to the Versailles_Treaty. Had the
German people smashed this Versailles at home, the foreign
Versailles would have looked different too.

But Hitler and his “National-Socialists“ regarded it as
their particular aim to make this home Versaille safe for»
the German imperialists and expand it to the limit. During

__the struggle over the Ruhr, Hitler ordered his gangs to

take no part in the popular resistance to occupation and.
concentrate all forces on the struggle against German
democracy. When Germany was in turmoil over the question
of compensating the princes Hitler ordered his subordi-
nates to support this disgraceful tribute by the German
people to.the Hohenzollerns and Wittelsbachers. Hitler"
called not for struggle against the German imperialists,
who were unscrupulously piling up profits through Ver- ‘
sailles, but preached "people's communion" with these E
parasitic stranglers of the German people. Lastly, Hitler
replaced the Weimar Republic with a system which gives

‘the people no rights whatsoever and places full domination
win the hands of a clique of imperialist desperadoes.

Is it
true that the new World War was necessary to obliterate
the Versailles Treaty and that Hitler is waging a war to
repeal it? No, this is a lie.

What did the invasion of Prague, the dismemberment of

Czechoslovakia and the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia
have to do with the repeal of the Versailles Treaty? And
the seizure of Norway, Belgium, Holland, the shameful at-

'tack on Yugoslavia and Greece, on the people who so hero-

ically defended their independence - who wbuld dare to
depict these sanguinary and piratical attacks as a just
national war or a national struggle of the German people?
Finally, the most criminal and treacherous attack on the
Soviet Union, which always rejected the Versailles Treaty,
the Soviet Union_whose interests never and nowhere clashed
with the national interests of Germany - what justifica—.

. tion can be found for this foul predatory war?

No, the German fascists were not out to repeal the Ver-
sailles Treaty. Their aim was to thrust.on all other peo-
ple the yoke of enslavement compared with which the Ver%
sailles burden would be mere child's play. From the very
outset their policy was not national but predatory, impe-
rialist and anti-national.

The further Hitler progressed from preparing the war to
actual operation of his robber plans of conquest, the more
his lying demagogy about the Versailles Treaty gave way
to equally lying demagogy about "lebensraum." In their
criminal war against the Soviet Union, Hitler could no
longer fall back on the Versailles propaganda. Here,
Hitler resorted to his
lies about lebensraum. The German people, the Nazis,
falsely assert, are "a people without room." The Germans,
they say, have too little territory, are crowded and con-
gested and therefore.poverty—stricken.

The Americans and British and other peoples live well,
Hitler never tired of repeating, because thay have more
zerritory per capita and the density of their population
But according to
his so—called argumentation it would appear that those
soples live better who are lost among vast expanses while
ﬁtions who have a higher density of labor power per

uare mile are worse off. But then you cannot catch the

all, they are least of all inclined to come into possession
of unpopulatee lebehsraum. By no means; they require pop-

otherwise, where would they pocure slave labor power?

Ever since Denmark and Holland became part of Hitler's
lebensraum, the Germans have retained only the memory of
Dutch and Danish dairy products. Ever since the Nazis

occupied the big aggrarian countries the German peasant
has had no fodder.or grain seed. ‘

Evidently-the old world trade was far more beneficial
than the new lebensraum. .The German people are today
receiving that ghastly object lesson that nothing is so
costly as the conquest of lebensraum. Hitler enticed the
German people with lebensraum in the east. But millions
have paid with their lives and many millions more have
been crippled so that the Germany army could temporarily
seize scorched ruins and factories without machines, and
fields without_tractors. But is Germany really so poor

that she is able to pay only with blood for the raw
materials she needs? ’ , ’

and foodstuffs.
"beyond the reach"=
of “poor” Germany. But then Germany not only imported
but exported as well. She paid for imported raw materials
and foodstuffs not in gold but by exporting other goods.
But even if Germany were to stop all exports the money
spent on the war so far would suffice to cover imports for
a good eighty years. And if the former volume of export
were maintained it would suffice probably for a whole
century.

But Hitler has fleeced the German people of all their

'ariches in order to conquer a lebensraum which turned out
. cto be but an immense graveyard for Germany.

the whole German people lebensraum means a free Germany
which by its achievements, progress and peaceful competi-
tion with other nations will win a place of honor. In
this lebensraum lies the future of the German nation. But
the imperialist lebensraum which Hitler uses to deceive‘
the German people means war, poverty, disgrace and de-
cline.

The German fascists seek to substantiate their claims g
to foreigh lebensraum by the lie of alleged German "racial ?
superiority” over all other nations. The Germans, Hitler '3
says, are'destined by very "Providence" to rule over "low- W
er and inferior" races. This, Hitler says, is a "histori- "”“?
cal law" and this law not only gives Germany claims to
world domination but makes eternal war of conquest the
calling of the German nation.

This rough and ready race theory, which was always the
favorite among the imperialists, the Nazis have stretched
to extremes of bestiality. There are, of course, differ-
ent human races. But what distinguished one race from
:another is a question that puzzles all students of race

1 dave chosen the simplest course. Race distinctions, they

§ound not only among all human races but among certain

types of chimpanzees as well. There remains, therefore,
L the "race soul," which does not lend itself to any scien-
1 tific research whatsoever and can be understood only with
I the help of the notorious "intuition" of_the German
: gascists.

 

C‘ With the brazenness and barbarian disregard for science 5
typical of them, the Hitlerites would have us believe i
’,at the entire historical development is determined by
1% victory of "superior" races over "inferior," the vic-
t°°y of "pure" race blood over "impure."

Is there anything like a "pure" race at all possible
among the present nations? The Eskimos perhaps are to
some extent the “purest” of all races, but European races
without exception originated.from the most variegated mix-

  
 
 
 
 

tions and races same to the;fore in different'eras. The

Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, Assyrians were the bearers of
high culture at Egtiﬁﬁ when*thejGennans,.who are supposed

empire they eould by no means he*regeTded as promoters of
human progress; only nuch later did the Germans enter the

ranks of the_gheat enltnred peoples; .-

  
  
  
  
 

But even in the middle ages the Italians, French and
Spaniards were et_an¥ sate equal to the Germans in cul—
tural attainments and surpassed them in several respects.
In modern times the Eng1ish:and,Freﬁ@h were responsible '

What is the enplenetion of the constant change, this
advance of one and than another nation? The fascist racep
theory provides no answer to thie.s But there is a clear_j
answer if we examine the reel oauses and driving forces o

'over'Alsace—Lorraine to Hitler and

And now Chamberlain and Daladier have "ceded" the great-
er part of Czechoslovakia to Hitler Germany, Poland and
Hungary and have given up the rest to German domination.
That matters would not rest there has already been an-
nounced: the four plotters of Munich would like to allot
themselves the powers of a board of directors over all '
Europe, of a board of directors who buy and sell nations.
as if they were parcels of shares, and who regard'nationss
merely as attributes of some territory which is bought and
sold wholesale or retail. In the eighteenth century thef
German princes sent out their press gangs to hunt men and
then sold the unhappy captives as "human goods" to the.
highest bidder; the trade in men carried on by Chamberlain
and Daladier is even more extensive and horrible - they
deliver up whole nations to the knife. V I "

The reactionary conspiracy is directed not only against»
the independence and right of self-determination of the
small nations but also against the great nations.whoseA
spokesmen Hitler and Mussolini, Chamberlain and Daladier
claim to be. Fundamental interests of the Frenchination.
were sacrificed in Munich. The.men of the French revolu-
tion would turn in their graves if they knew how cavalier-
ly their epigoni treat the reputation and security of
France. With Czechoslovakia France gave up not only her
most faithful ally in Europe but also lost for a consider-
able time to come the possibility of gaining the confidence
of any state. The Czech legionnaires who publicly consign-
ed their French war decorations to the garbage-bin only exe
pressed in a drastic form what the small nations of Europe
.felt towards this French government.‘ And,as if that were
not enough, Daladier hurries to hand over the Pyrenees to
the German.and Italian Fascists and thus draws the.noose}
tighter around the neck of the French nation. ' ‘

Will the French bourgeoisie be also prepared to hand
Savoy to‘Mussolini if
the fascist dictators demand it?" The dictators will cer-
tainly make such demands if France is not strong and if the
united French nation does not face squarely up to the fas-
cist blackmailers and the reactionary traitors. But it was
.not only the interests of the French people which were sac-
