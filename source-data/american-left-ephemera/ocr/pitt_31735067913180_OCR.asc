WASHINGTON, D.C.—Two court actions in November——one by the U.S. Supreme
Court, the other by the Federal Court of Appeals here—-are important steps on the
lengthy road to complete vindication of Mine-Mill and of six past and present union
officers from charges involving Communist influence.

On Nov. 15, the Supreme Court agreed to review the convictions of the six indi-
viduals on the charge of conspiracy to defraud the government by filing false non-
Communist affidavits with the National Labor Relations Board. Three issues raised by
the defendants will be heard by the court—-the insufficiency of the indictment itself;

-the constitutionality of Section
'9(h) of the Taft-Hartley Act,
which‘ required the filing of the
affidavits; and the denial of ac-
cess by the defense to Grand
Jury testimony of prosecution
witnesses.

, Evidence "Shale"

Earlier in the month, on Nov.
1, the Federal Court of Appeals
had ordered that the Subversive

Activities Control Board case
against the union be sent back.

to the board because the evi-
dence in the case was “stale.”

"The SACB, in May, 1962, had
ordered Mine - Mill to register
with the attorney general as a
“Communist - inﬁltrated organi-
zation,” but the. union appealed
the order. The Supreme Court
earlier this year said, in two
other cases, that decisions of
the SACB must be based on cur-
rent evidence. The Court of Ap-
peals, in the union’s case, found
"that the evidence, most of which
’went back more than 15 or 20
years", was out of date.

The Taft-I-Iartley “conspiracy”
inthe case that the Supreme
,Court has now agreed to hear is
‘alleged’ to C:-have been‘ hatched

 
 

F iurteen defendants were in-

. 0:‘.-L/cted in 1956 and nine of 11 men

who stood trial in 1959 during
the midst of a bitter nationwide
strike againstthe country’s cop-
per , producers were convicted,
but on appeal those convictions
were reversed for a new trial
because of prejudicial hearsay
testimony allowed at the trial,
and the case against two of the
defendants was dismissed en-
.tirely. On retrial in 1963, six of
s e V e n remaining defendants
were convicted.

Impressive Support
The legal steps to reverse the
convictions engendered impres-
sive and broad support through-

 .---out the country for .the defend-

ants, and, in- September of this
year, the American Civil Liber-
ties Union, the National Farm-
pers Union, .the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers, the Amalga-
mated Meat Cutters, the Ameri-

can Federation of Teachers, the

International Typographical Un-
ion, the ’l‘ransport Workers Un.

ion, the United Automobile
Workers Union, and the United
Packinghouse Workers filed a
“friend - of - the - court” brief in
their behalf with the Supreme
Court. 1 y _
Noting that the vague concept
of “conspiracy” has often been
-used to harass labor unions and
block their organizing activity,
the brief challenged the consti-
tutionality of the affidavit pro-
vision, repealed by Congress in
1959, of Taft-Hartley—one of the
issues which the Supreme Court
accepted for review. 0

Charging that the non-Commu-
nist affidavit provision of the
Taft-Hartley Act violates Article
I, Section 9 of the U-.S. Constitu-
tion, the ACLU and labor organi-
zations said in the “friend-of-
the-court” brief that they are
especially interested in the Mine-

.5 -. -.

Mill conspiracy case “because
(we) are opposed to govern-
ment-imposed loyalty tests . .

as a prerequisite for holding of-
fice . . . in a. private organiza-

tion. (We) are opposed in par-

ticular to such tests as a condi- »

tion for the receipt of a benefit
otherwise made freely available
by statute.” '
Under Section 9(h) of Taft-
Hartley, a trade union was de-
nied the services. of the National
Labor Relations Board if its of-
ficers did not file non-Commu-

nist_ affidavits. The Mine-Mill de-.

fezfilants sought to‘ show at the

trials that the union’s position

SUDBURY, Ont. — December 7, 8, and 9 are the dates upon which over 15,000‘
employees of the International Nickel Company, who form the largest single bargain-
ing unit in Canada, go to the polls with the opportunity of reuniting all of the area’s
nickel workers under the banner of Mine-Mill.

The Ontario Labor Relations Board, which had unanimously ordered the Inco cer-

tification election on Oct. 28, met with representatives of Mine-Mill and Steel on Nov. .
. 25 to set the dates for the vote. Thirty-three polling places have been set up for the

Tuesday through Thursday election. ,

conbridge operations here, will have the top line on the official ballot. The Steel-

Deadly Mixture!
Housewives have inadvertent-
ly been manufacturing poison
gases in their kitchens—with fa-
tal results, in some cases—re,-
ports the Department of Labor
of the state of New York.
Seeking to boost the cleansing
power, of commercial cleaners,
some housewives have mixed
them with ammonia or vinegar.
The result can be the production.
of chlorine gas so deadly
that it was used on the battle-
fields during World War I.

About 150 perons attended the church meeting, including
some half dozen clergymen, a Connecticut judge, and the
mayor of the city, who addressed the crowd.

Born in Ansonia on April 12, 1905, Coleman was 59 years
old at the time of his death one year ago. Active in the
-civil rights struggle and the labor movement, he also was
president of the Douglass-Tubman Democratic Club here.

Board Member Alfred Petit-Clair, who was among the
Mine-Mill members at the memorial meeting, pledged a $50
contribution to the local NAACP on behalf of the international
union. _ ‘ ‘

major ldifficulty stems from the

diesel transloaders used under-
ground in the mine.

Local 586 contends that the
problem will not be solved iintil

THE MINE-MILL UNION

“ December. ri‘9_6s. '6

Liberajs Rack up Big Gains  Smellng and defining Conference 

In Scaﬂered Nov. 2 Elecfions

John V. Lindsay of New York turned in the big victory in scattered elections
around the country on Nov. 2, as liberal reform Republicans found they could win in
at least some of the cities—areas which had contributed heavily to the crushing de-
feat their party sustained a year ago when ultra-conservative Barry Goldwater head-

ed. the ticket.

A 43-year-old Congressman running on a “fusion” ticket, Lindsay, who accord-
ing to the liberal Americans for Democratic Action voted “right” 79 percent of the
time in the Congressional session just ended (on 19 key issues: “right” on 15, absent

on 4), narrowly defeated Abra-
ham Beame, lackluster candi-
date of an ineffective and tired
Democratic party machine, to
win the mayoralty election in
the nation’s largest city.
Conservative William Buckley
polled close to 15 percent of the
‘vote in the city, but his attempt
to punish Lindsay for the lat-
ter’s failure to support Gold-
water in 1964 is believed by most
political analysts to have back-
fired. It is felt "that he picked up
'more conservative Democratic
votes than the Republican votes
he took away -from ‘Lindsay.

’ Running in a city where regis-

‘ tration figures give the Demo-

crats _close to a 3 to 1 edge,
Lindsay was ableto cut heavily
into the normally heavily Demo-
cratic" Negro and J ewish-wards.

 Philadelphia. Louisville _
' In other’ cities too, Republi-

”" cans... did well if they nominated

‘_'candidates. who were liberal,
,particularly in the area of civil
_rights.  " 
In Philadelphia, where Demo-
pcrats have been solidly en-
__trenc.hed for a score of years,
Arlen Specter, a Democrat run-
ning under the Republican label,
was elected district attorney. A

mayoralty election will be held ’

in that cityiin 1967.

In-Louisville, Ky., a city Re-
pueblica-n organization that
passed the first public accom-
modations ordinance in the
South and-gave jobs to all but
four of the city’s 14 Negro at-
torneys received more than half
the votes in heavily Negro

" wards, as Marlow Cook was
elected.

Democrats w e r e successful,
however, where the party’s can-
didates took firm progressive
stands.

New Jersey Landslide

In New’ Jersey, for example,
incumbent Governor R i c h a r d

V “Hughes rolled to a landslide win

over his Republican opponent,
who had attempted to. make his
mccarthyite charges against a

Rutgers University professor the 1

major issue of the campaign.
Hughes, who carried his party
to victory in both houses of the
state legislature for the _first
time since 1913, didn’t try to
duck the issue -— he stood up
strongly for academic freedom.
(Richard Nixon, incidentally,
who -is expected to“ coordinate
the GOP Congressional cam-
paigns in 1966, came to New Jer-
sey to add his contribution to
his party—a shrill scream for
the firing by Rutgers of Eugene
Genovese, an associate profes-
sor of history.)

Democratic Governor Mills 

Goodwin, Jr., once. an ardent
segregationist of the old Harry
Byrd machine, put together a
new moderate coalition, which

, , i_nclu-ded - labor and Negro

groups, to win over his Republi-
can and Conservative opponents.

Another extremely important
election took place in Cleveland,
Ohio‘, where Carl Stokes, a lib-
eral Negro running as an inde-
pendent Democrat, came within

 

a whisker of knocking off Mayor
Ralph Locher, the regular par-
ty’s incumbent. The Republican
candidate finished far out of the
money. Stokes, who wants a re-
count, lost by only 1,933 votes.
The Nov. 2 results, demon-

dominance in urban America
can be cracked, is bound to pro-
duce at least some degree of
critical analysis and re-evalua-
tion between now and Novem-
ber, 1966—within the inner cir-
cles of both major political par-
ties.

Two Ariz. Miners Killed;

ASSLR BarsFederal Probe

Two open pit copper miners were killed in Arizona on Nov. 17

in mobile vehicle accidents.

Jerry Moore, 27, was killed at Kennecott Copper Corpora-
tion’s ‘Ray mine, when his 85-ton truck,. going down grade, went
out of control and turned over. Thrown out of the cab, Moore

died of a broken neck.

Elmer E- Harris, 30, was killed at American Smelting and
Refining Company’s Silver Bellmine on the same day, when his

rubber-tired‘ dozer backed off

—a bench, fell 40 feet and‘ over-

turned, crushing Harris.
Kennecott officials, in accord-
ance with company policy,

- complied with a request of the ‘
.U.S. ‘Bureau of Mines’ health

and safety office in Phoenix
and permitted a federal inspec-
tor to investigate the accident.
Officials of American Smelting
and Refining Company, how-
ever, dtnied access to the
Silver Bell mine to federal in-
spectors, indicating that no use-
ful purpose would be served by
a federal investigation of the
fatality.

Both accidents were investi-
gated by Arizona state mine

. inspectors.

Local 18 Presents Safety  
Ideasto Governor’s Panel

Charging that the. Idaho State Mine Inspectors Department is
not now set up to do an-adequate job, Mine-Mill Local 18 in Kellogg,
Idaho late in October made several recommendations for action in
a presentation before the Mining Panel of the Governor’s Safety
Conference. , , ’

Ray White, who made the presentation, pointed out that the
House-passed federal mine safety bill, if approved by the U.S. Sen-
ate in 1966, will allow individual states to enforce mine safety codes, ~ .
but only if those codes and that enforcement lives up to standards,
established by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. ‘ - _

Among the Local 18 recommendations were: .

(1) Proper staffing of the state mine inspector's office with

enough men who are familiar with the safety problemsofg
the workers in the industry; 1 ‘

(2) Broader enforcement policies, including a greater willing- 

ness on the part of the mine inspector to enforce the pres- . ' 
ent safety code; A
(3) Acquisition of proper equipment with -which to make the ..
necessary tests of atmospheric conditions, such as dust '
concentrations and amount of oxygen, and proper training , .
in the use of such equipment by the mine inspector and“
his staff; ’ ' .
(4) More adequate financing of the inspector’s office, and, ad- 
d-itionally, an adequate fund for further research into some ‘
of the safety problems that have plagued the industry;

(5)-An updating of the entire code, including that portion deal-

ing with smelters, which was to have been completed -long-
ago, but has not been started; inclusion under the code of
tunnels and quarries; and.

(.6) Establishment of a committee by

the Industrial Accident‘

ment and a qualified disinterested third party to act as
chairman, tocarry out such a code revision. .
White said that a-previousjunion-management committee, se-
lected in 1963 to revise the state code, had, after many meetings,
proposed some slight improvements over the old code, but that all
such recommendations had "been rejected by the Industrial Accident ‘
Board. “All the work and expense incurred,” he said, “. . . went
down the drain.” ‘ ' '

Price Hikes Erased,ibu# Picture Cloudy

At a hurriedly called press conference on the evening of November 17, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara dropped a surprise bomb-
shell into hhe boiling markets for copper in this country and abroad——a bombshell that has shaken nearly all copper prices, with after-effects
which will continue to be felt in the weeks ahead. ‘ _ _

McNamara acted after all major U. S. copper producers, except Kennecott, earlier in the month had raised their quotations on the red
metal to 38 cents per pound from the 36 cents which had been the prevailing producers-’ price since the previous May. A day before McNamara’s
press conference, however, U. S. custom smelters were offering up to 48_ cents per pound for copper scrap, which would have to be melted down

before it could be used again. And as the Secretary of Defense pointed out, copper was selling on the New York Commodity Exchange and

the London Metal Exchange for between 60 cents and 70 cents per pound.

Copper selling at these prices came from small mine producers whose output was re

on scrap. Estimates put the
amount of copper sold at such
prices as amounting to up to
25 percent of the available U.S.
supply.
Administration Action
McNamara announced that the

administration would take the _

following steps:

0 Sell “at least” 200,000 tons
of copper from the national
stockpile to U.S. producers.

0 Control U.S. exports of cop-
per and copper scrap for
an indefinite period. It has
since been learned that con-
trols will be used mainly
to cut down exports of cop-
per and brass scrap from
1964’s total of over 110,000
tons, copper content, to not
more than 30,000 tons per
year. Scrap exports to Can-
ada, however, will be ex-
empt from controls.

pend the 1.7-cent per pound
import duty on copper.

Great Falls Men
Get Back Pay in

longArbitration

GREAT FALLS, Mont. — On
Nov. 26, 10 members of Mine-
Mill Local 16 here received a

. total of $239.70 in backpay,

ranging in amount from 51 cents
to $61.20, which dated back to
Dec. 1, 1963. A lengthy arbitra-

'tion case had finally been set-
tled in favor of the union, estab-_ .
lishing that in thefuture a fur.-

naceman will receive at least
one-half shift at leadman’s pay
if he works any part of the shift
at the higher-rated job.
Thomas H. Tongue of Seattle,

» Wash.vwas the arbitrator in the
-‘case, ruling that the Anaconda
-Company has been violating Ar-A
ticle 4, Section 3(a) of the con-

tract, which provides for a min-
imum of four hours pay at the
higher rate when a worker is as-

signed to such a job.
. . On Dec. 1, 1963, the company
. scheduled the furnace leadman

on the then new shaft furnace

‘ to come to work at 6 a.m. and

the furnaceman to come in at

8 a.m. At the end of the shift, ’

the leadman left two hours
ahead of the furnaceman, who
took over the responsibility of
the leadman. Local 16 contend-
ed that the furnaceman was en-
titled to four hours at the higher

v rate of pay, but the company

refused to do so. _

In April of 1964, an arbitration
hearing. was held on the issue-
following which Anaconda
changed the leadman’s schedule
so that he began work at 7:30
a.m., thus reducing the time that
the furnaceman took over his re-
sponsibility to 30 minutes at th
end ofthe shift. - —

When, in July of last year,
Tongue ruled that the company

— was in violation of» the contract,

the company refused to comply

. with his award, contending that ‘
1 30 minutes per day was not sub- "
‘ stantial. ’ ‘ ’ r

York Commodity Exchange
to curb speculative transac-
tions in copper. The ad-
ministration proposed that
this be done by increasing
the cash margin require-
ment on transactions in
copper from the present 10
percent to about 70 percent.

The Defense Secretary said
the objectives of the admini-
stration’s program were to:

O Relieve the current short-
‘age of copper in the U.S.,
resulting from increased
defense requirements a n d
booming
copper.

0 Cut down the high prices
of copper on the “outside”
markets (markets handling
copper at premium prices).
He declined to predict
whether major producers
would roll their prices back
to previously prevailing
levels.

0 Prevent a drain of copper
needed in the U. S. into
more profitable e x p o r t

' channels.
Release Surprising
Biggest surprise in McNa-
mara’s announcement was the
release of copper in the U.S.
stockpiles, which stood at about
800,000 tons in mid-November.
Previously it had been thought
that only Congress had authori-
ty to release this copper, as it
had done on two previous oc-
casions in 1965, when it released
100,000 tons to private industry
and 118,000 tons to the U.S. Mint
for use in the new “sandwich”
dimes and quarters. However,
President Johnson was advised
by the Justice Department that
he had the power to do this in
a national defense emergency.

The administration’s moves
last month to deal with the
copper situation- underline an in-
creasingly tight market for cop-
per. Serious shortagesof the red
metal for" civilian uses in. 1966
have been indicated recently as
a possibility by Secretary of
Commerce Connor.

U. S‘. brass and wire mills and
foundries have increased ship-
ments in the last three years by
more than 25 percent by weight,

civilian use of

while U. S. mine production
over the same period, despite
all efforts to get more copper
out of the ground, has increased
by less than 3 percent. U. S.
mine production of copper in
1962 was 1,228,421 tons and in
1965 will approximate 1,265,000
tons. .

Less copper has been available
on balance from foreign sources
this year than in the previous
two years. In 1963, the U. S.
imported 180,258 more tons of
refined, blister and scrap cop-
per than it exported. In 1964,
net imports were 150,785 tons.
This year, through September,
this country has imported only
32,856 more tons than it ex-
ported.

Foreign Prices AH-rac-live

These figures indicate that
booming copper markets, main-
ly in Europe, have-led foreign
suppliers of copper to ship less
to this country and more to
other countries where prices
over most of this period have
been more attractive.

Demand for copper products
in excess of mine production,

imports, a.nd scrap recovery has

resulted in significant reduc-
tions in producer stocks, fabri-
cator stocks, and end users in-
vento-ries.

Fabricators’ unfilled order
backlogs have nearly doubled
in the last two years. By now,
there is little further stretch in
the picture.

U. 5. Outlook for 1966

For 1966,_ the outlook for the
United States, despite the mea-
sures announced by the admini-
stration,

civilian uses is a_ “possibility.”
Consider these -factors:

0 Greatly increased use of
copperuby the U. S. Mint
for stepped up production
of pennies and nickels, plus

the new dimes and quar-.A

ters-

O A doubling in military re-
quirements for copper be-
tween 1965 and 1966, as
projected by Secretary Mc-
Namara. According tothe
U. S. Department of Com-
merce, m ilit a r y require-

could well bear out.

ments this year will total‘

over 100 thousand tons.

O Projections of a continued
rise in industrial production
would mean more copper
products needed from brass
and wire mills and foun-
dries.

I A possible further reduction
in shipments of foreign cop-
per to the U. S. market if
prices abroad continue at
levels above U. S. prices.

Only slight increases in U.S.

mine production and in scrap
recovery are in sight‘ .for next
year to offset these factors.
Political Uncertainties
Abroad *
The copper outlook is further
clouded by political uncertain-
ties and strikes. at important

copper-producing c e n t e r s in
; South America, Africa and else-
where. Workers at Anaconda,

and Kennecott copper mines in
Chile struck October 25 and
did not return to work until the
end of November.

The strike was not directed at
the companies, but at the gov-
ernment. The major issue in the

strike is reported to have been
the union demands for protec-
tion for workers, and provision
for pay bonuses, in the pending
bill to “Chileanize” the copper
industry. Details of the terms
under which the workers re-
turned to the mines were not
available at Mine-Mill Union
press time. However, it appears
t h a t substantial concessions
were won.

During the course of _ the
s t r i k e , the copper-producing
provinces were placed under
martial law, four union leaders

were arrested and jailed, and "

a half dozen other union leaders
went into hiding. The miners
held out, however, until a nego-
tiated settlement with the gov-
ernment was reached. An esti-
mated 60,000 tons of copper pro-

.duction was lost during the

walkout. ,
"Rhodesian Situation
Copper markets -are jittery
over the prospect that tensions
arising from Rhodesia’s decla-
ration of independence from the
British Commonwealth last
month may affect the ability of
neighboring ‘Zambia to produce

and export copper. The Zambian’

copper industry, producing over
700,000 tons per year, depends

on neighboring Rhodesia for-

coal and electric .power, and

ships its copper to the coast» 

through Rhedesia to Portuguese
East Africa. «

 

The situation is so potentially... ~

explosive that the.Zambian cop-

per producers and Lockheed

Aircraft Company this month

will launch an experimental air-
lift of Zambian copper to the
Indian Ocean port of Dar es
Salaam. (See pictures on next

to force the aluminum trust to

By Al Skinner
International President _ V

N THE PAST MONTH two important developments in the long
history of legal harassment of our union took place. They are:

(1) The favorable decision of the U. S. Court of Appeals

on the SACB case, which was started against this union in
July, 1955--over ten years ago; .

(2) The decision by the U. S. Supreme Court to hear our
appeal and review the “conspiracy” case against the six re-.
maining Mine-Mill defendants. - -

These two decisions are of major importance to the internal’
tional union and its membership in both Canada and the United

A Fresh Wind ls. Blowing  - } 

States. Both of these decisions point to the possibility of an end, _

after 15 years, to the slander against, sensational press headlines
about, and legal harassment of the democratic union in North

America.
The McCarthy_ Era

OTH OF THESE CASES were spawned in an era of post-
World War II hysteria, often referred to as the period of
“McCarthy hysteria,” with reference to the late Senator from Wis-
consin. It was he who led the fight in Congress for many years
following the war to undermine and destroy free thinking and
constitutional liberties in America. McCarthy was joined by Sena
tor McCarran and many others. _ -
This was a shameful period in American hi‘story—a period
during which were organized and brought to prominence all of the
anti-union, anti-Negro, anti-democratic
leaders and groups in the United States. It
nurtured and succeeded in passing through
Congress the Taft-Hartley law, the McCar-
ran Act, the Smith Act, the Landrum-Grif-
fin law, the Internal Security law, and
other legislation designed to smother free
thought and free expression in our country.
To the legal harassment of Mine-Mill
during this period, the major metal min-
ing companies lent their initiative and
support, in a mistaken hope that these
legal cases against Mine-Mill would de-
stroy our union after all other methods
had failed. Three such cases—tlTe NLRB
decertification case, the Jencks case, and
the Travis case—eventual1y reached the U. S. Supreme Court,‘ and
in each one Mine-Mill’s positionlwas upheld. The SACB case and the
“conspiracy” case, we hope, are the last of the litter—-and an end

 

Skinner

to the attacks against our union—attacks which have always been

fought as part of thecontinuing struggle to preserve freedom and
democracy in our country.

The SACB Case

‘HE U.iS. COURT OF APPEALS on November 1 remanded
' up this case to the Subversive Activities Control Board, terming
the evidence “stale.” The official decision said in part, “We con-
clude that judicial review should await a record of greater cur-
rency than the one before us. Accordingly, this case is remande
to the Board fo-r further proceedings consistent herewith.” ‘

This decision comes ten years after the case was started, which ‘

included so-called “evidence” thatwent back 20 years. It was _so
“stale” it should have been dumped in the garbage can before it
began. Will the SACB attempt to start a new case? Will this take
another ten years? Who knows-—thi‘s is up to the Board. Such a

’ prospect seems not only unlikely, but absolutely insane.

-. The "Conspiracy" Case _
HIS-CASE WAS INITIATED a year after the SACB case, in
1956, ‘and also soon will be ten years old. It originally was an
indictment of 14 leaders of Mine-Mill. There are just six de-

fendants left out of the original fourteen. It will now be finally‘

reviewed and judged by the U. S. Supreme Court.

The Nation, prominent weekly news magazine, two months
ago called this conspiracy case and the government. harassment of
Mine-Mill a “national embarrassment.” The Denver Post, which
has printed its share of scare headlines about Mine-Mill in the past
ten years, in a recent editorial called upon the Supreme Court to
accept the case, saying, “To send men to jail on the basis of a
statutory provision which was repealed six years ago, and which
now appears to have been unconstitutional. when it was on the
statute books, and which was replaced by a kindred statutory pro-
vision which has now been held to be unconstitutional seems to us
to be a questionable business.” ‘

Perhaps the most appropriate comment by anyone was the

statemcnt by Michael Quill, president of the Transport Workers "

Union, to the U. S. Attorney General. He said, "We thought. that
such a charge (conspiracy) had been relegated to the dust heap of
history where it belongs.” ’

The Growing Support for Mine-Mill
GROWING WILHNGNESS by Congress, the courts. and even
by some newspapers to re-examine much of the national folly

and bigotry of the McCarthy period now seems evident. If the two-
editorials quoted above, and other recent. court. decisions, are any
indication, then a fresh wind is blowing on at least some important
questions of. civil liberty in this country.

The American Civil Liberties Union and attorneys for seven
national AFL-C10, unions and the National Farmers Llnion filed an
ainicus brief (supporting brief) before the U. S. Supreme Court
in our behalf. Scores of international unions have pledged support,
have protested to the Attorney General, and have sent money to
our Defense Fund. T

Anljoverwhelming majority of our own local unions are making

regular contributions to the Defense Fund. The. recent interna-,

-1-

  

tional convention, and all previous conventions for the past .10  1 ..

years, unanimously adopted resolutions pledging full support for. 5,

strike against the Perth Amboy
Evening News,-thwarted the at-
tempts by the newspaper to pub-
lish and circulate using scab
labor. Although no details had
been received by Mine-Mill Un-
ion press time, word was re-
ceived that the strike has been

- won, and that workers who had
been fired have been reinstated,

On Friday, Nov. 19, after the
company began herding scabs
in an attempt to defeat the
strikers, an emergency call
went out for further picket line
support. In response, over 500
pickets marched the following
day, preventing the company
from delivering its newspapers.

Morale on the picket line re-
mained high, and, while news-
papers were printed during the
following week, they were not
delivered to the public.

ternity existing between the.-

Joe Hill.__Executed 50 Years Ago Qetzzn, your Wanegz 7/U0.-ill:

Joe Hill never did get his case to the U. S. Supreme Court.
It was settled by the state of Utah, and it was the state -of Utah that executed
the Wobbly organizer in the early morning of Nov. 19, 1915—‘,jUSt 50 years ago. He

S01’! .

i was 36 years old at the time——accused 22 months previously and convicted on flimsy,
» circumstantial evidence of slaying a Salt Lake City grocer, John G. Morrison and his

“All they have against Joe,” said his lawyer, Orrin N. Hilton of Denver, a former.

judge who was attorney for the United Mine Workers and counsel for the Western

calls for leniency from President
Woodrow Wilson and a protest
from the government of Sweden,
where Joe Hill was born as Joel
Hagglund on Oct. 7, 1879, seemed

‘to bear out Hilton’s contention

of a vendetta in a press confer-
ence immediately fo llo w i n g
Hill's execution by a five-man
firing squad. “The fight has just
begun,” maintained the Gover-

nor, vowing to rid the state of

the “lawless element,” stop
street speaking, and use the
militia “if necessary to clear the
state . . .’-’

Mossive ‘Support

_ The scantiness of the evidence’
‘against Hill and the shoddiness

of the proceedings during his
trial in the District Court of Salt
Lake County (the court records
later disappeared) brought
mounting support for his defense

7 ..—-support which reached mas-

sive proportions_ during the 22
months that he spent in jail. It
came from thousands of workers
the world over, who wrote let-
ters urging clemency. It came
from the American Federation

of Labor, which unanimously

adopted at its 1915 convention
a resolution calling for a “new
and fair trial.”

, Joe Hill had first refused help
from the International Workers
of the World, which he had

« joined in 1910 in San Pedro, Cal-

ifornia, wherehe became a long-
shoreman and where, a year
later, he had written his first
known song, “Casey Jones—the

Union Scab”——a. parody of the

original “Casey J 0 ne s,”‘- pub-
lished two years before. He had
felt that the IWW should be
spending its money on organiza-

‘ tion, and had to be convinced

that “defense is organizat-ion.”
When all efforts to save his
life had failed, this is what he
had to say, in a letter to W. 1).
(Big Bill) Haywood of the West-
ern Federation of Miners in Chi-
cago, written on the eve of his
death: “Goodbye Bill; I die like
a true rebel. Don’t waste any

. time mourning—organize! ”

He had one other request-
that his body be removed from

A" 2 the state. “I don’t want to be

found dead in Utah,” wrote Hill.
Arriving in America in 1901,

' he soon changed his name to

Joseph Hillstrorn, which later
got shortened to Joe Hill.
His Songs
“Casey Jones —- the Union

L i Scab,” written in 1911, helped

in scab labor. Within two years,
Hill was recognized as labor’s
most important song writer. His
work gave the labor movement
such songs as “Hold the Fort,”
f‘Should I Ever Be a Soldier,”
“Rebel Girl,” “The Tramp,”
“Stung Right,” and many, many
others.

As an IWW organizer, Hill was

involved in some of the then

frequent free speech fights. Ad-
vocating One Big Union, the
IWW was organizing, to a large
extent, migrant workers, and it
was necessary to speak from
soap boxes on the street, in ad-
dition bo inside union halls.
. Binghom Canyon

In 1912, some 5,000 workers in
Bingham Canyon, Utah — about
3,000 of them working for the
Utah Copper Company, later to
become the Kennecott Copper
Corporation—were defeated in a
strike. The governor —- one Wil-
liam Spry—-had just vetoed a
bill which had been passed in
both houses of the legislature
making obligatory a coroner’s
investigation of any death in the
mines.

E ven the Engineering and
Mining Journal, an industry
publication dating back to 1900,

It is stultifying to cele-
brate the rebels of the
past . . . while we silence
the rebels of the present.
——Henry Steele
Commager

   

 

’ — Federation of Miners, “is that he is IWW.” Utah’s Governor Spry, who had disregarded

called the open pit in Bingham
“the most repulsive mining
camp that we know of in the
United States . . uncomforta-
ble, forbidding and unsanitary
. . . Bingham has been fittingly
described as ‘a sewer four miles
long.’ ”

It was into this setting that
Joe Hill ~came—-to organize. And
it was here, on Jan. 13, 1914,
that he was arrested on a
charge of murder.

Joe Hill was executed 50 years
ago.

But, as goes the song “Joe
Hill” by Alfred Hayes and Earl
Robinson:

“ ‘Takes more than guns to

kill a man . . .’
Says Joe, ‘I didn’t die . . .’ ”

“From San Diego up to Maine,

in every mine and mill,

Where working men defend
their rights,

It’s there you’ll find Joe
Hill . . .

It’s there you’ll find Joe
Hill.” '

Upheld in N.M.
Arbitration Case

BAYARD, N. M. — Elijio M.
Ogas, Jr., a member of Mine-
Mill Local 890, was reinstated
on his job with the American
Zinc, Lead and Smelting Com-
pany here on Nov. 17 as the re-
sult of an arbitration decision by
Joseph M. Klamon which held
that the company could not dis-
charge an employee without giv-
ing him a hearing.

Three weeks’ back pay was in-
cluded in the award, and, when
the company still refused to put
Ogas back to work, he received
wages for time lost between
Nov. 5 and Nov. 17 as well — a
total of $365. ‘

Ogas, 19 years old, was dis-
charged on July 30, after having
worked for the company for
about a month and a half, for
having violated safety rules
when he stuck his head out into
a shaft on June 28- being in-
jured when he was struck by a
descending cage. The local
union, which won the arbitration
on the basis that the company
violated Article VIII, Section D
of the contract by firing Ogas
without a hearing, also argued
that he had not willfully violated

the safety rules, but had done so '

because he had heard a call for
help from below.

Further Delay,

Handed down on Nov. 1, the
arbitration award .d i r e c t e d
American Zinc to put Ogas back

to work within five days. In-*

stead, ..the company said it
would hold the hearing that
Ogas should have had before he
was discharged. Union protests
on this-point were upheld by the
arbitrator in a clarification of
his award. Due to this delay in
reinstatement, the worker re-
ceived the additional back pay
for wages loﬁ between Nov. 5
and the time he returned to
work. '

International Representative
Alfredo C. Montoya handled the
case for the union, with assist-
ance from Local 890 President
S. Q. (Chano) Merino, L. Torrez,
G. Jimenez, M. Garcia, and Art
Flores.

Ogas was reinstated with all
of his rights, seniority, and va-
cation time credit.

December.‘ I  --

Each December, almost a million U. S. families shuffle the
books on their reference shelf to make room for the latest odifan,
of their “shopper’s bible”—the book-size Buying Guide issue  
CONSUMER REPORTS. This year, the Buying Guide issue has 

been expanded to 448 pages, and includes a number of new features‘ ‘ 5  "

that should be welcomed by consumers.
Music lovers will discover recommendations for A  BASIC
RECORD COLLECTION offered in the HOME ENTERTAINMENT
section. The selections include over 200 compositions that repre-
sent classical masterpieces from the last four centuries. They are
grouped in eight classifications: Chamber Music, Choral, Concerto,
Keyboard, Opera, Orchestral, Symphony and Vocal. '

Are you baffled by the competing claims of hi-fi manufacturers 3

for components and “packaged” radio-phonograplis? The Buying
Guide says: “There’s no intrinsic reason why a machine assembled
at home should be better than one assembled at the factory-
indeed, the logic is all on the side of professional assembly. But _
the packaged console has not lived up to its potential, while over

the past couple of decades component systems have constantly ' —“‘;~_

stressed quality of reproduction and have often achieved it." The
article then goes on to define terms for the novice, and the entries _ 1
that follow provide ratings of various brands of both co1npone_.nts- '

and packaged units. *

‘k ‘A’

If your needs are more elemental, tl1ere’s a section on

KITCHEN EQUIPMENT. It includes gas and electric ranges of
various types including one with a self-cleaning oven. The HOUSE-

HOLD AIDS AND APPLIANCE section includes buying guidance
and ratings of washing machines, dryers, steam-spray irons, small" .
room air conditioners, and four types of vacuum cleaners, to name

a few.

CU has continued some long-popular automobile features ands

added some new ones in this year's Buying Guide issue. An article. - . L. ‘

on How to Buy a Used Car is again available and .a new ‘one on
How to Buy a New Car‘ has been added. Frequency-of-repair
records on all makes of U. S. cars from 1959 to 1964, based on
over 190,000 reader responses, are shown in chart form-—uew data »-
which has not been published before. The used car buyer who —
wants to avoid a lemon will be grateful for zglist of the makes
and years judged most desirable and least desirable. ‘
The section on PHOTOGRAPHY includes a piece entitled “Buy-
ing a More Versatile Camera” which introduces the box camera
owner to the refinements in other types of stillcameras. A com-
parison of the features and ratings of 15 models of single-frame
35mm cameras and 20 models of 35mm auto-exposure cameras
follows. The section also deals with 35mm rangefinder cameras,
Polaroids, and single-lens reflexes. The report on projectors for
2-inch and 2%-inch slides reveals that one priced at $119 rated

little better than another at only $54—a finding not surprising to  3
regular readers of CONSUMER REPORTS. ’

This year’s‘Buying Guide issue also reports on fly rods, spin-
ning reels, tennis balls, life preservers, and speedometers for

motorboats in the RECREATION section.

What are the chances of getting a fraukfurter that complies
with state regulations? How much weight is lost in cooking bacon,
and do some types lose less than others? Are the new boil-in-liw
bag frozen vegetables economical? What’s happened to frozen fruit
pies? These are a few of the questions explored in the section on .
FOODS. To give you one of the answers, the poly-bagged vege- ‘ ’
tables in CU’s tests averaged about 5 cents a pound less than the
same vegetable packed in a carton. '

The homeowner thinking seriously of buying a rotary power-
mower will get some sobering information on the lack of safety
in the design of far too many models, whether electric or gasoline
driven. But on exterior and interior latex paints, he’ll get -some
realencouragement. This and more in a section on WORKSHOP

‘AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT.

Have you had a speaking suspicion that stainless steel razor
blades aren’t giving as many shaves as they used to? This has

. seemed to be a fairly common reaction, but CU’s test results,don't

support this charge. This report is in the HEALTH AND GROOM-
ING section along with electric shaver ratings. The ladies will find
some needed guidance on hair colorings and hair dryers in the -

same section.

CU has found that savings are possible on sneakers and that
blue jeans have earned their popularity with both children and;
parents. For families with babies, the section on CLOTHING also
has a report on diapers. Of the bewildering array of 43 models of —-
three types analyzed, CU concludes that flat diapers at $2 a dozen
with no frills should prove perfectly satisfactory. -

New Jersey Zinc Expansion
A The New Jersey Zinc Company continues to make news. Since
 .-acquisition of majority control by Gulf and Western Industries,
if (Inc. for a cash outlay of over $83 million, New Jersey Zinc has
 announced an ambitious expansion program:

1 Oln conjunction with Teck Corp., a Canadian mining and
oil company, a new three million ton lead-zinc orebody will be
,; developed in Northern New Brunswick, 70 miles west of Bathurst.
I A $5 million mine and mill development program is planned,

to.average 12 percent combined lead and zinc,.with lesser values
in copper, silver and gold. Mining by open pit is planned in
V’  the initial stages of production.
 O The company’s zinc mine at Elmo, Wisconsin will be
reopened, and a new mill and concentrator will be erected. About
50 employees will be needed when mine and mill are in operation.

O'The company will enter the fertilizer business with con-
struction of one of the world’s largest and most modern diam-
monium phosphate plants at its Depue, Illinois "zinc smelter. The
, plant, to be in operation in the second half of 1966, will have a

Automation of Mines and Smelters

Speaking before the first World Convention of Chemical Engi-
neering in Mexico .City recently, Wilbur Jurden, president of an
engineering and construction ‘firm, said automation of mines and
smelters has effected great reduction in labor costs over the
last ten years. ‘

“Obviously,” he said, “the. utilization of larger locomotives,
larger ore cars, larger crushersrand grinding mills would effect
cost reductions because of their high efficiency, but the greatest
reduction is probably in labor saving.”

Jurden said an-example of labor saving in a modern, auto-
mated copper smelter came to his attention during a recent
inspection of an older copper plant. This old smelter employs
over 900 men, while a modern smelter his firm recently designed
produces about the same tonnage of copper with fewer than 400
men.

“In 1926, when the huge Andes Copper mine was developed at
Potrerillos, Chile, the concentrator produced 58 tons of ore per
man-day,” he explained. “In 1942, when the Morenci project. went
into operation, it produced 125 tons per man-day, and today’s
concentrator, due to better, larger and more efficient equipment,
improved metallurgical practices and automation, will produce
better than 300 tons per man-day.”

It is difficult to portray cost reductions due to improvements

in open pit mining, haulage and blasting, owing to their wide-

variation at each mine.‘

For example, he said, 60 years ago, when the operations of
the Utah Copper Mine were under study, two percent copper was
considered very low grade ore, and there was about a 60 percent
recovery of metal. Thirty years ago, when the Morenci project
was being considered, two percent ore was considered high grade;
1.2 percent ore then was considered low grade; and there was
about an 85 percent recovery. As years passed, such mines
deteriorated to 0.7 or 0.8 percent ore with upto 90 percent re-

covery, and only last year ‘a large open pitmine began operating’

with 0.55 percent copper ore and about 90 percent recovery.

Gold Mining Expands in Nevada

Eugene Jordan Associates, Oklahoma City-based oil driller
and producer, which also has been involved in the Incline Village
development at Lake Tahoe, will bring in a large gold mining
and milling operation in January. The property is located 52 miles
northwest of Pioche, Nevada and 15 miles west of the Utah-
Nevada border. Open pit operations have already started at the

mine. Some 35 to 40 men will be employed at the $5,100,000 mine '

and.. mill project, according to a company spokesman. .

The Atlanta mine, as it is to be known, will be the third major .
gold mining operation now active. in Nevada. The others are the

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 the bill last May

Mining onress

*-'.~*< »v< >* :-

1 Va‘ ‘__‘~C- xv

(aturallyl tits Mine Safety Bill

__.._.__..—.-—,p.

’ The ‘American Mining Congress convention in. Las Vegas October 11-14 ran true to form’, passing
the usual resolution opposing federal safety legislation for metal and mineral mines. _The resolution,

in part, says:

“Based on the record and the present and past’ activities of the industry, we firmly oppose, as
unnecessary and undesirable, the enactment of additional laws to impose federal controls over all

.n0I1-C031 min€S- We urge the adequate financing of local and state activities in the health and safe-

ty" field. The present cooperation between federal agencies and state and local officials in this area

should be continued.”

The AMC heard from Sidney S. Goodwin, vice-president of the New Jersey Zinc Company, and

U. S. Senator Peter Dominick (R-Colo.).

Goodwin lambasted Interior Secretary Udall’s report to

Congress, “Health and Safety Study of Metal and Non-Metal Mines,” which called for a federal mine

safety law and has been widely
cited by supporters of the John-

son administration’s ‘f e d e r a l .

mine safety bill, HR 8989,

I passed by the US. House of

Representatives on September.
2." The report, he.said, “leaves
much to be desired in objectivi-

ty" and understanding ' of the

basic problems ‘of safety in the

non-coal mining industries.”
Goodwin said the House‘ sub-

committee, chaired by Repre-

sentative James G. 0’Hara (D-

Mich.), which held hearings on
“brushed
aside” opposing testimony by
the‘ mining »indu,stry.‘The com-
mittee," he said, “is generally
composed of people not 1 too
familiar with the operation of

" the mining industry.”

‘ ~Senator Dominick, an oppo-
nent of HR 8989, indicated there
is, little chance of stopping the
bill in the Senate Labor Com-

mittee to which. the bill l1as been.‘

as"s’ign‘ed-. He said the ' opposi-

tion -strategy will have to be

‘ carried ‘out on-the floor of the

 ,1 Senate after the bill is reported -
' out for a vote. ‘

regard to old hazards-yet mer-

quency as new uses are found

,0 Automation is posing “new
and subtle. threats to mental
health.”

0 New scientific knowledge
“points to hitherto unsuspected
cause and effect relationships
between occupational exposures
and many of the so-called chron-
ic diseases” such as cancer, al-
lergies, and heart and respira-
tory ailments.

O The most controversial rec-
ommendation is one for a law to
give the Public Health Service
power to enter any “workplace”
and check employee health rec-
ords if “there is evidence of a
serious threat to health.” ,

, Safety at :Sea.,

The burning .and' sinking» of
the luxury cruiseship Yarmouth
Castle on the Miami-Nassau, run
last month at a cost of 88 lives
points up another area where
loopholes in safety regulations
take a needless toll.

Only last August at House
committee hearings on a bill to
beef up U. S. maritime safety
laws, Congressman William S.
Maillard (R-Calif.) called the
Yarmouth Castle “a ship not in
the proper condition to engage
in trade.” At the same hear-
ings the National Maritime Un-
ion designated the Yarmouth
Castle as a “foreign flag ﬂoat-
ing firetrap.” The cruise ship

- was registered under the Pana-

manian flag and thus exempt
-maritime safety
standards.

It was inspected by the'U. S.

‘Coast Guard shortlybefore’ the
disaster and pronounced in com- 1
pliance with’ the much weaker

standards laid down by the In-

ternational Convention on Safety .

of Lifetat Sea. One of the main
weaknesses of the International
Convention» is‘ a “grandfather.’.’
clause whichpermits old ships,

‘unsafe by modern standards, to .

continue in operation. The Yar-
mouth Castle was 38 years old,
and had an excessive amount of
wood in the superstructure, cov-
ered by many coats of flam-
mable paint. ' ‘ _

An editorial in the Scripps—

 

 

Howard papers termed the bum-
ing and sinking as “inexcus-
able”. and said, “We hope pub’-
lic opinion also will be suf-
ficiently aroused to cause laws
to be passed which will force
the fusty bureaucracy governing
ship safety to join the effort to
make foreign flag cruise ships
safer.”

Coal Mine Safety

The House-passed small coal
mines safety bill, which would
bring under the mandatory pro-
visions of the Federal Coal Mine
Safety Act mines with 14 and
fewer men working under-
ground, stalled in the Senate La-
bor Committee in the closing
days of the Senate in October
and awaits Senate action in the
1966 session.

lnspectionsat Stauffer
Mines in Montana

Reinspections of St a u f f e r
Chemical Company phosphate
mines in Montana were conduct-
ed by the U. S. Bureau of Mines
late in October. The Bureau in-
spector again noted the use of
. diesel equipment underground at
the Canyon Creek and East La
Marche mines, not approved by
the Bureau, and recommended
that Bureau-approved equipment
be used to replace or add to the
mobile diesel-powered equip-
ment now in use underground.
Otherwise, major emphasis in
the Bureau recommendations
was placed upon improvement
of ventilation at _all three mines.
The following improvements and
’ recommendations are q u o t e d
from the inspector’ s report:

Dies on N (W. 3 1

J. Howard Bird, who as a mine health and safety specialist for

351/2 years was well known to many members of Mine-Mill, died. -
1 on Nov. 8 at his home in Denver following a brief illness, only a _

few months after his retirement from his job as manager for.
District E, Health and Safety Branch of the U. S. Bureau of Mines.
Requiem High Mass was sung for him on Nov. 11 at St. Vincent ‘
de Paul Church, followed by burial in Mount Olivet Cemetery. _
Bird, 62, who was born in Murray, Utah on Nov. 1, 1903, had
general supervisory responsibility for the Bureau’s health and

safety offices in Phoenix, Salt
Lake City, Oakland, Calif., and
Seattle, as well as Denver until
his retirement on May 21 this
year. His district included North
and South Dakota, Nebraska,
the Rocky Mountain and Pacific
Coast states, Alaska and Hawaii.
Silicosis Survey

He served on the American
Standards Association subcom-
mittee which drafted, in 1960,
the association’s protective
standards against radiation in
uranium mines and mills, and
was a member of the Inter-
agency Technical Committee
which carried on the Bureau of
Mines-Public Health Service
survey of silicosis in hard rock
miners and issued its report in
1963.

During the Interior Depart-
ment’s survey of health and
safety in metal and non-metal
mines from 1961 to 1963, Bird
was the Bureau’s liaison man
with Mine-Mill and received the
hundreds of work injury reports
prepared during that period by
Mine-Mill locals. During his
many years with the Bureau, he
visited many Mine-Mill locals
throughout the Rocky Mountain
area, and, in March, 1963, was
a featured speaker at the
union’s international convention.

Prior to joining the Bureau of
Mines in -1929, he had worked
at the Vipmont silver mine in
northeast Utah and the old
Highland Boy mine in Bingham
Canyon. With wide experience
in mine safety, Bird performed

especially valuable work in tun-

nel safety in Hawaii. He also 2 

was involved in fighting many.-

mine fires, one of the most

memorable of which was a stub- '- .

born underground fire in a metal

mine in Mexico. ‘
Last July, he was presented

with a Distinguished Service

Award from the Interior De-* is

partment at the 31st Honor
Awards Convocation in Wash-‘
ington, D. C. — a
Bird is survived by his widow, -
