 

the Lake Erie Chemical Company, told the Senate munitions commit-
tee that sales of gas and machine guns to textile-mill owners, during
the strike, increased from ﬁve to ten per cent. In one instance, Goss’s
business was helped along by a letter of recommendation, on War De-
partment stationery, from General George Leach, head of the Militia
Bureau of the War Department, to the head of the National Guard in
Wisconsin. General Leach wrote that Goss’s products are “the best
insurance policy against social disorder that I know of.” He also pointed
out that these products were being used effectively in various strikes
and demonstrations including the evacuation of the bonus marchers in
1932 from Washington's Anacostia ﬂats.

The barbed wire concentration camp erected by the Georgia New
Deal government and the mill owners for textile strikers who exer-
cised their legal rights of striking and picketing, is an eloquent symbol
of the Fascism that is eager to string barbed wire over America.
Georgia's barbed wires are the tentacles of threatening American
Fascism. +

The Naval Sprint

Just a few months ago, the naval disarmament conversations held
in London by England and the United States virtually announced a new
War-breeding race in battleship building. This new battleship con-
test, from all indications, will begin right after next year’s scheduled
naval conference. —

Davis went to London to get the British to form a temporary united
imperialist Anglo-American front against Japan for the purpose of
browbeating the latter out of her bankers’ and industrialists’ demands
for naval equality. However, the hostility between American and Brit-
ish imperialism proved too strong, even for a temporary robbers’ pact.

Whatever the outcome of the Naval Conference, it is apparent
that there can be no reconciliation of the conflicting naval claims. This
quarrel is merely the reﬂection of the underlying imperialist conflict.
That the War menace is not exaggerated becomes clear when it is re-
alized that Japan will certainly not budge from her determination to
hold on to what she has and to expand her domination of the Far East.
In the Far East, Japan strives for a navy “second to none”—which
is exactly what the United States will never agree to since it would
mean the eventual crowding-out by Japanese imperialists of their Ameri-
can competitors in the Orient.

President Roosevelt himself showed how thin is the paciﬁst cloak

10

 

-Iota?-T

under which he launches gigantic War measures. What's all this War

talk about anyway, he said before signing the billion dollar naval con-
struction Vinson Bill, a measure which gives the President blanket
authority to build, above and beyond the program already under way, an
armada of about 102 Warships and 1184 War planes. This Vinson Bill
also authorizes in general terms the replacement of all over-age War-
ships (20 years old and over) under the terms of the naval treaties.
This means that authority has been given Roosevelt (by his own politi-
cal machine) to rebuild an entirely new ﬂeet of 15 battleships at a mini-

_mum cost of $45,000,000 each, since all the U. S. battleships are either

over-age or nearly so.

0, No! I Love Peace!

Why, this Vinson Bill doesn’t appropriate one penny; it simply‘

authorizes me to go ahead and build the battleships, aircraft carriers,
cruisers, submarines, and destroyers authorized by the Washington and
London Treaties, said Mr. Roosevelt. True, the Vinson Bill was only
an authorization—but three weeks later he gave the word to go full
speed ahead with the ﬁrst destroyer-submarine building under the Bill
—the $40,000,000 cost of which is to come out of the so-called Public
W orbs Program.

Nevertheless, the hypocrisy continues to gush, calling to mind the
fact that the whole 1917 mobilization was carried out under a paciﬁst
Secretary of War (Baker) and a pacifist President (Wilson). How
quickly the tune of I didn’t raise my boy to be a soldier . . . gave way
to America, here’: my boy for you . . .

The alimentary canal of the Blue Eagle is a sixteen-inch gun.

Total allotments, under the guise of “Public” and “Civil” works,
for direct and indirect War preparations and the total authorizations
and appropriations for military purposes conclusively demonstrate the
War character of the Roosevelt Administration—the instrument which
simultaneously reduced the standard of living of the majority of Workers
and erected a huge strike-breaking apparatus.

Billions to the War Eagle

President Roosevelt, up to August 1, 1934, the date of the latest
ﬁgures, allotted $749,953,566, or more than 20 percent of the $3,700,-
000,000 Emergency Public W orbs fund for direct and indirect War
preparations, exclusive of the $341,938,753 given to the War Depart-

11

    

ment engineers for rivers and harbors and ﬂood control, a substantial
part of which goes to seacoast defense for channelling and dredging and
surveys of the ocean ﬂoor for submarine operations, in addition to serv-
ing to supply military engineers with continual War training. This is
also exclusive of the $50,000,000 allotted to the Tennessee Valley Ad-
ministration, the greatest part of which is involved in the construction
of the World’s largest integrated electrical power production system,
obviously a huge power reserve for War plant operations.

To this 20 percent plus must be added the $585,719,943 appropri-
ated by Congress, before the creation of the PWA, for the military ac-
tivities of the Army and Navy for the last ﬁscal year ending July 1,
1934, and the $600,887,790 appropriated for the current ﬁscal year.
In addition, Roosevelt got $40,000,000 from the new PWA funds for
two heavy and twelve light destroyers, and six submarines authorized

by the Roosevelt—backed Vinson Bill.

Thus, the War and Navy Departments have already received, in-
clusive of the $39,000,000 obtained by the former from the sale of old
clothing, the staggering total of $2,015,561,299. These War billions
were given by a government which refused to give more than an aver-
age of $20 a month relief to a family of four and a fraction people.
This tremendous total is a mere introduction to the War building now
being blue-printed. Some of these blue-prints are in the form of legis-
lative proposals. There is, for example, the acknowledged War bill
(S. 3182), favorably reported to the Senate by the Committee on Mines
and Mining, which would set aside a fund of $200,000,000 “To Pro-
vide for the purchase of the surplus copper, heretofore mined and pro-
cessed in the United States . . . for the use of the United States in
constructing military and naval equipment . . .”

Hundreds of other War preparations bills were brought before the
House Military Aﬂairs Committee by its Chairman, John J. McSwain
of South Carolina—proposals to establish a separate airplane ﬂotilla
of 2,000 planes, and to add 400 officers and 6,200 men to the Army at
a cost of about $80,000,000.

Lest there be even a particle of doubt about the War-conditioning
nature of the Civilian Conservation Corps, one -need only refer to As-
sistant Secretary of War Woodring’s article in the January 6, 1934
issue of the magazine, Liberty. Woodring, whose War blasts have
never been repudiated by the White House, wrote: “This achievement
—the organization of over 300,000 men in more than 1,500 Civilian
Conservation Corps camps—was the first real test of the Army’s plans
for War mobilization under the National Defense .4 ct as amended in

1920. It "proved both the eﬂiciency of our plan of defense and the
equally important success of the Military Procurement Plan——the
Army’s economic War plan —which is intrusted to the Assistant Secre-
tary of War.” In fact, as the outspoken Woodring pointed out, “If
the Army were so directed, it could organize the veterans of the World
War, the C. C. C. men, and through them the administration of emer-
gency relief, into a system of economic storm troops . . .”

More recently, an interesting letter now in the public record of
the Nye-Vandenberg munitions investigating committee testifies to the
military character of the C.C.C. camps.

The Washington representative of the Curtis:-W right aviation cor-
poration, on April 11, 1933, wrote Burdette Wright, one of the heads
of the ﬁrm, that:

Due to the estabishment of military training for the unemployed,
the Secretary of War has suspended all sales of surplus material by the
War Department, as they are now short of equipment for this
purpose . . .

Disarming the Enemy

As far as the Panama Canal (see itemized War expenditures) is
concerned one need only recall its strategic geographic position, the re-
cent ﬂeet maneuvers (War “games”) there, especially the elaborate
military precautions taken to screen them from the scouts of rival im-
perialist powers. In fact, the importance of protecting the Panama Canal
from air bombardment explains, in large measure, both Hoover’s and
Roosevelt’s “disarmament” proposal for the abolition of bombing planes,
among other “aggressive” weapons considered by the U. S. Government:
“suitable for invasion.” Davis’s reiteration at Geneva, on May 29,
1934, of this old demagogic appeal to the masses who instinctively
associate airplane raids with modern War, is a crafty proposal. It is
crafty because American diplomats realize that airplanes are a two-edged
weapon. Being relatively cheap, even small countries can afford them.
The U. S. imperialists appreciate the serious damage that a single bomber
could do to the Canal. Therefore, to get rid of such a menace to U. S.
imperialism is of no small importance, especially when the War Depart-
ment has plenty of factories blueprinted and ready to start into mass
production of these planes at a moment’s notice.

aside from its purely technical and military provisions, attempted to pro-
vide for the organization of production in the nation’s industries so
that a suflicient number of troops for a major War with all the ma-
terials necessary for waging War may be supplied promptly on the out-
break of hostilities. It virtually amounts to mobilization of the basic

‘industries of the country.

Under this Act, the Assistant Secretary of War was ordered to
card-index and line up the key production facilities of the United
States. “The essential elements of production,” says the Industrial
Mobilization Plan—revised 1933, “are raw materials, labor, power,
ﬁnances, facilities (factories), and transportation. The problem is to
assure the most efficient use of these things.” Thus far, responsible
oﬂicials declare, about 12,000 factories have been contacted by the De-
partment’s traveling War salesmen and visited, inspected, approved, and
placed on the key list of the War Department as ready to begin War
production literally at a moment’s notice. In addition, about 14,000
“patriotic” industrialists have received reserve oﬂicers commissions. Thus,
in the event of War, the dividended patrioteers will drive their em-
ployees not only as employers but also as employers with Army officer
belts around their well fed waists.

In Woodring’s opinion, “a proper carrying out of the industrial
mobilization plans formulated in my oﬂice will ‘take the proﬁt out of
War’ and accomplish in large measure the purpose of those who have
advocated a ‘universal draft’ of property, money, and civilian labor.
And such a plan is adapted in peace as in war to coordinate our economic
life and ration our civilian population. The plan is there and the Army
is ready should it be called upon to act.”

Going Hitler One Better

The bankers and industrialists who ﬁnanced Mussolini’s Fascisti and
Hitler’s brown battalions probably never even dreamed of such elaborate
plans as those which activate and guide the U. S. War machine. But
blue prints and employer-oﬂicer conferences are not enough in the cam-
paign to keep the workers chained to sfarvation, misery, and oppression.
In addition to propagandizing workers with the ﬁction that they have a
stake in American capitalism’s foreign possessions and hence should be
willing to stab and shoot down other Workers (Who get the same tale
from their own imperialists), America’s Astors, Schwabs, Taylors, Mor-
gans, Rockefellers, and other rulers seek to get from the white collar, the
small business man, the farmer and the working class a domestic military
base to protect the monopoly fruits of the NRA.

The trigger ﬁnger rulers of this country are straining every nerve
to set up what the Chamber of Commerce of the United States called
a “citizen army.” Hitler gave them their historical name—Storm
Troops. This “citizen army” would be prepared to meet “any emer-
gency that might arise,” according to the plans of the corporation heads
and their military marionettes who stage Army Day and Navy Day.

The Same Old Game

Imperialist demagogy fully realizes that the “rape” of another little
Belgium—its cruel exploitation of African natives in the Congo is not
mentioned in polite imperialist society—wouldn’t fool the masses so
easily today. War planners have therefore decided that their propa-
ganda must start early, be a little more subtle and somewhat different
from a decade or two ago.

The announcement released last winter by the Reserve Oﬁicers z1sso-
ciation of the United States, described the patriotic ‘activities planned
for National Defense W eeh (Feb. 12) under the Chairmanship of Gen.
Amos A. Fries, head of the Chemical Warfare Service of the A. E. F .,
by such organizations as the Navy League (founded by J. P. Morgan,
Charles M. Schwab, and the Midvale Steel Co., among other leading
industrial and ﬁnancial men and units), the reactionary American

, Legion leadership, the Military Order of the World W ar, the Coalition

of Patriotic Societies, the United States Naval Reserve Officers .4sso-
ciation, “And other Patriotic and Civic Organizations.” This announce-
ment, sent widespread through the Washington newspaper correspond-
ents, said: “Through the Chapters and Posts of the participating organ-
izations, Speakers’ Bureaus have been organized to furnish speakers on
National Defense before Civic, Fraternal and Patriotic Organizations
as well as Educational Institutions, Essay contests are being sponsored
among students at schools and colleges on such subjects as ‘Peace Time
Activities of the Army,’ ‘The Economic Value of the Soldier,’ ‘A Navy
Second to None,’ ‘Preparedness——A War Preventive,’ ‘The Navy and
Our Trade Lanes,’ etc., with prizes and honorable mentions to be
awarded to the best thereof.” That’s what you call propagandizing
War-mindedness.

A Double Purpose

The corporation lawyers, bankers, industrialists, publishers, judges,
journalists, generals, admirals, ministers, and other lights of the ruling
class, in a National Citizens Committee headed by Newton D. Baker,

15

.... .._... ....j._.———...

 

called upon “our citizens” to “take stock of what we have in the way
of national defense and what preparations are being made to meet
ANY emergency that might arise,” in the Army Day (April 6, 1934)
issue of the National Bulletin of the Military Order of the World War.

That American bankers, industrialists and landlords are pushing this
militarization campaign for the purpose of smashing workers’ militancy
and the general anti-War sentiment was made clear by the “proposals”
adopted this spring by the Chamber of Commerce of the United States,
the highly organized propaganda organ of America’s most powerful
capitalists. This group, also one of the founders of the NRA, voted
“overwhelmingly” for the following foreign and domestic recommenda-
tions, written by a committee which included James A. Farrell, former
president of the feudalistic United States Steel Corporation, the key-
stone of American capitalism and incidentally, the beneﬁciary of big
Navy construction contracts:

The United States should maintain the principles of Army organi-
zation embodied in the existing national defense laws, calling primarily
for a small active military force to serve, with the National Guard and
the Organized Reserves, as the nucleus of a large Citizen army in case
of emergency.

In agreements for limitation of naval armament the United States
should obtain assurance of a fleet adequate to protect our shores, our
territories and possessions, and our foreign commerce to an extent equal
to that enjoyed by any other power.

“You Fight, We Cash In”

The Nye munitions investigation has brought a good deal of the
sewage of the War business to light. The gigantic War profits of the
du Pont concern, the division of world markets between Electric Boat
(the American submarine holding company) and Vichers (its English
rival), the close and corrupt connection between the munitions makers,
the War Department and Latin American governments, the 181 Ameri-
can War millionaires, all succeeded in stirring up resentment against
the War proﬁteers.

President Roosevelt’s proposal (December, 1934), may mean the
stabilization of War proﬁts-—that is the guarantee that the du Pants
and their friends will be certain to get their share. But behind the
demagogic attack on the munitions makers, the Administration puts
forward its real program, namely, that of consolidating, centralizing, in-
creasing the efficiency of the War machine. Bernard Baruch, Wall Street
banker, and former Chairman of the War Industries Board, has been put

16

 

at the head of a new War plans committee, which is to meet at either
the call of Baruch, jingo General Johnson, or Roosevelt. Secretaries
Dern, Swanson, Hull, Morgenthau, Wallace and Perkins are to be
members, as well as Army Chief of Staff, Douglas MacArthur, Henry
Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, George Eastman, railroad
coordinator, and George Peek. Supposedly, this committee is formed
to “draft a legislative program,” to equalize sacriﬁces in case of War,
etc., etc. Behind the smoke screen of “taking the proﬁt out of war,”
the Administration is preparing a smooth working top organization to
set the War machine in motion.

Fortunately, however, many thousands of veterans, workers, farmers,
middle class people, seamen, and longshoremen, understand that it is
better to prevent one American, Japanese, British, French, or any other
imperialist ship from leaving port with guns, powder, cotton or other
War supplies designed for the slaughter of the common people in other
lands, than to wait for or believe in ten thousand “investigations” of
armament and munitions manufacturers.

In the case of Japan, for instance, these workers realize how im-
portant it is to explain to all workers, Negro and white, regardless
of union or political aﬂiliation, that the Japanese workers and peasants
are heroically opposing their own bankers, industrialists, and landlords.
They explain this to them to make it clear that the American workers
must direct their energies towards the real enemies of working class
internationalism-—_American and Japanese bankers, industrialists and
landlords.

How Workers Stopped War

“These Workers recall to their fellows how American marine workers,
in Seattle in 1919, refused to load ships with munitions and other War
supplies destined for the Siberian armies of Admiral Kolchak, the White
Guard spearhead of the imperialist interventionist campaign led by the
British, French, Japanese and American governments against the newly
founded workers’ and farmers’ government—the Soviet Union.

A great deal is being written in the liberal, conservative and reac-
tionary press about the similarity between today and the pre-World War
era. Writers and speakers point to the mounting armaments, the “dis-
armament” chatter, War horrors, trade rivalries, the same nonsensical
drivel about “aggressive” and “defensive” weapons, and so on and so
forth. In other words, the superﬁcial likenesses between today and
1914.

17

 

1914 - 1935'

It is exceedingly important that people realize that War propaganda
today is both more insidious and more open, more widespread and at
the same time more centrally and consciously directed, than ever be-
fore, so that they will be able to counteract the maneuvers of the War-
makers and thereby increase the effectiveness of anti-War work in the
ﬁelds, in the home, in the schools, on the waterfront, on the ship, and
in the factory. We are witnessing an open attempt to sell the unwary
workers and farmers the lie that they will be protecting their own
interests in fighting for the industrialists and bankers in the approach-
ing War. More and more this approach is becoming the dominant
theme, while the paciﬁst notes of “Disarmament” Conferences, oratory
about “peace” pacts, “outlawry of war”, etc., etc., grow weaker and
weaker.

Listen to Senator Hiram Johnson of California, Republican booster
and favorite of the Roosevelt Democratic Administration. In his March
6, 1934 speech, demanding the passage of the Vinson Bill, Johnson
thundered:

I want a navy, I want a real navy, I want a navy that either
upon the Atlantic or Paciﬁc will be able to do all that may be done in
behalf of the commerce of this Nation, in its protection, and that may,
if the worst come: to the worst, ﬁnally do what the Navy has ever done
for the United State: of America.

It will be in time to come our first line of defense. It will be in
day: to come our first line of oﬁense.

Secondly, the Government, and semi-ofﬁcial (Reserve Officers Asso-
ciation of the U. S.) and ﬁnancial-industrial forces (such as the Cham-
ber of Commerce of the U. S.) are spraying the people with Fascist
propaganda, the main purpose of which is to militarize the masses of

workers and farmers against mass opposition to War. This propa-*

ganda shouts for a larger army and navy and supplementary “citizen”
forces which, while performing strike-breaking functions, will be pre-
pared not only for what is described as “invasion” in high sounding
declarations of War but also for what Assistant Secretary of War
Woodring publicly calls “economic chaos, or social revolution,” and
what Major General MacArthur terms “unrest”. In other words, in
addition to propagandizing the people for non-questioning service in
‘imperialist War, the government of the American bankers, landlords,
industrialists and big land owners, are attempting to recruit storm
troopers and regular soldiers to prepare and if necessary murder Workers
and farmers in their struggles for better wages, shorter hours and
relief for unemployed workers and for the farmers.

The Final Line-Up

Thirdly, American bankers and industrialists, and their various
tools, from "the jingo publisher and capitalist, William Randolph Hearst,
on the right, through the various Fascist tendencies on the “left”, are
feeding the fires of nationalism. This is a nationalism designedvto pre-
vent’ American Workers‘ ‘from supporting workers in other countries,
from strengthening the world movement for a decent social order.
Now, more than ever before, in View of the rising consciousness of the
workers and farmers (shown through strike struggles, political demon-
strations, etc.), the common people’s internationalism is openly recog-
nized by the War makersias the main enemy in each capitalist country,
especially in those countries where Fascism rules. '

It is against this creeping Fascism and; the government’s War
propaganda that the American League Against War and Fascism is
fighting. Only this continued and intensiﬁed struggle can -stop War

and Fascism. .

There is no time to lose!

GUNS ARE READY

HE ROOSEVELT administration is preparing tirelessly for

M-DAY, the War Department’s oﬂicially designated day when
telegraphic orders for instant industrial and military mobilization will
be ﬂashed throughout the country. The 1935 session of Congress is all
set for the largest War appropriations the country has ever witnessed
in peace time.

For workers, farmers, professionals and small business men in the
United States, it is no longer a matter of ‘some remote boil in the Balkans.
It is more than a vague threat. It is a pressing reality. Actually there
is responsible talk in Washington of the number of months left before
the governments will order their people to kill one another for
the usual imperialist reasons. And yet the teacher and the fireman
whose salaries are cut, the industrial worker whose already low real
wage was slashed 1.1 percent between June 1933 and June 1934, the
year of a nearly 600 percent rise in corporation proﬁts, and whose food
cost since then has risen 7.7 percent (from June 5 to September 1l—
Bureau of Labor Statistics of Department of Labor), are asked to
applaud the sliding of a $50,000,000 battleship down the ways.

(Rise in retail food costs from low point, April 15, 1934 to Septem-
ber 11 is 29.2 percent.)

The Army and Navy general staffs hold unprecedented “peace—time”
maneuvers in which they seek to simulate actual War conditions. The
Navy Department 1935 program calls for the concentration of warship
and airplane forces in Alaskan waters.

Secretary of the Navy Swanson, on September 19, 1934, said:

The 1935 fleet problem will be the defense of Alaska and our
northern coast: against a ‘theoretical’ enemy invading fleet. The role of
the fleet will be that of a defending force . . .

An examination of the closing 1934 debates in the Senate discloses
frank talk of the necessity for building automobile roads along the
Paciﬁc Coast—-obviously for better and shorter concrete conduits for
short haul army truck and troop movements.

The great sums——now well past the two billion mark——announced
regularly for motorization, ammunition and machinery, submarines,
bombing planes, cruisers, chemical mortars and gases, and the rest of
the War arsenal have become a New Deal commonplace along with
Secretary of War Dern’s Hitleresque assurance (August 16, 1934)
to the ﬁfteen million ' unemployed that “there are blessings in adver-
sity" and that “in the white heat of suffering, the souls of men and
of nations are forged into sterner and more durable stuﬂ . . .”‘ Mr.
Dern is a Utah banker whose government salary alone is $12,000
a year.

With these open War preparations for the threatening armed strug-
gle for new markets and for the redivision of old ones, goes the in-
creasingly brutal offensive of American industry and ﬁnance against
the mounting anti-War sentiment of the people and the irrepressible
determination of awakening striking Workers and farmers all over
the country to face the tear gas, the bayonets and machine guns, and
barbed wire concentration camps with mass marches and mass picketing.

A Stacked Deck

With all this goes the steadily progressing integration of the New
Deal set-up with the industrial mobilization apparatus, known as the
Military Procurement Division, of the War Department. This coordi-
nation is evident in the selection of professional militarists and military-
minded industrialists to effect the gradual functional marriage of the
NRA and the War Department. Both militarists and industrialists
have made it clear that War preparations are the steel backbone of the
NRA and that industry is closer than ever, since‘ 1918, to the War
machine. V

This tie-up is emphasized by the fact that the very manufacturers
who drew up the NRA codes and who then constituted themselves NRA
code authorities are the fellows who play such a prominent part in the
industrial mobilization plans of the War Department.

The leading part that General Hugh S. Johnson, administrator of
the Draft Act under Wilson, played in the formation and develop-
ment of the NRA apparatus is well known. His leaving the NRA
not only unrepudiated but praised, means only that his open strike-

breaking became embarrassing to the “good neighbor” occupant of the
White House. The fruits of Johnson’s work, in San Francisco and in
the textile strike, will be consolidated in new plans. General Johnson’s
forn}1ler boss, Wall Street speculator Bernard M. Baruch, will see
to t at.

Who Is Who

Some of the other War birds of the New Deal, are:

Lieutenant Colonel George A. Lynch, recently transferred by
Roosevelt and Johnson from the General Staff of the War Depart-
ment, to the position of chief administrative oﬂicer of the NRA, a job
he is expected to hold under the reorganized NRA.

Colonel Robert H. Montgomery, until a few months ago Chief
of the Research and Planning Division of the NRA, contributed to
this Roosevelt “planning” the beneﬁt of his experience during the
World War as chief of the organization and methods section in the
office of the Director of Purchases of the Army General Staff, and
as organizer and member of the War Department Board of Appraisers.

Jesse I. Miller, the executive director of the old National Labor
Board, Well known to those Worker delegations who got the run-around
when they came to Washington, .sharpened his social and economic
viewpoint as aide-de-camp during” the World War to the late Major
General Enoch Crowder, General Johnson’s (at the time Major) War-
time superior. '

Charles F. Homer, the high pressure head of the four-minute
speakers during the World War, the man whose job it was to make
the country believe that the World War was a “war to end wars” and
a War “to make the world safe for democracy,” is an NRA special
Assistant Administrator in charge of Volunteer Committee: for the
Blue Eagle.

Newton D. Baker, the paciﬁst Secretary of War under Wilson,
now an open shop corporation lawyer, like Roosevelt, represents the
continuity between the last World War and the preparations for a
new one. As head of the Roosevelt-appointed Baker Aviation Com-
mittee, Baker has made the expected recommendations for additional
hundreds of War planes.

ment is a long one. General Johnson’s June 7, 1934 announcement, in
oﬂicial release No. 5618, is typical of the brief statement made to desig-
nate the inﬁltration of a great many oﬂicers into the code authorities.
“Major W. L. Clay, U. S. A., assigned to special ﬁeld duty in connec-
tion with Army procurement and Planning activities, is appointed to
the code authority for the forged tool manufacturing industry.”

While some of the oﬂicials listed are not now with the »N RA, the
work of militarization has already been done. Basically, the NRA is
Army dominated and inﬂuenced.

Procurement planning means planning for War by militarizing in-
dustry. Assistant Secretary of War Woodring called it the “Army’s
economic war plan”. It is.

Interwoven with this gearing of an entire economic system to the
War machine is the militarization of the youth, especially by the Fascist-
tinted Civilian Conservation Corps; the programs of the jingo-anti-
labor Chamber of Commerce of the United States, the National [Issa-
ciation of Manufacturers, and the NRA Durable Industries Com-
mittee; the so-called anti-crime program of the Justice Department, a
great deal of which is directed against labor; the vigilante attitude and
activities of the American Legion leadership, whose Washington legis-
lative representative, John Thomas Taylor, is a Colonel in the U. S.
Chemical Warfare Service, Oﬂicers Reserve Corps; the present reor-
ganization or rather cementing of the NRA into the mold prepared
for it by the trade associations, by Baruch, head, under Wilson, of the
War Industries Board, and “angel” of the Democratic Party, by Gerard
Swope of J. P. Morgan & Company’s General Electric Company, the
co-author with General Johnson of the Swope Plan and the formulator
of the NRA electrical code under which workers are driven an un-
limited number of hours a week as long as they “average” 36 hours a
week over the whole year, by Myron C. Taylor, chairman of Mor-
gan’s U. S. Steel Corporation, and by Walter C. Teagle, of the Rocke-
feller interests’ Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.

Under the ﬂag of advancing Fascism there is an ‘aﬂinity of interests
between the Democratic and Republican parties, between the Morgans
and the Rockefellers. Fundamentally, imperialism’s two dominant par-
ties are one.

A Loving Embrace

"The increase of $356,685, that is, from $24,144,000 to $24,500,000
in the 1935 presidential budget for the National Guard (and the in-

crease from 24 to 36 paid drills) is intended to preserve the anti-work-
ing class unity of the Democratic and Republican Parties. In fact, in
at least eight states, where the National Guard, which is maintained,
equipped and trained by the Federal Government, gassed and bayonnet-
ted Workers and farmers striking for a decent living, this unity became
a loving embrace. On this point, it is well to remember that no Demo-
cratic Governor, specially one in the South, Where the Roosevelt-Farley
machine is strongest, would dare to call out the militia to prevent picket-
ing and other forms of striking, and to murder workers, if the White
House were opposed to this use of the National Guard.

This is partly a reﬂection of the fear that a militant labor move-
ment Will interfere with its War preparations plans. Hence, the com-
pulsory arbitration section of the new Dill railroad bill, hence the use
of various “investigating.” and “fact ﬁnding” boards to abort a strike,
hence the hasty breaking of the textile strike by the Roosevelt administra-
tion in the face of a mounting strike sentiment without any guarantees
that the workers would be taken back and in spite of the fact that the
presidential inquiry board did not grant a single strike demand. Hence
the early legalization of the company union by General Johnson and his
successor Donald Richberg, Chicago liberal.

Peace-time War

Private corporations supplement the activities of the National
Guard. Federal Laboratories of Pittsburgh, the corporation which sold
tear gas and machine guns to the textile corporations, is the same outﬁt
that sent ten armored cars to Cuba, for similar strike-breaking use by
the Roosevelt-Mendieta government against the Cuban Workers.

Evidence given the Nye-Vandenberg Senate munitions committee
showed that Federal Laboratories supplied all the guns and grenades
to Henry Ford, for Henry’s Dearborn massacre of peaceful unemployed
auto Workers.

Paul Young, president of Federal Laboratories, according to this
evidence, said that this peaceful march of the unemployed on Dearborn
had given warning to all industrialists to prepare against the unemployed.
In one of his business letters, Young wrote: “The crisis, while it has
brought a shortage of funds, has created an acute demand for our
products and put us in a preferred class. We must impress all public
officials that they must buy our products even though they cannot pay
salaries . . .” The oﬂicials were impressed.
