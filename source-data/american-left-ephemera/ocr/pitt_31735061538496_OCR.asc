It is clear from this message and the attack on the Pbwell amendments
that the failure of the Supreme Court to say when and how desegrega-
tion should be put into effect was no accident. The express policy of
the Administration is that segregation is to be outlawed some time,but
not now.

The Negro people do not agree. Speaking at the NAACP convention the
day after receiving the President's message, Thurgood Marshall, the
special counsel who led the court fight against school segregation, told
the delegates: ' ' '

“Apart from the avowed enemies of Democracy and integration
there are many Americans.who actually are or appear to be in favor
of eventual integration after a period of time. We are beginning
to get advice publicly and privately from these alleged friends
urging us not to be impatient, not to rock the boat, not to push
ahead too rapidly. I believe it is time that we examined this
advice and gave to these_advisers the facts of life. In regard
to the elimination of racial discrimination in this country, Negroes
are impatient. They are insistent; They are determined to get
their rights as rapidly as possible.”

RELATI ON"-SH‘ I P OF FORCES

Mr. Marshall is right. But the $64 question is how?‘ How can the
power of the white supremacists in their Southern stronghold be broken?
— Can the relationship of forces, now so unfavorable for winning
Negro equality, be changed?d S

According to the 1950 census, there were 134,942,023 persons listed
as white, and 15,755,333 colored in the United States. That would
present a pretty hopeless situation for the minority...if the issue
is seen as simply one of white vs. colored; Such a small minority, ten
per cent of the population, could not possibly outvote the other 90
per cent in “democratic” elections, or raise a larger fund to pay the
costs of court cases. And to use force, no matter how just the cause,
would be suicide. - ' '

But, fortunately, the decisive division of forces in this country
is not based on color. There are many kinds of conflicting interests
pitted against each other, and there are divisions within them. But
the biggest, the most persistent and most fundamental conflict is the
daily struggle between labor and those who own and control the_in-
dustries of this country, over wages and profits. And this conflict is

' inseparably related to the Negro struggle for equalityi”

if it is to be at allef- ,

highly organized employers. "
This requires not only the
joining of forces by mergers ~%
of C10, AFL and other
unions, but also a conscious programcd7action against the campaign of
Big Business to destroy the bargaining strength of the unions by pitting
them against each other and against the unorganized workers. »

    

  

During World War II the demand for labor induced the industrialists
not only to hire Negroes and inexperienced or untrainedwmite workers
who migrated to the North in large numbers, but to build plants in the
South, as well. In the post-war period of cut-backs in production, many
companies found it more economical to shut down their Northern plants
and shift production to the South, where the standard of living and
costs generally were lower, where union organization was weakest;

INDUSTRY GOES sourn

They have continued a policy of decentralization of industry to such
an extent that sone unions, such as textile, have been forced to accept
wage cuts and deterioration of working conditions in the vain hope that
they could avoid runaway shops, loss of jobs and loss of members. Many
other unions are similarly threatened.

At the same time Southern businessmen have organized to make the
South even more attractive to industry by a campaign to keep unions
out. An article in Labor's Daily by Sidney Lens (May 20, 1955) reported:

“That all of this is well organized is self-evident from the
fact that fullyi56.6 per cent of all eligible southern employers
are now enrolled in the viciously anti-labor NationalAssociation
of Manufacturers. Only one out of every 10 workers carries a union
card down South, but almost two of every three bosses carries the
NAM insignia of antiunionism in his wallet. And these men are

hell bent to keep unions out.’ After all, th ey lured thousands of
plants into the area by the promise of near zero taxes and low non- I
\ union wages. they now have to deliver on their promises." ‘

eThe way they deliver is through local ordinances penalizing union
organization, through intimidation of workers and union organizers

‘by methods which include physical violence, and by passing state
CK

. “right to work laws" against the right to work" of unionists.

“In one town in Georgiaf’ Lens reported, “they've passed a law"
_ requiring.union organizers to pay a $1,000 license fee and $100 a’
day for each day they work at the task. Another town charges
$2,000. In still another bastion of democracy, in Tennessee, they've
made it illegal for a union organizer to visit a worker's home
without a written invitation in advance, on penalty of $50_for
each transgression." S

RACISTS ANTI-LABOR

These obstacles to labor's organizing drive in the South are directly
related to the fight against segregation. It is no mere coincidence
that of the 17 states which had passed “right to work” laws by 1954, 12
were states which also legally required or permitted segregation in
public schools; Alabama passed its anti-union shop law in 1953, and
Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana in 1954, in the same period
that they were passing special measures against desegregationcpfschools.

The anti-labor white supremacists who rule the South know that the
only way they can remain in power is by preventing the majority - the
working people — from uniting to use their economic.and political
strength; That means enforcementtofsegregation in schools, in unions, in
public and private life; restrictions on voting; denial of civil rights.

The anti-labor National Association of Manufacturers and its Northern
members also know this, and will not permit any federal action to in-
terfere with “states's rights" to discriminate against organized labor
and Negroes. A

The labor movement must fight back or lose the battle. They must
organize the South or face a loss of bargaining strength in the rest
of the country. A fourth of the Southern labor force consists of
Negroes; They must be organized, and the only way this can be done in
industry, as the CIO learned in the North in the Thirties, is on a
non-segregated basis.

13

To defend their right to organize, the unions must fight the re-
actionary anti-labor laws-of the South politically. The mass of
Negroes and poor whites must be assured the right to vote and de-
fended in exercising it.

Negroes make up more than 45 per cent of the population in Miss-
issippi, 38 per cent in South Carolina, 33 per cent in Louisiana,

'32 per cent in Alabama, 30 per cent in Georgia. 'The Southern poli-

ticians know what a potential threat these numbers are to their rule.
That is why Rev: George W. Lee, Mississippi NAACP leader Who Cam‘
paigned for Negroes to register and vote, was murdered last May, and
why no attempt was made to find the men who shot him.

‘LABOR MUST FIGHT JIM caow

The labor movement and the Negro movement have common interests
and a comon enemy. They support each other’s legislative demands
and civil rights battles in the courts. But convention resolutions,

flegal briefs.and similar expressions of good will do not meet the

crisis now facing them. A new approach and new methods are needed;
This is a big fight and every worker who wants to protect union con-
ditions will have to take a stand. Tb equalize wages upward instead
of down to the Southern level, and to combat the runaway shop,he will
have to insist on organization of the South in the only way it can be
organized -- by fighting for equal rights for Negroes.

The Supreme Cburt decisions on desegregation have demonstrated the
limitations of purely legal campaigns.

With Washington under the pressure of the ‘cold war‘, of the col-
onial uprisings in Asia and Africa, and of American business and pol-
itical interests jockeying for position in the colonial and semi-
colonial countries, American Negroes were able to take their griev-
ances to the court of world opinion in 1954.

No official or unofficial salesman for the State Department could
go abroad without being asked by the colored colonial people,
“If your chief concern, as you say, is to lead the ‘free world‘ in
spreading democracy, why do you deny it to American Negroes?‘

With this assist from their allies abroad, the growth of the Negro
population as a political factor in the industrial centers, and the
courageous persistence of Southern Negroes willing to suffer the con-
sequences of opposing state laws, the colored people of the United

14

 

 

 

States were able to wring a concession from the Supreme Court and the

Administration - the admission that segregation in public schools isg

unconstitutional.

PROGRAM OF ACT I ON

But that is as far as Washington intends to go. It is time for~

the organized labor and Negro movements to say Jim Crow must go now
and to organize a militant campaign of independent mass action, a
crusade that will enlist the millions of unorganized workers, the
youth, and the middle class of this country. For this a broad pro-
gram of action is necessary,which includes the following main points:

1. A drive, using the Supreme Court decision as a wedge, to de-
segregate the schools now. Support the NAACP legal actions (pet-
itions to school boards, court cases, etc.) but recognize the in-
terest and responsibility of the labor movement in desegregation.
Submit petitions and institute suits by national and local unions.
Take direct action - - by Negro and white parents -- as the Negro
‘parentsin Hillsboro,_Ohio are doing, refusing to permit their chil-
dren to attend segregated schools. '

The courts have ruled that Bryant Bowles, the professional race-_

hater who agitated and instigated demonstrations in Delaware and
Maryland against integration was acting legally. The labor-Negro
drive should use its rights to organize mass meetings, demonstra-
tions, protests, boycotts and picket lines against segregation.

They should conduct a campaign of education through radio, tele-
vision, movies, newspapers, pamphlets, classes - all the mass media
possible today? '

They should conduct a principled, uncompromising struggle against
discrimination simultaneously on all fronts: housing, industry,
unions, the armed forces, voting and political rights.

2. Union defense guards should be organized wherever necessary to
protect Negroes and union men from physical attack. ‘The past year

has seen a new wave of beatings of union organizers by hired thugs.,

In Missippi the new Ku Klux Klan -- the so-called Citizen Council is
conducting an all-out campaign of threats and intimidation against

Negroes. The murder of colored citizens seeking to exercise the

right to vote has becane a national scandal.

Union defense guards should come to the aid of those threatened.

labor’: flake in Me Fig/N

for Il£6K0 £404/Hy

A big fight over segregation is shaping up in this country, and
everyone in the United States is going to have to take sides; To do
so intelligently, rather than emotionally, it is inportant to under-
stand the issues involved. _

The Negro struggle-for equality broke into the front pages of the
daily press and became national and international news around the
Supreme Court casestcxdetermine whether segregation of colored children

in public schools is legal in the United States.

on May 17, 1954, the highest court of the land ruled that public
school segregation is unconstitutional since “Separate educational
facilities are inherently unequal” and persons so segregated are
“deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment."

That was a great legal victory for democratic principle. It was a
victory because it threw out the policy the Supreme Cburt had followed
since 1896 that segregation on a racial basis was constitutional as
long as the separate facilities were “equal.”

But the Court did not say when and how its new rule should go into
effect. The Attorney General of the United States and the attorneys
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and

of the states maintaining segregated schools were invited to present A

their views to the court in further hearings;

A year later, on May 31, the Supreme Court finally issued its
second decision. It reaffirmed the principle that “discrimination in
pulic education is unconstitutional:' but left it to the local school
boards which practice segregation to determine how and when those

separate schools should be abolished. Moreover, the District Courts,_
’ which have ruled against integration, are to judge whether or not the F

local boards are carrying out desegregation in “good faith."
This was a political victory for reaction; As the New York Times
correspondent from Tennessee reported on June 1: “In off-the-record

statements state officials here were inclined to view the decree as
being about as lenient toward the South as the Supreme Court cogld_
have been without reversing the opinion handed down in May 1954.

ipolitical leaders in Mississippi, South Carolina. L0UiSiana»

Alabama and Georgia are understandably contemptuous of the ruling
which assumes their “good faith" although they had already taken «
steps, in advance of the May 31 decision, to evade any order to ‘
integrate the schools, and had publicly announced their intention of
naintaining segregation at all cost. '

Nﬁssissippi, Georgia and South Carolina passed amendments to their
state constitutions permitting the abolition of the public school
system to preserve segregation. Florida passed a bill giving locali
school authorities the power to assign students to schools; Alabama's

’ Attorney General asked the legislature for fundslnohire four additional
attorneys “primarilytxahandle the multiplicity of segregation suits{.£"

The lower courts have already indicated the kind of decisions that
may be expected from these guardians of “good faith" in implementation
of the Supreme Court's ruling. ‘

In Columbia, S. C., on July 15 a three-judge Federal Court, utiliz- i
ing the double-talk language provided in the Supreme Court's ruling,
ordered Summerton school district trustees to proceed “withzdl
tdeliberate speed” to operate on a non-segregated basis “from and after
such time as they may have made the necessary arrangementsi"

When Charleston Attorney Robert McC. Figg said the trustees would

be in constant danger of being cited for contempt if the decree were
I -) . ', _ o
no clearer’ on the amount of time allowed. Judge John J; Parker said:

‘GOOD FAITH’ ASSUMED
“No one need have any fegr" of being in contempt of court if the
trustees act in good faith. I assume the trustees are going to obey.”

. The mystery is where the judge found a basis for his assumption,
since, as the Associated Press reported, “The trustees have announced
they will close the schools rather than mix white and Negro pupils;”

A similar ruling was handed down by a federal court in a Prince
Edward Cbunty, Va. school case.

In effect, the lower courts are enjoining Jim Crow school boards
fr°m Seﬁregatlnﬁ school children - after some undetermined date.

ten, Sept. 1954)

Dnagine a court issuing an injunction against picketing with a proviso
that the picketing may continue, however, until the union finds It
feasible to discontinue the strike! _ w

This is the kind of stalling and ‘good faith”that can generally
be expected of the Deep South under the Supreme Court's ruling
that segregated schools are illegal but the local authorities can
decide how and when to abolish them.

What does this mean? It means that the limit of reform of some
of the worst evils of segregation through legal channels alone has
been reached;

If the struggle for integration of public schools remains within
the straitjacket of court procedures, it can only be a costly and
demoralizing experiencel

Those states or local school districts with proportionately fewer’
Negroes, where maintaining separate schools has become a serious
financial burden, may possibly use the Supreme Court decision to
release them from laws requiring segregation; Some have already done
so. A number began the process before the Supreme Court ruling of

May 1954.

III III III

BORDER STATES DESEGREGATE

Eight months before the decision the Topeka, Kansas board of educa-
tion voted to end segregation in elementary grades as rapidly as
possible. Atchison, Wichita and Pittsburg acted before Topeka,and
Kansas City, Lawrence, Leavenworth and other Kansas cities followed.

In Arizona state courts had already declared segregation illegal in
public education and local schools had begun integration in 1953.

There

of this!

 

 

But in those states where the proportion of Negroes in the popula-
tion is greatest, such as Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana,
Alabama and Georgia, the Supreme Cburt ruling is being used to nnblllze
the white supremacists not only agalnst integration but against exten-
sion of any democratic rights to the Negro masses-

In Georgia, for example, the state board of education announced
on August 1 that teachers may not belong to the N.A.A.C.P. “or any
allied organization or subversive‘0rganiZati0ﬂ3' 0" Deﬂalty Of
revocation of teaching licenses “for life.”

Negroes have never been able to, and cannot now, base their struggle

\ for equality on illusions as to the “good faith” of their enemies in

the executive, legislative or judicial branches of local, state or
federal government. As a matter of fact, they must, and in practice
do, start by recognizing the "bad faith” of the authorities. Then a
sober estimation of the relationship of forces can be made and
tactics planned to take advantage of the situation wherei1;is favorable,
or to change the relationship of forces where it is not.

SEGREGATION IN THE NORTH

‘Both friends and foes of integration know that segregated schools
are not an isolated problem: It will not be possible to abolish Jim
Crow in education so long as we have segregated housing, discrimination
in employment, racial limitations on political action ranging from
restrictions on voting to lack of democratic representation in elective
and appointive positions.

The experience in the North proves this. Even where state or local
laws do not require segregation, or even where they specifically bar
it, the majority of Negroes go to separate\and inferior schools

because they are forced to live in rundown, overcrowded slums and‘
the schools reflect the composition and economic status of the

communities in which they are located.

With few exceptions, Negroes are still employed, for the most
Part, in the lowest paying jobs and cannot afford to buy or rent
homes in better neighborhoods. Even the small number with slightly
higher incomes are barred by real estate interests and banks, by

refusal to sell or lend money, by intimidation and physical attacks
by hoodlums.

iAlthough in general segregation is not as extreme in the North,

racial discrimination in the South is not a “local?=problem, but
rather the fountain head of Jim Crow throughout the United States; Any»

attempts by Negroes concentrated in industrial centers in the North
and West, where their economic and political weight is greatest, to
secure national reforms is consistently stymied by the_fact that the
South, where the majority of the colored people still live, is
"democratically" represented in Congress and the federal government
by avowed enemies of equal rights for Negroes;

The two party monopoly in politics makes a farce of democratic
electoral procedures for minorities; No one, not even Negro repre -
sentatives from Northern colored districts, can Wln significant

legislation in Congress or eﬂective federal administration of rights,

guaranteed in the Constitution for the South.

THEEDLE*DUM AND-TWEEDLEFDEE

The reason: ‘There are no basic diﬁerences in program or principle
between the Democratic and Republican parties; Sectional diﬂerences
within each party on specific issues, such as civil rights for Negroes,

tare always subordinated to party unity in order to maintain the balance

of power between the two political machines.

Congressuan Adam Clayton-Powell, a Democrat elected from the Harlem
district of New York City, attempted to extend the Supreme Court
ruling on school segregation to legislationyin the 1955 session of the
U;S; Congress. He led the fight for amendments_to school construction,
housing, and military reserves bills which would have denied federal
funds where segregation is practiced; The result was defeat of the
amendments and a direct attack on Powell by President Eisenhower,who
called the amendments “extraneous” and “erroneous]‘ while in no way
criticizing the anti-Negro opponents of the measures. ‘

This intervention by the Administration against attempts to legislate
against racial discrimination is consistent with the Chief Executive's
message to the 46th annual convention of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People in June; He said in a telegram:

"I trust that in the decade ahead your organization will display,
both wisdom and patience as it continues to bear its share of the
responsibility for the betterment of the country as a whole."
