The People against

the armakers !

Permit me to illustrate one aspect of this dark truth with a
few statistics and economic facts.
We have just passed through the period of greatest indus-

trial expansion in our country's history. Between 1940 and .

1944, 25 billion dollars were invested in new plants and equip-
ment, vastly increasing the nation's capacity to produce. In
1944 we doubled the dollar value of goods and services pro-
duced in 1940, and actual physical output was increased more
than 50 per cent. The amount of electrical power that turned
the wheels of America’s mass production industries was in-
creased by 73 per cent. In April, 1944, an American worker
produced from 30 to 50 per cent more than he produced in
December 1942. 9

Ownership of -the means of production and control over this
unparalleled productive capacity of men and machines is in
the hands of America’s 60 families, or more accurately, in the
hands of eight major vested interest groups. Incidentally,
one of these powerful groups is ofﬁcially known as the “Cleve-
land group.” You may have heard of it. It includes, among
others, the Goodyear Tire 8c Rubber Co., Republic Steel, In-
land Steel, Youngstown Sheet 8: Tube, and a couple of banks
and utilities. In itself it is small potatoes bu-t it has married
into the du Pont family and the Morgan—First National Bank
group—the real big-timers.

1' These overlords of the American economy face the ever-

present imperialist problem of continuing to produce huge
quantities of goods, selling them at a high rate of proﬁt, and
ﬁnding new enterprises or ﬁelds of foreign investment into
which their new wealth can be invested for still higher proﬁt.

The monopolists’ inability to ﬁnd a solution of that prob-
lem after the First World War produced the crisis of the ’3o’s
—not to speak of the imperialist monsters, fascism and war.
World War II offered a temporary economic “solution” by
providing for a short period an insatiable market in which
they could sell at exceptionally high prices.

But the war has come to an end. In a peacetime world in
which the capitalist system as a whole has been seriously weak-
ened, in which the government no longer guarantees most of
the market, the American monopolists ﬁnd themselves with a

10

 

.,,m“u

fabulously expanded productive capacity whose goods they
must sell, and with a vast accumulation of the idle capital for
which proﬁtable new investments must be found.

It is possible to-increase the consuming power of the people
by drastically slashing prices and profits and raising wages far
above the current 30 per cent increase asked by American
labor. It is possible to do this if and when the powers of the
monopolies are curbed. But in their resistance to the wage
movement and their drive against the O.P.A. and for lower in-
come and corporate taxes, the monopolists have conclusively
demonstrated that they want nothing to do with such solu-
tions. For they are and remain capitalists. They are governed
by thelaws of capitalist society. They are not utopians or so-
cial reformers.

It is possible to ﬁnd customers abroad, and to aid or invest
in the reconstruction of the war-devastated and colonial and
semi-colonial countries. But the American trusts want to sell
at their own price, and invest only on their own terms.

, And, for the most part, their terms are to subordinate or
mortgage the British Empire to American imperialism; to re-
store feudalism and fascism in eastern Europe; to maintain
Latin America as their private source of raw materials; and to
control a dependent Kuomintang-dominated China. It is to
impose these terms that the American controlled international
caﬁrtels are ready to attain their aims either through the so-
called dry method of the “open door” or through the means
of a third world war—for as monopoly capitalists they have
no other solution.

The Soviet Union, the only non-imperialist great power, is
the natural ally of all who seek freedom, who resist the preda-
tory policies of the cartellists and monopolists, who seek to

 

throw off the bondage of empire. It bars the way to the‘

restoration of fascism and militarism in Germany and Japan
and everywhere. It gives courage to the colonial peoples, and

_ offers the new European democracies opportunities for re-

 

covery and reconstruction on equal and democratic terms.
It—the Soviet Union——has no problems of over-production,
unemployment or crises, for in the U.S.S.R. the workers and
peasants have abolished the exploitation of man by man; they
1 1

  

have abolished private ownership of the means of production
and have established a Socialist, a workers’ society.

That» is why the imperialists, whose last great stronghold
is American monopoly capitalism, hate andifear the U.S.S.R.
That is why they are directing their war preparations pri-
marily against the great Socialist State. For the Soviet Union
is the foremost bulwark of peace and progress. Its strength,
its ﬁrm peace policy, and its resolute efforts to maintain Big
Three unity and champion national independence, provide the
chief obstacle in the way of the predatory expansionist drive
of American and British imperialism.

The American and British imperialists would like to wipe
the Soviet Union off the map, especially before the next cycli-

cal economic crisis hits the U.S.A. But as Hitler found out,_

that is easier said than done. And as Ilya Ehrenburg told some
Washington newspapermen the other day, the U.S.S.R. is like
the Gulf Stream—it is here to stay. .

A The people of the United States and Great Britain, as of all
the United Nations, have had enough of the scourge and terror
of war."They will not readily or willingly support an anti-

Soviet war. They will not accept a third world war as ineVit— t

able; when they understand the new war dangers, they will
act promptly and unitedly to stop it. Theirs is the power to
restore Big_ Three unity and force the fulﬁllment of the Pots-
dam, Moscow and Yalta agreements. They can -be aroused
and mobilized to exercise their power——in time to save the
peace.

We American Communists have a heavy responsibility to
the American people, whose independent action can be de-
cisive. This responsibility was recently emphasized in a dis-
tortediway by the frankest of all spokesmen for the architects
of World War III. ' , ' _

In his open call to war at Fulton, Missouri, Winston Chur-
chill slandered the Com1nunists—in the spirit of Goebbels. He
also demanded the virtual extermination of the various Com-
munist Parties, including the Communists of the United States.

‘We are proud to plead guilty to the charge of Churchill and
Hearst that we Communists are the most/uncompromising
foes of imperialism and imperialist war, and therefore are also

12

 

 

 

the bitterest opponents of the projected plans of imperialism
for a criminal war against the great working class democracy
—the U.S.S.R. And we American Communists are certain that
the British people did not give of their blood, sweat and tears
only to have Mr. Churchill rebuild the anti-Comintern Axis.
We did not war against the Nazis so that the Anglo-Saxon
imperialist “supermen” might rule the world in Hitler’s place.

As ’for the stale lie that the Communists are “foreign ,

agents,” we would remind Mr. Churchill that it was in the
British Museum ‘that Karl Marx wrote the ‘Communist classic,
Capital. We would also remind him that there was a Com-
munist movement in the industrially advanced countries long
before‘ there was a Soviet Union; and that prior to the great

-October Revolution the Russian Bolsheviks were also charged

with being the ,“'foreign agents” of Germany, of Marx and
Engels. And we would especially remind Churchill and his
American colleagues that without the self-sacriﬁcegheroism
and decisive role of the Socialist Soviet Union in assuring
victory, as well as the staunch and leading anti-fascist role of
the Communists of all lands—Churchill’s England and “West-
ern civilization” today would be a shambles and lie prostrate
under the Nazi heel. _

The American people can draw up their own list of the real
ﬁfth columnists, of those who today menace American democ-
racy and peace. It is a long list, and at the head of it stand
the despicable John Rankin, Gerald L. K. Smith, the Trotsky-

ites, Senators Bilbo and Eastland, Col. McCormick and Hearst,

ex-Governor Earle and the du Ponts.

We can ‘well understand why the warmakers who cherish
and protect the ﬁfth co1umnists—the classic Trojan-horses of
fascist imperialism—honor us with their hatred and whip up
spy scares and witch-hunts aimed at destroyingthe American
Communist Party. Only if they can behead‘ and divide the
gathering peace forces in the United States by isolating ﬁrst
the Communists and then other sections of the anti-imperialist
and anti-monopoly peoples movement—can they hope to suc-
ceed in their un-American war conspiracy. .

It is true that we Communists advocate and ﬁght for th

' restoration of Big Three unity and for the closest friendship

13

 

...~ -..+.........

with the Soviet Union. For we know that the common inter-
ests of our people make possible and require the peaceful co-
operation of the United States and the Soviet Union, and that
without this, world peace is impossible.

We Communists have no desire to see an “invincible”
American army ﬁght for the world hegemony of Dollar Diplo-
macy and meet the terrible fate which awaited the “invincible”
Nazis on Soviet soil. We American Communists want to save
our country and the world from catastrophe, and we ask you to
join our ranks and to work together with us to preserve the
peace and assure. democratic advance.

We Cotnmunis-ts would have our nation seek friends and
allies among the peace-loving states and peoples everywhere.
We would have it collaborate with the U.S.S.R. for mutually
advantageous friendly relations and a long-term peace, and
thereby protect world peace and the national security of the
American people. .

,We would have our nation help to put out, through the
machinery of the Security Council, the ﬁres of war already
smouldering in China, in Spain, in Indonesia and Greece——
instead of helping the American and British imperialists insti-
gate and promote these dangerous ﬂames.

We would have our government protect the security of our
country by adhering to the Big Three coalition policies of
Franklin Roosevelt, instead of endangering our national safe-
ty and our civil liberties by setting the pace in a world-
wide armament race and playing power politics with the atom
bomb.

Unfortunately, the Truman Administration is moving fur-
ther and further away from these policies of Ameri_can—Soviet-
British unity which were agreed to and practiced by President
Roosevelt and ‘approved by a majority of the American people.
Likewise we note that the most rabid war-mad American im-
perialists and their impatient reactionary Republican spokes-
men are not satisﬁed with the speed at which the Truman
Administration moves against the peace of America and the
world.

Because this is so, labor and the common people must unite
and muster their concerted efforts to resist and counteract

14

 

 

%

the imperialist course of the Truman Administration. They
must defeat the aggressive, war-inciting, anti-Soviet plots of
Taft, Vandenberg, Hoover and du Pont. They must elect a
strong win-the-peace Congressional bloc in 1946 and keep a
war-mongering president out of the White House in 1948.

These are not impossible tasks. World War II could have

been prevented if the policy of the Munichmen, of the impe-

rialist war-instigators had been defeated, and if the policy of
collective security against the fascist war-makers, championed
by the Soviet Union and supported by the advanced workers
and anti-fascists of all countries, had been adopted and carried
out in time. World I/Var III can be checked, if the people of
the world are aroused and act speedily, in unison, in a resolute
struggle against the imperialist war-makers, for peace.

However, America’s millions have still to be alerted and
moved into common action. Above all, the American labor
movement must wake up to the war danger so that it may
unite and lead the people's mass movement for peace. Ameri-
can labor must overcome the split in its own ranks and pre-
sent a solid front against the proﬁteering trusts, against the
warmakers.

The C.I.O. is already allied with the World Federation of
Trade Unions, and thus can act in concert with the organized
workers of all lands against every threat to peace. The army of
70 million trade unionists, joined in the W.F.T.U.—if united
in anti-imperialist and anti-fascist actions——is a formidable
force for peace.

The World Federation of Trade Unions thus can become
a powerful world center of the most consistent and strongest
peace forces. This center must be strengthened through full
American support, through A. F. of L. as well as C.I.O. par-
ticipation. The VV.F.T.U. was forged for use, and it must be
reinforced and used now, or it will become as impotent as was
the late and unlamented I.F.T.U.

This great industrial center of Cleveland gave a magniﬁcent
account of itself as a producer of weapons for the war which
brought victory over the fascist Axis. The credit for this does
not go to the “Cleveland group” of Big Business which proﬁted

I5

‘hugely from war production, but to theworking people of

Cleveland. .

Decades ago, in the days of the old Socialist Party, when
we spoke of the “Cleveland group,” we did nothave in mind
Youngstown Sheet 8c Tube or Goodyear Rubber. We meant
Charles E. Ruthenberg and the Left—wing Socialists who
showed the way to struggle against the ﬁrst imperialist war in
1914-18. 3 ' .

The militant working class and anti—imperialist tradi-
tions of the Left-wing Socialists and trade unionists are
part of the heritage of our Communist Party, and the anti-
fascist and anti-war spirit in Cleveland has deep roots. I am
sure that you Cleveland comrades, together with the rest of
the workers and progressives of the United States, will play
a big part in the growing American people’s movement to stop
World War III. ‘ “

The people’s victory over fascism has enhanced the great
proletarian traditions of May Day. Our American May Day is
more than ever a day of international labor solidarity. Let us
here pledge ourselves to strengthen the power and organiza-

\ tions of the working class in our own country and throughout .

the world.

Let us build and unite the trade unions, reinforce the soli-
darity of labor and of all anti-imperialists, and develop
to the maitifrﬁjgri the independent political action of labor and
all progressives! ' 4 '

Let us make of our own American Communist Party—the
Marxist party of the working class, the party of peace, progress
and socialism—a stronger ﬁghting mass party of mass action!

This is the way today that we Communists can -best unite
and serve the interests of America’s common people and of

A ourcountry. This is the way we can help stop World War III 1

and promote a peaceful world. This, too, is the way we can
now most effectively advance national freedom, democracy and
social progress everywhere. I ‘V ’

To these great democratic and working class aims, we Com-
munists rededicate ourselves on this May First, 1946.

PEACE OR WAR
THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE WARMAKERS

By Eugene Dennis

IXTY years ago the American labor movement dedicated
S May First to advance its struggle for the eight-hour work-
day. The Hearsts and Girdlers of that time charged that this
was a sinister plot, hatched here in the Middle-West by radicals.
And the rulers of Europe accused the American Federation of
Labor, which launched the movement for a shorter workday, of
being “subversive."

But before long the workers of the world adopted the Ameri-
can May Day and made it a day of international labor solida-
rity and struggle.

When Hitler and Mussolini began to prepare for World
War II, they revised history and condemned May Day as an
invention of the Russian Bolsheviks. They set out to extermi-
nate the revolutionary traditions and organizations of the
working class, in their own lands and those they conquered.

But on this May Day, 1946, the streets of a world at peace,
from Moscow to Paris, from Yenan to New York, thunder
proof that the organizations of the working class are
indestructible, and sound a warning to those who still hope to
succeed where Hitler and Mussolini failed. The trade unions
and working class political parties are demonstrating that
working class unity and organization, guided in struggle by
Marxist science, are the bulwark of a nation's defense and the
guarantors of its progress.

The barbarous war of the fascist incendiaries exacted a toll
of more than 22 million human lives. But the ﬁghters for free-
dom did not give their blood in vain. They crushed Hitler's
Axis and the Nazi and Japanese war machines. Today the peo-
ples of the world are determined to realize the anti-fascist and
national liberation aims for which they fought and won.

The economic royalists and imperialists, in the United States
and in Britain, will not ﬁnd it easy to rob the peoples of the
fruits of victory. Herbert Hoover may try to barter bread for
freedom—but the new democracies of Europe will not be black-
mailed out of existence. Winston Churchill can escape presid-
ing over the liquidation of‘ His Majesty’s Empire, but the
British imperialist system of colonialism and Oppression canno
escape eventual liquidation. I - _ ‘
Today’s Munichmen continue to plot against the Soviet
Union—but the great Socialist State keeps on growing stronger
every day. Wall Street and the City of London combat the
economic demands and the democratic aspirations of the

A American and British people, but the popular and democratic

movements of our people become more insistent and powerful.

Yet, it should not be forgotten that the power—mad America
Firsters, together with their counterparts in Britain, called the
anti—’Hitler war the “wrong war.” Now they and the American
Century crowd are preparing to launch their “right war.” They
are raising a new slogan, “Our world, or none.” _

For that slogan, the imperialists of our own country demand
that the Truman Administration risk the very life of our
nation in a third world war. For that slogan, the British Tory,

I Winston Churchill, and the reactionary Social-Democrats, led

by Ernest Bevin and Clement Attlee, are willing to starve and
enslave the last European and to ﬁght to the last American.

The facts of the matter are-—American-British preparations I

for World War‘ III are going forward swiftly.

A de facto American-British imperialist -bloc is trying to run
the United Nations Security Council,_and to nullify the great
principles set forth in the U.N. Charter. James Byrnes, Edward
Stettinius and Sir Alexander Cadogan pressure the small pow—
ers with economic bribes and political threats. '

As counsel for the defense in the case of the people vs.‘ dicta-
tor Franco, the ﬁrm of Byrnes and Bevin argue for “non-inter-
vention” in the spirit of the bankrupt and discredited League
of Nations. I .

But as self-styled prosecutors of the Soviet Union, they are

insistently demanding energetic and provocative action by

the Security Council against the U.S.S.R. over the Iranian issue

4

 

 

 

 

which the imperialists have manufactured into a veritable
international “crisis.” And even after the Iranians and the
Russians have both insisted that the “case” of Iran is not a
dispute and should be dropped from the agenda of the Council,
Byrnes and Bevin still cry that the Soviet Union is “guilty.”

Sometimes Byrnes and Stettinius get tired of the role of prose-
cuting lawyers and use the Council table as a pulpit, from
which they preach sermons against the sin of “unilateral ac-
tion.” By their deﬁnition, any nation which acts without U. S.
permission is guilty of acting unilaterally.

But what the U. S. does on its own is called “sovereign i.nde~
pendence,” or “world leadership.” However, there is much to
be said about America’s actions, singular and plural—albeit,
usually unilateral.

By the virtual unilateral decisions of the United States
government, the American flag is ﬂying today over 1,275,000
American troops garrisoned in foreign outposts in some 56
countries. And these outposts include a series of strategic
operational outposts encircling the U.S.S.R., stretching from
Iceland, to Arabia and China. .

By unilateral American decision, the wartime staffs of the
U. S. Army and Navy, as well as the combined Anglo-American
Staffs, are still intact. A trained reserve of nearly 12 million
ﬁghting men is available, and according to unofficial War
Department estimates, could be fully mobilized for combat
duty in 30 days under the President’s still effective war powers.

The United States asks permission‘ of no one to continue its
monopolistic control of manufacture and stockpiling of huge
quantities of atom bombs with which to wage a sudden war of
aggression to back up its claims to world domination.

Contrary to its sermons about the need of concerted action
by the United Nations, the“U.S.A. acts unilaterally and as an
aggressive imperialist interventionist in the internal affairs of
China, the Philippines and Puerto Rico. In China, for
instance, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government, backed
by the U.S.A., is now provocatively violating the recently con-

. cluded Kuomintang-Communist unity pact. It is plunging the

Chinese nation into renewed civil war so as to prevent, the
uniﬁcation of China on an independent and democratic basis.

5 ,

 

The ﬁres of the Kuomintang-instigated civil conﬂict are being
fed by U.S. armaments, economic and political aid, and
bolstered by the maintenance of U.S. troops and garrisons on
Chinese soil. The renewal of large-scale civil war in China,
with increasing American intervention, now threatens to in-
volve the U.S.A. directly as a military participant and thus
endangers the unity andtwelfare of China and the peace of
the Far East and the world.

The State Department, together with Downing Street, is
interfering unilaterally and bilaterally, in a reactionary way,
in Bulgaria, Italy and Austria. And the American and
British statesmen are trying to shape the pending peace
treaties with the former Axis satellite countries along lines
favorable to the reactionaries of those countries and to Anglo-
American imperialist interests, and conducive to the eventual
creation of a new cordon sanitaire against the Soviet Union.

The budget for this postwar year of 1946-47 calls for a war
appropriation of 15 billion dollars—13 billion for the direct
use of the War and Navy Departments-—for the preparation or
waging of a third World War at an early date. This is more
than twice the 6 billion spent for war and defense purposes
in 1940-41.

And this is the pay-off: This colossal American war arma-
ments program is combined with feverish efforts to salvage the
remnants of fascism in every corner of the world so as to
advance the interests of American imperialism.

In Germany, the American military government acts to di-
vide the German working class parties, to retain Nazis in posi-
tions of authority, to resurrect the economic war power of the
German cartels and monopolies. 4

In Japan, the premature Japanese elections engineered by
General MacArthur, without approval of the Far Eastern Com-
mission of the United Nations, have given a specious legal sanc-
tion to the continued rule of the Japanese fascist-militarists
and Zaibatsu. _

This is the inexorable logic of the “right” war, for which
the America Firsters and the Cliveden Set prepared while they
sabotaged and sat out the anti—Axis war against fascism. And
this leads, today, to an Anglo-American imperialist alliance

6

 

 

against the Soviet Union and all that is progressive in the
world.

The drive towards an anti—Soviet war, towards World War
III, is Robert Taft’s and Henry Bricker’s kind of war, and
Herbert Hoover's and Arthur Vandenberg’s kind of war.
These darlings of American imperialism still regret Hitler's
defeat. They are striving to wipe out the victory of the anti-
Axis coalition. '

I hope the citizens of Ohio will not think I am abusing their
hospitality when I say frankly that we Americans do not want
this warmongering, isolationist G.O.P. gang in the Senate of
the United States, where there are already too many advocates
of a third world war.

I am sure the people of Ohio will exert every effort to retire
these pied-pipers of reaction and war to private life. For the
people of Ohio, and the people of the United States, want no
part of a third world war. The American people are strongly
anti-imperialist and desire peace.

That is why the gentlemen of Wall Street are trying to dis-
guise their quest for world rule and their anti-Soviet war
preparations as a “moral” crusade, and are trying to conjure
out of thin air the bogey of a “Red imperialism.”

We Americans are not supposed to recognize the plunderous
American and British oil interests as the real threats to Iran’s
sovereignty. We are to be blinded by a “Red” mist, in which
the Socialist Soviet Union is made to appear as an “aggressor.”
When the alleged victim is introduced as “poor little Iran,”

we are not supposed to remember that at an earlier Munichite

performance it was “poor little Finland.”

When Uncle Sam and John Bull rush to the “rescue" of the
new democracies in Eastern Europe, we are not supposed to
understand that they are trying to resurrect a decadent feudal-
reaction and to save Anglo-American international cartel in-
vestments. Nor are we supposed to realize that when they
shout that the Soviet Union is “bolshevizing” these countries,
that in reality the Soviet Union is blocking a revival of fascism
and is helping these new republics with neighborly aid in
starting a new democratic life. I

However, the American people are not so dumb. They

7

 

  

are skeptical of the State Department’s newly acquired love for
“freedom.” They have begun to see through the democratic
pretensions of a Senator Connally or a Vandenberg, and will
distrust them as the champions of “democracy.” They re-
member that the Vatican, which calls for the defense of
“Christianity against Communism,” did not do ~ so well

“as the defender of the Catholics against Hitler, and even

made an alliance with the other anti-Christian, Hirohito.
They are becoming suspicious of those Democrat and G.0.P.
“anti-imperialist” builders of an American empire who show
such an affection for Winston Churchill.

And in view of the a-tom-bomb diplomacy of the United

States, its reneging on the Potsdam and Moscow agreements, x

its obstruction of the denaziﬁcation and demilitarization of
Germany, its anti-Soviet intrigues, and its sinister preparations
for another world war—the American people will view with
more than skepticism the current proposal of Secretary Byrnes
and Senator Vandenberg to establish a Four Power 25~year
Pact allegedly "to disarm and control Germany.

In order to “condition” the American people for an im-
perialist war of aggression and aggrandizement, and to carry
through their reactionary and proﬁteering attacks within the
country—the predatory trusts and their ﬁfth columnists are
striving to divide the people, one from another. But it is

- no longer quite so easy to set the American people against

each other, as the warmongers plan and incite. The re-
turning vets recall labor’s part in speeding demobilization,
and are not so prone to join in attacks against labor. The
search ‘for a place to live is a common bond, and it leads to a
search for those in high places guilty of sabotaging the hous-
ing program. Negroes and whites, Jews and Gentiles, have
marched together recently on a hundred picket lines and
therefore the poisonous Negro-baiting, anti—Semitism and Red-
baiting of the ﬁfth columnists are not “catching on” as easily
as in former years.‘ .

Nevertheless, if the people are to avert another world war
and to halt the reactionary offensive ofthe monopolies on the
home front—they must zealously guard and greatly strengthen

the unityof action of C.I.O. and A. F. of L. workers, of the

/8

 

 

 

 

 

veterans and farmers with labor, of the Negro and white toilers, _
of Communists and non-Communists, of all progressives and
' anti-imperialists-—young and old. And they must decisively

reject and combat the demagogy and the reactionary and divi-
sive moves of John L. Lewis, of Reuther and Dubinsky, of the
Trotskyites and Social-Democrats. They must forge the widest,
militant, united action of labor and the people, and a broad,
anti-imperialist peace front against the'reactionary program
of the monopolies abroad and at home. ‘ '
If anybody doubts that the American people can be ‘aroused
and mobilized to stop World -War III, let ‘him look at how
they have responded to the action of Congress on the extension
of the draft, on the May-Johnson atomic bill, and on the scrap-
ping of price control. The American imperialists- and trusts
are not going to ﬁnd it easy to get away with this reactionary
Congressional mobilization for war and with this additional
boost in the cost of living. The enemies of the people are
not going to ﬁnd it so easy to get away with this slashing of
the wage increases won in bitter strike struggles, with this
devaluation of war bond savings, with this robbery of the
old age pensioners and of the veterans’ separation pay and
gdisability compensation. ~
The American people are ﬁghting inad—mad at the N.A.M.
and the trusts, and at their reactionary bloc of Republican and
Southern Bourbon hatchetmen in Congress. If President Tru-
man feels like talking “tough,” let him start talking tough to
Congress. If Truman wants to exert “world leadership,” let
him begin by taking the lead for the restoration of O.P.A., for
maintaining the N.L.R.B., for establishing the complete con-
trol of the U.N. Security Council over the atom bomb, and for
breaking diplomatic and economic relations with Franco Spain.
We Communists know, as a matter of scientiﬁc fact, that
monopoly capitalism itself is ever the breeder and instigator
of imperialist war. We know that the giant_of American im-
perialism is aﬂlicted with sharpening internal contradictions,

' and is built upon the shifting sands of the world system of

capitalism which was greatly weakened by the anti-Axis war.

The ver “stren th” of U. S. mono 1 ca ital is its weak-
Y _ _8 R°Y_ P

ness, and drives it to seek world domination and hence war.‘
