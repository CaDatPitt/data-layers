it  ‘T1’-emon Six’ trial’
A terror in a top hat?

'By Herb Lerner

Regional director

‘ _ I attended the trial of the “Trenton
Six” at the,Mercer County Courthouse
in Trenton one day last week. i

In a trial which has already been go-
ing eight weeks, and will continue for
at least several weeks more, you can
only get to hear a small fragment of
the entire case in any one day.

 But you get‘ some pretty sharp im-
pressions even in a few hours. ‘

Theilives of six men are at stake.
Those men sitting there behind the

. lawyers, listening to every word-—those
six men will be burned to death with
an electric current _if the Jury declares
they are guilty. Those sixmen are all
Negroes. But the Jury is all white}

How come, you ask yourself, in a city
among whose citizens are thousands of
Negroes, that not a single Negro is on
the Jury? And then you find out that
the Prosecutor arranged it that way.
Of eleven Negroes who were on the
Jury Panel, he refused to accept a
single one! D‘ ~
_ AND WHY, you ask yourself, does
the Prosecutor object to so many ques-
tions by the Defense Counsel who is
questioning the Police who arrested

' the six" men and got “confessions” out
of them? Why does the Judge, small
and bald and wrapped in hisglrmg ju-
dicial robe, sit in his big chair and
keep sustaining all the’Prosecutor’s obi-
jections, so that the Iquestions cannot
be asked or. answered’? _

Why ‘do Policemen on the witness
stand keep looking at the Prosecutor
before they answer a question by the
Defense? How do they manage to re/-
member so clearly, three years after-
ward,'that they can repeat theirstories
word for word? ' ~

Why did the police sergeant laugh \as
he answered “No” to the questions as
to whether anyone had told the men
that they hada right to see a lawyer
before they signed the “confession”. _

TWO DAYSBEFORE I attended the
trial, the Judge had ruled that two of
the men were so obviously drugged by
the Police at the time the “confessions”
were signed, that the “confessions” of
these two defendants could not be sub-
mitted as evidence. But.if it admitted

' that the Police deliberately drugged

_ WASHINGTON,‘D. C.-—Interlocking

directorates of 1,000 U. S. corporations

- and 350 banks and insurance companies

constitute a real and growing threat in

American industry. That charge is

as made in a report ‘just made to Congress
by the Federal Trade Commission.

Corporations’ are tied together by.

“interlocking directorates” when a

board member of-one company also sits .
on the board of 'directors_,hf another »

company.' , .
Th_e handful of bankers and indus-
trialists who central thefood industry

threaten to wipeiout‘ competition en-V

tirely, the report said. And the menace
also extends to the non-ferrous metals
industry. a

The section of the report dealing.

with our industry said “the non-few
rous metals industry was clzaracterized
' by multiple indirectinlerlocking "relax-
_ ~. tions among companies within the in-
‘ ,_ dustry, principally through financial
institutions (banks) -butialso through

two men in order to get them to sign
false “confessions,” how can anyone be-
lieve that the.other four “confessions”
are perfectly okay? __ ’
These _so-called “confessions” are’ the
entire case of the Prosecution. Not a
single shred of evidence, other than
these “confessions,” has been produced

by the Prosecutor to link» these men «

with the murder of which they are ac-
cused. ‘ ,. p _ .

And behind this legal looking pro-
ceeding lies the most inhuman cruelty

imaginable. For a long time the six .

men were held in the Mercer County

“Death House,” a row of cells directly

connected with the electric chair. As a
result of the first trial (which was
later thrown out by the Supreme Court
as an unfair trial) an execution date
was set. The prison guards prepared
the men for electrocution on that date.
MEANWHILE, lawyers on the out-
side had submitted an appeal to a high-
er court, and the‘ execution date was
postponed. But not one single person’
in that prison had the simple human
decency to tell the six men that they

would not be executed on that day! ,
They were allowed to live through that‘, V
 day expecting to be electrocuted at any i
 moment! . '

As I sat in that courtroom watching
the legal-appearing cover-up for a cruel
and inhuman (frame-up, I could not help
remembering pictures I have seen of
executions in Hitler Germany.

Executions ordered by Hitler’s courts
used to be carried out 'by chopping off
the victims head with a large axe. The
chief executioner-was a degenerate, in-
human brute! But at each execution he
was dressed in a top’ hat, full dress

a suit, and white gloves. -It was an at-

tempt to make it appear that the mur-

der of the victim was really a civilized

proceeding. It was terror in a top hat.

Suipren,1e.lCou°rt slap at ‘subve1°Sive’
l list is gain for civil liberties

V‘VASHINGTON—-The U. s. Supreme
Court ruled last week that the US:

Attorney General acted illegally when i

he placed three organizations on his

socalled. “subversive” list. The three
organizations promptly hailed the high
court’s ruling, whic‘ placed the legal-
ity of the entire “attornr general’s
list” in doubt. '

-Dr. Mark Straus, chairman of the
Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee,
said “for us and for millions of Ameri-
cans, it reestablishes the democratic
right to be uncompromisingly anti-
Franco. It restores the right to be anti-»
fascist even though, in the case 0

-Franco Spain certainly, the administra-

tion seems to be headed in duite the
opposite direction. .,
“Thoughtful Americans can hardly

fail to realize the enormous damage
to our democracy which the U. S. at-
torney general’s listing by ukase al-
ready accomplished," Straus added.

Dr. John Kingsbury, chairman of the
National Council of American-Soviet
Friendship, said the court had taken
“a long overdue step toward upholding
the constitutional rights of American
organizations working for democracy
at home and peace in international re-
lations.” V ' V

The International Workers Order, a
21-year-old fraternal society, said the
court “vindicated our 2-year fight
against the arbitrary and unconstitu-
tional listing by the attorney general.”

All the other‘ organizations on the
socalled “subversive list” were expected
to open court action to have their
names removed quickly. '

" ernment, and is not supposed to have ,

The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) figures on the cost
of living are a frauddesigned to hold down the wages of American

workers.

That’s the major conclusion reached by the research department
of the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers after a detailed
and exhaustive study of the BLS Consumers Price Index made public
last week. The study took over four months to complete and makes
0 extensive use of statistical data issued by other government-agencies

and industrial sources to expose the distortions and inaccuracies in

the BLS index.

UE’s own calculations show that the .

cost of living of‘the_ average American
worker has increased at least 162%

. since 1939, while BLS figures claim an '

increase of only 83%s ~ 7
The fact that government “defense”

’ agencies and employers are now using

the BLS. index as a device for-freezing
wages, says UE, “makes the falsity of
BLS calculations of great importance
to all worlcing people.”

The UE study proves that even
though BLS is an agency of the gov-

any; prejudices at all, its figures are

I ‘ actually distorted in favor of big busi-

ness and against “the worker and con-
sumer. ’

UE has demanded all Congressional

‘ probe of the Labor Department index

and is demanding that stabilization of-
ficials in Washington be restrained
from using BLS figures as a basis for

wage regulation.

2 How BLS ‘lags’   I

This table shows how the .UE’s cost-
of-living index differs from that of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics on
every key item.‘ UE figures are based
on published goiiernment and indus-
trial statistics. Both UE and BLS
indexesset 1989 costs at 100.

‘I. It does not take account of

changing living requirements ~

which increase living "costs.
Changes are constantly being made

' in the social standard of living. Home

-radios, for example, once regarded as a
luxury, afe now a social necessity.
The BLS includes such items in its in-

dex, btit in such a way as to make N0 V

allowance for the higher cost of these
items.

2. ~ The official index does not use
items which typical.‘ wage
earners buy.

The index is supposedly based on the

buying’ habits of moderate income
groups; actually it’s based on typical

purchases of higher income_ groups.

Since typical items bought -by workers

have gone up in price much faster»

than items included in the index, the
effect has been to play down the actual
increases in living costs.

The BLS food index, for’ example,
prices the rich man’s items—-prime" rib
roast and round steak—but excludes
the poor man’s items--beef -liver and
plate and navel. Here's what happened
to prices of these items in New York
City since 1939:

Included:
Prime rib roast ........ ..up 174%
Round _steak ............ ..up 203% _
’ Excluded:
- Beef-liver. .................. ..up 256%
Plate and navel ........ ..up 231%

Similarly, the index gives almost as
much weight to women's fur coats-—
which very few workers’ wives can af-
ford to buy——as it does to plain woolen
coats." Fur coats wentup in price, but
not as much as cloth coats jumped.

_ 3. ,BLS..does not take quality de-

terioration into account.

Manufacturers, ‘particularly in times ‘

of growing shortages and rising prices, ’_

cheapen the quality of goods in order
to conceal actual price increases. ‘I This
happened in World War II and is now

Example: In February 1939 Bohack’s in New York sold
Grade A large “Plymouth” eggs at 27 cents, Grade B at 22
cents a dozen. In .March, 1951, it sold the same large Grade
A eggs at 67 cents, Grade B at 63 cents. The Grade A eggs

Contrary to popular belief, the. index

.is not simply a matter of averaging

prices from month to month: The fig-
ures are manipulated -in various ways
to combine them into index numbers.

The index is determined by thousands r

of judgments made eachimonth by BLS
statisticians. Says UE: “In almost
every case where the exact character

of BLS manipulations and shifts can '

be determined’ from published data,

_ they are revealed- to have the effect of

making the index lower.’’

‘‘ To show how BLS manipplations
work out, the UE study makes a com-
parison of reported price changes for

-80% in 5 years

Take a look at the food basket listed
below. It’s the kind of food every
family buys. The basket cost $9.13 in
1946—before OPA was junked.

On April 14, Mine-Mill staff mem-
bers in New Jerse_', shopped at’ A&P
stores in Perth Amboy, Cr‘ eret, New-
ark and Trenton. They found that the
same food basket now costs $16.88-an
jncrease of 80% over 1946. The figures:

E N‘ FORU M  

 

To the Editor: .

This is a letter that we sent today
to Senator Lyndon Johnson of Texas:
“Dear Senator Johnson:

“On April 25, you replied to an ear-
lier letter that we wrote you on in-
struction from the membership of this
local union about wage and price con-
trol. Earlier we expressed to you our

llopes that you and other people in .

congress would control prices and
leave wages open to free collective
bargaining when the present law ex-
pires.

“In your letter received here yester-

day, you said that in your judgment.

if we are to control prices, we must
also fix wages. Senator Johnson, we
have decided to write you more about
our problems here. Our members work
for the National Lead Company. We
work in a Smelter that produces anti-
mony. The company gets its ore from

I mines that it owns, and‘ from other

mines in Mexico. At the present time

‘there isn't much work for our mem-

bers. There are - about 50 men that
get to work a 32 hour week. Over 200
other members .are laid off because
there is no more ore. These people
have to take work as farm laborers,

etc., around the area and compete with .

other-farm labor that comes across the
river. You know how much cheaper

, these people can work or do work than

a man can that must live on this side of

the: river and support his family. This

puts very much hardship on we citizens
on this side. i ' K

“In a recent publication of the B.L.S.,
the Government figured that a family
of four ‘people should make in the

neighborhood of $3600, per year .to live ’

in a moderate standard of health and
decency in this section of the United
States. Under present conditions a
member of our union that works for
National Lead as a common laborer in
the Laredo plant makes $35.84 per week
if he is lucky enough to get 32 hours
work. That’s just a little over one-half
-as the government. says we
should make for an adequate living if
we have only four in the family. Most
of us have seven or more in the family.

The company says that one reason

I it can't get more ore is that its ceiling

price is 42c per pound and that ceiling
prices of other plant in Idaho is 50c,
also that most of the ore from Mexico
is-going to England and other countries
to be processed. The company claims
that there would be more jobs if they
could sell their ore that has been re-
fined or smelted for a higher price,
also that we could get more money

-per hour. They made many millions of
' dollars profit last year. ~

“Senator, under the present wage
freeze program, we could get only
about 12% cents per hour wage in-
crease, even if the company were to

or even part of the answer. You

  oNoR.EssMAN- onnpp

make huge profits out of this opera-
tion. This would let-the com‘mon,labor-
er make $2,082.50 per year on the pres-
ent 32 hour work schedule, or would be
$1,517.50 per year short of what the
government says a family of four needs
to get along. This applies to the peo-
ple who are working—if we were to
get the 12%‘ cents an hour that can
be put into effect without approval‘
from WBS. It doesn’t take into ac-
count the people who aren’t able to
work in the plant at all.

“We don’t say that we have the
answer to all of the problems. We
wish that we did. But Senator, we don’t-
think that wage control is the answer
‘know
as well as we do that the big compa-
nies are making the largestprofits in.
the history of the country. They are
doing this while the small wage earner
is taking a beating at the,/expense of
big profits and financing the war pro-
gram. We don’t know of any company
that has ever given labor, whether or-
ganized or not, so much money that
it'_has worked itself into an economic
hardship. They just don’t operate that
way and you know that as well as we
do.

“It is therefore submitted that a
part of the answer to the crisis that-
most workers face——along with some
small business people and farmers—is
to remove all wage controls and leave
workers free to bargain as they, are
able. If, in the course of these events
you wouldn't feel that prices should be
’controlled (we disagree with your
thoughts in this matter) then it is sub-
mitted that the heavy tax load of the
nation to pay for the war program
and all of this heavy spending should
be placed on the big companies that
are making the super profits.

“We are rapidly losing all faith in
an administration that does not see
and meet the needs of the people. We
feel that by presenting our views and
problems to you and other people in

congress that there is no excuse for -

you not to realize what is going on
and take the necessary steps to safe-
guard and improve the standard of liv-'
ing in America.”

1 President Truman, a civilian, but head

\now it appears that the G.O.P. high

—— are as big, if not bigger liars than we’ .

‘To the Editor: ‘ _ 

K Everybody else is talking about the '
Truman-MacArthur thing, in barber-
shops, pool room, and even in Union
Hall. .

So I have decided to throw in my
penny’s worth, even though I don’t_
claim to be any crystal ball gazer.

In fact, the prime reason for my
Writing about Mr. Truman and Gen-

‘eral MacArthur is I like sticking my
neck out.

You now know the why and where-
fore, so here goes about Mac" and
Harry _‘

As I see it, the tug of war between

of ‘all our armed forces, and General
MacArthur, a five-star general in the _ ,y
army, has a deeper and more ominous .
meaning than a mere rift betweenjt-he‘
President and one of the generals serv-
ing under him.  

The whole question boils down to
who is going to shape America’s for-
eign policy. The civilian head of the ;
government or the army generals, and-
whether we are to prepare the way for ’ -
an armed peace or a war in China that
may last for the next thr~e hundred
years.

General MacArthur, a master strat-
egist in the art of war, but a babe in -
woods in the field of foreign affairs is,
or was, about to plunge this nation in-_
to an avoidable war through'his pres-
suring tactics. ;

On the other hand, Mac probably 
saw Harry as a timid soul, afraid of
both the Russian Bear and the British
Lion.

Then, too, the colorful general may
have the Presidential bee in his bonnet.
Strategists in the Grand Old Party
may have told him something as of

command is minus a ’52 candidate.-
They can't feel that Taft can win and‘ 
they are afraid of Driscoll. Republi- E
cans shouldn't worry tooimuch about 7 
that, for if Truman does not choose to." U f
run, and indications are that he won’t, _
the Democrats are just as badly off, 
even Bob Taft could win out‘ G.O.P.. 1
ticket if the Democrats came up with ‘
Harry Byrd or James Byrnes. '-
Seriously now, I am forced to side
with Mr. Truman in his actioniof re--7
moving General. MacArthur from the J
. Far Eastern command. Had he re- 
mainedlin control, it is my opinion that ‘ _
we would have been at war with Red, 
China within a period of less than two 
years. When that war would have , 
ended, it would take a God to tell. _ ,
Both_ Mr. Truman and Secretary 
Dean Acheson know that even if cir-
cumstances were favorable other than
the vast expanse of China-—the actions‘ ’
of our representatives in China, Japan ~ _
and other parts of Asia would preclude: 5
our winning a war in China. 1
Things would be different had w_e ,
carried into Asia the disarming and. e,.
captivating spirit of brotherhood and 
the qualities of tolerance. The Reds 
would never have gotten a foothold in  i
China if we had not carried prejudice,  .
hate and intolerance. I fear it is too 
late now to redeem ourselves. - ~
The Communists, are welcomed in
Asia because they not only promisethd 7? is
Asiatics something. They act like they .

’o'the§Editor: V _. ’ , / -
= would‘-‘like to take advantage of
the-privilege extended to all Mine‘-Mill
 jnembers to have their view: published
 -‘in thepaper regcrds some of the pres-
 fént-‘vday problems that affect all of the
‘workers and the country as a whole.
‘ It'is my opinion that Canadaishould
‘Hhave an’ army to defend.this country
min the case of __an attack, and in the
 case of an attack only. I do not think
our troops should be used on foreign
soil; also, they should not be in Korea.

.. On the question of"freezing wages,
 with the economy of Canada as it is, I
f -see no need for a wage freeze. The
j present wages of the workers on the
S -whole are far below the level that is
, needed to maintain a decent standard
{of living. I cannot support the freez-
 ing of prices at the highest price that
i has ever been known in history.

sultant reduced standard of living of
the workers, I cannot see that there is
any equality of sacrifice, especially
. when the profits of big -business are
— i at the highest point in history. I
It is my opinion that a war progr m
'  is not necessary, and if a war program
was necessary, then" there should be a
100 per cent excess profits tax.

On the question of world problems,
I think that there is no question that
4, cannot be solvedi by
I _;amongst all parties concerned. All of
', the United Nations forces should leave
,’ Korea, and then settle down t peace-
‘ ful negotiations on the Korean situa-
tion. - ~
1‘-‘On the recognition of China by the
‘United Nations, I feel that by the
present action in not giving China a
-position-in the U. N., it is _a yiolation
-of the United Nations Charter. Not
recognizing the present government of
China is one of the causes of ‘the
;t_r0ubled world situation. it

To the Editor:
I would like first to congratulate you
on the opening of the pages of our pa-

-per for the fullest debate and discus-
sion on the ‘central question ‘of our V

times-—is there to be peace or shall
we again feel the horrors of war.

I am writing you as a person active ‘

in tlie Peace movement in this country,
having just returned from the historic
Assembly to Save the Peace in Toronto,
the largest and most successful meet-
ing of its kind ever to take place in
our Dominion. The fact that -the com-
mercial press chose to exclude all men-
tion of it is typical of the efforts now
being made to blackout and smash
any and all opposition to war. -

We have really reached a frightful
state of affairs when a meeting of such
scope and breadth with more than 3000
delegates from every nook and cranny
of Canada ﬂakes place to discuss how

and in what way our country can be ~

spared from another war and the com-
mercial press not only blacks it out but
even tries to make it appear that any-
one who speaks and acts for peace is a
“Redl” “a foreign agent,” a muscovite
or any one of a dozen more slanders
thrown at us. '

Let us get straight on the red baiting”

of our Union. It isa trick of the low-
est kind and just as the bosses have‘
used to keep workers from joining our
Union. So many timesnow it is being

’used by war provoking and war profi-

teering element in the country. The
trick is the same. It is designed to shut
mouths and minds to cover

silence. /

In fact from what I can see it isn’t
aimed at the communists at all but at
every decent hyman being that today
refuses to have his country dragged

_ into war to protect the profits of ‘a

few millionaires with investments
abroad and on the same excuses and
program (anti —Bolshevism —— whatever
that is) that Hitler dragged the Ger-
man people down the sink of "history
with. . _
It so happens that I am not a com-

munist—not that I feel that that makes.

me any better particularly because I
am not one who condemns anyone for
his political.thinking—but I do say this
—if the communists stand and fight
forpegce to save this country and my
home fromruin then I will standwith
them-. And I_can’t help but feel that I
would be seventeen times seven kinds

of alfool if I surrendered the fight to‘

save this country and my home to them
alone. 

We know who makes wars. We had
two examplesof it in the last thirty
years and Heaven only knows how
many smaller examples. The people

that want wars are the people‘ who‘

make profits out ‘of them—it is as

OPEN Foﬂuil

simple as that. Certainly it is not the "
people that fight the wars that want

 them.

CCNGRESSMAN DR!PP ,

There appeared in the last issue of v .

the Union a letter from some brother ,
at Levack and supposedly a member
of our Local Union 598. All I can-say.
to this brother if he thinks peace can
be saved by building the very armies
and weapons, etc.,. etc., that are lused
to make war then I say in Heavens
sake smarten up and stop being victim-
ized by the people who are trying to
make us all dead -heroes and making
money out of that by threatening with
the red paint brush and stop using the
red paint brush yourself. ‘ I \
It’s a pretty tragic thing to see—a
working man using the very weapons
that were used against him for the
past hundred years and still not know-.
ing what he is doing. \ ‘A
Peace can be saved. It can be saved
because there ﬁre a lot more people in
this country and in the world that
want peace than there are that want
war. The only catch yet is that we’re
not too well organized yet. But brother
we will be. '
In conclusion letme make one thing
perfectly clear. As a veteran of the
2nd World War, Royal Canadian Regi-
ment, lst Div., I would join with every

_ other Canadian to defend this country

if we are attacked by any one. But
don’t let Mike Pearson or St. Laurent

-or anybody else try to convince me that

we are in danger of being attacked by
the Koreans or Chinese or the Rus-
sians. Nobody can convince me that no
matter_ what kind of Government they
have, that any people who just five
years ago finished burying one or
more from every family in the country
(as with the Russians) are going to go
to war unless they are forced to.

It simply doesn’t make sense whether
you agreeﬂthat Stalin is all he’s sup-"
posed to be or whether you think he's
the biggest world beater ever‘. Let’s get
back to sanity apd tell the people in"
our country that go around trying to
scare us silly bogey men that we are
not children and fmoreover‘ not scared.
Let's speak up forpeace and demand

it from every man and every goVern- I

me t of theypworld. Then we will have
peace for sure. 1

I will‘close with the conviction that \

Peace will Triumph over War.

Wlial union, label?‘ ‘

WASHINGTON-——'l‘he U. S. Chamber
of Commerce has demanded that “rep-_
resentatives of organized labor” take
off their union label when they step
into the mobilization setup here.

What union label?

The C. of C. is a couple of years be-

 to produce another $10.billioi1,ini_ost1y
A from low income brackets "and sales"

taxes. ‘ P -

,9 ON FOOD PRICE SUBSIDIES, the
ULPC had demanded them as a means
to pushing prices down. The President

' said vaguely that they might be needed,

but asked no authority to put them
into effect. .

ON CREDIT CONTROLS, all sec-
tions of organized labor‘ have pro-

.. tested their unfairness because they

affect only persons oflimited income.
Truman said they are wonderful and
asked for more.

In -view of this, a union member may

: well ask, “When were Murray, Green

and’ Reuther -representing me-—when
they walked out with a blast at the De-
fense Production Control Act, orwhen
they went back to lend their influence
to, passage of an‘ even worse Control
Act?" - l ‘

Some have interpreted the whole
performance as a sell-out scheme--a
maneuver to pacify union. members
whose anger over the wage-price-tax
squeeze is well known.

One thing, is definite: the only “gain”
for labor as a result of the whole
business was an increase in. the num-

bergof-advisory ._and wage board jobs .

held by “labor” people.. (See story, -this‘

WASHINGTON——Some light is cast

1 on reasons for return of “labor leaders"

to the mobilization setup ‘after their
‘frevolt” by the following:
Pres. George M. Harrison of the

Brotherhood of Railway Clerks (AFL),
who was assistant to Economic Stabi-

ylizer Eric Johnston, will become a top-
‘ level adviser to Wilson on}: par with

big'— business representative Sidney
Weinberg. Hts former post will be
taken by. Sec.-Tress. David McDonald
of - the United Steelworkers (CIO).
Pres. A. J. Hayes of the Int]. Assn. of
Machinists" (AFL) will return to his
duties as adviser to Asst. Defense
Sec. Anna M. Rosenberg.

The following were nominated for
labor posts on the new wage board:
AFL: Pres. Harry G. Bates, bricklay-
ers; Vice Pres. Elmer E. Waiker, ma-
chinists; Pres. William C. Birthright,
barbers; CIO: Pres. Emil Rieve, textile
workers; Pres. Joseph Bierne, commu-

nications workers; Vice Pres. John Liv- o

ingston, auto workers. . .
These jobs pay $25 to $50 a day, and

up. They involve prestige, visits to the

White House, high-priced dinners, pic-

tures in the papers. ’ '

Wage board blocking
increase for 3 million

WASHINGTON (FP)— -George W.
Taylor, newly sworn in as chairman

' of the new Wage Stabilization Board,‘ 0'

said April 27 that pay raises for three
million workers are being held up pend-
ing action by the board.

More than 800 appeals for action ;

have been filed, he said. They include
collective bargaining contracts agreed

. upon by management and labor, which

award workers wage boosts in excess.
of 10% above the level of January
1950. ‘ i '

. New'Nework ‘agreement

_ NEWARK, N. J.—-Contract talks be-

-tween Local 482 and Hudson Smelting

here have been completed with an.

agreement calling for a 5 cent hqurly
wage increase, retroactive to February
21. The pact carries a wage reopener
in August.

Murray rewrites history

ci.EvELAND,' Ohio—There was a

' great deal of, snickering among the

delegates when CIO president Philip
Murray made his speech to the United
Auto.Workers convention here. _
_ ,.Mu‘rray claimed, that when he took
over’./as president of C10, it “was dy-
ing-.” He said the CIO had only 1,123,-
000 members then—in November, 1940.
The snickering came from those
UAW members who attended the 1940
CIO convention—and who remembered

that when John ‘L.’ Lewis stepped down '

from the'CIO presidency, ‘it_was -al-.

. reildy a giant-- organization growing

i

g daily in size,and power. By then, the

major initial job» of organizing the
mass production and industries - had
been completed. ‘ T -

The CIO in November, 1940, included
‘the huge ‘ United Mine Workers, the
huge UAW, the big Steel union, the ,
giant UE, the Textile Workers, Amal-

gamated Clothing Workers, Oil, Glass,_ A

and Mine-Mill—all very big unions. .

. Their membership totalled many times. i

EL PASO, Tex.—At the El Paso
plant of the South Western Portland
Cement Co., there are about 200 cm: .
ployees. Of these, about _160 Mexican-1, ,

‘Local 903. The rest are Anglos and, 
only four Anglos in the entire plant “
are members,of our Union.

At the plant, the company has estah- . . . -
lished a practice ever since it has been
in operation, to segregate the Mexican-
Americans and Anglos. There’ are difu _
ferent showers and‘ toilets in a sepc  0
aratc locker room for botii A groups.
Neither group must go into the toilets ‘ l t .-
or showers of the other group, because‘ ~ ..
that line is there. A . 1

Brother Rafael Chavez has been an:-3,:
employee of the company for about
seven or eight months and he ignored 
the segregation. When on April 6, ho , _
was in a great hurry to use a toilet, 
he went to use one of. the ‘toilets in7 
the Anglo locker room. He’ did not 
stop to use one on the Mexican-Amer-  ,_
ican side because they were all beizrgfﬂl 9'
used. ‘ , 

The general foreman came and told _
Brother Chavez to get out. So Brother
Chavez was forced to leave. ‘ ' ~i- ‘» "A
' Brother Sedillo, chairman of the
grievance committee, and J. R. Fuentes, ., "
president of the local, heard about ~the']- .
incident four days later. They at once ._ ‘ ' "
took the grievance up with the general "
foreman. Nothing was settled in that

discussed with the superintendent of
the plant. s;'- _

After«one whole hour of discussing‘, C 
the incident, nothing satisfactory for 7 .
the Union had been settled. So the
only thing that remained t be done 
was to file a general grievance. The 
entire membership of7Local 903 re- ;.
sents the attitude of the c_ompany.on 

_ do something about it. .
