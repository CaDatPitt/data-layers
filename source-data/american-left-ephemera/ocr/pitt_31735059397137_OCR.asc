October 20, 1970

Dear Friend,

The crucial events of the last few days do
not permit the luxury of continuing in "a business as
usual“ manner.

The arrest of Angela Davis on framed-up
preposterous charges and holding her without bail is
an effort to intimidate and stifle all movements who
are fighting the endless immoral war and the cruel
racism in the ghettos and barrios;

‘ And, the so-called Anti Crime Bill with its
no knock and the concentration camp provisions which
President Nixon signed into law with all pomp and
ceremony is an effort to establish a police state in
our country. More can be detailed, but neither time
nor space permit it.

Therefore, the 20th ANNUAL BANQUET to be
held on December 6, 1970 at the Biltmore Bowl will
be a protest rally against repression and for all
out defense of Angela Davis.

The times require that the 1,000 guests
that we are expecting becme a reality. Our defense
organization with its 20 years of experience and
dedication needs your support as never before, and you
need our organization.

MAKE YOUR RESERVATIONS NOW and see to it
that your organization is numerically well represented.
The times require a new sense of dedication and sacri-
fice if we are to beat back the ultra right assault
of the Nixon administration.

Incidentally, a very fine program has been
arranged and a fine dinner will be served.

We shall see you at the banquet.

Praternally yours,

‘ ‘.1! "I v . 1

Rose Chernin

P.S. Enclosed is a press release and an informational
card about the banquet.
