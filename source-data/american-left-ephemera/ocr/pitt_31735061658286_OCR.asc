IS PEACE TREASON?

Is peace treason? The ’man from Mars would judge so
both in 1920 and today by the remarks of American presi-
dents. When an unceasing ﬂood of messages urged President
Wilson to free Eugene Debs in 1920, he replied vindictively,
“This man is a traitor to his country and he will never be
pardoned in my administration.” This statement helped de-
feat the Democratic Party in 1920, and to roll up a vote of
920,000 for Debs, as Socialist candidate for President, although
he was unable to make a single speech or pen a campaign
appeal. He had replied to Wilson: “It is he, not I, who needs
a pardon. No man in public life ever retired so thoroughly
discredited and repudiated as Woodrow Wilson.” In reprisal
for this, Debs lost’ all his prison writing and visiting privi-
leges and was kept incommunicado until Wilson left the
White House, in March, 1921. =

In the midst of the F-0leySquare trial, regardless of time-
honored and decent concepts of a fair trial, President Harry
Truman publicly assailed Eugene Dennis as “a traitor.” To-
gether with William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist
Party-, Eugene Dennis had hailed peace declarations by the
Communist Parties of France and Italy and had reaﬂirmed
the determination of American Communists to ﬁght for peace.
If this be “treason”—who are the “patriots”?

Mr. Truman has since stated that he would order the use
of an atomic bomb again if he thought it was necessary, and
has authorized the development of the far more deadly super
Habomb. The ve-rdict of history on a President who used an
atom bomb on a civilian population is yet to be written. It
will be a stern judgment, especially if the ﬁrst bombs used are

not the last and if all such attacks “happen” to be against

the colored peoples of the world.
BOTH AGAINST BOSSES’ WARS
The lives of Debs and Dennis have much in common. Both

were born in working~class families of immigrant sto/ck——Debs
10

 

 

in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1855, and Dennis in Seattle,
Washington, a half a century later. Ancestors of Debs fought
in the French Revolution, in Colmar, Alsace. His father came
here in the revolutionary year of 1848. The grandfather of
Gene Dennis was a boilermaker and a Sinn Feiner, who ‘fought
to free Ireland and had to immigrate to America in the same
period. Poverty forced Debs and Dennis, like many others,
to go to work at an early age. Debs was a railroader at 16;
Dennis worked in logging camps and saw mills at the same
age.

By the age of twenty, these young workers, both over six
feet tall, were full ﬂedged union men—Debs a member of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Dennis of the A. F.
of L. Electric Workers Union. Debs was soon involved in
building the union and leading strikes. He often said, “I was
baptized in Socialism in the roar of conflicts.” Around Gene
Dennis, in his boyhood, the class struggle r-aged ﬁercely in
the Seattle area. There was the Everett massacre of I.W.W.’s
in 1916, the Centralia Armistice Day massacre in 1919, the
Palmer raids of 1919-1920 and the Seattle General Strike in
1919 against shipment of arms to Siberia to be used by Kol-
chak, a counter-revolutionary general, against the Russian
workers. In the camps Dennis was a member of the I.W.W.
(Industrial Workers of the World), of which Debs had been
a founder in 1905. For over two decades it led magniﬁcent
struggles of unorganized, unskilled, immigrant and migratory
workers against long hours and low wages, and was the target
of ferocious mob violence, persecutions and Red-baiting by
the employers and the government, similar to the attacks on
the Communists today.

Debs was ﬁrst imprisoned in Woodstock Jail in Chicago in
1895. With six others, leaders of the American Railway Union,
he was sentenced to six months in jail for contempt of court
because they continued a strike of 125,000 railroad workers
against the Pullman Company in deﬁance of a sweeping in-
junction. As he entered jail, Eugene Debs said: “In going to
jail for participation in the late strike, I have no apologies

11

  

   

to make or regrets to express. If it is expected that six months
or even six years in’ jail will purge me of contempt, the
punishment will fail of its purpose.” When Eugene Dennis
was offered a suspended sentence if he would purge himself
of contempt, by appearing -before the notorious Rankin-
T-homas Committee, he replied in words that rang with the
same brave deﬁance: “My liberty as an individual is, of course,

dear to me. But more dear to me is the liberty of the whole

American people.”

Gene Debs ﬁrst read Socialist literature in Woodstock Jail.
Victor Berger, later a Socialist Congressman and a victim of
war-time persecution in 1918, sent Debs a copy of Marx's
Capital. Gene Dennis read I.W.W. pamphlets in the camps,
and the Socialist Labor Party library of his Norwegian uncle
who was a great admirer of Debs and had all his pamphlets.
Later Dennis read Marx's Capital and other Marxist works,
including the pamphlets of Lenin, which were ﬁrst published
here after the Russian Revolution of 1917. Little did this
eager young worker, hungry for knowledge as to the causes of
poverty, exploitation and unemployment imagine that thirty
years later the very books he read by the Puget Sound would
be introduced as “evidence” against him by the U.S. gov-
ernment in a “conspiracy” trial in a New York courtroom.

Eugene Debs helped to form the Social Democracy of Amer-
ica, which merged into the Socialist Party in 1901. The Coim-
munist Party was born in 1919, when the Left Wing, who
were the majority in the Socialist Party and had led the ﬁght
against war, were expelled by the minority in the oﬂicial
saddle, with the aid of the Chicago police. Debs was in prison

at that time. Debs had spoken at Nimisilla Park in Canton, _

Ohio, on June 16, 1918 (during an Ohio State convention
of the Socialist Party), opposite the .Stark County Workhouse,
where party leaders were serving jail terms for opposing the
draft. They were Charles E. Ruthenberg, then Secretary of the
Ohio Party, later a founder of the Communist Party and its
ﬁrst General Secretary; Alfred Wagenknecht, also a charter
member of the Communist Party and’ a vigorous veteran
12

 

 

Communist leader today in Chicago, .and a young worker,
Charles Baker. His burning words of indignation ﬁred his
audience when he. told how their three comrades had been
strung up by the wrists, their feet barely touching the ground
—for demanding the rights of political prisoners.

Debs spoke also in defense of other wartime victi-ms of the
Espionage Act—Kate O’Hare and Rose Pastor Stokes, Bill
Haywood and the I.W.W. then on trial in Chicago. He spoke
of Tom Mooney in San Quentin Prison and Frank Little,
I.W.W. organizer lynched in Butte, and of terrible mob vio-
lence against Negro people in East St. Louis and against
strikers in Tulsa and Bisbee. The climax of his speech was a
blistering attack on the U.S. Supreme Court, “Why the other

day, by a vote of ﬁve to seven—a kind of crap game—come*

seven, come eleven——they declared the child labor law uncon-
stitutional . . . and this is our so-called Democracy, so that
we may continue to grind the ﬂesh and -blood of puny little
children into proﬁts for the junkers of Wall Street. The his-
tory of this country is being written in the blood of childhood
the industrial lords have murdered.”

FEDERAL JURIES STACKED THEN AS NOW

The Federal jury system was stacked then as now. The
twelve jurors who tried Eugene Debs in 1918 were retired
business men and farmers, averaging 72 years of age, and
worth ﬁfty to sixty thousand dollars each. In Foley Square a
“handpicked” jury system discriminated against low income
groups, the unemployed, foreign-born, union members and
residents of progressive voting areas. Nowhere is “a jury of
your peers” more impossible for a worker to obtain than in
the U.S. Federal Court.

THEIR OWN DEFENSE COUNSELS

Both Gene Debs in Cleveland and Gene Dennis in Foley
Square defended themselves, in a militant manner. In his mag-

13

  

niﬁcent speech to the jury, Debs said, “What you may choose
to do to me will be of small consequence. I am not on trial
here_. There is an inﬁnitely greater issue that is being tried in
this.court—though you may not be conscious of it. American
institutions are on trial here before a court of American citi-
zens. The future will tell.” He was found guilty and sentenced
to 10 years’ imprisonment.

At Foley Square, Gene Dennis said in his masterly summa-
tion in the trial of the 11 Communist leaders: “Whatever
be your verdict, we Communist leaders face the future with
conﬁdence in our Party, our class, our people, our country.
One way or another, we will continue to serve the cause of
y peace, democracy and Socialism to which we have dedicated
 our lives. One way or another, that cause will inevitably
5 triumph. For no one—no federal administration—can stop the
forward march of history. No one—no federal administration
 ——can stop the forward -march of the people. No one——no
3 federal administration—can kill ideas or imprison principles
5 and beliefs.”

l Flesh and blood of the American working class, animated
V, by a mortal hatred of capitalism and all its foul deeds, Debs
H’ and Dennis spokeboldly in the courts of their burning con-
i
l
I

 

tempt for class justice. When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
Debs’ conviction unanimously and one, a so-called “liberal,"
expressed his annoyance that letters of protest a-bout Debs, “a
noted agitator,” were pouring in, Debs ‘commented with
y magniﬁcent scorn, as he entered prison at the age of 64:
1 “The. decision is perfectly consistent with the character of
H the Supreme Court, as a ruling class tribunal. It could not
l have been otherwise. So far as I am personally concerned, the
'; decision is of small consequence. But there is an issue at stake
‘ of vital interest to the American people. It involves the funda-
mental right of free speech. With this [decision] our boasted
E freedom is a delusion and a farce. . . . Great issues are not
I‘ decided by the courts but by the people. I have no concern
1 in what a coterie of begowned corporation lawyers in Wash-
ll ington may decide in my case. The court of ‘ﬁnal resort is the

. 14

 

 

people and that court will be heard from in due time.”- ’

And that court, by a mighty mass movement, freed Eugene
Debs before he had served" one-third of his sentence.

Eugene Dennis, on -behalf of the entire group of Communist
defendants, spoke likewise boldly and bravely as follows, on
Oct. 21, 1949, the day of sentencing:

“This trial, and the verdict, is an evil and an illegitimate
product of‘ a bi-partisan conspiracy of men who want to
destroy the Bill of Rights and peace, and I think that the
adjudgment of counsel and ‘ the accompanying decision to
remand the defendants without. bail is in keeping with the
sinister and police state character of this trial.

“I don't think any democratic-minded American, and people
in other lands, will pass off lightly even the sentencing of the
lawyers which took place today because this is just the ﬁrst
fruits of the infamous verdict in this trial, but it will serve to
alert and to arouse our people as to their stake in what hap-
pened here. ’

“And I -would say to your Honor, in Nazi Germany, in’

Mussolini Italy, men also sat in high tribunals, also wore
black robes‘ and also handed down pro-fascist decisions; but
I would remind‘ the Court that the people reversed those ver-
dicts and decisions, just as our people will reverse the deci-
sions and the verdict in this case, and the people’s verdict will
be for peace, for democracy and for social progress.”

Many good people still have illusions that Supreme Court‘

Justices are other-worldly creatures, above the battle of eco-
nomic and political conﬂicts, immune from pressures or preju-
dices, nobly consecrated to uphold the Constitution. Their
recent decisions, bypassing a judgment on the "Un-American
Committee and on the Negro citizens’ voting ‘rights in
Georgia; upholding the anti-Communist‘ oath of the Taft-
Hartley law, and especially the reactionary opinion «of Jackson,

jwhich is in effect a preview of their decision in the Foley

Square appeal'—are like the Dredd Scott decision. They must
and will hear from the people, as their predecessors did on
many historic occasions, when the people. reversed their rul-
ings, or this appeal will likewise be by-passed.

THE AMNESTY CRUSADE

The amnesty crusade for all political prisoners announced
recently by the Civil Rights Congress is not the ﬁrst such
campaign in the U.S.A. At the end of World War I, over 877
political prisoners had been convicted—Socialists, I.W.W.’s,
trade unionists as well as religious conscientious objectors,
Irish and Indian nationalists. Many of the I.W.W. prisoners at
Leavenworth had twenty and ten year sentences, meted out by
Judge Landis in Chicago. Peace was ﬁnally ratiﬁed by the
Senate on November 14, 1921. The amnesty crusade had
increased to such proportions that even Sam Gompers, Presi-
dent of the A. F. of L., visited Debs in prison and pledged to
work for his release.

The culminating action on November 15 was a huge demon-
stration of war veterans outside the White House in Washing-
ton. “The ultimate justice of the .people—no better nor equal
hope in the world,” as Lincoln described it, spoke out
strongly from coast to coast, and cut short the barbaric sen-
tences _of World War 1. Eugene V. Debs and twenty others
were released at Christmas, 1921, by a decree of President
Harding. All others were released shortly afterwards. 30,000
people greeted Debs at the railroad station in Terre Haute,
Indiana.

The people’s verdict saved Tom Mooney from hanging and
ﬁnally secured his release. It saved Angel-o Herndon and the
Scottsboro boys from certain death and forced the Supreme
Court to reverse itself in both these historic cases. The people
can likewise veto the Supreme Court decision which gives its
blessing to the Un-American Committee to harass thousands
of Americans and jail those bold enough to defy their unlaw-
ful edicts. It can veto the Foley Square thought-control verdict
and repeal the Smith Act, which is permanent legislation-
not a temporary wartime measure, as was the Espionage Act
of 1917. I .

The historical periods after World War I and today are
different stages of political development. But the heroic role
16

 

 

of Eugene Debs and the Left-wing Socialists was a forerunner
of the historic role of Eugene Dennis and the Communist Party
today. Like a glowing red thread, their words and deeds run
through the struggles of the workers of both periods, ﬁghting
for freedom and peace against the same Wall Street capitalist
forces of exploiters and their political warmakers.

Eugene Debs is dead for many years. Three years in prison
took a heavy toll of his failing health. He came out a very
sick man and he never fully recovered. He died ﬁve years later
at the age of 71. Few recall the names of his prosecutor and
judge, or the Supreme Court judges of his day. Millions revere
the memory of Debs—great and militant agitator for the rights
of the people. Some who pretend to speak in the name of Debs
today, the Norman Thomases, Dubinskys, Reuthers, so-called
“Socialists,” who participate in the cold war, who Red-bait
the Communists, who are tied to the war chariot of the
Truman Administration, who create disunity in the American
and international trade—union movement, who betray every-
thing Debs stood for, would be repudiated by him as sharply
as were Soviet-baiters and war appeasers in 1917, who mas-
queraded then as “Socialists.”

Eugene Debs and Eugene Dennis never met, nor did the
young lum-ber—jack of Seattle ever hear the old railroader de-
liver one of his thundering orations. Eugene Dennis joined
the Communist Party in his native city of Seattle at the age of

22, shortly after the death of Eugene Debs. He recalls reading '

the Canton speech of Debs, which was widely circulated for
many years.

In the thirties when Eugene Dennis was Communist Party
organizer in Wisconsin, he and his wife Peggy became close
friends of Mrs. Meta Berger, and had an opportunity to spend
many hours in her home, browsing through the library of
Victor Berger, which contained all the writings of Eugene
Debs, many of them long out of print. The younger Gene and
his Party are the worthy inheritors of all that was best in the

militant Socialist traditions of Gene Debs, enriched now by '

a deeper and clearer knowledge of Marxism-Leninism than
was possible in earlier years.

17

   

  

Though the struggles are ﬁercer today, the working class
of the «world is much closer to_ the end of the rough road.
Emancipation from capitalism is at hand. “The Dream of
Debs,” as Jack London called Socialism, has become a world-
wide reality in the lifetime of Eugene Dennis. Eight hundred
millions of people are no longer living in a narrowing capital-
ist world -but in. a broadening Socialist world. Alarm and
hatred rose to a feverish pitch among the ruling classes around
the world in i917, when the overthrow of the tyrannical
Czarist rule in old Russia, “a prison of nations,” as Lenin
called it, gave birth to a Socialist Workers’ Republic. This
later became the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, a volun-
tarytassociation of these same nations, now free.

There is atmuch greater clarity as to what Socialism is, due
not only to the wide-spread theoretical knowledge of Marxism-
Leninism but also to the growing experience in its applica-
bility in the building of a new society. In 1917, when the
Bolsheviks were deﬁned by Debs in a generalization, “They
are bound upon the emancipation. of the human race,” there
was boundless enthusiasm everywhere for the victory of the
Russian workers and peasants, and the Socialist ideas they
espoused were eagerly studied by millions.

Delegations of trade unionists journeyed from the U.S.A.,.

Canada, England and European countries to bring them greet-
ings and to study their achievements. American soldiers, work-
ers from Detroit, mutinied in Siberia, refusing to ﬁght the
Russian people to put the Czar back, and were sent home.
A reign of terror was let loose here against the foreign-born,
in what was called, the “Deportation Deliriums” of 1919 and
1920. The Palmer Raids against all progressive organizations
—unions, fraternal clubs, political parties—were engineered by
the budding J. Edgar Hoover. A

Under the Smith Act for the last tenyears the Department
of Justice has harassed thousands of foreign-born men and 1

women, long-time residents of our country, parents of Amer-
ican-born children, threatening them with deportation. The

18.

 

blockade to starve the Russian people was the evil brain .

 

child of another professional Red—baiter, Herbert Hoover, who
is now busy trying to scuttle the United Nations. But the
making of history has been taken away from the kings, states-
men, bankers and landlords in ever-widening areas of the
earth’s surface by ever larger numbers of plain people, who
are on the march everywhere.

RULIIVG CLASS IITTERS

The ruling class has the jitters today, far worse than after
World War I. What Lenin said in 1920 applies even more
today: “Let the bourgeoisie rave, work itself into a frenzy,
overdo things, commit stupidities . . . acting thus the bour-
geoisie acts as all classes doomed by history have acted. Com-
munists should know that the future, at any rate, belongs to
them.” T-he forces of capitalism are fewer in numbers and far

. weaker on a world scale, though they may appear to be strong

in the U.S.A. Like a wild beast at bay in its dying agony,
capitalism is more desperate and dangerous on that account.

Especially is this true in its last stronghold, the U.S.A. In a
vain attempt to save their system, the American ‘billionaires
are ready to quench the torch of American Liberty, to colonize
other capitalist countries as bought and paid-for cannon-fodder
and to use the atom bomb in an attempt to annihilate mil-
lions of human beings who live under Socialism or aspire to
it. Let’s make no mistake as to the danger of irresponsible
adventurists like MacArthur, or cold-blooded reactionaries,
like Dulles, plunging us into another atomic world war. They
will if they can, and they can if the American people permit.

Never was the need of an organized and articulate American
mass peace movement more pressing than it is today. This was

the warning Eugene Dennis voiced -as he entered his prison a

cell, with full conﬁdence that it can and will be built. The
building of such a peace movement will help to free Eugene

Dennis and all other victims of the cold war. The building "

of a mass amnesty movement to secure their release is a

necessary part of the peace movement -today. They are one
and indivisible. This is why Eugene Dennis, speaking to his
wife at the West Street Detention House recently, said most
emphatically: “If the peace of the world is assured, the Gen-
eral Secretary of the Communist Party will not be kept in
prison. If peace is assured, there will be no cold warvictims.”

All Americans have a great political and moral responsi-
bility. Millions around the world demand peace‘. “Outlaw
the Atomic Bombs!” is their rallying cry. “Save the Peace!”
is the plea to us from workers, mothers, youths, intellectuals,
scientists everywhere. What is our answer? If the American
people fail to halt the use and stop further manufacture of
these monstrous instruments of wholesale death—the atomic
weapons—created, let us never forget, in our country, and
already wan-tonly used twice against civilian populations——we
will be branded with a far greater guilt than were the German
people. The American people can and must give an imperative
peace mandate to the Truman government——to save our chil-
dren and all children, our homes and all homes, our lives and
all lives, from mass extermination. One need not be a Com-
munist to ha-te war, to abhor the atom bomb, to work for
peace, to want children to live.

John Brown, Frederick Douglass, William L. Garrison were
the conscience of America in the ﬁght against human slavery in
the 186o’s. Eugene V. Debs, and brave men and women like
him, were the conscience of America against an imperialist
war in 1917. William Z. Foster, Eugene Dennis, Henry Win-
ston and their brave comrades are the conscience of America
today, calling upon our people to ﬁght against fascism at home
and war in the world. Their persecution is a frame-up for war.
The so-called moth-eaten Red-scares are to screen the war
plans from the American people. We -are very close to Hit1er’s
concentration camps—closer than you think. The Hobbs bill
will start them for the foreign-born. The ‘book burnings have
already begun. Act now before it is too late. It is already
very late. —

THE RULINC 0F LEARNED HAND

On August 1, the United States Court of Appeals upheld
the frame-up conviction of the eleven leaders at Foley Square.
With an unseemly, yes, indecent -haste, after one short month
they passed opinion on -this historic thought-control trial.

This court had insisted on hearing the case before the ink
was hardly dry on the records and one can infer now that all
they read carefully were the government’s briefs, which are
practically duplicated in the courts’ written opinion. The
reason for the mad rush appears throughout the record. It
bristles with evidence that the Wall St. imperialists are de-
termined to imprison the Communist leaders and outlaw the
Party immediately on account of the war in Korea. It argues
a “clear and present danger”-—in the Communist Party as a
party of peace, which spearheads the growing popular move
ment to prevent the Korean ﬁasco spreading into an atomic
global war, in which millions of the plain people of the world
will be slaughtered.

This opinion, written by the one-time “liberal” Judge
Learned Hand, goes far beyond the Foley Square. trial, bad
as that was. It denies even to the peoples of other lands the
inalienable right to revolution which gave birth to the United
States and which is set forth in the Declaration of Independ-
ence. What would Thomas‘ Jefferson and the other signers
of that immortal document think of the dictum of this
“liberal” judge, that “Revolutions are often ‘right’ but ‘right
of revolution’ is a contradiction in terms”?

The statement of the National Committee of the Commu-
nist Party on this Appeals Court ruling is in part as follows:

“This infamous negation of the principles on which this
nation was founded is an attempt to give legal sanction to the
American monopolists’ counter—conspiracies and efforts to
maintain by military force and violence the subjugation of
other nations and peoples.

“Yet it is not a Socialist revolution in the United States
which appears to Judge Hand as the ‘clear and present
danger’ presented by the Communist Party. He, and those

21

i
l
i
I
i

   

   

for whom he speaks, fear the Communist Party because of its
immediate program—and above all because millions of Ameri-
can workers will ‘not improbably’ act in accord with what the
Communists teach and advocate now, today.

“The Communist Party and its leaders advocate united
action to change the present war policy of the United States
government. We advocate that the United Nati-ons be rebuilt
in the image of its Charter and original purpose; that the
Nehru proposal to end the lockout of China and the Soviet
Union be adopted; that the U.N. ﬁnd a just and peaceful solu-
tion for the war in Korea. We advocate that our government
be obliged -by the united action of all peace-loving Americans
to abandon its opposition to the outlawing of atomic weapons
through international agreement. We advocate that the Amer-
ican people impose on the bipartisans their will to peace and
friendship between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.

“The ‘Communist Party and its leaders advocate that labor
defend itself against impending wage freezes and wage cuts,
and against the nulliﬁcation of its right to strike. We advocate
that the common people act unitedly in defense of their living
standards and democratic rights. We advocate that Negro and
white unite to save the Negro people from mounting lynch
terror and police brutality. We advocate a broad democratic
front of struggle to save the Bill o-f Rights and prevent fas-
cism from coming in these United States.

“That millions will heed our warnings, and act to defend
their living standards and democratic liberties—that is the
‘clear and present danger’ which the imprisonment of the
eleven Communist leaders and the outlawing of the Commu-
nist Party seeks to avert.

“By up-holding the vicious and unconstitutional Smith Act,
the court has opened the way for thousands of new frame~—up
prosecutions that will certainly not pick and choose between
Communist and non-Communist critics of the twin parties-
Moreover, the op-inion’s war hysteria lays the basis for a
wholesale nulliﬁcation of the right to bail—not only in the
case of the 11, -but in all other cases involving opposition to
“fall Street's war.”

In one of his speeches Eugene Dennis made this appeal:

“Stronger winds of democratic unity must sweep our coun-
try, gathering up all that is wholesome, progressive and anti-
fascist in American life. The advocates of government of the
people, by the people, and for the people must not yield
ground to the proponents of government of the trusts, by the
trusts, and for the trusts.

_“The blitz which pro-fascist reaction p-repares against the
American people and their democratic institutions can and
must be averted. It must be averted by united action now,
while there is still time to act. Those who hope to escape the
consequences of a blitz today dare not waste time debating
over where they want to go tomorrow.

“The good and tested American axiom that in union there

is strength has become the categorical imperative for labor

and all progressives today. A powerful labor and democratic
coalition is within our grasp. We have only to reach out our
hands, seize it and shape it, before the opportunity to do so
is snatched from us.

“The hour for common action—of, by, and for the common
man—is here for all progressives, non-Communists and Com-
munists alike.

“Let us meet its challenge boldly, and seize its opportunities
with determination.

“Let us act together——now——with all the strength of our unity,
to stem the rise of reaction and fascism, to protect our trade
unions, our democratic heritage, our common interests.

“Let us act together to ensure a progressive and peaceful
future for our people, for America, our own, our native land.”

(1)‘ Write to President Truman demanding a general
amnesty, the unconditional release of all American political
and labor prisoners.

(2) Urge the Supreme Court to review and reverse the
verdict of Foley Square and declare the Smith Act unconsti-
tutional.

(3) Stop World War III.

(4) Defend the Communist Party-—the party of peace.

UPHOLD THE BILL OF RIGHTS!

Since this pamphlet went to press, two important historical events have L‘

happened in our country — the first, the passage of the police-state
McCarran-Kilgore bill, over the veto of President Truman. However, in
Pontius Pilate fashion, he did nothing to mobilize his party forces to sus-
tain his veto; rather in the veto he actually endorsed the concept of
concentration camps in America and will now proceed to enforce the law.
The passage of this bill is a defeat for democracy. Millions of Americans
spoke out against these fascist bills—including the A. F. of L., the C.I.O.,
and representative organizations of the Negro and ]ewish people who
realize that it is not the rights of one political group, the Communists,
which are at stake alone, but the Bill of Rights for all.

It is now necessary to challenge the constitutionality of this shameful
legislation, to ﬁght against its enforcement against anyone in our country.
Meantime a tremendous mass movement for the repeal of this legislation
is imperative and in the coming elections the American people have an
opportunity to clearly indicate to this 81st Congress that they reject its
whole program of war and fascism.

The second event was the continuance of bail by Supreme Court Justice '

jackson to the Communist leaders, who are appealing the Foley Square
thought-control conviction to the United States Supreme Court. This is
a real victory for the democratic tradition and u holds the Bill of Rights.

In his opinion ]ustice jackson said: “I regard t e case as one in which ,

substantial questions are open to review by the Supreme Court,” and
further in rejecting the basis for the Government's motion to cancel bail,
he said, “If all that convicted these defendants was such utterances as
have followed their conviction, there would indeed be doubt about its
validity, for I am unable to  in them any word of advocacy of vio-
lence either to overthrow the Government or of forcible resistance to its
policy. If that inference can be drawn from these utterances it can equally
well be drawn from many other opposition speeches by non-Communists.”
And further, “The right of every American to equal treatment is wrapped
up in the same constitutional bundle with those of these Communists.”
The issue involved in this appeal is not only the unconstitutionality of the
Smith Act; but the conviction itself. Millions have spoken out in thepast
ten years against the Smith Act. It is now imperative to mobilize a mass
movement to insist and demand that the Supreme Court review this in-
famous thought-conurol frameup trial at Foley Square and reject it —
declaring the Smith Act unconstitutional and liberating the defendants.
Defeating the McCarran-Kilgore Act and the Smith Act is defending and
upholding the Bill of Rights.

EUGENE DENNIS sits today in a Federal prison
cell, for “contempt” of the Un-American Com-
mittee. But the real reason he is there is big-
ger than this disgraceful committee, whose
behavior President Roosevelt once described
as “sordid.” Like Eugene Debs, who sat in a
prison cell in Atlanta Penitentiary thirty years
ago, he is a labor prisoner and a war prisoner.
Eugene Dennis is the No. 1 American pris-
oner of the cold war, that has now become a
shooting war in Korea.

Debs was the outstanding leader of the Socialist Party. Den-
nis as General Secretary is the spokesman of the Communist
Party, the inheritor of the best militant traditions of Debs
and his generation. Both opposed aggressive wars for proﬁt
and power, for imperialist aggrandizement and the conquest
of other peoples as unjust. Dennis and his Party ﬁght against
an atomic war which would plunge the world into indescrib-
able horror and let loose wholesale death and destruction.
Fighting for peace in the world was the “crime” of Eugene
Debs in 1918. It is the “crime” of Eugene Dennis and his
comrades today.

When the heavy prison gates clanged behind Eugene Den-
nis, that ominous sound echoed in many far-off places, where
millions who have known the agony of war twice in a genera-
tion are determined it must never happen again. That sound
had a terrible meaning to those who remembered how the im-
prisonment of Ernest Thaelman, brave and outspoken Sec-
retary of the Communist Party of Germany, was a prelude
to fascism and war. That sound was a danger signal to all who
lived through a fascist conquest—which meant not only un-
told military casualties, but wholesale slaughter of the Jewish
people; smashing of trade unions, of political p-arties, of
organizations of women and youth; wanton destruction of

3

 

  

homes, cities and farms; concentration camps, and gas cham-
bers. To all people throughout the world, there is an even
greater menace in the threat of atomic warfare.

Ever growing numbers bless the name of Eugene Dennis,
as an American Communist leader who at the head of his
Party, ﬁghts for peace in the place where the danger of atomic
war has its origin; who ﬁghts the warmongers on their own
territory; who would make our country a stronghold of peace
in the world, to free humanity forever from the scourge of
war.

POLITICAL PRISONER _

    

Eugene Dennis is a political prisoner, a status long accepted
in Europe, even in old Czarist Russia, but not as yet in demo-
cratic America. He is the ﬁrst war prisoner, but he is not the
last. He is faced with three prison sentences, totalling six
years and six months. He is n-ow serving one year for contempt
of the infamous Rankin-Thomas Un-American Committee-
a contempt whole-heartedly shared by thousands of trade-
unionists, Negro people, and all democratic Americans who
resent their blacklisting, bulldozing, witch-hunting practices
of the past twelve years.

During the trial of the eleven Communists at Foley Square
Eugene Dennis acted as his own counsel, following a long-
standing American working-class tradition. Here he was sen-
tenced by the arrogant Judge Medina to six months for “con-
tempt,” along with ﬁve able defense attorneys, who struggled
heroically to defend their clients against judicial interference
and’ intimidation. He was also sentenced by judge Medina to
ﬁve years imprisonment, along with his ten comrades, after
the Foley Square conviction for “conspiracy” to violate the
Smith Act, by advocating Marxism-Leninism, or Socialism.
This catch-all, dragnet of “contempt” and “conspiracy” have
been used since 1806 against the labor movement, when newly
organized unions were ﬁrst branded conspiracies. During re-
cent coal strikes we saw the members of the United Mine

4

 

Workers and their president threatened with both these phony
charges.

Since Eugene Dennis entered prison, twenty-two other
victims of the Un-American Committee have been locked up.
They are George Marshall of the Civil Rights Congress; ten
world famous Hollywood writers and directors, including
Lawson, Trumbo, Maltz, Lardner, who refused to “confess”
their political views; and eleven board members of the Anti-
Fascist Refugee -Committee, including Drs. Barsky, Miller
and Auslander, whose patients ar.e being cared for by other
doctors. They include Howard Fast, universally known
novelist, three mothers, Mrs. Charlotte Stern, Mrs. Ruth
Leidler and Mrs. Marjorie Chodrov. Their “crime” was to
refuse to name contributors to relief funds for anti-fascists
in Franco"s prisons. Three more cases are ‘pending. Leon
Josephson, New York Communist attorney, has served one
year among narcotic addicts and peddlers at the Milan,
Michigan, Penitentiary. A

The total number of political prisoners of the Un-American
Committee is twenty-six to date. Fifty-seven more have been
cited recently, the majority trade unionists, by this committee.
Further emboldened by the green light given to it by the
U.S. Supreme Court, which evasively ducked passing judge-
ment upon it, or on the issue of its constitutionality, they are
searching their records from 1938 on for further charges.

The notorious witch hunt is on again in full force. No one
is safe from it. You may be next.

APPEAL FROM ILLEGAL COMMITTEE

In his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Eugene Dennis
presented a devastating indictment of the Un-American Com-
mittee, whose subpoena to appear before them he rejected in
1947. He challenged the constitutionality of this committee,
because it has taken over the powers of a grand jury, police,
prosecutor and judge, violating the Bill of Rights. He chal-
lenged the blatant Jim Crower, John Rankin, as not legally

  

   

entitled to sit in Congress and therefore illegally a member
of this committee. Mississippi, under. the 14nd Amendment
is not entitled to seven Congressmen, be-cause 47 per cent of
the voters, or over half a million Negro Americans, are pre-
vented from_ voting there by force and violence. The Supreme
Court refused to pass on any of these important issues. They
upheld the trial procedure in all these cases, which took place

in Washington, D.C., where the majority of the jury were

government employees, fearful of disloyalty charges, if they
dared to acquit. ’

 Parnell Thomas, ex-chairman of this infamous commit-
tee and one of its members since 1938, received a jail sentence
of six to eighteen months, as a convicted thief, who padded
government payrolls of the committee and of his Congres-
sional oflice, stealing thousands of dollars from the govern-
ment. He has just been released after serving only nine months,
and his $10,000 ﬁne was paid by wealthy friends. A

Representative John Wood, who succeeded Thomas as
Chairman, is publicly accused of demanding and receiving
$1,000 from a crippled constituent after aiding the man re-
cover $10,000 damages, from the government. Such are the
jailers of Dennis and the others. 9

Immediate amnesty, or general release by Presidential de-
cree, should be demanded of President Truman for all those
outstanding Amricans who refused to knuckle down to this
un-American Committee. The abolition of this witch-hunting
outﬁt should be an issue in the 1950 elections, to guarantee
its abolition by the next Congress. It is a disgrace to America.

The Foley Square trial was a campaign issue to help elect
Truman. The Communist Party has existed in the U.S.A.
since 1919. The Smith Act was passed in 1940. After 29 years
of the Party’s legal existence and eight years after the Smith
Act was passed, why did the government ﬁnally resort to this
legal frame-up—that to advocate Marxism-Leninism consti-
tutes a conspiracy? It was because the cold war was fully
launched by 1948 and the American Communists were in the
vanguard against it.

They exposed the Marshall Plan, which interferes in the
political affairs and economic development of all those coun-
tries it pretends to aid, limiting their production and dictat-
ing their exports and imports; causing unemployment, high

prices and deﬂation of their currencies, as in France. Muni- A

tions and war supplies are shipped out of this country to arm

reactionary governments abroad against their own people, as

in Greece, and to carry out wars of aggression against colonial
peoples in Asia and Africa, as in Malaya, Viet-Nam and
now Korea, where the U.S.A. is involved directly.

A fascist-like invasion of the national independence of
European countries is deeply resented there. Recently at a
Youth Congress in England a speaker asked: “Are the Amer-
ican imperialists defending Britain or attacking ‘us? We are
an occupied country with 10,000 foreign troops on our soil.
They are Americans, not Russians. War materials from across

. the Atlantic arrive at our ports. We are bound» hand and

foot to the Atlantic War Pact, with American advisers, Amer-
ican generals and American controllers in-festing the country
in. which we live.’’

This foreign policy is accompanied by attempts to destroy ‘

the democratic rights of the American people at home. Civil
liberties are ﬂouted while all politicians give fulsome lip-
service to them. Mob violence and legal frame-ups multiply
against the Negro people. There are a dozen Scottsboro cases
today. The rights of labor are dangerously curtailed by the
Taft-Hartley slave law and the drive to outlaw a minority
political party—the Communist Party——makes a mockery of the
Bill of Rights and free elections. A

Nor is Foley Square the end. It is only the beginning of
wholesale political persecutions, according to Acting Assistant
Attorney General Whearty. In a demand on Congress for more
appropriations for the Dept. of Justice, he recently declared
that 21,000 persons are under investigation and plans are
already made to prosecute 12,000 who could beshown “to be
sympathetic orappreciative of the Communist Party,” when
the Supreme Court ‘upholds the Smith Act. So conﬁdent are

they of a favorable decision that months in advance he an-
nounces they “are preparing that program for 1951.” Thought
control is not enough for the warmakers. Now, according to
Whearty, they will attempt to outlaw feelings and emotions.
But can they outlaw the growing peace sentiment in the
U.S.A.P Can they outlaw the just wrath of the American
people which is slowly gathering against all such steps toward
mass concentration camps as now threaten those who oppose
war?

DEBS AND DENNIS

There is more than a similarity of names between those
two famous working-class political prisoners--Eugene Debs
and Eugene Dennis. There is an inspiring likeness in their
class-conscious declarations against war, dictated by the best
interests of the American workers and of the plain people
everywhere. Ruling class justice sent both Debs and Dennis
to prison to silence their eloquent voices, stop their pens and
separate them from the people in the struggles for peace.
Strangely enough both went to prison in peacetime for oppos-
ing war, Debs on April 12, 1919, ﬁve months after the Armis-
tice and Dennis on May 12, 1950, ﬁve years after V—Day.
Neither Debs nor Dennis spoke as paciﬁsts opposed to all
war. Rather they both spoke against capitalist wars, Debs as a
Socialist, Dennis as a Communist.

In the period between 1918, when Debs fought against im-
perialist World War I, and the rising threat of another im-
perialist war in 1950, there has been another war, a war
against fascism, a war for the national liberation of millions
of cruelly oppressed people. While known as World War II,
it was not comparable politically to the ﬁrst world war nor
to the threatened world war in the making today, because
it was a just war, accepted as such by the people of the United
States, the U.S.S.R., Great Britain, France, China and all the
other allied peoples and by the peoples of Nazi-occupied lands.
This just war was whole-heartedly supported by Eugene

8 _

 

 

Dennis and his Party, as demonstrated by the honorable and
heroic war records of 15,000 members of the Communist
Party, including Winston, Gates, Hall, and Thompson, four
of the Foley Square defendants. I am conﬁdent that Eugene
Debs, if he were alive, would have supported such an anti-
fascist war, judging by his utterances, which were directed
against wars for conquest and proﬁts.

In the Appeal -to Reason of September 11, 1915, Debs
wrote under the title “In Whose War I Will Fight,” as
follows:—“I am not opposed to all war nor am I opposed to
all ﬁghting under all circumstances. I have not a drop of
blood to shed for the oppressors of the working class and
the robbers of the poor, the thieves and looters, the brigands
and murderers, whose debauched misrule is a crime of the
ages. I have a heart full to sized for their victims when it shall
be needed in the war for their liberation.” _

Eugene Dennis in his eloquent summation in the trial of
the eleven Communist leaders, in 1949, stated the same Social-
ist principle: “There is a fundamental diﬁerence between wars
of national defense and national conquest, wars of national
liberation and national oppression—b-etween just and un-
just wars. According to this working class principle, we
Marxists hold that it is a duty to oppose all unjust wars, to
struggle to prevent their outbreak, and if that struggle is
defeated—t9o work for the establishment of a democratic
and just peace. We Communists speak the blunt language
of working people. We say plainly that the ﬁrst and high-
est duty of the patriot in all countries is to judge
if the cause in which his own government resorts to arms
be just or unjust. We say that if guilt attaches to those
Germans who did not oppose Hitler’s wars of aggression
—then Americans would be equally guilty if they support an
unjust war waged by any government of the United States.”

These wise words are of tremendous signiﬁcance now when
threats of all-out war are upon .us.. They are hated by the
warmakers, who fear the power of the people to stop war.
