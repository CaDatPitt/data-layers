  ational Wage Policy Conference
ets Bargaining Demands for   l  64

TUCSON, Ariz.—A substantial general wage increase, extended r -

paid vacations for all employees every five years, double time
pay for all overtime work, supplemental unemployment compen-
sation, and severance pay. in case of separation are some of the

major bargaining demands that Mine-Mill will lay on the table ’

this year when .contract talks with the companies open about th
beginningof May. ‘ ' j _ A
. . Final formulation of the union’s bargaining program for'1964
took placcoat the three-day National Wage Policy Conference here
late last month, attended by some 120,delegates from around the
country. ‘

International President A. 'C.- Skinner, in wrapping. up the
conference on Jan. 25, said that the total package amounts to “but
a fraction of the _enormous increase in, profits that non-ferrous
metals producers in thiscountry are ‘going to rake in this year:
net profits after taxes that will be up 10 percent over the banner
year of 1963 and that will top $200 million in copper mining alone.”

The major work of the meeting was done in five committees-
wages, job security, health and welfare, contract improvements,
and education and mobilization——combining the talents of rank and
filers, local union. leaders, and international executive -board
members. Although some sections of the committee reports caused

After Two-Week Strike    

I  _ GREAT FALIS, Mont.—-A two-week strike which shut down the entire Reduction Works of the
  Anaconda Company here ended Jan. 29 when the company agreed to rehire 15 Mine-Mill workers
who had been discharged and to renew negotiations with the union over the new shaft furnace in
‘the Furnace Refinery Department. . ’ —

.~ . - .1 The settlement also included a company promise that there would be no discrimination against
0, any .employee because of his participation in the work stoppage or respect for the picket line. The
, terms‘ were approved by all but eight to 10 of the some 400 members of Mine-Mill Local 16 who voted

' -onthe settlement, which was recommended by the negotiating committee.

-‘ ~ Despite the extreme arrogance
"_ of the Anaconda Company in
;_ ,--;-Montana, they say, it was forced
’ to reverse its position on the
firing of 15 workers.

_ More than 1300 workers re-
spected the picket lines, includ-
' '. ing the members of various
craft unions at the Plant. Mine-
Mill officials expressed ap-

»’crew.‘of 22 and to get some of

lively discussions on the floor
of the whole conference, they
were, by and large, accepted
without other than minor
changes.
Sound Base for
Bargaining Stressed

The solid case for major bar-
gaining gains in 1964, stressed
time after time at the meeting,
provided an overall
theme. The fact is that prices,
profits, production, and produc-
tivity per man-hour of labor
have all been going up in the
non-ferrous metalsindustry in
recent years.

Althoughno figure was placed
on the call» for": a “substantial
general wage‘ increase,” both
Skinner and ‘Secretary-Treasun
er Irving Dichter pointed to the
trend of the Teamsters’ recent
settlement, in emphasizing “the
need of the-labor movement to
get away from the ‘no increase’
pattern the Steelworkers have
set for the past few years.” The

Teamsters’ pact, an o v e r all

package of 45 cents, provides
wage hikes of 28 cents an hour
over the next three years.
Again looking to the Team-
sters’ nationwide agreement as
an example, Mine-Mill officials

DICHTER AND SKINNER AS TUCSON CONFERENCE

OPENS. (3029-15). -

Lastweek, Feb. 9 to 15, was Negro History Week,
in the middle of which we observed Lincoln’s birthday.
Feb. 16 to 23 will mark the 31st observance of Brother-
hood Week, sponsored by the National Conference of
Christians and Jews. '

Last week, on Monday, Feb. 10, the U. S. House
of Representatives passed, by a 290 to 130 roll-call
vote, the strongest federal civil rights bill in a century
—a bill far stronger than the one originally requested
by the late President Kennedy. The 10-point measure
would make it. unlawful for employers or labor unions
to discriminate, would protect voting rights, would
compel desegregation of public schools and parks,
would outlaw discrimination in places of public ac-
commodation, and would permit the withholding of
federal funds from programs in which there is shown
to be discrimination. - . 1

Voting for the bill were 152 Democrats and 138
Republicans. There can be little. doubt but that the
demonstrations, the public sacrifices and tragedies of
1963 played a big part in touching the consciences of
U. S. Congressmen 100 years after emancipation.

Four little girls dead from a bomb blast in Bir-
mingham, Medgar Evers dead of a bullet in the back,

This Brotherhood Week let each of us write two
letters, one to each of our Senators, calling for their

importantly, they must be told, in no uncertain terms,
that a. vote for civil rights has to include a vote against

Duarte, Whifeaker
Enter Dem Primary

BISBEE, Ariz.—‘—Two members of the Copper Queen
Miners Union will run in the Democratic primary on
April '20, seeking party nomination for two of the six
aldermanic seats in the town. —

David G. Duarte, business agent of Local 551, will
run in Ward 2 where a Vacancy exists, while A. C.
Whiteaker will attempt to unseat Bill Marshal in Bisbee’s
first Ward. , —

In announcing his candidacy, Duarte maintained that

 

men are heavily influenced by
the Phelps Dodge Corp.‘ here.

An unsuccessful candidate for
the state legislature two years
ago, Duarte was elected secre-
tary of the Arizona chapter of
the Am e r i c a n Coordinating
Council on Political Education
on Feb. 9. This is a non-parti-
san organization originally
formed to get Mexican-Ameri-
cans active in politics.

The Ward 2 seat has been va-
cated by Ralph Ruiz, who
moved to a different section of
the town. Also seeking the
Democratic nomination, how-
ever, is Manuel Lugo, a grocery
store owner in Bisbee. Approxi-
mately 800 voters are eligible
to take part in the election.

Whiteaker, a member of the
union’s grievance committee,
ran two years ago, losing by
about 50 votes in a turnout of
1,000. Marshal, the incumbent,
is also a Democrat.

Duarte, who_is a service of-
ficer for the VFW here, is also
the chairman of the Arizona
Mine-Mill Council, which repre-
sents some 15 Arizona locals
and ladies auxiliaries in pro-
posing and lobbying for or
against certain bills during leg-
islative sessions... . ' '

BUFFALO, N.Y.——What’s not

good for General Motors.

This, in essence, was the mes-
sage of a mass demonstration

ing on Jan. 8. Sponsored by the‘
Buffalo branch of the National
Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People, the
demonstration c h a r g e d G.M.
with “restricting Negroes to hot,
hard, heavy, and low-paying
jobs.”

Leaﬂets handed out by the
picketers said that the Chevro-

Whites, that 400 of the Whites
work at skilled trades as com-
pared to six of the Negroes, and
that the 45 foremen in the plant

Arbitration Results

6 Hearings Awaited

CLIFTON, Ariz.—Officials of
Mine-Mill Local 616 have hopes
that Phelps Dodge here may in-
itiate a system for fairly assess-
ing employee disability, as a re-
sult of a case now being arbi-
trated.

The union is asking for full
back pay for Mariano C. Pena,
who was_ removed from the

company payroll some time ago "

because of alleged disability
from arthritis. Dr. Carl Gans,
the company doctor, had de-

cided Pena was unable to work
at his regular job or any of the
others that opened up while he
was not working.

At a hearing before George
H. Hildebrand of Cornell Uni-
versity, the union presented evi-
dence that Pena could work at
several jobs satisfactorily, such
as janitoror cleanup laborerin
the smelter, the job from which
he had been laid off. The doc-
tor, the hearing showed, had. be-
lieved that Pena was a conver-
tor‘ puncher—-a much more de-
manding job physically.

No- decision has yet _ been
made on the pay back issue in
the case. Two other cases have
been re-scheduled for February
hearings.

The Mail Bag
Fellow workers and friends; _

I read the monthly newspaper 1
of your union which is given to — V
me by a friend. I am 83 years
old, a retired tailor and furrier,
and am always interested in and
on the side of unions and the
organized workers. -  o

On January '22, I heard a’ "
speech by Senator Goldwater
who said he is opposed to social
security and to organized labor. _
According to what he says, hey: 
is a very dangerous man. If he  l
were to be elected president of
the United States, he might de-
stroy everything that organized
workers have today and have
fought for for many years. ~ ..

One other thing. Senator Gold-
water says that, if he is elected,
he will make an invasion’-of ‘
Cuba, which would mean‘ an- 0
other war. In my opinion, Cuba ‘
is an independent state, and he 
should leave the Cuban people
just as they are. _ 

My appeal to you and to all
union members is not to vote
for Senator Goldwater or forthe .
Republican ticket. Union mem-I _
bers should know what to do for V '
their own safety. ' .

Although faced by provocative

actions on the part of the com-
pany, the local union leadership
and membership have avoided
striking, feeling that such an
action would be premature. One
of the union demands in the ne-
gotiations, now at a standstill,
is a contract expiration date of
June 30, a date common with
the other AS&R locals.
Meeting in Tucson, Ariz. on

In an unusual letter W to the

questioned the union’s not hav-

in maintaining the union’s his- -

Court Date Set
For Lawrence,
Pezzati, Dolan

U. S. District Court Judge
Alfred A. Arraj will hold a hear-
ing on Mon., Feb. 24 on Alton
Lawrence’s motion for permis-
sion to change his original plea
of “no contest” in the Mine-Mill
“conspiracy” case to one of
“not guilty.” .

Judge Arraj has indicated tha
he may at the same time sen-
tence the two other defendents
who, pleaded “nolo contendere”
—-former secretary-treasurer Al-
bert Pezzati and former Mine-
Mill Union editor Graham Do-
lan.

Lawrence, who ‘testified for
the government at the retrial
of the “conspiracy” case last
fall, bases his motion for change
of plea on his “cooperation”
with the government and on the
fact that five of the original 14
defendents have been dismissed.
There was no more evidence
against him than against the

I defendents who have been dis-

missed, he said.

Union leaders maintain that
no substantive evidence exists

V against any of the defendents

and that all are innocent of the
“conspiracy” charge.

Mine-Mill emands Explained
To Membership, Gommunity

_ CLIFTON, Ariz.—The delegation from the Morenci Miners’
Umon to the Mine-Mill National Wage Policy Conference in Tucson
acted quickly to inform both union members and the community
in general of the program drafted there late last month. The im-
portance of securing the broadest possible support and sympathy
for union demands in 1964 had been stressed over and over at the

Tucson meetings.

Carl  Kr_ass, president of Local 616, said, in a lengthy article
on the Mine-Mill demands appearing in The Copper Era, the weekly
Greenlee County newspaper, on Jan. 31, that “these demands will

. be given stiff opposition which

can only be overcome by an in-
formed and willing group of

workers who will insist that their-

future, and that of their fam-
ilies, be made more secure.”

A union ‘leadership meeting

» was held on Jan. 29 and a regu-

lar membership meeting on Feb.

3, at both. of which the local’s;

negotiating committee presented
the bargaining proposals for
1964 which came out of the Tuc-

1 son conference.

‘_Kr.ass called the program of
the international union “realistic
and,attain_able,.” and said that
_ V the demands ‘ were
s‘.‘.frivolous or unreasonable.’-’
Executive Secretary Frank Z.
Morales agreed, saying, “Our
most important job is that of ac-
quainting the workers of the real

import of these proposals so that
, 1 their support will be sincere and

unbending. We. recognize that
our strength lies in the ranks of
a determined membership and

V in a fully informed group of

workers willing to do whatever
must be done to attain that

“ which is their righ .”

David Velasquez, a member of
the local’s negotiating commit-

"tee, who also serves as chair-

’ gaining council of the interna-
x " tional union, called for coopera-
» tion between Mine-Mill and oth-

, :.  er unions at PD in -pursuing the
 bargaining demands. “We feel,”
 the said, “itliat ‘this program is .

  

equally important to workers
represented by other unions, and
that all will join together to
achieve the utmost in benefits
and job protection during 1964
negotiations.”

Edward G. Marquez, chair-
man of the local’s political ac-
tion committee, pointed out that
many of the bargaining de-
mands for this year are related
to the political goals of the un-

ion, both in Congress and the

state legislature.

 

"two towns.

by such local unions may con-
fer on matters of mutual con-
cern regarding wages and condi-
tions of work, health and wel-
fare, pensions, and insurance——
all in accordance with the law
and the policies of their respec-
tive organizations.”

Union Opens Drive.
For Safety Law  

Mine-Mill has launched its campaign to get early
hearings on the Metcalf-Montoya bill, introduced in Con-

gress last July, with publication of an eight-page pam- _. ‘

phlet “A Federal Mine Safety Law Now!”

8,000 -of the 20,000 printed have already been dis-
tributed—to Mine-Mill locals, ‘to other national and inter-
national labor organizations, to every Congressman and

Senator.

The pamphlet summarizes the major findings’ and
recommendations of Interior Secretary Stewart Udal1’s
report to Congress on health and safety conditions in

metal and nonmetal mines. The
report, submitted in November
after two years of study, urged
establishment of a federal safety
program for such mines. _

The Metcalf-Montoya bill (S
1949, HR 7812) calls for such a
program, implemented with real
inspection and enforcement
powers. It would cover mines,
quarries, sand and gravel
plants, and associated smelters,
refineries, and other processing
plants.

All Mine-Mill members are
asked to write their Congressman
and Senators, urging prompt
scheduling of hearings‘ on the
bill by the Senate Interior Com-
mittee and the House Education
and Labor Committee.

Congress, with a huge back-
log of bills to be considered,
probably will adjourn about July
in this election year.

with approval or suggested
changes. _

could be delayed for several

Staff Discusses ’
Implementation

TUCSON, Ariz. —- During a,

four-day meeting from Jan. 28
to 31, the staff of the interna-
tional union thrashed out a
variety of problems, including
how best to implement the new-
ly-formulated bargaining pro-
gram for 1964. ’

The raiding situation was dis-
cussed at length, with President
A.‘ C. Skinner vowing that Mine-
Mill was going to take back
some of the properties lost in
raids over the past several
years. Possibilities of new or-

ganization were examined in_

detail.

Other important projects com-
ing up are the campaign for a
federal mine safety bill, fund-
raising for the defense of the
“conspiracy” ‘case, and action
in the political field.

Staff members presented
some of their “grievances” to
the executive board, winning a
promise that many of the prob-
lems would be solved at the
next-board meeting, set for late
:’March~or early April.

A‘ basic proposals

 

 

THE MINE-MILL, UNION

February. 'l96lili’__"~

.2 (Continued from Page 1) '

 spoke of the importance of pro-

‘ jecting demandsfor the entire

"’industry, of having the Kenne-
. cott, Anaconda, AS&R, Phelps

Dodge, and Magma bargaining
councils all fight for the same
in 1964. The
‘ working committees at the meet-
ing considered proposals of the
various councils and local un-
ions, in addition to studying the
recommendations of the interna-

 l’  tional‘ executive board.

Premium "Weekend Pay

Other wage demands coming
out of the National Wage Policy
Conference are increased shift

differentials of 10, 15, and 20
cents an hour; premium pay for
all weekend work; and double
time pay for all work in excess

-of eight hours a day or 40 hours
a week.

Many conference demands are
aimed at alleviating the effects
of automation, which has~elimi-
nated '20 percent of the jobs in
copper mining since 1956 and
close to half of the jobs in the

 lead-zinc industry during that

period, with similar job shrink-
age taking place in "smelting,
refining, and fabricating of non-
ferrous metals.

- The conference, for example,
asked that union agreement be
required for any further reduc-
tion in size of crews or doubling

up of jobs, with establishment —

of the principle of higher Wage
rates in the event of changes in
job content. Delegates voted to
demand the right to arbitrate or
to strike should labor and man-
agement fail to agree in this
area. ’

Two demands which were not
part of the committee reports,
but which were brought up and
passed on the ﬂoor of the con-
ference, are for the elimination

of the no-strike clause from the
contract and the inclusion.of a
clause stating that there will be
no layoffs during its duration.

Other job security measures
are the calls for extended vaca-
tions of b an additional eight
weeks every five years for all
employees with five or more
years of seniority, supplemental
unemployment compensation to
maintain income at 80 percent
of take-home pay for up to a
year after time of layoff, sev-
erance pay at a rate of $100 a
year for all past years of ser-
vice on retirement or separa-
tion for any other reason.

Health nd Welfare

In the area of health and wel-
fare, the conference asked that
employee contributions to the
various insurance and medical
plans be eliminated, that hos-
pital and medical coverage be
extended to dependents and to
employees retired under com-
pany pension plans, and that
provision be made for joint un-
ion-company administration of

the entire health and welfare

program.

Delegates approved a lengthy
section on safety which demands
that all contracts ‘provide for

.union safety committees which

would‘ meet regularly with man-
agement,-that union safety ex-
perts and state and federal in-
spection agencies be free to
check all operations, that union
and management agree to im-
plement the recommendations of
the safety committees and the
government agencies. There was
some heated floor discussion on
what contract provision should
be made to cover, a failure of
company and union to agree on
safety recommendations. Two
alternatives were proposed—a
clause affirming the right of

Skinner told the press prior to the kickoit of the National
Wage Policy Conference. Garry‘ Greenberg, news director

takes notes on Skinner's re-

    

Relief Requested From Automation

workers to refuse to work in an
unsafe place "without discipline,

, or a clause stating that dis-

agreement in this area would be
subject to the grievance proce-
dure and arbitration. It was fi-
nally agreed to leave" the deci-
sion on this up to each bargain-
ing council.

Company Responsibility

A further demand asked that

companies be responsible to
provide first aid and medical
attention, ambulance. service,
and protective clothing "where
needed. ' V

The conference passed resolu-
tions calling on all locals to fa-
miliarize themselves with this
year’s bargaining program and
to undertake‘ educational cam-
paigns aimed at gaining the
support of leaders, other labor
groups, and various organiza-
tions within their local commu-
nities.

Skinner, in summarizing the
conclusions of the conference,
noted, “A steady stream of com-
pany propaganda, can -be ex-
pected designed to discredit our
demands this year.” “Already,”
he said, “the Nevada Mines Di-
vision of_the Kennecott Copper
Company has put out a state-

ment saying that it can’t afford.

what Mine-Mill is asking-—and
that was a couple of weeks ago,
before our -program -was even
formulated.”

only Asking Fair ‘Share
“But in this program we’ve
just adopted,’-’ he ‘stated, . “we’re
only askingour fair share, and
the companies _can well afford

to meet our demands out of the.

tremendous profits they stand to
make in 1964.”

The following profits were
predicted for 1964 in copper pro-
duction by Skinner: Anaconda,
$53 million; Kennecott, $66 mil-
lion; American, Smelting and
Refining Co., $35 million; Phelps
Dodge, $411/2 million; American

“Metal Climax, $36 million; and

Magma Copper, $11 million. His

-figures are based on the current

price of copper, and a‘ price
hike, which is likely, will boost
profits still millions of dollars
higher. ,  . -

“Both union leaders and rank
and filers,” said Dichter, “are
looking to this _ year’s negotia-
tions with a ‘great deal of confi-
dence.” Major contracts with
all of the big companies are due
to expire on June 30.

The only outside speaker at
the conference was Father Rich-
ard O’Keeffe of .San.Manue-l,
whose address was commemo-
rated to the more than 500 met-
al, mineral, and coal miners
killed in U. S. mine accidents
in 1963. ~ .

Past Mine-Mill President John
Clark, now living in ‘Tucson,
alsg, spoke brieﬂy. Both he and
Skinner. condemned "the raids
against the union by the United
Steelworkers of America in the
past years, and predicted their
failure in the face of the soli-
darity of Mine-Mill.

frank Memmott
Now Beauty at
Bureau of Mates

Frank S. Memmott, a state
senator from Carbon County in
Utah, was sworn in as deputy
director of the U. S. Bureau of
Mines in Washington, D.C. early
this month. He was formerly a
member of United Mine Work-
ers of America Local 5916,
Castle Gate, Utah, as were his
father and grandfather before
him.

His appointment was hailed by
the United Mine Workers

. Journal, which called Memmott

“eminently qualified for his new
position.” F r a n k Stevenson,
president of District 22 of the
UMWA, said, “Senator Mem-
mott has been reared in coal
mining communities and knows
the conditions under which a
coal miner works.”

Secretary-Treasurer I r v i n g
Dichter extended the congratu-
lations of Mine-Mill’s executive
board to Memmott on his ap-
pointment. Dichter wrote Mem-
mott, “Your appointment comes
at a time when the Bureau will
be playing’ a vital role in the
consideration soon to be given
by Congress to "the subject of
safety in metal and non-metallic
mines. _

“We know of your expert
knowledge of this field because
of your background as a mining
engineer and as a former mem-
ber of the Utah Senate Commit-
tee on Safety in Mining. We are
delighted that a man of your
qualifications, with close knowl-
edge of the factors involved in
the two major and tragic min-
ing disasters in Utah last year
comes to the Bureau at this
time.”

Memmott, 37, has served as
a Democratic precinct chair-
man and has been a delegate to
state Democratic conventions. A
graduate of Brigham Young Uni-
versity, he also holds a master’s
degree in mathematics and
physics.

   

IOHN CLARK. Mine-Mill hon-
orary president, addressed
the conference on Thursday,
telling delegates that “this
union has enough courage,
enough support, and, yes,
enough light toquash any
and all -attacks." Clark and
his wife, Malvina, now living
in Tucson, are the heaviest
contributors to the union's

V defense fund.

,Arizona M-M Political Group

Active in Legslative Session

’ The Arizona Mine-Mill Council, meeting in January in Hayden, mapped out a com-

prehensive program of political action for the current legislative session—~a program‘

for drafting legislation and having it introduced, as well as lobbying for or against
other measures that come up for debate. Representatives from 15 locals and ladies
auxiliaries around the state attended.

Chaired by David Duarte of “Local 551 in Bisbee", the council is particularly inter-‘
 ested this year in minimum Wage, unemployment compensation, and occupational dis-
1 ease bills which have been put in the hopper. It will also support a bill to be intro-

duced’ by Rep. Fred Smith of Pinal County which will ask for the establishment of a

Bargaining. Mine Safety. Politics-

Gur Major Campaigns in 1964

by .lrving Dichi-er
International Secretary-Treasurer

Our union is moving into a series of important campaigns.
which in large measure will decide the future well-being of every.
worker in the industry. First and foremost is 1964 bargaining.‘

Our Tucson National Wage Policy Conference developed a well-
rounded bargaining program divided into four main categories-
wages, job and income security, contract improvements, and
health and welfare. Job security is perhaps the issue uppermost in

   

 

the minds of our membership, and naturally so. _A man’s first ’  ‘

concern is his job. _

But anyone examining the course of our economy in the past few
years must come to the conclusion that wages and job security are
Siamese twins. Unless wages keep pace with rising productivity, a '
gap develops between what we -produce and our ability to buy it
back. The result—-rising unemployment.

In the past few years many trade union leaders have falle

- for the hokum that substantial wage increases '-

are either inflationary or somehow contribute
to the unsettling of the economy. As a result,

bargaining. table‘ while the employers have
moved to lusher profits.
Let’s examine what has happened in the

last few years. The U. S. Department of Labor,
in a news release‘ last October, announced ‘

 

smaller in recent years.” While wage increases
have become smaller, prices, productivity, and
profits are all up. Using 1957-1959 as a base,
labor costs per unit of production have dropped eight percent, the
consumer price index has gone up six percent, and profits have
climbed 306 percent. « —

Wages Deserve Major Emphasis A
This combination has had two important effects. One, it has
kept real wages—what the pay check can buy——either stagnant or, -
in some cases, has lowered them. This, in turn, has contributed to ~
increasing unemployment. The N. Y. Times, in an article about
the same time, said, “Union officials are worried . . . they are
convinced their; failureto negotiate moreimoney for their ‘mem-
bers is contributing to the nation’s relatively high unemploymen .”-
It is no accident, therefore, that many unions, like Mine-Mill, .
are placing major emphasis on wages in ’64 bargaining. The
Teamsters set the pace in their newly~negotiated trucking agree’-
ment by winning a three-year 45-cent package, with 28 cents of it
in cash. The companies in our industry can well afford to bargain ‘
within this kind of pattern. ' 5

Our campaign for a federal mine safety bill in 1964 is moving .
intophigh gear. ,Within. weeks, 20,000 copies of our booklet.“A Fed-..

eral Mine Safety Law Now’? will be distributed to every‘ Mine-Mill

community in the vcountrfy. We-have sent copiestoevery ’Congress- .
man and Senator.’ Copies will go to every union _.in the United _

States. . ..
We have received word that the administration’s mine safety
bill, written by the Departmen of the Interior, is now going through
the pre-legislative routine in Washington. It is being submitted

. for a check to the various departments which could be effected

by its contents. - M _ . .
Mefcalf-Montoya Fills‘-the ‘Bill I '

The Department of the Interior could save a lot of time by _

supporting the Metcalf-Montoya bill. It meets the needs that have
been outlined so well in the Department’s own study on mine
safety. Furthermore, it has been checked out by the miners,
smeltermen, and refinery workers——the people whose. very lives are
at ‘stake in the passage or failure to pass this legislation.

‘k ‘k * . . .
The February issue of ADVANCE, the official publication of .
the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, has a catchy front-page head- ‘

line—“Political Action Spells Progress.” This spirit is pervading
our membership. Unlike previous years, many of our local unions
are already deeply involved in political action work,

Aside from the fact that this is a presidential year, they.some-
how feel that there is more at stake in ’64. President Johnson’s
State of the Union message fired the imagination of our people. The
general easing of world tensions has given them hope that we can

1 devote our energies to betteringlife at home. . . _ . .
The international union is developing a program to assist our__

locals in their political action activities. The program will range
from providing voting records of the candidates to practical as-
sistance on an organizational level. I ’

The Mine-Mill drive to kill a
sales tax increase, which started
in December, gained support
last week when the Western
New York Citizenship Council,
political arm of the area United
Auto Workers, condemned the
proposal. The UAW group rep-
resents -16 local tmions with ‘a-
total wmembership of close to
30,000. _ .1 -

The Board. of Supervisors‘,

fhowe’ver,. is ‘empowered to raise
the sales tax by one percent “

Without calling a referendum.
There has also been the sug-
gestion to raise the tax to three
percent,‘ but ‘this action would‘

require approval by the state‘

legislature.

The Mine-Mill locals admit the '

need for additional tax revenue,
particularly so that city em-
ployees can be given payboosts.
They maintain, however, that
sales taxes discriminate against
working people, the unemployed,
pensioners, farmers, and even
school children.

On the other side of the fence
on this issue is Joseph P. Ma-

pired on Jan. 31.

The Chilean Copper Workers‘,
Confederation announced its de-_
mands in November —— oneof
them a 100 percent increase in‘
pay, calculated to offset anti-
cipated. cost of living increases
over the 15-month term of a new

. contract. 1

Chile is in the grip of a gallop-.
ing inﬂation which sent the cost
of living up by 41 percent in

1963, according to government 

figures.
The union is also asking for
liberalized fringe beneﬁts. One

such demand is for the company V

to provide each retiring em-
ployee, after 25 years of service,
with a free house _in any section-
of the country he chooses.
Anaconda rejected the housing
demand and countered with an‘
offer of a 30 percent increasein
wages, not meeting the other
‘fringe benefits demands of the
union. Just before the strike
deadline, the company upped its,
offer on wages, offering a cost:
of-living escalator to match the
rise in the Chilean government’s
cost of living index. This offer
was rejected by the union.
Contrgcts expire at two other
‘big~U.S.-owned copper mines in
Chile this year. June 30iis the
deadline at Anaconda’s Chuqui-
camata mine, while the contract

  National Jewish Hospital
A Symbol of Hope

y Leo A. Terrill
Mine-Mill International Representative

DENVER, Colo.—National Jewish Hospital is a non-sectarian
institution for the treatment of tuberculosis and other diseases of
the lungs and chest. Patients of every race, religion, and nationality
come here from all over the world for treatment. Some of the
best chest doctors in the country are on the hospital staff, which
also includes nurses, social workers, and other kinds of specialized
personnel. A patient’s chances of regaining good health are often
excellent. The recovery rate of those entering with resistant

"bacilli has risen over the years from 30 percent to over 70 percent.

Take my case as a example. I have been fighting tuberculosis
since 1952. Since that time, I have had lung surgery, taken many
varieties of anti-tubercular drugs, yet was never able to stay
negative for a substantial period of time.
My doctor advised me to come to National
Jewish Hospital, saying that my chances
would be improved because of better fa-
cilities and other drugs which are avail-
able here.

I made application and was admitted
to the hospital on July 15. A battery of
tests were run——X-rays, blood studies, eye
and ear examinations, etc. I then began to
take a combination of four drugs which
were prescribed for my treatment--with
amazing results. After only two months of
the drugs, my sputum culture was negative.
And I had checked into the hospital as a _ _
re-treatment case, drug resistant and complicated with Sll1COSlS.

My health continues to improve and my cultures continue to
be negative. I am absolutely convinced that I came to the r1gl1t
place _for treatment.

Realizing that I shall still have to take some kind of drugs
for some time to“ come after leaving NJH, I feel that I am on
the road to good health, home, friends in Arizona, and work

again for my union.
Patient Morale High

Picture shows, parties, dances, and cook-outs are some of the
activities that the patients can enjoy at the hospital. After be-
coming negative, patients can get passes to attend special events
in Denver and are allowed a few hours each evening away from
the hospital grounds for shopping, visiting, etc. My wife has taken
an apartment only a block from the hospital, so that I am fortunate
enough to be able to visit and have a home-cooked meal with
her each evening. . ,

The opportunities also exist at the hospital for patients to
further their education, to learn a trade, or to work on various
projects provided by the staff. -

All of these activities, privileges, and opportunities help to
keep patient morale high. .

The hospital first opened in 1899, with facilities for 60 patients.
The staff then consisted of one doctor and. a nurse. NJH now has
325 beds, 18 buildings on 16%. acres, and separate services for
children and adults. The clinical, research, and administrative
staffs now total 522, including 35 attending physicians and surgeons
and five specialist scientists.

Tuberculosis, which continues to take 3,000,000 lives each year-

in the world, is still a major concern of NJH. However, attention
is given to diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic bron-
chitis, silicosis, and emphysema as well. _

From a sanatorium that treated only TB, National Jewish
Hospital has become well known for its surgical department, its
research and teaching facilities. Research ranges from basic
studies on tissue growth to the search for a faultless artificial

heart valve.
"None May Enter Who Can Pay"

The motto of the hospital is, “None may enter who can pay
. . . none can pay who enter.” The hospital is entirely supported
by Jewish charities and other individual contributions. The list
of contributors, Jewish and Christian, now numbers more than
250,000. Treatment for tuberculosis is very costly and it is nearly
impossible for families with average incomes to pay for the kind
of care received at NJH. But there is no charge to the patients
here.

I have resolved that, after returning home and to my work,
I shall make a contribution each year and also urge others to
donate. It certainly is one of the most worthy causes I can think
of.

In closing, I want to say that I am grateful and appreciative
to everyone connected with the hospital for everything they have
done for me. I am thankful there is a National Jewish Hospital,
which’ stands as a symbol of hope to many.

Open letter to Candidate Goldwater: §;”§%‘£°§§3§ti?t....

Dear Senator Goldwater:

In announcing your decision
to seek the Republican presi-
dential nomination, you said you
‘wanted to give the American

T people a “clear choice” in the
' 1964 election.
« ~ No one could argue with that.
- ‘No’ other GOP prospect now in
sight would make the choice
nearly as clear, for no other has
been so sharply at odds with
; the whole direction of U.S. for-
‘ eign. and domestic policy for
the last 30 years.

But if the choice is a clear
one, senator, do you honestly
believe that it will fall on you?

-. No_ man has ever been elected
to the presidency who stood out-
side the main stream of Amer-
ican political thought, and that
is where you have appeared to
‘stand for nearly a decade.

"If you intend to convince

(American voters that this is not

' _.the case,tyou will have to ex-

 "plain statements like these, all
.[‘,:n'1alde since 1960:

-4  A. (“I have always favored with-
7 drawing recognition from Rus-
 sia. . , . We should withdraw
A, _. diplomatic relations with all

 Communist governments includ-

,  ing "that of the Soviet Union.”

’ '  ‘fl am quite serious in my

 éopinion‘-that TVA should be sold

" '.:,_..-.; . it would be better operated

and would be of more benefit to

more people if it were a part of
private industry.”

  
 
  
 

b , Q “I have come to the reluc- .
 taut conclusion that the United '

States no longer has a place in
M the United Nations.”

 O “The graduated tax is a
confiscatory tax . . . I am
against the p-rogressive feature

, ,.'of,_the income tax.”
  “We must ourselves be pre-
pared to undertake military
 “ . operations against vulnerable
’ Communist regimes . . . we
-, should invite the Communist
ﬁ",‘~.‘lleaders to choose between total
 destruction of the Soviet Union,
5 and accepting a local defeat.”
 0 “Despite the recent holding
j-of,-the Supreme Court, I am
firmly convinced not only that
,_:integrated schools are not re-
"quired but that the Constitution
‘Tdoes not permit any interfer-
’,ence* whatsoever by the federal
jgovernment in the field of edu-
:cation . . ..I don’t believe the

jpreme law of the land.”, ,
 ’ Q “One of the most important

We realize senator, that you
have modified or contradicted a
number of statements, but this
tends to give us concern rather
than reassurance. It suggests
a carelessness of thought and
speech, a wavering and incon-
sistency of position which would
ill become the leader of the
United States in a tense world
in a nuclear age.

We realize also that some
Americans would approve these
statements, unmodified and un-
contradicted. But we think the
political history of the last 30
years‘ —- reinforced by the con-
sistent findings of the opinion
polls—is abundant evidence that
most Americans would not}

0 You have opposed the nu-
clear test ban treaty and voted
against it. Would you try to
abrogate it, if you were presi-
dent?

Q You have proposed giving
field commanders or the com-
mander of NATO the power to
use tactical nuclear weapons
without consulting the president.

Would you move to implement
that proposal from the White
House?

0 You have proposed selling

the TVA, abolishing the, REA,

ending farm subsidies and alter-
ing the progressive feature of
the income tax. Is that what the
nation could expect if you were
elected?

{You have called the late

‘-Senator Joseph McCarthy of

Wisconsin a credit to the GOP
and described his censure by
the Senate as “the dirtiest day’s

work” in the lives of the sen-

ators who voted against him.
Would you then restore Mc-
Carthy’s methods and approach
if you became head of the gov-
ernment?

Uncertainty about the an-
swers to these questions will
continue to plague many Amer-
icans, as long as you are a
candidate for the nomination.
This will be so even if you an-
swer no, because your positions
have changed swiftly and,'radi-
cally in the past. ,

In the months’ ahead, senator,
you may ‘be able, to explain
away a good many of the
things you have said and done.
But the Very qualities which
would offer the voters a ‘‘clear
choice” in,1964 are those that
have ﬁxed you in their minds
as an extremeist. ' ,

Whether, the Republicans will
have the wisdom to reject you
we do not know, but, if they
lack that wisdom, they will be
courting political disaster.

RISING PRICES for non-ferrous metals and products were in

the news in recent weeks. Here’s the list:

Lead—Up one-half cent per pound to 13 cents. Fourteen months
ago the price was 91/2 cents.

Cadmium—Up 35 cents to $3 per pound. In January, 1963, price
was $1.70 per pound.

Antimony—Up 31/2 cents to 351/2 cents per pound.

Copper—U.S. producers price unchanged at 31 cents per pound.
Increasing upward pressure on copper price is indicated by higher
quotations on New York Commodity Exchange and London Metal

Exchange. Phelps Dodge, other U.S. producers, and African pro-

ducers have lifted production cuts and are selling all they can turn
out. American Metal Market says upward price pressure dominates
copper market, that buyers are betting on a hike in producers’
31-cent price.

Zinc—-Price increased one-half cent to 131/,2 cents by National
Zinc, American Metal Climax, and Eagle-Picher. Increase was re-
scinded when other producers failed to go along. Meanwhile, pro-
ducers’ supplies of zinc continue to shrink,‘ leading to tight situation
in special high grade used in zinc die-casting. Price increase prob-
ably depends on U.S. government decision on die-casters’ appeals
to release imported zinc now being held in bond in the U.S.

Brass—Brass mills raise prices on copper and brass tube and

pipe about 2 cents per pound, up 4 percent.

6 There’s no doubt about it. This promises to be the biggest year
for profits and production in non-ferrous metals in nearly ten years.
There will be many more price increases during 1964. For inte-
grated mining, smelting, and refining companies, every increase
of one cent per pound-of metal means a rise in gross profits of $20
per ton, and approximately $10 per ton after federal tax. Multiply
the yearly tonnage produced at the mine by these amounts and you
can figure what these price increases will add to annual profits for
your company.

‘k ‘k ‘k

PRODUCTION of non-ferrous metals, as well as price, is on
the way up. Recent straws in the wind:

Lead—Wall Street Journal says U.S. mine production of lead
in 1964 will be up nearly 25 percent over 1963. St. Joseph Lead an-
nounces plans to double the capacity of its smelter at Herculaneum,
Missouri. A new mine in the lead belt, the Fletcher, will produce
60,000 tons of lead per year. The Viburnum mines will be expanded
this year, adding 20,000 tons to annual production.‘

Zinc—Wall Street Journal says U.S. zinc mine production in

1964 will be about 575,000 tons. 1963 production was about520,000 -

tons; 1962, 505,000 tons. American Zinc, Lead, and Smelting Com-
pany announces it will dewater the North Friends Station mine in
Tennessee and sink a new shaft. Also planned is the new Immel
mine and the New Market mine. These developments, added to the
new mines in Washington previously reported, will boost annual
zinc production of the company by about 100,000 tons per year.
Copper—Kennecott Chino Mines Division will boost mine pro-
duction of copper by 24 percent over the next two or three years.
San Manuel division of Magma Copper announces expansion of pri-
mary crusher and mill to boost daily ore capacity by 4,000 tons.

‘Ir * it '

KENNECOTT COPPER COMPANY, which got its start with
the old Kennecott mine in southern Alaska, now worked out, is back
in the’ newest state in a big way. The company announced purchase
of a group of copper mining claims above the Arctic Circle, north-
east of Nome, for an estimated $3 million. Two old sourdoughs who
prospected the area for years split better than $21/2 million between

them. .
‘k ‘A’ ‘k

ANACONDA COMPANY, which has had a 79 percent stock in-
terest in Anaconda Wire and Cable Company, will absorb the wire
and cable company entirely, paying off outside stockholders with
an exchange of stock. Anaconda made other news last month: Se-
vere unemployment in Anaconda‘, Montana has resulted from the
transfer of concentration operatio-ns to the new automated concen-
trator in "Butte and the ensuing layoff at the Anaconda smelter.
President Johnson has directed a special task force to go to Ana-
conda to see how federal-state aid can be mobilized to alleviate
widespread distress in the community.

ANACONDA AMERICAN BRASS announces that the Buffalo
Division has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Mint to produce
enough nickel-copper alloy metal to make 500 million new five-cent
pieces. This is the first contract for the 25% nickel-75% copper alloy
awarded to the Buffalo plant. The alloy goes out in strips nine inches
wide, wound in coils, from which the nickels are punched out by the
mint. Scrap from the punching is returned to Buffalo for remelting
and rerolling into more strip.

AMERICAN METAL CLIMAX INC. has announced a $40 million
expansion program in Colorado -which will involve a new process for
the recovery‘ of molybdenum. The -new plant, expected to be com-
pleted in 1966, will eventually create about 100 new jobs in ore
handling and recovery, according to Ed Eisenach, the resident man-
ager at Climax. The new process is a hydro-metallurgical method
of precipitating molybdenum from the oxide ores which previously
hadbeen waste material. . .

284 men were killed working in U.S. coal mines in 1963, according to the U.S. Bureau of Mines.
The Bureau has not yet released data on the number killed in metal and mineral mining, but the
total is believed to be in excess of the 212' men killed in 1962. United Mine Workersof America
Safety Director Charles Ferguson says, “The carnage continues. It is unnecessary; it is prevent-
able. The UMWA knows it. Federal and state mining departments know it,‘and mine management

knows i .”

UMWA President W. A. (Tony) Boyle says, “We are mechanizing the coal industry beyond the

point of safety, and concern
for production should not out-
weigh the industry’s protection

_of the precious human lives in

its custody.’’

’ “The same factors-—mechani-
zation, speedup, and lack of.

_ concern on the part »of mine

management lie behind the dis-
graceful safety record of the
metal and mineral mining and
processing industries,” says A.
C. Skinner, Mine-Mill president.
The U.S. mining industry suf-\
fered three major disasters
from explosions in 1963. These
occurred at the Clinchfield Coal

‘Company near Clarksburg, West

Virginia in April, claiming 22
lives; at the Texas Gulf Sulphur
Company’s potash mine ‘near
Moab, Utah in August, claiming
18 lives; and at the Carbon
Fuel Company’s mine near
Helper, .Utah in December,
claiming nine lives.

Major mine disasters in other
countries claimed over 600 lives
in 1963. These included an ex-
plosion at the Mitsuii Miiki coal
mine in Kyushu, Japan which
killed 452 and. injured '-450;’ a’
ﬂooding, at the Ijengede" iron
mine in ‘Broistedt, Germany
where 29 died; a coal mine ex-

gary which killed 26; an
elevator cage failure at the As-
hanti Goldfields Corp. mine in
Ghana which resulted in the
drowning of 14; and a fall of
rock which killed six and injured
14 at the Western Deep Level
Gold Mine at Carltonville, South
Africa.

The Anvil Chorus

U.S. metal and mineral mine
operators show increasing con-
cern over growing public aware-
ness of the shocking safety and
health conditions in the industry
which were exposed in Interior
Secretary Udall’s hard-hitting
report to Congress last No-
vember.

‘ James Boyd, president of
Copper Range Company in Mi-
chigan, writes in the December
Mining Congress Journal that
mine management must f‘take
positive action to strengthen its .
safety efforts . , . in order to
Satisfy its employees, the public
and Congress that mandatory
federal control in this field is
neither desirable nor neces-
sary.” His p r o p o s a l—mine
management, without union co-
operation, sets up committees
to review state safety codes and
recommend ways in which they‘
can be. strengthened! He says if
mandatory federal" inspection
were introduced, “the gains
made in the past would likely
disappear.” What gains? Gains
111 Safety, or gains in profits
from neglect of safety permitted
under lax state safety codes?

' In editorial comment on the

 gUda11 report, Mining Congress

 Journal-’ says, “The conclusions

 

M the S§9i*etary~, .how—- 
re 93!’ vd.i:I‘¢-Gil?Opposeditos-the.

' various types
- severe damage to red blood cells

considered judgment of the min-
ing industry, except insofar as
they relate to the strengthening
of the Bureau of Mines’ training
program.”

Pay Dirt, publication of the
Arizona Small Mine -Operators
Association, but carrying big
ads inserted by the big non-fer-
rous mining companies, in an
analysis of the Metcalf-Montoya
bill, concludes ﬂatly, “State
regulation is adequate and no
other is justifiable.”

The National Western Mining
Conference, meeting in Denver,
passed a resolution February 7
urging “the federal government
to stay away from further po-
licing of mines.”

Make no mistake about it——
the mine operators are aroused,
and will be out in force at hear-
ings on the Metcalf-Montoya bill.
They will do their utmost to kill
the bill. Mine-Mill and the U.S.
labor movement will have a real
fight on their hands.to put the
bill across. As United Mine
Workers of" America President
W. A. (Tony) Boylesaid when
the Metcalf-Montoya bill was

V introduced,‘ “Federal legislation

to protect the metal miners and
smeltermen is long overdue . . .

‘Weffought for manyyears to

secure passage of the first‘ Fed-
eral Coal Mine Safety Act. We
know the Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers Union faces a similar
battle, but our organization will
support your fight for improved
health and safety standards for
your members.”

Lead Poisoning

Three studies of lead poisoning
are summarized in Industrial
Hygiene Digest for January,
1964. Major" findings:

0 Heavy exposure to lead is
associated with increased inci-
dence of cerebrovascular catas-
trophies, such as, strokes, brain
damage, and death resulting
from rupturedblood vessels in
the brain.

9 Persons with anemia of
are prone to

when exposed to lead. ,

. O 27 patients with lead poison-
ing resulting from drinking
moonshine distilled in lead-con-
taining stills were analyzed. One
patientdied, seven suffered con-

vulsions and coma. Many pa-
tients suffered nausea and
abdominal pain, three so severe
as to require surgical explora-
tory operations. Blood damage
was noted in a number of cases.
Where diagnosis was‘ possible,
treatment resulted in recovery
after excretion of high quantities
_of lead.

iUi-uh Coal Mine Explosion C

The nine men killed in’ the
explosion at the Carbon Fuel
Company’s coal mine near’Hel-
per, Utahjon December 16 died
from carbon monoxide poison-
ing, according to the U. S.

Bureau "of Mines’ report on the L

disaster. . A

. The report found that the con-
tinuous mining machine in use
where the blast occurred, had
been operating 36 feet ahead of
the line brattice, or curtain,
used to direct fresh air to the
working face. Thus, in effect,
the machine had outrun its
supply of ventilating air which
servesjto dissipate gas and dust
liberated in mining.

. “The _m,achine’s cutterhead
was raised and rock comprising
the mine roof had been cut, in-
dicating the possibility of a
frictional spark. However, be-
cause this machine and two
other electrically-operated ones

in the explosion area had been .

in nonpermissible condition
when the disaster occured, in-
vestigators could not rule out
the possibility of ignition by
electrical spark or are. Evidence
that adequate tests for gas were
not being made and that one
bank of water sprays on the
continuous miner was not in
operating condition, which wor-
sened the coal dust condition at
the face and in the return air-
way, were noted as contributing
factors in the report.

The report notes that failure
to give enough‘ attention to di-
recting the ventilating current
to working faces and failure to
test frequently enough for gas
are “weaknesses” commonly
encountered in Bureau investi-
gations of coal-mine explosions.
Major recommendations include
items requiring that volume and
velocity of air passing over the
face area be sufficient to render
harmless and carry away flam-

“Its passage willmark the be-

that “America will never be a

“To keep one’s eye on pro-
