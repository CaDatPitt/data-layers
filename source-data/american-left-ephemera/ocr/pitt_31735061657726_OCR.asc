FORGE FIGEIEING UNITY AGAINST TIE WALL STREET WARMAKERS and the EXPIDITERS (W /
of the SOUTHERN MASSES By ‘Jim Ilackson

(Abridged Report to the Southern A Regional Conference of
the Communist Party of the United States, April 22-23, 1950)

In the opening report to the recently concluded National Committee's plenary
session (March 23-25), Comrade Gus Hall stated: "The single, all-dominating
issue that has emerged in the center of the world stage is the struggle for
peace in general, and specifically the struggle to defeat the reactionary im-
perialist drive of Wall Street in its attempt to conquer, enslave and sub-
jugate the we rld."

This statement has special validity for the South, because it is here that

Wall Street is building the A- and H-Bombs; it is here that Wall Street has built
its largest installations for the training of troops for use against the peoples
of the world. It is also here that Wall Street imperialism holds in subjugation
the oppressed Negro nation. The United States government's policy of national
chauvinism against foreign lands is manifested here at home in the continued sub-
jugation of the Negro nation in the Black Belt. Thus the fight for peace to pren-
vent the conquest of the peoples of other lands, becomes at the same time the
fight to liberate the already subjugated Negro nation at home.

The liberation struggle of the Negro nation in the Black Belt of the South is the
r rims anti-imperialist, anti-fascist, revolutionary force whose further develop-
ment -- in. intimate relationship with the agrarian revolutionary and working-
class movement -- nerges wiih and serves the cause of peace.

Once the problem of the struggle for peace is posed in this light we can anti-
cipate the emergence of two tendencies, both incorrect.

First, there will be the tendency to see the fight for peace as an issue separat-
ed from the struggle for democratic liberties, and, second, the tendency to

view the fight for democratic liberties as an issue separated from the fight

for peace.

The very severity of the national oppression of the Negro people -— disfranchised,
lynohed, Jim-Crowed -- gives rise to such tendencies. The Negro people and the
progressive forces are correctly concerned with the need for the broadest unity
for struggle against this national oppression and the consequent restriction of
democratic rights of the white workers and farmers of the South as well. They
must now come to understand that the key to attaining the broadest support for
the further development of the struggle for democratic rights and national lib-
eration is to be found in the fight for peace. For me fight for peace is in
essence a fight against Wall Street, the subjugator of the Negro nation, the ex-
ploiter of Southern masses. Also, an effective peace movement can grow and de-
velop only if it is linked with the economic and social needs of we rkers in

the industries, of the share-croppers and small farmers, of the professionals
and small store-keepers, of the youth, the masses of women, and all other anti-
Wall Street groups. The peace movement must represent thesum total of these
groupings, and, in the first place, the workers in general and the Negro people
in particular. There can be no serious fight for democracy in the South unless
it is directed against Wall Street and its war policies.

SOUTHERN MASSES WANT PEACE

Enormous responsibilities rest upon the shoulders of Southern Communists. Despite
the special efforts of Wall Street to convert the South into a major base for
manpower, resources, and jingoist support for the war program,'we Communists

must see beyond ﬁne synthetic jingoism of the press; we must see the msses of
Negro and white Southerners who, like people in all other sections of our
country, want peace.

The major church denominations in the South -- Methodist, Baptist, Episcopalian,
Adventists, etc. -- have gone on record in their national bodies for banning the
A. and H-bombs and for peace. They have also gone on record against the Mundt-
Ferguson bill, the war measure which is designed to block opposition to war pre-
parations under the guise of anti-Comunism.

Despite the support given to Wall Street's program for world domination by the
Murrays, Greens, Rﬁuthers, Careys, Rieves, Hutchesons, and others, the labor
movement has nevertheless spoken out against the Mundt-Ferguson bill.

Yet despite these sentiments there does not yet exist an organized movement for
peace. To assist in every way to bring such a movement into being, is a prime
responsibility. The opportunity to do so exists.

The war makers look to the South as a huge reservoir of manpower for the imper-
ialist armies which they impatiently anticipate launching against the world. They
look upon the South as a major contributor of raw materials for constructing the
implements and machinery of destruction. They look upon it as a base of jingo-

ist patrioteering and arduous support for theix'bloody adventure at world conquest.

out when the Southern masses take a close look at the leaders of the war camp,
they will recognize the hardened, brutal faces of the traditional'Wall Street
despoilers of the South.

WALL smear coums _c_>__1§ was some

Upon what factors in Southern life does Wall Street stake its hopes for the sup-
port of the Southern people for its war program?

Wall Street counts upon the martial tradition of the white upper classes. It
hopes to glamorize its military operations in the eyes of the white masses by
means of sectional pride -- "a Southern son makes good." Wall Street would rely
upon the fact that the South has been to the United States what Prussia was to
Germany -- the birthplace of a Junker caste of military elite. Southerners con-
stitute the majority of all commands of the ground, air and sea forces.

Because of climate and because of the traditional mission of the government in
repressing Negro liberation struggles, the South has been and remains the primary
camp ground of the ared forces. It is studded with permanent installations of
the Army, Marines and Air Corps. The Southern states appropriate more from the
mea ger budgets for the construction of national guard armories and the mainten-
ance of gaudily uniformed home guards -- festocned in the colors and plumes of
Confederate regiments -- than any other states in the Union; they take care,
however, to preclude any possibility of Negro enrollment. Southern youth are
subjected to the jingcism of the ROTC from high school through the state-supported
universities. The upper classes traditionally send their young sons to the Prus-
sianized private boys‘ schools, such as the Citadel in Charlestown. They often
finish their education in the science of mass murder and military dictatorship at
such institutions as Virginia Military Institute and Virginia Pclytechnical Inst.

WAR PLANS DEFEND ON CEAUVINISM

‘Wall Street places a high dependence on the effects of chauvinist "conditioning"
of the white people of die South; it hopes that this chauvinist conditioning will
ropel the Southern people into ﬁie camp of the would-be world conquerors. White
rupremacy, as the dominant ideology of the official South, fortified by law, cus-
tom and cultural and educational institutions, is the ideological tie between the
dell Street exploiters of the South and that section of its potential war victims

‘which is the Southern white people. Wall Street counts upon the power of white
supremcy ideology to blind the white masses to their common interests with the
Negro masses in resistance to the program of war, fascism, exploitation. The
propagandists of Wall Street's policies have never been so vocal in their praise
of the so-called 98 percent Anglo-Saxon "purity" of the white Southerners as they
are today. Here, they believe, are "Aryan" people, experienced in the swaggering
ways of the oppressor, conditioned through their preferment over, and domination
of, the Negro people, indeed the source of a proper cadre of overseers for a Wall
Street enslaved world.

Wall Street relies upon its Southern politicians to deliver a "solid South" in
support of the war program. Southern Dixiecrats, Trumancrats, and reactionaries
of all stripes, dccupy prominent posts among the leading advocates and spokesmen
for the war policies of Truman's Wall Street government. They head such strategic
committees as House Armed Services and ten of the other 19 standing House commit-
tees. Senator Tom Connally of Texas is head of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, and seven other Southern stooges of Wall Street are among the fifteen
standing Senate committee chairmn. The speaker of die House is Sam Rayburn of
Texas, bitter opponent of FEPC and civil rights legislation. The head of the un-
Amerioan Activities Committee, a chief architect of the legislative blue-print for
fascism, the Mundt-Ferguson bill, is Wood of Georgia. This Dixiecrat-dominated
committee carries out the administration's function of creating a lynch atmosphere
throughout the country against Communists and all progressives. The challenge to
its illegal practices was seized upon by the administration to jail the heroic
leader of our Party, Comrade Gene Dennis.

SOUTH IS MODEL FOR POLICE STATE

The Truman-Wall Street war party feels secure about Southen support for its mad-
men's adventure, for it has confidence in, it admires, it envies, and it plots to
emulate through the Mundt-Ferguson bill, the patterns of police-state repressive
powers over the people which the lynch-law regimes of the Southern states exercise
to punitively beat down any opposition rising up from the disfranchised Negro and
In the prisoner-states of the people's liberties, the Dixiecrat
domains of J. Strom Thurmond, Fielding‘Wright, and Herman Talmadge, Truman's war
camp finds its most devoted allies in state leadership.

But Wall Street's confidence in the allegiance of the Southern masses for'world
slaughter is made of shallow stuff and will not stand the test of the over-riding
will of the South's people to live and prosper.

This Wall Street which.beckons the South to come with it to a Gethsemane has kept
the South through all these years a backward region of wasted countryside, few
cities, and undeveloped industzyz Wall Street has drained out of the South its
natural wealth, and robbed the South of its human resources. Ill-housed, ill-
clothed, ill-fed, ill and unattended, the forty million Southern people any out
for an age of peace and fruitful construction.

These Southerners, inhabiting thirteen states, make up a quarter of ﬂue population
of our country. One-quarter of thenxare Negro. ‘Within these states, some 470

-4. 4

counties constitute the Black Belt of Negro majority. Half of the country's
fanners are to be found in the South. One-fourth of the country's miners, over
half of its textile workers, one-sixth of the total number of male factory workers
in the United States, toil here in the South.

INCOME DIFFERENTIALS LN THE SOUTH

In 1949, the average per capita income for the South was $797. or 69% of the
national. average. Unskilled labor in the South was paid 17¢ an hour less than

the national average for similar jobs in 1948. In the post-war boom year of 1946,
cotton textile workers in the South received an hourly pay ave raging 74¢, when the n:
national average hourly pay was 87.555.

That half of the farmers of our country who live in the South exist on only 3%
of the national income, and the bulk of this meager income is hoarded by the
sixthof the planters who control directly almost half of the plantation lands.
The l,200,000 white and 800,000 Negro share tenants do not own the land they
till. In 1940, Southern farmers averaged but 33580 as against $3710 for the rest
of the farmers of the United States. Though their cash income has increased,
their relative position remains the same today.

With half of all the adult illiterates in the United States, the South has the
least number and the poorest equipped schools, and the lowest-paid teachers in
any part of the country.

In 1942 , 4.2% of the women in the United States who died from causes associated

with childbirth, died in the South. Their deaths can be traced directly to the 
fact that the South has less hospital and public health facilities than any 
country in the world, except China, India and Africa. E

How, then, dare the ruling class complacently assume ihat the Southe rn people
will follow its Pied Piper's tune into the sea of imperialist war? What an
arrogant insult this is to the pride, the dignity, the courage, and the intel-
ligence of the Negro ani white masses of‘ the South, who are heirs of the Southern
T.I'8.diti.OU of the Populist agrarian rebellion, and of some two hundred Negro

:. lave revolts!

Southern workers want to work, but not for war. Southe rn building trades

workers want jobs building homes, not barracks. The aluminum workers want to
see their metal return in kitchen appliances and modern living conveniences, not
in flaming planes shot down over iheir cities. Nitrate, phosphate and sulphur
workers want to see their products fashioned into drugs to heal the multitude of
ill people who limp through the towns and countryside of the South, not fashioned
into missiles of death. Steel workers of the South want the products of their
toil fashioned into tractors, not tanks.

WAR PREPARATIONS CUT INTO SOUTH'S ECONOMY 

The current war preparations have already cut deep into the South's paltry and
undeveloped economy. The cotton textile industry is plunging toward the abyss
of an industry-wide crisis. Already there is mass unemployment among the textile
workers, and unbearable speed-up for those who remain employed. The textile 5
industry and other consumer-goods industries and export industries in the South
are on the way to being chalked off as casualties of the cold war with its Marshall
Plan, its Atlantic Arms Pact, its trade barriers to the vast potential market
represented in the prospering economies of the Soviet Union, the New Democracies
and China. Exports have fallen off, leaving the port cities of New Orleans,

 

 

 

«.5-

Mobile, Charleston, Newport News, Houston and Corpus Christi stagnant pools of
commercial still-life.

In 1947, out of every $100 of. goods produced in the United States, $11.70 worth
was exported. In 1949, only 356.90 worth was exported. While ll,000 rubber
workers, many of them in Gadsden, Alabama, walk the streets in idleness, American
owned rubber factories are being opened in Java. While 2500 coal workers have
been rendered permanently jobless by production retrenchments, American imperial-
ists are reconstituting Western Germany's industrial power to fill armament orders
out of the tax-paye r's budget.

We Southerners, more than any other people in the world, have a moral obligation
to fight for peace. It was in the South that the vulture's eggs of mass murder
were first developed. . Today people think of the atom-bomb factories of Tennessee
with the same revulsion they feel when they hear ‘the words Buohenwald and Dachau.
""9, who have for so long been in need of so many things, asked for factories --
.1d they gave us Oak Ridge I

GIVE ORGANIZED EXPRESSION _1_*_c_>_ PEACE SENTIMENT

Our overriding responsibility is to work untiringly to help the Southern people
give organized expression to their peace sentiments. Millions of Southern Negro
and white men and women are to be found in organizations which meet some parti-
cular need in their lives -- churches, trade unions, ‘fraternal societies,‘social
clubs, Parent-Teachers Associations, voters’ leagues, women's federations, NAACP
councils, etc. Each of moss organizations can be gotten to manifest the will
of its members for peace on the simple propos iticn: stop the manufacture of the
H-Bomb, outlaw the A-Bomb. Through very simple initial peace actions, committees
could be formed which could remain in operation as standing committees for peace.
We must also assist in every way the establishment of local chapters of organiza-
tions dedicated primarily to ﬂie fight for peace.

We must asscciage the daily struggles of the masses for partial demands, with
the fight for peace. For instance, to remove from office the reactionary Con-
gressman Wood, serving on the un-American Committee, and the warmonger, Congress-
man Vinson, serving on me Military Affairs Committee, would serve the interests
of peace. Part of such a struggle is a campaign against the lynch-law restric-
tions on the right to vote, of the Negro people of Georgia. We must establish
the intimate relationship between the fight for peace and the economic needs of
the workers, between the fight for peace and democratic liberties, between me
fight for peace and ending the terror against the Negro people.

THE PEACE STRUGGLE AND THE 1950 EIECTIONS

"he struggle for peace is the pivot around which we must develop all of our
.:.ctivitie8 in the 1950 elections.

The loudest and must abusive voices in Congress shouting for war against the
Soviet Union and the people's democracies, and for ever more brutal repression
of the people of the United States, are the voices of the Southern bloc.

It is incumbent upon us and all progresives to exert a maximum influence upon
the candidates running in me Democratic primaries. However, it must be em-
phasized that the main blows against the Wall Street war group will be struck by
the people uniting in struggle for their pressing demands aligned around the
question of peace rather than around candidates. This is especially true in the

 

 

-6..

South, where most contests offer the people only the choice of voting for a
Trumocrat warmonger or a Dixiecrat warmonge r. Whereas, we must seek, to take
maximum advantage of the contradictions which exist between the Dixiecrats
and the Trumanites, we must never lose sight of the essential harmony between
these reactionary branches of the Wall Street war party of the South.

We might state our electoral tactic as follows:

1. The movement for the right to register and to vote remains the most important
feature of the electoral struggle in the South. We place this ahead of the

question of the candidate or his program. The disfranchised Southern masses,
Negro and white, must continue, wit: the help of the people of the North, to wage
the struggle for the right to vote, so they may eliminate from public office
their bourbon oppressors and lieutenants of the Wall Street gang.

—‘. Of basic importance is the fight for Negro representation at all levels of
avernment. There must be fullsupport to Negro candidates for County Commis-
sioners, State Legislatures, City Councils, Congress, etc.

3. We must develop the grass-roots movement for peace and use it to bring ef-

fective pressure to bear upon Congressmen and government policy. Thereby,
irrespective of the ability of the prggressive forces to put forth independent
candidates, the voters, joined in organization with the voteless masses in the
peace movement, will be able to exert pressure upon office seekers and govern-
ment policy makers.

4. We must push all aspects of the struggle for the democratic rights and
national liberation aspirations of the Negro people, and the social security
and economic needs of the Negro and white masses.

Our Party cannot in any way support candidates who are working for and speaking
for the war program and its accompanying fascist-like repressive treasures such

as the lnundt-Ferguson bill. After the primaries, basing ourselves on the con-

crete situation in the area, progressives should encourage the putting forward

of one or more independent coalition candidates as a treasure to further develop
the growing third-party sentiments of the increasing numbers of people who are

disgusted with -‘the two old parties of war, fascism and misery.

Lenin has said: "The whole of life is an endless chain consisting of an in-
finite nurrber of links. The whole art of politics lies in finding the link that
is least likely to be torn out of our hands, the one that is most important at
the given moment, the one that guarantees tie command of the whole chain, and
having found it, in clinging to that link as tightly as possible." The over-
all issue, the key link for unfolding all of the work of our Party, must become
we fight for peace.
