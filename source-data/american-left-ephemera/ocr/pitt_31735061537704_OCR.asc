 

And at this very moment, throughout the world, Communist
Parties, as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria»,
etc., are contributing all their energies to helping ensure a
peaceful course of social development for their countries. Al
the same time, American and British imperialists are giving
aid and comfort to the pro-fascists in these countries, as well as
in France, who seek to foment disorder and bloodshed calcu-
lated to bring the reactionaries into power.

However, in the interests of democracy and peace, we Amer-
ican Communists place as the central task of the coming pe-
riod, the need of rallying the broadest labor and democratic
coalition for the defeat of the forces of pro-fascist reaction at
home and abroad. And this is the only way forward to orderly
social advancement.

We have made abundantly clear the character of our im-
mediate and long-range aims. Our immediate objective is to
protect the living standards and democratic rights of the
American people and to prevent fascism from coming to
power. We work to defeat the anti—1abor legislation of the
G.O.P. and the Southern Bourbons; to promote the economic
security of the people; to help win equal rights for the Negro
people and full civil liberties for all; and to safeguard and
implement the cause of peace and Big Three unity, particu-
larly through the fulﬁllment of the Potsdam, Moscow, and
Teheran agreements.

Our ultimate objective is socialism, that is, the common
ownership and operation of the national economy under a
government of the people, led by the working class. We strive
to convince the people that only the establishment of socialism
can end the scourge of economic crisis, unemployment, pov-
erty and war. We Communists are convinced that, in the long
run, the masses of the people will realize the necessity for a
socialist solution of their problems and that they will take
the necessary steps to achieve it.

We Communists are not adventurers or utopians, and as
Marxists we know that we must distinguish between what is
possible today and what can be realized tomorrow.

That is why in the present period our policy must be and is
directed toward achieving certain vital immediate objectives
(though limited in the sense that they fall far short of so-
cialism), namely, to curb the powers of the monopolists and
to check and defeat pro-fascist reaction. If that is accom-
plished, the _American working class, and the democratic
forces generally, will be able when they so desire, to march
forward along the road of social progress toward socialism,
a road determined by our own special American conditions,
and not necessarily identical with the paths being taken in
democratic advance, including toward socialism, by the peo-
ples of other countries.

QUESTION: “There is no diﬂerence between Commu-
nism and fascism in so far as-totalitarian disregard for
personal rights and freedom is concerned.”

ANSWER: Communism and fascism are as different as day
is from.night. As I ‘stated on September 19, in Madison
Square Garden:

. . . We say to American labor: the criminal falsehood
that Communism and fascism are Siamese twins, this pro-
lascist attempt to identify opposites, is an old trick. . ..
Not only the Communists but also millions of non-Party
anti-fascists know: fascism is the open, ruthless dictator-
ship of the most reactionary monopolies, of the Sixty
Fainilies; Socialism is the rule of the workers in alliance
with the working farmers and~all common people. Fas-
cism is race hatred, pogroms and lynching; Socialism is
the equality and friendship of peoples and nations. Fas-
cism is the debasement and destruction of all cultural
values, of human decency; Socialism means the ﬂourishing
of culture, the achievement of the dignity of man. Fas-
cism organizes war; Socialism champions peace. These
are facts, proven by life, by history. . . . ‘

This is not just a question of theory. In the great anti-
. 9

 

fascist war which was for our country as well as for others, as
President Roosevelt said, a war of survival, the Socialist Soviet
Union was our staunchest ally and bore the main brunt of
the war; and in every country the Communists were among
the best and most self-sacriﬁcing ﬁghters for the preservation
of the democratic achievements of their peoples and for the
liberation of their countries. This was not an accident. ll
followed from the position of the Communists of all lands
as great patriots, as the most resolute ﬁghters for democracy
and social progress, and the most uncompromising foes of
fascism, which is the mortal enemy of all democracy. One
does not have to be a Communist to recognize that the greatest
issue of our time is the conﬂict between democracy and fascism,
and that Communism and fascism are diametrically opposite
and the struggle between them is to the death. The history
of the anti-Axis war, including the role of the Communists in
all national resistance movements, should S11ﬂ'lC€ to make this
crystal clear. ,

As to personal rights, under capitalism, the personal freedom
and “dignity” of the individual is determined, in the last
analysis, by how much money one has. It is only under
socialism; that the masses of the people can come into their
own,’ and’ that the full ﬂowering of the individual will be pos-
sible. The truth of this is attested to from time to time even
by some of the correspondents of the New York Times, when
reporting objectively on the Socialist Soviet Union.

QUESTION: “Party members are interested only in power

and destroy those organizations which they cannot con-
trol.”

ANSWER: The Communist Part consists of American citi-
o < O y 0

Lens who, like most of their fellow-Americans, belong not
onl to a olitical art but also to the economic, cultural,

Y 1? P . Y . . .
and professional organizations which correspond to their occu-
pation, profession, or artistic interests. Within these organi-
no

 

 

zations, the Communists work together with the rest of the
membership to solve effectively the special and common prob-
lems with which all are concerned. Governed and abiding by
the program and democratic processes and decisions of these
organizations, the Communists also contribute their political
understanding toward the solution of all problems.

The Communists do not demand special privileges for them-
selves in these mass organizations, but they do claim for them-
selves equal rights with all other members on a ‘democratic
basis. Communists naturally, as is their democratic right,
openly express their political views within the framework of
the mass organizations to which they belong. They zealously
carry out the-program and decisions of these organizations and
ask to be judged solely by one criterion—do they or do they
not promote the interests of each organization and its mem-
bership? - ~ ?

Far from trying to “control” the organizations to which they
belong, the policy of the Communists is to promote the wel-
fare of the mass organizations and their membership, actively
to participate in the life of these organizations, and to subject
themselves to the democratic will of the majority. Contrari-
wise, time and time again it has been demonstrated that the
very ones who are loudest in charging Communist “interfer-
ence” or “domination” resort to splitting various mass or-
ganizations when the membership does not go along with them
in their divisive and reactionary “Red-baiting" policies.

The best answer to the slanderous charge that the Com-
munists try to destroy organizations they cannot control, lies
in the issues we have initiated and fought for andthe results
we have helped obtain. Our Party spearheaded the struggle of
labor and the common people on such issues as unemploy-
ment insurance, the organization of the unorganized, equal
rights for the Negro people, the struggle against fascism and
war and for collective security, etc. It was in the course of the
principled struggle for such vital needs of the people that the
Communists demonstrated their selﬂess devotion to the mass
organizations to which they belong and won the position of

11

    

respect they hold among the forward-striving sections of the
people.

QUESTION: “The party functions as a secret society, with
most of its members mashing their identity as a means of
misleading those who would refuse to associate with them
if they operated openly as Communists.”

ANSWER: The Communist Party, far from being a “secret
society,” functions openly in accordance with the U.S. Con-
stitution and the Bill of Rights. What otherwise is the mean-
ing of the open proclamation of our views, of our press and
publications, our public meetings, open recruiting and all
other mass activities? It is only where the U.S. Constitution
is violated and democratic rights are restritted, as in various
states in the Bourbon-ridden South and in many company-
controlled towns in the North, that the Communist Party,
against its will and desire, is deprived of its constitutional lib-
erties and is not permitted to function with the freedom ac-
corded other political organizations.

All Communists are proud of their membership in our
Party, proud to make it known to their friends, associates, and
the world at large. But just as in the citadels of the open
shop, when the C.I.O. was being organized, where the workers
in many instances could not openly proclaim their union mem-
bership, so, in some cases, because of the denial of democratic
rights and the threat of persecution. certain individual Com-
munists sometimes decide not to proclaim openly their Com-
munist identity. In such cases they are fully within their rights
as American citizens. It should be remembered that it was pre-
cisely to prevent persecution for political beliefs that the secret
ballot was introduced.

It is a notorious fact that in government and in private in-
dustry persons merely suspected of being Communists or of
associating with Communists——1et alone known Communists

’—-have been thrown out of jobs, blacklisted, and otherwise

    

12

persecuted. The Communist Party, more than anyone else, is
concerned to end a situation in which some individual Com-
munists do not feel free to proclaim their Party membership
because of the threat of the blacklist or economic insecurity
to themselves or persons who associate with them. This is
one of the reasons why our Party opposes and calls upon the
entire people to oppose the House Un-American Committee,
the witchhunts of J. Edgar Hoover, and all legislation which
violates the Bill of Rights and discriminates against demo-
cratic minority groups. Further, and basically, we oppose all
such committees, witchhunts, and legislation because they are
part and parcel of the offensive of Big Business which aims at
whittling down the civil liberties of the American people and
strengthening the forces of pro-fascist reaction.

QUESTION: “The party maintains iron discipline and re-
viles those within its own membership who dissent from
its policies more bitterly than it does its enemies on the
right.”

ANSWER: The Communist Party maintains the maximum
degree of inner party democracy and unity. All basic decisions
are arrived at through democratic ‘processes which put to
shame the pretenses to democracy of “its enemies on the right”
who accuse the Communist Party of being “undemocratic."
All of our decisions are collective decisions reached by vol-
untary agreement and majority vote, and then are binding
upon all. Our democratically constituted national conven-
tions are regularly preceded by a designated period of free
pre-convention discussion involving the entire membership.
The general policy and the decisions adopted by the conven-
tion then become mandatory upon every member. It is non-
sense to say that our Party “reviles those within its own mem-
bership who dissent from its policies._ . . .” Discussion and
application of policy within our ranks is based, like our “iron
discipline,” on principle. It is true that we do not speak

13

 

kindly of those whom we expel from our Party as enemies of
the working class, but then, the American people have never
spoken gently of their Benedict Arnolds.

QUESTION: “The party subscribes to the notion that the
end justiﬁes the means, with the result that its members
lie, steal and even kill to advance the Party’s cause.”

ANSWER: This slander that our members will ‘‘lie, steal and
even kill to advance the party's cause” is an attempt to at-
tribute to us the jungle “ethics” of Big Business and the pro
fascists. ,

It is a matter of record that our Party has, from the very
ﬁrst, repudiated such predatory and anarchistic views. We
hold that the end and the means are interconnected, that one
rests upon, or ﬂows from, the other. Even as our ends are just,
and serve the cause of our people and humanity, so too are the
means, methods, and the tactics which we employ to move the
people in defense of their immediate and long-range interests.

Our Party and its members boldly proclaim the truths which
will free humanity. Our enemies—the big'trusts, the pro—fas-
cists and their agents—fear, distort, and cover up the truth.
They shudder at any accurate presentation of the facts of social
and political life. They fear any unmasking of the evils of
capitalism, of reaction and fascism, especially their American
varieties. They strive to conceal the Nazi-like barbarism of
the lynchers, the Southern Junkers. They dread the public
unveiling of the warmongers. They seek to erect an “iron
curtain” between the American people and their great and
tested allies, the Soviet Union and the new European democ-
racies.

As to “stealing,” it is not the Communists who rob the
United States treasury in wartime or peacetime. It is not the
Communists who wax fat on war contracts or tax frauds and
exemptions. And it is not the Communists who daily and
hourly rob the toilers of the fruits of their labors.

14

 

 

As for the canard that Communists “kill” to achieve their
ends, we call attention to the fact that it is capitalist society
especially in is present stage, imperialism, which kills millions
through economic crises and wars, through the treadmill of
exploitation, through colonial oppression, and through cul-
tivated national, racial and religious prejudices and conflicts.

As for the implication that Communists promote acts of
terrorism, assassination, and putsches, we state that we con-
demn, on principle, such precepts and practices. Any honest
study of the theory and practice of the Communist Party will
expose the preposterousness of such a charge.

We American Communists are patriots and Marxists, and
for us there is only one road of action open—the road of pub-
lic mass action. It is for that reason that we favor and support
only such actions and movements which will enlist the co-
operation and sympathy of the decisive majority of the people,
the working people and all other anti-fascists and democrats.

On this question of ends and means, as on all other ques-
tions, we Communists are willing to let the record of our ac-
tions make clear the truth as to our views. It is notwe, but
our enemi~es——the enemies of the American people—who fear

and shun the truth. We Communists ‘disdain to conceal our

views and- aims.
Sincerely, '

EUGENE DENNIS,
General Secretary,
Communist Party, U.S.A.

“is COMMUNISM UNAMERICANP
By Eugene Dennis

January 24, 1947
Mr. A. H. Raskin,
The New York Times,
229 West 43rd Street,
New York 18, N. Y.

Dear Mr. ‘ Raskin:

In reply to your recent inquiry regarding the position of the
Communist Party on a number of questions, I wish to com-
ment brieﬂy as follows: '

QUESTION: “The first loyalty of the Communist Party is
to the Soviet Union and it is only secondarily cancer
with American welfare.” .

.1NSWER: The ﬁrst and only loyalty of American Com-

munists is to -our working class, our people and our country, v

of which we are an integral part. As I stated in Madison
Square Garden on September 19, 1946:

We American Communists give allegiance to only one
power: to the sovereign power that resides in the Ameri-
can people. We are American workers, Marxists and,pa-
triots. Today and on the morrow, as in the ast, in war
or in peace, we will loyally defend the genuinenational
interests of our people, of our country.

Some 15,000 Communists sealed this sacred pledge with

loyal and exemplary service in the war against Hitlerism and

japanese militarism; and, years before that, some 4,000 Amer-
ican Communists likewise honored this principle by ﬁghting

and dying in freed0m’s cause and our country's interests-

against Franco fascism.

3

 

  

What is really at the bottom of the unfounded charge that
we are “disloyal” is the fact that we have worked tirelessly
for American-Soviet cooperation." Because of our resolute
position in favor of American-Soviet friendship the anti-So-
vieteers, the warmongers, who are intensely anti—American, try
to brand us as “foreign agents.” But this slanderous charge
will not deter us from continuing to advocate and consistent-
ly ﬁght for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s program for U.S.A.-U.S.S.R.
amity and collaboration which is sovvital to our country’s na-
tional security and the cause of world peace. It is this loyal,
patriotic concern for our country’s welfare that should bring
every true American to work actively for strengthening our
nation’s ties, in mutual interest, with our great and staunchest
wartime ally, the Soviet Union.

Finally, it must be said that it is not the Communists but
the trusts—the du Ponts, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel, General
Electric, etc.—-who have a loyalty other than to the United
States and the American people. They—the trusts—are the
ones who p-ut their monopoly and cartel interests above the
interests of the nation. They are the ones who are ready at all
times to betray the nation to advance their reactionary and
proﬁteering aims.”“

* This has been corroborated by the evidence unearthed by the
Senatorial committees headed by Truman, Bone, and Kilgore. It is now
a matter of common knowledge that before the war American monopo-
lies, such as Standard Oil of New Jersey, du Pont, General Electric, and
the Aluminum Company of America, maintained cartel relations and ex-
changed crucial patents with, and supplied raw material to, the German
and Japanese trusts. American Big Business thus, jeopardized the na-
tional security of our country. In one form or another—for example,
through dummy corporations in Switzerland, Portugal, etc.—re1ations‘
were maintained with the German cartelists during the war itself. Today
the American monopolies are working to re-establish, under their dom-
ination, the international cartels, and to rebuild the German and _]ap—'
anese trusts and heavy industry. They are sabotaging the Big Three ac-
cords to demilitarize and denazify Germany and Japan and to destroy
their military potential. Even President Truman, in 1942, branded as

_ treason the action of Standard Oil of New Jersey in turning its synthetic

    

rubber process over to the German I.G. Farben trust. while withholding
it from the United States government.

QUESTION: “The party is part of a ‘world-wide ﬁfth col.-
umn’ serving the interests of the U.S.S.R.”

. ANSWER: The Communist Party is an American working-

class political party. ‘It arose and developed from the life and
struggles of the American people. It bases itself on the needs
and aspirations of the American people and utilizes the uni-
versally applicable principles of the social science of the work-
ing class, Marxism. Dedicated to the interests of the American
working people, the C.P.U.S.A. unmasks and combats all na-
tive and imported ﬁfth co1umnists—-the reactionary and fascist
elements, the agents of monopoly capital. That is why, over

the years, we have waged political warfare against. the Gerald ,

L. K. Smiths, the Father Coughlins, the K.K.K., the Silver
Shirts, the Hearsts and McCormicks, and now also against
American Action, Inc. It was the Goerings, Ribbentrops and
Schachts—not the German Communists, the Thaelmanns and
Piecks—whom the United Nations tribunal recently con-
demned as enemies of humanity and traitors to their people.
This parallel is more than valid for the United States.

Far from being a “world-wide ﬁfth column,” Communist
Parties throughout the world, as in France, Yugoslavia, China.

Brazil, etc., have already won the respect of their people as -

being the best patriots, the best, defenders of the national in-
terests of their countries. That is the role to which the Com-
munists in the United States-the tested sonsland daughters of
the American working class—serve and are equally and ar-
dently committed.

What is true of the allegation that we Communists are part
of a “world-wide movement” is the fact that we are not only
American patriots but also working class internationalists.
This, in fact, makes us better Americans devoted to the gen-

,uine interestsof our country. In this—in our solidarity with

all freedom-loving peoples——we are true to the traditions of
Paine, Jefferson, and Lincoln. We subscribe fully to Lincoln's
declaration that

 . . The strongest bond of human sympathy, outside of
5

 

the family relation, should be one uniting all working
people, of all nations and tongues, and kindreds. . . ."-

QUESTION: “The party receives instructions and finan-
cial support from Russia.”

ANSWER: The -Communist Party has never received “in-
structions and ﬁnancial support from Russia.” If by “Rus-
sia” is meant, repeating a deliberate confusion, the former
Communist International whose headquarters‘ were at Mos-
cow, then the statement is in place that before 1940, we were
affiliated with the Communist International, and occasionally
exchanged fraternal opinions, with our brother Communist
Parties of other "countries.

In 1940, however, with the passage of the Voorhis Act-
which we then denounced as destructive of the democratic
rights of the people and designed to destroy the Communist
Party as an open, legal political party—we severed all ties with
the Communist International. In 1943, the Communist In-

'ternational itself was dissolved.

Any identity of views reﬂected then or now in the positions
taken by our Party and other ‘Communist Parties did not nor
does not result from “international ties” or “instructions"
from the Soviet Union. The identity of views which does
exist on one question or another. results solely from an inde-
pendent interpretation of our universal science of Marxism.
of problems common to the working class of the world, and
in promoting world peace and democracy.

This does not mean that the views of all Communist Parties
are identical on all matters. In the independent development
of views it often happens that differences of opinion develop
on speciﬁc questions. The differences of opinion between
the French and German Communist Parties on the Ruhr,
of the Italian and Yugoslav Parties on Trieste, and of the
American and British Parties on the British loan, are matters
of- record. Such differences develop because each Party works

6

 

 

out its policy independently, in accord with national needs.
-They are ultimately resolved because Communists everywhere
work on the basis of a science whose principles are ointerna-
tionally valid. —

It is notorious that British and American imperialism have
given and are giving instructions and ﬁnancial support to
every backward and reactionary force throughout the world,
as in Kuomintang China, Spain and Greece, to stem the ad-
vancing tide of the world's democratic forces. However, our
Party's only ﬁnancial support comes from the advanced sec-
tions of the American working class and people. Our only
“instructions” come from the dictates of the historic and im--
mediate needs of the American working class and people.

ifriﬁriﬁr

QUESTION: “The party’s aim is the violent overthrow
of the-American system.” '

ANSWER: The position of the Communist Party on this

question is deﬁnitely embodied in the Constitution of the,

Communist Party"" which states:

. . . Adherence to or participation in the activities of any
clique, group or circle, faction or party, which conspires
or acts to subvert, undermine, weaken or overthrow any
or all institutions of American democracy, whereby the
majority of the American people can maintain their right
to determine their destinies in any degree, shall be pun-
ished by immediate expulsion. . . .

Force and violence—resistance to the process of basic social
change—have always been initiated and exercised by reaction-
ary classes bent on maintaining their power and privileges
against the will of the overwhelming majority. The counter-
revolution of the Southern Slavocracy in our own Civil War-
i861-65—is sufﬁcient proof of this historic truth.

‘Even the United States Supreme Court, ‘in its decision on June 21,
1943 in theschneiderman case, dismissed as unsubstantiated the allegation

of the then US. Attorney General, Francis J. Biddle, that the Communist
Party advocates or practices force and- violence.
