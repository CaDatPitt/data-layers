Mine-Mill Helps Reverse
Off-Year E Iecfions Trend

DENVER——President Kennedy’s Democratic party scored an upset victory in the
general elections across the nation Nov. 6, reversing a 50-year trend in which the party
in power has generally lost heavily in its congressional contests. Not since 1934, when

Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office, have the Democrats

Senate and House races.
Four Senate seats were

picked up -by the Democrats >

to increase their control of that
chamber 68 to 32. While the last
half-century’s trend in mid-
term elections indicated that the
out-of-power Republicans were
due to gain some 40 seats in
the House this year, the GOP
upped their total by only two,

performed so well in off-year

leaving the Democrats in con-
trol 259 to 176.

It appeared from this over-all
success, despite the defeat of
Senators John Carroll of Colo-
rado and J. J. Hickey of Wy-
oming as well as the failure of
House liberals David S. King
and Gracie Pfost of Utah and
Idaho to unseat their incumbent

Hearing to

Order Set

DENVER—Mine-Mill will pro-
ceed this month with its action
before the Subversive Activities
Control Board to prove once and
for all that it is not a “Com-
munist-infiltrated organization.”

The union last May filed a
post-order petition with the
SACB flatly denying the charge
and moving to have the Board’s
findings set aside. Under the
law, such a petition entitled the

‘union to a hearing to prove its

case’. Opening of the hearing
has now been set for Dec. 3
before the SACB in Washington.

At the same time, another
Mine-Mill action under the law
to have the SACB order dis-

RAISING A TOAST to the ladies Auxiliary is what Bisbee, Ariz., local

meeting of the local’s Auxiliary. Amused lady looking on happens
to be, fortunately, Mrs. Winston Elkins who also happens to be presi-

al include: full union shop;
wage increases of 10 to 15 cents
per hour over the two year peri-
od (four to nine cents effective
Nov. 3, 1962, and six c ents
across the board effective Nov.
3, 1963); four weeks of paid va-
cation for all employees with
20 or more years of seniority,
effective the first year of the
new contract (seniority is sub-
stituted for service in the con-
tract‘ in all phases providing va-
cation eligibility allowances),
which means more paid vaca-
tion for more workers).

The local hailed the new vaca-
tion clause improvement as a
breakthrough in the Buffalo
area. While there are places
which have four weeks vacation
for 25 or more years of service,
Local 813 is the first to gain
four paid weeks for 20 years of
seniority covering production
and maintenance w o r k e r s.
About 55 percent of the plant’s
workers will get the fourth paid
vacation week.

Expiring Nov. 3, 1964, the to-
tal value of the package settle-
ment is estimated at 15 cents
per hour over the two years.

The bargaining commit-
tee consisted of: John Quigley,
Ralph Hubbard, Sam Mushat,

Frank Jagodzinski, Carl Caw-'

than and Viola Lingswiler. They
were assisted by Int’l Rep. Joe
Scioli. Federal Mediator Robert

Swanson assisted the parties in 
the final stages of negotiations. ’

On Oct. 31, a new 2-year
agreement with A n a c 0 n d a

Improvements for the first
year included: a six-and-a-half
cents per hour wage rate bonus
increase effective Oct. 29, 1962,
in lieu of unworked paid holi-
days; monthly pension benefits
of $2.50 for_ each year of serv-
ice up to 35 years plus pension
vested rights at age 40 after 15
years’ service, retroactive to

Aug. 1, 1962; a three-cents-pe_r-
hour Security Benefit Plan for
each member of the unit, effec-
tive Nov. 1, 1962; a $5 per week
increase in sickness and acci-
dent benefits plus a $5 daily
room and board hospitalization

 

  

a one-week strike in August when company officials

walked out of a bargaining
session.

Fine work of the local com-
mittee backed by the member-
ship won gains estimated at 18

fringe benefits over the 2-year
period, plus other important
non-economic improvements in
seniority.

District 7 Locals Discuss Job,  
Union Problems at Conference

A RICHMOND, Ca1if.——Immediate problems concerning the union’s membership and
.,;their relation to over-all conditions in the non-ferrous metals industry were. discussed
{here Oct- 20 at a District 7 conference of rank and file leaders from locals in Cali-
fornia, Washington and Idaho.
' L Some thirty delegates and staff members participated in full discussion of all

ting adequate supplies of con-
centrates to work on.

He praised the Tacoma and
east coast locals for effective
lobbying in Washington last year
to get, U. S. action to counter

TURNING to lead, Stuart crit-
icized U. S. import quotas as be-
ing too restrictive- on concen-
trate imports while permitting
excessive imports of refined
lead and concentrates combined.

He said the answer to this
problem was adoption of Mine-
Mill’s p r o p o s e d international
commodity agreement for lead
and zinc to assure adequate sup-
lies of concentrates for U. S.
smelters.

He added that the union was
in the process of obtaining up-to-
date reports on lead concentrate
imports by the Selby smelter as
a part of its continuous review

of factors affecting employment A

at the plant.

DISCUSSING the impact of
automation and production cur-
tailments on employment in the
non-ferrous metals industry,
Stuart gave estimates of the
number of additional jobs that
would result in the industry
from establishment of the 35-
hour work week.

This was followed by a discus-
sion of Mine-Mill’s current par-
ticipation in the U. S. Bureau of

Mines survey of safety condi-

tions in non-coal mines, and
an outline of the union’s legisla-
tive aims in this field.

Stuart emphasized that the un-
ion would continue its push for
a law providing federal inspec-
tion and enforcement of safety
rules in all non-ferrous mines,
mills and smelters when the
current government survey is
concluded next year.

What’s Next in the SACB Case?

A Statement by the l nternational Officers

There has been so much twisted reporting and
misinformation about this SACB case that the of-
ficers feel it necessary to repeat again a few
simple facts to our membership.‘

First: The Subversive Activities Control Board
started this case against Mine-Mill in 1955—almost
eight years ago. In May, 1962, they handed down
a decision that Mine-Mill was a “Communist-
infiltrated organization.” ' “

Second: THE OFFICERS AND EXECUTIVE
BOARD CATEGORICALLY REJECT AND DENY
THIS CONCLUSION OF THE SACB. Last June
we initiated appeal proceedings in the U. S. Court
of Appeals to have this decision reversed.

Third: Also last June we demanded a full
hearing before the SACB—as provided by the law
—to prove that Mine-Mill is not a “Communist-
infiltrated, organization.”

Fourth: Since last June we have been attempt-
ing to get this hearing before the SACB despite
numerous attempts to deny us this opportunity
to be heard.

Fifth: This hearing is now definitely set to
proceed on December 3, 1962, in Washington.
Every officer,. Board member and staff member
of the Union will take the stand to testify in their
own behalf and in behalf of Mine-Mill. Over 100
local union leaders have already so testified
within the past two years.

Our membership and our leadership are fed

up with these continuous and irresponsible legal
attacks by government agencies against our
Union. We say that to continue this farce of re-
peating old charges and worn-out testimony of
paid informers, discredited stoolpigeons and
deserters from Mine-Mill does no credit to the
American concept of justice.

LET’S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT—Mine-
Mill is an honest and democratic union. Our
membership is proud of this union’s record and
our achievements at the bargaining table. That’s
the kind of union Mine-Mill is-—a proud and
militant trade union——and nothing more.

We arenot. “infiltrated” or “dominated” by
anyone or any brand of political philosophy. All
attempts to label us otherwise will fail now as
they have failed in the past.

In the meantime, our Union will continue the
program and the work of advancing and protect-
ing the interests, the welfare, the jobs and the
living standards of our members and their fam-
ilies. That’s the job of our Union, that’s the job

of the elected leaders-and we intend to pursue it’

with vigor.

Carteret Council Enacts Anti-Scab Law

CARTERET, N. J .—A strong
campaign by-the Carteret La-
bor Council last month brought
enactment of a new anti-strike
breaking ordinance by the Bor-
oughfathers here. The united
labor group is made up of ma-
jor locals of various interna-
tionals in the Carteret area and
is headed by Stephen Trosko,
President of Mine-Mill Local 837

at the big U. S. Metals plant.

-_‘DlSl'l_ilCT 6 BOARD MEMBER Alfred Petit-Clair, seated front center right,
, lfshnkes hands with Carteret, N. 1., Mayor Stephen Skiba, following
unanimous adoption by City Council’ of anti-strike-breaking ordinance
 Nov. 1. Council Chambers were packed ‘by urea unionists, half of whom

  

 

The anti-scab measure was
passed unanimously by the Car-
teret City Council Nov. 1 after
a public hearing. It makes an
offense punishable by $500 fine
or six months imprisonment for
any company to directly or in-
directly hire employees for the
purpose of replacing workers
out on strike.

Passage of the ordinance was

greeted by all workers in the

area as a significant step in
assuring organized labor pro-
tection of members engaged in
struggles to improve their
wages and working conditions.

ENACTMENT came as a di-
rect result. of months of work
by the Carteret Labor Council
spearheaded by Mine-Mill Local
837 President Trosko who, to-
gether with the Labor Council’s

were Mine-Mill members. Standing third from left is Mine-Mill local
837 President ‘Steve Trosko who heads Carteret labor Council which
organized the political action among affiliated locals in months-long

campaign to get anti-scab measure adopted.

essary work in developing their
local memberships’ understand-
ing of the issues involved. They
met with the various members
of the City Council to answer
questions and insure passage
of the ordinance.

As a result, the City Cham-
bers were packed with trade

unionists, at least half of them

Mine-Mill members, when the
legislation was presented for
second and final reading on
Nov. 1. Undoubtedly the demon-
stration of full labor support
was instrumental in its adop-
tion.

District 6 Board Member Al-
fred Petit-Clair has congratu-
lated the Labor Council on its
work, pointing out that this kind
of political action on the com-
munity basis is extremely im-
portant in developing grass-root
level activity. Such work, he
said, contributes to th e fight
against the vast amount of anti-
labor legislation being pushed
on the national level by big

THE MINE-MILL umou

Vice President:

A Victory for Rank
And File Democracy

NOFFICIAL results of the International referendum
have been reported by about 90 percent of our local
unions in the United States. The final tabulation and

official certification of the results will be made by the .

Canvassing Committee elected at the convention.

This official canvass will be completed
early in December and reported in the next
issue of the Mine-Mill Union. However, this
year’s referendum was so decisive that the
final and official count should not be in doubt.

The unofficial count as reported from
around the union now shows that all ‘ five
propositions received better than 2 to 1 sup-
port from the membership. More than two-
thirds of the local unions carried the refer-
endum. In approximately one-third of the local
unions where the referendum proposals were
_ defeated, the results in these locals were very
Skinner C1053-

Last year the proposal to increase per capita tax was defeated
by a narrow margin in the national referendum. This year it
carried by a very substantial margin. Why?

***A'

BELIEVE it’s bgcause many, many more local officers and
stewards gave this year’s referendum their active and ag-
gressive support. Also, the referendum this year was not side-
tracked or complicated by contests for district or national offices.

The result was overwhelming support behind the International
Union—at the last convention, in area conferences and in local
unions by hundreds of officers and stewards. Without this kind of
active support in the local union and on the job you can’t win.

I know I speak for the entire International leadership and the
International staff when I express our thanks and congratulations
to all of you for a job well done.

it * *

OME International unions have membership referendums for

election of national officers, but not many. Some International
unions have membership votes for dues and per capita, but not
many. In very few International unions, if any, does the member-
ship vote on salaries and expenses paid to elected officers or
staff representatives. Almost all unions determine these financial
matters at Board meetings or conventions.

In our union the membership is the boss—on policy, on the
constitution, on dues, on per capita and even on the question of
determining when the people who work for the union can get a
wage increase. I

I must admit that sometimes this is very difficult-—and quite
often the decisions of conventionsare over-ruled by a rank and
file referendum. But the facts are that in Mine-Mill-we are
required by the constitution to convince a majority of our members
to support a policy or program before it can be applied. It’s some-
times difficult, but it’s the best guarantee of trade union democracy
in the whole labor movement

‘k 1!: * .
N ALMOST every union in the country, including Mine-Mill,
things are much tougher than they have been for the past 20
years. A majorproblem is rapidly shrinking membership in many
industrial unions.

Automation, increased work loads, less men doing the same
job, contracting out of work and dozens of other gimmicks to
squeeze more work out of less men are practices of almost every
corporation in the country. PERMANENT ‘unemployment is fast
becoming the No. 1-problem in thevnited States and Canada. ’

Scores of anti-union bins are awaiting action in—Congress and
State Legislatures designed to undermine and harass trade unions.

‘Ir * .* ‘

HILE this insidious and planned erosion of the trade union

movement goes on, many ofthe leaders of labor tolerate or
encourage raiding, competition and division from within the Amer-
ican and Canadian labor movements.
. Only a‘ determined and united labor movement can begin to’
tackle these problems and stop this erosion of the strength and
rights of -organized labor. »

Mine-Mill will continue to do everything possible to contribute
to a re-united and rededicated labor movement. In the meantime,
our membership has shown its support in the referendum vote.
They have provided their International Union with the tools and
resources to protect their gains in this difficult period for all
umons.

Again, we thank everyone among the many who worked hard
to support their union in the referendum.—AL SKINNER.

IN MONTANA, the greatest
concentration of Mine-Mill local '
PAC activity was in support of
Democrat Arnold Olsen for re-
election to Congress.

- Olsen won with a decisive
margin in the‘ Mine-Mill mem-
bership areas of Silver Bow and
Deer Lodge counties which his
lavishly "financed Republican Wop-
ponent W a y n e Montgomery
could not overcome elsewhere
in the 17-county- district. Silver
Bow County alone, home of
Butte Miners Local 1 and Mel-
rose Local 904, gave Olsen a
majority of around 7,000 votes.
His district-wide plurality was
somewhat over 7,500.

Contributing substantially to
0lsen’s victory was the work
Mine-Mill and labor generally
put out in these areas. Olsen-
campaign material was mailed
from Butte to all Local 1 mem-
bers as well as to members in

DENVER—Officers and members of Mine - Mill

last month of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Mine-Mill President John Clark said: “A great lady
has passed away. The widow of one of our greatest

Presidents, she was a be-
loved international figure
in her own right, truly a first
lady of the world.”

Notables paid her tribute, but
common people of all nations
who will long remember her
selﬂess work for mankind num-
ber in the millions. Her sense
of humanity had no bounds.

She was named a U. S. dele-

1945 and a year later was
elected chairman of its Com-
mission on Human Rights of the

Vice-President

Negro Vote Is Felt  
Throughout the US.

HIS November 6 general election saw a new political

trend throughout the United States. The importance
of the ballot in our democratic society and the power it
entails was shown and felt immediately as the returns
trickled in.

In Alabama, Senator Lister Hill, who had
been in Congress for more than 30 years, was
able to beat his Republican opponent _by less
than 8,000 votes. Hill’s political salvation can
only be attributed to the votes given him by
Negroes in Alabama. While feeling there was
time for a change, these voters were not will-
ing to vote for a Republican whose platform
was built on efforts to degrade the Negro by
claiming that Hill was for the national Demo-
cratic party and John F. Kennedy, and that
the Kennedy program supported by Hill was
nothing more than socialism.

The Negro, in voting for Hill, was making
an effort to support civil rights and other social legislation, includ-
ing fair housing practices.

In Alabama's Jefferson County, where the Bessemer Voters
League is active, six Negroes now hold offices on the Democratic
Executive Committee for the first time in its history.

‘A'**

EMOCRACY and the power of the ballot was felt in other
areas of the nation where Negroes were highly honored by
being elected to political office.
Some of these include: Mrs. Verda Welcome, first Negro
woman sent to Maryland’s Senate; E. W. Brooke, Republican, first
Negro Attorney-General of Massachusetts; 0. M. Smith, Michigan

 

Howard

.State Supreme Court; Carl Stokes of Cleveland, Ohio Legislature;

C. A. Lamb, State Treasurer of Connecticut; L. R. Johnson of
Atlanta, Georgia State Senator; Augustus Hawkins, U. S. Con-
gressman from California; Clarence Mitchell of Baltimore, Mary-
land House of Delegates; Mrs. Edith Sampson, first Negro woman
judge in Illinois; Mrs. C. E. White, School Board of Houston,
Texas.

In addition: three Negroes were elected to the City Council
of Nashville, Tenn.; three to the S-tate -Assembly of Calif.; and
two to the State Legislature of Pennsylvania.

**A'*

HE NEGRO is fast becoming more keenly aware of the power

of the ballot, its privileges and responsibilities. With the aid
of organized labor and other interested national groups, the South
is now in a period of political transition, and for the first time
Negroes in the South are demanding a complete house-cleaning
in political, religious and social thinking.

Negroes are demanding to be recognized as citizens of the
United States with rights secured under the Constitution. We are
keenly aware that the salvation of the South as well as the country
can only come about by full revamping of thinking to recognize
the individual based on his contribution to society.

In this vein, the Negro for the first time is ready to assume all
the rights, privileges, immunities and responsibilities of citizen-
ship. He knows that elevation and recognition comes up through
the right of the ballot. That has been shown in this last general

election.
* ‘k ‘k

CONSIDER the most significant gain in Alabama was the vote

of the citizens of Birmingham to change their form of govern-
ment. They were voting on the commission form: Mayor-Council
and Mayor-Manager. '

The vote went in favor of substituting a Mayor-Council system
for the present 3-man commission. That means the elimination of
Eugene “Bull” Connor who is in charge of police and is known
for his harsh treatment of Negroes and their white friends.

I think this vote represents the beginning of a major change
in Birmingham.-—ASBURY HOWARD. /

SUDBURY, Ont.—In the latest test of strength between Mine-Mill and Steel in
Sudbury, the Mine-Mill slate of candidates topped the polls in the Local 598 union
elections to win every office on the local executive board. I -- I

The new Local 598 executive board, headed by President Tom Taylor, ran up a.‘
1,000 vote majority over the Steel-supported slate of former local President Don Gillis ~

when more than 12,000
members cast their ballots
on October 24. The election was
conducted by officials of the
Ontario Department of Labor.

Substantial majorities were
registered at both the Interna-
tional Nickel Company and Fal-
conbridge Mines polls. At Fal-
conbridge, where Steel’s certifi-
cation application had been dis-
missed when experts revealed
they had submitted forged mem-
bership, cards, the vote went 2

-to 1 for Mine-Mill.

THE results of this election
for Local 598 officers were
greeted by the whole Canadian
membership as a tremendous
victory for Mine-Mill and a clear
rejection of the split certifica-
tion decision in favor of Steel
at INCO handed down a week
earlier by the Ontario Labor Re-
lations Board. .

As a result of the clear and
unequivocal local election re-
turns, the court order under
which Local 598 had been op-
erating since last July was dis-
solved by the Ontario Supreme
Court. At the same time an ap-
plication for an injunction to
hogtie the new executive board,
made by Steel supporters, was
dismissed. -

THIS return of the local’s af-
fairs to the membership places
it in a position to really ﬁght
the raiders for the first time.
As local President Taylor said:

“Now that the members have
re-established control over their
own assets and funds we are in
a position to deal with raiders
properly for the first time. Cer-
tainly, last February’s certifica-
tion vote at INCO which, even
so, is under a cloud, cannot be
considered a true expression of
INCO workers when Mine-Mill
members were prevented from
using their own halls and money
while under attack.” ~
V He added: “There are suf-
ficient grounds for the Ontario
Labor Relations Board dismiss-
ing the Steel application at
INCO or, at the very least,
ordering a new vote. Only now
could such a vote be considered

Among the grounds on which
the union had asked reconsid-
eration was the fact that uncon-
tradicted evidence before the
OLRB established that there [ K _ .
were blatant violations of the
restrictions on propaganda s by .
Steel throughout’ the required, f
“silent period” prior to the vote. ’

It was emphasized that the.
3-man Board made its split cer- 
tification decision by ignoring’;
those violations and without
“having regard to its previous . ’
decisions” in similar cases _
where the silent period was vio-
lated. , _.-5" . j;

Output Up,

In Copper

Copper industry statistics re-
leased in mid-November by the
Copper Institute raised eyebrows
in‘ copper industry circles.

Despite. widely publicized pro-.
duction A cutbacks announced by
major U.S. producers last sum-
mer, U.S. mine production of
copper rose 13,515 tons from
September to October, to the
highest figure since last May.
Reports earlier in November in-

, dicated. that Chilean production

for 1962 would be 6% percent
higher than last year’s record,
“despite announced production
cutbacks” and that 1962 Rho-
desian production is likely to

-be nearly 10 percent greater

than last year’s.
Since-the first U.S. cuts were

-announcedlast July, mine pro-

duction of copper fell by no
more than the normal summer
decline, and for the four months,
July-October, was actually
ahead of the corresponding
‘months of 1961 when the indus-

5 try admittedly was going full

blast.

American Metal Market, daily
newspaper of the metal trades,
“industry factors” were

WHO is kidding who? It’s a .

fact that over 1,000 Kennecott

The fact is that the companies

Anaconda Struck in Chile

4,500 workers at Andes Copper Company El Salvador mine and

Potrerillos smelter struck November 1. Andes Copper is one of
Anaconda Company’s subsidiaries in Chile. Prior to the strike,
The Copper Workers Confederation, representing the workers, had
demanded a 25 percent increase in miners’ pay and 30 percent

for white collar workers, also
members of the union. Anaconda
offered 12 percent and as the
strike deadline approached
upped it to 15 percent, which
was rejected by the union.
Bargaining has been compli-
cated by the recent and rapid

H fall in value of Chile’s currency,

the escudo. Long pegged by the
government at about U.S. 95c,
the escudo was unpegged last

October and within a few days,

had fallen to about 72c. By No-
vember 5 it had dropped to 49c,
was quoted November 14 at
37%c, and the end is not yet in
sight. In a month, the copper
Workers’ pay in dollars has been
cut by more than 60 percent.

Anaconda sells its copper for
dollars and other “hard” cur-
rencies and has thus suffered no
such loss. Instead, it stands to
make extra profits from the cut
in wages.

1! its All

BOTH sides remained dead-
locked at Mine-Mill Union press
time. Probably bo-th were wait-
ing to get a better idea as to
how far the escudo would fall,
and to see what the government
would do about it. A bill in the
Chilean Congress, if passed,
would raise all’ wages by 15
percent.

Meanwhile prices are rising.
Government imposed price ceil-
ings on consumer items have
been upped from 7 to 40 per-
cent. A few went up 60 percent
and wine was hiked 100 percent.
Among essentials affected were
flour, butter, sugar, salt and
condensed milk.

The Copper Workers Confed-
eration last year adopted a
solidarity policy pledging sym-
pathy walkouts by workers at
other Anaconda and Kennecott
properties in Chile if called by
the union president. This policy
was reaffirmed this year, but
the union thus far has held this
Weapon in reserve, pending
further clarification of the sud-
den nationwide economic crisis.

UNITED NATIONS LEAD-ZINC STUDY GROUP~ announced
it would go ahead on outlining principles for an inter-governmental
lead-zinc commodity agreement. The announcement came late in
October at the end of the latest meeting of the group in Geneva,
Switzerland. U. S. government representatives participated in the
sessions. Mine-Mill backs adoption of such an agreement and will
push U. S. Government for further action.

The report of the sudy group was not available at Mine-Mill
Union press time, but newspaper reports indicated work would go
ahead because of long-term problems facing the lead and zinc in-

dustries.

ST. JOSEPH LEAD CO. raised its price for lead from 9%
cents to 10 cents per pound last month. Other producers quickly fol-
lowed suit, and discounting of posted lead prices, prevalent for
months, was also discontinued.

St. Joe mines in Missouri, producing about 40 percent of.U. S.
mine output of lead, have been struck by Steelworkers since July
27. Market observers credited the strike, more than any basic im-
provement in demand for lead, for the price hike.

Surveys Available for

Mill, Smelter Locals

The U. S. Bureau of Mines was established in 1910
and from its inception has emphasized health and safety .
in mines and processing plants as one of its principal
activities. The Bureau studies mine and mineral process-
ing plant hazards and ways to overcome them. It conducts

courses in accident preven-
tion, first aid and mine
rescue and promotes better
health and working conditions
and increased safety in all
mines and plants. It collects and
publishes voluminous statistics
on work injuries in mines, mills,
smelters and refineries.
Important milestones in the
history of the Bureau’s health
and safety activities were: 1)
passage of the Federal Coal
Mine Inspection Act of 1941; 2)
amendments in 1952 giving
power to the Bureau to enforce
safety rules and practices in
coal mines; and 3) the Metal
and Non-Metallic Mines Study
Act of 1961 (Public Law 87-300).

AN important aspect of the
Bureau’s health and safety pro-
gram has been overshadowed by
the great current interest in the
mine safety inspections being
carried out. under Public Law
87-300. This is its continuing
work on health and safety in
non-ferrous mills, concentrators,
_sme1ters and refineries.

The Bureau is prepared to
conduct health and safety sur-
veys at such plants, within the
limits imposed by available time
and funds. Under existing law,
however, such surveys can only
be made with the consent of
management. The Bureau also
offers, free of charge, courses
in safety for mills, smelters and
refineries, and will consult, upon
request, with any local union
safety committee with regard to
specific safety problems. It has
published excellent safety hand-
books on accident preventionin

lowing the fatal accident at the
plant August 1 involving Brother
Arthur Clarence Spencer.

As a result of the inspection,
Safety Engineer Kyle J. Lutz
served an accident prevention
report on plant manager Joseph
T. Roy, reading in part as fol-
lows: “Requirements for the
elimination of unsafe conditions
are listed below. These unsafe
conditions are in violation of
lawful orders enforced by the
Division of Industrial Safety.”

Seven unsafe conditions re-
quiring correction were listed.
These involved operation of four
or more cranes, provision of
“men at work” and “stop”
signs when men are working in
or on cars, provision of an ac-
cess platform for men working
upon reverberatory mixers, and
installation of ramps or walk-
ways to clear lever controls on

HOWARD BIRD, Denver based U. S. Bureau of Mines Health and Safety‘SupeI.';.¥>..;,\
3 visor for 11 Western states plus Alaska and Hawaii, has commented to Mine-I

Mill Union on the discussion on the noise problem
valuable comments are quoted in full: V , .,
“A number of machinery manufacturers are doing commendable work in suppressgy. “ 

ing noise at its source and,
as mentioned, many mining
companies have established or
are establishing effective pro-
grams. This is a sound ap-
proach and it is hoped interest
will continue to the end that ex-

‘cessive noise will be adequately

controlled.

“A word of caution here may
be in order. Keen hearing is es-
sential in certain jobs in and
around mines and in those jobs
use of ear plugs or hearing pro-

tectors that hamper the work-

Ventilation Needs at
Mountain Con Mine

 

BUTTE, Mont.—The U. S. Bureau of Mines health and survey

-inspection report on the Anaconda company’s Mountain Con mine

at Butte lists temperature, relative humidity and air velocity read-
ings taken at 65 locations underground. (Also see summary of full

report in Safety column at right.)

The report recommends maintenance of a minimum air
velocity of 100 feet per minute at locations where relative humidity
is 85 per cent or more and dry bulb temperatures are 75 to 85
degrees Fahrenheit. With the same humidity and temperatures
above 85 degrees, air velocity of 400 feet per minute is recom-
mended. Judged by this standard, 15 out of 65 locations at the
Mountain Con, or about 23 per cent of those surveyed, were inade-

quately ventilated.

Readings at these 15 locations, and recommended air velocity,’

in feet per minute, as taken from the report, are given below:

NACONDA’S Mountain Con
Mine at Butte was the sub-
ject of a recent health and safe-
ty survey report issued by the
U.S. Bureau of Mines, under
‘authority of the Mine Safety
Act passed last year. It took the
Bureau of Mines engineer two
weeks to make his very

thorough survey. _

The report runs to 23 type-
written pages, most single-
spaced. An interesting feature
of the report is a table giving
temperature, humidity and air
velocity readings at 65 locations
underground. V

(See story at left for listing of
15 locations where increased
ventilation was recommended.)

The report lists 15 safety im-
provements made by the com-
pany during the survey. Among
these were:

“The first-aid box in the ma-
chine shop was filled with first-
aid supplies; the storage room
of the electrical shop was
cleaned and combustible ma-
terial removed; the switch for
the fire-alarm s y s t e m was
‘locked in the “on” position;
the explosives cartridges which
were found in 4286 drift west,
4676 drift west, 4413 lateral and
4400 haulage level were returned
to the storage magazines.

“Headlight bulbs were re-

placed on locomotives on the-

3900, 4600 and 4500 levels; the
block signals on the 4400 level
at B4470 crosscut were re-
paired; the guard screen was
installed on the rectifier grid
situated near the shaft station
on the 4400 level.’’

A total of 62 safety recom-
mendations was included at the
end of the report. Some of these
were:

“The cans of grease and oil
in the 5100‘ station hoistroom
should be moved away from the
hoist and stored in a rock sec-
tion of the shaft station; the old
explosives at the bottom of 4527
raise should be removed from
the mine and destroyed.

“The 440-volt blasting cable
on the 4600 level should be
mounted on insulators and not
touch or overlap other power
cables and pipes; bridle chains
or safety ropes should be in-
stalled on the skips and man
cages.

“Loose or broken ladder rungs
should be replaced; tail lights
should be installed on ore
trains; haulage roads should be
kept free of spillage and debris;
loose rock should be barred

. down or supported properly.-

ENNECOTT’S Liberty Pita", l
at Ruth, Nevada was su_r:_— I
veyed initially last June by the I
U.S. Bureau of Mines under the?‘ 71
current survey‘ program. The 4 —
survey was reported in this co1- 
umn last month. A follow-up f
survey was made just three--r
months later, and the unsafe, S
conditions uncovered the second
time argue strongly for’legis1a_-'
tion giving permanent responsi-L.—
bility for periodic inspections,-‘_
$0 the Bureau. - q »_ 
The following excerpts are;
quoted from the main body “of
the report: ‘  
“The wire -rope on No.‘ 663.-
cherry picker was jagged‘ and" 
several rope strands were brok-.. 
en near the hood end. . . . Boom-
truck No. 55 had a jaggedrope,
and a thimble was not provided
for hook attachment. Wire ropes,
were damaged on the overhead
cranes in the Veteran tire and‘ *
welding shops, and rope clips
were installed improperly ‘ on
several slings stored in the en-.""“~i
gine house. Grinding-wheel-~ tool
rests in the the main shop were
positioned incorrectly and cans
of paint were stacked haphaa-
ardly on the floor of the paint
shop.   .
“Men, trucks, and other»
equipment were working near 
an area where several holes. _,
about 3 feet deep had; been».
charged with dynamite primed
with detonating fuse. H o.1eI_s,,
drilled dry, were loaded upon-
completion. Blasting.’ ‘ reportedly:
would be done at -3l:0,0,fp.m., pal-1
though the holes were ,loa’de_‘cl.
about 11:00 a.m. - '7 
“Electrical maintenance .0
the shovel generally was*poor_,,
light bulbs were missing frorn,
sockets, wires were in ‘contact—’‘
with moving belts, and several:
junction-box covers were miss-.
ing. The shield protecting the,

tor to excessive accumulation
of heavy oil and grease.” ,, 
The report concluded with: af;
listing of 29- recommendations;
for correction of the unsafe coir‘-
ditions noted above, and other
