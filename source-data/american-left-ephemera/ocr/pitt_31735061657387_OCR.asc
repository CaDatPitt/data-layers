“I want to object, your Honor.”

But ]udge Medina, without reply or recognition, declared a recess
and strode out of the courtroom, majestically oblivious.

“Mr. Gladstein: And I ask your Honor to instruct the jury
to disregard those remarks for this reason-

The Court: I don’t want to hear any reason.

Mr. Gladstein: But I want-

The Court: Mr. Gladstein-

Mr. Gladstein: I am trying to assign some remarks-

The Court: —this is one time when you will not give any

_ reasons. So you will-—
Mr. Gladstein: May I not assign-
The Court: You will please desist.” (p. 3753)

“Mr. Gordon: Then is there anything wrong with my asking
the next question, if I may.

Mr. Sacher: Yes; I should like an opportimity to answer Mr.
jGordon’s question, if I may.

are going to sit right down.” (p. 11,101)

“Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: Sustained. I think I am going to from now begin
curtailing somewhat the expansiveness of the testimony or I am
afraid we shall never be through with this trial.

Mr. Isserman: Well, if the Court please, I wish to call to the
Court’s attention, if I may—

The Court: If there is some testimony as part of the Govem-
ment’s case which has particular bearing on this issue I will be
glad to read it.

’ Mr. Gladstein: Are we to be limited-

The Court: I don’t want any argument, Mr. Gladstein.

Mr. Gladstein: May I not even ask a question?

The Court: No.” (p. 10,932)

0 O O I

During the cross-examination of a defense witness, Mr. Glad-
stein attempted to state the grounds of objection, but ]udge Medina
interrupted him and did not let him ﬁnish the statement, saying
in the middle of Mr. Gladstein’s sentence:

“The Court: Will you sit down or must I call an oﬁcer to
8

 

put you down? I will have no more interruptions on cross-
examination. Your ﬁeld day is over.

Mr. Gladstein: I assign your Honor’s remarks-

The Court: Mr. Marshal, will you please-all right, I see
you sat down by yourself.” (p. 11,072)

“The Court: . . . you know what I said the other day, Mr.
Isserman: the force and violence by other people is out. The
charge here has to do with something different and I am not
going to allow any more on that.

Mr. Isserman: May I be heard on this?

The Court: No.

Mr. Gladstein: Your Honor-

The Court: No, I don’t want to hear argument on it.

Mr. Gladstein: Your Honor, may I say something?

The Court: No. If you want to argue about this question of
force and violence by other people than the defendants I don’t
want to hear any argument about that at all.

Mr. Gladstein: But can’t I speak?

The Court: You see the first time I heard that come up it
fooled me. I thought when the question had to do with force
and violence it was going to have to do with the defendants,
but I caught on to that after a while. I was really stupid. I
should have caught on sooner, but I didn’t. Now, all that busi-
ness is out.

Mr. Gladstein: But the question and the issue still remain
of what the viewpoint and attitude of the defendants have been
and their advocacy regarding the overthrow of the Government
by force and violence. »

The Court: You still have something to say even though
I tell you not to, and it seems you are going to keep it up.”
(p. 12,639-12,640)

CHAPTER II

GROUNDS FOR THE EXCLUSION OF DEFENSE
QUESTIONS WITHHELD BY JUDGE MEDINA

“In disposing of controverted cases, a judge should indicate the
reasons for his action in an opinion showing that he has not disre-
garded yor overlooked serious arguments of counsel. He thus shows his
full understanding of «the case, avoids the suspicion of arbitrary
conclusions, promotes conﬁdence in his intellectual integrity and may
contribute useful recedent to the growth of the law.” (Canon 19,
Canons of Iudicits Ethics.) ,5,

9

 

It is bad enough for a conscientious trial lawyer to be prevented
from stating grounds of his objection and from urging upon the
court the reasons why he considers his objections to be valid. Such
a practice implies that the judge is not open to persuasion and,
therefore, any argument is sheer waste of time.

But even worse is the counterpart of the rule, which results in
the prosecution’s objections being repeatedly sustained and de-
fense questions excluded without ground of objection or the
ground of exclusion being stated. The defense is required to guess,
when a question is excluded, whether the ruling is that the ques-
tion is irrelevant or incompetent or immaterial, or improper in form
or repetitious, or lacking in foundation; or whether the witness is
incompetent .or not qualiﬁed, etc., etc. ]udge Medina ﬂatly refuses
to require the prosecution to state the ground of its objections
when requested to do so, and declines to state the reason for his
ruling.

“Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: Sustained.

Mr. Gladstein: May I know the grounds of it? I think I am
entitled to ask the witness whether he can identify any article at
any time, whether he says that any such article-

The Court: I know you would like to argue about it, but
I do not intend to be catechized.

Mr. Gladstein: I mean, if it is the form of the question, I am
perfectly willing to rephrase it, your Honor.

The Court: Well, you may suit yourself.” (pp. 2152-2153)

C I I O 0

“Mr. Gordon: I object to it.

The Court: Sustained.

Mr. Crockett: May I inquire the reason for the Court’s ruling?

The Court: I don’t think there is any occasion for me to get
into an argument about it.

C Mr. Crockett: I just wanted to know, your Honor, so that if
there has been any deﬁciency in the laying of the foundation
that may have occurred, I can at least attempt to cure it while
the witness is on the stand.

The Court: Yes, I understand. (pp. 3023-3024)

“Mr. Wallace: Objection.

The Court: Sustained.

Mr. Sacher: I don’t know what the basis of the objection is.
Would your Honor help me on that? If it is a question of form,
I will be glad to reframe it.

The Court: No.” (p. 5069)

During the direct examination of the defendant Gates, after
a series of objections had been sustained without the grounds being
stated, Mr. Cladstein "asked to have the grounds of the objection
set forth and the Court merely ordered him to cease his argument
and directed him to sit down (pp. 6460-6462). _

“Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: Sustained.

Mr. Sacher: Well, is it on the ‘theory that everybody knows.
who ‘Municheers’ are your Honor?

The Court: Mr. Sacher, I don’t desire argument. If your
question is right, then you are right and I am wrong. Now,
I have to decide here, and I have sustained the objection. I
don’t want argument over every question the way you seem
disposed to do.

Mr. Gladstein: Your Honor, may I ask the Court to inquire
of Mr. McGohey what legal grounds, if any, he urges in sup-
port of his objection to this question?

The Court: You have in effect asked me to do that and I re-
fuse to do so.

Mr. Gladstein: Your Honor refuses?

The Court: I do.” (p. 6531)

# Q 13 9 §

“Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: Sustained.

Mr. Gladstein: May I know why, your Honor?

The Court: I don’t want to hear any argument at this time,
Mr. Gladstein.

Mr. Gladstetn: No; I asked a question. May I know why?

The Court: What is the question?

Mr. Gladstein: May I know why your Honor is sustaining
that objection?

The Court: No, I think I have sufﬁciently explained my-
self.” (p. 10,415) .

ﬁr § 9 G #

During the cross-examination of Mr. Green on July 5, Iudge
Medina overruled an objection of Mr. Sacher, and the following
occurred:

“Mr. Sacher: I would really like to know on what theory
now, your Honor, any of this is being admitted.
11

The Court: If you cogitate enough some day you will
realize.” (p. 9011)

CHAPTER III

DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT OF DEFENSE COUNSEL
AS COMPARED WITH THE PROSECUTION

Of course, a lawyer has no special right to conduct legal argu-
ments before a jury, especially as such arguments often include
statements of fact and references to the evidence. But what con-
clusion can a juror draw, when he is permitted to listen to gov-
ernment argument but is dismissed when the defendants’ counsel
wishes to be heard in reply?

For example, during the cross-examination of prosecution wit-
ness Budenz, Mr. Isserman said that he wished to state the grounds
of an objection, whereupon ]udge Medina said:

“All right, the jury may be excluded. You may retire.” (p. 2337)

C O I O O
The next day, during the continued cross-examination of
Budenz, Mr. Sacher asked to be heard on an offer of documentary
evidence. ]udge Medina sustained the prosecution's objection,

and then:

“Mr. Sacher: Won’t you allow me to say why? It is contra-
dictory.
The Court: The jury may be excused.” (p. 2520)
‘ O O U I 0

During the direct examination of defendant Green, when Mr.
Isserman asked to state the grounds for an offer, the jury was
promptly excluded. (p. 7825)

During the direct examination of defendant Davis, the follow-
ing occurred: '

“Mr. McGohey: This is objected to, your Honor.

The Court: Objection sustained. V

Mr. Sacher: I would like to be heard, if I may, your Honor,
on this question. I would like to point out that this resolution-

The Court: Now just a second. I don’t desire to hear you,

Mr. Sacher, on the subject. I say_I don’t desire to hear you on
the subject. '

(Mr. Dennis rises)
The Court: The jury is excused.
‘ 12

 

(The jury left the courtroom at 3:30 p.m.)
The Court: Yes, Mr. Dennis?” (p. 9547)

O I I I I

During the direct examination of defense witness Miss Hartman,
the following occurred:

(Mr. Sacher stands up)

“The Court: I see you desire to be heard.

Mr. Sacher: Very brieﬂy.

The Court: The jury is excused.

Mr. Sacher: I haven't-

The Court: You just wait. You sit down for a minute. The
jury is excused.” (p. 9865)

0 e 0 ya 0

During the cross-examination of defense witness Krchmarek,
Mr. Sacher asked to be heard in opposition to an objection, and
the Court refused; whereupon, the following occurred:

“Defendant Dennis: May I be heard on this?
The Court: The jury may be excused.” (p. 10,775)

The next day, during the continued cross-examination of Krch-
marek: I

“Mr. Isserman: I would like to note something for the record
and call the Court's attention to something, if I may.

The Court: Then I will dismiss the jury. The jury is ex-
cused.” (p. 10,839)

The foregoing is to be contrasted with the quite different prac-
tice of permitting Mr. McGohey repeatedly to argue in the presence
of the jury.

But the error is compounded, when ]udge Medina first permits
Mr. McGohey to argue in the presence of the jury and then dis-
misses the jury when defense counsel is about to reply.

“Mr. M cGohey: Objection, your Honor.

The Court: Sustained.

Mr. McGohey: Your Honor, I feel impelled to point out to
your Honor that the testimony of the witness Budenz was that
the Starobin letter said that ‘Comrade Manuilsky was ‘indignant
at the American Party for not having criticized American of-
ﬁcials more severely, and particularly the Secretary of State,
and that French comrades had been given the commission to
instruct the American comrades as to how to act in these mat-
ters.’ So that the testimony in no wise contradicts.

c 13

 

The Court: I understand that.

Mr. Isserman: If the Court please, I wish the record to note
that ‘Mr. McGohey is allowed to argue the reasons for his ob-
jection and I am not allowed to state my grounds for the ad-
mission of the very article to which he objects.

Mr. Gladstein: Moreover, how can the jury determine-

The Court: The jury may retire.

Mr. Gladstein: But Mr. McGohey has just made a statement.

The Court: That’s all right. I suppose we are going to have
a little discussion and I think perhaps it is just as well to do it
in the absence of the jury.

(The jury leaves the court room)

The Court: Yes, Mr. Cladstein?” (p. 7640)

0 Q # C’ 0

“Mr. McGohey: If the Court please, I object and I desire to
be heard.

The Court: I will hear you.

Mr. McGohey: Your Honor, we have just had a witness who
testiﬁed about this very school. The witness said not that she
was unable to recall who the directors and teachers were, ex-
cept the one that she named or the two that she named, but she
said that she declined to name the ofﬁcials of the school or to
name the directors of the school. Now it is impossible, your
Honor, to cross-examine with respect to the setting up of that
school and the naturevof its management and so on if the cross-
examiner is unable to ascertain who the persons were that ran
the school, and I object to any statements made by this witness,
and I will do the same with any other witness with respect to
that school unless we are going to have something testiﬁed to
about the management of the school.

Mr. Crockett: May I be heard, your Honor?

The Court: In other words, you say, Mr. McGohey, that if
the witnesses called by the defense state what they just desire
to state and close the door to anything else by declining to
answer, that that should be ascertained in advance of their giv-
ing testimony on a particular point so that they may not enjoy
the advantage of giving partial testimony? Is that in eiiect what
you are saying?

Mr. McGohey: That is exactly what I am saying, your
Honor, and I am making that objection now for the first time
because I think that there is established clearly and beyond any
question in this record at this point that the strategy and the
tactics of the defense in this case is to do precisely that, to get

i 14

 

 

in partial testimony as to which _ witnesses cannot adequately
and intelligently be cross-examined. We might, just as well be
getting afﬁdavits.

Mr. Crockett: May I be heard on-

The Court: I will dismiss the jury.

Mr. Crockett: Well, I just want to correct the statement that
the prosecutor made.

The Court: No. What you want to say will be said later. The
jury will be excused from the court room, and the witness will
be taken to the witness room, and then we will have a discus-
sion.” (pp. 11,387-11,388)

Counsel for the defense are thus portrayed to the jury as per-
sons whose arguments, whose statements of fact or law, are un-
worthy of belief, indeed, not even ﬁt to be heard by the jury.
Counsel for the prosecution, however, not restricted in their argu-
ments and statements before the jury, are clothed with an appear-
ance of trustworthiness denied to the defense. This consideration
is entirely apart from the impression made upon the jury by the
actual statements made in their presence by the prosecution, which
the defense charges to be inaccurate but has no opportunity to
refute in the presence of the jury.

CHAPTER IV
THREATS AGAINST DEFENSE COUNSEL

“The judge charged defendant's counsel with constant breaches
of the rule and declared that he would impose a ﬁne upon them if
the practice continued. The statement we think was improper and
highly prejudicial. Even if it be conceded that the offered evidence
was inadmissible, counsel was nevertheless entitled to offer it in
good faith, free from threat of punishment by the court. Actions
taken by counsel during the course of trial under a mistaken view
of the law do not constitute contempt of court.” (Sprinkle v. Davis,
111 Fed. 2d, 925.)

Judge Medina has punctuated his comments and rulings with
threats against the careers of the defendants’ lawyers. He has made
it amply clear that defendants in unpopular causes shall not be
entitled to counsel unless their attorneys are ready to jeopardize
their careers as the price for performing their professional duty.

When Mr. Crockett charged the Court with prejudicial con-
duct, Judge Medina said:

“Now, Mr. Crockett, you seem an the brink of making
15 -

 

trouble for yourself. Not now, but later.” (pp. 6054-6055)

I O O 0 0

After ]udge Medina had ordered several of the defendants
remanded, Mr. McCabe arose to protest the remanding of Mr. Win-
ston. Upon the conclusion of his argument, the judge said:

‘Well, you have been impudent enough to me on numerous
occasions, and were it not for the fact that I have determined
that this trial shall not be disrupted by such things I should
have taken action against you and against each of your col-

: leagues long before this, but I shall not do it. I shall leave that
to the proper authorities to take care of in due course, and
there it shall rest, but you need be under no misapprehension;
I have been quite fully cognizant of your contemptuous con-
duct and your impudence.” (p. 6980)

O O O O 0
During the direct examination of prosecution witness Stewart,
Mr. Gladstein made an objection, stating that his ground was imma-

teriality and uttered one sentence in support of his objection,
Iudge Medina said:

‘ “Are you making these arguments just to force me to use '

some measure to stop you?” (p. 3309)
O O O O 0
Once, in the absence of the jury, a discussion took place as to

the admissibility of certain documentary evidence, and Judge
Medina toward the end of the discussion said to Mr. Sacher:

“There is no way to get you to stop without using a pick-
axe.” (p. 4847) '
C I O O 0
During the cross-examination of the defendant Gates, the fol-
lowing occurred: '

“Mr. Sacher: I once again represent to the Court that I had

not- «-

The Court: Mr. Sacher, your representations are not im-
pressive.

Mr. Sacher: Well, I respectfully object to that kind of state-
ment.

Mr. Crockett: I want to note an objection to that insulting
remark. ' . '

The Court: To what?
Mr. Crockett: To the insulting remark directed to Mr. Sacher.
I ask that the Court direct the jury to disregard it.
16

 

 

The Court: Well, that is just another mark up against you.

Mr. Crockett: I object to that threat coming from the Court.

The Court: You know, when you use the expression ‘insult-
ing’ to the Court, it doesn’t require a great understanding of
the obligations of the bar to realize that that is grossly im-
proper. . A

Mr. Crockett: I think the record indicates-

The Court: If you do not realize it already perhaps there
will come a time when you will. (pp. 7190-7191)

I I O O 6

The Court cautioned defendant Green on direct examination
to testify brieﬂy, and Mr. Isserman objected that the Court’s re-
mark put undue pressure on counsel in conducting the examination.

to which Judge Medina replied:

‘Well, I will put a lot more pressure than I am doing now
before I get through, Mr. Isserman.” (p. 8837)

During the direct examination of defendant Gates, Mr. Sacher,
upon the exclusion of an important question, made a two-sentence
argument in support of the question propounded, and ]udge
Medina said:

“Now you realize that your action now is deliberately con-
temptuous.” (p. 6532)

From time to time, quite frequently in the course of the trial,
Iudge Medina has made ﬁndings that various defense counsel are
guilty of contempt. It is quite obvious that such ﬁndings are in-
tended to be understood by counsel as a legal basis for the institu-
tion of contempt proceedings in which penalties will be inflicted
upon them. There follows one of the numerous examples of such
ﬁndings:

“Mr. Isserman: I object to that as argumentative. It is not
based on the facts in evidence as testiﬁed by this witness.

The Court: Mr. Isserman, do you remember my admoni-
tion, that when counsel objects, counsel is merely to state ‘I
object’? You have violated it several times this morning. Did
you forget?

Mr. Isserman: I am reminded of it now. It is a habit that
goes back over 25 years. It is hard to give up the habit, which
your Honor has undoubtedly engaged in yourself.

The Court: Every time you do that your action is con-

temptuous and direct, I think, willful and deliberate disobe-
dience of my command.

Mr. Isserman: I must object to your Honor’s characteriza-
tion of my conduct.

The Court: I have heard counsel for the defense here again
and again give various excuses, say they have forgotten or it
was inadvertent, and I have warned them again and again.
I now say that such conduct must be and I ﬁnd it to be wilfluly
and deliberately done and contemptuous.” (p. 11,031)

CHAPTER V

PARTISANSHIP IN FAVOR OF PROSECUTORS
AGAINST DEFENSE COUNSEL

“A judge should be temperate, attentive, patient, impartial, . . .”
(Canon 5, Canons of Judicial Ethics.)

The judge manifests general approval of the conduct of the
prosecution attorneys, coupled with condemnation of defense attor-
neys, especially in the relations of the respective counsel to one
another.

For example, during the cross-examination of defendent Gil-
bert Green, the Court overruled a defense objection. Mr. McCohey
without asking leave of the Court made an argument in support of
his position, although no motion or objection was pending and
there was no statement by defense counsel requiring reply.’ There-
upon defense counsel asked to have his remarks stricken out as
being in the nature of a summation. Judge Medina replied:

“It was all started by Mr. Isserman disobeying the Court’s
direction that there be no argument on objections without ask-
ing leave. Every time it is started, we go on and everybody
has to have his say. I don’t know where that came from but,
I say, we have it again and again.” (p. 9000)

It is to be noted that the offense, if any, was committed by United
States Attorney, Mr. McGohey; but it was Mr. Isserman, who had
not even participated in the violation of the rule against argument
without permission, to whom the Court’s scolding was addressed.

On another occasion, Mr. McGohey, after the Court had ruled.

in his favor and during the direct examination of defendant Ben-
jamin Davis, asked leave to “make a brief statement about this
matter” (p. 9389), although there was no unanswered question
then pending. Mr. Sacher objected to the interruption of his ex-
amination for such a statement and judge Medina replied:
18

 

 

_ “Well, you see, neither you nor I know what Mr. McGohey
is about to say, and he has uniformly addressed me in a respect-
ful manner here and asked my leave to make a statement, and
I see no reason why I should not permit him. Mr. McGohey,
what do you desire to state?” (p. 9390)

May not the jury be expected to draw inferences adverse to the
defendants and their counsel from the contrast between the defer-
ence accorded by the Court to prosecution counsel on the one
hand and the contempt in which he patently holds the defense
attorneys? Again and again one of the trial attorneys for the prose-
cution has either committed an act discourteous to defense coun-
sel or has been accused by the defense counsel of doing so. On
not a single such occasion did Judge Medina address a rebuke to
prosecution counsel or attempt to ascertain the facts, but he in-
variably turned the charge back upon defense counsel who made
the complaint.

“Mr. Sacher: Your Honor, this man, Mr. Gordon, just turned
around and pointed his ﬁnger at me and said, ‘Sit down.’ I want
to call that to the Court’s attention. I will not permit myself to
be terrorized by counsel for the government.

The Court: I see you are returning to your old role.” (pp.
1372-1373)

# Q # 0 6

“Mr. Gladstein: And before I do object I should like the
record to indicate that Mr. Gordon has been going through all
sorts of gyrations of one kind or another this morning and at
other times. This morning when I was addressing your Honor
he—I don’t know how to describe it-he raised his hand and
went this way (demonstrating) as though he was attending a
baseball game and didn’t like what the umpire said.

Now as I was addressing your Honor he turns around and
makes faces and grimaces. It is not that he frightens me but it
interferes with my_following what the Court said.

The Court: If somebody ﬁnally got your goat it is a tribute
to justice.” (p. 7343)

I Q I G G

“Mr. Isserman: If the Court, please, what I was trying to do
by that, if you didn’t want the argument-

Mr. McGohey: I suggest that the way to do something else
is to put a question to the witness and get on with the trial,
andI object to the summation by Mr. Isserman.

Mr. Isserman: I haven’t been making a summation.

19

Mr. McGohey: You haven’t been doing it well, I admit.

Mr. Sacher: If the Court please, I don’t think it is proper
for Mr. McGohey to arrogate the function of the Court. I think
he is addressing counsel a little too sharply and I ask that he
be directed to observe the amenities.

The Court: Well, Mr. Sacher, that coming from you is really
surprising.” (pp. 7894-7895)

“Mr. Isserman: I like to avoid it too, your Honor.

The Court: VVhat is that?

Mr. Isserman: I like to avoid it too.

Mr. McGohey: I can give a pretty short formula how to
avoid it. Maybe if Mr. Isserman would keep quiet-

Mr. Issemwn: I am sure that is what Mr. McCohey would
like.
Mr. Gladstein: I object to that remark-

The Court: There is Mr. Gladstein now.

Mr. Gladstein: I move that the remarks of Mr. McGohey
be stricken from the record and ask your Honor to caution the
jury to disregard those remarks. I think they are highly objec-
tionable.

The Court: Well, they were not very bad, but I will strike
them out." (p. 8117)

“Mr. Gladstein (reading testimony of a previous witness):
“Q. With whom did the conversation take place? A. With Will
Broms, the section organizer, and Marty Kamen, the Section
Organizational Secretary. . . .”

Q. Now, is that man’s ﬁrst name Marty?

A. It is Morty.

Q. All right.

Mr. Gordon: That is what the witness says.

Mr. Gladstein: Pardon?

 

Mr. Gordon: The witness said Morty. That is what he testi-'

ﬁed to.
The Court: Go ahead. Now don’t start anything now as I
was right here and heard it. Don’t let us start any trouble.
Mr. Gladstein: I did not start it.
The Court: It is not important whether it is Marty or Morty.
Mr. Gladstein: It is not important.
The Court: That is what I said. Go ahead.

The Court: No, it may not.

Mr. Gordon: Mr. Isserman, if you can ﬁnd a page number-

Mr. Isserman: I don’t care to see it, Mr. Gordon.

The Court: Now, Mr. Gordon, just let me make a suggestion.

Mr. Gordon: All right.

The Court: You know, sometimes these objections distort the
proceedings a little bit, and I think it is better if we just do not
pay any attention to them and do not let anything arise to cause
irritation because one thing leads to another, and you know
sometimes those things are sort of-well, you better just leave
them alone.” (p. 1604)

“Mr. M cGohey: Will you excuse me just a minute, please?
If the Court please, I should like to inquire of Mr. Crockett
where in the record it appears that the witness Cook testified
that the veterans were introduced by Carl Winter?

The Court: Well, I am sure he will be glad to accommodate
you.

Mr. McGohey: The reason I ask the question-

The Court: I thought he referred to a page.

Mr. McGohey: He did, your Honor, and the reason that I
ask leave to ask the question is that on page 3352 where the
witness testified about this, he certainly did not testify that they
were introduced by Carl Winter. He speciﬁcally says that the
introduction of the veterans took place following the speech
which was given by Carl Winter.

The Court: How about that, Mr. Crockett?

Mr. Crockett: Is Mr. McGohey ﬁnished?

Mr. McGohey: Yes, I am ﬁnished.

The Court: He seems -to be.

Mr. McGohey: I am trying to ﬁnd out where it is the witness
said that Mr. Winter introduced them.

Mr. Crockett: I call your attention to the sentence beginning
at the bottom of page 3352 where the witness said: ‘Follow-
ing Mr. Winter’s speech, as I recall, he introduced returned
veterans from the stage.’

Mr. McGohey: Thank you. That is on the following page

I and I had not seen it before, and all I am trying to ﬁnd out,

where it appears on page 3352 and—
21

 

Mr. Crockett: It begins on 3852. I assume if you are reading
a sentence that begins on 3352 you will read the end of it.

The Court: Iust give him a chance, Mr. Crockett.

Mr. McGohey: Well, on 3352 there was not a thing about
the introduction by anybody. I ﬁnd it here on 3353.

The Court: Well, it seems to me it is pretty small pickings
anyway. But go ahead. Did he say that?” (pp. 12,949-951)

CHAPTER VI
DISCOURTESY TO DEFENSE COUNSEL

“A judge should be courteous to counsel. . . .” (Canon 10,
Canons of Judicial Ethics.)

The Court mode of address to defense counsel is notably lack-
ing in ordinary courtesy. -

How Judge Medina observes the Canon may be perceived from
some of the following samples of remarks addressed by him to
defense counsel:

“Well, if that is highly prejudicial, I am an Eskimo.” (p. 2101)

“I am not going to read them either; so you can put that in
your pipe and smoke it.” (p. 2346)

“Mr. Isserman: I oﬂer these in evidence. May I state the
grounds, if the Court please?

gence.” (p. 12,702)

“Mr. Isserman: Now, if the Court please, may I have a

out all this creeping up on it bit by bit.” (p. 12,695)

CHAPTER VII

DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT COUNSEL

AND DEFENSE COUNSEL

The ]udge’s discrimination between Government counsel and

defense counsel is conspicuous.

“Mr. Gladstein: Objection. L

Mr. Shapiro: There was an objection, your Honor.

The Court: Objection overruled.

A. (Continuing) She said that-

The Court: You know, you gentlemen, when you object, why
don’t you get up? You know I think it is such a sloppy way of
doing. I don’t think you mean anything by it but it just doesn’t

. look right. I wish you wouldn’t do it.

Mr. Gladstein: Very happy to do that, your Honor. I thought,
by following the precedent established, according to my observa-
tion, by Mr. McGohey, that it would simply save time. One day
Mr.-

The Court: This-

Mr. Gladstein: May I state-

The Court: I know you like to argue over everything.

Mr. Gladstetn: No, I am not arguing.

The Court: Well, you are arguing.

Mr. Gladstein: One day Mr. McGohey made 52 objections,
merely using the word ‘Objection’ or ‘I object,’ and he did not
rise from his seat, and I assume that when, therefore, one makes
that kind of brief objection, it apparently is the custom not to
rise. So I have just done the same thing Mr. McGohey did.

The Court: You know, we went over this yesterday and I
said that, because one person did something that was not en-
tirely according to the practice of the,court, that was no reason

_for others. But don’t blow this up the way every little thing is

blown up here. All I am trying to do is, not to criticize you,
but to say it doesn’t look very nice.
Mr. Gladsfteinz I will be very happy to rise.” (pp. 5304-5305)
0 O I O 0

Reference has been made to a number of instances in which

Iudge Medina expressed lack of faith in the truthfulness of defense
counsel in the presence of the jury. The following is an example
of the contrary expression of complete conﬁdence in Mr. McGohey:

“The Court: Is  International Labor Defense something
24

 

that is a matter more or less of common knowledge, or is this
going to introduce a controversial feature here? I do not want
to multiply issues and have the trial go on forever.

Mr. Sacher: That isn’t—

The Court: I just do not happen to know what this Interna-
tional Labor Defense is. It may be something that will turn out
to prolong the trial unnecessarily. . . .

The Court: —unless this is some controversial thing, which
I a little bit suspect, and that is why I am hesitating about it.

Mr. M cGohey, do you have any reason to suppose that this
International Labor Defense is apt to be a source of controversy
here?

Mr. McGohey: I have indeed, your Honor.

The Court: Then I will sustain the objection.” (pp. 66219-
6221)

0 I Q 0 I

On one occasion Mr. Sacher, having exhausted a subject under
discussion and being about to start another subject, asked that a
recess be taken in view of the fact that the normal recess period
had about an°ived:

“The Court: Have you nothing further to go on with? We
took a little time out at lunch.

Mr. Sacher: I know; I really would not ask it, your Honor,
if I were able to proceed.

The Court: I would have been disposed to do it but I have
noticed you have this same tendency to make these irregular
comments, which doesn’t seem to comport with what you have
been telling me here. I think you can go on.” (p. 6616)

On page 6618, the record shows a recess declared by the Court,
that being the usual recess time.
Mr. Sacher’s request had been made a few minutes earlier.

CHAPTER VIII

JUDGE MEDINA’S CONDUCT TOWARD
GEORGE W. CROCKETT, ]R.

Judge Medina reserves his most barbed shafts for defense
counsel George W. Crockett, ]r., the only Negro attorney in the
case. Although he attacks all defense attorneys, his comments ad-
dressed to Mr. Crockett have a special character:

25

 

“VVell, how any sane person can think otherwise is dilﬁcult

for me to see.” (p. 2825)
D G I O .

“Well, that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard,
Mr. Crockett. I wish you wouldn’t do that. There is just no sense
in that at all.” (p. 3323)

_ 9 o 9 at 4:

“Well, I am afraid that you understand things in a differ-

ent sense from what they were said.” (p. 10,014) ,

D It 0 0 it

‘Well, that sounds crazy. You always seem to do that." (p.
10,038)

The ]udge attempts to attribute his own attitude to defense
counsel. It is quite common in the course of the trial for two or more
defense attorneys to make objections on behalf of their respective
clients. On one occasion, while Mr. Crockett was conducting an
examination, an argument ensued on an objection by the prosecu-
tion. Mr. Sacher arose and asked to be heard. judge Medina said:

“Mr. Sacher, what is it you desire to say that Mr. Crockett
was not competent to take care?” (p. 9865)

1D G I I I

On another occasion, judge Medina addressed Mr. Crockett:

"Is that all you are going to say? You don’t touch the subject
at issue and under discussion at all. I suppose that is because
Mr. Dennis is standing.

Mr. Crockett: I believe I did, and may I add that no one

need speak for me in court. I believe I am competent to speak
for myself.”
0 I O O I

No one can miss the extreme contempt with which the Court
addresses Mr. Crockett.

“You want to talk some more, Mr. Crockett?” (p. 1575)

“Oh, my, Mr. Crockett. You have something to add.” (p.
7275)

“Get down to business, Mr. Crockett.” (p. 12,133)

“VVhy don’t you get down to work, Mr. Crockett, instead of
all this fooling around, repetition.” (p. 12,262)

“I wonder if it is possible for me to impress upon you. . . .
Now, I beg of you to try to absorb that thought.” (pp. 12,321-2)

26

 

 

CHAPTER IX

ULTERIOR MOTIVES ATTRIBUTED TO DEFENSE COUNSEL

If Judge Medina in the presence of the jury ascribes devious
and concealed motives to the defense, the jury may thereby be
prejudiced in advance against whatever the defense lawyers or
witnesses thereafter do or say:

They want to" “get us off on all these other parts that have
nothing to do with the case, then maybe the jury will forget
what the case is really about.” (p. 2349)

ﬂ § G 0 I}

"When I hear these objections one after the other, after hav-
ing been in this sort of thing for some months, I begin to get a
pretty good idea what you are up to.” (p. 1805)

0 Q Q Q 0
“Mr. McGohey: If your Honor please, I have to object to

what we are going through now. We are having cross-examina-
tion on cross-examination. If we are going to go through each

day what was gone through yesterday, we are never going to -

get ﬁnished.
The Court: Well, I have been suspecting that for some time.
Mr. Gladstein: Suspecting what, your Honor?
The Court: That we would never get ﬁnished.” (p. 2238)

# Q 0 9 O

'“The Court: All right. Do I take it then that this subject is
withdrawn as it was yesterday?

Mr. Isserman: No, I would like to approach, it in another
way.

The Court: You mean sneak up on it?” (p. 12,734)

# O Q 0 II

“My purpose is to indicate, as I said, that I have observed
a number of things here which have impressed me as having
been done solely for purposes of delay, perhaps to drag out this
case for an indeﬁnite period; and before I do anything further
than what I have already done in that matter, I thought it well
to give counsel some warning because it is the conduct of
counsel that has caused me to reflect on the matter, and so I
have given this indication.” (p. 5827)

In presenting this document, the National Non-Partisan
Committee to Defend the Rights of the 12 Communist
Leaders, calls your attention to the opinion of Iudge Norval
K. Harris, Sullivan County, Indiana, Circuit Court, co-chair-
man of ourgCommittee, who has read the document and be-
lieves that it raises serious questions in relation to the ad-
ministration of justice. 0

Our Committee examined the document herein pub-
lished, an abstract of the Record, in the trial of the 12 Com-
munist leaders in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York.

It was prepared by a group of New York attorneys who
examined more than 13,000 pages of the record, with a view
of determining whether the press reports of the proceedings
were substantiated by the record.

  

Our Committee is of the opinionthat the contents of this I

document deserves the consideration of members of the
Bar.

 

“You may take the view that the only way to have justice
done here is to have endless repetition of all these things until
we all fall exhausted in the course of time, but I think not.”
(p. 8578)

O O O O I
“I think that all this delay is not happening by chance.” (pp.
8836-8837)

0 6 O I O

“If I were to abdicate my function, as you suggest, and let

you pour everything in, I suppose we would be here 20 years.”
(p. 9290)

O O O O O

“I do not want any more argument. That is the way it gets
all mixed up and the fog descends, and nobody knows what we
are talking about, and that is what we have had day after day
and month after month, and I do not want any more of it than
I can avoid.” (p. 12,022)

D O I I 0

“Mr. Gladstein: Your Honor, may I state the grounds of
objection?

The Court: I rather suspect it is what I have already heard
but you may do so.

Mr. Gladstein: Your Honor, I object because this calls for
statements not made by a defendant but statements supposed
to have been made by some other person, the theory of its being
offered against the defendants being that the defendant hap-
pened to be in the same room—same room in a public meeting.

The Court: At a Communist meeting.

Mr. Gladstein: Any meeting, and didn’t get up afterwards-
open public meeting, and because he didn’t get up afterwards
and say anything by way of disagreement or otherwise, the
theory is it is admissible against the defendant.

The Court: That is what you say the theory is.

Mr. Gladstein: May I know then the theory upon which it
is received.

The Court: You see, it is the same old story. You get up to
state grounds of an objection and argue, argue, argue. You ask
me questions and then you begin to ask Mr. Gordon, and then
we forget all about what we are doing and we have to start all
over again. »

Mr. Gladstetn: No, my point is it converts the charge from

one of supposed advocacy by a defendant into something that
somebody else said.

28

 

 

The Court: It is the old story. You want to get up and argue
to the jury, and perhaps others, when all you do is object and
you continually insist that you are stating grounds of an objec-
tion when all you are doing is just making a little speech which
you should reserve for your summation. The witness may answer

the question.” (pp. 3320-3321)

0 I I O C

At the opening of court on May 11, Judge Medina made a state-
ment in which he recited the number of pages of the record repre-
senting argument by defense counsel:

“Now the other day I said that I was having an examination
and study of the record made as to the amount of argument
made by defense counsel and I ﬁnd that of 8860 pages of record
from January 17 no less than 1554 pages represent argument by
defense counsel, not counting the testimony, what was said by
the attorneys for the Government, or by myself.

Now you may proceed, gentlemen.” (p. 5260)

Of course that statement, made on the record and in the presence
of the jury, had no proper purpose which the jury had a right to
consider as bearing upon the guilt or innocence of the defendants.
Its effect was further to undermine defense counsel in the minds
of the jury and to foster the impression that they were carrying on
a campaign to produce delay in the trial.

It is to be noted that the Court's statement refers to a study
made by persons other than himself, and the accuracy of the quoted
ﬁgures is by no means assured. The defendants have caused a
sampling to be made to determine what the facts are on the subject
of the Court’s comment, and for that purpose have caused to be
examined the following pages of the record:

Total Pages

Pages 1101 to 1173 73
” 1744 ” 2109 365

” .2575 ” 3058 484

" 3328 ” 3485 158

" 4097 ” 5259 1163
2243

Theyhave counted the number of lines of the record consumed
by the Court, by defense counsel and by the prosecution in that
sampling. This is what they have discovered:

29

 

Number of lines of the record
containing comments by defense
counsel 6,484

Number of lines of the record
containing comments by the Court 7,456

Number of lines of the record
containing comments by Govem-
ment counsel 2,896

In computing the number of lines of the record used by the
Court, they did not include the Court’s questioning of witnesses
or the routine instructions to the jury and statements for the record
upon opening and closing the court. On the other hand, the Court
included in the computation which he presented several thousand
pages from the jury challenge which consisted almost entirely of
colloquy in which the defense carried the laboring oar. Indeed,
the judge included pages containing the proceedings on a number
of complete days that had been set aside speciﬁcally for motions
and argument. '

Obviously if the above sampling is an accurate index of the
contents of the record up to that point, the statement of the Judge
was most misleading.

Moreover, in aggregating the number of lines used by defense
counsel, it should be borne in mind that there are six defense
counsel (including one defendant appearing for himself) and that
eleven defendants are represented. At times Judge Medina himself
has asked more than one defense counsel to state his views on a
particular question before the court.

Even if ]udge Medina’s insinuation were well-founded and de-
fense counsel had used a considerable amount of time of the trial
in motions, objections and arguments, that fact in itself would not
by any means necessarily result in the conclusion that they were
at fault. The indictment in this case represents a new departure
in the history of American jurisprudence. It charges as criminal the
teaching of a century-old economic and political philosophy. Never
before in any court in the United States was a person charged with
the crime of teaching Marxism-Leninism. The very novelty of the
legal questions involved inevitably requires defense counsel to ex-
ercise the greatest caution to take all legal steps which they con-
sider necessary or advisable.

Many of Judge Medina’s rulings,‘ as can be seen from the ex-
tracts appearing in this paper, are based solely on the fact that they
are necessary in order to shorten the trial. On that “basis” the Iudge

30

 

 

silences defense counsel, telescopes defense testimony, excludes
evidence presented by the defendants. The Court’s comments on
the subject of the duration of the trial have given currency to the
notion that a trial as long as this one isunprecedented in our his-
tory. Indeed, newspaper editorials have been published reflecting
that impression and thus wide publicity has been given to it.

The fact is that lengthy trials, much longer in fact than the
present one, even of many years’ duration, are not uncommon in
our legal system. VVhere property rights are involved, where the
interests of large corporations are in issue, where the ﬁxing of rates
is an object, and the like, lengthy proceedings appear to be the
rule.

For example, it appears from the record in Federal Trade Com-
mission v. Cement Institute, et al., 333 U.S. 683, that that case was
tried before a trial examiner for some three years and the transcript
of the minutes occupied about 50,000 pages. It is not expected that
the duration of the present case will be more than a fraction of the
Cement Institute case; but surely, in a novel case where questions
of advocacy and teaching by a political party are placed so sharply
in issue as under the present indictment, one would scarcely expect
that an American court would be more inclined to circumscribe
the defense solely on the basis of duration of the trial than it would
in a commercial proceeding.

31

 

PART TWO

]UDICIAL CONDUCT TOWARD WITNESSES AND
APPLICATION OF RULES OF EVIDENCE

The curious reader undoubtedly desires to learn the background
against which the antagonism described above has developed.
What were the rulings against which defense counsel desired to

‘argue? What evidence was admitted or excluded to which counsel

desired to address argument? In the usual case, where laws of
evidence are being uniformly applied, and the trial court does not

1 engage in advocacy of one side or the other, occasion seldom arises

for personal friction between court and counsel. The rules governing
judicial conduct are designed to avoid such clashes.

“A judge may properly intervene in a trial of a case to pro-
mote expedition, and prevent unnecessary waste of time, or to
clear up some obscurity, but he should bear in mind that his
undue interference, impatience, or participation in the examina-
tion of witnesses, or a severe attitude on his part toward wit-
nesses, especially those who are excited or terriﬁed by the
unusual circumstances of a trial, may tend to prevent the proper
presentation of the cause, or the ascertainment of the truth in
respect thereto.” (Canon 15, Canons of Iudicial Ethics, em-
phasis added)

“A judge should not in interrogating witnesses, ruling on

objections, or charging the jury, become an advocate for one side
or the other.” (F ritts v. United States, 80 Fed. 2d, 644, 646)

“In aid of truth and in furtherance of justice, the court may
question a witness—in fact, he may call and question a witness
not used by either party—but in so doing the court should be
careful to preserve an attitude of impartiality and guard against
giving the jury any impression that the court was of the opinion
that defendant was guilty.” (Gomila v. United States, 146 Fed.
2d 372, emphasis added)

“It is the judge’s duty to maintain an attitude of unswerving
impartiality between the government and the accused, and he
ought never in any questions he asks go beyond the point of
seeing to it, in the interests of justice, that the case is fairly
tried.” (Hunter v. United States, 62 Fed. 2d, 217, emphasis
added)

32

 

 

A trial judge in a federal criminal case “should sedulously
avoid all appearance of advocacy as to those questions which
are ultimately to be submitted to the jury.” (Frantz v. United
States, 62 Fed. 2d, 737-739)

“Despite every allowance he must not take on the role of a
partisan; he must not enter the lists; he must not by his ardor
induce the jury to join in a hue and cry against the accused.
Prosecution and judgment are two separate functions in the
administration of justice; they must not merge.” (U. S. 0. Mar-
sano, 149 Fed. 2d, 923)

Let us see how judge Medina has observed these injunctions.

CHAPTER X
THE MEANING OF “MARXISM-LENINISM”

The indictment upon which the defendants are being tried
charges that the defendants’ advocacy of “Marxism-Leninism” is
a violation of the criminal statute. The jury must, therefore, ascer-
tain whether the defendants did advocate the principles of Marx-
ism-Leninism and, if so, whether such advocacy was in violation
of the statute. Thus, the scope and content of “Marxism-Leninism”
is by the indictment injected into the case as a fact to be ascer-
tained and determined by the 

“Marxism-Leninism” is a term used generally by the defendants
to describe studies and theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin and others.
It is the synthesis of a century of study of social change, to which
writers in almost every country of the world have contributed. The
defendants contend that Marxism-Leninism embraces the totality
of man’s history and that it points the way to the scientiﬁc ap-
proach to society which the defendants claim that they apply in
the course of their political work. The broad scope of Marxism-
Leninism, as that of other schools of philosophy, is recognized
generally by economists and philosphers, whether Marxists or non-
Marxists.

The basic premise of the indictment is that “Marxism-Leninism” _

is a euphemism for “force and violence.” One does not have to ac-
cept the validity of Marxist-Leninist philosophy to recognize that
the meaning of “Marxism-Leninism” to the defendants cannot be
established by having a witness testify glibly to his own claimed
interpretation of the words.

However, that seems to be the method which the prosecution
has selected to establish the meaning of the phrase upon this trial.

33

 

Since that was the method adopted, one would have expected the
court to be quite willing in the interest of justice to ascertain from
the defendants themselves what they claim is the meaning of
Marxism-Leninism to them. Especially is this so in view of the
fact that the statute under which the defendants are indicted re-
quires proof that their conduct was knowing and wilful, and there-
fore their understanding is of prime importance. Nevertheless, this
is what happened. '

When Budenz, a Government witness who had been expelled
by the Communist Party, was on the -witness stand on March 29,
he was asked by the Court, over the defendants’ objection:

“Q. Mr. Budenz, I will read that sentence to you again:

‘The Communist Party of the United States is the political
party of the American working class, basing itself upon the
principles of scientiﬁc socialism, Marxism-Leninism.’

What did you in connection with the other Communists
that you were working with there understand that to mean?”
(p. 1804)

That question was adopted by Mr. McGohey (p. 1807) and Mr.
Budenz answered in substance that the term meant the overthrow
of the government by force and violence.

Subsequently, the defendant Robert Thompson, a member of
the National Committee of the Communist Party, testified. The
defense attempted to elicit from him an answer to the precise ques-
tion which Budenz had been permitted to answer.

"Q. Will you state to this jury what is Marxism-Leninism?

Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: Sustained.

Mr. Gladstein: May I call your Honor’s attention to the state

of the record-

The Court: No, I don’t want to hear any argument about it.

Mr. Gladstein: But, your Honor-

The Court: I will hear what this witness directed to be
taught, resolutions that he voted for setting up the schools and
what was to be taught in the schools, and when the time comes,
if it does, for him to testify what he taught and in particular
schools, within certain limitations I will permit. I do not con-
ceive the question before us to be one which makes that ques-
tion relevant.

Mr. Gladstein: Would your Honor notice that in the record
your Honor pennitted the witness Budenz to be asked precisely
that question and to give an answer to it?

The Court: You know, I just told you I didn’t desire to hear

34

 

 

argument but you wanted to get that point in and so again you
have become contemptuous. Go ahead. j

Mr. Gladstein: May I ask the witness the very same ques-
tion that Mr. McCohey asked, your Honor? p

The Court: I tell you, Mr. Gladstein, again, I do not desire
to hear argument.

Mr. Gladstein: I do not want to-argue but I am asking per-
mission— '

The Court: No, you are arguing, and you are again con-
temptuous.” (pp. 11,818-19) A '
Then Mr. Gladstein asked the question in exactly the same terms

as the Court had used in questioning Budenz.

“Q I will read the testimony in the record at p. 1808:

‘I will read that sentence to you again. “The Communist
Party of the United States is the political party of the American

working class basing itself upon the principles of scientiﬁc S

socialism, Marxism-Leninism.” What did you, in connection
with these other Communists that you were working with there,
understand that to mean?’-— -

Mr. McCohey: Objection.

Q. —I put to you that question and I ask you to answer it.”
(p. 11,821)

It is to be noted that the question put by Mr. Gladstein to the
defendant Thompson is precisely the same question which had
been put by Mr. McCohey and the Court to the witness Budenz,
read verbatim out of the transcript of the minutes.

“The Court: Is there objection?
Mr. McCohey: There is, your Honor.
The Court: Sustained.” (p.»11,821)

The defense tried again:

“Q. Will you tell the jury what, as you understand it, Mr.
- Thompson, is the historic meaning of Marxism-Leninism?

The to language of this question was a repetition of Budenz’ testi-
mony in which he described what he called “the historic meaning
of Marxism-Leninism.” The defendant Thompson’ was asked to
refute that prosecution evidence. However, I

“Mr. McCohey: Objection.
The Court: Sustained. Better get down to cases, Mr. Glad-
stein.” (p. 11,823) I

In Mr. McGohey’s opening statement to the jury, he also stated
that Marxism-Leninism meant the violent overthrow and destruc-

tion of our constitutional form of government. Mr. Thompson was
permitted to state a simple denial of the accuracy of Mr.
McGohey’s statement but was cut off when he attempted to give

the jury his interpretation of the teachings of Marxism-Leninism: '

“Q. I am reading from page 1132, a portion of Mr.
McGohey’s opening statement‘ to the jury-

Mr. McGohey: 11?

Mr. Gladstein: 1132.

Q.—-‘that reconstituted, they went back to the old Commu-
nist Party organized to establish Socialism in the United States

, according to the Marxist-Leninist teaching. That teaching is-
as we shall show—that Socialism can only be established by
the violent overthrow and destruction of our constitutional
form of government through the smashing of the State govern-
ment and the setting up of the dictatorship of the proletariat
by violent and forceful seizure of power under the leadership
of the Communist Party.’

I ask you wether that statement is a correct statement of the
teachings which Mr. McCohey called the Marxist-Leninist
teaching.

Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: I will allow it.

A. It is not.

Q. Now will you state what are the teachings of Marxism-
Leninism?

Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: Sustained.” (pp. 11,823-24)

CHAPTER XI
AESOPIAN LANGUAGE

Budenz testified (p. 1810-1) that the defendants used what he
described as aesopian language, whereby they assign to the words
used latent meanings not generally known or understood. That
testimony is an important part of the Covemment’s case in that it
permits proof of statutory intent and knowledge by means of
Budenz’s translation of words used by the defendants into other
words having criminal signiﬁcance. The jury will therefore have
to consider whether the defendants do in fact use aesopian
language. _

Nevertheless, ]udge Medina has on a number of occasions
stated in the presence of the jury that the defendants apply
peculiar meanings to common words. What effect will those com-

36

 

ments have on the jury’s deliberations as to the credibility of
Budenz’s testimony and the defendants’ denials?

“VVe never quite seem to ﬁnd a meeting of the minds on the
meaning of words, so that I suppose we had better not pursue
that. . .  (p. 9546)

O O O O 0

“Well, what interests me at the moment is the question of
interpretation, because I ﬁnd words that seem to have a com-
mon meaning, at least to me, are sometimes used differently.”
(p. 11,639.)

0 O I O I

“That word ‘discussion’ continually troubles me. Apparently
Communists use it to mean merely when somebody says some-
thing.” (p. 11,686)

D O C 9 C

“Mr. Wallace: Your Honor, I would like to be heard on that.
We have heard the word ‘report’ used frequently by the wit-
nesses here and I think that it has an unusual signiﬁcance in
Communist parlance.

The Court: Ask the witness to describe it then.

Mr. Gladstein: just a moment. I want to move that that be

A stricken, this word ‘report’ having any unusual signiﬁcance in
Communist parlance, as Mr. Wallace says. The word ‘report’
is a word you can ﬁnd in the dictionary. It isn’t used differently
by anybody, whether he is a Communist or not a Communist.

The Court: A lot of other words were used here by Commu-
nists in an entirely different meaning, according to the testi-
many-

Mr. Gladstein: I object to that.

The Court: ——which the jury may or may not believe. That
is up to them. '

Mr. Gladstein: I submit your Honor’s statement is not cor-

rect, and I therefore-

The Court: I say it is correct.

Mr. Cladstein: I assign it as erroneous.

The Court: We have heard a lot of testimony here of words
used by the Communists in these meetings and in their litera-
ture having a meaning that was different from what I would
normally give to them but whether that is so or not is a question
of credibility for the jury.” (p. 4146-7)

The witness thereupon went on to testify to his interpretation
of the word ‘report’ and it meant precisely what anyone would
understand the word to mean.

CHAPTER XII

RULES OF EVIDENCE NOT UNIFORMLY APPLIED

There appears to be a dual standard used by the Court in apply-
ing the rules of evidence to be followed by the defense and the

prosecution.

Take, for example, the requirement that before having a witness
testify as to a conversation, he must ﬁrst lay a foundation by stating
the time and place of the conversation.

EXAMINATION BY
THE PROSECUTOR

 Do you remember any of
them that you talked to about
that?

A. Yes, I talked to Stachel
about that, Gene Dennis about
it, John Williamson about it, yes.

Q. Was that in connection with
your work on the Daily Worker?

A. Yes, your Honor.’

The Court: You may answer.

Mr. Gladstein: May we have
the place or the time ﬁxed, your
Honor?

The Court: No, I don’t think
it is necessary to go into every
time they talked about this up in
the office of the Daily Worker
or the headquarters of the Party
there.

Mr. Gladstein: Well, the usual
rules are, as your Honor well
knows, that before a witness pur-
ports to give the substance of a

conversation with a defendant he V

is required to state when and
where, who was present, and
your Honor has indicated that
that rule is to be followed. I
thought so. Now are you aban-
doning that rule?

The Court: Overruled.

Mr. Gladstein: You are aban-
doning it?

The Court: Now go ahead,

EXAMINATION BY
DEFENSE COUNSEL

“Q. Did you use that state-
ment in connection with your
teaching and advocacy?

A. Deﬁnitely.

Q. And can you tell us what
you discussed in connection with
it without looking at the exhibit?

Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: Sustained.

Q. All right, will you tell us
what you did-

The Court: I think Mr. Mc-
Gohey’s objection is based many
times heretofore on the failure
to ﬁx the time and the place.

Mr. Isserman: I will do that.
Mr. McGohey: And who said
what?

Mr. Isserman: Well, the ques-
tion this time is what he said
Mr. McGohey. I did not ask him
what others said at the moment.

Q. Now will you ﬁx-

The Court: Well, whichever it
was, it is the customary way of
doing when you have a witness
on direct examination who is
about to give a conversation or
something that he said, or any-
one else said, to state where it
was, when it was and who was

there.

During the direct examination
of prosecution witness Young-
love, he was permitted to tell
who spoke at a meeting in “the
summer of 1946” in “St. Louis.”
Objection was made by Mr.
Crockett, but the witness was
not required to state the time
and place of the meeting.

“Q. After Mr. Munsell had
spoken to you did you talk to
anybody about joining the
Party?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And to whom did you talk?

A. Special agents of the FBI.

Q. And after your conversa-
tion with special agents of the
FBI, did you again talk with
Mr. Munsell?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did you say to
Mr. Munsell?

Mr. Sacher: I object, your
Honor.

The Court: Overruled.

Mr. Sacher: And I ask that the
time and place be ﬁxed, please.

The Court: Overruled; motion A

denied."

DEFENSE ( Continued)

Mr. Isserman: I recognize that
practice.

The Court: Yes.

Mr. Isserman: We had some
difficulty with that when some
of the Government witnesses
were on the stand but these
things happen. Your Honor will
recall we had to object continu-
ously because the witness Bu-
denz did not tell us when and
where certain ‘things took place.

The Court: Now, you know,
Mr. Isserman, it is nice to be
pleasant about it but you are
doing the very sort of thing I
have so many times said not to
do. It is quite improper, and I
do not want to make a fuss about
it.” (p. 8099)

VOLUNTEERING AND UNRESPONSIVE ANSWERS

It appears -that prosecution witnesses are permitted to volunteer
with impunity. But, the defendants are held to a quite dilferent

standard of responsiveness.

PROSECUTION WITNESSES

that out as not responsive and

“Q. Now, will you please tell
us where that conversation was

A. That conversation was had
on the ninth ﬂoor of the Com-

August 1935, upon ]ack Stachel’s
return from the Seventh Con-

I gress of the Communist Interna-

tionale in Moscow.

Mr. Gladstein: I move that the
last part of that be stricken. It is
not responsive, and not material.
I move it be stricken from the
answer.

The Court: It seems to me-

Mr. Gladstein: He was asked
where, your Honor, the conver-
sation occurred, and then you
will notice the last portion of the
answer has nothing to do with
the locale of the conversation. I
move that it be stricken for that
reason.

Mr. McGohey: I intend to
bring that out in the conversa-

The Court: Yes, I will permit
it to stand.” (pp. 1346;47)

Mr. Isserman. I consider this a
great classic of Marxism-Lenin-
ism.

The Court: Now, that is the
kind" of thing you are not sup-
posed to do.

The Witness: I am sorry.

The Court: That is positively
not responsive, and that is the
sort of thing you keep doing.
Nobody asked you anything

Q. I ask you, Mr. Gates, did
the United States Government

A. Without a declaration of
war, American arms is being

yond the answer to. the ques-
tion.” (pp. 9033.34)

THE DEFENDANTS’ TEACHINCS

Other rules, too, mysteriously change as the trial passes from
prosecution to defense. A basic issue under the indictment was
what the Communist Party actually taught. When the prosecution
attempted to prove the teachings of the Party and of the defendants,
the defense naturally insisted that the teachings described by the
prosecution be connected with the defendants before being ad-
mitted into evidence, that it be shown in some manner that those
teachings were those of the defendants. But this was not required.
However, when the defense sought to prove what was actually
taught at regularly constituted Communist Party schools established
by the defendants as the leaders of their party, they were pre-
vented from doing so.

TESTIMONY BY
THE PROSECUTION

Prosecution witness Philbrick
testified that he had been a mem-

ber of a professional group of
the Communist Party (p. 2805).
He was then asked. on direct
examination :

“Q. When you joined the pro
group and attended its meet-
ings did you attend, as part of
the meetings, any educational
classes?

A. Yes, I attended the educa-
tional classes in the pro four
groups of the—that I belonged
to at that time.” (p. 2806)

That having been established,
his examination proceeded as
follows: »

“Q. Now will you tell us, Mr.
Philbrick, who were the teach-
ers at these class sessions of the
pro group in the fall of 1947?

Mr. Sacher: I object.

Mr. Gladstein: An objection
was made to this general ques-
tion yesterday. I would like to
call your Honor’s attention to
the fact that unless it is claimed
that one or another of the de-
fendants was present speaking
on this occasion, or unless there
is established a good deal more
than any pretense of foundation
so far, this is prejudicial, imma-
terial, and simply means that
some persons outside this court
may suffer some economic or
other reprisals. I suggest that
your Honor reconsider the objec-
tions of mine because the value,
if any,—and I put the word ‘val-
ue’ in quotes—of this testimony
that is sought to be elicited,
unless there is a claim that one
of the defendants was there
speaking is highly prejudicial. ’

The Court: I see no necessity
in the case of a conspiracy
charge such as this of having

stated that he had been a teach-
er at a Communist school. That
it was a Communist school was
clearly brought out. (pp. 10,402-
03):

“The Witness: I think it would
be correctly described as a Com-
munist school.

The Court: That is, one organ-
ized and maintained by the
Communist Party? . . .

After some preliminary ques-
tions, the following occurred:

“Q. Well, what books, pam-
phlets or other works were used
in connection with the course?

Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Court: Sustained. I think
there must be some connection
between the defendants and this
course he gave before anything
further should go on as to the
details, as to which one of the
defendants, if any, instructed
him to give the course, or who
it was, so that we will see that
it has some bearing on the
case.” . . ‘.

Q. Well, Dr. Phillips, when
you gave this course-

Mr. Sacher: Excuse me a mo-
ment, Mr. Gladstein. This is the
ﬁrst time wehave had that sort-

quirements, that someone, some
defendant must have ordered
some witness or somebody who
taught a course——

of a conspiracy case, you know,

many colloquies, and it seems to
me that this defensive material

the physical presence of each of
the defendants on each occasion.
It depends on the way in which
the proof connects up. And I
have already indicated that I
shall charge the jury fully on
that and I shall adhere to my
ruling made yesterday. I over-
rule the objection.” (pp. 2818-
2819) .

Philbrick then went on to name
the teachers:

“The teacher in this class in
‘State & Revolution’, in this pro-
fessional group, included a girl
named Helen—let me see, it was
Helen, Jackie, Dick . . . Henry
and Butch who took turns in
teaching this particular course.”
(p. 2821)

Upon that foundation, testimony
of the “teachings” was admitted.

“Q. Now will you please give
us your best recollection of the
discussion there in that class?

Mr. Gladstein: Objected to.

The Court: Overruled. . . .

A. Well the discussion cen-
tered around the nature of the
State and a criticism of—of what
is called social democracy which
built up the possibility of a free

people’s State or something of _

that nature—I can’t remember
the exact term—and it empha-
sized this deﬁnition of the State
as a‘ special repressive force
and it Went through to the end
of the discussion in which it was
taught to us and explained to us
that this particular State, the na-
ture of the State required that

thrown, and that the State be

Mr. Sacher: But, your Honor,

we have -heard, during the
months that we have been here,
not a single defendant has been
connected with it.

The Court: You see, Mr. Sach-
er, you continually, and your col-
leagues, get up and make these
assertions that there is no evi-
dence of this and no evidence of

that, and that is matter of dis-

pute. ,

Mr. Sacher: But it is a fact.

The Court: And it does no
good to argue with you. I am
simply telling you for your own
guidance, that if this witness
taught this course in some way
under the supervision and direc-
tion of any of the defendants, I
am going to allow him to go
ahead and testify to what in-
structions he got and what he
taught. If it is something wholly
unconnected with the defend-
ants or anyone acting under their
direction, naturally, it has noth-
ing to do with the case. . . .

Mr. Sacher: But I think, your
Honor, if opinion is not called

CHAPTER XIII

PROTECTIVENESS TOWARD PROSECUTION WITNESSES
CONTRASTED WITH BADCERING OF
DEFENSE WITNESSES

"The Court frequently throughout the trial interrupted the ex-
amination of witnesses to ask questions, apparently for the sole
purpose of disparaging the defendant and his witnesses and dis-
crediting the defense.” (People v. Acardo, 140 App. Div. 929.)

The Court's “. .

. inquisitorial cross-examination of the defend-

ants, including the appellants themselves, all tended, we think,
to convey to the jury—though no doubt inadvertently—the impression
that the court was insisting upon a conviction.” (Williams v.

United States, 93 Fed. 2d, 685.)

The extracts which follow may furnish one answer to the ques-
tion posed above as to what were the rulings and objections which
produced the Court's apparent antagonism to defense counsel.

fact sailed on the Berengaria,

“Mr. Gladstein: May I suggest
it is wholly immaterial.

The Court: If he said he was

and all the time he was going to
go on the Berengaria it might
be material.

Mr. Issernum: I object to the
remark of the Court, and I ask
the Court to take judicial notice
that there is no requisite that a
person who states that he intends
to sail on one ship that he not
sail on another.

The Court: The whole thing
goes to the witness’s credibility.

Mr. Isserman: I object to your
Honor’s statement on the ground
that you have improperly char-
acterized the state of the evi-
dence at this point.

The Court: I don’t say that
that is the state of the evidence,
but if it should develop that that
is the state of the evidence it
may become material.

Mr. Isserman: No, but it is an
inference on the Court’s part
which isn’t warranted.

the 27th or maybe the 26th?

The Witness: It might have
been a month later or a month
earlier.

The Court: But you did re-
gister there under the name of
Joseph Parker? ,

The Witness: I registered at
the Southern Hotel. I don’t
know whether it was under the
name 'of. Joe Parker. It could
have been.

bursement.

Mr. Wallace: I think, your
Honor-

The Court: You doubtless
know the law, Mr. Gladstein. If
that is one of these speeding
tickets or anything of that kind
you know that is not allowed on
cross-examination. '

was asking whether-

The Court: It sounded like
one of those things.

Mr. Gladstein: Your Honor,
first of all I was asking whether
she had received reimbursement.

Q. It wasn’t a speeding ticket,
was it?

A. No, sir.

Mr. Wallace: I think that
counsel ought now to bring out
the entire incident, your Honor.

Mr. Gladstein: I think it might
be a good idea if Mr. Wallace
handled his examination and for
me to handle my own.

The Court: Well, I am not par-
ticularly anxious to have you
bring out the whole incident. I
think it is well if you let it
alone now, unless you want to
make it look as though it is some
big crime that she committed,
and then I suppose I will have
to allow you to go into it.

Mr. Gladstein: I don’t think
that remark was called for, your
Honor.

The Court: Well, after all, I
had the experience, you know,
with one of these other things
that was brought out and I got
an entirely misleading impres-
sion of what it was. This time I
am on the alert.

DEFENSE ( Continued)

The Court: Well, are you ac-
customed to using different
names when you register in
hotels?

The Witness: I am certainly
not accustomed, but my home
was wrecked and I had to stay
at a place, p and the newspapers
were carrying on this further
campaign of physical violence
against myself. So, to safeguard
my very physical security, I
used another name in register-
ing—possibly in registering at
a hotel. I considered that per-
fectly normal. It wasn’t some-
thing which I wanted to do or
did on occasions.

The Court: How can you
make all these explanations why
you did it when you don’t know
whether or not you did?

The Witness: I am referring
to a speciﬁc date at a speciﬁc
hotel. I have—I can’t have any
recollection.

The Court: I say, how can
you say that you did it to avoid
having some physical violence
or something else and in the
same breath say you don’t re-
member whether you did it?

Mr. Gladstein: I object to
your Honor’s question. It is ar-
gumentative and improper.

The Court: It is a little argu-
mentative. I will sustain the
objection.” (pp. 10,382-10,385)

N the United States Courthouse in Foley Square in New York

a trial is in progress which merits the attention of every member
of the American bar. Parallel with the trial of the defendants, there
is being enacted a dramatic test of the right of a lawyer to repre-
sent his client in the face of a presiding judge’s antagonism and
under pressure of public sentiment against his client. _

A group" of lawyers from New York, Newark, Philadelphia, De-
troit, and San Francisco are trying their case under personal attack
from the Bench; more, under a speciﬁc threat of contempt and
other disciplinary proceedings to be brought against them as soon
as the trial ends.

Newspaper reports have sought to give the impression that the
lawyers have been guilty of misconduct which has brought threat
of such action from the Bench. The purpose of the present study is
to ascertain from the record of the trial whether this is really a case
of lawyers’ misconduct or if, on the contrary, the Bar is faced with
the serious problem-of the right of a lawyer to defend zealously
and conscientiously clients who are the leaders of a minority politi-
cal group. The record poses the question whether lawyers are to
be penalized for having the courage and integrity to represent, with
the vigor and sincerity which their case demands, defendants who
are identiﬁed with unpopular causes.

The attorneys for the defense are RICHARD GLADSTEIN, of the
California Bar; GEORGE W. CROCKETI‘, ]R., of the Michigan Bar;
HARRY SACHER, of the New York Bar; ABRAHAM ]. ISSERMAN, of the
New Jersey Bar, and LoUIs F. MCCABE, of the Pennsylvania Bar.
Each of them, represents one or more of the eleven defendants. All
are trial lawyers of long experience, and good reputation. The
defendant EUGENE DENNIS is representing himself. The Govern-
ment is represented by the United States Attorney for the Southern
District of New York, ]oHN F. X. MCCOI-IEY. The presiding judge
is Hon. HAROLD R. MEDINA.

This paper is addressed to the judicial conduct of ]udge Medina.
It is not mere legal error which is here considered. In the analysis
that follows, the reader may discern a pattern of judicial conduct
characterized by bias against the defendants and their counsel, the
effect of which tends to deprive the defendants of a fair trial and
to obstruct the defense lawyers in the performance of their duty.
Every lawyer should consider the consequences to his own pro-
fessional dignity and freedom, if this conclusion is correct, and

CHAPTER XV
DEROGATION OF THE DEFENDANTS’ CASE

In this case, sharp issues are drawn as to many questions of
fact, credibility, interpretation. Frequently the judge either by his
comments or by his questioning of defendants and defense wit-
nesses, expresses his rejection of the defendants’ contentions.

For example, the defendants have contended that the Soviet-
German Pact of 1939 had the effect of isolating the Nazis from
certain appeasement-minded leaders and checking an imminent
assault on the USSR, thus helping to bring about Hitler’s eventual
downfall. To the extent that that contention is relevant and material
to the indictment, it is for the jury to pass upon. But ]udge Medina
has expressed his opinion thus:

“And I assume it is the time that Hitler and Stalin were
working together.” (p. 1427)

# 9 0 O 0

“Now, that Hitler-Stalin pact in 1939 does not sound very

much like world peace from what I have just been hearing.”
(p. 1445) I‘

The defendants contend further that their advocacy and teach-
ings which are under attack in the indictment should be tested in
the light of their program and activities on the immediate issues
facing the American people. They therefore seek to establish their
program and activities over the period covered by the indictment.
Judge Medina rejects that offer saying:

“Now I do not think it is going to be helpful here to go into
all. the lurid details—” (pp. 6439-40)

Not infrequently, the judge interrupts the examination of wit-
nesses to paraphrase and interpret their testimony deprecatingly:

“Now do you mean to tell us that before 1935 force and
violence was in and after 1935 force and violence was out?’—’

(p. 6743)

The judge makes comments upon the defendants’ testimony,
the eifect of which is to strip the evidence of signiﬁcance and
probative value.

“I don’t think you need to get off into that. It is confusing
enough to follow you as it is.” (p. 6748)
“It is a little remote from what we have been trying, but I
shall receive it.” (p. 9424)

“Well, you see, I take careful notes and I put down here as
a new subject ‘The change in policy of the Communist Party
in 1941,’ and then you went on to explain and explain, and I am
thinking, 'VVhat is the change, what is the change?’ and you
went on and on and I said to myself, "What is the change, what
is the change?’ And I said to myself, “Well, he is going to come
to it; that will probably be at the end,’ and I guess perhaps we
had better wait until tomorrow, but maybe you could tell us
now just before we leave what was this change you were talking
about.” (pp. 11,919-20)

“Q. Have you exhausted your recollection on this, Mr.
Chaka?

The Court: Give him a chance.

Mr. McGohey: Wait a minute.

The Court: He will think up the other two.

Mr. Gladstetn: He will think of them, not think.up the other
two, your Honor.

The Court: Well, you know, you people have distinctions
that really amaze me.

Mr. Gladstein: Well, I have heard-—

The Court: Is there a big distinction between thinking of
them and thinking up them?”

Mr. Gladstein: I think there is." (p. 11,162-3)

Witnesses are at times interrupted by the Court and questions
55

 

put to them and statements made which tend to confuse and
belittle them. During the direct examination of defendant Gilbert
Green, Judge Medina, interrupting the examination for the pur-
pose, asked him:

“The Court: By the way, Mr. Green, what is a fascist?

The Witness: What is a fascist? Well, I think you remem-
ber Adolf Hitler-

Mr. McGohey: Never knew him, did you, Judge?

The Court: I frankly-

The Witness: (continuing)-—and Mussolini-

Mr. McGohey: Did you know him, Judge?

The Witness:—and men such as Rankin in the South, and
men who, of the same ilk, wish to destroy democratic liberty
and want to impose an open, brutal dictatorship of ﬁnance
capital over the people. . . .” (p. 8809-10)

During the direct examination of defendant Robert Thompson:

“The Court: Now while I have interrupted you there, I won-
der if you explained to the Board that time what you meant by
this full democratic participation of the workers. It's not clear
to me whether you told them in the new dictatorship of the
proletariat ‘these old exploiters and monopolists and fascist-
minded people would just be excluded entirely and the workers
alone have privileges, or whether everybody was to have the
privileges such as they are supposed to have here. Did you
explain that?

The Witness: Well, I explained to them that—I wasn’t ex-
plaining to the Board here; I was explaining the manner in
which this question was being taught in the New York Party
organization, and on this question the manner in which it is
taught in the Communist Party is that all states are essentially
dictatorships, essentially dictatorships although their form varies,
and that the fundamental difference between the capitalist
state and the Soviet state or the dictatorship of the proletariat,
irrespective of its form is the capitalist state represents the rule
of the capitalist class; the dictatorship of the proletariat repre-
sents the rule of the working people. Now it is a dictatorship
over somebody, as all states are.

The Court: That is what I was wondering about.

The Witness: Yes, it is a democracy of the vast majority of

actionaries who were formerly the exploiting class in the

“The Court: How about it, Mr. Thompson; is that man dead?
The Witness: I have a recollection of-

The Court: A sneaking feeling that he is dead?

The Witness: I have no such feeling.” (p. 12,068)

During the direct examination of Miss Hartman, a defense wit-
ness, she was asked what, if anything, was done with reference to
selecting a place for a convention, and the following occurred:

“A. I suggested personally getting the hall for the convention.

The Court: Did you get credit for that? I suppose you did.
You did that personally, you say? .

The Witness: I don’t understand your question, sir.

Mr. Crockett: I must object-

The Court: It seems to me that the question is not so much
to call forth that you personally made the arrangement but
maybe it was. Anyway, you did it personally. You hired the
hall, and now what else did you do?

The Witness: I am sorry, I don't get your-

The Court: Well, you will get me if you will just let your
mind stay on this subject for a minute. The question is, what
did you do? You said you first hired the hall personally, your-
self. Now what else did you do?

The Witness: What I personally did?

The Court: No, what you and your associates did. You seem
to be getting a little more intelligent now.

The Witness: I am sorry, sir.

Mr. Crockett: I must object to your Honor’s remarks and I
must object primarily because of the insinuations and the im-
plications which I am sure do not appear of record.

The Court: No. It seems to me a perfectly simple question,
and I do not understand why the witness isn’t going ahead to
answer it.

Mr. Crockett: I asked the witness what was done following
that meeting of the arrangements committee-

The Court: All right. Why doesn’t she go ahead and tell us?

Mr. Crockett: About getting a place and she began to point
out initially she was given the responsibility of getting the hall-

The Court: And she did get it.

Mr. Crockett: And Mr. McCohey objected, it was ruled out.

whether a lawyer’s right to choose and represent his clients is to
be thus circumscribed.

In the pages that follow, we refer frequently to the oﬁcial
transcript of the minutes of the trial. The references are not ex-
haustive; they are merely illustrative. They are not necessarily the
best examples of the judicial conduct they typify. But the reader
may determine whether they demonstrate that this trial is now
proceeding in violation of the defendants’ constitutional right to be
represented freely by counsel and to a fair trial, and in a manner
characterized by bias and prejudice against the defendants and
their attorneys. I

In weighing the quoted extracts from the oﬂicial record, it must
be borne in mind that damage may result to the defendants and
their attorneys largely by reason of the cumulative nature of the
judge’s rulings and remarks. The extracts must therefore be con-
sidered in the context of hundreds of similar judicial acts. Even
that which, if isolated, may seem relatively harmless, must never-
theless be viewed as one of many parts of the pattern of miscon-
duct, the effect of which may well be an unjust conviction.

It may appear from the record that defense counsel, too, have in
their zeal and in the heat of the trial made statements which the
Court had reason to resent. Obviously, however, even if this should
be found to be so, it would by no means justify judicial misconduct
or bias against the defendants.

The propriety of Judge Medina’s conduct should be tested
according to ethical and legal standards long established.

“In every particular his conduct should be above reproach. He
should be conscientious, studious, thorough, courteous, patient, punc-
tual, just, impartial, fearless of public clamor, regardless of public
praise, and indifferent to private political or partisan inﬂuences."
(Canon 34, Canons of Judicial Ethics.)

“The impartiality of the judge—his avoidance of the appearance
of becoming the advocate of either one side or the other of the pend-
ing controversy which is required by the conﬂict of evidence to be
ﬁnally submitted to the jury—is a fundamental and essential rule of
special importance in criminal cases. The importance and power of
his oﬂice, and the theory and rule requiring impartial conduct on
his part, make his slightest action of great weight with the jury.”
(Adler v. United States, 182 Fed. 464.)

The extracts quoted below and our comments thereon fall
roughly into eight or ten categories of judicial conduct which they
illustrate. Except where otherwise noted, all took place in the
presence of the jury. The major categories are: r
(a) Rulings which tend to silence and immobilize defense counsel;

Then she testiﬁed that she personally went about getting a hall.

The Court: That is all right, and then I asked here what else

has indicated.” (p. 9779)

CHAPTER XVI

THE ]UDGE AS PROSECUTOR

The record discloses a considerable extent of participation by
Iudge Medina in the conduct of the trial. As can easily be deduced
from the excerpts set forth in this paper, the judge's participation
is quite generally in support of the prosecution. There are times
when the judge assumes a goodly portion of the prosecutor’s duties.
Notable is the judge’s tendency to engage in polemics with the
defense counsel in which he demonstrates his ability in debate and

 

repartee. For example, prosecution witness Philbrick testified that

he had submitted reports to the FBI and offered testimony as to the

contents of the reports. Defense counsel objected upon the ground

that the reports were the best evidence as to their contents, and

urged that the reports be produced for the jury’s inspection. judge
Medina said:

‘Well, I understand the desire of counsel to look into all

these reports to the FBI but I am not going to direct that that
be done.”

When Mr. Cladstein and Mr. Isserman stated that they did not

desire to see the reports, Judge Medina said:

“I hear what you say, Mr. Cladstein, and I still have my own
notions of what you desire to do.”

Mr. Sacher then offered to let the jury see the reports, without
the defense counsel seeing them. judge Medina met that offer by
talking as if the whole suggestion were funny.

“The Court: Yes, I know how much you gentlemen desire
to let in the light, and this is all right. Everybody is desirous
here of letting in the light and we can bandy words about and
have a little fun, but we come right back to the question, which
I will allow.

Mr. Sacher: I am very serious about that, your Honor. I am
not being funny about it in the least.

The Court: Well, a little humor now and then does no great
harm as long as it isn’t made habitual so that I take no offense
at it; and if you meant it quite "seriously, why that is all right,

but I am going to adhere to my ruling on the question.” (pp.
3164-66)

58

 

It is obvious that there was no humor whatsoever in the offer made
by defense counsel. The judge, however, succeeded in concealing
the nature of the offer from the jury and gave the impression that
something’ facetious was taking place.

On May 11th, at the opening of court and in the presence of the
jury, ]udge Medina at the outset made a statement referred to
above in which he purported to recite the number of pages of the
record representing argument by defense counsel. When defense
counsel asked that the jury be instructed to disregard the statement
he had made, judge Medina said:

“Now ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you remember earlier
in this case I told you that you were to decide this case on the
evidence that you get from the witness stand and the exhibits
that are put in. Don’t permit anything that is said or done by
defense counsel or any colloquy that I may have with them in
such matters affect your judgment in any manner whatsoever.
That is not evidence; it has got nothing to do with your determi-
nation and rendering of a verdict in this case. And so to that
extent I tell you pay no attention to what arguments may be
advanced or what may be said by defendants’ counsel except
in so far as they bear on your determination of the facts, and
similarly disregard any comments that I make and colloquy
that I have with them. Those thing aren’t evidence.

You are going to decide this case, if I ultimately submit it to
you for your consideration, upon the evidence that comes in
and on nothing else. And when lawyers ‘argue, as they will at
the close of the case, you will naturally pay careful attention to
all those arguments as they may, and doubtless will, help you
in your determination of the verdict based on the evidence.”
(pp. 5262-63)

Thus, requested to ask the jury to disregard his statement, the
judge purported to comply but in reality warned the jury against
statements by defense counsel!

During the cross-examination of government witness Blane,
Mr. Gladstein asked whether the witness had received a study
outline when attending Party classes. A series of questions on the
subject of a study outline was excluded upon the ground that the
question had already been answered. The judge apparently had
reference to the testimony which appears at page 5785:

“Q. During that period that you were at that school, did you
study from outlines of any kind?

A. At the end of each day we were told what to study for
that night so that we would be prepared for class the next day.”

Clearly, this was not a categorical statement that outlines were not
59

furnished and the further questions about outlines were therefore
proper. When Mr. Cladstein said, at page 5788:

“I haven’t been allowed to ask him whether there was one used.”
Iudge Medina replied:

“I say you have. You asked him; you got the answer that you

didn’t desire, so you want to put it over again four or ﬁve times.”

From time to time Judge Medina misstates the contents of
the record in the presence of the jury. While one might assume
that such misstatements result from inadvertence, it is a fact that
they are uniformly adverse to the case of the defendants.

During the cross-examination of prosecution witness Nowell, he
testified as follows:

“Q. Why did you leave the Ford Motor Company in 1944?

Mr. McGohey: Objection.

The Witness: Do I answer?

The Court: I will allow it.

A. The Communist Party entered into collusion with the com-
pany to have certain of us dismissed who were anti-Commu-
nists.” (p. 3544)

Later in the cross-examination the following took place:
“Mr. McGohey: Objection.
The Court: I will sustain the objection. I don’t remember
his saying anything about collusion between the Communist
Party and Ford Motor Company.

Mr. Isserman: May we have the record read back on that?

The Court: No, he said there was some collusion between
these fellows that were pushing things over on him-. . . .

The Court: This is one time, Mr. Sacher, when the record
is not going to be read.” (pp. 3548-49)

During the direct examination of defendant Gates, the following
occurred:

“Q. What did you say about it?

A. I said that the circulation of the Communist press in-—

Mr. McGohey: I object to this, your Honor.

Mr. Sacher: First he wants the speech. Now it is there and
he objects to it.
The Court: Mr. Sacher, why don't you give me a chance to
rule? -

Mr. Sacher: I am sorry.

The Court: Maybe I will agree with you. This time I do.

If he is going to state all the conversations, why, I suppose, there
is only one way for him to do it.

Mr. McGohey: If the Court please, my objection and the
60

 

 

motion to strike had nothing to do with any testimony. I submit
that the witness, if he is going to testify, must expect and coun-
sel must expect— '

The Court: Oh, I see what you mean. Instead of saying, I
said this and I said that, he gives these characterizations of them,
summaries of them?” (p. 6796)

There is testimony in the prosecution’s case about a book,
“Toward Soviet America,” published many years ago. The defend-
ants contend that the book does not represent their views and that
it has not been used in connection with any teachings or advocacy
on their part. Mr. Gordon of the prosecution staff made a state-
ment in which he referred to an outline which was actually used
by the defendants in connection with their teaching, and advocacy
and which was in evidence as Government Exhibit 51. Mr. Sacher
contended that that exhibit did not refer to “Toward Soviet
America":

“Mr. Sacher: I object to that. That is a misstatement of the
exhibit, your Honor. The exhibit does not refer to “Toward
Soviet America.”

Mr. Gordon: It certainly does.

The Court: It doesn’t? Then we will soon see that.

Mr. M cGohey: That we will determine.”

There followed a lengthy colloquy in which counsel and the Court
clariﬁed their intention to refer only to Exhibit 51. The Court then
referred to an entirely diiferent book, called “From Bryan to Stalin”
which had only been marked for identiﬁcation. However, there
were two places in “From Bryan to Stalin” in which the book
“Toward Soviet America” had been mentioned. The Court explained
that and connected it up with Exhibit 51 only by stating that “From
Bryan to Stalin” was mentioned in Exhibit 51. Thereupon, the
following occurred:

“The Court: Now ladies and gentlemen, solely for the pur-
pose of straightening out this little confusion here, I will tell you
that in this Exhibit 51, which is the outline produced by the
witness Herron, the last page has reference to ‘Additional read-
ing for future self-study’, and among the books stated there is
one called “Foster From Bryan to Stalin.”

Now this book “Foster From Bryan to Stalin” is here as
Exhibit 186 for Identiﬁcation. It contains in the portions that
have been read in evidence, which are respectively Exhibits
186-A and 186-C, two references to the other book which has
been under discussion here, namely, Foster's book “Toward
Soviet America.” There is no reference in the outline or any

61

 

 

statement in the outline that the book by Foster “Toward Soviet
America" had been repudiated and should not be studied, or
anything to that effect.

Mr. Sacher: Would your Honor please state to the jury that
there is no mention whatever of the book “Toward Soviet
America” in this outline, Government’s Exhibit 51, as I said
before?

The Court: Mr. Sacher, are you deliberately trying to con-
fuse this case?

Mr. Sacher: I am asking your Honor to place before the
jury the whole truth on this issue.

The Court: I made a very simple and comprehensive state-
ment of the whole matter.

Mr. Sacher: But it did not cover the point I am asking your
Honor to cover.

The Court: It seems to me every time I try to clear it up, you
try to befog it again.

Mr. Sacher: I asked your Honor to cover a point which wasn't
covered in your statement.

The Court: I will make no further statement to the jury
about it whatsoever.

Mr. Sacher: I object to that.

The Court: Well, you can object away. You always make a

rumpus every time you get in here.

Mr. Sacher: I object to that statement. That is not proper
characterization of my conduct.

Mr. McGohey: A reading of what your Honor just said to
the jury, your Honor, will make perfectly clear that your Honor
started of by saying that Exhibit 51 contained no reference to

the book Towards Soviet America.

The Court: H ow anybody could’ misunderstand is beyond
me. '
Mr. McGohey: It was the opening statement.
Mr. Sacher: I will stand on the record on it.
Mr. McGohey: So will I.
Mr. Gordon: Read it.
y The Court: You will stand on the record in all respects. It
won’t make such pleasant reading for you some day either.”

( pp. 9348-52)

Even when Judge Medina disagrees with an objection advanced
by the prosecution, the jury does not get any impression that the
prosecuting attorney is attempting to exclude admissible testimony.
To defense objections, the Judge replies curtly: “Overruled.” Almost
all prosecution objections are sustained, but in the rare cases where
62

 

an objection is not sustained, the ]udge says: “I will allow it.”

The effect is thatof a gracious Judge granting a favor in “allow-
ing” a question to which an objection has been made by government
counsel, not because the objection is invalid but out of sheer
generosity.

CHAPTER XVII

IUDGE MEDINA’S HEALTH

The foregoing extracts establish beyond the possibility of dis-
pute that Judge Medina is carrying on his role with vigor and
alertness and that he is fully in command of the situation. Yet he
punctuates the proceedings with frequent references to the adverse
eﬂect upon his health and strength of the legal steps taken by de-
fense counsel forthe protection of their clients.

The jury is thereby impressed with the fact that the conduct of
counsel for the defense is responsible for the ill health of which the
judge complains.

“You have my nerves so frayed here with all this dispute and
argument that I do not know how I am going to carry on this

trial month after month.” (p. 2502)

“I wish to state on the record that I am physically and men-

gling and argument and I shall have to do something about it
if it is continued and counsel refuse to obey my admonition.
It is more than any human being canvstand.” (p. 10,785)

The foregoing is far from a complete presentation of instances
of Judge Medina’s conduct shown by the record. Numerous as
these appear to be, they are in reality only examples. The record
is replete with others which are equally, if not more, shocking.
But it is believed that enough is here presented to give a fair, if
yet inadequate, picture of what has happened and is happening in
a courtroom in America.

PART ONE

THE ]UDCE’S ANTAGONISM TOWARD DEFENSE COUNSEL

AND ITS EFFECT ON THE TRIAL

CHAPTER I

SILENCINC DEFENSE COUNSEL

“The lawyer owes ‘entire devotion to the interest of the client,
warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his rights and the
exertion of his utmost learning and ability,’ to the end that nothing
be taken or be withheld from him, save by the rules of law, legally
applied. No fear of judicial disfavor or public unpopularity should
restrain him from the full discharge of his duty. In the judicial forum
the client is entitled to the beneﬁt of any and every remedy and
defense that is authorized by the law of the land, and he may expect
his lawyer to assert eve such remedy or defense.” (Canon 15,
Canons of Professional Et ics.)

“It is no grace to a judge first to ﬁnd that which he might have
heard in due time from the Bar, or to show quickness of conceit in
cutting off evidence or counsel too short; or to prevent information
by questions though pertinent.” (Sir Francis Bacon, On Judicature.)

Judge Medina’s rulings have all but succeeded in immobilizing
defense counsel. The best example of this practice begins with the
rule announced by the judge on April 4, 1949, near the beginning
of the trial, while the prosecution’s first witness was on the stand,
that thereafter when objections are made no argument may be
presented, nor may grounds of objection be stated, without leave of
the "Court (p. 2340-2341). The Court’s commands make certain
that defense counsel observe his injunction:

“The least observation you make, the better.” (p. 7123)

“The Court: Mrs. Lightfoot, in this matter of the strategy of

Mr. Saoher: No, I would like to state an objection, if I may.

The Court: No, we are not going to have the objection dis-
cussed. I am going to overrule your objection and allow it to
be marked. I don’t want to hear any more argument.

Mr. Saoher: You will allow this book in evidence?

The Court: I will. That is what your objection is to.

Mr. Saoher: I would like to state why.

The Court: I am not going to hear why. I am not going to

hear any argument from you at all on this matter, whether you
like it or not.” (p. 5823)
