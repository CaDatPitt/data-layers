WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE PEACE RACE?

 

In his speech at the U.N. last September,

PresidentKennedy called forthe initiation
of a "peace race". Few individuals have
been in a better position to effect such a
peace race than Kennedy‘ himself; but what
has happened to it? Were the words mere
rhetoric?

Tous.a peacerace wouldinvolvetaking pos-
itive and concrete steps toward peace and
the relief of international tensions--not
pouring increasing sums of money into "de-
fense" and "civil defense". Many times we

10 cents

in the SPU have proposed such steps, under
the name of American unilateral initiatives.
And we see the arms race go on.

The most basic change in U.S . military strat-
egy under Kennedy has been the gradual in-
troduction of a mobile army trained for con-
ventional and paramilitary conflicts, as
proposed by Dean Acheson and Maxwell Taylor
many years ago. This army is supposed to
give the U.S. an alternative to nuclear hol-
ocaust, but does it really do so?

It wouldseemto us thatconventionalfbrces
may increase and donbt diminishthe possi-
bility of nuclear war. This is because of
the escalation process. There is little
surety that,as one side loses,its nuclear
heroes--or even rational men caught up in
the fervor or war--will not order nuclear
weapons to be used. Besides, conventional
forces, being a less effective deterrent
than are nuclear weapons, will involve the
military in more crises, thus increasing the
possibility of wars which would probably
escalate.

But whathas become of thenew "peace race"
proposed by the President? What concrete
actions has the U.S. taken since September
to turn toward peace?

In the Berlin crisis, the U.S. has not of-
fered a plan which would take the strategic
area of Central Europe out of the Cold War
--for instance, U.N. occupation of all Ber-
lin or demilitarization of Central Europe.
Until the U.S. (and the Soviet Union) at-
tempt to negotiate onsucha.basis, any ne-

S’I‘;\TEMENT 0!“ PURPOSE

The STUDENT PEACE UNION is an organization
of young people who believe that war can
no longer be successfully used to settle
international disputes and that neither hu-
man freedom nor the human race itself can
endure inaworld committed to militarism.

without committing any member toa precise
statement of policy, the SPU draws together

young people for a study of alternatives
to war and engages in education and action

to end the present arms race. The SPU works
toward a society which will insure both
peace and freedom and which will suffer no
individual or group to be exploited by
another. After years of bad faith shown by
both East and west in disarmament negoti-
ations, the Student Peace Union believes
that to be effective any peace movement
must. act independently of the existing power
blocs and must seek new and creative means
of achieving a free and peaceful societv.

Smearetl Again

"Students Worried About 'Emotional Subver-
sion'"--thus is headlined a column in the
December 27th issue of the Chicago Daily
News. The author of the column, John Jus-
tin Smith, writes dailyfor the paper. The
subject of the column is the SPU -and the
concern it raised in the minds of a group
of Chicago area college students who are
worried about what they can do about the
SPU. Mr. Smith quoted from a letter writ-
ten by these students expressing their con-
cern about SPU's doctrines of "U.S. guilt
in ending the bomb test ban, pro-conscien-
tious objection, anti-ROTC". Mr. Smith's
sage advice about what the concerned stu-
dents can do is: "You can do just what you
are doing--holler. You can point out what
you consider fallacy in SPU doctrine." This
would seem rather difficult, we think, since
their conceptions of SPU doctrine seem a bit
fuzzy. ,5

At the end of the column,Nku Smith invitedé
people to phone hi with "suggestions, ques-’,
tions, gripes, etc." In a later column he,-
presented some of the opinions he had re-
ceived for and against SPU. Healso claimed
that many who phoned in favor of SPU were
"willing to fire verbal barrages, includ-
ing some that contain bombshells of hate and
dirty words" and "went into emotional fits
while charging that my column had introduced
emotionalism into a discussion of peace."

This sort of attack is a very good sign,
for it means that we are becoming a suffi-
ciently significant force to be noticed and
smeared, even in large newspapers. However,
it presents false information about SPU to
a large number of readers, and every effort
must be made to counteract this by present-
ing the facts.

fered a gift subscription for one year to

gotiation will come to naught, for the Ber-
lin "crisis" can be recreated at will, con-
sidering the confrontation of basic inter-
ests in the area.

In South Korea and South Vietnam, the U.S.
continues to support "anti-Communist" mili-
tary dictatorships which are more concerned
with retaining power than in the welfare of
their subject peoples--despite the clear ev-
idence that the policies of such regimes of-
ten lead to civil and international conflict.
Next door, in Laos, the end result of such a
policy has been clear: after failing to sus-
tain rightist Boun Ohm in power, the U.S. has
been forced to support (more or less) neu-
tralist Souvanna Phouma‘ in an effort to save
at least some of its influence and to stave
off complete control of the country by the
pro-Communist Pathet Lao. Clearly the U.S.
must, wherever possible, throw the great
weight of its economic and political power
on the side of those regimes, or potential
regimes, which promise to act in the inter-
ests of the masses of the people--even if
those regimes are neutral and leftist. _ The
result is more likely to be the sort of sta-
bility which leads to peace and which is the
best counter to Communism.

The Arms Control 8: Disarmament Agency, which
one would assume to be the vehicle for a"peace
race", is receiving a mere pittance (35 mil-
lion), compared with the $51.2 billion spent
on defense. Furthermore, recently named as
Deputy Director of the Agency was a former
head of the nuclear weapons division of the
Navy--not exactly a man with a vested inter-
est in disarmament.

But it is in two current crucial areas-test-
ing and civil defense--that the U.5. could
make the most immediately significant moves
to ease _the present spiral of tension. The
U.S. has been preparing for a resumption of
atmospheric testing for months; there seems
little doubt that such tests will be resumed
and that the world will once again be plunged
into a full-fledged headlong arms race. Does
President Kennedy have the courage or even
the desire not only not to resume atmospheric
tests, but to halt a_l__l testing? Such an Amer-
ican initiative for peace might well mean a
beginning of the peace race.

In the field of civil defense, the recent is-
suing of a booklet on fallout production her-
alds not a humanitarian attempt to save many
lives (which it cannot do) but a clear effort

M to convince the American people that nuclear

war is feasible and that the "American sys-
tem" of free enterprise and democracy would

, survive evena majorwar. Though the Admin-

istration's current civil defense program is
so inadequate as to be innocuous, the init-
iation of a massive program would undoubtedly
be preceived by the Soviets as an indication
of preparedness for war and would be another

~phase of the spiraling arms race.

In all these situations, the U.5. has been
unwilling to take the bold steps necessary
for theattainmentof peace. Rather wehave
--as in the past--countedcnxdeterrenceand
military power to insure that war does not
break out. But thesterility ofthispolicy

‘--and the need for a enuine " eace race''--
5

is clearly indicated by the failure of deter-
rence to deter the Soviets from aggression in
many quarters of the globe and by the erosion
of democratic values withinwestern countries
as a result of the arms race. In this con-
text, and given the failure of the world's
leaders to engage in a peace race, how can
we act to move them in that direction? Only
when American political leaders can make a
decisive break with past policies and con-
cepts can there be a peace race. Such a revo-
lution in American foreign policy can only
follow a change in attitude by the masses of
Americans. This, then, is how the SPU should

work towards a real peace race--by working

at the grass roots level and gaining the sup-
port necessary to influence political deci-
sion-making. This is not easy, but it is

necessary’ --Ed Cohn and Donald Mckelvey

New Year Rung In by Vigil and Fast

As a tower churchclock in Washington,D.C.
struck 12 noon on December 31, 1961 a silent
vigil facing the White House began. In the
course of the next 24 hours a well-disci-
plined line was maintained and by the next
day over 100 people had taken part in the
vigil. Twenty-twoschoolsand colleges were
represented as well as high schools in New
York,New Hampshire,Pennsy1vania and Mary-
land. Some adults from the Peace Action
Center, which co-sponsored the vigil, par-
ticipated. SPU and Peace Action Center
leaflets were distributed. On January 1,
1962 as the clock struck noon the vigilers
stood'still and silent facing the White
House, and the vigil was ended.

Washington Vigil and Fast Continued

As part of the vigil and fast started by
the students from Brinnell. College, six
students from the U} of Minnesota demon-
strated in front of the White House for 72
hours, beginning on December 18th, in sup-
port of Kennedy's "peace race" program.
The Minnesota group provided their own
printed call listing six initiatives the
government could undertake to further this
race. During the vigil and fast, the stu-
dents interviewed representatives of,the
embassies of the Soviet Union, Great Bri-
tain and Sweden, as well as of the offices
of Senators Humphrey and McCarthy of Min-
nesota, and the U.S. Disarmament Agency.
These visits, both encouraging and dis-
couraging,gave thestudents an opportunity
to have a give-and-take session with these
officials.

Other colleges also took part in this con-
tinuation of the project started on Novem-
ber 18th. Preceding the Minneapolis stu-
dents were students from Bethel College,

Newton, Kansas. Students from Drake Uni-'

versity in Des Moines, Iowa took part in
the vigil and fast with the Minneapolis

students. All three colleges were repre-

sented in the groups that visited the Rus-
sian embassy and the disarmament agency.

washington action —— 1962

On February 16 and 17, thousands of students
will converge on Washington to demonstrate
their rejection of both power blocs‘ cold
war policies. The project's actions will
include picketing of the White House and
the Soviet Embassy; visitations by student
delegations'hoCongressmen, foreign embassy
officials, and administration officials; a
march through the city to a massive rally
at the Howard University auditorium which
will feature Norman Thomas, Emil Mazey and
others; and an intensive on-campus campaign
to enlist participation, sympathy and sup-
portfbr‘the project, including circulation
of a petition enumerating the initiatives
being called for.

WHY WE ACT

In this activity, we emphasize two things:
most importantly, we are trying to involve
more people more intensively in ongoing peace
activity throughout the country. The peace
movement, at this point in its history, is
too weak to hope to be able to affect for-
eign policy; to remedy this situation, we
need more and stronger grass roots support.
This does not exclude, however, our second
orientation, that of confronting those who
hold important policy-making positions in
the US government and those who represent
other nations, in an effort to express our

‘concern aboutthecontinuing effects of the

arms race and to «deepen our understanding
of the complex forces which shape the for-
eign policy of all nations.

WHAT WE PROPOSE

The project, which has been called by a num-
ber of youth peace groups , is protesting civ-
il defense and nuclear testing_and is pro-
posing American initiatives for peace. Among
the latter are: announcement that the US will
not resume atmospheric testing; withdrawal
from all missile bases whose vulnerability
to attack makes them useless except for
first strike; exploration of disengagement
in Central Europe; massive aid to underde-
veloped nations carried out under UN aus-
pices; extensive planning for a changeover
to a non-military economy; strengthening of
the Arms ‘Control and Disarmament Agency; re-H
peal of the Connally amendment, thus obliga-
ting the US to bring all international dis-
putes to which it is a party before the world
Court and to accept the‘ Court‘ s decision;
halting of civil defense, which prepares
the US people psychologically for war with-
out protecting them from the immediate or
long-term effects of such a war; and limi-
tation of the "nuclear club."

WHAT YOU CAN DO

We urge all SPU members and others to par-
ticipate in the Washington Action project
as fully as possible, either in Washington
or on campus in sympathy protests , and espe-
cially duringthetdme before and after the
demonstration when new contacts are being
made and continuing peace action and educa-
tion set up. This is an opportunity to make
ourselvesapolitical force which cannot be
ignored; let us use it to increase the growth
of the student peace movement.

NATIONAL COUNCIL MEETS

In its last session before the 1962 National
Convention, the 1961-62 SPU National Council
met from December 27 to 29 at the New York
office of the American Friends Service Com-
mittee. (The minutes of the meeting are in-
cluded with this Bulletin to all members.)
A very encouraging sign was the attendance
to the sessions of many SPU members who are
not members of the NC. The following is a
condensation of the most important business
taken up at the meeting:

National, Regional and Financial Reports
and Personnel: outgoing National Secretary
Roget Lockard pointed out that SPU§s rapid
growth has resulted ina number of problems,
notably finances and personnel. We are still
operating in debt, and desperately need
field secretaries in all parts of the coun-
try. Regional structure must be strength-
ened in order to provide a continuing and
permanent framework for the co-ordination
of existing local groups’ efforts and to
meet the organizational political problems
involved in rapid expansion. For this rea-
son, the NC elected as field secretaries
Roget Lockard, Pete Allen and Dave Golden,
who will serve in the East, Midwest and West,
respectively. Mike Nolan will take off time
from school to serve as New York City re-
gional secretary (formerly Pete Allen ‘s
post). Don McKelvey was elected National
Secretary to replace Roget Lockard. Espe-
cially encouraging are thedevelopment of
a full-fledged region covering the South
Atlantic area and based in Washington, D.C.;
the spontaneous growth of some regional.
groupings, especially in south Ohio, Minne-
sota and possibly western Pennsylvania; and
the development of SPU chapters on the West
Coast, especially a strong one on the key
campus of Berkeley. A new steering com-
mittee was elected of the following: Pete
Allen, Philip Altbach, Ed Cohn, Dave Kelly,
Amy McKelvey, Don McKelvey, Mike Parker, Ruth
Rose, ‘Merry Wood. The posts of New England
Regional Secretary and Finance Secretary are
open due to resignations.

National Proiect: The NC strongly endorsed
the idea of a national project centering
around a march in Washington, and made the

‘following recommendations: that the date

he sometime after March 15; that civil dis-

. obedience be committed in order to picket

the Soviet Embassy; and that, if time per-
mits, drafts of all statements, leaflets,
class, etc., be submitted to local groups
and then returned to the central committee,
in order to insure maximum local participa-
tiano

National Convention: The date of the con-
vention will ‘be either April 6-8 or April
27-29, with the place to be Antioch, Ober-
lin, Minneapolis or‘ Carleton. It was de-
cided to starttheconvention or Friday af-
ternoon and to have two sets of workshops,
political and organizational, and two or
three plenary sessions. The Council voted

that only SPU members would lead workshop
discussions and that working papers should
be out at least a month before the conven-
tion and recommended to the convention that
a constitutional revision be made so as to
exclude non-delegates to the convention from
having speaking rights. It was also voted
that delegations would be chosen on the ba-
sis of one delegate for each chapter or group
and, in addition, one delegate for each 15
members or major fraction thereof.

Political Issues: The NC did not have time
to discuss the issues of civil defense, Mc-
carren Act,iUN, and India and Goa, and left
them either to the Steering Committee or to
general discussion in the Discussion Bulle-
tin. All members are urged to submit papers
on these and any other subjects to the Dis-
cussion Bulletin, especially since the na-p
tional convention is coming up soon.

Religion Conference ~

To Be Held

On Saturday, February 10, the SPU will spon-
sor a one-day conference entitled The Nu-
clear Imperative and Christian Decision.
Intended to attract students from the mid-
west, it will be held on the campuses of the
Chicago Theological Seminary and the Uni-
versity of Chicago and will constitute an
attempt to involve serious Christian stu-
dents in a continuing concern with the re-
lation of religious values to the world
situation.

The day's activities will include speeches,
panels, and workshops with participation by
eminent Christians, both clerical and lay.
The following have already agreed to par-
ticipate: Howard Schomer, president of
Chicago Theological Seminary; Norman Whit-
ney, noted Quaker educator; Kermit Eby,
Professor of Sociology at the University of
Chicago and a noted Brethren; Dr. Eler
Hjortland, Paster of United Lutheran Church
in Oak Park; Tyler Thompson, professor of
philosophy of religion at Garrett Theolo-
gical Seminary.

Accomodations will be provided for those
needing them if they notify the SPU National
Office in advance. There is also the pos-
sibility that funds may be available to
cover some of the transportation costs for
those attending from more distant schools.
Contrary to the origianl flyer, the regis-
tration fee will be two dollars. More in-
formation can be obtained from the National
Office. --Gordon Burghardt

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor:

The last sentence of our statement of pur-
pose reads: "After years of bad faith shown
by both East and West in disarmament nego-
tiations, the Student Peace Union believes
that to be effective, any peace movement
mustactindependentlyof theexisting power
blocs and must seek new and creative means
of achieving a free and peaceful society."

As I interpret thisstatement itmeans that
we are for peace and against the cold war
policies of both power blocs, that our stand
on any issue will be based on independent,
unprejudiced study of that issue. It would
seem that few peace groups, or individuals
concerned with ending the cold war, would
differ with sucha position. However, I have
comeacrossanotherconceptof SPU position.
I will try to summarize it as follows:

Since both East and West have contributed
to thecold war,we will identify with nei-
ther. We are a group of people who want
peace; we will direct our efforts equally
against all people or groups of people who
endanger peace, no matter what country they
happen to represent. v

I feel that _such a concept is inadequate
because it ignores our personal responsi-
bility as Americans for all that our gov-
ernment does. We are responsible for our
government'sactions,not because it is the
war-monger or the protector of peace, but
because it acts in our name. We will in
actuality be held accountable for what it
doesgshould there bea.panic in Washington
leading tothe wrong buttons beinggnwssed,
we will die for it. Furthermore, it is our
own government which American students as
voters, future voters and people in commu-

nication with voterscan hope toinfluence.

It seems essential that any American peace
group keep these points in mind. If we ac-
cept the concept that we are not only peo-
ple who want peace, but also American cit-
izens, it seems valid to conclude that the
bulk of our effort must be directed toward
influencing our own government. What we
ask our government to do should depend on
as comprehensivea study as possible of the
issues involved in its policy decisions.
Such a role need in no way preclude a po-
sition on, and efforts directed against,
specific cold war acts on the part of ano-
ther power. It does mean, however, that we
recognize that signs saying"Peace"carried
by American students take on different mean-
ings in front of the White House and in
front of the Russian embassy; so would signs
saying, in effect, "Stop your cold ,war poli-
cies!"

A position which gave primary importance to
our responsibilityas Americancitizens for
American foreign policy should cut across
the political differences of opinion which
are bound to occur in anything as broad as
an effective peace movement. Our personal
speculations about the percentage of blame
to be allocated to the Kremlin and the per-
centage to be allocated to the White House
become irrelevant. ,The question is not,
primarily, whom to blame for what, but how
to persuade our government to take those
actions which we conclude, on the basis of
study, to be in the interest of peace.

JAPANESE PEACE MOVEMENT DIVIDED

The USSR's resumption of nuclear testing
has probably assured the collapse of, or
at least an irreparable split in, the Japan
Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs,
the organization which has sponsored the
seven World Congresses Against A and H
Bombs. Gensuikyo's crisis, which is older
than the recent Russian tests, sets forth
clearly the problem faced by peace move-
ments in the non-Communist countries. That
is, how to avoid becoming the apologist,
in the name of peace, for the moves of one
of the military camps.

Gensuikyo's failure to maintain its inde-
pendence (in contrast, for example, with
the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarma-
ment) has doomed it, and this fact is of
considerable importance both for the world
movement against nuclear testing and for
Japanese domestic politics. For Gensuikyo
has not only been the organizer of the an-
nual World Congresses, but it has been the
"official" peace movement of a. country
sharply divided on everything else, but
unanimous in its dread of nuclear weapons.
Gensuikyo played a particularly important
role in the opposition to the revision of
the Japan-U.S. Security’ Pact and in the
overthrow of the Kishi Government in 1960.

It was American bombs which fell on Hiro-
shimaand Nagasakiand American tests which
killed Japanese fishermen in the Pacific;
the troops stationed in Japan are American,
and Okinawa is kept from Japan asa base for
American nuclear bombers and missiles. It
isnotremarkablenor inappropriatethat the
Japanese peace movement should be primarily
"anti-American" in the sense that its day
to day activity in Japan should be directed
largely against the threat posed to Japan
by U}S. military preparations. The anti-
American bias of Gensuikyo was inevitable
and by itself did not make it either Com-
munist or pro-Communist. And, indeed, the
most powerful forces behind Gensuikyo were
the Socialist Party and the General Council
of Labor Unions (Sohyo), both independent
of international Communism and both bitterly
hostile to the Japan Communist Party.

But Gensuikyo, and its non-Communist sup-
porters, succumbed to a persuasive argument
which is not unique to Japan--the plea for
unity. The main tasks for us in Japan, the
argument goes, are the abrogation of the
Security Treaty and opposition to Japanese
rearmament, and since our influence can be
greatest on the Japanese government, and
through it, on the Americans, let's unite
on these questions on which we agree. There
is nothing we can do about the U.S.S.R.'s or
China'spolicies,sornising questionsahout
them is simply divisive and disruptive.

Having adopted this logic, Gensuikyo and
its World Congresses also passed resolutions
against colonialism (Western), on which
everybody agreed, but ignored Hungary and
Tibet, which were disruptive questions. In
this way, without one pro-Communist state-

     

ANTI-BOMB RALLY: IN JAPAN THE BOMBING OF HlRO'
SHIMA IS THE MAJOR ANNIVERSARY OF WORLD WAR II

ment, its Congresses earned delegates from
many countries which would otherwise be un-
represented,e.g.,Czechoslovakiaand China;
it received greetings from Khrushchev, and
itschairman Kaoru Yasui wona Stalin Peace
Prize. But in such a movement, one could
not very well exclude Japanese Communists
fromeitherparticipationor leadership,and
the Socialist Party and Sohyo, themselves
having followed a policy of "anti-anti-Com-r
munism," were in a very weak political po-
sition to combat actual control of Gensui-
kyo by the Communist Party,which,although
despised by the Japanese people, has over
twice the membership of the Socialist Party.

The first open break occurred in May, when
the right-wing Democratic Socialist Party
and the Japan Trade UnionCongress(Zenro),
plus some youth and women's organizations,
pulled out of Gensuikyo claiming it was too
"political," i.e., too intimately connect-
ed with the Communists. These groups have
since formed a "non-political" Council for
Peace and against Nuclear Weapons, dubbed
in the press"No.2 Gensuikyo." The Social-
ist Party and Sohyo, while reaffirming their
support of Gensuikyo, openly denounced its
leadership as "too partisan" and insisted
that thecoming World Congressdenounce the
U.S.S.R.-Norﬁﬂi Korea. Pact, the U.S.S.R.-
China alliance, and the Warsaw Pact as well
as NATO, SEATO, the U.S.-Japan Pact, etc.

'As insurance, they scheduled observers and

sent greetingsto the Congressscheduled by
their rivals in the No. 2 Gensuikyo.

The Seventh World Congress, which opened in
Tokyo August 12, was the biggest and prob-

ably the most impressive yet, bu; it began
with a. scandal. Dr. Earle Reynolds, the
Americanpacifist,whosailed hisyacht into
the Eniwetok test area, was expelled from
the planning sessions because he intended
toparticipatein thecongresscalled by No.
2 Gensuikyo as ‘well. Reynolds’ expulsion
affronted democratic sentiments and made a
much greater impact on the Japanese public
than did the expulsion in 1960 of Trotsky-
ist Farrell Dobbs, who criticized the Com-
munists at the Sixth Congress. Dobbs is

unknown, but Reynolds‘ protest voyage is_

famous in Japan, and Reynolds has spent much
time in Japan, both with the Atomic Bomb
Casualty Commissionand asa teacher at Hi-
roshima University.

After‘ the World Congress, the Socialist
Party was left in an uncomfortable predi-
cament. It could continue to support Gen-
suikyo, but the one-sided outcome of the
Congress made its reform quite beyond the
power of the Socialists. Or it could throw
its support to No. 2 Gensuikyo, but the
latter course would be a’clear political
victory for the Democratic Socialists on the
very issue--anti-Communism--on which they
left the Socialist Party. For the moment,
the Socialist leadersstated they wouldat-
tempt to reform the Gensuikyo from within.

The announcement, August 30, that Russia
was resuming testing shocked Japan. Hideki
Yukawa, Nobelprize-winning physicist,said
thedecision"turned back the pages of his-
tory . . . my feelingsare bleak."The Gov-
ernment sent a strong note to the U.S.S.R.
The various rightistgroups,the World Fed-
eralists, and the Socialist Party all sent
protest delegations to the Russian Embassy.
The Zengakuren mainstream leadership stated
that resumed testing was part of ". . . a
new militarism intended to stabilize the
Stalinist system." Gensuikyo, the Japan
Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs
. . . was silent. Dr. Yasui, the chairman
of Gensuikyo, was confronted by reporters
with a resolution from the World Congress
beginning, "The first nation to resume test-
ing will brand itself anenemyof peace..J'

SPU Symbm

The Student Peace Union "lollipop" symbol
was developedfour years agoin England by

J a member‘ of the British Campaign for Nu-

clear Disarmament and was originally used
by that organization. In the past few years
it has beenadopted by peaceorganizations
in thewestern nations,including the Stu-
dent Peace Union and the Committee for Non-
Violent Action in the United States and the
Swedish,German,Dutch and Belgian disarm-
ament organizations.

The symbol itself is made up of the sema-
phore flag code symbols for N (vertical

‘line) and D (inverted V) standing for Nu-

clear Disarmament.

10 for $.90; 50 for 94.00; 100 for $7.00;
500 for $25.00. SPU Regions and Chapters
may obtain buttons on consignment.

Yasui said, "I cannot regard the U.S.S.R.
asauienemy of peace . . . if one reads all
the motivations in the Soviet statement,
one must conclude their policy" has justi-
fication." He admitted "some would say"
that the above resolution was adopted in
the expectation that the U.S. would be the
first nation to resume testing.

The United States may relieve some of the
pressure on Gensuikyo and help frustrate the
efforts of the Japanese Communists to iso-
late themselves completely, by herself re-
suming nuclear tests. But Gensuikyo will
never be the same; neither in Japan nor in
the world at large will itcommand muchre-
spect.

I think there is a lesson here, in connec-
tion with the plea for unity whichcropsup
throughout the Peace movement. There are
many kindsof differences whichcan be min-
imized in. the interest of‘ united action,
e.g., pacifists and non-pacifists, Buddh-
ists, Christians and Marxists, etc., but
when we consider thecold war itself,there
is no arena which is irrelevant, and which
can beignored in the interest of unity.
Struggles for self-determination are rele-
vant,as the Seventh World Congressacknow-
ledged by passing resolutions against co-
lonialism. But both power blocs act as
enemiesof peace and human freedom,and the
movement for’ peace, or democracy, which
sees only’ its adversary‘ of the moment is
bound eventually to finditself"betrayed,"
if it is not so compromised, like Gensuikyo,
that it joins in the betrayal. For there
are bound to be more Algerias and Cubas,
more Hungarys, and more nuclear tests . . .
Theonly way tooppose imperialism is to be
for freedom and peace--consistently.

PAPER HATS IN BALTIMORE

Early in December CONCERN,the SPU group in
Baltimore, distributed paper hats labeled
"Bomb Shelter" along with a message asking
people ‘ho urge the President to follow
through with his constructive peace race.
Some 5,000 hats and leaflets were distrib-
uted on a city-wide basis. Press coverage
was good and public reaction was encourag-
ingly sympathetic. The group feels that it
was the"gimmick"of the hats that made the
project so successful because it seems to
have caught the imagination of the commu-
nity in general, including people who might
not otherwise have been concerned.

Illinois Armory. In snow and a ten-degree
wind, they handed out leaflets calling at-
tention to the significance of mass civil
disobedience in Great.Britain. Their neat-
ly-lettered signs bore the following slo-
gans: "CARRY 0N,COMMITTEE OF 100!" "THREE

GOLDWATER PICKETED, MCREYNOLDS FOLLOW-UP

Activity at Kenyon College has been excit-
ing and encouraging. Barry Goldwater came
to speak and a group of students organized
a picket line to oppose his speech. The
pickets were pushed and hit. by snowballs;
peoplewalked through the lineineu1attempt
to break it up; signs were torn. But the
line held up excellentlyeuniresponded with
non-violent discipline. The result was a
solidification of the group. On the campus
asa.wholeg Goldwater made only a luke-warm
impression. McReynolds came shortly after-
wards and,in comparison,hit Kenyon like a
bombshell. Hespokeon two different nights
and was very well received.

At present the new and growing SPU group is
circulatinga petition protesting civilde-
fenseand is discussing theaims of a prac-
tical peace organization. Its members are
looking for qualified speakers to provide
continuing education fbr"what promises to
be a strong chapter. --Barry Gordon

CONFERENCE TO BE HELD AT SWARTHMORE

An ad hoc committee of Swarthmore College
students, with the assistance of faculty
advisors, is presently planning an Intercol-
legiate Conference on Disarmament and Arms
Control, to be held at Swarthmore College
over the weekend of February 16-18. The
Conference will draw upon the knowledge of
expertsand the interest and concennof se-
lect students from prominent American col-
legesand universitiesin order to consider
the problems and promise of various alter-
natives to an accelerating international
arms race. It is hoped that the student
representativeswill become betterinformed
about thecontroversialissuesandgubposals
that divide American experts studying the
problem. The Conference should encourage
the students to become more conscious_ of
and thoughtful about roles that students
might play as individuals and as groups in
the search for international stability and
order through deterrence, disarmament, or
arms control. For further information con-
tact: David Wegman. Swarthmore College,

STUDENTS FREEZE eon DISARMAMENT
Despite freezing weather, thirty high school

and college students participated in a vigil.

in downtown Cleveland on December 30th.
Planned to coincide with the demonstrations
going on in Washington, the vigil was held
to protest against nuclear testing, war pre-
parations, and civil defense. The press and
TV °°Ve1-"age of the vigil was good, but it
was of greatest value to the participants
themselves. A small group of them is plan-

"MERRY CHRISTMAS" IN PITTSBURGH

‘In a Christmas demonstration organized by

the Pittsburgh SPU city council, 4000 "A
Time for Peace" leaflets were handed out to
shoppers and businessmen. The demonstra-
tors hit upon the idea of a "Merry Christ-
mas" with each leaflet, and censuring frowns
blossomed into begrudged smiles, smiles into
out-and-out support. It was estimated that
three out of four who were offered the leaf-
let accepted it. At present, Pittsburgh
SPU members are making plans for partici-

—pation in the Washington project. Also on

the drawing board are plans for demonstra-
tions, speakers and letter-writing over
Easter weekend. --Tom Rodd
