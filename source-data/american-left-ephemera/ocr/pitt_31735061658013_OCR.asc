Dear Friend, '

On the inner pages of this folder you will find an
"Open Letter” addressed to United States Attorney
General J. Howard McGrath in behalf of the four Trustees
of the Civil Rights Congress - Dr. Alphaeus Hunton,
Secretary of the Council on African Affairs; Frederick V.
Field, editor and writer on the Far East; Abner Green,
Executive Secretary of the Committee for the Protection of
the Foreign Born and Dashiell Hammett, well—known author.

These four men are in prison. They are held without
bail although they have never been accused, indicted or
tried for any crime. They received much publicity.

Their personal lives and political opinions were blazoned
in headlines of national and international circulation.
What was inadequately reported were the simple facts

of how and why these men were imprisoned. This "Open Letter"
is an effort to place these facts before the American
people. It is proposed to insert this "Open Letter" as

a public ad in a newspaper of national circulation to
bring home to hundreds of thousands of Americans that
these men, at considerable cost and pain to themselves,
are defending the validity of the Constitution and the«
Bill of Rights for all Americans.

We, whose names appear below, believe that most of
our fellow Americans are deeply concerned with the
preservation of civil rights and due process of law in‘
our country today. We earnestly ask you to join in
maintaining these fundamental freedoms by adding your
signature to ours on the enclosed "Open Letter".

Sincerely yours,

AN OPEN LETTER TO] J
Attorney General of t)

J. How/mo MCGRATH
Attorney General of the United States
Washington, D. C. '”

Dear Mr. McGrath:

We write you concerning four men who are in jail. We believe that a
sober examination of the events leading to their imprisonment must
convince all honest men and women that there is involve_d here a serious
breakdown both in spirit and letter of due process of American justice.

We speak of Dr. Alphaeus Hunton, Secretary of the Council on African
Aﬁairs; Frederick V. Field, editor and writer on the Far East; Abner
Green, Executive Secretary of the Committee for the Protection of the
Foreign Born and Dashiell Hammett, author. These men have never been
accused or indicted for any crime. They have never been tried by a court
or jury and have never been ‘found guilty of any crime. Yet they have
been imprisoned without bail in violation of the Eighth Amendment
"and sentenced to prison in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

What are the facts?

These four men, Trustees of the Bail Fund of the Civil Rights Congress
of New York, were summoned before a judge who rejected the good
faith whereby the Trustees invoked their privilege of the Fifth Amend-
ment and who sentenced them for contempt of court. In the case of
Frederick Field, he has been subjected to double jeopardy in violation
of the Fifth Amendment and sentenced twice for six and three months
for the same offense. Within a period of 10 days he has been taken from
New York to Washington and back again, from Senatorial Committee
to court hearings to State Banking Commission, without regard for the
necessities of- physical energy and time to prepare‘ an adequate defense.

What was the alleged contempt for which these four men were imprisoned?

Frederick Field was not held in contempt becausehe refused to answer

questions dealing with the disappearance of the four Communist leaders
for whom the Bail Fund of the Civil Rights Congress had posted bond.

 

2 ] HOWARD McGRA TH
of the United States

This is proved by the Judge's own testimony in his certiﬁcate holding.
in Field in contempt. According to the Judge, Field testiﬁed:

He did not aid, abet, induce., arrange or have any part direct
or indirect in the disappearance of the four and has no knowl- ‘ .
edge of their present whereabouts. '

Field was held in contempt because he refused to turn over to federal
authorities the names of thousands of contributors to the Bail Fund of the '
Civil Right Congress. This Bail Fund was formed in 1946 when all
commercial surety companies refused bail _as a matter of policy and practice
to political prisoners. Those who contributed to the Fund did so in the
conviction that any and all American citizens arrested in violation of their
civil rights should have the opportunity to preparetheir defense while
released on bail-and to be considered innocent until proven guilty. They
were not willing that honest men and women who had resided in the
United States for years should be separated from’ their homes and families
and detained for want of bail when arrested in deportation proceedings.
‘They were not willing that bail should be given as a matter of course to
every procurer, dope-seller and racketeer while it was withheld from
law-abiding Americans because of their beliefs.

The Government produced no evidence and made no allegation that any
of the Trustees was connected with the disappearance of the four Com-
munist leaders. Still less did it show how the thousands of contributors to
the humanitarian purposes of the Bail Fund, whose contributions, made
over a period of four years, went into an overall fund and were not desig-
nated for any individual, could be considered even remotely responsible
for the failure of the four to surrender. A

Frederick Field and his associate Trustees refused to be- parties to the

persecution or victimization of those men and women whose support had
made the Bail Fund possible. They still maintain that position and released

the records to the Banking Commission of the State of New York only
on the basis that the names of the Bail Fund supporters‘ would be held
secret and protected. V

-Field, Hunton, Green and Harmnett, victims of the current hysteria, have
been imprisoned because -they will not have others subjected to persecution,
harassment and imprisonment, because they will not inform, because they
pleaded the Fifth Amendment which «provides that no person may be
forced to bear witness against himself. The very purpose of the Fifth
Amendment, according to the Supreme Court of the United States
(Twining  New Jersey,» 211 U.S. 91) is to act as "a safeguardagainst
heedless, unfounded and tyrannical persecutions". And that is the precise
purpose for which Field, Hammett, Hunton and Green are using it.

Because these four are not only guiltless of wrong, but are defenders of
the Bill of Rights in the best American tradition, we respectfully ask you,
sir, as Attorney General to direct your oﬂice to move to vacate the sen-'
tences of contempt against Field, Green, Human and Hammett. We
ask your concurrence in our view that in defending the Fifth Amendment
these men are defending all Americans from an arbitrary interpretation of
the law which presumes to say what Americans can avail themselves of A
the Fifth Amendments provisions and what Americans cannot.

In the hearts. of many there is a_ longing for the ‘old brave days when
Americans spoke. in clear accents as did the once jailed Thoreau who said,
"The law will never make men free; it is men who have got to make
the law free. Theyare the lovers of’ law and order who~observe the law
when the government breaks it."' I

In the name of this vital tradition which must continue, we the signers of
this letter, while we do not associate ourselves with any or all of the
general ideas of the four Trustees of the Bail Fund which are not in issue,
do support and call upon you and all Americans likewise to support the
due process of law, the right to bail, the Fifth Amendment and other
provisions of the" Bill of Rights by acting now to free- these four prisoners.

Respectfully yours,

 3.1;; V7“
