Rosenberg

Case

WAIT! DON'T THROW THE DEATH SWITCH
ARE YOU CERTAIN THE ROSENBERGS ARE GUILTY
BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT?

DOUBT No. I: Was the prosecution sincerely seeking Justice?

They heralded the calling of 113 government witnesses, but dared summon
only 23, of whom 19 were incidental “padding”. Omitted were all scientists of
repute such as Dr. Harold C. Urey who has ‘ since come out in defense of the
Rosenbergs.

(See Transcript of Court Record available at local Defense Committe

office.) /

DOUBT No. 2: Was there any concrete evidence?

With the unlimited resources of the FBI, plus 9 months to’ prepare, the

prosecution could not produce one single bit of tangible evidence linking the
Rosenbergs to espionage. There was nothing but the unsupported testimony of
the four “rewarded” witnesses. ’

No checks, no photographs, no dictaphone recordings, no documents, no
micro-film, no letters, no independent witnesses, nothing at all could be produced
linking the Rosenhergs rwith espionage.

(See Transcript, pages 14-57-1464.)

DOUBT No. 3: Were the Principle Witnesses at all Believable?

All four (Elitcher, the Greenglasses and Gold) were self-confessed per-
jurers, all standing to gain by playing along with the prosecution.
Max Elitcher: Self—accused, but let off free.
(Transcript pp. 295-296.)
' Harry Gold: Self—proclaimed spy, sentenced to 30 years, but out in 10 on
parole.
See Gold’s own testimony in U.S. vs. Brothman trial transcript.
David Greenglass: Pleaded guilty, —— but only got 15 years (out in 5 on
parole).
(See Transcript pp. 679-680.) .
Ruth Greenglass: Confessed guilt, but never even indicted and co-mpletely
free! '

(See Transcript pp. 727-728.)

"atomic weapons nor the ‘knowhow.

DOUBT No. 4: Did Their "Cloak-and-Dagger" Tale Make Sense?

Bristling with unbelievable contradictions, these four perjurers’ story contain-
ed such things as:

a. Elitcher’s claim that Rosenberg had enlisted him as a Soviet spy in 30
minutes flat. This feat all on the basis of a mere acquaintanceship of four years
earlier!

(See Transcript pp. 297-298.)

b. Go1d’s claim to be the most thoroughly-——trained and cautious spy —— yet

registering in an Albuquerque hotel to meet Greengl-ass, under his own name.
(See Transcript pp. 815-824-.)

c. David Greenglass’ claim he could remember 12 pages of scientific data
after a 6-year lapse, yet admitting he flunked “8 courses out of 8” elementary sci-
ence in the  year terms of high school he attended.

(See Transcript pp. 611-612.)
d. Ruth Greenglass’ claim that although her husband balked at becoming a
spy when she first delivered the Rosenberg’s alleged invitation to him, yet the
very next morning he spouted secret information he conveniently had right on tap.

(See Transcript pp. 682-684.)

DOUBT No. 5: Was ‘there Really an Atomic Bomb Secref?

This myth has been exploded by every reputable American Scientist and
expert on nuclear fission as follows:

a. Dr. Urey: “That it would be easier for the Soviet Union to develop the
atom bomb by themselves than to depend on spies, who would have to be accom-
plished scientists to comprehend any part of, it at all.” _, L

b. James R. Newman(Counsel—%Atomic Energy Commission) stated that:
“the general principles underlying all processes are likely to be widely known” . . .
(pp. 30-31 —- petition for clemency.) _ A

c. Dr. Roberf Oppenheimer:“That there was no basic secret concerning

7 )7

(Note: see p. 30 —— petition for clemency.)

d. Time Magazine. 3-19-51: “Some of his (Greenglass) testimony made
little scientific sense.” ,

e. Scienfific American. May, 1951 : “The Greenglass bomb is not much of a
secret.”

DOUBT No. 6: Was 1-he Jury Influencedby Spy and War Hysi-eria?

The Prosecution has been condemned by the Court of Appeals for conduct
regarded as “wholly reprehensible” in prejudicing the jury with inflammatory

press releases and statements to such an extent that, accordng to the upper court,
it was impossible for any jury to be impartial. When the upper court attempted
to sidestep the issue, on 2-18-53, Judge Learned Hand supported the defense appeal
to the Supreme Court (now pending) as follows:

“People don’t dispose of lives just because an attorney didn’t make a
point . . . You can’t undo a death sentence. There are some Justices on the Su-
preme Court on whom the conduct of the prosecuting attorney might make an
impres.sion.” (See N.Y. Times, 2-18-53.)

Incited by press, radio and prosecution releases the jury forgot the funda-
mental American tradition of the “presumption of innocence” of the accused——
and condemned the Rosenbergs as guilty long before hearing the evidence.

DOUBT No.7: Was Judge Kaufman Fair and Imparﬁal?

According to the renowned Catholic layman, Professor Stephen Love, who
as the Chairman of the Grievance Committee~Chicago Bar Assn., and Chair-
man of Character and Fitness Com. of Illinois Supreme Court, said, in speaking
to Harvard Law students, “There were over 100 instances when the presiding
Judge . . . interjected himself into the proceedings, and even helped out a govern-
ment witness and made small of a defense witness. Judge Kaufman was not clari-
fying things. jHe was, I could say, putting things in the witness’ mouth.”

When the jury commenced deliberations and requested “the testimony of
Ruth Greenglass” — Judge Kaufman arbitrarily refused to include in this request
the cross—examination of the Defense but had read to them only the Prosecution’s
version of her testimony. -

DOUT Na. 8: Was {he Charge Acifuallyj Treason?

The U. S. Constitution expressly protects all Americans from wild charges of
“treason” by requiring 2 independent witnesses. The Prosecution did not even
have ONE honest independent witness, therefore resorted toyithe loose devise of
charging the Rosenbergs, not with treason, not with espionage — but with only

conspiracy to comit espionage- . -

This is a far cry from the criminally irresponsible charges of “Traitorous
Americans” and “Treasonable Acts” by the prosecution. (P. 183-184. Rosenberg
transcript.) ' 

Although the Espionage Statute includes the important phrase: “to the injury
of the US.” — this portion of the statute was completely omitted from the indict-
ment against the Rosenbergs. ' V '

Despite these facts virtually the entire press, the Prosecution and even high
public officials have cultivated the deception in the minds of the American pub-

l-ic~—the damning idea that the Rosenbergs had been tried and convicted for Trea-
son!

HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO FACE SUCH A "DAY
IN COURT"?

Despite the world-wide plea for clemency by all kinds of fair—minded per-
sons there has been an almost one—sided campaign of deception that ONLY THE
REDS ARE WITH THE ROSENBERGS.

The newspapers try to sound a warning that any one who dares to ask for
mercy, any one who airs his doubts becomes by that action a spy just as “traitor-
ous” as the Rosenbergs.

Isn’t this exactly the objective of the Rosenberg Case?
What they are saying is: Do Not Dare To Speak Up ——
Do Not Dare to Question What We Do — or else

You Too May Follow The Rosenbergs.

BUT WORLD OPINION SAYS —- NO!

The following are some of the World Figures who advocate
clemency:

Pope Pius XII
Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver

Dr. Bernard Loomer, representing 2300 Protestant ministers appealing
to Pres. Eisenhower. ‘

Judge Hubert T. Delany, noted Negro jurist

Mrs. Mary Church_ Terrell — world-famous Negro leader
Dr. Albert Einstein

Dr. Harold C. Urey

Charles Raven — chaplain to the Queen of England
Chief Justice James Wolfe — Utah Supreme Court

What about the responsible New York Times —— Feb. 22. 1953 re-
porting. as the

"Top ISSUE IN FRANCE"

"There are many persons otherwise hostile to the Communist Party who not
only oppose the sentence but find that the evidence presented did not even justify
(l conviction.”

From Holy:

"How widespread the feeling is may be gauged from the fact that even the
right-wing press says the Rosenbergs should be PﬂRDONED . . . ” ". . . because
even many anti—Communists feel that the evidencefailed to prove beyond a shad-
ow of doubt that the Rosenbergs were guilty.”

What you can do — who'|- you MUST do:
1. Do not permit yourself to be silenced.

2. Help bring these facts to your neighbors, friends, and relatives.

3. You can help spread the truth. Simply go to your own minister, rabbi,
union leader, club or fraternal order. Ask them to help break through this con-
spiracy.

4. Call the local Committee and secure availabe material and the true facts,
Read them and pass them on to your friends.

5. Above all — act now before it is too late. The Rosenbergs have only a
few more weeks of life — unless you act now!

6. Write to Pres. Eisenhower or wire him to reconsider his decision.
