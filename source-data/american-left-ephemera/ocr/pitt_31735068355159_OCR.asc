For a Federal Safety "Law with Teeth

     
 

International
Officers

Later this year, the Bureau
of Mines will wind up its safe-
ty and health surveys. The
Secretary of Interior then is
required, under the Metal and
Nonmetallic Mines Act of
1961, to report to Congress
whatthe surveys have found.
With this report, the Secre-
tary is to include recommen-
dations for needed permanent
federal legislation in this field.
What the Bureau of
Mines has uncovered in the
past year should be an eye-
opener for the Interior De-
partment a11d Congress.
at * ‘k

EARLY every mine under
contract with Mine-Mill
has been surveyed this past
year, and reports of these sur-
veys have been sent to every

local concerned, and to the‘

Executive Board member in

glwhose district’ the surveys ‘

have been made.

These reports contain
recommendations for safety
improvements which the
U. S. Bureau of Mines at
present has NO power to
enforce.

Some mining companies are
making a show of cooperation
with the Bureau of Mines by
correcting the conditions
pointed out in the reports.
Other companies, as follow-up
survey reports show, are ig-
noring the Bureau’s safety
recommendations.

Here’s where local union
health and safety committees
can step in and play an indis-
pensable role for safety now.
State mine inspectors, for all
the defects of the laws and
codes they operate under,
have some limited powers to
enforce safety conditions if
they choose to use them.

Won’t follow clear-cut safe-
ty recommendations, local

unions should demand that
state mine inspectors step
in and see that they are fol-
lowed.

We all know that the state
mine inspectors in many cases
Won’t do anything. They will
plead lack of funds; they will
delay; they may say they lack
authority; they may. say the
U. S. Bureau of Mines is all
wet. Anything to avoid action.

But even if this happens,
the local union that demands
action and doesn’t get it is
building a record. This record
will be mighty important
about a year from now when
Congressional committee
hearings are held to consider
the Secretary of the Interior’s
recommendations on mine
safety legislation.

If we are going to get a
Federal Mine Safety Law
one of the important things
we’re going to have to show
is the complete inadequacy
of our state mine safety
laws and their administra-

tion.
‘A’ ‘k ~k

HE International Union is

compiling the most com-
prehensive record on mine
safety ever undertaken by a
Union in any industry.

Only you can get the re-
ports of mine accidents that
the International office
needs. Only you can give
the U. S. safety engineers
the detailed information
they are seeking about con-
ditions on your job. Only‘
you can tell us what the
state mine inspectors are
doing or not doing.

The National office cannot
do this job alone. To sit back
and say, let Denver carry the
load is just not facing up to
the facts. Only you can pro-
vide the complete and detailed
information on safety we
need.

Union Files for Benefits A

3 ,  
l Under Trade Act of 1962

Mine-Mill was the first Union in the country to file
a petition with the U. S. Tariff Commission to qualify
laid-off workers for special federal unemployment bene-
fits under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

‘This was done early in January on behalf of 126

workers who were laid off when New J ersey.Zinc Com- - “ I

pany closed its mine and mill at Hanover, New Mexico,
because of excessive imports of zinc concentrates and
slab. They belong to Amalgamated Bayard District Union,

Local .890.

Under the Trade Expansion Act which became law
last October, workers laid off because of increased imports

are eligible to apply for federal
unemployment benefits of 65
percent of their weekly pay, but
not more than 65 percent of
average U. S. factory wages.
This puts a ceiling of a little
more than $60 on weekly bene-

fits.
~k * *

THE BENEFITS are payable
for up to one year, or longer
for workers over 60 years old
or for those in approved re-
training programs. Also pro-
vided under the program are
retraining courses and reim-
bursement to family heads for

1 expenses of moving to new

jobs.

To qualify for benefits, the
Tariff Commission must first
make a finding that the work-
ers lost their jobs because of
increased imports of commodi-
ties like those produced by their
employer, and that the in-
creased imports resulted main-
ly from reductions in tariffs
granted by the U. S. govern-
ment under international trade
agreements.

*‘k*

PRESIDENT John Clark
pointed out as the petition was
filed "that tariff duties on zinc
since 1951 have been substan-
tially less than half the duties
laid down in the basic Tariff
Act of 1930. Clark said: “We
maintain that these tariff reduc-
tions are at the root of the dif-
ficulties which have forced the
closing of this mine.” He added
that imports of zinc over the
last four years have been dou-
ble the quantities imported in
the years before the latest re-
duction in tariffs took place in
1951. ‘

Under the Trade Expansion
law, the Tariff Commission has
60 days from the date of the
filing of the petition to investi-
gate and report to the Presi-
dent. If its report on the peti-
tion is favorable, the President
may then certify the laid-off
workers as eligible to apply for
assistance. The Secretary of
Labor, acting through state un-
employment compensation of-
fices, will then receive applica-
tions from unemployed work-

ers. .
‘k ‘k ‘A’

TO BE ELIGIBLE, individual
workers must have been em-
ployed for 18 months out of the
three years before the layoff,
and have worked for six months
out of the last year for an em-
ployer adversely affected by
imports.

If eligible, workers may re-
ceive unemployment benefits,
less any state benefits received,

Another First I 
For Mine-Mill .

Upon learning t h a t
Mine-Mill was the first
Union to file for "benefits
under the Trade Expan-
sion Act, old—timers re-
called another “first”
scored by this organiza-
tion. This was the negotia-
tion of collar-to-collar pay‘
clauses in our contracts,
based upon provisions of
the F a i r Employment
Practices Act of the 1930’s.
Our example was followed
by the United Mine Work-
ers, who called it “portal-
to-portal” pay, and then
by many other Unions.

retroactively to the time of the A

layoff.

Some of the laid-off miners at
Hanover have obtained tempo-
rary jobs working for the U. S.
Forest Service in the nearby
national forest. Through the ef-
forts of Local 890 and Butte
Miners Local No. 1, the Ana-

_conda Company, which is hir-

ing hard rock ‘miners for the

Butte mines, has sent a repre-

sentative to Hanover to inter-
view applicants for jobs. Those

accepted by the Anaconda Com- _ I

pany, if Mine-Mill’s petition is
granted, may receive retroac-

tive benefits for the time they

were unemployed, and family
heads may be reimbursed for
expenses of moving to the new

Job.
* * *

WORKERS whose jobs are
threatened by increased im-
ports need not wait until laid
off. Petitions may be filed on
behalf of such workers prior to
layoff, in order to qualify them,
in advance, if possible, for fed-

-eral benefits. In all cases, how-

ever, increased imports result-
ing from tariff reductions grant-
ed by the U. S. government
must be established as the ma-
jor factor threatening the work-
ers’ jobs.

THE MINE-MIL-L UNION

  

iFebriiiEiiry_':.‘  

 

SUPERIOR, Ariz.—How to get better mine safety
laws, improved workmen’s compensation, unemployment
compensation and silicosis legislation——these were the
major subjects of discussion at the January meeting of
the Arizona Mine-Mill Council.

The Council is also pushing for a joint resolution for
e_stablishment of a committee of the legislature to make a

mine safety study looking to-
ward revision of the present
state mining codes.

Superior Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers Local 938 was
host to the 30-some delegates
from ten local unions and five
ladies auxiliaries.

NAACP Speaker

Guest speaker was Cross Lan-
der, a vice president of the
Arizona section of the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People. He spoke of
the widespread knowledge of
Mine-Mill’s contribution to recog-
nition of Negro leadership in the
person of Int’l Vice President
Asbury Howard. He urged that
our union in Arizona join in the
struggle for equal job oppor-
tunities for Negroes.

The Council discussed the ques-
tion of a full time person being
assigned to Phoenix during the
legislative session. Request for
payment for such full time per-
son was made to the Inter-
national Union, with the dele-
gates recognizing that the new
percapita tax carried last year
was not yet received by the

4 International Union.

Barraza Backs Defense

Board Member M. R. Barraza
addressed the Council. He em-
phasized the fact that support
of the International Union De-
fense Fund means strengthening
our position in relation to the
companies and in our legislative
work. He urged the members
to make individual contributions
for Defense in addition to those
of the local unions and auxili-
aries. '

this Union is not Commu-

1955.

 Too

Taxcut Will Be
Little, Too Late

WASHINGTON—President Kennedy’s, major pro-

and too late wheniit comes.

1 posal for domestic legislation—a tax cut—will be too little

The original Administration idea was a substantial

7. .' dc/ut, retroactive to the first of this year, affecting almost
;everyone—a cut big enough to produce a boom in con-

sumer spending and to lift the economy out of its stagna-

. tion.

But the word is now that a new tax bill will not be

‘ii.-Tfit won’t measure up to the size

 

iiidfprojected in the

  

President’s
5message; that there will be
more “relief” for corporations
_than for individuals.

The President’s message

" called for another boost in mili-

tary spending, which undoubted-
ly will go through. He soft-
pedalled domestic issues such
as medicare—-issues which have
no chance of passage without
strong Administration backing.

*~k*

MORE AND MORE anti-union
bills are dropping into the hop-
per. Likewise, McClellan and
‘others are maintaining a steady
drumfire for action’ by this Con-

’ grass. The key demand calls

for placing unions under the

Xanti-trust laws, starting with the
~ transportation unions.

These beginnings reflect the
initial moves in a long-range,
national campaign being pushed
by the NAM and other employer
groups. Unions would be well
advised to get on the move and
‘start fighting back.

7 Un-American Committee

WASHINGTON—At the open-
ing" of Congress, 80 some mem-
bers of the House had indicated
a willingness to register opposi-
tion to the Un-American Activi-
ties Committee. While this is a
minor faction of the House
membership it is nevertheless
a growing one. It represents a
change of historic importance
from the days when only a
handful had the courage to chal-
lenge the latter-day McCarthys.

A move to take on the HUAC
on opening day was blocked by
the House leadership. Four
‘members—-James Roosevelt (D,
Calif.), William Fitts Ryan (D,
N.Y.), John V. Lindsay (R,
N.Y.) and Leonard Farbstein

A Ja'.cted upon before July, and will take effect in 1964; that

(D, N.Y.) were ready to tee off
against HUAC.

Roosevelt later introduced a
resolution, H. Res. 69, which
would transfer HUAC’s jurisdic-
tion to the Judiciary Committee.
The new subcommittee would
have power to deal solely with
overt acts, not with thought con-
trol, exposure and persecution.

The first step, and a big one,
will be to push Roosevelt’s reso-
lution through the Rules com-
mittee.

Meantime, the head of the
Un-American committee, Rep.
Francis E. Walter (D, Pa.) in-
troduced 11 bills affecting civil
liberties.

SPRINGDALE, Conn.-Negro

VANCOUVER, B. C.-—
Convention delegates cele-

L brating “Twenty years of

. working

Progress” of the Western
District Union of Mine-Mill

lwarned the raiding Steel

union that if its leadership
moved into British Colum-
bia “they will meet the
same fate as in their past
raids when we drove them

i  out of this District.”
“If they haven’t learned from~

past experience,” said the Of-
ficers’ Report, delivered by Dis-
trict President Harvey Murphy,
“we will take them on again
and the men and women who
administered the previous de-
feat will smash them again. And

' we serve notice to the em-

ployers that they can expect no
let-up in our fight for wages and
conditions while we
are dealing with these labour
fakers and scoundrels.”

THE CONVENTION attracted
60 delegates and some 20 ob-

"the strong ties which weld the

Among the main questions
facing the delegates was that
of automation in the mining in-
dustry, especially in open ‘pit
operations. New methods and

‘equipment are eliminating man-

hours and in a ten-year period

THE CONVENTION urged

Negro History Week (February 10 to 16 this year)
traditionally is an occasion to recall the historic struggles
of the Negro people in this country and elsewhere, their
contributions to the economies and cultures into which

they , have been transplanted.

A lot of Negro history has been lived in the last two
decades, some of which has been summarized and brought
into focus very sharply and skillfully by an outstanding

writer. Appropriately, th e
occasion was a talk deliv-
ered in the South by best-
selling novelist James Bald-
win. He spoke to a mixed
audience of a- thousand in
the Duke Auditorium of
North Carolina College at
Durham. He received tumul-
tuous applause and was
give a standing ovation. His
topic was “The South’s
Need for a New Leader-
ship.”

Turning Poinf

World War II, Baldwin said,
was a turning point in the rela-
tionships between Negroes and
whites in this country, and set
the stage for the young Negro
leadership now coming to the
fore.

Earlier, he said, under a pa-
ternalistic system of leadership
by which Negro and white
leaders “negotiated,” unex-
pressed hatreds and lack of
mutual respect developed. The
tensions this set up created a
bitterness was passed on from
generation to generation, he
said, “which is part of the
. . . chaos which menaces us
today.”

World War II, however, he
declared, brought a critical
change in these relationships.
“It was a shock to be forced to
recognize that a war which was
fought as they said, to destroy
the racial doctrines of Hitler,
was being fought on a racial
level——that the Japanese were,
according to American doctrine,
‘yellow-bellied J aps’ . . .”

No Status Quo

“There was something de-
moralizing about this. It forced

one to realize that the world was '

bigger than the United States . . .

V It taught that one could not trust ‘

a people who could on one hand
talk about the crimes of Hitler
and on the other hand condemn
the Japanese in racial terms
and keep you in your place at
no-matter-what-you-do ex-
pense.”

As a consequence, he contin-

ued, children born during the’

war and post-war years had a
larger margin of economic se-

 

 

curity (because of the war and
post-war booms). “Also the . . .
intransigence t h e ir fa th e 1' s
brought home with them had
something to do with the way
they raised their children.”

Changes

In the meantime, Baldwin con-
tended, something began called
“the cold war,” and this caused
Americans to examine what they
were doing and to realize that
other people were watching their
actions. Certain changes then
began to occur, he declared.

“. . . Perhaps I read the evi-
dence from a certain jaundiced
point of view,” he asserted, “but

. . . I don’t see anything . . . to

-make me feel that the 1954 Su-

preme Court decision outlawing
desegregation in the schools had
really to do with the determina-
tion to bring about desegrega-
tion, or really to change but
mainly -— principally - to assure

the rest of the World that we-

were not racists.”

“That’s the way I read it,”
he said. “Even if I'm wrong,
that's the way all black people
in the world read it and there’s
scarcely anything—there’s noth-
ing, as far as I can tell—-to con-
tradict that point of view.”

Today's Leaders

In today’s young leaders, he
continued, “we are now con-
fronted with a whole generation
of young Negroes who stand on
the ground or the height of
achievement bequeathed by their
ancestors who never saw this
world, the world in which we
move now, but who somehow
inculcated in their sons and their
daughters a sense of dignity and

to anybody.’_’

 

 

 

"We now have a whole generafion of young Negroes ‘
who have never said ‘yes sir’ fo anybody" '

A b o u t misrepresentations in _

American history, he declared:

“We have lied about something,

so long that everyone has come
to believe it . . . We’ve come to
believe that somehow we are a
separate race—the Negro a sep-
arate race from the whi—te.peo-
ple-—and we’ve lied about the
fact that we’re brothers and

and cousins and have been for
400 years.”

MACON, Ga. — Workers in
Mine-Mill’s most recently or-.
ganized plant,

last month to win their first con-
tract from the anti-union Diver-

sey Corp. It came after a long -

period of stalling by the com-
pany. \

For the first time,‘ these
workers will enjoy paid vaca-
tions——one week after one year’s
service and two weeks after
five years. The contract “ also
provides for six paid holidays
as well as a general wage in-
crease of 5 cents an hour plus
increment increases of 3 to 7
cents an hour for some em-
ployees.

Under the agreement there
will be another general wage in-
crease of 6 cents an hour on
September 1 of this year plus

increments of 3 to 5 cents be-,

tween grades——and another 4
cents onsthe same date in 1964.

Mine-Mill won an electionat‘
this plant last September to de-
feat the company’s long-drawn
out anti-union campaign.

The Negotiating Committee

was led by Reg. Dir. Jesse Dos- .

ter, who had directed the or-
ganizing campaign at Diversey.

NEWMONT MINING COMPANY, giant New York based hold-
ing company with interests in numerous U. S. and foreign non-
ferrous mining, smelting and refining companies valued at about
$113 million, is in trouble with U. S. Department of Justice. In a
civil anti-trust suit filed last month, the government asked the
New York federal District Court to order Newmont to dispose of
its stock holdings in Magma Copper Company and Phelps Dodge
Corporation.

The government also asked the court to order members of
Newmont’s board of directors to resign from the boards of Magma
and PD. All three companies were namedas defendants, as well
as the following four officers: H

Plato Malozemoff, president and director of Newmont and a
director of Magma;

Roy C. Bonebrake, vice-president, director and general counsel
of Newmont and board chairman and general counsel of Magma;

Franz Schneider and Kenneth L. Isaacs, both directors of New-
mont and'Phelps Dodge. _

Newmont has been buying Magma shares since 1928 and now
owns 80.6 percent of its common stock. The government said
Newmontowns about 3 percent of PD’s common stock and is one of
the largest stockholders in PD. The government’s suit charged
violations of the anti-merger and interlocking ‘directorates provi-
sions of the Clayton Anti-Trust law. ’

* ~* *

MAGMA COPPER announced a Christmas present for its stock-
holders just before the holidays. It has paid no cash dividends since
1949, and under terms of a U. S. government loan presently out-
standing at $57 million, it has had to give priority to making in-
terest payments and repayments on the loan. Now it plans to bor-
row from a non-government lender to pay off the government loan.

If this goes through, the company says it will give all stock-
holders three shares of stock in exchange for every share they now
hold, and will resume paying cash dividends. These two actions
should give ‘a hefty boost to the price of Magma’s stock in Wall
Street. Stockholders who want to cash in ontheir stockholdings at
a profit will be in a position to do so; for those who want to hold
on, 1963 will be sweetened with a gentle rain of dividend checks.
Happy New Year!

ST. JOSEPH LEAD CO. mines in Missouri struck by Steel-
workers since July, 27, were still down at Mine-Mill Union press
time. Union and company negotiators have been meeting behind
closed doors in recent weeks. Trade sources report the parties
still far apart.

Meanwhile, economic pressure on St. Joe mounts. The company
was reported over a month ago by Wall Street Journal as “for
all practical purposes out of the market as a seller.” By all ac-
counts, the strikers are standing firm, determined to win a sub-
stantial settlement from a hard-bargaining company.

AMERICAN METAL CLIMAX zinc smelter at Blackwell, Okla.,

Wage gains included an immediate 10 cents an hour across the

board, 5 cents more effective July 15, 1963, and 5 cents effective
July 15, 1964. Also included were increases in shift differentials,
Saturday and Sunday premium pay, health and accident benefits

and pension benefits.

 

Several job reclassifications were won, and the settlement
provided that strike time would be counted as time worked for
pension credits, vacation and seniority. -

in both Chile and Peru, the misery and desperation of mine,
mill and smelter workers has grown so intense in recent months

that government has felt impelled to intervene and hel
concessions from the toreign-owned companies.

Chile

Workers at Kennecott’s Chil-
ean subsidiary, Braden_Copper
Company, have been engaged
in a running hassle over foot-
dragging by the company in
living up to an agreement to
share company profits with the
workers. The company offered
a token payment and said it

"would take nearly six months

to figure out how much the
profit for 1962 was.

Workers turned down a prof-
fered Christmas bonus and
threatened a strike. They
brought the Chilean Finance
minister into the picture. At
Mine-Mill Union press time, he
was quoted as saying he ex-
pected to have a full report on
actual 1962 Braden profits in
a matter of days. The Unions
then agreed to postpone the
strike, providing the govern-
ment participate in negotia-
tions to follow.

Peru

Workers employed by Cerro
de Pasco Mining Corporation,
big Peruvian lead-zinc-silver
producer, returned to work
early last month, after a strike
which closed all the company’s
mines and reduction plants in
December and idled 13,000.

Violence at the company’s
La Oroya smelter caused prop-
erty damage assessed at $4
million. The company saidonly

about 60 percent of the work-

ers could be taken back, pend- —

ing repairs to the smelter, ex-
pected to take about two
months.

A factor in the settlement was
a government decree boosting
pay for all workers by‘8 per-
cent.

‘Rhodesia

“Unconstitutional” strikes, to
use a phrase coined by the big
mining companies, continued to
break out at copper producing
facilities in Rhodesia last
month. Last month this column
reported strikes at Rhokana,
Mufulira and Roan Antelope
mines. 2

Ndola copper refinery was
struck from December 17 to
January 2. 4,500 miners struck
at Nchanga mine on January 2
and 1,400 struck at Chibulama

work at both properties on
January 15. These two walk-
outs were caused by arrest of

Coal Miners Say NO . ., . New Uses for Plastic

Tubing . . . More Dope from Bureau of Mines

A thousand coal miners, members of United Mine Workers at Carmichaels, Pa.,
refused to return towork last month until determination of the cause of an explosion
that killed 37 miners December _6 at U. S. Steel's Robena mine.

i U. S. Steel said stateand federal authorities had given permission to reopen shafts

not‘ affected by the blast, but the

mineworkers wouldn’t buy this.
They said one of the shafts to
be. reopened had an explosion
last October killing two men
and injuring two others". State
authorities had not yet begun
hearings on the disaster at the
time the miners were asked to
return to work. -

PLASTIC TUBING is in the’;
news as an adjunct to ammoni- .

um nitrate blasting at both open
pit and underground non-ferrous
metal mines.

At the Bingham Canyon open
pit mine in Utah, the problem

I .of dampness in drill holes-at

certain mine locations has aris-
en since the use of dynamite

‘7“7Yand gelamite explosives has

largely given way to ammonium
nitrate, which dissolves readily
in water. To meet this problem
at Bingham Canyon, plastic tub-
ing is used to line the rotary

drill holes in which the powder

is placed-—thus protecting it

. from contact with moisture.

. Another plastic application is
in so-called “water stemming

many years in-European mines.

These tubes, coming in sizes to -

fit various size underground
bore holes, and generally 15 to
18 inches in length, are self-
sealing after being filled with
water.

They are pushed into the bore
hole after’ loading, until they

proved for use in coal mines by

ACM's Kelley Mine 7

ANACONDA’s Kelley mine in Butte was surveyed recently by
the U._ S. Bureau of Mines. The Health and Safety Engineer’s

report, based on seven days work in the mine, listed 21 safety

improvements completed during the survey. Among these were:
0 The locomotive trolley pole was removed from the trolley
wire at two locations on the 1300 level where the-locomotive was
left unattended. '
O The slab of rock in the 1631-35E stope was barred down.
0 The vent tubing in D1645-I-Dr. N .W. was extended to Within
-30 feet of the working face.
0 The open space in the curtain between the pan feeder and
the belt picker’s platform at the 1400 loading station was covered.
Tyhirtyitwo safety recommendations were _listed in the report,
including the following:
0 Bridle chains or safety ropes should be installed on the
man cages.
0 An overwind limit switch should be installed on the hoist on
the 600 level of the Mountain View shaft. .
0 Broken ladder rungs in the 2007-23W stope and 2020-I-27SE
stope should be repaired.
O Taillights should be installed on mine trains.
O A step should be mounted on the rear car of the train for
use by the swamper. I
0 Man trains should be pulled.
0 Wooden head boards should not be used with rock bolts
installed in permanent openings and travelways.
0 Loose rock should be barred down or supported properly.
I Vent tubing which contains holes or torn sections should be
repaired or replaced.
' O The connecting joints of vent tubing should be fitted tightly.

.lnspirafion's Christmas Mine

INSPIRATION COPPER’S new Christmas mine in Gila County,
Arizona, was surveyed last November, after operations were well
under way. Despite the newness of the mine, presumably in-
corporating the best and newest in safety features and practices,
the Bureau of Mines report listed a total of 32 safety recommenda-
tions. These included the following:

0 All belt drives, gear drives, drive couplings, and drive
shafts located within 7 feet of the floor or platform should be
guarded . .<. A limit chain and belt guard should be installed on
the cutoff. saw in the timber-framing area.

0 All oil-storage barrels should be equipped with drip pans or
drain-back, pumps. , s

O The 13-163 battery-charging station should bemoved to an
untimberedlocation or the present locations shouldvbe fireproofed.

O Trips containing explosives should always be pulled, never
pushed. . .

0 Powder and detonators should be transported separately to
working places’ . . . Blasting lines should be shorted out at the
blasting-switch'"end when not in use . . . Blasting lines, should be
hung on the opposite side of the drift from electric power cables
and lines. * ' . ._ _

O Pneumatic overshot mucking machines should be equipped
with safety valves. Locomotives should be provided with efficient
headlights and audible warning devices. ‘

O Ventilationtubing should be extended to within 30 feet of the
working faces and should be kept in good repair. . . Hand-held
electric power tools should be frame-grounded.

of an Officers and Stewards meeting of San Manuel Mine,
Mill & Smelter Local‘ 937. ‘ .
The Local Union distributed a leaflet exposing the

role of the Arizona Industrial Commission andrftlie-_

“hide-and-seek” method of the
mining companies to obscure
the actual picture of severity of
accidents. (See quotes from the
leaflet, at right.)

THE ARIZONA Industrial
Commission is under fire for
its handling of compensation
cases and its delay of appeals,
subjecting employees to un-
bearable loss of income and
unreasonable settlements.

One legislator from the

TO HELP in bringing infor-
mation on this situation to the
people of this area, Local 937
sponsored an open meeting at
the San Manuel High School on
January 25, with Jack Cum-
mard, outgoing Chairman of
the Arizona Industrial Commis-
sion as speaker. Arrangements
for the meeting were made by

ot file their injury with the
Commission. The employer.
saves insurance premium. He
saves Commission costs and
the company doesn’t have to
pay any claims to the in-
jured employee.

Severe accidents are_ re-
duced to “no lost time” ac-
cidents when the company

“no lost time” accidents are"

Accidents in Arizona are
hidden from the Bureau of
Mines because the Commis-
sion won’t give out the in-

safety engineer last August 6. His report, summarized in this 7

column in the October issue, listed 40 recommendations for im-
provement of health and safety conditions. A follow-up survey

was made December 10-11. The report of the follow-up shows that -

the company had failed to act in carrying out 24 of the 40 recom-
mendations made last August. Among“ the safety recommenda-
tions the company had not carried out were:

0 All belt drives, gear drives, drive couplings, drive shafts,
and conveyorbelts within 7 feet of the floor or a platform, should
be guarded.

0 All mechanically operated grinding wheels on stationary
bases should be equipped with suitable guards, which cover both

the sides and peripheries of the wheels in such a manner that no .

more than a 90-degree segment of each wheel is ‘exposed.
O A bumper block should be provided at the coarse-ore bin,
to prevent trucks or payloaders from entering it.

C The locomotive-battery chargers located on the 700 and 800 -'

stations should be moved to untimbered sections, or the installa-
tions should be made fire-resistive.

. O Lubricating-or drilling-oil barrels should be equipped with 

drip pans or drain-back pumps.

0 The 700-level ‘explosive magazine should be relocated at
least 200 feet from the shaft and any active workings and at least
25 feet from haulageways or travelways.

O The top of 88-60 raise should be fenced off or lagged. over, to

prevent a person from accidentally falling into it.

0 Locomotive headlights should be maintained in good operat-
ing condition.

O The switchboard on the 800 station should be fenced, so
that men and materials cannot come into contact with switches
or wiring.
