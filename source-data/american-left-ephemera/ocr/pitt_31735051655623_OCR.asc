THE PRESENT DISAFFECTION IN LOS ANGELES CORE

i.

Earl L. Walter, Chairman Emeritus

Having served as chairman of L.A. CORE for the past twelve years, we view the.
present -- what we choose to call —- disaffection and subsequent splintering as a
usual occurrence which has happened several times before in CORE's short-history.‘
We suspect all similar organizations have to go through the same process in their
development.- The differenne in respect to CORE presently is that in the past .
problems of this kind were small and un—noticeable, as CORE in the past was small.‘
Moreover CORE is one of the leaders in the present Civil Rights Revolution, the most.
significant occurrence in this_country in our time, and hence everything we do takes

Von added significance —— and rightly so. But basically the problem is the same in- ;.s

ternal one we have been surviving and overcoming-all the time and is principally «
related to growth and development. We have referred to the phenomenal growth of CORE
in past commentaries, and to the influx of large numbers of persons with varied
motivations, some of which (and we think these are few) are not basically related
to the civil rights struggle.. In the past, CORE has been traditionally composed
of a small group of very dedicated and highly disciplined individuals who understood,
and accepted the moral integrity of the movement. Of late it would appear that if
we have had in addition to these, more than our-share of the dissident elements,j
the malcontents and the "I can do anything better than you" types. Fortunately they
have been woefully outnumbered, and group feelings have served to maintain the moral
integrity which is,the.essence of our strength. 1

A second way in which the hazards of growth are manifested can be observed in

4,noting the group's attitude towards action rather than talk or discussion. Formerly
‘ there was so much talk, talk, talk by everybody else and so little action that we‘

were compelled to cry out persistantly_for action because we saw the crying need.

'And this cry was attractive to the young, the new and the adventuresome. And the

cry has been heeded at its face value. But we are discovering now that such a cry,

’especially to the uninitiated, can lead very easily to the other extreme, where

there is action, action, action, with no thought or planning or even goals. 0b— ,
viously both extremes are at best nebulous and sometimes disastrous.

,In addition the revolution itself has had its effect on the group. For as the
groups has helped to shape the revolution, the revolution.has helped to shape the T
group. The high points and the low points, the stresses and the strains challenge
the stability_of individuals, and thesed.forces surely effect the stability of the,
group which is composed of individuals; Tension is created that is meant to be
constructively channelbd; but the hazards of destruction are necessarily there

W’ also. Not every one of us in the movement has outgrown that conditioning which

makes heroes out of the real villain in terms of human behavior. »If we are not’ _
fully committed to nonviolence, in a period of tension it is quite easy for us to

_become perpetrators of hostility rather than victims, and thus to lose the advantages

that the philosophy offers. _ -

Despite the hazrds we have mentioned the group most decidedly has maintained

, its stability and moved.steadily forward holding on to its moral integrity.‘ Witness

the recent annual elections in CORE. In these elections an overwhelming majority
supported a point of view which recognized the need to push full speed ahead with dig
rect nonviolent»action —— but well-planned, reasoned action, in the spirit of good will,
and calculated to involve the largest possible portion of the entire community.” This
direction has been recognized as the demand of the revolution itself in the present
era. Our sense of responsibility should insist that we do no less than meet this ‘

demand. an
t The movement will go on and fortunately we in CORE intend to move with it. Frankly

we feel that the pulling out of the small number -— some 20 or 30 —— will have a
positive effect. whatever positive contribution they can make to the overall effort
on their own will be applauded by us. Moreover they will discover their possibilities
or limitations as the case might be without any hampering by us. On the other_hand we.
can without.being.hampered by them pursue the new direction we envision. ANeitherL
will bring a discredit‘to the other. Surely the problem is serious and ominous_§nbugh_

A for many‘varied”approaches.

.~ Our conviction, however, is that the most meaningful contribution can be made in,

‘the direction which has been outlined by the new administration headed by Art Silvers,

and the key of which is in going out from door to door talking individually with the

a people where the most pressing problems are, as a means of discovering their greatest
A concerns and working with them towards dealing with these problems.’ The hope is to

expand the activities and program toward total community involvement as a resource for

w the large and massive assault on the more complex.and serious prcblems of de facto

school segregation, full employment, and open occupancy in housing. The arsenal needed
for this assault necessarily must involve the entire community and move in the direction
of the general strike, boycott, or work stoppage. ' ’ A _

The success of this assault and the forward movement of the revolution will depend
on the abilities of those of us actively involved to_readjust, guide and amass the
forces available to us. Intelligent foresight and our ability to think clearly about
the issues will carefully measure our success." For ourjstrong moral position, as has
been stated before, and our ability to think, is §h§7advantage_we can gain over the_
adversary. . A ‘ ” * ' “A . -

But the real issues in our opinion go much further than defeating the adversary]
for merely to exchange behavior patterns would only restate the problem .by rearranging

'4the factors and shifting one group to another side of the formula.g This; we submit,.,,..
we have had enough of in the past. It is basically the cause of our unhappy predicament/

As Baldwin has stated it, the oppression and dominance of one human being over another.
\always has been and always will be a recipe for murder: f
The need now is for growth, change, and development. The arena in which we have

~been operating has been filled with violence, fear and hostility. We have no_choice H

but to change this by our own example in exhibiting a more human type of behavior.

Anything less than that is not worth all the suffering that has already been experienced,"

to say nothing of.what needs to”be faced ih3the future. Our society, our culture, needs
a better behaving human being. wweishould accept our responsibility in_creating this_ ._
being.. The problems of our societyfare the responsibility of all of us, including the
oppressed, and should be shared as such. with this approach we shculd feellmore shame
than fear, more guilt than hate.v It is in this direction that we.must move if a better
human being is to emerge. 'e?-- “ '= _ ~:-h : - - _ ;_ __ . ‘,; -

' CChhlS ANSWER TO~RECEhT KNX EhITORIALS REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA’ ht‘
..REAL ESTATE ASSOCIATION"S INITIATIVE ATTEMPT- — ‘ ‘"7 ~«' =“%

Art Silvers, Chairman, LaA.'CORE J

In two recent.editorials, KNX has expressed approval of the effort of the Calif
fornia Real Estate Association to force a vote to repeal the Rumford Act.; KNX argues
that the people of California¢have.a right to vote on this issue and accuses Governf
of Bfqﬁn and others of "fighting a move to let the public havedits‘say". ', .1‘

.CCRE.COnten3S‘that.Fhe people have already voted on this issue through their _
elected representatives. ~In fact, we believe that in a democratic republic the en-
actment of legislation is best left to the legislative bodies which, under parlia-
mentary procedures, can weigh a proposed measure objectively, on the basis of factual
debate. But when the public is asked to vote directly on legislation, objectivity
is practically impossible. In the heat of a political campaign, proponents tend to
rely on emotional slogans and victory is likely to go to the side with the most money
to spend for public relations experts.

If opponents of the Rumford Act believe that it is unconstitutional, they can
easily test it in the courts. CORE would welcome a court test of the bill as an
action in the public interest. '

KNX accuses "spokesmen of minority groups" of threatening violence on this
issue. We know of no such threats. However, we feel that this effort by the Real
Estate Association is designed to stir up antagonism. In seeking to repeal the
Rumford Act, the CREA is actually trying to restore to certain realtors, builders
and lenders the privilege of engaging in open discrimination on the basis of race,

“.religion, or national origin. This is annopenly racist goal, and to achieve their

aim, the CREA must inevitably make use of racist arguments directed to those who
harbor feelings of racial hatred and bigotry. And inevitably, the minority people
who are the target of this hatred will react with fear and resentment. The result
can only be increased tension.

The CREA not onlyyproposes to revoke this long overdue step forward in the
field of housing, but seeks to destroy other rights as well. For instance, their
proposed amendment would permanently prevent the state from taking any action to curb
discrimination in housing and it would also open a door for the return of restrictive
covenants, by allowing such restrictions even to be inserted in wills. we believe ,
that repeal of the Rumford Act would set a precedent which wpuld endanger all other
civil rights protections including those in employment and public accommodation.

KNX complains because the Rumford Act, in their words, "penalizes a property
owner who discriminates against a would—be purchaser on the basis of race or color."
While this is roughly what the Act provides, in COREVS opinion it actually doesn't
go far enough, since the Act does not apply to individual home owners or to apartment
properties of three units or less. And we would emphasize what the Act does 393 do.
It does not restrict an owner's right to set whatever price he wishes, or restrict
his right to refuse a buyer who is a poor risk or of bad character.

The bill places only one restriction on certain owners of property who are in
the business of selling or renting housing -— that they do not make race or color or
ethnic origin a basis for refusing to deal with a customer.

KNX suggests that "choice of housing" is not a basic liberty but is only a fringe
issue. CORE is surprised that a business enterprise such as KNX would ascribe so
little importance to the right of every citizen, whatever his income, to have free
access to the marketplace, in order to enjoy the full benefits of free exchange and
competition. Shouldn't every citizen have the right to use his money the best way
he knows how? Yet through discrimination, minority citizens are denied this right.
By limiting their choice of goods and services, the value of their money is reduced,
and this is especially true in the field of housing where the supply available to
minority people falls far below the demand.

KNX is concerned that the "rights of the majority" are threatened by civil rights
advances. By "majority" does KNX refer to the California Real Estate Association?
Surely this organization is a minority group, and a small minority at that, since
they cannot even speak for all of their members. CORE is pleased that many realtors,
more than 500 in this area and a two to one majority in San Francisco and Palo Alto
have found the courage to oppose the CREA and to support the Rumford Act. And we
believe that there are hundreds more who would speak out, except that they fear re-
taliation by CREA.

The California Real Estate Association, according to the complaints of realtors
who oppose the initiative, in its campaign against them, as well as in its campaign
to turn back the ad vance in civil rights, is very similar to those Southern governors
and lawmakers who twist and turn and engage in endless legal maneuvering, trying to
circumvent the decisions of the Supreme Court.

But CORE hopes that the voters of this state will not be susceptible to this

demagoguery; If you favor equality and_justice, you have already expressed yourself
on this issue of fair housing through your state representatives. Therefore, there
is no need for you to sign the CREA initiative petition. Only those voters should
sign who want to keep our cities segregated, who.want to separate children in segre-
gated schools, who do not believe that every American is entitled to the equal pro-
tection of our laws.

CORE believes that if the majority of the people of California act on the basis
of conscience, they will surely reject this initiative so that we will be able to
set_a precedent by demonstrating to this Nation and to the world that California
wants to live in peace and brotherhood with all citizens.

‘f'f,we further believe that KNX radio, having come forward to editorialize on this
initiative, should not do so on the grounds of an impartial observer. CORE feels
that KNX has a moral obligation to its listeners to take a stand on this question
openly and frankly so that we may all better judge.its position.
