The conference overwhelmingly supported proposals for carry-
ing on permament activities for disarmament, and projected a still
larger conference for next autumn. Mrs. Robert Maynard, ex-
ecutive director of the Illinois division of the American Associa-
tion for the United Nations, one of the organizers of the Con-

, ference, was elected continuations chairman.

Among the original sponsoring associations and those which
subsequently joined in the movement, in addition to the AAUN,
are the following: The Atomic Scientists of Chicago, the Church
Federation of Greater Chicago, the American Friends Service
Committee, the Board of World Peace of the Methodist Church,
the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs, the National
Council of Jewish Women, the Women’s International League for
Peace and Freedom, the Y.W.C.A., the American Jewish Con-
gress, the Chicago Ethical Culture Society, the United World
Federalists. Also, the Cook County CIO, the Hadassah, the Chi-
cago Religious Liberals, the American Baptist Convention, the
Brethren Service Commission, the B’nai B’rith Women’s Council,
and other local CIO and AFL groups.

The release early in May of the Soviet and Western proposals
on arms reduction and on prohibition of nuclear weapons under
strict international control and inspection, showed East—West view-
points on this question closer than ever before. The far-reaching

. new Soviet concessions on the level of armed forces and on control

and inspection measures, raised new hopes of what might be accom-
plished in future negotiations.

On May 25, Harold E. Stassen, recently appointed as Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s special assistant for disarmament, told the Na-
tional PTA Convention in Chicago:

Americans do want peace. My office has been deluged with mail, re- —

vealing dramatically that people from every walk of life are‘ thinking

about, writing about, and talking about peace. . . . The American people
believe something can be done about the current arms race for military
supremacy.

(New York Herald Tribune, May 26)

A positive contribution to the question of the peaceful uses
of atomic energy was made by America’s oldest liberal magazine,
The Nation, in devoting its special 90th anniversary issue of
]me 18, and a dinner celebration addressed by distinguished speak-
ers, to the question of “Atoms for Peace.” 9

On July 9, the voice of the great and gentle genius and humani-
tarian, Albert Einstein, came to us from beyond the grave, in the

8

 

peace call he had initiated with British philosopher Bertrand Russell
before his death. The appeal of eight world renowned scientists,
seven of them Nobel prize winners, called for an end of war as
suicidal for all in the H-bomb age, and stressed the importance of
preliminary steps for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Other
American signers were Prof. Percy W. Bridgman, physicist, of
Harvard University; Prof. Herman  Muller, geneticist, of Indiana
University, subsequently joined by Dr. Linus Pauling, chemist, of
the California Institute of Technology.

This was followed on July 19 by an appeal of eighteen Nobel
prize winners for Chemistry at their annual meeting in Mainau,
Germany, urging all countries to renounce force as an instrument of
national policy. U.S. signers included Dr. Arthur H. Compton of
St. Louis, Dr. Fritz Lippmann of Boston, and Dr. W. M. Stanley
of Berkeley, California.

The conscience of America, as responsible for initiating the era
of atom war, was aroused anew around the tenth anniversary of
the dropping of the A-bomb on Hiroshima, August 6. On August 3,

‘a statement was published in the New York Times calling for re-

pentance of this act, recognition that no people has the right to
drop such weapons on any other, and urging that the power of love
be substituted for the power of force. The statement was initiated
by the Fellowship of Reconciliation and signed by 40 clergymen,
educators and others.

A Hiroshima Commemorative Committee, headed by Rev. Guy
Emery Shipler, editor of The Churchman, and backed by a com-
mittee of distinguished sponsors, held a mass meeting in New York’s
Carnegie Hall, August 10, dedicated to keeping the world free
from annihilation by H-bombs.

This swelling sentiment for arms reduction and prohibition
of nuclear war led to the directives issued by the Geneva Conference
that the foreign ministers should discuss this question when they
meet in October, and for a meeting August 29 in New York of the
sub-committee of the UN Disarmament Commission. Both Presi-
dent Eisenhower and Premier Bulganin have announced that each
would consider control and inspection plans proposed by the other,
giving rise to new hopes for agreement. '

The historic “Atoms for Peace” conference held in Geneva in
August, resulting from President Eisenhower’s initiative, focussed
American and world attention on the breathtaking potentialities of
cooperation for peaceful uses of the atom in place of competition
in its use for annihilation.

The Crisis in the Formosa Strait

The haste with which Congress adopted the resolution giving
the President authority to -use U.S. armed forces in defense of
Formosa and the Pescadores—which Secretary Dulles admitted
could be construed as a “pre-dated declaration of war”—prevented
full public realization of the implications of this move at the
time. But as soon as the war-now advocates in the Pentagon,
such as Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Chairman U.S. Joint Chiefs
of Staff, and Admiral Robert B. Carney, Chief of Naval Operations
(since replaced), and the China Lobby Senators such as Know-
land, Bridges, ]enner, and McCarthy, began their pressure for
atomic war against the mainland of China over Quemoy and
Matsu islands, wide public protests arose.

This led to the introduction of the Morse-Lehman resolution
(S. 21) against U.S. military intervention on behalf of Chiang
Kai-shek’s possession of these islands, which won tremendous

popular support. While the resolution endorsed the Administration.

policy of defending Formosa under the treaty with Chiang Kai-
shek, it also opened the way for future consideration of its status.

The Bandung Conference bringing together government rep-
resentatives of 29 African and Asian nations made a tremendous
impact on American public opinion. It brought home the desires
of the governments and peoples of Africa and Asia to determine
their own way of life free from any outside interference and all
forms of colonialism and imperialism, and to live in peace with
all nations, and showed their ability to compose any differences
and reach agreed decisions on a course of peaceful coexistence.

The conciliatory attitude of Chinese Premier and Foreign Min-
ister Chou En—lai, and his offer of bilateral negotiations with our
country “to settle the question of relaxing and eliminating the ten-
sion” in the Formosa area, gave new impetus to the demand for a
peaceful settlement with People’s China.

As the danger of war over Quemoy and Matsu islands was at its
height, the Americans for Democratic Action, of which Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt is Honorary National Chairman, iniﬁated a
telegram to President Eisenhower in which 47 ADA members
and others joined in urging him to make clear that the United
States would not go to war over these islands, described as “in-
separable from the mainland of China.”

' Although “wholeheartedly” endorsing the defense of Formosa
and the Pescadores, the appeal acknowledged that the status of

10

 

 

Formosa was a moot question, urging that “the future ‘status

of Formosa should be determined by international agreement,
without the use of force, and with due regard to the wishes
of the Formosa people.”

Live and Let Live was the heading that appeared over another
peace appeal signed by ﬁfty prominent Americans, published
as an advertisement in the New York Times of April 19, and later
circulated as a petition in briefer form. The signers urged upon
our government a foreign policy accepting the fact of differing
systems existing side by side. The group proposed recognition of
Quemoy and Matsu islands as part of the China mainland, and
that the issue of the permanent status of Formosa and the Pes-
cadores be submitted to the United Nations; informal negotiations
with the People’s Republic of China as a ﬁrst step toward its recog-
nition as the legitimate government of China, and support of its
admission to the UN; international outlawry of nuclear weapons.

Further illustrations of the tremendous public furor aroused over
the issue of military intervention in the Formosa Strait will appear
in later sections. While any attempt to cover expressions of pub-
lications on peace issues is beyond the scope of this pamphlet,
special mention should be made of I. F. Stone’s Weekly, one of the
most valuable sources of information on pending legislation and
foreign policy trends in Washington. Mr. Stone carried on a special
crusade on behalf of the Morse—Lehman resolution.

This intense public pressure, the conciliatory efforts of UN Sec-
retary Dag Hammerskjold and India’s Krishna Menon, the release
by the Chinese People’s Government of the imprisoned airmen and
the new spirit generated at Geneva, led to direct American-Chinese
negotiations on the Ambassadorial level, and the hope that they will
be followed by a still higher level conference.

Negotiations, Peaceful Coexistence and Trade

Questions of big-power negotiations, peaceful coexistence and
trade with the socialist world have long had a central place in the
peace demands of the people. Yet the Administration held to
the position that negotiations with the Soviet Union could only
be successful if carried on from “positions of strength.” It thus
rejected both the demands of the people and its allies, and the nu-
merous overtures made by the Soviet Union in this direction, until
it was able to get the ratiﬁcation of the Paris Pacts for the rearm-

11

-—.,— —-,,—--—-:»,?:,x_v:—_—-.:~.:

 

   

ing of Western Germany and the entrance of Western Germany
into NATO completed.

There has been less popular pressure around the rearming of
West Germany than on other peace issues, due to the long-time
incessant propaganda about its being a necessary “defense against
Soviet aggression,” and lack of publicity about the NATO decision
to base all its planning on atomic weapons, which would mean
putting such weapons in the hands of former Nazi generals.

But the reports of the massive opposition to a new German Wehr-

macht on the part of the people of Europe, including those of West
Germany itself, and the determined peace moves of the USSR,
raised questions in the minds of many people as to the wisdom of
the Paris Pacts and the continued division of Europe into two armed
cam s. .
'lBhe first factor in this was the initiative of the Soviet Govem-
ment in reaching agreement with Austria on the terms of a State
Treaty with the ending of military occupation, guaranteeing of
real independence for Austria, and guarding against its being
drawn into any military coalition, which led to the successful
negotiations in Vienna and the ﬁnal signing of the treaty. The
establishment of a free and independent Austria, pledged to neu-
trality, pointed the way to the possibility of similar negotia-
tions for a uniﬁed and peaceful Germany, despite the completion
of the ratiﬁcation of the Paris Pacts and the entrance of West
Germany into NATO. That such negotiations remained open
was made clear when the Warsaw conference of the Soviet Union
and its Eastern European allies to set up a counter organization
to NATO, provided for the dissolution of their own mutual defense
treaty in the event an all-European Security System should be
formed, and While agreeing on a uniﬁed command for their armed
forces, postponed any action regarding the inclusion of armed
forces of the German Democratic Republic.

The next move was the Soviet proposal for the establishment
of diplomatic, trade and cultural relations with the German Fed-
eral Republic, as a step which would “help in the solution of the
main problem in which the German people are interested, restora-
tion of the unity of Germany.”

The visit of Soviet Party and Government leaders to Belgrade,
and the resulting Soviet-Yugoslav agreement on peaceful coexist-
ence and mutual c ration, was further strong evidence of the
determination of the USSR to ease tensions and improve relations
in all directions, as were the negotiations (still in progress at this

12

 

 

writing) between the USSR and Japan, and the warm reception
given to Premier Nehru of India on his visit in June.

All these and other factors taken together, along with the mighty
popular demand laid a basis for the Geneva conference.

a It was not to be expected that an easy solution to the German
problem could be found after the years of division. The important
point was that the directive to the foreign ministers provided for
continued negotiations on all the proposals presented. These in-
cluded the U.S. proposal for a uniﬁed, rearmed Germany that would
be expected to be a part of NATO, with agreements on level 0-f
armaments and security agreements between East and West mili-
tary alliances; the Soviet proposal for an all—European security sys-
tem, including the United States, in which in the first stages both
German Republics would participate, creating conditions for a
uniﬁed Germany to enter later, when the all-European system
would replace existing East and West military alliances; and the
mid-way Eden proposal for a partial European security system.
The USSR made an important concession in accepting the con-
tinuance of NATO in the ﬁrst stage, with a non—aggression pact
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact adherents. Both sides adopted
a conciliatory position in agreeing to link together the problems of
German reuniﬁcation and European security in the forthcoming
negotiations, the West having originally insisted that uniﬁcation
must come ﬁrst, the USSR that the security system must take
precedence.

Peaceful coexistence presupposes the development of normal
trade relations.

Despite the efforts of those groups who want war alarums to
justify a big arms program, it is clear that the new trend toward
negotiations could not have taken place without the backing of
dominant. big business elements who have been compelled to
recognize that they have more to gain from peaceful trade than
from a war of annihilation.

Among business representatives who earlier faced this realit
is Ernest T. Weir, Pittsburgh industrialist, and chairman of the
National Steel Corporation. Mr. Weir has published a number
of pamphlets urging peaceful coexistence and trade. His trips to
Western Europe have convinced him that the people there have
no fear of Soviet aggression.

Mr. Weir told the Cleveland Engineering Society in a speech
last December, that the future of American capitalism depends
on opening trade channels with the socialist world. He said that

the determination of people everywhere to improve their ways of
life “can be a tremendous constructive force . . . leading to eco-
nomic activity, trade and general prosperity on the world level
far beyond anything known in the past,” and declared that his ob-
servations in. Western Europe last summer convinced him that the
basis for this exists:

The objective of the countries of Western Europe—every country—is
peace, not war. . . . Europe believes peace is possible and it is convinced
that the people of Communist countries are just as strongly opposed to
war as the people of the Western World. And because ofathat, Western
Europe believes that a way can be worked out to live with Russia and
China on a basis of peace.

Discussing the possibilities of peaceful competition between
different ideolo ies and s stems of overnment, Weir declared:
8 Y 8
And it is also the idea that as art of this competition, we should
promote to the greatest extent ossib e interrelatons between the Commu-

nist World and the Free Wor d—including trade relations as one of the
most important elements.

On ]anuary 10 of this year forty-seven leading Americans made
public a program submitted to President Eisenhower and Congress,
urging that restrictions on trade with Communist nations be re-
moved for a limited category of goods which “would clearly
have a substantial adverse effect upon our military position.” The
program was submitted by Louis H. Pink, chairman of the Citizens
Conference for International Economic Union. (Mr. Pink, who
died on May 18, was formerly New York State Superintendent
of Insurance.) It proposed the setting up of a world trade agency
open to all major trading nations and supported by the United
Nations, with the aim of “greater economic cooperation between
us and our allies and greater economic tolerance between the
East and the West.”

On May 16, Warren Lee Pierson,’ chairman of the board of
Trans-World Airlines, and chief of the 110-member U.S. delegation
at the International Chamber of Commerce meeting in Tokyo, de-
clared that he favored expanded trade throughout the world,
including that with Communist-led nations, adding that trade
with the latter should be in non-strategic goods. The statement
was made at a press conference attended by some thousand top
business executives from 42 nations. Mr. Pierson said he favored
the “greatest possible expansion of trade in any direction, including
trade through the iron curtain.”

According to the dispatch in the New York Times (May 17):

14

 

 

The question of increased trade with Communist areas arose because
of apan’s special interest in this problem. Japanese leaders, conservative
an socialist alike, have said ]apan would like to sell more to and buy
more from Red China.

These growing pressures for East-West trade were reflected in
the discussions at Geneva, and in the directives to the foreign\min-
isters to study all measures which could “bring about a progressive
elimination of barriers which interfere with free communications and
peaceful trade between peoples.” President Eisenhower on his
return stressed the importance of trade in peaceful goods in im-
proving the conditons of life for our own people. He declared:
“If trade is to reach its maximum capabilities in this regard it
must be both voluminous and world-wide.”

Opposition to Universal Military Training

The question of Universal Military Training has for many years
aroused vigorous opposition among widely varying groups of the
American people, as contrary to American democratic traditions
and leading to the further militarization of American life. For this
reason every attempt to put through any form of UMT since 1944
has been decisively defeated.

Opposition mounted during the war with Korea, when General
Lewis B. Hershey, National Director of Selective Service, de-
clared that it is necessary for America to bring up a “generation of
young killers.” It has grown as parents have seen the effect of the
military spirt on the youth in the growth of juvenile delinquency.

Recognition of this opposition has compelled the Adminis-
tration to seek methods of putting across UMT in some other
guise. Thus this year’s Administration measure introduced into
Congress provided that if the necessary number of young people
did not volunteer for military service, they could be drafted for
a six-months training period, following which they would be in
the reserves for seven and a half years.

This bill aroused massive popular opposition. In February
the National’ Council Against Conscription issued a pamphlet
urging that it be defeated to save traditional American freedoms.
The N.C.A.C. has very substantial popular support throughout
the country. Its officers are Rev. Harry Emerson F osdick, pastor
emeritus of the Riverside Church in New York; Alonzo F. Meyers,
head of the Department of Education, New York University;

15

 

  

President Francis X. N. McGuire of Villanova University; Prof.
George Butterick of Harvard University; and Rabbi Elias Charry
of Philadelphia.

On March 3 the General Board of the National Council of
Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. (representing 35,000,000 U.S.
Protestants and Eastern Orthodox members) reaffirmed its oppo-
sition to permanent Universal Military Training.

The American Civil Liberties Union announced its opposition
to the proposed bill, declaring “it would create a spirit of militarism
hostile to democratic liberties.”  ‘T

The ﬂood of protests received from their constituents caused
many members of Congress to oppose the bill. As a result of this
popular and Congressional opposition, the bill was somewhat
modiﬁed. But the opposition continued to the bill (HR 5297), as
opening the way to UMT.

On May 3, the CIO urged all members of the House of Repre-
sentatives to vote against it. Mr. L. S. Buckmaster, president of
the CIO Rubber Workers Union and chairman of the CIO Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, urged opposition in spite of the
changes “because there is need for neither compulsory reserve pro-
gram nor the initiation of a partial universal military training
system.”

On ]une 1, the United Mine Workers’ Ioumal charged the
“military brass hats and their stooges” with trying to sneak a
“wolf-in-sheep’s clothing universal miliary training bill through
Congress” and declared that the UMWA is opposed to UMT
under any name.

Sentiment among farmers has been overwhelmingly against
UMT in any form, as expressed in letters, resolutions and peti-
-tions pouring in to Congress from farm people. Rural churches,
women’s and youth groups have been especially active in their
opposition. ~ ' ,

On record against UMT are the American Farm Bureau Fed-
eration, the National Grange and the National Farmers’ Union
as well as many state farm organizations.

Among youth and educational organizations which have spoken
out against UMT are the National Conference of Methodist Youth,
the Students for Democratic Action, the American Association
of School Administrators, the United Christian Youth Movement,
the National Education Association, the American Association of
Colleges and the Labor Youth League.

Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, who unsuccessfully sought

16

 

l

 

to introduce a rider to the UMT Bill to‘ eliminate segregation in the
National Guard, reported the receipt of 4,000 letters both support-
ing his View and opposing UMT altogether. These included nu-
merous expressions from Negro and white church and religious
groups. Many thousands of letters opposing UMT went to other
Congressmen, the President and the Pentagon.

All this opposition led to further modiﬁcations in the Armed
Forces Reserves Bill as ﬁnally passed by Congress, which none-

theless is still regarded by these same groups as opening the way _

to UMT. ,

Aside from these speciﬁc issues, it should be noted that a com-
mon denominator in the peace sentiments and actions of many
groups has long been the hope that the United Nations would in
time be restored to its original function of maintaining interna-
tional peace, and a growing recognition that this means univer-
sality of membership for all nations ready to uphold its charter.
This found particular expression in connection with the Tenth
Anniversary session in San Francisco in June, 1955, when groups
from all over the United States directed appeals to it on many
issues relating to peace, and West Coast trade union, religious and
other groups took an active part in the celebrations.

This public support of the United Nations was recognized
by President Eisenhower in his address at the opening session
in San Francisco when he reaiﬁrmed the support of ourcountry
for its purposes and aims. The President declared:

‘We shall work with all others-and especially through this great
organization, the United N ations—so that peaceful and reasonable
negotiations may replace the clash of the battleﬁeld.”

LABOR AND PEACE

Workers, rank and ﬁle trade union members, are providing
solid support in all activities for peace. Yet it must be recorded
that as far as oﬂicial trade union expressions and actions for peace
are concerned, the real interests of the workers have not had ade-
quate expression. National Conventions of the CIO have, it is
true, reflected in their resolutions the growing sentiment for peace-
ful coexistence. The resolution of the December, 1954 convention
attacked Senator Knowland _“for policies and actions that would
lead directly to offensive war against the govermnent of Red

17

 

 

  

China” and warned that “If the Administration should compro-
mise with the Knowlands, it shall meet our instant and forthright
opposition.”

But for the most part top AFL and CIO leaders have supported
pro-war policies on the basis that the big armaments program
means jobs, an attitude that has also affected many workers.

Today there are signs that the realization is growing both in
the ranks and leadership of labor that atomic warfare would bring
destruction ﬁrst of all to America’s industrial communities, that the
only solid basis for continuing full employment and prosperity
and life itself is peace and trade with all the nations of the world,
and that a peacetime economy is the best guarantee of jobs.

It was symptomatic of this new realization that at the convention
of the United Auto Workers in March, at Cleveland, President
Walter Reuther coupled the guaranteed annual wage program with
the need for peace, calling it “an important move in achieving
full production and full employment in peacetime.” In his statement
to the convention, Reuther declared:

Why can’t we have full employment in peacetime? We ask a simple
question and we demand an answer to this question. If we can have full
employment in war why can’t we have full employment in peace making
the good things of life? We can. We have the know-how and we have
the manpower. All that we need to demonstrate is that we have the courage
and will. That is precisely the element that we intend to supply in increas-
ing measure at the bargaining table in 1955. . . .

What good is a higher wage if our great cities are in ashes? What is
the future of our children unless mankind ﬁnds a way to prevent the use
of these terrible weapons of destruction? Nobody can win a war fought
with atomic H-bombs and therefore what we need to realize is that we
can win only if we ﬁnd a way to avoid a war.

. On April 27, Reuther told the convention of the CIO Paper
Workers in Detroit that the ﬁght for peace is the most important
issue today. He declared: “We must change the shape of the
struggle going on now that can only end in war,” and that this
could be accomplished if the billions of dollars now being spent by
the government for arms could be converted to peacetime goods
and needs, housing and schools and education.

Highly signiﬁcant, too, was the fact that the AFL felt com-
pelled to withdraw an executive council statement made public May
6, which had opposed bilateral negotiations with People’s China,
recommended by implication military defense of Quemoy and
Matsu islands, and proposed an economic blockade of Peking.
The explanation was that the statement had been a rough draft,

18

 

 

released in error. VVhile the revised statement advocated a tough
line toward Peking and support of the Formosa regime, it said
that the status of Quemoy and Matsu islands should be determined
“solely from the viewpoint of the vital interests and strategic
needs of all the free peoples of the world.”

Some of the national leaders and publications of both AFL and
CIO unions have taken a more positive stand on peace issues
during the past year, and especially since Geneva.

After the elections last November, President Ralph Helstein
of the CIO United Packinghouse Workers in an article in the
union’s paper warned the Democrats that “they had better ﬁnd
a way of making clear to the American people that they are not the
‘War party,’ and that instead of merely pointing to warmongers
like Senator Knowland in Republican circles, they must ﬁnd a posi-
itve approach to world peace as an alternative to the shifting
Republican policy.” The Packinghouse Worker spoke up against
the Formosa resolution at the time of its passage.

In the November, 1954 issue of The Butcher Workman, Earl
E. Jamerson, President of the AFL Amalgamated Meat Cutters and
Butcher Workmen of North America and Patrick E. Gorman,
secretary-treasurer of the union, attacked the aggressive anti-Soviet
attitude of AFL President George Meany, declaring that accept-
ance of his View that coexistence with the USSR is impossible
would mean that “another world war is inevitable.” The Butcher
Workman restated its stand for co-existence among all nations
in its June 1955 issue. This union’s position in favor of peaceful
coexistence was supported by the AFL Hotel and Restaurant
Workers and the AFL Catering Industry Employees.

On February 1, 1955, Labor’s Daily, published by the AFL
International Typographical Union, praised the Senators who
voted against the Formosa resolution, and warned against the
dangers of preventive war.

In its March issue, Textile Labor, organ of the CIO Textile
Workers, carried an editorial proposing that instead of taking the
attitude that war is inevitable, it is more logical to assume that it
is unthinkable, and that this would carry with it the obligation
to expand East-West trade as the best guarantee of the world’s
economic health.

The May, 1955 issue of Labor, organ of the railroad workers
unions, which had previously reported favorably on the Morse-
Lehman resolution against intervention over Quemoy and Matsu,
declared that “conciliatory moves” by China and the Soviet Union

IQ

 

 

 

had sent “a wave of hesitant hope throughout the world.”

At a policy conference of the CIO United Packinghouse Work-
ers in Chicago on May 15, the delegates hailed the coming Big-Four
meeting and called for an end to the cold war. A report linking
peace with full employment was unanimously supported. It in-
cluded the aims of urging the U.S. Government to enter upon con-
tinuous negotiations for universal disarmament, to negotiate with
China on the Formosa issue. ~

The progressive unions expelled by the CIO have long been
in the forefront of the struggle for peace but have recently had to
spend their main efforts in ﬁghting for their existence against the
repressive legislation designed to destroy them.

At the 50th annual convention of the International Mine, Mill
and Smelter Workers’ Union of the United States and Canada,
in mid-March in Spokane, Washington, the general resolution,‘
along with economic and social demands, placed strong emphasis
on the question of peace. It reafﬁrmed the union’s three point
program for world peace, including negotiations among the major
powers; agreements leading to disarmament and outlawing of
weapons of mass destruction; removing the artiﬁcial barriers to trade
with all countries.

The International Lo'ngshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union
has consistently sup-ported all issues furthering peace and h:ade.

In a special resolution on World Peace adopted at its Eleventh
Biennial Convention at Long Beach, California, early in April,

the union pledged:

]ust as the ILWU threw itself into World War II without qualiﬁcation
and without stint until victory had been won, so we must throw our
resources into the ﬁght for peace today—for the duration and until peace
has been achieved.

The ILWU declared its support of all proposals from any

‘source that can contribute to the lessening of international tensions,

and reafﬁrmed the peace principles of its 1953 convention, which in-
cluded: top level negotiations, outlawry of A- and H-bombs, end
of economic blockades and establishment of free trade through-
out the world, free interchange of information, delegations and
individuals among all countries.

The quashing by the ]udge of the government’s ﬁfth attempt
to deport the union’s President, Harry Bridges, may be seen in part
as a domestic reflection of the new spirit engendered at Geneva.

As Geneva approached, a number of labor ofﬁcials and papers
spoke out for its support. A late ]une issue of the National Maritime

20

 

 

Union (CIO) organ, Pilot, carried an editorial suggesting that the
Big Four might ﬁnd the way to develop trade between the United
States and the USSR and China.

On july 21, Labofs Daily carried a front page story suggesting
to U.S. trade unonists that an exchange of labor delegates would get
“an enthusiastic reception” in the Soviet Union, based on an inter-
view by its correspondent with a member of the Soviet agricultural
group visiting Iowa. It is highly unfortunate that AFL President
George Meany and the AFL Executive Committee have seen ﬁt to
express their opposition to such an exchange. A number of AFL
and CIO organizations have expressed support of the idea.

On ]uly 27, Advance, organ of the Amalgamated Clothing Work-
ers, CIO, reprinted the Einstein-Russell statement and stressed
labo‘r’s long concern “for the quest for peace and an end to war.”

The unity and strength to be derived from the forthcoming
CIO-AF L merger should provide new opportunities for labor to
play a decisive role in determining policies of peace, provided the
Meany policies are not permitted to prevail.

RELIGIOUS GROUPS

VVhile too often leading church bodies and spokesmen have
lent their support to war preparations and building up “situa-

tions of strength” as the way to peace, and have gone against

their own religious precepts in supporting what were actually war-
like policies and the hate-Russia and hate-China campaigns, it is
also true that religious groups and individuals have been increas-
ingly in the forefront in initiating and supporting peace actions.
Protestant, Catholic and ]ewish leaders have joined together or
with others in many recent peace expressions and activities. Inter-
denominational conferences on peace issues have been held in many
communities. Individual clergymen of different denominations have
made their churches and synagogues centers of peace activity.
Negro churchmen are prominent in all work for peace.

Among Protestant churches practically every major denornina-
tion has expanded or set up a department devoted to peace educa-
tion and action, under one name or another, and encouraged the
formation of parish or regional committees for peace.

Although the Catholic hierarchy and leading laymen have
given active support to war-breeding policies, Catholic priests and
laymen are also to be found in increasing numbers among peace

21

 

   

supporters. The Christmas peace message of Pope Pius XII, and
his powerful Easter plea against the horrors of nuclear weapons
undoubtedly served as a stimulus for greater peace activity among
Catholics.

Among inter-faith groups working toward peace is the long
established Church Peace Union, with world ties, of which Dr.
Ralph Sockman is President, Rabbi Philip S. Bernstein, Vice-
President and Dr. Henry A. Atkinson General Secretary. VVhile
supporting the Administration in policies of building “defensive
military strength,” this organization has made a point of especially
commending the President for positive statements in relation to
opposing preventive war, ending international tensions and seek-
ing a modus vivendi with the USSR. In a letter to the President
on April 1, the group proposed the setting up of a Commission
on Competitive Coexistence to bring together “a group of our ablest
and most eminent citizens to study intensively how America can
help avert total war, how we can make a policy of competitive
coexistence contribute, on a long range continuing basis‘, to the
growth of a more just and freer world in which civilization as we
know it can survive.”

On May 4, a group of 88 Protestant, Catholic and Jewish lead-
ers launched “an all-out crusade to employ the God-given abund-
ance of America in an expanded program of world development,
human progress and international peace,” at a meeting in New
York. The statement called for “complete separation of U.S.
economic and technical aid from programs of military aid, for full
use of private, non-governmental agencies in trade, aid and tech-
nical assistanceprograms, and for maximum use of UN agencies”
to minimize suspicions of nationalistic or imperialistic motivation
on the part of the United States. It urged “an expanding peacetime
economy and equitable distribution of the national product” and
“international trade and monetary policies designed to facilitate and
expand the international flow of goods and services.”

Work for peace in Protestant circles was given strong impetus
by the two-week Assembly of the World Council of Churches held
at Evanston, Illinois, in the summer of 1954. The Assembly,
attended by 600 clergymen and thousands of visitors, made a fer-
vent appeal for a fresh start among governments and people that
would lead to enduring peace. Their main resolution on peace called
for “living together in a divided world” on the basis of renuncia-
tion of force as an instrument of foreign policy and continuing
effort to reach agreement." The Assembly went on record for arms

22

 

 

reduction and the prohibition of atomic, hydrogen and all other
weapons of mass destruction and called on all nations to pledge
to refrain from use or threat of nuclear warfare.

Subsequently a number of U.S. Protestant bodies have reviewed
the Evanston ﬁndings and passed their own resolutions along simi-
lar lines, and numerous local peace programs have been built
around them.

On March 31, The National Council of the Churches of Christ,
representing 35,000,000 American Protestants, appealed to President
Eisenhower to take “all honorable steps” to end the crisis over the
Formosa Strait peaceably, to resist advisors advocating measures
leading to world war, and urged the fullest use of all facilities for
negotiations, through the UN or other means. The appeal de-
clared: “The Chinese Communist regime is a force in being. We
believe negotiation is the most practical means for seeking solu-
tions consistent with principle.”

This appeal was sent out by the Council’s Department of In-
ternational Affairs, and signed by Dr. Eugene Carson Blake, presi-
dent; The Hon. Ernest A. Cross (former U.S. Ambassador to the
UN), chairman; and the Rev. Walter W. Van Kirk, executive
director. ,

The National Council of Churches has a division of United
Church Women actively engaged in peace activities through its
Department of Christian World Relations.

The annual meeting of the United States Conference for the
World Council of Churches at Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania, early
in May, heard recommendations designed to bring about a cease-
ﬁre in the Formosa Strait by Dr. 0. Frederick Nolde, director of
the Commission of the Churches on International Affairs.

The program he advocated, according to the New York Herald
Tribune, May 7, included bi-lateral consultations with Chinese
Premier Chou En-lai; diligent search for a cease-ﬁre; efforts to
achieve the principle of universal membership in the United Na-
tions; an objective study of Formosa by an impartial agency, pref-
erably the United Nations. These proposals were sent to United
Nations heads and to Secretary Dulles.

The Methodist Church, with 9,500,000 members, takes an active
stand for peace. The official Board of World Peace of the Metho-
dist Church (headquarters in Chicago) of 'Which Rev. Charles
F. Boss, ]r., is executive secretary, does not specify the peace
issues on which action should be taken, but calls for registering
opinion for peace with the Administration and Congressional lead-

23

 

  
  

ers. Its booklet Register Christian Opinion, a Congressional Di-
rectory to Aid in Legislative Action in 1955, urges:

Act for peace wherever you are; in the women’s groups, service or civic
clubs; store, factory or oﬁice; real estate association or labor union;
wherever you stand, stand for policies of peace.

The booklet tells people it is their responsibility to affect the
future course of events. It emphasizes the eﬂicacy of prayer, but
stresses also the necessity of making opinions felt by those who
makelnational policy, and lists all members of Congress.

The Women’s Division of the Christian Service of the Metho-
dist Church, representing 2,000,000 church women in all parts
of the country, speaks out on many peace issues.

On April 2, the Oregon Chapter of the Methodist Federation
for Social Action, an independent organization, sent an airmail
letter to all 531 Senators and Representatives expressing concern
over the drift toward war in the Chinese-Fonnosa area, deploring
U.S. policy in propping up the regimes of corrupt dictators, and
urged recall of the U.S. Seventh ' Fleet and all military and in-
telligence personnel from Formosa and the off-shore islands. The
national MFSA issues a monthly Social Questions Bulletin which
constantly calls on its membership for peace action.

Among the Baptists, the American Baptist Convention (North-
ern) has a program of peace education and action under the Coun-
cil on Christian Social Progress. At its annual meetings the Ameri-
can Baptist Convention has consistently passed resolutions to keep
the channels of communication open between opposing countries,
and particularly between the United States and the Soviet Union
to the end that through negotiations there could come about some
reconciliation and settlement of differences.

On May 5, Dr. V. Carney Hargroves, then President of the
Convention, announced that Russian Baptists with the approval
of their government, had invited a group of American Baptists
to visit the USSR this summer. The group left early in August.
It represented both Northern and Southern Baptist groups, and
included Dr.  S. ]ackson, President of the National Baptist Con-
vention, a Negro Baptist Church of nearly 4,500,000 members.

On May 20, 9,000 delegates to the Southern Baptist Conven-
tion meeting in Miami, Florida (representing 8,000,000 Baptists)
commended President Eisenhower for his “patient diplomatic con-
duct.” At the same time, they directed a series of peace recom-
mendations to “the political leaders of the nation.” These included

24

 

 

strong opposition to “preventive war” programs; criticism of any
effort to impose UMT; approval of continued participation in the
UN; and immediate efforts toward effective agreements outlawing
atomic armaments and radically reducing armaments. (New York
Times, May 21.)

The Congregational Christian Churches have a Department of
International Relations Committee, of which Rev. Herman F.
Reissig is director, under its Council for Social Action, which
regularly publishes educational material on peace issues, and
study and action sheets.

The Council for Social Action on February 13 made a state-
ment urging rejection of the Knowland proposal to withdraw
the United States from the UN if it admitted the People’s Re-
public of China. While stating that it did not endorse the Whole
program of the Eisenhower Administration, it announced support
of the President on such points as being a “good partner,” rejec-
tion of preventive war, rejection of the proposal to blockade the
China Coast, rejection of the idea that this country would never
recognize the Peking Government, and support of the United Na-
tions as a multilateral agency for peace.

At the Protestant Episcopal National Council meeting, April
27-28, members unanimously requested the Presiding Bishop of
the Church, the Rt. Rev. Henry Knox Sherrill, to inform the Presi-
dent of the United States of their support of “direct negotiations
with Communist China” for a “cease-ﬁre in the Formosa Strait.”

On May 24, 900 voting delegates at the 167th General Assem-
bly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. at Los Angeles, Cal.,
passed a resolution calling for “prohibition of all weapons of
mass destruction, including atomic and hydrogen bombs, with
provisions for international inspection and control such as would
safeguard the security of all nations, together with drastic reduc-
tion of all other armaments.”

At the annual meeting of the Middle Atlantic Conference of
Congregational Christian Churches held at Glen Ridge, New ]er-
sey, in May, a resolution was adopted urging the UN to increase
its efforts for world disarmament.

On April 1, fourteen outstanding Protestant Church leaders
joined in a letter to the President, published in full in the New
York Times, declaring that all-out war and the use of atomic

bombs against China in the Formosa situation would “expose the '

United States Government and the American people before the
whole world as wanton aggressors” and urging peaceful settlement.

On Sunday, June 19, in connection with the UN Assembly ses-
sion, a giant Festival of Faiths was held in San Francisco, initiated
by the local Council of Churches of Christ and Orthodox Christians,
and joined by Catholics, ]ews, Moslems, Hindus and Bahais. Over
16,000 people joined in prayer in many tongues, asking Divine
guidance for the United Nations in its quest for peace.

In ]uly, as Geneva approached, Protestant, Catholic and ]ewish
clergymen, at the call of leading religious bodies, led their con-
gregations in prayers, joined by millions, for peace and the success
of the Big Four deliberations. ,

The foregoing by no means exhausts the activities of the church
people for peace and international understanding, and makes no
attempt to cover their numerous local activities. Nor is it possible
to cover the expressions and activities of many organizations and
groups which, while not directly connected with any organized
church, are inspired by religious motives. Among these should be
noted the long-established Fellowship of Reconciliation, a paciﬁst
group which has always worked for reconciliation among nations.

Another group dedicated to international friendship and peace
is World Fellowship of Faiths, founded many years ago by Charles
and Eugenia Weller, of which Dr. Willard Uphaus is now execu-
tive director.

Special mention should be made, too, of a peace petition ini-
tiated early this year by a group in Detroit, with national support
from leading ﬁgures in the religious and professional world,
which is being circulated quietly, without. fanfare or pu.blicity, in
many communities, under the auspices of the Peace Petition Com-
mittee. Its text is simple and clear, and one on which all people
of good will can agree. It is addressed to the President of the
United States and asks him, on the basis that war violates the will

of God, to

1. Negotiate with enemies according to the Golden Rule;

2. Abolish weapons of mass extermination as an initial step toward inter-
natonal disarmament and devote the savings to human betterment;

3. Reconcile conﬂicts peaceably through the United Nations and help
nations of differing systems to live together in peace.

Constructive efforts on peace issues have been made by YMCA
and YWCA groups. At the National Convention of the YWCA
in New York on May 21, 4,000 women delegates gave a standing
ovation to UN Under-Secretary Ralph Bunche for a speech in the
course of which he advised:

‘We cannot have a, United Nations consisting only of those

26

 

countries with whose way of life we are in sympathy and of whose
policies we approve.” '

THE QUAKERS

IN THEIR own quiet and consistent way, the Quakers work
steadily for the end of all war. The essence of their philosophy
is summed up in the beautiful and meaningful name of their or-
ganization “The Society of Friends.” They believe that the affairs of
men and nations should be guided by a spirit of love and mutual
understanding instead of hatred and prejudice. Practical expres-
sion is given to this in projects to‘ help the people, carried on by the
American Friends Service Committee in many countries. Funda-
mentally paciﬁsts and non-resisters, believing rather in methods
of individual example and gentle persuasion than. vigorous action,
the Quakers have in recent years become increasingly realistic and
effective in their methods of promoting a peaceful foreign policy
for our country. They recognize the importance of making the
will of the people known to the Administration and Congress. They
have done a tremendous amount of educational and practical work
through their Peace Committee and other groups.

The Quakers publish and distribute a large amount of material
on international affairs. The Friends Committee on National Leg-
islation issues a monthly Washington Newsletter which reports
carefully on measures before Congress affecting peace and the
well-being of the people and urges action upon them.

In a statement of policy issued by this Committee for 1955,
“work to develop friendship, understanding an.d sympathy with
people everywhere” is urged. In this statement, the Quakers call
for the easing of international tensions through the increased use
of the processes of mediation and conciliation, increased efforts

toward universal disarmament through the UN, and implementa-

tion of the President’s atoms for peace plan. They urge support
of efforts to end tensions and ﬁghting in the Far and Near East,
tireless efforts to reach a settlement with the USSR and P'eople’s
China, and discontinuance of the efforts to rearm Germany and
Japan. They urge an end of the militarization of the United States
and the defeat of any form of universal military training. They
propose economic aid and removal of trade barriers as constructive
steps toward peace. They suggest as effective methods to achieve
these ends, personal interviews, letters, phone calls, telegrams, group

resolutions, postcards and petitions to those in a position to deter-
mine national policies.

The March issue of the Washington Newsletter gave special
attention to efforts to reach a general Far Eastern settlement, de-
claring that this required a cease-ﬁre in the Formosa Straits, and
a willingness to move toward eventual recognition of People’s
China and its seating in the UN.

The Friends hold annual Institutes on International Relations
in various centers throughout the country. /

Local Quaker groups carry on many varying peace activities
of local and national importance. Notable among these is the
“American Friends Service Committee Peace Packet.” This is a
program of the National Peace Literature Service of the AFSC,
issued by Russell ]ohnson, Peace Education Secretary, of Cam-
bridge, Mass., and regularly provides a selection of pamphlets,
reprints and important current literature and statements.

The Quaker literature service incl=udes reports from its repre-
sentatives in different countries on world events aﬂfecting peace.
In these can be found some positive appraisals of the importance
of the work of the World Peace Council, despite differences with
some of its methods of work and goals. While the Quakers have
stood apart from deﬁnite association with the world peace or-
ganization, they have sent observers to some of the conferences
in which the World Peace Council has participated.

Among the most important publications issued by the Quakers
have been the series of studies prepared by “working parties”
for the American Friends Service Committee, examining trends of
U.S. foreign policy toward war and proposing positive alternatives.
These include Steps to Peace, The United States and the Soviet

vUnion, Toward Security Through Disarmament. The latest is

Speak Truth to Power, a Quaker Search for an Alternative to Vio-
lence. This is a thorough-going critique of all measures dependent
on violence to achieve national security. It calls for a rejection
of the “devil theory” with regard to the Soviet Union, and ex-
amines positive alternatives to a policy of force through an ex-
panded program of economic assistance, renunciation of colonial-
ism, disarmament and atomic weapons control, and increased re-
liance on the United Nations.

Early in ]une a six-member good-will group of American Quak-
ers arrived in Moscow for a three-week visit. The group was headed
by Clarence E. Pickett, Executive Secretary Emeritus of the
American Friends Service Committee, which sponsored the trip.

Mr. Pickett said that the purpose of the mission was “to lend our
inﬂuence toward reducing the tension between our two countries.”

IEWISH LEADERS AND GROUPS

THE BIENNIAL Convention of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations held in February in Los Angeles, attended by
2,500 dele ates (the largest gathering of Jewish religious leaders
ever assem led in this country) adopted unanimously a strong reso-
lution on “The Achievement of a ]ust Peace.” The resolution con-
demned preventive war as “blasphemy of both religion and democ-
racy,” called for a rejection of colonialism and for cooperation
among all religious groups “to keep the voice of faith above the
clatter of the Weapons of war.” While the resolution blamed
“aggressive communism” as primarily responsible for today’s ten-
sions, it continued:

Nevertheless, we urge the American government to make sure that
we do not, in discouragement and frustration, weaken in our determination
to build a peaceful world.

]ewish people throughout the world have spoken up strongly
against the dangers of German rearmament. The World ]ewish
Congress executive in January, while not actually opposing the Paris
Pacts, reminded ]ews everywhere of “the terrible catastrophe suf-
fered by the Jewish people and by the world at the hands of the
Nazi regime in Germany,” and called for “unremitting vigilance
in preventing every attempt, overt or covert, to reinstate a mili-
tarism which may go hand in hand with the resurgence of Nazism,
the fostering of anti-Semitism and the thwarting of the processes
of democracy.”

On June 18-19 a World ]ewish Conference Against German Re-
armament was held in Paris. Delegates of varying political views

from thirteen co‘-untries, including the United States, pledged a _

united struggle against the rebuilding of a German army under
the leadership of former Hitler generals.

While the national leadership of the principal ]ewish organi-
zations in this country have refused to condemn West German re-
armament under the Paris Pacts, there has been much opposition
and discussion of the issue among the membership. Some Iewish
leaders have made strong statements against German rearrna-
ment, anda number of Iewish publications have expressed editorial

29

..4

 

 

 

  

opposition. Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver has strongly opposed West
Cennan rearmament. Rabbi Norman Salit, president of the Syna-
gogue Council of America, and Dr. Emanuel Neumann, chairman
of the executive committee of the Zionist Council in America, have
expressed concern over the rise of anti-Semitism in West Germany.
The Brooklyn Jewish Examiner has warned against the danger of
a revived Wehrmacht.

Many local groups have been much more outspoken on this
and other peace issues. Among the ]ewish organizational repre-
sentatives who appeared on March 30 before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee to oppose ratiﬁcation of the Paris Pacts was
Yetta Metz, who spoke for the Emma Lazarus Federation of
]ewish Women’s Clubs, an organization active on all peace
issues.

Bulletin of the Assembly, organ of the Assembly of Brooklyn
]ewish Women’s organizations, in its issue of April 19, carried an
editorial headed War or Peace, warning that the belligerent ele-
ments in the administration and the Big Brass might plunge us into
war over Quemoy and Matsu islands. The Bwlletin’s editor called
on all the ]ewish women’s organizations to alert their membership
that “now, right now, we must bombard President Eisenhower with
letters urging the continuance of efforts to promote peace. . . .”

At their annual convention early in May, the Rabbinical Assem-
bly of America, representing the religious leaders of conserva-
tive Judaism, issued a statement declaring:

We commend the President for the restraining influence he has exer-
cised upon those in our country who would solve the present international
impasse by a resort to arms. We pray that he may be granted wisdom
to lead our country into the path of lasting peace.

The opening session of the 103rd annual convention of District
Lodge No. 1 of B’nai B’rith, on May 22 at Monticello, New York,
heard a plea for disarmament from Philip M. Klutznick, the or-
ganization’s international president. He called for disarmament con-
ferences “on a year-round basis” as necessary toward the guarantee
of human rights throughout the world.

The Central Conference of American Rabbis, attended by over
400 reform rabbis, at their annual convention on June 24, adopted
a resolution sensing “a new international climate in which efforts
for lasting peace may take root.” The resolution found hope in
Geneva and in U.S. expressions of willingness to negotiate a cease
fire with the Chinese People’s Republic.

NATIONAL AND LOCAL PEACE GROUPS

DESPITE the multiplicity of peace actions in which the Ameri-
can people are engaged, there is no central national peace or-
ganization through which people of varying viewpoints coordinate
their peace activities.

It should be noted, however, that the American Peace Cr-usade
has made an important contribution and done pioneer work in
stimulating peace activities and in bringing together people of
varying viewpoints around speciﬁc issues. Due to ﬁnancial difficul-
ties it has recently had to depend entirely on volunteer work. The
APC is not a membership organization, and has never had formally
afﬁliated groups. There are, however, about a score of independent
peace councils of similar character, and many others have utilized
its Fact Sheets and other materials. ‘

The main emphasis in APC activities during the past few years
has been on the need for Big Power negotiations. It is a strange
irony that at the very moment when our government has adopted
this course as ofﬁcial policy, the Department of ]ustice should order
the Subversive Activities Control Board to open proceedings against
APC on the ground that it is a subversive “Communist Front” organ-
ization, and should be required to» register as such.

At the March 20th meeting of the APC Resident Board in New
York, the decision was taken to focus the organization’s attention
on prevention of nuclear warfare.

To implement this program, the APC proposed a popular sig-
nature campaign for the prevention of atomic and hydrogen war-
fare, to be directed to the anniversary session of the United Nations
in San Francisco.

The idea of petition and signature campaigns has arisen among
different groups in many parts of the country, taking various forms.

In San Francisco, early in May, ﬁfty-four citizens of the Bay
Area initiated circulation of a peace petition with the one de-
mand: “There is no defense against the H-bomb except peace.
We call upon the United Nations and all countries to outlaw atomic
warfare.” The result: 88,000 signatures presented to the U.N.

The Peace Commiittee of the Northern California-Nevada Coun-
cil of Churches issued an open letter to UN delegates calling for a
ban on all weapons of mass destruction. The ILWU secured 2,000
signatures on a union peace petition to the UN. AFL and CIO
unions joined in peace activities connected with the UN Assembly.

The State Executive Committee of the American Labor Party
in New York State launched a three-month peace drive, from May
8 (Mother’s Day and V-E Day) to August 6, 10th anniversary
of the Hiroshima bombing. The ALP undertook a drive for 50,000
signatures, directed towards President Eisenhower, welcoming
the forthcoming top-level conference of the big powers and urging
that it be utilized to reach agreement on banning A- and H-bombs
and ending the cold war, opening the way to an age of peace with
the power of the atom harnessed for health and abundance. Many
thousands signed such petitions sent to the UN andy/Geneva.

The Northern California Peace Council and the Southern Cali-
fornia Peace Crusade, both very active organizations on all peace
issues, are engaged in campaigns against atomic warfare and also
presented petitions to the UN.

Other groups carrying on such campaigns are the Illinois As-
sembly of the American Peace Crusade, with which the Chicago
Women for Peace are associated, the Philadelphia Women for
Peace, and the New Jersey Council for Trade, ]0~bs and Peace.

Among the many other active peace groups in the country,
mention should be made of American Veterans for Peace, the Com-
mittee on Peaceful Alternatives (in Chicago), the SOS (Save Our
Sons) movement, which originated in Illinois during the Korean
war and is still active, the Connecticut Peace Council, groups in
Montana, Michigan, Georgia and other states, and numerous grass
roots groups in many communities across the country. Many na-
tionality groups are engaged in extensive peace activities. Each in
its own way is carrying on work for peace. Mr. Albert Bofman
of the U.S. Committee Against Militarization in Chicago, who com-
piles a Peace Directory, has reported that there are 6,000 peace
groups throughout the country.

Among the multitude of grass ro-ots projects for peace is “Peace
Gardens,” originated by Mary Phillips of Lemont, Illinois. Her
plan is simply an exchange of seeds among the people of many
countries, and their planting as symbols of peace and friendship.
This idea has spread to many communities, and has led to an ex-
tensive exchange of correspondence and seeds between Americans
and the people of many other lands.

“Everybody’s Committee to Outlaw War,” organized in ]une,
1954 in Los Angeles, represents an interesting new type of organi-
zation. The initiators were an ordinary cross section of our popula-
tion, including housewives, businessmen, civic workers, musicians,
lawyers, industrial and white collar workers, students, writers, sci-

32

 

 

entists, etc. It reported wide national response to its original appeal
that people all over the country join in an effort to outlaw war.
It now has members and supporters in every state.

This year it has launched a new phase of its campaign with a
proposed ]oint Congressional Resolution to Outlaw War. The
preamble calls attention to the fact that with weapons like atom
and hydrogen bombs threatening world annihilation there can be
no victors in a third world war. The resolution calls for the out-
lawry of war as a means of settlement of disputes.

The Committee urged immediate action in writing to the Presi-
dent, opposing the use of armed force in the Formosa situation, and
asked for signers to the Resolution to Outlaw War.

On the eve of the Tenth Anniversary Assembly of the UN,
the Committee called a conference in San Francisco which issued a
direct appeal to the UN to adopt a resolution outlawing war.

WOMEN’S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE

CTIVE work on all issues related to peace is carried on by the
Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, founded
forty years ago by ]ane Addams. Honorary International President
of this organization, with branches in many countries, is Nobel
Peace Prize Winner, Professor Emily Greene Balch, and Honorary
Chairman in this country, the distinguished writer, Pearl Buck.
The W.I.L. Monthly Bulletin, Four Lights, follows carefully all
legislation affecting peace and the course of Administration foreign
policy and provides the information and inspiration for pressure
from its membership to block all legislation and policies leading to-
wards war. Its February issue carried an Open Letter to‘ Congress
opposing ratification of the Paris Agreements for the rearming of
Western Germany and urging a four-power conference for a peace-
ful settlement of the German question. Its April issue urged re-
doubled efforts for disarmament and in support of plans leading
to total peace. On the question of Formosa the W.I.L. takes the
position that the coastal islands are legally a part of China, that
Nationalist forces should be withdrawn, that UN resources have
not been fully utilized for a peaceful settlement, that the United
States should avoid any unilateral action involving war, and for
the seating of the Chinese People’s Republic in the United Nations.

The W.I.L. has consistently opposed all forms of UMT.
I The W.I.L. plays an active role in the Committee for World

Development and World Disarmament, which it helped to found.

The fortieth annual convention of the W.I.L. held ]uly 11-15
at Mills College, Oakland, California, was dedicated to the over-all
topic of “Peace and Freedom: Challenge of Today, Goal for To-
morrow.” The delegates examined new approaches in the work
for peace, and responded wholeheartedly to the call of the organi-
zation’s secretary Mildred Olmstead, for militant action for peace
and concessions by both sides at the Genevaconference.

WHAT PEACE MEANS 1
TO THE NEGRO PEOPLE

THE concern of the Negro people for peace is closely connected

with their concern for full freedom for all colored peoples and
nations. Negro religious, fraternal and women’s groupings have
followed closely the developments in Asia and Africa (South Africa,
Kenya, Tunisia). Dissatisfaction with U.S. foreign policy has grown
in recent years as they have seen it not only pennitting but encour-
aging the suppression of the liberation struggles of the peoples
of those areas. Their attitude found powerful expression in a speech
by Dr. Mordecai ]ohnson, President of Howard University, before
the 1950 CIO convention, in which he declared:

Again I say, in spite of all we said to the contrary, we, who have the
power to bring the colonial system to an end by the strategic position
which we occupy in the Western world, are indicted before the world not
only as making no sincere effort to bring it to an end, but as bein divided
in our minds about it, half-hearted in our actions on it, and oubtfully
to be trusted by those who still suffer from it.

The course of the wars in Korea and Indo-China served to in-
tensify further the concern of the Negro people with the direction
of U.S. foreign policy. This was reﬂected in the February, 1954,
issue of The Crisis, organ of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People, which carried an article by a leading
Negro journalist, William Worthy, on “Our Disgrace in Indo-
China.” Mr. Worthy described what he had learned during a visit
to Asia of U.S. support of the most corrupt an.d reactionary ele-
ments there, and asked what is to be done about “the counter-
revolutionary direction of America’s policies among the darker
peoples.”

The great inﬂuence of India’s position as a nation of colored

34

 

people which has won its independence and is now playing an
important world role is an important factor with many Negroes.
The names of Gandhi, Madame Pandit and Prime Minister Nehru
enjoy a signiﬁcant respect. Thus, the Negro people have been
deeply impressed by Nehru’s support of a policy of peaceful coex-
istence and by his warnings that the Manila Pact, or SEATO, en-
dangers peace in Asia, instead of insuring it. They have shared
the questions raised by Nehru as to why actions were being taken
and treaties made covering Asian problems by chieﬂy non-Asian
countries.

The peace sentiments of the Negro people sharpened as the
Formosa crisis developed. In February, 1955, the NAACP-sponsored
National Youth Legislative Conference in Washington passed a
resolution urging negotiations with People’s China to avert the
grave threat to peace in Formosa, and adding:

We further urge that the government of the United States grant
recognition to the Chinese People’s Republic and support her admission
to the United Nations.

Many of the outstanding Negro papers came out against inter-
vention in the Formosa Strait. In the Pittsburgh Courier of April
23, Horace R. Cayton, one of the most popular and widely read
commentators in the Negro press, warned that military involve-
ment over the Quemoy and Matsu islands could lead to atomic
war and urged that “we must exercise all of the diplomatic skill

’ we are capable of to try and settle the Formosa question.” Mr.

Cayton declared:

. . . the simple truth is that if we wish to continue to win the East
to our side we cannot alford to drop more atomic bombs on Oriental peo-
ples. '

In the Pittsburgh Courier for ]une 4, 1955, Mr. Cayton com-
mented on the World Peace Congress to be held in Helsinki the
end of the month. Declaring that the politics of some of the
organizers might be “somewhat left of center,” he went on:

I’m so hungry for real peace that I don't care what kind of platter it

is served on. . . . So, as you gather, I’m for peace; I’m for people who have .

the guts to talk about it and meet to try to do something about it.

In an editorial on May 7, the Oklahoma City Black Dispatch
urged that “Saber rattling Senator William F. Knowland should
resign his position as Senate Republican leader if he cannot bring
himself to agree with President Eisenhower’s plans to talk with

35

 

   

Red China’s premier.” The editorial characterized Senator Know-
land as “one of those misguided individuals who wants to feel that
old, dilapidated Chiang Kai-shek represents the Chinese people
when all informed people know he does not.”

Mrs. Rebecca S. Dodson, Chicago Defender columnist, on
]une 11 made a plea for support of the World Congress of Mothers
to be held in ]uly, expressing the hope that American women would
attend this gathering, where mothers will discuss “the needs and
aspirations of mothers who desire peace and the well-being of their
children.” 

The Bandung Conference of Asian and African nations made
a profound impact on major Negro organizations and the Negro
press, who saw in it a historic turning point toward freedom from
racialism and colonialism of the more than half the world’s popu-
lation there represented, and along with this, a profound contribu-
tion toward the achievement of peaceful coexistence on a world
scale.

Many of the major Negro newspapers had their own corre-
spondents at the Conference, and all gave it wide coverage.

Greetings were sent to the conference from important Negro
organizations and leaders. The National Fraternal Council of
Negro churches, representing eight million members, sent a mes-
sage signed by Bishop Edgar Love, president of the Council and
Rev.’ W. H. Jernigan, executive board chairman. The Fraternal
Council greeting said in part:

. . . We hope you will give the world guidance on ways and means

of achieving a just and durable peace and a formula for practicing world ‘

brotherhood irrespective of race or national origin. . . . We hope that
you will make use of your very great inﬂuence to relieve the present inter-
national tensions and the fear of war in the world and that you will throw
all your strength in support of franl<.and steady negotiations, compromise
and cooperation.

Greetings along similar lines were sent by a group of fourteen
Americans, including Dr. Howard K. Thurman, distinguished Negro
theologian and dean of the Chapel, Boston University. This group
declared that “The way of Caesar, of grasping for survival and

strength, is failing in Moscow and Washington,” and urged that

the conference be the source “to integrate our world into a com-
munity of love.”

Bishop William ]acob Walls, Senior Bishop and Secretary,
Board of Bishops, A.M.E. Zion Church, said of the conference:

One can only surmise what will be done there, but I venture the guess
36

 

 

that they will make a plea for world peace, and stake universal justice,
particularly for Colored peoples, as a main condition for preserving the

peace.
Rev. Charles A. Hill, pastor of the Hartford Avenue Baptist
Church of Detroit, Michigan, expressed the view that “The Con-
ference will greatly speed and heighten the peace of the worl .”
The NAACP cabled a greeting to the Conference which
said in part:
We salute the effort of the darker peoples to emerge as an independent
world force in the struggle for order, dignity and peace among nations.

Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, who attended Bandung
as an unoflicial observer, was criticized in important sections of the
Negro press for his statements on the status of Negroes in the
United States, and\for his underestimation of the role of People’s
China and of Prime Minister Nehru of India at Bandung. That
the Conference made a profound impression on him, however,
was made clear in his statement as it closed: '

From here on in Asia and Africa can be our friends if we institute a
bold new foreign policy based not only on ﬁghting communism, but on
the ancient problems of the East—disease, hunger, illiteracy and colonialism.

Many leading Negro newspapers hailed the Conference decisions
as making clear that colonialism is a thing of the past and offering
a workable and honorable plan for world peace.

The NAACP 46th annual convention at the end of june passed

I a resolution on Peace and Collective Security incorporating a

greeting to the Big Four conference, and calling for negotiations
there to consolidate peace.

In addition to the special interests of Negro Americans in poli-
cies relating to Africa and Asia, the Negro people will be found
among the ardent supporters of all peace activities and in leading
roles in many peace groups.

Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois and Paul Robeson, two great men whose
leadership for peace is recognized throughout the world, have
constantly contributed to the crystallization of peace expressions
and action among Negro Americans by their forthright demands
for negotiations, peaceful coexistence, the abolition of all weapons
of mass destruction and disarmament. The lifting by the State De-
partment of the ban on passports for Dr. Du Bois and Mr. Robeson
to travel abroad, would greatly enhance the prestige of the United
States, as would the presence of these two wherever they might go.
Sufficient pressure from the people would help bring this about.

STUDENT AND YOUTH ACTIONS

YOUTH’S ardent desire for peace found nationwide expression
during the Korean war, during the summer of 1954 when it
looked as though United States troops would be sent to Indo-
China, and in the recent crisis over Quemoy and Matsu.
Aside from the reluctance of young people to be drawn into
shooting wars in foreign lands, the issue that has brought the mean-
ing of war preparations most closely home to the youth and stu-
dents of our country has been that of UMT, with its threat of
tearing them away from their dreams and plans just as they are
on the threshold of their chosen life activity.
Despite the efforts to impose conformity on young people in
the schools and colleges, to fence them off from opposing view-
points, and create a uniform acceptance of official policies, there
is extensive evidence of the refusal of youth to‘ be regimented, of
determination to ﬁnd the answers for themselves. This is apparent
in many radio and television programs devoted to questions like
“Youth Wants to Know,” in frequent youth forums, in the recep-
tion given to those who voice different concepts than are heard
in the class rooms, on the occasions when such speakers are per-
mitted on the campuses. It was apparent in the eagerness with
which college debating teams last year took up the question of
the recognition of the People’s Republic of China, pro and con.
In 1953 a movement arose among students across the country
for greater student interchange with other countries.
The group of American college editors who visited the USSR
in 1953 aroused tremendous interest on their return with their ar-
ticles and talks on what they had seen and heard, so different
. from their preconceived ideas. Another group followed in 1954.
As a result of this interest, college groups invited Soviet youth edi-
tors to visit our country. When the Soviet editors applied for visas
to visit the United States in the summer of 1954, they were refused
on the ground that there was little student activity on the campuses
during the summer.
Meantime student councils in about a dozen colleges and uni-
versities supported the project of a visit from the‘ Soviet youth rep-
resentatives. Editorials sympathizing with the idea appeared in
the Harvard Crimson and many other college papers. At the UCLA
in Los Angeles 3,500 students voted four to one in favor of inviting
the Soviet student editors. Polls held in many other colleges were
overwhelmingly in favor.

In November, 1954, the Soviet youth editors again applied for
visas, but not until March 10 this year was it announced that they
would be given.

In the meantime, there was a ferment of excitement on Ameri-
can college campuses. Resolutions were adopted urging that the
visas be issued, and many college papers carried editorials on the
question. Student leaders of eight American colleges and uni-
versities wrote Secretary of State Dulles and Attorney General
Brownell informing them that they had invited the Soviet editors
to visit their campuses and requesting that the arrangements be
facilitated. The letters were signed by the presidents of the stu-
dent councils and college editors at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, Lin-
coln, Oberlin, Reed, Swarthmore, Wayne and Chicago University.

The State Department requested a private organization in New
York, the International Institute of Education, to arrange the visit,
and in no time the Institute was flooded with requests. From coast
to coast colleges and universities asked that the itinerary be ar-
ranged to allow the Soviet editors to visit their campuses. About
100 student councils sent such requests. College papers welcomed
the news and looked forward to meeting their Soviet counterparts.
Trade union locals in various cities, especially Chicago, asked the
editors to be their guests.

The itinerary was to have included Columbia, Fordham, Hunter,
CCNY, Chicago, Michigan, Michigan State, Wayne, Stanford,

, Arizona, University of California, Oberlin, Howard, Tuskegee and

many other colleges and universities.

Deep was the disappointment when the trip was cancelled
due to the insistence of American authorities that the visitors sub-
mit to ﬁngerprinting under U.S. immigration laws, although this
regulation had never been applied to any other Soviet visitors.
A number of student groups sent resolutions and protests to the
State Department. The Oberlin Student Council on April 17, urged
the waiving of the ﬁnger-print provisions as “a positive move to-
ward breaking down the barriers between the United States
and the Soviet Union.” Similar requests were made of the State
Department by the Student Councils of the Universities of Wiscon-
sin and Michigan. The Columbia Spectator, April 20, expressed
the hope “that the principle of free traﬂic of student ideas and
personnel between all countries in this troubled world will be sal-
vaged from its present precarious position.” .

Groups on the campuses are increasingly speaking up on di-
rect issues of war and peace, and many resolutions were passed

39

 

against military involvement over Quemoy and Matsu. At Colum-
bia University, for example, Students for Democratic Action cir-
culated a petition addressed to President Eisenhower warning that
“If the United States Government ﬁghts for Quemoy and Matsu
. . . this . . . could very well lead to an atomic world war.” Stu-
dents for Peace groups have been formed in a number of colleges.

The attempt of the Government to introduce a loyalty oath in
connection with ROTC (Reserve Ofﬁcers Training Corps), aroused
widespread opposition on the campuses, which developed into a
movement against the compulsory character of ROTC itself. As a
result of the protests, the Government was compelled to drop the
loyalty oath provision.

Outside of the colleges, young people are to be found in all
the actions for peace reviewed elsewhere in this pamphlet.

The May issue of Furrows, organ of Habonim, Labor Zionist
Youth, carried an editorial criticizing Secretary Dulles for risking
atomic war over Quemoy and Matsu. Declaring that these islands
are in fact part of the mainland, the editorial continued:

. . . If it were just a question of a civil war between the ‘two Chinas,’

the one that is in China, and the one that is in Formosa and would like
to be in China, it wouldn’t concern us. But such factors as the atomic bomb

 

and the recent Korean War make things more complicated. . . . Once u

again, the real tragedy is not even the policy of Mr. Dulles, but the fact

thalf the Democrats haven’t used their democratic rights to oppose that

po cy. . . .

An appeal against nuclear warfare from the Iapanese YWCA
to the world YWCA was answered by the Eleventh General As-
sembly of the United Student Christian Council meeting in Ox-
ford, ‘Ohio, September 1954. The latter wrote that the appeal
had increased their concern to face the question raised in relation

’ to the development of weapons of mass destruction, and declared

that they reaffirmed the report of the World Council of Churches
on International Affairs on the moral challenge of nuclear warfare,
and its resolution calling for the banning of all weapons of mass
destruction, including atomic and hydrogen bombs.

At its annual convention in Baltimore the end of ]une, Stu-
dents for Democratic Action, representing seventy-ﬁve chapters,
passed a resolution urging that “under no circumstances” should
our country intervene in defense of Quemoy and Matsu islands.
The resolution also urged that the U.S. should not support Chiang
Kai-shek’s attempt to regain control of the mainland, and that
every attempt be made to settle the situation in the Formosa Strait
by peaceful negotiations. The SDA applauded the Big Four meet-

40

ing in Geneva with the hope that it would “ease cold war ten-
sions.”

AMERICAN-SOVIET RELATIONS .

ON THE key question of American-Soviet relations, the constant

propagandizing by our government of what the Quakers call
the “devil theory” in regard to the USSR, and the cutting off of
almost all normal intercourse and exchange, has made work in this
ﬁeld particularly difficult all during the cold war period.

But the new spirit generated at Geneva marks a turning point
in American-Soviet relations. This was expressed in the conciliatory
spirit of the negotiations, in the new atmosphere of mutual conﬁ-
dence created by the statements of President Eisenhower and
Premier Bulganin that each believes the other sincerely desires
peace, by the friendly personal relations established outside the
conference hall, and by the continuing friendly atmosphere in ofE—
cial circles of both countries.

The Geneva directives to the foreign ministers on East-West
contacts called for efforts to “bring about such free contacts and
exchanges as are to the mutual advantage of the countries and
people concerned.” President Eisenhower has since spoken of the
general agreement reached on “a freer flow of news across the
curtains of all kinds,” on exchange of books, of visits and particularly
of peaceful trading. -

And among the American people themselves the feeling has
been growing that it’s high time to let down the barriers separating
us from the Soviet people, not only because knowing each other
is an important factor in preventing war, but because there are
positive things to be gained in cultural and scientiﬁc interchange,
such as is taking place between the USSR and practically all other
countries. .

On April 25, the anniversary of the link-up of the American and
Soviet forces on the Elbe River in Germany, Soviet veterans of that
event welcomed to Moscow nine former American GI’s who had
been there too. The Soviet invitation included expenses for the
round trip from Paris to Moscow. The Americans didn’t have the
money to get to Paris. But when they described their mission on
the TV “Strike It Rich” program as one to improve relations be-
tween the two countries and asked for help, the immediate response
of the TV viewers showed their sympathy with the project.

41

 

  

In a joint statement in Moscow, American and Soviet veterans
declared their determination to work for friendship between the
American and Soviet peoples and peace throughout the world.
The secretary of the American group, ]oseph Polowsky of
Chicago, has lived -"up to this pledge since his return, speaking be-

- fore many groups in the effort to broaden the start that has been

made in opening the way to greater friendship and understanding,
as have other members of the group. i

As a result of a suggestion made last February by the Des
Moines Register, that a delegation of Soviet farmers’ visit Iowa to
see how they raise corn and hogs, and that a delegation of Iowa
farmers visit the farmlands of the USSR, as an “adventure in hu-
man. understanding,” such an ‘exchange is taking place in the sum-
mer of 1955. The ﬁnger-printing regulation which kept out the
group of Soviet student editors was avoided by the designation
of the Soviet group made up of agricultural officials and specialists
as an “oﬂicial” one.

The results of these exchange vistits, the heartwarming recep-
tion given by the Americans to their Soviet visitors and by the
Soviet people to the American group, show the basic friendly feel-
ings of each people for the other, which even the long years of
cold war have not been able to wipe out. They are a living demon-
stration of the value in human understanding, knowledge of each
other’s way of life, and mutually helpful interchange of practical
information that are the result of such contacts. They complement
the Big Four summit meeting at Geneva, and are in their own way
of equal importance in furthering the cause of peaceful coexistence.

Such exchange visits, competition in chess and in °sports——all
this is only the beginning of what could become a rich and fruit-

- ful interchange among the people of the two countries, and a ﬁrm

foundation for peace. Another example of what such interchange
can mean is in the Atoms for Peace conference taking place at
Geneva at this writing, where the scientists of many countries
are sharing their knowledge of peaceful uses of atomic energy.
It is reported in the press that the Russian delegates have
entered fully into the spirit of the conference, presenting more than
a hundred papers on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, providing,
according to the New York Times of August 10, a model and de-
tailed descriptions of the 5,000 kilowatt atomic power plant which
has been successfully generating and distributing electricity for over
a year, the ﬁrst in history to do so, as well as outlining their work
in progress of a much larger plant, and plans for many more large

42

 

 

installations. It is greatly to the credit of President Eisenhower
that it was on his initiative this conference was called, focussing the
attention of the world on the breathtaking vistas of the future be-
fore us if the atom is used to serve humanity instead of destroying it.

The extent of the interchange between the Soviet Union and
Great Britain led the British Government this spring to ask the
British Council, a semi-ofﬁcial body charged with supporting cul-
tural relations abroad, to set up a special committee to promote
closer cultural relations with the Soviet Union. Commenting on this
move, the New York Times said in an editorial on May 23:

The British Government’s new approach would seem to represent a
sensible and sound reaction to a problem which we too must face.

On July 31, the welcome announcement was made of a State
Department plan to set up a unit on cultural ties with the Soviet
Union. The Department reported that it had been deluged recently
with ideas for projects to send to the USSR everything from sym-
phony orchestras to the recipe for grandmother’s raspberry jam.
At the same time it was announced that arrangements are being
made to bring to the United States next season such outstanding
artists as pianist Emil Gilels, violinist David Oistrakh, Galina
Ulanova and other ballerinas, So-viet opera singers, and Obraztsov’s
puppet theater, with American counterparts to go to the Soviet
Union, and also an exchange of contemporary paintings and art
masterpieces. From the USSR have come numerous expressions of a
desire for visits by musicians, actors and artists of the West.

The main organization working in the ﬁeld of American-Soviet
understanding, now in its twelfth year of existence, is the National
Council of American-Soviet Friendship. Under the leadership
of Dr. John A. Kingsbury as chairman, Rev. Richard Morford
as executive director and Theodore Bayer as administrative secre-
tary, and with a National Council of about a hundred leading
Americans in Various parts of the country, this organization has
been carrying on steady and effective educational work. During
the past year it has had to do this under the extremely difficult
conditions of having to divert time, funds and energies to legal de-
fense against the efforts of the Attorney General to require the
Council to register as a subversive, “Communist Front” organization
under the terms of the McCarran Act. It came through the hearings
before the Subversive Activities Control Board with ﬂying colors,
its ten witnesses, including a number of distinguished professors
formerly and presently associated with the Council, utterly blast-

ing the false allegations of such informers as Louis Budenz and T

43

 

“

   

Harvey Matusow (who has since recanted) on which the govem-
ment had built its case.

In spite of this, the SACB on June 23 handed down the decision
that the council must register. It should be noted that this was just
at the period the government was entering upon the new period
of top level negotiations, and beginning to give consideration to
the very questions of trade and cultural interchange and peaceful
coexistence which the NCASF has for years been advocating.

The National Council has continued uninterruptedly its constant,
careful work to further American-Soviet understanding through
conferences, meetings, ﬁeld trips, publications on internal develop-
ments and US-USSR relations and the showing of ﬁlms. Its regular
publications, Facts and Reports on the News, supplemented by
pamphlets and reprints, provide a steady stream of information
vital to an understanding of the issues in American-Soviet relations
and action upon them. Its Committee of Women provides con-
stant support to the Council in the sphere of special material on
questions of child care, family relationships and education, and
does practical work in furthering friendship through facilitating
correspondence between American and Soviet women.

Especially important in 1954-55 is the Council’s project center-
ing on the idea of peaceful coexistence. Correspondence on this
subject was initiated by Dr. Kingsbury with leading Americans,
inviting discussion and statements, and thousands of communica-
tions have gone out to members of Congress and to the ﬁeld leader-
ship of the Council, with proposals for initiation of local action.

The Chicago Council of American-Soviet Friendship maintains
a continuous educational program, and groups in a number of
other cities Work along similar lines.

Valuable work for the promotion of friendly relations has been
carried on by the American-Russian Institute of San ‘Francisco,
under the leadership of Dr. Holland D. Roberts, ‘president and
Rose Isaak, secretary. Their headquarters, with its extensive li-
brary, is a center for research and information. The American-Rus-
sian Institute has launched a new peace project, “Invitation to
Live.” The ARI proposes that the best way of serving our country
and saving the lives of our children and neighbors in.this year of
decision, 1955, is to make a new concerted effort for peaceful co-
existence, through exchange of visits so that the two peoples may
learn of each other’s everyday life, the organization of American-
Soviet cultural festivals in both countries, the promotion of trade,
the exchange of letters and gifts, among both adults and children.

44

 

 

The American-Russian Institute of Los Angeles also has an in-
formation and research center, and carries on cultural and educa-
tional work.

Probably the most comprehensive collection in the country on
the USSR and American-Soviet relations is that of the Library for
Inter-cultural Studies in New York. The library’s comprehensive
materials in both Russian and English, its research ﬁles and bibliog-
raphies, an.d above all the invaluable assistance offered to all who
use its facilities by its able curator, Bernard Koten, make it one of
the most important sources in the country for the material necessary
for international understanding and peace.

Unfortunately, the work of the various Russian Research Centers
in Columbia, Harvard and other universities cannot be described
as having had the aim of the promotion of friendship and real un-
derstanding of the Soviet Union. At the same time, publications
such as the Current Digest of the Soviet Press, issued by the Rus-
sian Institute of Columbia University, provide a valuable source
of information in translations of important speeches and documents
and general material from Soviet publications. Important, too, are
the courses offered in the Russian language whose students, it may
be hoped, may one day act as carriers of friendship.

THE DECISION FOR PEACE
RESTS VVITH THE PEOPLE

THE foregoing does not begin to exhaust the peace activities of

the American people. It does not cover the vast amount of
periodical publications and pamphlets and books devoted to ques-
tions of peace. ‘

It does not cover the devoted efforts of numerous individuals
who are speaking out for peace in their own communities, or travel-
ing up and down the country, speaking to groups large and small
—-the artists, the writers, the musicians and singers, who are using
their creative gifts in the service of life and the future—the scien-
tists who are striving to use the endless potentialities of the human
mind to expand and enrich human life, not to end it.

We have not devoted a special section to the activities of women
and mothers for peace because wherever there are such activities
the women and mothers will be found.

- What war means to parents and teachers was indicated by the
whole-hearted response of the 3,000 delegates to the National

45

 

   

Congress of Parents and Teachers in Chicago, May 25, to the pro-
posal that every school and PTA branch become a rallying center in
the ﬁght for peace, made by National President Mrs. Newton P.
Leonard.

it if #

Everywhere that there is peace activity, the simple, ordinary,
wonderful American people will be found—those who ring door-
bells, write letters, stand on crowded street corners with petitions,
address envelopes, make sacriﬁces from meager budgets that peace
work may go forward. Their name is legion. They are old and
young, dark and white, of many national backgrounds, differing
viewpoints and creeds. They are the best and brightest of our
America. They are animated by the basic principles of liberty and
human dignity on which our country was founded, which they
have seen destroyed as part of a warlike policy. They are ani-
mated by common sense, by compassion, simple goodness and hu-
manity, by the desire for life for themselves and their children
and people everywhere, a good and beautiful life and a secure
future.

_Their work for peace, in its manifold expressions, has already
had its effect in stopping the wars in being, in averting a new war
crisis, in opening the way for a new period of negotiations and
lighting a great hope in the hearts of all people of good-wﬂl.

But the work is not yet done. It will not be completed until
the cold war is ended, until agreement has been reached on arms
reduction and the banning of ato-mic and hydrogen weapons, until
the German question is settled, until the spirit of Geneva is applied
to our relations with People’s China, until continued negotiations
on every area of tension becomes the accepted -method of han-
dling world relations and until peaceful coexistence among the
nations of the earth becomes the order of the day, and war itself
is banished. '

This the American people can accomplish if they will utilize the
great power that lies in their hands for affecting the policies of
our government with ever greater strength and unity and de-
termination. -

Peace is the single greatest issue before us. Only a consistent
policy of peace can save our democratic rights and liberties and
secure our children’s future. A

The decision for peace rests with the people. It is in their hands
to make sure that the bright promise of Geneva is fulﬁlled, and that
a new, warless world is born.

Apologiesfrom the Author V _

s THIS pamphlet goes to press, a letter comes from a friend on

‘the West Coast who was good enough to read the ﬁnal proofs,
calling attention to some serious omissions. I am sure that people
in every state will ﬁnd such omissions with regard to important local
peace activities, and I wish I might have covered them all. Unfor-
tunately we who live in the East are n.ot always as well-informed
as we should be of the manifold activities of the people in every
corner of this great country of ours. It is partly our own fault,
thinking as we sometimes do that we live in the very center of
everything, partly the fault of press and publications which do not
siuﬁiciently report such activities.

Some of the omissions with regard to the West Coast that were
noted were particularly those with regard to nationality groups
who work for peace under great handicaps. This is equally true
of other parts of the country where the people of many national
backgrounds who contribute so much to our nation’s life and
culture have made great contributions for peace. Mention was made
of Mexican—American groups in various parts of the West, of the
]apan Letter group on the West Coast, which has Worked particu-
larly in the ﬁeld of banning nuclear weapons, of Slavic language

'-groups and many others. Mention was also made of the Palo Alto

Peace Club, whose publication, covering many aspects of the
peace struggle, is internationally circulated. ‘
This pamphlet is only a beginning. May it serve to stimulate

_ a greater coverage of all the peace activities of the people, and still

greater peace activities to be recorded!

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT PEACE

THE POWER OF PUBLIC OPINION

THE COMPELI..ING DEMAND of the people of the world for peace

found its response at the Geneva “summit” meeting. The main_

immediate task of easing international tensions was accomplished.
The agreement on continued negotiations by the foreign ministers
means that the heads of the United States, the Soviet Union, Great
Britain and France, are committed to seeking other means than war

' to solve their differences. This is a long step toward ending the

cold war, opening a new era in international relations.

The American people played a decisive role in bringing about
the change in U.S. foreign policy that led to Geneva.

President Eisenhower has repeatedly attested to the inﬂuence
of public opinion on the course and outcome of Geneva. His opening
words at the conference were: “We are here in response to the
peaceful aspirations of mankind.” In his broadcast of July 25 he
declared that he and his associates went to‘ Geneva “resolved to
represent as accurately as we could the aspirations of the Ameri-
can people for peace.” Referring to the “almost unanimous” support
of the country for the Four-Power meeting, the President said:

Aside from this, we had during the past week thousands of telegrams
of encouragement and support from you as individuals. Along with these
came similar telegrams from great organizations—church organizations,
business and great labor organizations.

There were of course many other factors inﬂuencing the decision
to enter on the new course of top-level negotiations, yet all in one
way or another hark back to the will of the people.

Pressure from America’s allies was one of these factors, which

  GET TO KNOW THEM

When the people of our mid-West met the
Soviet farmers the press quoted them a ay-
ing: “When you get to know them yois see
that they are people, just like ourselves!”

V’ That’s right. The trouble is that too many
of us have not been able toget acquainted.

But you can—and you should.

The very spirit of Geneva is this getting to-
gether of nations, of peoples, for the high
purpose of establishing and securing peace V
inour world. The heads of governments were
able to get to know each other better.

And you can get to know the people'--their

. ways, their aims and ambitions, what they
are doing—not only of the USSR, but of
China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Bulgaria, of Rumania and East Germany.

0 In short, you can get to know the people of
those countries about which there is somuch
controversy today. You can do this by sub-
scribing to the American monthly magazine

in turn reflected the pressure of their peoples for peace. The need
of the British Conservatives to use agreement on a Four-Powr
meeting as an election issue in order to win against the Labor
Party, another factor in the Administration’s decision, reflected the
peace sentiments of the British people.

The intensiﬁed peace initiative taken by the Soviet Union and
the Chinese People’s Republic in the months before Geneva were
the result not only of their own need for peace and the desires‘

of their people, but a response t.o the growing demands of the

people everywhere, expressed both through the worldwpeace move-
ment and the manifold expressions of the desire for peace in all
countries.

The Bandung Conference of 29 Asian and African nations had a
strong inﬂuence on the Administration’s decision, reﬂecting as it did
the will of more than half the world’s people for peace and freedom
from all forms of colonial domination. Important, too, was the
special role of India and other neutralist countries.

In this country, also reﬂecting the mounting popular pressure, an
important factor in determining the Administration’s new policy
was the call of Senator Walter F. George (D——Georgia), Chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for Four-Power negotia-
tions. VVhile the liberal wing of the Democratic Party was tardy

in speaking out, it helped in the end in bringing about the decline,

of the inﬂuence of the war-now crowd among both Democrats and
Republicans, and the isolation even within the -war camp of its most
aggressive exponent, Senator McCarthy. The voice of Adlai Steven-
son, 1952 Democratic Presidential candidate, was helpful in over-
coming the negative attitude with which the Administration at first
approached the Geneva meeting. In a Commencement address at
Oberlin College, ]une 13, Mr. Stevenson urged:

. if we the people are uncompromising, if we equate negotiation
with appeasement, if we think war is inevitable, if we regard every Soviet
propos as a trick and a trap, if we think that what is advantageous for
one is automatically disadvantageous for the other, then we the people
will have ruled out bargaining. . . . Our role is to keep our hopes high
but our heads clear, to consider every suggestion honestly and dispas-
sionately, to look for the bases of agreement, and, not least, to be willing
to take some reasonable chances.

This, indeed, was the attitude by which President Eisenhower
was guided at Geneva. ' .

Thus, among the many elements contributing to the success
of Geneva, the inﬂuence of the American people was the immediately
decisive one. The turning point began when the people reacted over-

4

 

 

whelmingly against the efforts of those who were trying to get our
.country involved in war with People’s China over the offshore
islands.

Such pressure is of equal importance both in opposition to poli-
cies and measures endangering peace—and in support of those
which promote it. Undoubtedly the praise bestowed on President
Eisenhower by the press and the people of our own country and
the world for his conciliatory spirt and positive role at Geneva, will
have a strong inﬂuence on his future conduct of our country’s
foreign affairs.

Therefore it is of the utmost importance that the pressure of the
people be continued, both in criticism when it is necessary and in
praise when it is due. _

In this it will be helpful for all Americans concerned with peace
to know what other Americans, like-minded on this issue, however
different-minded on others, have been doing in recent months.

This pamphlet is an effort to draw together some of the im-
mediately available information on this subject in the hope that
the glimpses it may give of the surging peace movement now rising
from the grass roots of our whole beloved country may bring new
conﬁdence for continued and intensiﬁed peace efforts.

We know that the demands of the American people contributed
greatly to' the ending of the Korean war, and the bringing about of
a settlement in Indo-China instead of U.S. military intervention.
This pamphlet, however, will deal mainly with the period which
began with the Formosa crisis and culminated in Geneva.

America is practically alone among the countries of the world
in not having a big organized national peace movement, but We
can take heart from the extent to which our people individually,
in groups and through their organizations, are taking their own
initiative in working for peace. A .

Another striking fact is the extent to which all kinds of people
and organizations have recognized the decisive role of political
methods in affecting peace issues. The idea that it is necessary to
extend political action beyond the mere act of voting for candidates,
to exert pressure on the candidates in the process of election cam-
paigns and to keep the desires of their constituents constantly be-
fore those in office or seeking election, has taken strong hold.

Even the most cursory review of peace actions and expressions
shows an extraordinary unity among all sections of our population,
including today even some of the most conservative, on the main
issues relating to peace. _

These issues will be reviewed ﬁrst, and then what various groups
and organizations are doing about them.

The H —Bomb Horror

The horror of the H-Bomb has had the widest repercussions of
any single issue in awakening people to the meaning of war in this
atomic era and the necessity or stopping it forever.

At ﬁrst the statements of scientists that weapons can now be
made which could end all life on earth were almost too abstract
and unimaginable to have meaning. The idea gained currency that
no nation could be so stupid or evil as to use such suicidal weapons,
and that the very limitlessness of their destructive capacity would
be a war deterrent. But actual effects of the tests of ever more
horrible weapons and statements by high ofﬁcials advocating their
use, have aroused a new sense both of personal fear and moral
abhorrence of the idea of nuclear warfare, and alerted people to
the terrible dangers of even continuing the tests.

The radiation illness of the Iapanese ﬁshermen and the Mariana
Islanders who were victims of the Bikini H-bomb test March 1, 1954,
and the visit of the tragically disﬁgured Hiroshima maidens to our
country for plastic surgery, became a symbol of what could happen
to millions of civilians in the event of a war fought with such
weapons. Radioactive snow and rain falling on many American
communities intensiﬁed the fear of further tests. ,

The belated announcement by the U.S. Atomic Energy Com-
mission, almost a year after the event, that 7,000 square miles of
lethal radioactivity resulted from the Bikini explosion, spread new
horror intensiﬁed by scientists’ warnings of the effect of radioactivity
on future generations.

On March 6, the Federation of American Scientists issued a
statement declaring that as a result of the radiation injuries resulting
from the Bikini test: '

. . ‘. We stand convicted in the eyes of many people of an attitude
of callous disregard for the health and safety of the people Of other
nations.

Noting that scientists differed on the extent of the dangers of
genetic effects from the tests, the statement continued:

. . . However, it should be clear that future accelerated H-bomb test
programs, by several atomic powers, will ultimately reach a level which

can be shown to be a serious threat to the genetic safety of all the people
of the world.

The Federation of American Scientists therefore proposed to
the U.S. Government that a UN Commission study the biologi-
cal and genetic effects and make recommendations to the UN
General Assembly on procedures to avoid exceeding the danger
threshold. (The U.S. delegation has since announced the plans to
propose such a commission formally.)

The statements by Val Peterson, Civil Defense Administrator,
that the only kind of defense is “dig, die or get out” only proved
that there is no defense at all against nuclear weapons, for those
who dig will emerge into deadly radioactive rubble, and those
who get out have no place to go if bombs keep falling.

For ten days the people of America read of the delay of the
explosion at Yucca Flat, Nevada, because the winds were wrong
to prevent danger of fall-out that could kill people thousands of
miles away—and knew that in a war no participant would stop
for the weather. Then, at breakfast time on May 5, as they pre-
pared to go about their normal activities, they saw the terrible
mushroom cloud on their television, the shattered “capsule” re-
productions of the typical American town below, which could be
the town where anybody lives, the blasted homes which could
be their own, the dismembered dummies which -might be their
own children. This test bomb had almost twice the power of the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, which killed 200,000 of the ]apa—

nese people at once and from whose effects they are stﬂl suifer- -
V ing and dying. According to the New York Times account the

next day, the Yucca Flat atomic bomb was merely “a ﬁrecracker
in comparison with hydrogen bombs.”

The horror engendered by the idea of nuclear warfare has in-
tensiﬁed both the demand for the prohibition and control of nu-
clear weapons, and popular opposition to all war.

An example of the wide public concern in this question was the
all-day Conference on Effective Disarmament and World De-
velopment which brought together 300 delegates of a large num-
ber of organizations in Chicago on April 30. It was called through
the initiative of the Committee for World Development and
World Disarmament with headquarters in New York.

Lively round-table discussions covered questions relating to the
conditions necessary for the achievement of disarmament, the role
of the United Nations, effective methods of atomic weapons con-
trol and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. In an
informal straw poll, four-ﬁfths of those present voted for the ban-
ning of further tests of nuclear weapons.‘
