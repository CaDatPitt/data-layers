prices that bring about an excessive immigration,
and low prices an excess of emigration. -

We might show from another point of V1eW

how not only the supply, but also the demand, is '

determined by the cost of production; but this
would lead us too far from our present subject.

We have just seen how the ﬂuctuations of sup-
ply and demand always reduce the price of a
commodity to its cost of production. It is true
that the precise price of a commodity is always
either above or below its cost of production; but

‘ .the rise and fall reciprocally balance each other,

so within a certain period, if the ebb and ﬂow of
the business are reckoned up together, com-
modities arepexchanged with one another in ac-
cordance With their cost of production; and thus
their cost of production determines their price.
The determination of price by cost of produc-
tion is not to be ‘understood in the sense of the
economists. The economists declare that the
average price of commodities isequal to the cost
of production; this, according to them, is a law.
(The anarchical movements in which the rise is

. compensated by the fall, and theifall by the rise,

they ascribe to chance. With just as good a
‘right as this, which the other economists assume,
we might consider the ﬂuctuations as the law, and
ascribe the ﬁxing of price by cost of production
to chance. But if we look closely, we see that
it is precisely these fluctuations, although they‘
bring the most terrible desolation in their train,
and shake the fabric of bourgeois society like
earthquakes.‘ it is precisely these . fluctuations
which in their course determine price by cost of
produ'ction. In the totality of this disorderly
movement is to be found its order. Throughout
these alternating movements in the course of this
industrial anarchy, competition, as it were, cancels
one excess by means of another.

.We gather, therefore, that the price of a com-
modity is determined by its cost of production, in

    

   
 
  
 
 
 
 

  

 

  

p H. ._....__._.,._
such manner that the periods in which the price of

 

this commodity rises above its cost of production ,

are compensated by the periodsin which it sinks
belowsthis cost, and conversely. Of course this
does not hold good ‘for one single particular'prod—
uct of an industry, but only for that entire
branch of industry. So also it does not hold good
for a particular manufacturer, but only for the
entire industrial class. 

The determination of price by cost of produc-

tion is the same thing as its determination, by the .

duration of the labor which is ‘required for the
manufacture of a. commodity; for cost of produc-
tion may be divided into (1) raw material and
implements, that is, products of industry whose
manufacture has _cost a certain number of days’
work, and which therefore represents a certain
duration of labor, and (2) actual labor, which is
measured by its duration. 1 .

Now the same general laws, which universally
regulate the price of commodities, regulate, of
course, wages, the price of labor.

Wages will rise and fall in accordance with the
proportion between demand and supply, that is,
in accordance with the conditions of the competi-
tion between capitalists as buyers and laborers as
sellers of labor.. The ﬂuctuations of wages cor-
respond in general with the ﬂuctuations in the
price of commodities. Within these ﬂuctuations
the price of labor is regulated by its cost of pro-
duction, that is, by the duration of labor which is

required in order to produce this commodity,~

labor. . _ V
Now what is the cost of production of labor

itself ? i

It is the cost required for the production of a-

laborer and for his maintenance as a laborer.

The shorter the time requisite for instruction
in any labor, the less is the laborer’s cost of pro-
duction, and the lower are his wages, the price of
his work. In those branches of industry which

  

     

12
scarcely require any period of apprenticeship,
, and Where the mere bodily existence of the la-borer

   

and maintenance are almost limited to the cost of
the commodities which are requisite to keep him
alive. Theprice of his labor is therefore deter-
mined by the price of the bare necessaries of his
existence. . . .
Here; however, another consideration comes in.
The manufacturer, who reckons up his expenses
of_ production and determines accordingly the
price of the product, takes into account the wear
and tear of the machinery. If a machine costs
him £200 and wears itself out in ten years, he adds
£10 a year to the price of his goods in order to
replace the worn-out machine by a new one when
the ten years are up. In the same way we must
‘reckon in the cost of production of simple labor
‘the cost of its propagation; so that the race of
laborers may be put in a position to multiply and
to replace the worn-out workers by new ones.
Thus the yvear and tear of the laborer must be
taken into account just as much as the wear and
tear of the machine.

Thus the cost of production of -simple labor
amounts to the cost of the laborews subsistence and
propagation, and the price of its cost determines
his wages. When we speak of wages we mean the
minimum of wages. This minimum of wages
holds good, just as does the determination by the

general, not for the particular individual, but for
the species. Individual laborers, indeed millions
of them, do not receive enough to enable them to
subsist and propagate; but the wages of the whole

adjusted to this minimum.

Now that we are grounded on\these general laws
which govern Wages just as much as the price of
any other commodity, we can examine our subject
more exactly. »

“Capital consist's of raw material, implements of
labor, and all‘ kinds of means of subsistence, which
areused for the production ‘of new implements
and new means of subsistence. All these factors
of capital are created by labor, are products of
labor, are stored-up labor. Stored-up labor which
serves as the means of new production is capital.”

So say the economists.

What is a negro slave? A human creature of

the black race. The one deﬁnition is _just as valu-

able as‘ the other. ,

The negro is a negro. In certain conditions he is
transformed into a slave. A spinning—je11ny isra
machine for spinning cotton. Only in certain
conditions is it transformed into capital. When
torn away from these conditions it is just as little
capital as gold is money in the abstract, or sugar
the price of sugar. In the work of production
men do not stand in relation to nature alone.
They only produce when they work together in a
certain way and mutually exchange their different

kinds of energy. In order to produce they rnutﬂ‘-"" '

ally enter upon certain relations and conditions,
and it is only by means of these relations and
conditions that their relation to nature is deﬁned,
and production becomes possible.

These social relations upon which the producers
mutually enter, the terms upon which they ex-
changetheir energies and take their share in the
collective act of production, will of course differ

. according to the character of the means of pro-

duction. With the invention oflﬁrearms as im-
plements of warfare the whole organization of the
army was of necessity altered; and with the alter-
ation in the relations through which individuals
form an army,’ and are enabled to work together
as an army, there was a simultaneous alteration in
the relations of armies to one another. *

Thus with the change in -the social relations by
means of which individualsproduce, that is, in the
social relations ofproduction and with the altera-

 

 

 

  

14
tion/ and development of the material meansof
production, the /powers of production are also
transformed. The relations of production collec-
tively form those social relations which we call a
society, and a. societyrwith deﬁnite degreeslof
historical development, a society with an appro-
priate and distinctive character. Ancient society,
feudal society, bourgeois society, are instances of
this collective result of the relations (‘of production,
each of which marks out animportant step in the
historicalidevelopment of mankind. ; "

Now capital also is a social condition, of pro-
duction. It’ is a bourgeois condition of produc-
tion, a condition of the production of a bourgeois
society. Are not the means of subsistence, the
implements of -labor, and the raw materitalgof

 

which capital consists, the results of definite social ,,

relations ;_ were they not produced and stored up
under certain social conditions? Will they not be
used for further production under certain social

conditions? Andis it not just this deﬁnite social ~

character which transforms into capital that prod-
uct which‘ serves for further production?

Capital doesnot consist of means of subsistence, - L
implements of labor, andprlaw material alone, nor a
only of material products; it consists just as much -

of exchange values- ,All the products of which ,

it consists are commodities. Thus capital is not 1
merely thesumof material products; it is a sum -
of commodities, " of exchange. tv‘alues,-“tofu social « -

quantities. - , a

Capital remains unchanged if wesubstitute cot-V i ,
ton for wool, rice forscorn, ands; steamers for rail- 

aways; provided only that thelcotton, the rice‘, 

the steamers-——the bodily form of ,capital——have
the same exchange value, the same price,,as the
Wool, the corn, the railways, in-which it formerly
embodied itself. The bodily form of capital may
change continually, while, the capital itself under-
goes not the slightest alteration. V I ‘

But though all capital isa sum of commodities, _ i

that is, of exchange values, it is not every sum of
commodities, of exchange values, that is capital.

Every sum of exchange values is an exchange

value. For instance, a‘ house ‘worth a thousand
pounds is an exchange value of ,a thousand
pounds. A penny-worth of paper is the sum of

the exchange values of a hundred-hundredths of a K

penny. Products "which may be mutually ex~
changed are commodities. The deﬁnite propor-

-tions iniwhich theypare exchangeable form their ,
exchange value, or expressed in‘ money, ‘their

price- The amount of these products can do

nothing to alter their deﬁnition as being com- '

modities, or as representing an exchange value,
or as having a certain price. Whether a tree is

Wlarge or small, it remains a tree. Whether we
f ‘exchange iron for other wares in ounces or in
; hundredweights, that makes no difference in its

character as a commodity possessing exchange
 value. According to its amount it is a commodity

i «of more or less worth, with ‘a higher or lower it

price. p

How, then, can a sum of commodities, of ex-
changeivalues, become ca ital? l _
By niaintaining and multiplying itself as an

independent social power,lthat is, as the power of
c a portion of society, by means of its exchange for
' direct, jiving labor. = Capital necessarily ’presup~

posesthe existence of a class which possesses
nothing but labor force. *“ L

{It is the. lordship of past, stored—up, realized
labors over actual,living labor that transforms the

W stored-up labor into capital.

, Capital does not consist in the fact that stored-'

 cup labor is used by living labor as a means to
_ further production; It consists in the fact that
‘living labor serves as the means whereby stored<

change value. c

What is it that takes place in the exchange d

between capital and wage-work?-ad

 

 

16.

The laborer receives in. exchange for his labor
the means of subsistence; but the capitalist re-
ceives in exchange for the means of subsistence—-
labor, the productive energy of the la-borer, the

creative force whereby the laborer not only re-.r
places what he consumes, but also givesyto the

stored-up labor a greater value than it had before.
The laborer receives from the capitalist a share
of the previously provided means of subsistence.
To what use does he put these means of subsist-
ence?', He uses them for immediate consumption.
But as soon as I consume my means of subsist-
ence they disappear and are irrecoverablytlost
to me; it therefore’ becomes necessary that I
should employ my time during which these means

keep me alive in order to produce new meanstof
‘subsistence, so that during their consumption I

may provide for my labor new value in the place
of tha.t‘Wl1iCh"fl’111S disappears. But it is just this
grand reproductive power whichthe laborer has

to bargain away to capital in exchange for the a

means of. subsistencewhich he receives. To him
therefore it is entirely lost.

Let us take an example. A farmer gives his day g
laborer two shillings a day. For this two shi1- j

lings he works throughout the day on the farmer’s
ﬁeld, and so secures him a return of four shillings.

The farmer does not merelyget the value which 7
he had advanced to the day laborer replaced; the 
doublesit. I-Ieshas thus spent or consumed the ‘I’
two shillings which he gave to the day laborerhin

a fruitful and productive fashion. He has bought
for his two shillings just that labor and force of

the day laborer which produces fruits of the earth.

of twice the value, and turns’ twolshillings into

four. The day laborer, on the other hand, re-as

ceives in place of his productive force, which he
has just bargained away to the farmer, two shil-

lings; and these he exchanges for means of sub— 7

sistence; which means ofsubsistence he proceeds
with more or less speed to consume.

.a

The two a -

 

 

 

 

 

17

shillings have thus been consumed in double
fashion; productively for capital, since they have
been exchanged for the labor force which produced
the four shillings; unproductively for the laborer,
since they have been exchanged for ‘means of sub-
sistence which have disappeared forever, and whose
value he can only recover by repeating the same
bargainwith the farmer. Thus capital presup-
poses wage-labor, and wage-labor presupposes cap-

ital. They condition one another; and each brings

theother into play. .
Does a laborer in a cotton factory produce
merely cotton? No, he produces capital. He pro-

duces value which serves aﬁesli to command his

own labor, and to create new value by its means.
Capital can only increase when it is exchanged

V ‘for labor, when it calls Wage—labor into existence.

Wage-labor can only be exchangedfor capital by
augmenting capital and strengthening the power
Whose slave itcis. An increase of capital is there-

p fore an increase of thecproletariat—e-that is, of the

laboring class. ,

The interests of the capitalist and the laborer
are thereforeyidentical, assert the bourgeoisie and
their economists. And, in fact, sothey are! The
laborer perishes if capital does not employ him.
Capital perishes if it does not exploit labor; and

y in order to exploit it, it must buy it. The faster

the capital devoted to production——the productive
capital—4increases, ‘and the ‘more successfully the

i industry is carried on, the richer do the bour-

geoisie become, the better does business go, the
more laborersdoes the capitalist require, and the
dearer does» the laborer sell himself.

Thus the indispensable condition of the labor-,
er’s securing a tolerable position is the speediest
possible growth of productive capital.

But what is the meaning of the increase of pro- I

ductive capital? The increase of the power of
stored-up labor over living labor. The increase

 

    

  

18

‘ of the dominion of the bourgeoisie over the labor- T

ing ‘class. As fast as Wage-labor creates its own
antagonist and its own master in'the dominating
power of capital, the means of employment, that
is, of subsistence, ﬂow back to it from its antag-
onist; but only on the condition that it is itself
transformed afresh into a_ portion of capital, and
becomes the lever whereby the increase of capital
may be again hugely accelerated. ’ '

Thus the statement that the interests of capital
and labor are identical comes to mean merely
this: capital and wage-labor are the two‘ terms
of one and the same proposition. The one con-
ditions the other, just_in the same way that the
usurer and the borrower condition each other
mutually. l

So long as a wage-laborer remains. a wage-
laborer, -his lot in life is dependent upon capital.
That is the exact meaning of the famous com-
munity of interests between capital and labor.

The increase of capital is attended by an in-
crease in the amount of Wage-labor and in the
number of waged-laborers; or, in other words, the
dominion of capital is spread over a large number
‘of individuals. And, to, give the most ‘fortunate
event possible, pwith the increase of productive
capital there is an increase in the demand for
labor. And thus wages, the price of labor, will
rise.

A house may be large or small, but as long as

the surrounding houses are equally small, it satis- i

ﬁes all ‘social expectations as a dwelling place.

But let a palace arise by the side of this small L

house, and it shrinks from a house into a hut.
The smallness of the house noW.gives it to be
understood that its occupant has either very ‘small
pretensions or none at all; and however high it
may shoot up with the progress of civilization, if
the neighboring palace shoots up also in the same

or in greater proportion, the occupant of the

 

 

  

19

comparatively small house will always ﬁnd him-
self more uncomfortable, more discontented, more
conﬁned within his four walls. .
A notable advance in the amount paid as wages
_ brings about a rapid increase of productive cap-
ital. The rapid increase of productive capital
calls‘ forth just as rapid an increase in wealth,
luxury, social wants, and social comforts. There-
‘fore, although the co-mforts of the laborer have
risen, the social satisfaction which they _give has
fallen in comparison with these augmented com-
forts of the capitalist which are unattainable for
the laborer, and in comparison with the general
development of comforts. Our wants and their
satisfaction have their origin in society; we there-

._ fore measure. them in their relation to society, and

not in relation to the objects which satisfy them.
Since their nature is social, it is therefore relative.
As a rule then, gages are not determined merely
by the amount of commodities for which they
may be exchanged. They depend upon various
prelations. ’ '
What the laborer immediately receives for his

labor is a certain sum of money. Are wages de- ‘

termined merely by this money price?
_In the sixteenth century the gold and silver in

p «circulation in Europe was augmented in conse-
’ quence of the discovery of America. The value

of gold and silver “fell, therefore, in proportion to
other commodities. The laborers received for
their labor the same amount of silver coin as
before. The money price of their labor remained
the same, and yet their gwages had fallen, for in
exchange for the same sum of silver they obtained
a smaller quantity of other commodities. This
was one of the circumstances which furthered the
increase of capital"an'd the rise of the bourgeoisie
in the sixteenth century.

Let us take another case. In the Winter of 1847,
in consequence of apfailure of the crops, there was
an important increase in the price, of the indis-

   
  

  

 
 

Wage-Labor and Capital.  

WHAT ARE WAGES AND HOW ARE THEY DETERMIHNED?

‘If we were to ask the laborers, “How much
wages do you get?” one would reply, “I get a
couple of shillings a day from my employer;’’ an«
other, “I get a half-crown,” and so on. According
to the different trades to which they belong they
would name different sums of money which they
receive from their particular employers, either for
working for a certain length of time, or for per-
forming a certainpiece of work; for example,
either for weaving an ell of cloth, or for setting
up a certain amount of type. But in spite of this
difference in their ‘statements there is one point
in which they would all agree; their wages are
the amount of money which their employer pays
them, either for working a certain length of time
or for a certain amount of work done.

Thus their employer buys their work for money.
For money they sell their work to him. With the

same sum for which the employer has bought their

work, as for instance, with a couple of shillings,
he might have bought four pounds of sugar or a
proportionate amount of any other wares. The
two shillings with which he buys the four pounds
of sugar are the price of four pounds of sugar.

The two shillings with which he buys labor for V

twelve hours are the price of twelve hours’ work.
Work is therefore as much a commodity as sugar,
neither more nor less, only they measure the
former ‘by the clock, the latter by the scales.

The laborers exchange their own commodity

with their employers—-work for money; and this ,

exchange takes place according to a ﬁxed_ pro-
portion. So much money for so much work.

2

 

 

  

   

23

pensable means of subsistence, corn, meat, butter,
cheese, and soon. We will suppose that the la-
borers still received the same sum of money for
their labor as before. Had not their wages fallen
then? Of course they had. For the ‘same amount
of money they received" in exchange less bread,
meat, etc.; and their wages had fallen, not be-
cause the value of silver had diminished, but be-
cause the value of the means of subsistence had
increased.

Let us ﬁnally suppose thatthe money price of
labor remains the same, while in con-sequence of
the employment of new machinery, or on account
of a good season, or for some similar reason,
there is a fall in the price of all agricultural and

.» manufactured goods. For the same amount of _
money the laborers can now buy more com-

modities of all kinds. Their wages have therefore
risen, just because their money pricehas not
changed. ;

The money price of labor, the nominal amount
of wages, does not therefore fall together with the
real wages, that is, with the amount of ‘ com-
modities that may practically be obtained in ex-
change for the wages. Therefore, ifgvve speak of
the rise and fall of wages, the money price of

a

labor or the nominal wage is not the only thing

i which we must keep in view.

But neither the nominal wages, that is, the
amount of money for which the laborer "sells
himself to the employer, nor yet the real wages,
that is, the amount of commodities which he can
buy for this money. exhaust the relations which
are comprehended in the term Wages. ~

For the meaning of the word _is chieﬂy ‘deter-
mined by its relation to the gain or «proﬁt of the
employer-—it is a proportionate and relative‘ex-

. pression.

The real wage expresses the price of labor in
relation to the price of other commodities; the
relative wage, on the contrary,pexpresses the price

21

of direct‘ labor in relation to that of stored-up
labor,"the relativevalue of wage-labor" and capital,
the proportionate value of capitalist and laborer.

Real wages may remain the same, ‘or they may
rise, and yet the relative Wages may none the less
have fallen. Let us assume, for example, that the
price of all the means of subsistence has fallen‘ by
two-thirds, while a day’s wages have only fallen
one-third, as for instance, from three shillings to
two. Although the laborer has a larger amount

than he had before for three, yet his wages are
nevertheless diminished in proportion to the cap-
The capitalist’s pr0ﬁt———the man-
uf_acturer’s, for instanee—has been augmented by

value which he pays to the laborer, the laborer “

has to produce a larger sum of exchange value
than he did before. The value of capital is raised
in proportion to the value of labor. The division
of social wealth between capital and-labor has
become more disproportionate. ,.T;he capitalist
commands a larger amount of laboii’ with the same
amount of _capital. The power of the capitalist

— class over the laboring class is increased; the
‘ social position of the laborer has deteriorated, and

is depressed another degree below that of the
capitalist.

What then is the‘general law which determines
the rise and fall of wages and proﬁt in their re-
ciprocal relation?

They stand in inverse proportion to one another”.

Capital’s exchange value, proﬁt, rises in the same
proportion in which the exchange Value of labor,
wages, sinks; andrconversely. The rise in proﬁt
is exactly measured by the fall in wages, and the
fall in proﬁt by the rise in Wages.

The objection may perhaps be amade that the
capitalist may have gained a proﬁt by advan-
tageous exchange of his products with other capi-

talists, or by a rise in the demand for his goods,

  

22

whether in consequence of the opening of.neW
markets, or of a greater demand in the old mar-
kets; that the proﬁt of the capitalist/may thus
increase by means of overreaching another capi-
talist, independently of the"rise and fall of wages
and the exchange value of labor; or that the
proﬁt of the capitalist may also rise through an

- improvement in the implements oflabor, a new

    

application of natural forces, and so on.

But it must nevertheless be admitted that the
result remains the same, although it is brought
about in a different way. The capitalist has ac-
quired a larger amount of exchange value with
the same amount of labor, Without having had to
pay a higher price for the labor on that account;
that is to say, a lower price has been paid for the
labor in proportion to the net proﬁt which it
yields to the capitalist. ' 4

Besides We must remember that in spite of the’
ﬂuctuations in the price of commodities, the aver-
age price of each commodity—the‘ proportion in
which it exchanges‘ for other commodities——is
determined. bﬂits cost of production. The over-
reaching and tricks that go on within the capitalist
class thereﬁore necessarily cancel one another.
Improvements in machinery -and new applications
of natural forces to the service of production

 

 

enable them to turn out in a given time with the '

same amount of labor and capital a larger quantity

of products, but by no means alarger quantity of L

exchange value: If by the application of the
spinning-jenny I can turn out twice as much
thread in an hour as I could before its invention;
for instance, a hundred pounds instead of ﬁfty,
that is because the cost of production has been

halved, or because at the same cost I can turn,

out double the amount of products. .

Finally in whatsoever proportion the capitalist
c1asses—the bourgeoisie—whether of one country
orof the market of the whole world-—l-share among
themseives the net proﬁts of production, the total

?V‘§VC7'

I 6

A 23 K
amount of these net proﬁts always consists merely
of the amount by which, taking all in all, direct

l labor has been increased by meansoi stored-up

labor. The sum total increases, therefore, in the
proportion in which labor augments capital; that
is, in the proportion in which proﬁt rises as com-

‘ pared with, Wages.

Thus we see that even if we, conﬁne ourselves
to the relation between capital and wage-labor,
the interests of capital are in direct antagonism to
the interests of wage-labor. _ ’

‘ A rapid increase of capital is equal to a rapid
increase of proﬁts. Proﬁts can only make a rapid

‘increase, if the exchange value of labor——-the rela-

tive wage—makes an equally rapid decline.
The relative wage'may decline, although the
actual wage rises along with the/nominal wage, or

- A money price of labor; if only it does not rise in

the same proportion as proﬁt. For instance, if
when trade is good, wages rise ﬁve per cent, and
proﬁts on the other hand thirty per cent,“ then the
proportional or relative wage has not increased
but declined. M -

Thus if the receipts of the laborer increases - .

with the rapid advance of capital, yet at the same
time there is a widening of the social gulf which
separates the laborer from thevcapitalist, and also
an increase in the power of capital over labor and
in the dependence of labor upon capital.

The meaning of the statement that the laborer
has an interest in the rapid increase of capitalis
merely this: the faster the laborer increases his
master’s dominion, the richer will be the crumbs
that he will get from his table; and the greater
the‘number of laborers that can be employed and
called into existence, the greater will be the num-
ber of slaves of which capital will be the owner.

We have thus een that even the most for-
tunate evemt for the working class, the speediest
possible increase of capital, however much it may

improve the materi 1_ condition of the laborer,‘

._—u-u-—a-..

24

cannot abolish the -opposition between his inter-
ests and those of the bourgeois or capitalist class.

Proﬁt and wages remain just as much as ever in

/ inverse proportion. c

When capital is increasing fast, Wages may
rise, but the proﬁt of capital will rise much
faster. The actual position of the laborer has
improved, but it is at the expense of his social
position. The social gulf V which separates him
from the capitalist has widened. ’

Finally, the meaning of fortunate conditions for
wage-labor, and of the quickest possible increase
of productive capital, is merely this: The faster
the Working classes enlarge and extend the hostile

power that dominates over them the better will be '

the conditions under which they will, be allowed

to labor for the further increase of bourgeois

dominion and for the wider extension of the-
power of ‘capital, and thus contentedly to forge
for themselves the golden chains by which the
bourgeous drags them in its train.

But are the increase of productive capital and
the rise oflwages so indissolubly connected as
the bourgeous economists assert? We can hardly
believe that the fatter capital becomes the more
will its slave be pampered. The bourgeoisie is
too much enlightened, and keeps its accounts
much too carefully, to care forvthat -privilege of
the feudal nobility, the ostentation of splendor
in its retirrue. The very conditions of bourgeois

’ existence compel it to keep careful accounts.

‘We must therefore inquire more closely into
the effect which the increase of productive cap-
ital has upon wages._ ’ -

With the general increase of the productive
capital of.a bourgeois society a manifold accumu-
lation of labor force takes place. The capitalists
increase in number and in power. The increase
in the number of capitalists increases the competi-
tion between capitalists. Their increased power

gives them the means of'leading into the indus-
trial battleﬁeld Daightier armies of laborers fur-

nished with gigantic implements of‘war.

The one capitalist can only succeed in driving
the other,oﬁ the ﬁeld and taking possession of

‘ his capital by selling his wares at a cheaper rate.

In order to sell more cheaply without ruining
himself he must produce more cheaply; that is, he
must heighten as ‘much as possible the productive-
ness of labor. But the most elfective Way of mak-
ing labor more productive is by means of a more
complete subdivision '-of labor, or by the more

extended use and continual improvement of ma-.

chinery. ‘The more numerous the departments
into which labor is divided, and the more gigantic

the scale in which machinery is introduced, in so

much the greater proportion does the cost of
production decline, and so much the more fruit-
ful is the labor. Thus arises a manifold rivalry
among capitalists with the object of increasing the
subdivision of labor and machinery, and keeping
up the utmost possible progressive rate of»-, ex-

‘ _ploitation. '

Now, if by means of a greater subdivision of
labor, by the employment and improvement of

' new machines, or by the more skilful and proﬁt-

able use of the forces of nature, a capitalist has
discovered the means of producing a larger
amount of commoditiesthan his competitors with
the same amount of labor, Whether it be stored-up
labor or direct—if he can, for instance, spin a
complete yard of cotton in the time that his com-
petitors take to spin half a yard—hoW will this
capitalist proceed to act?

He might go on selling half a yard at its for-
mer market price; but that would not have the
effect of driving his opponents out of the ﬁeld and
increasing his own sale. But the need of increas-
ing his sale has increased in the same proportion
as his production. The more effective and more

  

sells them. And, ﬁnally, we must remember that

   
 

_.. Egg ‘
expensive means of production which he has called
into existence enable him, of course, to sell his
wares cheaper, but they also compel him to sell
‘more wares and to secure a much largermarket
for them. Our capitalist will therefore proceed

to sell his half yard of cotton cheaper than his
competitors. .

The capitalist will not, however, sell his com-
plete yard so cheaply as his competitors sell the
half, although its entire production doesnot cost‘,
him more than the production of half costs the ‘
others. For in this case he would gain nothing,
but would only get back the cost of its production.
The contingent increase in his receipts would re-
sult from his having set in motion a larger capital, T
but not from having made his capital more profit-
able tharr that of the others. Besides, helgains I
the end he is aiming at if he prices his goods :3. ~
slight percentage lower thanhis compe'ti'tors.e He
drives them off the ﬁeld, and wrests from them, at‘
any rate, a portion, of theirsale, if only he under- ‘

the price current always stands” either, above or
below the cost of productiomeaccording as the sale,
of a commodity is transacted at a favorable or
unfavorable period of pbusiness. iAccordinge as the
market price of a yard ofcloth is above or below,
its former cost of production, the percentagevwill‘ .; i _ «
alter in which the capitalist, who has employed the, i i
new and proﬁtable means 7of’ production, exceeds
in its sale the actual ‘cost of its production to him,
But our capitalist does not ﬁnd his privilege 7
very lasting. ‘Other rival capitalists introduce, .
with more or less rapidity,<the same machines and
the same subdivision of labor; and this introduc- ,
tion becomes general, until the price of theifyard ~
of cloth is reduced, not only below its old, but pr
below its new, cost of production. T T L T
Thus the capiitalists ﬁnd themselves relatively
in the same position in which they ‘stood before

the introduction of the new means of production;
and if they are by these meahs enabled to offer
twice the product for the sameprice, they now
ﬁnd themselves T compelled to offer the doubled
amount forless than the old price. From the
standpoint of these new means of production the ..
old game begins anew. There is greater subdi-
vision of labor“ more machinery, and more rapid
progressin the exploitation of both. Whereupon
competition brings about the. same reaction
against this result. -

Thus we see how the manner and -means of pro-
duction are continually renewed and revolution-
ized, and how the division of labor necessarily

brings in its train a greater division of labor; the“

introduction of machinery a ‘still larger introduc-
tion; and the rapidity of progress in the efficiency
of labor a still greater rapidity of progress.
That is the law which continually drives bour-
geois production out of its old track, and compels
capital to intensify the productive powers of labor
forthe very reason that it has already intensiﬁed
them—-—the law that allows it no rest, but forever

A whispers in its ear the words “Quick march!”

This is no other law than that which, canceling

 l the periodical sﬂuctuations of business, necessarily
. identiﬁes the price of a commodity with its cost of

production; f

s However powerful are the means ofpproduction

which a particular capitalist may bring into the
ﬁeld, competitionwill make their adoption gen-
eral; and the momentitpbecomes general the sole
result of the greater fruitfulness of his capital is
that he must now, for the same price, offer ten,
twenty, a hundred times as ‘much, as before. But
as he must dispose of, perhaps, a thousand times
as much in order to outweigh the decrease in the‘

selling price by the larger proportion of the prod-

ucts sold, since a larger; sale has now become
necessary, not onlyto gain "as larger proﬁt, but

      
 
 
 
 
 





 

A » p 28 . .

alsotoreplace the cost of production; and the
implements of production, as we have seen, always
get more expensive; and since thislarger sale has

i . become a vital question, not only for him, but also

for his rivals, the old strife continues, with all the
greater violence, in proportion as the previously,
discovered means of production are more fruitful.

, Thus the subdivision of labor and the employment .

of new machinery take a fresh start, and proceed
with still greater rapidity; 7

And thus, whatever be the power of the means
of production employed, competition does its best
to rob capital of the golden fruit which it produces
by reducing the priceof commodities to their cost

of production; /and, as fast as theirproduction is \

cheapened, compelling, by a’ despotic law, the
larger supply of cheaper products to be offered
at the former price. Thus the capitalist will have
nothing by his exertions beyond the obligation to

produce faste-r than before, and an enhancement.
of the ldiﬂiculty of employing his capital to\ ad- ‘

vantage. While competition continually perse-
cutes hinrL-(vvith its lawiof the cost of production,
and turns against himself every weapon which he
forges against his rivals, ‘the capitalist continually
tries to cheat competition by incessantly introduc-

ing further subdivision of labor and replacinglpther

old machines by .new ones, which, though more
expensive, produce more cheaply, instead of Wait-

?’ ”ing till competition has rendered them obsolete. t L

. Let uspnow look at this feverishagitation as it
affects the market of the whole world, and we
shall understand how the increase, accumulation,

and concentration ,of capital brings in their train a
an uninterrupted and extreme subdivision of labor, ~

always advancing with gigantic strides of prog-J

ress, and a continual employment of, new ma-s r

chinery, together with improvement of the old.
But how do these circumstances, inseparable as

they are from the increase. of productive capital,

   

 

  
 

 

 

 

 .,..,......_._._.__ _ .

affect the determination of the amount of wages?
The greater division of labor enables one laborer

to do the.work of ﬁve, ten, twenty; it therefore i

multiplies the competition among laborers, ﬁve,
ten, or twenty times. The laborers do not only

.c-oimpete when one sells himself cheaper than an-

other, they also compete when one does-the work
of ﬁve, ten, or twenty; and the division of labor
which capital introduces and continually increases,
compels the laborer to enter into this kind of
competitioli with one another. T
Further:. in the same proportion in which the
division of labor is irrcreased the labor itself is
simpliﬁed. The special skill of the laborer be-
comes, worthless. It is changed into a monot-
onous and uniform power production, which can
give play neither to bodily nor to intellectual
elasticity. Its labor becomes accessible to every-
body. Competitors, therefore, throng into it from
all‘ sides; and besides, we must remember that
the more simple and easily learnt therlabor is, and

_the less it costs a man to make himself master of

it, so much the lowerymust its wages sink, since
they are determined, like the price of every other

coumnodity, by its cost of production.

The1‘efore,leXactly as the labor becomes more

unsatisfactory and unpleasant, in that ‘very pro-
portion competition increases and wages decline. ~
The laborer does his bestto maintainthe rate of L

wages by performing more labor, whether by
working for a greater number of hours, or by
working harder in the same time. t Thus, driven
by necessity, he himself increases the evil of the

T "subdivision of labor. So the result is this: the.

more he labors the less reward he receives for it;

and that for this simple 'reason——that he competes *

against his fellow workmen, and thus compels
them to compete against him, and to offer their
labor on as wretched conditions as he does; and
that he thus, in the last result, competes against
himself as a member of the working class.

For twelve hours’ weaving, twoshillings. And
do not these two shillings represent two shillings
worth of all other commodities? Thus the laborer
has, in fact, exchanged his own commodity, work,
with all kinds of other commodities, and that in
a ﬁxed p-roportion. ' His employer in giving him

‘- two shillings has given him so much meat, so
much clothing, so much fuel, light, and soon, in T

exchange for his day’s work. The’ two shillings,
therefore, express the proportion in which his
work is exchanged with other commodities-the
exchange-lvalue of his work; andithe exchange-
value of any commodity expressed in money is
called its price. Wage is, therefore, only another

‘ name for the price of work-——for..the price of this

peculiar piece of property which can have no local
habitation at all except in human flesh and blood.

Take the case of any workman, a weaver for
instance. The employer supplies him with thread
and loom. ,The weaver sets to Work, and the
thread is turned into cloth. The employer takes
possession of the cloth and sells it,«say for twenty
shillings. Does the weaver receive as wages .9.
share in the cloth—-in the twenty shillings—in the
product of his labor? By no means. The weaver

' receives his wages long before the product is sold.

The employer does not, therefore, pay his wages
with the ,money he will get for the cloth, but
with money previously provided. Loom and
thread are not the weaver’s product, since they are
supplied by the employer, and no more are the
commodities which he receives in exchange for
his own commodity, or in other words for his

i work. It is possible that the employer ﬁnds no

purchaser for his cloth. It may be that by its

sale heedoes. not recover even the wages he has

paid. It may be that in comparison with the
weaver’s wages he made a great bargain. by its
sale. But all this has nothing whatever“ to ‘do

. with the weaver. The employer -purchases the

weaver’s labor with a. party of his available prop-

. i30
Machinery has the same effect, but in a much
greater degree. It supplants skilled laborers by
unskilled, men by women, adults by children;
where it is newly introduced it‘ throws the hand-
laborers upon the streets in crowds; and where it
is perfected or replaced by later improvements and
more inventions, discards them by slightly slower
degrees. We have sketched above, in hasty out-

. lines, the industrial war of capitalists with one 

another; and the war has-this peculiarity, that
its battles are won less by means of enlisting than
of discharging its industrial recruits. The gen-

, emls, or capitalists, vie with one another as to who

can -dispense with the greatest number of his sol-
diers. -

  

The economist repeatedly assure us that the

laborers who are rendered superﬂuous by the
machines ﬁnd newbranches of employment.

They have not the hardihood directly to assert
that the laborers who are discharged enter upon

the new branches of labor. The facts cry out too

loud against such a lie as this. They only declare
that for other divisions of the laboring class, as,
for instance, for the rising generation of laborers
who were just ready to _enter upon the defunct
branch of industry, ,new means of employment will
open" out. Of course that is a great satisfaction
for the dismissed laborers. The worshipful cap-
italists will not find their fresh supply of exploit-

 

able ﬂesh and blood run short, and will let the

dead bury their dead. This is indeed a consola-
tion with which the bourgeois comfort themselves
rather than the laborers.» If the whole class of
wage-laborers were annihilated by the machines,

how shocking that would be_for capital, which, ~ ‘

without wage-labor, ceases to act as capital at all.

But let us suppose that those who are directly
driven out of their employment by machinery, and
also all those ofythe rising generation who were
expecting employment in the same line, ﬁnd some
new employment. Does any one imagine that this

 

 

 

   

31- ~ ’ '
will be as highly paid as that which they have
lost? Such an idea would be in direct contradic-
tion to all thelaws of economy. We have already
seen that the modern form of industry always
tends to the displacement of the more complex and
the higher kinds of employment by those which
are more simple and subordinate.

_ How, then, could a crowd of laborers, who are
thrown out of one branch of industry by ma-
chinery, ﬁnd refuge in another without having to
content themselves with a lower position and
worse pay? . '
The laborers who are employed in the manufacture
of machinery itself have been instanced as an excep-
tion. ,As soon as a desire arises and a demand be-
gins in an industry for more machinery it is said
that there must necessarily be an increase in the
number of machines, and therefore in the employ-
ment of laborers in this manufacture; and the laborers
who are employed in this branch of industry will be

skilled, and, indeed, even educated laborers.
Ever since the year 1840 this contention, which

.even before that time was only half true, has lost all

its specious color.- For the machines which are em-
ployed in the manufacture of machinery have been
quite as numerous as those used in the manufacture
of cotton; and the laborers who are employed in
producing machines, insteadvof being highly educated,
have only been able to play the part of utterly un-
skilled machines themselves.

But in the place of the man whohas been dis-
missed by the machine perhaps three children-and
one woman are employed to work it. And was it not
necessary before that the man’s Wages should suﬂice
for the support of his wife and his children? Was
not the minimum of wages necessarily suﬂicient for
the maintenance and propagation of the race of labor-
ers‘? There is no diiference, except that‘ now the
lives of four times as many laborers as before are

used up in order to secure the support of one labor- 1

er’s family.

T% repeat our deductions—the faster productive ‘
capl a

p 1 increases the more does the division of labor
and the employment of machinery extend. The more
the division of labor and the employment of machin-
ery extend, so much the more does competition in-
crease among the laborers, and so much more do their
average wages dwindle.

And, besides, the labyoring- class is recruited from

the ~‘higher'strata of society, or else there falls head-_g
long into it a crowd of small manufacturers and small »“«_j .
proprietors, who thenceforth have nothing better to :.

do than to stretch out their /arms by the side of
those of the laborers. And thus the forest of arms
outstretched by those who are entreating for work
becomes denser and,‘ the arms themselves grow ever
leaner. '

Thattthe small manufacturer cannot vsurvive in ’a~
contest, whose first condition is production".on a con-
tinually increasingscale-—that is,lthat he cannot be
at once both a-large and a small manufacturer-—is
self-evident. ' i , i ~  .

That the interest on capital declinesin the same
proportion as the amount of capital increases and
extends, and that therefore. the small capitalist can
no longer live on his interest, but must join the ranks
of theworkers and increase the number of the prole-
‘tariat——-all this requires "no further exempliﬁcation.

Finally, in‘the ~p.r'opor'tion in which the capitalists r
are compelled by the ‘causes here sketched out to ex-
ploit .on an ever increasing scale ‘yet more gigantic
means of production. and with that object to set in
motion the mainsprings of credit, in the same pro-
portion is there an increase of those earthquakes
wherein the business world can only secure its own»

- existence by the sacriﬁce of a portion ofits wealth,‘
its products, and even its powers of production to
the gods of the world below—‘-in»a word, crises in»
crease. They become at once more frequent andxmore A
violent; because in the same proportion:-which the ,
amount of production, and therefore the demand for
the extension of the market, increases,’ the market of
the world continually contracts, and ever fewer mar-

t kets remain to be exploited: since every previous crisis
has added to the commerce of the worlda market,
which was not known ‘before, or had before been only
supe_rﬁcially exploitedby commerce._ But capital not i
only lives upon labor. Like the lord, at once distin- *-
guished and barbarous, it drags with it to’ the grave A V
the corpsesof its slaves and whole hecatombs of lahor- l
e.rs who perish in the _crisis. Thus we see that if”
capital increases fast, competition among thelaborers
increases still fasterxthat is, the means *of employ-
ment and subsistence declineiinproportion’ at a still

erty—of his capita1—in exactly thesame Way as
he has wlth another part of his property bought

W the raw material———the thread—and the instrument

of labor——the loom. As soon as he has made
these purchases——-and he reckons among them the
purchase of the labor necessary to the production
of the clot‘n—-he proceeds to produce it by means‘
of the raw material and the instruments which
belong to him. Among these last is, of course,
reckoned our worthy weaver, who has ‘as little
share in the product, or in the price ofthe product,
as the loom itself. » -
Wages, therefore, are not the worker’s share

- of the commodities which he has.produced. Wages

are the share of commodities previously produced,
with which the employer purchases a, certain
amount of productive labor.

Labor is, therefore, a commodity which its
owner,'the wage worker, sells to capital. Why
does he sell it? In order to live.

But labor is the peculiar expression of the
energy of the laborer’s life. And this energy he
sells to another party, in order to secure for him-
self the means of living. For him, therefore, his
energy is nothing but»a means of insuring his
own existence.’ He works to live. He: does not
count the work itself as a part of his life, rather
is it a sacriﬁce of his life. It is a commodity
which he has made over to another party. Neither
is its product; the aim of his activity. Whﬁt
he produces for. himself is not the silk he weaves,
nor the palace that he builds, nor the gold that
he digs from the mine. What he produces for
himself {is his wage; and silk, gold, and palace

‘are transformed for him into a certain quantity i

of means of eXistence—--a cotton shirt, some cop-
per coins, and a lodging in a cellar. And what of
the laborer, who for twelve hours weaves, spins,
bores,g.—$urns, builds, shovels, breaks stones, carries
loads, and so on? Does his twelve hours’ weaving,
spinning, boring, turning, building, shoveling, and

exactly_where this activity of his eeases——at his

The slave does notsell his labor to
the slave-owner. The slave, along with his labor,
is soldvonce for all to this owner. He is a com-
modity ,_which can pass from the hand of one
owner to that of another. He himself is a com¥
modity, but his labor is not his Commodity. The
serf sells only a portion of his ‘labor. He does not
receive his wages from the owngr of the soil;
rather the owner of the soil receives a tribute
from him. The serf belongs to the soil, and to
the lord of the soil he brings its fruits. The free
laborer, on the other hand, sells himself, and that

commodity.

' by fractions. From day to day he sells by auction,

eight, ten, twelve, ﬁfteen hours for his life to the

highest bidder—to the owner of the raw material, ‘

the instruments of work and the means of life;
that is, to the employer. The laborer himself
belongs neither to an owner nor to the soil; but

eight, ten, twelve, ﬁfteen hours of his daily’ life .

belong to the man who buys them. The laborer
leaves the employer to whom he has hired himself
whenever he pleases; and the employer discharges
him whenever he thinks ﬁt; either as soon as he
ceases to make a proﬁt out of ‘him, or fails to get
so high a proﬁt as he requires. ' But the laborer,
whose only source of earning is the sale of his

labor, cannot leave the whole‘ class of its pur-' '

nouncing his own existence. Hedoes not belong
to this or tha particular employer, but he does
belong to the” playing class; and more than that,
it is his business to ﬁnd an employer; that is,
among this employing class it is his business to

' discover his own particular purchaser.

Before going more closely into the relations
between capital and-wage-work, it will be well to
give a brief survey of those general relations which
are taken‘ into consideration in determining the
amount of wages. \ "

As we have seen, wages are the price of a certain
commodity—labor. Wages are thus determined
by the same law which regulates the price of any
other commodity. '

Thereupon the question arises, how is the price i

of a commodity determined?

By whatmetms is the price of a commodity de-
termined? - *

By means of competition between buyers and
sellers, and the relation between supplyland de-
mand—~oﬂ'er and desire. And this competition

_ by which the price of an article is ﬁxed is three-

fold. a

The same commodity. is offered in the market
by various. sellers. Whoever offers the greatest
advantage to purchasers is certain to drive the

other sellers off the ﬁeld and secure forhimself .

the greatest sale. ‘The sellers, therefore, ﬁght for
the sale andthe market among themselves. Every-
one of them wants to sell, and does his best to
sell as much, and if possible to become the only
seller. Therefore each outbids the otheriin cheap-

ness, and a competition takes place among the — ‘

sellers which lowers the price of the goods they
offer. L

But a competition also goes on among the
purchasers, which on their side raises. the price of
the goods offered.

Finally there arises a competition between buy-
ers and scliers; the one set want to buy as cheap

 

 

 

 

 

s 7 -

as possible, the other to sell as clear as possible.
The result of this competition between buyers and
sellers will depend upon the relatiﬁns of the two
previous aspects of the competition; that is upon
whether the competition in the ranks of the buyers
or that in those of the sellers is the keener. Busi-
ness thus leads two opposing armies into the ﬁeld,
and each of them again presents the aspect of a.
battle in its own ranks between its own soldiers.
Thatarmy whose troops are least mauled by one
another carries off the victory over the opposing
host. - ‘

Let us suppose that there are a hundred bales of _

cotton in themarket, and at the same time buyers
in want of a» thousand bales. In this case the
demand is greater than the ‘supply. The compt-
tition between the buyers will therefore be intense;
each of them will do his best to get hold of all the
hundred bales of cotton. This example is no
arbitrary supposition. In the history of the trade
we have experienced ‘periods of failure of the cot-
ton plant, when particular companies of capitalists
have endeavored to‘ purchase, not only a hundred
bales of cotton, but the whole stock of cotton’in
the World. Therefore in the case supposed each
buyer will try, to beat the others out of the field
by offering a proportionately higher price ’for1 the
cotton” The cotton-sellers perceiving the troops
of the hostileihost in violent combat with one an-
other, and being perfectly secure as to the sale of

i all their hundred bales, will take very good care

not to begin squabblingamong themselves in order
to depress the price at the very moment when their
adversaries are emulating each other in the process
of screwing it higher up. Peace is, therefore, sudm
denly proclaimed in the army of the sellers. They

present a united front to the purchaser, and fold '

their arms in philosophic content; and their claims

' would be absolutely-boundless if it were not that

the ‘oﬁ'ers of even the most pressing and eager of

the buyers must always have some deﬁnite limit.

    

4_ 3 -
Thus if the supply of a commodity is not so

great as the demand for it, the competition
.between the buyers waxes. Result: A more or

less important rise in the price of goods.

As a rule the converse case, is of common occur-
rence, producing an opposite result. Large excess
of supply over demand; desperate competition
among the sellers; dearth of purchasers; forced
sale of goods dirt cheap. .

But what is the meaning of the rise and fall in
prices? "What is the meaning of higher price or
lower price? A grain of sand is high when ex-
amined through a microscope, and a tower is low

._ compared with a mountainp And if price is de-
termined by the relation between supply and de-

mand, how is the relation between supply and
demand itself determined? -
Let us turn to the ﬁrst Worthy citizen We meet.

'He will not take an instant to consider, but like

a second Alexander the Great will cut the meta-
physical knot by the help of his multiplication
table. “If the production of the goods which I
sell,” he will tell us, “has cost me £100, and I get
£110 by their sale-—withi,n, the year, you under-
stand—th'at’s what I call a sound, honest, reason-
able proﬁt. But ,_if I make £120 or £130 by the

sale, that is a higher proﬁt; and if I were to get

a good £200, that would be an exceptional, “an
enormous proﬁt.”- What is it then that serves
our citizen as the measure of his proﬁt? The cost
of production of his goods. If he receives in
exchange for them an amount of other goods
whose production has cost less, he has lost by his
bargain. If he receives an amount whose pro-
duction has cost more, he has gained. And he

. reckons the rise and fall of his proﬁt by the num-

    

ber of degrees at which it stands with reference to
his zero-—the cost of production. ‘
We have now seen how the changing propor-
tion between supply and demand produces the
rise and fall of prices, making them at one time

high, at another low. If through failure in the
supply, or exceptional increase ,,in the demand, an
important rise in the price of a« commodity takes
place, then the price of «another commodity must
have fallen; for,'of course, the price of a com-
modity only expresses in money the proportion
in which other commodities can-‘ be exchanged
with’it._ For instance, if the price of a yard of
silk rises from ﬁve to six shillings, the price of
silver has fallen in comparison with silk; and in
the ‘same way the price of. all other commodities
which remain at their old prices has fallen if com-
pared with ‘silk. _VVe have to give a larger
quantity ‘of them in exchange in order to obtain
the same quantity of silk. And what is the result
of a rise in the price of a commodity? A mass
of capital is thrown into that ﬂourishing branch
ofbusiness, and this immigration of capital into
the province of the privileged business will last
until the ordinary level of proﬁts is -attained; or

rather, until’ the price of the products sinks,

through overproduction. .
Conversely, if the price of a commodity falls
below the cost of its production, capitalwill be
withdrawn from the production of this commodity.
Except in the case -of a branch of industry which
has become obsolete, and is therefore doomed to
disappear, the result of this ﬂight of capital will
be that the production of this commodity, and

' therefore its supply, will continually dwindle until

it corresponds tothe demand; and thus its price
rises again to the level of the cost of its produc-
tion; or rather, until the supply has fallen. below
the demand; that is, until its price has again risen
above its cost of prdduction;’for the price of any
commodity is always either above ‘or below its cost
of production. . -

We see, then, how it is that capital is always
immigrating and emigrating, from the province
of one industry into that of another.‘ It is high
