Associated Farmers Fight Labor
~-Fascist Trends on the West Coast——

On an openly anti—1abor platform, the Associated Farmers of California are pushy
ing their vice~president, Philip Bancroft, for the Republican nomination for United
States Senator. Trade unions, both.A. F. of L. and CIO, oppose this organization
and its candidate as anti~union, representing only the big fruit growers and other
large corporation farm owners.

At the recent Oregon convention of the Farmers Educational and Cooperative Union
(the Farmers Union), a resolution condemned the Associated Farmers as "a vigilante,’
fascist and terroristic organization . . . organized by the big corporation farmers,
with the assistance of the Bank of California." ’

Associated Farmers’ record and program justify this charge. Organized in 1934,
at the time of the maritime strike in San Francisco, the association now claims
50,000 members in California alone. Branches exist in Washington, Oregon, Arizona
and Nevada, and attempts have been made recently to establish one in Minnesota.

To start this association of "farmers," the Pacific Gas Q Electric Co. (one of
the firms involved in the Tom Mooney frame~up), donated $1,250, and the Southern Ege
cific Railroad, $2,500." Sponsors include, according to reliable reports, the Cal.»
fornia Packing,§é, Libby, McNeill §;Libby, and the Pacific Fruit‘§ Produce Co.
Among its leaders”are C. C. Teague, director of the Security National Bank of Cali»
fornia, énd’Hulett C. Merritt, owner of the Tagus Ranch, largest corporation~owned-
farm in California and langest peach orchard in the world.

Vice~President Bancroft with his brother owns the Bancroft Building in San Fran»

cisco and a large pear orchard and walnut ranch in Contra Costa County. .Bancroft rent

cently boasted that the Associated Farmers, as an employers‘ organization, had never
yet lost to a labor union in a strike issue controversy.

"In California, the Associated Farmers used gangster methods in attempts to
break a picket line in a strike of spinach pickers, in 1936, as described by Organis»
er L. 0. Bird at recent hearings before the National Labor Relations Board in the
Ross Packing Co. case. They "shot low so as not to hurt anyone," he said, and they
"did not do a great deal of damage to anyone but in'shooting low they shot Q33 Scan
Q: the pickets’ eyes." (Our emphasis.--LEA.) —-more——

Labor Research Assn. August, 1938.
In Washington state, a meeting of the Associated Farmers in October, 1937, ap-
proved "pickhandle brigades" as a method of defeating union organization, But it
was agreed that such brigades must wear distinguishing marks, so as-not to club each
other. These facts were brought out at NLRB hearings on Ross Packing Co. case.

In Arizona, the Associated Farmers went into mob action in April, 1938, near
Glendale, when 450 members formed a caravan of cars in the strike of 240 strawberry
pickers demanding 25c instead of 20¢ a crate. The "farmers" ganged up on the strik—
ers, broke up their tent colony and drove the union leaders out of the area.

Licensi Q: union organizers is the latest anti~labor measure successfully
pushed through by the Associated Farmers in Mendocino County and now advocated in
many other California counties. According to this ordinance, an applicant must ad»
vertise four weeks in advance before being granted a hearing; must prove "good moral
character"; must reveal what industry he intends to organize; and must prove he is
not "likely to use force". Licenses cost $10 and are good only for three months. If
the organizer is convicted of any "crime" his license will not be renewed; he will
be liable to $400 fine or six months in prison.

Strikebreakipg is the aim of "Initiative 130," backed by the Associated Farmers
in the state of Washington. This vicious measure, if enacted, would require a writ-
ten notice of demands to the employer, a 30-day "waiting period" and then a state-

supervised election in which all employees in a given dispute would vote on an impendn

ing strike. Furthermore, it outlaws any kind of advertising, speaking, or picketing
prior to notification of the employer.

Incorporation pf trade unions is definitely proposed in an initiative petition
sponsored by the Associated Farmers of California and by the hysterically anti—union
organization called "Women of the Pacific". This law would provide:-

For compulsory incorporation of all labor onganizations with detailed regulation

of their election of officers, officers‘ terms, and financial reports. Penalty for
violation, $300 to $1,000 fine, 50 days to one year's imprisonment, or both.

Strikes are hamstrung by extensive provisions for their conduct. "An employee

a must be continuously employed by one employer for 90 days before he can strike or

vote to strike. Minimum of approximately 30 days required before a strike can be
voted. (This provision is especially aimed to defeat strikes of agricultural work—
ers whose work season is short.) Five percent of union membership can demand a re-
balloting of any strike vote. Meanwhile the strike is automatically suspended. No
picketing (broadly defined) is-allowed by anyone except actual employees. Penalty
for violation, $300 to $1,000 fine, or 30 days to one year's imprisonment.

The Attorney General is empowered to sue and dissolve a union in case of "abuse".

platform which includes the following:

1) Compelling all unions to incorporate; 2) preventing the unionization of farm

labor; 3) drastic changes in the relief set~up, including a 5~year residence require-

ment and prohibiting WPA work from competing with private enterprise; 4) prohibiting

any Communist from holding office in or drawing a salary in any labor union; 5) elim»

inating aliens from relief roll benefits; 6) stopping activities of investigating

committees which are "throttling free criticism of the New Deal administration";

7) eliminating "legalized embezzlement of funds collected from the public under the

guise of the so~called Social Security tax." (Berkeley, Cal., Gazette, 5/18/38.)

Responsible for an anti-picketing ordinance in Contra Costa County and for a
system of registering all agricultural workers in order to blacklist union onganizers
and members, Bancroft has employed walnut pickers on his ranch for l5c to 20c an hour,
far below the union rate. As one of the Chamber of Commerce leaders in California,
he led the employers‘ fight against Harry Bridges and the organization of maritime
workers on the Pacific Coast. He "farms" from Bancroft Building on Market Street,
San Francisco. '

G. M. Payrolls Drop Faster than Sales

Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., chairman of General Motors Corp., recently circularized
his stockholders and the press with statements pointing to a considerable increase in
the wage rates and annual earnings of General Motors employee in 1937 as compared
with 1929. Most of these increases were a direct result of the General Motors strik-
es at the start of 1937, a fact which Mr. Sloan neglected to acknowledge.

Also Mr. Sloan failed to point out that under the impact of the depression, Gen»
eral Motors‘ payroll payments have been reduced gg § sharper rate than its own sales
revenues. Although a cut in hourly wage rates has been prevented by union organize»
tion, salaries of unorganized white collar workers have been slashed and the total
payroll sharply reduced by drastic layoffs.

In the first quarter of the year, General Motors‘ sales of $250,512,587 were
25.6% less than in 1937 but its total payroll of $69,755,936 was cut 30.3% from l937.
In the second quarter, sales of $272,264,537 were off 45.6% from 1937, whereas payh
rolls were off 49.9% to $65,703,364.

Sales in the second quarter, moreover, were up 8.7% from the first quarter but
payroll was 5.8% smaller than in the first quarter. The average number of General
Motors‘ employees in the second quarter was 174,253, a reduction of 38:5% from 283,-
169 in the second quarter of last year.

Cgpitalist Thgggggy

Even The Annalist, finance, commerce and economics journal issued by ﬂgw'Yonk
Times, is shocked at the latest revelations of capitalist gangsterism before the
LaFollette Committee investigating civil liberties and interferences with the rights
of labor to bargain collectively. Writing on national legislation in that journal,
July 27, K. K. Hoyt admits that "by patient questioning . . . Senator LaFollette is
making a record which tells a story of violence, espionage, smear campaigns, attempt-
ed intimidation in the press, and other acts well calculated to arouse public indig-
nation.”

Then, says Hoyt, "To make matters worse, company witnesses have acquitted theme
selves poorly at the hearings. They have sought to defend the indefensible. (This
has been true since the beginning of this committee's hearings last year.—-LRA.) They
have evaded questions on which it was obvious that the committee had full evidence in

"the sample of dumb letter writing taken from the company files. . .In the midst of

questioning as to shootings for which the company paid claims, they have wrapped them-
selves in the American flag and have sounded off about the need for law and order and
for the protection of property rights. During testimony as to the shooting of a
woman, by thugs in a truck, two miles from the plant, one official laughed. LaFol—
lette failed to see the humor of it."

The Little Steel plutocrats, whose bloody methods are being exposed in these
hearings before the LaFollette Committee, are dealt with also in a new novel to be
called Little Steel, by Upton Sinclair. It will be run serially, beginning this
month, in the Midwest Daigy Record of Chicago, the Daily Worker of New York, and the
People's World of San Francisco.

Workers‘ Conditions ig Germggy

In recent weeks the Nazis have issued two decrees affecting the working condi-
tions of German workers. The first, issued on June 23 and effective as of July 1,

. obliges all Germans ("state members") to serve for a limited period "in any job as-
‘ signed to them or to undergo any course of instruction to which they are commanded."

(Ngw York Times, 6/24/38) Any attempt to evade this labor service, says this report,
"is punishable with imprisonment or unlimited fines. The State, on the other hand,
accepts no responsibility for damages resulting from it." In addition to facilitat-
ing the placing of workers in urgent armament operations, the provision for "instruc-
tion," according to private German speculations, makes possible "training the entire
population, especially women, in war and munitions work, which.would enable Germany
to set up a ‘shadow’ industrial organization to be ready for use in war time." (ﬂgw
3.0.21: E.i.1I2.<;>_S.. 5/38/38-) ’

Shortly thereafter, the so-called "Labor Trustees," who are government agents
formerly charged with the establishment of minimum wages and working conditions,
were empowered'%o fix maximum pay for work of all kinds." In other words, according
to N§y,XQ§k Times (6/28/38), they are "supposed to prevent any further rise in wages,
salaries and other direct and indirect remuneration that raise labor costs."

Thus, through the conscription and forced labor system established in the first
decree workers will be sent to out-of-the-way places where they are needed, "espece
ially to enterprises that would be able to attract labor only with the lure of high-
er wages." And at the same time they will be deprived of any chance of better wages
due to the "labor shortage" which, according to the Nazis, has occasioned this con-
scription, by the fixing of maximum wages by the Labor Trustees.

Wgges: According to recent statistics of the International Labor Office, nomin-
al wages in Germany declined 21% between 1929 and 1937.

Between 1932 and 1937, according to the Statistical Yearbook of Germany, wage
rates per hour fell about 3%. In the same period, however, cost of living increased
4%. Hence the real hourly wages, or what the worker could buy with an hour's money
income, dropped about 7% since the year before Hitler came into power.

These calculations are based on rather dubious official Nazi figures. Cost of
living figures are especially unreliable, for they cover only official prices. In
reality the people can cover only a part of their needs by buying products sold ac-
cording to the officially fixed and sometimes subsidized prices. They have to buy
many other commodities in markets where prices have risen much faster since 1932.

Thus, as Qggmggy Todgy (June, 1938) points out: "Hitler speaks of a rise in '
the general index of the cost of living of 4%. But consumption articles have increas-
ed, on an average, by 12% and the most important of them by as much as 70%."

_ This magazine points to an increase between 1932 and 1936 in the cost of eggs
of 31%, of margarine, 44%, and of green peas of 52%. It estimates that the cost of
living as a whole in this period rose by 20%. ‘

Finally, the official-wage figures make no allowance for the many compulsory de-
ductions and taxes every worker has to pay, which amount to about 20% of his wages.

Eood consumption: The Nazi organ, German National Economy, October, 1937, gives
figures showing food consumption per head in Germany in 1932 compared with 1936. They
indicate a 10.4% drop in bread consumption, a 14.7% drop/in vegetables, a 4.7% drop
in fruits, a 21.7% drop in fats, excluding butter, which is tightly rationed (margar-

ine dropped 20% and lard 29.3%D, and a 13% drop in consumption of dairy products.

The only items that showed an increase in this period were potatoes——the food
of the poverty stricken--and fish and meat. But the latter item is certainly dis-
torted because the figure for the latter year includes pigs slaughtered by peasants
for their own use. Figures for the earlier year did not include these selfeconsumed
items. Furthermore, the latter year's figures include all the meats canned and re-
tained in warehouses for war, but not actually consumed in 1936.

The quality and nutritive value of foods, especially butter, has also decreased
markedly in recent years, so that purely quantitative comparisons are meaningless.
Bread, for example, has deteriorated and is now made of a mixture of potato flour and
rye. O. D. Tolischus, writing in the Egg York Times (9/4/37), refers to "a progres-
sive decline in the quality of goods sold at fixed prices."

Deterioration of food has led to a decided deterioration of the health of the
German people. In its issue of April, 1938, Qggmagy Todgy refers to an official re-
port on the condition of 2,000 households of workers and civil servants. It quotes
the Soziale Praxis on this report as follows: "The continuous increase in stomach
and intestinal diseases reported by the insurance companies is nothing but a sequel
to a nutrition which is both bad and one~sided and which consists exclusively of
bread and sausage." (And the sausage, incidentally, is adulterated.)

The poorer a people are, the langer percentage of their income must go for food.
A German women's organization made an official survey of 140 households in the summer
of 1937 in various parts of Germany. The families had a top monthly income of 150
marks. It was found that from 50% to 70% of the income went for food.

Hours and productivity: Hours worked in German industry went up from an index
of 82.5 in 1934 to 110.2 in 193? (l936=100), a jump of 34%. In view of the still
larger rise in industrial production in this period there was an increase in the out-
put per hour of about 7%. In other words more goods were turned out in the hours
worked, indicating an increase in the exploitation of the German working class.

Accidents and illness: Safety inspection in the factories has deteriorated and
speedeup and intensification of labor have been increased in the same period. This
has meant an increase in the number of accidents which showed a rise from 64.5 per
1,000 full~time workers in 1932, to 89.6 in 1936. At the same time compensation for
accidents was paid for only 57 out of 1,000 accidents reported, compared with 106 out
of 1,000 in 1932. Illness also increased in this period. In 1932 there were 314
cases of incapacity to work because of illness reported per 1,000 members of those
covered by health insurance,while in 1936 the number had increased to 414 per 1,000.

Social insurance benefits paid to the working class under the social insurance
system fell from 9.35 billion marks in 1932 to 7.32 billion in 1936 and about 7 bil~
lion in 1937.

Employment and unemployment: Number of registered unemployed in Germany in Ap~
ril, 1938, was reported at 423,000 compared with 1,892,000 in 1929, and a monthly ave
erage of 912,000 in 1937. ,

Admitting that there has been a big drop in the monthly average of unemployed
since 1932, it must be remembered that large masses of workers have been absorbed in~
to the compulsory Labor Service where they are paid one mark a day. There has also
been a considerable absorption into the petty bureaucracy of the Nazi party, while
some 250,000 have been thrown into concentration camps and are hence no longer num~
bered among the unemployed. But the drop in nonepolitical unemployment during the
Hitler regime has been largely due to the expansion in the war industries and in the
army, some 700,000 additional workers having been drawn into these two fields.

Final Report pp Company Unions

Company unions are dissected, analyzed, and found to be methods of employer dom-
ination—~in the final report on the subject just issued by the U. S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. It is entitled Characteristics pf ggmpany Unions(Bulletin #634), is 300
pages long and——for a government document--adequately indexed. It is unquestionably
the most complete, effective and authoritative study of the subject ever made, and is
a fitting exposure of the schemes still used by such concerns as, for example, Beth-
lehem Steel, Western Union Telegraph, and New York Telephone Co.

Its main findings are based on studies made in the spring of 1935 which were lat-
er published in the Monthly Labor Review. It was made when company unions were flour-
ishing at the end of the NRA period, before the passage of the NLRA and before em~
ployers began either to abandon them or to transform them quietly into so-called "in-
dependent" unions.

, The final report gives not only the results of the survey based on questionnaires
received from 14,725 employers but the intensive field studies of 125 concerns made
by agents of the Bureau. It gives also a full report on the background of company
unionism in the pre~war, war and post~war periods. Special chapters show the use of
this weapon in particular industries such as railroads where they have now been al-
most completely routed and in the telegraph and telephone fields where they still dis-
play some strength. There are tables and charts showing the wide distribution of the
company unions in various industries.

The extraordinary breadth and intensity of the study is suggested by headings in
major part of the report: conditions attending the formation of company unions, how
they are established, ascertaining the workers‘ choice, constitution of company une
ions, membership, finances and dues, officers and representatives, committees, eme
ployees meetings and participation, procedure for dealing with employer, collective
agreements, arbitration and strikes, matters discussed or negotiated, wage and hour
negotiations, welfare and benefit activities, contacts between company unions, cone
tacts with government agencies, co~existence of company unions and trade unions.

And in every respect the government study, in the restrained language of the so~
cial investigator, finds that this favorite device of the employer, as trade union
critics have long contended, is lacking in effectiveness as a bona fide method of
collective bargaining. Some of the leading conclusions are:

1. The company unions were in most cases established to offset bona fide unions
or to get around a law, such as the NIRA of 1933, supported by the bona fide unions.

2. The great majority, in spite of employer statements to the contrary, were
"set up entirely by management". And "the existence of a company union was almost
never the result of a choice by the employees in a secret election in which . both a
trade union and a company union appeared on the ballot."

3. "Most of the company unions studied relied entirely upon management for
their finances. Many others received more or less important financial assistance
from the employer."

4. Except in a very few cases "the affairs of company unions were managed ens
tirely by persons whose jobs were subject to the good will of management or to re—
strictions accepted by management."

5. As for adjusting grievances or collective bargaining the fraud was complete:
"Such wage adjustments as did take place following requests by company unions were in
most cases not a result of any process which might be termed negotiation or collec-
tive bargaining." ~—more-

. ..u,..... ...u,-...-s.—’_»/

V liiilillgﬁ , lE_Q_T;EJi
Labor Research Assn. Augmst,gl938. p. 7.

6. "Most fundamental was the company union's inability to bring any pressure
upon the employer. . .Only one of the company unions had called a strike to enforce
a demand."

7. "Most important of all, the company unions were hampered by their inability
to control wage conditions in more than one plant." For they "had no machinery for
affecting conditions in competing plants."

8. "Company unions generally lacked adequate means for ascertaining the wishes
and problems of the employees." And "they evinced little interest in matters of so~
cial or labor legislation and were not active in presenting the views of employees on
such matters. There was little discussion in their meetings (where they had.any) re-
garding matters of labor legislation or national policy affecting their interests."

9. Finally, even the most "vigorous" of these organizations (a small group com-
prising only l5% of the total studied) "had no means of marshalling the moral and
financial support of lange bodies of workers to influence the terms of the labor con-
tract beyond the confines of a single company."

A Warning Against British Disputes Act
—-No guide for American labor legislation~-

A commission appointed by President Roosevelt is now investigating labor condi—
tions in certain European countries. According to Egg York Times (7/16/38) it has
finished its survey of British labor legislation. The appointment of this commission,
it will be recalled, was grasped by forces seeking to emasculate the National Labor
Relations Act by repressive amendments, as indicating that proposals would be made to
amend the NLRA along the lines of the British Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act of
1927. \

Appointments to this commission included Charles R. Hbok, president of NLRA~vio—
lating American Rolling Mill Co. and of the National Association of Manufacturers;
Gerard Swope, president of General Electric Co.; Kenry I. Harriman, former president
of the Chamber of Comerce of the United States; and a number of persons generally
regarded as more liberal than these capitalists. The CIO, opposing any amendment to
or modification of the NLRA, declared it could not "sanction such an enterprise, nor
permit its representative to serve on such a comission."

It is expected that the comission report will be published shortly after its
return to this country. Anti-labor forces, Sen. Vandenberg, Henry Ford, Tom Girdler
and others, campaigning for amendment to the NLRA in the next session of Congress,
hope to find this_report full of amunition for their campaign.

It is important, consequently, to keep in mind certain facts relating to British
labor laws in general, and the notorious British Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act
of 1927, in particular. (Some of these were pointed out in earlier issues of our
Labor Notes, when the National Association of Manufacturers first began circulating

‘copies of this act and agitating for passage of similar laborumanacling legislation

in this country.) As A. J. Isserman, CIO attorney, pointed out in his speech to the
annual convention of the American Newspaper Guild in Toronto, Canada (g;Q_News, '
7/23/38), the big business forces attempting to amend the NLRA hope that "under the
smoke screen of imported law they may abolish the rules of the game which check their
unfair anti—labor tactics." Attorney Isserman made the following important points
indicating the different laboraemployer relations prevailing in the United States and

~in Britain:

1. The commission-will find, he declared, that "Great Britain has no anti-

injunction legislation," for "Great Britain has no labor injunctions." In the United
-~more~—

 

  

L A B O R N O T E S
Labor Research Assn. August. 1938. p. 8.

States, however, the labor injunction has become "a prime strikebreaking weapon."

2. "The employer unfair labor practices so prevalent in the United States, and
proscribed by the Wagner Act, hardly exist in England," for:

a) "there is no widespread employer resistance to unionization in Great Britain."
Over ten years ago, British employers expressed their favor of collective bar-
gaining as “so beneficial that in our view it should be encouraged and extended."
(Isserman's quotation from Joint resolution adopted by important British employ-
ers in conference with General Counsel at the Trade Union Conference.) .

b) "the strike for union recognition or its equivalent is a rarity" whereas in
the United States in 1937, according to U. S. Department of Labor figures, union
organization issues, recognition, closed shop, discrimination, etc., were the
most important causes of 58% of all strikes.

c) "there is no law in Great Britain outlawing ‘Yellow Dog‘ contracts. . .those
contracts do not exist in Great Britain."

d) "there are . . . no private detective agencies in Great Britain supplying
spies and thugs and tear gas and munitions to private industry. . .only on rare
occasions are strikebreakers employed. . ."

3. "There is no incorporation of trade unions in Great Britain and . . . regis—
tration is purely voluntary." Some unions register, others do not.

4. "By specific statutory legislation British unions and their members as such
may not be sued for any act committed on behalf of the union or during a trade disn
puts. . .-The union's funds and the funds of the union members are not answerable for
the acts" of individuals participating in an illegal act.

5. "There is no Anti-Trust Law in Eng1and.under which unions can be sued in
treble damages," as were the workers involved in the notorious Danbury Hatters case
in the United States.

_ 6. "Labor has been constantly fighting . . . and seeking to repeal" the British
Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act of 1927, passed after the general strike in 1926
diring a wave of "legislative hysteria" which was seized upon by reactionaries as a
means of incorporating provisions “far beyond any evils apparent in the general
strike period."

7. The British Trade Disputes Act of 1927 "definitely outlawed strikes to co-
erce the government and possibly a type of sympathetic strike" but "in over ten years
there has been no decision outlawing a single strike." Labor is "pledged to its re~
peal."

Attorney Isserman as well as other critics of the British.Act pointed out that
had the commission remained in the United States and examined the records of the
LaFollette Committee on Civil Liberties and the reports of the National Labor Rela—
tions Board, the domination of the courts and public officials by large corporations,

‘the union-smashing activities of Harlan County coal operators, it would be led to

recommend that the Wagner Act be strengthened, that its procedural machinery be speede
ed up, and that stricter penalties be imposed upon employers.

Organized labor and progressives generally will not permit repressive legislap
tion directed against British workers to be used as a cover to destroy the democratic
rights of American workers. * i

Wages and Living Costs ip_New Jersey -

At least 100,000 women and young people in New Jersey are receiving less than
even a bare subsistence wage, while 35,000 women earn less than $5 a week.

In revealing these facts, State Labor Commissioner John J. Toohey made public
results of a recent survey of living costs, calling for $19.25 to $22.06 a week as an
"adequate" wage for women in New Jersey. An annual adequate wage for a woman living
with a family was set at $1,001, and for a woman living alone, $1,147.

This New Jersey survey, however, included not only an “adequate"wage, similar to
New York State's recent report on adequate wages for women, but also went out of its
way to describe a "bare subsistence" wage, at a level more than 40% below the adequate
standard. sweatshops and other employers, running away from union standards, will of
course pick up this lower figure, justifying their action by quoting the Jersey labor
department's report.

Translated into terms of a weekly budget, this report calls for $19.25 for the
girl who shares a home with her family; $22.06 for the one who lives independently.
This compares with the New York State Department of Labor's survey of living costs,
showing $20.73 a week for the one living with a family and $23.36 for the one living
alone. The following table shows the "adequate" weekly wage, the "bare subsistence"
level and the deficit for the girl trying to live on the latter in New Jersey:

Cost of Living in New Jersey Deficit on sub-

. "Adeguate" Bare subsistence sistence wgge
Living with family $19.25 4 $11.31 , $7.94
Living alone 22.06 12.75 ‘$.31

For the woman worker on the subsistence level, home expenses and food costs are
the same as on the "adequate" level, the report showed, but she must go without re-
creation, vacation, and other "incidentals". Medical care and other expenditures are
slashed to correspond with this lower budget.

The New Jersey Department of Labor has also revealed recently that there are _
women and girls in that state working for less than 5c an hour. In one case a girl
was found working for lkc an hour. It is estimated that if all women working in New
Jersey for less than $13 a week were raised to that amount, they would gain $240 mil-
lion a year in wages. Even a $13 per week wage would give them only 30c an hour for
a 44-hour week, or 32%c an hour for a 40-hour week.

Employment Managers‘ Viewpoint

Cost of living, declares J. 0. Hopwood of the Philadelphia Electric Co., in a
book, Salaries, Wages and Labor Relations (Ronald Press Co., $2.50), should have noth-
ing to do with the workers‘ wages, since individuals are not paid because of their
needs.

This is a hard-boiled theory, common among personnel managers--that the worker's
needs have nothing to do with the amount he earns. It is used to justify payment of
the lowest wages on the assumption that the worker is "worth? no more to the company.
It ignores the fact that labor produces all the value that is created. And it denies
the fact that the married worker's earnings must cover not only his own living costs,
but those of his family, including his wife and all children under working age.

Error: In the “Record of Congress," appearing in our-July issue, page 2, summary
of Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 should have given penalty for violators of wage
standards as double the amount of wages due plus lawyers‘ fees, etc.

G.M. Reports tg Its Workers

In line with the latest fad in "public relations" programs, General Motors Corp.
recentxy distributed an "Annual Report to Employees for 1938". It is a very brief
report containing lots of illustrations and pictographs supposedly making the com—
pany*s'books" all very clear and "open" to GM employees.

On the whole it is a clever piece of propaganda designed to give the GM workers
and the public generally-«the press, of course, played it up big—-a somewhat distort-
ed understanding of the company's long~range trend in profits, dividends and related
items. '

GM statements and those of Chairman Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., in the regular report
to stockholders for 1938, indicate certain shortcomings in this special report to
employees. For example, the latter report states:

"We have all seen with our own eyes what happens when a business can't
pay its own way. A business that continually loses money finally has to
close up and that, of course, means loss of their jobs to employees. ."

This platitude is apparently meant to have some reference to GM. But the eme
ployees are not told that in the past 14 years, from 1925 to 1938 inclusive, GM has
not sustained_a loss in a single year; and in the 22 years, 1917 to 1938 inclusive,
it sustained a loss only once~—$38,000,000 in 1921.

GM has made a "net income available for dividends" in 21 out of 22 years. For
the past 14 years this "net income", we find by computations based on figures on page
67 of the 1938 report to stockholders, amounted to $2,192,562,086. This is equal to
over 3~1/2 times the present capital stock of the company, and represents annual av»
erage profits of 25% on this capital stock.

‘To get an idea of how much money this is, the following comparisons may help:

I This net profit of over $2 billion is equal to 55c for each $1 paid out in total

payroll during this period. (And this payroll includes salaries of all employees,

including the millionaire Mr. Sloan himself and dozens of wealthy top officials.)
—-more~-

L A B O R N O T E S
Labor Research Assn. June, 1939. p. 2.

This profit is equal to l4.6c out of every $1 of business done by the company
since 1925. Compare this profit with the payroll which is equal during the same perk
iod to 26.50 out of every $1 of sales. The figures for the 14 years ending December
31, 1938, show this relationship:

Total, 1925-1938 % of sales

Sales $14,951,338,2l3 I ——~

Payrolls 3,982,123,369 26.5%
Net income (profit) 2,192,562,086 14.6%
Dividends paid out 1,696,650,747 , 11.3%

These figures show that dividends paid out amounted to 77.5% of the total pro-
fits realized over this period. The balance was left at the disposal of the company.
Thus dividends were equal to 11.30 for each dollar of business done (sales) and are
equal to 19% yearly on the present total of capital stock. The dividends paid on
the common stock alone have been at the average rate of about 26% a year for the past
14 years (dividends of $l,570,l81,8ll on common stock of $435,000,000). What these
dividends mean per employee, can be seen in the following table:

Contribution per employee to the
company's profits and dividends

To profits To dividends
For 14 years (l925—38) $12,280.10 $9,628.64
Annual average contribution 877.15 ' 678.76
Weekly average contribution 16.87 13.05

All dividends paid out in this l4~year period to "owners" amounted to 430 for
every $1 paid in wages and salaries to employees of GM.

Auto workers‘ union maintains wage scale: In his report to employees, Mr. Sloan
takes credit for maintaining wage rates in 1938, a year of "subnormal activity," as
it is called in the GM report to stockholders. The fact is, however, that the credit
for wage maintenance belongs to the union. Compare the two years 1926 and 1938-~a
noneunion year and a union year—~in which the sales are identical. In the table be-
low we can see theeffect of the union on the payroll:

% of payroll
.Sa1es Payroll to sales Profit

1926 $l,058,l53,338 $220,918,568 20.9 V $186,231,182
1938 1,066,973,000 300,825,930 28.2 102,190,007
1938 compared

with 1926 + 8,819,662 + 79,907,362 + 35% - 84,041,175

This table shows that in the union year, 1938, the payroll was 35% greater than
in the nonaunion year, 1926. It shows also that the increase of roughly $80,000,000
for the employees came as a result of a reduction of a like amount in profits ($84,-
000,000). Mr. Sloan can scarcely deny that the union was the main factor that kept
him from slashing wages in 1938.

State Legislation—-A Lesson

Laws recently passed by Republican—dominated state legislatures give timely ,
warning to organized labor and progressives of what to expect if a coalition of re-
actionary Republicans and old~line Democrats should come to power nationally in l940.

Failure to enact needed labor legislation, such as state acts supplementing the
federal Fair Labor Standards Act, has characterized practically all the state legis-
latures that have adjourned to date. But in formerly progressive states, such as
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Republican governments were elected on
so~cal1ed "liberal" platforms, legislation passed in this session has not only emas~
culated.New Deal measures previously enacted but has returned to the preaNew'Deal
days of open hostility to all union activity. They have drasticalby curbed union acn
tivity, virtually depriving workers of the right to organize and bargain collective-
ly, to picket and to strike, and have sharply curtailed needed appropriations.

Most significant laws passed in these states--laws against which AFL, CIO, and,
in some cases, the railroad brotherhoods are united in opposition~—are:

Wisconsin: Aided hy a coalition of Republicans and anti—New Deal Democrats,
Governor Julius Heil (R) passed the so—called "employment peace act" sponsored by
the Wisconsin Council of Agriculture, counterpart of the fascist Associated Farmers

of California and merely a front for big business. By far the worst such measure en-

acted, it is similar to the notorious Oregon law passed last November.

The act abolishes the labor relations board patterned after the NLRB and creata
ed last year. It sets up a new, 3~man board to be named by the governor with senate
approval, which is to act as judge or mediator in disputes but does not have the pow»
er of investigation or prosecution held by the old board. The act outlaws strikes
that are not voted in secret ballot by a majority of the employees in a collective
bargaining unit~—the unit to be determined by the board; prohibits closedeshop con-
tracts unless approved by three—fourths of the employees; outlaws sit—down strikes;
forbids the check—off unless it is unanimously requested; makes boycotts and picket—
ting illegal unless there is a strike; allows only employees of the struck firm to
picket; requires 10 days‘ notice of strikes affecting "perishable commodities" and
requires unions to furnish detailed financial statements to their members, a provis-
ion that virtually hands this vital information to an employer since another law
passed in this session forbids any union to exclude an employee from membership even
though he is known to be a company spy.

Commenting on this legislation, Business Week (5/6/39) says that it "will prob»
ably keep the closed shop out of rural areas and virtually prohibit it elsewhere."
This journal also points out that the definition of a labor dispute contained in the
act—-"as a difference between an employer and a majority of his employees inpa gglg
lective bargaining unit resulting in a strike Q; lockout" [their emphasis.~~LRA]--
contains "hedges" that are "new refinements on a definition which is already so nar-
row that experts doubt if it will stand up if brought into a federal court in a case
involving interstate commerce."

Dean Lloyd K. Garrison, head of the Wisconsin University Law School and chair-
man of the first National Labor Relations Board, says the Wisconsin act is "A drastic
and surely unconstitutional invasion of the most elementary liberties guaranteed by
the Constitution." It "strikes a vital blow," he declares, "at reputable unions, in
a manner wholly without justification in American or Western European histonvJ'

Minnesota: State legislature, under leadership of Governor Harold Stassen (R),
has passed several laws which together virtually outlaw union organizational activi~
ties. A new state labor relations act requires lO days‘ notice of a desire to nego~

L A B O R N O T E S
Labor Research Assn. ' June, 1939. p. 4.

tiate a collective bargaining agreement or strike and 30 days‘ notice of strike in
"industries affected with a public interest". It outlaws sit~down strikes; prohibits
any union organizer from "attempting to compel anyone to join or refrain from joining
any organization against his will"; specifically makes it unlawful "for any person at
any time" to interfere with the free and uninterrupted use of the highways and stream
or methods of transportation or "wrongfully" obstruct ingress or egress to any place
of business; prohibits picketing by any but employees of the struck establishment and
permits only one picket where there is no strike; and makes selection of the craft
unit mandatory when a craft exists.

It lifts the anti—injunction act and permits the enjoining in the district courts
of any unfair labor practice "threatened" or committed; and deprives anyone who come
mits any of its proscribed activities of any benefits conferred by the act. The act
does not prohibit an employer‘s refusing to bargain collectively, interfering with
the rights guaranteed under the act, or establishing company unions. And there is no
administrative agency designated or empowered to prevent unfair labor practices or
even to investigate them.

Referring to this act also, Business Week (5/6/39) explains that experts are
cooking "an eye" at the strength that may be found in the obscure meaning of "wrong~
fully" in the provision prohibiting the obstruction of places of business, and the
term "unlawful" in the section prescribing interference with employee or their work.
The latter, it says, "may be taken by some sticklers as an indication that the closed
shop will be as dead as vaudeville in Minnesota, but most observers feel that it will
not be interpreted to hurt the ‘all-union‘ shops."

Pennsylvania: Among the many reactionary measures passed by this state legislaw
ture under Republican Governor Arthur H. James, the two outstanding are the amend-
ments to the anti—injunction and state labor relations laws of 1937. \

Amendment to the anti—injunction act, according to ﬂgw York Times (5/31/39) "pro~
vides that courts may issue injunctions during labor disputes when a valid contract
has been violated, when a majority of the employee have not joined a striking union,
when employee are attempting to 'coerce‘ an employer to compel his employee to join
a labor group [picketing or striking for a closed shop] and when employes seize or
damage property." ’Mbreover, the court may issue injunctions in such cases "without
taking testimony." (Egg York Times, 6/l/39.) These provisions are broad enough to
permit obtaining injunctions for practically any strike and thus the old law is to
all intents and purposes completely nullified.

Amendment to the labor relations act outlaws sit—down strikes; gives employers
the right to petition for collective bargaining elections and investigations of labor
disputes; prohibits "coercing an employer to accede to certain labor demands" which
virtually means prohibiting strikes or picketing; makes it an unfair labor practice
to "coerce" workers into joining a union, to join a sit—down strike or to damage pro~
perty; prohibits the "check~off" unless it is authorized by a secret majority vote
‘and the written permission of each employee; and permits craft unions to choose their
own representatives even when the industry is already covered by a labor contract.
According to Patrick T. Fagan, district president of the United Mine Workers (C10),
"The Bill destroys every vestige of advance that has been made by the worker in this
state. Labor would be better off if the entire state labor relations act were re~
pealed."

Other measures weakened the occupational disease and.workmen's compensation acts
greatly reducing benefits to workers provided in the 1937 laws.

In California, New Deal Governor Olson is having his efforts to enact a labor
and liberal program obstructed and sabotaged by reactionary legislature. Senator

'iness by the concern. . .

Labor Research.Assn. June, 1939. p. 5.

Jack Shelley, president of San Francisco Labor Council (AFL), in a radio address pub-
licly charged the Associated Farmers, the State Chamber of Commerce and other bosses‘
organizations with "scuttling labor's legislative program and opening the door to a
recurrence of bitterness and strife."

In Illinois, AFL, CIO and railroad brotherhoods in a united campaign backed by
Mayor Kelly and other New Deal forces, prevented enactment of the Lantz Bill, intro-
duced by Senator Simon E. Lantz (R) and patterned after the vicious Wisconsin "em~
ployment peace act".

In Michigan, the united efforts of AFL, CIO and other progressive organizations
succeeded in substantially modifying a labor relations act that was patterned after
the Wisconsin measure. They also defeated a "baby Dies bill".

Employers Use Apex Decision

Underscoring the danger to all organized labor involved in the Apex decision
(see Labor Notes, May, 1939) is the suit filed by Tom Girdler‘s Republic Steel Corp.
against the CIO, asking for treble damages in the amount of $7,500,000 plus lawyers‘
fees, under the Clayton Act.

Republic Steel Corp., responsible for the death of 16 strikers in the Little
Steel Strike of 1937, and charged by the NLRB with violation of the National Labor
Relations Act, has thus replied to the CIO's attempt to collect $7,500,000 in back
wages for the 5,000 men dismissed by the company as a consequence of the strike.
NLRB ordered reinstatement with back pay of these workers discharged unjustly and
contrary to the NLRA, but the case is still pending in the Circuit Court of Appeals
in Philadelphia. - ‘

And in New York, George J. Oneto, president, and eight other union officials of
Local 20224 of the Wine, Liquor and Distillery Workers Union (AFL) have been charged
with violation of the Sherman Act for conspiring "to interfere with interstate com-
merce." Berkeley W. Henderson, special Assistant Attorney General, obtained the in~
dictment against the unionibr picketing retail liquor stores, March~April, l939, as
a protest against the sale of wines bottled in California.

Official organ of the St. Paul Trades and.Labor Assembly(AFLL Minnesota Union
Advocate,says in an editorial (5/4/39):

"If any American Federation of Labor unionists think the Apex decision is not a
threat to labor simply because the hosiery workers are affiliated with the CIO—~they
had better disabuse their minds once and for all. The Apex verdict, if sustained in
the U. S. Supreme Court, will be a death verdict to hundreds of unions, no matter
what their affiliation may be."

And the CIO's leaflet, A New Blow at Labor, points out that if the Apex verdict
is allowed to stand, “...then any strike, any place, whether it be by teamsters, auto
workers, carpenters, bakers, butchers, bridklayers, or any other union can be declar-

ed a violation of the Sherman Act and the union involved responsible for loss of bus~
n

It declares further: "Labor cannot afford to rest until it is made so clear
that even judges can understand that the Sherman Act does not apply to trade unions...
No branch of the labor movement can afford to sit quietly by until the Apex decision
has been reversed, until the Sherman Act has been amended sovthat it will never
again be applied to labor organizations."

National Health Program

Action of American Medical Association at its convention in St. Louis (5/17/39),
in condemning the National Health Bill (S. 1620) shows need for understanding more
fully the provisions of this vital measure. Many leading physicians, including Surn
geon General Thomas Parran and 430 signers of the "medical declaration of indepen~
dence" (November, 1937), are on record as endorsing such a national program.

Basing his proposals on recommendations of the Interdepartmental Committee to
Coordinate Health and Welfare Activities and its Technical Committee on Medical Care,
Senator Robert r. Wagner (3., N.Y.), introduced the health bill on February 2e,’1939. !
Findings of the comprehensive National Health Survey (see Labor Notes, July, 1938)
were included in the committee reports.

Facts brought out by the Technical Committee in its report, A National Health
Program, recently published, revealed the need for greatly increased medical care in
the country as a whole. Here are ten important points:

1. Persons in families whose annual incomes are less than $1,200 suffer, on
the average, more than twice as many days of disability a year as those in families
with incomes of $3,000 or more.

2. No physicians‘ care is received in 28% of seriously disabling illnesses am~
ong those normally selfksustaining families just above the relief level.

3. Among 20,000,000 in the relief groups, one person out of four receives no
medical care whatever when disabled by illness lasting a week or more. This is also
true for 20,000,000 people above the relief level who can purchase medical care only
by curtailing food, clothing, shelter or other essentials. \

4. Over 40% of the counties in the United States do not contain a registered
general hospital to serve their total of 17,000,000 people.

5. In l936, nearly a quarter of a million women did not have the advantage of
a physician's care at the time of delivery.

6. Workers in industry have a life expectancy approximately eight years less
than non~industria1 workers.

7. For the 10 most deadly diseases, the death rate is almost twice as high
among.unskilled workers as among professional workers. r

8. For respiratory tuberculosis, the death rate among unskilled workers is
seven times as high as for professional workers.

9. Pneumonia causes 150,000 deaths each year. In 27 iron and steel towns the
death rate from pneumonia is two~thirds greater than in the United States as a whole.
"If serums were used generally, it is estimated that the gross pneumonia mortality
could easily be reduced by more than 25%."

10. About 13,000,000 school children do not receive adequate medical care.
In an effort to meet at least part of this appalling need, the National Health
Bill of 1939 (S. 1620) proposes to amend the Social Security Act to provide grants-

ineaid to the states for preventive and curative services. It does not establish a

---mo 1'8--

 

L A B 0 R N 0 T E S
Labor Research.Assn. ' June, 1939. p. 7.

The bill provides for expenditures of about $80,000,000 in the first fiscal
year, ending June, 1940, with increased amounts in subsequent years. Federal grants~
in~aid would include:

For maternal and medical care; medical services, public health and aid to
the physically handicapped, under U. S. Children's Bureau--$22,000,000.

Public health work, fighting tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia and cancer;
for mental and industrial hygiene, under U. S. Public Health Service——
$18,000,000.

To build hospitals and health centers, under U. S. Public Health Service-—
$8,000,000.

To help states financially in providing medical care, under the Social Se~
curity Board, $30,000,000 to $35,000,000.

Other provisions call for temporary disability compensation, with funds to be
administered under the Social Security Board."

For the various programs of public health services and hospital construction,
the authorized federal grants would vary from one—third to two-thirds of the total
sums expended by the states. For the general programs of medical care, the match—
ing ratio would vary from one—sixth to one~half of total state expenditures.

Those responsible for the measure expect that it would raise the general level
of health protection throughout the country, and would reduce the present wide var-
iation among states, especially as between rural and urban areas.

Canadian Labor Developments
~~LRA's Toronto correspondent reports on union activities——

In a recent election at Consolidated Mining & Smelting Co., Trail, British Col-
umbia, the International Union 9; Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers defeated the co-
operative committee (company union), winning at least 16 out of 17 seats. The union
now claims 1,000 members among the 4,000 employees of the company, and is planning
to request a secret ballot under the British Columbia act permitting collective bar~
gaining. Employees of the Pioneer gold mine, the largest in the province, voted
overwhelmingly a week or two earlier to join the union. .

A two~year agreement has been signed between the Salmon Purse Seiners' Union and
the cannery operators. It is expected to bring stability to the industry.and to ine
crease prices over last year. Pacific Coast Fisherman's Union has also obtained an
agreement covering prices for blue back salmon. These gains by Pacific Coast unions
are expected to encourage organization also in the Atlantic fishing industry.

Other union gains during the month were: Upholsterers union, Montreal, success»
fully forced withdrawal of announced wage cuts in two companies; General Workers,
Carpenters and Joiners, and a federal union of Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, jointly suc~
ceeded in securing agreements granting recognition and practically all their demands
for pay increases and overtime pay; taxi drivers of Toronto secured renewal of their
agreement with increases of $1.50 per week in the basic wage which now becomes $14
a week. Dressmakers of Winnipeg, in a vote taken under the Manitoba Strikes and
Lockouts Act, chose to be represented by the International Ladies Garment Workers

Union. The union signed its first contract in Winnipeg with the largest cotton

dress shop in the city, employing 80 workers.

Strike Leader and Strikes

Out of his rich experiences as one of the great labor organizers of this counw
try, William Z. Foster has written his latest book, Pages from g'Worker's Life. (In-
ternational Publishers, 3l4 pp., $2.) This is a volume of personal reminiscences-—
instructive, educational, amusing. Foster went through many important labor strug-
gles and union campaigns. Among the strikes which he led or in which he took a leads
ing part were the following, episodes from which he describes in his book:

1895: Street car motormen and conductors, Philadelphia.

1911: Railroad shopmen (38,000) on the Illinois Central and Harriman Lines.
Extended from Chicago to the Gulf and the Pacific Coast. (Called off unconditionally,
on June 28, 1915.)

1918: Successful strike of 35,000 at Union Stockyards & Transit Co., Chicago.

..—...._—.

1918: Successful strike at Fairbanks Co. (makers of "Gold Dust Twins" washing
powder), Chicago.

1919: Leader of the Great Steel Strike of that year, involving 365,000 workers.

1931: Strike of the National Miners Union in western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio
and West Virginia panhandle. '

1931: Strike of Kentucky miners in Harlan and Bell counties.

'41 # ill I! *

Most of the important strike statistics since 1880 are collected and interpreted
in a volume called Strikes, by Dr. John I. Griffin (Columbia University Press, 319 pp,

$4»)

Subtitled "A Study in Quantitative Economics," the book covers, among other
things, the annual fluctuations in strikes, l880~l937; causes, duration and results;
unions involved and strikes not led.by unions. Two appendices contain tables of
relevant statistics.

\

One suggestive table gives "Percentage of Strikes Which Succeeded, Failed, or
Were Compromised." It shows that in 1937, only 17.3% of the strikes were indicated
as failures. Only the years 1897 and 1899 showed a smaller percentage of failures.

Griffin notes that after the passage of the NIRA, "there was a very rapid rise
in the number of successful strikes mainly for wage increases and recognition. The
proportion reached 46 per cent in 1937, approximately double the record of success of
ten years before. At the same time, under the ‘New Deal‘ compromises fluctuated
around 30 percent. . .The increasing strength pf onganized labor ig probably the ggg

Here Comes Labor, by Chester M. Wright (Macmillan Co., 121 pp., 60c) is intended
as a textbook introduction for those outside the labor movement. It is unfortunate
that one so closely identified with the most reactionary top leaders of the AFL
should have written it. For the book naturally reflects their bias against the CIO
as well as against certain New Deal legislation. Certainly the rank and file of the
AFL would not share Wright's conclusion that "Labor's next crisis may come in the
fight for freedom from the very laws which sent it surging forward in the first
phase of the New Deal." This is nothing more than warmed—up Republican propaganda.

Soviet Trade Union Growth

Total membership of the trade unions of the Soviet Union is now about 23.8 mil-
lion out of a total working population eligible to membership of about 28 million.
And out of the membership in these great voluntary mass organizations, we find the
relatively high proportion of about five million members who are active in one phase
or another of trade union work. They are members of factory committees or subcommit~
tees dealing with social insurance, labor protection, collective agreements, produc-
tion methods and inventions, housing, or educational and cultural activity. They may
be dues collectors, department organizers, or members of shop wage commissions.

With a membership larger than that of all the unions of the rest of the world
combined, the 166 Soviet trade unions report significant gains in the last few years.

The following facts are from recent official reports of union executives. They
reflect the continued progress made in the extension of trade union democracy and in
the training of hundreds of thousands of workers to take positions of trust and lead—
ership in the management of the new socialist economy. In a country where the mines,
mills and factories belong to the workers and farmers organized as the state, the
trade unions naturally have functions to perform that are quite different from those
of unions in other countries where the fight must still be carried on against private
exploiters. One of the most important of these is the conduct of general cultural
as well as technical education. Note especially these six points:

1. As a part of the education of the masses, the Soviet trade unions have al-
ways laid great stress on the building up of factory libraries where workers could
read in rest periods as well as take out books conveniently for use in after—work
hours. In l923 the unions had only about 1,900 such trade union libraries with about
3,600,000 books; now there are over 15,000 with over 42,000,000 volumes. -

2. Number of readers in trade union libraries with over 1,000 books (the small~
er union libraries are not included in these figures) increased from 4,670,000 in
1934 to 6,343,000 in 1938.

3. These libraries are usually located in yprkers‘ clubs which are the centers
of educational life of the Soviet people. Some of these clubs are real "palaces of
culture“, magnificent buildings costing millions of dollars. The total number of
trade union clubs increased from a little over 1,900 in 1923 to about 7,000 in 1938.

4. In these factory clubs the workers carry on an infinite variety of self—edur
cation, entertainment and sports activities. Stpdy gigglgg of various kinds are or—
ganized covering not only cultural topics but those that help to raise the technical
qualifications of the worker~student of all ages. It is reported that in 1935 some
4,730,000 workers took part in these circles while by 1938 the number had risen to
6,573,000. ‘

5. As many of the new workers coming into industry are straight from the farms
and villages and, especially the older workers, have not had opportunities for edne
cation in their youth, the unions have led in the work of "liquidating'illiteragy.
In the last five years, between 1933 and 1938, more than 5,000,000 illiterate and
partly illiterate persons were educated in trade union circles and schools.

6. Over half of the 2.2 billion ruble combined budget of the Soviet trade

unions last year went for cultural and educational work.

Eight Years for Trade Unionism ip Germagy: Just before May Day, a notice ap-
peared in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, April 27, that a sentence of eight years
penal servitude had been given to eight Sudeten Germans who "were not content with
the disappearance of the trade unions."
