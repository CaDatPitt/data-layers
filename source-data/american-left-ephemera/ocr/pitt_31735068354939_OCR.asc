Both Inco locals win
5%‘ interim wiagevhike

V-SUDBURY, Ont.’———The -two big
Inco locals ‘in Port Colborne and
Sudbury rounded out a smashing
1951 contract year by winning
another 5?/2 cents across the
board just a week before Christ-
mas.

In a‘ fast-moving two day bar-

gaining session with the company,
joint negotiators for Sudbury
Local 598 and Port Colborne. Lo-

cal 637 demanded and got the 51/3 ,

cents increase as a “partial pay-
ment to the Inco workers to help
meet the increased cost of milk
and other essential commodities.”
_The 51/; cent “interim” in-
crease went into effect on Mon-
day,_ December 17, and will apply
to some 15,000 workers employed
at the company’s giant operations
in the two Ontario centers. Less
than four months from now—in
early April-—-the two locals will
return to bargaining with the
company on the 1952 contract.-
THE “INTERIM” increase

topped off an unusually success-
ful bargaining year for the two
Inco locals. Back in May, early

in the year, they had won a con-
tract’ which cut thy workweek
from 44 to 40 hours lwithoutﬁloss
in take home pay, and at the

same time increased wages 10-

cents across the board. The May
contract was wdrth an estimated
25 to 27 cents an hour.

When. the interim boost was
won in December, it meant that
increases ‘totalling 301/; to 321/;
cents hourly had been wrested
from the big nickel monopoly by
Mine-Mill for its members in one
year. It also brought wages for

‘the majoritylof workers in Sud-

bury to, a range of’ between
$1.711/2' to $2.011/; an hour, and
for the majority in Port Colborne
toarange of $1.73 and up.

The signatures were hardly dry
on the “interim” agreement be-
fore Mine-Mill demanded that
Falconbridge Nickel Co. and Ca-
nadian Industries Ltd. consent to
bargaining talks on a similar in-
crease. These talks quickly re-
sulted in application of the 51/;

Board meets,
hits freeze,

Humphrey quizl

DENVER——A hard-hitting program
for 1952, keyed to the idea of -“bust the
wage freeze—.=—and- keep it busted”
hammered out by the newly-re—elcted
Mine-Mill International Executive
Board here last week.

Board members, formally sworn in
for a two-year term, took advantage of
their first meeting of the new year to
“take stock”- of the overall situation,
not only within the union and the in-
dustry, but ‘also in the United States
and Canada as a whole. ‘

Before the week was out, they had

3
33
m

. adopted a series of policy statements

on a wide variety of topics, and had
taken a number of steps intended to
raise the union-wide organizing cam-
paign to a new high level. The twin
themes of bargaining and organizing
ran through the entire week’s session.

PRESIDENT John Clark, recovering
from a minor operation and an attack
of flu during the holidays, was able to
sit’ in on at least. some ofithe sessions,
and kept in close touch with the
Board's deliberations.

The Board voted ‘funqualified sup-
port" tothegmembership of C10 Steel
and Packinghouse unions in their cam-
paigns for wage increases. “We must

-’ expend our efforts to the end that our

union’s initial victories on the wage

front are not final or isolated instances . _

of cracking the wage freeze. Wage in-
creases are badly needed by the work-
ers in every industry,” the Board said.

“Every wage increase won from now‘
on will be an additional blow at the.
whole discriminatory wagasfreeze set-
up. Eno_ugh victories will mean the end
to so-called wage stabilization, a false
economic theory based: on’ increased
profits for corporations and lower liv-
ing standards for workers.” - .

THE BOARD made it clear that
while our union’s smashing 1951 wage
and contract victories were the result
of a hard fight which lasted many
months, the campaign for wage in-
creases in 1952 will require even
greater determination and willingness
to fight. , ,

Calling attention to the negotiations
now going on in Kennecott under a
wage reopener, the. Board declared that
“Our union’s 1952 wage struggles are
already under way.” And itmade clear,
that the continuing wage-price-tax
squeeze will bring forth demands for
a substantial wage increase through-
out the industry this year.

The Mine-Mill leaders expressed the
“shock and anger” of metal workers

N the last decade Anaconda has made, $406
million dollars in profits after taxes. ‘In
1951 alone, the figure is almost $46 million

dollars. Where do these profits come from?

You can look high and low in the plush of-
fices of the Company at 25 Broadway, New
York City and you will not find the source.

In fact, the man who. created most of these
fantastic profits could not get into 25 Broad-
way. If he tried, the uniformed elevator start-
er would probably call the police and have him
thrown out. The police would _undoubtedly
book him on a vagrancy charge.

THE MAN would looklike a ~vagrant. His
back would be bent and every i so often, he
would go into a fit of dry coughing and spit
up blood. He would probably wind up in the
County Hospital.

Who is this man? I

Who bent his back and corroded his lungs?

.Why does he look so old, although he says
he is not old? _

This man is a copper. miner. He works at
the Chuquicamata open pit copper mine in
Chile. He is an Indian.

- Chuquicamata accounted. for three-fifths oft
_ Anaconda’s total copper production in the post-

war years. It is the’ largest copper mine in
the world. -It is run by the Chile Exploration
Company, which is a 100-percent owned sub-
sidiary of the Chile Copper Company, which is

"a, 99-percent owned subsidiary of Anaconda.

OVER HALF of all Anaconda’sprofits since
1945 have come from Chuquicamata and the
Indian miners who work there.

There is a reason why our Indian brother ‘

looked so ragged. Anaconda pays him less for

a day’s work than it pays U. S. copper miners K‘

for an-hour’s work. .

 

The Chile Exploration Company’s own fig-
ures show an average payment of 113 pesos
per shift. This includes everything; ‘basic
wage, plus overtime, bonuses, vacation pay,
family allowance and what-not. At the current
free exchange rate this is $1.20 per eight-hour
shift. This is based on information supplied by

‘ the Company itself and compiled by the United

States Embassy at Santiago. According to the
U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the average
U. S. copper miner now makes $1.67 per hour.

Anaconda pays even less in the mines of
its other wholly—owned subsidiary in Chile, the
Andes Copper Company. The total there is

now 67 pesos or 71 cents per day. This is just

about what the average U. S. copper miner
makes in 26' minutes of work.

Even if a pending increase goes into effect
in January, 1952, the wages_ at Chuquicamata
will be only“$1.46 per eight-hour shift and the
wages at the Andes Copper Company will be
$1.03 per shift. The wage increase, "inciden-
tally, is contingent on the passage of a new
copper tax law for which the companies have
been pressing. 6

IT‘ IS CLEAR that_ the Indi_an .;.nn..nnn.

at Chuquicamata cannot afford to buy, clothes.
According to thevrecent U. S. public Health

Service report on Industrial Hygiene‘. Problems’

in Bolivia, Peru and Chile:  .
‘,‘Many, of ~ the bare necessities ~.,of: life
such as_clothing’ are so e_xp.ensive-.~ (in
Chile) that they constitute a lujxur-y to
the average mine and factory.w.orker.
The ‘same,’ is true of many; ; ,b.as_ic, g food
supplies.” (n14) --  .;-2. 

Anaconda might try to justify=theSe;Pitifully

low wages, at Chuquicamata by claiming that

their company store, the so-called “pulperia”
sells goods to their miners at cost or below.

 

   

But it's actually the Chuquicamata -Copperiglllline, o ed by Ana‘-,

 

There is a cold selfishness, however, b'ehi_nd5
this supposed generosity. 
As the Public Health Survey noted:

“ . . . rather than raise wages so that the
miner may purchase his goods wherever

he wishes, the mining companies prefer; ..
the pulperia system ._ . . (because) work_- j I V
men’s compensation and other social se- '2
curity benefits are based on the miners’
actual wages, and do not take into con-
sideration wages in kind, such as acc , ' A
to the worker from the cheap pulperia “'
and other employer—provided ‘benefits’-.”
(page 15‘) - ' *

THERE IS A REAsoN our Indian brother‘.‘iV§§1‘.":
coughed so much. -He had silicosis and tuber- 

culosis as well.

The same Public Health Service Report de- ~
scribes the conditions of a large open-pit cop-' 
per mine-in Chile, which, from the description, 
can only be Chuquicamata. They report that-‘1. 

the Company: ‘-
' ' “  . made only a‘ slight effort to control
the silica dust exposure. The greatest
source of dust was the gyratoryi crusher
building which handled approximately
.11,0tons of"-ore per minute . . . shown is
the tremendous "amount I of dust “created
during this operation . 7. . Considerable
exposureto dust ‘wasalso present in the
open pit of the mine, ‘wpheresome 2,700_ ’ ‘
.men were employed; at the variousiseci .
ondary crushers; and _, all the way. '
through the plant up to the leaching I
vats. The dust at this mine contained. L
approximately 50 to 60 per cent silica in.  '

the‘ form of qua’rtz.”'i ( p.37 )1 — A 

It"is' no wonder he has silicosis. ‘The same
Survey reported that “15 percent . . . of 1,000,.‘ _
copper miners examined in 1946 were found to?

have silicosis.” A miner may-‘ not show ‘the.

symptoms of silicosis until several years afé -
terexposure to silica dust. And once he sgetsm‘

silicosis, he is very susceptible to tuberculosis.

It should not surprise us therefore to find the‘. 

1951 world Almanac saying that: T
Tuberculosis . . . is probably Chile’s out-
standing health problem . ’. . The death »
rate from this disease is nearly. seven’
‘times greater than the United States.” *

Nor is silicosis the only hazard, in Chuqui-
camata: 
“Serious hazards were found in the
mills and smelters . . . In addition, the ,
smelters had exposures to sulphur diox-
Iid'e, metallic fumes, and excessive‘ heat
from_ furnaces.’ The various -repair and
maintenance shops’ . . . were '2 poorly-.
equipped‘ to handle both safety and
A health hazards.” (p. 38 )" ‘

EVEN THIS CONSERVATIVE governmentfd

survey was constrained tb report the callous-A
ness of Anaconda and (Kennecott) in Chile.
They explain:” , . .' . _

. . . Perhaps this lack of health and safe-

ty consciousness on‘ the part of theslargetﬁ

concerns at least is due to the fact that_';_
until now the cost for indemnifying 
workers for accidents, or occupational
diseases has not been prohibitive.”
(Pages 38-39) ' '

Our Indian brother is not only ragged and?
sick. He is hungry. The Public Health Survey 

reports: .
“As a result of the high cost of food-
stuffs, (in Chile) 50 percent of the
workers and their families suffer from
malnutrition‘. . . coal miners have a
‘daily diet deficiency of 1,600 calories.”
(Page 1.4) A . _
When he finislheshis day’s work he goes
to a home which the public‘ Health Report
characterized as “drab, over-crowded and un-
sanitary._They frequently lack even the most

ifelementary‘ sanitary facilities.” (Page 14)

are the real power in Chile. They assumed this
power by the simple process of becoming th

“About 95 percent of the output (of
copper in Chile) is produced by three
enterprises owned by U. S. interests‘ :
and established early in the present cen- >
tury. Half of the output comes from the ‘-

The steel» wage talks
To the Editor: ‘

A group of us here were discussing
the negotiations of the Steelworkers. I

‘would liketo summarize some of the

conclusions which w e re generally
agreed on after - what ‘we ..think "was
very serious consi eration of all issues
involved. They are as follows:

1. The Steelworkers are entitled to
a Wage increase and the employers can
pay the increase out of present profits.

2. Not only the Steelworkers, but all
workers in all unions and industries
have a big stake in-these negotiations.
A victory for the Steelworkers means

a greater opportunity for all work-

‘ers to restore their living standards
’While a defeat or sellout makes the
-struggle more difficult for all of us.

3. We pledge to do what we can to
rally full support to the Steelworkers
in their fight against their employers.

The Steelworkers can feel assured that .

our International ‘officers will not as-
sist the employers by raiding as Philip
Murray did last year against the Mine-
Mill and Smelter Workers Union.

History will record this period as a .
struggle of the trade unions for their V
very ‘existence. .May‘ the .Steelworkers :

measureup to the task that presently
confronts them and be victorious. with

If all the labor unions in the world
were united into one large organiza-
tion the worker could achieve his pur-
pose much more effectively against big
business without b undergoing the red
tape involved in getting a decent con-
tract. But as long aso labor unions are
divided and misled by Green and Mur-
‘ray the prospect of such.. an idea be-
coming a reality is very slim. Of
course, if every militant union were to
unite _:in an effort to gain control of
those two labor organizations then
that would be different.

.Don't force workers to‘

. retire" at 65-—jTobin{

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Secretary or‘
_ Labor Tobin doesn't agree with the

non-ferrous metal corporation execu-
tives who say that Workers should be
forced to retire at age 65.

Tobin, in a magazine article, said

that compulsory retirement of. workers

atage 65 is a “bad-policy” at any time
and “inexcusable”. during the present
manpower shortage. “Retirement ought
to be based on a man's ability and a
man's desire, not his age,” thg cabinet
member wrote. ’

He said that compulsory retirement
policies may mean that “willing, pro-
ductive workers are cast upon the
scrap heap." And Tobin added that
social ‘security and private pension
benefits should be boosted so that a
\'...rke'1', when .he needs and wants to
retire, may do so with “happiness and
inner peace rather‘  worry. and
privation.” - . V ~‘ . I I

made by Asbury Howard, regional
director for Mine-Mill in Alabama,
at the Nogales convention last Sep-
V tember.

Convention delegates agreed that
Howard’s “Free Our Hand!" speech
was the mo_st exciting _of all in a
week that was packed with important
speeches. _‘ A

THIS IS THE SPEECH in which
Howard said: “What we workers get

V depends on our organized power; and
brothers and. sisters, it's just plain

' common sense that the workers as a
‘whole are going to have less power to
deal -with the bosses if Negro workers
and Mexican—American workers are
held down.”

Morris Wright, director of Mine-

Mill's Press & Education department,
commented: “This is not only a very
moving appeal; it is one of the clear-

est statements we have seen of the ' ,

reasons why 'liberation of the Negro
and Mexican-American peoples would
greatly increase the power of trade
unions in dealing ' with employers”

Seven out of every 10 Americans
want the “Big Three". to sit down and
negotiate peace. '

That conclusion was drawn byV the
Gallup Poll late in December, after
checking the answers to the important
question: “Would you like to see Tru-
man and.Churchill meet, with Stalin to
try to settle the differences ‘between

their countries?_” .“Yes" was the an- '

swer of 70 per_ cent. “No” was the re-

The Gallup Poll.said that of all those
questioned,’ the most typical. comment
on the idea of a meeting of the big
powers was: “Why not try" Talking
won’t hurt. And who knows? I might

- bring peace.”

MEANTIME, conservative / newspaper
columnist Dorothy Thompson com-
merited: “As long as thestrugglefor

the \international- stage, rnone. of the
great social, political and economic

problems that harass mankind, can be

solved. .  ' . V

“There is never a, conceivable point
where one side or the other possesses
adequate military force. The struggle
is the most voracious. consumer of
money, labor and resources that can be
imagined. It is wholly unproductive,»
yet perpetually dynamic. '

“The money, labor and steel that go
into the construction of an ocean liner

amortized and yield returns on the in-

  both    S. and   Condclo

The unemployment picture is get-
ting worse, both in the United States
and Canada.

With workers claiming more than a
million weeks of -unemployment-, De-
cember figures ~of’the U. S. Labor De-
partment showed that the problem of
mass job losses has gone much further
than expected by mobilization officials.

There were sharp increases in both

-the number of new claims--227,000—-

for .unemployment insurance, and the
number of iweeks of unemployment
claims—1,045,750. ‘ Continuing layoffs
in textiles, apparel and the shqe indus-
try were blamed by the Bureau of ‘Em-
ployment Security for the increases,
along with seasonal factors which af-
fected outdoor employment. \

AMONG STATES where the jobless

upturn was ‘most marked were Cali-
fornia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illi-
nois, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Maine,
New Jersey, Georgia and Massachu-
setts.‘ - V '

Employment officials point out that
the new claims are in incomplete sign

of how large the number of jobless is,—

since many workers are not covered by
the insurance program, ‘and many oth-

I * ers have used up their insurance.
