expression to the historical policy of the white ruling
class, the capitalists and landlords.

The ruling class policy is the policy‘of "divide
and rule.” They try to keep the oppressed classes
ﬁghting among themselves. They stir up native born
against foreign born, protestants against catholics, be-
lievers against non-believers, and, particularly, whites
against Negroes. They have learned that, so long
as they can keep the workers and poor farmers,
Negroes and whites, ﬁghting among themselves, they
(the capitalists) can rake in huge proﬁts and con-
tinue to rule. The moment we cast off these artiﬁcial
differences and unite our ranks, under revolutionary

leadership, their rule is doomed for all time, _and
the rule of the toilers is assured. (./lpplause.)

The rich capitalists and landlords have been most
successful in dividing the Negro and white toilers.
By a continuous and skilful propaganda they try to
convince the white workers that the Negroes are infe-
rior, that they are mentally deficient, and what not.

UNIVERSAL PERSECUTION

-This propaganda, in which all capitalist agents
join, from "respectable” college professors to the
corrupt, grafting politicians, is supplemented by the
sharpest terror and persecution against the Negroes
themselves.

Here in the North, segregation as well as many

more sly methods are used to keep the Negro "in his
place.” ‘

’In the South, residential segregation forcing the
\Tegroes into the most undesirable and unsanitary
sections, in itself sufficiently intolerable, is one of the
mildest forms of boss class persecution. Practically
complete political disfranchisement and the vicious
Jim-Crow system are everywhere enforced. Landlords
completely control the lives of their sharecroppers
through their control of the production and market-
ing of the tenants’ crops. When the Negro people

_as in Camp Hill, Alabama, rebel against these out-

rageous acts, they are put on the chain gang or
lynched. Their protests against these intolerable con-
ditions are invariably labeled as “an attack on white
womanhood” — Negroes are lynched, never, of
course, for protesting against starvation and virtual
slavery —— always it is for “rape.” (Laug/vter.)

CONDITIONS NOW INSUFFERABLE

By such terroristic methods, carried- through either
directly by or with the tacit approval of the Repub-
lican and Democratic parties, the Negro people in the
South are kept at the very bottom of the social scale.

The present crisis has increased the suffering of
the Negro people a hundredfolcl. The Negroes are
the ﬁrst to be ﬁred when lay-offs take place. The
wages of Negroes are invariably lower than those paid

11

to whites. The unemployed Negroes, far greater in
proportion than the whites, are woefully discriminat-
ed against in the payment of relief.

‘Today, more than ever before, the conditions of
the Negro people are desperate. They, more than
anyone else, feel as a burning need the realization
of the demands of the Communist Party. And the

Communist Party intends to rally the masses for V

an uncompromising war against these conditions. We
come forward here and now as the champion of the

rights of the Negro people. (Applause)
_WIPE OUT THE STENCH OF THE SLAVE MARKET!

But unfortunately the great majority of white
workers are insuﬂiciently alert to their duty. Many
are still under the miserable slave market influence
of the white capitalists and landlords. Many still
think themselves “superior.” _ They have not yet
learned, in the words of the founder of the Commu-
nist movement, Karl Marx, that “labor in a white
skin cannot emancipate itself so long as labor in a
black skin is branded.” A real ﬁghting international
solidarity —- a requirement for working class victory
— still remains to be established on a mass scale.

But the white workers, by their slowness to bring
about Negro and white working class unity, delay
their own emancipation. They cannot free themselves
from capitalist slavery without at the same time

12

  
 

bringing freedom to the Negro people. They can-
not overthrow capitalist rule without the whole-heart-
ed support of the Negro toilers. They cannot win
this support unless they stand in the very forefront
of the struggle for Negro rights.

Moreover, the white workers suffer now. The poor
white toilers are used now to aid in forcing down
the living standards of the Negroes. The poorly
paid Negroes are then used by the white bosses to
force down the standard of the white workers. In
this way the policy of race (national) division, skill-
fully used by the bosses, becomes the means of en-
slaving and impoverishing not only the Negro masses,
but the white toilers as well.

This is the meaning of the “Solid South”-—a “Solid
South” of the bosses not merel a ainst the Ne to
I O I O y g g ,

but also against the white toiling masses. The old par-
ties—Republican, Democratic and Socialist—try des-
perately to maintain this system, each in its own way.

ff

BREAK THROUGH SOLID SOUTH”

The Communist Party proposes to destroy the “Sol-
id South,” and Hoover’s Republican “Lily-White-
ism.” We propose to do this by establishing’ the ﬁght-
ing solidarity of tlk Negro and white toilers —
the workers and tenant farmers. (Applause)

We will weld an unbreakable unity between the
white workers and Negro people in the ﬁres of com-

13

mon stru le for their immediate interests. The de-
gg

mancls in the election platform of the Communist -

Party are the basis for this struggle; the election cam-
paign, with white and Negro candidates as our stand-
ard bearers, will give a tremendous impetus to our
efforts to smash through the barriers of the Southern
Jim-Crow, lynch-terror system. (/lpplause.)

Our demands for Negro rights must be boldly and
fearlessly put forward. In the North this must take
the form of the sharpest common struggle of Ne-
groes and white workers against the slightest mani-
festation of discrimination or inequality. Particularly
all hidden white chauvinist (white superiority) ten-
dencies must be burned out—~ruthlessly burned out
—of all workers’ organizations and among the mass-
es. A real unity of native born and foreign born,
of Negro and white, must be established.

OUR DEMANDS IN THE SOUTH

In the South, the fight must be fearlessly devel-
oped against the thievery and robbery of the South-
ern capitalists and landlords; against their whole sys-
tem of enslaving the Negroes based on Jim-Crowism
and lynch terror. We must fight there not merely
against inequality, but against the whole system by
which this inequality is enforced.

In the first place, our demand is that the land of
the Southern white landlords for years tilled by the

14

 

Negro tenant farmers, be conﬁscated and turned over

‘to the Negroes. This is the only way to insure eco-

nomic and social equality for the tenant farmers.

Secondly, we propose to break up the present arti-
ﬁcial state boundaries established for the convenience
of the white master class, and to establish the state
unityof the territory known as the "Black Belt,”
where the Negroes constitute the overwhelming ma-
jority of the population.

Thirclly, in this territory, we demand that the Ne-
groes be given the complete right of self-deterrnina-
tion; the right to set up their own government in
this territory and the right to separate, if they wish,
from the United States. (Applause)

Around these demands for the Negroes, as I have

‘outlined them here—with the revolutionary white

workers in the very forefront of the struggle——the

, unity of white workers, small farmers and the Negro

masses can and must be established. (/lpplause.)

NOT PROMISES; BUT. ACTION

But the Negroes have listened to many promises.
Every political faker has promised equality and free-
dom. The white workers can win the conﬁdence of

the Negro masses, not by promises, but by action. .

We must ourselves be in the forefront of the strug-
gle for Negro rights. We must ourselves jump at
the throat of the persecutors of the Negroes. We

15

1-

white workers, in the first place, must enforce the
demand-——"Death to the Lynchers!” (Applause.)

The Communist Party has demonstrated in action
that it does not merely speak for Negro rights; it
is everywhere in the forefront of the actual struggle
to force the granting of real equality now for the
Negro people. This has been shown in the Scotts-
boro case, it has been shown in hundreds of other
cases in all sections of the country.

Comrades, in conclusion, as a further step incon-
vincing the masses of the revolutionary sincerity of
the Communist Party in the ﬁght for equality for
the Negro people, I propose that we endorse as our

candidate for Vice-President, a Negro worker. I
have a candidate to propose—‘-a candidate longiactive
in the revolutionary working class movement——an ex-
serviceman, a member of the Trade Union Unity

League, a memberof the Communist Party. This : C
candidate knows the lynchers. His own grandfather

was lynched by the Southern bosses. He has long
been a most active ﬁghter against the enslavement
of his people. i '

I wish to nominate for Vice-President of the

United States, as our running mate with William Z.

Foster, this leader in the struggle for the emancipa-

i tion of the toilers——white and Negro-—]ames

Who Are the Friends of
the Negro People?

By C. A. HATHAWAY

SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE NATIONAL NOMINATING
CONVENTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY PROPOS-
ING JAMES W. FORD OF ALABAMA FOR VICE-PRESI-
DENT OF THE UNITED STATES

Comrades, Fellow Workers and Friends:

I have been entrusted with a signiﬁcant task by
the committee which you selected this morning to
propose national candidates to this evening’s session
of our convention.

Your committee, after thorough consideration, has
decided unanimously to recommend an action never
before taken by any national political party.

We propose that this convention choose, as its
candidate for Vice-President of the United States,
a Negro 12/or/<er—-a leader of the oppressed Negro
people. (Ovation and prolonged applause.)

The Negro comrade, whom we will propose, will,
in our opinion, make a strong running mate for
William Z. Foster, whom you have so en-
thusiastically acclaimed as your candidate for
President. (Applause)

N0 VOTE-CATCHING MOTIVE

We make this proposal, comrades, not with any
cheap vote-catching motive. In fact, a great number
—prohably a majority of the Negro people, who
might be won for’ the Communist platform and can-
didates, are viciously and illegally denied the right to
vote. And surely, if mere vote-catching were our
aim, we would not ﬂy in the face of the strong anti-
Negro sentiment so carefully stimulated among the
masses by the white ruling class.

No, comrades, vote-catching is not our motive.

It is true, though, that we have a very deﬁnite
motive in proposing a Negro worker as our candidate

  

for Vice-President of the United States. That motive ,

is the desire to clearly and forcefully bring forward
the fundamental position of the Communist Party,

 

and of those workers who support the Communist '

Party, on the Negro question.

The Communist Party stands squarely for complete
and unconditional equality for the Negro people.
(Applause.) We do not propose equality in some
narrow and limited sense. We do not say that ,the
Negro is all right "in his place.” We say that any
place open to the whites must be opened for the
Negroes. We stand unequivocally for full political,
economic and, especially — we emphasize —- social
equality. (Applause.)

 

 

 1-K.

FOR THE NEGRO’S RIGHT TO vow

We are against the political disfranchisement of
the colored ‘people, and categorically demand their
right to vote, hold oﬂice, and serve on juries in the
East and West, North and South. (Applause)

We are against the present practice of assigning
Negro workers to the dirtiest and heaviest jobs in
industry, of ﬁring the Negroes ﬁrst when lay-oﬁcs take
place, and of paying colored workers lower wages
than are paid to whites. We demand for the Negro
toilers the same treatment as that won by the white
workers on the jobs.

We are against all laws — without exception —
which discriminate against Negroes, including segre-
gation, Jim-Crow and inter-marriage laws. We de-
mand the repeal of all such laws and the breaking
down of all practices which force an unequal position
upon the Negro people.

We are uncompromisingly against the lynch terror
constantly hanging as a threat over the Negro people;
we call upon the masses of workers and poor farmers
to enforce the Communist demand—"Deat/2 to the
Lync/very!” (Applause.)-

Finally, comrades, we call upon the colored and
white toilers to stand shoulder to shoulder in the ﬁght
to win suc/7 equality for the Negro people now.’ A
solid, unbreakable ﬁghting front of all toilers, Negro
and white, can smash the vicious, Whlte ruung-class

system of Jim-Crowism and lynch terror. Such ﬁght-
ing unity is an absolute requirement for the victorious
advance of all toilers, white as well as N egro, in their
struggle against capitalist oppression and exploitation.

It is because we wish to bring these issues clearly
and forcefully before the toiling masses that we pro-
pose to select a leader of the oppressed Negro people
- a Negro worker — as one of the heads of our
national ticket. (/lpplause.)

OLD PARTIES PERSECUTE NEGROES

This clearly deﬁned position of the Communist
Party is quite dilierent from that of all other parties
— Republican, Democratic or Socialist. Each of
these parties attempts to side-track or straddle this
question in its election platform and speeches.
Meaningless, ﬂowery phrases and kind words are art-
fully designed to conceal their real, deep-seated ha-
tred for the Negro people. Before elections the Ne-
gro people are led to believe that a vote for these
fakers will improve their position. After the elec-
tions Republican, Democratic or Socialist Party poli-
ticians in office become the persecutors, oppressors
and lynchers of the colored people. Their lying prom-
ises before elections are most deceitful, under‘-handed
eﬂiorts to bag the Negroes’ votes.

The Democratic Party, historically, is the party
of the miserable slave traders and slave holders. It

6

is now the party of the Southern white landowners
and the white capitalists. It is most responsible for
the present misery and persecution of the colored
people. To this day it still stinks of the slave pen
and auction block. In the South, where it bars Ne-
gro voters from its primaries, it proudly welcomes the
support of t-he Ku Klux Klan murderers. Does any-
one think that ﬂowery platform phrases can destroy
the stench of such a record? (Applausex) No mat-
ter who the Democrats select as their standard bear-
ers, no matter what they say in their platform, no
thinking person could ever be made to believe that
this party is anything other than the bitterest enemy
of the Negro people. (Applause)

The Republican Party, which for years successfully
exploited Lincoln as the “Great Emancipator”—a ti-
tle acquired merely as a by-product of the Civil
War to establish the supremacy of the rising capi-
talist class over the decaying landlord class of the
South — is, like the Democrats’, a party of “White
Supremacy.” Under I-*Ioover’s administration espe-
cially, “Lily-Whiteism” has been openly avowed and
enforced. Negro politicians — long loyal hench-
men of the white Republican leaders — have been
removed from all important political appointments
and assigned to mean and dirty jobs not wanted by
white job-seekers. Negro politicians have been shelv-
ed and, when there were not enough white Republi-

 SOCIALIST PARTY LIES
1

p No party lies more brazenly on the Negro question _
‘ than the Socialist Party. At their recent Milwaukee
convention they adopted a plank in their platform
‘ as follows: "The enforcement of Constitutional
guarantees of economic, political and legal equality
for the Negro.” This might ‘sound excellent. But
what does it mean? Does this mean the full and un-
conditional equality demanded by the Communists?
Does it include the right of self-determination in
the Black Belt? Decidedly not! It limits the
“equality for the Negro” to “legal”. equality — to
the "equality” granted by the bitterest enemies of the
Negroes — the Republicans and Democrats. It does . ; "f\
not propose new “Constitutional guarantees.” It ' 7 “A
does not propose social equality. It does not include

8

 

the right of self-determination. It does not propose
a struggle for equal rights; such a struggle they
invariably shy away from with the boss-class howl

I about the “danger of race riots.” It proposes only

the -enforcement of existing laws. And even this
is a" lie — a lie to deceive the Negro people. As proof
of this statement I ; _ ote from an article by one of
the Socialist Partyﬁlteladers, from one who was a

‘ member of the Platform Committee at the Milwau-

kee convention, Heywood Broun. In an article in

the New -r=.Wbi}ld—T2l€gfa1h";*h

f I were a candidate for high, or judiciary
ice, I would say, even without being cornered,
hat I would not now sanction the eﬁorts to en-
orce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
the Constitution 0 the United Statgsji. '

How can one estimate a political party which one
day declares emphatically that it would not enforce
the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, and the
next day—in order to catch ‘Votes-—declares for “en-
forcement”? This proves the Socialist Party guilty of
the most impudent political deception. (Applause)

"DIVIDE AND RULE”

In carrying out such policies——policies which sys-
tematically stimulate race division and race hatred-
these parties, each in their own way, are only giving
