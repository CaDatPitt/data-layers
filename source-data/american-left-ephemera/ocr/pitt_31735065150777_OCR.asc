WASHINGTON, D. C.-—
Washington heard from
you last week. Some 125
spokesmen for your union
were all over‘ Capitol Hill,
talking to Senators, Repre-
sentatives and federal
agency executives. They

were lobbying for the
’ Mine-Mill program —- jobs,

relief, stop-the-union-bust
ing.

I EVERY MAJOR AREA;

of our union in the United
States was represented
-ere. Twenty senators and
34 representatives were
visited in their offices. In
almost every case, our
spokesmen got a friendly
reception and commitments
on some issues.

FIRST RESULT of the
Mine-Mill lobby was action
in New Mexico toward get-
ting federal surplus foods
to destitute families of un-
employed miners and mill-
men in the Bayard area.
Lead-zinc mines there have
been shut down for a year
and a half; compensation
has run out; so has local

relief.

ON JUNE 24,'three days
after our lobby started
here, a meeting was held

of the New Mexico Wel-V

fare Commission 'n Silver

City near Bayard to take.

the steps necessary to get

. surplus foods stored in fed-

eral warehouses. ‘

Action urged on all‘Sen-
ators and Representatives
included: i

0 Support the Murray-

‘ Metcalf premium price
plan bills to create more
jobs in‘ the metals in-
dustry;  >

0 Help us’ get surplus
foods for the unem-
ployed in Grant County,
New Mexico;

0 Oppose the GOP’s Fer-
guson-Reid bills, McCar-
ran’s S 23, and all other
union-wreckin'g meas-
ures; ‘

0 Construction of dams,
roads, schools, hospitals
and other needed public
works;

0 Stop the give-away of
public resources to pri-
vate industry.

0 Legislation to recognize
silicosis as an industrial-
disease and provide ade-
quate compensation for
silicosis.

clo Steel union settles

Steel industry negotiations
for 1954 were concluded on June
29 when the United Steelwork-
ers-CIO Wage Policy Commit-
tee voted to accept a U. S. Steel

Corporation offer known"to in- ~

elude a five-cent wage increase,
improved pension and health

: and welfare benefits.

Full details on the settlement
were not available as this paper
was going to press. Thisfmuch,
though, was known:

1. There was a general wage
increase of five cents an hour.
In addition, southern workers
were to receive an extra two
and a half cents an hour to re-

duce the existing differential

between steelworkers in the
South and in the rest of the
country. '

2. The‘ company agreed to
increase its contributions -to the
medical insurance plan by two
cents an hour, and workers also
were to increase their contribu-
tions by the same amount. At

gpresent the company and. work-

ers each pay two and a half

cents an hour for these bene-~

fits. Under the new agreement
benefits ar-e supposed to be in-
creased and both the company
and workers will increase their
contributions to four and a half
cents per hour.

A 3. Pension benefits will be in-
creased. The amount of the new
benefits was not reported, al-

though it was reported that, I

-’’just before the final agreement,

HIGHER WAGES were the subject on the floor as this picture was taken of the- Mine-Mill Washington

for 5c, other benefits,  p

pany offer to-—-raise minimum

pension benefits for 30-year.

workers to $140 a in-ontlr. Pre-
sumably, therefore, the new
minimum benefits will be $130
a month or better.“ _
While’ the Steelworkers pub-
licly valued ‘the settlement as
wort-h»“12 cents an hour,” other
sources were more conservative.
Company "spokesmen said that
it was difficult to place a value

on the total package because of .

the cost the new pension
benefits ‘will vary much from
plant to plant. The Wall Street

Journal estimated that the final.

settlement r was worth about
9 or_‘10 cents. , '

CHICAGO - Amalgamated
Local 758 has concluded a first

contract with General Alumi-

num Products Co. here. This
plant was recently organized

in a three-week period by a :

group of workers including sev-

eral who had been members of '

Local 758 in other shops.
No labor board election was

held, since the plant was or-

ganized on_ a policy of unifying
the workers to win without the
delay and litigation. of Eisen-
hower labor‘-board proceedings.
When the workers stood firm’
during a week of lockout by the
company, the "management de-

cided to settle and a good \con-
tract was arrived at.

‘ The contract provides a 12c ‘
general

wage increase‘, with
several of the workers getting
“inequity” increases of 17c_;
full seniority; a union shops‘
and other benefits. The settle-
ment also included payment to
each worker of a week’s wages
to cover the period of the lock-
o t. .

yy"  Here in El Paso, we have seen
:' '   the most vicious-effortis to split and
‘destroy our Union, but we defeated
these efforts. The anti-union forces
‘of this community had hoped that
- the trial of Clint Jencks held here
In El Paso would have the effect of»
making our members runfor cover
om the smear campaigns in the
local press. But our members didn't
run-—_—and they won the fight to
eep an honest union in ‘El Paso.
The effort to destroy our union
<ln»El ‘Paso has been only a small
‘ part ‘of the campaign against our
. union. but it will fail iust as it did
here. And in this connection, we
understand how important it is for
us to defend Brother Jencks. lf they
get Brother Clint Jencks. we know
_ none of us is safe. Brother glencks‘
 --,-...,_..l has spent most of his adult life
- ,. fighting forlthe rights of Mexican-
American workers. and we,,d‘on't
intend to forget this service. »The
fight to‘ keep Jencks out of iail is
the fight of every honestrunion man

’ BAYARD. N. M.—Local 890 is
fighting in, every way"possiblo
to prevent the re-iailing of six
strike leaders. Every public‘of-
ficial who might. influence Gov-

delegation. including,women of

Catholic Church. has gone to San-
ta Fe to see the Governor and
urge clemency. or at least that

Jencks is an attack against our
entire Union.-and it is a result of
the militant, fighting spirit of our
Grganization. If vie allow the anti-
labor'b‘osses to railroad Brother
Jencks. every one of us who has the

This is why l believe I must fight

that Jencks had/fought discrimina-

that he was _for“better housing for

Jencks was found guilty cf wanting
a better life for all workers, and

dot doing something about it. Well,

all guilty, because this is the pro- '

FROM the ‘county jail at Sil-

six issued this statement:

“No contempt of court was
ever intended by us. ‘Instead, it
was Empire Zinc which refused
to bargain with the union, and
took action to break a peaceful,
legal strike. Usually a company
drops any legaldisputes coming:
out of astrike, but Empire,,true

’to form, would not hear of it.
This being,/the.case, if we must
be jailed for our defense of the

strike, we are willing to pay the

penalty.-”

 B While they were impressed with the un1on’s_uI‘g'i1‘-8
' A that the government must do something effective about
:  the metals industry, McKay and Wormser admitted that
A stockpiling is all we have now, and.it’ is not going to
 A " make a big difference. M
Wormser, a former official of St. Joseph Lead Com-

pany, said that subsidies, as proposed in the’ MurI;«':lYf
"Metcalf bills, would be “unfair to the big companies --

apparently because the subsidies would help keep’ the .

little companies going.
Members of the delegation reported that McKay is
smarting ‘under the widespread criticism of his policies;
‘ especially the give-away of public resources to big‘
_l business." ‘ A . ,- ' ' i V
