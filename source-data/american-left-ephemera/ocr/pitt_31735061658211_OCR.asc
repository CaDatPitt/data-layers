WELCIIME HOME

On behalf of the National Commit-
tee of our Party I want to welcome
you back into our ranks. We are
conﬁdent that you will take your place
to help rebuild our Party into a ﬁght-
ing Communist Party of action and
struggle, a Party worthy of the name
Communist.

A host of urgent tasks face the
American working class and our na-
tion. » The defeat of the plans of
American imperialism for world do-
mination, its reactionary intervention
in China and in the European demo-
cracies, its ruinous course of weaken-
ing Big Three unity, which as you
know is the sole guarantee of world
peace, requires the maximum mobili-
zation of all our forces and energies.
The defeat of the plans of American
reaction to smash the unions and drive
down living standards, the struggle
for equal rights for the Negro people,
for jobs, security, housing and adequate
living standards for all, against dis-
crimination and anti—Semitism, are
some of the tasks on the home front
around which our Party must mobil-
ize the American working class and
other democratic forces, without so

, much as a moment’s delay. And pre-

cisely because any one of these tasks
is such as to tax all the strength of our
small Party, it is a matter of prime
necessity that you retake your post at
once.

You know that during your absence,
revisionism had our Party in its grip.
It is the aim of this compilation to
show you how our Party overwhelm-
ingly repudiated Browderism. We are
now recuperating from this deadly
illness with which Browderism in-
fected us. But the harmful effects of
this period in the life of our Party are
to be seen everywhere, and much must

     

still be done to eliminate every rem-
nant of revisionism in our thinking,
in our habits, in the life of our organ-
ization. Much, very much, must still
be done to rebuild our Party from the
ground up, transforming our member-
ship into an active ﬁghting member-
ship; transforming our clubs, both our
community and shop organizations,
into live centers of Communist mass
work. For this we need the best ef-
forts of all Communists and your own
contributions are especially vital and
important.

There rests on you however a special
responsibility. You are not an ordinary
veteran, but a Communist veteran.
This means that you understand the
need of establishing a firm alliance be-
tween the veterans and the American
labor movement. Reaction is hard at
work to win the veterans against la-
bor. We must immediately cement
the ties between the trade unions and

the veterans. We must organize both,

for joint struggle in behalf of their
common problems. In addition to your
other tasks, you have the special re-
sponsibility to help our Party inﬂuence
the thinking and actions of the veterans
and labor to bring about that power-
ful unity of labor, the veterans, the
Negro people and other exploited sec-
tions of the population which alone
can defeat the reactionaryv schemes of
American monopoly capitalism.

There is a world of work to be done.
There are struggles to be organized
wherever you turn. Our Party must
be built into an organization many
times its present size. This critical
moment demands our maximum ef-
forts. Let us get to work, and without
delay.

Comradely yours,
WILLIAM Z. FOSTER.

THE NATIONAL CDMMIIIIEE  

SUBMITTED IANUARY 20, 1944

To THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
COMMITTEE, C.P.U.S.A.,

Dear Comrades:

In Comrade Browder’s report to the
recent meeting of the National Com-
mittee, which was adopted as our
Party’s policy, there are, in my opinion,
a number of serious errors which must
be corrected. After listening to Com-
rade Browder’s report, of which I had
previously seen only some parts, I
placed my name on the speakers’ list
to reply to the proposals that he had
made. However, several Polburo mem-
bers urged that I should not make the
speech, arguing that it would cause
confusion in the party and that further
Polburo discussions would clarify the
situation. So I refrained from voicing
my objections at the time, proposing
instead to take them up in the Polburo.
As I consider Comrade Browder’s
errors to be of an important nature,
I feel myself duty bound to express
my opinions to the National Commit-
tCC.

In his report Comrade Browder, in
attempting to apply the Teheran de-
cisions to the United States, drew a
perspective of a smoothly working na-
tional unity,‘ including the decisive

sections of American ﬁnance capital,

not only during the war but also in
the postwar; a unity which (with him
quoting approvingly from Victory-
And After), would lead to “a rapid

 

healing of the terrible wounds‘ of the
war” and would extend on indeﬁnitely,
in an all-class peaceful collaboration,
for a “long term of years.” In this
picture, American imperialism virtu-

ally disappears, there remains ‘hardly

a trace of the class struggle, and So-
cialism plays practically no role what-
ever.

In his Bridgeport speech, Comrade
Browder said that “Old formulas and
old prejudices are going to be of no
use whatever to us as guides to ﬁnd
our way in the new world.” But this
must not cause us to lose sight of some
of the most basic principles of Marx-
ism-Leninism.

It seems to me that Comrade Brow-
der’s rather rosy outlook for capitalism
is based upon two errors. The first
of these is an underestimation of the
deepening of the crisis of world capi-
talism caused by the war. When ques-
tioned directly in Polburo discussion,
Comrade Browder agreed that capital-
ism has been seriously weakened by
the war, but his report would tend to
give the opposite implication. The im-
pression is left that capitalism has
somehow been rejuvenated and is now
entering into a new period of expan-
sion and growth. Characteristically, he
says that there is general agreement
that there is “no valid reason why the
same (American—-—W.Z.F.) economy,
including agriculture, should not pro-
duce at approximately the same level

 

 

  

  
   
 
 
 
    
  
 
   
    
  
    
  
    
  
 
 
    
 
  
   
    
 

(as during the war—-W.Z.F.), and that
no plan is worth considering that pro-
ceeds from any other basis.” Contrary
to this picture of a ﬂourishing, easily
recovering capitalism, I would say, the
reality is a badly weakened world
capitalist system, whose weakness will
also be felt in postwar United States.
The problems of reconstruction, in this
country and especially in devastated
Europe, will be gigantic, and, in the
long run, insoluble under capitalism.
This is not to say, however, that there
may not be a temporary postwar eco-
nomic boom in some countries and
possibly also an increase in the pro-
ductive forces. It does assert, however,
that the gravity of the postwar recon-
struction will not admit of any such
easy solution as Comrade Browder
seems to imply.

The second basic error in Comrade
. Browder’s report is the idea that the
main body of American ﬁnance capital
is now or can be incorporated into the
national unity necessary to carry out
the decisions of the Teheran Confer-
ence in a democratic and progressive
spirit. It is true that Comrade Browder
sometimes makes modest estimates of
the extent of the sections of monopoly
capital that he hopes will go along in
the democratic camp in fulﬁlling the
decisions of Teheran in their interna-
tional and national implications. He
says, for example, that “Such an ap-
proach is correct even if it should‘ turn
out that we ﬁnd no allies there.” But
obviously he is making policy calling
for new relations between two whole
classes, the working class and the capi-
talist class. That he is calculating upon
the bulk of ﬁnance capital being won
for the proposals he outlined is clear
from many indications, including the

 

6 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

great stress he lays upon the symbol of
Browder shaking hands with Morgan
and by the fact that he forsees no
serious opposition by big capital in “the
long term of years” of peaceful col-
laboration which he sees ahead.

This great optimism as to the pro-
gressive stand of big business in back-
ing the war and in working out the
reconstruction problems is quite un-
founded. The enforcement of the Te-
heran decisions, both in their national
and international aspects, demands the

broadest possible national unity, and

in this national unity there must be
workers, farmers, professionals, small

businessmen and all of the capitalist.

elements who will loyally support the
program. But to assume that such
capitalists, even if we should include
the Willkie supporters, constitute the
decisive sections of ﬁnance capital, or
can be extended to include them, is to
harbor a dangerous illusion. The fact
is, as I shall develop at length later,
the great body of American ﬁnance cap-
ital is following a line contrary to a
democratic and progressive interpreta-
tion of Teheran, and in all probability
will continue to do so.

The only way a national unity could
be made with the main forces of
American ﬁnance capital, and this is
most emphatically true of the postwar
period, would be upon a basis incom-
patible with a democratic realization
of Teheran. Such a national unity
would be necessarily one under the
hegemony of big capital, and in the
long run it would fail in realizing the
line laid down at the Teheran Con-
ference. The plain fact, and we must
never lose sight of it, is that American
big capital cannot be depended upon
to cooperate with the workers and

 

 

  

LETTER TO THE “NATIONAL COMMITTEE ‘:7

other classes in carrying out the deci-
sions of Teheran, .much less lead the
nation in doing ‘so. ‘

C The error of Comrade Browder is
precisely the false assumption that they
can be so depended upon. He thinks
(Bridgeport speech) that the big capi-
talists fall within the scope of “the
intelligent people of the world, the
united moral forces of‘ Britain, America
and the Soviet Union,” who are ﬁght-
ing for a new and better world. Con-
tradicting his own correct statement in
his report that the working people are
the main base of the Teheran sup-
porters, he makes various proposals that
appear to go in the direction of ex-
pecting a progressive lead from the
monopolists. This is indicated, for ex-
ample, by his praise of the postwar

program of the National Association

of Manufacturers, and by his looking
hopefully to the big capitalists to bring
forward plans for doubling the work-
ers’ wages in the postwar period. It is
also shown by his agreement with the
N.A.M. that in the question of foreign
trade “the government should go no

‘ further in this direction than the export-

capitalists themselves demand,” which
would put the monopolists in full con-
trol of this vitalmatter. He says further
that he would put no more curbs on
the monopolists than they themselves
see the need for, which would indeed
be an ideal situation for the monopo-
lists.

Comrade Browder’s misconception
as to the progressive role of monopoly
capital in the postwar period is further

indicated by his playing down the

initiative of the workers in formulating
proposed governmental economic poli-
cies and his looking for programs
rather to the big employers, “who must

ﬁnd the solution in order to keep their
plants in operation.” There are also
his ﬂat acceptance of the two-party
system, his indefiniteness as to what
forces constitute reaction in the United
States, his understress on the national
election struggle, and his curt dismissal
of the whole question of Socialism.
Characteristic of Comrade Browder’s
new conception of the progressive char-
acter, if not the actual leading role of
monopoly capital, is the way he states

the method of arriving at a national ~

economic program, putting the capi-
talists ﬁrst and the workers second.
He says such a program must “rouse a
minimum of opposition, from at least

the two most decisive groups: ﬁrst, the

business men, industrial and ﬁnance
capitalists and their managers, who

have effective direction of the nation’s_

economy; and second, the working
class, organized labor and the farmers.”
This is putting the cart before the
horse.

The danger in this whole point of
view is that, in our eagerness to secure
support for Teheran, we may walk
into the trap of trying to cooperate
with the enemies of Teheran, or even
of falling under their inﬂuence. Trail-
ing after the big bourgeoisie is the
historic error of Social-Democracy, and
we must be vigilantly on guard against
it. Our task, instead of pursuing illusory
plans of creating a national unity to
include the body of monopoly capital,
is, therefore, to understand thatxiin
order to realize the plans and hopes of
Teheran, we have to rally the great
popular masses "of the peoples and to
resist the forces of big capital now,
during the war, and that, also, we will
have to curb their power drastically in
the postwar period. This policy is‘ -a

fundamental condition for success of
Teheran and all it means to the world.
When Roosevelt and Wallace single
out the monopolists for attack, as they

often do, they are sounding not only

a popular, but also a correct note.

MONOPOLY CAPITAL AND
THE TEHERAN DECISIONS

Among the major objectives estab-
lished by the Teheran decisions are
(a) the development of all-out coali-
tion warfare for complete victory over
the enemy; (b) an orientation toward
an eventual democratic world organi-
-zation of peoples to maintain inter-
national peace and order; (c) an im-
plied unfoldment of an elementary
economic program with which to meet
-the terriﬁc problems of postwar recon-
struction. In carrying out these objec-
tives, ample experience and plain real-
ism teach us that American ﬁnance
capital is a very reluctant cooperator,
indeed, with the bulk of the American
people, not to speak of its being their
progressive leader.

Take ﬁrst the matter of an all-out
military policy. In this respect Ameri-
can monopoly capital has indeed given
anything but a patriotic lead thus far
or a convincing promise for the future.
The patriotic lead, on the contrary,
has come, and will continue to come
from the national unity elements
grouped mainly around the Roosevelt
forces. So far as the bulk of ﬁnance
capital is concerned, starting out with
a pre-war record of appeasement, it
has, all through the war, followed a
course of rank proﬁteering and often
outright sabotage of both the domestic
and foreign phases of the nation's war
program, especially the former. While
these elements obviously do not _want

 

the United States to lose the war, they
are certainly very poor defenders of
the policy. of unconditional surrender.
In the main, their idea of a satisfactory
outcome of the war would be some
sort of a negotiated peace with German
reactionary forces, and generally to
achieve a situation that would put a
wet blanket on all democratic develop-
ments in Europe. All this still remains
a serious obstacle to full victory. A
real victory policy, as laid down at
Teheran, can be achieved only in oppo-
sition to these elements, certainly not
in easy collaboration with them, and
above all, not under their leadership.

As to the creation of a world organi-
zation to maintain the postwar peace,
as outlined at the Moscow and Teheran
meetings, American ﬁnance capitalists,
in the main, are equally unreliable.
All through the war they ha.ve been
saturated with anti-British and anti-
Soviet tendencies. They were literally
shoved into their dubious endorsement
of Teheran by heavy mass pressure.
They probably would accept some sort
of an after-war world organization to
maintain peace, but certainly not one
as contemplated by the signers of the
Teheran and Moscow pacts. At best
it would be a kind of a touch-and-go
proposition calculated not to interfere
with the active imperialist maneuver-
ings they have in mind. So far, the
real pressure and leadership in the
United States for a democratic world
organization of states has come, not
from the main forces of ﬁnance capital,
but from the broad masses of the
people, and there is no reason to sup-
pose that this situation will alter in
the foreseeable future.

Regarding the development of a co-

operative world economic program of .

 

 

LETTER TO THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE 9

reconstruction after the war, as Teheran
obviously foresees, American ﬁnance
capital again would indeed be a shaky
reed to lean upon. While the great
capitalists of this country would prob-
ably accept some elementary program
to encourage world trade and also
would provide a niggardly program of
emergency relief, their guiding prin-
ciple would be to grab off whatever
they could of the world market. That
is about all the signiﬁcance they would
attach to epoch—making Teheran. It
is idle to think that they would come
forward with a broad economic plan
based upon the true interest of our
nation and the world. The United
States is not Czechoslovakia or Greece.
It is not even Great Britain. Despite
its war injuries, which are much more
serious than appears at first glance,
it will nevertheless emerge from this
war by far the most powerful capitalist
nation in the world. And its great in-
dustrial rulers will not be inclined to
make such concessions to the peoples’
interests as is now being done by the
capitalists of some occupied countries,
who are even ' accepting Communists
in the Cabinets. American ﬁnance capi-
tal has not been seriously chastened by
the war. It does not consider this war
as a world defeat for monopoly capital
(which it doubtless is) after which.its
job will be to assume a responsible
attitude toward the world capitalist
system and to work out a progressive
domestic program with democratic
forces. It is strong, greedy and aggres-
sive.

When American capitalism looks out
upon the postwar world it will see
mostly that its great capitalist rivals
have been badly disabled by the war,

‘and its imperialistic appetite will be

whetted. Germany, Iapan, Italy, France
and many other capitalist countries will
be prostrate by the war’s end, and
Great Britain also will be much weak-
ened. While American big capitalism
acutely fears Socialism, it nevertheless
considers that the U.S.S.R., facing a
gigantic problem of internal reconstruc-
tion, will not be an insuperable obstacle
to its plans of imperialistic expansion.
Altogether, it seems principally an al-
luring opportunity to conquer markets
and strategic positions, and we may
trust the Wall Street moguls not to
overlook this chance. The Teheran
Conference by no means liquidated
American imperialism. A postwar
Roosevelt Administration would con-
tinue to be, at it is now, an imperialist
government, but one with a certain
amount of liberal checks upon it. An
election victory of the Republican Party,
the chosen party of monopoly capital,
would mean, however, imperialism of
a far more aggressive type. Comrade
Browder goes too far when he says
that world capitalism and world So-
cialism have learned to live peacefully
together and (in his Bridgeport speech)
that “Britain and the United States
have closed the books ﬁnally and for-
ever upon their old expectation that
the Soviet Union as a Socialist country
is going to disappear some day.” The
fruition of such an attitude on the part
of these capitalist countries is depen-
dent upon the extent to which demo-
cratic support is built up for Teheran
and its perspective.

In my article in the New Masses,
December 14, 1943, I gave a brief
summary picture of about what we
could expect from American ﬁnance
capital in the_ postwar period, given
the strong control that a Republican

 

   
 
   
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
   
   
   
  
    
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

 

10 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

victory would bring it. It would en-
danger the whole setup and program
of Teheran:

A Republican Administration
would encourage reaction all over the

-. world. Rampant American imperial-
ism again in the saddle would weak-
en the foundations of the United
Nations and sow seeds for a World
War III. Such an Administration

would not insist upon unconditional

surrender, it would not extinguish
fascism in Europe or establish de-
mocracy; it would not collaborate
loyally with the USSR or Great
Britain; it would degenerate our
Good Neighbor policy in Latin
America. A . Nor could Willkie
as President, even if he wanted to,
substantially alter this basically re-
actionary course of the Republican
Party.

The important sections of the capi-
talists who support Wendell Willkie
incline somewhat more to a liberal
application internationally of the Te-
heran policies, although Willkie’s stand
on Poland was not very promising.
Their basic kinship with the bulk of
ﬁnance capital and their willingness to
follow its main international and do-

;mestic policies, however, are indicated

by, their common, all-out hatred of
Roosevelt and by the practical certainty
that they will, in the event that Willkie
does not get the Republican nomina-
tion, support any other Republican
candidate, unless possibly it should be
some outright fascist or isolationist,
such as Colonel McCormick. The weak-
ness in our own attitude toward the
Willkie forces has been to stress too
much their more superﬁcial liberal ten-
dencies and not enough the more basic

 

fact that they are part of the camp of
reaction and that they constantly tend
to lure the workers away from the
Roosevelt progressive line into the trap
of the Republican Party. The Willkie-
ites will accept the reactionary line of
the Hoovers, Tafts and Deweys, rather
than join with the masses of the peo-
ple to fight these reactionaries.

All of which means that the bulk
of monopoly capital cannot be relied
upon either to cooperate loyally, or
to lead in a progressive application of
the Teheran decisions. It will yield
in this direction only under democratic
mass pressure. Instead, our reliance
must be upon the great democratic
people, the real backbone of national
unity, now organized in the main in
and around the Roosevelt camp. The
basic ﬂaw in Comrade Browder’s re-
port was that he failed to make clear
this elementary situation, but instead
tended to create illusions to the effect
that these antagonistic forces, the bulk
of big capital and the democratic sec-
tions of the nation, now locked to-
gether in one of the sharpest class
battles in American history, can and
should work harmoniously together
both now and during the postwar
period.

NATIONAL UNITY
IN THE ELECTIONS

Following logically his argumenta-

i tion to the effect that the decisive sec-

tions of monopoly capital are, or can
be drawn, not only in “the democratic-
progressive camp” for the realization

of the Teheran decisions, but may also

be the leaders of that camp, Comrade
Browder gave little emphasis indeed
to the bitter Presidential election strug-
gle now developing. For, certainly, if

   

 

 

LETTER TO THE NATIOISTAL COMMITTEE II

the decisive sections of American mo-
nopoly capital are behind the Teheran
decisions loyally, and indeed may lead
the national unity, there would be little
to worry about regarding the outcome
of the elections. It would make little
difference which side won. Comrade
Browder did not sound any note of
alarm about the elections. He did not
warn the American people militantly
of the grave danger that would be in-
volvediin a Republican victory. Instead,

in his National Committee report, he

handled the two major parties almost
in a tweedle—dee, tweedle-dum manner,_
and in his Madison Square Garden
speech, where he presented the Party
line to the public, he devoted only
twelve lines to the vital subject of the

” elections. Logically following out his

general position, he seemed rather to
be more interested in bridging the gap
between the two warring parties in
the name of‘ an all-inclusive national
unity, than in stirring into victory ac-
tion the great democratic forces of the
country, the only ones who can be
relied upon to make the hope of Te-
heran real.

Let us consider the elections a little
more in detail. Brieﬂy, the situation is
this; during the eleven years of the
Roosevelt Administration; monopoly
capital has, of course, remained domi-
nant; its proﬁts have gone right on,
and it has also very greatly increased
its concentration and strength, particu-
larly during the war period. Neverthe-
less, monopoly capital has found an
obstacle in the Roosevelt Administra-
tion. This Administration is, in fact, if
not formally, a coalition among the
workers, middle class elements, and
the more liberal sections of the bour-
geoisie (with the special situation in

the Democratic South). The big mo-

nopolists, after the ﬁrst few emergency,

months of 1933, have in overwhelming
majority come to ‘hate the Roosevelt
Administration bitterly. They espe-
cially attack the domestic angles of his

policies. What backing Roosevelt had

from ﬁnance capital at the. start has
mostly leaked away from him. This is

"because of certain restrictions his Ad-

ministration has placed upon big capi-
tal’s drive for unlimited power. The
monopolists hate the Roosevelt Gov-
ernment because it' is not an instru-
ment that will do their bidding fully
and immediately; they hate it because
of the social legislation it has written
on the books and also for what it
threatens to adopt during a fourth
term; they hate it because it has facili-
tated the organization of ten million
workers into trade unions, which weak-
ened their great open shop fortress in
the basic industries; they hate it because
they think there, is altogether too great
a democratic content -in its war and
foreign policies.

The substance of the present ‘elec-
tion struggle, therefore, is an attempt
of monopoly capital to break up the
Roosevelt liberal-labor combination. It
is an eﬁfort of the big ﬁnancial tycoons
to get rid of the governmental and
trade union hindrances that have irked
them so much under the New Deal,
so they can branch out into the active
irnperialistic regime they have in mind.
They are fighting Roosevelt viciously,
trying to defeatihim in his own party
with their Farleys and Southern poll-

12 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

they are having trouble to decide upon
a candidate of their own, they are
nevertheless united in opposing Roose-
velt. The fact that 90 per cent of the
daily press and all the leading employ-
ers’ associations and conservative farm-
ers’ organizations are deﬁnitely opposed
to Roosevelt, tells graphically where
ﬁnance capital is standing in this cru-
cial election struggle. Its victory would
be understood all over the world as
a victory for reaction. The fascists and
every other enemy of Teheran in the
United States and abroad would hail
it as their triumph.

In this most crucial election since
1864 our duty as a Communist Party
is plain. We must go all-out for a con-
tinuation of the Roosevelt policies, as
the only way to support effectively the
Teheran decisions, both in their na-
tional and international implications.
We must tell the people precisely who
the enemy is that they are ﬁghting-
organized big capital——and mobilize
our every resource to help make their
ﬁght succeed. We must awaken them
to the grave danger of a reactionary
victory, pointing out the heavy mobili-
zation of the capitalist elements, the
systematic propaganda-poisoning of the
armed forces against labor, and the
serious inroads that have been made
into Roosevelt’s labor and working
farmer support.

The mobilization of labor’s forces
politically and combining them with
all other democratic, win-the-war forces
supporting Teheran for an election
victory over reaction, whose main fort
is the Republican Party, should have
been the all-pervading business of our
National Committee. But it most em-
phatically was not. Instead, with Com-
rade Browder’s new conceptions of na-

tional unity, there was a tendency for
us to bridge the gap in the elections.
This would, indeed, be a serious mis-

take for us to make, to try to convince»

the American people in the heat of this
great and signiﬁcant struggle, that there
is a possibility for progressive unity
with the very forces that they are ﬁght-
ing against and must defeat in this
election, the monopolists.

Let us not make the serious error of
slipping in between these ﬁghting
forces in the name of an all-inclusive
but illusory national unity with big
capital. We must understand clearly
and deﬁnitely that the basic forces of
a progressive national unity are those
grouped, in the main, around Roose-
velt’s banners and we must ﬁght to
help them extend and solidify their
ranks. Perhaps we can learn a lesson
from the recent hotly-contested elec-
tions for the Auto Workers’ conven-
tions when we, in the name of trade
union unity, took a neutral position
and the dangerous Social—Democrat,
Walter Reuther, almost won control
of the convention out of the hands of
the win-the-war forces. The inﬂuence
of our Party in the national elections
can be very great, especially in solidify-
ing the, at present, confused ranks of
labor, and it must not be frittered
away in any middle, half-middle, or
above-the-battle position. '

NATIONAL UNITY IN THE
POSTWAR PERIOD

What kind of a postwar perspective
may we look forward to in this coun-
try? In my judgment, it will be quite
different from the long period of
peaceful class collaboration and social
advance, in which the monopolists are
progressively collaborating, that. Com-

 

 

 

LETTER» TO THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE :3

rade Browder seems to envisage. The
gravity of the world’s postwar con-
struction problems, which our country
also will feel, and the sharp contradic-

tions in classwinterests involved, will.

not permit such a harmonious progress.

It is true that at the present time
many big capitalist leaders and or-
ganizations are talking glibly in gen-
eralizations about the ﬁne economic
conditions they will create after the
war. But bearing in mind the glowing
promises, all unfulﬁlled, that were
made toward the conclusion of World
War I, we can safely discount much
of their rosy prophecies and look
sharply at their real policies. After all,
these men of big promises have a great
prize at stake, the full control of the
United States Government, and if they
can fool the people with tricky dema-
gogy it will be a well-paying invest-
ment.

Actually, the great capitalists in this
country are orientating in the main
upon a long-time postwar industrial
boom, based upon reconstruction work
and the spontaneous development of
new industries, as well as the capture
of new international markets. Al-
though in case of a crisis these ele-
ments would be quick to appeal to the
state for aid, they are quite generally
pooh-poohing and opposing any at-
tempts to prepare in. advance a Fed-
eral Governmental program to keep
the industries operating and the masses
employed. To them this is still all
pretty much “boondoggling” and in-
terference with the mystical operation
of “free enterprise.” That their true
perspective is almost complete reliance
upon privately owned industry along
the accustomed paths of the past, is
evidenced by the fact that they have

not introduced a single postwar eco-
nomic measure into Congress or popu-
larized it before the country. Every
progressive proposal made so far, from
the general slogan of the Four Free-
doms, to the economic reconstruction
program of the National Resources
Planning Board, the Wagner-Murray

social insurance bill, and the legisla-

tion to rehabilitate members of the
armed forces, and now the .President’s
recently announced 34,000 mile high-
way plan and his new Bill of Rights,
have all originated in the camp of the
Administration forces and are opposed
by the main forces of monopoly capital.

And so it will continue to be. In
the domestic, as in the international
sphere, the progressive lead will not
come from monopoly capital. The far-
reaching economic programs, involv-
ing government intervention in indus-
try on an unprecedented scale that will
be necessary to guard our country from
an economic collapse worse than that
of 1929, will originate in a truly pro-
gressive camp, consisting of the masses
of workers, farmers, middle classes and
liberal sections of capitalists. And they
will be brought to realization, not in
easy agreement with the monopolists,
as Comrade Browder would appear to
believe, but in active pressure against
them.

Let us consider, therefore, what is
likely to confront us as a result of the
elections? First, if President Roose-
velt should be elected again and should
try vigorously to put into effect a
progressive program, including the in-
ternational decisions of Teheran and
the economic and political aims he
enunciated in his recent “Report to the
Nation,” concretely, his new Bill of
Rights, then he will certainly collide

heavily with the powerful forces of the
bulk of —American ﬁnance capital.
Their present-bitter opposition to all
such measures. would not suddenly
melt away in sweetness and collabora-
tion. Inasmuch as we now fall far
short of national unity even under the
severe pressure of war, may we expect
more unity when this unifying pressure
is released? The American big bour-
geoisie show no signs of interpreting
the Teheran Agreement in the sense
that henceforth they must voluntarily
adopt progressive programs in the
United States. They still respond only
to pressure of one kind or another,
exerted nationally or internationally.
The progressive democratic forces of
national unity under a postwar Roose-
velt Administration should, and no
doubt would, seek to widen as far as
possible the area of agreement around
their necessary economic programs and
also generally to work on an orderly
development of our national progress,
but this desire will not save them from
coming into serious collisions with the
forces of ﬁnance capital.

On the other hand, should a Dewey,
Taft or Bricker, or even the liberal-
speaking Mr. Willkie be elected, then
we could expect definite attempts of
the new Administration to give mo-
nopoly capital a much freer hand at
the expense of the people. If success-
ful, this could only, result in strength-
ening reaction and imperilling our
economic future. At best, the domestic
economic program of such an Admin-
istration would be one based on boom
expectation and upon extending gov-
ernment aid to the workers only in the
most niggardly measure and under
heavy pressure. American ﬁnance capi-
tal would soon demonstrate that it

had learned very little of a progressive
economic nature through the war and
the period of the New Deal. The big
capitalists, if they did not make an
open attack upon the unions, would
probably try to paralyze organized la‘-
bor by ensnaring it into a program of
intensiﬁed class collaboration, designed
in their own interests and not in those
of labor and the nation. The capitalists
have not forgotten the way they did
this so disastrously to the labor move-
ment and the people after World War
I. With the added consideration that
big business today, bitterly remember-
ing the liberal—labor coalition that has
backed the government for the past
dozen years, would adopt any means
to prevent a repetition of this hated
experience. It could therefore be ex-
pected, what with the growing fascist

~ spirit in its ranks and the tricks it

has learned from Hitler, that the mo-
nopolists would adopt, if necessary, the
most drastic means to clip the strength
of labor and to prevent the return to
power of any popular, progressive gov-
ernment.

At our National Committee meet-
ing there were delegates who inter-
preted Comrade Browder’s report, not
illogically, as implying a no-strike
policy for the trade unions in the post-
war period. One, who went uncor-
rected, said: “We have the perspective
of continued cooperation, a no-strike
policy and no class clashes for a long
time after the war.” This is nonsense,
of course. It would disarm the trade
unions in the face of their enemies.
The Teheran Conference did not abol-
ish the class struggle in the United
States. The workers would indeed be
foolish if they were to orientate upon
any such illusory perspective. The cue

v

LETTER TO THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ’ :5

to the_ trade unions, in facing the post-
war period, is to unify their ranks, na-
tionally and internationally, to organ-
ize the millions of still unorganized
workers, to develop their united po-
litical action movement so that they
may be a real force in the democratic
coalition, to establish the broadest pos-
sible alliance with all other democratic
groups and classes, to defeat reaction
in the coming national elections, to
prepare constructive. economic ' pro-
posals for the postwar period and work
diligently for them, and generally to
strengthen their ranks and be in readi-
ness to defend their organizations and
their living standards from any and all
attacks by their powerful and inveter-
ate enemy, monopoly capital. It would
be disastrous if our Party were in any
way to weaken labor’s alertness to
these necessities;

THE SLOGAN OF
“FREE ENTERPRISE”

Comrade Browder was correct‘ in
saying that we should not take issue
with the reactionaries’ slogan of “free
enterprise”, in the sense that in the
Presidential election the issue is for
privately-owned industry or against it.
But he is incorrect when he says, “The
issue of ‘free enterprise’ is thus not in
any way, shape or form the issue of
the coming struggle for control of
United States policy in the Congres-
sional and Presidential elections.” On
the contrary, “free enterprise” is the
main slogan of the monopolists and be-
hind it stands the whole conception of
their program. It cannot be dismissed
by saying that “If anyone wishes to
describe the existing system of capital-
ism in the United States as ‘free enter-
prise,’ that's all right with us.”

 

In stressing their main slogan of
“free enterprise” the monopolists ‘are
of course trying to make plausible their
unfounded allegation of Socialism
against the Roosevelt Administration.
But they are also seeking to do much
more than this. Within the purview
of this slogan is comprised their whole
determination to regain unrestricted
control of the government, to weaken
the power of organized labor, and gen-
erally to free the hands of monopoly.

The economic essence of this slogan
is a main dependence upon a long-
term industrial boom to solve our na-
tional economic problems, with im-
provised government work programs
and aid for the workers and farmers
considered merely as emergency pro-
grams. Thus, Senator Taft says in the
Saturday Evening Post, December 11:
“Substantially full employment must
be restored and maintained through
free enterprise, with only such assist-
ance from government as is proved to
be absolutely necessary.” That is to
say, only after the economic crisis
bursts upon us we may look for frag-
mentary, skinﬂint programs of govern-
ment work and relief. The “free en-
terprise” slogan represents a concrete
program just as deﬁnitely as did that
of the “New Deal.” Hence, to accept
or ignore this slogan means to imply,
in the popular mind, to accept or
ignore the program behind it. .

It is obvious, therefore, that we can-

not simply brush aside big business’ «

main slogan of “free enterprise” as
being merely demagogic and let it go

. at that. On the contrary, while thor-

oughly exposing the demagoguery of
the slogan, we must also expose its
reactionary economic and political con-
tent. This can only be done on the

 

 

I6 I ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISICNISM

basis of bringing forward the program
of the progressive forces. In doing this,
the question of social insurance and
government stimulation of industry
cannot be put forth merely as emer-
gency stop-gap measures to apply in
times of crises. They must be pre-
sented as essential steps if we are to
cushion ourselves against plunging
headlong into overwhelming economic
crises; if we are to make even an
approach to the full production and
jobs for all that everybody is now talk-
ing about so glibly. The counter-pro-
gram of the progressive, win-the—war,
win-the-peace forces to the reactionary
“free enterprise,” or unrestrained mo-
nopoly program of the reactionaries,
does not now contain demands for the
nationalization of banks, railroads, or
other industries, and it will not in the
immediate postwar situation. But the
grave difficulties that will confront
capitalism all over the world after this
war, not excluding American capital-
ism, will surely eventually raise the
need and popularity of such demands.

=l= =l= #1‘

On the question of the two-party
system, it is my opinion that Com-
rade Browder also dismisses that matter
too easily, by speaking of “the stone
wall of the two-party system.” He
subscribes to “the general national
opinion that this ‘two-party system’
provides adequate channels for the
basic preservation of democratic
rights,” and thus leaves the impression
that the Communists no longer look
beyond the present two-party‘ line-up,
even in the most eventual sense.

In such a presentation, it seems to
me, there is contained an underesti-
mation of the political initiative of the

 

democratic masses of the people and an
overestimation of their acceptance of
the bourgeois leadership of the two
main parties. While the situation is
very much not ripe for a new political
party line-up in the United States,
nevertheless this can by no means be
excluded permanently. I prefer, in-
stead, the formulation of Philip Mur-
ray in the current issue of the Ameri-

can Magazine, where he states that the ~

political situation at this time in the
United States does not jusify the forma-
tion of a third party.

THE QUESTION OF SOCIALISM

In presenting such a basic change
in line to our Party as he did, it seems
to me that Comrade Browder should
have made a more complete statement
regarding our Party attitude to the
question of Socialism. While it is cor-
rect to say, as Comrade Browder does,
that Socialism is not the issue in the
war, nor will it be the issue in the im-
mediate postwar period in the United
States, and that, therefore, to raise the
issue now could only result in narrow-
ing down the national unity necessary
to win the war and to carry out gen-
erally the decisions of Teheran, never-
theless, merely to take this negative at-
titude toward Socialism is not enough.
We must also develop our positive
position.

We have to bear in mind that al-
though Socialism will not be the po-
litical issue in the United States in the

early postwar period, it will neverthe- ’

less be a question of great and growing
mass interest and inﬂuence. This is
true for a couple of major reasons,
aside from the possibility that some
countries of Europe may adopt Social-
ism at the close of the war: iﬁrst, the

LETTER TO THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE 17

Soviet Union in this war has given a
world-shaking demonstration of the
power and success of Socialism. The

' democratic peoples of the world, who

have been saved by the Red Army from
Hitler tyranny, are looking upon this
great demonstration with amazement,
gratitude and a lively curiosity. For
the ﬁrst time they are beginning to
see through the wall of prejudice that
was so carefully built up against the
U.S.S.R. over so many years. They

V are extremely interested, and in a more.

and more objective sense, to learn
further about the great, new, socialist
world power. The present new crop of
books friendly to the U.S.S.R. is an
early sign of the new mass interest in
the Soviet Union and its Socialism.
With the development of the postwar
recgnstruction period, we can expect

the’ U.S.S.R. to perform , as great

“miracles” as it is now doing in a
military way, hence this mass interest
is bound to increase. The second basic
reason- for a great postwar mass in-
terest in Socialism is that with the
world capitalist system badly injured,
there will be deﬁnite tendencies for
the peoples in all countries to learn
from the Soviet regime and to adapt
tc- their own problems such‘ features
as they can from the obviously success-
ful and ﬂourishing Socialist Soviet
Union. The whole question of the ad-
vance to Socialism will be in for a
fresh discussion in the new world
conditions.

In view of all this, obviously the
Communist Party, as the party of

Socialism, cannot take merely a nega-
tive attitude toward Socialism. We
must teach the workers the signiﬁ-
cance of the socialist developments
of our time and their relation to the
United States. While we point out that
Socialism is not now the issue in our
country, we must also show that it is
nevertheless the only ﬁnal solution for
our nation’s troubles. If we do not do
this, then the Social—Democrats will be
left a free hand to pose as the party of
Socialism, with consequent detriment
to our Party and to the whole struggle
of the win-the-war, win-the-peace
forces.
at as as

Obviously, the questions raised by
Comrade Browder in his report are of
far-reaching signiﬁcance and represent
a radical departure from our past con-
ceptions of national unity. They de-
serve the most profound consideration
in the pre-convention discussion that
is now beginning. In these days of
world—shaking war and with postwar
problems of enormous size and com-
plexity looming before us, our Party
must be doubly careful in the‘develop—
ment of its political line. I for one am
convinced that if we give this close
attention to Comrade Browder’s re-
port, adopted by the National Com-
mittee, we will ﬁnd it necessary to alter
it in the general sense of the several
points raised in this letter. I

Comradely yours,
WILLIAM Z. FOSTER.

NOTE BY WILLIAM Z. FOSTER .

The above letter to the National
Committee was rejected at an enlarged

meeting of the Political Bureau, held
on February 8, 1944, with about 40

   

 

 

18 I . ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISMA

leading Party members in attendance
and voting. Comrade Browder put as
the main issue of the meeting, not a
re-survey of the political policies, in the
light of my letter, but the preservation
of the unity of the Party. After a day’s
discussion, all present voted against my

_ letter, except Darcy and myself.

As a result of this serious rebuff and
in view of Comrade Browder’s ex-
pressed determination to stamp out all

open opposition, an attitude on his part

which was strengthened by the heavy
vote of the enlarged Political Bureau
against my letter, I concluded that it
would be folly for me to try to take
the question to the Party membership
at that time. For to do so would have
weakened our general work in sup-
port of the war; ruined our current big
recruiting drive, interfered seriously
with the development of our vital na-
tional election campaign, and perhaps
resulted in splitting our Party.

So I decided to conﬁne my opposi-
tion to the ranks of the National
Committee, a course which I followed
during the next year and a half by
means of innumerable criticisms, pol-
icy proposals, articles, etc., all going
in the direction of eliminating Com-
rade Browder’s opportunistic errors.
I was convinced that the course of po-
litical events and the Communist train-

ing of our leadership would eventually
cause our Party to return to a sound
line of policy.

It will be noted that my letter to the
National Committee does not discuss
the matter of dissolution, or reorgan-
ization, of the Communist Party into
the Communist Poltical Association.

When Comrade Browder proposed
this liquidatory ‘step several members
of the National Board raised objections
to it, and, of course, I opposed and
voted against it. Nevertheless Comrade
Browder was able to push it through
in spite of this opposition. At the time
of my sending the letter to the National
Committee, things had proceeded so
far that I considered the reorganization
of the Party into the C.P.A. as virtually
an accomplished fact. It had already
been publicly announced and endorsed
at the Ianuary meeting of the National
Committee, and, in fact, the Party was
already in the preliminary stages of
reorganization. Consequently, I felt that
further agitation of the matter was
hopeless for the time being and could
only cause useless strife and confusion
in our ranks. So I left the whole ques-
tion out of my letter to the National

.Committee. The immediate task, as I

saw it, was for me to help to keep the
C.P.A., in fact, if not in name, the
Communist Party.

 

0N THEl)lSS0llJTl0N or IHE
COMMUNIST mm or THE U.S.A.

By JACQUES DUCLOS

Reprinted from the April issue of CAHIERS DU COMMUNISME,
theoretical ‘organ of the Communist Party of France.

Many readers of Ca/tiers du Com-
mimisme have asked us for clarification
on the dissolution of the Communist
Party of the U.S.A. and the creation of
the Communist Political Association.

We have received some information
on this very important political event,
and thus we can in full freedom give
our opinion on the political considera-
tions which were advanced to justify
the dissolution of the Communist Party.

The reasons for dissolution of the
Communist Party in-the U’.S.A. and for
the “new course” in the activity of
American Communists are set forth in
oﬂicial documents of the Party and in
a certain number of speeches of its
former secretary, Earl Browder.

In his speech devoted to the results
of the Teheran Conference and the poli-
tical situation in the United States,
delivered December I2, I 943, in Bridge-
port and published in the Communist
magazine in January, 1944, Earl Brow-
der for the first time discussed the neces-
sity of changing the course of the
C.P.U.S.A. ‘

The Teheran Conference served as
Browder’s point of departure from
which to develop his conceptions fa-
vorable to a change of course of the
American C.P. However, while justly
stressing the importance of the Teheran
Conference for victory in the war
againstfascist Germany, Earl Browder

I9

   

 

drew from the Conference decisions er-
roneous conclusions in no wise ﬂowing
from a Marxist analysis of the situation.
Earl Browder made himself the pro-
tagonist of a false concept of the ways
of social evolution in general, and in
the first place,‘ the social evolution of the
United States.

' Earl Browder declared, in effect, that
at Teheran capitalism and socialism had
begun to ﬁnd the means of peaceful
co-existence and collaboration in the
framework of one and the same world;
he added that the Teheran accords re-
garding common policy similarly pre-
supposed common efforts with a view
to reducing to a minimum or com-
pletely suppressing methods of strug-
gle and opposition of force to force in
the solution of internal problems of
each country. i

That (the Teheran Declaration)
is the only hope of a continuance of
civilization in our time. That is why
I can accept and support and believe
in the Declaration at Teheran and
make it the starting point for all my
thinking about the problems of our
country and the World. (Address at
Bridgeport, Conn., Dec. 12, 1943.)

Starting from the decisions of the 

Teheran Conference, Earl Browder
drew political conclusions regarding

 

20 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

the problems of the world, and above
all the internal situation in the United
States. Some of these conclusions claim
that the principal problems of internal
politics of the United States must in

A the future be solved exclusively by

means of reforms, for the “expectation
of unlimited inner conﬂict threatens
also the perspective of international
unity held forth at Teheran.” (Teheran
and America, pp. 16-17.)

The Teheran agreements mean to
Earl Browder that the greatest part
of Europe, West of the Soviet Union,
will probably be reconstituted on a
bourgeois-democratic basis and not on
a fascist-capitalist or Soviet basis.

But it will be a capitalist basis
which is conditioned by the principle
of complete democratic self—determi-
nation for each nation, allowing full
expression within each nation of all
progressive and constructive forces
and setting up no obstacles to the
, development of democracy and social
progress in accordance with the
varying desires of the peoples. It
means a perspective for Europe mini-
mizing, and to a great extent elimi-
nating altogether, the threat of civil
, war after the international war.
(Bridgeport speech, The Communist,

January, 1944, p. 7.)
And Earl Browder adds:

Whatever may be the situation in
other lands, in the United States
this means a perspective in the im-
mediate postwar period of expanded

U production and employment and the
strengthening of democracy within
the framework of the present system
——and not a perspective of the transi-
tion to socialism. '

We can set our goal as the realiza-

 

tion of the Teheran policy, or we
can set ourselves the task of pushing
the United States immediately into
socialism. Clearly, however, we can-
not choose both.

The first policy, with all its dif-
ficulties, is deﬁnitely within the realm
of possible achievement. The second
would be dubious, indeed, especially
when we remember_ that even the
most progressive section of the labor
movement is committed to capital-
ism, is not even as vaguely socialistic
as the British Labor Party.

Therefore, the policy for Marxists
in the United States is to face with

all its consequences the perspective U

of a capitalist postwar reconstruction
in the United States, to evaluate all
plans on that basis, and to collaborate
actively with the most democratic
and progressive majority in the coun-
try in a national unity sufficiently
broad and effective to realize the
policies of Teheran. (Teheran
and America, p. 20.)

To put the Teheran policy into prac-

tice, Earl Browder considers that it is .

necessary to reconstruct the entire po-
litical and social life of the United
States.

Every class, every group, every in-
dividual, every political party in
America will have to readjust itself
to this great issue embodied in the
policy given to us by Roosevelt, Stalin
and Churchill. The country is only
beginning to face it so far. Everyone
must begin to draw the conclusion
from it and adjust himself to the
new world that is created by it. Old
formulas and old prejudices are go-
ing to be of no use whatever to us
as guides to find our way in this

‘ new world. We are going to have

 

 

to draw together all men and all
groups with the intelligence enough
tossee the overwhelming importance
of this issue, to understand that upon
its correct solution depends the fate
of our country and the fate of civili-
zation throughout the world.

We shall have to be prepared to
break with anyone that refuses to
support and Fight for the realization
of the Teheran Agreement and the
Anglo - Soviet — American Coalition.
We must be prepared to give the
hand of cooperation and fellowship
to everyone who ﬁghts for the real-
iza-tion of this coalition. If I. P.
Morgan supports this coalition and
goes down the line for it, I as a
Communist am prepared to clasp his
hand on that and join with him to
realize it. Class divisions or political
groupings have noﬁsigniﬁcance now
except as they reflect one side or the
other of this issue. (Bridgeport
speech, Ianuary, 1944, The Com-
munist, p. 8.)

Browder’s remark regarding Morgan
provoked quite violent objections from
members of the American C. P. Ex-
plaining this idea to the plenary session
of the central committee, Browder said:

. . . I was not making a verbal
abolition of class differences, but that
I was rejecting the political slogan of
class against class’_’ as our guide to
political alignments in the next
period. I spoke of Mr. Morgan sym-
bolically as the representative of a
class, and not as an individual-in
which capacity I know him not at
all. (Teheran and America, p. 24.)

As Browder indicates, creation of
a vast national unity in the U. S. pre-
supposes that the Communists would

 
   

ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 21:

be a part of this. Thus, the Communist
organization must conclude a long-
term alliance with far more important
forces. From these considerations, Brow-
der drew the conclusion that the Com-
munist organization in the U. S. should
change its name, reject the word
“party” and take another name more
exactly reflecting its role, a name more
in conformity, according to him, with
the political traditions of America.

Earl Browder proposed to name the
new organization “Communist Political
Association,” which, in the traditional
American two-party system, will not
intervene as a “party,” that is, it will
not propose candidates in the elections,
will neither enter the Democratic or
Republican Party, but will work to as-
semble a broad progressive and demo-
cratic movement within all parties.

In his report to the plenary session
of the central committee of the C.P.,
U.S.A., Browder spoke in detail of the
economic problems 'of U. S. postwar
national economy, and their solution
on the basis of collaboration and unity
of different classes. Browder indi-
cated that American business men, in-
dustrialists, ﬁnanciers and even reaction-
ary organizations do not admit the
possibility of a new economic crisis in
the U. S. after the war. On the con-
trary, all think that U. S. national
economy after the war can preserve
and maintain the same level of produc-
tion as during the war.

However, the problem is in the diffi-
culties of transition from wartime eco-
nomic activity to peacetime production,
and in the absorption by home and for-
eign markets of $90 billions in supple-
mentary merchandise which the Amer-
ican government is now buying for
war needs. In this regard, Earl Brow-
der claims that the Teheran Conference

  

 

 
 
  
  
   
   
   
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
  
   
   
   
  
   

 

 

22 ON THE STRUGGLEA AGAINST REVISIONISM

decisions make possible the overcom-
ing of Anglo-American rivalry in the

.struggle for foreign outlets, and that

the government of the United States,
in agreement with its great Allies,
and with the participation of govern-
ments of interested states, can create
a series of giant economic associa-
tions for development of backward
regions and war-devastated regions in
Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin Amer-
ica. ’ .

As to extension of the home market,
to permit absorption of a part of the
$9o,ooo,ooo,ooo worth of merchandise,
Browder suggests doubling the purchas-
ing power of the average consumer,
notably by wage increases.

Marxists will not help the reaction-
aries, by opposing the slogan of “Free
Enterprise” with any form of counter-
slogan. If anyone wishes to describe
the existing system of capitalism in
the United States as “free enterprise,”
that is all right with us, and we frank-
ly declare that we are ready to co-
operate in making this capitalism
work effectively in the postwar period
with the least possible burdens upon
the people. (Ibid., p. 21.)

Further, Browder claims that national

5 unity could no more be obtained by fol-

lowing a policy based on slogans aimed
at the monopolies and big capital’. ~

Today, to speak seriously of drastic

” curbs on monopoly capital, leading
toward the breaking of its power,
and imposed upon monopoly capi-
tal against its will, is merely another
form of proposing the immediate
transition to socialism. (Ibid, p. 23.)

In. his closing speech to the plen-
ary session of the C.P. Central Com-
mittee in January, 1944, Browder tried

to base himself on “theoretical” argu-
ments to justify the change of course
of the American C.P. Also he ex-
pressed his concept of Marxism and
its application under present conditions.

Browder thinks that by pronounc-
ing the _dissolution of the C. P. and
creating the C.P.A., the American Com-
munists are following a correct path,
resolving problems which have no par-

-allel in history and demonstrating how

Marxist theory should be applied in
practice.

Marxism never was a series of dog-
mas and formulas; it never was a

catalogue of prohibitionslisting the"

things we must not do irrespective
of new developments and new situa-
tions; it does not tell us that things
cannot be done; it tells us how to do
the things that have to be done, the
things that history has posed as
necessary and indispensable tasks.
Marxism is a theory of deeds, not of
dont’s. Marxism is therefore a posi-
tive, dynamic, creative force, and it

i is such a great social power precisely
because, as a scientiﬁc outlook and
method, it takes living realities as
its starting point. It has always re-
garded the scientiﬁc knowledge of
the past as a basis for meeting the
new and unprecedented problems of
the present and the future. And the
largest problems today are new in «a
very basic sense.

We have more than ever the task
to refresh ourselves in the great tra-
dition of Marxism, completely free-
ing ourselves from the last remnants
of the dogmatic and schematic ap-
proach. . . . « .

A True, according to all of the text-

books of the past, we are departing .

from orthodoxy, because none of our

 

 

ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 23

textbooks foresaw or predicted a long
period of peaceful relations in the
world before the general advent of
socialism. (Ibz'a'., pp. 43-45.)

The new political course outlined by
Browder found but few adversaries
among the leading ‘militants ‘of the
C.P.U.S.A. At the enlarged session of
the political bureau of the Party, those
who spoke up violently against Brow-
der were William Foster, president of
the C.P.U.S.A., and Darcy, member of
the central committee and secretary of
the Eastern Pennsylvania district.

‘ Foster expounded his differences with
Browder in two documents—in a letter
to the national committee of the
C.P.U.S.A. and in his introductory

speech to the extraordinary session of

the National Committee, Feb. 8, 1944.

In these two documents, Foster criti-
cizes Browder’s theoretical theses re-
garding the change in the character of
monopoly capital in the U.S.A., the
perspectives of postwar economic de-
velopment as well as Browder’s position
on the question of the Presidential elec-
tions.

In his Feb. 8 speech Foster also at-

-tacks those who, on the basis of Brow-

der’s theses, suggested that strikes be
renounced in the postwar period.
But in neither one of these docu-

~ments did Foster openly take a stand

against the dissolution of the Com-
munist Party.

In his report Comrade Browder,
in attempting to apply the Teheran
decisions to the United States, drew
a perspective of a smoothly working
national unity, including the decisive
sections of American ﬁnance capital,
not only during the war but also in
the postwar; a unity which (with
him quoting approvingly from Vic-

\

tory and After), would lead to “a
rapid healing of the terrible Wounds
of the war” and would extend on
indeﬁnitely, in an all-class peaceful
collaboration, for a “long term of
years.” In this picture, American im-
perialism virtually disappears, there
remains hardly a trace of the class
struggle, and Socialism plays practi-
cally no role whatever. (Foster Letter
to Member: of N. C.)

I

Foster violently criticized Browder
because the latter, while outlining a

new course in the activity of the Ameri-
can C.P., had lost sight of several of
the most fundamental principles of
Marxism-Leninism.

It seems to me that Comrade

Browder’s rather rosy outlook for

capitalism is based upon two errors.
The first of these is an underestima-
tion of the deepening of the crisis of
world _capitalism caused by the war.
When questioned directly in Political
Bureau discussion, Comrade Brow-

der agreed that capitalism has been V

seriously weakened by the war, but
his report would tend to give the
opposite implication. The impression
is left that capitalism has somehow
been rejuvenated and is now enter-
ing into a new period of expansion

and growth. (Ibid

According to Foster, world capitalism
can surely count on a certain postwar
boom, but it would be wrong to think
that capitalism, even American capital-
ism, could maintain itself at the pro-
duction level attained in wartime, and
resolve, in a measure more or less satis-
factory to the working class, the com-
plex problems arising after thewar.

Without diminishing the importance
of the Teheran conference, Foster con-
sidered, nevertheless, that it would be

 

 

an extremely dangerous illusion to
think that Teheran had in any way
changed the class nature of capitalism,
that the Teheran conference had liqui-
dated the class struggle, as it appears
from Browder’s speech. The fact that
capitalism has learned to live in peace
and in alliance with socialism is far
from meaning that American monopoly
capitalism has become progressive and
that it can henceforth be unreservedly
included in national unity in the strug-
gle for the realization of the Teheran
conference decisions.

The class nature of imperialistic
capitalism, Foster asserted, is reac-
tionary. That is why national unity
with it is impossible. The furious
attack of these circles against the
democratic Roosevelt government-
does this not supply a convincing
proof? Can one doubt, after that,
that the monopolist sections in the
U. S. are enemies and not friends

of the Teheran decisions as Earl»

Browder thinks?

The danger in this whole point of
view is that, in our eagerness to
secure support for Teheran, we may
walk into the trap of trying to co-
operate with the enemies of Teheran,
or even of falling under their inﬂu-
ence. Trailing after the big bour-
geoisie is the historic error of social-
democracy, and we must be vigilantly
on guard against it. (Ibia'.)

Foster also criticized Browder for
his attitude toward the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers, which is, in
his opinion, one of the most reactionary
organizations. of monopoly capital in
the U. S. However, Browder thought
he had to approve a certain number ‘of
the economic measures of this associa-
tion. He accepts its central slogan, that

 

'24 ON THE? STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

of “free private enterprise,” which is
in reality basically reactionary and con-
trary to the Roosevelt policy. What is
more, Browder, counting on seeing
workers’ wages increased I00 per cent
after the war, invites U. S. monopolists
to share his good intentions and says
to them: “[You] must ﬁnd the solution
in order to keep their plants in opera-
tion.” ‘

Citing these words of Browder’s,
Foster declared:

In my opinion, it would be a
catastrophe for the labor movement
if it accepted such a plan or such an
idea, even if only provisionally. Start-
ing from a notoriously erroneous
conception, that U. S. monopoly capi-
talism can play a progressive role
Comrade -Browder looks askance at
all suggestions tending to subdue the
monopolies, whereas the C.P. can
accept only one policy, that of tend-
ing to master these big capitalists
now and after the war. In calling
for the collaboration of classes, Brow-
der sows wrong illusions of tailism
in the minds of trade union mem-
bers. Whereas the job of the trade
unions is to elaborate their policy and
dictate it to the big employers.

As to the problems of postwar or-
ganizations, Foster repudiated all illu-
sions regarding the self-styled progres-
sive role of monopoly capital. America,
Foster declared, will emerge from the
war as a powerful state in the world,
the industrial magnates will be rather
inclined to dictatorial acts than to com-
promises, and it is hardly likely, he
added, that we can expect a progressive
program from them.

So far as the bulk of finance capi-
tal is concerned, starting out with a
prewar record of appeasement, it has,

 

 

ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 25

all through the war, followed a course
of rank proﬁteering and often out-
right sabotage of both the domestic
and foreign phases of the nation’s
war program, especially the former.
While these elements obviously do
not want the United States to lose
the war, they are’ certainly very poor
defenders of the policy of uncondi-
tional surrender. In the main, their
idea of a satisfactory outcome of the
war would be some sort of a nego-
tiated peace with German reactionary
forces, and generally to achieve a
situation that would put a wet
blanket on all democratic govern-

ments in Europe. (Ibid.)

Foster thinks that Browder is right
«when he says that the question of
socialism is not the issue of the present
war and that to pose this question
would only result in restricfng the
framework of national unity. liut con-
sidering the fact that the successes of
the U.S.S.R. will increase the interest
cf of the masses in socialism, the Com-
munists must explain to the workers
the importance of the socialist develop-
ment of our epoch and the way in
which it concerns the U. S., for other-
wise the Social Democrats could repre-
sent themselves as a part of socialism.

The enforcement of the Teheran
decisions, both in their national and
international aspects, demands the
broadest possible national unity, and
in this national unity there must be
workers, farmers, professionals, small
businessmen and all of the capitalist
elements who will loyally support
the program. (Ibz'a'.)

Foster’s letter to the National Com-

ii rnittee and his speech at the extra-

ordinary session of the National Com-
mittee on Feb. 8, 1944, against Brow-

der’s line, provoked violent criticism
from those in attendance. Most speak-
ers rejected Foster’s arguments and

supported the “new course” of the

C.P.U.S.A. outlined by Browder.

Speaking during the meeting against
Browder, Darcy said that in his opinion
Foster’s speech was not aimed at di-
minishing Browder’s authority. Like
Forster, Darcy violently criticized the
interpretation given by Browder of the
T eheran decisions and asserted that the
political agreement of the big three
powers who constitute the Teheran
conference should not be considered,
as an agreement on the principal post-
war - economic problems.

Afterwards Darcy was expelled from
the Party by the Congress on the
proposal of a commission named by
the Central Committee and headed by
Foster, because, as the decision‘ says,
by sending to Party members a letter
containing slanderous declarations on
Party leaders; he attempted to create
a fraction within the Party, and be-
cause he submitted the letter in ques-
tion to the bourgeois press.

After the extraordinary session of
the National Committee, a discussion
on Browder’s report to the plenary
assembly of the Central Committee was
opened in the basic organizations of
the Party, in regional congresses and
the Party press.

According to information published.
in the Daily Worker, after the discus-
sion the organizations and regional-
congresses of the Party unanimously"
accepted Browder’s proposals. As to
Foster, he declared at the extraordinary
session of the National Committee that
he did not intend to make known his
differences with Browder outside the
Party Central Committee. ,

The Congress of the C.P.U.S.A.

 

‘(held May 20, I944) heard ’Browder’s

report in which he expressed his opin-
ions regarding the political situation
in the U. S. and he proposed adoption
of a new course in the policy’ of Com-
munists of the U. S.

Proposing a resolution on the dis-
solution of the C.P.U.S.A., Browder
declared:

On Ian. II the National Commit-
‘ tee of the Communist Party in the
interest of national unity and to en-
able the Communists to function
most effectively in the changed po-
litical conditions and to make still
greater contributions toward win-
ning the war and securing a durable
peace, recommended that the Ameri-
can Communists should renounce the
aim of partisan advantage and the
‘partyform of organization. . . .
With that purpose, I propose in
the name of the National Committee
and in consultation with the most
important delegations in this Con-
vention, the adoption of the follow-
ing motion:
I hereby move that the Communist
Party of America be and hereby is
dissolved. . . . (Proceedings, p. 11.)

After having accepted the resolution

r on dissolution of the C.P., the Congress

of the C.P.U.S.A. proclaimed itself the
Constituent Congress of the Commu-
nist Political Association of the United
States and adopted a programmatic

A introduction to the Association’s stat-

utes. In this introduction it is said:

The Communist Political Associa-
tion is a" non-party organization of
Americans which, basing itself upon
the working class, carries forward the

‘ traditions of Washington, Iefferson,

Paine, Jackson and Lincoln, under
the changed conditions of modern
industrial society.

It seeks effective application of

. democratic principles to the solution

of the problems of today, as an ad-

vanced sector of the democratic ma-.

jority of the American people.
It upholds the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, the United States Consti-

tution and its Bill of Rights, and the A

achievements of American democracy
against all the enemies of popular
liberties.

It is shaped by the needs of u the
nation at war, being formed in the
midst of the greatest struggle of all
history; it recognizes that victory
for the free peoples over fascism will
open up new and more favorable
conditions for progress; it -looks to
the family of free nations, led by the
great coalition of democratic capital-
ist and socialist states, to inaugurate
an era of world peace, expanding
pf(()idul::ti(1)iL and econpimic wlell-befingi

peoples regardless of race, creed or
color.

It adheres to the principles of sci-
entiﬁc socialism, Marxism, the herit-
age of the best thought of humanity
and of a hundred years’ experience
of the labor movement, principles
which have proved to be indispens-
able to the national existence and
independence of every nation: it
looks forward to a future in which,
by democratic choice of the American
people, our own country will solve
the problems arising out of the con-

tradiction between the social char.-.

acter of production and its private
ownership, incorporating the lessons
of the most fruitful achievements of
all mankind in a form and manner

 

ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 27

consistent with American traditions
and character. . . . (Preamble, Pro-

ccfcdzings, pp. 47-48.)

The Constituent Congress of the
C.P.A. adopted a main political reso-

lution, “National Unity for Victory,

Security and a Durable Peace.”
The resolution points out the ex-

ceptional importance of the Teheran

conference decisions for victory over
the aggressor and establishment of a
lasting peace. It calls for reinforcement
of national unity as the necessary con-
ditions for their application.

lBy national unity is meant union
of all patriotic forces from Commu-
nists, Laborites to adherents of the
Democratic and Republican parties. All
ideological, religious and political dif-
ferences must be subordinated to this
unity. The resolution stresses the ex-
ceptional importance of the 1944 elec-

tions on whose results depend the

country’s unity and destiny. It recog-
nizes the increasingly important role
of the working class in national unity,
its growing activity and its political
inﬂuence.

The resolution Hays the reactionary
policy of groups led by Du Pont,
Hearst, McCormick, characterizing this
policy as pro-fascist and treason, and
calling on the American people to
struggle against these groups.

The resolution then says that the
majority of the 1, American people are

 not yet convinced of the need for

a more radical solution to social and
economic problems with the aid of
nationalization of big industry or by

‘means of establishing socialism.

That is why, the immediate task con-
sists in obtaining a higher

of production in ,.the ‘framework of
the existing capitalist regime. With

level -

this, private employers must receive all
possibilities to solve the problem of
production and employment of labor.
Solution of these problems is likewise,
in the first place, linked to the maxi-
mum increase in the American people’s
purchasing power and extension of
foreign commerce. If private industry

cannot solve these tasks, the govern- \

ment must assume the responsibility.

The resolution expresses itself against.

anti-Semitism, anti-Negro discrimina-
tion, calls for the outlawing of the
“ﬁfth column” and for the banning of
calls by the latter for a negotiated
peace with the aggressor.
The resolution concludes:

For the camp of national unity,
which is composed of the patriotic
forces of all classes, from the work-
ing people to the capitalists, rests
and depends upon the working class,
the backbone and driving force of
the nation and its win-the-war coali-
tion. . . . It requires the extension
of labor’s united action of the A. F.
of L., the Q10. and Railroad Broth-
erhoods. It requires the most resolute
development of laboiﬁs political ini-
tiative and inﬂuence, with labor’s
full and adequate participation in
the government. . . .

. we Communists, as patriotic
Americans, renew our sacred pledge
to.the nation to subordinate every-
thing to win the war and to destroy
fascism. . . . (Resolutions, p. 7.)

In addition to the resolution on
“National Unity,” the C.P.A. Congress
passed a series of other decisions: on
transition from war to peacetime pro-
duction; on international trade union
unity; on the C.P.A.’s wage policy;
on political .life as it regards demo-
bilized veterans; on work among wo-

 

/

28

men; on farmers; on the situation in
the southern states; on suppressing the
poll tax; on the ﬁght against anti-Semit—
ism; on unity among’ countries of the
western hemisphere and on the 25th an-
niversary of the Communist move-
ment in the  S.

The congress unanimously elected
Browder president of the C.P.A.

The C.P.A. Congress addressed a
message to Comrade Stalin and the
Red Army saying especially:

In every American city and village,
every factory and farm of our great
land, men and women and children
of all classes speak with wonder and
deep graditude of the heroic achieve-
ments of the Soviet Union and its
valiant Red Army. Every day since
the brutal and treacherous common
Fascist enemy violated your borders
on June 22, 1941, more of the Ameri-
can people have come to know and
love your leaders and your people.

The political and military leader-
ship of the U.S.S.R. and its mighty
Red Army is applauded not only by
our great political and military lead-
ers, but by our workers, farmers,
businessmen, professional people, art-
ists, scientists and youth. The ap-
peasers of the Hitlerites and the ene-
mies of our common victory, who
have been trying to frighten us with
Hitler’s “Soviet bogey,” have not
succeeded in blinding our people to
the realities. Your deeds daily speak
with an authority that drowns their
poisonous words.

As the relentless oﬂensives of your
mighty forces drive the Nazis from
your soil, bringing nearer the day of
your common and ﬁnal victory over
the Fascist enemy, we grow ever
more conscious of our enormous debt

i ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

to you, the leaders and fighters and

peoples of the great Soviet land. The”

names of your liberated towns and

villages are daily on our lips, the ‘

name of Stalin and the names of:
your countless heroes enshrined in
our hearts.

Daily more and more of our peo~

ple understand why it is that yours,

the world’s first Socialist state, has. A

giventhe world such an unparalleled
exampfl of unity, heroism, individual
initiative and a new discipline in the
art and science of warfare.

All patriotic Americans are deter»-
mined to strengthen still further the
concerted action of the United Na-~
tions, and its leading coalition of our"
country, the Soviet Union and Eng—
land on whichour assurance of vic—
tory rests. They are determined to»
continue and deepen this coalition
in the peace to come and to extend
the friendship among our peoples»
which will cement the alliance of"
our two powerful nations as the-
mainstay of victory, national freedom
and an enduring peace.” (Message tors
Stalin, Proceedings, pp. 13-14.)

After the Constituent Congress, the
leadership of the C.P.A. waged a“
campaign of explanation on the aims.
and tasks of the Association. T

In one of his speeches Browder said:

. . . That istwhy we dissolved the
Communist Party, renounced all aims
of partisan advancement, and re»
grouped ourselves into the non—parti-»
san Communist Political Association;
That is why we are ready and willing?
to work with any and all Americans:
who place victory in the war as the
first law, and who move toward such
a minimum program as we have out»
lined for the solution of our postwar

   

ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 29

problems. This is why we do not asso-
ciate ourselves with any other politi-
cal party, but rather with the most
forward-looking men in all parties.
(“The War and the Elections,”
Daily Worker, June 18, 1944.)

Explaining the functions of the
C.P.A., its organizational secretary,
Williamson, declared: T

As regards the functioning of the
Association, we emphasize that this
.means manifold increase and im-
provement in every aspect of po-
litical-educational activity, on a na-
tional, state and local club basis. We
must become known as an organi-
zation whose grasp of Marxism pro-
vides us with correct answers to the
‘complex political problems confront-
ing the people. While the members
belong to, and are active in, every
type of mass organization——political,
economic, cultural, fraternal, etc.——
the Association in its own name will
speak out boldly and with initiative
on all issues and policies.” (William-
5 son, Proceca’z'rzg5, pp. 55-56.)

I

The practical activity of the C.P.A.
since the Congress was subordinated
to the principal task of the hour: active
participation of the C.P.A. in the 1944
election campaign.

The national C.P.A. Congress unani-
mously backed Mr. Roosevelt’s Presi-
dential candidacy. In their speeches,
Browder and the other leaders. of the
C.P.A. in the name of the C.P.A.
supported Mr. Roosevelt’s election to a
fourth term. The regional-state or-
ganizations of the C.P.A. and local
clubs carried on an active propaganda
campaign in favor of Mr. Roosevelt
and congressional candidates favorable
to Mr. Roosevelt.

On Sept. 25, 1944, during a meeting
called by the New York C.P.A. on the
25th aniversary of the Communist
movement in the U. S., Browder said:

. . . every group, however small,
just as every individual has the same
supreme duty to make its complete
and unconditional contribution to
victory. We must give not only our
lives, but we must be ready also to
sacrifice our prejudices, ‘our ideolo-

_ gies, and our special interests. We
American Communists have applied
this rule first of all to ourselves.

We know that Hitler and the Mi-
kado calculated to split the United.
Nations on the issue of Communism‘
and anti-Communism; we know that
the enemy calculated to split America
on this issue in the current elections,
and thus prepare our country for
withdrawal from the war and a com-
promise peace. We therefore set our-
selves, as our special supreme task,
to remove the Communists and Com-
munism from this election campaign
as in any way an issue, directly or
indirectly.

To this end we unhesitatingly sac-
riﬁced our electoral rights in this
campaign, by refraining from putting
forward our own candidates; we
went ‘to the length of dissolving the
Communist Party itself for an indefi-
nite period in the future; we declared
our readiness to loyally support the
existing system of private enterprise
which is accepted by the overwhelm-

ing majority of Americans,‘ and to ;

raise no proposals for any funda-
mental changes which could inany
way endanger the national unity;
we went out into the trade unions
and the masses of the people, straight-

forwardly and frankly using all out A

 

    

inﬂuence to firmly establish this pol-
icy of national unity; we helped
with all our strength to restrain all
impulses toward strike movements
among the workers, and to prepare
the workers for a continuation of na-
tional unity after the war. . . .

As spokesman for American Com-
munists I can say for our small group
that we completely identify ourselves
with our nation, its interests and the
majority of its people, in this support
for Roosevelt and Truman for Presi-
dent and Vice—President.

We know quite well that the Amer-
ica that Roosevelt leads is a capitalist
America, and that it is the mission of
Roosevelt, among other things, to
keep it so. We know that only great

- disasters for our country could change

this perspective of our country from
that of capitalism to that of socialism,
in the foreseeable future. Only failure
to carry through the war to victory
or a botching of the peace and failure
to organize it, or the plunging of our
country into another economic catas-
trophe like that of the Hoover era,
could turn the American people to
socialism.

We do not want disaster for Amer-
ica, even though it results in social-
ism. If We did, we would support
Dewey and Hoover and Bricker and
their company. We want victory in
the war, with the Axis powers and
all their friends eliminated from the
world. We want a world organized
for generations of peace.

We want our country’s economy
fully at work, supplying a greatly
multiplied world market to heal the
wounds of the world, a greatly ex-
panded home market reflecting rising
standards of living here, and an or-

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM-

derly, cooperative and democratic if

working out of our domestic and class ~

relationships, within a continuing na-
tional unity that will reduce and

eventually eliminate large domestic

struggles. . . .

That is why American Commu-
nists, even as our great Communist
forebears in 1860 and .1864 supported
Abraham Lincoln, will in 1944 sup-
port Franklin Delano Roosevelt for

President of the United States. . . . i

As to Browder’s attitude toward the
Soviet Union, he highly appreciates
the U.S.S.R.’s role in the United Na-
tions system and in the Work of ﬁnally
crushing Hitlerite Germany and es-
tablishing a lasting peace after the war.
Browder stressed more than once that
the Soviet state built by Lenin and
Stalin constitutes the irreplaceable force
which saved the world from fascist
slavery and he called for it to be made
known to all Americans all the wisdom
of Leninist-Stalinist theory that made
the Soviet Union great and powerful.

From an organizational point of
view, the C.P.A. structure is as fol-

-lows: the basic organizational cell is

the territorial club whose general meet-
ing is called once a month. Between
general membership meetings all the
work planned by the club is carried out
by its committee, made up of the most
active members. The clubs are sub-
ordinated to regional C.P.A. councils.
The leading organization of the C.P.A.
is the National Committee elected for
two years at the Association Congress.
The Association’s president and II vice-
presidents elected by the Congress
comprise the permanent leading organ-
ization of the Association. v
The C.P.A. Congress set forth main---
tenance of the principle of democratic
centralism as the structural basis of the

 
   

ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 3i

Association. L Williamson, C.P.A. or-
ganizational secretary, explained to the
Congress in these terms the applica-
tion of the democratic centralism prin-

ciple of the C.P.A.:

. . . While maintaining a structure
and minimum organizational re-
quirements compatible with the char-
acter of a Marxist political educa-
tional association, we must grant
greater autonomy to the lower organi-
zations, emphasize that democracy is
a two-way street from top to bottom
and bottom to top, and eliminate all
rigidity of organization. (William-
son, Proceedings, p. 58.)

The National Congress of the Politi-
cal Association adopted the C.P.A.
constitution in which it said that every-
one who wishes to belong to the C.P.A.
accepts its program and its line.

Explaining who can belong to the

Association, the Daily Worker wrote:

A We can ask of new applicants to
membership in the Party only loyalty
to the principles that are already com-
.prehensive\to all workers, devotion to
themost basic duties of action today;
plus a willingness and eagerness to
study the program and history and
the theory which will make them
thorough Communists. And above all
a willingness to ﬁght, to sacrifice in
the war of mankind against Nazi en-
slavement is the ﬁrst requirement
for entering the Communist Party.
(Minor, Daily Worker, Feb., 1944.)

At the time of its dissolution the
Communist Party of the United States,
according to Browder’s declaration, had
80,000 members without counting the
10,000 Party members in the army.
C According to the Congress decisions all

members of the C.P.U.S.A. are mem-
bers of the C.P.A. and must register
before July 4, 1944. As the Daily Work-
er announced up to July 16, 1944, hard-
ly 45,000 persons had been registered.

Without analyzing in -detail Brow-
der’s full position on the dissolution
of the C.P.U.S.A. and creation of the
Communist Political Association, and
without making a developed critique
of this position, one can nevertheless de-
duce from it the following conclusions:

I. The course applied under Brow-
der’s leadership ended in practice in
liquidation of the independent political
party of the working class in the U. S.

2. Despite declarations regarding
recognition of the principles of Marx-
ism, one is witnessing a notorious revi-
sion of Marxism on the part of Brow-
der and his supporters, a revision which
is expressed in the concept of a long-
term class peace in the United States,
of the possibility of the suppression of
the class struggle in the postwar period
and of establishment of harmony be-
tween labor and capital.

3. By transforming the Teheran
declaration of the Allied governments,
which is a”document of a diplomatic
character, into a political platform of
class peace in the United States in the
postwar period, the American Commu-
nists are deforming in a radical way the
meaning of the Teheran declaration
and are sowing dangerous opportunist
illusions which will exercise a negative
inﬂuence on the American labor move-
ment if they are not met with the nec-
essary reply.

4. According to what is known up to .

now, the Communist Parties of most
countries have not approved Browder’s
position and several Communist Parties
(for example that of the Union of South

Africa and that of Australia) have come .

 

 

3:». S oN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

out openly against this position, while
“the Communist Parties of several South
American countries (Cuba, Colombia)
regarded the position of the American
Communists as correct and in general
followed the same path. »

Such are the facts. Such are the ele-
ments of understanding which permit
passing judgment on the dissolution of
the American Communist Party.
French Communists will not fail to ex-
amine in the light of Marxist—Leninist
critique the arguments developed to
justify the dissolution of the American
Communist Party. One can be sure
that, like the Communists of the Union
of South Africa and of Australia, the
French Communists will not approve
the‘ policy followed by Browder for it
has swerved dangerously from the vic-
torious Marxist—Leninist doctrine whose
rigorously scientiﬁc application could
lead to but one conclusion, not to dis-
solve the American Communist Party
but to'work to strengthen it under the
banner of stubborn struggle to defeat
Hitler Germany and destroy everywhere
the extensions of fascism.

The fact that all the members of the
Communist Party of the United States
did not sign up automatically in the
Communist Political Association shows
that the dissolution of the Party pro-
voked anxieties, perfectly legitimate.

In the United States the omnipotent
trusts have been the object of violent
criticism. It is known, for instance,
that the former Vice-President of the
United States, Henry Wallace, has de-
nounced their evil doings and their anti-
national policy.

We too, in France, are resolute parti-
sans of national unity, and we show
that in our daily activity, but our
anxiety for unity does not make us lose
sight for a single moment of the neces-

   

sity of arraying ourselves against the
men of the trusts.

Furthermore, one can observe a cer-
tain confusion in Browder’s declara-
tions regarding the problem of national-
ization of monopolies and what he calls
the transition from capitalism to so-
cialism.

Nationalization of monopolies actu-
ally in no sense constitutes a socialist
achievement, contrary to what certain

‘people would be inclined to believe.

No, in nationalization it is simply a
matter of reforms of a democratic char-
acter, achievement of socialism being
impossible to imagine without prelim-
inary conquest of power.

Everyone understands that the Com-
munists of the United States want to
work to" achieve unity in their country.
But it is less understandable that they
envisage the solution of the problem
of national unity with the goodwill

of the men of the trusts, and under "

quasi-idyllic conditions, as if the capi-
talist regime had been able to change
its nature by some unknown miracle.
In truth, nothing justifies the disso-
lution of the American Communist
Party, in our opinion. Browder’s analy-
sis of capitalism in the United States
is not distinguished by a judicious ap-
plication of Marxism-Leninism. The pre-
dictions regarding a sort of disappear-
ance of class contradictions in the U. S.
correspond in no wise to a Marxist-Lem
inist understanding of the situation. ~
As to the argument consisting of
a justification of the Party’s dissolution

by the necessity of not taking direct

part in the presidential elections, this
does not withstand a serious examina-
tion. Nothing prevents a Communist
Party from adapting its electoral tactics
to the requirements of a given political
situation. It is clear that American

which the forces of democracy and
progress do not shut their eyes to the ,

Communists were right in supporting
the candidacy of President Roosevelt
in the last elections, but it was not at
all necessary for this to dissolve the
Communist Party.

It is beyond doubt that if, instead
of dissolving the Communist Party of
the United States all had been done to
intensify its activity in the sense of de-
veloping an ardent national’ and anti-
fascist policy, it could very greatly have
consolidated its position and consider-
ably extended its political inﬂuence. On
the contrary, formation of the Commu-
nist Political Association could not but
trouble the minds and obscure the
perspectives in the eyes of the working
masses.

In France, under cover of Resistance
unity, certain suggestions for the liquid-
ation of the party have been circulated,
with more or less discretion, during the
last months, but none among us has
ever thought of taking such suggestions
seriously. It is not by liquidating the
Party that we would have served na-
tional unity. On the contrary we are
serving it by strengthening our Party.
And as far as the American Commu-
nists are concerned, it is clear that their

a , desire to serve the unity of their country

and the cause of human progress places
before them tasks which pre-suppose
the existence of a powerful Communist
Party.

After the ‘Teheran decisions came
the Yalta decisions which expressed the
will of the Big Three to liquidate fas-
cism in Germany and to help the lib-
erated peoples to liquidate the remnants
of fascism in the different countries.

It is scarcely necessary to recall that
the material bases for fascism reside in
the trusts, and the great objective of
this war, the annihilation of fascism,
can only be obtained to the ‘extent in

33

economic and political circumstances
which engender fascism.

The American Communists have an
especially important role to play in the
struggle taking place between the pro-
gressive forces of the earth and fascist
barbarism.

Without any doubt they would have
been in a better position to play this
role in the interests of their country
and human progress if, instead of pro-
ceeding to dissolve their Party, they had
done everything to strengthen it and
make of it one of the elements of the
assembling of the broad democratic
masses of the United Statespfor the ﬁnal
crushing of fascism, that shame of the
20th century. It would be useless to
hide the fact that fascism has more or

less concealed sympathizers in the U. S.,‘

as it has in France and other countries.

The former Vice-President of the
U. S., Henry Wallace, present Secretary
of Commerce, said rightly that one can-
not ﬁght fascism abroad and tolerate
at home the activity of powerful groups
which intend to make peace “with a
simple breathing spell between the
death of an old tyranny and the birth
of a new.”-

The Yalta decisions thwart these
plans, but the enemies of liberty will
not disarm of their free will. They
will only retreat before the acting coali-
tion of all the forces of democracy and
progress.

And it is clear that if Comrade Earl
Browder had seen, as a Marxist-Lenin-
ist, this important aspect of the prob-
lems facing liberty-loving peoples in

 this moment in their history, he would
have arrived at aiconclusion quite other

than the dissolution of the Communist
Party of the United States,

    
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  

ON THE 0lJEST|0N 0F RIEVISIIDNISM

By WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

Excerpt: from Report to the National Committee meeting of the
C.P.A., lune 18-20, 1945.

Comrade Browder’s “notorious revi-
sionism” (to use the words of Duclos)
stems directly from the present aggres-
sive program of American imperialism.
In order to understand this, it is help-
ful to review brieﬂy the Communist
Party’s struggle against right opportu-
nism in its ranks during the 192o’s.
For the revisionism of that time was
also a deﬁnite reflection in our party
of American imperialism.

Following World War I, American
imperialism experienced a big up-
swing. The United States became the
most powerful capitalist country in the
world. It passed from the status of
debtor to a creditor nation, exporting
capital from 1920 to 1929 to the then
unheard—of total of 20 billion dollars.
All over the world it conducted an ac-
tive campaign to capture markets, as
against other big countries which were
weakened by the war. With its
“Young” and “Dawes” plans, it prac-
tically dictated the economic terms to
defeated Germany.
America its attitude was one of arrogant
domination and military oppression.
Meanwhile, at home the capitalists, in
an orgy of proﬁt-making, went ahead
developing their new methods of mass
production, to the admiration and envy
of the whole capitalist world.

As usual, in the optimistic atmos-
phere of the upward phase of the eco-
nomic cycle, super-heated soothsayers

 

Toward Latin

34

appeared to sing the glories of the
American capitalist system. And this
time to an extent never known before.
The United States, they said, had ﬁnally
overcome the contradictions of capital-
ism. There would be no more eco-
nomic crises or mass unemployment.
Mass production and high wages was
the magic formula. Not Marx, but
Ford, was their slogan. The “New
Capitalism” was here, and engineers
and economists came from all over Eu-
rope to study the American miracle.
Not strangely, this intoxicating capi-
talist propaganda had profound reper-
cussions in the ranks of the workers,
especially the trade unions. Labor
oﬂicialdom, including the progressives,
listened open-mouthed when Professor
Carver explained how the workers

through their savings were buying con- ~

trol of the great industries. And the
labor “theoreticians” did a little utopia-
building of their own. They declared
that the path of progress for labor lay

through cooperation with the employers » ’

to increase production. The classstrug-
gle was ended, strikes were a thing
of the past, Socialism was an outworn
dogma. The big thing was the “High-
er Strategy of Labor” (no-strike, speed-
up, policy), labor banks, and class col-
laboration on every front.

This capitalist nonsense became the
oﬂicial policy of the A. F. of L. and
railroad unions, beginning in 1923. The

 

C

ON THE QUESTION OF REVISIONISM

result was that ‘these labor organiza-
tions, already weakened by serious strike
defeats during the big postwar anti-
union drive, became little better than
speed-up agencies for the employers,
grievously neglecting the interests of the
workers. Consequently trade union
morale sank to zero and for the first
time in history the labor movement
failed to increase its membership dur-
ing a period of “prosperity.”

It is one of the brightest pages in
the history of our Party that we fought
militantly (even though often on a too
narrow basis) against this whole drunk-
en orgy of class collaboration, many
of our best ﬁghters being expelled from
theunions, deprived of their jobs, ar-
rested, and otherwise persecuted for
doing, so. In spite of this policy of
struggle, however, the poison of Amer-
ican imperialist propaganda managed

to seep into our Party’s ranks.

Its chief voice was Iay Lovestone,
who later became a renegade. Reﬂect-
ing the propaganda of the great trusts,
Lovestone added his voice to the chorus
of praise of American capitalists._ In
our Party he developed his theory of
“American exceptionalism,” the sub-
stance of which was that capitalism in
this country had become so strong and
progressive that it was no longer sub-
ject to the general economic laws gov-
erning the recurring capitalist crises.
The practical effects of Lovestone’s re-
visionism were to tend to disarm our
Party’s militancy, to sow false prosper-
ity illusions among the masses, and to
subordinate the workers to the capital-
ists’ proﬁt—making orgy in this country
and their imperialist program abroad.
After a bitter struggle Lovestone’s re-
visionism was exposed and he was ex-
pelled from the Party, whereupon he

35

proceeded to develop into a Soviet-hater
and a tool of the notorious Matthew
Woll.

As for the American “New Capital-
ism,” which was to regenerate the capi-
talist system of the world, it blew up
with a loud report in October, 1929.
And the United States, which was sup-
posed to have overcome the economic
contradictions of capitalism, according
to Carver, Chase, Tugwell, Lovestone

and many other bourgeois‘ theorists, .

actually suffered more devastatingly
from the unprecedented economic crisis
during 1929-1934 than any other coun-
try in the world.

AMERICAN IMPERIALIST
DRIVE FOR DOMINATION

Comrade Browder’s revisionismihas, if

like Lovestone’s, also developed in a
period of American imperialist illusions
and upswing. Even before World War
II began there were powerful voices
among the big capitalists clamoring for
American world domination, a notori-
ous case in point being Henry Luce,
with his “American Century” theories.
And since the war has been under
way, this striving for American im-
perialistic dominance has grown, until
now it is manifestly the basic deter-
mination of American big capital.

In the main the great capitalists of
this country have supported the war-
in their own way. But it would be silly
to think that in doing so they have had

_the. same democratic aspirations as

the American people, or even of the
Roosevelt government. For the most
part they have seen a good chance to
knock out a couple of very dangerous
imperialist rivals and thereby to lay the
basis for American imperialist advance-
ment. All through the war they would

 

 

 

36 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

have been happy to make a negotiated
peace with Hitler to their own advan-
tage and at the expense of the Soviet
Union and the democratic forces of the
world. And now that Hitler is smashed,
their imperialist designs become all the
more apparent, as witness their behavior
at the San Francisco conference of the
United Nations. Such elements see the
weakened position of other capitalist
states, as contrasted with the great
.strength of the United States, and they
want to realize on this situation in such
wise that they can dictate to the rest

V of the world, including the U.S.S.R.

As the National Committee’s resolu-

: tion points out, American ﬁnance capi-

tal, fearful of democratic developments
in Europe and ‘desirous of world control
for itself, is now embarking upon a pol-
icy of imperialistic aggrandizement

' which, if it is not checked‘ by the demo-

cratic forces of the world, can have the
most disastrous consequences, not only
to big capital itself, but also to the
great objectives laid down in the con-
ferences of Moscow, Teheran, and Yal-
‘ta.
A Although American ﬁnance capital
strives to conceal its imperialistic am-
bitions under pretenses of the United
States using its world power for altru-
istic ends, nevertheless these ambitions
are clear, not only from big capital’s
practical policies, but also from the
writings of many of its spokesmen-~
-conservative, liberal and labor. Thus,
Thomas E. Dewey’s spectacular de-
mand of the Mackinac Republican con-
ference for a United States-Great Brit-
ain alliance was obviously an attempt to
set up a domination over the U.S.S.R.,
and with it the rest of the world.
Eric Iohnston’s -book, America Unlim-
ited, is an essay on how to capture the

trade of the world and to paralyze
ideologically the American people in
the face of the power drive of finance
capital. Walter Lippmann’s volume,
United States War Aims, with its con-
ception of a great “Atlantic Commu-
nity,” consisting of the allied American
and British empires, plus all the coun-
tries of central and western Europe is
manifestly a program for American
world domination.. The Soviet trade
union journal, The War and the Work-
ing Class, March 1, 1945, correctly
designates the imperialist character. not
only of Senator Vandenberg, but also
of his associates, the Hoovers, Tafts,
Deweys, Landons, McCormicks, Pat-
tersons, Hearsts, and other spokesmen
of big capital when it says:

The whole content of Vanden-
berg’s speech . . . is a mask to con-
ceal his pretentious claims for the es-
tablishment of the dictatorship of one
Great Power over all the other pow-
ers, great, medium and small.

As in the r92o’s but under different
forms, the present actively expansionist
policies of American imperialism evoke
a response in the labor movement, as is
evidenced by the attitude of such ﬁg-
ures as Matthew Woll and by many
policies of the A. F. of L. Executive
Council. Also, the wild attacks of
Norman Thomas, David Dubinsky and
other Social-Democrats against the So-
viet Union have their roots in the ex-
pansionist program of American im-
perialism.

BROWDER AND
AMERICAN IMPERIALISM

Our Party does not live in a politi-
cal vacuum. It is exposed to all the

illusions and pressures of capitalism;

 

ON THE QUESTION OF REVISIONISM 37‘

hence it should surprise no Marxist that
the present drive of American imperial-
ism for world power should ﬁnd cer-
tain echoes within the ranks of the
Party. The tragedy of the situation is
that it is precisely Comrade Browder
who is giving voice to these imperialist
illusions in our Party, especially with
regard to the postwar situation. And
he is doing this under elaborate pre-
tenses of a discerning and ﬂexible
Marxism-Leninism.

In the postwar world, which will face
gigantic problems of industrial recon-
struction and development, the United
States, with its tremendous economic
resources, is bound to play a very im-
portant role. What Comrade Browder
does not see, however, is that if the
role of the United States is to help in
the realization of the programs of Mos-
cow, Teheran and Yalta, this can only
be accomplished if the broad masses
of this country, especially the trade
union movement, are very much on the
alert to see to it that imperialist trends
upon the part of our Government and
the great capitalists are curbed and
democratic policies imposed. The great
goals of victory over fascism and the
achievement of a lasting peace, laid
down at Moscow, Teheran and Yalta,
can be realized, but only upon the basis
of eternal vigilance by the combined
democratic forces of the world. Brow-
der, contrary to this, is quite willing
to leave the whole matter to the “in-
telligence” and “enlightened” self-in-
terest of the big capitalists. ’

The imperialists could hardly ask
for anything better than the free hand
that Browder would so readily grant
them. It is hard to conceive of a situa-
tion more favorable to American im-
perialism than the belief, such as Brow-

der has expressed many times that we
can rely upon these capitalists’ “en-
lightenment” to follow a constructive
and democratic world policy. The gen-
eral result of such a reliance would be
that American imperialism, without any
popular checks upon it, would run hog-
wild and would soon have the whole
world in a worse mess than it now is.
Of course, Comrade Browder does not
want any such situation, but Lenin
has long since taught us that the ob-
jective results of political policies bear
no necessary relation to the subjective
desires of their initiators.

That the practical effects of Comrade
Browder’s revisionist ideas are to fa-
cilitate the policies of American impe-
rialism is beyond question.
show this by indicating brieﬂy afew
of his major proposals and their impe-
rialistic implications:

I. When Comrade Browder proposes
that the United States in the postwar
period should set out to build up a
.$4o,ooo,ooo,ooo yearly export trade, as
he did in his book Teheran: Our Path
in War and Peace, he is in fact calling
upon American imperialism to make
a drive virtually to monopolize the mar-
kets of the world.

. 2. When Browder says (page 79 of
his book Teheran: Our Path in War
and Peace), “I am entirely willing to

help the free enterprisers realize they

$4o,ooo,ooo,ooo foreign market that is
required entirely and completely by
their own chosen methods,” he is tail-
ing the workers after the bourgeoisie
and surrendering the American people
into the hands of the imperialists.

3. When Browder proposes that the
great capitalists of the United States
have a free hand to carry through a
postwar program of “industrialization

Let me-

 

38 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

of all the devastated and undeveloped
areas of the world,” he is in fact pro-
posing American‘ economic and politi-
cal world hegemony.

4. When Browder says that “Britain
and the United States have closed the
books ﬁnally and forever upon their old
expectation that the Soviet Union is
going to disappear some day,” he is
blinding the people of this and other
countries to the dangerous machina-
tions of American and British impe-
rialists against the U.S.S.R.—“a con-

summation devoutly to be wished” by,

these sharks.

5. When Browder fails to signalize
the danger of American imperialism
(and he denies, incredible though it
may seem, that there is any such im-
perialist menace), he is hiding from
the American people the greatest dan-
ger to future world peace and progress.
The imperialists could hardly ask for
anything more convenient to their
schemes of exploitation and domina-
tion.

6. When Browder fights against the
American people curbing the monopo-
lies, as he does, actually he is freeing
from restraint the worst enemies of
democracy, the generators of economic
chaos, imperialist aggression, fascism
and war.

7. When Browder spreads illusions.

among the workers to the effect that
there will be a long period of class
peace after the war during which they
can safely bind themselves with a no-
strike pledge, and that the employers
will voluntarily radically improve the
workers’ real wages, he is tending to
paralyze the working class in the face

‘ of the provocative attacks of big capi-

talists upon the trade unions and the
workers’ living standards.

   

8. When Browder (Daily Worker, ,

April 8, 1944) hails the Labor-Manage-
ment Charter without a word of criti-
cism and deplores only that it is “un-
fortunate” the NAM is not a partner
to the Charter, and when (Daily Work-
er, April 14, 1944), he proposes that
the incentive wage be adopted generally
in American industry in the postwar
period, he is opening wide the doors for
the speeding up and more intensiﬁed
exploitation of the workers of this coun-
try.

9. When Browder dissolves the C.P.
into the C.P.A., he is weakening the
most dynamic force that the workers
possess to counteract the reactionary
activities of the great trusts at home and
abroad.

One would have to be blind politi-
cally not to recognize that all these
revisionist theories and proposals of
Browde-r’s dovetail with the interests of
the great capitalists and that they are,
in fact, a reﬂection of the aggressive pro-

gram of American imperialism. Con— -

trary to Browder’s faith in the big bour-
geoisie, ‘the democratic forces of the
country and the world will have to use
all their united political strength to
achieve complete victory, to establish a
democratic peace, to win full employ-

irnent and a better life generally.

BROWDER’S REVISIONISM
IN THEORY

Bedazzled by the United States’ great
power in this war, by its enormous in-
dustrial expansion and output, by its
gigantic political prestige, by the many
concessions the capitalists made (under
compulsion) to the workers during the
Roosevelt regime——Comrade Browder
in his present writings and policies leaps

to the revisionist conclusion, especially.

 

 

\

ON THE QUESTION OF REVISIONISM I 39

after the Teheran agreement, that
American capitalism and its capitalist
class, including reactionary ﬁnance
capital, has in some mysterious way be-
come progressive.

Upon this false basis, Comrade Brow-
der proceeds to build up a capitalist
utopiain his book, Te/zeran: Our Path
in War and Peace, in which he sees
the “enlightened” great capitalists of
this country, acting in “their true class
interest,” leading our country and the
world into an era of unprecedented
democracy, industrial expansion and
mass well-being. With this rosy picture
in mind, he calls upon the workers
to join hands harmoniously” with the
capitalist class in realizing it. He tries
to stretch postwar national unity to in-
clude reactionary ﬁnance capital. All
of which fantasy, of course, would boil
down in reality to the workers in this
country subordinating themselves to a
more intensiﬁed exploitation at home,
to the world being soon dragged into
a fresh growth of fascism and a new
world war.

Comrade Browder’s revisionist ideas

” violate the most fundamental principle

of Marxism-Leninism. They are more
akin to the bourgeois notions of Eric
Iohnston than to the scientiﬁc prin-
ciples of Marx and Lenin. As I said
in my letter of January 20, 1944, to the
National Commitee,i “In this (Brow-
der’s) picture, American imperialism
virtually disappears, there remains hard-
ly a trace of the class struggle, and So-
cialism plays practically no role what-
ever.” Browder’s revisionism, while it
goes in the general Social-Democratic
direction of subordinating the workers
to capitalist domination, is actually not
Social-Democratic, but bourgeois lib-
eral.

Browder attempts to liquidate the
class struggle by preaching an illu-
sory harmony of interest between the
workers and their classenemies, the big
capitalists, in the postwar period. For,
if what Browder says were true, that
the capitalists would, of their own voli-
tion, radically improve the workers’
real wages, there would remain little
or no basis for the class struggle. Brow-
der’s idea, too, that the American big
capitalists, in their “true class interests”
virtually must make them not only
raise the workers’ living standards but
live in friendly harmony with the
U.S.S.R., has nothing in common with
the Marxist conception of classes and
their roles. There is no Marxian prin-
ciple which holds that social classes
“must” follow “their true class inter-
ests.” Indeed, history is replete with
examples of classes which, under imme-
diate economic, political or ideologi-
cal pressures, have violated their “true
class interests,” with disastrous conse-
quences to themselves. A striking case
in point was the way in which the

British ruling class tended to follow the

policy of appeasing Hitler to the point
where its world position would have
been irretrievably shattered had not the
U.S.S.R. become involved -in the war.
To appease the big capitalists and thus
to make sure that they would follow
their “true class interests,” Comrade
Browder not only dissolved the Com-
munist Party, but he was also prepared,
if he could do so, to liquidate the Com-
munist Political Association and to give
up even our Communist ideology.
Browder also tries to by-pass Ameri-
can imperialism theoretically. In fact,
his book, Te/zeran: Our Path in War
and Peace, is an attempt to prove that
the epoch of imperialism has passed and

 

 

  

40 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

that we are now in a period of inevit-
able friendly collaboration between the
capitalist and socialist sectors of the
world; a collaboration, which Browder
would not base upon the strength of the
U.S.S.R., the colonial countries, the new
war-born democracies, and the labor
movement of the world (as it must be
if it is to exist), but upon the good
will of the great capitalists, particularly
the Americans, whose “enlightenment,”
“high moral sense” and “true class in-
terests” will dictate to them this col-
laborationist course. Browder, indeed,
undertakes to wipe out American impe-
rialism regarding its relations with the
U.S.S.R., and he also draws idyllic pic-
tures of how American big capital will,
under our Goverment’s auspices, in-
augurate great campaigns of industriali-
zation and democratiization through-
out the world. According to him, our
capitalists would make the rest of the
world free and prosperous whether it
wanted to be so or not. For, says Brow-

der (on page 79):

There is not a government in the
capitalist or colonial world that
would dare refuse or withdraw from
such a partnership, once the United
States made clear the benefits that
would accrue to all concerned.

Browder also seeks to do away with
Lenin’s theory of the decay of capital-
ism in the imperialist stage, and there-
with, he would even shelve the whole
Marxian concept of the necessity for
socialism. There can be no other con-
clusions from his argumentation; for if
it is possible for world capitalism under

. the leadership of the United States and

especially under the tutelage of “en-
lightened” American ﬁnance capital

 
 

to overcome its general crisis and to
embark upon a new period of exuberant
and long continued economic expan-
sion, then there would be no possibility
to establish socialism in any thinkable
perspective. Thus, Marx and Lenin
would be wrong and Browder right.
There is serious reason to conclude that
when Comrade Browder cast aside the
slogan of socialism (as an educational
issue) i.n January, 1944, he did not mere-
ly put it in mothballs, to be taken out
again when its advocacy would be
more convenient; but very probably he
thought he was done with it for good.
In his theory of a capitalist system
capable of overcoming’ its basic contra-
dictions there is no room for socialism,
even in the most remote sense.

That Comrade Browder was attempt-
ing to have our Party discard basic
principles of Marxism-Leninism and

to adopt a bourgeois-liberal program is '

incontestable. In his Bridgeport speech
eighteen months ago, he gave a clear
indication of this when he said: “Old
formulas and old prejudices are going
to be of no use whatever to us as guides
to find our way in the new world.”
What are the “old formulas and old
prejudices” that Browder warns us are
useless? These are none other than
our Marxist-Leninist analysis of the
class struggle, of imperialism, of social-
ism. All these Browder himself had
already abandoned, and he was trying
to get our Party to do likewise.

BROWDER’S REVISIONISM
IN PRACTICE

Comrade Browder especially began
to develop his opportunistic ideas
shortly after his return from Atlanta
(although roots of them can be found

earlier). At that time the Party had,

 

 

 

ON THE QUESTION OF REVISIONISM / 41;

a sound war policy, worked out during
his incarceration; including all-out sup-
port of the war, support of the Roosevelt

Administration with criticism, national

unity of all pro-war elements, includ-
ing ‘pro-Roosevelt capitalists, the
achievements of maximum war produc-

v tion, the labor no-strike pledge, and an
‘active defense of the masses’ economic

and political rights as a war necessity.

’ Browder almost immediately started to

project his opportunism into this essen-
tially correct wartime policy. One of
the ﬁrst signs of this was his utopian
handling of the question of a central-
ized war economy. He developed his
opportunistic position further in his
book, Victory and After. And his re-
visionist point of view ﬁnally came to
full expression in his volume, Telzeran:
Our Pat}; in War and Peace.

The revisionistic ideas contained in
these works and in Comrade Browder’s
other writings and policies, not only
introduced confusion into our political
thinking, but also hindered our practi-
cal work in support of the war. In my
article in the Daily Worker of June 10,
I listed a number of the more important

of our shortcomings and mistakes dur-

ing the war, bred of Browder’s oppor-
tunism,‘ a list which, besides those noted
above, included inadequate criticism of
the Roosevelt Administration; failure
to demand a coalition government with
labor as a full partner; rejection of the
demand that international labor should
be represented in all wartime confer-
ences of the great powers; proposals
for a joint Repub1ican—Democratic tick-
et in the national elections, which, if
adopted, would have eliminated Roose-
velt as a candidate, etc. To this list
could be added many others, in almost

all branches of our Party work. Such,

 

for example, as the tendency, in the-
earlier stages of the war, to neglect to
press militantly for Negro rights; the:
underestimation, for a time, of the nec-
essity for increased wage rates for the:
workers in our eagerness to have the in-
centive wage established; and the fail-
ure to make a major issue in the ranks:
of labor and among the public gener-
ally of the vital matter of the Govern-
ment and the trade union movement
giving our armed forces a thoroughly
democratic education regarding the"
causes and purposes of the war.
Through all of Comrade Browder’s»
theoretical and practical errors runs»
the ever—present thread of a tendency
to rely upon the big bourgeoisie for‘
national leadership, to appease reaction-
ary ﬁnance capital, to underestimate the-:
independent, democratic role of labor"
and other democratic forces, and espe-
cially of our Party, in the national anti-
fascist front. It is true that‘ the Corn-
munists stood second to none in their

war effort and made a record of which. i

the Party may well be proud. But we“
must admit that in the light of the ex-
itsing opportunities and the responsi-
bilities we fell short in many respects
precisely because of these opportunist:
errors.

Harmful during the war, Comrade»
Browder’s false policies would have

been disastrous if they had been car- ’

ried over into the postwar period. Once’
their German and Japanese imperialist
rivals are both disposed of, the Ameri-
can ﬁnance capitalists will feel freer to»
maneuver, in all probability within the
framework of the United Nations,.
against the U.S.S.R., Great Britain, and‘
the new democracies being born out of"
the war; they will also intensify their;
attacks upon the trade unions in this;

 

\

 

42
country. This is obvious from the
course of events since the end of the
European phase of the war. In such a
situation the democratic forces will have
to unite ﬁrmly in order to put into
reality the objectives of Teheran and
Yalta. Browder’s illusions about a long-
term of class peace in the United States
and of a smooth working together of
American big capital with our wartime
allies would be a brake upon this need-
ful struggle of the democratic masses
and peoples and would play right into
the hands of American imperialism.
Very probably, even if Duclos’ letter
had never arrived, our Party, under
the pressure of postwar tensions, would
of itself have thrown oﬂ Browder’s
revisionism and found its way to a cor-
rect policy. Indeed, there were already
many tendencies in this direction. This
correction of _our Party’s policy, how-
ever, could have come only in a strug-
gle against Browder, as is quite evident
from his present resistance to such a
- change. One of the basic reasons why
the Duclos letter was so quickly en-
dorsed by our Party is precisely because
the end of the European stage of the
war threw into the spotlight the bank-
ruptcy of Browder’s opportunistic poli-
cies.

HOW DID WE DEVELOP
OUR REVISIONISM?

. How did it happen that Comrade
Browder, could have our Party adopt
as policy his crude revisionism, his
apology for American imperialism,
which has confused our Party’s think-
ing, weakened its practical work,
checked its growth, and injured its pres-
tige among the broad masses?

First, I should say, it was because
of an inadequate Marxist-Leninist

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

training on the part of our leadership.
Although in the Party many comrades
opposed Browder’s line and there was
much uncertainty and uneasiness gen-
erally, the leadership was not able to
penetrate his bourgeois sophistries and

to expose their anti-Marxist character;

The fact that our Party, throughout
the war and even for some years earlier,
had been in collaboration with the pro-
Roosevelt minority section of the bour-
geoisie, gave Comrade Browder a con-
venient jumping-off place for his at-
tempt to have us cooperate with the
whole bourgeoisie, including its de-
cisive, reactionary sections.
Party was not able to see throughthis
opportunistic maneuver is‘ proof posi-
tive that we are badly in need of
strengthening our basic theoretical train-
ing, of refreshing our understanding
from those “old (Marxist-Leninist)
books” and “old formulas” that Brow-
der wants us to discard as obsolete.‘
A second, and very decisive reason for
our Party_’s falling victim to Comrade
Browder’s revisionism was the lack of
political discussion and democracy in
the Party. During the past several
years we have allowed ourselves to de-
part widely from the principles of dem-
ocratic centralism. Browder has been
conceded altogether excessive authority
—to such an extent, in fact, that his
word virtually became law in the Party.
He was in the habit of simply laying
down the policy, and few ventured to
dispute his arbitrary pronouncements.
Under such conditions, democratic dis-
cussion, self-criticism and collective lead-
ership became almost extinct in the top
committees of our Party. Besides this,

the Party leaders and members poured‘

out upon Browder an impermissable
deluge of adulation and super-praise

 

That our ‘

ON THE QUESTION OF REVISIONISM A 43

which placed him almost beyond the

realm of our criticism.

In this situation there was no real
political discussion of Comrade Brow-
der’s report on Teheran when he un-
expectedly produced his whole opportu-
nist line at the January, 1944, meeting
of the National Committee. The fact
that my letter at the time protesting
to the National Committee against
Browder’s revisionism never reached the
membership was due to the lack of
democracy in the Party. If I had at-
tempted to take my letter to the Party
after it was rejected at the enlarged
meeting of the Political Bureau on
February 8, 1944, it would have resulted
in my immediate expulsion and prob-
ably a split in the Party. Comrade
Browder made this perfectly clear at the
meeting in question. Hence, for the
sake of Party unity, I had to conﬁne
by opposition to Browder’s revisionism
to the National Committee.

In assessingthe blame for the seri-
ous error our Party has made, the
whole top leadership, especially the
National Board, bears a heavy responsi-
bility. For despite Browder’s excessive
authority, if the members of the Board,
or even a substantial minority of them,
had taken a stand against Browder’s

_opportunism he could have been de-

feated. Unfortunately, however, no

such development took place; Hence

the responsibility of the Board is great.

But the overwhelming share of the
responsibility of the error rests with
Comrade Browder himself. He ori i-
nated the opportunistic policies, fie
theoretically developed them, he used
all his power and authority in the Par-
tv as a long-time international Commu-
nist leader to have them adopted. And
now, refusing to admit his error, he has
voted and written against the National
Committee’s resolution which corrects
his errors. It is not too much to say

that had any other leader in the Party‘

than Comrade Browder presented such
a distortion of the Teheran Conference
to our Party it would have been re-
jected as rank opportunism. But Brow-
der was able to put it across because of
his great prestige and his over—central-
ized authority.

All this goes to emphasize the basic
need for the development of true dem-
ocratic centralism in our Party. In the
new leadership that will grow out of
this situation there must be not one-man
control, but a genuine collectivity of ef-
fort. There must also be a re-estab-
lishment of self-critcism and free politi-
cal discussion. Only upon the basis
of these correct Leninist principles can
the all-important Communist clarity,
unity and discipline be developed. . . .

SOME ASPECTS OF OUR
P0llﬁ|ES AND IASKS

By EUGENE DENNIS

Report to the National Committee, C.P.A., Izme 18-20, 1945.

It is with deep humility that.I sub-
mit this report on behalf of the National
Board. For, despite the positive esti-
mation of my position made by Com-
rade Foster, I realize that I bear a full
share of the responsibility for the main
errors and mistakes which the National
Board of our Communist Political As-

sociation has made.

Generally speaking, I have not been
among those who considered that the
objectives of Teheran I and Crimea
would be fulﬁlled automatically and
without the most active intervention of
the masses. I have not been one of
those who minimized the resolute strug-
gle which must be waged against pro-
fascist reaction, or who underestimated
the independent role an.d activity of la-
bor and the people.

Yet it is a fact that I have held and
fostered certain opportunist illusions re-
garding the postwar role of the anti-
Axis sections of monopoly capital. And
in so doing I participated in, and con-
tributed toward, the main errors which
our national leadership has committed.
Besides, on such speciﬁc questions as
liquidating the C.P.A. in the South, as
well as in incorrectly estimating the
significance of the Labor-Management
Charter, I bear a particular responsibil-
ity.

Moreover, while I have taken‘ issue

44

with and opposed a number of individ-
ual and separate mistakes which the col-
lective leadership of our Association
committed, it should be recognized that
I did not draw the full conclusions
from these, nor did I ﬁght as effectively
and consistently as was required. Like
most other comrades in our leadership
I have always endeavored to preserve
the unity of our Communist movement
as the apple of our eye. But in this
connection I have sometimes tended
to overlook the essential fact that Com-
munist unity must be forged without
making any concessions on questions of
principle, even “minor” or “tempor-
ary.”

In View of this, I wish to re-em-
phasize that I submit this report with
a profound sense of humility and with
a deep realization of my own responsi-
bility for the errors which our National
Board has made.

=3? =1!‘ 1%

The main reports and documents
upon which our discussions are based
are already before you. These are the
draft resolution of the National Board
adopted on June 2, the article of Com-
rade Duclos, Comrade Foster’s report
to this plenum, as well as the highly
important political letter which Com-

I

 

rade Foster submitted to our National
Convention in February 1944.

From these the following facts are
self-evi.dent:

First, during the course of the anti-
Hitler war, in which we Communists
made sterling contributions, our Asso-
ciation made a number of basic oppor-
tunist errors and mistakes. We started
to depart from and revise certain Marx-
ist theories and principles. We tended
to weaken and liquidate the vanguard
role of our Communist movement as
the independent Marxist political party
of the working class.

The responsibility for this oppor-
tunism rests not only upon Comrade
Browder, who bears the heaviest re-
sponsibility for our notorious revision-
ism. The responsibility for our errors
and mistakes likewise rests upon our
entire national leadership, and in the
first place upon our National Board.

, Those revisionist departures from

p Marxism which we were making up to

recently, adversely affected the applica-
tion of our correct policies for win-
ning the war, and were disorienting our
Communist organization and other anti-
fascists as regards coping with the new
and complex problems which now arise
as we enter the postwar period.
Secondly, the reports and material
before you indicate that the majority
of the National Board noiw understands
and is attempting to rectify its former
errors and deviations. Aided by the
wise and invaluable counsel of Com-
rade Duclos, learning from our- own

. experiences and the/latest international

developments, and helped greatly by
the essentiallly sound position of Com-
rade Foster, who warned us some I7
months ago of the dangerous opportu-
nist path we were embarking upon,

9

 
   

SOME ASPECTS OF OUR POLICIES AND TASKS 45

we have begun to overcome our mis-
takes and correctly to reorient ourselves
and the Association. Already, most of
the National Committee and the over-
whelming majority of our membership
have expressed themselves decisively
and enthusiastically in favor of the
main viewpoint of Duclos’ article and
the main line of the resolution of the
Board.

However, the fact also remains that
Comrade Browder, as well as those
relatively few comrades who continue
to support his erroneous non-Marxist
theories and policies, are resisting the
rectiﬁcation of our past mistakes. Com-
rade Browder stubbornly clings to a
false postwar orientation. He is actively
opposing the sound political line which
is now being hammered out by our Na-
tional Board in conjunction with our
membership. In so doing, Comrade
Browder is compounding his previous
errors and embarking on an even more
dangerous course—-a peculiar kind of
non—Marxian “isolationism” and Ameri-
can exceptionalism.

=I Ii ‘ it

Before analyzing the nature and
basic source of Comrade Browder’s
errors and thus also the errors of our
entire National leadership, as well ‘as
why these errors happened, it is worth
while and enlightening to examine the
present position of Comrade Browder
in respect to a series of key questions.

Take the cardinal question of Ameri-
can-Soviet relations and cooperation,
which every anti-fascist and most
patriotic Americans understand is the
cornerstone of national and world se-
curity: Together with the National
Board, Comrade Browder recognizes
the paramount need and the great possi-

  

  

 

bilities for maintaining and extending
American-Soviet friendship and peace-
ful collaboration after the war, as part
of and as the heart of the anti-Hitlerite
coalition. Browder also agrees with the
Board that the position of the State De-
partment and the American delegation
at San Francisco on a host of vital
questions, as well as the slowness and
inconsistency with which Washington
and London move to realize the con-
cords of Yalta, create strains and ﬁs-
sures in the coalition, endanger the
unity of the Big Three.

But Comrade Browder diﬁers funda-
mentally from the position of the Na-
tional Board on how to prevent Amer-
ica from vacillating and departing from
the agreement of Yalta in the future,

on how to prevent divisions within’

the coalition, on how to consolidate
and strengthen American-Soviet unity.
Browder considers that/ the “coinci-
dence of interests” of capitalist America
and the Soviet Union-—the joint inter-
ests of our nations arising from the
common need of establishing a durable
peace and prosperous and mutually
beneﬁcial trade—predetermines the fu-

'ture role and position of the decisive

sections of American monopoly capi-
tal in respect to future American-So-
viet relations. Browder counts first of

’ all on the “intelligence” of the most

“far—s'ighted” sections of the bourgeoisie
as the main “guarantee” that the cru-
cial necessity of American-Soviet amity
and cooperation will more or less auto-
matically overcome and surmount ex-
isting difficulties and differences and
will suﬂice to curb the aggressive im-
perialist aims and policies, including
the anti—Soviet hostility, of powerful
sections of American ﬁnance capital.

The National Board believes that the

.46 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

common interests of the United States

and the U.S.S.R. are real, and are strong
and compelling factors, without which
there could be no basis for long-term
and friendly cooperation and peace. At
the same time, the Board also believes
that these interests in themselves, that
these favorable objective conditions,
neither can nor will automatically
determine America’s policies. We can-
not overlook the contradictions between
the capitalist and socialist system. We

cannot forget the lessons of the League’

of Nations, Munich, or World War II.

This is why we consider that Ameri-
can-Soviet friendship and cooperation,
and the task of completing the destruc-
tion of fascism in Europe and every-
where, will not and cannot depend
upon the “intelligence” of this or that
section of monopoly capital. It will de-
pend above all and to a large extent
upon the welding of a ﬁrmer and more
solid national democratic coalition
within our country—a coalition resting
upon the power and unity of labor and
all other democratic forces especially
upon the working farmer, the Negro
people, small businessmen, professionals

‘ and intellectuals.

In this connection, we also take into
account the fact that there still are
certain inﬂuential capitalist groupings
which, for one or another reason, sup-
port the Crimean decisions, and we con-
sider that it is possible and necessary
for labor and the popular forces to
ﬁght for these objectives together with
such capitalists. But equally, we believe
that labor and the people cannot rely
on any capitalist group or elsements to
maintain a steadfast position or to
struggle against fascism to the end. We
believe, now more than ever, that
within the camp of national unity,

y The

SOME ASPECTS OF OUR

within the national democratic coali-
tion, labor, together with other progres-
sive forces, must not only be the back-
bone and the main driving force, but
must play the leading role.

Further, in respect to the decisive
question of American-Soviet relations,
the National Board likewise differs
from Comrade Browder in two other
important respects. Unlike Browder,
we do not believe that the U.S.A. fol-
lows at the tailend or is the naive pawn
of British imperialism. We consider,
while world capitalism has emerged
from this war weakened by the defeat
of Hitler Germany and will be further
weakened by the defeat of imperialist
Iapan, that the U.S.A. is emerging from
the war as the strongest imperialist
power—economically, militarily and
politically.

The U.S. is not the servile and junior,

partner of the British Lion. Quite the
contrary. Furthermore, in the postwar
period, U.S. and British economic and
political rivalries are bound to sharpen

 and become more acute. In fact, after

the war, Anglo-American rivalry and
contradictions will constitute a main

source of conflicts endangering world

peace and stability. And in the struggle
againestvits chief imperialist rival, the
U.S. will play an increasingly aggres-
sive role.

However, we do not conclude from
this that all is hopeless, that America
inevitably and irrevocably will come
forward only in a reactionary and pro-
fascist role in the world of tomorrow.
relationships of international
forces, and theestrong progressive cur-
rents within our country are such ‘that
it is possible for labor and all democratic
forces—if they are united on an anti-
fascist program and wage a resolute

struggle—to influence effectively the
course of America, at home and abroad.

The point is, that neither American
nor British imperialism will be weak-
ened, nor their reactionary conflicts and
aims thwarted, by Browder’s appeal to
their “intelligence” and “true” class in-
terests; nor by his fantastic blueprints
designed to soften their antagonisms,
to divide up peacefully the world
market, or to arrive at arrangements
whereby Downing Street would volun-
tarily liberate the British Empire. Amer-

ican, just as -British imperialism, will be

weakened and curbed, particularly
when the American working class and
people, by their unity and struggle,
weaken and undermine the position of

‘the most reactionary and aggressive

forces of finance capital, and establish
closer and ﬁrmer unity of action with
the freedom-loving peoples of all lands.

Moreover, we of the National
Board cannot agree with Browder’s
fatalistic position and his arbitrarily
chosen alternatives of the future course
of world development. For instance,
we do believe that if the imperialist
bourgeoisie of the U.S. and Britain
reneged on Crimea and were to force
a rupture in American-Soviet-British
relations.—that this would engender new
aggressions, great suffering, damage
and untold hardship for the world, and
not least of all for the American peo-
ple. This is why everything must be
done to preserve and strengthen the
unity of the Big Three.

Yet we cannot agree that the only
alternative to Browder’s concept of the
Grand Alliance is chaos, anarchy and
the end of civilization. Browder has not
yet drawn all the necessary conclusions
from this war of national liberation in
which there has emerged a stronger and

a more influential Soviet Union, a new
and democratic Europe and a stronger
world labor movement. These historic
developments certainly are an indispens-
able part of the world of reality; they
are an essential basis and an organic
_part of the anti-Hitlerite coalition--a
part and basis which has already created
an entirely new relationship of world

forces, irrevocably strengthening the

cause of world democracy and national
freedom.

In this connection, it should not
be forgotten that out of this war there
has also emerged a stronger and more
iriﬂuential American labor movement.
The supreme task now is to forge la-
bor’s unity of action, locally and na-
tionally, and to make American labor
fully conscious of its vanguard role and
its immediate historic task to complete

the destruction of fascism, and toward

this end to affect decisively, in alliance
with all democratic forces, America’s
policies, both foreign and domestic.
This, admittedly, is no easy task. For
the labor movement is sharply divided,
and the Greens, Wolls, Dubinskys,
Hutchesons and Lewises still retain
positions of great power. However, the
conditions are ripe, and the need is so
great, that it is now possible to make
-new advances in welding labor’s anti-
fascist unity. This can and must be
done. i
* * 3‘

Next, take the question of the slogans
-of action set forth in Part I of the Draft
Resolution of the Board. With certain
reservations and one basic difference,
Browder alleges that he could agree
with this immediate program of action.

Leaving aside the “reservations,”
what is Comrade Browder’s stated and

most basic disagreement with the slo-
gans of action? Browder claims that the
National Board has omitted what he
terms, the decisive question of any na-
tional unity program for the post-
war period, namely, the question of
“markets.” Browder still contends that
the solution of postwar markets, espe-
cially of foreign markets, on a scale
capable of absorbing the entire produc-
tive output of U.S. wartime industry
and production levels, remains the key
and heart of any sound reconvelrsion
and postwar plan for securing economic
prosperity.

Obviously, the question of markets,
both foreign and domestic, is not un-
important, especially as these will have
a pronounced effect upon the postwar
levels of production and employment
in the U.S.A.

What then, let us ask, are the pro-
spects for expanding American postwar
trade in the immediate postwar period?

For one thing, the defeat of German,
and subsequently of Japanese imperial-
ism, as well as the vast destruction of

property, plant capacity and capital

goods during the war, will enable both
the U.S. and Great Britain to increase
their share of the world market, in com-
parison with pre-war levels, particularly
during the first period of rehabilitation
and reconstruction——though it must be
emphasized this will take place under
conditions of sharpened Anglo-Amen
ican rivalry, and sooner or later under
circumstances of a “depression” and a
cyclical crisis.

However, to realize the great possi-
bilities which are now open for con-
siderably extending American foreign
trade—possibly from $7,ooo,ooo,ooo to
$ro,ooo,ooo,ooo annually——’during the
early postwar years, as well as to achieve

 

 

 

SOME ASPECTS OF OUR POLICIES AND TASKS T 49 _

a level of exports for a longer period
of time considerably above the prewar
level of 1939-—-it is necessary, as the Re-
solution of the Board proposes, to
achieve the following conditions:

(a) To ensure a stable and longterm
peace.

(b) To guarantee that liberated
Europe develops further along demo-
cratic, anti-fascist lines.

(c) To promote a free and demo-
cratic Asia.

((1) To extend American longterm
and low-interest credits and loans to all
democratic nations for purposes of
economic reconstruction and industriali-
zation-——and on the basis of non-inter-
ference in the internal affairs of these
nations.

Undoubtedly, the various proposals
in the Resolution which are designed to
promote international economic co-
operation and world trade, can and
should beiimplemented. Equally, it may
be necessary to augment that section of
the resolution dealing with reconversion
and how to promote the ﬁght for
6o,ooo,ooo jobs.

But, it is the ﬁrm opinion of the
Board that on the question of markets
‘we cannot adopt the “amendments” and
alternative economic proposals and
concepts which Comrade Browder now
advances and which are essentially the
same as those he set forth in his book
Te/zeran.

This is our considered opinion be-
cause B,rowder’s postwar economic
views contain, among other things, two

A basic ﬂaws:

‘Firstly, Browder remains obsessed
with the idea that the way to improve
the wage, and living standards of the

‘ 7 American people is to try and solve all

the market and proﬁt problems of
monopoly capitalism, that is, to try and

make capitalism work. This is why

Browder puts forward an economic pro-
gram for monopoly capital, for trying
to. overcome the anarchy and contradic-
tions of capitalist production, for trying
to bring about a super-organized cap-
italism “free” from crises.

Browder is also obsessed with the
idea that in the postwar period the
workers will not have to depend, first
of all, upon their own organized
strength and struggles; rather, he be-
lieves that they can advance their in-
terests by making one concession after
another to the monopolists.

However, the National Board be-
lieves that the way to promote jobs and
social security and to raise the purchas-
ing power of the working people--1
which we consider vital for the ex-
pansion of the domestic market-—de-
pends, among other things, upon how
we rally and unify labor and all anti-
fascists to struggle vigorously against
the efforts of most employers to utilize
the reconversion period to lower wages

and living standards, and to undermine _

the trade union movement. This is why
we stress the need for mobilizing the
masses today to ﬁght for improved
federal and state emergency unemploy-
ment insurance; to enact the Murray
Full Employment Bill and the Wagner-
Murray-Dingell Bill; to start a gigantic
federal and state public works and hous-
ing program, etc.

This, too, is why we place such great
emphasis upon the urgent need of pro-
tecting the trade unions, organizing the
unorganized, and developing labor’s
unity and independent political action.
But these key questions, which are or-
ganically connected‘ with the problem

 

 

.|

 

50 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

of markets, are seldom mentioned or
stressed by Browder.

Secondly, on the question of postwar
markets and economic perspectives,
Browder refuses to entertain any notion
of the embryonic or forthcoming econ-
omic crises in the U.S., whose clouds are
beginning even now to loom on the
horizon. Browder is still hypnotized by
his original opportunist illusions re-
garding the postwar possibility of a
long-term period of expanding produc-

/tion and full employment taking place

under present social conditions without
conflicts, crises or mass unemployment.

But what are the facts?

Present internal conditions in the
U.S.A. are now featured, in part, by
the present transition and shift from
wartime to a peacetime economy. This
process, which is taking place in the
midst of prosecuting the war against
Iapan and under circumstances of a

‘ greater concentration and centralization

of big capital, is accompanied by vast
dislocations in the economy and a
marked increase of unemployment.
This diﬂicult period of reconversion
may last one to two years. It probably
will merge with, or be followed by a
postwar economic “boom.”

But this “boom,” too, will be a boom
of a special kind. Whatever its length,
2, 3 or 5 years, it will develop unevenly,
advantageous primarily to the most
powerful, trusts, under conditions in
which there will be large-scale and
chronic unemployment and serious in-

A ternal struggles. Further, this postwar

economic “boom,” due to the inherent
contradictions of capitalism-, will inevit-
ably give rise to a cyclical crisis, to a
severe economic crisis-—and this will
take place despite the prospective ex-
pansion of America’s foreign trade in

the immediate postwar period. And if
we do not see this, and do not map out
a program of action to protect the in-
terests of the people along the lines set
forth in the Board’s Resolution, then
the monopolies, headed by their most
reactionary groups, may succeed in

’ utilizing that crisis for their own reac-

tionary ends, and along fascist lines.
There is also another aspect of the
slogans of action embodied in Part I of
the Resolution that Comrade Browder
objects to. He considers that our pro-
posals to curb the powers of the mo-
nopolies are sectarian, if not utopian.
But the contrary is true. Only by re-
solutely mobolizing the people to‘curb
the powers of the trusts and cartels will
it be possible greatly to expand -both
the foreign and domestic markets un-
der conditions more favorable to the
peoples. Only by curbing the mo-
nopolies can we seriously check and
defeat those American imperialists who
advocate a soft or compromise peace
with feudal—fascist Japan. Only by such
measures can we best promote today the
fullest rallying and uniﬁcation of the

national liberation forces in China, In-

donesia, the Philippines, and elsewhere,
thereby hastening victory over Iapan
and the free and democratic advance of
the peoples and nations of Asia. Only
by curbing the economic royalists now
can we most effectively prevent the
restoration or unbridled predatory

activity of the Anglo-American-German

cartels, the scuttling of the Crimean
decisions and the coming peace settle-
ment, and help put a halt to those who
want to plunder, rob and oppress the
liberated peoples. I «

it * =l=

There is also, and not least of all,

SCME ASPECTS OF OUR POLICIES AND TASKS 51

/the question of the dissolution of the

Communist Party. Broiwder still be-
lieves that there is nothing to worry
about in regard to this action. He even
has the audacity to state now—which
he didn’t do some 14 months ago——that
he realized when the decision to
establish the C.P.A. was taken that this
might cause diﬂiculties for a number
of Communist Parties in other lands in
the trying days of their national libera-
tion struggle. At the same time, Brow-
der insists that the dissolution of the
C.P. was an indispensable act necessary
to ensure victory in the 1944 elections
and advisable from the viewpoint of the
future role of the American Com—
munists.

However, what are the facts? The
dissolution of the C.P. in May 1944, as
Comrade Duclos indicates, caused
serious difficulties for a number of Com—
munist Parties in Europe. This in itself
makes clear that we had no right to
dissolve the C.P. For the interests of the
world working class, and therefore of
its vanguard parties, are basically iden-
tical, so that an injury to one can never
by anything but an injury to the others.

Moreover, the dissolution of our
Party, as we can see, accelerated
previous and all tendencies to put an
end to the independent role and posi-
tion of the American Communist or-
ganization as an independent Marxist

political movement and entity. The dis-

solution of the C.P. accentuated the
tendency to weaken our base among the
workers in the decisive sections of in-
dustry. It promoted all opportunist

. views, including the tendencies to limit

and negate the independent role of the
Communists in the elections, as well
as in other progressive and broad united
front political-legislative movements.

 

Insofar as the 1944 elections are con-
cerned, the facts are: the dissolution [of
the C.P. aided the enemies of the camp
of national unity. We Communists, as
well as those who we supported in the
elections, were charged or castigated
with dissolving our independent party
organization in order to “capture” or
“dominate” the A.L.P. and the Demo-
cratic Party. And it must be admitted
that this line of Red-baiting attack was
used by the Hoover—Dewey Republicans
and the Social—Democrats with marked
and harmful effect. Furthermore, while
the C.P.A. did play a key role in the
elections, the dissolution of the C.P.
tended to reduce the power and activity
of our Communist movement precisely
during the course of the elections, and
prevented us from exerting our full
strength.

Clearly, we cannot perpetuate this
state of affairs. Irrespective of what
name or form we may now choose, we
Communists now, from this day on,
must augment and expand our inde-
pendent, Communist vanguard role.
Pending future changes in our name
or formal electoral status, we can and
must build our Communist Association
among the basic industrial workers, ex-
pand our independent mass activities,
including our own independent elec-
toral tickets and campaigns. We will do
this, of course, in conjunction with or-
ganizing the broadest unity of action
together with all other anti-fascist and
democratic forces. But now and in the
future, whether we retain the status of
the C.P.A., as a non—party organization
in the accepted electoral sense, or reor-
ganize into the C.P., we must develop
our organization as the Marxist Party
of the American working class.

«52 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

The final point I wish to mention
regarding Browder’s present position is
‘his non-Marxist views concerning

A theory. When pressed to the wall, Brow-

-der admits that “perhaps” some of his
theories were and are untenable, or at
least, that they don’t square with real-
ities and with our practice. Further,
Browder claims that even if we made

i mistakes on the theoretical front, these

were not so serious because we Ameri-
-can Communists performed virtual
miracles in our mass work, such as
during the 1944 elections. Also, Brow-
vder contends that it doesn’t matter if we
erred as regards theory because, accord-
ing to him, we have been reacting cor-
rectly, especially since V—E Day, to
many of the current political develop-
ments, internationally and within the
«country.

This distortion of and contempt for
Marxian theory is dangerous and has

nothing in common with Marxism.

Insofar as our National Board and
membership are concerned, it is our
-deep conviction and determined pur-
pose to insure that now, as never be-
fore, for us Communists, theory must
serve as a guide to action. Our Marxist-
Leninist theory and practice must be
inseparable. They must conﬁrm and
reinforce each other.

Precisely because under Browder’s
leadership we were, until recently, revis-
ing Marxism, our “new -A theory” took
us into strange pastures; we were tend-
ing to slide into the swamp of Bern-
steinism and Kautskyism. And, natu-
rally, our “new theory” failed to equip
our Association and our friends to
foresee and to meet in time the new
“changes in world and national affairs.
We were not forearmed for the new

tasks with which we are now con-

fronted. VVe were reacting to certain
events, such as at the San Francisco con-
ference, etc., piecemeal, in an isolated

and limited way, and without vision‘

and all-round clarity, without display-
ing the required political initiative.
Because of our erroneous theoretical
conclusions, we did not adequately arm
politically the American working class
and all anti—fascists for the new tasks
now arising.

Some say, however, that despite our
opportunist errors, possibly we could
meet and correctly adjust ourselves to
many aspects of the present changing
situation, and that our practice would
inevitably have led us to correct our
theoretical mistakes. But, the fact
remains, because of an incorrect theore-
tical position, we were lagging behind
events, we were acting spontaneously
and without that essential Communist
compass: Marxist foresight and insight.

But to continue: What, we should
ask, was the basis of the opportunist
errors, not only of Comrade Browder
but also of the entire national leader.-
ship?

The root of our revision of Marxism
arose, essentially, from an erroneous
estimate of and attitude towards mo-
nopoly capital, especially towards those
sections of Big. Business which sup-
ported the military defeat of Germany.

Did our mistakes consist in cooperat-
ing with the win-the-war sections of Big
Capital to speed the military defeat of
Nazi Germany and the Axis? Did they
arise from collaborating in a broad na-
tional electoral coalition with those cap-
italists who wished to re-elect Roose-
velt? Did our errors ﬂow from our ef-
forts to utilize and sharpen the divisions
and contradictions within the ranks of
capital, so as to try and isolate and de-

 

 

SOME ASPECTS OF OUR POLICIES AND TASKS B 53

feat the pro-fascist cliques headed by
duPont, Hearst and McCormick? Ob-
viously the answer is—no!

Then, from what did our funda-
mental mistakes arise? Our errors arose,
for one thing, because we tended to
forget why the main sections of Ameri-

' can ﬁnance capital entered. the war. We

forgot that the monopolists did not
participate in the war against Hitler
completely to destroy fascism, to era-
dicate its social and economic’ roots.
Rather, they came into the war against
the Nazis in order to prevent German
world domination, and also to eliminate
or weaken an imperialist rival. Of
course, their pro-war position coincided
with the‘ immediate interests of the
American people, even though there
was no reason to assume that these big
capitalists would ﬁght consistently
against Hitler or to the end against
Hitlerism. ‘

Our opportunist errors arose because
we lost sight of the fact why the Roose-
velt and Churchill governments, and
the bourgeoisie supporting them, en-
tered into the agreements of Teheran
and Crimea. We forgot that the U.S.A.
and Britain became partners of these ac-
cords primarily because of the military
necessity, because of the given re-
lationship of world forces and be-
cause of the strong and powerful anti-
fascist sentiments, objectives and deter-
mination of the American and British
peoples. '

Similarly, we did not take into ac-
count the fact that the concords of
Teheran and Yalta were, as Comrade
Duclos has pointed out, diplomatic
agreements. Clearly, these diplomatic
agreements were political events and
acts of the ﬁrst importance; they were
of historic signiﬁcance. Yet. what we

 

overlooked was the fact that while the
U.S.S.R. would honor and fulﬁll its
pledge to the letter, as well as in the
spirit, the ruling circles of Americaand
Britain would carry out these agree-
ments only to the extent that labor and
the people———the true democratic and
anti-fascist forces-——spoke out and waged
a resolute and an eﬁective struggle; as
well as to the extent that the relation-
ship of international forces compelled
this.

Our revisionist mistakes consisted
further in the fact that, even during
the wartime period, while correctly co-
operating for victory with the win-the-
war sections of capital, we often tended
to rely upon these sections of capital; we
did not adequately criticize or counter-
act their vacillations; we did not syste-
matically and sharply enough oppose
their concessions to pro-fascist reaction;

we did not maintain at all times our

own independent‘ position. We were in-
ﬂuenced negatively, by illusions regard-
ing the “intelligence” and “far-sight-
edness” of the so-called pro-Roosevelt
sections of capital. And, in retrospect
we must admit that our recent op-

» portunist mistakes have a long history

and were inﬂuenced no little by the
“Roosevelt decade,” by the liberal-
bourgeois inﬂuence which the Roose-
velt “era” exerted upon the American
labor and progressive movements.
Finally, and most important, because

of illusions concerning the wartime and a

future role of the anti-Axis sections of
monopoly capital, we tended to forget
that American ﬁnance capital, Ameri-
can imperialism, itself breeds anden—
genders fascism and wars; and that
after the war, American capitalism
would seek and foster imperialist ag- A
grandizement—-—that it would strive,

   
  
  

 
   

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
  

 

54 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

either by force or by using the “dry”

T method, to attain world hegemony.

Because of this we Communists inad-
vertently tended to obscure and weaken
the independent and leading role of the
working class and consequently the
vanguard role of our Communist or-
ganization. Because of this we did not
suﬂiciently forewarn and prepare labor
and the people to mobilize all their
strength and force for the new and
complex postwar problems. And this
we must do now, at great speed and
despite all difficulties, so as——for one
thing—-—to prevent, in time, the growth

 of fascism within our own country.

=lI==l(==)l‘

,The question inevitably arises as to
why this basic opportunist errors, as
well as other rightist mistakes, was al-
lowed to penetrate into our wartime
work and inﬂuenced our main political
line and approach for the postwar
period.

Did this take place because the lead-
ing cadres of our Communist move-
ment are organically inclined towards
revisionism, or are incurable opportun-
ists? Did this take place because our
‘ieadership is bankrupt and has made
little or no contributions to the struggle
against fascism and reaction, or because
we are devoid of Bolshevik honesty,
integrity and devotion?

To ask these questions is to answer
them. And the answer is, No! The
membership and the vast majority of
our leadership are adherents of Marx-
ism, are staunch proletarian anti-fas-
cists, who champion the immediate, as
well as the ultimate interests of the
working , class—socialism. We have
made vital contributions‘ to victory in

the war, to advancing the cause of de-
mocracy, peace, freedom and social pro-
gress. We have proved ourselves cap-
able, albeit in varying degrees, of ,de-
fending and promoting the interests of
the working class, of our people and
nation.

Then why and how can we account
for the disorienting and paralyzing
opportunist inﬂuences and errors which
adversely influenced our policies and
mass work in the recent period? These
can be «explained by the following
reasons and factors:

1. During and in the midst of mobil-
izing everything to defeat Hitler-Gen
many and the Axis, we tended to be-
come careless and dizzy with success.
We correctly devoted ourselves 'to
achieving victory at all costs and in so
doing we made signal contributions to-
wards this end. Yet, in the process of
doing this, we became one-sided.iWhile

correctly subordinating everything to

the great objective of smashing Hitler-
ism, and working effectively to achieve
this goal, we carried on a relentless
struggle to root out all sectarianism in
our work; but we completely neglected
to combine this with an equally vigilant
struggle against opportunism. We
forgot the sound advice of Comrade
George Dimitrov, who, in 1935, warned
Communists of all lands that to apply
successfully the policy of the united and
people’s anti—fascist front, we must

“ . ..eradicate from our ranks all
self-satisﬁed 5cctarz'm2z'5m, which above
all blocks our road to the masses and
impedes the carrying out of a truly
Bolshevik mass policy. We want to
intensify in every way the struggle
against all concrete manifestations of
Right opportunism, realizing that the
danger from this side will increase

 

SOME ASPECTS OF OUR POLICIES AND TASKS . 55

precisely in the practice of carrying out
our mass policy and struggle.”

2. In the course of our win-the-war
and general anti-fascist activity, while
participating in the broad camp of na-
tional unity, we‘ adopted, in practice,
a non-vigilant attitude towards our non-
labor allies. We unconsciously allowed
ourselves to be influenced by the anti-
Axis sections of the bourgeoisie. This
was particularly true in respect to
President Roosevelt and those sections
of capital aligned with him. Thus, we
frequently dragged at the tail-end of
Roosevelt, were slow in criticizing his
mistakes, weakenesses and hesitations.
Consequently, we did not develop a
sufficiently independent position. We
did not adequately maintain our own
Communist identityfand vanguard role.
Moreover, because of this, we tended
to gloss over many of the pressing
grievances of the workers and the Ne-
gro people,.and sometimes even put a
damper on their struggles.

3. Then, too, our opportunism was
abetted by the fact that our national
leadership has not yet fully mastered
Marxism, that in the ‘midst of ener-
getically supporting and waging this
national liberation war, we often con-
fused the woods for the .trees, and
tended to evaluate or raise short-term
tactics and transitory phenomena to the
levelof strategy or a “new theory.” And
in this connection we should ponder
over the penetrating remarks of Lenin
in his article “Marxism and Revision-
ism”:

To determine its conduct from case
to case, to adapt itself to the events of

Q
the day and to the windings of po-
litical trivialities, to forget the basic
interests of’ the proletariat and the

main features of the entire capitalist \

system as well as the whole capitalist
evolution, to sacriﬁce these basic in-
terests for the sake of real ‘or would-
be advantages of the moment—such
is the policy of revisionism; And it
obviously follows from the very es-
sence of such a policy that it may as-
sume an inﬁnite variety of forms and
will give rise to one or other variety
of revisionism, each time when there
is some “new” question, or when
there is more or less unexpected and
unforeseen turn of events, even
though this turn changed to the basic
line of development to but an insig-
niﬁcant degree and for but the short-
est period of time. (V. I. Lenin:
Marx, Engels, Marxism, International
Publishers, p. 77.)

4. Lastly, though not to exhaust the

subject, our errors arose because in our .

leading committees and methods of
work we have not yet established ‘gen-
uine democracy and collective work.
We have tended to fall into the trap of

formal democracy and self-adulation,

We have confused the forging of firm,
unbreakable Communist unity with the
creation of a synthetic unity which cur-
tailed criticism and self-criticism, which
separated the leadership from the mem-
bership, and failed to draw most of our
trade union cadres and the entire mem-
bership into the fullest formulatingand
executing policies. This has played no

small role~in feeding and prolonging '

opportunism and bureaucratic methods

IHIE SIRUGGLIE AGAINST REVISIONISM  

By WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

Report to the Special Convention of the Communist Political
Association, held in New York City, Iuly 26-28, 1945, which
reconstituted the Communist Party of the U .S./1.

During the past several weeks we
have been engaged in the frankest,
deepest, and most self—critical theoreti-
cal analysis and practical political dis-
cussion in the history of our Party.

Now, therefore, in its overwhelming l

majority, our Party has become con-
vinced that our policy for the past
eighteen months was “a notorious re-
vision of Marxism.” The complete dis-
solution of the Party in the South shows
where Comrade Browder was leading
with his policy. . . .

I.

OUR .PARTY’S REVISIONIST
MISTAKE: ITS ORIGIN
AND COURSE

I Browder, with his revisionism, was
trying to fasten a system of Right-
wing bourgeois liberalism upon our
Party; a liberalism so conservative that
on many questions it put us far to the

Right of Roosevelt, of the liberal press,

and of the m.ain sections of the labor
movement. This revisionism has noth-
ing in common with Marxism—Lenin-
ism, being a complete abandonment of
its basic principles.

A. Brou/a’er's line is a rejection of
the Marxian economic doctrines. Brow-
der has developed bourgeois theories of
the liquidation of the capitalist cyclical

i , and general crises; he rejects Marx’

theory of surplus value and of the ex-
Thus, for

the past two years our Party has made

56

no criticism whatever of capitalism as
a system of human exploitation, nor has
it challenged the blood-wrung proﬁts
of the employers. Instead, we have
heard many comrades, without rebuke
from Browder, talking about our al-
leged obligation to guarantee the em-
ployers, already the richest in the world,
:1 so—called fair proﬁt. That such shame-
ful nonsense should be heard in a
Communist organization! When Brow-
der adopted so‘ glibly the slogan of
“free enterprise,” he accepted in prac-
tice most of bourgeois economics’ along
with it. With his great faith in capital-
ism he outdoes even such enthusiastic
bourgeois economists as Chase, Hanson
and Iohnston. V

B. Brou/a’er’s line is a rejection of the
Marxian principles of the class strug-
gle. Comrade Browder denies the
class struggle by sowing illusions among
the workers of a long postwar period
of harmonious class relations with gen-
erous-minded employers; by asserting
that class relations no longer have any
meaning except as they are expressed
either for or against Teheran; by substi-
tuting for Marxian class principles, such
idealistic abstractions as the “moral
sense,” “enlightenment,” “progressiv-
ism,” and “true class interests” of the
big monopolists, as determining factors
in establishing their class relations with
the workers. Browder’s theories of
class collaboration and the harmony of
interest between capital and labor are
cut from the same opportunistic ‘cloth

/

 

 

 

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM 57

as those of Bernstein, Legien and Gom-
pers, except that his ideas are more
shamelessly bourgeois than anything
ever produced by these notorious revi-

sionists of the past.

C. Browder’: line is a rejection of the
Marxian concept of the progressive and
revolutionary initiative of the working
class, and with it, the vanguard role
of the Communist Party. The very
foundation of Marxism-Leninism is that

A the working class, with the Communist

Party at its head, leads the democratic
masses of the people in the ameliora-
tion of their conditions under capital-
ism and also in the eventual establish-
ment of Socialism. But Comrade
Browder has thrown this whole concep-
tion overboard. His books Victory-
and After and especially Teheran: Our
Path in War and Peace, present the
thesis of a progressive capitalist class,
particularly American ﬁnance capital,
leading the peoples of this country and
the world to the achievement of the
great objectives of the Moscow, Tehe-
ran, Yalta and San Francisco Confer-
ences, and the building of a peaceful,
democratic and prosperous society.
Browder sees labor and the democratic
forces, including the Communist Party,

~ playing only a secondary, non-decisive

role in the present-day world.

D. Brou/der's line is a rejection of the
Leninist theory of imperialism as the
ﬁnal stage of capitalism. Comrade
Browder, in his books and speches,

paints a utopian picture of a world

capitalist system, not moribund, but
vigorous and progressive, especially in
its American section——a world capitalist
system about to enter into a period of

~ unprecedented expansion. It is a denial

of the general crisis of the capitalist

rsystem. Browder believes that under
7 the leadership of his “enlightened”

American monopolists, the imperialist
ruling classes in this and other capitalist

countries will peacefully and spon-

taneously compose their differences with
each other, with the U.S.S.R., with the
liberated countries of Europe, and with
the colonial and semi-colonial countries,
without mass struggle. This ‘is the
bourgeois liberal notion that the epoch
of imperialism is past. It conﬂicts funda-
mentally with the Leninist theory of
imperialism as the last stage of a dec-
adent capitalist system.

E. Brou/a'er’s line is a rejection of the
Marxian-Leninist perspective of Social-
ism. Obviously, if world capitalism,
under the leadership of Comrade Brow-
der’s beneﬁcient American monopolists,
can overcome its inner contradictions
and’ produce an era of well-being and
capitalist progress such as Browder sees
ahead, the whole question of Socialism
is reduced to a mere abstraction. Brow-
der accepts this logic and has aban-
doned the advocacy of Socialism, even
in a purely educational sense. In his
book on Teheran he casts aside our

Party’s ultimate goal of Socialism and A

expands our program of immediate
demands into a fantastic caiptalist utop-
ia which leaves no room whatever for
Socialism.

From all of this, it should be clear
that Browder is preaching anti-Marx-
ism, in fact “a notorious revision of
Marxism,” as Duclos said. He is ﬁght-
ing our Party and with‘ it, what he
has designated as “the Marxists of Eu-
rope.” But like all other revisionists,
he presents his opportunism under the
false ﬂag of a Marxism brought up to
date. That he realizes he is making a
head-on attack upon the whole body
of Marxist-Leninist principles, however,
is clear from his often-expressed scorn
for the “old books” and “old formulas,”

  
 
  
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

  

by which, of course, he means Marxist-
Leninist books and formulas. Browder
would have us throw away the Marxist-
Leninist classics and adopt instead his
Right-wing bourgeois liberalism, which
he misnames Marxism. His two latest
books cannot be called Marxist works,
they are more akin to the ideas of Eric
Iohnston than to those of Karl Marx.
.Browder’s amazing bourgeois revi-
sionism is a surrender to the pressure
of American imperialism upon our
Party. The class beneﬁciaries of his
whole program are the big caiptalists
of this country. His line dovetails with
their plans of imperialist expansion
and world domination when he sows
illusions about their alleged progres-
sivism, hides their imperialist aggres-
sions, spins capitalist utopias that shut
out all perspectives of Socialism, de-
ludes the workers with prospects of
their employers voluntarily doubling
their wages in the postwar stage, and
weakens the Communist Party by trans-
forming it into the Communist Politi-
cal Association, etc. Thus he plays
into the hands of the most reactionary
elements, American big capitalists, who

‘ in the postwar period will be the strong-

est world force making for economic
chaos, fascist reaction, and a new world
war.

One of the most dengerous aspects
of Browder’s revisionism is that it was
penetrating into the Communist parties
of other lands through the spread of
his writings. Thus, a number of our
brother parties in this hemisphere, espe-
cially in Latin America, became infected
with it, thereby weakening their guard
against advancing American imperial-
ism. Various European and Asiatic
parties also felt the liquidatory effects
of Browderism. Indeed, Browder wrote
a public letter to the Communist Party

58 ‘ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

of Australia, virtually telling it what
it should and should not do—advice
which that Party indignantly rejected.
Before the Duclos article was published,
Browder also contemplated sending
a public letter to the British Commu-
nist Party urging it to orientate itself
in the then approaching Parliamentary
elections on the perspective of an elec-
tion alliance between the British demo-
cratic forces and the Churchill group
of Tories against the reactionaries (sic).
How preposterous this sounds now in
view of the Labor Party’s victory—over
Churchill. Browder’s plan, apparently,
was to develop some sort of a loosely
integrated cooperation between such
Communist parties as he could inﬂu-
ence, with the C.P.A. as a new world
center, with himself as its leader, and
with his revisionist policies as its pro-
gram. The Duclos article smashed this
whole plan.

Browder’s revisionism, although it
burst into full expression following the
Teheran conference, has roots reaching
back several years earlier in his Party
leadership. An examination of this
earlier period will reveal the major
reasons why the Communist movement
has not made greater progress in the
United States during the past several
years. Browder’s policies have been a
detriment to our Party for years.

Our Party discussion has made it
clear that Comrade Browder’s revision-
ism has exerted a weakening effect
upon our wartime policy. Many of our
comrades still believe that Browder’s
policy was necessary during the war.
It was not. It was definitely a detri-
ment in our war work, as I have shown
in detail in my article in The Worker
of June IO. And not a few believe that
Browder worked out our policy of all-
out support of the war, of strengthening

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM ' 59

the United Nations coalition, of the
ﬁght for the Second Front, of maxi-
mum war production, of the no-strike
pledge, etc. But this is not true. Brow-
der was in Atlanta when this correct
general war policy was developed, and
he had nothing whatever to do with
its formulation. Almost as soon as he
was released from prison, however, he
began to undermine our correct pol-
icy with his enervating revisionism.
He did not succeed, however, in com-
pletely destroying our otherwise correct
wartime policy. Despite his revision-
ism, our Party may well be proud of
its record during the war, its whole-
hearted and devoted struggle on every
front to win the war. The full de-
structive force of Browder’s revisionism
would have been felt, however, if we
had attempted to extend his policies
over into the postwar period. This
would have proved disastrous to our
mass work and to our,Party itself. The
corrective Duclos article arrived at a
most opportune time for us.

As it was, the corrosive effects of
Browder’s revisionism were fast bring-
ing our Party into a major internal
crisis. His pro-capitalist liberalism
alienated our Party sympathizers and
confused our Party members. So badly
had he undermined our policy that it
ﬁnally took an expert to explain to a
member of a progressive trade union

. why he should join the C.P.A. or re-

main a member of it. Our members’
morale fell rapidly. Fluctuation ﬁgures
rose steeply and our power to recruit
members declined accordingly. The per-
centage of trade unionists dropped off
sharply in our Party. Our contacts
with the Negro people were weakened,
especially by the disastrous liquidation
of our Party in the South. Attendance

_ at branch meetings declined alarmingly,

and dues payment percentages fell to
record low levels. This is what hap-
pens to a Communist Party when it
gets poisoned with revisionism. It will
take hard work upon our part to over-
come this developing crisis and to start
our Party off again on a course of
healthy growth and development.

A peculiarly harmful effect of our
Party’s disease of Browder’s revision-
ism was that by crippling the Party’s
militancy, it tended to throw the work-
ers into the grip of the pseudo-left dem-
agogy of the Trotskyites, Reutherites,
Thomasites, Dubinskyites and Lewis-
IICS. '

The Party membership is mystiﬁed
as to how our Party leadership, almost
unanimously, came to make the serious
mistake of adopting Browder’s crudely
revisionist line, especially during the
past 18 months. Let me try to explain
this:

First, for several years prior to the
adoption of Browder’s distorted policy
on Teheran, our Party had, under
Browder’s leadership, slipped into the
opportunist practice of supporting
Roosevelt without serious self-criticism.
It thereby began to adopt a wrong at-
titude toward the bourgeoisie. Our
developing oportunistic attitude toward

the capitalists was further strengthened.

by the failure to recognize clearly that
the big capitalists of this country were

supporting the war for their own im- .

perialistic purposes and not to advance
the democratic objectives of the Ameri-
can people. Browder’s opportunistic line
was to welcome the big capitalists more
or less as loyal comrades in arms with
the democratic forces. With all this
opportunistic confusion as a background
in Party policy, it was not diﬂicult for
Browder, after the Teheran conference,
to take his ﬁnal plunge into revisionism

  
 

60 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

by contending that our so-called war-
time cooperation with the big capitalists
would be continued and intensiﬁed in
the postwar period.. This argumenta-
tion seemed reasonable to many; for if
the Socialist sector of the world could
arrive at an agreement on Teheran to
cooperate in war and peace with the
capitalist parts of the world, then why
could not American workers and capi-
talists also work together in harmony
in the war and in the postwar period?

With this opportunistic reasoning as a —

basis, Browder then added his utopian
theories of a progressive capitalist sys-
tern, the liquidation of imperialism, the
harmony of interests between capital
and labor, etc. Unfortunately, the rest
of our Party leadership was not able
to demolish this complex utopian struc-
ture by exposing its grossly opportunis-
tic core.

Secondly, a vital reason why Com-

e rade Browder was able to foist his op-

portunisrn upon our Party was because
of the super-centralism prevailing in our
organization. Withhis great personal
prestige and his excessive degree of au-
thority, ,Browder’s word had become
practically the law in our Party. Con-
sequently, he was able to suppress any
analytical’ discussion whatever of his
false thesis regarding Teheran. It is
my opinion that if Browder’s proposals
could have been really discussed, they
would have been ﬁnally rejected by
our Party, but such a discussion was out
of the question.

Now I come to another matter that
is deeply troubling our Party andiits
friends; namely, how does it happen
that a Party leadership that had been
almost unanimously following ‘Brow-

,der’s I opportunist line for eighteen
.months could suddenly switch‘ over and

‘take a stand ﬂatly against Browder!

    

In answer to this general question,

I think that the basic cause of the sud- .

den, almost spectacular change of not
only the leadership’-s, but of Party,
opinion was that Browder’s policy had
been proved bankrupt by life itself as
the war in Europe was coming to an
end. Moreover, thousands of Party
members had accepted the policy at its
outset with grave doubts and hesitationsi
and were ready for the change.

There were, indeed, many signs of
an impending change of Party policy.
The end of the war against Germany,
the death of Roosevelt, the imperialist
raid upon the San Francisco conference
of the United Nations, the obvious prep-
arations of the N.A.M. for a postwar
drive against organized labor, the de-
velopment of many strikes, etc., were
awakening concern among our leaders
in the National Board. Comrades Den-
nis, Green, Thompson, Williamson and
other leading members were either be-
ginning to express directly opposing
views to Comrade Browder’s, or were
raising questions that he found it in-
creasingly diﬁicult, on the basis of his
distortions of Teheran, to answer. Even
Browder himself, under the pressure of

events, had been forced. to cast aside ‘

some of the cruder forms of his revision-
ism and recently had felt compelled to
write several “radical” articles which
apparently contradicted his line. Al-
ready, Dennis and Green had made
proposals for a meeting of the National
Committee, to review our postwar per-
spectives and policies. Such a review
could not have been avoided, and when
it had eventually taken place I am sure
it would have produced important
changes in the Party’s line. As we can
see from Comrade Browder’s present
opposition tothe National Committee’s

Resolution, however, such changesi

 

 

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM 6!

could have occurred only in the face of
his stubborn resistance.

Had the Duclos article been pub-
lished a few months earlier, its recep-
tion in our Party would have been
much less unanimous. As
turned out, however, it appeared at
just the right time. The objective sit-
uation was ripe for it, and so, increas-
ingly, were our Party leaders and mem-
bers. Hence, the stage was all set for
the sudden switch in Party opinion that
has perplexed so many people. Our
Party has suddenly reverted to its basic
Communist principles. . . .

II.

THE NEXT TASKS IN THE
STRUGGLE AGAINST
REVISIONISM

A. An ideological campaign against
Rex/isiorzism: From the Party’s over-
whelming endorsement of the National
Committee’s Resolution, it is clear that
this Convention will decisively reject
Comrade 'Browder’s bourgeois liberal-
ism. This is vitally important; but the
worst mistake we could now make
would be to conclude therefrom that
the ﬁght against Browder’s revisionism
has been fully won and that we can
now proceed unconcernedly with our
daily tasks. On the contrary, we must
continue and intensify the ideological
struggle. While at the conclusion of
this convention our formal general
Party discussion will end and we will
close our ranks and proceed in unity
and discipline to the application of the
line we have adopted, we must, how-
ever, conduct the broadest and deepest
campaign of enlightenment we have

ever led in our Party. As never before, '

we must train our Party in the funda-
mentals of Marxism-Leninism. To this

things .

end we must check over the curicula,
teaching personnel and textbooks of all
our schools. We must re-examinelall
our recent literature. We must prepare
new propaganda and agitation material
in harmony with our new line.‘ We
must especially be alert to eliminate, not
only Browder’s wrong theories, but
also all those opportunist ways of think-
ing and working that have developed
during Browder’s long regime as head
of the Party. So prevalent are these op-
portunist moods and methods that
many comrades in State and National
leading posts are deeply afﬁicted with
them, often without even realizing the
fact.

The eradication of these insidious
open and concealed forms of opportu-
nism, the scars of Browderism, will
need our close and earnest attention in
the coming period. At the same time,
we will have to be vigilantly on guard
against a sharp growth of “Left”-sec-
tarianism, which is a perennial danger
in our Party and of which there are al-
ready manifestations. We must avoid
doing what we have done several times
before during sharp turns in Party
policy; namely, to make the mistake
of over—correction. We must avoid
ﬂying from the one extreme of open
revisionism to the other extreme of a
narrow sectarianism. One evil is as
harmful as the other.

B. Re-establish the Communist Party: ,

It is the National Board’s opinion that
this Convention should reconstitute the
Communist Party. It was a grave er-
ror to form the Communist Political
Association in the first place, a long
step toward dissolving the Communist
movement in the United States, as we
now see so dramatically in the South.
And it will be compounding that deadly
mistake if we do not here and now re-

62 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

organize the C.P.A. into the C.P.
Comrade Dennis, in his report to our
National Committee, showed conclu-
sively that the formation of the C.P.A.
did not help our election campaign, as
Comrade Browder avers, but seriously
hampered it. Likewise, Comrade Wil-
liamson, in reporting to the National
Committee, demonstrated beyond ques-
tion that the continuation of the C.P.A.
is having a liquidationist effect upon
every branch of our Party work and or-
ganization. The clear lesson from all
this is that the convention should re-
establish the C.P. without delay, includ-
ing especially the organization in the
South.

There are no electoral complexities
in this country that the C.P. cannot
meet better than the C.P.A. To keep
the present name is politically inde-
fensible. We will have more standing
among the people operating frankly as
the Communist Party. Besides, every
advanced worker knows the meaning
of a “party,” but does anyone, even
Comrade Browder himself, really know
what a political association” is? Only
with a party can we meet the great tasks
confronting us. Failure to re-establish
the Communist Party at this Conven-
tion would be a major political mistake.
It‘ would -disappoint our membership;
it would cripple our future work; it
would stimulate the Browder opposi-
tion; it would he a sign that we are not
clear-sighted and resolute enough to

4 take the decisive steps necesary to eradi-

cate Browder’s revisionism. . . . a

C. Refresh and Strengthen the Party
Leadership: During my various reports
and articles in this situation, I have
taken Comrade Browder sharply to task
for our Party’s' revisionist mistake. I
have done this because Browder was
the chief author of the revisionism; he

theorized it; he rammed it down our
Party’s throat without discussion; he
now refuses to accept correction, and
he has been busily trying to organize
an opposition against the National
Commitee’s Resolution. Some comrades
believe, however, that I have been un-
duly severe in polemizing against
Browder. But this is sentimentalism,
when it is not political uncertainty.
Comrade Browder has done and is‘ still
doing severe injury to our Party. He
subjected it to ridicule when he intro-
duced his absurd capitalist ideas into
it a year and a half ago, and he is ex-
posing it to a severe Red-baiting attack
now that we have to change back from
his false policies. He has seriously
weakened our Party’s daily work and
confused its membership. He has also
profoundly lowered our Party’s prestige
among other Communist Parties.

While it is necessary, therefore, to
concentrate the main ﬁre against Brow-
der as the ideological leader of our revi--
sionist error, this does not remove the
heavy burden of responsibility borne
by the rest of our national leadership,
especially the members of the National
Board. It was a great weakness that our
leadership was not capable of theoreti-
cally unmasking Browder’s opportun-
ism and thus saving the Party from the
ensuing ravages in its work, its prestige,
and its membership.

Political mistakes are serious matters
and cannot be lightly passed over. In
these times of crucial struggle against
fascism they involve the welfare, the
liberties and possibly even the lives of
large masses of people. Leaders who
make such mistakes must, therefore, be
held strictly responsible. Consequently,
the proposal as stated in the National
Committee’s Resolution, to “refresh

and strengthen the personnel of all re-

I

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM 63

sponsible leading committees in the
Association,” is a pertinent one. The
Party must provide the best guarantees
it can in its leadership that such a
disastrous mistake shall not take place
again. This does not signify, however,

as some comrades assert, that “the'

whole national leadership must be
cleaned out.” ‘Such a Leftist course
would be throwing the baby out with
the bath water. '
Communist parties are not infallible,
and even the best Marxists sometimes
make mistakes. The distinction between
Communist parties and other parties
of the people in this respect is that,
armed with the science of Marxism-
Leninism, the former make far fewer
mistakes than any other group, and
when they do commit errors, they

frankly admit and correct them. Iust-a ,

little while ago Stalin stated that many
serious errors had been made in the
U.S.S.R. during the prosecution of the
war. And in his famous speech on
Masteringi Bolshez/ism, delivered on
March 3, 1937, when pointing out'that
the leadership of the Party made the
serious error of failing to recognize
the danger of Trotskyism, he said:

How can it be explained that our
leading comrades, who have a rich
experience of struggle against every
kind of anti-Party and anti-Soviet
trend, proved to be so blind and naive
in this case that they were unable
to recognize the real face oftthe ene-
mies of the people, were unable to
discern the wolves in sheep’s cloth-
ing, were unable to tear the mask
from them?

They forgot Soviet power has con-
quered only one-sixth of the world,
that ﬁve-sixths of the world is in
possession of capitalist powers. They

forgot that the Soviet Union is in
conditions of capitalist encircle-
ment. . . .

This was a very serious error, as all
will agree, and in the most advanced
Communist Party in the world. ~

When errors are made by Commu-
nist leaders, and our error was a seri-
ous one, it calls for a check-over of the
leading forces; but this must not be in-
terpreted as a signal for a reckless deci-
mation of the Party leadership. Such
a decimation would be in order only
if the Party should have fallen, into
the hands of a hard-boiled group of in-
curable revisionists, which is not the
case in our Party. What is called for

in our situation in order to refresh and ,

strengthen the leadership, therefore, is
to select our new National Committee
and National Board on the basis of a
careful review of the various members’
qualiﬁcations, including their social‘
background, their Marxist - Leninist
training, their previous Party record,

their degree of participation in the pres-

ent error, their connections with trade
unions and mass organizations, their
present attitude toward Browder’s re-
visionism, and their general prospects of
doing effective future Party work. Ob-
viously, there must be important
changes in our leading committees, par-
ticularly the National Board. Trade
unionists and war veterans especially
must be brought into the leadership,
both nationally and in the districts. The
present Party situation must result in a
very substantial improvement in our
whole Party leadership.

D. Re-establish Democratic Central-
ism: A basic essential in our ﬁght
against Browder’s revisionism is to re-

introduce Leninist democratic a central-\

ism into the Party. During the tenure

 

64

of Comrade Browder’s leadership the
Party drifted far from these principles
and allowed itselfito become infected
with a corroding bureaucratisrn in
which Browder was the key ﬁgure and

chief moving force.

Centralism we had, a super-central-
ism in fact, but very little democracy.
Comrade Browder during the course
of theiyears had managed, with the ac-
quiescence of the leadership and of the
Party in general, to develop among us a

, totally wrong conception of Communist

leadership. He had grown almost into
a dictator. His authority reached such
a point that his word had become vir-

T tually unchallengeable in our Party.

His‘ policies and writings ﬁnally were
accepted almost uncritically by the lead-
ers and _the general membership. Brow-

der created around himself an atmos-'

phere of infallibility and unchallenge-
able authority. All this was accentu-
ated by the deluge of petty-bourgeois
adulation, praise-mongering and hero-
worship that was constantly poured
upon him by our leadership and our
members. i

Comrade Browder was deeply intoxi-
cated by this unseemly adulation and
by his arbitrary power. He quite lost
his political balance from it. He aban-
doned Communist modesty and Lenin-
ist self-criticism and fell into the most
extravagant boasting. This boasting at-
titude has done Browder great personal
damage and it has brought havoc to
our Party.

Constantly grasping for more power,
Comrade Browder had largely liqui-
dated the political functions of the
Party’s leading bodies. He habitually

by-passed the National Board in policy
making. Characteristically, his notori-
ous report on Teheran was never pre-
sented as a whole to the National Board‘.

     

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

All the Board saw of it beforehand
were a few fragments. It was sprung
suddenly and sensationally, in the true
Browder manner, at a National Com-
mittee meeting attended by several
hundred people. The National Com-
mittee, also, had gradually lost all real
political power. It assembled; it lis-
tened to _ Browder’s proposals; it af-
ﬁrmed them; and it dispersed to the dis-.
tricts to impress the policy upon the
membership. Of genuine political dis-
cusison there was none whatever in the
National Committee. Similarly, our re-
cent National Conventions were hardly
better than the National Committee
meetings—with their formal endorse-
ment of Browder’s reports, no political
discussions and no self-critical exami-
nation of the leadership.

In this stiﬂing bureaucratic atmos-
phere, Leninist collective leadership
could not and did not exist. Political
thinking itself was hamstrung. Com-
rade Browder, basing himself upon
the high prestige which he enjoyed
among the .Party membership, made
policy pretty much as he saw ﬁt, with
the sad results that we now see. How
far Browder was prepared to go to
prevent political discussion was shown
by the way he suppressed my letter of‘
January, 1944, to the National Com-
mittee. The only way I could have
gotten this letter to the membership
was by facing expulsion and a sure split
in the Party. Even then my letter
would not have really come before the
Party, for the issue would have been the
unity of the Party, and anyone who at-/
tempted to discuss my letter would
have been denounced as a Trotskyite
by Browder. E

The Party must insist that this whole
bureaucratic system be swe t away,

in the districts and nationa ly, as a y

 

 

 

 

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM T 65

basic condition for freeing itself from
Browder’s revisionism. There must be
a genuine collective leadership built up.

The Secretariat must report regularly to.

the National Board, which must discuss
its reports freely. The National Com-
mittee must establish its political power
and it must have the fullest freedom to
discuss all reports coming from the Na-
tional Board or members of the Sec-
retariat. Important differences of opin-
ion in the National Board must be re-
ported to the National Committee. The
National Convention must not be a
mere rubber stamp, as it was under
Browder’s leadership, but must be, in
fact as well as in name, the most
authoritative body in our Party.

The Party must insist that the Party
leaders be self-critical, and it must learn
to be on guard against leaders who
cover up their mistakes, instead of
frankly admitting and analyzing them.
Petty-bourgeois adulation of leaders
must also be ended. We should respect
our chosen leaders, but not make gods
of them. We must insist that real
political discussion take place at all
levels of the Party, from the branches
to the highest committees. However,
our Party is not a debating society;
we have to arrive at decisions and then
resolutely carry them out. But we
can neither formulate sound policies
nor carry them out effectively without

' collective thinking, collective discus-

sion, and collective leadership. Only
by applying the sound principles of

eninist democratic-centralism can our
Party keep i.ts mistakes to a minimum
and develop the clear-thinking unity
of action and resolute discipline that
are the great strength‘ of Communist
parties all over the world.

E. Strengthen the Party’: Indepen-
dent Role: Central to Comrade Brow-

der’s revisionism was the constant
playing down of the independent role
of the Communist Party. This blunt-
ing of the political initiative of our
Party expressed itself in various forms
of tail-ending after the bourgeoisie.
This deadly opportunism is to be found
in Browder’s. leadership for at least
the past ten years. It has had the ef-
fect of facilitating the demagogy of
the Trotskyites and Dubinsky Social-
Democrats.

Thus, under Browder’s leadership, V

our Party habitually failed to criticize
adequately the Roosevelt Administra-
tion for its shortcomings and to come
forward boldly with its own proposals.
In the same spirit of tailism, Browder
refused to criticize sharply the reac-
tionary policies of the A. F. of L.
Executive Council, except in the most
flagrant cases. But the worst instance
of all was his attempt to set our Party
to tail-ending shamelessly after Ameri-
can ﬁnance capital directly, by pictur-
ing the National Association of Man-
ufacturers, the U. 8. Chamber of Com-
merce, the American Bankers Associa-
tion and other reactionary employers’
associations as progressive bodies and
as qualified therefore to lead the na-
tion in various branches of its economic
and political policy. This example of
tailism, which is the very core of the
distortion of the Teheran decisions,
was the most disgraceful piece of mis-
leadership in the history of our Party.

Another expression of Comrade
Browder’s settled policy of minimiz-
ing our Party’s leading role was his
systematic hiding of our light under

a bushel. That is, instead of having

our Party speaking out boldly under
its own name on all political ques-
tions, Browder nearly always, in re-

66 ON THE STRUGGLEAGAINST REVISIONISM

cent years, sought to shove the Party
into the background and to surrender
the initiative to other organizations.
This harmful practice has done much
to weaken our prestige among the
masses, to surround our Party with a
false conspiratorial air, and to hamper
the full legalization of our movement.
Still another, and a very deadly form
of such playing down of the role of
the Party, was Browder’s long-contin-
ued practice of virtually limiting our
Party’s activities to mass agitation and
of avoiding all mass organization and
struggle. Browder has a magic rever-
ence for the spoken word. He is a
talker, not a mass ﬁghter. He has had
very little experience in, or understand-
ing of, the need to back up the word
with action. Especially of recent years
has this trend become manifest, as
Browder, poisoned by our sickly adula-
tion, developed more and more of an
inﬂated idea of the importance of his
speeches. He eventually got to the
point where he seemed to believe that
all that was necessary in the case of
a given issue was for him to make a
speech, for the Party to scatter huge
quantities of it throughout the coun-
/try, and all would be well. Browder
grossly underestimates the importance
of mass organization and political
struggle, so that it is several years since
our Party has organized any real mass
movements on its own, or by mobiliz-
ing its forces to support other organiza-
tions that were campaigning for the
people's rights. This long—developing
tendency of liquidating the mass or-
-ganization work of the Party ﬁnally
reached its climax in the dissolution
of the Party and the formation of the

, C.P.A. as almost exclusively a political

educational society.

The Party must break sharply with

Browder’s chronic tailism, his hiding
the Party’s face, and his avoidance of
mass struggle. The Party must recover
its political initiative and Communist
boldness—even though certain public
oﬂicials, leaders of the A. F. of L.
Executive Council and of the ,N.A.M.
may not like it.

It is good, of course, that many
mass organizations now speak out.pro-
gressively on various questions, and
we must do all we can to develop this
trend. But this must not be done
by pushing the Communist Party into
the background, into the shadows,
where the workers cannot see it in ac—

, tion. Our Party, if it is to be recog-

nized by the masses as their political
leader, must speak out quickly and
boldly on every important question.
Of course, in this sharpening up of
the Party’s political role we must not
fall into the sectarian errors of the
past. And, above all, our Party must
regain its skill of backing up its spoken
word with the most complete possible
mobilization of our membership and
of the organizations with which we
cooperate.

At the present time we are facing
a big task in this respect in the wage
movements of the workers, where
there is the most urgent need of our
helping to organize a broad and active
political campaign within the frame-
work of the wartime no-strike pledge.
We will face a still greater task in the
Congressional elections of 1946, when
the reactionaries will make a desperate
attempt to capture control of Con-
gress. We must employ all our skill to
awaken and mobilize the workers and
all democratic forces to heat back the
political offensive of reaction.

’THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

portunism and to build a strong dike
against its future‘ recurrence, the Par-
ty must radically improve the social
composition of its membership and of
its leadership. We must enlist more
and more workers from the basic in-
dustries. We must, above all, recruit
trade unionists and war veterans’ and
bring them into our leadership. The
winning of such members will be fa-
cilitated by the Party’s present change
of line.

The morale of our Party members
and sympathizers is now being great-
ly raised by the Party’s new line. They
are happy to get from underneath the
suffocating cloud of Browder’s oppor-
tunism and bourgeois revisionism. We
should be alert, therefore, to translate
this new enthusiasm into a big Party
building campaign that will bring
many thousands of new members into
our Party, particularly in our concen-
tration districts, and that will vastly ex-
tend the circulation of the Daily Work-
er and the rest of our press. The best
answer we can make to Comrade
Browder and his revisionism will be
to enroll many thousands of new
members into our Party—workers from
the steel mills, coal miners, automo-
bile plants, railroads, and other key
and basic industries.

IV.

SOME QUESTIONS
ANSWERED

The supreme measure of our new
policy 15 its application in practice to

the immediate demands and interests -

of the people. Only if we have suc-
cessful practical mass policies and ac-
tivities can we free ourselves from
Browder’s revisionism, on the one

hand, and avoid the pitfalls of “Left”

 
 

sectarianism, on the other. . . . I want
to direct my concluding remarks to
the correction of some general mis-
conceptions regarding the new political
line of our Party.

. The first of these misconceptions is
voiced in the argument that Comrade
Browder stands for a broad national
unity, whereas the new line of the
Party tends to narrow down our ‘ac-
tivities. The reverse is the case. Ac-
tually, Comrade Browder’s policy,
measured in the light of our Party’s
experience, was deﬁnitely cutting down
our organization and its mass contacts.
Proof of this is the fact that his
liquidatory policy was fast taking the
vitality out of our Party and throw-
ing it into a serious internal crisis.
Thus it was undermining the very
foundations of all our work. Besides,
Browder’s line, with its nonsense about
the so-called progressive capitalists
voluntarily protecting the workers’ in-
terests, was destroying our Party’s
prestige among the workers and alien-
ating them from us, as was shown in
the defeat of Communists in more
than one important trade union elec-
tion in this period.

Many of our Party members found
Browder’s policy so absurd that they
would not even try to apply it in the
industries. But a comrade, Freda
Werb, of Buffalo, in a discussion ar-

ticle showed what happened to com- ,.

rades who did try to apply the policy
in the shops.

Being faced with lay-oils as we
were, the discussion in the plant na-
turally was around what was going
to happen to us after we were laid
oﬂ‘, and what sort of postwar world
we were going to live in. For
months I stood there and told every-

 

 

 

one who would listen that in the
postwar world our purchasing pow-
er would be greatly increased, that
the capitalists would voluntarily pay
us more money because they wanted
to have a prosperous postwar world.
I may say in passing that many either
wouldn’t listen, or having listened,
laughed.

if we had persisted in advancing

* /B-rowder’s no-strike pledge for. the

postwar period, it would have iso-
lated us in the labor movement. In
addition to all this, Browder succeeded
in alienating whole sections of pro-war
liberal forces of the country and turn-
ing them into a vitriolic opposition to
our Party. There is nothing “broad”
in a policy that cuts the heart out of
our Party, ruins our prestige among the
workers, and violently antagonizes the
democratic forces generally.

In contrast to all this, the new Par-
ty line will build the Party and inspire

_ its members with an incornparably bet-

ter morale; it will restore our waning
standing among the workers", it will
lay the basis for real cooperation with
all democratic forces, it will lay the
basis for the broadest possible demo-
cratic coalition. '

The second misconception that I
want to deal with is now being spread
by Browder. It is akin to the fore-
going one, and it runs to the effect that
Comrade Browder speaks for the whole

nation, whereas the Party, with its new

line, speaks only for the working class.
This, too, is afalsiﬁcation of realities.
Browder is speaking for a nation which
he wants to be led by reactionary
ﬁnance capital. In doing this he is
speaking in the interest, not of the na-
tion, but of the big capitalists. Where-

as, our Party is speaking for a nation

I

' 68   i ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

in which only the proletariat can and
must be the decisively progressive
force. It thereby indeed sp°eaks for
the whole nation. Thus, in the ‘pres-
ent ﬁght tomaintain their wage ‘rates,
our Party holds that the workers are
in fact fighting to advance the eco-
nomic prosperityof the nation by pre-
venting the collapse of their purchas-
ing power and with it a breakdown
of the whole industrial machine. We
maintain that in all their wage strug-
gles, therefore, the workers should place
in the very forefront of their propa-
ganda the fact that by keeping up
their wages they are defending most
vital economic interests of the entire
people. The same principle holds true
of the other ﬁelds of struggle of the
working class. By championing the
interests of the proletariat in, this
broad sense, the Party is indeed speak-
ing in the true interest of the whole
nation. The same is true regarding
the ﬁght of the Party in behalf of
the Negro people, the farmers and
the middle classes.

‘ A third erroneous idea, now being
circulated in the Party by Browder,
would have the Party membership
believe that whereas Comrade Brow-
der is the champion of Teheran, the
Party is now opposed to the Teheran
decisions. Nothing could be further
from the truth. In reality, Browder,
by appeasing American ﬁnance capital,
is surrendering to the worst enemies
of Teheran; whereas our Party, by
basing its present policy upon the{com-

’ bined struggle of the democratic forces

of the world, is taking the only course
by which the great objectives laid down
at Teheran can be achieved. Com-
plete victory over fascism can be won
in this war; peace can be maintained

for along period of time, and -joint

st»

 

 

A .x.,xa : ;f--<o«"w—~":»

 

steps can be undertaken by the United
Nations for world economic 'rehabili-
tation. However, the way to these
ends is not, as Browder proposes, to
turn world leadership over to Ameri-
can ﬁnance capital, but through alert
struggle by the democratic elements

‘throughout the world against monop-

oly, especially the. most reactionary sec-
tions of American ﬁnance capital.

The fourth and last false conception
that I wish to speak against is the
idea being circulated by “Left” sec-
tarian voices in our Party to the effect
that the present program of the Party
is only transitory, that we are on our
way to a much more Left interpretation
of the present national and world sit-
uation. According to these comrades,
we are going to, or should, denounce
the war against Japan as imperialist,
condemn the decisions of Teheran as
unachieveable, drop the slogan of na-
tional unity, call for a farmer-labor
government, give up our Wartime no-
strike pledge, abandon the ﬁght for
60,000,000 jobs, bring forward the
question of Socialism as an immediate
issue, and generally "adopt a class-
against-class policy.

But these comrades are indulging
in wishful thinking. Our Party, if I
know it, is not going to take any
such Leftist course- For the Party,
in its overwhelming majority, under-
stands that Leftist policies of this char-
acter would be no less disastrous to
us than Browder’s Right revisionism.
The line of the National Committee’s
Resolution is the correct one: in its
analysis, its formulation of immediate
demands, and its placing of the ques-

- tion of Socialism. We must hew to

the line of that Resolution, taking into
account, of course, necessary amend-
ments. We are not getting rid of

 

 
   

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM 69

Browder’s Right opportunism to fall
into a swamp of “Left” sectarianism.

Now, in conclusion, let me say that
our Party at the present time is pa..ss
ing through one of the most serious
crises in all its history. There are
those who hope that it will lose heavily
in membership and will fall into a
bitter and destructive factionalism. But
such people, whether inside or outside
of the Party, will be completely disap-
pointed. The Party is making this
crucial turn in decisive unity. There
will be no factionalism, nor will our
Party tolerate any, either from the
Right or the “Left.” Our Party will.
emerge from this situation healthy and
growing, with its mass contacts broad-
ened and strengthened and with. its
members and leaders refreshed and
fortiﬁed by a deeper understanding of
the great science of Marxism-Leninism.

With the economic conditions of the
workers deteriorating and unemploy-
ment growing, with the N.A.M., the
U. S. Chamber of Commerce and
other employers’ organizations out to
weaken or smash the unions, with the
combined reactionaries planning an
all-out attempt to capture Congress in

I946, and with the Government lack- =

ing in adequate response to the work--
ers’ needs, obviously serious economic
and political struggles loom in this
country.

standards, and unions. The people in

By JOHN WILLIAMSON

Report to the Special Convention of the Comm.unist Political

Association, held in New

York, Iuly 26-28, 1945,

u//iic/2 reconstituted the Communist Party of
the United States of America.

The aim of the Constitution Com-

’ mittee has been to make all the nec-

essary changes to bring the Constitu-
tion into accord with the principles of
a ‘Marxist political party of the work-
ing class.

Because of the limited time to pre-
pare this special convention and the
need for the convention to center its
attention on the correction of our re-
visionist errors as well as the reorgan-
ization of our leadership, it has not

been possible to involve the member-

ship in a real discussion on amending
the Constitution. . . .

The proposed recommendations for
changes in the Constitution are as
follows: First, we propose to add 20
new sections that deal explicitly with
many questions we consider necessary
to insure the proper functioning of
our Party and especially to guarantee
the full participation of the member-
ship in the work of the Party, clearly
deﬁning the rights and duties of the
members. Secondly, we propose the
deletion of three old sections which
in our opinion are not in accord with
the effective functioning of our organi-
zation. Thirdly, we have made addi-
tionsto ﬁve existing sections. And,

70

ﬁnally, we have strengthened. eight
and reformulated three of the existing
sections. Each of these you will note
as we go along. . . .

NAME AND PURPOSES

The ﬁrst two Articles dealing with
the Name and Purposes are obviously
of prime importance. Our Constitu-
tion must reflect in the proposed name
and purposes the distinguishing char-
acter of our organization—namely,
that it is the Marxist political party of
the working class. As you will note,
we deﬁnitely propose changing the
name of the organization to Commu-
nist Party. We recognize that the
change of name from Communist
[arty to Communist Political Associa-
tion in May, 1944, was basically incor-
rect. \Ve say this, not because a
Marxist political party of the work-
ing class must at all times have the
name “Party.” In the circumstances
of May, 1944, however, the change
of name was fundamentally unsound
and incorrect, because it had its ori-
gin and motivation in our revisionist
policies. Here for instance, is what
Earl Browder gave as the reasons for
dissolution: ' C

THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY ' 71

The Communists foresee that the
practical political aims they hold
will for a long time be in agreement

on all essenial points with the aims‘

of a much larger body of non-Com-
munists, and that therefore our po-
litical actions will be merged in
such larger movements. The’ ex-
istence of a separate political party
of Communists, therefore, no longer
serves a practical purpose but can
be, on the contrary, an obstacle to
the larger unity. (Te/wmn: Our
Pat}; in War and Peace, p. 117.)

This meant destroying the whole
concept of the indispensability of the
Communist Party as an independent
political force. This meant the li-
quidation of the political and organi-
zational role of the Communists. Pre-
cisely because the dissolution of the
C.P. symbolized our revisionist er-
rors, we deﬁnitely propose returning
to the name Communist Party. It is
our ﬁrm conviction that:

I. The question of re-establishing
the name and form of Communist
Party is a question of principle con-
nected with the proper role and func-
tioning of the Party. The necessary
political and organizational corrections
that we must accomplish will deﬁn-
itely be aided by resuming the name
Communist Party.

2. It is necessary to resume the name
Communist Party to restore the cor-
rect Marxist concept and role of a
vanguard party of the working class;
and, furthermore,

3. It.is necessary to complete in all
its aspects, including the name, the
job we are doing at this Convention,
thus leaving no room for further spec-
ulation and any “unfinished business.”

As to the purposes of our Commu-
nist Party. These are outlined with
precision in the completely rewritten
Preamble, which will be presented
later since it is still in the hands of
a sub-committee. Let me merely re-

iterate certain prerequisites of a Marx-’

ist Party.

1. The Party must constitute itself
and function as the vanguard of the
working class. Some people think
that we can fulfill. our vanguard role
today by merely reﬂecting and putting
into more precise and correct form
what the democratic masses are think-
ing. Obviously, this is not correct.
This does not mean giving leadership
to the mass movement, for it can only
result in tailing behind the mass move-

ment. VVhile we must constantly feel ,

the pulse of the people, and remain
an integral part of the mass move-
ment, we can never forget that the
Party, as one of the Marxist classics
emphasizes, “cannot be a real party
if it limits itself to registering what
the masses of the working people
think or experience. . . .” In fulﬁll-

ing the vanguard role of the Party, .

we must be able to project ideas often
not yet fully accepted or understood
by the masses, and do so in such a con-
vincing and effective manner that we
can influence labor and the people to
accept them as their own.
constantly strive to develop the po-
litical understanding and consciousness
of the working class. We must at
all times maintain an independent po-
sition aimed at inﬂuencing in the first
place the most decisive force within the
nation, the working class, while vigi-

lantly criticizing and overcoming hesi- -

tations and vacillations within the
camp of our allies. In my sub-report

We must

 

to the National Committee meeting,
Ioutlined a series of independent ac-
tivities of the Communist Party in the
ﬁeld of public relations, electoral ac-
tivities and mass campaigns which ex-
plain in a practical immediate way
how we are to function.

The correct emphasis we place on
the independent role of our Party is
not to be interpreted to mean the
weakening of our ties with the masses
or their organizations. Nor, should it
be distorted to mean the breaking of
alliances and close working relation-
ships with other democratic forces. It
should not be interpreted to mean
replacing leadership of broad masses
with the self-satisﬁed leadership of a
small but advanced group of workers.
Fulﬁlling the independent role of the
Party means to strengthen our ties

‘ with the masses; for it must be clearly

realized that without our contributions
and activity, the masses would be left
to the inﬂuence of all the currents
and counter-currents of non-Marxist
forces and ideologies. Developing the
independent activities of the Commu-
nist Party means activating larger num-
bers of Communists, involving them
more fully in the mass movement and
setting in motion ever greater num-
bers of non-Communists.

In its broader and more funda-
mental aspects, the essence of the
whole concept of a vanguard working
class organization is that we become
more and more the Party of the work-
ing class, «in fact as well as in pro--
gram, helping to free the working
class of all bourgeois inﬂuences and
ideologies, strengthening its unity, or‘
gariization and class consciousness.

In the past, people always had re-

V spect for us as ‘a pioneering organiza-

I “  72 I ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

tion—a trail blazer——an organization
which always raised and" defended the
needs of the working class while ce-
menting ever closer ties with the whole
mass movement. People had respect
for us as an organization of action,
an organization that got things done.
VVhile individual non-Communist
leaderst might like us to limit our ac-
tivity to that of political advisers, the
masses of the people, and ﬁrst of all
the workers, see in the Communist

Party an organization of struggle.-

That concept must be fully re-estab-
lished again in the months to come.

2. The second prerequisite for a ‘

Communist Party is the mastery of
Marxist-Leninist theory. This may
appear a truism, yet it was in the
name of Marxism that we entered the
road of revisionism. During these
last eighteen months particularly we
fell victim to a superﬁcial understand-
ing of Marxism. We repeated that
“Marxism is not a dogma but a guide
to action,” and that “Marxism needs
enriching and developing,” but we for-
got that to master Marxist-Leninist
theory means above all to assimilate its
substance. We neglected the substance

—and clung to the appearance of the ‘

letter. Without the rudder of sub-
stance we swam into the revisionism
that we discussed and officially acted
upon yesterday. In emphasizing that
we adhere to the principles of Marx-
ism we should never forget that this
means:

a. That we must ﬁght untiringly
for the everyday interests of the work-
ers and all other oppressed sections
of the population; that we must give

consistent leadership to the national‘

struggles of the Negro people and the

struggle for the liberation of the vic-
tims of U. S. imperialism;

b. That the working class, upon
which the Communist Party bases it'-
self, is' the bulwark and most consist-
ent champion of democracy, the na-
tion‘ and social progress, and that
therefore, the organization, unity‘ and
independent role of the working class
is in the interest of our nation;

c. That wile carrying forward all
the democratic traditions of our coun-
try and the ﬁghting traditions of the
working class of all nations, we al-
ways keep before the masses the aim
of Socialism as the historic solution of

l the contradiction between the social

character of production and the private

ownership of economy by a small_

group of monopolists.

The effort to understand and master
Marxism is not just a task for the lead-
ership——but a necessary task of the en-
tire membership. We must achieve
the understanding that the higher the
political level and the Marxist-Lenin-
ist knowledge of our members and
cadres, irrespective of whether they be
Party functionaries or active in trade
unions, the more effective will be the
result of their work and leadership.
Let us never forget the emphasis of
Lenin that “the role of the vanguard
can be fulﬁlled only by a Party that is
guided by an advanced theory.”

However, this is not the ﬁrst time
we have said this, and merely to re-
peat it, even under the circumstances
of today, does not in itself give us
the guarantee that our organization
will meet this test. To fulﬁll this ob-
jective will require that we break with
the historic underestimation of the
real .signiﬁcance of Marxist theory
within our ranks so crassly dem-

onstrated in the recent past. It will

mean, furthermore, that practical meas- ,

ures must be adopted of aiding‘ our
membership and leadership in their
day-to-day activities to equip‘ them-
selves with the science of Marxism-
Leninism.

I would like to re-emphasize some
of the tasks outlined in my report to
the National Committee:

a. The need to outline a still more
comprehensive program of ‘various
types of schools than originally sched-
uled for this summer, covering C.P.
functionaries, trade union activists, na-
tional group leaders and Communist
youth. However, it must be under-
stood that the quantitative carrying
through of such a program does not by
itself meet the essential problem we
face. To achieve that absolutely nec-
essary Marxist understanding, it is es-
sential that we create a new atmosphere
and proceed from the individual to the

organized forms of study and school- .

ing.

b. That there be established a fully-
equipped educational department in
the national ofiice and in the larger
districts. I

c. That we overhaul and strengthen
the editorial staffs of all our papers.

d. That we shall organize the most
thorough and sustained political strug-
gle against all manifestations of Trot-
skyism and Social-Democratism in the
labor movement.

3. The third prerequisite is that the
Communist Party must understand
that the dctcrmz'nz'ng factor in all our
organizational and educational work
is to help inﬂuence and lead the
workers and the people in struggle.
Organizational work is not some inner

74 I ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM -

activity, but is directed essentially to-
ward the strengthening of our ability
to inﬂuence and lead the masses in
their activities and struggles. Educa-
tional‘ work is not mere study groups,
established for the sake of study but is
aimed at equipping our members with
the knowledge and experience to know
how, inithe course of all struggles, to
adopt the most effective strategy and
tactics, helping the workers themselves
to arrive at a correct undertsanding
of the questions involved. Agitational
work is the abiilty to speak, to write,
to formulate demands that will rally
masses in struggle. Training of cadres

I is to make available to the working

class the most experienced, tested,
trained and loyal leaders, so as to have
the greatest possible assurance of vic-

tory over the enemies of the workers"

and the_.people.

4. The fourth prerequisite for a
Communist Party is to have ﬁrm
roots in the working class and to guar-
antee that industrial workers comprise
the majority of its members. Success-
ful leadership and ability to inﬂuence
the course of our nation require above
all that we maintain and .greatly ex-
tend our ties with the working class,
especially in the basic industries. I
understand that some people have
posed the question somewhat in this
manner: under Browder’s leadership
we became a political force and inﬂu-
enced the life of our nation, but under
Foster’s leadership we will merely be

a sounding board for the working-class .

sentiments. Obviously this is wrong.
Under Browder’s leadership, as a re-
sult of our liquidationist practices, we
became less an inﬂuence in the nation
than before, precisely because we
weakened our connections with the

most important force within our na-
tion—the working class. In actuality,
we were inﬂuenced by other class
forces in the nation. To inﬂuence suc-
cessfully the political life of the na-
tion, the center or gravity of the Com-
munist organization should be in the
main cities and especially in the cen-
ters of large industry. This means
our strongest roots must be among the
industrial workers—particularly in the
steel, auto, coal, marine, electrical
equipment, shipbuilding, and metal in-
dustries. This is not so today. Being
slow in recognizing changes in the
situation and failing to quickly adjust
our slogans and tactical line to new
problems and conditions, we many
times, even if only temporarily, for-
feited leadership to the Reuthers and

other radical phrase-mongers. How- _

ever, the Party has great reserves
among the workers of basic industry,
and if we work correctly we can win
their conﬁdence and re-establish our
leadership.

For all of these reasons, I urge you
to act favorably upon Articles I and
II of "our Constitution. It is precisely
by this action now that we will be
acting upon the expressed will of our
membership to change the name of
the present organization, the Commu-
nist Political Association to the correct
name, the Communist Party of the
United States of America.

MEMBERS’ RIGHTS
AND DUTIES

"I propose now to comment on the
next two Articles, III and IV. These
deal with Membership and the Rights
and Duties of Members of the Com-
munist Party. We cannot be satisﬁed

with the correction of our program and

. policies alone. An understanding of
our errors also must reflect itself in a'

development of Communist conscious-
ness expressed in greater activity, bet-
ter attendance and larger participa-
tion at club meetings, with the mem-
bership everywhere helping to ham-
mer out policy and fulﬁlling our new
responsibilities.

Acceptance of program and poli-
cies is only the expression of the will
to become a Communist. The ﬁrst
condition for carrying out the program
is participation of all the members in
the daily work of the Party. While
recognizing that there can be no
equality of service and activity, the
Communist Party must strive to have
wit/tin its ranks only really active
members. Every member must ﬁnd
his or her place, however small the
contribution, in the overall picture
of activity. This of course should not
be distorted to mean withdrawing

pmembers active in mass organizations

for community mass work, important
as that may be, or, far less, for some

inner club activity. As far as is practi-
cal there should be a merging of such

activities. Members active in mass or-
ganizations must attend their club
meetings. Leadership of Party clubs
shall be considered of equal importance
with leadership in community mass
organizations.

While all conditions of membership
are equally important, we emphasize
at this convention “activity” and the

i new clause “attendance at club meet-

ings,” because in the past we incor-
rectly encouraged the idea of two
categories of members—active and
supporting members. This was both
an expression of liquidationism, a

distortion of the high and singular role
of Communist leadership; as well as
a distortion of democratic centralism.

Attendance at club meetings for all
members, and not just 30 per cent as
in the past, is indispensable if we are
to have an active membership un-
der organized political direction. This
also requires that we correct the ex-
clusive emphasis placed on the purely
educational activity of the clubs. By
developings independent Communist
activities side by side with our par-
ticipation in the broader mass move-
ments of the communities or cities, we
will demonstrate that the Communist
Party has distinctive qualities which
diﬂerentiate us from all other organ-
izations with whom we cooperate in
fulﬁlling one or another immediate
perspective. We will make clear by
what the club says, by what the club
does, exactly how the Communist
Party differs from other progressive
organizations.

It is necessary to comment brieﬂy
on other conditions of membership.
Take the question of reading our
press. If all our members would read
the Daily War/(er each day, we would
without exaggeration increase the politi-
cal effectiveness of the Party in
the mass movement several-fold. On
the question of dues payments—instead
of a 60 per cent dues payment, as we
have had in the C.P.A., reﬂecting

-both looseness as well as dissatisfaction

with our policies, we must again aim
for a I00 per cent dues payment and
reach at least an over—all average of
over 90 per cent.

I call your attention to two new

sections—— and . The ﬁrst re-states, A
4 5

in accord with the principles of dem-

 

ocratic centralism, the right of .un-
restricted discussion in the pre-con-
vention period. ,Section 5 meets a
need that we thought should be em-
phasized, that of involving the mem-
bership in the formulation of major
policies between conventions}, when
we do not have the same unrestricted
right of reviewing and discussing all
our policies and work as in the 60

days prior to conventions.

This does not mean that our pres-
ent discussion shall, as Comrade Earl
Browder implied last evening, con-
tinue after the authoritative action of
this convention. Our Constitution in
later articles correctly restates a tradi-
tional Communist concept that the
highest authority of. the Party is the
national convention and that its de-
cisions are binding on every member.
Browder’s conception that after the
participation of our membership in
the most thorough-going discussion in

our Party's history and after the de-

liberations of this Convention, that all
this has little signiﬁcance and that the
decision will not be rendered here, is,
firstly, a reﬂection on the capacity of
our membership and of ourselves as
delegates, and, secondly, a crass ex-

sample of Browder’s American excep-

tionalism—an exceptionalism in the
face of the well-established organiza-
tional principles of the Communist

. movement everywhere.

Finally, as regards these two Ar-
ticles. You will see we have a number
of new sections. Some of these are to
clarify more speciﬁcally certain obliga-
tions of; Communist membership, but
most of them are an effort to empha-
size especially the rights of Party mem-
bers. .

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST iREVISIONISM

    

ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS

I will now comment on Articles.
VI, VII, and the new Article VIII.

The structure and functioning of
the Communist Party must be con-
sidered in connection with the a con-
cept of membership which we have
already established. The structure

“must provide the means by which to

assure the most effective mobilization
of the membership, guarantee ade-
quate opportunity for full membership
participation in formulating and ham-

mering out the policies of the organi-

zation, develop the necessary member-
ship responsibility for carrying through
decisions and tasks, create the condi-
tions for mastering the principles and
the program of the organization, and
thus enable the Party to fulﬁll its role
as a vanguard organization.

In recognizing how the revisionist
policies we pursued also expressed
themselves in the character and func-
tioning of the organization, we must
now quickly overcome all Social-Dem-
ocratic practices and methods that
developed during this period and
hindered the Communist organization
from fulﬁlling its Vanguard role. Our
mistake was not in trying to “stream-
line” or Americanize our organiza-
tional form. The decisive thing is the
political content of our organization,
and that is precisely where our re-
visionist line had its foundations. But
organizational forms are indissolubly
bound up with content, and therefore

decisive changes in organization must

be made simultaneously as we correct
our revisionist policies. The proper
combination of political content and
form will enhance our inﬂuence and
prestige as an organization of Ameri-
can Communism. I

THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 77

. The Community Club shall remain
a major and important form of the
organization. However, since the size,

n the practices and the content of the

existing clubs have greatly under-
mined the independent leading role of

L the Party, weakened the ties with the

membership and distorted the Commu-
nist concept of the rights, responsibili-
ties and duties which accompany mem-
bership in our organization, immediate
steps shal be taken to adapt the or-
ganization of the Community Club to
the main objective of re-establishing
the vanguard role of the Party.

The size of the Community Club
shall be greatly reduced to make pos-
sible the establishment of more homo-
geneous and clearly-deﬁned Corn-
munist Club, clubs which can readily
secure a knowledge of their member-
ship and develop greater mobility in

carr in throu h their decisions and
Y 8 8 . _ V

tasks.
The establishment of smaller clubs

‘ shall not be regarded as a return to
i the units of years ago. The opening up

of club headquarters, the development
of more popular forms of bringing
the position of the Communist Club
to. the people of the community, is to-
day more essential than ever before.
But there is no reason why Com-
munity headquarters cannot be main-
tained under these conditions with a
number of clubs utilizing central head-
quarters, known to the community as
the club-rooms of the Party in a given
area or town. Furthermore, the public
political character of the club must be
greatly expanded so as to win the ac-

L ceptance. of the club in the community

mass movements. Only a club which
speaks out regularly to the people in
the community on the burning issues

of the day, develops a many-sided ac-
tivity program which will give leader-
ship to the solution of these issues;
strengthens as an organization its re-
lationship‘ with other leaders and or-
ganizations in the community; reaches
the community 'regularly through
forums, leaflets, literature and the
Daily Worker-——can hope to win the
respect and conﬁdence of the com-
munity and become an accepted par-
ticipant of the anti-fascist democratic
community movement. .
During the past period, the elimi-
nation of the shop form of organiza-
tion has greatly weakened the ties of
the C.P.A. with the workers in the
basic industries, thereby actually
hindering our working-class members
from making their maximum contri-
bution to our own organization and
the labor movement, inﬂuencing nega-
tively our ability to win the labor
movement for correct policies. . The
trend, for the first time in many years,
of a decline_ in the industrial composi-
tion of our membership, is due in no
small measure to the fact that the shop
form of organization was dissolved
and the community club did not
provide the trade unionists with the
necessary guidance for the solution of
the complex problems they faced daily.
While we must not ignore the con-
sideration which led to the dissolution

of the shop form, namely, the strength-.

ening and maintenance of our ties
with the progressive forces within the
labor movement, we must simultane-
ously strengthen our organization
among the decisive sections of the
working class and provide a medium
through which the shop workers can

be involved in the development of’

policies that affect the labor move-

78

ment and our nation. For this reason
your committee is ﬁrmly convinced
that the shop branch shall be recon-
stituted as a basic form of Communist
organization.

In the opinion of your committee,
emphasis shall be placed upon the
shop and not the industrial form of
organization. We say this because the
shop form of organization has the ad-
vantage of enabling the Communists
to inﬂuence and raise the working
class understanding and consciousness
of their fellow-workers with whom
they are in» constant contact. This is
not so in the industrial branch. An
industrial branch does not decisively
facilitate these objectives. Its members
are not able to be in closer and more
effective daily contact with masses of
workers. Of course, the industrial
branch may serve the purpose of bring-
ing the Communists of a given in-
dustry together to exchange opinions,
but that is far from the full role
and purposes of a Communist club.
Furthermore, shop clubs are one of
the keys to concentration in the basic
industries. Shop clubs, as distinct from
industrial clubs, will also prevent
depleting the community club of all
its trade union and shop workers,
which could only lead to further weak-
ening the eﬂectiveness of the commu-
nity club as an organization which
must react to and, defend the needs of
the working class within the commu-
nity. iWe shall consider establishing
shop clubs especially in the large shops
in the basic. industries where such or-
ganization will strengthen the role
and activity of the workers, guarantee
more effective mobilization of our
membership and more consistent
growth of our organization, and in

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST "REVISIONISM

industries where the Communist or-
ganization is especially weak and must
be rapidly strengthened.

With the establishment of smaller-
sized community clubs, many of the
main cities and regions will have a
larger number of clubs than heretofore.
To provide more direct leadership,
state organizations shall take under
consideration the re-establishment of
organizations on a county, Congres-
sional or Assembly district basis.

To provide a direct link with the
membership and help to involve the
active members from the clubs in the

direct formulation of policies, the state

organizations shall give serious con-
sideration to the establishment in the
counties, or other subdivisions, dele-
gated bodies representative of the
clubs—County Councils—-—as the key
leading body within the subdivision.
Such delegated Councils are not to be
viewed as merely functionaries’ meet-
ings, which convene at given intervals
to listen to a report, but shall become
working bodies which have the op-

portunity of discussing and determin-

ing policies with the delegates drawn
into committees, and regularly report-
ing back to their clubs the problems
discussed and decided upon in the
Council.  _

DEMOCRATIC CENTRALI SM

Because we erred so heavily in
neglecting the time-tested Communist
principle of democratic centralism, We

must emphasize that these principles‘

are embodied in Articles VI and VII.
Let me restate brieﬂy our concept of
democratic centralism.

Democratic centralism is the meth-
od of functioning of the Communist
organization which combines the

THE‘ RECONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 79

maximum democracy in the shaping
of policy and the election of all lead-
ership with suﬂicient centralization
of committee authority to guarantee
immediate reaction to problems and
speedy mobilization of the entire
membership and organization around
the fulﬁllment of key tasks. Demo-
cratic centralism thus guarantees that
all leading committees are elected by
the membership and all basic problems
are discussed and shaped by the mem-
bership. The elected leadership has
the responsibility to report systema-
tically to the membership on the
actions and decisions taken by the
higher committee. But once decisions
are made in the higher committees,
these decisions become the line of
activity for the ' membership as a
whole.

Centralization with formal democ-
racy can never be successful‘. The
fusion of democracy and centralism
can only be achieved on the basis of
constant /common activity and strug-
gle of the entire membership of the
Party, operating through clubs where
general policies are discussed and
elaborated to meet the specific condi-
tions and problems of that area.

We recognize the failure of our
leadership to provide true democracy
in the Party. Equally important, how-
ever, was our failure to help the mem-
bership equip itself theoretically in
our Marxist-Leninist science so that
is could most effectively exercise
initiative and take part in formulating
and executing policies.

We must be alert to distortions of
democratic centralism, whether it be
in the form of restating an old I.W.W.
syndicalist theory that leaders should
not hold oﬂice longer than one year,

or the pure-and-simple trade union
theory that everything must be sub-
mitted to a referendum vote before the

Party leadership can institute ,or carry‘

through a policy or campaign." On the

other hand, it is not practicing demo- “

cratic centralism for a State Commit-
tee to send out a series of questions to
all Clubs on a very vital subject, and
expect answers, without indicating the
thinking of that leadership as to what
the’ policy on the given subject should
be.

Much has already been said about
methods of leadership. Sufﬁce it here
to emphasize that in the Constitution
we place before you we propose that
the National Committee shall meet at
least three times a year, instead of per-
mitting a lapse of ten months as was
the case between our 1944 Convention
and the first meeting of the National
Committee elected there. Policies shall
be worked out in consultation with
the key Communists concerned, even
if they are not on the Committee. New
major policies shall be brought to the
membership for discussion.‘ Efforts
shall be systematically made to recheck
the correctness of policies through the
National Committee members having
close contact with the members in key
shops, basic industries and decisive
areas. A committee system of work
involving most of the members of the
National Committee shall be estab-
lished. The most important weapon
in improving both the policies and the
functioning of the membership and
leadership of a Communist Party is

, that of self-criticism. Only an organi-

zation of Communists can make skill-
ful use of this important weapon and
not injure itself. It is well to recall
the experiences of the C.P.S.U. on

80 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

this question as stated in the History
of the C.P.S.U.: \

A party is invincible if it does not
fear criticism and self-criticism, if it
‘does not gloss over the mistakes and
defects in its work, if it teaches and
educates its cadres by drawing the
Iessons from ‘the mistakes in Party
work, and if it knows how to cor-
rect its mistakes in time.

A party perishes if it conceals its
mistakes, if it glosses over sore prob-
lems, if it covers up its shortcomings
by pretending that all is well, if it is
intolerant of criticism and self-

I criticism, if it gives way to self-
complacency and vainglory and if it
rests on its laurels.

Many of us, including myself, who
used to know and use effectively the.
weapon of self-criticism, began to com-
mit precisely the things warned

against in this quotation. I think the I
. entire Party will watch carefully every

leader to see that his future actions
square with his words.

‘ Let me call your attention‘ to a dif-
ferent concept of oﬂicers proposed in
this amended Constitution. The old
Constitution provided for the election
of officers by the State and National
Conventions. We propose that the
State Committees and the National
Committee shall elect not only their
Executive Board but all the officers
they deem necessary. The Constitution
indicates by name only the post of

“Chairman, leaving the balance of of-

ficers to be decided upon by the Na-
tional Committee and each State Com-
mittee, although it is clear that several
secretaries and a treasurer will be
needed in every case.

    

This concept of leadership empha-
sizes that the authority rests in com-
mittees and not in individuals. It
builds upon the premise of the collec-
tive, rather’ than the individual of-
ficers. It makes the officers responsible
to the committee, with the committee
having authority to change oflicers
without waiting for a convention.
This works out for a greater demo-
cratic practice. It is the practice i.n all
other Communist Parties.

Lastly, we have added a new Arti-
cle entitled National Review Com-
mission. Section I of that article thus
explains its purpose:

In order to strengthen, as well as

review, the integrity and resoluteness '

of our cadres, to guard against viola-
tions of Party principles, to maintain
and strengthen discipline, to supervise

the audits of the financial books and 

records of the National Committee of
the Party, the National Convention
shall elect a National Review Com-
mission. S

Suﬂice it to add that during this.‘

past period when there was great
looseness in organizational concepts

and functioning, there was also a

complete dulling of all vigilance.
Numerous problems exist or have
arisen, that have never been followed
through. With proper alertness, seri-

ous consequences could be averted by V J
‘ preventative methods. . . .

THE NEED FOR A CONSISTENT
CONCENTRATION POLICY

Before voting on the final motion
to accept the Constitution as a whole
as amended,'I would like to make
some extended concluding remarks.

The Constitution we have agreed a

‘of industrial workers.

THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 81

‘upon article by article is a correct

Marxist document. But the key to
fulﬁlling our Communist responsi-
bility to the working class and the na-
tion is not only incorrect policy but
in our ability to carry out this correct
policy. This is where we must adhere
to a ﬁxed course-—not through mere
talk, but above all a ﬁxed course of
action.

I I would like to emphasize in this
connection that the war against mili-
tarist Japan which must be vigor-
ously prosecuted in order completely
to smash Japanese imperialism and
assist the liberation movements of the
peoples in Asia, together-with the ac-
ccompanying political struggle against
reaction at home, emphasizes the tasks
before our Party. To make the Ameri-
can working class conscious of its role

as the best defender of the interests of
' the nation and all the working people,
I and to prepare .it to assert its inde-
pendent organized power, is not only .

the central task of our Party today but
«.a possibility which can be fulﬁlled in
life itself. To achieve this objective,
there are certain things that partic-

if ularly stand out and need attention:

1. Despite our larger membership
today, we are not always as eﬂective
as we should be because of the lack of

* I I political understanding among sections
-of our membership and the less effec-

tive functioning of our Clubs.

2. We have had a decline in our
industrial and trade union composition
for the ﬁrst time in 6 years. In only 7
districts have we a slight majority
In only one
district—Michigan——-have we a ma-
jority of our members from basic in-

‘ t dustries.

,3.‘ During this past year, progressive

 

workers, including Communists, have
suffered certain losses of inﬂuence
among important local groups of or-
ganized workers in a number of in-
dustries. While this can be balanced

by certain successes, the overall picture I

is unsatisfactory.

4. Our press circulation among
workers in basic industriestis far from
satisfactory. - p

5. As part of our entire revisionist
line with its liquidationist tendencies,
we have committed the most serious
crime against the workers of the South
———ﬁrst of all the Negro workers and
people-—in the complete liquidation of
the Communist movement, both in
name and concept. This action in the

South can be understood and dealt I

with only as part of our entire policy.
The difference is one of degree. In
the South we dropped the name Com-
munzkt with the political act of dis-
solution of the Party and did not even
retain the organizational forms of the
Communist movement. This was dis-
scussed and decided upon by the
former National Board. It was there-
after discussed at a meeting of South-
ern delegates after the C.P.A. conven-
tion. For this action in the South the
National Board as a whole is res-
ponsible, as it was for the entire wrong
policy. The educational and press as-
sociations of Southern Marxists that
were substituted could never fulﬁll the
role of a Communist movement, but
we now hear that some of them ca-
pitulated almost completely to many

reactionary white chauvinist practices

of the South in day-today functioning.
Clearly, we must correct this grave
mistake at this convention and adopt
special measures by the incoming

‘Board that will immediately guaran-

82. ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM'

tee the ‘reconstitution of the Commu-
mst Party in every Southern state.
In analyzing our tasks in the light

of these circumstances we must always a

keep in mind two factors———the tre-
mendous growth of the trade union
movement——but also the inﬂux of non-
working class elements into industry
during the war that has created many
problems still unsolved for the grow-
ing trade union movement. While la-
bor, in pursuing its own independent
line, will be in a better position to
establish democratic unity of all anti-
fascist and democratic forces, we Com-
munists, while noting this, must
simultaneously help the working class

“to stand on its own feet politically and

free itself from the influence of the
monopolies and their ideologists.

We Communists must adopt a pro-
gram of concentration tasks as part of
that necessary ﬁxed course from which
we must not deviate. This means:

I. To help organize the inﬂuence
of the working class and its organiza-
tions for speeding victory over mili-
tarist Iapan, for maintaining unity of
the Big Three on the basis of the
Teheran and Yalta agreements, for
rooting out all fascist and reactionary
inﬂuence at home, for defeating all

lprovocations of employers aimed at

breaking the unity and organization
of labor, and for stimulating the or-
ganization of the unorganized. There-
fore, we must concentrate all Party

» work in such a manner as to have our

strongest roots and decisive member-
ship and inﬂuence among the workers

in the basic industries and large shops.

2. iWe must activate the maximum
number of Communists in these con-
centration areas, among the masses
and in workers’ organizations. To

5

achieve this, we shall shift forces, in-
cluding key national forces, into the
leadership of concentration districts
and areas.

3. We must understand the speciﬁc
problems, confronting the Negro peo-
ple with the beginning of postwar
reconversion, and the resulting ter-
ment and moods of struggle amongst
the Negro people. To meet this prob-
lem, the Party must, as part of the
concentration policy, direct sustained
attention to this problem and give
greater attention to training working-
class Negro Communist cadres.

4. That this Convention shall de-
cide, in consultation with our South-
ern friends, immediately to rebuild
the Communist Party in the South,
especially in the industrial areas.

5. We must work out special plans
for concentration among Italian and
Polish-Americans in the basic indus-
tries. ‘

Clearly, every district must adopt

a policy of concentration work- This -

applies no less to New York than to
Michigan.

What does concentration signify for
us under present-day conditions? It
means:

I. To strive to inﬂuence all mass
organizations to root themselves
among. the basic workers.

2. To direct our work in such a
manner as to guarantee that all in-
dustrial districts, particularly New
York, California and Eastern Penn-
sylvania, shall have a membership
whose majority is industrial workers.
That Michigan, Illinois and Ohio shall

aim at 75 per cent industrial workers.

3. To give a hundred times greater‘

attention by the Party Committees, as
far as speakers, literature, organizers

The Communist Party of the United
States of America is the political party
of the American working class, basing
itself upon the principles of scientiﬁc
socialism, Marxism-Leninism. It cham-

pions the immediate and fundamental‘

» interests of the workers, farmers and all

who labor by hand and brain against
capitalist exploitation and oppression.
As the advanced party of the working
class, it stands in the forefront of this

’ struggle.

The Communist Party upholds the
achievements of American democracy
and ‘defends the United States Consti-
tution and its Bill of Rights against
its reactionary enemies who would
destroy democracy and popular liber-
ties. It uncompromisingly ﬁghts against
imperialism and colonial oppression,
against racial, national and religious
discrimination, against Jim Crowism,
anti-Semitism and all forms of chau-
vinism.

The Communist Party struggles for

the complete destruction of fascism
and for a durable peace. It seeks to
safeguard the welfare of the people
and the nation, recognizing that the

~ working class, through its trade unions

and by its independent political action,
is the most consistent ﬁghter for de-
lmocracy, national freedom and social
progress. ‘

. The Communist Party holds as a
basic principle that there is an identity
of interest which serves as a common
bond uniting the workers of all lands.
It recognizes further that the true na-

1

84

 

  , PREAMBLET0 IHIE cowsirwnuw or
  THE COMMIJNIST PARTY or nu: u.s.A. T e

tional interests of our country and the
cause of peace and progress require
the solidarity of all freedom-loving

peoples and the continued and ever a

closer cooperation of the United Na-
tions.

The Communist Party recognizes

that the final abolition of exploitation
and oppression, of economic crises and
unemployment, of reaction and war,
will be achieved only by the socialist
reorganization of society—-—by the com-
mon ownership and operation of the
national economy under a government
of the people led by the working class.

The Communist Party, therefore,
educates the working class, in the
course of its day-to-day struggles, for
its historic mission, the establishment
of Socialism. Socialism, the highest
form of democracy, will guarantee the
full realization of the right to “life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness,”
and will turn the achievements of la-
bor, science and culture to the use and
enjoyment of all men and women.

In the struggle for democracy, peace
and social progress, the Communist
Party carries forward the democratic
traditions of Jefferson, Paine, Lincoln

and Frederick Douglass, and the great

working class traditions of Sylvis,
Debs and Ruthenberg. It ﬁghts side by
side with all who join in this cause.

For the advancement of these prin-
ciples, the Communist Party of the

United States of America establishes the .

basic laws of its organization in the
following Constitution:

THIS PRESENT snuinow
AND nus NEXT TASKS

Resolution of the National C om/ention of the Communist Party, U .S.A .,
adopted Iuly 28, 1945

PART 1
1.

The military defeat of Nazi Ger-
many is a great historic victory for
world democracy, for all mankind.
This espochal triumph was brought
about by the concerted action of the
Anglo-Sovict—American coalition--—by
the decisive blows of the Red Army,
by the American—British offensives,
and by the heroic struggle of the re—
sistance movements. This victory
opens the way for the complete des-
truction of fascism in Europe and
weakens the forces of reaction and fas-
cism everywhere. It has already
brought forth anew anti-fascist unity
of the peoples in Europe marked by
the formation in a number of countries
of democratic governments represen—
tative of the will of the people and by
the labor—progressive election victory
in Great Britain.

The crushing of Hitler Germany
has also created the conditions for the
complete defeat and destruction of
fascist Iapanese imperialism. The win-
ning of complete victory in this just

T war of national liberation is the first
prerequisite for obtaining peace and-

security in the Far East, for the dem—
ocratlc uniﬁcation of China as a free

and independent nation, and for the .

attainment of national independence

85

by the peoples of Indonesia, Indor-
(jhina, Burma, Korea, Formosa, the
Philippines and India. The smashing
of fascist—militarist Japan is likewise
essential to help guarantee the efforts
of the United Nations to build a dur~
able peace.

All these crucial objectives are of
vital importance to the national in-
terests of the American people, to the
struggle for the complete destruction
of fascism everywhere. Now with the
defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis,
the possibility of realizing an enduring
peace and of making new democratic
advances and social progress has been
opened up for the peoples by the
weakening of reaction and fascism on
a world scale and the . consequent
strengthening of the world-wide dem:
ocratic forces.

2.

However, a sharp and sustained
struggle must still be conducted to
realize these possibilities. This is so
because the economic and social roots
of fascism in Europe have not yet been
fully destroyed. This is so because the
extremely powerful reactionary forces
in the United‘ States and England.
which are centered in the trusts and
cartels, are striving to reconstruct:
liberated Europe on a reactionary basis.‘
Moreover, this is so because the most

 

aggressive circles of American im-
perialism are endeavoring to secure
for themselves political and economic
J domination in the world.

The dominant sections of American
ﬁnance "capital supported the war
against Nazi Germany, not because
of hatred‘ for fascism or a desire to
‘liberate suffering Europe from the
heel of Nazi despotism, but because it
recognized in Hitler
dangerous imperialist rival determined

‘ to rule the world. From the very incep-

tion of the struggle against fascism,
American ﬁnance capital feared the

' democratic consequences of defeating

Hitler Germany.

This explains why the monopolists
opposed the concept of collective se-
curity in the days when -the war still
could have been prevented and instead
chose the‘ Munich policy which inev-
itably led to war. Later, even after the
anti-Hitler coalition was forged, the

U forces of big capital who supported

the war continued to hesitate and
delay, to make vital concessions to
the worst enemies of American and
world democracy—to the sworn foes
of the Soviet Union and to the bosom
pals of Hitlerism. That is why Amer-
ican capitalism gave aid to Franco
Spain; whyit preferred to support the
Petains and Darlans and the reaction-
. ary governments-in-exile as against the
heroic resistance movements of the
people. And that is also why it hoped
that the Soviet Union would be bled

V on the battleﬁelds of Europe and why

it tried to hold off the opening of the

’ Second Front until the last possible

be bankrupt, meeting growing opposi-
tion from the ranks of the people,

Germany a.

Only when these policies proved to

86 if ‘ ' _ \ON  STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

from the millions of patriotic Ameri-
cans ﬁghting in our heroic armed
forces and working in war production;
only when it became obvious that the
Soviet Union was emerging from the
war stronger and more influential than
ever precisely because of its valiant
and triumphant all-out war against
Nazism, did American capital reluc-
tantly and belatedly move toward the

establishment of a concerted military

strategy and closer unity among the
Big Three.

Now that the war against Hitler
Germany has been won, the American
economic royalists, like their British
Tory counterparts, are alarmed at the
strengthened positions of world labor,
at the democratic advances in Europe
and at the upsurge of the national
liberation movements in the colonial
and dependent countries. Therefore,
they seek to halt the march of democ-
racy, to curb the strength of labor and
the people. They want to save the
remnants of fascism in Germany and
the rest of Europe. They are trying to
organize a new cordon
against the Soviet Union, which bore
the main brunt of the war against the
Nazis, and which is the staunchest
champion of national freedom, de-
mocracy and world peace.

This growing reactionary opposition
to a, truly democratic and anti-fascist
Europe, in which the people will have
the right to choose -freely their own
forms of government and social sys-
tem, has been reflected in many of the
recent actions of the State Department.
This explains why, at San Francisco,

Stettiniusi and Connally joined hands"

with Vandenberg——-the spokesman for
Hoover and the most predatory sec-
tions of American ﬁnance capital. This

sczizitaire ,

THE PRESENT SITUATION AND THE NEXT TASKS 87

explains the seating of fascist Argen-
tina as well as the aid given to the pro-

gfascist forces of Latin-American; the
British-American reluctance to live up
to the Yalta accord on Poland; the
American delegation’s refusal to join
with the Soviet Union in pledging the
right of national independence for
mandated territories and colonies and
to give oﬁicial recognition to the repre-
sentatives of the World Labor Con-
gress.

These facts reflect the current shift
of hitherto win-the-war sections of
tAmerican capital to closer political col-
laboration with the most reactionary
and aggressively imperialist groupings
of monopoly capital.

‘It is this reactionary position of
American big business which explains
why powerful circles in Washington
and also London are pursuing the
dangerous policy of trying to prevent
a strong, united and democratic China;
why they bolster up the reactionary,
incompetent Chiang Kai-shek regime
and why they harbor the idea of a
compromise peace with the Mikado
in the hope of maintaining Japan as a
reactionary bulwark in the Far East.
It accounts, too,-for the renewed cam-

, paign of anti-Soviet slander and incite-
. ment calculated to undermine Ameri-

can—Soviet friendship and cooperation.
A On the home front the big trusts
and monopolies are blocking the dev-
elopment of a satisfactory program to
’ meet the human needs of reconversion,
of the problems of economic disloca-
tions and severe unemployment, which
is beginning to take place and will
become more acute after the defeat of
Japan. Reactionary forces—especially
the NAM and their representatives in
government and Congress—-—are be-

ginning a new open-shop drive -to
smash the trade unions. They also
endeavor to rob the Negro people of
their wartime gains. They are trying
to prevent the adoption of govern-
mental measures which must ‘be
enacted at once if our country is to
avoid the most acute consequences of
the trying reconversion period and the
cyclical economic crisis which is bound
to arise after the war. Likewise, they
are vigorously preparing to win a reac-
tionary victory in the crucial I946 elec-
tions. —
Already the reactionaries are using
the increased cutbacks to lower wages
and living standards and to provoke
strikes in war industry. They are ob
structing the enactment of necessary
emergency measures for federal
and state unemployment insurance.
They are sponsoring vicious anti-labor’

‘legislation, such as the new Ball-Bur-

ton-Hatch labor relations bill, and are
blocking the passage of the FEPC and
anti-polltax bills. They areitrying to
scuttle effective price and rent control
and to exempt the wealthy and the big
corporations from essential tax legis-
lation. They are endeavoring to place
the entire cost of the war and the dif-
ﬁculties of reconversion upon the
shoulders of the working people.

If the reactionary policies and forces
of monopoly capital are not checked
and defeated, America and the world
will be confronted with new aggres-
sions and Wars and the growth of reac-
tion and fascism in the United States.

88. 9 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

V more progressive role ‘in’ world affairs

in accord with the true national in-
terests of the American people. For
one thing, the military defeat of Nazi
Germany has changed the relationship
of world forces in favor of democracy.

« It has enhanced the role and inﬂuence

of the Land of Socialism. It is bringing
into being a new, democratic Europe.

It has strengthened those forces in our
‘country, and elsewhere which seek to

maintain and consolidate the friend-
ship and cooperation of the United
States and the Soviet Union———a unity
which must now be extended and
reinforced if a durable peace is to be
secured,

This is evidenced by the fact that
the overwhelming majority of the
American people, and in the ﬁrst place
the labor movement, which has grown
in strength and maturity, is opposed
to reaction and fascism, and supports
the foreign and domestic policies of
the late President Roosevelt as em-
bodied in the decisions of Crimea and
in the main features of the Second Bill
of Rights.

This is demonstrated by the great
mass support for the San Francisco
Charter and by the determination of
the American people to guarantee that
the United Nations security organiza-
tion shall fulﬁll its historic objectives

—-—that the amity and unity of action

of the American—Soviet-British coali-
tion shall be consolidated in support
of the agreements of Teheran, Crimea
and Potsdam, shall be. strengthened in
the postwar period and made more
solid and effective, in order to prevent
or check the recurrence of new ag-
gressions and wars.

This majority of the American peo-
ple must now speak out and assert its

    

  

collective strength and will. The
united power of labor and of all dem-
ocratic forces, welded in a firm anti-
fascist national unity, must express
itself in a decisive fashion so as to
inﬂuence the course of the nation in a
progressive direction. _

It is imperative that the American
people insist that the Truman Ad-
ministration carry forward the policies
of the Roosevelt-labor—dernocratic coa-
lition for American-Soviet friendship;
for the vital social aims of the eco-
nomic bill of rights; for civil liberties;
for the rights of the Negro people;
and for collective bargaining. .It is
equally necessary that labor and the
people sharply criticize all hesitations
to apply these policies and vigorously

oppose any concessions to the reac-

tionaries by the Truman Administra-
tion, which is tending to make certain
concessions under the increasing pres-
sure of the reactionary imperialist com-
bination led by the monopolies.

The Truman Administration, like i

the Roosevelt government from which
it is developing, continues to receive
the support of the Roosevelt labor-
democratic coalition, and responds to
various class pressures. While it seeks
to maintain contact and cooperative
relations with labor and the more
democratic forces of the coalition, its
general orientation in both domestic
and foreign policies tends, on some
vital questions, to move away from
the more consistent democratic forces
in the coalition and tries to conciliate
certain reactionaries. Hence, it is of
central importance to build systemati-

cally the political strength and rinﬂu--

ence of labor, the Negro people, and
all true democratic forces within the
general coalition for the -struggle

 

:*‘1A«%v.‘>’.'~'»'2-6. -4 #£

 

\

 

THE PRESENT SITUATION AND THE NEXT TASKS 89

against imperialist reaction, for com-
batting and checking all tendencies
and groupings in the coalition willing
to make concessions to reaction. The
camp of reaction must not be ap-
peased. It must be isolated and routed.

Toward this end it is necessary, as
never before, to strengthen decisively
the democratic unity of the nation, to
create that kind of national unity for
the postwar period which will be able
to facilitate the destruction of fascism
abroad and to prevent fascism from
coming to power in the United States.
T/zerefore, it is essential to weld to-
gether and consolidate t/ze broadest
coalition of all anti-fascist and demo-
cratic forces as well as all other sup-
porters of Roosevelt’: anti-Axis policies.

To forge this democratic coalition
most effectively and to enable it to
exercise decisive influence upon the
affairs of the nation, it is essential that
the working class—-especially the pro-
gressive labor movement and the,Com-
munists——strengthen its independent
role and activities and display far
greater political and organizing initia-
tive. It ‘is imperative that maximum
unity of action be developed among
the C.I.O., the A. F. of L. and the
Railroad Brotherhoods and that their
full participation in the New World
Federation of Trade Unions be
achieved. It is necessary to rally and
imbue the membership and lower of-

? ﬁcials of the A. F. of L. with conﬁdence

in their ability to ﬁght against and de-
feat the reactionary policies and leader-
ship typified by the Greens, Wolls,
Hutchesons and Dubinskys.

While cooperating with the patriotic
and democratic forces from all walks
of life, labor must, in the ﬁrst place,

’ strengthen its ties with the veterans,

the working farmers, the Negro peo-
ple, youth, women, intellectuals and
small business men, and with their
democratic organizations. At the same
time, while forging the progressive
unity of the nation, labor should co-
operate with those capitalist groupings
and elements who, for one or another
reason, objectively at times, promote
democratic aims. But in so doing, la-
bor must depend first of all upon its
own strength and unity and upon its
alliance with the true democratic and
anti-fascist forces of the nation.

The current war and postwar needs
of the Working class and the nation,
including the adoption of an effective
reconversion program and the main-
tenance of workers’ living standards,
also demand the initiation of large
scale mass campaigns to organize the
millions of still unorganized workers.
This is imperative if organized labor
is to achieve its full strength and ful-
fill its role as the leading democratic
force of the nation.

In the vital struggle to crush feudal-
fascist-militaristic Iapan it is necessary
that American labor reaﬂirm its no-
strike pledge and give the necessary
leadership to mobilize the people for
carrying the war through to final vic-
tory and for national liberation aims.
In so doing labor must collaborate in
the prosecution of the anti-Japanese
war with all democratic forces who
favor and support complete victory
over Iapanese imperialism.

However, labor and the other anti-
fascist forces must take cognizance of
the fact that amongst those big busi-
ness circles who desire military vic-
tory over Iapan, there are inﬂuential
forces, including some in the State
Department, who are seeking a com-

promise peace which will preserve the
power of the Mikado after the. war,
at the expense of China and the other
Eastern peoples, and directed
against the Soviet Union. Similarly,
there are powerful capitalist groupings
including many in Administration
circles‘, who plan to use the coming
defeat of Iapan for imperialist aims,
for maintaining a reactionary puppet

Kuomintang regime in China, for ob-.

taining American imperialist domina-
iton in the Far East. .

Labor and the people should and
will continue to do all in their power
to hasten complete victory over Jap-
anese militarism and fascism. And to
do this, labor and the popular forces
must ﬁght for and rally the people for
a consistent anti-fascist and an anti-
imperialist policy, and must rely, first
of all, upon the people and their dem-
ocratic organizations and aspirations.

4.

To achieve the widest democratic
coalition and the most effective anti-
fascist unity of the nation, it is vital
that labor vigorously champion a pro-
gram of action that will promote the
complete destruction of fascism, speed
victory over Iapanese imperialism,

curb the powers of the trusts and

monopolies, and thereby advance the
economic welfare of the people and
protect and extend American democ-
racy.

In the opinion of the Communist
Party such a program should be based
on the following slogans of action:

1. Speed tlze defeat of Ia5ci:t-mili-
tarist Iapanl

Prosecute the war against Iapan re-
solutely to unconditional surrender.

if =l=

This program meets the most urgent
immediate interests of the American
people and nation. It is a program of
action around which all progressive
Americans can unite today. It is a pro-
gram of action which will advance the
struggle for the moral and political’

defeat of fascism, leading to its ﬁnal .

destruction and eradication. It will
help create the conditions and guaran-
tees for a stable peace and for a larger
measure of economic security and dem-
ocratic liberties for the masses of the
people. The anti-fascist and democratic
forces of our nation, being the over-
whelming majority of our people, can
become strong enough to check and

 

94 V ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

defeat imperialist reaction and to
realize the great objectives of this pro-
gram of action. - .

As class-conscious American work-
ers, as Marxists, we Communists will
do all in our power to help the Ameri-
can working class and its_ allies to ﬁght
for and realize this program. At the
same time we will systematically ex-
plain to the people that substantial
gains for the masses secured under
capitalism are inevitably precarious,
unstable and only partial and that
Socialism alone can finally and com-
pletely abolish the social evils of capi-
talist society, including economic in-
security, unemployment and the
danger of fascism and war.

However, this program of action
will help the working class and the
people as a whole to meet their urgent
immediate practical needs, enhancing

A generally their strength and inﬂuence

in the nation. In the struggle for the
program for peace and democracy,
jobs and security, favorable conditions
are created for the masses of our peo-
ple to recognize, on the basis of their
own experiences, the need for the
eventual reorganization of society

‘ along socialist lines.

We shall assist this process by every
available educational means, taking
full cognizance of the growing interest

a of the American people and its work-

ing class in the historic experiences of
the Soviet people-in the building of a
new socialist society, which has played
the decisive role in the defeat of Hit-
ler Germany and the Axis. We shall
aim to convince the broad masses that
the eventual elimination of the profit
system and the establishment of So-
cialism in the United States will usher
in a new and higher type of democ-

    

racy and a free. road to unlimited and
stable social progress because it will
end exploitation of man by man and
nation by nation, through the estab-
lishment of a society without oppres-
sion and exploitation. r A -
While not yetaccepting Socialism as
an ultimate goal, the American people
today agree that fascism must be des-
troyed, wherever it exists or wherever
it raise its head. The American people

are ready to protect and extend the '

Bill of Rights and all democratic liber-
ties. They are determined to ﬁght for
greater peace and democracy, for the
right to work, greater job and social
security. ’

Therefore, Communists - and non-
Communists, all progressives and anti-
fascists can be rallied in support of the
above program of immediate action.
For this program meets the immediate
desires of the American people upon
which the majority can unite today to
prevent the rise of fascism and to as-
sure victory in the 1945 municipal
elections and in the fateful 1946 con-
gressional elections which must be or-
ganized and prepared for now. This
is a program which must be cham-
pioned in every factory and industry,
in every community and state, through
the medium of labor’s political action;
through labor’s joint and parallel
action locally, and through broad shop
steward conferences and united com-
munity movements, as well as through
other broad united peoples and demo-
cratic front activities.

tional strife. For these purposes they
will use Hitler's secret weapon of

need a great strengthening of every

loyal, courageous and honest leader-
ship, men and women who combine

. clarity of vision with the qualities of

ﬁrmness in principle and ﬂexibility in
tactics. Above all, they require a larger,

j stronger, more inﬂuential and more ef-
fective mass Communist Party.

‘The Communists have a greater re-

“ sponsibility to labor and the nation

than at any other time in their history.
And these greater responsibilities can
be fulfilled by us with honor because

“of our long record of devotion and

service to the cause of the working
class and the people, and by our adher-

ence to the scientiﬁc principles of
- Marxism-Leninism.

 Fment conﬁdently faces the future. We
. are proud of our consistent and heroic

 

A , struggle against reaction and fascism
“over the years. We draw strength

from and are particularly proud of our
efforts to promote victory over Nazi
barbarism and Japanese imperialism.

On the ﬁeld of battle and on the
home front, we Communists have
been in the forefront of the fight to
defend our country and our people. In
the struggle for the establishment of

the anti-Hitlerite coalition, for the’

opening of the Second Front, for de-

feating fascist-militarist Japan, for na-

tional unity, for the re-election of
Roosevelt, for the rights of the Negro
people, for building a strong and pro-
gressive labor movement, for uninter-
rupted war production and for the
attainment of international trade
union unity——the contributions of the
Communist have been vital and sec-
ond to none.

6.

We recognize that the future of the
labor and progressive movements and
therefore the role of the United States
in world affairs will depend to no
small extent upon the correctness of our
Communist policy, our independent
role and inﬂuence, our mass activities
and organized strength.

That is why today we Communists
must not only learn from our achieve-
ments in the struggle against fascism
and reaction, but also from our weak-
nesses and errors. In the recent period,
especially since January, I944, these
mistakes consisted in drawing a num-
ber of erroneous conclusions from the
historic signiﬁcance of the Teheran ac-
cord. Among these false conclusions
was the concept that after the military
defeat of Germany, the decisive sec-
tions of big capital would participate
in the struggle to complete the des-

 

 

96 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

truction of fascism and would co-
operate with the working people in
the maintenance of postwar national
unity. The reactionary class nature of
ﬁnance capital makes these conclusions
illusory. This has been amply demon-
strated by recent events revealing the
postwar aims of the trusts and cartels
which seek imperialist aggrandize-
ment and huge proﬁts at the expense
of the people .

This revision of Marxist-Leninist
theory regarding the role of monopoly
capital led to other erroneous con-
clusions, such as to utopian economic
perspectives and the possibility of
achieving the national liberation of the
colonial and dependent countries
through arrangements between the
great powers. It also led to tendencies
to obscure the class nature of bourgeois
democracy, to false concepts of social
evolution, to revision of the funda-
mental laws of the class struggle and
to minimizing the independent and
leading role of the working class.

In consequence, we Communists be-
gan to carry on the historic struggle
against fascism, for democracy and na-
tional freedom, in a way that was not
always clearly distinguishable from that
of bourgeois democrats and bourgeois
nationalists, forgetting the class charac-
ter and limitations of bourgeois de-
mocracy and nationalism. Finally, this
right-opportunist deviation also tended
to ignore, revise or virtually discount
the fundamental contradictions of cap-
italism, declaring wrongly that the
changed and changing forms of their
expression indicated that they had
ceased to operate in the period of the
general crisis of capitalism.

Furthermore, the dissolution of the
Communist Party and the formation

 

oi the Communist Political Associa-
tion were part and parcel of our re-
visionist errors, and did in fact con-
stitute the liquidation of the inde-
pendent and vanguard role of the
Communist movement. As a consequ-
ence, our base among the industrial
workers was seriously weakened. This
further resulted in a general weaken-
ing of Communist activities and in ad-
versely affecting the role and policies
of other Marxist parties in the West-
ern Hemisphere. Far from aiding the
carrying out of such correct policy as
support for Roosevelt’s reelection, the
dissolution of the Communist Party
weakened the democratic coalition be-
cause it weakened the initiative,
strength and contributions of the Com-
munist vanguard.

A ﬂagrant expression of this liquida-
tion was the abolition of the Commu-
nist organization in the South through
its transformation into non-Commu-
nist, anti-fascist organizations. This
action undermined the foundation for
consistent and effective struggle for
the needs and aspirations of the
masses of the South, especially the Ne-
gro people. This glaring example of
the logical outcome of our revisionist
errors reveals the direction in which
our policy was leading. The dissolu-
tion of the Communist Party of Amer-
ica and the formation of the C.P.A.
was in fact the liquidation of the inde-
pendent Marxist Party of the working
class.

The correction of our revisioist er-
rors demands the immediate reconsti-
tution of the Communist Party and
guaranteeing the re-establishment of
the Marxist content of its program,
policies and activities.

The source of our past revisionist

 

 

 

THE PRESENT SITUATION AND THENEXT TASKS

errors must be traced to the ever active
pressure of bourgeois ideology and
inﬂuences upon the working class.
The failure on our part to be vigilant
and to conduct a sustained struggle
against these bourgeois and petty-bour-
geois inﬂuences permitted their inﬁl-
tration into our own ranks and sapped
our proletarian vitality. One of the
most harmful and far reaching conse-
quences of this bourgeois inﬂuence

’ upon our organization was the devel-

opment over a period of years of a sys-
tem of bureaucratic practices and
methods of leadership.

This found expression in a failure
to analyze and re-examine constantly
our policies and methods of work in
the spirit of Marxist self—criticism; to
check our policies with the experiences

‘of the masses in the class struggle; to

develop a correct cadre policy; and to
draw our full membership into the
shaping and clariﬁcation of basic
policy The crassest example of this
was the suppression of the Foster let-
ter from the membership. Another
example of this bureaucratic method
of work was the manner in which the
former National Board proceeded to
liquidate the Communist organization
in the South.

The growth of revisionism was
helped by bureaucracy. While the
main responsibility for the bureau-
cratic regime rests upon Browder in
the first place, the former National
Board and National Committee must
assume a heavy responsibility for the
bureaucratic system of work which

prevailed in all Party organizations.

The former National Board, in ac-
cepting the Browder system of leader-

. ship, set a bureaucratic example and
‘did not carry on a struggle to establish

\

97

genuine democracy in the organiza-
tion..This was also reﬂected by the
former Board’s inadequate self-criti-
cism during the pre-convention period.
The incoming National Committee
and Board, by example, and with the
active assistance of the membership,
must undertake an ideological and or-
ganizational struggle to root out all
vestiges of bureaucracy, and be con-
stantly on guard against relapses to old
bureaucratic methods of work and op-
portunistic practices, which could only
obstruct the most rapid and complete
correction of our revisionist errors.

7.

The opportunist errors of our
former general policy limited the ef-
fectiveness of Communist work on

the Negro question. This was especial-.~

ly expressed in our glossing over the
national character of the Negro ques-
tion, and in our unwarranted illusion
that the big bourgeoisie themselves
would carry forward after V-E Day
the wartime gains of the Negro peo-
ple.

It is true that we continued to
proclaim our uncompromising demand
for full Negro democratic rights, and
in many instances fought hard and
effectively against Iim Crow practices,
especially in the interests of the war
effort. However, the struggle for the
national liberation of the Negro peo-
ple as fundamentally related to the
whole struggle of the working class
against capitalist exploitation and op-
pression was often lost sight of.

Moreover, our revisionst policies
narrowed the scope and weakened the
vigor of such struggles, even causing
us at times to soft-pedal the struggle to

 

 

 

98

eliminate Negro discrimination in the
armed forces.

The results of this opportunist
policy are all too apparent. We have
not adequately prepared the labor
movement and the Negro masses to
combat current efforts of reaction -to
create sharp Negro-white conflicts
within the ranks of labor and to "wipe
out .the wartime democratic gains of
the Negro people. Despite limited
gains we have had serious weaknesses
and inconsistencies in our work in the
Negro communities and have been
unable to consolidate our thousands of
new Negro recruits into a stable mem-
bership. We completely liquidated the
"Communist organization in the South.
VVe failed to develop a substantial
corps of Marxist-trained Negro work-

ers for leadership in the labor move-

ment.

It is now incumbent upon us to give
militant leadership to the struggle for
Negro democratic rights on all fronts,
especially intensifying our educational
work among white trade unionists.
We must rebuild the Communist or-
ganization in the South. We must
develop and bring forward a strong
corps of working class Negro Commu-

‘nist cadres in the great industrial

centers of the nation.

Above all, we must deepen the
theoretical understanding of all Com-
munists, both Negro and white, on
the fundamental nature and far-reach-
ingimplications of the Negro question
and conduct a vigorous struggle »to
root out every manifestation of open
or concealed white chauvinism in our
own ranks. As one step torward this
end, we should create a special com-
mission to undertake a basic study of
the conditions and trends of the Ne-

gro people in relation to the broad

social, economic and political move-

ments in America and the world to-
day, and, in the light of Marxist-
Leninist theory, to formulate a com-
prehensive deﬁnition of Communist
policy and program on the Negro
question.

8.

The opportunist errors which we
were committing adversely inﬂuenced
our work during the war, limited the
effectiveness of our anti-fascist activi-
ties, and were disorienting the Com-
munist and the progressive labor
movement for the postwar period. ‘

Our Communist organization was

moving toward a crisis, among other M

things, because of its inability to an-
swer the growing complex problems
arising out of the present world situa-
tion. This developing crisis could not
be resolved without the full recogni-
tion and correction of our former
revisionist policies.

In this connection, therefore, we
must recognize the sterling leadership

and the important contributions which a
- Comrade Foster made in the struggle

against opportunisrn. Likewise, we
can appreciate the basic correctness of
the sound fraternal, Marxist opinions
expressed in the recent article of
Iacques Duclos, one of the foremost
leaders of the Communist, Party of
France.

Life itself, especially our recent ex-
periences in the struggle against the
forces of fascism and reaction on both
the foreign and domestic fronts—in
the trade unions, in the struggle for
Negro rights, in the struggle against
the trusts——has fully conﬁrmed the

~* validity of Comrade Duclos’ criticism

and of Comrade Foster’s repeated
warnings, and has fully exposed the
basic revisionist errors of American
Communist policy since Ianuary, 1944.

In ascertaining the grave responsi-
bility for the opportunist errors and
mistakes committed in the recent pe-
riod, it is necessary to state that while
Comrade Browder, who was the fore-

'most leader of the C.P.A., bears a pro-

portionately greater share of responsi-
bility than any other individual leader
or member, the former national lead-
ership, and in the ﬁrst place, the

”former National Board, must and does

assume a heavy responsibility for these
errors.
9.
Clearly, the single, most essential
pre—condition necessary to enable us

to ‘perform effectively our Communist

duties in the postwar period as the

vanguard and champion of the in-

terests of the working class and the na-

‘tion, is to overcome quickly and de-

cisively our errors and mistakes, espe-

, cially to eradicate all vestiges of op-
~ portunism in our policies and mass

work.
Toward this end the entire Commu-

 nist organization must immediately

make a thorough and self-critical ex-
amination of al policies and leadership.
We must establish genuine inner-de-
mocracy and self-criticism throughout

our organization. We must refresh
and strengthen the personnel of all
responsible leading committees in the
organization, and establish real col-
lective leadership in all Party commit-
tees. In doing this we must combat all
tendencies toward factionalism, to-
ward distortions and toward weaken-
ing the basic unity of our Communist
organization. .

At the same time, we Communists
must avoid all sectarian tendencies
and boldly and energetically expand
our own Marxist working class and
anti—fascist mass activities and our

most active participation in the broad ‘

labor and democratic movements. We
must resolutely strengthen our inde-
pendent Communist role and mass
activities. We must develop a con-
sistent concentration policy and build
our Communist organization especial-
ly amongst the industrial workers. We
must wage a resolute ideological
struggle on the theoretical front,
enhancing the Marxist understanding
of our entire organization and leader-
ship.

We Communists renew our pledge
to do everything to destroy fascism
and reaction, to advance the cause of
American and world democracy, the
cause of national freedom and social
progress. We are determined to co-
operate with all anti-fascists and all
democratic forces to achieve these
great objectives.

Comrades Dennis, Williamson and
others have outlined to us the main
line of policy. The National Commit-
tee has thoroughly agreed with this
line. What I want to stress here in
behalf -of the Secretariat is the role of
the Party in meeting the many tasks
that confront us. .

In the disturbed situation following
the war, we have seen the Party and
the nation face a host of complicated
and urgent problems. Never in the
history of our Party did we have so
many great problems to meet. Many
of these problems are literally of a life
and death character, and through

‘them all runs the common thread of

necessity for struggle against reaction.
First, we face a tremendous educa-
tional problem in the sense that we
have to help the masses of the Ameri-
can people understand that the United
States has embarked on an imperialist
policy aimed at domination of the
world. The American people do not
have this idea at all, and it is a very
diﬂicult one to give them. But it is
very fundamental that this be done.
We have to explain that the real policy
of the Truman government is im-

e perialist, and to show the dangers in

this to our country and the world. We
also have to explain to the masses that
the essence of the foreign and domestic
policy of the leadership of the A. F.
of L. is also imperialist. If we had
nothing else to do, this, one task of

Summary Remarks, National Committee Meeting, C .P.U.S.A., N av. 18,1945.

teaching the people the significance of ‘

American imperialism would be suf-
ficient to tax the strength of our small
Party.

But, of course, there are all sorts of

other huge and urgent problems—the’
ﬁght for full employment, for 60,- ‘

ooo,ooo. jobs. There is no need for me
to stress how vital this ﬁght is, and
what a tremendous struggle it in-
volves. At other times, if we had
nothing else to do, this one issue
would be enough to occupy every par-
ticle of strength we have.

$=IIII=

Then, there may also be mentioned
the problem of the organization of the
unorganized. Some comrades here
have pointed out that now is an ex-
tremely favorable opportunity to or-
ganize the unorganized workers, of
whom there are many millions. This
is correct. Once again I will say, if
our Party had nothing else to do we
could make this problem a central task
of our Party.

There is further the tremendous
wage campaign, which threatens to
develop into a gigantic strike move-
ment, arraying millions of workers in
the basic industries against the great-
est trusts in the United States. It is
one of the most fundamental and far-
reaching movements in the country.
This movement, if handled correctly
can result in a great victory for the

 

 

 

 

FOR A FIGHTING COMMUNIST PARTY! IOI

workers of this country, but on the
other hand the workers can suffer if
mistakes are made. We have lots of
tasks in connection with this great
struggle. In fact, the wage movement
literally clamors for our leadership and
support. There are many dangers that
the workers face and must be organ-
ized against. The most serious of these
is an underestimation of the serious-
ness of the situation, of the sharpness
of the resistance the unions will have
to face. There is also an underestima-
tion of the dangerous attitude of the
Truman government, marked by ten-
dencies to rely on the Truman govern-
ment as on the Roosevelt government
in the past period. There is also not
yet a realization of the extent to which
the A. F. of L. leadership is kniﬁng
the. wage movement. To educate the
workers to all these dangers calls for
great activities on our part. If our
Party was ten times as big as it is at
present, this task would be big enough
to occupy our entire attention.

But I must add still other important
problems to those I have already noted.
There are the vital elections of 1946-
the Congressional elections—in which
not only the fate of our country, but
to a very great extent that of the whole
world is involved. If the reactionaries
succeed in winning a victory in this
election, it will bode ill for the rest of
the world as much as for us. Con-
sequently, preparations for carrying
through the 1946 election campaign
will call for the greatest mobilization

‘ on the part of labor in the history of

the United States and this naturally
throws upon the shoulders of our

-Party very heavy tasks which we can-

not possibly ignore.
as at it

If I haven’t already given you
enough tasks, I can add a few more.
There is also the great problem of the
internationalization of the atomic
bomb. «We know the tremendous
struggle going on in this country, in
fact all over the world, over this ques-
tion of the atomic bomb. Here I might
say in the spirit of self-criticism that I
do not think we have paid enough at-
tention to the atomic bomb question
either in our general report, or our
discussion at this National Committee
meeting.

Finally, to cite a problem of decisive
world importance, there is the ques-
tion of the intervention of the United
States in the Chinese civil war, a crime
which threatens the peace of the whole
world, and one which calls for the ut-
most activity of our Party in every
sphere of action.

There are also a whole series of
other very urgent problems. Among
these problems may be mentioned the
campaigns for world trade union
unity, activities to resist the imperialist
maneuvers of our government in Ger-
many and Japan and in the Balkans,
to abrogate the White Paper in con-
nection with Palestine, to organize
great relief campaigns for the war-
ravaged countries in Europe, to com-
bat the government demands for un-
iversal military training, to defend
the threatened interests of the Negro
people, to ﬁght against the rising cost
of living, to fight the outrageous pro-
fascist activities of the Rankin Com-
mittee, to bring about practical work-
ing relations between the workers and
the veterans, and to tackle the funda-
mental problems of developing better
relations between the workers and the
farmers.

;.-;. ;.--34.... ..:.. _.. ... ,.., .:

 

 
 

Themere listing of this formidable

array‘ of problems indicates at once

the terriﬁc struggles developing in this
period we are now living ‘through. It
also emphasizes the tremendous tasks
placed upon our Party as a vital part
of the people’s democratic forces. None
of these tasks that I have cited can be
neglected without our running the

ldanger:of suffering serious defeats, if

not actual catastrophe.

This situation, with all these urgent
problems, should teach us two funda-
mental lessons, both of which have

been expressed in the reports of Com-

rades Dennis and Williamson.

The ﬁrst of these fundamental les-
sons that we have got to grasp is the
necessity for concentrating our efforts
upon, the most crucial of the many
problems confronting us. We must, as
Lenin taught us, seize the key links
which will enable us to move the
whole chain. On the domestic ﬁeld,
as the resolution we have just adopted
indicates, the key problem that con-

‘ fronts us is the ﬁght for wage in-

creases. To this we must devote our
major attention. . . .

On the international scale, the key .

task, as emphasized in Comrade Den-
nis’ report, is to stop American inter-
vention in China. This war on China
by the American forces is growing
more menacing. In today’s paper we
note that Gen. Wedemeyer is quoted
as saying that the United States is now

I‘ prepared to ﬁre on the Chinese Com-

munists unless they abide by rules laid
down by the American military lead-
ers in China. The war in China is the

key ,.of all problems on the interna-

tional front and it is here, above all
else, where we have to deal the hardest

blow to reaction.

ON’ THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ‘AREVISIONISM

There are millions of workers, mil-i
lions of Americans in various classes,-

who. are ready to go into action on '

these great issues. But weall know

frompast experience that to ’a large‘

extent the struggle of the people will
depend very largely upon the extent
to which our Party is able to give lead-

ership to these huge masses of the peo-‘ 
ple. On the question of China, Wl11Cl'l 
is our key concentration, as Comrade \

Dennis pointed out, we want to hold
500 meetings all over the country to‘

mobilize all the forces of the people 
that we can reach to put a stop to the 

intervention in China. Our Party must

use "every ounce of its strength and 
skill and- organizational ability to

make these 500 meetings a success.

’l=%=I=

These struggles will be a supreme 

test of the ability of our Party to func-

tion effectively in such a complicated ~: A

and diﬂicult situation as we now con-

front. .We must keep clearly in mind if

that if we concentrate on these-two
key problems of the wage movement
and American intervention in China

as the most burning and urgent of all j

the tasks confronting us, this does not
mean that we can neglect the many

other vital problems I have mentioned, 7
that we can disregard them, or wait un-  j‘
til we have ﬁrst made a success of the j ,
two particular’, major concentration 

campaigns before we undertake any-

thing else. To do this would be a ‘fatal A ,

precisely in the mobilization of the

" also, at all costs, prepare for an all-
‘out participation in the 1946 elections.

two ‘key questions of domestic and
foreign policy—the wage movement
- and intervention in China——learn how
to link up all the other struggles we
. are carrying on.

p Comrade Williamson in his report
~ outlined many. of the most important
' tasks inﬂthe building of the Party. I

  want to stress just a few of them. For

J

 _'one thing, and it appears to me this is
the starting point, we must strengthen
our democratic centralism. We must

racy. This was well illustrated by the
discussion over the [veterans questions
which we have just concluded. I think
that everybody who was present here
must have sensed from the course of
this discussion that we have a new’
spirit in the life of the Party.

Il=*%

There is a new democracy, a new '

Communist democracy, developing in
our Party. One of the manifestations
of this, is that we are beginning to
develop a really collective leadership.
The report presented here was not
prepared by someone who went off to
the country and wrote in an ivory
tower, and then rammed it down our

throats. It was fully discussed and ,.

everyone on the National Board con-
tributed to it. Dennis wrote most of
the report and contributed, in my
opinion, many of the principal points.
We are, I repeat, developing a collec-
tive leadership. Our National Board is
now a democratically functioning”
body.

We are also beginning to cultivate
some new cadres, new leading cadres
in the Party. I think that is pretty ob-
vious from what’s been happening
here in this National Committee.meet-
ing. Under the general head of de-
veloping collective leadership, we in
the center are setting up committees’
in all spheres of activity, and the dis-
tricts are beginning to do this as well.
This committee system, instead of the
one-man system we had before, is fun-
damental to the development of ‘real
democracy in our Party.

Comrades, actually, we in the center
who are well acquainted with the
Party, have been astonished to note the

  

104

wreckage that was caused by the re-
visionist policies that the Party had
been afflicted with in the recent past.
Since the convention we have actually
been reconstituting the Party from the
ground up and we have had to carry
on this reconstruction in the face of
many political and organizational
problems piling in on us from every
direction.

Together with more Party democ-
racy we must have an improved
discipline in the Party. The two are
not incompatible. Indeed, there can be

A no real Communist democracy without

ﬁrm Communist discipline.

. Here at this National Committee
meeting we have had an example of
the need to discipline a comrade. I
refer to the Comrade Donchin case. I
hope that the comrades will not in-
terpret the penalty we have applied as
some kind of punishment because
Donchin had the temerity to rise up
and criticize the National Board, or
members of the Secretariat. Such is not
the meaning of this case. Donchin, if
he had merely criticized the National
Board, would have met with no objec-
tion. If the District Committee in
Philadelphia had spontaneously ex-
pressed a criticism of the National
Board that would be a legitimate ex-
pression of democracy in the Party.
But what Donchin did was something
entirely different. His actions were a
violation of both Party democracy and
Party discipline. He accused the Na-
tional Board, particularly some mem-
bers, of deliberately falsifying the re-

‘solution of the Convention for the pur-

pose of shielding themselves from
responsibility for the revisionism and
bureaucracy of the past. When the
Board did not agree with this point of

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

view, Donchin instead of appealing to
the National Committee, as was his
right, went back to the District and
undertook to mobilize the member-
ship of Eastern Pennsylvania against
the Board.

That is factionalism, not democracy.
Donchin thought that the opportune
moment had arrived for him to de-
velop a factional ﬁght. We all know
how unsettled the Party was after its
radical change in line and leadership.
'\-’Ve know that the Party was going
through one of the most critical pe-
riods in its life. It was just at that mo-
ment, when every Communist had the
duty to rally the Party and put it on
an even keel, that Donchin proceeded
to strike. Consequently he had to be
disciplined. Obviously such a com-

rade has no place on our National,

Committee.

We have got to have a more dis-
ciplined Party. We are going into a
diﬂicult period, and this will require
a ﬁrm, united and disciplined Party.

The second thing we have to do in
order to strengthen our Party is to
overcome the passivity in our ranks.
It is a well-known fact that only a
small percentage of our membership
is active in carrying out our cam-
paigns. This passivity is one of the
special heritages that we have from
the Browder period of revisionism.
Of course, there was considerable pas-
sivity before that, but the revisionist
period particularly, cultivated this pas-
sivity. We must make the most serious
efforts to overcome it. We must raise
the morale of our Party and put the
whole Party to work. If we can do
this, if we can really enthuse the Party

 

 

 

FOR A FIGHTING COMMUNIST PARTY! I05

with a ﬁghting and a working spirit
the effectiveness of our Party will be
increased manifold. This is no routine
matter. We have got to mobilize
our Party. We cannot stand for pas-
sivity in our ranks. We have got to
bring this matter home to our com-
rades by an intensive ideological cam-
paign, by a systematic mobilization of

- our membership for the big tasks con-

fronting us. We must get our whole
Party into action. Overcoming pas-
sivity in the Party is one of the most
fundamental things that we have to
do at the present time.

A third basic necessity for us is to
recruit more members, especially basic
workers, into the Party. We must take
this job in hand as never before. We
have said this many times before in
the history of our Party, but we have
got to do it in a new way now. All
over the world the Communist Parties
are growing, and we must grow too.
Of course, the conditions are not as
favorable for us to grow as they are
in Europe, but we all know there are

q plenty of opportunities for our Party

to grow in the United States, and we
must see to it that the Party does grow.
In our campaign to build the Party,
the registration campaign must be
taken up in a new and more urgent
way in the light of the immense prob-
lems that confront us. We must also
pay special attention to the returning
Party veterans. We must not assume
that all these comrades will automati-
cally resume membership in the Party.
Let me also say that we must ﬁnd
ways to broaden the ﬁnancial base of
the Party. This is a major question.
There is too much underestimation of
the ﬁnancial side of our work. Neglect
of Party ﬁnances was one of the

marked aspects of Browder's revision-
ism.

The fourth and last point I want to
stress on the question of Party build-
ing is that we must transform the
Party into a Party of struggle. Every-
thing depends upon this. One of the
worst manifestations of Browder’s revi-
sionism was to kill the ﬁghting spirit
of our Party and to tend to turn it
merely into a propaganda or agita-
tional organization. His general idea
of Communist Party action seemed to
be that he should make a big speech
and that the Party should spread it
over the country in huge quantities.
We must, of course, not lessen our
agitational activities, but we must at
all costs throw our Party into strug-
gle.

It was on this question of weaken-
ing the Party as a ﬁghting organiza-
tion that I ﬁrst came into conflict with
Browder, as much as ten years ago.
Browder was not a ﬁghting leader and
he did not cultivate a ﬁghting party.
Perhaps the ﬁrst roots of Browder's
revisionism were precisely his weaken-
ing of the Party’s ﬁghting spirit. We
must get over that and learn that we
have got to have a ﬁghting and work-
ing Party. Our Party now is beginning
to become a ﬁghting Party again. But
there is still much passivity and hesi-
tancy. At our Eastern Conference on
the question of the wage movement
and the ﬁght for full employment,
when we checked over what the Party
had done in the preceding weeks, I
was surprised at the tentativeness and
the amateurish way that many sections

of the Party approached the task of A

developing this struggle. This showed
how much out of practice the Party
was in actually conducting active mass

  

:06

struggles jointly‘ with our allies, -- and
how badly Browder’s revision had un-
dermined the Communist militancy of
our Party. . A - -

Now take the question of the inter-
vention in China. I don’t know what
you comrades think about it, but I
cannot for the life of me understand
how the leaders of a district can see
such a situation as this developing
without immediately taking action
and proceeding to call meetings, to get
in touch with our allies, and try to-
get resolutions of protest adopted, etc.
I think there was a fairly good lead
on this matter given from the Center.
We spoke out early, gave correct
slogans, and here in New York a very
substantial mass meeting of protest
was held. Yet numerous districts
seemed to pay no attention to the
whole business and displayed no initia-
tive. Such moods of inactivity must
be radically overcome. We have got
to re-awaken the Party and transform
it quickly into a party of mass strug—
gle. i

ON: THE‘ STRUGGLE-A AGAINST REVISIONISM

~- I cannot stress too much the burn-_

‘ ing necessity of making our‘ Party a C’

party of struggle. By -improving the
activity" of our Party we can enor-
mously increaseiits strength and recruit
large numbers of new members into
it. This increased strength is impera-
tive for our Party in view of the great
problems we and the other forces
in the domocratic coalition now face.

In conclusion, let me say that we
have had a good National Committee
meeting. It shows that the Party is
uniﬁed, that it is basically absorbing
the new line adopted by our Conven-
tion, and that it is once more actively
getting into the mass struggle. Now
let us go back to our respective dis-
tricts, and on the basis of the correct

policies adopted here, mobilize our‘ , if

Party around the issues we have
clariﬁed, strengthen systematically our
contacts with our mass allies, and real-
ly build our Party into the powerful
mass Communist Party that it should
and must be.

 

THE PARIY AND THE VETERANS

slogans for this March. And this is
true. The movement took on greater
scope than we were able to foresee,
but we were the ones who gave the
initiative to this big movement. This
goes to illustrate the importance of
being able to sound the correct slogans,
-to have a correct policy.

I think the delegates here have ex-
pressed the essential demands of the
veterans at this time. I am not going
:to talk at any length upon that. There
seems to be one question, however,
that is troubling our veterans. This is
the question of where the veterans are
going to go to ﬁnd an organization. In
this, respect, I think the resolution
adopted by our National Committee at
its recent meeting is sound. That re-
solution puts main emphasis upon the
existing mass veterans organizations,
the American Legion and the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars. For it is a fact
‘that hundreds of thousands of worker-
veterans are streaming into these or-
ganizations and it would be a crime
to automatically surrender these great
masses of veterans to the reactionary
leadership of the Legion and of the
Veterans of Foreign Wars. But we also
cannot ignore the fact that there are
thousands, perhaps hundreds of thou-
sands and maybe millions, in fact, of
“veterans who don’t like the American
Legion, who are suspicious of the
American Legion because of its reac-
ztionary record and who also are not
attracted to the Veterans of Foreign
‘Wars. Amongst these masses undoub-
tedly, in fact we see it already, organ-
izations are beginning to take shape.
“Especially there will be such organiza-
tions amongst Negro veterans. Our
Party must be very alert and keep in
‘¢IO1lCh with these tendencies as well as

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

to give full support to all independent
mass organizations of veterans of a
progressive character.

But it would not be the part of
wisdom for us to come forward with
a slogan for a general independent or-
ganization of veterans. Such a slogan
could serve no purpose at this particu-
lar time. It would isolate the progres-
sive forces from the big mass veterans
organizations that are already in ex-
istence. But if the veterans of World
War Number Two decide in consider-
able masses that they must have a new
organization, the Communists will
play their full part in all such develop-
ments.

There are some people who think
that progressives cannot function in
the American Legion and other con-
servative and reactionary. veterans or-

ganizations. This is a mistake. There ‘i
must be no stand-oﬂ‘ attitude toward _

these organizations as there was after
the last war. The American Legion,
from the very outset, had such a reac-
tionary reputation that left-wingers
and progressives generally wanted to
have nothing to do with the organiza-
tion. I remember how in 1920, when I
was invited to speak to a big American
Legion post in Chicago, I was proba-
bly one of the first left-wingers ever
to speak to the American Legion.
There must have been a thousand-

members there when I spoke and I I
was given a fine reception. I was in- I

 
   

vited because of the trade union mem- ‘

bers of that post. Yet many left-wing- '
ers said, “Well, Foster’s beginning to
go haywire. Now he’s gone and
spoken to an American Legion post.”
(Laughter) ’

Let me give you a few examples of

how worker members of the Legion 

 

SLJ-okl I

 

THE PARTY AND THE VETERANS

responded during the stormy period of
the big 1919 steel strike. Throughout
the steel areas the American Legion,
dominated by reactionaries, appeared
openly as a strike-breaking organiza-
tion. I remember going into the City
of Wheeling, West Virginia, where
some 20,000 or more steel workers
were on strike. The strike had been
on for 14 weeks and the tension was so
great that almost civil war conditions
existed there, as in many other steel
centers. The strike was absolutely
solid, not a wheel turning in any of
the mills. The Chamber of Commerce
and the bosses of the city were des-
perate to get that strike broken. And
I was billed to make a speech in
Wheeling. The American Legion met
and publicly announced that if Foster
spoke the American Legion was going
to throw him in the Ohio River. And
I may add that the Ohio River
ﬂowed very conveniently by the city.
(Laughter)

The workers there who had gone
into the American Legion in large
numbers took up the battle against the

reactionaries, who were all former,

Army officers. (Laughter) That seems
to be a familiar situation. (Laughter)
It turned out, however, these oﬂicers
couldn’t mobilize enough members
of the American Legion to throw me
in the Ohio River. (Laughter) When
I got off the train, I was met by a dele-
gation of about 100 workers, mostly
members of the American Legion. I
remember, I said to the man who led
them, “Who are these people? Are
they ours or somebody’s else’s”-P
(Laughter) He said, “It’s all right,

 they’re ours.” (Laughter) So we went
through with that meeting. The reac-

tionary leaders were not able to destroy

109:

it. It so happened, however, that I was
billed to speak the same night in
Steubenville, which is some 30 miles
from Wheeling. So the Legion oﬂicials
said, “Something happened. We didn’t
quite get our forces organized in
Wheeling. But we’ll fix Foster’s feet

in Steubenville,” Before the meeting,“

the American Legion leaders sent word
to us that “If you open that meeting‘
we’re coming in and carry Foster out
off the platform.” Well, in Steuben-
ville, as in Wheeling, the steel workers
and miners at the meeting had also
largely become members of the Le—
gion, and they sent a written note to
the leaders of the American Legion,
saying, “Come right along. But if you

do, it will not be Foster who is carried p

out.” (Laughter) Our meeting went
through without interruption.

Of course the progressive forces,
members of the veterans organizations,
have more favorable circumstances to
work under now than in the stormy
days of 1919, when the Legion was
openly reactionary and when the
whole country was deep in a tremen-
dous open-shop drive by the employers
against the labor movement.

I want to conclude my brief remarks
by saying somethingvon the experience
with revisionism that the Party has
had during the past several months.
The reason I am mentioning that at
the present time, or the special reason,
is because many of the veterans were
not present during this very critical
period in the life of our Party and I
would like to give you just brieﬂy a
little idea of what happened and why.

How did our Party come to make
the mistake that it did—the mistake
of developing an international perspec-
tive of frictionless and automatic col-

no 9 ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

laboration between the big capitalist
powers themselves and with the Soviet
Union on an international scale; and
in this country, a corresponding per-
spective of a close class collaboration, a
continuation of national unity over into
the postwar period, with the em-
ployers voluntarily raising the ‘work-
ers’ wages drastically. Obviously, from
the present situation, we say that that
perspective, both on an international

scale and on a domestic scale, was V

wrong. We see the international
tensions that are developing, actually
threatening war. We also see the
sharpening of the class struggle here
at home. How then did the Party
make this great mistake in estimating
the international and domestic situa-
tion, particularly with regard to the
postwar period? It is a long and com-
plicated story but perhaps I can give
you a general idea in a relatively few
words.

During the war, as you know, there
was a close international collaboration
between the Soviet Union, Great Brit-
ain, the United States and China.
From this collaboration, Browder
concluded, especially after the Tehe-
ran Agreement, that this collaboration
would be extended over into the post-
war period, so that all serious friction
between the great powers would
be easily liquidated. Browder thus
ignored completely the nature of the
collaboration that the monopolists in
our country were giving to the Soviet
Union and to other countries involved.
He ignored the fact that the American
monopolists in this war-time interna-
tional collaboration were ﬁghting first
of all for their own imperialist in-
terests. They were striving primarily
to eliminate two of their most serious

competitors in the world, Germany

and Japan. They did not have in mind

the same objectives that the great mas- '

ses of the American people had:
namely, to destroy fascism, to bring
about peace in the world, to establish
international democracy. Browder
ignored the fact that once the war was
over, these imperialist powers would
reopen their struggle and carry on
these conflicts in a sharpened form,
one that might very easily become
highly dangerous. Especially, Browder
ignored the fact that American im-
perialism, the strongest imperialism of
all, following this war, would under-
take a campaign to dominate the
world.

On the domestic scene, during the
war, there was, as you know, a certain
measure of national unity among all
classes, such as it was. Browder, in
formulating the policy of the Party,

 

ignored the fact_that the capitalists in . i

this country were ﬁghting the war
primarily for their own class interests,
not for the national democratic in-
terests of the American people. If
there was some degree of national
unity during the war, and there was,
it was because the capitalists’ interests
coincided, to a certain extent, with
those of the nation at large, in want-
ing to secure the defeat of Germany
and Japan. Browder ignored the fact
that although these great monopolistic
interests and forces were compelled to
make concessions to the worker dur-
ing the war, that, as soon as the war
was over, they would sharpen up the

class struggle again, undertake to take _. 

away these concessions from the work-
ers and to increase their exploitation.

In fact, Browder forgot or ignored the 
fact, that Lenin’s analysis of imperial- _ 

  

I

THE PARTY AND THE VETERANS

ism remained valid, that the Marxian
concept of the class struggle. remained
valid, and that these basic Marxist
principles had not been wiped out by
this war.

When we look back over these mis-
takes, it seems that they were very
crude in character. But there was
something subtle about them, after
all. The fact remains that it was not
only our Party that made this mistake,
but every other Party I know of in the
Western Hemisphere. From none of
these Parties were there any voices
raised against the wrong policies that
were initiated by Browder. How can
we explain this? It’s true, Browder
had. great prestige and when he pro-

I posed these policies, there was a tend-
ency for these other Parties, like our
own, to accept them uncritically. This

, is only another way of saying, how-

. ‘ever, that the other Communist Parties

in this Hemisphere, like our own,

I ’ were badly lacking in Marxist-Leninist

training.

I You veterans, what part did you
play in all this? Of course, you had
very little to do with the actual mis-
takes of the Party. And I have spoken
to some veterans coming back who

 . said: “Too bad I wasn’t here, or we

 

wouldn’t have made this mistake.”
(Laughter) Now, I don’t know how
you fellows felt about this whole mat-

. ter in Europe, in the «Western Paciﬁc

and in the other points where you
were, but I must say that although
there were letters ﬂowing back and
forth all the time, there were very few,
if any, that came to our attention
criticizing the Party policy at the time
when the Party revisionist policy was
in force. So I hope that you don’t take

3 too proud an attitude in this matter

III

and be too ‘unforgiving of the Party
leadership for making this mistake. —

One thing we have got to recognize
in this situation and that is we must
make a distinction between the Party
and Browder. The Party has recog-
nized that it has made the mistake,
as the other Parties in the Western
Hemisphere are doing and is now
honestly correcting that mistake. Com-
munist Parties have made serious
mistakes before. If you will read
Stalin’s pamphlet on “Mastering
Bolshevism,” you will also see how
he points out to the leading cadres of
the Russian Party, the most developed
of all Communist Parties, how they
made the mistake of actually forget-
ting the capitalist encirclement of the
Soviet Union. And what could be a
more dangerous mistake than that?
The main thing that distinguishes a
Communist Party from other Parties
is not that it never make mistakes.
Communist Parties do make mistakes,
even though they are not as frequent
as other Parties’ mistakes. But the
great thing about the Communist
Party is precisely that it recognizes
its mistakes, analyzes them self-critical-
ly and corrects them. It’s such a correc-
tion that our Communist Party has been
making.

But Browder has not recognized his‘

mistake, is not correcting his mistake.
He is developing deeper and deeper
his opportunistic line. Actually Brow-
der went so far as to set himself up as
the theoretician for the bourgeoisie of
the world, particularly of the Ameri-
can big bourgeoisie. It’s a plan to save
and rebuild world capitalism. That is
the substance of his book on Teheran.
He has not retreated one inch from
that. On the contrary, word has come

 

112

to us in the National Office that there
are some Browderites, or confused
elements in our Party, who are now
trying .to justify Browder’s line by
circulating rumors through’ the Party
to the effect that the reason for the
present world situation of tension and
struggle and for the sharpened class
struggle in the United States is because
we departed from the line of Browder.
(Laughter) They say that because of
our wrong line we have united “the
bourgeoisie, and now look what we
confront. Such an argument is pretty
idiotic, but it shows to what extremes
those elements will go who want to jus-
tify the bankrupt Browder line that our
Party repudiated.

Comrades, the main thing is that
our Party has freed itself, or is rapidly
freeing itself, from this revisionism;
is learning how to be a ﬁghting Party
again. Even before the Teheran
Plenum of two years ago, the tendency
of Browder was more and more to

ON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REVISIONISM

tail behind the bourgeoisie. He did not
exercise a suﬂicient criticism of the
Roosevelt Administration, nor take a
suﬂiciently independent Party position,
with the result that the independent
role of our Party was weakened, the
ﬁghting calibre of our Party was un-
dermined. What we are doing now is
to teach the Party to ﬁght once more,
to stand up on its feet and take an
active part in these great struggles
that are now developing all over the
country. You veterans will be particu-
larly valuable in this respect.

What we need now is for the vet-
erans particularly, on the basis of your
experience abroad, on the basis of the
splendid, the wonderful experience
that you have had in participating in
the smashing of fascism, to give to the
Party your ﬁne militant spirit. I am
convinced that this conference here
will go down in history of the Party as
one of the most important that it has
ever held.
