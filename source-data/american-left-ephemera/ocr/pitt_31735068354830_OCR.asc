Text of the call follows:

:7. L4lL4//.l-.z..1J.;./ i/...-.,..... .

IN. approaching the 48th convention of our Union, marking the
anniversary of the founding 59 years ago of the Western.-Federation of
Miners, . we can assert pridefully that -* this great orgazination has
rarely, if ever, faltered in pursuit of its high ideals then affirmed. If Ed

Boyce and Bill Haywood, if the heroes of Cripple Creek. and the Cop-A

per Country were here today, the reverence they deserve wouldlbe
satisfied best by the record of deeds which the Unionthey fought to
build has compiled over the subsequent years. ' C

In no period can there have been recorded a higher level of or-
ganization. nor; a higher score of accomplishment than.in the year just

i I past.,As the sixth decade. of its history draws toward an end. the In-

ternational Union of Mine. Mill and
Smelter Workers is acclaimed to-
day as one of the strongest unions
on this continent. It has vitality and
power to surmount every obstacle
which stands in the way of secur-
'ity and economic freedom for its
members. . > .
During the past year, in the face
of employer resistance, in the face

of stifling government regulations,
standing almost alone as the lead-

spired restrictions, our Union
‘fought through to another collec-
tive bargaining victory. Last year
our Convention noted with satis-
faction “the bedrock strength‘

throughout one of the most difficult 
periods in its history." It is no ' ‘ . t Z .
longer necessary to reassure ourselves of our ability to defeat attacks
from scave-ngingsraiders. The stature of our organization today 1S

1 measured throughout the world by what it has done for its own mem-T“

bers in this most recent period, and for all of labor in North America.
' That doctrine which holds that the safety of one's country and the

stability of its economy depend upon the denial of wage gains and ,
U other benefits to the workers of‘ the country was shattered by the in-

dependent, united struggle of our members. These days, all of labor,
aroused by our success and by the increasingly intolerable conditions
whicl all workers endure under the burden df that doctrine, is tight-
ing valiantly and with greater unity of purpose. The masses of in-
dustrial workers throughout the United States and Canada, struggling
under a crushing load of taxation, high living’ costs, economic in-

security and political repression, will increase their resistance and will

In no year since the Butte miners,‘ on that 13th day, of lune in

1878, conceived the ‘plan of unionism for the miners, have the words, ,

of our bold foundersbeen more true than this year:

“We affirm the economic condition of the producer to be ,j{
that he is exploited of the wealth that he produces, being .1
allowed to retain barely sufficiena for his elementary neces-
sities." . l

Workers bear an unprecedented share of the greatest tax load in

the history of our two countries. In spite of the splendid gains made r

by our union. ourllmembers today endure a‘low,er standard of living
because of devaluation of their purchasing dollar. Inﬂation continues
on the steéplechase. while employers cash in at the payoff window.
At the same time. the American war economy. with its wasteful ex-
travagance oi the people's wealth. shows signs of increasing failure

WITH each passing day, Big- Busi-
lnelssiis displaying its “get toug ” pol-
icy with the workers and their unions.
"In full. page ads, the .steel industry has
:announced its anti-labor unity, reveal-
ing that the main obstacle in the nego-
tiations is theiexistence of the union
“Itself. ‘A Armed with Supreme Court de-
:icis‘ions and with a subservient Congress
in the palm of its hand, Big Business
"displays its restlessness to unfold its

full ‘program aimed at the crippling
fand then destruction of all unions.

, 7Not so long ago, during the Secon_d
;.World War, the U._ S. and Canadian
fgoveriiments proclaimed the ‘harmony
of union security with the nation’s se-
curity. They said, in effect, that strong
unions made strong nations. Today
that principle is thrown into the waste
;basket and ‘our countries are being
iso1__d,a bi1l.of goods which tries to say

,iVy\ca'k.

- =FOR.,__BIG BUSINESS the issue is al-
ready settled, and we in the U. S. have
only to vote in November to decide
‘Which way we prefer to be executed;
‘but the execution is already ordered.

V ~Andso, in a national election ye-ar,
the .major parties engage in the Great“
3Debate of whether the Taft-Hartley
‘law or -government, seizure is the more
effective method of breaking strikes. 4
And nowhere’ in these debates are any
-:voices,. raisedin defense of the work-
ers’ 1-just claims. '
_ ‘In,-all industries and against all un-
Ions, the employers are displaying a’
Jgrowing unity and hostility. They
‘speak no more of ‘favorite. sons or‘fav-
bred" unions. All‘ who work for wages
and ‘fight for a better’ living are the-
'targets of their determined unity.
Their objectives .are clear——to pre-
yent wage gains this year and tobe
ready’ for Wage cutting next year.
 FEW YEARS AGO, the Taft-
artley law was all they needed to
‘urn-ake* America strong.” Today, it falls
h_‘ort' of the rising ambitions of Big

them many new ideasof how to “make
merica stronger” by bfeaking up
oint "liargaining and forging heavier
hains for" the unions’ limbs. Four
years ago we were fed promises of
'c'.[,‘,aft-Hartley repeal; today, the old

they say, to “make_America strong.”
In_ Canada, union-busting laws are
in the making.
' Desperate and grave as the situation
is.and may become, labor has a key
trump to play: unity. With unity for
common ends, the unions could have
the power and ability to defeat this
Big Business offensive. In all indus-
tries and unions the workers are com-
ing» to realize the over-riding impor-
tance of unity in their ranks. ‘

ing for’ and they will judge allunions
and all leaders in this crisis by the ex-
tent they contribute to building a com-

'mon front against the employers in
defense of workers’ rights.

IN THIS SITUATION, more than ‘

everbefore, the workers need to match
unity with unity. The steel negotia-
tions and strike are a lessonfor all
workers and all unions. They reveal
that no union is big ,enou_ghltoday to
fight alone. They reveal that labor
must first and foremost forge unity in
its ranks. ‘A

Every Mine-Mill‘ local can strengthen
its own position by going into action
to increase all aid to the Steel strik-
ers, by taking the‘ lead -in forgingunity
in defense of the strikers.

The time is over—ripe for an inter-
national conference of all unions of the
U. S. and Canada to map out a fight-
ing p/rogram to stop «this Big Business
offensive and to throw every ounce of
labor’s strengthaintola defense of our
hard-won union rights.

TODAY we should remember. the
solemn warning against “rightist -re-
action” given by Franklin‘ Delano
Roosevelt in his last “state of ‘the Un-

such reaction should develop,_” he said,
“then it is certain that even though
we shall have conquered our enemies

on the" battlefields abroad, we shall ;

have yielded to the spirit_ of fascism
here at home.”‘ ‘

Labor unity can and must save
our nations from going further down
that road. ‘ '

Research Dept. issues
study on differentials

“The Case Against Area Differen-

We are not

tials” is thegtitle of an important study -

released to all locals by the Mine-Mill
Research Department. -

The 22-page report, prepared by
Research Director Bernard W. Stern,
reviews the history‘ of thelong fight

carried on by our union against area ’

differentials. Then it knocks over, one
by one, the" arious arguments by
which employers try topreserve dif-
ferentials--the “historically - estab-
lished” argument, the “cost of living”
argument and the “prevailing rate"
; 'gument.

A series of tables included in the
report point» up dramatically the man-
ner in which geographic differentials
hit hardest the Mexican-American
workers in the Southwest, but also vic-

_ timize thousands of workers in such
widely—scattered areas as Los Angles,

California, Omaha, Nebraska, and’ Bal- \

timore, Maryland.
“In-strict economic terms," the re-
port says, “a very good case can be

made out for uniform wages in our in-_
dustry for ‘the same kind of work re--

gardless of where it is performed.
Companies have been able _to get\ away

with payingless in some places either
because of special exploitation of mi-

nority groups, or because they have‘

been able to take advantage of unor-
ganized or recently-organized labor.”

The study is intended as ammuni-
tion in the 1952 bargaining campaign
to wipe outrarea differentials. This is
one of the major points in Mine-Mill's
national bargaining program. Copies

7 Managing Editor, March of Labor

‘Charles M.“White, President of Re-
public " Steel Corporation, stated: “A
prolonged strike may be'z'n the offing
. . . but it is far better than the
further intrusion of government into
pm'va.te righ.ts.” _ _ _

Newsweek presented the issue as,
“Either we make it legally possible
once more for a strike to be broken or
we yield completely to mounting unz'on_
demands.” V . '

Phillip Murray, addressing the union’s
policy committee, declared that no
group in the country was “big enough
to" whip this union.”

‘The major issues involved in the bat-

tle of steelwere dramatized by the 

frank statement ofa steel corporation
president welcoming a —_ strike; the

equally frank call_of a big business

magazine for the return to the “good
old days,” and (the steel workers’) ac-
ceptance of their challenge.

The struggle in steel is not just be-
tweenthe Steelworkers union and the
steel trust. There is an old saying:
“As steel goes, so goes the country.”

As this is being written, it is pos-.

sible todraw certain ‘conclusions about ’

the strike of 650,000 steelworkers.

. 1| W

The “national emergency’: exposed
itself as a big business gimmick. If the

best interests of the corporations cant‘
be served by provoking a strike in the3

most important _“defense” _ industry
then nothing will stand in their way-to
accomplish .it. Their crocodile tears
about “the boys in Korea” dfsappeared.

2.

/The struggle, «in steel dramatized
how universal an enemy the, Taft-
I-lartley Law is. It had been the think-
ing of the majority of labor leaders
that Taft-Hartley was not so bad as
they feared and that with a few
amendments, organized labor could live,
with it. The steel strike demonstrated
that the very life and death of our la-

_ bor movement depends on destroying "

this weapon of big business. I

For’the past four years some union

officials envied Murray's intimate re-

Alations with the /Truman administra-

tion. Then came the steel crisis and

DENVER -—'The ln’rernationa'l Executive"
Board. after hearing_a report by ‘Editor
John Steuben, Voted to sponsor a subscrip-
‘lion campaign for March of labor.

.The "Board estimated that between now
and Labor Day it will be possible to obtain

. a minimum of 2,500 new subscribers. .

President John Clark sent a letter to all I
local unions urging their agtive participa-
tion in support of the March of Lobo
subscription drive. .

tration left the leaders of the steel-
workers union with no alternative but,
to fight on the picket line. Historians
will-Vcite the steel struggle as an out-,
standing example of labor jeopardiz-
ing a cause by relying upon a “Demo-
‘cratic party, as the Republican party.

4. ‘

The Wage Stabilir. .tion Board, a
product of the “national emergency,”
was exposedcompletely as a govern-
mental agency whose objective is to-
keep wages down. So long as the ob-
jective was accomplished big busi-
ness gave it all-out support. When
the WSB was fprced by the steel strike
threat .2 to "deviate from its original
course, big business repudiated it. The
‘steel strike cries out for an immediate

withdrawal of labor’s representation. .i

from this wage-freezing agency.

There are certain times in our labor
movement where disagreements, nar-
row jurisdictional considerations, per.

sonality problems and other conflicts _

must be brushed aside and replaced by
the kind of labor solidarity matching
that of ‘the big corporations. This kind
of labor unity is required to silence
the anti-labor hysteria gripping Con-
gress.

i~  Bosses see wage cuts
9 aheacl++hey think

Why has the steel industry carried

. on, such a furious drive to ‘block the

1 w’a'ge demands of steel workers?

_ , Here’s theganswer, from no’ less a
»:;,corporation mouthpiece than Business

' 1 ’Week, the McGraw-Hill magazine:

I It’s the first’ step in a campaign to

, -“soften up” the unions in preparation

. for wage cuts which industry intends

. to impose when a ‘.‘recession” hits some

' time, in the near future.

Business Week uses guarded lan-

' guage to say this, but that’s how ‘it

’adds up. An editorial article in the

,June ,7 issue of the magazine says

 «r“‘Tomorrow’s big labor problems . . .

'.will arrive for each industry when

H recessive pressures, already felt

‘.;‘~_\thrQughout the economy, became strong

 enough to make it imperative. that in-

dustry cut labor costs.” ’
,Most

« 5 “never negotiated in any way except

-- up.”_-And it adds: “Negotiating down

will be _a brand-new experience for

’f which they are little prepared.” ,

‘ The wage-cutting tomorrow “is al-

ready here for textiles,” it points out-,

and shows unhappiness over the fact

 ,_t,hat textile workers are putting up a

fstifflbattle against wage cuts.

 “When the next recession comes, it

will find the economy in a more

-.unioniz_ed state than it ever was before.

, . . . The trouble in textiles. now sug-

. gests that it will not be an easy time

‘. , ,. responsible labor-leadership (will
be) well advised to do some preparing
in ’ advance.”

Business Week: might ‘have added

_ that the steel industry, backed by the

; National Association of Manufacturers

‘ and mostgof the big corporations, is
doing everything. it can to give the
steel union leaders “preparation in

 advance” for wage cuts. . ’

' But the McGraw-Hill writers know
that both the “softening up” and the
wage cutting are not going to be easy.

' ..They add that “some of -the biggest
battles in labor history have been
fought not FOR higher wages but

I AGAINST wage cuts.”

.96-sun D'ALENES. S

~ WALLACE, ~ldaho—The plot of the
3'}: A larger Coeur d’Alenes mining opera-
 ~-‘. tors to destroy district-w1de.barga1n-
‘: king ‘between Mine—Mill and the em-
'1 ployers reached a new stage last week.
A National Labor Relations Board
hearing into various petitions for rep-
_ resentation elections got under way‘ in

 ' thecity hall here.
' The main cog in the machinery of
- the Bunker _Hill & Sullivan and Sun-
.. mshine Mining companies to scuttle the
‘ strong unity of some 3,500 Workers. in

the area hasbeen the attempts of the

X tnational CIO -and several AFL craft
 unions to raid the powerful Coeur
d’Alene District Miners’ and Smelter-

men’s Union No. 18. The rihgleaders -

in the CIO and AFL raids are notor-

ious company stooges.
The raids have been in progress for
 some time. Mine-Mill’s attempt to get
4 -a "quick election has been blocked by
" a rash of petitions which would carve
up the district-wide working force into
a.’ crazy—quilt nightmare that would

 ’ leave the workers disunited and help- -

‘less. _
‘In order to bring some sanity into
'  the picture, Mine—Mill has filed a peti-
Ation calling upon the NLRB to con-
ductﬁan election on a district-wide
_basis_ among all employees of all com-
; ﬁpanies involved. ‘ ' 
I 7 i‘ . THE PETITION, if allowed, would
V ‘establish one big union-—Local 18—as
" the only union in the district. It would
 require all of the operators to bargain
'jointly with the union on a district-
wide basis. It would retain the estab-
r as-lished“practice. of area ‘bargaining and
a -single contract with one wage scale
. and‘ one set of working conditions for
. all Coeur d’Alenes workers. It would
extend the bargaining unit to include
~ those companies and employees not
 now included. : _  \ .
. Meanwhile, it has been reported by
“ Board Member Chase ‘Powers of Dis-
trict 7, ,.who is/directing Mine-Mill’s
. campaign, that the CIO has run out of
A, gas in its propaganda warfare against
Mine-Mill. An intensive radio bat_tle
‘has been won by’Mine-Mill, yvith CIO
‘virtually withdrawing from the air
after it became apparent that all it
A could talk about was a‘ phoney “red

  fZinc boss tells how
a  tooause depression

BAYARD, N. M.-—A recipe for creat-

 ing an artificial depression for zinc
workers was dished out ‘here recently
by Joseph H. Taylor, vice president and

A general manager of the Peru— Mining

Company and New Mexico Consolidated ‘

V . “ Mining Company. Both of these opera-

-tors‘ are wholly-owned subsidiaries of-

‘the Illinois Zinc Company.
Taylor handed out his formula for an
_ employer’-made depression during 9.
P bargaining meeting with the joint ne-
‘ f'"’g_otiating committee for the two prop-
erties from Mine-Mill Local 890.

First he complained bitterly about
the recent drop in the price of zinc,
which had been riding at all-time high

1 levels for nearly two years. Then he

disclosed that the zinc industry in the

—, ‘U. S. is determined to fight to push
‘ prices back up. " ‘

FINALLY CAME Taylor’s bald ad-
mission that the operators in the Amer-
ican Zinc Institute have reached an

A agreement to deliberately restrict pro-
duction§n order to drive up zinc prices.
‘That means, of course, cutbacks to a
five-day week-—a serious form of wage

* ‘ " cut for workers who have been on,a

P steady six-day week for more than two
years. ‘

M Eyen more serious, it is already be-

, . ginning to mean layoffs for workers in

L ‘ dated. Thus the employers in the zinc

Uindustry are creating a full-blown de-

_ ~ ~ pression for their employees—just for

‘ the sake of holding on to the fabulous

Contract talks with 16 operators are
ata virtual standstill. Bunker Hill and
Sunshine have even refused to bargain.
Coeur d’Alenes workers are looking
anxiously to the NLRB to help speed

v the day when bargainingcan open up

in earnest.
-' “We a-re completely confident," Board
Member Power said,‘ “that in any elec-
tion which the NLRB may order and
conduct in this district Mine-Mill will
emerge as the choice -of the vast ma-
jority of workers. _The miners and
smeltermen here are sick.and tired of
this disruption and confusion created
by raiding c1o‘and AFL leaders, aided
and abetted by Bunker Hill & Sullivan
andiSunshine. Mine-Mill is anxious to
clear all this rubbish out of the way
in order to get on with main job of ne-
gotiating a new contract.” ‘‘

COLD DECK DEAL

Three weeks before the convening of
the Republican Convention on July 7,
to be followed by the Democratic Con-
vention, the top question in the minds
of the people\——“Why Korea, and howto
bring, the war to an end?”———remains

- unanswered.. ‘*

And, we might as well face it," de-
spite of all the wacky analysis, the Eu-
ropean situation revolves now as it has
been and will_ in the foreseeable future
upon our giving more and more money,~
goods and services. ’

The people are sickened over’the
brawls and connivances indulged in the
primary campaigns in the selection of
delegates—as. much so in direct pri-
maries as by convention action.

The man on the street is bewildered
and disgusted with the line-up of can-
didates—since it is a common verdict
that all fall far short of meeting. the
qualifications of outstanding leadership
that the ‘people feel is essential to the

- high‘ office of the presidency. andlpro-
motion of the common good.

From the present outlook, the work-
ing stiff will likely be/ given a "cold-
deck deal. «

.~ profits into mountains of dollars is
goodfor the workers. And along with
this, they have put thru a “Wage

Freeze” to be extra sure that ‘profits \ ‘

keep going up and real wages keep

going down. And they do all this in I

the name of “liberty.”

But the workers of Local 625, headed
by President Bernard Redd, have
stepped up to say they are not agreed
upon such a definition of liberty. They
have written their Congressmen that the

-A high profits insured by the Wage
Freeze are slashing into, the worker’s
standard of living. _ '

“Wage stabilization,” they wrote,
“has meant that our members are’ ham-
strung in every attempt they make to
improve their standard of living. The _

  WSB cuts  
of Utah CIO Steelworkers" i

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah —- More
than a full year after -they started ne-
gotiations, the members of.the CIO
Steelworkers Union at three lead and
_zir. plants in this areahave finally

gotten their “answer” from theWage . _

Stabilization Board.
The answer was a disappointment.

The overall “package” handed down

, by the WSB came to over 2 cents an“
hour less than the 20 cents an hour
recommended some months ago by a...
Board panel. The decision affects
workers at. the U. S. Smelting & Re-

fining Co., the Combined Metals & Re- 1

duction Co., and the New Park Min-
’ ing Co. ' ', ,
THE BOARD granted the basic 8 ~

cents across the board wage increase _ 

whichwas won by Mine—Mill Kennecott
workers ’way last fall.
that it had to give this 8 cents increase
/because of the.“tandem” relation with
other (Mine-Mill-) workers in the area.
working in the same industry. ‘

But the trimming was done by the V

Board on the re-classification. demands

which the CIO Steelworkers had made; '

after monthsof expensive “time and
motion” study by. “outside experts.”
‘ The overall result was that workers at I
U. S., Combined and New Park got a
package that came to about 3 cents
less. t an Mine-Mill’s 1951 contract
gains inéthis area. And Mine—Mill Ken-
necott locals won .an additional 3 cents"
under a contract reopener back in Jan-
uary of this year. ‘ .
At the same time, in another CIO‘
Steelworkers case, the Board denied“
the demand for three weeks’ vacation ‘
after 15 years at the American‘ Smelt‘-~
ing &. Refining Co. operation in Gar-
field, Utah. ’Denied- also was the un-_
ion’s demand for a; $3.69 increase in

- basic salaries. The Board did grant, 3‘ 

however,'the unions demand for double- ’“
time in excess of  on holidays. ‘‘

 
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
   
 
 

average of $1.70 an hour‘ inflationary. ‘
This of course is absurd.

“Companies are making’ millions of 

dollars profit and nothing is said about
inflation, but if a man -working in a.
plant is going to make a few more
pennies an hour it is made out to bean
economic catastrophe. Mr. Congress- '
man, this Wage Stabilization Board is
systematically lowering the workers’
standard of living. . . . We ask you to

vote to eliminate the Board and per- V

mit us to do our bargaining directly
with the companies.” ‘ ‘

coln praised the people of Baltimore

VALLEY DOLOMITE

BONNE TERRE, Mo. — Mine-Mill’s

‘first 1952 breakthrough in bargaining

with operators in this important lead
belt has been made at the Valley Dolo-

. mite, Company here.

A contract won by Mine-Mill Local
618 calls for wage increases ranging

'between 10 a11d 15 cents an hour and

averaging’ 13 ‘/2. cents. It also provides
for a $50 Christmas bonus and 3 weeks’
vacation after’ 15 years’ service. .s

The pact, which brings the comman
labor rate to $1.50 an hour, carries 10
additional days of sick leave, bring-
ingthe annual totalto 25, and pro-

vides for 3 days off with pay for any N

Worker" in whose family there is a
death. . ‘ W

The Valley Dolomite victory was
significant in
view oflwhat has‘ been happening at
the nearby St. Joseph Lead Company
plant, with which the CIO Gas, ‘Coke
& Chemical Workers concl-uded a con-
tract last month. Although» the Gas-

- Coke contract provided, for a 5 per cent

wage increase, the increase was wiped

1 out by a wage cut based on the drop in

lead prices. \

This is of considerable importance
in Kimberley, where Local 651 is en-
deav_oring to do away with “short

The determination of the miners and

-back on an ancient device——the lock- A ,

demand of their employees. '  A r A
But the device is boomeranging.-In-’ ',.,:"_i,
stead of blunting the workers’ pressure’_
for a wage increase, it is steppingup . 
their militancy and unity. ' 

It began when ‘workers 2 at Stewart 3
Diecasting held 2} brief stop-W‘ork meet-'

‘ ing several weeks ago ‘in order to dis-

cuss the ,5low progress of ‘negotiations ., 7
and the failure of the boss to offer a , .
decent ._wage increase. The StewartM,°.g:,
‘management shut down the plant and j" _"_ ,
locked the workers out.‘ By the end of ' 
last week, most of the Stewart work- «_; L
e-rs were back on thejob, fighting mad.

The same pattern was followed at 

it Paragon Diecasting, where the work-

ers were also locked out for foursdays 
after they held a stop—Work meeting. is

;: The third plant at which the device _
was tried was Magnus Metals, where

a lockout of a week end d June 23. A‘
day after the workers re%1rned to their
jobs 11 workers Were fired on false
charges of slow—down. ’

These events have served to make

win a healthy wage increase in 1952
