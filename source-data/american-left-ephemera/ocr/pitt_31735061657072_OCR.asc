Creeping McCarthyism.‘

Its Threat to Church, School and Press.

I am glad to be here among my fellow Democrats of New York .

State, to greet and pay tribute to my old friend, Paul Fitzpatrick, who
has so arduously and faithfully carried on the duties of State Chairman
through many years of political adversity as well as in time of victory
and success.

Under the leadership of Dick Balch, our new State Chairman, the

Democratic Party of New York is going to continue to be a ﬁghting, -

liberal, forward-looking party, with ranks open to all who wish to carry
on the ideals of Al Smith and Franklin Roosevelt. S

Never in my memory, which is a long one, has the Democratic
Party faced a greater challenge. Never have all of us, not only as
Democrats but as Americans, confronted such difficult prospects and
issues whose solution involves the fate not only of our party but of our
country, and the free world.

For the ﬁrst time in twenty years we have met defeat in a national
election. We are, for the first time in two decades, the party of the
opposition. Yet, although the role of the opposition party is tradition-
ally the lighter one, we face, in fact, as heavy a responsibility as ever
we faced as the party in power.

Some of the problems and issues have already been sketched by my
distinguished friends and colleagues who were so generous with their
time as to come to New York for this important discussion tonight.

And I should like to add, parenthetically, what a noble addition
there was to the Senate last November, despite the national set-back,
when such able, courageous and ﬁghting young liberals as Scoop Jackson
and Mike Mansﬁeld came to join us. In the few months of their ﬁrst
session of the Senate, they have been thrown into the front ranks of
battle. They have won their spurs.

We have need of these young valiants. And it is signiﬁcant that
although the American people, last November, elected a Republican
President, and by a narrow margin turned the Congress over to the
Republicans, the people also turned out of office some of the most reac-
tionary of the Members of the Congress, and elected good liberals in
their place. Senators Jackson and Mansﬁeld were among those who
breasted the tide and won outstanding victories.

But some powerful members of the reactionary core of the Repub-
lican Party, were, however, reelected. It is about them and the trend
which they represent that I would talk to you tonight—the growing
disease of McCarthyism and Jenneritis. '

 

 

 

A Real Threat To The Nation
Much was said, during the presidential campaign and even in more
recent months, about the danger of f‘Creepir_1g Socialism”. Of course,
this danger was pure hobgoblin, raised by those who wanted to frighten

the American people into unthinking fear and mistrust of the Democra-if
' tic .Administration.

But there was and is a real danger. That danger is “Creeping
McCarthyism” —— a subtle poison which has already eaten deep into the
muscles and sinews of our entire body politic. It has sapped the courage
of millions of our fellow citizens. It has gnawed at the roots of our faith
in civil liberty. It has weakened the fabric of our faith in democracy,
itself. ‘

I have often spoken on the subject of civil rights. I have regularly
denounced the denial of basic rights to some of our fellow Americans
because of race, creed, color, or national origin.

And, indeed, such denial and discrimination are terrible evils which
cruelly violate our national conscience. We must not rest until these
iniquities are completely corrected. The Democratic Party will lose if

it retreats one step from its advocacy and efforts in behalf of all the-

measures necessary to eliminate this shame from our national life.
But while we continue to strive for equality of rights for all our

citizens, we dare not overlook the creeping blight which threatens to‘

destroy, with equal disdain for all, the very structure of all our liberties.

This, my friend, is what we have come to. I say to you with all
the conviction at my command that our very faith in our basic liberties
is being steadily, dangerously undermined. We have already experienced
a lessening in our courage to defend these liberties.

Investigators Turned Inquisitors

Step by step we have retreated in the past four years. The pre-
sumption of guilt now surrounds anyone accused by McCarthy, Jenner,
Velde and their ilk. The Investigators, who might better be called the
Inquisitors, have taken oﬂice, self-nominated and self-elected, as the
Annointed Guardians of our national security, the High Prosecutors of
the disloyal and the Supreme Judges of the loyality and‘ morality of
everyone. ,

Questioning the political past, the intimate morals, and the per-
sonal associations of all our citizens has now become routine and ac-
cepted. Gradually we have become accustomed to practices which, at
an earlier time, would surely have revolted us. Already we tolerate,
without public complaint, that congressional investigation committees
should subpoena novelists, essayists, and magazine and newspaper edi-
tors, professors, scholars, and school administrators to inquire into their
political backgrounds and personal habits, back to the days of their
youth and their childhood.

 

 

 

  

Even newspapermen are called before these committees and grilled
as to their political beliefs.

It may be that some few individuals in these professions are or at
one time were Communists. But that certainly has not impinged or di-
minished the loyalty or the integrity of the mighty institutions of which
these few individuals are a small part.

I would like to say that as far as I am concerned, I have fought
against Communism and all forms of totalitarianism all my adult life
 . years before McCarthy and others of his stripe had ever uttered
a word or even acknowledged the existence of a Communist or Fascist
threat to our Democracy. . V

I have no use for Communist conspirators. Any one of them who

can be shown to plot and intrigue against the security of the United
States should be duly punished, under law. Any one of them who com-
mits esponage or sabotage should be punished to the fullest extent of
the law. .
But I believe that the police agencies of the United States, including
the FBI, are competent to deal with violations of our laws. And the
courts are equipped to weigh the evidence and to pass judgment upon
these subversive law-breakers.

Bill Of Rights Being Subverted

Above all I believe that the time-tested institutions of America
which are synonymous with freedom, and for those whose protection
the Bill of Rights was written into the Constitution—the press, the
stage, our colleges and universities, and our churches — all these must
be completely free from intimidation or coercion by the would-be thought
police of congressional investigating committees. These great American
institutions must be depended upon to police and regulate themselves,
insofar as the political beliefs and private morals of the individuals em-
ployed in these ﬁelds is concerned. For Congressional committees to
interfere in these matters is to sap the roots of our freedom and the
pillars of our democracy.

Is it a fact that our schools and universities are indoctrinating our I

youth with Communist ideology? Of course not. Are the press and
publishing industry succumbing to Communist inﬂuence? This, too, is
ridiculous even to suggest. ‘

I certainly have no fear of the Communist ideology in the free
market place of ideas. I believe in democracy. I believe in the people.
I am conﬁdent that the American people can tell the difference between
the true and the false, between what is good for America and what
would be fatal to America. And the American people have, in fact,
shown that they hate and reject the Communist ideology.

Then why this panic? Why have we given over to the McCarthys
and the Jenners the awful power to prosecute and to judge not only

 

  

public servants but private citizens— scholars, writers, teachers, and
scientists—on the basis not only of their beliefs but of their associa-
tions, past and present?

Why have we so degraded ourselves and so exposed ourselves to
international contempt and ridicule as to permit our ‘country to be stam-
peded by these Congressional vigilantes? How can we tolerate such a
spectacle as that presented by the recent European tour of two brash and
brazen youths who, under the aegis of the McCarthy Committee, turned
all our embassies and foreign missions upside down, and who presumed
to sit in solemn judgment on the loyalty of the American Ambassador
to Great Britain?

Yet the fact is that we now take these things for granted. We take
for granted that a congressional committee has the moral as well as the
legal right to sit in judgment on the standards of teaching in our schools
and colleges, and to take over the responsibilities of the boards of trus-
tees and of the school administrators in deciding who is and who is not
a proper teacher in these educational institutions.

Silent Publishers

I am a member of the Banking and Currency Committee of’the
Senate. We have recently considered legislation to provide stand-by
authority to impose price and wage controls in time of war and national

emergency. Spokesmen for the publishing industry came before us and
-mdemanded that we exempt the newspapers of this country from any such

controls, on the ground that the imposition of price and wage controls
on the publishing industry, even during a war or a national emergency,
would be an abridgement of the freedom of the press.

Yet spokesmen of the publishing industry are mostly silent when a
Congressional committee, without the beneﬁtiof law, presumes to tell
the editors who is or is not a proper employee, a capable reporter, a suit-
able writer, on the basis of his political beliefs.

Oh, this is not being done frontally. It is being done obliquely.
These Congressional inquisitors are not attacking the New York Times
or the Hearld Tribune. They are going after individual newspapermen,
here and there, on one pretext or another.

But they are establishing a precedent. They are getting us accus-
tomed to the idea of investigating the press, as they have already accus-
tomed us to an investigation of our educational institutions, as they may
soon accustom us to an investigation of our churches.

Aﬂect On Our World Leadership

What a spectacle we present to the rest of the world. We have
convinced our own people that this great democracy of ours is honey-
combed with traitors, spies, subversives and sexual deviates. Our demo-

 

t—>{~—'s .._.._..._..- .._ ___, r ,,

 

 

cracy is portrayed as so weak a system that it must devote all its internal
energies to investigation, recrimination and denunciation.

What is happening today, my friends, is that we are, in fact,
abridging our Bill of Rights without being conscious that it is being
abridged, by indirection, innuendo, smear and attack.

All this is being accomplished subtly, gradually, almost impercept-
ibly. This is the great achievement of McCarthy, Jenner, and the others
of similar attitude. Even if they, themselves, were suddenly and mirac-
ulously to disappear from the political scene at this moment, or were
to be successfully restrained by the Administration —— and I see‘ no pros-
pect of this —— the result they have already achieved would long remain.

McCarran Act Is Result Of Fear

The total impact of their efforts is not confined to the headlines.
It ﬁnds its way into the body of our laws. I need mention only one
example—- the McCarran Immigration and Nationality Act— which is
an outstanding instance of legislation based on fear and hysteria.

I have drawn a black picture. I have done so intentionally. I have
tried to bring out as forcefully as I could what has happened and is
happening to us all. I would not so depict it, unless I thought we all
needed to be shocked into affirmative action. We need to be reminded
of the wisdom of Thomas Jefferson’s Words when he said, that “Eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty.”

This is a challenge to the Democratic Party and to all its leaders.
Whether we win or lo-se the elections of 1954 or 1956, we have a duty
and responsibility to ourselves, to our great past, and to the future of our
country, and of freedom in the world.

It may be that a frontal attack on McCarthyism is not the way to
political victory. It may be that the majority of the people of our coun-
try have grown to tolerate and accept McCarthyism. Certainly a great
number have, and this is our greatest danger.

But regardless of its effects on our prospects for political victory,
we cannot compromise with this evil thing. If we can save the cause of
freedom in our country, by risking political defeat in the next election,
let us take the risk. Let us keep faith with freedom.

No promise of political victory can compensate for the prospect of
freedom’s end.

We, of the Democratic Party of New York, can serve as the stand-
ardbearers for the cause of freedom. The traditions of our political
past —— of Jefferson, Jackson, Wilson and Roosevelt — shall give us arms
and courage for this battle.

And I am conﬁdent that in this holy cause, we will prevail.
