THE NEW? CAPITALISM AND
THE SOCIALIST

the growing separation between ownership and control is of great
importance. The older capitalist was usually the owner, promoter
and superintendent of an industry. An argument for private owner-
ship frequently advanced in the old days was that unless the execu-
tive was spurred on by the incentive that comes from ownership
he would lack sadly in initiative and enterprise. Socialism, it was
said, would fail to give the “captain of industry” a large enough
stake in the ownership of a concern, and could thus not be depended
upon to encourage maximum efﬁciency.

In the large corporations, this situation has, to a considerable
extent, changed. There are today thousands of executives who have
little or no share in the actual ownership of the corporations for
which they work, and to whom salary and the satisfaction in doing
a good administrative job are the primary industrial incentives. On
the other hand, the vast majority of the stockholders know little
or nothing about the conduct of the corporations to which they have
legal title, and confine their activities to the purchase and the sale
of stocks, the signing of proxies and the drawing of dividends.

After describing the indifference of the average school teacher
owning a few shares of stock in a corporation, to the problems of
management, Owen D. Young, in. arecent article, has the follow-
ing to say regarding the attitude of the large investor:

Suppose you go to a large investor and say that he owns a very
large block of shares in the General Electric Company and is in a
position to exercise great inﬂuence, and you hold him responsible for
the moral conduct of its business. What will his answer be?

He will say: “My bankers have advised me that it is a very sound
business. We have held that stock in our family for many years. It
has always paid us dividends and shown us increasing value in
principal. I look at the ﬁnancial statements. I do not even know
that my household buys General Electric products. I never thought
to look. Obviously, I assume no responsibility for its moral conduct.
In fact, I would not know, in those complicated transactions, whether
a given policy was wise or not. Clouded as the issues are, I could
not know whether a course of action was right or wrong.

The point is that in your modern business organization of large
size we have completely divorced ownership from responsibility. Now
ownership. has little or no relation to the conduct of the business.‘

The chasm between the absentee owner and the salaried man-
ager is thus becoming ever wider. This growing separation be-
tween ownership and management places the upholders of the
status quo more and more on the defensive in proving that society
should indeﬁnitely support, through proﬁt, rent and interest, a class
that is becoming increasingly functionless.

In a sound social economy, declared R. H. Tawney in his /I c-
quisitive Society, the ﬁrst principle to be enunciated is “that those
who render service faithfully shouldibe honorably paid, and that
those who render no service should not be paid at all . . .

Today [he continues] the enjoyment of property and the direction
of industry are considered . . . to require no justification, because
they are regarded as rights which stand by their own virtue, not
functions to be judged by the'success with which they contribute to a
social purpose . . .

The basis of the New Conservatism appears to be a determination
so to organize society, both by political and economic action, as to
make it secure against every attempt to extinguish payments which
are made, not for service, but because the owners possess a right to
extract income from it‘.

 

Tawney maintains that the only sound and common sense in-
dustrial system is a functional society, a society

which aims at making the acquisitions of wealth contingent upon
the discharge of social obligations, which seeks to proportion re-
muneration to service and denies it to those by whom no service ‘is
performed, which inquires ﬁrst, not what men possess, but what they
can make or create or achieve, a society, further, whose direction and
government are in the hands of persons responsible to those directed
and governed.

Tawney and others further contend that, sooner or later, as a
class becomes increasingly functionless, it must give place to those

9

groups on which the actual workings of the economic machinery

most depends.’ A.

An increasing number of economists are following Tawney in
his Acquisitive Society in questioning the relationship between the
contributions of the growing number of absentee owners and the
rewards which they are exacting from society.

III. NEW INCENTIVES FOR THE EXECUTIVE

HIS DEVELOPMENT, at the same time, is compelling many cor-

porations to emphasize among their executives other incentives
besides that of ownership. President Walter S. Gifford of The
American Telephone and Telegraph Company, in which ownership
is so diffused that no one individual possesses more than one per
cent of the stock, recently maintained that the different character
of the stock ownership found in large modern corporations was
greatly changing the incentives of management. He declared:

From the incentives of personal proﬁt, the change is to me of
pride in the job and the satisfaction of rendering a public service . . .
More and more I encounter men of the highest ability who regard
business not as a means to acquire personal wealth, but as a fascinat-
ing profession and as an opportunity for accomplishment. They do
not seek more money from it than enough to give them comfortably
only those things really worth having that money can buy-freedom
from ﬁnancial worry, security for their families, books, art and travel.
But they do want an outlet for their energies, exercise for their brains,
and above all they genuinely want to be useful. . . . Business is be-
coming a profession.

New incentives to effort are in force. I know it is popular to smile
at the notion that the ideal of service, of a job well done, is an ade-
quate substitute for more acquisitiveness, but it is becoming daily
more evident that this is really so. Today, without the possession
of great sums of money one may live well, and it is increasingly
questioned whether great fortunes are a real help to happiness.‘

“The real news about business it seems to me,” declared Walter
Lippmann several years ago,
is that it is being operated by men who are not proﬁteers. The

10

managers are on salary, divorced from ownership and from bar-
gaining. They represent the revolution in business at its very heart.
For they conduct gigantic enterprises and they stand outside the
higgling of the market. . . . The proﬁt motive is not their personal
motive. . . . They have found an interest in the actual work they are
doing. The work itself is in a measure their own reward. The
instinct of workmanship, of control over brute things, the desire for
order, the satisfaction of services rendered and uses created, the civi-
lizing passions are given a chance to temper the primal desire to have
and to hold and to conquer.”

President Sloan of the General Motors is ﬁghting against this
trend and is striving to give his executives a deﬁnite ﬁnancial interest

\ in the success of the business as a whole.” A good many other cor-

porations, through bonus and other devices, are following suit. How-
ever, it is altogether likely that the great modern corporation must
depend increasingly on non-proﬁt incentives for maximum eﬂiciency
among their administrative oﬂicers, the same kind of incentives that
must be brought into play under a cooperative system of industry.

THE CAPTAINS or FINANCE

There is, of course, this difference between private and public
ownership: under private ownership managers are under constant
pressure to produce as large a proﬁt as possible for the stockholders
of their respective concerns, even though none of that proﬁt goes
directly into their own pockets, and they are adjudged successful or
unsuccessful in proportion to the growth of these proﬁts. Under pub-
lic ownership the main criterion of success is service to the com-
munity at the lowest possible cost. As the late Professor Veblen also
brought out a few years ago, modern administrators and technicians
ﬁnd their eﬁicient functioning frequently sabotaged by ﬁnancial in-
terests intent on manipulating business with a vew to large specula-
tive gains.

The material welfare of the community [declared Veblen] is unre-
servedly bound up with the due working of this industrial system,

11

and therefore with the unreserved control by the engineers, who alone
are competent to manage it. To do their work as it should be done
these men of the industrial general staff must have a free hand, un-

production of the goods and services needed by the community they
neither need, nor are they in any degree beneﬁted by any supervision
or interference from the side of the owners. Yet the absentee owners,
now represented, in effect, by the syndicated investment brokers,
continue to control the industrial experts and limit their discretion,
arbitrarily, for their own commercial gain regardless of the needs
of the community.“

The modern ﬁnanciers, Veblen maintained elsewhere,

are experts in prices and proﬁts and ﬁnancial manoeuvres; and yet
the ﬁnal discretion in all questions of industrial policy continues to
V rest in their hands. They are by training and interest captains of
ﬁnance; and yet, with no competent grasp of the industrial arts, they
continue to exercise a discretion as captains of industry. They are
unremittingly engaged in a routine of acquisition, in which they
habitually reach their ends-by a shrewd restriction of output, and
yet they continue to be entrusted with the community’s industrial
welfare, which calls for maximum production. . 

So it happens that the industrial system is deliberately handicapped
with dissension, misdirection, and unemployment of material re-
sources, equipment, and man power, at every turn where the states-
men or the captains of ﬁnance can touch its mechanism; and all the
civilized peoples are sulfering privation together because their general
staff of industrial experts are in this way required to take orders and
submit to sabotage at the hands of the statesmen and the vested in-
terests.

FROM “HUNcH” TO SCIENCE

The executives in the large, standardized corporation, as con-
trasted With those engaged in ﬁnancial manoeuvre, of Whom Ver-
blem was so critical, are also a somewhat different type from the
older promoter—executives of a few decades ago. Of necessity they

12

hampered by commercial considerations and reservations; for the

must depend less upon his intuition, upon their “hunch,” more upon _

 

‘ data supplied him by research and statistical staffs. President Gif-
fords declares:

Decisions can generally be made with deliberation in a modern
business enterprise. Few unforeseen emergencies demanding hasty
judgments arise in the management of big, stable, modern corpora-
tions. Administrative problems are foreseen in advance; they are
studied with care and with a knowledge of facts; expert advice is
sought upon every aspect of them. The decisions arrived at do not
need to be spectacular . . . The old time business ideals are disap-
pearing. “Playing the hunch,” “taking a chance,” “trusting to luck,"’
have no place in the modern corporation’s vocabulary. They belong
to the pioneer days when the elements of luck and speculation were
often the main factors. . . . Corporatio/n executives do very little guess-
ing about the factors of their problems; they collect all available cur-
rent information and experience, and then employ skilled men to
digest it and project their knowledge upon the future. Decisions are
made upon common sense deduction from these probabilities.”

We do not need to agree wholly with the observations of Presi-
dent Gifford regarding the revolution that has occurred in modern
business———and I take certain exception to the picture drawn, as I
indicate later—-—to conclude that the average executive in the modern
large corporation differs considerably from the business man of the
past and that many administrators are depending on the same
essential incentives for their best work as would be brought into
play under a socialistic order. The new type of administrator could
thus adapt himself with far greater ease to socialized industry than
could his more individualistic predecessors. In fact many would
greatly prefer Working for the service of the community than for
the enrichment of a small group of transient and absentee owners.

Professor Rexford Tugwell, in I nclustry’s Coming of Age (p.
232)’ is inclined to the belief that the diffusion of ownership of cor-
porations among large numbers of stockholders will give executives
the dominating say, and that they will be inclined to consider the
interests of the public quite as much as those of the stockholder. He

13

brings to his support likewise the authority of J. M. Keynes. Many
cases can undoubtedly be adduced for and against this theory.

The swift changes in our industrial machinery and the lack of
machinery for democratic control, it may be added, are at present
frequently resulting in a flood of arbitrary and often conﬂicting
orders from the men at the top of the pyramid to the executives in
the operating companies, in entire ignorance of the concrete situa-
tion at the bottom. It often means that, while the job of the execu-
tive is developing into a profession, it is developing into a profession
bereft of real power. Many executives ﬁnd themselves, as far as
labor, manufacturing and other policies are concerned, mere mouth-
pieces of men who chance to be in temporary power at the apex of
the combines. The increasing need of the functional control visu-
alized by the socialists as a corrective of the arbitrary control found
in this form of modern industry, is obvious.

IV. CHAOS IN INVESTMENT

HE ABSENTEE owner, though separated from management,

still performs, it is true, the function of saving and investing.
Recent developments, however, are leading an increasing number
of students of affairs to the conclusion that he is performing that
function in an ineﬂicient manner and that much of our present mal-
adjustment is due to lack of social direction of our capital resources.
Many students are in fact becoming convinced that the com-
munity, with thousands of statisticians at its command, with a com-
prehensive knowledge of the trends of industry, with an ability to
coordinate investment in various industries and to develop a happy

balance between the investment of capital in new productive equip- i

ment and the enlargement of the consumption power of the masses,
would be in a position to perform the function of investment much
more scientifically and much more economically than it is‘ now be-
ing performed by the vast army of individual investors, assisted

14

 

i » though these investors might be by the modern investment counsel-
lors, investment trusts and other ﬁnancial institutions.

As John A. Hobson, well-known British economist, points out,
the present economic system, with its great inequality of income and
its lack of unified control,

is kept going in a series of spurts and stoppages. Properly adjusted,
by distribution which gave a larger share to labor, a smaller to
capital, it could work fully and regularly all the time, with such
minor wastes as attend all human efforts and estimates. The total
production would be enormously greater than now. Enough saving
would be elfected, probably as large, or even a larger quantity than
now, but a much smaller proportion of the larger total income. But
this is not likely to be achievedexcept by bringing the productive
processes as well as the distribution of incomes under some intelligent,
conscious, uniﬁed control.”

In the old days, accumulation of capital depended primarily on
the efforts of individuals. Today it is the increasing practice of
the modern corporation to keep aside from surplus a very consider-
able sum for improvement and expansion of the industry, instead of
paying out in dividends the entire surplus and then raising new
money for improvements entirely from the issuance of bonds or
stocks. Corporate saving is to a considerable extent taking the
place of individual saving.“ Upon the transfer of ownership from
private to public, it is extremely likely that this form of saving
would be continued and expanded. Thus the problem of saving
under socialism with a View to the expansion of industry would be
less of a problem than the older economists seemed to fear.

V. CONCENTRATION OF CONTROL

HE SEPARATION of ownership and management which is in-
creasingly characteristic of the new capitalism has been ac-
companied by an ever greater concentration of industrial control
through the development of mergers, holding corporations, invest-
ment trusts and voting trusts, by the purchase of industrial stocks

15

by great ﬁnancial houses, by the growth of the vertical, horizontal
and circular trusts, by the issuance of non-voting preferred and

common stocks, as well as by the diffusion of stock ownership

among large numbers of the populations. When a comparatively
few owners possess large blocks of stock in a corporation, they usu-
ally take a keen interest in its affairs and hold a check upon the
management. When, as in the case of the American Telephone
and Telegraph Company, no one owns more than one percent of
the stock, control is concentrated in the hands of the small group
of officers who hold the proxies. In fact, control is often concen-
trated in proportion as ownership is diffused.

“The prime fact confronting us as a nation,” declares Profes-

sor William Z. Ripley, “is the progressive diffusion of ownership 0

on the one hand and of the ever—increasing concentration of man-
agerial power on the other.” Professor Ripley has given example
after example of the manner in which the non-voting stock has
been used by inside manipulators to exercise power over vast prop-
erties. The financial structure set up by Dillon, Read at the time
of the purchase of Dodge Brothers is a classic illustration. Here a
banking house buys up the automobile company at approximately
$146,000,000. This sum they recover, if the plan works out, from
the general public by the sale to the public, for $160,000,000, of
bonds and preferred stock at par and 1,500,000 nonvoting shares
of Class A common stock. But not a singe one of Class B voting
stock is sold. “The promoters have virtually paid themselves a
handsome proﬁt for the assumption of the entire dictatorial power,
having mortgaged the property to the full amount of its original
cost through outstanding bonds and preferred stock.”

The pyramiding of industrial control by our holding corpora- ,

tions is clearly shown in our public utilities, particularly in our
electrical industry. The Federal Trade Commission maintains that
the possession of a million dollars worth of stock in the holding
company at the top of the pyramid may mean a control of some

16

 

hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock in the operating
companiesat the base of the pyramid. Thus H. M. Byllesby &
Company, with an investment of less than $1,000,000 was “able
to exercise the voting control over more than $370,000,000 of
operating capital.”"

The development of the investment trust of the type of the
United Corporation is likewise assisting in the movement toward
concentrated control. The United Corporation, organized in 1929
by the banking houses of J. P. Morgan, of Drexel and of Bon-
bright, to secure minority interests in some of the great companies
in the utility field, has already bought heavily in the Niagara-Hud-
son, the Consolidated Gas, the United Gas Improvement, the Elec-
tric Bond and Share, the Public Service of New Jersey and other
corporations, and is regarded as among the most powerful factors,
if not the most powerful, in the electrical field today.

OUR NATURAL RESOURCES

Our new capitalism means the dividing of many important
industries among a very few great capitalist groups. In the basic
natural resources, two corporations control about one-half of the
iron ore of the United States; four corporations control about
half of our copper resources; one corporation——the Aluminum
Company of America, controlled by the Mellons—-own almost
all of the bauxite deposits from which aluminum is made. The
International Nickel Company stands unchallenged as the largest
producervof nickel in the World. Eight corporations dominate over
eighty per cent of the anthracite ﬁeld, and great concentration is

appearing in the ownership and reﬁning of lead, zinc and other de- l

posits. In the oil industry the Standard Oil group is still dominant.

PUBLIC UTILITIES

In our public utilities,local monopolies, in the nature of the
case, prevail. Nationally monopoly is becoming increasingly the

HE LEAGUE for Industrial Democracy is a membership society
engaged in education toward a social order based on production
for use and not for profit. To this end the League conducts re-

search, lecture and information services, suggests practical plans

 

for increasing social control, organizes city and college chapters,
publishes a monthly bulletin and books and pamphlets on problems
of industrial democracy, and sponsors conferences, forums, lunch~
eon discussions, and radio talks in leading cities where it has chap-
ters. The League invites those in sympathy with it to join its ranks.

order of the day. In our telephones, one group, the Bell Tele-
phone System, controls over three—fourths of our telephone ser-
vice; another corporation, the Western Union, controls three-
fourths of the nation’s telegraphs. Still another company con-
trols the major part of radio communications and?’ two companies
preside over the destinies of the nation’s cables.

In the case of our railroads, more competition prevails, al-
though consolidation is going on apace, and holding companies
are working day and night to bring supposedly competing units
under the same sphere of inﬂuence. In the ﬁeld of electrical
power, four electrical groups control a majority of electricity
produced in the country. In the manufactured and natural gas
industry the great oil and electrical corporations are reaching
out for increasing control, while in that part of the water supply
not now in the hands of municipalities a vigorous movement
toward concentrated control has just begun. '

GENERAL INDUSTRY

When we enter the expansive ﬁeld of manufacturing, we
ﬁnd the U. S. Steel and the Bethlehem Steel dividing most of
the orders for steel products between them. In the new and
mighty automobile business, General Motors and Fords are turn-
ing out the majority of the country’s motor cars. The “Big
Four” in the packing industry kill and sell most of the nation’s
cattle. One company—the American Sugar Reﬁning Company
and its aﬂiliates-—-do a large portion of the sugar reﬁning busi-
ness of the country. The General Foods Corporation, the General
Mills Corporation, the National Dairy Products Company, the
National Biscuit Company, the United Fruit Company and the
Standard Brands, are symbolic of the trend toward the giant cor-
poration in the ﬁeld of food supply.

In past decades, entertainment was regarded as one of the most
decentralized and individualistic of industries. In the realm of the

”1s

 

radio, the movie, the theatre, a condition of semi-monopoly now pre-
vails, as the existence of the National Broadcasting Company, the
Radio Corporation of America, the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Cor-
poration, the General Theatres Equipment, the Paramount Publix
and the Shubert Theatre corporations, bear witness.

The equipment of our industries is, for the most part, in the
hands of big business. The General Electric and the Westinghouse
manufacture more than half of the equipment for the electrical in-
dustry. The Western Electric supplies most of the wants of the
telephone industry. The American Locomotive, the Baldwin Loco-
motive and the Bethlehem Steel divide the locomotive ﬁeld among
them. Two corporations control the In/anufacture of most of our
passenger and freight cars. One corporation monopolizes the par-
l.or car business. One corporation—the International Harvester
Company—manufactures around half of the farm machinery of
the country, while another possesses a practical monopoly over the
manufacture of shoe machinery. In the supplying of elevators, of
radiators, of oﬂice supplies, of aluminum cooking utensils, of sew-
ing machines, of matches and a number of other necessities, fewer
and fewer huge corporations are becoming the dominating factors.
Since the war, the Du Ponts, the American Chemical and Dye,

‘the Union Carbide and Carbon and one or two other companies

have become the great feudal lords of the expanding chemical
business- In rubber, the ﬁeld is divided for the most part among
four industrial giants and rumors of new combinations are daily
being circulated.

BANKING

In the great domain of ﬁnance the chain bank, the branch bank
and investment trust movement have all aided in credit concentra-
tion, while billion dollar banking institutions are appearing on
every hand. As a result of the merger movement, the largest 250
banks, constituting one per cent of the banks of the country, now
possess resources of over $33,4-00,000,000 or 46 per cent of the

19

total for the country. Twenty-four New York banks, or less than
one-tenth of one per cent _of the total, directly control 15 per cent
of the nation’s banking resources, while their capitalization is ap-
proximately equal to that of 20,000 country banks situated in
towns of 10,000 population or less. And these ﬁgures give but a
slight indication of the real extent of ﬁnancial concentration in
the United States.

A decade or two ago in the ﬁeld of marketing, the small, inde-
pendent corner grocery stores, the meat and drug stores were un-
disturbed in their mastery of the distribution ﬁeld. Today, with the
advent of the chain store, the unit store is having an increasingly
hard struggle for survival. One organization, the Atlantic and
Paciﬁc Tea Company, controls around 20,000 stores, and does a
business of over a billion dollars a year. Ten chains already have
a gross annual income of over $100,-000,000, While the retail chains
in general conduct about one-ﬁfth of the total retail trade in the
country. Even in agriculture chain farms, “factory” farms, corpora-
tion farms, are making their appearance, While the farmer——except
to the extent that he belongs to the cooperative movement—-is in-
creasingly dependent for his supplies, equipment and market on
huge, trustiﬁed concerns.

Where actual consolidation has not taken place, trade associa-
tions have frequently eliminated the old forms of competition dear
to the heart of the laissez faire economists. Concentration has like-
wise been furthered through interlocking directorates. Thus We
ﬁnd Albert H. Wiggin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of
the Chase National Bank, the largest bank in the world, a member
of nearly a half hundred public utility, manufacturing and ﬁnancial
concerns. Samuel Insull in 1930 was serving on over eighty boards,
Richard B. Mellon, brother of the Secretary of the Treasury, on
nearly ﬁfty, William W. Mellon, on thirty-eight, P. A. Rocke-
feller of sixty-eight, Oris P. Van Sweringen on thirty-two and
Patrick S. Crowley, President of the New York Central, one over

20

 

seventy. The list could be added to ad inﬁnitum. A compilation of
the ﬁnancial and the industrial connections of the “rulers of

_ America” mentioned by ex-Amabassador James W. Gerard would

make interesting reading. In many instances men with large
controlling interests are represented on numerous boards by law-
yers or by clerks in their oﬂices serving as their “dummies.” Just
how the strings are pulled it is often diﬂicult to say.

We have long since broken away from the old moorings of
“rugged individualism,” and are drifting toward the sea of com-
plete or semi-monopoly. Where competition is still maintained, it
is in many instances a very different kind of competition from that
in the past.

THE ROAD TO SOCIALIZATION

In the good old days of the past, the social reformer, seeing
this drift, raised the cry_of “smash the trust.” The trust proponent
smiled and declared that it Was “hard to unscramble scrambled
eggs.” Some of these scrambled eggs were for a while unscrambled,
but the modern critic of things—as-they-are no longer hopes to restore
free competition. He is looking more and more toward some form
of social control as the way out. He is either demanding regulation
where no regulation exists or more effective regulation where regu-
lation has ‘already been tried. “Effective regulation . . .” declare the
minority report of the New York State Commission on Revision
of the Public Service Commission Laws, “has broken down and the
consumer has been left to the exploitation of the monopolistic private
companies which control the public services. Unless effective regula-
tion can be restored there is bound to be a rapid shift of public
opinion in favor of public ownership and operation.” Many have
already made that shift. They have come to the conclusion-that
effective regulation is impossible Without the creation of a vast, cost-
ly, state and national regulatory bureaucracy; that that bureaucracy
gives rise to other serious problems and that the only adequate solu-

21

 

tion of the problem of the trust is an advance to public owner-
ship. Of course, in changing from a private to a social basis, it is
easier to transfer to public ownership a few great corporations
dominating most of the field in a particular industry than it is to
socialize a large number of isolated units. From this point of view,
the new capitalism, socialists declare, is ‘preparing the way for
some form of socialization. ‘

VI. CHANGING STRUCTURE OF INDUSTRY

HE NEW capitalism is also developing certain novel kinds of

industrial relationships, as that between the various units of
the General Motors, relationships which render it possible to bring
under one uniﬁed control a vast industrial empire.

The General Motors, for instance, has under its control nu-
merous huge plants for the manufacture of the Chevrolet, Pontiac,
Oldsmobile, Oakland, Buick, LaSalle, Cadillac, etc.; for the pro-
duction of General Motors Trucks, Yellow Cabs and coaches) of
Fisher bodies, of various automobile accessories, of the electrical
refrigerator, Frigidaire. It controls numerous credit, sales and
realty corporations. It manages agreat aircraft industry and a
radio industry. It owns timber tracts and saw mills. It employs
something like $50,000,000 in overseas operations in assembly
plants and in merchandising operations. It centralizes a number
of activities for the purposes of producing economies, at the same
time administering its separate automobile subsidiaries as self-con-
tained units, “headed by an executive who has full authority and is
responsible for its individual operation.”

The Ford Company, the other giant in the automobile field,

is likewise illustrative of the newer trend. Here may be found
under one corporate roof nearly two score plants in the United
States and several abroad. The Ford Company owns a ﬂeet of

boats, possesses nearly half a million acres of timber and ore land

22

 

in upper Michigan, operates coal mines in Kentucky and West
Virginia, railroads, tractor and airoplane plants and great re-
search laboratories. In the «Highland Park plant alone there are
a dozen departments which, if set apart by themselves, would
make sizeable industries. The radiator department, for instance,
is capable of producing more radiators than all other radiator manu-
facturers combined. The spring, axle, or steering gear departments,
if freed from Ford production demands, could supply. the balance
of the entire automotive industry. Here also are extensive glass
and leather plants, a department where F ordite, a rubber compound,
is made and a textile factory which weaves cloth on its own looms,
as Well as numerous retail stores for the Ford workers. Indeed,
this huge establishment possesses the aspect of a small American
city. In years gone by one of the chief objections to socialism was
that public industry would be so unwieldly that it would fall of its
own weight. The great billion dollar combinations of the present
day prove that far vaster aggregations of capital can be controlled
by one corporate unit than was formerly deemed possible. Thus
another anti-socialist contention may be———at least in considerable
part—dismissed from further consideration.

With the development of the trust, public industry has likewise
begun to assume new forms. Thus the government corporations
formed during the war. Thus the Port Authority of New York,
and in Canada the Hydro—Electric Power Commission, with its
partnership arrangements with 600 municipalities for the genera-
tion and distribution of electrical energy. The possibilities of this
newer type were thus summarized by the New Republic.

The government may set up a corporation which has as much

freedom from legislative interference and red tape as any other cor-'

poration. The legislature may deﬁne the purpose of the corporation
and outline the method of its control; it may make an initial appro-
priation; beyond that its detailed control may stop. If the corpora-
tion has any voting stock, that stock may be vested in an executive
official who has an advisory board, or it may be vested in a specially

chosen board of directors. This chief authority, whoever he is, pro-
ceeds to direct and take full responsibility for the government’s busi-
ness, just as if he were a corporation director representing private
stockholders. The forms which have been developed to handle busi-

ness undertakings are utilized for government service. A political-

administration whose prestige largely depends on the success of such
an important undertaking is likely to take pains to discover a good
manager.

VII. INCREASED PR/ODUCTIVITY

ECHNICALLY the new capitalism is leading to lightning changes
Tin machinery and the use of power, and to far greater produc-
tivity than ever before existed in the history of the world. Since
the beginning of the century, productivity per capita in the United
States has increased about sixty per cent, and, per worker, about
seventy-ﬁve per cent.” In the decade 1919 to 1929, according to
the indices of the Federal Reserve Board, output per man in manu-
facturing increased by 45 per cent." Enough can now be produced
in our industries to abolish poverty from the land. The realized
income in the United States now averages about $745 per capita or
over $3,725 per family of ﬁve. The new capitalism has brought the
problem of production nearer to solution. The big problem now

_ before us is the problem of distribution. Dexter S. Kimball writes,

in Recent Economic Changes:

Until comparatively recent times the problem of industry was to
produce in suﬂicient quantity to supply the demand. Today the prob-
lem of industry is largely that of disposing of its products. If the
manufacturing industry should devote all of its energies to the pro-
duction of necessities alone, it would be dilﬁcult to dispose of the
output intelligently. The problem of industrial production has been
temporarily solved, and as a consequence we have passed from a

“sellers” market to a “buyers” market. . . . If poverty and industrial l

distress still exists, it is because of our inability to keep our industrial
machinery in operation and to distribute equitably the resulting prod-
ucts. It is not sufficient to be able to produce abundantly; we must
also be able to distribute intelligently.”

VIII. LACK ‘OF STABILIZATION

UR NEW capitalism has particularly failed to place on a sound
basis many of the foundation industries of the country. Agri-
culture is a deficit industry. If $10 a week were set aside for the
Wage of the independent farmers and 4% per cent were allocated to
cover the interest on the value of the equity in their farms, the
farmers of the country would be in “the red,” according to Pro-
fessor Morris Copeland by over $1,700,000,000 a year. The
textile, the bituminous coal, the lumber and other industries, even
during the post-war years of so—called prosperity, may also be in-
cluded in the list of our “sick” industries.”

’ As has been brought out elsewhere, the new capitalism has not
stabilized industry. We have developed certain agencies such as
the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Farm Board which are
experimenting in industrial stabilization, but such stabilization has
by no means been attained. We have had our usual periods of de-
pression since the war, in 1921, 1924, 1927, and the 1929-30 crisis,
with two mild dips and two severe crises. The present crisis has
placed on many relief organizations a more severe strain than any
period of depression since 1914 and our failure to increase the con-

suming power of the people in a manner commensurate with their '

productive power and to coordinate our industrial machinery, bodes
ill for the future. I

“What will happen,” Professor John Dewey asks,

when new industries become in turn overcapitalized and consump-
tion does not keep up in proportion to investment in them; when they,
too, have an excess capacity of production? There are now, it is esti-
mated, eight billions of surplus savings a year, and the amount js
_ increasing. Where is this capital to ﬁnd its outlet? Diversion into
the stock market gives temporarily relief, but the resulting inﬂation is
a “cure” which creates a new disease. If it goes into.the expansion
of industrial plants, how long will it be before they, too, “over-
produce”? . . .
The question of, which and how far the newer industries will fol-

25

low the cycle of the older and now depressed ones, becoming over-
capitalized, overproductive in capacity and overcharged with carry-
ing costs, is, of course, a speculative one. The negative side of the
argument demands, however, considerable optimism. It is at least
reasonably certain that if depression sets in with them, the process of
public intervention and public control will be repeated.

HOBSON ON INSECURITY

John A. Hobson, the British economist, in his recent remarkable
volume on Rationalization and Unemployment, further elaborates
this thesis. “It is now a generally accepted truth,” he declared, “that
in organized industry there exists a general excess of productive
power, in the sense that any attempt to operate this power at full
capacity, so as to produce goods as fast as they can be produced, is
soon checked by the failure of the markets, followed by a suspension
or restriction of productive activity.”"'°

This situation is brought about by the “maldistribution of in-
come of such a kind as to place too much purchasing power in the
hands of the richer classes who allow it to accumulate for invest-
ment, too little in the hands of those who desire to raise their
standard of living. The necessary effect is to evoke a monetary sav-
ing which is found to be excessive, in that the increased good
it is intended to produce cannot actually get produced, because
there is an insuﬂicient market for them. A better and more equal
distribution of ‘surplus’ income is thus seen to be necessary to
give full, continuous employment to capital and labor in an eco-
nomic system whose productive technique is constantly enlarging
the productive powers of the community.”

.:This disparity between productive power and consumption
capacity, continues Hobson, is becoming greater with the in-
creased rationalization of industry. The author points to the fig-
ures given out by the National Bureau of Economic Research,
ﬁgures which show that, between 1922 and 1927, while the average
earnings of factory employees in the United States increased at the

rate of 2.4 per cent a year, output per man increased by 3.5 per
cent a year and the profits of industrial corporations, at the rate of
9 per cent.” To this must be added the fact that the total number
of workers in these industries showed a reduction of nearly 10
per cent.” Rise in wages, he insists, must keep pace with the rise,
not in production, but in productive power, if the balance is to
be maintained. “For we have seen that it is productive power
that tends to outrun actual consumption, and to be held up by
periods of un- or under-employment. The relatively high wages of
Americans have admittedly been a stimulative and sustaining force
for high productivity. But the statistics we have quoted, and the
recent disclosures of great waste, not merely through unemploy-
ment, but through the concealed waste of excessive selling-appara-
tus, indicate that though wage-rates are rising for skilled and un-
skilled labor, they are not keeping pace with proﬁts in the distribu-
tion of the enlarged product. There is an aggregate displacement
of labor (i.e., more unemployment) and a reduction in the propor-
tion of high-skilled labor to low-skilled in the advanced and “ra-
tionalized’ industries. Final consumption is quite evidently failing
to keep full pace with increased capacity for production under the
new conditions.” 2’ V

Mr. Hobson attributes the somewhat longer period of prosperity
than usual following the first post-war crash—a situation that was
heralded throughout the world as the beginning of a balanced
economy—to several developments which are not likely to occur
soon again. These included the recovery of our suspended opera-
tions in making and repairing houses, roads, and many sorts of
plants, the immense expansion of our foreign loans involving the
export of goods, “the reconditioning and to a large extent the re-
victualling of,Europe, and the comparative shortage of unskilled
labor due to the checks of immigration." 2‘

“These seven years of high and almost unbroken prosperity are
no evidence of any lasting balance. They do not refute the statistical

evidence showing the diminishing part played by labor in produce
tion, and the diminishing share of the total product going to labor
in the rationalized industries.””

Thus the new capitalism, according to Mr. Hobson, “exhibits
immense, almost immeasurable, potentialities of production, every-
where kept in leash by the obvious insuﬂiciency of the markets.” Can
it so expand its market, he asks, as to realize the full economies of‘:

production? On this point the British economist expresses much .
‘skepticism. If free competition went hand in glove with rationaliza-

tion, lower production costs might be passed on to the consumer
in lower prices. However, the process of rationalization normally
signifies the development of trusts, combines and cartels, which
tend to eliminate competition in selling prices, and to regulate out-
put to maintain a profitable price level. Ofcourse, the possibility
of outside competition often prevents prices and proﬁts from be-
coming too high, and the worker-consumer often receives some of
the gains due to the substitution of mechanical processes for human
skill. “But there can be no ground for holding that rationalization
as a Whole tends to a distribution of income favorable to the work-
ers, either through raising wages or lowering prices. On the con-
trary, the policy plays in two ways into the hands of capital: ﬁrst,
by substituting more plant and power for manual labor, and second-
ly, by strengthening the capitalists’ power to limit supply and ﬁx
selling prices at a level which, yields the maximum profit.” ”

PHILOSOPHY OF HIGH WAGES
Many American capitalists, it is true, have adopted the philoso-

phy of high wages, on the ground that the existence of such wages ‘

is a necessary condition of expansive markets, on which mass produc-
tion rests. However, the realization of this fact does not induce any
particular" rationalized industry to pay higher wages than it needs.
For the proportion of such increased income paid to its workers
that would be applied to increased purchases of the particular goods
it produced would be very small. Some corporations, it is also true,

28

, ..._ I"ﬁ§&'ur"s.~)$-«><A*-.4 » 

 

- .g...¢.~ -

have adopted welfare measures in addition to the payment of wages,
and this practice to some extent “tempers the rigors of American
capitalism.” But that the worker and consumer reaps the full gains
of rationalization is a ‘grotesque contention.’ ”

Only through the extension of public ownership, of social con-
trol of investment, the steady increase of wages, the increase in in-
come and inheritance taxes and the enlargement of the social ser-
vices, concludes Hobson, can the growing insecurity in American
industrial life be checked and an approach be made toward a bal-
anced economy.

U. S. A WORLD"/PowER
Our new capitalism has meant greater investments in foreign

markets. By 1927, over twelve billion dollars of American capital
had been invested abroad as compared with only two or three bil-

lion pror to 1914.

These investments have been accompanied by an increase in
military and ﬁnancial supervision over many Latin American states
in which we have made investments, and greater military establish-
ments at home. President Hoover declared in his message of De-
cember, l929, that our expenditures for military purposes increased
from $267,000,000 in 1913 to $739,000,000 in 1929 and were
in thatyear greater than those of any militarized nation of the
world. In dealing with the results of our diplomacy in Latin
America, Dr. Samuel Inman of the Federal Council of Churches
warned us a while ago: “We are piling up hatreds, suspicions, rec-
ords of exploitation and destruction of sovereignty in Latin Amer-
ica such as never failed in all history to react in war, suﬁering and
defeatpof high moral and spiritual ideals.” " '

THE NEW CAPITALISM AND WASTE

Our new capitalism has not materially reduced Waste in in-

dustry. It has reduced waste in individual plants. It has, to some

29

extent, led to the standardization of parts and the simpliﬁcation
of styles, but What has been saved in production has often been lost
in distribution. While the number of Workers in manufacturing in-
dustries decreased from 11,492,000 to 10,746,000 from 1919 to
1927, a decrease of about 750,000, the number of mercantile em-
ployees engaged in selling goods increased during that period from
4,476,000 to 6,122,000, an increase of over a million and a half.
Among this number we find high pressure salesmen, marketing psy-
chologists, statisticians, researchers, forecasters, advertising and
publicity experts, and a host of others. Stuart Chase estimates that

, one—half of our industrial effort is still wasted in unemployment, in

the production of illicit and unnecessary commodities, and in

other Ways.” -
Mr. Charles Merz’s description of hypothetical sales campaigns
now conducted by our corporations has more than a grain of truth

in it. He declares:

It is impossible to put much trust in the quaint notice of Thoreau’s
that if a man living in the woods makes a good enough mouse-trap
the whole world would beat a path to his door to buy it. Launch
a new mouse-trap in 1928 and the effort is spectacular. Surveys are
undertaken to determine the presumptive sales-resistance of potential
purchasers of mouse-traps of different sizes, shapes and colors. A
national advertising campaign is undertaken to instruct the country
in the use of bait. Pictures of villages in ﬂames call attention to the
fact that more harm is done by mice each year than was done in
Belgium by the German army. Prizes are offered for the best letter
on mice, the Mortal foe of Men. Mice clubs are organized in public
schools and October 6 to 12 is announced as National Anti-Mouse
Week.

At the proper moment the Mouse-Trap Boys strike up at Station
KDA, broadcasting ukelele programs.

IX. THE PROFIT MOTIVE

UR NEW capitalism has developed a more extensive propaganda
machine than was ever organized by industry in the history
of the world, and it has been using this machine to convince the peo-

30

/

    

v

          

ple that the modern motto of business is service.”

However, despite the fact that many individual administrators
are thinking in those terms, no one can read Messrs. Chase and
Schlink’s Your M oney’s Worth and study the analyses made by
their Consumers’ Research, Inc., by the U. S. Bureau of Standards,
and other organizations; no one can read the testimony of cor-
porate practices in the electrical, oil and other great industries
given in recent years before public investigating bodies and study
the pages of Professor Ripley’s Main ‘Street and Wall Street; no
one can follow the lobbying disclosures in Washington and digest
the reports of the Southern textile situation without developing a
very great skepticism regarding the extent to which the pecuniary
motive has as yet been displaced from industry as a whole.”

THE RADIO INDUSTRY

Thus We read the testimony of B. J. Grigsby, president of the
Grigsby-Grunow Company of Chicago, receiving set manufac-
turers, regarding the alleged workings of the proﬁt motive in one
of our youngest industries:

I am president of the Grigsby-Grunow Company of Chicago,
manufacturers of Majestic radio-receiving sets. During 1929, we
produced approximately 1,000,000 sets at a retail price of $150,000,000
. . . out of an estimated total of 3,900,000 sets produced in the United
States, with a value of $490,000,000. Our output of sets was larger
both in number and value than that of any other manufacturer in
the United States, including the Radio Corporation of America . . .

We had licenses under the receiving-set patents of the Radio
Corporation of America, the General Electric Company, the Westing-
house Company, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Com-
pany, sometimes known as the Radio Trust. In the year and a half
in which we have made radio sets we have paid that monopoly
$5,302,879.15 in royalties. If we had not been compelled to add this
royalty to our manufacturing cost, the retail purchasers of Majestic
sets would have been saved approximately $15,000,000. . . . We did not
pay this royalty because we considered these patents worth such a

31

royalty. We did not believe we needed these patents, and none of_
them had been adjudicated. But the radio combine had so terrorized
the industry and had so intimidated the dealers and jobbers every-
where that they were afraid to handle what they called ‘unlicensed
sets.’

Our bankers said they would not ﬁnance us unless we took out a
license. They said they would not ﬁnance a patent ﬁght against such
a monopoly, and there was nothing left for us to do but to sign the
license agreement. The patent situation in the radio industry is be-

coming intolerable. When the Radio Corporation ﬁxed its royalty
rate at 7% per cent, it did so on the pretense that it had a complete
monopoly of the radio patent situation. . . . This is not true. We are
now paying royalties to three other patent owners, and have been
sued by ﬁve additional companies, claiming infringment of seven
patents. In no case has the Radio Corporation protected us against
these patents.“

In somewhat similar vein is the statement before the same Com-
mission of an accountant of utility companies, our “public service”
corporations, regarding the Way in which holding companies some-
times milk operation companies Whom they are organized to serve.
According to this testimony, for the thirteen year period from 1917
to 1929, the American Gas and Electric Company, a holding cor-
poration, received in fees $16,624,000 for services actually costing
$4,360,000. For every $100 charged against the consumers $26

Worth of services were rendered.”

 

OUR INVESTMENT TRUSTS

In his Investment Trusts Gone Wrong, John T. Flynn tells
something of the new device of investment trusts as a means of
reaping great ﬁnancial returns. A ﬁnancial house organizes

an investment trust—-—T he United States and Foreign Securities
Corporation. They bring together into this fund $30,000,000. They
supply $5,000,000 of it themselves. For this they get all of the Second
Preferred Stock of the company, which is worth $5,000,000 by itself
for it pays a guaranteed dividend of 6 per cent. They get, in addition,

32

:4. w

 

without paying any extra money, 750,000 shares of the common stock.
In a single year, this common stock, for which they paid nothing,
earned $5.86 a share. This amounted to $4,395,000. These earnings

— were not paid out in dividends but they remained in the assets of
the corporation to fix the liquidating value of the common stock.
This was the result from a single year. This was earned through
the management of the golden eggs of other people skilfully assembled
in that proliﬁc incubator which the bankers called the United States
and Foreign Securities Company.“

RACKETEERING

In ordinary industrial concerns, the profit motive, some would
call it the “racketeering” motive in industry, is still going strong.
Stuart Chase devotes pages to a catalogue of goods—good, bad and
indifferent—Which sell at many times their value under camou-
ﬂaged descriptions. Here are but a few samples:

Carbon tetrachloride [a grease solvent, moth killing agent, etc'.] . . .
wholesales for 8 cents a pound. The druggist charges you 50 cents a
pound evenin 5 to 10 pound quantities. Carbon disulphide sells at
wholesale for,6 cents a pound, and the druggist charges you 70 cents;
ammonium sulphate sells for 2% cents and he charges you 35 cents.

Electric ﬂat irons imported at a landed cost of 77 cents sold
at retail for $5.50 and $6.50 according to a Senate investigation.
Marcel irons landed for 13 cents sold for $1.39, a margin of 1000
per cent; Haarlem oil with a landed cost of 9 cents sold for 55; cod
liver oil landed for 7 cents sold for $1.25. . . . In short, innumerable
cases are to be found where the retail price is not twice but three, ﬁve,
ten, ﬁfty times the manufacturing cost (and sometimes the wholesale
price). Mass production is continually driving manufacturing costs
down. Retail prices stay stubbornly up, often increase. . . . Thé
margins are mostly eaten up in selling expenses. The selling expenses
are largely composed of useless and often unwanted services, of
propaganda, special pleading, and misinformation which increase
the consumers’ ignorance, of carrying in stock a dozen brands of
the same basic thing. ‘What we want nowadays," says Abe Martin,
‘is less service an’ more of what we’re payin’ for.’ Think of the 400

separate concerns all making roofing cement to one basic formula-

33

coal tar and asbestos—-yet all doubtless spending money and plenty
of it, to persuade the consumer of the unique and unparalleled excel-
lence of each brand.“

Mr. Chase devotes chapters to a description of the gentle art
of producing shoddy and adulterated goods, of utterly misrepresent-
ing through advertising the goods that are being sold and the value
of those goods, despite the Pure Food and other regulatory laws.
And many there are who believe that, as more and more of our
school and college graduates ﬁnd it impossible to earn their living
in the production end of industry and have to turn to high pressure
salesmanship of goods and securities, an increasing amount of “rack-
eteering,” for lack of a better term, may be expected in the industrial
and ﬁnancial world.“

It is of course true that many engaged in mass production have
concluded that a low price and large sales will at times yield a
larger net proﬁt than a high price and limited sales, but this theory
is not entirely new. It is not now by any means universal, as the
comparison between domestic rates for electricity in America and
in Ontario indicates, and it does not show the elimination of the
pecuniary motive.“

X. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME

HE NEW capitalism has not brought us nearer to equality of

income. For several years up to 1921, income, it seemed, was
becoming more evenly distributed. On the other hand, from 1921
to 1926, concentration has set in again. The wealthiest one
hundredth of one per cent of income takers in 1921 secured a yearly
income averaging $151,552; by 1926, the income of this group
had advanced to an average of $391,763. In 1914, income receivers
securing $5,000 or more in 1913 dollars secured some 10.22 per
cent of the realized national income; by 1921 that proportion had
decreased to 7.55 per cent, but it increased again during the next
few years and by 1926 it had advanced to 12.72 per cent." The in-

come tax returns of 1928 show that in seven years the number of
persons having an income of more than $1,000,000 a year increased
from sixty-seven to almost ﬁve hundred. Twenty-four of these
latter had incomes of more than $10,000,000 a year. According
to Prof. Paul H. Douglas, while the proportion of the national
income going to labor has increased a few per cent from 1899 to
the present, that proportion has decreased from 1920 to 1926 from
64- per cent to 56 per cent.”

XI. NEW CAPITALISM AND LABOR

F WE TURN to the effect of the new capitalism on the wage—earn-
I ing population we will note certain changes. The hours of
labor have been reduced about ﬁve hours per week on the average
since 1914, although they still average over ﬁfty hours a week; in
the textile industry of the South they often range from ten to over
twelve hours a day. Despite the reduction of hours in such in-
dustries as steel, a recent investigation of that industry showed
that 44.6 per cent of the men studied Worked ten hours, 2.1 per

. cent, eleven hours, and 6.7 per cent, twelve hours a day.” And

what many workers have gained in hours at the shop they have lost
in time spent in travelling under congested conditions to and from
home.

There has been some increase on the average in the real wages
of the workers. Dr. Morris A. Copeland placed that increase at
nineteen per cent from 1913 to 1927.” Still the average Wage in
industry is about $1,200, slightly more than $23 a Week, consider-,
ing unemployment.“ Great numbers of people, perhaps a majority,
still secure less each year than conservative research bureaus deem
suﬂicient for a decent American life.“

It is true that many more business men than formerly see, with
Messrs. Filene, Foster and Catchings, and with the socialists, the
need for high wages on the part of the mass of workers, if the mar-

35

ket is to absorb the ever greater quantities of goods that can now
be produced under modern methods of mass production.

It is true that employers today are thinking more in terms of
unit labor cost, and somewhat less in terms of hourly wage. It is
true that many employers are constantly beseeching other business
men to raise the wages of their workers, so that purchasing power
may be increased. However, there are not many instances of em-
ployers’ voluntarily raising wages of workers unless they expect a
correspondingly greater product from them. Even Mr. Ford justi-
fies his wage policy on the basis of increased productivity. He says:

The payment of ﬁve dollars a day was one of the ﬁnest cost-cutting
moves I ever made, and the six-dollar wage is cheaper than the ﬁve.
How far this will go, I do not know. . . . We cannot calculate exactly
and no one else can, for it is a conjecture, but I would say oﬁhand
that it would take two or perhaps three of the low-priced men to
ﬁll the shoes of one of the higher-priced men. This would mean more
machinery, more power, and a great addition to confusion and cost.

And, where productivity increases faster than purchasing pow-
er, the increased wages do not solve the question of the surplus, of
goods for which there is no market, even though such wages mean
higher living standards while men are employed.

WELFARE SCHEMES

Welfare work has increased under the new capitalism, and
employee representation plans have been developed. Some of these
plans have been of genuine experimental value. Sooner or later, as
Edward Filene has pointed out, industrial democracy is inevitable,“

but many of the schemes thus far in operation have unfortunately.
been developed with the idea of keeping the worker away from the ,

bona ﬁde trade union movement and have led to a paternalism
that is a far cry from industrial democracy. Many corporations,
which, with one hand, install welfare schemes, with another hire
company guards and spies, initiate yellow dog contracts, discharge

36

  ‘ ~ E

 

 

trade unionists, secure sweeping injunctions and call for the con-
stabulary and the militia in time of strike to interfere with the
constitutional rights of the Workers peacefully to speak and to as-
semble.“ Instances, in fact, are few and far between where cor-
porations combine welfare work with trade union recognition, and
enlightened policies in respect to wages, hours and employment.
Mr. Ford, an advocate of high Wages, absolutely refuses to deal
with trade unions and has a policy of hiring and ﬁring medieval in
its nature.

More labor leaders are talking cooperation, and the “B. and
0.” plan and the arbitration and employment agreements in the
men’s clothing industry have their significance.“ More machinery
for the adjustment of disputes is being developed. On the other
hand, many trade unions, with the wiping out of craft lines almost
overnight are facing a bitter struggle for survival.

LABoR’s NEW Tovs

Labor has secured new toys with which to play, automobiles,
radios, and so forth. Workers have lost—many of them—in room
space at home, but have gained in modern plumbing. They have
bought more extensively of corporate stocks, although, according
to the Federal Trade Commission a few years ago, employee holdings
in the average corporation reporting constituted but 1.5 per cent of
the common stock and less than 2 per cent of the preferred.“ A
somewhat later study of employee stock ownership in 20 large
corporations by the Industrial Relations Section of Princeton found
that employee stockholders comprised 21 per cent of all of the
stockholders of these companies, but that their holding represented
only 4.3 per cent of the market value of the total stock outstanding.
(See Recent Economic Changes, p. 490.) They have been a victim
of the speculative mania, although many were fortunately cured
of this disease in the crash of stock in the fall of 1929.

There has been an increase in educational facilities, and a de-

registered in diseases indicative of the increasing strain in modern
life, diseases of the heart, the blood vessels, the kidneys, and so
forth. A person who reached thirty-seven years of age in 1927 had

There has been a slight decrease in industrial accident, although
a considerable increase in such accident in New York States in
1929, and an increase generally in accident due largely to the pres-
ence of the automobile.“ '

LACK or SECURITY

The great loss of the workers under the new captialism has
been, as has been before indicated, an increasing lack of security.
The swift changes in industrial technique, the rapid shifts in owner-
ship and control of industry through our mergers, the early ex-
haustion of Workers in many mass industries, the refusal of em-
ployers to take on workers after forty or forty-ﬁve years of age,
have all made life more uncertain not only for the manual worker
but for the white collar Worker. A minimum of 650,000 more
workers were out of jobs because of technological and other changes
in 1927 than seven years previously, according to the estimate of
Dr. Leo Wolman in Recent Economic Changes." This is the
greatest tragedy of our modern life. The fact that 80 per cent of
the people of the country are now tenants, and may be thrown out
of house and home when unable to pay their rent; that they no
longer have their own home and a garden and practically no food
stored up for the future increases the insecurity of the average

worker and makes his situation all the more tragic when he is

thrown out of a job. And yet the purchase of a home by the workers
who might at any time be forced to seek jobs in other parts of
the country is under present conditions a precarious undertaking.
The new capitalism has not brought security, plenty or freedom
to the worker. Only as the new capitalism evolves into socialism,

increasing numbers are declaring, will these things be attained by
labor.

XII. N‘EW ATTITUDES TOWARD PRIVATE
PROPERTY

N THE meanwhile, the new capitalism is playing havoc with the
I attitude of the consumer——large and small—toward private
property in consumption goods. In thousands of instances a rented
apartment is taking the place of the old family estate among the
well-to-do. The family servants have given way to apartment hotel
employees; the life-long cook, to the occasional caterer supplying
his own linen and silver; the family library, to the loaned books
from the circulation library.

Among the population as a whole, an increasing amount of
worldly goods is either being bought on the installment plan, the
title still being in the hands of the seller, or is being borrowed
for a specified period. Instead of owning things, we as consumers
are getting the use of things. To gain freedom and eﬂiciency, we
are exchanging the burden of possession for use and, as Valeska Bari
declared,

when this and other present-day tendencies have been permitted
to develop a few steps further, we may discover that the undesirable
alien whom we have barred from entrance by the front door has come

in at the side to argue with us the meaning of some of the sacred
words of our economic faith.

“Can the man or woman who is surrounded with borrowed
objects and objects only partly‘/paid for,” asks Bruno Lasker, “have'
the same pride of individual ownership which in the past was
the hardest psychological obstacle to a socialized point of view?
Can the American woman of today have that feeling for her home
that her grandmother had for the unchanging interior of her mar-
ried life? . . . Can a crowded apartment dweller be a collector of
books? Here is the beginning of a revolution in standards of living.”

XIII. IN SUMMARY

HE NEW capitalism in the United States, the capitalism of
the post-war period, has, therefore, been characterized by cer-
tain signiﬁcant features.

1. Separation between Ownership and Management. It has
led to an increasing separation between ownership and control
and an increasing dependence on non-proﬁt incentives among the
managerial staff as a stimulus to maximum endeavor.

2. Combinations and Trusts. Under thepnew capitalism the
merger and combine movement has invaded almost every line of
activity. The development of the chain store in retail distribution
and of the giant corporation in the production of food, in the ﬁeld
of entertainment, etc., are among the signiﬁcant phenomena of
the new industrial era. Concentration of industrial control has
been likewise furthered by the extraordinary development of the
holding company, by the non-voting stock device, by the persistence
of interlocking directorates, by the great expansion of the invest-
ment trust, by the emergence of the billion dollar banking institu-
tions and the chain and branch bankimovements and, ﬁnally, strange
as it ‘may seem, by the wide diffusion of stock ownership among cus-
tomers, employees and the general public. Public regulation has
followed, but has thus far proved absolutely inadequate to protect
the consumer.

3. Change in Corporate Structure. The new capitalism has
introduced new types of corporate structure, both private and pub-
lic and has shown the practicability of the management under
one corporate roof of far larger units of industry than were for-
merly deemed possible.

4-. Invasion of the World Market. Under the new capitalistic
order, America has invaded the markets and the investment areas
of every land and has become one of the great creditor nations of
the earth. Large expenditures for armies and navies have followed

40

>5 r..._...«-...-' an "..A . -.

 

and great pressure has been exerted to engage in imperialistic ven-
tures. ‘

5. Increase in Productivity. The new capitalism, with its in-
creased utilization of electrical power, its ever more intricate and
expensive machinery, its overhead conveyor system, its modern
scientiﬁc methods in laboratory, shop and oﬂice, and its developing
art of labor-management cooperation, has brought about a greatly
increased productivity per unit of labor and for the ﬁrst time in
history has demonstrated that poverty with proper social planning
can be eliminated from our midst. But it has not provided that
planning. We thus still have poverty and bitter economic inse-
curity, as is illustrated by the tragic unemployment of 1930 in the
midst of potential plenty.

6. W age and Hour Philosophy. It has led many economists
and business men to embrace the philosophy of high wages and low
prices. Real Wages have been raised and hours have been lowered,
although not in proportion to the increased productive capacity of
industry or increased proﬁts and thus far more industrialists who
favor higher wages for the workers in other concerns have failed
to apply them voluntarily to their own business.

7. Welfare W ark. The new capitalism has led to the increase
in welfare work in many of the larger corporations, although such
Work has frequently been initiated with an eye to keeping labor
unions from organizing their factories and Welfare work and sup-
pressive measures unfortunately have often gone hand in hand.

8. Continuing Evils. The new capitalism has not solved the‘

question of industrial insecurity but under it such insecurity has
markedly increased. The disparity between the productive capacity
of the country and the consuming ability of the masses is becoming
constantly greater.

The “new industrial era” has not solved the question of waste
in production or distribution, even though the standardization

4«1

 

movement and Taylor systems have eradicated many individual
instances of waste. It has not eliminated the unjust inequality
of wealth. Proﬁteering and. racketeering, despite eloquent talks
about “service,” are in evidence on every hand.

It has substituted among many thousands the “yes men” psy-
chology for the spirit of independence which was once proudly
proclaimed as the distinctive spirit of pioneer America. If one
wishes to avoid economic blacklists, one mustn’t offend the economic
giants of the country.

9. Undermining Props of Capitalism. The new capitalism is,
at the same time, undermining many of the theoretical props on
which the capitalistic order has rested, and is preparing, in various
respects, the psychological soil for a socialistic society. A past argu-
ment against socialism was that it was impossible to socialize in a
particular industry hundreds or thousands of scattered industrial
concerns. The new capitalism, to the extent that it is bringing many
such concerns under one control, is answering that argument. When
the only alternative is private monopoly or public monopoly, the case
for the latter is strengthened.

A former argument against socialism was that administrators
would not do their best in industry unless they were also owners
and were energized by the profit incentive. The new development
in industry under which most of the proﬁt goes to the inactive

stockholder, is exploding that theory, while the exactions of the -

inactive owner are being regarded as less and less justifiable from
a social point of view.

The older economist emphasized the innate strength of the

instinct of ownership among the mass of the people. The new
capitalism, even in consumption goods, is eradicating that “in-
stinct,” by substituting use for ownership in the case of an in-

creasing number of private possessions.

The older economist condemned socialism on the ground that

42

 

"it would not stimulate suﬂicient savings among the people to pro-

vide for future improvement in industry and that capitalistic in-
dustry ensured a happy balance between consumption and produc-
tion. The new capitalism shows that individual savings are not
so necessary as in the past to keep the industrial machine going
and advancing; that corporate or social savings may be increasingly
depended upon for that purpose. The new capitalism demonstrates
that the great present need is not more savings for productive
equipment, but rather more money in the hands of the masses for
consumption purposes. It shows that, in the present intricate in-
dustrial order, an unregulated laissez faire method of investment
under a system of great inequality in income utterly fails to de-
velop a balanced economy and that social ownership and planned
social investment offer the only permanent remedy for insecurity.
An attempt to remedy present day insecurity is almost inevitably
leading to a demand for social insurance, for an extension of public
services, for more steeply graduated income and inheritance taxa-
tion and for a socialization of the basic industries—is advancing
us, in other Words, on the royal road to socialism.

10. Shifts in Population Classes. The new capitalism is edu-
cating millions of young men and Women who are ﬁnding it in-
creasingly diﬂicult to secure remunerative employment in already
overcrowded professions and trades. Many of these are likely to be
included in the “intellectual proletariat” of the future and may be
depended upon to do effective work for fundamental social change,
despite the pressures on all sides toward social conformity.

Recent development are plunging many skilled workers into
the ranks of the unskilled, and though immediately weakening the
trade union movement in many trades, is ultimately laying the basis

‘for a broader labor movement. It is industrializing the South. It

is decreasing the numbers and inﬂuence of the farming class; is rais-
ing the proportion of tenant farmers as compared with that of in-
dependent farmers and is reducing many a farmer to the income level

43

of farm laborers. It is transforming great numbers of independent
tradesmen into salaried clerks for giant chain stores. It is develop-
ing a new capitalistic class of absentee owners whose stake in the

present system is not a business which they have built up, but one

which yields them a stated income. Many of these find it diﬂicult
to oppose a shift to social ownership with the same aggressiveness
as did the promoter-owner of a few decades ago. In fact, a yet
small but increasing number see clearly the injustice of the pres-
ent distribution of wealth and income, and are pledging themselves
to a program of socialization and to the development of a func-
tional society where reward and power conform approximately to
ability and to the worker’s contribution to social well-being.

In view of these various changes, John Dewey is undoubtedly
right in his belief:

We are in for some kind of socialism, call it by whatever name
we please, and no matter what it will be called when it is realized,
[Professor Dewey writes]. Economic determination is now a fact,
not a theory. But there is a difference and a choice between ‘a
blind, chaotic and unplanned determinism, issuing from business con-
ducted for pecuniary proﬁt, and the determination of a socially
planned and ordered development. It is the difference and the
choice between a socialism that is capitalistic and one that is public.

XIV. THE MEANING OF SOCIALISM

Y SOCIALISM, the socialist does not, of course, mean a rigid cen-
B tralized industrial mechanism under which all industry is
owned by the‘ state. He has in mind an evolving social order in
which the principal industries of the country are socially owned
by municipal, state, national or other community units, and by vol-
untary consumers’ and producers’ cooperative, with functional
control and as much decentralization as is compatible with ef-
ficiency.

Under a cooperative order such as the socialist visualizes there
would probably be a residuum of private ownership in handicraft

econi-lae be closely related to the physical and intellectual contribution

of the individual to industry; would the gross inequalities of*wealth,j

ased largely on property ownershi , be abolished; and would it
epossible to establish that social control of investment, of produc-
ion and of distribution that must precede the Wiping out of in-
d istrial insecurity and waste; Only -under such an order, whose

‘primary objective is service, would the aim of industry be attuned to‘
the highest ethical ideals.‘_”

ing to the National Bureau of Economic Research, increased by 650,000 from
1920 to 1927 (Recent Economic Changes, p. 878). Prof. Paul H. Douglas brings
out the fact that, whereas the average rate of unemployment in manufacturing,
the building trades, transportation and mining in the thirty year period, 1897-
1927, was 10.2 per cent, the average rate for the seven years period 1920-6 in-
clusive, was 12.1 per cent, an indication of increasing insecurity (Douglas, Real
Wages in the U. S., p. 459).

National income going to wages and salaries decreased from 64.4 per cent in
1921 to 56 per cent in 1925. However, this, he declares, was still in advance over
the 1899 level of 52.5 per cent (Real Wages in the U. S., pp. 545-6)

The New Capitalism and the Socialist

I, THE OPTIMISTIC ERA

N THE good old days before the Wall Street crash and the ac-
companying period of depression, many of the most distinguished
citizens of this and other lands were proclaiming that America
had entered upon a new national economy, the economy of the new

capitalism, the economy of mass production and distribution, of high .

productivity, of high wages, of low living costs, of labor-capital
cooperation, of continuous prosperity. “Our visitors,” wrote the
Englishman Ramsay Muir, in 1927 in America the Golden, “are
impressed, everywhere and every day, by an evidence of an ebullient
prosperity and a conﬁdence in the future.” Writers in other coun-
tries Were telling the same tales.

At the same time, on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, article
after article was appearing in our leading journals singing paeans
of praise to the new and “revolutionary” changes in modern in-
dustry. Leading business men-—Henry Ford, Owen D. Young, Sam
Lewinsohn, Edward A. F ilene, Samuel Vauclain, among them—
were busy describing the neworder, and their statements were
being ouoted as proof that an advanced .age of human relationships
had at last arrived. “The continuance of good times for the em-
ployed and of general prosperity,” declared President Vauclain of
the Baldwin Locomotive Works, at that time, “depends largely
upon maintaining throughout this land the highest possible Wage

rate that can be paid to those who labor for a livelihood.” “Wages‘

rising, costs falling, proﬁts increasing,” wrote Garet Garrett, in

his article entitled The American Book of W onder, “What the
war did was to cause a wholesale reformation of industrial practice,
under a new type of mentality, thus bringing to pass all at once a
change that had been bound in any case to take place under stress
of competition.” '

 

Herbert Hoover, in his presidential campaign of 1928, joined
the jubilee singers in behalf of the new capitalism of the post-war
period. In his speech of acceptance in Palo Alto, he declared:

Great progress has been made in stabilization of commerce and in-
dustry. The job of every man has thus been made more secure. Un-
employment in the sense of distress is widely disappearing. . . .

We in America today are nearer to the ﬁnal triumph over poverty
than ever before in the history of any land. The poor house is vanish-
ing from among us. We have not yet reached the goal, but, given a
chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years, we shall
soon, with the help of God, be in sight of the day when poverty will
be banished from this nation. There is no guarantee against poverty
equal to a job for every man. That is the primary purpose of the
economic policies we advocate. . . .

With impressive proof on all sides of magniﬁcent progress no one
can rightly deny the fundamental correctness of our economic system.

In his Madison Square Garden address in New York in late
October, he reiterated this point of view:

The slogan of progress is changing from the full dinner pail to
the full garage. Our people have more to eat, better things to wear
and better homes . . . Wages have increased, the cost of living has
decreased. The job to every man and woman has been made more
secure. We have in this short period [seven and a half years from
the 1921 depression] decreased the fear of poverty, the fear of un-
employment, the fear of old age; and these are fears that are the
greatest calamities of human kind . . . Prosperity is no idle expression.
It is a job for every worker; it is the safety and the safeguard of
every business and every home. A continuation of the policies of
the Republican party isvfundamentally necessary to this progress and
to the further building up of this prosperity.

The higher American wage, amounting to a redistribution of
wealth, the apologists of the new capitalism declared in these‘years,
is the thing that “has maintained the balance between output and
consumption of producers’ and consumers’ goods, and has thus pre—
vented the development of the unsound conditions that ordinarily
tend to transform prosperity into depression.” 3 Others were an-

6

 

nouncing that the business cycle had been ironed out, that labor-
capital cooperation had become a reality and that the era of in-
dustrial peace was upon us.

But no sooner had the books and articles in praise of this newly
discovered economic order issued from the press, than the bull mar-
ket which symbolized to so many thousands the ever-increasing
prosperity of the new capitalism was, almost overnight, routed by
the Wall Street bears; the curve in the business cycle again began
to dip, and America was faced with another period of depression
——the fourteenth since 1885.‘

The new capitalism is now struggling hard to gain its former

«momentum, and the hallelujah chorus both here and abroad is

 

somewhat quiescent. In such a time of comparative economic calm
it is perhaps well to take stock and to try to discover what the new
capitalism really means in terms of social advance.

Has the new capitalism, as Mr. Filene here intimated, in a
recent conference on “The Second Industrial Revolution,” elimi-
nated the evils of which Socialists have long complained ?” Are
the post-war developments under the new capitalism likely to delay
or to advance the coming of a socialistic order? These are some of
the questions which students and the general public are asking with
increased interest as the years advance. '

In the first place, I doubt that a careful analysis of the situa-
tion will show that there is as much that is new in the new capitalism
as is often assumed. The tempo of industrial change is probably con-
siderably faster than in the decades beforethe war, but the direc-
tion of this change is not materially different.
