Thus we see that the seven strongest points of the Left
seamen from 1935 to 19b5, became thereafter transformed into
their seven weakest pointso ‘Why did this change happen? The

seamen en masse had not changedo\ Only the leadership they re=
ceived from the Communist Party had changedg

The "report on the Labor Panel" admits:

"We must say quite frankly that the National Committee
bears a certain responsibility for some of these weaknesseso"

‘ But that admission is not "quite frank”, The truth is
that the National Comittee, and especially'Foster, bears en=
tire responsibility for all of these weaknesses which express
the character of Party work in relation to trade unions from
the moment Foster assumed control of the Party. '

The steady process of.deterioration and decline of the
Leftcprogressive wing of the labor movement, has continued
through three years since the Party Emergency Convention in
l9h5o It is not a sound foundation for boasting today about
the Party”s "vanguard role", or the claim to be "among the
firsts if not the very first" among Communist partiesa

In Europe there are many Communist Parties which emerged
after the war as real mass parties, at the head of a majority
of the Working classo Because the workingclass has rallied
around these parties, they exercise a decisive influence upon
the destiny of their countries; 'But they almost all speak
of their role with a degree of real modestys not verbal modesty
which replaces the character with the words There was one ex=
ception, a party whose leaders conspicuously boasted, that of
Yugoslaviao Subsequent events showed this was a sign of a
deeper sicknesso ‘What shall we think of a party leadership
which boasts of being "among the first" when its former'workere
followers are abandoning it en masse?

In the hO=page main political report to the Convention,
one page is devoted to this crucial questions This page is
more empty than even the "report on the Labor Panel", and is
confined to abstract generalizations. Significantly; it passes
on immediately to the Wallace movement as "the_key which the’
progressives in the trade union movement must now seize upon."
(p: 810) .

The'Wallace movement is, indeed, being used by the Party
leaders as a "key" = — but a key to lock up, out of sight and
possibility of examination, the catastrophic situation of the
trade union left wing, not a key to remedying its dismal sit=
uationo If any evidence is needed to prove this fact, we find
it in the "report of the Labor Panel" on this point, There we
read the followings . ,

'"The trade unionists should obviously be the_mae

tion that the new party “marks the beginning of E
the end of the twoaparty system“ if the Comunist
trade unionists themselves are guilty of neglect

the new party 0 , , 0"

These sharp sentences understate the actual situationo
But they suffice to show that the‘W5Ilaoe movement is not im=
proving the situation of the left wing in the trade unions,
and also that the left wing is not improving the position of
the Wallace new party within the labor movement, Each is‘

The accusation of "phraseemongering" thrown against the trade
unionists has a certain validity, however, only because these
trade unionists are copying the practice of the leaders at

THE lhth NATIONAL CONVENTION CPUSA

Section II

In the first Party Convention held since the end of the
war, it would be expected that a characterization of World War
II and its results would be given, as the necessary foundation
for a judgment on the world relationship of forces, and all cona
~ sequent strategical and tactical conclusionso One looks in vain,

however, for such a characterization of the war and its resultss
either in the Resolution or the main political reporto

it

There exists a very precise characterization of the war.
It was given by Staling in his speech of Febuary 99 19b6, as
follows:

"As distinct from the First World Wars the Second
World War against the Axis States from the very
outset assumed the nature of an anti=fascist war '

‘of liberationg one of the tasks of which was also
to re=establish democratic libertieso The entry
of the Soviet Union into the war against the Axis
States could only strengthen a = and actually did
strengthen m = the anti=fascist and liberating
character of the Second World'Waro"

‘Why did the lhth Convention of the CPUSA carefully avoid
saying yes or no to this characterization of the war? Obvi=
ously, this was because the Convention leaders disagree with
this judgment butg for reasons of expediency; wish to hide
this disagreemento This attitude expresses a profound under=
estimation of the progressive forces in the counties of
bourgeois democracy in general, and in particular in the UoSoAo

This underestimation puts its mark upon the entire pr0=
ceedings of the Conventiono In the main political report and
in all discussion, the antiafascist and antiawar camp is den
fined as those forces aligned with the'Wallace new party, and
all others are assigned to the camp of reaction, fascism, and
war to establish American imperialist rule over the worldo
Indeed, the workingclass itself "participates in the responsi-

bility for this betrayal of the cause of labor and the nation" by
tolerating its existing leadership (po788), and can join Wthe

cause of labor" only by establishing a new leadershipo This defi=
nition reduces the progressive antiewar camp to a small minority

in America, and excludes the overwhelming majority of the organized
‘With such a judgment, of course, the strength of the
reactionary, fascist, camp is grossly Qverestimatedo ‘

This is the erroneous political judgment at the base of the
spirit of defeatism that dominated the Convention, This defeatism
is but poorly masked by phrases of shrill defiance against the re=
actionary camp, and by appeals and directives for "unity and strugm
gle" addressed to the'workingclass, with which the Convention re-

'cord is plentifully decorated like raisins in a cake,_ Of course,

if all this good advice was accepted, and the workingclass "united

;~all its forces" on the Rooseveltewallace program, reaction would
'.be defeatedo

But the central problem of the Convention was prem
cisely to answer why the workingclass, long united behind Roosevelt's

2 program by an 8Q% majority, comes to the same program led by’Wallace
. only in a ten percent minority or lesso
gquestion only by citing the blows of the enemy, "the impact of the
. reactionary offensive,"
*;and divide the body of the workipgclass'and drive it into the enemy
~camp, is itself an enormous overestimation of reactionary forces,

and a confession of bankruptcy by the Comunist leaders who make its

The Convention answered this

But to concede that enemy blows can confuse

~The result is that the Convention, instead of examining the

=problem of how unity of the workingclass and the whole progressive

camp can be re=established, intensified the policies and attitudes
which during the past three years have more and more separated_the
Party from the main body of the workingclass. The attention of the
Party and its followers was directed, not toward the reintegration

of the progressive majority camp in the country, but toward the
probable victory of fascism to which the only answer is socialist
Thus, the climax of Foster?s speech, openingTtE5f55nven~
tion in Madison Square Garden, was the following:

"And above all, our Party knows that if American
imperialism, despite the resistance of the peace
forces, should succeed in launching a new world
war, this crime would seal the doom of world capi-
talismo For the outraged peace-loving masses would
then put an end to the obsolete capitalist system
and speed on faster than ever to their inevitable
goal." (p. 776),

r\___ri r 

 

-11..

This formula, often repeated by Foster for three years,
neither inspires the workingclass nor intimidates the reaction»
ariesc It is generally interpreted on all sides, and by the
Party as well, as meaning that there is no practical, effect=
ive obstacle to the march of American imperialism toward world
conquest except "the final conflict", the proletarian socialist
revolution in America, The Party has been given an imediate
perspective of concentration camps, storm troopers marching in
the streets, a full-fledged American version of Hitlerism,
against which it must fling words of defiance but which can be
defeated only when the American workingclass rises up to esta-
blish socialism. ‘ a

It is due to this perspective, still far removed from
American reality, that the Party has been so indifferent to
catastrophic losses of its positions in the organized labor
movement, The trade unions are regarded as playing a reac=
tionary role, unless they are already prepared to accept re=
volutionaryrleadership.

The Convention saw in the advance of reactionary forces
into power an expression of a supposed "break through on the
ideological front" by fascism, If this is more than a mere
phrase, it means that the masses, and especially the working-
class, are supposed to have moved to the right since the end
of the war.= This estimate is false, The political ideas and
moods of the masses are more progressive today than in l9hh,
or l9hO, or 1936. If the reactionary camp is sweeping into
power in America, this is not at all due to "ideological"
victories of fascism among_the masses,‘ It is the result,
rather, of the atomization of progressive leadership, the
splitting up of which has opened the gates to the enemy, If
the enemy is relatively stronger, this is mainly because it
has concentrated its forces, while the progressive camp has
permitted itself to be split by feuds, factions, and personal
ambitions of rival leaders and groups. Give the progressive
camp a united leadership (and this is not a Utopian aim, since
it recently existedz), and it would quickly be stronger in the
country than ever before.

This basic political fact was hidden, ignored, even denied,
by the lhth Convention. Thereby the Convention grossly overe
estimated the forces of the enemy and underestimated those of
the progressive camp. Thereby it presented the central tasks
of the movement in a distorted form,

 

-12-

The Convention was unable to formulate the task of uniting
the progressive majorityo The reason for this was, that it did
not recognize the existence of such a progressive majority. It
i could not recognize this majorityis existenceg without recogniz=
E ing the Partyﬁs own errors which contributed to and hastened the
I fragmentation of progressive leadershipo Because it had to ex=
plain its own loss of mass influence, not by its own errors but
as the victory of fascist "ideology" = u even over many of its
own members and fomer closest alliesﬁ =“= it could not possibly
recognize the existence of a progressive majority in the countryo
That is why the Convention came to the formula, expressing its
false estimate of the relation of forces: The progressive camp
is the Wallace movement; all else belongs to the camp of reactions
fascism? and'waro For the Convention, the progressive camp has
been reduced to a small minority and is still shrinkingo

I?

‘While'exaggerating the "ideological" victories of fascism
in America; the leaders of the Convention spoke much Ofg and
based themselves upon, the increased postawar strength of the
USSR and the countries of new democracyo This latter view;
insofar as it dominated the thinking of the Conventiong was its
helthiest aspecto Howeverg it is not an accident that the Con~
vention failed to note and to refute the idea, which the reacw
tionary camp propagates in a variety of forms as one of its most
effective weapons among the American masses, namelyg the idea
that only American help to the USSR enabled it to survive Hitlerﬂs
attackg that the USSR could not have won the war alone@‘

The failure of the Convention to answer this reactionary
propaganda weapon is all the less understandable, since the CPUSA
had given the strongest and.most effective answer to this canard
in the course of the war itselfo But after the Warg when Foster
had taken Party leadership into his handsg the Party fell silent
en.this question and has not spoken of it sinceo It received no
answer in the lhth Conventiono

' The reason for this silence is that during the war Foster»
was very pessimistic about the position of the USSR9 he expected
Leningrad and Moscow to fall to the Nasisg and he was as.surprised
as the bourgeois "experts" at the victory of Stalingrado And
Foster has never been known to admit an errorg except the "error"
of failing to stubbornly insist upon his own ideaso He will not
admit he was wrong on this question, even indirectly by stating
the correct position, until he is forced to do soo In the lhth
Convention no one could force anything on Foster; he was the un=

conditional boss. The result is that the CPUSA receives no edua
cation whatever upon the basic strength of the USSR demonstrated
in war, except that which comes from abroad. The ideological
campaign of the reactionaries goes unanswered,

The sae reason contributes to the Partyﬂs failure to dism
cuss Stalinﬁs estimate of World War II as "from the very outset"
an anti-fascist war of liberatione From the beginning of the
war until l9h2, this question acutely disturbed the Party lead:
ershipo Foster and his chief theoretician, Bittleman, held that
there were two distinct and simultaneous wars, one between the
Axis States and the AngloeAmerican alliance which was purely
imperialist, not differing in principle from World War I, and
the other, between the Axis and the Soviet Union, which was a
liberation war on the side of the USSRo American Communists,
they said, must utilize the conflict between the Axis and the
AngloeAmericans, but must resolutely continue to affirm that
it remains purely an imperialist struggle on both sides, and
the capitalist Western States cannot under any conditions play
any progressive and liberating role, even conditionally and
within defined limits, ‘When the Party rejected their concept,
and decided that Roosevelt“s war policy made it possible to ins
elude America in the concept of a coalition of anti=fascist
States which, as a whole, played a progressive and liberating
role, Foster and Bittleman took up a diplomatic silence on this
issue thereafter, but never admitted that they had changed their
original judgmento

This was not then an "abstract" issue without very impora
tant practical consequences, nor is it now, During the war, .
this difference of concept gave rise to constant difficulties,
One of the sharpest examples occurred at the height of the war,
during the Battle of the Bulge, when the Germans threatened to
break the.AngloeAmerioan lines and drive to the channel, which
would have brought a collapse of the Second Front in the Wésto
In that very period, a mass strike movement was rising in
America, spearheaded by John Le Lewis, which was further shake
ing American morale at home as well as at the front, and'was
being exploited by prowfascist advocates of a separate and
negotiated peace with the Nazis,

That was a very critical moment in the'war° The fact that
Stalin took it serously is recorded in the notes which passed
between him and Churchill at that timeo (See "Falsifiers of
History", supplement to "New Times", Moscow, N098, Febol8,l9h8).

iV""IIIiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-F-f""""‘—”

Churchill sent an urgent note to Stalin, saying the Anglo-
American position was very dangerous, and asking for action in
the East to relieve it. Stalin answered that weather was un=
favorable, and plans for an offensive had been made for several
weeks later, when the weather-would improve, However, Stalin
said, in View of the extreme urgency of the Angloakmerican posia
tion, the Soviet command was advancing the date of the offensive,
and carrying it out under the most unfavorable conditionso When
the Soviet offensive took place, a few days later, it forced the
Nazis to transfer several divisions from West to East, and enabled
the hardepressed Anglo=American armies to prevent the threatening
5 break=through. It cost the USSR many extra thousands of lives,

’ but clearly it was in the joint Anglo=Soviet=American interest.
If the war was worth any sacrifices at all, clearly it demanded
sacrifices at that momenta '

In the American labor movement, however, there were pqwer=
ful leaders developing a strike movement, who refused to give
any consideration to its threat against the‘Western Front.

John Lo Lewis was aligned with the "America First" crowd, and
against American participation in the war under any circumstana
ces. He was joined at that time by the Social~Democrats, fore
merly the most extreme agitators for war, because they were in
rebellion against Roosevelt's partnership with Stalin, and would
rather lose the war than win it jointly with the USSRo

The left Wing, inspired by the‘Communists, joined hands with

the MnrraynHillman center group to oppose resolutely the spread ‘
of the strike movemento But it had to overcome the most stub=

born opposition of Foster, who wanted it to go along with Lewis

‘and the Social-Democrats in unloosing the mass strike movemento

Even after he was decisively overeruled, Foster addressed a

large mass meeting in Chicago, in terms favorable to the strike

movement and compromising the left wing positiono Only by re=

doubled efforts was the strike movement held in check until the

military danger had passedo Fosterﬁs role at that moment reu

flected, in general, his fundamentally anarcho=syndicalist ten= \

dency, and in particular his complete misunderstanding of the %
nature of the war,

, There is, of course, nothing original in the FostereBittleman
theory that the United Nations alliance masked two simultaneous
Wars of a contradictory charactero It is a specific variation

of the old Trotskyite "theory of permanent revolution", which,
since-the war, under Foster's leadership, has deeply penetrated

 

— 

-15-

the CP cadres in various forms, Foster always had a weakness
for Trotskyite theories, and in 1929 was publicly rebuked by T
Stalin for his Trotskyite alliances, Even when he is formally
combatting the Trotskyites, he shows no ability or inclination
to combat their theories, It is not an accident that during
the three years of Foster9s leadership of the Party there has
been a plague of semi=Trotskyite groups and theories spring up
among the membership,

‘ The CPUSA misinterpreted the manifesto of the Nine=Party
Conference which established the Cominform, as a_be1ated cone
firmation of Fosterﬁs position, But the characteristic feature
of that manifesto, in sharp contrast to Foster's war hysteria
and empty threats of "revolution" as the answer, was its calm
and confident assurance to the workingclass and peacemloving
masses of all countries, that they hold the power to enforce
peace and eradicate the remnants of fascism, Foster cannot
see or understand this strength of the progressive camp, this
favorable relationship of forces, Therefore, the Convention
he controlled and guided could not work out for America the
tasks laid down by the Nine=Party Conference,

Foster relies upon frightening the masses with the threat
of war, in order to drive them into the antiewar camp. He re=
lies upon frightening the bourgeoisie with the threat of revo=
lution, in order to drive them away from the reactionary war
program, ‘With both these phases of his tactic, however, he
merely plays into the hands of the reactionaries, and achieves
his ostensible aim in neither caseo

The lhth Convention, therefore, gave little help to the
American workingclass in penetrating the false pretenses of
the Marshall Plan, and exposing the inner contradictions and
ultimate bankruptcy of the present American bi=partisan reac=
tionary foreign policy, It permitted the clear and simple
outlines of the world picture, which discloses the unconquer=
able position and growing strength of the democratic camp in
world affairs, to remain obscured by abstract formulae and in~
terminable chatter about secondary matters, It masked the
clay feet of the American imperialist collossus m = the con»
tradiction in which it adds new weaknesses with every additional
ally (Chiang in China, Greek royalists, Spain9s Butcher Franco,
the Ilse Kochs and Hjalmar Schachts of Germany) and by crude
domineering even outrages and undermines its bloodabrothers of
the British, French and Italian reactionary bourgeoisieo

.15..
The American workers should be told, in simple concrete

language within the comprehension of all, about the weakness
of the American reactionary policy. Above all, the myths and
illusions surrounding the atomabomb, as the "trump card" in in=
ternational relations, the "irresistible weapon" which makes Amer=
ican reactionaries "supreme" in the world, should not be unthinka
ingly repeated, but exposed as the fakery they are, torn to pieces
and discredited, by constant repetition of the simple facts, that
the atomabomb is more dangerous to America itself than to any other
country, that even reactionary military experts admit, among theme
selves, that the atomebomb is mainly a "psychological" weapon, a
bluff; that even if it remains an American monopoly (a dangerous
assumptionl), it is more than offset by more deadly weapons of mass
destruction equally available to the USA.and the USSR; and that a
speculative'World War III could not possibl end in victory for
either side by military meansﬁ

The new relationship of forces in the world, that came out of
World War II, renders impossible a military decision of the dism
putes and differences between "East and West" — = that is, between
a reactionary capitalist USA and the socialist USSR, and the camps
lined up with the two world powerso ' ’

That is the fact that shatters the dreams of an all=conquerm
ing American world empire, of an "American fascism", ’This fact,
stark and simple in its main outlines, within the comprenhension
of the broadest masses, should be the main ideological weapon of
the regathering of the progressive majority of Americans, to take *
the destiny of our country and the world out of the hands of the ‘r .
reactionary minorityo . -

But the lhth Convention of the CPUSA shut its eyes and turned
away from the road to unity of the progressive majorityo It stubs
bornly marched toward more complete isolation from_the body of the
organized workingclass, consoling itself that it is at least gain»
ing a radical middleuclass mass party, But even this illusory gain
is slipping like sand.through the fingers of these blind leaders,

THE lhth NATIONAL CONVENTION CPUSA

Section III

How did the lhth Convention judge the strength of the
‘Wallace movement? ‘What perspectives did it indicate for the
new party"s future? ‘What did it have to say about the relar
tionship between the labor movement and the new party, and its
future course? And what role did the Communists assign to
themselves in the new party?

The Convention gave contradictoy answers to all these
questions; it stood firmly on both sides of each debatable is=
sue,

"The rising might of the new peopleﬁs anti=monopoly party
and coalition", declared the main political report, is so great
that the American ruling class "is losing faith in the possi=
bility of governing effectively by bourgeois=democratic methods,"
(po783). ‘That is, indeed, a claim of very great strengthﬁ But
later on, in listing the tangible alignment of organized forces
(p.800), it cautiously claims only the narrow left wingo

"The new party is shattering the deadIy two=party system",
it is claimed (po775 and numerous other places), This means
that the new party'will emerge from the elections with a vote
comparable, in some degree, with the major parties, and as a
finnky consolidated major political factor in the country; it
either means that much, or it is altogether a meaningless,
demagogic phrase. At the same time the Convention saw’ the re»
actionaries making "alarming advances" (p.786), "to check and
defeat" which, "is possible a = if labor adopts an independent
class position", which it explains, labor has not done because
"we were able to influence only a.minority in the CIO = =
albeit a sizeable and influential minority = = and only very
negligible forces in the A. F, of L," (p,787)o The condition
of the "labor and progressive movements" is one of "division,
"confusion and backwardness", (p,789). Thus the promise for
a bright future for the new pariy is made conditional upon
something happening, which is not happening now, and which the
Convention can predict, not upon measures being undertaken to
bring it about, but by some miracle of "spontaniet 9"

"To halt the drive toward fascism and war, the new peopleﬁs

coalition must be led by the workingclass and its most class=
conscious sector"; said the Convention (po790)o‘ This is laid
down as an axiom, repeated in innumerable variationso But the
actual condition revealed in the "report on the Labor Panel"

is that only the left wing unions support the new party, and
these with many hesitations and'weaknessésr that it is difficult
to get even the Comunists to be really active: and that the new
party is "overwhelmingly nonolabcr" (ioeog middle class) in its
leadershipo The Convention had no explanation of why this is S09
and no directive as to how to change it n = except; of courseg
the empty and inevitable exhortations that "it must" be changedg
apparently by the exercise of pure willapowero

What role was outlined for the Communists in the new party?
Two differentp and opposite; answers were given by the Convene
tione “They are brazen liars who charge that the Communist Party
is trying to dominate the new party", declared Fcster (pc7?S)o
"We Communists have no desire to Ftake over? the new party; nor
could we if we would"& echoes the more softaspeaking political
reporto Butg on the other hand, the new party "must be led byoco
its most classaconscious sector" (P9790); "the American working
class» and especially its Communist vanguard, mustooogather around
itself all patriotic and democratic elementsoooand give it (the
new party) fighting wprkingclass leadershipo" (Po ?92)° Obvin
ouslyg the ambiguity of this doublenanswer solves no.problemso
The non=Communists in the new party9 worried about how to regue
late their relations with the Communistsg are not interested in
quibblesg in clumsy exercises in "semantics"o Instead of an
answer to their legitimate questionsg they are merely told to
stop worrying ("Nobody in this henahouse but us chickens2“)c
The problemg which requires a full and frank discussion, putting
all cards on the tableg and reaching a practical. working relau
tionship, is dismissed as not worthy of a real answerc

The Convention thus entangled itself in ambiguities; be=
cause it was unable to face up to this question fully and franklyg
not having clarified the problem in its own thinkingc It had forn
gotten the basic attitude established 100 years ago by Marx and
Engels: that in matters of program and political discussion; the
Communists have nothing to hide or dissemble, that "the Communists
disdain to conceal their aims"; that they can unite and work with
all progressive parties and groupss honestly and loyally, upon a
mutually agreed basis and programa

Behind this issue of "leadership" (or "domination"), which
is only a surface problem, important though it_is, there is inn
valved a mch deeperﬂ programmaticﬁ issueo Wallace and his none

Communist associates wrote the platform, the program, of the
new party, It is well—known, being the program of Roosevelt
(except the new plank for nationalization, to be discussed
separately), around which the progressive majority of the nae
tion had been rallied for years. It is a "reform" program,
explicitly affirming the continuance of American capitalismo
It is"anti=imperialist" — a but onxy in the collo§Ei5l:§33se=
veltian, sense of opposing the reactionary camp's plans of
aggression and conquest, not in the sense of proposing a new
foundation for American policy; it is "antiemonopolist" ~,=
- but only in the same sense, ‘ ’

The Communists, however, give these terms another meaning,
that which is contained in Marxist=Leninist theory, which says
that in an advanced capitalist country, like America, imperial=
ism and monopoly are inherent in capitalism itself, and can be
abolished only together with capitalism, by the establishment
of socialism, ‘In the Marxist=Leninist sense, antiaimperialist
and antiemonopolist are fundamentally antiecapitalisto e

When‘Wallace°and the Comunists agree upon an "anti~imper-
ialist" and "anti=monopoly" party, they are, therefore, agree»
ing only in words but not in their meaning, not in the real subs
stance of a program»

The Communists could have dissolved this ambiguity. The: >
‘Convention could have explained that the Communist program, '
Marxism-Leninism, holds that imperialism and monopoly can be
fully defeated only by the establishment of socialism, It
could have made clear that the new party and Wallace stand for
quite a different program, of "reform" which leaves intact the
basis of American capitalism (which is imperialist and mono=
polist by natur)o ‘It could then point out, that it supports
the‘Wallace program, as‘Wallace understands it, quite simply
and honestly, because the masses are not ready to support a
socialist program, and this is the most advanced program upon
which there is the immediate possibility to unite the majority,
This program, with majority support, is adequate for the immee
diate purose, to prevent war and avoid the worst economic
crisis that threatens, and since the Communists want to avoid
‘war and crisis also, as long as possible, they quite honestly

such a broad coalition, with a nonwcommunist (nonesbcialist)

1 //'" The lhth Convention did not do thiso ‘Instead, it deepened
‘ the ambiguous relationship that has arisen, and reduced it to a
»'5J system, Thereby it intensified all suspicions and strained re=
/ lations in the new party, and reduced its effectiveness for the
election and afterward, to an immeasurable degrees

\ The Convention declared: "A new initiative is necessary on

L the part of the advanced workers to widen the Progressive Party's

‘ trade union base and to heighten laborﬁs political leadership and
influence within the new party," (po803),

By what means is this to be done? By an intensification of
the very policies which have already resulted in narrowing down
p the new partyis labor base, isolating it from the main body of
3 labor? By making the new party also a new battleaflag in the
rightaleft split in the CIO, a split which was threatening to
I become complete even before the new party appeared? The inevim
E table result of such a “new initiative" is already seen, in the
f ‘ United E1ectrical'Workers Convention (UE), the leaders of which
' withdrew their expected endorsement of Wallace on the grounds
that it would "split the union wide open"$

! ' In July, before the new party and the CP held their conven-
H tions, the Wallace movement was strong enough in the trade un=

A ions to bring from the dominant leadership announcements that "
they would not support any candidate for President, that they

3 ‘would, as the saying goes, "sit on their hands," But after the

: Ccnventions,the right—center leaders were no longer afraid of

1 the Wallace movement, They boldly came out in support of Trumane
That was the result of the "new initiative" of an old policy
that had already failed, It is not very helpful to proclaim
that "labor must not only endorse and give general support to

the Progressive Party" (po803), if the proclamation results only
in former supporters drawing back from final action, and labor
generally coming out more strongly than before against the new
partyo

3 "In this connection", sas the main political report, "it
is appropriate to comment on the remarks of a leading new party
spokesman“ (this meas'Wallace3) "to the effect that if we Come
munists really wanted to help the new party, we would run a com»

uch a step would lose the new party 100,000 votes, and gain
it 3,000,000," (p,806).

The coment that follows is most remarkable, in that it
does not even attempt to refute‘Wallace*s statement of fact,
except to Call it "queSti0nable"o- It merely declares that the
Communists have their own reasons, independent of the size of
'Wallaeeis possible vote, for not acoepting'Wallace3s suggestion,
This despite repeated statements, in other contexts, that “it
is essential, obviously, to bend every effort to achieve the

- maximum number of votes" (emphasis in the original) for the new
partyo (po803)o

. No attempt is made to refute'Wallace?s judgment on this
question, obviously because it is irrefutable, because it cora
responds to the actual situationo

The situation in l9h8, insofar as this narrow issue is
concerned, is closely comparable to that of 1936, At that
time the judgment of the GP was, that Roosevelt must be as=
sured the maximum number of votes, that Landon must be de=
feated at all costs, Precisely for that reason, since an en= ;
dorsement of Roosevelt by the CP would have cost him 20 times §
as many votes as it gained him, the GP put its own ticket into
the field, and made a campaign designed to strengthen the Roose=
velt positiono

In l9hh the position was quite differento By that time, the

Communists had a long record of cooperation in the general pro=
~ gressive camp, the broad left wing was firmly united and in

working alliance with broader organizations, and had reduced
its lifemandndeath feuds within the labor movement to a minimum,
It could directly endorse Roosevelt, without seriously weakening
him, but on the contrary consolidating and raising the fighting
spirit of the whole mass movement, It did so, and Roosevelt,
while making a pro forma declaration that he did not invite
Communist suppo?t:5E5v€?theless did not even hint at the
thought, which Wallace has bluntly spoken in 19b8, that "if
the Comunists really Wanted to help" they would run their own
tickett And Rooseveltﬁs running—mate, one Harry Truman, answers
ed the issue with the flat declaration that the Party welcomed
all voters without distinction of their affiliationso

If the policy of the CP was really guided by the aim of
the maximum number of votes for Wallace, then it would have
tried to establish the conditions of l9hh before endorsing him,

or, failing this, would have named its own ticket, as in 1936, ‘

___#,.. f

?/campaigning in such a manner as to give him maximum help. The

,, course that has been followed means, obviously, that the aim of

‘ a maximum number of votes is, for the GP, subordinate to the aim
of direct Communist participation in the Wallace organization.

How completely the Convention leaders misjudge the relation

of forces in the labor movement and in the country as a whole,

may be illustrated by a very practical example. The main politi-
cal report forecast that "the proponents of the new party'will un-
doubtedly make new united front approaches to the pro-Roosevelt
Democrats among the electorate. Many of these, including certain
candidates" (my emphasis) "will now be more ready to arrive at
agreement with the new party."

Following out this judgment, the new party Cwith‘Wa1lace ex-

pressing his disagreement publiclyl) offered its support, early
in October, to a group of outstanding progressives on the Demo-
cratic ticket. But, contrary to the forecast, those candidates

. were not “more ready" for agreement. They spurned the support :
which was offered, with hostile statements. The movement for i
“more unity" resulted only in adding bitterness to the split, and ?
demonstrated more weakness in the new party's position. The move
which, in the beginning of the new party movement, could have added
much strength to the Wallace campaign, came too late in October, '
and had the opposite result. ‘Wallace, the "impractical idealist",
had;judged the reality more accurately than the "hard-boiled real-
ists"; he had favored the move in the beginning, and opposed it in
‘octoberi '

f , The new party in its program made one innovation, one depart-
ure from the familiar program of Roosevelt. This is the proposal Q
to nationalize the banks and insurance companies, and the steel, ‘ i
railroad and mining industries. This is indeed an important issue,
and calls for a fundamental judgment of the historical moment in '
America. For, unlike many programatic issues, this one is good
or bad, true or false, not in general or for long periods, but
only in very particular conditions and relationship of forces.

The ihth Convention hailed this innovation as the "heart" of
the new party program, with a minimum of discussion._

The main political report correctly warned, in words closely
following the classic teachings of Marxism-Leninism, that "demands
for nationalization which are advanced irrespective of time, place
and struggle" have the result "to breed illusions and play into
the hands of demagogues" - - "or even assist in the process of fas-
cization" .... "serve today to promote...the accelerated growth

      

.s-v.-on-.....:-.v.o..-...,.... ._ .... ~..._...._.._,_. - ._ ____

=23=r
of state monopoxy capitalismo"
Having laid this correct premise, the report proceeds:

"Contrariwise; the struggle for nationalization of the .
basic industries and the banksg when integrated with the struge
gle of the workingclass and its allies for a democratic people“s
goverrmxent, can reinforce the peoplevs mass movementmoit can
advance the struggle of labor and people to higher levels and
in the direction of socialismo"

This is a complete non sequitor; the conclusion has nothe '
ing whatever to do with the premiseo After warning that "timeg ;
place and struggle" (that is, particular relationships of power)
determine whether nationalization of industries is progressive org
on the contrary; only "promotes the accelerated growth of state
monopoly capitalism" and "even assist fascization“9 the concluu
I sion is drawn ("contrariwise"3 indeed£)5 that since the nation=
Q alization demand is “integrated” in the new party program? and
' that is a program of struggle, this proves it is correct? the _
warnings do not apply to our situation? and that nationalization
is the "heart" of the antiefascist program in Americao

It would be hard to find a more glaring example of ideal=
istic thinking in politicsg of abandonment of the basic princi=
ples of Marxist=Leninist political thoughto

A program of nationalization is progressive when the con-
ditions of "times place and struggle" are such that the working—

’ ‘ class and its allies are approaching, or have already reached,
1 the point of taking over the state power = a as in most of
5 Europe todayo It is progressive'when; by being applied under
‘ conditions of capitalismﬁ it results in further weakening the
t power of the reactionary camp, and puts new obstacles to a rem
storation of that powero It is progressive when it installs
: a new peoples? political force into fields hitherto under the
undisputed sway of the monopolistsg and ousts the old ruling
class and its representativeso Therefore, the statement that
existing conditions call for a program of nationalization as
the "heart" of the mass movement against the monopolistsg is
equivalent to declaring the existence of a major political
; crisis, in which the old order is tottering, and socialism is
5 on the order of the day,

But the CPUSA has repeatedly stated? in the declarations
§ of its National Committee plenary meetingss that it does not
‘ put the transition to socialism on the order of the day in

 

America, It justified its support of the Wallace new party,
with its pro—capitalist program and its leadership by a mil~
lionaire, on the grounds that socialism is not the issue today,
True, the lhth Convention proceedings do not repeat this judga
ment, in specific terms, but surely the assumption is justi=
ﬂied that such a tremendous change would be made openly, if

at all, and not smuggled into a Convention program under cover
of an ambiguous declaration on nationalizationé

Under existing conditions in the UoSaAo3 those basic cone
ditions which would not be changed even by the election of
WEllace as President with a supporting new party majority in
Congress, the carrying through of a program of nationalization
of banks and basic industries would have the result of strength-
ening the power of the monopolies, of giving them the means to
harness the new party government to their charioto

The inclusion of the nationalization demand in the new
party program is, for the new party, merely a practical mis=
take which will be soon dropped, since the party is far from
united on it, But the endorsement of this step, as the "heart"

"of the program, by the lhth Convention of the CPUSA, is a much

more seious matter, It reveals that the present leadership
of the CPUSA is more than clumsy and incapable in practical
problems of the mass movement; it is also illiterate in Marxa
ist~Leninist theory, it is able to recite accurately from the
text books but has no understanding of their meaning, or of

' the relation of theory to the problems of the everyday real
~worldo '

The main political report to the lhth Convention accu~
rately states that;

"The U.So monopolies, with their swollen ‘
profits and increased productive capacity,
face a relatively restricted home market
-and a shrinking capitalist sector of the
world. Their 'solution' is to embark on
an aggressive program of imperialist expan-

."Millions‘who-fear mass unemployment and

its unanimous endorsemento They were unable to fight it, bee
cause the Party to which they looked for guidance, had armed
them with no arguments that could effectively counter the ad=
'rocates cf the Plano

The “error” of the Gomunist vote for the Marshall Plan
was not9 and could not be, explained by the lhth Convention,
because the Convention was not prepared to remedy the basic
failure of the Party which caused the erroro

The fundamental problem involved in the fight against the
Marshall Plan may be briefly reastated as follows:

American econom enormously expanded its productive forces
during the war¢ But the domestic market has expanded far less,
in proportion, and available foeign markets are more limited
than before the were Therefore the basic factors making for

-"economic crisis are more powerul than they were just before

the 1929 crasho Since it is not possible, under capitalism,
to solve this disparity by expanding the domestic market to

~absorb production, the American_econom is faced with the alw

ternative, either to greatly expand its foreign markets by one
or another means, or to accept the inevitability of an immi-
nent shattering economic crisis of unprecedented severitya
American economy must produce for the world market or collapseo

‘ There are two possible answers (short of socialism) to
this problem of markets for American surplus production, a re=
actionary answer and a progressive answer.

The reactionary camp proposes a "solution" throughg(l) an
enormous armaments program; (2) the Marshall Plan subsidy of
exports for a transitional period; (3) utilization of the first
two measures as a means to gain control over the rest of the
worlds transforming it into a semiacolonial marketo

The progressive counter-program would answer the problem
£1) elimination of armaments as rapidly as possible; and
avoid any reliance upon them as an economic factor; (2) expand
U¢So exports by credits nd subsidiess to equal the full amount
of exportable surplus productions elmminating the Marshall Plan
aggressions against the sovereignty of other countries and all
political discriminationss trading with socialist and semi=

so

socialist lands on the same conditions as with capitalist
ones; (3) cooperation with all democratic forces in the
world to assist in the modernization and industrialization

‘of all lands, abolishing colonialism and all forms of domi=

nation of one country by another,

The progressive program was projected by Roosevelt,
and became the foundation of his foreign policy, in which he
realistically expected friendly collaboration with the Soviet
Union, This program has been continued by'Wallace, and the
new'party,

But the Communists, and the left wing that follows their
ideological leadership, are "boycotting" this phase of the
new party program, They refuse to discuss it openly and di=
rectly, but they make it very well known by other means that
the Communists consider this is one of the "unsound" features
of the'Wallace program, an essential phase, in fact, of
Wallaceﬁs concept of a "progressive capitalism"‘which the
Counists openly repudiate. .

In terms of political realities, therefore, the Comunists
occupy the ambiguous position of supporting and participating’
in the new party, uniting with it to attack the Marshall Plan,
but rejecting its answer to the Marshall Plane Since the only
answer to the Marshall Plan in addition to that of Wallace, is
to propose the imediate transition to socialism for America
(and this the CPUSA has repeatedly declared is "not on the or=
der of the day" *), therefore the Communists and their left
wing allies stand without a countereprogram, and when asked
‘what, practicalky, shall be put in the place of the Marshall
Plan, they stand mute without an answer,

* (Footnote) For example,'the eport to the National Comittee
meeting of Febe 3-=5, 19h8, published as a pamphlet under the
title "The Third Party and the l9h8 Elections", said (peh5)s
""Such a (Wallace new party) goverment on the American scene
oo.would not yet pesent it with the task of breaking the rule
of the monopolies and thereby effecting the transition to
socialisme"

 

 

 

-23-

This failure of the lhth Convention (and for three years
before) to answer the problem of markets, is the most impore
tant single programmatic reason for the collapse of its ef-
forts to give the Wallace movement a broad trade union founda-

_tion. (There are other, nonaprogrammatic reasons, of course,
9

even more decisive, which are discussed in other connections
It is the decisive reason why the CIO was able to send James
Carey to Europe on the mission to bring a crisis in the‘World

-i:“'Federation of Trade Unions, on the issue of the Marshall Plan.

The CPUSA is thus falling between two stoolso. It does
not bring forward, advocate, explain, and fight for the pro=
gressive camp"s alternative program to the Marshall Plan; but
neither does it advance its own distinctive solution of a
socialist transformation for America, It stands on this ques-
tion in’a political vacuum e = a very uncomfortable and poli—
ticallyaunprofitable position, especially since this issue is

If the central point of all current‘world political developments.

if-}*

A characteristic feature of the lhth Convention is the
absence of any systematic examination of the countryls economy,
or of any part of the field of economic problems. What is _r
said on_such questions is always a remark."in passing", "by the
way", obliquelyo But some of these passing remarks reveal an “
extreme carelessness with the facts, that expresses lack of un=
derstanding of what these facts mean. "t

For example, the main report speaks of "the rapid maturing
of the first postewar cyclical crisis of overproduction", al=
though in vague and general terms, But it then proceeds, on
the same page (782) to declare: "While the production of weapons
of destruction increases, there is a steady decline in the pro=
duction of means of production for peacetime purposes, as well
as a critical shortage of many consumers" goods.”

Now if the reporter had been seriously attempting to estaba

plish the “rapid maturing" of a crisis of overproduction, he could

not have avoided the fact that, since the end of the war, there
has taken place an enormous increase in the production of means

of production, at”a rate higher than ever befoe in peacetime,

and not the “steady decline" of which he loosely speaks, If there

 

-2 9..

were actually a “declineﬁ, the maturing of the crisis wouldv

be less rapid = = it is precisely the rise that speeds up the
crisis. Similarly, he would have found, not a "critical short=
age" of consumers? goods, but the accumulation of inventories
on an unprecedented scale, another main feature of the "rapid
maturing" of the economic crisis of overproduction.

Such carelessness with facts, such loose thinking, run
through the whole report, and are not confined to the remarks
on economies, like a thread - - not a "red thread" a = that
marks the absence of MarxistaLeninist theory and understanding»

-X-*-*

The rfusal of the lhth Convention to put forth the pro=
gressive counter=program to the reactionary Marshall Plan, is
a specific example of a general tendency of the Party leader=
shipe‘ This tendency is to mechanically copy the attitudes,
positions and even the phraseology, of European Communists’
without consideration of "time, place and struggle,"

European Communists, because they operate in an immediate—
ly revolutionary situation - — the period of transition to:so—
cialism = 9 are necessarily firm against all proposals that
would restore capitalism to power, and-against all theories
that capitalist measures are "progressive" as opposed to their
movement toward socialism. The CPUSA crudely and mechanically
copies this attitude and approach in America, where the choice
is not between socialism or progressive capitalism, but between
extreme reaction and the Roosevelt progressive program = = a
situation in which the CPUSA itself does not propose the immea
diate socialist choice»

But the present leaders of the CPUSA do not understand
that what is "progressive" in America may be “reactionary” in

_Europe, (and vice versa), and they rject such a distinction"

of "time, place and struggle", branding it as a manifestation
of "the theory of American exceptionalismo"

The situation, therefore, calls for a review and re=exame
ination of the whole history and scope of the Party“s struggle
against the theory of "exceptionalism", which it undertook in
1929 under the initiative of Stalino '

W"??? $.

The "theory of exoeptionalism" was developed_in l927=1929
by Eovestone and his group, who then held the leadership of
the cPUSAe This theory declared that the unique featues of
American development, distinguishing it from other capitalist
countries, had freed this country fom those "las of motion"
which Marx had discovered in capitalist society, that America
was an “exception,”

On this basis Lovestone predicted, in 1928, a year before
the great economic crisis broke out, that America was entere
ing an Wage" of sustained_posperity, analogous to that en=
joyed by the British Empire in the 19th centuyat He said that ~ —

L? even as Britain°s glorious era had been called the "Victorian
age", after the.ruler under'whose reign it began, so Americals
would be called "the Hooverian ageo"

L when this "Hooverian age" revealed its reality, a short‘
time later, in the form of "Hoovervilles" of unemployed mil=
lions, and the world economic crisis found its deepest ex=
pression precisely in America, this "theory of exceptionalism"
collapsed, died, and vanished almost without a struggleo
Therefore, the detailed examination and discussion of this
theory was soon permitted to lapse, and it remained in the
consciousness of the Party rather dimly, as the discredited
label "American exceptionalism." '

“opposite” only in the sense of being the opposite side of the

The full anti¥Marxist character of the theory of excep=
tionalism cannot be understood, until the essential identity
of its two "opposite" sides has been grasped, America cannot
escape from the laws of motion of capitalist society as a
whole; it cannot find an exceptional road of development inde-
pendent of, not determined by, those laws. .Neither can Amer—

through. Marxism—Leninism teaches us that there are "leaps" in
history, sudden qualitative changes from a lower to a higher
stage of historical development - - but that all such leaps have
been thoroughly prepared by the accumulation of thousands and
millions of small unobserved changes which are the true motive
force of history. There are no leaps in real life which are
merely the product of human "will=power" - - or fantasy.

Marxism, in.rejecting unconditionally the "theory of Amer-
ican exceptionalism", by no means denies, or slides over, or
underestimates the practical importance of every specific fear
ture of America which makes this country different from other
countrieso

It is nonsense, not Marxism, to deny or ignore the fact that
among all capitalist powers in the world, gmerica'was an "excep-
tion" in emerging from the war stronger than before, all others

being weaker, and none retaining full rank as "first class powers."

It is nonsense, not Marxism, to deny or ignore the fact that
only America, among all capitalist powers, is still capable of con-
ducting_an independent world policy, that it is "exceptional" in
this respecto .

It is nonsense, not Marxism, to deny that America alone, as
an "exception", gives continuing force and viability to the shrink-
ing world system of capitalism.

"Exceptionalism", as an anti=Marxist theory, does not arise
from recognizing and drawing far=reaching conclusions from such

‘"exceptional" facts'~ = not any more than “nationalism”, as an

anti=Marxist theory, arises from a full recognition and defense
of the nation. ‘

The American Communists have the task to become more truly
American than they are, before they will be able to become more
truly Marxists=Leninists than they are, They must learn the spe-
cific and concrete problems of the American working class, before '
they can successfully rally that class in struggle for great goals.
The lhth Convention, unfortunately, did not represent another step
toward that goal, but rather a step backward,

.I- The lhth Convention failed to face and answer the issue—of‘

trade union.unity5 even as it failed to answer the problem of ~

the Marshall Plan.

VIn previous Party Conventions, from the time of the rise
of the CIO, the problem of trade union unity was a major pro= ;'
blem, but only in the form of the CIO-AFL split and how to‘

tbridge its The lhth Convention was confronted, however, with

new splits all along the line =.= all of them unfavorable to,
and seriously'weakening, the Left Wingé " ~ 1- .'-.; g

The most serious of these new splits are:

a) The splitting away from the Left leadership of impor=
tant sections of-the membership, which had in the_past followed
the Left most loyally, in good times and-bad. ‘Such mass deser=
tions of the Left leadership in some cases involved the majority

of former-Leftmsupporters, as in auto (U£W),vamong the seamen

(NMU), and in transport (TWU)o .In other cases they were of suf=
ficient volume to shift the balance of power from Left to Right
or Centero. Everywhere they seriously weakened the Left forceso

b) -The splits within the leadership of the progressive
coalition; the split between the Communists and the Center
group, some Left leaders splitting with the Communists and
joining the Center, and the splits among the Communists theme
selves (attaining major proportions in the NMU)o

These developments make the problem of trade union unity
a major and daily problem, at all levels and all phases of
trade union lifeo Local union branches face the sharpest pro=
blems of maintaining their unity, and from there the problem
reaches out into all higher levels of trade unionism; and pen=
etrates all phases of the general progressive movemento Unity
is becoming the allapervasive, universal problem of trade union

* life, because everywhere it is threatenedo

How did the lhth Convention evaluate this situation, and
what measures did it adopt to remedy it?

 

 

-33-

First of all, the Convention grossly underestimated the seri-
ousness and depth of the problem. _TtM§aw only a series of indivi-
dual "setbacks in some aspects of our trade union work" (p.372;
emphasis by the present’ﬁriter)e It showed no signs of recogniz-
ing that a basic deterioration had_taken place in the position of
the Communist-led Left Wing, endangering its very existence as an
independent effective force in the general labor movement» The
facts of this basic deterioration, and the resulting danger,,are
glaringly obvious, but the lhth Convention shut its eyes to their
meaning. It reduced the scale of the progleE:*fr5m its true pro-
portions as a crisis in the relations of the Party to the working-
class, to the distinctly lesser one of setbacks in some aspects“
of trade union lifeg

 

Further, the Convention dismissed any question of wrong
policy on the part of the Communists having played any role in
worsening the situation, as unworthy of discussiono "The main
reasons were a number of objective factors", it declaredo Five
such factors were listed, as follows:

1; "The impact of the general offensive of
American imperialisma"

29 "The anti-Communist hysteria and ‘red-baiting'°"

39 Defection of "the former Center (Murray) forces
in the 010, who broke the Left-Center coalitiono"

he "Capitulation" by former allies, and "betrayal" ’
by Left-wingers (naming Addes, Thomas, Curran,
Adelman, Quill, Eckart, Stone, Merrill)o

50 "The increase in the number of workers — - es-
pecially of young workers"aog"with a resulting
temporary watering-down of union consciousness,"

(p» 872%

Now, it is necessary to note first of all, that only No: l
and N03 5 of this list are in reality "objective factors" in any
sense; the other items relate entirely to the "subjective" situa-
tion inside the labor movementa But even the two really object-

ive factors cannot in any way explain "setbacks" to the Left
Wing, since their natural-effect, unmodified by some unfavorable
"subjective" influence, would strengthen the Lefty not weaken it,

 

-35..

Examine the first item. The reactionary American bour-
geoisie conducts a fierce attack against the labor movement.
The Left'Win grows weaker under the blows ("impact") of
this attack, according to the theory of the lhth Convention.

But why should this happen? Should not a general attack _

upon the I§5or movement cause the Left Wing to grow stronger?

These blows represent the sharpening of the class struggle. V
Wh does the lhth Convention present the questions, in the ”
form that the sharpening of the class struggle automatically

explains why the Left'Wing is becoming weaker, is suffering

setbacks? The very foundation of Marxian theory is that the

Left grows, and can only grow, under the "impact" of sharpen-

ing class struggle. But the lhth Convention insists upon

another theory, that the sharpening of the class struggle is
angﬂobjective factor" decidedly unfavorable to the growth and
consolidation of the Left Wing and, in fact, need only be

cited to explain satisfactorily'why the Left Wing suffers

most serious loss of influence in the working class.

This is profoundly false and revisionist. As an "object-
ive factor" the blows of the enemy can explain nothing but an
advance of Left'Wing strength; if, instead, the Left Wing de-
clines, then this proves that the explanation must be sought
in subjective factors, in wrong policies and practices of the
Lef ing an its leadership.

The same analysis applies to Item No. 5, in the lhth
Convention's list of "objective factors". The Left Wing be-
came a power in the American labor movement precisely by its
superior ability to organize hitherto-unorganized workers - -
"especially young workers" — - and to make of them the best,
the most reliable, fighters. That was how the CIO was built,
and that is why the Left became such a power within the CIO.
That is how things should be expected to be: That is the
nature of the Left'Wing1 ‘Why is this now suddenly changed?
Why can the lhth Convention, quite simply and without expla-
nation, describe the presence of "new" workers, "especially
young workers", as an "objective factor" unfavorable to and
weakening the Left Wing? If the Left has not forgotten its

own proved skills, forgotten the whole history of its rise
as a power within the working class, then it must see in the

new workers, and especially the young workers, the natural
basis of the growth and extension of its power. Again the
lhth Convention is found to be thinking from false, anti-

Marxist and revisionist premises.

 

» §.ﬂs%._..,.3Z.,,.s; .

=3 6:,

Analysis of the other three "objective" factors cited by the
Convention {which are obviously really subjective factors), reveal
them as simply variations of the two already examined, 'Wh should
"red baiting" now “explain” why the Left Wing declines? For 12
years the CPUSA was able, with constantly growing success, to dis=
credit and defeat the "red baiters" within the labor movement, as
well as those who attacked the labor movement from outside, ‘When

V wasqthere a more ferocious period of "red baiting", for_example,
' than that of the San Francisco general strike, and-the events

  

leading to the rise of the CIO? ‘What more relentless red baiter
did the bourgeoisie ever put forward, than General "Ironpants"
Hugh Johnson, key man in Roosevelt's first official family, head
of the National Recovery Administration? ‘When was there a.more
intense and general antiacommunist hysteria than that of l939=hO,
‘when America supported the projected lnglo~French military expem
dition to Finland against the Soviet Union? Yet in those most
difficult times the Party, with only a fraction of the material
and human resources which it had in l9hS, defeated the red baiters,
consolidated its forces, and emerged not only without serious
loss of positions but even with many gainso

Upon what grounds can it be contended that workers who joined
the Left Wing during previous storms of anti=Communist hysteria
and redsbaiting, who stayed with the Left loyally in good times
and bad, should now be deserting the Left because of a new storm
of red=baiting? The "explanation" simply does not explain. If
these workers now leave the Left'Wing and the Party, it is not
because of redzbaiting, but because the Party has failed to hold
their confidenceo

‘What, further, is the true significance of item No, 3, of
the Convention's list of “objective factors"? The breakaup of
the Leftmcenter coalition was doubtless a heavy blow, a big
setback. ‘Why could not the Left maintain this coalition? ‘It
‘was the Left which played the decisive role in building it; the
coalition was founded on the growing strength of the Left, The
Left=Center coalition began to disintegrate in l9h5o Its dis»
integration was caused by the demands of the Left for more de=
cisive authority in coalition councils at a moment when its
support among the mass membership was decliningl The breakmup
of the Left=Center coalition was the result, not the cause,
of the "setbacks" of the Left'Wingo "_"_” =23‘:

It is equally false to try to fix the cause of the split,
in the divisions around the Marshall Plan and the'Wallace new

.=,37.=

partyo The split was taking place long before the Marshall
Plan or the new party emerged, and these issues were the
convenient occasions, not the cause, for deepening the split,
On the contrary, it is more in accord with the facts to say
that the Center group aligned itself for the Marshall Plan
and against the new party, because it was already engaged in

' a life=and=death struggle with the Left, because the split was

already taking place, and because on these issues the Left had
demonstrated its inability to rally the masses, it had shown

C «itself as.vaciIlating and unsure, and unable to put forward

and fight for a program which the masses could understand and
support. '

In such a situation the Center (by the very fact that it
is a "Center" ad not a “Left” group) could not possibly has
been expected to take a course other than the one it did, that
is, move to the right and deepen its split with the Lefto The
Left could have maintained the coalition, on a “left of center"
platform, only by maintaining the preconditions for such a
course = a namely, a left=ofacenter countereprogram to the
Marshall Plan and a left=of=center balance of forces in the
labor wing of the new party, "When the Left, after long and
serious vacillations, swung overnight and.without convincing

its own followers, to an intransigent extreme Left position on

these issues, the split inevitably deepenede

we come, then, to item N00 h on the Conventionﬁs list of
"objective factors" causing the decline of the Left'Wing, that
is to the "capitulation" and"betrayal" of individual leaders
formerly associated most closely with the Left.

The names of the Centrists Addes and Thomas are, for ex=
ample, symbols for the situation in the United Auto‘Workers
(UKW)¢ Yes, Addes and»Thomas have capitulated = = but the
Convention failed to note the fact and draw conclusions from

.it, that they capitulated after, in full alliance with the

Communists, they had lost tﬁe majority of their supporters
among the Union membership, after an unsound policy (joint
product of Addes, Thomas, and the Communists) had resulted
in the desertion of a majority'of their followers to thenﬁa
camp of Reuthero It is this mass desertion that is signi1i=
cant and from which lessons must be drawn; the capitulation
of Addes and Thomas is only an incidental result.

The other names on the list are those of men of the Left,

 

,-.._l, _...._.-—.r¢ ‘

' ".1 J';x.Qiw&;Z1Lfj, 3- ..~-

who were hitherto always identified more or less closely with the
Left. They are men who, witnessing the debacle in the UAI, and
threatened.with similar developments in their own unions, one by

‘one and under the pressure of developments which the Left leader-

ship offered them no policy or perspective to successfully handle,
but instead gave only a leadership of military comand, broke away
from the Left_to seek another course. -'

Is this phenomenon correctly and adequately described by the
epithets of "betrayal" or "capitulation"?

It is true, of course, that in a period in which the Comun-
ist Party has fallen into confused, ambiguous, and false policies
and practices, such a moment will be seized by false friends and
weak members as the moment to capitulate or betray. But it is not
true that everyone who rejects the Party leadership in which £535
have lost confidence is thereby, ipso facto, a traitor.

The CPUA went through such a period in 1927-1929. At that
time it was Joseph Stalin who directed our Party to the way out
of the swamp of opportunism and unprincipled factionalism into
which it had wandered, and put it on the highway to a fruitful
15 years of progress. Speaking of these problems of the break-
down of Party_authority at that time, Stalin said:

"...The authority of the Party must inevitably
suffer in the pyes of the workers, and'the'work-
ers, instead of flocking to the Party, are com-
pelled to quit the Party ranks. And that is what
we are now observing in the American Communist
Party."

It is often the "best" workers, Stalin pointed out, who find
themselves "forced to leave the Party."

Our present Party leaders claim that it is only the worst
elements, capitulators and betrayers, whe have rejected their
leadership. They claim that all who have left them, have done so
in order to pass over into the camp of imperialism and the Marshall
Plan.

This is the kind of half-truth.which serves to cover up and
justify a dangerous falsehood. It is false to describe the mass
desertions of Party following as a movement to the right of these
masses, as capitulation and betrayal. It is false to say that_all

 

-39-

 

leading figures who went with these masses, against the Party,ﬂ-al
are traitors. It is therefore only a half~truth, which covers ﬁéﬁ.
up falsehoods, to speak of these developments only as capitulaéfff
tion to the enemy, because in truth they do disrupt the fight "
against the Marshall Plan;

The seamen of the NMU, who repudiated.the Party leader;
ship in a general membership ballot by a ratio of S to 2, after"'
loyally following the Party for many years, were certainly not'=»
moved by the slightest desire to capitulate, or to support the C‘
Marshall Plan, Indeed, during the moments they were turning
against the Party, they witnessed Party spokesmen voting in
the CIO Convention to endorse the Marshall Plan; they read aru
ticles in the Party press3 written by members of the Party‘s
top committee, defending this action, They have never been
given an explanation of why that vote, and the articles de-
fending it, were wrong; they have never been offered the pro-
gressive counter~program:to the Marshall Plan!

"While the seamen were thus, by the actions of the Party, ,H
comdused.on the Marshall Plan, they were, however, quite clear {I
that they could not accept the Party's practical guidance in ‘
the inner life of the NMU, that the tactics of Party spokes-
men in the Uniong actively supported by the Party, were
intolerableo This is because the Party, while it vacillated.
on.the Marshall Plan, fought without vacillation to remove
Joseph Curran from the union leadership — — an aim which a
big majority of the members, including many Communists, to-
tally rejected: The fight against the Marshall Plan was
bogged down, so far as the seamen were concerned, by the vacil-—
lations of the Party and its entanglement in the factional
fight against Currano

The situation in the NMU is only a sample of the general
condition throughout the CIO3 and the labor movement in general;

T The lhth Convention deceived itself and the Party, when

i it washed its hands of any responsibility for the disintegra-
tion of the great Left Wing movement? and put the blame upon
individual "capitulators"5 "betrayers"§ and "agents of Wall
Street in the labor movements" It multiplied this great error,
when it tried to pass its own_responsibilities in this question
over to the working class as.a‘whole, when it declared (p;788);

"The working classy to the extent that it tola

';~'¥'lLQ5=

erates such leaders and their policies, pars.
ticipates in the responsibility for this be- -
trayal of the cause of labor and the nationo" ,

The arrogance of this dictum, that the working class itself
is betraying the cause of labor, is a revelation of the basic
\ cause for the decline of the Communist-led Left'Wing.n It is an
extreme example of what_Lenin described as "Communist conceit",
of "superiority" and condescension toward the workers, an atti-
intude whose end result is the attempt to set-up a system of
military command over the workers, instead of uniting and guid~
'ing the workers on the basis_of consciousness and conviction.

to the American'workingclass, but very.little guidance. ‘Tﬁat

SECTION VI

The lhth Convention raised the slogan "For the Mastery of
Marxism". It listened to ‘many exhortations on the importance
of theory. The fact that it failed to apply Marxist theory to
the most important questions before it, has been exposed and
examined in previous chapters. How, then, did the Convention
propose to master Manclsm?

Foster, theoretical and practical leader of the Party
since 1915; explained the question as -follows:

“In our Party", he said, “we have comrades who
are well-developed theoretically; the trouble

is, however, that our theoretical work has never
been organised. 0‘! theoretical questions we
l(1ave8wo;~ked planlessly, on a hit and miss basis."
Pe  e

This simple statement is very informative and illuminating.
Since llarxist theory is a guide to action, and the action of
llandsts is the expression of their theory, it means that all
the work "of the Party is "on a hit and miss basis". That means,
in short, that the Party’ is guided by grgatism - - a char-
acteristic American "theory" the centr po of which is the
exclusion of theory from practical affairs.

What did the lhth Convention decide to do about this un-
satisfactory state of affairs? It approved a remedy which
Foster explained he had discovered, a decision to "set up a
theoretical commission in the Party."

Foster explained: "This is the first tine in the history
of our Party that we have had such a commission." That. is
true. There is no shadow of doubt also that here the OPUSA
is "thefirst" among all Communist Parties in the world! Here
it is not merely a matter of being "nongthe first". lever
before did a Comaunist Party conceive the task of mastery of
Marxism as one to be referred to a "theoretical commission"
and solved as a problem of organization.

This wonderful new American invention, as Foster explained
it, is composed of a series of "sub=commissions" to which are
assigned "very practical" as well as "deeply theoretical" tasks.
Since the parent of these "sub=comissions" is itself a "sub=
commission"_of the National Committee, its offspring should, in
strict accuracy, be known as "sub=sub=commissions", (Inasmuch
as the "merit" of these bodies derives from their removal of
theoretical questions from the scene of operative leadership,
the further the better, we may expect the later appearance of
"subnsub-sub-commissions" 8).

Foster mentions only two of these subucommissions, one to
prepare a history of the Party and another on "women's work",
Regarding the latter we are, surprisingly and as an exception,
told of the theoretical content of its work, presumably as a
sample for the whole of this elaborate organizational set-up.
Foster describes it in the following words:

"I shall mention only one more of our theoretical sub—
commissions, This is the commission on women's work. Undoubta
edly, as regards theory, our Party is weak on this question.

It is a very complex matter and for us presents_many unsolved
problemso The sub-oomission is going to tackle some of them,
especially the illusion of male superiorityo Undoubtedly our
Party, in spite of our position for full equality of women

with men in every field of activity, is afflicted with false

and harmful conceptso Of course, the general population is
literally saturated with them, The comission on women's work
will try to throw some light on this important question, and the
men in our Party are going to have a goingaover on this matter
in the near future."

In this system of "theoretical subacommissionsﬂ and sub-
subacommissions, with a content as explained in the above-
quoted paragraph, we have been given without doubt the oharacteru
istic mark of Foster as theoretical and practical leader of the
Partyo It measures with considerable accuracy the level to which
the Party has been brought by this leadership,

The "very practical" function of the "theoretical commis-
sion" in the lhth Convention was, to serve as explanation why
the Convention was not asked to discuss and define its attitude
toward a multitude of unanswered questions of theoretical Signi-
ficance. Since a "theoretical commission“ had been established,
it must be given time to prepare a "report", say in a year -Va

It is typical American pragmatismo Marxist theory; referred to
the "theoretical comissionﬁ for some later "study and report"9
is thus disposed of for the times but its absence leaves a
vacuum which is immediately filled by bourgeois theoryo

In earlier sections of this analysis of the lhth Convene
tiong we have been dealing with specific examples of this gen=
eral processo Thuss the Convention could not wait for a re=
port from its "theoretical commission" before approving the
theon that sharpening of the class struggle is an "objective
factoﬂ unfaorable to the Left‘Wing9 which causes masses of
'orkers to desert its leadershipo Upon this theory the Cona
vention based its whole attitude to the most significant de=

' velopments in the labor movements Perhaps; in coming yearsg
the "theoretical commission" may correct this false anti=
Marxist theory; and keep it out of the Party textbooksa But
meantime it is the false theory which is the guide to action
for the Party9s daily works i

The lhth Convention refused to bring forward, explains
and fight for the progressive countereplan to the Marshall
Plans In this it was moved entirely by a theoryg a theory
which had not been examined or discussed in any ways a theory
which has not been refered to the "theoretical commission“
for a repoto The theory is that, since it is wrong to speak
of "progressive capitalismﬁg and since the progressive counters
program to the Marshall Plan would, if adopted, make America
(a capitalist nation) progressive in world affairs, therefore

     

4:1‘-

it is wrong to even imagine there could be any other policy than
the Marshall Plan, unless and until America.goes to socialism.
This theory has been the cause of the Left Wing being sent un-
armed to fight against the Marshall Plan, and thereby the cause
of the Left capitulation, when it voted in the CIO Convention to
endorse the Marshall Plan. But the lhth Convention refused to
correct, or even to discuss, this wrong theory. It was taken

"as given“, without examination, just as the theory of "objective
factors“ weakening the Left‘Wing had been swallowed. In the meane
time, there is no serious struggle being conducted against the
Marshall Plan in the labor movement.

The Convention could not avoid noting the revival of Trot-
skyist tendencies in America, and their penetration into the
ranks of the Party. It condemned by name some groupings which
expressed these tendencies inside the Party, when they took the
form of factions against the leadership. But the Convention
conducted only an organizational, not an ideological, struggle
against them. It failed to explain what is wrong with their
ideas, what are the roots of their errors, why they arise just
now. It could not conduct an ideological struggle, because
these groupings take.as their starting point the conceptions
and attitudes of.the Party leadership itself, and demanding

Athat these be carried to their logical conclusions. Because

 

the Convention was unable to re-examine its own preconceptions,
it was further unable to conduct an ideological battle against
the neo-Trotskyists.

The same paralysis of the faculties for self-criticism
prevented the Convention from facing and answering the crisis °
that exists in the relations between the Party and organized_
labor. It is certainly difficult to reconcile the great Lenin-
ist concept of the Party as vanguard of the workingclass with
the present situation in which masses of workers, after followa
ing the Party'loyally for years, are-deserting, turning their
backs upon the Party, and'blunderingly trying to find their own
road. But the Convention, in its "planless, hit and miss"
fashion, could not even admit that the crisis exists. It spoke
much, and loudly, of its_"vanguard role", which it performed in
‘the fashion of milita comand, issuing orders to the workers
ad condemning as 5tr§¥tors“ 511 who disobey those orders. It
entirely overlooked the fact that the tasks of the vanguard
include listening to the masses and learning from them; it any
tirely forgot that the vanguard must be able to persuade,_to
convince, to win the confidence of, the masses of workers - -
that without this ability it ceases to be the vanguard.

 

 

-15--

It would be incorrect to say that the Convention engaged
in no self-criticism. It did speak of weaknesses in the Party's
work in the labor movement. But, in its "hit and miss‘ fashion,
it found these weaknesses only in the form of insufficient bold-
ness, audacity, and unrelenting firmness in pressing to the end
those very policies which the workers had rejected, and which
were the cause of the Party's defeats. It refused amr self-'
criticism for the refusal to listen to the workers, to learn
from them, to accept their decisions democratically arrived at.
It refused any criticism for the repeated violations by Com-
munists of the most elementary rules of trade union discipline.
and orderly behaviour.

In this pattern of errors and failures, and the stubborn
refusal to criticize or correct them" in any way, there is to
be seen the clear outlines of the Trotskyist concept of “van-
guardism", which is the deadly enemy of the Harzdst-Leninist
concept of the -Party as the most advanced segnent of the work-
ingclass, which leads the whole class by vir-the of the confi-
dence and love wHIcE it has won by its practical services in
everyday life. That "vanguardism" which tries to exercise
the leading role of the Party by means of arbitrary authority,’
by military command, inevitably leads to a profound split be-
tween the Party and the workingclass. And that is what is
taking place in America at the present time.

This question is the most inmediately practical, as well
as the most ‘deeply theoretical. It goes to the root of the
Marxist theory of history, of the role of the class struggle,
of the workingclass as the bearer of socialism, of the trade
unions as the fundamental phase of the rise of the working-
class as an independent force in society, ‘of the preparation
of the workingclass to assume the ruling power, to defeat the
bourgeoisie, to replace capitalism with socialism.

Marxism-Leninism equally and completely repudiates both
of the false concepts of socialism which,‘ on one hand, see it
as the spontaneous and automatic product of the mass organiza-
tion of the woP£ers and, on the other hand, as being imosed
331; the . workingclass by the authority of an elite vanguard.

It is the very essence of llarxist-Leninist theory, which
met be repeated and explained again and again and again, that
the Party of socialism, the vanguard, must adapt itself to the
living and powerful mass movement of the worliers, the organized

THE lhTH NATIONAL CONVENTION

OF THE C, P. U. S. A.

AN EXAMENATION OF THE RECORD.

The magazine Political Affairs for'September, l9h8, pro-
vides l7h pages of stenographic reports of speeches made in the
lhth National Convention of the Communist Party U,S.A.o. The
careful study of this record confirms the previous judgment,
made on the basis of fragmentary newspaper reports, that the
Convention failed to define or answer the most important prou
blems facing the American workingclasso The Convention dealt
with a multitude of questions = = but not the most important
cneso Above all it gave no answer as to why the CPUSA has,
during the past three years, lost a large part of its mass fol-
lowing among the workers of the most important industries, why
it has lost the initiative in the organized labor movement, and
why the Wallace movement is moving rapidly toward a collapse of
all its early promises. ' A

The Convention seemed to be quite unconscious of its fail-

urec ‘It showed no doubts, uneasiness, or'misgivings as to the
present trend of developments in the workingclasso On the con-
trary, it was smugly self-satisfied and even boastful of its
"achievements" a - the word it used to denote a record of three
years continuous losses of one position after another among the
workers. The Convention supported the claim, voiced by'W, Z.
Foster, to be "among the first, if not the very first" Commun=
ist Party in the world to give a clear answer to the problems
of the postawar'world, It cited its claim that "delegates
from 3h Communist Parties", early in 19b7, mistakenly rejected
the correct leadership offered them by Fostero It claimed
that the Nine—Party Conference of September, l9h7, belatedly
adopted the course long-urged by the CPUSA, and could make no
corrections in American Communist policy. "Quite the reverse",
declared Foster, "the decisions arrived at by the Nine-Party
Conference affirmed the correctness of our line," In brief,
according to the record under examination, the CPUSA has, in
time and before all others, given the line for the world Com-
munist movement,_and finally brought all its parties into line,
Foster is thus "among the first, if not the very first" Cdmr
munist leader in the world. (See pp, 823-82h).

In a blind fumbling for a way out of this contradiction,

the lhth Convention displayed clear signs of beginning to think
of the Wallace new party as a party in transition to socialism,
transferring the main emphasis from its imediate tasks to
these speculations about such a future, Thereby, while sacri=
ficing what could be immediately gained through the new party = =
if it were expanded to its full potential, instead of being cone
tracted to a.minimum sectarian scope = = the lhth Convention at
the same time gave freedom of development to the most opportun=
istic illusions, It thoroughly masked the true nature of the

‘Wallace new party as, in program, composition, and leadership,

. the American counterpart of the "third force" parties in Europeo
The lhth Convention could not understand this, because in Europe
the "third force" is reactionary, while in America it still had
the potentiality of plaing a progressive role a e and the thinka
ing th§t—§EI33d—the Convention rejected such distinctions of
time, place, and the stage of the struggle,

Thus was hidden the important fact that the "third force"
in Europe is reactionary because there the task is the immea
diate transition to socialism, which the "third fore" opposes,
But in America the "third force" (or "third party") still has
progressive potentialities because the chief immediate tasks
still remain those of such character that they can be accomp
plished within the framework of capitalisma ‘When the immediate
transition to socialism becomes the chief task in America, here

‘ also the "third party", in its dominant radical middleaclass

; — section, on the whole will pass over to the side of reactiono

{ ‘ The sharp difference between the "third party" in America and

5 the "third force" in Europe is in essence, therefore, a reflec=
tion of the different respective stages of the class struggle
on the two continents.

V By refusing to face and clarify this problem, the lbth-
Convention not only intensified all its immediate practical
errors, which lead to a rapid narrowing down-and isolation of
the whole Left cap, but it also loosed a flood of opportunista
ic illusions about finding a cheap and easy way to a mass party
of socialism,

It was pure self—deception when the Convention relied, as
its weapon against such illusions, upon its "escape clause" to
the effect that the Communists disagree with the "progressive
capitalism" concept of the "third party"o This cliche, this
stereotype, is not an answer to but an evasion of the issue,

It was the greatest failure of the lhth Convention, that

THE 1111'}! mnomt convmmou CPUSA

SECTION VII

The lhth Convention report contains much talk but very
little factual information on the state of the Party organi-
zation. There is but one‘ definite statement which is capable
of analysis by reference to previously established facts, viz.:

"During the three-year period since the Emer-
gency Convention, our Party has’ grown from a
membership of 52,82h]to over*60,000." (p.838).

. Both these figures are questionable on the record. The
Emergency Convention recorded a membership of 80,000, not
52,8224; and a few dqs before the lhth Convention opened the
present membership was announced as 56,000 (this figure was
published in Pravda, Moscow, as well as in America).

At the Emergency Convention it was established that the
191.6 membership registration amounted to. 67,000, to which was
added 13,000 members _on leave in the armed forces, or a total
of 80,000. No explanation is offered as to why this figure
is now reduced by more than one-third, nor indeed is there any
supporting material whatever for these or any other figures.
In the absence of any explanation, the most favorable interpre-
tation is that a new basis for measuring the membership of
three years ago and of today has been meanwhile put into ef-
fect, but this is pure conjecture.

What is always most important, however, in the Party's
vital statistics, is not the absolute figures but rather the
direction of development which they disclose from year to
year. 4'1"-herefore, if these figures are founded in some ob-
jective measurement, and are not the product of deception,
they will reveal the basic facts of growth or decline, even
if in a distorted fashion. We will therefore provisionally
accept the unsupported statement given to the lhth Convention,
as having an objective foundation even though it is a differ-
ent one from that used at the Emergency Convention, and pro-
ceed upon that basis to analyze the dynamics of Party member-

ship over the past 18 years.

The following table, covering the eight years before World
'Iar II, is constructed on the basis of data published in offi-
cial Party Convention and National Committee Meeting reports:

CHANGES IN THE VGUME OF MEMBERSHIP OF CPUSA.

At Beginning of Total Increase During Percentage

the Year of: Membership Previous Year. Increase.

1930 7,500 ’
1931 8,339 839 11 Z

1932 12,936 h,597 55 Z 5 ”
1933 16,81h 3,878 30 %

193h 2h,Soo 7,686 b5 %

1935 30.000 5.500 22 %

1936 h0,000 l0,000 33 S

The average annual rate of increase over the eight preawar
years, was-thus almost exactly one-third, or 33%. Since this
is figured-each year on the increased numbery by geoetrical _. i a
progression (like compound interest), the membership was multi-
plied by ten times in eight years.

The first war years constituted a period of fundamental

readjustments of organization, during which statistics are in- 2 ~f '
complete and not comparable with those of 1930-1938. Over 80% E
of the Party's organizational cadres were inducted into the Arm,
and had to be replaced by comparatively-untrained substitutes.
Nevertheless, by l9h3 relative stability had again been achieved,
and the whole intervening period is summed up by the registration
early in l9hh, which showed 53,000 members, plus about 13,000 '
in the armed forces, or a total of 66,000. Continuing the above
table, then, we arrive at the following: ..

l9hh 66,000 9,000 loss durb 2% per yr.
ing 6 yrs.
19h5 80,000 lh,O00 increase 20% inc.

At this point the continuity of the table is broken by the
unexplained reduction of the l9h5 figure (in the statement to
the lhth Convention) from 80,000 to 52,82h. This drop of 27,176
me be the result of adoption of a new base of measurement, or

 

 

-51-

it may be a deliberate revision of the previous figure on the
grounds that it was inflated (although the two sets of figures
were compiled by the same apparatus, composed of the same per-
sons), And there are two possible ways to .continue the com-
parison, first to disregard the "revision" of the figures and
treat it as a loss (a membership asset "written off" as "worth-
less"), ‘or, second, to deal with the new figures as a new series
with a different base and, therefore, comparable only as to trend
md not as to absolute figures. These two different methods give
the following two different results: 0

First Method:
1915 80,000 V -
19148 60,000 20,000 loss during 3 yrs. 10% per yr.

Second Method:

19145 52,321: _
19148 60,000 7,176 Incr. during 3 yrs. h% per yr.

These figures reveal that if statistics are’ taken without
revision there is a decline of 101 annually since 1915, while if
the new figures are taken at their face value there is an in-
crease of h% annually.

In either case, however, the fundamental trend stands out
clearly: The Party has lost its normal capacity for Jggowth.
Even when we accept the most Tivorable interpretation possible,
we obtain the following comparative dynamics‘ of membership:

. For 8-year pre-war average, 33 5 increase.
For 19104, ‘last full war year, , 20 5 increase.
For 191:5-191:8, 3 post-war years, )4 5 increase.

Comparing prej-war with post-war, that is to say, the Party
has lost seven-'-eighths of its recruiting power; comparing 19141;
with 19145-191:8, it has lost four-fifths of its recruiting power.

* -I- * ‘I-

  

   

.52..

As against_this loss, there was registered in the lhth Con-
vention a tremendous expansion of one phase of Party work, namely,»
the collection of money. In the report on organization, we read:

"A high point of Party activity was reached in the

Spring of l9h7, at the time when the late Secretary

of Labor*Schwellenbaoh, proposed the outlawing of

the Party. In answer to this attack our_Party raised

a fighting fund of $250,000 in less than 25 days. In

fact, more than $1,000,000 was actually raised by the ..
Districts.” (p.835). "Our Party again appealed for

a $500,000 fund to fight the Mundt Bill, and the mem-

bership responded, even though it had just carried _€ 3
through the Party-Press Fighting Fund Drive." (p.836)._

 

There is no reason to doubt that the two cited instances are
characteristic of the whole past two years, that the Party has re-
ceived an abundance of finances beyond its previous most optimistic
dreams, that the masses expressed their abhorrence of the anti-
Comunist hysteria by the most-liberal donations of money.

‘This positive aspect of the mass defense of the Party has been

accompanied, however; by a very negative development, which has a

heavier political weight. There has_occurred a very obvious shift

of the center of gravity in Party activity, ay from the self-

activity of the membership and branches and away from tEe'worEing- ‘
cIass, in the direction offthe aotiviﬁy of the Tull-time paid ‘ ’

aparatus of Party functionaries, which has expanded man-Told,
an n e’ rec ,on o the ra cal middle class.

In other words the Part ‘is in the recess of losin its
basic character as a'woFEIngc§ass Party.

This growing dependence upon its middle-class supporters
reflects, as does the loss of most of the Party's recruiting
power, the influence of the crisis in the relations between the
Party and the trade unions, the split between.Socialism and the

' mass labor movement.

The lhth Convention record is filled with evidence of this
fact, and with feverish appeals to change it - - but no indication
whatever of how it can be changg_.

Among the most serious symptoms of deterioration of inner-
Party life has been the rise of a plague of small factional
groups, mostly of a semi-Trotskyist character, during the past
three years. The lhth Convention mentioned some of these by
name, and proclaimed an organizational war against them. But
it gave no political analysis of their significance. And the
Convention concealed the extent to which this disease has pene-
trated the Party, and concealed the fact that the weapon of
expulsion is practically the sole weapon with which they are
comhattea.

During the past three years there have been thousands of
expulsions frm the Party, unquestionably many times more than
in the entire previous 26 years of the Party's existence. There
was no report and examination of this question, however, in the
Convention.

This phenomenon goes to confirm the conclusion, indicated
by many other factors, that the decline of Party authority in
the labor movement has been accompanied by a decline in the
Party authority among its own members.

In the attempt to stem this wave of demoralization,_the
Party leadership has more and more abandoned the methods of
education, persuasion, and conviction, and taken up the methods
of military command within the Party, in much the same fashion
and extent that it has tried to do in the broad labor*movement.
But whereas in the labor movement, there has been mass rejection
of the commandi attitude, within the Party it has been accept-
ed by and Iarge without open revolt, except for isolated groups
which have immediately lost their way in the swamp of Trotskyism.
The system of military command has been frozen, as the only cor-_
rect expression of the Leninist concept of democratic centralism,
and was confirmed by the lhth Convention in the slogan: "Root
out all petty-bourgeois concepts regarding Party democracy." (p.856)

It is, however, the present system of military command, of ar-
bitrary authority, which is properly to be characterized as petty-
bourgeois in character. The Leninist, the proletarian, concept
of democratic centralism bases itself in winning the confidence
of the working class, which the lhth Convention comletely for-
got about. The CPUSA, before it can solve its inner-Party pro-
blems and before it can restore its relations with the labor
movement, will find it necessary to re-learn some fundamental
lessons taught us long ago by Lenin and Stalin.

The lhth Convention report makes it clear that the guiding

slogan of the Party leadership, borrowed from the French Revolution 1
of the_l8th century, is "Audacity, more audacity, always audacity." 4
It criticised itself only for not being audacious enough. It for- 5
got that Lenin approved of that slogan as a guide only for the mo-
ment of armed uprising, and condemned it as a crime at other times.
Following its false line, the lhth Convention scolded and threat-
ened the working class, and accused the class of betraying its own
cause. It scolded and threatened its own members, and accused them
of all mistakes and weaknesses. But it was supremely confident of
its own full righteousness. It suffered from a swelled head.

  

Many years ago Stalin uttered.words which sound as though they
were directed to the CPUSA of today. He said:

"The authority of the'Party is maintained by the
confidence of the workingclass. The confidence
.of the workingclass is not to be won by force,
for_the use of force would kill confidence. ‘It
can only be won if the Party theory.is sound, if
the Party policy is correct, if the Party is de-

voted to the cause of the workingclass, if the ?
Party is closely linked with the masses of the '
workingclass, and if the Party is ready and able ;,
to convince the masses that its slogans-are the ;
rig ones." (Leninism, Vol. I, p. 37). +.!.

s.'!~.

Stalin spoke sharply against those who think they can solve
problems by invoking "the authority of the Party." He said:

"Unless these conditions are fulfilled, ‘the
authority of the Party‘ and ‘the iron disci-
pline of the workingclass' are but an idle
boast." (p. hl).

‘ Stalin expanded this thought much further, and declared that
even when Party policy is “right in the'main", still the Party
must know how to "wait" when "the time is not yet ripe." .Here is

w how'Stalin developed this important point:

"Now let us contemplate another possibility.

Let us suppose that, owing to the political-back-
wardness of the workingclass, the_Party policy
(though right in the main) does not inspire gen-
eral confidence or command general support; let

 

 

us suppose that the Party has not yet been able
to convince the workingclass that its policy is
sound, the reason being (as the phrase runs)
that the time is not yet ripe. In such a case,
is the Party to take a decided initiative?
Should the Party try to give a strong trend to
the actions of the masses? No, certainly not!
In such cases the Party, if it is to lead ef-
fectively, must know how to wait until it has
convinced the masses that its policy is sound,
must help the masses to learn this by their own
~ experience." (p. hh).

In the development of this argument, Stalin quoted the words
or Lenin, who branded as a "crime", "worse than a blunder", th
plunging of the vanguard into a decisive action before the masses
are ready to support it. Lenin's words, quoted by Stalin,'were;

"The vanguard cannot conquer unaided. It would
be worse than a blunder, it would be a crime, to
send the vanguard into the fighting line before
the class as a'whole (the broad mass) is ready to
support it, or at least to show benevolent neu-
trality and fully determined not to go over to

the enemV....For this the masses must have learned
'.¢ by their own political experience."

Stalin, as Lenin before him, always insisted that the Party
should listen to "the voice of the masses." He said:

‘$4’

"Now, especially, the Party must be ready to pay
close attention to the voice of the masses; must
have a fine ear for their demands; must display
extreme caution and show peculiar elasticity in

its policy. Now, more than ever, will the Party
leadership of the masses be imperilled if Commun-
ists should suffer from swelled head. Let us never
forget Lenin's golden words at the Eleventh Party
Congress:

" 'Among the masses of the people, we Communists
are but drops in the ocean, and we cannot rule un-
less we give accurate expression to the folk con-
sciousnessiﬁl

The lhth Convention forgot Lenin's golden words;

Basis for this grandiose self-congratulation is the claim
that Foster, and following him the CPUSA, "discovered America”
as an imperialist power with ambitions to dominate the world;
"other parties" awoke to this reality belatedly, and after ig-
noring Foster°s urgent warningso ‘

It is cautiously suggested, in the subtle paraphrasing of

Stalin (from his Speeches on the American Party in 1929, in

which he denounced Foster as an "unprincipled factionalist" who

tried to turn the Comunist International into a field of poli~ *
tical "stock market speculations")9'that at last "the Communist

parties of other countries understand the vital role" of the

CPUSA9 and that "this is the significance of the greetings

that have been pouring into this Convention from Communist Par—

ties all over the worldoﬂ (p. 833).

‘It was "in the spirit of Communist modesty"9 said Foster,

\that he brings forward these claimse

These boasts may be merely noted hereg and set aside to
await their proper evaluation by the leaders of world commun=
isme Our task is the more limited one of answering the quesa
tiong "What achievements in the American class struggle did
this leadership bring to the Convention, as foundation for the
claim to be ‘among the first, if not the very first“ Communist

The prime test of the work of a Comunist~Party is its re=

This examination of the lhth Convention was written during
September and October. Just as the final section was being writ-
ten there occurred the November 2nd elections. The results upset
the applecarts of all the emerts, none more so than the leaders ’
of the lhth Convention. There has not been time to formulate the
most important lessons of the November 2nd upheaval, but a few

of the most obvious may be noted here in conclusion:

The lhth Convention nailed to its mast the banner: '

0 "A vote for either Truman or’Dewey means a vote
for eventual fascism and war."

But the masses, in the last months of the campaign, turned
to the support of Truman, and the resultswere hailed all over the
earth as amandate for-peace andprogressx _ ‘

»' The lhth Convention proclaimed:

"The" new "party is shattering the deadly two-party
system." x

But the masses ,. operating within the two-party system, succeed-
ed in registering their will beyond any doubt, and gave the two-party
system its most decisive victory in generations, and a new lease on
life.

The lhth Convention declared:

_"Inevitably the new party‘ will rally support ‘from all
democratic and peace-minded sections of the population."

‘ Butthe masses gave the new party only a little more than
500,000 votes in New York, and 600,000 votes in all the rest of
the country, surely a miserly measure for "all democratic and
peace-minded" Americans. '

The lhth Convention did not know what was going on among the
masses. That is a fatal defect for a Communist Party.

Never before since 1929, did an American Communist Conven-
tion demonstrate that it had lost contact with the workingclass,
that it did not know what the masses were~thinking and.feeling,
as did the lhth Convention demonstrate so completely.

The present leadership of the Communist Party has cut a
deep gulf between itself and the labor movement, between itself
and the broad masses.

That gulf can be filled, and the Party can resue its proper
place in the vanguard of the workingclass, only if the Party cor-
rects its false policies, begins again to listen to the masses,
and learns the full lessons of its present isolation. -

At no point, however, is it recognized as a fact (we do not"
even raise here the matter of.its being "explained"), that these
"setbacks" were of an uniquely important character - = that they
were administered by the rank and file members of the trade un=
ions, that their form consisted in masses of workers turning away
from the Communist and Left leadershipz

At no point is it recognized that these "setbacks" add up to ’
a total which can only be described as a general wrecking of the
powerful left wing movement which for ten years held the initia=
tive in the whole American labor movement.

At no point is it recognized that disruption and scattering
of the basic forces of the trade union left wing is the root
cause and explanation for the disintegration of the broader pro=
gressive camp, the Roosevelt coalition, the splintering of which
opened the door of American politics for the reactionary camp to
ride into power.

The thesis of the‘ "report on the Labor Panel" is that de=
spite these "setbacks", "since our l9b5 Emergency Convention,

V our Party“s trade union work has been extended and strengthenedo"
‘ The report admits that "these setbacks and defeats are a serious
blow to the entire workingclass and to our Party." But it goes
on to insist boldly that they must be explained, not by any de=
fects in party policy or leadership, but solely by "the impact
of the general offensive of American imperialism" (that is, by
the blows of the class enemy), plus the condition of "a tempoe
ary watering down of union consciousness" due to the influx of

young workers into the industries;

The left wing, with its several million followers, was
of course never Communisto But the Communists (less than 1%
of the labor movement) played a key role through a series of
alliances with non=Communists. The "report of the Labor Panel"
notes that "these alliances fell apart", but just how and why
this occurred is left a deep mystery, except for the evere
present "impact of the general offensive of American imperialism"e
Apparently the left wing was expected to win victories without
any opposition from its class enemies, but these were so unm
gentlemanly as to deliver blows against us, and therefore we
were defeatedﬁ

‘ At one point in the "report on the Labor’Panel", the ape
pearance is created of a "selfmcritical" facing of facts; '

.L,_
This comes in a discussion of "The NMU situation"e Here also,
however, it is emphasized that “the objective factors referred
to above generally apply here in force" (that is, we lost bee

cause the enemy hit uss), and the fact that the rank and file
turned their backs on the Communist leadership is hidden in a

. mass of wordsc There is given here, however, "a mere statement

of some subjective factors" (that is, mistakes by the Communists)
which made the situation worsee This "mere statement" is more
revealing of the true situation than all the labored "theoreti=
cal" argumentse It consists of 7 points, which are worthy of
quotation in full:

"l) There was no real understanding, much less
masterys of the united front tasks, especially on
the ships.

"2) There was never a real understanding of how.
to broaden out the base of the Left bloc within
the NoM.Ue

"3) It is a tribute to the Negro and.Puerto

Rican seamen that they were the'main support of

the Lefte It is clear, however, that without a
rounded~out support from all sections of the mem=
bership, the Left would in the end become weak~
ened also among the Negro and Puerto Rican workerso

"h) The Left allowed itself to be gripped in a

frozen factional situation, and the factional poi= - ’

soning of some of our own forces prevented the
hammering out of a correct united front policy with
members and leadership at ship committee levelo

"§) The inner situation diverted the Left from
developing.effective activities around such key
issues as the Progressive Partye

"6) The tendency to hesitate on the part of
some in the Left leadership, despite their integ-
rity and good Will, resulted in mistakes at cruu
cial momentse ' '

"7) The Left did not always have an adequate
strategy for their struggleo The need of the
workers in this industry is industrial unionismo
The Committee for Maritime Unity had the elements

 

-5- u

of a correct strategy, but once it was defeated,
no satisfactory substitute was.found."

What a picturez Who could ever guess from reading this den
scription of practical bankruptcy that the same Left seamen from
1935 to l9h5 could have justly, without exaggeration, be given
an exactly opposition description = = as follows;

1) They displayed the deepest understanding,
even "mastery" of the united front tasks, especially
on the ships. -

2) They showed a deep understanding of how’con~
stantly to broaden out the base of the Left bloc {
within the NMU,

3) They gave the outstanding example of come
plete unity of native and foreigneborn, white and
Negro, workers, ‘

L) They never permitted the crystallization
of a factional situation, either frozen or fluid,
because they understood factionalism would poison
the Union and even their own forces, and would
make impossible the hammering out of correct policy
at all levels, '
5) The Left leadership of the NMU always kept
the membership healthily involved in the broadest
political and cultural activities of the general
progressive movement, -. l 1

6) They never hesitated in crucial moments,
'because their correct general policy guarded them
‘ from situations where their natural instincts ¢
would rebel against Party line,

7) They always had an adequate strategy for
the unity of the entire maritime industry, based ‘ ‘
upon the knowledge that this could not be forced
from above, by clever manoeuvres and blueuprints,
but must arise from the conviction and common
consent of the membership of various existing
unions together with their elected leaders.
