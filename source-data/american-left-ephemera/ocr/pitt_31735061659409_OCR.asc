the organization of a broad labor and progressive political
‘alignment or party coalition, irrespective of its form.

In considering a change in the name of the party, the ques-

tion arises as ‘to whether we might not also select some other.

name than “Communist.” It is clear that conditions might
arise in which such a change could or should be made. Such
conditions might. include considerations regarding a merger
or uniﬁcation of the Communist Party together with other
groups of. advanced anti-fascist labor forces to form a broader
Marxist working class party, in which it might be desirable to
choose a new name for the organization.

But neither of these or other similar factors exist today.
There are no compelling political reasons for making such a
move at this time. In fact, there is every reason today to main-
tain the name “Communist,” as well as the Marxist-Leninist
character of our organization which will continue now and in
the future. a T

For the name “Communist” has the greatest prestige and
helps signify the speciﬁc and distinctive characteristics of our
organization as the most advanced and progressive political
organization of the American working class, as an American
Marxist political organization. The name “Communist” de-
notes better than any other our ultimate goal and program-

matic objective. The name “Communist” is bound up with ,

rich and lasting American and international working class

traditions and with 'our,own.signiﬁcant contributions to the

cause of liberty, freedom and social progress. A
Moreover, it is important npt only that we make our solid

contribution as Communists to the nation, but also that we '

work openly and publicly as Communists, as Communists in
name as well as in fact. This is important especially at present
preciselyin order to accelerate the growing collaboration of
Communists and non-Communists, of that united action which
is indispensable for the anti-fascist unity and futureof our
nation. These, then, are some of the reasons which, in my
opinion, should inﬂuence us to retain ‘the word and symbol

f“Communist” in any new name which we may adopt at this.

time.
Whatever ﬁnal decision we may reach on what name to sub-
' 10

 

‘)~.__.,,.~_ A. 

 

stitute for the word Party, whether “Association,” “League” or
“Society,” we shall of necessity likewise have to change certain
forms of our organization and methods of work. For instance, .
J ' y as alreadyindicated, such a change will alter the forms of our
' electoral activity in the sense that we shall no longer function
during election campaigns as an electoral party with an oﬂicial
party ticket. Those Communists who run for public office
will run on one or another party ticket, as candidates sup-
ported by a coalition of labor, progressive andother patriotic
forces; or, in certain cases as independents.
z i But whether or not Communists run as candidates—and‘ in
i the 1944 elections this will be on a relatively limited scale,
we Communists will be called upon to multiply our mass
work, including during the elections, in collaboration with
‘the other sectors of national unity, with all win-the—war forces,
especially with the trade unions. This will not only require
- 1 ‘the most active participation of the Communists in la-
_bor’s political organizations and campaigns, it will
necessitate a great strengthening and expansion of our inde~
pendent, Communist political activity. It will especial re- '
quire that we vastly improve and multiply our mass agitation
and propaganda, our Communist political-education mass ‘
work, nationally and on a local scale. It will further require
that we bring about a radical improvement in the Marxist-
Leninist training and development of all party personnel and ,
members, particularly of our trade union cadres, so that we
will be better equipped, theoretically and practically, to meet
our great responsibilities, to solve the complex strategic and" ‘
tactical problems of the new historical periodvwe are enter-
ing.
Finally, it is clear that whatever changes we may make in
* our party's name and electoral status the fundamental
"objectives and characteristics of our party will remain. For
\ irrespective of name, we are and shall continue to be an
1}merican working class political organization, guided by the
, “ science of Marxism-Leninism. And because of this, now and
on the morrow, we shall be in the vanguard, defending and
promoting, at all times, the vit-al interests and welfare of the
working class and of our nation and people.

Roy Hudson

The tasks of the working class in the light of the perspec-

tive raised by the Teheran Conference decisions require that A

labor develop such policies and organization as will enable
it to enter into full collaboration as an independent political

force with all other forcessupporting Teheran. The mainte- \

nance of national unity and the ability of America to play
the role required of it if the coalition is to be maintained,
depend upon the ability of labor to accomplish this task.

Labor is now becoming an independent political force. To-
day theredoes not prevail the traditional political apathy of
the American trade union movement. Instead of being indiffer-
ent to the political struggle, it has been developing political
understanding. Instead of rejecting political action, political
action is being undertaken on an ever broader scale. And
what is of historic signiﬁcance, the decisive section of the la-
bor movement, the C.I.O., has developed a political program
which, if applied, will enable labor to become an independent
political force. It is around this program and those forces
headed by Murray and Hillman, who are seeking to apply
it, that the great majority of labor can ﬁnd the means of be-
coming that independent political force capable of solving
its historic tasks in relation to the Teheran conference.

The emergence of the working class as an independent
political force is not in the main taking place organizationally

around the Communist Party and the Communist program. ‘

We are, however, giving our full support to the program and
activities of the progressive labor movement which are aimed

at organizing its political strength. We continue to make-this

the center of all ‘our work because it is the key to the solution
of all other problems. ‘ ‘

We Communists see eye to eye with all other such forces who
are also seeking to organize the political strength of labor and

12

 



 

are.already actively collaborating with the most important
of these forces. Yet this‘ collaboration is capable of improve-
ment and we know that if this improvement is brought about
it will increase our ability to contribute and help strengthen

_ labor’s role. At least one of the things that stands in the way

of more effective collaboration is confusion regarding the
role and program of the Communist Party. This is exp-ressed
in the doubts that exist as to whether collaboration on this
basis with the Communists is a_short or long time proposition.
Those who accept collaboration with us undoubtedly
speculate about the day when there will be a parting of
company. Those who welcome our collaboration because they
feel we have something to contribute are likewise still
inﬂuenced to a great degree by doubts on this question.
Even those who, while not sympathetic to Communism, con-
sider that we have an indispensable role to play, nevertheless
are not without their doubts as to the long range policy of
our party.
‘ Thus, while we have and intend to continue to have a com-
mon objective with these forces they have unjustified doubts
which have a disturbing effect. The fact that we have the
character of a political party does not help clear up this ques-
tion and possibly makes it more diflicult. I believe that the
change in the name will make it easier to clarify this question.
If that is the case then it will enable us to strengthen our

‘ collaboration with decisive forces, thereby speeding up the

organization of the American working class as an independent
political force and ﬁrmly establishing the Communists as an
integral and accepted part of these forces. . .

There are also an increasing number of extremely important
forces who in terms of their stand on every issue of the day
and collaboration with us are in every sense of the word Com-
munists except that they don’t have a card. These people know
the direction in which the masses are moving. politically and
that our policies and activities are decisive in helping the
masses there. But too many of these people are still not certain
that we will continue to move with the political movement of
the mass of workers. The change recommended will help re-

13

   

 

‘i

will enable us to recruit into our ranks many such people who
will also help attract even far wider sections. '

It has not always been possible for Communists in some
_ industries to fully make their inﬂuence felt as Communists.

Under those conditions, to have emphasized the fact that they
were Communists would only have been a help to those who
sought to attack labor and disrupt its ranks. However, if the
change in the name that has been recommended helps us to

achieve those changes in our relationship with broader labor '

forces, it will also soon, and very soon, create those conditions
where every Communist trade unionist will be able to contri-
bute a maximum in helping determine our policies, in helping
more directly lead our movement, build it and increase its in-
ﬂuence among the masses. And if this comes about, if the trade
unionists have greater opportunities to make their contribu—
tion‘ in the direct work and leadership of our movement, it
will be important indeed. _ " ,

The change in our name to the American Communist Po-A
litical Association is a step that is indispensable at this time
if we Communists are to make our maximum contribution to’
strengthen national uni-ty ‘behind the decisions of the Teheran‘
Conference. It will enable us to ensure that labor will rise to
its historic tasks. It will enable us to enlist new thousands for
support of the principles of Marxism-Leninism which Earl
Browder has taught us to apply to American conditions.

]o'/on Williamson

As a consequence of Teheran and the perspectives agreed
upon for the period of post-war reconstruction, one of the con-

clusions recommended in Comrade Browder’s/ report is the 1
) change of the term “Party” in the title of our organization to.

“Association.” This conclusion is very important to our rela-
tions with all other forces of the win-the-war coalition in our
country. Unquestionably, this will be a subject of tremendous
public discussion, in which we want our party members to
participate not only within the party conﬁnes, but beyond,

’ to help bring clarity to workers and the people generally. This

will help cement our relations, politically and organization-

ally, with new hundreds of thousands of Amerieans. .
_ The better to understand this recommendation for the
. change of name, we must avoid two initial reactions, one

the extreme of the other: either, that the change would mean
little and that we would function as before,,or, that our role
as a Marxist organization based on the working class would
be liquidated or replaced; that the “Communist Association”
would be less important than the Communist Party. '

In the light of the perspectives and the political condition

‘Comrade Browder outlined, what will be" the political func-

tion of such" a Communist organization? Indeed, wherefore
such an organization? " p
Such an organization is indispensable and its political inﬂu-
ence and "organizational strength must be multiplied irnany
times over, because: '

y First, as history has so amply attested, our Marxist-Leninist»
. theory and program enable us, in distinction‘ from all other

forces even within the coalition, to understand events, fore-
see their course, evaluate the relationship of forces and groups
within the country, and help inﬂuence and determine the

l direction of events. -

15

  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   

  

Secondly, a Marxist political organization of the type en-
visaged is indispensable because of the urgent need to facili-
tate and speed up the unity and greater organization of the
labor movement and to raise the political understanding of
the workers to new levels, commensurate with their respon-
sibilities. In other countries, because of the ‘absence of a

two-p-arty system such as we have, the direction of accomplish-

ing this is through the aﬂiliation or integration of the Marxist
forces with the mass political parties of the workers; in the
U.S.A., as yet, there is no mass political party of labor. _It is
deﬁnite, however, that the working class in our country is
maturing politically and is ﬁnding organizational forms other
than a Labor Party of national scope, even as it moves in the
direction of independent working class political action. As
a Marxist political organization we have an especially great
responsibility during this year of the fateful 1944 elections.
We must facilitate this political development of labor and
help achieve the maximum political unity of all labor as a
part of the great coalition behind the Commander-in—Chief
in the T944 elections. The understanding, unity, and, above
all, the political organization of labor in the Wards and Con-
gressional Districts, as an integral and vital part of the win-
the-war coalition of all classes and patriotic Americans, can
well be decisive in ensuring victory this year. ’

How will the “Communist Association” conduct its day-to-
day mass work? Just as now, Communists will continue to, help
build, activate, and participate in leading -trade unions and
all people's organizations. Within these organizations they
will contribute their best in ideas and activity and will sub-
ordinate themselves to majority decision. We will, as an or-
ganization, react to all vital issues in the communities, cities

or nation that concern the people. We will strive wherever ’

possible, to stimulate the organizing of the broadest mass
movement around such issues on an effective program, and, as
a Communist organization, become an integral part of this
mass movement.

ment or of other people's organizations, among Negroes, na-

tional groups, women, church people, or youth groups, Com-
munists will participate as individuals in those political

_ parties or support such candidates as represent the best in-

terests of our nation, in accordance with the principles of
strengthening the win-the—war coalition for victory and an
enduring peace. Wherever Communists are active in such
people's organizations or coalitions, they have_ had and
have no reason to aim at “capturing” them. On the
contrary, our aim is to collaborate with all other people's
forces. Our only desire is to contribute to the common
goal, to assume responsibility and activity with all of our
ability, and to participate in leadership to the extent that the
majority desires.

In our own activity as an organization, we shall be able less
and less to get along with old formulas and practices. Our
activities as an organization will have to be examined in the
light of new events and experiences. It is already clear that
increased emphasis must be placed on education and mass
propaganda. The press, literature, schools, etc., must occupy
a hundred times more of our time and effort than today. Does
this mean we are reducing ourselves to a mere propaganda
organization? Nothing of the kind. At this moment, when
leadership by example in all ﬁelds of mass work—especial1y
in the labor movement, among the Negro people and the na-
tional groups, among the women and profession.als—-is so ur-
gent for victory in the 1944 election, political clarity and un-
derstanding are a decisive contribution toward and an organ-
ized part of eﬁective mass political action and organization.

The “Communist Association” as a workers’ political-educa-'

tional organization will be fulﬁlling its Marxist vanguard role
to the American people and nation. . ‘

Let us examine further the content of the work of the
members of such a “Communist Association.” The increased
emphasis on education will be directed ﬁrst of all to our own
members, and to those sections of the labor and people's
movement with whom we are collaborating. But in addition
by utilization of all educational weapons—the Daily Worker,
The Worker, The Communist, the New Masses, the Marxist-

17

  
 

; \ \ /

Leninist classics, as well as popular literature, schools, for- T

ums,» and debates-—we shall‘ increase our efforts to make our
thought and principles available to the people in all commu-
nities. It is clear that regular reading by every Communist

. of the Daily Worker and The Communist becomes a. hundred”

times more urgent than ever now. _ 

’ While the average thinking worker learns through strug-
gle and experience, that is not enough for us. We must‘
study. ‘We must understand Marxist-Leninist principles in
order to help inﬂuence the course and outcome of struggles
—whether it be a single struggle or the developments in the

nation and the world, We also learn from our participation,
‘in the struggles how better to apply the strategy and tactics H
of our policies and how to enrich Marxist-Leninist theory,

itself.‘ The ﬁrs-t piece of literature for the current Recruiting

Campaign—Earl Browder’s A Talk About the Commum'st;».e

Party—is as indispensable for the party member as for the
prospective recruit. That pamphlet says: i

“The first responsibility of party membership is ‘that each
one of us has to systematically improve his own mind. . . .

* The more the members educate themselves and the more con-

sciously they organize their own self-education the stronger.
they emerge as party members and party leaders. ., . . One
of the shallow misconceptions of the p-arty is that once you
join the party you can stop thinkingifor yourself; that the

party does the thinking for you and hands down the decisions T

and all you have to do is to be a disciplined member ‘and

./carry them out.”

The whole ‘emphasis in Comrade Browder’s pamphlet is to‘

T root out such misconceptions. It stresses. the need of raising
the levelof understanding’ of the individual party member “

and the strengthening of his own ability to answer all prob-
lems that arise. It points out that the accomplishment of this
aim will greatly strengthen the collective thinking and actions.
of the party. 5T his understanding is particularly essential, to-
day in ﬁnally completing the transfer of trade union com-
rades to community branches and actively involving them in
community branch activity. '

p The “Communist Association" is conceived as a Marxist
political-educational‘ organization. Therefore, it will‘ not

_ stand on the ‘sidelines merely educating or propagandizing.

Even more than now—but with better political equipment-
w-e will react to and develop mass activity around all vital
issues affecting. the workers and the people as a whole, whether
in a neighborhood, a shop, an industry or in the nation itself,

to the form of organization. In the course of preparing for
the National Convention, these will have to be worked out.

' But even now it is clear that for us as an organization the pres-

ent community form of Club or Branch is the best and should
continue. Changes in structure would only be necessary to
facilitate our working freely as Communists as part of election
coalitions.

Now, what are the perspectives of growth of the “Commu- if V

nist Association”? We have a right to expect that, in this

period of intense political thinking and activity of the Ameri-

can eo le, increasin numbers of Workers will want to learn

a tremendous desire among them to see the road that lies
ahead to social progress. They will want to come together in
political association with one another and will be ready to
join an organization that representstheir views. Since we

\ know that the “Communist Association” will facilitate and
“ . o . c - ‘
help promote unity, understanding and activity, and that
joining will not limit the mass activities of its members, we‘

feel‘ that the attractive power of this organization is great
and that it will grow.

, The new developments and the changes recommended ‘at
this Plenum make it possible to win many thousands of new

 recruits to a Marxist organization at a tempo that has not
been possible previously. Why? Because:

1. The methods of functioning that we shall adopt will
make -clearer and emphasize to the prospective recruit the
possibility of supporting Marxist policies through member-

The interest in the recommendation to change the name of
the Communist Party is not limited to Communists alone. The

 

proposed change has stirred wide discussion and comment,

particularly in labor circles.

This pamphlet contains excerpts dealing with this question ’

from ‘the speeches of “Earl Browder, Eugene Dennis, Roy Hud-
son and John Williamson, at the meeting of the National

Committee of the Communist Party, held in New York on‘

January 7-9. They are prefaced by an appeal for 25,000 new
recruits to join the Communist Party.

These speeches are brought together in one pamphlet be- h

cause prospective members will want to know more about the
political organization they are being asked to join. It is part
of the democratic method of functioning of the Communist

organization to appeal to all potential recruits to join forces a

with it in achieving full political clarity and a deeper under-
standing of the enormous perspectives for historic progress.
opened up by the Teheran Agreement. Such clarity is the
prerequisite for vigorous mobilization of the people to guar-
antee victory in 1944 in the military struggle against Hitler

"fascism and on the home front in the decisive election struggle

  

that looms ahead. A larger, stronger and politically more

‘ effective Communist organization will help to strengthen the '

unity of labor and the "nation behind the epochal Teheran
Declaration.

ship in the “Communist Association” without leaving his
or her own mass organization. While this is true even today,

it has not always been fully understood, and some of our y

Branches have contributed to this misunderstanding. _

2. To those trade unionists who always say that their union
is taking on political forms of activity and therefore they are
waging the same ﬁght as we are, and that it is not necessary to
belong to a political organization, we should be able to point

out more convincingly that trade union struggle alone is not

enough. Membership in a Communist organization, which is in

no sense a “competing” organization, will help them, through -/

the acquisition of Marxist understanding on current issues
of the day, to be more effective workers and leaders in their
unions, and mass organizations.

'3. These changes should also stimulate widespread recruit-i

ing by enabling us to come to grips still more boldly and ef-
fectively with the slanderous misconception that Communists
are not part of American life but are “agents” of somebody
or other. We will force people to discuss our ideas and pro-
posals on their merits——not under conscious or unconscious
misconceptions. '

Our present and future members should everywhere take
their place as Marxists, defending their rights and ideas pub-
licly and winning supporters. In the course of such defense
of Marxist policies, recruiting should be a normal activity.

To those who may think it is not decisive whether we cany
through to success the ‘present Recruiting Campaign, I would
emphasize: .

1. The fact that a stoppage in the“ steel industry can still
take place on the very day that General Eisenhower is an-
nounced as the Commander of the Second Front, demonstrates

the crying need for a larger party and a more politically -

equipped party membership among the steel workers. There

‘are similar conditions and provocations in other industries-—

the electrical-radio industry, for example—and yet the workers
and their leaders have not committed the blunder as in the
steel industry. That shows greater understanding. and un-
doubtedly greater ability to inﬂuence the workers andto seek

20

 

 

 

 

alternatives to strikes. It also reflects a larger and more in-

ﬂuential party membership in these industries. Another ex-
ample was the splendid ‘struggle of the Transport Workers
Union in New York. The T.W.U. was subjected to a hundred
times greater provocation and difﬁculty than the steel workers;
yet not only did they refuse to strike, but they substantially

,won .. their demands. Furthermore, with the support of the

labor and progressive movement, they carried their victory
over into -the Councilmanic elections. i .

Fulﬁllment of the present Recruiting Campaign will help
guarantee uninterrupted production and defeat of defeatists
like Lewis within the labor movement. It will help patriotic
labor leaders and workers ﬁnd effective answers to strike provo-
cations while defending the workers’ interests.

It is possible in this campaign to get hundreds of leaders of
trade unions, Negro mass organizations and churches, women’s

organizations, national group organizations, community and

 

youth organizations, to join our party with thousands of rank-
and-ﬁle members. Recently a Section Organizer in a large
industrial section of the Midwest reported the instance of a
union leader of a local of over 10,000 members who has col-
laborated with the party, reads its press and agrees with its
program. He was approached to join the party and agrees,
but correctly wants to join openly before the whole world.
Asked if he thought the workers would disagree, he was sure
they would not, since he has been called a Communist for
years and still gets elected to office. In such a case it would
be well for such a leader, upon joining the party, to place

‘ the matter before several hundred of his shop stewards and .

active’ members, telling them that being constantly called a
Communist made him get acquainted with the program and
the policies of the Communists, and that he then found his
own ideas corresponded to those of the party. He should then
inform them that although he knows every American, includ-
ing himself, .has the right to any political opinion and mem-

bership in any political party,,he has decided to tell them .
« about his actions Of course, he will explain that this does

not commit the union to his political viewpoint any more

1 than any other local is committed to the Republican or Demo-

cratic Party if its president happens to belong to either of
these parties, or th-at a Catholic in the office of local union
president commits the local to Catholicism. If this union
leader agrees to this procedure, I am conﬁdent of what the
answer of the stewards will be. His Communist membership
will then be taken out of any mystery status and he will be
still more effective as a union leader. I amisure there are
hundreds of trade union leaders who can be recruited in this

i present campaign.

Z 2. The success of the present Recruiting Campaign is also
linked with victory in the 1944 elections. Twenty thousand
additional Communists can ‘mean several times that number
additional active workers in joint labor committees in the

Wards and Congressional Districts, in the C.I.O. Community \

Councils, and in the Ward and Precinct clubs of the win-
the-war coalition. —

It is possible to guarantee the success of the Recruiting
Campaign by connecting it with a well-organized enlighten-
ment campaign inside and outside the party. Let the new
member join with us in hammering out clarity and under-
standing~in answering every question in anyone’s mind that
remains unclear—in mobilizing labor and the people to guar-
antee victory in 1944. ‘

The question may arise: Does not the proposed change of A

name from “Party” to “Association,” or the dissolution of,
shop and industrial branches, mean a departure from Leninist
organizational principles? The answer is no.

, A real understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory means

learning its substance—learning to use it as a guide in the so- ~

lution of the practical problems that arise under the speciﬁc
conditions of each country and epoch. The substance of this

speciﬁc feature of Leninist organizational principles is that T 4

the Communist political organization, already equipped with
correct policies and perspectives, constantly maintains and
strengthens its maximum contact with the working class,
teaches as well as learns from the workers, and is thus able to
win broad support from the workers and become a larger and

‘The proposed changes in name and branch organizational

forms correspond to the realities of the present situation and y

will be the medium of bringing us closer to the millions of

Party to Association will facilitate the further strengthening‘
of the coalition for winning the war and ensuring a durable
peace in the post—war reconstruction years. Dissolving the
shop and industrial branches and adopting the exclusive
form of community branch, under present-day conditions in
our country, does not lessen our» contact with themasses. On
the contrary, it makes it possible politically to clarify and

mobilize our members on all urgent questions confronting the

labor movement and the nation; to become active wherever-
our members are in contact with workers, including shops,
local unions, and communities. Under present-day‘ conditions,
the community branch provides the most effective organiza-
tional form for functioning as an American political organiza-‘

tion inﬂuencing, inspiring and mobilizing broad sections of

the people in the nation's victory drive. The dissolution of
the shop and industrial branch removed an outworn organi-
zational form, which threatened to create artiﬁcial barriers
between Communists and non-Communists in the trade
unions and thus weaken the struggle for maximum unity and
threaten the closest relationship between our party and the
masses. ‘

The Communist Recruiti1ig' Drive

EBRUARY 12, 1g4;1—the 135th anniversary of the birth
Fof Abraham Lincoln—has been chosen as the day to open
the drive for 25,000 new members of the Communist Party.

When Abe Lincoln, son of a worker, undertook in 1861 the
job of guiding our country through the war against slavery,
to preserve “government of the people, by the people, for the
people,” he found the workers and independent farmers his
strongest'relia‘nce for the national unity of the patriots of all
classes which was indispensable to victory.

It is something like that again in the present war, many

.times greater than the war that Lincoln led.

The new, world—wide “emancipation proclamation” for the
national liberation of all peoples, signed by the United States,
thelSoviet Union, and Great Britain at Teheran, not only
assures victory in the most dangerous war, but also opens a
vast new prospect of economic well-being in peaceful con-
struction in all countries.

But the nation’s policy ofpresolute war through to thesvic-‘

tory and the destruction of Nazism and fascism is being chal-
lenged by a powerful defeatist movement. The national policy
of ‘war to victory is at stake in the 1944 elections just as the
war policy of Lincoln was at stake in the elections of 1864.
The key to victory isnational unity. Neither the war nor
the coming national elections is a struggle for the special in-
terests of any class. Patriotism is to be found among the de-

cisive g sections of all classes, including the capitalists.

Nevertheless, again as in Lincoln's time, the strongest bulwark
of the unity of the nation is necessarily to be found in the

‘ millions of workers and farmers. Instinctiv‘ely every worker ‘ if

_ feels that in a just war the martial spirit and. intelligent

 

patriotism of the workers in the industries and trade
unions and on the farms are bound to be the ﬁrmest
foundation of the national unity. It is especially among

3

  

  

these that the Communist Party must be built stronger.
The Communist Party is indispensable to the strength and

, solidarity of the labor movement to pursue this course—the

course which alone can receive united support of the labor
movement and of the majority of the nation. It is more than
ever necessary to organize politically the best members of the
working class of our country. They must have the added
strength and ﬁrmness which they can obtain only from edu-
cation in the theoretical and practical use of the Marxist-
Leninist science, and from Communist political organization.

In this drive to enroll new members, we place the ﬁrst

emphasis upon trade unionists. The conscious political activ-

ity of the members of the trade unions to aid in the solution
of the problems of the nation has become the ﬁrst necessity
for the nation.

Particular attention must be paid to the enrollment of
working women, whose place in the national life is increased
by the coming of millions of girls and women into the indus-
tries and the trade unions. ‘

The ﬁnest of the young people now entering our industrial
and trade union life by millions must be given the opportu-
nity, through enrollment in the Communist Party, to develop
their political understanding and their capacity in civilian
life to support the efforts of their ten million brothers in the
armed forces.

The Negro people must be given the opportunity to become
members of the Communist Party, as the best way to realize
the slogan of the Communist Negro leader, Councilman Ben
Davis, that the jim-crow system can and must now be forever
wiped out from the life of our country. It is necessary to

enroll into the Communist Party the most active and devout-

church people,'Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish.

The call for the building of the Communist Party is a call
for the embodiment of the best human material into the most
advanced and enlightened political organization of the people.
It is in the ﬁnest traditions of the labor movement, in the

ﬁnest traditions of America, it is in accord with the patriotic’

and military ardor of the freedom-loving peoples of all the

world. _It is in the spirit symbolized by Abraham Lincoln.

Last May, when the dissolution of the Communist. Inter-
national was announced, the New York Times and other pa-
pers voiced the demand that the Communist Party of the United
States should also dissolve itself and disperse. At that time
I wrote a series of_ letters to the press in which I challenged
the validity of this proposal, but expressed the readiness of the
Communist Party to discuss this or any other question with
any responsible spokesmen of public life, from the single
standard of how best to win the war. My letters were reported
to and approved by the June plenary session of our National
Committee. Q

We received no response from anyone to discuss this or any
other proposals for changes in the form of activities of the
Communist movement in this country.

At this meeting of our National Committee we are faced
only with the question, therefore, whether there are any
changes which we ourselves, unilaterally and without discus-
sion with anyone else, may ﬁnd it expedient to adopt in the
interest of the nation, of the war, and of the working class
which we basically represent. -

Recently we have published a pamphlet entitled A Talk
About the Communist Party, a report of speeches made by
myself in Detroit and Chicago to party membership meetings.
The function and role therein described for- the organization
of Communists, of-Marxists, are permanent features of any
such organization, whatever may be its name or immediate
practical tasks.

Such an organization we are sure must be maintained in
the United States, and must be built even stronger. We know
that for the United States to be without such an organization

would weaken our country internally and in its foreign re-,<

lations. Internally, the organized Marxists furnish one of the
most stable points of support and orientation for the whole

w

democratic-progressive camp; in foreign relations they furnish

the nation essential ‘experience in the necessary policies’ for
dealing with Communists in otherlands, such as China, Yugo-
slavia, Italy and France, where Communistcooperation is
absolu‘tel.y inescapable if Europe and Asia are to be reorgan-
ized in a period of relative peace and order. Fromlthis point
of view ‘alone, the practical conclusion must be drawn that
the continued and growing activity and organization of the

Communist‘ movement in the United States are in the interest‘

of the nation, of the war, and of an orderly world after the
war. This is a conclusion which we believe inescapable not
only for ourselves but for all intelligent democrats. ’

L There is not the same compelling fundamental reason why,
the organization should bear the name “Communist.” It is

conceivable that a situation. might exist in which another
name would be practically more expedient, and in several
countries that has been found to be the case by the Marxists
of such lands. But it is our considered judgment that there is

, nothing in the situation of the United States which makes
such a change from the name “Communist” to something else;

an expedient one. It might even be detrimental, in giving an
opening to our enemies to create more confusion in the country
by spreading suspicions that the new name is camouﬂage to
cover direly sinister conspiracies. At the same time, the very
name itself has the _highest prestige of its history, and is not
to be discarded lightly and without the most serious necessity.

It is around the concept “Party” rather than of “Commu-

nist” that there exists today in America the most practical‘ ‘

obstruction to our cooperative relationships with other
democratic groups.

What is called the “two party system” in the United States
is an old tradition which dominates most American minds.
It recognizes as a “party” only that particular combination
which is in power, and the combination of the opposition

which is an immediate alternative to take power. All lesser‘

political groupings are contained within the “two major par-

S ties,” which in fact are coalitions of many. groups which in
‘ most countries would be separate parties; or if the lesser group

77

takes the name of “party, and becomes one of the so—called

6

 

 

\

“minor parties,” it is regarded as a sect whichihas withdrawn
itself from the practical political life of the nation. V

This “two party system” has been tremendously'strength-
ened and buttressed against the storms of constant political
changes that go on within it, by the system of direct primaries
which gives all voters the opportunity to enroll under one or
other of the two major parties and participate in choosing its
candidates, as well as the party committees and delegates to
conventions.

Obviously, to realize the promise of Teheran the broadest

democratic-progressive united front must be maintained in i
the United States. Equally obviously, the Communists will be. p
a part, and asmall minority part, of that united front. The‘

Communist organization will be in a long—term alliance with
forces much larger than itself. .
It follows from this fact, that in thepeculiar American sense

of the "word, ‘the Communists will not be operating as a,

“party,” that is with their own separate candidates in elec-
tions, except under special circumstances when they may be
forced to act through “independent candidates.”
I This is already our practical situation; and we are now
extending the perspective of national unity for many years
into the future. It is no longer an “emergency situation” but
is merging into al“normal” situation.

All these considerations point to the expediency of .a de-
cision that the Communist organization in the United States
should adjust its name to correspond more exactly to the

American political tradition and its own practical political’

role.

i, Such a decision would be that, instead of being known as ‘

“The Communist Party of the United States," our organiza-

‘ tion should call itself something like “American Communist

Political Association.” _
Under such a name we will iﬁnd it much easier to explain

»our true relationship with allother democratic and progres-

sive groupings which operate through the medium, in the

main, of the two party system, and take our place in free

collaboration at their side.

A’ change from “Communist Party" to that of “Ameri-
can Communist Political Association” by its very formula-
tion will markedly symbolize one of the main political con-
clusions at which we have arrived for the present and next
period of political developments within the country. It will
help show that our organization is not orientated upon a
course of seeking governmental power now or in the
postwar years immediately following. This change would, to
some extent, serve to emphasize in broader circles that we are
bending every effort to organize a national coalition of all
patriotic, anti-fascist forces now and on the marrow, so as to
speed the destruction of Hitler and the Axis, and" to ensure
and maintain a just and durable peace. It should serve to
focus attention on the fact that after the war, within the
country, we are pursuing a course of unity of action to pro-

tect and improve our nation’s democratic institutions and

liberties and to promote maximum production, employment
and social security within the framework of capitalism.
Obviously there is another reason which points to the
advisability of changing from Party to Association. In making
such a change wegwould not merely change our name, but
also our electoral status. It is true that in so doing we would
lose the privilege of an electoral party, including the right to
nominate and run a party ticket (a right which today is con-
siderably curtailed). Yet by so doing we might obtain the right
and opportunity to participate in one or another of the major
election campaigns in conjunction with, and along lines
similar to that employed by the Farmer-Labor Association of
Minnesota, the United Labor League of Philadelphia, or the
Washington Commonwealth Federation. And most important,
we would be able more effectively to strengthen our collabora-
tion with broader sections of the labor movement which are
developing greater political understanding and activity,‘ but

8

 

 

which in electoral campaigns operate through a vote for pro-
gressive candidates of one or another of the major parties, or
existing state Farmer-Labor parties.

As for the 1944 Presidential and Congressional elections,

' there can be no doubt that we will support the win-the-war
candidates put forward from the camp of national unity, irre-

spective of party label.

Certainly the change which we propose from Party to
Association should facilitate the practical application of our
unity policy in these fateful wartime elections. It should facili-
tate our collaboration with the other political groups and la-
bor forces during and after the elections, especially if we work
correctly and convincingly explain our move. It should re-
move certain artiﬁcial barriers which now hinder a large per-
centage of party members, including thousands of Communist
trade unionists, from working more closely together, and in a
normal fashion, with other labor and progressive forces in one
or another of the established party primary and election
campaigns. ‘

Furthermore, it seems to me that the proposal to change
from Party to Association is necessary and desirable from a
longer range viewpoint. For the outlook is that after the
1944 elections, the political realignments which aretnow tak-
ing place and will continue to unfold, most probably will
crystalize in one of two ways: either by a basic regrouping
within one of the major parties, in which labor and the popu-
lar forces would secure a leading political inﬂuence and posi-
tion in many existing state, city and precinct organizations;

or, if this fails to materialize, it is likely that there may emerge

a third party, nationally, as a leading and decisive. mass party,
based on unifying the labor and people's organizations in col-
laboration with the progressive forces from both existing
major parties.

In either event, or whatever the speciﬁc form the crystalli-
zation of progressive, anti-fascist political alignments may take
following the 1944 elections and in the immediate post-war
period, the change of our own organization's name and elec-
toral status can help advance the unity of the democratic
camp, the unity of Communists and non-Communists within
