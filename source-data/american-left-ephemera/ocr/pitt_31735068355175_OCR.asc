   I ' I Johnson Majority Sets 
Record at I5.6 Million    ’

American voters crushed Senator Barry Goldwater and ‘the
ultra-conservative choice he offered them, giving the Johnson.

-—a stunning 15.6 million-vote majority across the nation.
Receiving over 61 percent of the

was given 60.8 percent of the vote total. “ - ‘
With an electoral vote margin of 486 to 52, Johnson lost.only
six states-—five in the deep South and Arizona, which wentto-_th‘e‘
GOP Senator by a slim majority of 4,000 votes. A 
The extent of the Democratic landslide is reflected, too,
U. S. House of Representatives, ‘where the President’s party
up a gain of 38 seats, giving the Democrats a 295 to 140 majority:

Traditionally a roadblock to lib-
eral legislation, the House’s
complexion was changed even
more than the above figure in-
dicates, since 48 new Demo-
. cratic Congressmen were elect-

ed. The Republicans won 10

new seats——mostly in the South

-with GOP conservatives\ sim-

ply replacing cons_ervative.s

from the Democratic party.

' Two ‘Senate Seats

In the Senate,‘ Democrats
made a net gain of two‘ seats,
' and thus will have a majority
there of 68 to 32 when Congress

convenes again in January.

Republicans scored, a gain in
only one area——the state gover-
norships. Although the Demo-
crats won 17 of the 25‘ contests,
the GOP made a net "gain of
one, meaning that ‘Democrats
will hold the governor’s chairin
33 states, the GO-Pain 17. _

At the‘ same’ time, Repub-
licans lost more than 485 state
Senate and House seats across
the nation-—the Republicans re-

 

EL PA

House of Representatives,

entirely from El Paso County. - 
With President Lyndon B. Johnson. carrying his
home state by close to 700,000, Democrats made a _cleanr ;
sweep at the Congressional level. In the 5th District, 
Earle Cabell knocked off 10-year veteran Bruce 
a Republican. -Ralph W. Yarborough, who early in"'the"'”‘"~
campaign was thought to be in. some trouble in his-fbid
for re-election to the U. S. Senate, easily -disposed of‘ -
George Bush——receiving 56.2. percent of the vote total.
A White, Who was supported by the three Mine-Mill,
locals in El Paso through a close primary fight as well.._i[-}.,
came .out of the county; with 

as in the general election,
a better than 13,000-vote edge—-
34,608 to Foreman’s 21,337. His
margin was padded only slight-
in the District’s other 18

Local Races
Democrat Pete Snelson was
named to the state Senate from
the 29th District and Raul
Muniz, a Democrat, won a state
House seat, adding to the crush-

. ing defeat sustained by the GOP

county organization. The state
Republican party, too, had con-
sidered the 16th Congressional
District as a key concentration
point, at least partially because
of the substantial John Birch
strength in the area. '

Foreman, who had developed
a national reputation as a right
wing spokesman, was a con-
sistent conservative voice in
Congress. Along with Senator
John Tower, he worked to pro-
mote the nomination and candi-
dacy of Senator Goldwater-—un-
like many Republicans in other
sections of the country.

Big Vote in County ,

El Paso Democratic Chairman
Tom Diamond called “a lot of
man to man contacts” the key

‘ factor in the Democratic sweep

of the county, althoughi he felt

American Bras  
Provides 18c to 28¢ in Wages

,;

5 Buffalo Pact

  December. 

BUFFALO, N.Y.—A new three-year agreement with the Anaconda American, _
Brass Company, ratified unanimously by the members of Mine-Mill Local 593 on 
Oct. 23, provides wage hikes ranging from 18 to 28 cents per hour over that period,

increased health and welfare coverage, improvements in the current security benefit

fund, a better vacation schedule, and many other miscellaneous contract gains. ,
Nearly 700 workers in the 850-member local union turned out to approve the"-

pact at three separate ratification meetings. The negotiating committee, headed by A

Robert Brown, vice-president of the local, recommended acceptance of the new

agreement, which was reached without a walkout, although several times during the 
lengthy negotiations bargaining representatives felt themselves on the C if

strike.

Brass plants around the country set up
demands this year, working un-
‘der the auspices of the Indus-

trial Union Department of the
AFL-CIO. Tentative strike dead-
lines were set several times,
only to find one of the locals
reporting some progress in their
bargaining sessions.

Headed by Harris

Involved with the IUD,.com-
mittee, which was chaired by
Stephen J. Harris, assistant
director of the IUD’s collective
bargaining section, were the
Mine-Mill locals at Buffalo and
Torrington, .Conn., the United
Steelworkers of America, and
the International. Association of
Machinists.

Mine-Milllnternational Repre-
sentative Joseph C. Scioli was ‘a
member of the steering com-
mittee of the coordinating group,
while Mine-Mill Local 593 Presi-
dent Stanley J. Wenham, Pat
Pacile and Casey Adamczyk,

both of Local 593, and C. R.

Gunn and Emil L. Graber of
Local 423 in Torrington attend-
ed the joint meetings as repre-

sentatives of their respective-

local unions. L
Wage gains in the new Buf-
falo contract include across-the-
board raises of six cents per
hour in each of the three years,

" with the first hike retroactive to

July 1 of this year. Skilled
tradesmen will receive an addi-
tional five cents per hour the
first year, again retroactive to
July .1, and another five cents
per hour effective July 1, 1966.
The ’across~the-board increases
will be directly reflected in all
incentive payments.

Security Fund Increased

The ceiling on the security
benefit fund was removed, and,
in the contract’s second year,
the company will increase by
two cents per hour each em-

p1oyee’s fund, making a total of
’five cents per hour for each

worker. An employee may then
draw $40 a week in case of sick-
ness, accident, or layo-ff.—
Effective next year, workers
with 25 years of service will get

four weeks of paid vacation, and ,

in 1966, one additional day’ s paid

“vacation will be given for each

two years of seniority between
15 and 25. For example, men
with 23 years of seniority will
get 3 weeks and 4 days.

The new contract calls for a
10 cents an hour bonus for cus-
todial workers for all hours in
any week which includes Satur-
day, Sunday, or holiday work.
The bonus pay is doubled for all
hours if the week in question
includes both ‘a Sundayand a
holiday.

Other features of the agree-
ment are bereavement pay. — a
maximum of threedayspay in
the event of death in the im-
mediate family; jury duty pay
effective July 1, '1965——th‘e com-
pany making up the difference
between the worker’s regular
paycheck and the amount here-
ceives for an unlimited number
of days on jury service; and
double time and‘ a half pay for
any work performed on the
eight paid holidays, also effec-
tive July 1, 1965.

‘H & W Gains

Several health and welfare

, gains were made. Effective im-

mediately, sick and accident

-disability benefits are increased

to $60 per week for a period of
39 weeks. Maternity benefits
are increased to $160 and maxi-
mum surgical payments to $350,
with coverage on all surgical
procedures being hiked by 162/3

* percent. Baby nursing care and

baby insurance coverage from
birth are included in the new
contract. , .

THE MINE-MILL umon C

 

  Dies in Stalnford

, STAMFORD, Conn.——The Rev. Edward Hartman Coleman, an
" -international representative of the International Union of Mine,
' Mill, and Smelter Workers for the past nine years, died suddenly
 on Nov. 10——the victim of a heart attack. Born in Ansonia on
C ,9 April 12, 1905, he was 59 years old.
.- H The son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Nero Coleman, at an early
0 age he vowed, after reading about atrocities to Negroes in the
South, to devote his life to helping to erase injustices. His life-'
long motto was, “Do all you can, and if it fails, don’t worry about
it; just be sure you have done your part.”
.~ .Coleman’s first love was the church. He served as superin-
‘ — gtendent ‘of a church school prior to his marriage to Miss Catherine
_ ._ Malloy, and was later called to
the ministry, serving churches
.  of the Baptist and the A.M.E.Z.
 denominations. His last active

pastorate was in Pittsburgh, Pa.,

C “where he taught religious educa-
’ tion in the public school system
 . and was a city probation officer.

; It was during this period that
the first Mrs. Coleman died,
leaving one daughter, the pres-
ent Mrs. Barbara Kelly. A son,

{H ‘Edward, had died in infancy.

Rev. Coleman moved to Stam-
ford, joined the Union Baptist

- Church, and became associate

minister during the pastorate of
the Rev. Dr. I. Logan Kearse—
a position he continued to hold
until his death.
Active in Many- Areas
At this time, he became ac-

tive in politics, the civil rights

struggle, and the labor move-
ment, His father had been a
worker, and Coleman

Mill Local 552. ,
Active in the Democratic par-

_ ty, he was fired in 1950 for his

political activity. A fighter for
equalityof opportunity, both in
and out of the plant, he was
also involved in a struggle to
seniority of the

‘ elected president of the Stam-

Union and held that position for
several years before coming a

He serviced the Connecticut

_ locals, including his old Local

Mill local unions in New Jersey.

' Only six days before his death,

Coleman had helped wrap up a
new contract between Local 552
and the Cerro Copper and Brass
Company, which had purchased
the "old Stamford Rolling Mills
last spring. The agreement in-

‘cludes a new incentive system

which will provide an opportu-

payments, and an additional $13
per week for supplementary
workmen’s compensation. The
company will pick up the in-
creased cost of Blue Cross-Blue
Shield coverage, amounting to
one cent ,per hour.

Employees ‘thus will receive
$75 per week workmen’s com-
pensation —— the state payment
plus $33 from the company. \

Monthly Pension -Payment
In the second year of the con-
tract, another 25 cents is added
to the pension plan, making a
total monthly payment of $3
per year of service, effective
July 1, 1965. Another general
wage increase of six cents per
hour is effective that date.

_ In addition, the wage rates of

the casting, hog mould and
kettlemen classifications will be
adjusted upwards by 10 cents
per hour. ,

Effective July 1, 1966, there
will be another across-the-board
hike of seven cents per hour.
The company will pick up any

in c r e a‘ s e in Blue ‘Cross-Blue '

Shield costs “or, in the absence

of an increase, will add onercent’

per hour to the wage increase.
-The contract, will boost the
labor rate from $2.345 per hour
to $2.535 per hour on July 1, 1966
and the “A” maintenance rate
from $2.86 to,;¢$3.05 per hour.
During many meetings 'prior
to the strike,’ the company’s best
offer had been for a‘ two-year
contract providing only a seven
cents wage increase each year.

96% Strike Vote

A strike ‘vote which registered
96 percent in favor indicated the
determination and solidarity of
the workers which prevailed
throughout. Strike relief was
well organized and shelter for

the picketers included a bus and
a closed truck, donated by Rev.-

John Cross and Joe Chaney
respectively, both members of
Local 632. The truck provided a
place for cooking and its sides
were used as bulletin boards.

Willie Norman, a longtime
member of the union, turned his
home near the plant com-
pletely over to the strikers as
a. headquarters for membership
and committee meetings and a
food distribution center. , Nor-
man,» who furnished all the
utilities, told the local union,
whichoffered to pay him for
the hospitality, to “put it in the
strike fund.” .

Politics Not Forgotten

In the middle of the month-

long strike, on Oct. 10 and 11,-

Local 632 sent Curtis Booth and
A. Q. Evans as ‘delegates to the
Mine-Mill District 4 conference
in Chicago, Ill. —— a meeting
which stressed the importance
of getting out a heavy vote on
Nov. 3. Despite the shutdown,
members of the local took an
active part in the political cam-
paign in the Indianapolis area,
distributing literature on John-
son and Humphrey, posting pla-
cards, passing out bumper
stickers, and even making vol-
untary contributions to the Mine-
Mill Labor Political Action Com-
mittee.

President Willie Jones headed
the union’s negotiating com-
mittee, which ‘included Virgil
Jones, financial secretary; Joe
Scruggs, recording secretary;

Wage Hikes, Pension Gains 

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.——With worker morale and organization geared to endure
a_lengthy strike if necessary to achieve their demands, the National Lead Company
caved on Oct. 21, offering a new three-year contract which provides 19 cents per hour
across-the-board wage increases over that period, a greatly improved pension plan, ’
and other important gains for the 51 employees.
_ The membership of Mine-Mill Local 632 quickly ratified the new agreement, end-
mg a 30-day strike which saw the secondary lead smelter here picketed around the .
clock seven days a week. Each worker picketed eight hours daily until the last week 
of the walkout when the duty was reduced to four hours per day.

. Gains in the first year of the pact, retroactive to July 1, include a general wage
hike of SIX cents per hour, an additional 25 cents per year of past or future service .

Miners from  

Appalachia Get

Work in Mont.

Due to increasing automation

and other factors, the coal fields '

of Appalachia are among the
most depressed areas in the
country today. Employment has
plummeted from about. 450,000

in 1948 to the present figure of. ‘

125,000. . .
The Johnson administration's

“war on poverty” was designed. . ’ ‘"

to attack just such pockets of

chronic unemployment and re-  -

sulting poverty. And while the
program has

been helping to findgwork for

some of the hundreds{of..jobless.

coal miners.

f‘The story is being written it
« jointly,”

said an -Associated
Press dispatch out of Washing-

ton on Nov.,17, “by federal and 
state employment services and-
two . independent unions, . the
United Mine Workers of -Ameri- ,
ca and the International union";-
and, Smelter.’

of Mine, Mill
Workers.”_ ' .

Many’ unemployed coal miners, ‘ 

informed by federal authorities

of job opportunities in the copper _

mines of Montana, have gone
to that state and received help

from the company,- the unions ,
and the community in the form ‘

of interest-free loans, credit and
even donations
clothing in some cases while
making the transition to their
new surroundings. . '

“Many of the new miners -‘

have already earned more in
one month than they made in an
entire year in a series of odd
jobs back home,” according to
a report from the Montana Em-
ployment Service.

At the same time, not all "of
the miners from Alabama, Ken-
tucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West
Virginia and Pennsylvania have
lasted in Montana‘.
Board Member Barney, Rask
explained that some didn’t like
the climate, while some simply

couldn’t successfully make the.

switch from coal to hard-rock
mining.

Reginald Beavis, president of
the Butte Miners Union,
pointed out that while itheAna-

lconda Company has experienced
a shortage of miners for the .

past two years, the jobs avail-
able have tightened up» a good
deal since the company cut back

from a, six-day to a five-day ,

week latein October.

Some of the men received un- '
employment compensation from

the government while taking a
couple of weeks of classroom

training before starting, under’-5

ground work. . .
Despite setbacks, government
officials feel that the effort has
been worthwhile in helping job-
less- men to find employment in
an entirely new region of the
nation. -

 With Solid Win Over Mechem

ALBUQUERQUE, N. M.——U. S. Rep. Joseph M. Montoya, a supporter of federal

 mine safety. legislation and a sponsor of a bill asking early retirement for miners and
.;_ --others in hazardous industries, will take a seat in the U. S. Senate when Congress
  convenes in January.
, p In what was expected to be a nip and tuck battle all the way, Montoya knocked
 off by a 30,000-vote margin incumbent Republican Senator Edwin L. Mechem, who

had voted against the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the tax cut, and cloture to end the

. civil rights debate.

- . Following the lead of the Republican presidential candidate, who accused Presi-
dent Johnson of being “soft on communism,” Mechem launched a frantic red-baiting
campaign against Montoya in the final month—to no avail.

‘ President Johnson led the Democratic sweep of the state, beating Sen. Barry

Gov. Jack Campbell, a Demo-

Local Candidates
In Grant County, where Local
890 is located, Steve Ray.Aguirre
won by a landslide in the race
for sheriff. The first Mexican-
American sheriff in the history

of. the county and a member of-

the Mine-Mill local, he won by
5,110 to 1,776 over his Repub-
lican opponent. Ben D. Alta-
mirano, also endorsed by the
Amalgamated Bayard District

for commissioner in Grant

E. C. Serna was unopposed

"Right---I-o-Work"
Fight Looms

Bernalillo County Democratic
Chairman Henry Kirker, who,
together with his wife, was
killed in an auto accident in the
middle of November, had said
after the election that the New
Mexico Citizens Council for In-
dustrial Peace was being reac-
tivated to fight efforts being
made to obtain a “right-to

work” law in the state. Kirker, '

who had introduced Montoya at
the Mine-Mill rally, had pre-

viously served as chairman of
the group.

Saying that he feels such a
law would threaten the state’s
improving industrial develop-
ment climate, Governor Camp-
bell promised to veto any such
bill which might pass in the
legislature.

Former state legislator Ellis
Whitney of Roswell announced
on Nov. 8 that a group was be-
ing formed to push for “right-
to-work” legislation.

On the national level, virtually
all sections of the labor move-
ment are preparing a drive ask-
ing Congress, to repeal Section
14b of the Taft-Hartley Act—that
part of the law which allows
state “right-to-work” statutes.

1954-4 Year of Achievement 

by Irving Dichfer

International Secretary-Treasurer , . 6:
T THIS TIME OF THE YEAR, with the holidays approaching}-i_”*‘*-
and union activity tapering off for a brief period, we can I 
sit backand say “What a year.” For us in Mine-Mill, it’s been a. =; 3 *
busy and fruitful year. It began with an intensified campaign for   _
federal mine safety legislation and ended only recently with,the_  
elections. ‘if?  
On the whole, the year was one of achievement. While» it is -‘ ‘f
true that we could not move Congress to hold hearings on the 
Metcalf-Montoya bill, we did broaden its base of support. Int‘er—  6 
estingly enough, every Congressman who attached his name to they".
bill was re-elected. In one notable instance in Arizona, support of
the mine safety bill meant the difference between defeat and elec-,’.
tion. In New Mexico, Senator-elect Joseph Montoya was attacked ",7 

by his opponent for sp-onsoring the mine safety bill, but won over-' '

  

The mine safety bill will be re-introduced in the new Congress. f 

We expect to see more names attached to the bill than in the  
previous session. In addition, we will seek reintroduction of our.’.*; .1 ‘*4
early retirement bill. And here, too, we can be assured of broader  ,
sponsorship. ‘ 6 .~

OLITICAL ACTION in our union" had to await the competion Z

of collective bargaining. Bargaining was lengthy and diffi-'._ "

cult, but our new agreements were worth the time, effort, and’ ,

strikes necessary to achieve them. We scored a whole series of‘ ; 

firsts, important not only to our member. - ‘ V '

ship but to the entire trade union move-
ment.

We improved wages substantially, in-
creased night shift differentials, in some
instances added a paid holiday, eliminated
employee contribution and/or improved
health and welfare coverage, increased va-
cation time, and made a historic break-
through in our security-severance package.
We settled many outstanding local issues.

We struck at Kennecott and were on the
verge of strike with quite a few other com-
panies. The Kennecott strike, though short
in duration, was costly. It made every one
of us realize that we had to set new stand- , .
ards’ for strike welfare. What may have been adequate ten years
ago is no longer suitable. A union like ours, approaching collective g,
bargaining with the major companies in our industry, has to have’,
a most substantial strike fund. The locals together with the inter,
national union spent over $200,000 during the comparativelyyshort
Kennecott strike. The leadership and entire membership of our 1
union will have to address themselves to the problem of build
ing an adequate fund for 1967. .

THE MJINE-MILL" UNION

;  Gov. Babcock Survives,‘

Democrats Score Heavily in Montana

Giving the state’s four electoral votes to the Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in 16 years,

83 percent of Montana’s registered voters went to the polls on Nov. 3 to endorse Lyndon B. Johnson by a better
than 45,000 majority across the state. .
  Democrats also scored impressive victories on the state level-—gaining control of the House of Representatives,
I-which the GOP held by a 59 to 37 margin for the past two years, and retaining dominance of the state Senate,
although by a slightly closer margin. '
-For the first time since 1959, therefore, Democrats control both houses.

, At the same time, conservative Republican Gov. Tim Babcock, who succeeded to that office in January, 1962

V upon the death of Gov. Donald G. Nutter, managed to hold on in a’ squeaker with Dr. Roland Renne—-offsettin_g

9' , Renne’s early lead with returns
, from the outlying districts. Bab‘-
cock nosed his way to a’ narrow

 less-than-7,000-vote victory ‘outv
‘~;_of the 272,000 cast in the gov- 7

[5 ernor’s race, which drew the
 most attention on the ballot.

Republican Winners
The only other Republicans to
survive in the Congressional or
statewide contests were U. S.
Rep. James F. Battin, re-elected
to Congress from the state’s
2nd District, Ted James, named
lieutenant governor, and state
_Auditor E. V. (Sonny) Omholt,

who was easily re-elected.
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, elected to a third
term, led the Democratic ticket,
crushing Alex Blewett of Great
Falls under a 75,000 margin of
votes. In Montana’s 1st Con-
--gressional District, Arnold Ol-
sen, the Democratic incumbent,
. defeated Wayne Montgomery
. 61,194 to 52,422—an improvement

on‘ his 5,851-vote edge over the ‘

same Republican candidate two

and extended coverage. Since
the Democratic majorities in
House and Senate, however, are
in each ‘case less than two-
thirds, Babcock’s victory and
"the threat of the gubernatorial

Mine-Mill Active
Dr. Renne, a former president
of Montana State College, was
__ endorsed and enthusiastically
«, ' supported by Mine.-Mill, which

Sen. Mansfield, Rep. Olsen, Sec-

Walter Anderson by over 30,000
votes, and A t t o r n e y General
Forrest H. Anderson, who won
by a similar margin over. Re-
publican challenger Marshall
Murray.

Switched Parties

Mine-Mill also endorsed Har-
riet Miller, who won her third
four-year term as public in-
struction superintendent a f t e 1'

switching to the Democratic-

party this year, maintaining
that the Republican party in the
state was not favorable toward
education. She swamped C. R.

Anderson, the superintendent of ’

school.s in Helena. Thomas J.
Kearney, the in cu m b ent Su-
preme Court clerk, a Democrat,
also won re-election, and had
been endorsed by Mine-Mill.

Henry H. Anderson, another
Democrat supported by the
union, defeated Republican Jack
Quilico to grasp the state treas-
urer’s post from the GOP. Mrs.
Edna Hinman, whose term ex-
pires in January, was not eligi-
ble for re-ele-ction.

The only Republican endorsed
by the Mine-Mill Legislative
Council, state Auditor Omholt
led that party’s ticket statewide
and was re-elected by 38,000
votes over Jack Holmes, carry-
ing even traditionally Demo-
cratic Silver Bow County by
9,710 to 9,360. This race marked
the first defeat for the famous
Holmes name in Montana poli-
tics. With four years still to run
in his term on the Railroad and
Public S e r v i c e Commission,

. Holmes had sought to follow in

his father’s footsteps in the au-
ditor’s post. ’

Omholt during the campaign
ran newspaper advertisements
which noted the endorsement
by the Mine-Mill statewide coun-
cil. .

R. V. Bottomly, the Demo-
cratic candidate for lieutenant

governor, who also was sup-
ported by the union, lost to
James by a narrow 5,000 votes.
Mine-Mill made no recommen-
dation in the race for a spot on
the Railroad and Public Service
Commission, won by Democrat
Paul T. Smith. Gaining his sixth
term on the commission, the
Boulder rancher outdistanced
Great Falls businessman Ernest
C. Steele by about 34,000 votes.

Judicial Race

The Butte Miners Union, Lo-
cal 1 worked for James D.
Freebourn, the son of a former
Supreme Court justice, who
edged David L. Holland in the
non-partisan race for the 2nd
District (Silver Bow County)
judgeship. During the six-month
strike of 1959-60, the Freeborn
family contributed $100 monthly
to the picketing miners and
their families—an example of

the many considerations shown '

through the years by the Free-
bourns toward the working man.

Freebourn, who appeared at
several union membership meet-
ings, told the miners that their
votes would make the differ-
ence. He defeated Holland, who
never sought the local’s en-
dorsement, by a 10,604 to 9,102
count.

Silver Bow’s total of 20,784
votes of- the 24,039 registered-
an 86.5 percentage—was close to
the top turnout among the
state’s 55 counties.

The Montana Mine-Mill Legis-
lative Council represents Local
1 in Butte, Local 16 in Great
Falls, Local 24 in Philipsburg,
Local 72 in East Helena (the

THE MIINE-MIL-I. omen:

Huge Rally lndicafes Broad
i 5uppor# for Britannia Strike  

BRITANNIA BEACH, B. C.—“Re-open Britannia mine” was the theme of a 200-car trade union

~‘cavalcade making a_ 30-mile trip‘ from Vancouver to Britannia Beach on Sunday, Nov. 1 in support
{got 350 hard-rock miners, members of Mine-Mill Local 663, now in their fourth month of a strike
against the Anaconda Company. ‘ ' _

»_ “Anaconda” has "announced thatit is closing the ‘mine, formerly owned by Howe Sound Mining
Company, rather than negotiate, further with the union. Local 663’s demands include job reclassifica-
tions and either 4a guaranteed Monday to Friday work week or premium pay for Saturday and Sun-
 « daycworkifor those whose days off would be staggered.

i Almost eiveryiunion in" the province of British Columbia was represented at the rally, described

' as the"biggest’ union ‘meeting everheld in Britannia. On Nov. 3, the Vancouver Labor Council unan-

imously adopted a resolution supporting the strikers and urging a conference between provincial

and federalauthorities “to the

-  end’ that the ‘Britannia property
"  not ‘be lost as a ‘source of-
A Wages -..to.the miners and reve-1
_nue to- the province, and that —
 a',‘_Canadian‘s will not be evicted

fromtheir homes by absentee
landlords.” _
, Union Speakers

' Craig-Pritchett of the Interna-
tional Longshoremen and Ware-
lioL1semen’s Union, Bill Schone
and Len
Birkenshaw,‘ speaking for - the

Machinists Union, addressed the Z
r Nov. 1 rally, each pledging the

full support of his organization.

-Ray ::Perrault, the leader of

the Liberal party in British Co-
lumbia, sent his regrets at not
being able to attend. He had a

‘ifew’-days earlier written to the
 < Minister of Mines for -the

province,» asking that an. in-
vestigating team be appointed

C to survey the potential ‘of the
_ Anaconda operations at Britan-

ma.

Pointing out that during the
copper price crisis in 1957 and
1958 the union had made sub-
stantial concessions in order to
keep the mine in operation, Don
Robinson, a Social Credit party
oﬁicial for the constituency,
told those attending the rally
that the company had refused
to cooperate with governmental
committees and that the situa-
tion required further investiga-
tion. .

Canadian Mine-Mill President
Ken Smith said that the mine
has produced $330 million in
mineral wealth and maintained

that it could continue to pro-
duce $8 million a year under
present day prices. -

Although mining jobs are
available in nearby communi-
ties, Britannia Beach is a com-

pany town on company prop-'

erty, so that miners and their
families are also faced with
eviction from their homes. The

In another cliffhanger of a
statewide race, Mrs. Sarah Fol-
som knocked off incumbent State
Supt. of Public Instruction W.

W. (Skipper) Dick by little over
1,000 votes out of some 461,000
ballots cast. Dick had been sup-
ported by Mine-Mill Council,
which also had little luck with
the propositions appearing on
the Nov. 3 ballot. The council
had recommendeda “No” vote
on'No. 101 and No. 200, both
of which carried. The latter
action repealed the safe crew
law- necessary to prevent a ris-
ing "tide ‘of injuries and deaths
from ‘railroad ‘accidents. ' '

' The Brotherhood of Locomo-
tive Firemen. and Enginemen,
.which is _._directly affected by
the narrow passage of Proposi-
tion 200, ‘received help from

Mine-Mill and other labor’

groups in the unsuccessful at-
tempt to defeat the amendment.

a Members of all Mine-Mill lo-
cals and ladies auxiliaries in

the state volunteered much time
during the course of the cam-
paign in promoting the candi-

dates endorsed by the council.
Social affairs were organized

to which the candidates were

invited; thousands of leaﬂets
were distributed; tours of the
plants by the candidates were
arranged; speakers were lined
up to plug candidates on radio

, discussion programs; get-out

the-vote drives involved tele-
phoning, driving people to the
polls, and door-to-door work to
remind people to vote. A

In Pinal County, where Mine-
Mill has locals at Ray, San
Manuel, and Superio-r,'the bulk
of the Democratic majorities in
most cases came from the min-

ing end of the district. Elson, ‘

defeated by a 24,000-vote mar-

gin statewide in his bid for the ~

U.S. Senate, lost only five coun-
ties while winning nine, includ-
ing Cochise, Gila, Greenlee,
Pinal, and Pima, ‘ in each of
which are situated Mine-Mill lo-
cals. — 5

Post-Election Statement Adopted by Board Dulski, Mccarthy win
Congressional Races

At Meeting in Denver From Nov. 10 to 19

DENVER, _Colo'.—-“The time is now at hand,” says a post-election statement adopted by the
Mine-Mill international executive board, “for the Congress, with better than two-to-one Demo-
cratic majorities in both houses, and the popularly supported administration to carry out the man-

date of the electorate.”

‘-Meeting in -Denver from Nov. 10 to_19, the board outlined a suggested legislative program for‘
the ,89th Congress “to build a better and stronger America and to meet the long-standing needs
ofthe members of our union in the several "branches of the non-ferrous metals industry.”

Topping the list of recommendations is enactment of the Metcalf-Montoya mine safety bill. The
board notedthat mine safety legislation is now backed by the U. S. Bureau of Mines and the U. S.

Department of the Interior.

_ Two proposals in the area of early retirement were put forth: Enactment of the King-Montoya-
Olsenbill, first introduced at the request of Mine-Mill in the 87th Congress, to amend the Social

Security Act to permit early
retirement at age 60 of miners
and workers in other hazardous
industries, and another amend-
ment to the Social Security Act
which would allow all other
workers to re_tire at age 62
without actuarial reduction of
benefits or other penalties. Such
a program, the board said,
would create additional employ-
ment opportunities for young
people just entering the labor
market. '

Taft-Hartley Repeal

The executive‘ board called
for immediate repeal of Section
14b of the Taft-Hartley Act,
which authorizes state “right-to-
work” laws. "Repeal, which was
pledged in this year's Demo-
cratic party platform, is a chief
goal of the entire labor move-
ment.

Other suggested labor legis-
lation includesiraising the mini-
mum wage to $2 an hour and
extending coverage to an addi-
tional 2.7 million workers, re-
ducing the standard work week
to 35 hours, increasing overtime
premium pay from time and a
half to double time, and creat-
ing federal standards for un-
employment compensation that
would increase benefits and
cover 3 million workers not now
covered by state programs.

The executive board urged a.

continued fight for the passage
of the medicare bill, as pledged
in the Democratic platform.
The board also called for “a
multi-billion-dollar public or works
program to be pursued until
present persistently high levels
of unemployment are substan-
tially reduced,” federal aid to
education in the areas of schol-
arships, school construction,

and teachers’ salaries a step- '
7

up in the “war on poverty”
with particular emphasis on
Appalachia, further extension of
the food stamp plan.

The abolition of the House
Un-American Activities Com-
mittee was urged, as was “a
resounding defeat for attempts
which will be made by corpor-
ate farming interests to revive
the now discredited ‘bracero’
program.”

Adoption of its proposed legis-
lative program will be made
easier by a long-needed revision
of House and Senate rules, said
the Mine-Mill board, which
called specifically for the end
of the filibuster rule in the Sen-
ate and for a restoration of the
21-day rule in the House, which
would limit to three weeks the
ability of the House Rules Com-
mittee to prevent a vote on
legislation favorably reported
by other standing committees.

In addition to reviewing the
union’s activities in bargaining
and political action, the board
heard reports from Canadian
President Kenneth Smith, who
reported on union developments
in that country, General Coun-
sel Nathan Witt, Insurance Con-
sultant Paul Pinsky, and Re-
search Director Arthur Stuart,
who predicted that the present
high levels of production in the
non-ferrous m e t a l s industry
would continue for at least the
next 18 months. .

A new budget for the coming
m-onths was approved, and the
board discussed tentative plans
for holding district conferences

V in the fairly near future.

vention was set for ‘Denver dur-

Election Day.

Hilts (D), secretary-treasurer of District 8, Council’ 9

the Oil, Chemical and Atomic

feated by Republican Henry P.

Smith in New York’s 40th Dis-_

trict, which cuts across Erie and
Niagara Counties. Hilts, who
had served on several city com-
mittees, was a member of the

Miller Loses‘ at Home
Smith won by a 76,154 to 58,352
margin, with Liberal party can-
didate James A. Peek way out
of contention. Republican Vice-

Presidential candidate William A

E. Miller had held the seat
since 1950 and while it remained
in the GOP column in terms of
the Congressional race, it was
carried by Johnson and Hum-
phrey. Miller, therefore, was the
only one of the four top candi-
dates to lose at home.

More than 300 members at-

tended the Local 593 meeting at
which the endorsements were
made. The political action com-
mittee, headed by Pat Pacile,
submitted. its recommendations,
which were enthusiastically sup-
ported on the floor.

The local supported the
J ohnson-Humphrey ticket, b ut
made no endorsement in the

.$S3Rampton Lead Ticket
 Democratic Sweep of Utah

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah-—From the presidential ticket to county commission-
Dernocrats fashioned a startling victory on Nov. 3 in this state which at. the
rt of the campaign was considered easy pickings by the Goldwater forces.
Leading the slate was U. S. Senator Frank E. Moss, who six years ago was
ed. by a minority of Utah voters when an independent candidate split the Repub-
gn vote. This year Moss, one of two. Senate sponsors of the Metcalf-Montoya mine
2 bill, polled 57 percent of the vote in crushing Dr. Ernest L. Wilkinson, a
ch conservative who is a past president of Brigham Young University.
;Five,.Mine-Mill local unions in the state endorsed not only Moss, but the entire
mo: ratic ticket for county, state, and federal office. The Utah Mine-Mill political

oordinated such activities
stration prior to the Oct.
sing date,» voter education

through leaﬂet distribution and
the introduction of candidates
to the workers at the plant gates,
and get-out-the-vote drives.

Ends ‘I6-Year Reign

Calvin L. Rampton, elected
governor to end a 16-year Repub-
lican hold on the Statehouse, ran
only slightly behind Moss. He
defeated GOP candidate Mit-
chell Meliéh, a strong Goldwater
_supporter who was backed by
the mining and oil industries in
the state.

Rampton, who has called for
the abolition of the “right-to-
work” law in Utah, for a re-
vamping of the state’s Industrial
Commission and for a program
for bringing non-military in-
dustries to Utah, will have
Democratic majorities in both
houses of the 1egislature—15 to
12 in the Senate and 38 to 31 in
the House. ,

Unlike most states where he
led the ticket, President John-
son trailed both Moss and Ramp-

gressman who sponsored an
early retirement ‘bill three years
ago, was returned to the U. S.
House of Representatives from
the 2nd District—the area in
which most Mine-Mill members
in the state are concentrated.
Unsuccessful in his bid for the
Senate two years ago, he piled
up a 149,897 to 110,831 majority
over Republican Thomas G.
Judd. King has also spoken out
in ‘favor of the Mine-Mill-backed
Metcalf-Montoya mine safety
bill. '

The only major win achieved
by the GOP was in the 1st Con-
gressional District, where Lau-
rence J.. Burton retained his
House seat with a 75,900 to 59,-
497 victory over William G.
Bruhn.

In almost every legislative
district where Mine-Mill has a
concentration of membership,
union captains were chosen to
help in the political organization.
Much of this work was co-
ordinatedwith COPE, the politi-
cal arm of the AFL-CIO.

Most of these districts not
only rolled up big Democratic
majorities for King and the
statewide candidates, but elected
Democrats to the state legisla-
ture, as follows:

"1C_t_tio,ns andp.-best «wishes. . -

 

by Asbury Howard , i
International Vice-President

AVING BEEN IN NEW YORK, New Jersey, Colorado, Ohio,"-
Illinois, Maryland, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama
prior to the general election, I should like to make some observa-
tions now that the dust is. settled. In every state and area, Mine-
Mill’s leaders worked jointly with other labor unions and com-
munity organizations to get out the vote for the “Great Society.”
It was this idea put forth by President Johnson and his sup-
port and work for peace, prosperity, Social Security, medicare for
the aged and equal treatment for all that carried for him 44 states
and the District of Columbia. Senator Goldwater, who claims
laziness is the sole reason for unemployment and poverty, who
opposes medical care for our older citizens, who wants the govern-
ment to sell TVA, did not endear himself to many with these
remarks:
“Sometimes 'I think this country would be better off if we
could just saw off the‘Eastern seaboard and let it ﬂoat out to sea.”
“We are not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964 or
1968, so we ought to go hunting where the suckers are.”
The Goldwater philosophy managed to win six states—Missis-
sippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and his own
Arizona, the latter by a razor-thin margin of 4,000 votes.

* ‘k ‘Ar ‘ .
ET EVEN THE GOLDWATER victory in the deep South bene-
fits the nation. Why? Because he helped sweep out of office
several Democratic Congressmen with
seniority ranging from 10 to 26 years, who
had opposed the administration some 70
percent of the time. Because of their lon-
gevity in Congress, they had ranked high
on important committees. But now that
power is gone.

The newly-elected Republicans, with no
seniority, will have trouble getting anything_
frofn Congress for their districts and their
states. '

Gov. George Wallace of Alabama, who
promised during the campaign that he ‘
would “shake the eye teeth of the liberals,”
was himself a shaken man on Nov. 4.

‘ air ‘It *
OUTHERNERS, WHO WERE VOTING against the new Civil
Rights Law of 1964 and for states rights, now find themselves
with less power in Congress than in many, many years.

"Charles Morgan, Jr., an attorney from Birmingham, Alabama,
blames the “isolation and ignorance” of the people, as well as their
prejudice, for their hostility to the civil rights movement. In voting
for Goldwater, they have cut off their nose to ‘spite their face.

And while this was going on, some six million Negro Ameri-
cans went to the polls to cast 95 to 98 percent of their votes for
President Johnson and his dream of the “Great Society.”

About two million of these were registered to Vote in the South,
where Negroes made great gains. For the first time since Recon-
struction, Negroes were elected to office in Macon County, Ala-
bama—-the home of Tuskeegee Institute. In Tennessee, the first
Negro member of the General Assembly will take office in January.
In Georgia, a second Negro state senator was favored by the
voters.

Outside of the South, even greater gains were made. There
will be six Negroes in the 89th Congress—-Charles C. Diggs and
John J. Conyers from Michigan, Robert Nix from Pennsylvania,
William L. Dawson from Illinois, Agustus F. Hawkins from Cali-
fornia and Adam Clayton Powell from New York.

In New Jersey, in Iowa, in Delaware,.in Kansas, newly-elected
Negroes will sit in the state legislatures. Denver, Colorado has its
first Negro district judge. And in Massachusetts, where Democrats
Lyndon Johnson and Edward Kennedy won by overwhelming mar-
gins, Republican Edward W. Brooke, a Negro incumbent attorney
general, was re-elected by a two to one majority.

« . ‘A’ ‘k ﬁr . _
HE MARCH TO POLITICAL FREEDOM for the Southern
Negro has not and will not be easy. But when it ultimately
comes, it will provide the basis for a viable two party system in‘
that area. It will also go a long way to end the killings, the bomb-
ings, the property destruction that are now wantonly engaged in
with little fear of punishment.

‘Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who bolted the Demo-
cratic party to support Barry Goldwater, blamed the defeat of
the Arizona conservative on the news media, saying, “An extreme,
radical, left-wing element controls networks, big newspapers and
magazines, and they are determined to take this country to
socialism.”

But the real truth will be there in the months ahead for all
Southerners to see-—a truth that will hopefully sweep away some of
the “ignorance” of which Mr. Morgan speaks. It is that the South
hurt itself, while helping the rest of the nation, through its actions
on- Nov. 3. Its hope for tomorrow lies in changing its voting pro-
cedures and patterns in the future.

I ‘Profit Picture Rosy

Twelve large non-ferrous metal companies reported profits for
the first nine months of 1964 which were up about 23 percent over
the same period in 1963. Higher prices for copper, lead, and zinc
and greater production this year was the explanation for the big
profit jump. Only Kennecott failed to register a gain over 1963—
due of course to the strike at Kennecott’s western properties in
July, August, and part of September, 1964. Profits by company

Proposition 14 Passage in Galitornia

Threatens Future Renewal Projects

SACRAMENTO, Calif.~—The passage of Proposition 14, which
repeals this state's law against discrimination in housing, was one
bitter pill in the otherwise delectable feast enjoyed by liberal
forces throughout the country on Nov. 3.

“I am disappointed,” said Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, who
led the statewide battle against the amendment, “but I‘ do not
regard the election as the end of California’s fight against dis-
crimination and segregation in housing.”

About 3.5 million voters supported Proposition 14, which
was placed on the ballot through a petition drive led by the Cali-
fornia_Rea1 Estate Asociation, with less than 2 million opposed.
A" similar amendment nullifying thefair housing law in Akron,
Ohio was approved by the voters.

Real estate industry spokesmen have already indicated that
their success in California and Akron may spark similar drives
elsewhere. 17 states and more than 60 cities throughout the country

chairmen tor the- Congressional District.

  

have passed fair housing legisla-
tion, with many of the laws.
covering private housing, as
well as public.

Already the Federal Housing
and Home Finance Agency has
said that it will refuse to sign
and finance new urban renewal
contracts because of the cloud-
ed legal situation, although it
will allow the continuation of
five renewal projects already
underway. They will involve a
total of about $58 million. The
federally-assisted urban renew-
al program requires a non-dis-
crimination clause in all con-
tracts.

The courts are expected to be
handed the case of Proposition
14, both as to its constitutional-
ity and -the conflict that it pre-
sents with laws regulating fed-
eral financing.

The Bay Area Mine-Mill politi-
cal action committee, represent-
ing locals at San Francisco,
Selby and Richmond, joined with
other labor groups in the region
in attempting to defeat the “big-
otry amendment.”

Arizona and North Dakota, also
repealed the law regulating the
size of railroad train crews. The
vote gives management the
right to slash manpower, with
disregard for safety.

The Johnson-Humphrey ticket,
which had been endorsed by the
Mine-Mill group and all other
labor groups in the state, re-
ceived 3,958,150 Votes or 59.8
percent——somewhat below their
margin nationally. At the same
time, Republican former song
and dance man George Murphy

defeated Pierre Salinger in the 0

race for the U. S. Senate seat.

State Senator George Miller,
Jr., described as “the best sen-
ator in California in the eyes of
the labor movement” at a Mine-
Mill meeting in September, was
re-elected.

Two Burtons Elected

U. S. Rep. Phillip Burton
from San Francisco’s 5th Dis-
trict, elected to fill a vacancy
only last year, was returned to
the House. He made an impres-
sive debut in 1963 with his first
speech in Congress—an attack
on the House,Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee. He was the
only anti-HUAC Congressman on
the floor‘ when the House leader-
ship attempted to sneak through
a measure providing appropria-
tions for the committee. Only
Burton’s speech prevented what
would have been a misleading
unanimous vote.

John L. Burton, a younger
brother of the Congressman,
and Willie Brown, a young Negro
attorney, willbe two new faces
in the state House of Repre-
Both strongly sup-

Mineral Explorations in Australia

Australia is in the mining news this month. Kennecott has i

‘ formed a_ new subsidiary, Kennecott Exploration (Australia) Pro-
. prietary Limited, to explore for mineral deposits in the land of
_ the kangaroos. Frank Milliken, Kennecott president, said his com-
“-'pany"*would welcome the participation of Australian companies or
 individual investors in the development of any mineral deposits
' that might be discovered. ‘

In another development, it has been announced that Cerro
orporation, Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, an Aus-
*‘Tt’1'alian subsidiary of Freeport Sulphur Company (U.S.), Oblebay
Norton Co. of Cleveland, Ohio (an iron ore company), and British
” and Australian interests have formed a consortium to explore for
base metals in New South Wales and South Australia.

4‘   Further Squeeze on Lead Threatene

 _ U. S. lead exports in September, mostly in the form of scrap,
r_ were greater than total U. S. lead exports for the year 1963. The
 volume of September exports was only about 5,000 tons, but the
‘upward trend began in August and threatens to climb. Reason
forthe increased exports is the higher price of lead in London as
compared with the U. S., and the strong demand for scrap by
European and Japanese smelters._

A If the trend in exports continues, it could put another squeeze
 the already tight market for lead in the United States, and
create real problems for secondary lead smelters which are al-
,,a'dy short of enough scrap to refine to meet their customer

demands.

Fight Against 

Tuberculosis Far
From Over Here

After a 12-year decline, tuber-
culosis is on the rise in 31 major
American cities at rates of in-
crease as high as 50 percent.
Nationally, the number of new
cases reported increased to
54,000'in 1963.

Although anti-TB drugs have
done wonders, tuberculosis and
other respiratory diseases ac-

count for 175,000 deaths annual--

ly, trailing only cancer, heart
disease, and stroke.

A highly contagious disease,
frequently attacking several
members of the same family,
tuberculosis thrives on poverty.
Overcrowding, poor ventilation,
inadequate diet, ignorance of
simple hygiene—a1l produce con-
ditions favorable to its spread.

Not difficult to diagnose, its
classical symptoms were de-
scribed 4600 years ago on a
Babylonian tablet: “The sick

one coughs frequently, his spu- _

turn is thick and sometimes con-
tains blood . . . his skin is cold
but his feet are hot and he
sweats greatly.”

Early Diagnosis Needed

And yet, in spite of greatly
increased knowledge, two out of
every three TB victims diag-
nosed each year already have
reached the stage described
above—a situation that could be
avoided if everyone were to
have a routine chest X-ray once
a year. The present anti-TB
drugs do not kill the bacillus,
but only inhibit its multiplica-
tion while giving the body a

chance to fight back. Their ef-‘

fectiveness, therefore, is de-
pendent on early diagnosis.

Some 35,000,000 Am eri c ans

.2

(one out of every three adults ,-

over 25) have at some time been
exposed to TB germs, and are
therefore ‘more susceptible to
its potential for becoming ac-
tive.

Perhaps some day, like small-
pox and plague, tuberculosis
will be a disease chiefly of his-
torical interest. But a bold at-
tack is needed now, before, as
many scientists expect, further
bacterial resistance to anti-TB
drugs develops.

Funds from the annual Christ-
mas Seal campaign help finance
the additional research in this
field that is needed immediately.
