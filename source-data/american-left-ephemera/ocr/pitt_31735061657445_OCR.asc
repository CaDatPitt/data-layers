attributed to the conspiracy? Far from it. They
are views on a highly political level.

cc ARALLELISM” AS EXPOUNDED BY PROF.

MOSELY—-The Government’s star witness
was Philip Mosely, Professor of International Rela-
tions at Columbia University‘ and Director of its
Russian Institute. He was presented as an objec-
tive witness, an expert-——neither an FBI.‘ agent
not an informer. He was on the witness stand
between three and four weeks. He testified that
on 45 international issues, starting with the League
of Nations in 1918 to the Korean War in 1953,
the Communist Party U.S.A. and the Soviet
Union had taken similar stands.

They included: West Germany; the Italian elec-
tions of 1948; the North Atlantic Pact; control
of atomic energy; election of Yugoslavia to the
United Nations Security Council; the Cardinal
Mindszenty case of 1949; United Nations action
in Korea; Communist China’s seating in the
United Nations; peace treaty with Japan, 1951;
peace in Korea. Amazing was Prof. Mosely’s ref-
erence to an article by George Bernard Shaw,
quoted by IZVESTIA, but published in the British
magazine, STATESMAN AND NATION. He said
that while it is not a Communist publication in
the sense that it is not issued by the Communist
Party of ‘Great Britain, nevertheless, in some as-
pects of its policies and recommendations it tends
from time to time to parallel many of the Soviet
recommendations. This must have been news in
London! An unlimited number of American
liberal j0u1'nals——THE NATION, THE NEW REPUB-
LIC, THE PROGRESSIVE, HARPER’S—-Could be simi-
larly accused under the McCarran Act.

The attorneys of the Communist Party pointed
out that in 27 of the 45 instances cited by Prof.
Mosely, the Communist Party of the U.S.A. had
spoken first, so their position antedated that of
the Soviet Union. How could the Party have fol-'
lowed when it led? This reasoning was rejected
by the Board and later by Justice Felix Frank-
furter in his decison as follows:

"The government expressly cliiclaimed any
attempt to eitahlirh chronological Jequence be-
tween the announced position: of the two.”

The Party’s attorneys argued on. the reasonable-
ness of the positions taken by the Party and that‘
similar views on these issues were expressed by

 

 

many other groups, individuals and publications.
This was also brushed aside.

Prof. Mosely was asked by the Party’s attor-
neys whether in each case he cited, an informed
American observer, in the exercise of independent
judgment and sensitive to the best interests of the
United States, might not also reasonably have ar-
rived at the views held by the Party and the
Soviet Union. The Board rejected this question,
and Justice Frankfurter upheld its exclusion as
proper: "to avoid opening the sluices to litigation
of the views of a multitude of third parties.”

Prof. Mosely’s parallelisms ended about 1953.
Many things have changed in ten years. If he
were called upon today to chart accurate parallels
with the Soviet Union, they would include the
words of hundreds of scientists, writers, religious
and political leaders, here and elsewhere, includ-
ing Pope John XXIII. The list could start with
President John F. Kennedy who wrote to Premier
Nikita S. Khrushchev on December 28, 1962:
"There appear to he no diﬂerencer between your
view: and mine regarding the need for elimination
of war in this nuclear age.” And there is now
the nuclear test ban treaty signed jointly by the
two countries and England. Prof. Mosely has par-
ticipated in several conferences with Soviet ex-
perts—in 1960 at Dartmouth College; in 1961
in the Crimea, USSR; in 1962 at Andover. Topics
discussed were international peace and coopera-
tion, peaceful coexistence, business and cultural
relations of the U.S.A. and -the U.S.S.R. Prof.
Vladimir Kavenov, reporting the Andover con-

. ference in the Moscow News of November 24,

1962, said: "Sensible agreement was reached on
Cuba.” (So one might ask Prof. Mosely today:
"Who's parallel now?”)

3. Proceedings Against
so-called “Front”
(Drganizations

TESTS OF WHAT MAKES ONE A COMMUNIST-
-‘In add-ition to proceedings against the Com-
munist Party, the S.A.C.B. also moved against a
number of so-called “Front organizations.” Ten
were driven to dissolve by such harassment. Three
ﬁled legal appeals against the Board’s decisions.
They are: The American Committee for Protec-
-tion of the Foreign-Born, the National Council
of American-Soviet Friendship* and the Veterans
of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. An old and
militant union, the Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers Union, is also charged with being "Com-
munist inﬁltrated” and is appealing this ﬁnding
in the courts. Under a 1954 amendment, called
the “Communist Control Act,” teeth were added
to the McCarran Act in a provision that a labor
organization which the Board determines is "Com-
munist inﬁltrated,” shall be ineligible to use the
National Labor Relations Board or any other
facilities under the National Labor Relations Act.
This menaces the rights of all labor unions. This
law laid down tests of membership as follows:

“SEC. 5. In determining membership in the
Communist Party, evidence shall be considered
as to whether the accused person:

1) has been listed as a member in any book
or any of the lists, records, correspondence
or any other documents of the organization

2) has made ﬁnancial contributions to the
organization in dues, assessments, loans or
in any other form V

3) has made himself subject to the discipline
of the organization in any form whatso-
ever

4) has executed orders, plans or directives
of any kind of the organization

5) has acted as an agent, courier, messenger,
correspondent, organizer, or in any other
capacity in behalf of the organization

6) has conferred with oﬂilcers or other mem-
bers of the organization in behalf of any
plan or enterprise of the organization

7) has been accepted to his knowledge as an
oﬂicer or member of the organization or

‘* O_n May 16, 1963, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington overturned the ruling of the S.A.C.B.
against the National Council of American-Soviet Friend-
ship, stating succinctly: "Probative evidence in this
record is negligible."

as one to be called upon for services by
other oﬂicers or members of the organiza-
tion

8) has written, spoken or in any other way
‘ communicated by signal, semaphore, sign
or in any other form of communication,
orders, directives or plans of the organi-
zation

9) has prepared documents, pamphlets, leaf-
lets, books or any other type of publica-
tion in behalf of the objectives and pur-
poses of the organization

10) has mailed, shipped, circulated, distributed,
delivered, or in any other way sent or de-
livered to others material or propaganda
of any kind in behalf of the organization

\11) has advised, counseled or in any other way
imparted information, suggestions, recom-
mendations to oﬂicers or members of the
organization or to anyone else in behalf
of the objectives of the organization

12) has indicated by word, action, conduct,
writing or in any other way a willingness to
carry out in any manner or to any degree
the plans, designs, objectives or purposes
of the organization

13) has in any other way participated in the
activities, planning, actions, objectives or

A purposes of the organization

14) the enumeration of the above subjects of
evidence on membership or participation
in the Communist Party or in any other
organization as above deﬁned, shall not
limit the inquiry into and consideration
of any other subject of evidence on mem-
bership and participation as herein stated.

Anyone could be ruled to be a Communist
under such tests. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
stated in an editorial it could easily qualify since
both it and the Communist Party are out to elimi-
nate juvenile delinquency. A business agent of
the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers
of America in Milwaukee—]ack Killian—was
found guilty of perjury under the Taft-Hartley
Law. He had sworn he was not a Communist
Party member. The judge instructed the jury to
determine whether Killian is a member by these
criteria. He made one change—-“he left out the
word "semaphore.” But the Supreme Court, by a
5-to-4 vote in 1962, upheld the judge's instruc-
tions as proper, and the conviction was upheld.
One need never to have joined the Communist
Party to be a Communist under this law.

Ew “FRONT” UNDER FIRE—-—T-he most recent
citation by the S.A.C.B., the ﬁrst in 1963 as
well as in a number of years, is directed against
a group of progressive young students and work-
ers, called “ADVANCE.” Organized in 1960, it can
hardly 'be accused of parallelism with an earlier
period when these youths were children in school.
Therefore, they are accused of parallelism with
recent views of the Communist Party, dealing
with modern political problems, such as: 1) op-
posing the United States-Japanese Security Pact;
2) calling for non-intervention in Cuban affairs
and the restoration of diplomatic relations with
Cuba, and protesting the blockade of Cuba in
October, 1962; 3) demanding an end to nuclear
testing ‘by the United States; 4) opposing the en-
forcement of the Smith Act and the McCarran
Act; 5) opposing legislation on Universal Mili-
tary Training and Selective Service; 6) advocat-
ing the withdrawal of American armed forces
from Berlin and urging the United States to ac-
cept the offer of the U.S.S.R. to “negotiate on
Berlin." Hundreds of Americans have expressed
views identical with one or another which these
young people have voiced. This would include

Robert Kennedy Changes The Law

Under Section 7, deﬁning the method of regis-
tration required of a Communist Action Or-
ganization, it is stated that “a form” shall be
prescribed by the Attorney General. For 10
years, up to two days before the Supreme Court
decision was reaﬂirmed in October, 1961, one
form was required. Then a second form was
added by Attorney General Kennedy, which re-
quired the organization to give its name, address
and to acknowledge that it is such an organization
as characterized in the law.

Did the Attorney General have a legal right to
change the law, adding new counts to possible in-
dictments and thereby increasing the penalties?

How can Americans justify, in other coun-
tries or in our own, a law that conceals what
one astonished newspaper reporter at a Gus Hall
news conference called “a booby" trap”? An-
other said: "It's hell if you do and hell if you
don’t. Register and you are a criminal, refuse to
register and you are a criminal!” A Communist is
denied employment in thousands of plants classi-
ﬂed as "defense," and workers have already been
discharged under this rule. As Justice Hugo
Black said in his dissent from the Supreme Court
majority opinion: "The Act that make: it ex-
tremely difﬁcult for at member of the Communist
Party to live in this country, and, at the Jame time,
mehes it 4 crime for him to get a passport to
get out.”

 

members of Congress, religious and labor leaders,
scientists, professors, writers, editors, peace advo-
cates—as well as Communists. By the logic of the
Attorney General, all such persons should be liable

, to S.A.C.B. citations.

A new wrinkle in this last citation of “AD-
VANCE” is opposition to the McCarran Act. Is it
reasonable that those who are targets of the Mc-
Carran Act should favor it? This is a far-reaching
prohibition—that to oppose a law and work for its
repeal is to violate it! A pamphlet of the Civil
Liberties Union of Massachusetts prophesied in
1952 as follows: “Even working for the repeal
of this McCarran Law might be held to be aiding
Communism!” Recently nine hundred distin-
guished Americans petitioned President Kennedy
to nullify this Act. Are they to be considered
violators of the law? The question under the Mc-
Carran Act is not, as many believe, whether you
agree with the basic Marxist-Leninist -theories of
the Communist Party U.S.A.; it -is whether your
views coincide with the Party’s views on current

political issues, international and dome-stic—on‘

peace, civil rights of Negro Americans, rights of
labor, unemployment, and now opposition to the
McCarran Act.

The citation against “ADVANCE” opens up the
McCarran Act ﬂood-gates against non-Commu-
nists or even anti~Comrnunists. No one is safe
under the t/areat of ''parallelism.’’ It can silence
political expression in the U.S.A. It is the chief
weapon of the McCarran Act today, to be exposed
and defeated. The youth of today are no longer
the silent generation ' of the McCarthy period.
They are determined to hear, to speak, to demon-
strate. As Prof. Thomas I. Emerson of Yale Law
School puts it: "One can only -hope that the criti-
cal state of domestic and world affairs, and the
recent arousal of interest in these problems by
some of our younger citizens, will call forth the
counter-force necessary to resist these efforts to
curtail traditional liberties.”

4. Penalties

TWO-EDGED sWORD—T0 REGISTER OR NOT TO

REGIsTER——The McCarran Act is unique in
its two-way penalties. It punishes for compliance
and it punishes for non-compliance. If an or-
ganization registers, one set of penalties follows;
if it refuses to register there are other penalties.
To illustrate: if the Communist Party U.S.A.
were to comply with the registration order, this
would be an admission of criminal conspiracy.
The Party would then -be required to furnish a list
of its members, its ﬁnancial records, printing and

I3

mimeographing machines, and other technical
equipment, and could be prosecuted for false or
inaccurate statements. It would be required to
label its mail, literature and publications. Regard-
less of whether it registers or not, its members are
prohibited from working for the federal govern-
ment or in facilities listed as essential to defense
by the Secretary of Defense, reported as 4,000 to
date. They are also prohibited from securing or
using a passport.

To register under the McCarran Act as 3. Com-
munist is to render oneself liable to criminal
prosecution under the membership section of the
Smith Act and also under a section (4a) of the
McCarran Act itself which makes conspiracy to
set up a totalitarian dictatorship unlawful. It is
obvious to any reasonable person that no one in
his right mind would register under these cir-
cumstances and that those ordered to do so prop-
erly invoke the Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination.

The Department of Justice has attempted to
becloud the issue of what registration means in
this case. Attorney General Robert Kermedy has
asserted that it’s like any other form of registra-
tion, such as for ownership of stocks and bonds.
He reiterates that the Communist Party U.S.A.
is not outlawed by any of this legislation. Mr.
Kirk Maddrix, the government attorney in the re-
cent trial of the Communist Party U.S.A. before
Judge Alexander Holtzoff in Washington, D. C.,
in December, 1962, for failure to register, argued
that registration is not a confession of criminality
and that “you are not registering that you are a
Communist Action Organization, but only that
you have been found :0 by the Subversive Activi-
ties Control Board and therefore are merely com-
plying with the law."

Such crude sophistry on the part of a respon-
sible legal spokesman for the U.S. Government
is double-talk of a low order! For a Communist to
register is to defame himself, to make a public
confession to What he does not -believe, to accept
a characterization the C.P.U.S.A. has rejected and
fought against for thirteen years. And unless the
Communist Party, its oﬂicers and members are
willing to admit to the criminal characterizations
attributed to them in the McCarran Act they face
fantastic penalties.

MOCKERY OF A TRIAL——This was the first time
a political party had ever been placed on
trial in our country. Political liberty and major
constitutional issues were at stake. There was
world-wide interest, an-d it was expected that the

I4

"' _ F/uni’:

issues which the Supreme Court had postponed
as "premature” in June, 1961, would now be
heard.

But nothing of the kind happened. The trial
of the Communist Party U.S.A. consumed only
ten hours of actual trial time. It was restricted
by the court to a narrow, routine question which
was not in dispute, namely, whether or not the
Party had registered. The judge refused to inter-
rogate the prospective jurors on possible preju-
dice. He said: "You murt realize this, gentlemen,
that every person in the United Stater, or mort of
the people in the United Stater, who are not either
member: of the C ommunirt Party or rympathizerr
with it, are oppored to it. Everybody is opposed to
murder, hut that doe: not disqualify people op-
pored to murder from ritting ar jurors.” So that
was that. The Communist Party was analogous to
murder!

The Government produced one witness, Will
Lissner of The New York TIMES, to testify on
a press conference of June 8, 1961, at which Gus
Hall, spokesman of the C.P.U.S.A., had stated
that the McCarran Act is the Big Lie and that the
Party would not register. The Party had Written
a letter to the Department of Justice, so stating,
and this was introduced as evidence. The Judge
remarked to the Government lawyers in relation
to the witness: "A: a matter of fact, you do not
need all of thir evidence at all. You have the let-
ter in which they refured to regirter. That it
enough. But you have the right to put flerh on the

IS

 

skeleton if you with.” It was truly a skeleton
trial. All constitutional questions were ruled out.
An appeal from the conviction and the maximum
ﬁne of $120,000 is before the Court of Appeals
at this writing. It will go to the U.S. Supreme
Court, if necessary. ~

SSUE OF THE PARTY’s COURT APPEAL-—Many
Americans mistakenly believe that the Com-
munist Party had been tried ﬁrst, before being
called upon to register. But no such proceedings
occurred.

Besides this major contention, other questions
raised on the appeal are that the registration re-
quirements violate the 5th Amendment; the ille-
gality of requiring the C.P.U.S.A. to identify itself
as a criminal organization; the denial by the trial
judge of an adequate examination of prospective
jurors; the presence of government em-ployees on
the Grand Jury and the court's refusal to grant
a hearing on this issue; the absence of an evil
motive and the justifiable reason for the failure of
the Party to register; the impossible demands for
information on the registration statement, which
the Party could not obtain, even if it were willing
to register; the violation of the 8th Amendment,
in the excessive ﬁne imposed.

The Time is NOW

Justice Frankfurter said in his majority Su-
preme Court decision: “If in future years, in a
future world situation, the Soviet Union is no
longer the foreign country to which paragraph
2—( 1) and (4) fairly read in their context, refer,
that too will be a matter of statutory construc-
tion which no ‘findings’ in the statute foreclose. ‘
The Board or a reviewing Court will be able
to say that the ‘World Communist movement’
as Congress meant the term in 1950 . . . no
longer exists."

The C.P.U.S.A. contends that no such move-
ment existed in 1950 or before or since. The U.S.
Government has better relations with the Soviet
Union in 1963 than it had in 1950. The impera-
tive need for peaceful coexistence and disarma-
ment is mutually recognized. Why should the
possibility of expanding understanding between
the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. be jeopardized by
this insulting law, whose gross libels are not
capable of proof? Surely, the time is now for the
Supreme Court and the President of the U.S.A.
to say that no such ''findings’’ exist and the law
is to be declared null and void.

5. Issues Now in the Courts

HE GUS HALL AND BENJAMIN J. DAVIS IN-
DICTMENTS-—T-W0 leading spokesmen of the
Communist Party, Gus Hall and Benjamin J. Davis,
were indicted on March 15, 1962, for failure to
register under the McCarran Act. The indictment
contains six counts. In the event of a verdict of
guilty, they would face prison terms of 30 years
and $60,000 ﬁnes. The dates for their trials have
not yet been set. The Government attorneys
on July 26, 1963, moved in the District Trial
Court to argue the preliminary motions. But the
judge ruled that the Party case must be decided
ﬁrst, before this one can proceed—which means
in the Fall of 1963, or Spring of 1964.
Twenty-seven other persons have been cited
by the Subversive Activities Control Board to ap-
pear before them, on the request of the Attorney
General, charged with membership in the Com-
munist Party and therefore subject to the regis-
tration requirements of the McCarran Act. Those
thus cited to appear are as follows:

From New York City—William Albertson, Mil-
dred McAdory, Miriam Friedlandet, Arnold
Johnson, Lionel Libson, William L. Patterson,
Irving Potash, Daniel Rubin, Betty Gannett
Tormey, James J. Tormey, Louis Weinstock,
William W. Weinstone;

From Calz'fomz'a—-Ben Dobbs, Flora Hall, Dorothy
Healey, Sam Kushner, Albert J. Lima, Roscoe
Proctor, William C. Taylor;

From Penmylt/am'a——Frances Gabow, Aaron Lib-
son, Thomas Nabried;

From Illinoi.t——Sarn K. Davis, Claude Lightfoot;

From Maryland—-George A. Meyers;

From Texa.r—John W. Stanford;

From War/Jington State—Burt Nelson.

Of these respondents, six had been previously
dismissed on Smith Act conspiracy charges after
the Supreme Court had reversed the convictions
of the California victims, and one had been
freed of a membership charge under the Smith
Act. It would seem that in these cases, at least,
double jeopardy—being tried twice for the same
charge—is involved. Eleven of the respondents
have been active for years in the trade union move-
ment. Six are Negro leaders. Six are women.

A campaign for Roscoe Proctor has been sup-
ported by trade unions and the Negro community
in the Bay area of Northern California. His union

Union) has endorsed his defense. The Ministerial
Alliance sent an observer to his hearing, who ex-
pressed his shock at the nature of the case and the
so-called "evidence” against Mr. Proctor. The evi-
dence showed that his activities were in cam-
paigns against the McCarran Act, for peace, for
his union and for civil rights for Negro Ameri-
cans, and that $38,000 had been paid to two stool-
pigeons—-a husband and wife——for this evidence.

OUBLB _]EOPARDY—-For seven years the De-

partment of Justice tried unsuccessfully to
convict Claude Lightfoot, Negro leader in Chi-
cago, under the Communist membership section
of the Smith Act. The case was ﬁnally dismissed.
Now they are trying to force him to register as a
member under the McCarran Act, on -penalty of
a prison sentence, a charge which they themselves
were not able to prove in two trials.

The Chicago committee for his defense calls
this "a device for do-it-yourself imprisonment.”
'Ilhe Chicago Negro community was shocked at
this vindictive vendetta and at the stool-pigeon
witnesses against him.

One was a retired steel worker, a friend of
Lightfoot for thirty years, who admitted to long
years in the F.B.I. pay. A woman witness was an
officer in a leading Negro organization, who ad-
mitted to spying in eight other organizations be-
sides -the Communist Party. While persecution of
people whose only crime is their political prin-
ciples continues, self-proclaimed Nazis and fas-
cists march through our streets in uniform, picket
and insult attendants at meetings of which they
disapprove and threaten violence to Negroes,
Jews and others. They are challenged neither by
the enforcers of the McCarran Act nor its un-
savory sponsors——the House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee.

(The McCarran Act) marks a major break
in the wall designed by the First Amendment
to keep this country free by leaving the peo-
ple free to talk about any kind of change in
basic governmental policies they desire to talk
about. I see no way to escape the fateful con-
sequences of a return to the era of the Alien
and Sedition Acts (1789-1801), in which all
government critics had to face the probabil-
ity of being sent to jail.

—-Justice Hugo L. Black

 

TIME TABLE ON LEGAL CASES——Supreme Court
Justice" Robert H. Jackson once said: "The
rig/at: of all are tied up in the same bundle wit}:
the Communists.” Victory for the Communist
Party would be the death knell of the McCarran
Act and its prototypes in several Southern states,
which threaten the militant Negro organizations

ﬁghting for full equality. The many-pronged,

proceedings of the Government under the Mc-
Carran Act appear -to be geared to a dramatic
climax in 1964, an election year. But this trend
can be reversed and defeated. The attempted
enforcement of this cumbersome fascist-like edict
is an irritant to international relations, a threat to
Americans, a hangover from Hitler and Mc-
Carthy. It brings no credit to the Kennedy ad-
ministration and is sharply criticized in many
lands. It is a concession to the Ultra-Right and
should be abandoned as an onslaught upon the
Bill of Rights. It would be political sagacity to
junk it before the elections.

The principal legal issues at present are:

1) The appeal of the Communist Party U.S.A.
against its conviction and a ﬁne of $120,000
for failure to register under the McCarran
Act. This case was argued on June 25,
1963, by Attorneys John Abt and Joseph
Forer. No decision has yet been given by
the Appeals Court.

2) The trials of Gus Hall and Benjamin J.
Davis on an indictment for failure to regis-
ter. These have been postponed pending the
above, as already described in this pam-
phlet.

3) The court appeal against the Subversive
Activities Control Board order to the ten
ﬁrst individuals cited to register as mem-
bers. This will be heard by the Appeal Court
on October 28, 1963, in the form of a test
case of two of them, William Albertson
and Roscoe Proctor. Since the issue of the
constitutionality of this section of the Law
will be decided by this appeal, which will
go to the Supreme Court if necessary, fur-
ther citations should in all decency be post-
poned. With seventeen more added hear-
ings, such persecution could go on indeﬁ-
nitely, ultimately involving hundreds of
people. The testimony of one F.B.I. stool-
pigeon is accepted by the S.A.C.B. as sulﬁ-

cient proof of membership. It is a con-
temptible form of harassment, burdening
people with hearings and heavy legal ex-
penses for appeals.

PASSPORT CASES—-The suit of Dr. Herbert
Aptheker and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn against
Secretary of State Dean Rusk for a restora-
tion of their passports, revoked under the
McCarran Act. 'I‘«his case was argued on
July 12, 1963, before a special panel made
up of three Federal judges, because of con-
stitutional issues. On July 17th it was de-
cided adversely. The decision stated that the
two persons came under the operation of
the Law and did not suffer infringements of
their constitutional rights when their pass-
ports were taken away. An appeal from
this ruling now goes to the U.S. Supreme
Court. It will be the ﬁrst test case of the
McCarran Act passport restrictions. At least
ten other persons are immediately affected
and the right of all Americans to travel
freely is at stake. A veritable gem of judi-
cial "wisdom” was expressed in the opinion
by Judge Leonard P. Walsh as follows:
"There has been no evidence offered or ad-
duced that the ‘leopard’ of the world Com-
munist movement has changed a single
spot in the past thirteen years not would
common sense nor common knowledge in-
dicate such change.”

THE ROBEL CASE: ARRESTED FOR WORK-
ING——The McCarran Act, through the De-
partment of Justice, struck in a shocking
manner on May 21, 1963, in Seattle, Wash-
ington: a shipyard machinist, Eugene F.
Robel, was arrested at work by the F.B.I.
He was indicted by a federal grand jury
on the charge of "Illegally maintaining
employment in a defenre facility w/aile con-
tinuing to be a member of t/ye Commaniit
Party.” Mr. Robel was jailed over night in
lieu of $10,000 bail demanded by the gov-
ernment. The next day Federal Judge Lind-
berg, who had been the trial judge a decade
ago in the unsuccessful Seattle Smith Act
trial, released him on his own recogni-
zance. The Federal prosecutor protested
that this was the ﬁrst test of this section
of the Law and high bail should be re-
quired. " A

A local TV station interviewed Robel
on his release. He said: "I have a wife and

a second-hand car. I have $300 in the bank
and $26 in my pocket. I have been singled
out for a test case because I am a poor man
with no money to defend myself. The only
charge against me is that I was working.”
The federal prosecutor concedes that there
are no other charges. Robel was called be-
fore the House Un-American Activities
Committee in 1955, where he refused to
discuss his political views under the Fifth
Amendment’s protection against self-in-
crimination. He was expelled by the Ma-
chinists’ Union in consequence during the
height of McCarthyism. But no attempts
were made then to deprive him of his job.
No date has been set for his trial.

If the U.S. Supreme Court had faced up
to its full responsibility in 1961, and passed
then on the constitutionality of all sections
of the McCarran Act, as requested by the
Communist Party’s attorneys, this country
would not today be faced before the world
with the disgraceful fact that a man is ar-
rested "for working”—not for any mis-
conduct on his job, but solely because of
his alleged political views!

6. (Ipposition to the Act

_OPPos1noN TO THE MCCARRAN Ac'r——'I‘he
forerunner of the McCarran Act was the
Mundt-Nixon Bill, defeated in 1949. Fifty-seven
Senators and 286 members of the House voted to
over-ride President Truman's veto of the McCarran
Act. Among those who upheld the veto were
Representatives Adam Clayton Powell (D.-N.Y.),
Arthur Klein (D.-N.Y.), F. D. Roosevelt, Jr. (D.-
N.Y.), Emanuel Celler (D.-N.Y.) and Jacob Ja-
vits (R.-N.Y.); Mary Norton (D.-NJ.) and
Willimn L. Dawson (D.-Ill.); also Senators Paul
H. Douglas (D.-Ill.), Hubert H. Humphrey (D.-
Minn.), Herbert Lehman (D.-N.Y.) and Estes
Kefauver (D.-Tenn.). John F. Kennedy, then a
young Representative from Massachusetts, voted to
over-ride the veto.

President Truman said in his veto message: "It
would put the government of the United States
in the thought control business,” and further, "It
would require the Department of Iustice and the
F.B.I. to waste immense amounts of time and en-
ergy attempting to carry out its unworhahle reg-
istration provisions,” and further: "The hill would
open up a Pandora’: hox of opportunities for of-
ﬁcial condemnation of organizations and individ-
uals for perfectly honest opinions which happen

2|

to be stated also by Communists.” President Tru-
man called attention to the "flagrant violation
of proper security safegzmrds” in this law? s provi-
sion for a public catalogue of defense facilities
and Congress was compelled recently to correct
this piece of stupidity by authorizing the Defense
Secretary to handle it without publicity.

Many newspapers have expressed adverse and
critical editorial opinions on the McCarran Act,
among them the New York Times, Philadelphia
Inquirer, Washington Post, Christian Science
Monitor, St. Louis Glohe-Democrat, St. Louis Post-
Dirpatch, Dayton Daily N ew:, Chattanooga Times,
Wilmington Journal. Many prominent individuals
—lawyers, educators, ministers, and labor leaders
—have spoken out against this law here and in
other countries. Petitions have been addressed
to President Kennedy from England, France, Italy,
Ireland, Indonesia, Sweden, and the Socialist coun-
tries. Committees of sympathy have been formed
in many American cities as well as in London,
Berlin, Paris and others abroad.

Some Grim Jokers in The Act

There are many weird sections of the Mc-
Carran Act such as the following: “Nothing
shall be construed in any way to limit or in-
fringe upon freedom of the press or speech,
as guaranteed by the Constitution of the
United States and no regulation shall be pro-
mulgated hereunder having that eﬁect.”

Another section reads: “It shall be unlaw-
ful for any oﬂicer or employee of the
United States to issue a passport to, or re-
new a passport of, any individual, knowing
or having reason to believe that such indi-
vidual is a member of such organization”
(Communist action). How can the gov-
ernment employee be expected to know all
the Communists in the U.S.A.? How could
he decide?

According to Section 4-, it is unlawful to
agree to any act which would contribute to
a totalitarian dictatorship in the U.S.A. But
there is an odd proviso: “this subsection
shall not apply to the proposal of a consti-
tutional amendment.”

Just what does this mean———that a Nazi
dictatorship could be legislated into being by
a legal constitutional amendment?

Finally, there is a provision that “if any
section of Title I or the application to any
person or circumstances, is held invalid,
the remaining provisions of this title, or the
application to other persons or circumstances
shall not be aﬁected.” President Truman
was right when he said this litigation could
go on for years, as it has already. An act
of Congress or of the President, or a ﬁnal
Supreme Court action rejecting the Law in
its entirety, would be immediate ways to
abolish this omnibus piece of legislation.

7. Victory Com Be Won

IT IS NOT EASY for most Americans to appreciate
the effect of legislation directed against polit-
ical and racial minorities. After all, it may not im-
mediately alfect you. -

Many have learned to live within the ethical
and moral fences of our time. Confronted with
equally unattractive choices at the polls, unap-
pealing alternatives in our daily lives, we have
made our peace. The “emergency" is not yet here:
our homes have not yet been bombed, our families
terrorized, our children jibed at in school, our
very existence as social beings threatened. “There
is still time . . 

It is the point of this booklet that time is run-
ning out.

The McCarran Act sets tighter borders upon
freedom of thought for all Americans.

It prescribes a code by means of which ideas
can be tested.

It outlaws, for the ﬁrst time in American his-
tory ,a political party, whose views are not uncon-
stitutional.

It abolishes the right of travel for many native-
born citizens. ~

It defines standards under which every act,
every tbougbt, can come under legal scrutiny, test-
ing individual agreement with a preconceived set
of standards of citizenship.

And it provides “concentration camps” for dis-
senters.

What would be improved in America if all
Communists—the immediate target of the Act—
and their allies were jailed?

Would tbe problem of unemployment be ap-
preciably alleviated?

Would tbe pligbt of tbe aged and inﬁrm be im-
proved?

Would members of trade union-s be more free?
Tbe foreign-born more secure?

Would tbe Negro people face a brigbter dawn
in Birmingbam tomorrow?

Would tbe prospects of a world witbout war be
increased? Tbe crime rate reduced? Would tbe
juvenile delinquency rate be lessened, tbe lives of
citizens needlessly killed in traﬂic accidents be
saved? Would tbe number of citizens, now esti-
mated to approacb 15%, in need of psycbiatric
attention be belped? Would scbools be improved,
suddenly become more numerous? Would tbe jail-
ing of Communists reduce taxes, increase spend-
ing power?

Would any problem you can think of be re-
lieved?

24

\X/ould your liberties be increased?

Of course not! On the contrary, none of these
problems would be solved or alleviated in the
slightest; as a matter of fact they would grow
worse, because many of those dedicated toward
building a better life for all would be prevented
from ﬁghting for their objectives by prison bats.
Other "dissenters” indeed would take up the strug-
gle———trz1d€ unionists, ministers, leaders of the
liberation struggles of the Negro people, social
workers, teachers—all of those for whom the
future is an immediate task. And all, perhaps you
among them, can come under the proscriptions of
the Act. Who will ﬁght to defend you?

25

 

COMMUNISTS are only the first to be jailed.

After the Smith Act, directed against political
minorities, came the Taft-Hartley Act, setting forth
regulations under which the trade unions could
function. Then the Walter-McCarran Act aimed
new blows at the foreign-born and politically
suspect; the Landru.-m-Griﬂin Act further struck
at labor, and a host of “right to work" laws in
various states still further circumscribed popular
interests.

Little by little the rights of the people have
been chipped away, as a Woodsman fells a gigantic
oak. But we are the peo le splintered by the legis-
lative axe, it is our rig t: that are heing hacked
away.’

Every American must back away from this
process, see it for what it is, understand that,
in the ﬁnal analysis, it is his rights, under what-
ever pretext, that are being torn away.

When reaction can no longer contain the
strength of the people by existing laws, new laws
must '-be created to bolster legislative authority,
to hold the people in check. Democratic preroga-
tives must be surrendered to an illusory threat,
gigantic appropriations rushed through_Congress
to protect us against an imagined danger. There
is an attempt to perpetuate the illusions of democ-
racy while the content is drained away . . . "Com-
munists” must be put in jail, liberals hounded,
names and ﬁngerprints carefully taken. Who re-
mains ‘free?

At this moment four new anti-labor bills are
in Congressional hoppers. Two are sponsored by
Senator John McClellan, Arkansas "Dixiecrat,"
whose devotion to the civil rights of his Negro
constituents has been well recorded. Senator Mc-
Clellan was Chairman in 1957 of the U.S. Senate
Select Committee which investigated "improper
activities” of labor unions. Robert Kennedy was
the Chief Counsel of this Committee whose mem-
bers included Senators Karl Mundt, Barry Gold-
water, Homer Capehart and Joseph McCarthy. Sen-
ator McNamara, another member, resigned after
the ﬁrst year because he said he "felt that the Com-
mittee’: work was being used to hlachen the name
of labor.” Its major product was a vendetta against
James Hoffa and the Teamsters’ Union, carried on
relentlessly by Robert Kennedy.

A third bill is sponsored by Senator and Repub-
lican presidential aspirant Barry Goldwater (R.-
Arizona) and a fourth by Everett McKinley Dirk-
sen (R.-Illinois). All are designed to further
restrict labor’s hard-won rights to organize, strike,
picket, negotiate, and to demonstrate solidarity

26

with other workers, indispensable rights in the
age of automation when hundreds of thousands are
annually displaced :by machines.

No single action is more in the people’s interest
today than the blocking of this pending legislation
and the repeal of the vulgar McCarran Act which
would, ultimately, chain every American worker
who dares to think "for himself.

But the voice of the people must be heard!

Lengthy and expensive legal proceedings are
unavoidable in fighting the McCarran Act, but
they are not always decisive. Procedures and tech-
nicalities sometimes make possible the deliberate
avoidance of the basic issues—in this case our
democratic rights and protection under the Bill of
Rights. The false accusations written into the Mc-
Carran Act and its thought control purposes must
be unmasked publicly before the American peo-
ple. ‘The strong arguments against it, set forth
in President Truman’s veto, remain irrefutable.
The voice of the people must be raised in protest,
as is happening today in the magniﬁcent Negro
liberation struggles for their rights.

In spite of setbacks, evasions and attacks, 1963
is not 1950. The fog of McCarthyism has lifted
in our country. There is a much greater interest,
if not always agreement, with the speeches of
Communist spokesmen Gus Hall," Benjamin J.
Davis, Herbert Aptheker and others, in schools
and colleges. The thesis of the McCarran Act is
cracking, with the relaxing of the Cold War and
the improvement of relations among the Socialist,
neutralist and capitalist worlds. People are more
and more willing to defend the rights of Commu-
nists even when they disagree fundamentally with
their views. The tendency of a decade ago, at the
height of McCarthyism, to disassociate oneself
from the defense of even the most elementary
rights as far" as Communists were concerned, is
rapidly diminishing. One need not agree with the
Communists to repudiate the McCarran Act's crass
lies and slanders against them.

Our country is changing—the world is chang-
ing. The freedom struggle for full democratic and
equal rights in all phases of human life is on the
march here, in Africa, Latin America and else-
where. This creates a more favorable atmosphere to
abolish fetters like the McCarran Act. Commu-
nists, who number millions in countries like France
and Italy, England and other capitalist countries,
have a right to express their views, present candi-
dates for ofﬁce, be elected, publish papers, travel
to other countries, work as members and ‘be elected

as oﬂicers of trade unions. People abroad are
shocked and indignant that American Communists
are deprived of these rights. Committees have been
established in England, France and Germany, to
aid in the defense of American democratic rights.
Every American has aresponsibility to defend his
own rights.

To help repeal the McCarran Act and block '
’ new repressive legislation, a mighty crusade must

be mounted, a torrent of voices and dollars. You
can help by-

1. Writing to President Kennedy and to Attorney
General Robert Kennedy demanding that the
McCarran Act indictments be quashed, that
all S.A.C.B. proceedings be cancelled, and
further prosecutions under the McCarran Act
be halted.

2. Presenting resolutions in organizations, issuing
individual statements, writing to your local
papers, calling for a halt in enforcement of
the Act.

3. Distributing this brochure and other literature
listed on the back cover, among your friends
and associates. '

4. Writing to newspaper editors and radio and
TV directors and commentators suggesting
that they present articles and talks by Mr. Hall,-
Mr. Davis and other victims of the McCarran
Act.

Let the Voice of the People Be Heard!

As this brochure is being printed, the Mc-
Carran Act continues operating: '

1. H mrings on ADVANCE Youth Organi-
zation before the S.A.C.B. are in session
in New York,-

2. Oral argument on the appeal of William
Albertson and Roscoe Proctor against the
S.A.C.B.’s membership registration order
is scheduled for October 28th in Wash-

of the Internal Security Act of 1950-
the “McCarran Act.”

2 It -distributes information on these
cases as a public service and as a means
of raising funds to defend the victims of
this iniquitous legislation which must be
proven unconstitutional, clause by
clause, in the highest courts.

Besides this brochure, a number of
others are available for distribution.
Please see the list on the back cover.

The tests of the many provisions of
the Act involve long and costly legal bat-
tles. Everyone who reads this brochure

1. Structure of the Act

THE MCCARRAN ACT has two major divisions.
Title I is “Subversive Activities Control.” This
deals with enforced Communist registration; de-
nial of passports; the deﬁning of defense facilities
where employment is restricted; the labeling of
publications as Communist; naturalization regula-
tions and registration; deportation of aliens; and
more stringent amendments to laws dealing with
the foreign-born. One tacked-on section forbids
picketing and parading in or near a Federal Court-
house. Title II deals with "Emergency Detention”
in concentration camps of persons designated by
the Attorney General, in a national emergency.
Taken altogether, this omnibus package masquer-
ading as a law menaces the rights of millions of
Americans. John Albt, attorney for the Commu-
nist Party in all its McCarran Act litigation since
1950, has called it "an enabling act for fascism.”
Walter Lippmann refers to it as "nakedly and
Jimply a lync/2 law.”

It is named for the late Senator Pat McCarran

of Nevada, whose spirit, like that of the late,

Senator Joseph McCarthy, has not yet been de-
cently laid to rest. Sen. McCarran also sponsored
in 1950 a sixty-million-dollar “loan” for" fascist
Franco’s Spain. Other sponsors of the bill in 1950
were Senators McCarthy (R.-Wis.), William
Jenner (R.-Ind.), James Eastland (D.-Miss.),
Karl Mundt (R.-S. Dakota), and Congressmen
Richard "Nixon (R.-Calif.) , Harold Velde (R.-
Ill.), and Howard Smith (also father of the
Smith Act.) It was passed at the height of the
Korean War. Senator McCarran also co-sponsored
with Congressman Walter of Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee notoriety, the Walter-McCarran
Act of 1952, containing harsh, punitive restric-
tions on the foreign-born residents of the U.S.A.

cc 1ND1NGs”—THE EVASION OF DUE PROCESS
———The McCarran Act is based on so-called
“legislative ﬁndings” which are the brain-storms
of the House Un-American Activities Committee.
Junketing around the country, members of this
Committee have listened eagerly to the unbridled
lies and slanders of subsidized renegades like
Benjamin Gitlow and Louis Budenz) and of a
‘host of well-paid, planted government in-formers
and stool-pigeons. Witnesses were -brow-beaten,
insulted, charged with contempt, jailed, blacklisted,
dismissed from posts.
_In such an atmosphere the Hitler Big Lie—a
characterization of a world-wide Communist move-
ment as a criminal conspiracy, seeking through

2

 

deceit, treachery, secrecy, sabotage, and any other
means deemed necessary to overthrow the GOV-
ernment of the United States and to establish a
totalitarian dictatorship subservient to the most
powerful existing Communist dictatorship—was
written into law. No names are mentioned. This
was explained by tricky Richard Nixon in 1950
as follows:

"From having -heard witnesses before our
committee, we came to the conclusion that
naming the Communist Party by name and
attempting to build the entire registration pro-
vision around such a deﬁnition was an uncon-
stitutional approach and consequently the
Committee attempted to ﬁnd a legislative device
for meeting the problem in a constitutional
manner.”

So they devised a gimmick in a deceitful eﬂort
to avoid the constitutional safeguards against a
bill of attainder, which means any law that decrees
guilt and punishment without a judicial trial.
They wrote the guilt into the law and then per-
mitted a Board appointed under the law to name
the patties to whom the law referred.

OLE or THE S.A.C.B.—The McCarran Act
operates through the Subversive Activities
Control Board, composed of ﬁve members, ap-
pointed by the President. Three are a quorum

and one member or appointed examiner can con- V

duct hearings. Not more than three on the Board
are to be members of the same political party.
The original Board required the approval of Sena-
tor McCarran, then Chairman of the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee. Ex-Senator Harry Cain (R-
Wash), who was vociferously anti-left and anti-
Communist, was appointed to the Board by Presi-
dent Eisenhower in 1953. His experiences on the
Board changed his attitude. He became an ardent
champion of civil liberties, expressed shame for
his former inquisitorial role and voiced sharp
criticisms of McCarthyism. He resigned from the
Subversive Activities Control Board and called
for the scrapping of the McCarran Act. Another
member, not conﬁrmed by Congress, was ex-Con-
gressman Charles M. LaFollette (D.-Ind.), who
was critical of the Board's procedures.

The Board does not initiate proceedings. When-
ever the Attorney General “shall have reason to
believe” that an organization is either a “Commu-
nist action organization” which endeavors to carry
out the criminal purposes deﬁned in the Act
or  a "Communist front organization” whose
positions on matters of policy do not deviate
from those of Communist action organizations,

3

 

he can initiate action by the Board. He petitions
it for an order requiring the organization to reg-
ister as such. Thereupon the Board holds hear-
ings, wi-th witnesses, to determine whether the
cited organization or individual is as charged by
the Attorney General. The Board’s decisions may
be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals and to
the U.S. Supreme Court. The Government’s wit-
nesses before the Board have been, with a few
exceptions, the same as had appeared before the
House Un-American Activities Committee.

HY NOT NAME NAMES IN LAW?—As noted
above, Congress did not name names, to
avoid making the Law unconstitutional on its
face. The power to ﬁll out the names that Con-
gress plainly meant was left within the province
of the Board, and upheld by Justice Frankfurter’s
decision of June 5, 1961. The Board decided—
as Congress had intended—-that "the foreign gov-
ernment" referred to in the law was the Soviet
Union and the "Communist action organization”
in this country was the Communist Party, U.S.A.
This was a gratuitous insult to a friendly country,
with diplomatic relations with the United States,
a valiant ally during the war against Hitler a few
years before, with whom conferences and nego-
tiations, exchange of students and delegations and
other such ties have gone on with increasing mu-
tual beneﬁts during the last decade.

When the Board completes its findings and
orders an organization to register, failure to com-
ply can be punished by a ﬁne of $10,000 for each
day it does not register. An individual can be
punished, in addition to this ﬁne, by imprisonment
for ﬁve years for each day’s failure to register
Each day’s failure constitutes a separate offense,
so these penalties could result in life sentences~——
clearly a violation of the 8th Amendment's pro-
hibition of excessive ﬁnes and cruel and unusual
punishment.

THE MCCARRAN ACT, as stated in its preamble,
is "To protect the United States against cer-
tain un-American and subversive activities, by
requiring the registration of Communist organiza-
tions and for other purposes.” Its immediate target
is the American Communists who are commanded
to register as a "Communist action organization.”
This has nothing in common with any other type
of routine registration. Every Communist would
be glad to be able to register to vote. We are not
opposed to employed agents of foreign powers
registering as such. But this does not apply to
the Communist Party. We are not opposed to the

4

 

registration of lobbyists. But this does not apply
to the Communist Party. These and ordinary
business forms of registration have no implication
of criminal intent. To register under the McCarran
Act is an admission of guilt of actual crimes.
Communists do not desire or enjoy secrecy. The
late Eugene Dennis, as General Secretary of th(
Communist Party, stated in 1947:

"I pledge that on the day Congress makes
such a resolution (that all Communists be
guaranteed the full protection of the Bill of
Rights), every single member of the Commu-
nist Party will be more than happy and willing
to publicly declare his Communist aﬁiliation of
which he is so proud.”

In addition to the Communists, any liberal or
progressive organization can be falsely labeled a
"Communist front" and be subject to the require-
ments of the Law. This can and does include non-
Communists and even anti-Communists, as its
victims. It starts with the Communists, but it does
not end there. No other law like it is on the
American statute books. It is an edict. It is not
one but a series of laws, a veritable catch-all. It
declares “facts” by decree, has self-made deﬁni-
tions, arbitrary regulations and atrocious penalties
under its built-in verdict of guilt. I-t sets up its
own self-enforcing machinery.

OMMUNIST PARTY——THE MAIN TARGET—
Why did Congress feel it was necessary to
pass the McCarran Act in 1950? The Smith Act
was in full force at that time. But it required a
show of “evidence,” at least, in the form of books
by Marx, Engels, Lenin and others, which had to
be trundled into court every day of a lengthy
trial. It required the repetitious testimony of rene-
gades and stool-pigeons of the F.B.I. on quota-
tions torn out of context from these books and
interpreted by them to mean the advocacy of
forcible overthrow of the government. It was a
tedious and expensive procedure for the govern-
ment. So the McCarran Act was planned to be a
more direct attack on the Party as an organiza-
tion, a short-cut to convictions by writing into
the law the so-called "evidence” plus a built-in
verdict of guilt against Communists, which made
a trial unnecessary.

Senator Homer Ferguson (R.-Mich.), in re-
porting the bill out of the Judiciary Committee in
1950, referred to the "inadequacy of existing law."
Communists, he said, avoided advocating the
forcible overthrow of government although, he
added, without doubt Communists do advocate
it. (How they do if they don’-t, is a Senatorial para-

dox!) He added that the McCormick Act of 1938
and the Voorhis Act of 1940, which require regis-
tration of foreign agents, also were not adequate
because the government had never been able to
establish proof in a court of law of such foreign
agency of the Communist Party. He did not con-
sider that it meant there is .no such proof. Rather,
he said, the Communists had through “skill and
deceit” managed "to conceal their foreign ties.”
So what the government could not prove .in a law
court, the Congress decided arbitrarily, and it was
written into the law as "legislative ﬁndings.” On
the basis of this, the Communists are called upon
to register as being in fact what they deny and
what the government has never been able -to prove.
To fasten the chains of the McCarran Act
upon the Communist Party, Justice Frankfurter
in the Supreme Court's majority opinion, ruled
that the Subversive Activities Control Board
(S.A.C.B.) could not examine the Congressional
ﬁndings. He said the court is also barred from
passing on the validity of the ﬁndings or on the
wisdom of the Act itself. He said: "They are the
product of extensive investigations by Committees
of Congress over more than a decade and a half.”
Thus, according to Frankfurter, now retired, the
Hitler deﬁnition of “Communist” is indelibly
written into law in the U.S.A. and is not subject
to judicial review. Justice Felix Frankfurter said:
"It is wholly speculative now to foreshadow
whether, or under what conditons a member of
the Party may in the future apply for a passport,
or seek government employment in a defense-
facility or labor-union employment, or being
an alien, become a party to a naturalization or
de-naturalization proceeding. None of these
things may happen. If they do, appropriate ad-
ministrative and judicial procedures will be
available to test the constitutionality of appli-
cations of particular sections of the Act to the
particular situations. Nothing justiﬁes provi-
sioning those issues now.”

Thus a gigantic fraud became law in the U.S.A.

"A fateful moment in the history of a free coun-
try,” Justice Hugo L. Black called it, in his dis-
sent. He said further, "T he Act is unconstitu-
tional in that it amounts to a complete outlawry
of the Communist Party.”

Justice W/illiam 0. Douglas said:

"The great injustice in what we do today lies
in compelling oﬂicials of the Party to violate the
law before their constitutional claims can be
heard and determined. Never before, I believe,
have we forced such a choice on a litigant.”

~ 2. Proceedings Against the
Communist Party, U.S.A.

THE LITIGATION against the Communist Party
has had a long history. It began Nov. 22, 1950,
when the then Attorney General, J. Howard Mc-
Grath, ﬁled his ﬁrst petition. This stage lasted until
June 5, 1961, when the Pa.rty’s appeal was rejected
by a 5-to-4 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court,
which upheld the order of the Subversive Activi-
ties Control Board to the Party to register as a
"Communist action organization.” The Court re-
fused to pass on any other aspect of the law, ex-
cept registration, as "premature.” The Board’s
hearing on the Party case lasted ﬁfteen months.
The record is 14,000 pages long. The Govern-
ment produced 22 witnesses. All but two were
F.B.I. informers and stool-pigeons. The Board's

report to the Court of Appeals was twice returned
to it. The testimony of three principal govern-
ment witnesses———Paul Crouch, Manning Johnson
and Harvey Matusow—had to be expunged from
the record as tainted with perjury. The Court later
ordered that the records of statements made by
witness Louis Budenz to the F.B.I. be made avail-
able -to the Party. A substantial area of his testi-
mony was ordered stricken, in consequence, since
it did not correspond with these statements.

In i-ts ﬁnal report to the Supreme Court, the
S.A.C.B. admitted that in spite of strenuous ef-
forts by the government to prove otherwise, there
was no evidence that the C;P.U.S.A. receives ﬁnan-
cial support from the Soviet Union or any other
foreign sources; no evidence of orders or directives
from the Soviet Union to the C.P.U.S.A.; no evi-
dence that the Party employs secrecy to conceal
foreign ties, but rather has done so to protect
its members from domestic harassment. With the
collapse of these three major elements of proof
required by the McCarran Act, only one impor-
tant pillar was left—-namely, "parallelism," or
identity of views. Not deeds, not actions, but
ideas are the sole attempted proof today in the
case against Communists and others.

Whether an organization is a "Communist ac-‘
tion organization” is determined, as stated in the
Act, by the “extent to which its views and policies
do not deviate from those of such foreign gov-
ernment or foreign organizations," already deﬁned
in the Act. Do the views cited have any relation
to violence, espionage, sabotage, and other crimes
