tion. More and more people are beginning; to realize the class
nature of the government. No matter how liberal or humane
its pretensions, in every crisis its power is used to maintain
the existing system.

In the present hour the Socialist party is faced with the
most serious responsibility of its history. Socialists must be
ready not only to interpret and explain the present situation
but they must put forward a constructive program carrying
a clear answer to the present confusion. The workers of
America must come to see that their insecurity and difficul-
ties are not due to bad employers and heartless corporations
but to the very nature of capitalism itself. Neither are they
the result of a bad administration of government. The govem—
ment is committed to the maintenance of capitalism. There-
for, there is no hope of permanent benefits within the frame-
work of capitalism either by economic or political reform. The
only hope is to be found in replacing capitalism with Social-
ism.. Workers then must organize for the economic and politi-
cal power which will enable them to do this.

The Socialist party is not just another political party. It is
a movement with a philosophy, an objective and a goal; a
practical program for achieving that goal and an effective
organization for putting that program to work.

Position of Party

At the special convention of the Socialist party held in
Chicago in March, 1937, the position of the Socialist party on
certain vital issues was set forth.

This position was stated in a series of resolutions. These
resolutions were arrived at after careful study and full dis-
cussion. These resolutions no longer are the opinion of a few
individuals. They represent the official position of the party.
As the official position of the party they are the basis for
action for all Socialists. Resolutions must be translated into
effective programs of action.

The final essential is that Socialists will know the attitude
and position of the party on these issues. Therefore, the action
of the convention is presented in this handbook so every

 

 

INTRODUCTION 9

Socialist will know just where the party stands. But this in-
formation is not limited to party members. We call upon all
workers to join us in advancing the program of the Socialist
party. Therefore, we want all to know our position on these
issues. The stand taken by the party, as set forth in these
resolutions is in line with the historic position of Socialism.
More than that it is the application to the present situation
of those basic and fundamental principles of Socialism for
which Socialists have always stood.

Help Build the Party

All men and women who want to end exploitation, who
want a new world of security, peace and freedom, who want
to escape from the chaos of capitalism, who want to partici-
pate in building a world where our productive power can be
released for the well being of all, are invited by the Socialist
party to study this program and to share in its achievement.

The principles for which Socialists stand, as expressed in
these resolutions, have no value in the abstract. They have
meaning and worth only as they are put into action. So
Socialists are urged to carry out these principles in all those
groups in which they function. In labor unions, unemployed
organizations, cooperatives, farmers organizations, fraternal
organizations, peace groups, etc., Socialists are urged wherever
possible to interpret to workers’ the Socialist stand on all issues
for a complete understanding and eventual acceptance of
them.

The special convention of the Socialist party not only
adopted clear cut and definite stands on vital issues, but it

made important and vital changes in the organization and"

structure of the party. No matter how sound our position on
vital issues may be, unless we have the organization with
which to carry on an effective program of party activity and
building, our position means little.

It is not enough to be a Socialist in sentiment; one must
be a Socialist in action. That means organization. This hand-
book includes the constitution of the party which governs
organization, action and conduct of party affairs.

   

SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

Organization Set Up

There is one Socialist Party of the United States of
America. For convenience of administration there are sub-
divisions of state, local and branch organization. But these
are mere subdivisions for administrative purposes. In addi-
tion, special organization districts may be set up including
part of one state or ‘several states.

The work of the party is supervised by a national organi-
zation, a national executive committee of fifteen members
elected by the convention of the party. A national head-

quarters is maintained with an executive secretary in charge.

    

He is assisted by a staff including labor secretary, finance
director, editors of the official press, and such other assistants
as conditions demand.

The national executive committee meets quarterly. A
national action committee of seven, responsible to the national
executive committee, meets weekly at national headquarters.
In addition to the national executive committee, there are
certain standing functioning committees, selected from among
comrades with special experience in specific fields and chosen
with respect to their ability to function.

Party Committees

These committees are Labor, Unemployment, Youth, Negro
Work, Press, Public Affairs, Farm and Farm Cooperatives,
War and Fascism, Consumers Cooperatives, Education, and
Childrens Work. A full time labor secretary in cooperation
with the labor committee. directs the work and efforts of
Socialists in trade unions. The National office publishes litera-
ture, directs activities of organizers, routes speakers, plans edu-
cational and political campaigns and in general directs the
program of the party in accord with decisions made by the
membership acting through its conventions.

The party maintains a Socialist press. The SOCIALIST
CALL is the official paper of the party. It is published each
week. Each member is expected not only to be a subscriber
himself, but to secure new readers and subscribers. Each
branch or local is expected to receive regularly a bundle order
for sale or general distribution.

INTRODUCTION 11

The AMERICAN SOCIALIST MONTHLY is the official
theoretical magazine of the party. Regular reading of the
MONTHLY is essential if one is to be informed on Socialist
theory and keep abreast of current developments. Securing
subscriptions and promoting the sale of single copies of the
MONTHLY is a responsibility of every member and of all
locals and branches.

Locals and state organizations may issue their own publi-'

cations but these publications must receive approval for their
responsible editors, organizational set—up and policy from the
national executive committee. . 4

The individual Socialist is a member of a local organiza-
tion. In a large community he may belong to a branch which
is a subdivision of a local. This branch or local organization
is the unit in which the individual member functions. The
branch or local organization meets regularly, conducts edu-
cational campaigns, plans and carries out demonstrations,
holds meetings both for its members and the public. In short,
each branch or local carries on a full program of educational,
organizational and propaganda activities. It adapts to the
local community the general plans of activity adopted by the
state and national -organization.

In addition, the membership through the.branch and local
makes suggestions and recommendations to the entire party.
The branch and local is the clearing house for, and the co-
ordinator- of Socialist activity. Each party member is expected
to carry on Socialist work in whatever organization he finds
himself.

Each state has its own executive committee, state secretary,
and state office. The state organization has responsibility

under the national organization for the promotion and direc-_

tion of Socialist activity in the state except where special
organization districts are set up.

Our Responsibility

The need for Socialism is becoming increasingly clear.
Socialist sentiment is growing. The fear of insecurity and
discontent with present conditions must be directed into a
constructive program. The Socialist party has the organiza-

    
 

12 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

tion. It has a glorious heritage of courageous spirits and brave
men and women who have laid foundations. The task now is
to enlist the enthusiasm and cooperation of all workers for
the building of Socialism.

We will not drift into a world of security and abundance.
The social waste and misery in our order today are not grow-
ing pains. They are signs of disaster unless the great mass of
people accept their responsibility and begin now to cooperate
in establishing a new society.

The Socialist party presents the program and organization
committed to a new society. With new purpose and increased
devotion Socialists set themselves to that task. The Socialist
party extends a sincere and genuine invitation to all who
want this new society to come into membership in the party
and share in the work and satisfaction that comes in such an
undertaking.

ROY E. BURT, Executive Secretary.

 

Explanatory Note

The National Executive Committee of the Socialist
party, in line with the statement on perspectives adopted
at its meeting in New York last November, issued a call
for a special convention of the Socialist party. This con-
vention was called to clarify the party’s position on the
vital issues before the workers of America and to make
such changes in party organizational structure as would
enable the party to act effectively and decisively on
these issues.

This special convention was held in Chicago, March
26-29, 1937. The convention was preceded by a full and
free discussion throughout the entire party. Meeting
after meeting of local and branch was given over to
this discussion based on material representing all points
of view within the party, to the end that the convention"
might reflect the thinking of the party membership.

Herewith is presented the major decisions of that
special convention which set forth the stand of the
Socialist party.

In addition, included is the constitution of the party
as changed and amended by the convention to the end
that the organization might be a more effective instru-
ment in carrying out the will of the party.

It is hoped that the contents of this handbook will
be studied carefully by every member of the party so
that an informed and intelligent membership may be a
loyal and effective membership.

To those interested in the goal and program of the
Socialist party, we invite you to study these resolutions
carefully so you may see where we stand and under-
stand the organization through which we work to make
that stand effective. We do this with the hope that you
will see your way to taking your place in our ranks as a
builder for Socialism.—R. E. B.

The Declaration of Principles of [the
Socialist Party U. S. A.

“This convention goes on record reaffirming the Declaration of
Principles of the Socialist pa-rty adopted at the Cleveland Conven-
tion 1936.”

The Socialist party is the party of the workers, regardless

of race, color or creed. In mill and mine, shop and farm, office
and school, the workers can assert their united power, and
through the Socialist party establish a cooperative common-
wealth forever free from human exploitation and class rule.

Capitalism Means Poverty

If the workers delay and drift, they will prolong the period
of their slavery to a decaying capitalism. This destructive,
wasteful, and brutally oppressive social system takes jobs away
and turns millions of would-be producers into the streets with
no assurance that they will ever again get jobs. Under capital-
ism the owners of “our” great trusts and corporations for
their own selfish gain, control markets and prices and raise
the cost of living. Under capitalism the bankers and financiers
autocratically control money and credit for the advantage of
no. one but themselves. Under capitalism the owners of
industry ‘seek constantly to increase their profits and con-
stantly reduce the workers’ standard of living, except where
labor has organized aggressively and struggled energetically
for its rights. Under capitalism the owners of industry deny
to society the abundance and the leisure which modern

machinery and science‘ could provide for all if — profit were not,

king. ,
Capitalism invades the peace of_ farming areas with
insecurity, want and destitution. With the strangling clutch

of mortgage debt, it takes away the farmers’ land and homes,

through foreclosures and evictions. Throughout the land it
attacks the home, driving women and even children out to
work for a pittance, and brands countless children and adults
alike with the pinch of want.

16 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

Capitalism Means War

The privileged minority who benefit from exploitation of
the multitude are not content with owning the means of
production and distribution. They control the press, radio,
and motion picture; they starve and poison the educational
system. They dominate our courts, our municipalities, our
state legislatures and our national government. To extend
their economic domain they expose to the appalling menace of
new imperialist wars the innocent youth in our own and other
countries, on whom they will lay the ruthless clutch of

_conscription and whom they send to fight wars, useless except

for profit.

To confuse the voting masses and retain their authority,
they maintain great political parties whose reaction and
insincere liberalism, offer to the workers no real program for
plenty, peace, or freedom.

Abolish Capital

Those who labor with hand or brain, in their concerted
might, can overthrow this insane system and replace it with
the genuine cooperative commonwealth of Socialism. As soon
as the working class becomes educated and organized to make
effective use of its numbers, it can transfer to the people
the ownership of industry, transportation, finance, and
natural resources including water power, and operate these
possessions of the Socialist Commonwealth for the material
and cultural enrichment of all.

The Socialist party will begin the job of establishing
public ownership with the large scale industries such as
banking, electric power, insurance, mining, transportation,
communication and the trustified industries, and will extend
the process of socialization as rapidly as possible until
unearned income in the form of rent, interest, dividends, and
profit, is finally abolished.

Socialization of industry in the way Socialists want it does

not mean management by politicians, lawyers, or bureaucrats.
We want democratic management of industry through elected

 

PRINCIPLES _ 17

and responsible representatives of the workers in each
industry and of the workers and consumers as a whole.

Farmer and Socialism

The Socialist party will eliminate the useless gamblers and
middlemen who now stand between the farmers and the city
consumers. This can be done through cooperative and Phblicly
owned warehouses, markets, and transportation systems. In
this way the farmers can get decent prices for their products,
and the city consumers can get reduction in the cost of living.

Besides that, Socialism will, through public ownership of
banking and insurance, protect the working farmers from
foreclosures, and from the grinding poverty to which the load
of mortgage debt now condemns them. The Socialist party
will not take farms from the working farmers. On the
contrary, we will protect every working farmer from fore-
closure by privately owned banks and insurance companies
and every tenant farmer from eviction by ruthless landlords.
This we will do by making title to the farm depend on its use
for productive purposes by those who live on it.

Ultimately Socialists believe that large scale cooperatively
owned farms will prove the ideal for agriculture from the point
of View of efficiency and reduction in the long hours of farm
toil. But establishing such farms must be done voluntarily;

we do not propose to force such a program upon unwilling

working farmers.
Trade Unions

Workers of town and country must be strongly organized
on economic as well as on political lines. The ceaseless struggle
of the labor unions and farm organizations, and the construc-
tive work of bona fide cooperative societies, are necessary, not
only for the immediate defense and betterment of the condi-
tion of the producing class, but also to give producers the
education and self-discipline required for the efficient
administration of the industries of which they are to win
control, and to serve as bulwarks of defense against any
possible capitalist attempt to establish a Fascist dictatorship
or overthrow 9. workers’ government. 4

18 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

It is the duty of every Socialist wage worker to be a loyal
and active member of the union in his industry or trad.e, and
to strive for the strengthening and solidifying of the trade
union movement. It is the duty and privilege of the entire
Socialist movement to aid the unions in their struggles for
better wages, increased leisure, and better conditions of
employment. .

International Working Class Solidarity

The Socialist party, while standing for the interests of the
American people, recognizes that the well—being of any one
nation is bound up with that of every other. We will end
national hatred by international working class solidarity. We
will seek to join with the Socialist parties of other countries
in the common effort to build a world-wide federation of
Socialist cooperative commonwealths.

Oppose Warfare of Capitalism

The Socialist party is opposed to militarism, imperialism,
and war. We propose to eradicate the perpetual economic
warfare of capitalism, the fruit of which is international
conflict. War cannot be tolerated by Socialists, or prepared-
ness for war. We will unitedly seek to develop trustworthy
working class instruments for the peaceable settlement of
international disputes and conflicts. We will seek to eliminate
military training from schools, colleges and camps. We will
oppose military reviews, displays and expenditures, whether
for direct war preparedness or for militaristic propaganda
both in .wartime and peacetime. We will loyally support in
the tragic event of war any of our comrades who come into
conflict with the capitalist war machine for anti-war activities
carried out in accordance with the policy of the party’s
responsible committees. Moreover, recognizing the suicidal
nature of modern combat and the incalculable train of war’s
consequences which rest most heavily upon the working class,
we will refuse collectively to sanction or support any interna-
tional war. We will seek to rally all the opponents of. war
into united opposition, and we will do all in our power to win
the labor unions and farmers and the unorganized workers to

 

 

PRINCIPLES ‘ 19

a general strike against the threat of war, so that war will
become a practical impossibility and the capitalist war crisis
will be converted into a victory for peace and Socialism.

Fight Fascism-

In our struggle for a new society, the Socialist party tries
to attain its aim by peaceful and orderly means. We recognize
that the capitalists may try to destroy democracy and
establish fascism in order to bolster up a crumbling capitalist
system and maintain their class domination at all costs. But
the Socialist party will not be deceived by fascist propaganda
nor overwhelmed by fascist force. We will do all in our power
to fight fascism of every kind all the time and everywhere in
the world, until the danger of fascism is finally destroyed
through the establishment of a Socialist society. For this
purpose we will rely chiefly on the organized and disciplined
labor movement. Our methods may include the use of a
general strike which will not merely serve as a defense against
Fascist counter-revolution but will carry the revolutionary
struggle into the camp of the enemy.

Democracy

The Socialist party proclaims anew its faith in economic
and political democracy. A system of complete democracy is
only possible, however, in a classless society wherein the
government is the servant of the entire people and not the
tool of a ruling class. so long as classes exist, both the form

and content of any existing system of political democracy will ,

be conditioned and limited by and subordinated to the main-
tenance of class rule. In such class systems, oppressed classes
have won and can maintain certain civil liberties and
democratic rights through stubborn struggling against the
ruling class.

Such democracy as the workers. have won is partial and
uncertain so long as capitalism survives. Today, it is hedged

around by unequal representation, by the disenfranchisement ‘

of millions, by the arbitrary powers of the Supreme and lower
courts, by coercion of employees through job control, and

 

 

20 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

above all, by control over the means of influencing public
opinion due to unlimited financial power in the hands of the
owners of industry. When the workers seek to organize to
get rid of capitalism, even this partial democracy may no
longer serve the interests of the capitalist class. Then only
the organized power of the workers can prevent their demo-
cratic rights from being destroyed in the hands of the
capitalist class as has happened in Italy, Austria and Germany.

Capitalism Is Doomed

Capitalism is doomed, it must give way to a Socialist order
brought about by the socialization of the principal means of
production and distribution. The Socialist party aims to
accomplish this by peaceful and democratic means. However,
if the reactionary forces resort to violence in an attempt to
prevent the Socialist government from carrying out the
people’s mandate given by a majority vote, the Socialist
government will not hesitate to resort to whatever means may
be necessary to crush counter—revolut1onary movements and
to consolidate the Socialist state. If orderly and democratic
means of progress are completely denied us, whether through
deliberate fascist plan, through devastating defeat in war, or
because of the paralyzing panic resulting from complete
capitalist collapse, the Socialist party with the aid. of the
economic organizations of the producing masses will rally all
possible forces to organize and maintain a government of and
for the working class.

We seek full democracy for those who work and serve.
That can only be won by ending privilege and taking all
powers from the few who corrupt and rob present democracy
of its true meaning. Democracy is a worthy means of progress;
but true democracy must be created by the workers of the
world.

Build and Fight for Socialism

The ability of the Socialist party to continue to rule and
build Socialism once it has won political power, will depend
upon the active support of the masses of the nation.. The
Socialist party, therefore, firmly believes in the strengthening

 

PRINCIPLES _ 21

and maintenance of existing democratic institutions through
which the Socialist will of the masses may be cultivated and
expressed. The advocacy of a policy of armed insurrection by
a minority against a stable state machinery is romantic
impossibilism, entirely inconsistent with membership in the
Socialist party. =Advocacy of such a policy is r-ejected by the
Socialist party. The Socialist party, however, will never
surrender cheaply the human liberties and democratic rights
for which generations of American workers have paid so
dearly, nor will it permit the will of the masses to be
frustrated by fascist dictatorship. In defense of the workers’
rights and in enforcement of the democratically expressed will
of the masses, the Socialist party calls upon the workers to
stand ready to meet reactionary violence with every means
at their disposal.

WAR. AND FASCISM

New Imperialist War Imminent

‘Aware of war’s proximity, the capitalist powers are arming
at war—time speed. The world struggle among the capitalist
powers is only superficially a conflict between democratic and
fascist powers. The struggle does not arise from the form of
government in the capitalist state, nor from the special guilt

of any nation or group of capitalist nations. A new world war '

will merely be the continuation by military methods of an
incessant imperialist rivalry among all the capitalist powers.
The root of a new war will be the capitalist system, not its
fascist form. And the motive behind the capitalist govern-
ments entering the war will be imperalist.

League of Nations Imperialist Instrument

The League of Nations has. displayed itself as the confer-
ence table of the capitalist powers, over which they make
their deals for the maintance of the imperalist system. It has
proved itself as powerless to prevent war as is the capitalist
system itself.

RESOLUTIONS . 23

Soviet Union In Danger

The entrance of the Soviet Union into the League of
Nations and the conclusion of a military pact with France
have not guaranteed peace in Europe. The expected isolation
of Hitler by a move for encirclement started by the Soviet
Union has not been consummated, and has, as was to be
anticipated, merely hastened a counter—formation of alliances
against the Soviet Union.

American Imperialism Preparing for War

In spite of the superficial concessions made under the
“good neighbor” policy to anti-imperialist opinion, the effect
of that policy is still to make Latin America the imperialist
domain of the United States. The “good neighbor” policy has
aided Cuban fascism, allied to economic interests in the U. S.
A., to subjugate the Cuban masses under a brutally repressive
regime; it has encouraged and stabilized numerous fascist
governments whose existence is inimical to freedom and
peace. The most attractive slogans cannot disguise the
attempts to tighten control of finance imperialism in the
United States over the nations to the south. Even the outward

' appearance of international cooperation is ‘often secured by

agreements with reactionary dictators which rest upon the
suppression and exploitation of the Latin American peoples.
No Faith in Neutrality Legislation

So long as there is no peace time neutrality —— since
economic competition and imperialist penetration continue—

there can be no lasting war-time neutrality. As soon as an,

international war begins to shake the American economic
empire, the United States government will move its armies
into the field for defense of the imperialist structure.

_ Neutrality legislation tends to shift the faith of the people
to the government’s peace plans. The v-ery best that neutral-
ity legislation can do is to halt war-time trade with
belligerents and to prevent naval incidents. To the extent that
this is accomplished, neutrality legislation deserves the support
of all those who would delay the outbreak of war. .

 

24 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

Socialists, while not opposing such neutrality legislation
as will hamper the early movements of the war machine,
cannot place faith in the force of neutrailty legislation to
keep America out of war. Certain neutrality legislation,
however, Socialists will oppose as injurious to the cause of
the workers of the world, atnd, in the long run, to the cause
of lasting peace.

Any embargo is reactionary and an aid to war, which
makes it impossible for the workers of any country to procure
supplies with which to struggle against oppression. Embargo
legislation in the United States Congress against aid for the
Spanish loyalists clearly illustrates the one—sided nature of
neutrality laws under a capitalist government. Likewise, an
embargo directed against the Soviet Union in a war against
capitalist aggressors would. be equally injurious to the cause
of world progress and ultimate peace.

Collective Security Pacts of Military Aid

In our present divided world, “collective security” means
that nations band together in one group ‘to oppose other
nations. Wh-ether collective security starts as a system of
economic sanctions or as military sanctions immediately, it
is in effect nothing but a military alliance, a renewalof the
pacts of military assistance which were so plentiful and so
deadly before the World War.

When the working class of a capitalist country supports
its government in a policy of collective security it is virtually
handing the government a blank check for war, payable when-
ever the ruling class decides that another nation or group of
nations is violating, or can be charged with violating, the
rules of collective security.

As a workers’ state, the Soviet Union has no colonies or
imperialist aims. In this, as in its offer of mutual disarma-
ment to the other nations, it has shown how a working-class
government can be a force for peace. Yet within the ranks
of the workers, in the name of “defending democracy,”
“defense of small? countries,” “ defense of colonial peoples,”
and “defense of the Soviet Union,” all worthy slogans when
their implications are not fully examined—-the Communist

RESOLUTIONS

III
PEOPLE’S FRONT

The present period of decaying capitalism is marked-by ‘

severe crises, the onrushing of devastating wars and the ad-
vance of political and social reaction in the form of fascism.
People’s Front policy has been put forward as a means o-f
combating this new form of capitalist reaction and as a tran-

sitional form of government between capitalism and socialism.

Social—democratic opportunism and Communist sectarianism
which to large extent made possible the victories of fascism
is now giving support to the policy of People’s Front. Recent
adherents to this policy have been gained even from the ranks
of former left wing Socialists.

People’s Front—Coalitionism

There is essentially no distinction between People’s Front-

ism of today and coalitionism of the past. Both depend on alli-
ances with the capitalists to defeat fascism, both abandon the
struggle for Socialism by operating on the basis of “democracy
versus fascism” rather than “Socialism versus Capitalism.”
Both, by championing the status quo as against a basic change
in the social system make it possible for the-fascists to rally
the discontented and middle class elements and thereby pro-
vide fascism with a mass base. Like coalitionism, Popular
Frontism therefor-e must inevitably fail because it offers no
adequate defence against fascism, since it endeavors to main-
tain and rehabilitate a system which inevitably breeds fascism.
Italy, Germany and Austria are living warnings against this
method of combatting fascism. '

People’s Front Prepares for War

In foreign affairs, People’s Frontism counts on the support
of democratic capitalist countries to stop fascist agression and
war, and relies on the League of Nations and collective secur-
ity rather than upon the class struggle. Far from preventing
war even temporarily People’s Frontism becomes an instru-
ment for preparing the masses to accept war. Since People’s

Frontism in power must assume responsibility for the defence
of the democratic state against aggression, it promotes patrio-
tism and class collaboration and inevitably be-comes trans-
formed into a national front, including even the patriotic
fascist elements. Since in a People’s Front government the
working class is firmly tied to parties which defend and pro-
tect the foundations of capitalist society, no effective measures
can be undertaken to destroy the bureaucracy and the armed
forces as the pillars of capitalist control. The working class is
denied the right to arm itself even for defensive purposes. The
industrialists and financiers cannot be curbed, and the means
of propaganda remain in their hands. Thus it is impossible
to look upon the People’s Front government as a transition
government to Socialism.

Impotent Against Fascism

The Blum government in France has amply demonstrated
the futility of People’s Frontism. In internal policy it is more
and more becoming an oppressive force against the workers,
and is impotent in the face of the attack upon the workers
standards and to curb the fascists. In foreign policy, it has
in effect betrayed the Spanish anti-fascist struggle by its so-
called non—interventionist policy. All this was done because
as an administrator of -a capitalist state, Blum inevitably was
pushed by capitalist rather than working class forces. In
Spain, the Azana government was helpless in the face of the
fascist prep-arations for an uprising. and only the armed work-
ers saved Spain from fascism. With the outbreak of the civil
war and the disintegration of the stable bourgeois apparatus,
the People’s Front has yielded to working class rather than
bourgeois pressure, and only thereby has the anti-fascist
struggle borne any fruits.

Yokes Workers With Capitalists

In the United States advocates of the People’s Front policy
would destroy the effectiveness of a Labor Party movement by
converting it into a People’s front. People’s Frontism can be
expressed by support of the candidates of the democratic

 

RESOLUTIONS 29

party, as was done in the last election. People’s Frontism
spreads the illusion that the New Deal administration can be
relied upon to combat war and fascism. People’s F‘rontism
leads to suspension of the militant struggle in the workers’

. economic organizations, and thus tends to weaken their class

struggle character. People’s Frontism spreads the idea that
the American government should be compelled to participate
in collective security, and should be supported in a war against
a fascist power or in a war in which the United States govern-
ment is on the same side as the Soviet Union. Thus, the net
effect of People’s Frontism in the United States would be to
yoke the working class with the capitalists even more firmly
than at present and make even more difficult the central task
which confronts the Socialists and the workers themselves———
namely, the political separation of the working class as a class
from the capitalists, and its organization as an independent
force.

The Middle Class

The middle class, in whose ranks fascism today finds
numerous recruits, can be won to the struggle against fascism
only if the working class leads, not if it follows. Both by
fighting for the immediate demands of the middle class as
directed against finance capital and by educating it to the
advantages of a Socialist society, and by championing demo-
cratic rights which capitalism is today abandoning, important
sections of the middle class can be gained as allies in the
struggle against fascism and for Socialism. In backward and
colonial countries the working class may make an alliance
with non—proletarian elements for the purpose of carrying; on
an anti-imperialist struggle and initiating the bourgeois-
democratic revolution. In the course of its participation in
this struggle the working class strengthens its own forces,
rallies around itself the poor peasantry and lower urban
middle class and endeavors to transform the bourgeois-
democratic revolution into a proletarian revolution. This
process must receive the fullest assistance of the working class
in the advanced capitalist countries, and such assistance is
paralyzed when the working class undertakes to preserve the
foundations of capitalism, one of which is colonial oppression.

 

SOCIALISIT HANDBOOK

Class Struggle On All Fronts

The struggle to be carried on under the watchword
“Socialism versus Capitalism” must not become an abstrac-
tion or a pure propaganda slogan. Its carrying out requires
the maintenance of the independence of the working class
and the prosecution of the class struggle on all fronts; the

fight for the preservation of democratic rights, to be carried '

on not only outside of Congress, but also a.gainst the govern—.
ment; the formation of a Labor party on a class base; the
unity of the working class and of its organizations on the
basis of a program of struggle. Thus reaction will be weak-
ened and the workers will be prepared to take up the struggle
for the Socialist society.

IV
UNITED FRONT

The activities of the Socialist party have meaning and
purpose only as they bring. the party into vital touch with the
daily struggle of the workers in the factories, shops, offices
and mines and on the farms, to the end that the p-arty
becomes the most effective possible instrument in the world-
wide struggle for the emancipation of labor, and, through it,
the emancipation of mankind.

In pursuance of these activities, the Socialist party should
vigorously work for specific cooperative undertakings or united
fronts with trade and industrial unions in connection with
campaigns for the organization of labor, and in behalf of the
unemployed; in the development of consumers’ cooperatives;
in the formulation of, and agitation for labor legislation and
constitutional changes; in the fight against fascism, militar-
ism and war; in the development of working class cultural
enterprises, in the building of a genuine farmer-labor party,
and in other efforts calculated to advance labor’s interest and
assist workers in the achievement of a cooperative order of
society. ‘

Mobilize Masses

In these efforts toward cooperative and united action,
attention should be directed primarily to the mobilization in

 

 

RESOLUTIONS 31

behalf of the above objects not of the small minority of
workers already committed to an advanced or revolutionary
program, but to the great masses of workers of hand and
brain. Socialist party members within the union should be
ever on the alert to take advantage of opportunities for
healthful party—union cooperation. All cooperative and united
front activities, must, in the nature of the case, have the
sanction of the appropriate party committee.

Every suggestion of cooperation with progressive groups
in behalf of civil liberties, peace and economic change
should be considered on its own merits. In deciding whether
the party should enter into any’ united front activities, the
question of the effect of such united front both upon the
object to be achieved by such cooperation, and upon the
development of the Socialist movement, must be seriously
considered. The party must ever guard itself, on the one hand,
against becoming isolated from the great stream of working
class life and, on the other hand, against becoming submerged
in that stream.

Conditions

In considering cooperative or united front activities with
the Communist party in the defense of civil rights, in the
struggle against militarism and war, or in the fight in behalf
of the unemployed, each case of proposed cooperation should
be considered separately, and should depend upon several
conditions. Among those are:

1. Whether such action is likely to make the Socialist
party more or less effective in the work of reaching the masses
in behalf of the object for which cooperation is proposed.

2. Whether the plan for cooperation proposes the setting
up of a committee or committees representative of various
branches of the labor and progressive movement, or of only
Socialist and Communist groups. The party, in any united
front action, must seek to form committees not dominated by
any one party, but controlled by groups representative of
various forces in the labor and progressive movement.

3. Whether the proposed united front activities absorb
energy of party members out of proportion to the promised
results.

Of course no such united front activities should be decided
upon without the consent of the state committees or such
local committees to which the state committee has delegated
power, if such activity is activity within a state, or without
the consent of the appropriate national committee of the
party if the united undertaking is national in scope.

V
SPAIN
The National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party,
U. S. A., at its meeting in Philadelphia, May 7-9, adopted the follow-
ing resolution on Spain in accordance with the instruction of the
National Convention of the party.

Aid to the Spanish Struggle
The Socialist party of the United States calls upon the

port of the anti-fascist fighters in Spain, who under the
Caballero government, the trade unions" and working class
parties, have been waging a heroic defense, under heavy odds,
against the feudal-fascist rebellion.

This struggle of the Spanish workers is of concern not only
to Spain, but to the entire international working class. A
victory for fascism in Spain would open the sluice gates for
world reaction. It would be a signal for a wave of suppression
against the workers in all countries, and would make more
imminent the threatening World war.

The forces of capitalist reaction throughout the world
have rallied in this struggle to the side of the Spanish rebels.
The forces of. the working class have been rallying to their
comrades, the Workers and peasants of Spain.

Struggle for Socialism

While this conflict in Spain may appear superficially as a
clash between democracy and capitalist fascism it is in fact
a struggle between a declining capitalism, rapidly developing
into fascism, and a Socialist society.

It was the Spanish Workers who compelled the government
to take vigorous action against the fascists when the con-
spiracy first broke out in July, 1936. Into an anti-fascist unity

workers of America and of all countries to rally to the sup-. .

 

RESOLUTIONS . 33

have come the Socialist Party of Spain, the Communist Party,
the Anarchists, and the two powerful federations of trade
unions; while along with them have been fighting substantial
bodies of anti-fascist Catholics and the lower bourgeoisie.

During the period of this revolt, the capitalist powers have
carried through a policy which has directly aided fascism.
Italy and Germany have participated in an actual invasion,
contrary to capitalist international law and the principl-es of
international decency to which they have repeatedly give
lip service. - ‘

Great Britain, through its vassal, Portugal, has actively
aided the Rebel cause; it has blocked or sabotaged every effort
of the Loyalist Government, in accord with established inter-
national practice, to arm itself and to crush the Fascists.
The government of France, despite the fact it rests upon the
Socialist and Communist Parties which are in sympathy with
the legitimate Spanish government, has followed the demands
of the Radical Socialists in the Popular Front for a policy of
collaboration with the British Tories.

Especially deserving of condemnation is the Administration
at Washington, which under the guise of a false neutrality,
has allowed the free shipment of war materials to Italy and
Germany while blocking arms shipments 'to Spain and even
attempting for a time to prevent the sending of food and
mediacl aid to the Spanish people. .

From such an attitude on the part of outside governments
has come the encouragement to the Spanish Rebels which is
responsible for converting an otherwise easily crushed re-
bellion into a devastating war.

For Workers’ Solidarity

The answer to such international reaction must be the
intensification of international working class solidarity, which
must become the practice of the workers, political parties and
the trade unions if further international aggression is to be
prevented. Nor will the initiating of such aggression neces-
sarily be confined to Fascist countries; the workers in demo-
cratic capitalist countries must be on guard against such
action by their governments.

34 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

The labor movement of Spain, under the guidance of
Francisco Largo Caballero, Socialist and trade union leader,
took upon. itself the responsibilities of government after

liberal-conservative elements had failed to sustain a vigorous

defense. Thus the world’s working class cannot consider the
present government, primarily dominated by labor elements,
and not resting on the old state apparatus, as a bourgeois
regime.

It came to power, however, not only under the handicap
of rebellion which grew in the first place out of weakness and
indecision on the part of the governments immediately pre-
ceding, but through a long series of failures by previous
Republican regimes to divide the land, eliminate reactionary
leaders from the armed forces, give freedom to the Moors,
and destroy the power of the feudal church functionaries in
politics, in education, and in the capitalist operation of in-
dustry. 

The Caballero government faces the task, as a provisional
revolutionary regime, not only of conducting a unified de-
fense, but of consolidating the elementary gains already made
by the workers in the direction of Socialization, and laying
the foundations of a Cooperative Commonwealth. The Fascist
attack was answered by a spontaneous demand of the long
oppressed toilers for greater control of their economic life.
They proceeded to occupy certain areas of land and some of
the factories, which they operated without profit, with the
full consent of the government.

But the complete fulfillment of Socialist purpose does not
come automatically. It must be impelled by" the conscious
aspirations of the workers, led by their revolutionary parties.
All Socialists, therefore, while reserving the right to criticize
the present government to the extent that it fails to press for
a thorough-going program of Socialism, must give the govern-

. ment unstinting and effective support.

We will give our encouragement to a program for Spain
based on the realization that the successful conclusion of the
present conflict and the establishment of a' Socialist Spain
depend upon the progressive establishment of committees of
workers, peasants, and militiamen and the eventual trans-

 

 

RESOLUTIONS , 35

formation of such bodies into a workers government; upon
workers’ control of production and the collectivization of the
important industrial plants; upon the systematic turning of
land over to the peasantry"; upon the freeing of Spanish ‘colon-
ies; and upon the granting of autonomy to national minorities
within the framework of the federal structure. . -.

The workers and peasants, and even large sections of the
middle class, can be won to support of the present struggle,
as well as to the establishment of a new social order, not on
the basis of the status quo or the restoration of a discredited
“democracy” but on the basis of a new life for the masses on
a Socialist foundation.

In the last analysis, effective aid for Spain must come
from the workers of all countries and not from governments.
Even the Soviet Union, which with Mexico, has been conspi-
cuous among governments for invaluable assistance to the
Loyalist forces, has felt obliged to sign the non—intervention
pact, tolerate the setting up of a blockade, while the Com-
munists, subordinating Spanish policy to Soviet foreign di-
plomacy, have sought to limit the struggle to one for the
preservation of bourgeois democracy.

For Anti-Fascist Unity

Since it is obvious and indisputable that victory depends
upon labor unity, the Socialist p-arty looks with apprehension
at the recent events indicating division in the ranks of the
workers. We are firmly opposed to insurrections against the
government over differences of policy in this period of civil
war. We are likewise opposed to repressive methods by the
government against any working class organization which is
fighting loyally to defeat the Fascist foe. '

We call for independent proletarian assistance to Spain in
such form as the Debs volunteers, the Garibaldi Battalion,

. the Abraham Lincoln column, the International Brigade; the

collections of food, clothing, medical supplies and funds; the
sending of doctors, nurses, and technical experts. We will con-
tinue our work -through the North -American Committee for
Spanish Democracy and for the relief of the Basque refugees.

But all aid for Spain from workers and sympathetic middle

 

    

36 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

class elements alike must be promoted and coordinated on an
international scale. We therefore call upon the Socialist and
Communist Internationals, the International Federation of
Trade Unions, and all independent working class organiza-
tions to convoke at the earliest possible date a thoroughly
representative International Labor Congress for Aid to Spain
to mobilize the workers of the world in the task of defeating
Spanish Fascism.

Only the international proletariat can defeat the inter-
national legions of Fascism.

VI

NORTH AMERICAN COMMITTEE TO AID
SPANISH DEMOCRACY

The Socialist party, affiliated nationally with the North
American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy, directs its
membership and its local organizations throughout the United
States to engage in the work of the local and branches of the
North American Committee, devoted to raising funds for food,
clothing and medical care for Spanish workers struggling
against the forces of international fascism.

VII
FARMER-LABOR PARTY

The great awakening of the workers requires as its logical
next step the definite development of independent working
class political action. The Socialist party, therefore, renews
its advocacy and support of a genuine farmer—labor party.
It instructs its members in labor unions, farmers associations
and other mass organizations to give all possible support to
the proper formation of such a party on a national scale.
Where local parties are formed, they should be definitely
committed to the creation of a national party. This convention
instructs its executive committee: to cooperate in building a
national farmer-labor party whenever circumstances are
favorable; to advise and confer with local and state Socialist
party subdivisions concerning local Socialist participation in
local and state farmer-labor parties, the final power of

 

 

RESOLUTIONS 37

approval or disapproval to rest with the National Executive
Committee.
Conditions of Participation

The Socialist party lays down as conditions of participa-
tion in any farmer-labor party the following principles:

1. The party must consciously repre-sent the interests of
workers with hand and brain, and must‘ be independent of
and opposed to all existing capitalist parties.

2. It must, from its first inception, have the definite
support of important sections of organized farmers and
workers and also be open to individual members supporting
its principles and aims.

3. The farmer—labor party should be committed at least to
the general principle of production for use. The national
farmer—labor party or any local farmer-labor party should
assert the principle of continuing democratic control over
such of their candidates as they may elect to office.‘

4. The farmer—labor party should permit the affiliation
of the Socialist party as a unit, or failing that, to receive
Socialist support, it must permit membership of Socialists on
terms compatible with the maintenance of the Socialist party.

Since Socialism and not the mere formation of a farmer-
labor party is our hope against exploitation, reaction and
fascism, this convention reaffirms the absolute necessity of
the preservation and growth of the Socialist party, under
conditions, if possible, which will permit its democratic and
open participation in a farmer-labor party or its cooperation
with such a party in an electoral campaign.

Role of Socialists in Farmer-Labor Party

The Socialist party will not merely be a Socialist or
educational league or fraction inside such a party, but will be
apolitical party. It will carry on activities both inside and
outside the Labor party on all fronts; it will take a stand on
all questions of the day; it will elaborate programs of actions
reaching beyond the program of the Labor party. The
Socialist party will recruit membership, present its full
program to the workers, and to the workers inside the Labor
party in particular, work for the building of amass revolu-

38 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

tionary Socialist party so as to prepare the workers for social

revolutionary action. ,

The above resolution was adopted by the Convention as the basis
for the publicly stated position of the party. The National Executive
Committee was instructed to send out directives and a prospectus for
Socialist party work along lines of independent political action in
line with the resolution presented below:

VIII
LABOR PARTY

Only a revolutionary Socialist party can successfully lead
and prepare the working class for a struggle against war and
fascism and for the conquest of power. The Socialist party
therefore must maintain and strengthen its party organiza-
tion and its independent forces.

Socialist Party Necessary

A Labor party, i.e., a mass party resting primarily upon
the trade unions running working class candidates in opposi-
tion to capitalist candidates, cannot take the place of the
Socialist party. A Labor party is, by its nature, reformist. Its

_ activities are restricted to the improvement of the conditions

of the workers within the framework of capitalism.

The rising class struggle in the United States, bringing
masses of workers into conflict with the capitalist state, finds
its political expression in the desire of the more militant
workers to enter the electoral arena with their trade unions,
against the capitalist parties.

Independent Labor Party vs. Peoples Front

This Labor party movement of the progressive workers
meets opposition not only from the reactionary labor leaders
and traditions (“Reward your friends and punish your
-enemies”) but also from the libe-ral labor leaders and the
Communist party who are orientated toward an American
People’s Front in the form of an alliance with the liberal
capitalist parties and politicians, with some attempt at work
from within the Democratic party. i 

 

RESOLUTIONS 39

In the present struggle insid-e the trade union movement
between the progressive workers, who seek an independent
Labor party, and the reformist forces, who seek a P'eople’s
Front, Socialists stand with the pro-Labor party forces. The
strengthening of the movement toward an independent Labor
party within the trade union movement is one of the chief
means of breaking class conscious workers away from the idea
of a People’s Front.

Socialists in. the trade unions, therefore, raise the slogan
of an independent Labor party as a concrete expression on
the present scene of independent working class political
action, because, in the event that such a party is organized on
a national scale, it would signify a progressive step in the
class development of the American workers; and, in the event
that such a Labor party does notcome into being, the struggle
for its creation will strengthen the inﬂuence and leade.rship
of the Socialist party among the class conscious workers.

‘Characteristics of Labor‘ Party

The Labor party, if it is to be an effective working class
political instrument, and not an artificial creation or a mere
electoral alliance, should have the following characteristics:

1. It must be national in character and structure.

2. It must be a mass party numbering millions of follow-
ers. .
3. It must have the trade unions as the main base.

4. It must be dominated by the working: class and its
organizations.

5. It must be organized primarily on a federated basis.

6. Affiliation shall be open to all working class organiza-
tions, to organizations of farmers and of professions that agree
to abide by its constitution and program and to support it
nominees in the election campaign. v

The Socialist party realizes that the Labor party, especial-
ly in its early stages, will not be Socialistic. It may not even
have a satisfactory program of immediate demands. But the
activities and experiences of the masses in the Labor p-arty
will prepare them for Socialism. Therefore the Socialist party
declares that a Labor party would not be a competitor of the

40 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

socialist party. The Socialist party will cooperate fully with
the Labor party when it is formed and become a. constituent
organization of the Labor party.

National Labor Party

Experience with state and local labor parties in the entire
period of the existence of the Labor party movement has
shown that these organizations, as a general rule are unstable,
tend toward alliances with the capitalist parties, become
hunting grounds for discredited politicians, and, therefore,
rather than serve as a focal point for the development of a
national labor party, they merely serve to discredit the idea
of such a party. The Socialist party shall, therefore, as a
general policy, not support or urge the formation of local or
state labor parties. Where the party is satisfied that such
parties are based upon the broadest strata of the organized
working class, are completely independent of old capitalist
parti-es or politicians, have a working class program, and are
sufficiently stable to serve as a means of promoting a
national Labor party movement, these partie-s may be sup-
ported and joined. In such cases, however, the Socialist
party must take steps to guarantee its own parliamentary and
electoral existence and independence, so that a collapse of the
local or state labor parties will not find the party in a helpless
situation.

The Socialist party fully understands that as yet nationally
the Labor party movement does not have a sufficiently broad
base to find general organizational expression. The Labor

_ party slogan is therefore a slogan of propaganda and not of

action at this time. The Socialist party shall under no circum-
stances participate in or support any movement for the arti-
ficial launching of a national Labor party without a
substantial mass trade union base and a real possibility for
permanent organization.

Must Be-a Class Party

The Labor party to be a valuable instrument must be a
class party of the organized proletariat. It is, therefore,
necessary to resist all attempts at alliances with the third

 ,

 

.v> ‘ .

RESOLUTIONS . M

party movements which reduce labor organizations to mere
appendages of middle class liberals and politicians. The
conception of a Labor party as a People’s front is in essence a
capitulation to middle class pressure against a Labor party.
A People’s Front Labor party will open the door to the
discontented petty bourgeoisie to convert a Labor party into
a third anti-monopoly capitalist party and therefore an
enemy of the labor movement. The Socialist party will,
therefore, fight vigorously against all such tendencies.

Where the trade unions are willingly or unwillingly tied
up with a middle class third party (like the La Follette
Wisconsin Progressive party) in a mixed A Farmer-Labor-
Liberal coalition, the Socialist party should resist with all its
energy the formation of such an alliance. It must put forth
the slogan of independent working class political action, form
a bloc with the trade unions and other working class organiza-
tions and struggle to crystalize out of the situation a genuine
Labor party on a disciplined, class basis.

A movement for independent political action by the
middle and lower sections of the farmers, occuring simul-
taneously with a Labor party movement, creates the possibility
for an alliance between the working class and the farmers in
the form of a Farmer-Labor party. The efforts of the Socialists

must be directed toward maintaining the dominant influence .

of the proletariat. and against such concessions to the farm
element. as will destroy the Farmer-Labor party as a class
party. .
A Labor party based upon individual membership as a
basic form will tend to be a middle class third party. Only a
federated party, based upon the class organizations of the
workers, guarantee the mass and class basis of it and prevent
it being a mere third party. Individual membership will make
easy the entry into a Labor party of anti-labor demagogues
and their followers and will thus vitiate the progressive
character of the Labor party.

Fight Against Individual Membership

Therefore, in the interests of a genuine Labor party, the
Socialist party will fight vigorously against a Labor party

.

4_-. vs M-,..<:A;._;;::—¢-A g _

  
  

42 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

based upon individual membership or having individual
membership as its basic form.

Where labor parties or labor party movements, national,
state or local, in spite of the resistance of the Socialists,
organize upon an individual membership basis, entrance under
discipline of any section of the party membership into such a
Labor party may be carried out only with the specific approval
of the National Executive Committee.

The Socialist party warns that affiliation of the member-
ship of the party with the Labor party on an individual basis
will tend to liquidate the Socialist party as an independent
organization by setting up competition in recruiting and
allegiance. Under no circumstances can the Socialist party
give in to sentiment for Socialist party liquidation out of fear
of isolation. By demonstrating to the workers that the
struggle against individual membership is a struggle in the
interests of a genuine Labor party, the Socialist party will
break its isolation and simultaneously preserve its integrity
and organization.

Role of Socialist Party Within Labor Party

The Socialist party will not merely be a Socialist or educa-
tional league or fraction inside such a party, but will be a.
political party. It will carry on activities both inside and
outside the Labor party on all fronts; it will take a stand on
all questions of the day; it will elaborate programs of actions
reaching beyond the program of the Labor party. The Socialist
party will recruit membership, present its full program to the
workers, and to the workers inside the Labor party in particu-
lar, work for the building of a mass revolutionary Socialist
party so as to prepare the workers for social revolutionary
action.

The crash of 1929 and ensuing years of crisis changed the

outlook of the American working class. The entire burden of
the depression was put on the backs of the workers. The

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
   

RESOLUTIONS 43

American Federation of Labor with its policies of craft unions
and class collaboration could not stop the offensive of the
capitalists against the worke-rs which continued until 1933.

The years 1933 and 1934 marked a new trend. Because of
signs of an upward swing in the country, workers began to
organize to make up for the losses growing out of the depres-
sion. Rubber, auto and textile workers were among the first
to launch organization campaigns and conduct strikes. Where
there was a lack of industrial organization and aggressive
strike policy the A. F. of L. leadership was in the main
responsible for the large scale failure of these efforts.

The lessons of 1934 convinced large sections of the A. F.
of L. that the old policies were no longer sufficient.

Committee for Industrial Organization

This led to the organization of the Committee for
Industrial Organization which marked one of the most
significant developments in the American labor movement.
In the short time of its existence it has made unprecedented
inroads in the steel, auto, rubber and electrical appliance
industries. It has started a campaign in the textile and
clothing industries. Overnight the C. I. O. has fired the
imagination of millions of unorganized workers.

The Socialist party endorses the C’. I. O. and urges
unanimous support from its party members.

Relationship: C. I. 0.—A. F. L.

Jealous of their interests, the Executive Council of the
A. F. of L. took organizational steps in order to destroy this
progressive tendency.

The suspension of the C. I. O. unions by the Executive
Council of the A. F. of L. before the 1936 convention created
the danger of a split in the American labor movement, and
the convention action made the situation worse by changing
the structure of the A. F. of L. in central labor unions
and federal locals. The recent letter of William Green to
central labor bodies recommending the suspension of C. I.
0. union locals has increased this danger. The Socialist party

 

 

 

44 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

was oppos-ed to their suspension nationally and is opposed to
their suspension from local and state bodies. In the important
struggles of the auto and steel workers, the executive council
of the A. F. of L. played a disruptive role by fighting the
recognition of the auto and steel workers unions as the sole
bargaining agencies for the workers.

On the other hand there are many active workers inspired
by the recent victories of the C. I. 0. who are ready to abandon
the A. F. of L. These workers should guard against hasty
action which may endanger the well being of their organiza-
tion within the A. F. of L. This applies particularly to members
in locals of unions and delegates to central labor bodies.

While it must be recognized that the C‘. I. 0. will be
responsible for setting into motion millions of unorganized
workers, the A. F. of L. will still maintain its hold on a
substantial section of organized workers, as have the railroad
brotherhoods and other non-A. F. of L. rail labor organiza-
tions.

Preserve Unity

It is therefore the duty of progressive forces in the labor
movement——both in the C. I. O. and A. F. of L.——to strive to
preserve the unity of labor in such a manner that it will be
possible to organize the workers in mass production industries
along industrial lines while prev-enting wasteful‘ and exhaust-
ing conflicts where craft unions are solidly entrenched.

Should the progressives fail in their efforts to preserve
organic unity, then it is the duty of the progressive forces to
see to it that no rival organization be set up in each and every
industry arbitrarily developing dual unionism throughout the
length and breadth of the United States. Affiliation must be
subject to the aim of keeping the largest possible section of
already organized workers intact from split and internal civil
war.

The progressive forces, supporters of industrial unionism,
who constitute a minority in the internationals affiliated with
the A. F. of L., shall continue to work to win over their inter-
nationals to progressive unionism and for eventual re-unifica-
tion of the labor movement.

 

RESOLUTIONS 45

Recognize Dangers

In rendering support to the C. I. O. in its drive to organize
the unorganized, the socialist party recognizes the short-
comings of the C. I. 0. Just as the A. F. of L. leadership has
its tie—up with the old parties, so the main leadership of the
C. I. O. is depending upon a political alliance with the Demo-
cratic party. In this alliance appears the danger of accep-
tance by the labor movement of compulsory arbitration of
labor disputes, and the further danger of capitulation by the
C‘ I. O. to the war machine of the capitalist state. As in the
A. F. of L., some C. I. O. unions suffer from a lack of dem-
ocracy. We declare that only to the extent that the C. I. O.
unions effectively organize and function along democratic
lines and pursue a militant policy will they become a model
for the entire labor movement.

Despite the belief that the increased interest of the
workers in unionization is due to the_ “liberal” policy of the
Roosevelt administration, we, as Socialists, must recognize
that the basic reasons for the present organization drive
is to be found in the temporary economic recovery of capi-
talism, rising prices, and the recognition by workers of the
need for protecting‘ their jobs, fighting 1 against a speed-up
displacement and other oppressive measures.

Workers’ Alliance

This improved economic situation is only partial and
temporary. The large part in present recovery played by war
preparations and armaments is a particularly treacher-
ous factor with obvious limitations on possible length of
recovery. Unemployment will continue to be a problem and
the unemployed will continue to be a threat to union stand-
ards unless there be established a close bond between the
employed and unemployed. The best way of accomplishing
this is for the organized labor movement to support the
organization of the unemployed into the Workers’ Alliance
and to support their struggles for the right to work. and
social security. It shall be the duty of Socialist trade unionists
not only to carry out the above policy but also to work for a

program leading; to closer relationships between the trade
unions and the Workers’ Alliance.

POLICY

For Socialists in Trade Unions

Basis for, and method of Socialist Work in the trade unions.

1. The Socialist Party of the United States reaffirms that
the trade union movement is the broadest organization base
for the workers’ struggle for their most elementary economic
and political demands.

2. Our party therefore identifies itself with the trade
union movement in these struggles. It indicates to the work-
ers that through the struggle for their demands against the
capitalist class will the ‘workers forge a mighty weapon for
their liberation.

3. In supporting the trade union movement we are forever
mindful of its shortcomings and limitations. The trade
unions, because of their elementary character, are interested
primarily in obtaining immediate economic gains. As a
consequence of this primary interest the role of the trade
union movement is necessarily limited. With its emphasis
on immediate gains, the trade union movement cannot alone
be the instrument for the emancipation of the working class
from capitalism. The Socialist party represents the interests
of the entire working class and is prepared to serve its
ultimate as well as its immediate aims.

4. The Socialist party, therefore, makes it mandatory
upon all its members who are eligible to join a trade union
in their industry to do so, and Where none is in existence to
participate in the formation of one.

5. The Socialists in each trade union body—1ocal, national,
central labor or state—shal1 comb-ine in a Socialist League for
the purpose of carrying out Socialist work among the work-
ers in an intelligent, organized manner.

 

RESOLUTIONS 4'7

6. For the purpose of advancing progressive organiza-
tional policies and the economic interests of the workers,
the Socialists in the trade unions shall aim to unite with
progressive workers who agree with such policies but are as
yet not ready to accept the full Socialist program. The
Socialists should, through their activity, devotion and intel-
ligent leadership, strive to win leadership in these groups.
They should at all times be careful to conduct themselves
so as to draw those progressive workers closer to the Socialist
point of view. By this work the trade union section of the
party becomes a recruiting center for the party. The Socialist
League has as one of its necessary functions the bringing
into the party of these progressive workers. In their relation-
ship with broader forces even of an avowedly progressive
character Socialists shall not submerge or sacrifice the inde-
pendent role which they, of necessity, must play.

7. The Socialists in trade unions, while entering alliances
on specific issues which they feel will aid in moving the
labor movement forward, must not allow themselves to aid
any group whose program is opposed to the best interest of
the workers or fundamental policies of the Socialist party.
In this connection it is important to recognize that the Com-
munist party is once again reverting; to its former disruptive
tactics. It abandoned the policy of dual unionism and urged
its members to re—enter the main stream of the American
labor movement. It was expected—and in many instances
carried out——that their reentry into the labor movement
would mean that the Socialist party and all class con-
scious forces would be strengthened. But today, and ever
since the last congress of the Communist International,
the trad-e union role of the C. P. has become not only
confused and opportunist but in important instances
reactionary and disruptive. It has openly campaigned against
any Socialist with whom it disagrees or whom it charges
with “Trotskyism.” It has tried to secure the removal of
Socialists who are trade union organizers. It has carried on
a campaign of slander and vilification against the party at
the same time. as it has raised a new version of the theory
of social fascism, i. e., “Trotsky-Fascism.”

8. The Socialist party must maintain a functioning trade
union department with a full time secretary. The duty
of this department shall be to direct the carrying out of the
trade union policy of the party. Under its general supervision,
state and city sub—divisions shall b-e set up which shall co-
ordinate this work. Under the supervision of the national
trade union department, national committees shall be formed
in the various international unions and industries for the
purpose of coordinating the work of Socialist Leagues and
the development of a coordinated policy for each industry.
The national committees shall from time to time call con-
ferences for the purpose of formulating and clarifying the
Socialist policy in particular fields.

PROGRAM

For Socialists in Trade Unions

The following shall be the program of the Socialist party
in the trade union movement. The application of this pro-
gram and emphasis it will receive may of course vary from
union to union. In addition to this general program there
will of course arise many specific issues in various organiza-
tions which will necessitate the‘ working out of a program
for each industry.

1. For trade union unity "in the American labor move-
ment.. The establishment of one union in each industry.
Discouragement of the division of workers in any given
industry between the existing trade union centers.

Support shall be given to the C. I. O. in its efforts to
organize the millions of unorganized workers. In those in-
dustries and trades where there are functioning unions of
the A. F. of L. which are carrying on a real campaign to
organize the unorganized, we should assist in such efforts.

2. Vigorous support for the industrial union policy of the
C. I. O. in the organization of the unorganized workers. The
advocacy of the amalgamation of the craft unions within
any given industry dominated by the A. F. of L. or the
C. I. O.

 

RESOLUTIONS 49

3. Our comrades shall support a vigorous class struggle
policy. We urge primarily for the trade union movement to
rely on its organizedstrength to strike for its demands. We
support direct negotiations in preference to arbitration and
reliance on government agencies. We support national action
in preference to local or ‘regional action. We advocate reli-
ance on militant action of the "workers rather than negotia-
tions as a primary weapon. At all times hold before the
workers the objectives of winning 100 per cent union shop
in the industry. We oppose all forms of class collaboration
which devitalize the fighting capacities of the working class.

4. We support trade union democracy. Union affairs must
be controlled by the membership. The workers must deter-
mine the policies of the union and must democratically elect
officers to carry out this policy. Machinery for democratic
control must include the following:

a. Regular conventions of international unions not
less than oncein two years.

b. Regular and frequent elections of local and inter-

national officers.

c. Participation of the workers in every day union
activity through formation of organization committees,
shop committees, shop chairman, shop delegates, and
shop delegate councils. Participation of workers in the
actual determination and control of strike policy and
settlement, especially through vote of the entire mem-
bership.

d. Socialists shall advocate the establishment of
functioning educational departments for workers edu-
cation in all international and local unions.

5. Socialists shall fight against race discrimination in
the unions and in the shops.

6. Socialists shall insist on. equal pay for equal work
regardless of sex or age.

7. Socialists shall campaign for independent working
class political action, as determined by national policy of the
party.

The convention accepted a resolution as the basis for
the party’s position on unemployed work. This resolution
was referred by‘ the National Executive Committee to the
standing sub-committee on unemployed work to formulate
the position of the party based on three main principles, i. e.:
1. Endorsement of the Workers Alliance as the organiza-
tion of the unemployed and full cooperation using all the
resources of the party.

2. Maintaining an independent Socialist position within
the mass organization.

3. To work for increasing cooperation with the organized
labor movement.

XI
CONSUMERS COOPERATIVES

One of the great working class movements in the world
at the present day is the consumers’ cooperative movement,
which seeks to organize the workers and others as consumers
for their mutual advantage. In many countries abroad a
large minority or a majority of working class families are
members of cooperative societies. Such societies usually
work in close cooperation with the trade union, the educa-
tional and political working class movements in their respec-
tive countries, and have the active cooperation of the labor
and Socialist movement. '

Obstacle in U. S.

In the United States, the consumers’ cooperative move-
ment has lagged behind that in many other parts of the
world. The main reason, for this is the fact that most of
the people of the United States have been more concerned
with questions of production and the development of new
sections of the country than with the question of distribu-
tion. The individualistic psychology of the American people;

 

RESOLUTIONS 51

the differences in race and nationality; the development of
the large chain, department store and mail order houses; the
lack of educational preparedness of many engaged in co-
operative ventures; the emerg-ence of spurious cooperatives
masquerading as genuine cooperative undertakings have like-
wise t-ended to hinder the growth of the cooperative mov-
ment in this country;

Many of these obstacles are gradually being surmounted,
and during the last few years the cooperative movement
has been growing rapidly in many sections of the United
States.

Rochdale Plan

Abroad, bona fide consumers’ cooperatives have been
built upon Rochdale principles. Under the Rochdale plan,
every member of a cooperative store is entitled to one vote
and no more than one vote in the determination of the poli-
cies of the coope-rative. Goods are sold on a cash basis.

The member of the cooperative receives a savings return
at the end of each quarter in proportion to purchases made.
Cooperatives usually set aside from their earnings a sub-
stantial sum for educational purposes. From the retail estab-
lishment, the cooperatives reach back to wholsale estab-
lishments, to factories and occasionally to farms. A fixed
interest is paid on capital. No employee from the highest
to the . lowest secures from the cooperative more than a
service income.

Achievements

In general the consumers’ cooperative movement abroad
has possessed certain values for the workers. It has helped
to raise living standards by reducing living costs, by ensur-
ing better quality of goods sold, and by providing for some-
what better conditions of labor among cooperative employees
than those found in private industry. It has provided an
experimental laboratory for consumer democracy in indus-
try. It has been in many instances a genuine help to the
workers in their trade union and political struggles. It has
offered another proof of the practicability and desirability
of production for use and not for profit. It has encroached

on the field of private ownership and has weakened in a
number of countries the power of capitalist enterprise. It has
promoted workers’ education, and has been one of many
forces that have brought toge-ther workers of various lands.

In some countries, unfortunately, many millions have re-
garded the movement as merely a means of saving a few
dollars a year to wage--earners and salary workers, but in
most contries the role of consumers’ cooperatives has been
a broad and important one in working class life.

52

Dangers

In the coming years in the United States, the movement
faces genuine possibilities of growth «and social influence. It
also_faces a number of dangers. It is in danger of being
controlled by those who regard cooperation as merely another
means of reducing the cost of living, and who fail to realize
the great social possibilities of the movement. On the other
hand, it is in danger of being controlled by those who regard
consumers’ cooperation as the one sure and painless path to
Utopia and who would separate the cooperative movement
from other working class organizations.

Role of Consumer Cooperative

Socialists should study the cooperative movement and
become active within it. In doing so, they should assist
the movement in avoiding both of the above mentioned
dangers. The value of the cooperative movement, when prop-
erly directed, cannot be estimated in terms of dollars and
cents. At the same time, this movement, no matter how
valuable, should not be looked upon as a substitute for the
political and industrial movements of labor dedicated to the
abolition of capitalism and the attainment of a cooperative
commonwealth. Nor can the cooperative movement in and of
itself be looked to as a means for the abolition of war and
fascism. It must be regarded as one of several movements of the
workers of value to them in their fight for better conditions
today and for far flung social change. Labor should organize
as consumers. But it must also organize as citizens in pow-

RESOLUTIONS 53

erful political organizations; as producers in trade and indus- ‘

trial unions and as students in its own educational move-
ment.

Socialists and Cooperatives

Before initiating cooperative‘ ventures, Socialists should
become well acquainted with the best literature- on the move-
ment and the experiences of others in organizing and devel-
oping successful cooperative undertakings. They should start
cooperatives in fields where the prices of commodities sold,
the competitive situation and the general social and economic
environment are such as to promise, under ordinary circum-
stances a successful outcome. The Socialist cooperator should
bring together an initial group that promises to be good coop-
erative material.

Within a cooperative, the Socialist should use his inﬂu-
ence to keep the enterprise loyal to Rochdale principles; to
obtain the selection of men and women of efficiency and
social vision; to see that genuine collective bargaining and
good labor conditions are guaranteed among cooperative
employees; to induce the cooperative to engage in broad
educational work; bring about a close relationship between
cooperatives and the movements of labor onythe economic and
political fields, and to introduce the cooperative members to
the Socialist movement.

Socialists within cooperatives shall organize Socialist
Leagues for the purpose of strengthening the cooperative
movement and of presenting most effectively the Socialist
viewpoint. In organizing these Leagues, the aim of the
Socialist party must not be misunderstood. The Socialist
party does not seek to make the cooperative movement sub-
ordinate to the political movement, nor does it seek to make
the political movement subordinate either to the cooperative or
trade union movement. The Socialist party does seek to develop
a sound perspective in and sound relationships between the-se
three movements. The policies and perspectives to be ad-
vanced by Socialists in the cooperative movement must be
determined by democratic consultation and action of Social-
ists who are working in the cooperative movement. The
party should call conferences of Socialist coope-rators to dis-

‘ cuss how best they may advance the movement and the

Socialist cause within that movement.

Publicity and Literature

The convention wishes to congratulate the Socialist Call
for its excellent columns on cooperation edited by Benjamin
Wolf and to urge the Socialist press to continue to give publici-

V ty to the cooperative movement. It likewise urges the appoint-

ment of a Committee on Cooperation and the issuance of
pamphlet literature and instructions to party membership
giving the Socialist point of view. It calls attention to the
new developments in cooperative buying organizations to the
literature published by the educational center of the con-
sumers cooperative movement iii the United States, the Coop-
erative League of America, 167 W. 12th Street, New York, N. Y.

It believes that the time has arrived to bring the ideals
and practices of the cooperative movement before the trade
and industrial union movement through well organized labor
cooperative leagues. It urges the Socialist party committee
on Consumers’ Cooperation to assist as vigorously as possible
in the development of such leagues.

XII
AGRICULTURE

The Socialist party renews its contention that under our
economic system of production for profit, insofar as agri-
cultural economy is concerned, the chief products are waste
and poverty. On the one hand our natural resources are laid
bare and run to seed without any thought for the good of the
whole or of generations to come; on the other our human
resources are demoralized and pauperized by uncontrollable
forces set in motion by the quest for private profits. More-
over, Socialists see in these contradictions evidences of the
class struggle as sharp and clearly defined as in the indus-
trial field; and it will be one of the functions of Socialist
farmers and agricultural workers to demonstrate out of their
day-to-day experiences fighting side by side with non—Soclal-
ists for immediate gains the validity of this contention.

 

 

RESOLUTIONS 55

Loss of Tenure and Dangers of Tenancy

Access to the land and security in the tenure thereof is
fundamental in the, solution of the agricultural problem.
Today millions of farmers are being denied access to the
only means available to them for making a living and are
being increasingly exploited and impoverished.

The fact that over half of all farms are operated by non-
owners, plainly indicates that tenancy is a major‘ problem con-
fronting the American farmer. While the tenant farmer is
one of the most oppressed groups in America, the small farmer
is rapidly losing all security and is being driven into the
tenant class. With the increased meichanization of agricul-
ture, the concentration of land in the hands of absentee
owners an.d the growth of corporation farming, great num-
bers of farmers and farm workers are being driven from the
land and are becoming low paid wage-earners or are being
saved from starvation only by public or private relief.

Whether small owners, tenant sharecroppers or farm day
laborers, they are faced with a common problem and a com-
mon fate. The only answer is planned economy! in agriculture
for the common good. The Socialist party reaffirms its his-
toric position that land is the common heritage of the people
and that the use and occupancy of it should constitute the
only rightful title to the land.

Land Waste

In recent years, the farmer of the United States has been
increasingly the victim of an unplanned capitalist order.
Private exploitation of land has resulted in soil erosion, soil
exhaustion, widespread and destructive floods, in-creasing
mechanization of. the farm without commensurate gains to
the farmer, loss of world markets and liquidation of small
owners by foreclosure. Millions of farmers have been reduced
to a state of abject poverty.

In the older areas of the country, such as in the South,
where tenancy has been long established and where the peo-
ple are primarily concerned with the security of their tenure,
the major problem is one of giving farmers access to the

56 SOCIALIST HANDBOOK

land. After the Civil War in the South, the slogan of “forty
acres and a mule” was coined, and this program was pre-
sented to that section of the country as containing a solution
of the agricultural problem. At that time, this slogan might
have had meaning. Changsed economic conditions, however,
have made a return to a family-sized farm in the South ut-
terly uneconomic and impracticable. For this reason, we join
with organized labor in America in endorsing the program
of the South-ern Tenant Farmers Union in favor of the de-
velopment of a scientifically planned village economy and
farmers’ cooperatives for this section of the country.

In the Northwest and in other parts of the United States,
millions of farmers are, on the one hand, owners of small,
family-sized farms, and, on the other hand, tenants on small
farms. Where the family—sized farm is still dominant, the
Socialist party pledges itself to join actively with progressive

p farm groups in their efforts to protect the small farm owners

in the retention of their land on the basis of use and occu-
pancy. ,

The Socialist party urges the tenant farmer in these sec-
tions to organize in tenant farmer unions, and to cooperate
in these unions with farm organizations representative of
the small farmer for their mutual protection. Such tenant
unions, we believe, would do w-ell to conduct organization
campaigns along lines somewhat similar to those conducted
by labor organizations.

In California and other states where the large corporation
farm has gained headway, the party urges the transformation
of corporation farms into bona fide cooperative farms. We
urge likewise increasing experiments in socialized agriculture.

The Socialist party puts forward the following program:

1. We demand the public ownership and conservation
of natural resources; the public ownership. and democratic
management of railroads, electrical «energy, telephones and
other public utilities; the public ownership of the large pro-
cessing companies; crop.insurance; the development of bona
fide producers’ and consumers’ cooperatives owned and oper-
ated by farmers and workers; the organization of government
and cooperative marketing agencies, on the boards of which
farmers will be adequately represented; and the extension

 

RESOLUTIONS 57

of necessary credit facilities to farmers and their organiza-
tions at interest rates on a par with those at which the gov-
ernment is able to borrow money.

2. We endorse the establishment of the landless farm
population on the land on the basis of bona fide producers’
cooperatives. We are opposed to the reestablishment of such
workers on land as subsistence farmers with the traditional
“forty acres and a mule.” We contend that the United States
Department of Agriculture is an agency devoted chiefly to
the interests of the large land owners. We, therefore demand
that the reestablishment of the landless farm population be
placed under the jurisdiction of the United States Department
of Labor or some independent agency. Any agency or com-
mittee dealing with this question should contain adequate
representation from the ranks of tenants and farm laborers.

3. We favor the extension of the ‘principle of collective
bargaining to all agricultural workers. We demand that the‘
provisions of the old age pensions, unemployment insurance
and other social insurance laws be extended to such workers.

4. We pledge ourselves to support the formation and
development of an all—inclusive organization of agricultural
workers, including sharecroppers and tenants, to be set up
on the basis of trade unions and to be an integral part of the
American labor movement.

5. We demand a system of taxation which will restore
to society unearned increment resulting from land speculation.

6. We demand a wide extension of federal and state ap-
propriations to farm communities for educational, health
and other social purposes, the money for these services to be
raised from graduated income, inheritance and similar forms
of taxation.

7. We urge the farmer to sever his relation with the
Republican and Democratic parties and to join with us in our
efforts to build a powerful mass party of the nation's workers
committeed to a cooperative social order.

8. We favor the formation by the N. E. C. of a National
Committee on Agriculture, such committee to employ at the
earliest practicable moment full time secretary to coordinate

AN TI-SEMITISM

Whereas, the tactics of fascism rest in part upon the dis-
crediting and outright persecutions of minority groups, espe-
cially the Jewish people; we condemn anti—Semitism in all
its forms and manifestations, assuring the victims of such
repression of our sympathy.

However, we express to the Jewish people our convic-

' anti-Semitism is to build up the working class forces strug-

Introduction

The Socialist party today faces a tremendous responsi-
bility and a special opportunity.

The class lines in America are being drawn more closely

adequate relief for the millions of unemployed.

In state after state the police power and the courts are
being used to defeat the efforts of workers in their attempt
to organize despite a pretended belief in the right of workers
to organize and bargain collectively through unions of their
own choosing.

plans proposed by the governmentindicate how seriously the
government takes the possibility of war and what chance
workers will have under such a war regime.

workers have yet had to meet. This is not because capitalism
has become vicious, but because the development of capitalism
inevitably produces such results.

standard of living for a large part of the American popula-
