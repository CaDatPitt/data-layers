“  DENVER -— Mine - Mill
members in contract nego-
tiations with major sec-
tions of-the non - ferrous

. . metals industry voted ov-

erwhelmingly on June 30 to
give strike authority to their
international union in the
event a settlement cannot be
reached with the employers.
Announcement of the one-
sided strike vote result came
July 2 from International Presi-
dent John Clark at the press
' deadline of the Mine-Mill Un-
ion. Telegrams reporting a re-
4 Sounding “yes” vote were still
pouring in as the union news-
paper went to the printers.
Voting was very heavy with 82
per cent of the votes approv-
ing strike, authority. Clark
said the vote was “Overwhelm-
ing evidence that our members
want more action and less con-
versation from the employ-
ers.”
The question on the ballot,
on which union members were
to vote “yes” or “no” read as

, follows:

“Do youauthorize the Inter-
national Executive board, in
consultation with the National
Wage Policy committee, to di-
rect strike action if no agree-
ment is reached with the em-
ployers?”

The strike vote was author-
ized by the National Wage Pol-

when an overflow membership

umphantly to accept the rec-

Thus - ended the dispute
which kept the plant out of

injunction there could be no

tences or both were feared if
members so much as discussed
with each other Why there

should be no return to the

been considered “influencing”

DENVER —- Irving Dichter,

former District" 6 Executive,

Board member, was elected In-
ternational Secretary-Treasur-
er in the Mine-Mill Interna-
tional referendum held May
19. Official results of the se-
cret ballot membership vote
were certified by the union’s
rank and file Canvassing com-
mittee at its session here June
16-19. x,

In the only other contest for
office, the committee certified
the re-election of incumbent
Chase Powers as Executive
Board member for District 7.

Tabulation of returns on the
proposed amendments to the
union constitution showed that
all four propositions were ap-
proved by the membership,
including the U. S. assessment
amendment.

MARGINS

For the post vacated by in-*

unemployment relief was cut
off because the agency termed
the lookout a “labor dispute.”
DECISIONS

Making it even tougher were
eight adverse decisions against
the union during the three
months and three days fight:
four in the U. S. courts, two
by the Taft-I-Iartley NLRB and
two by the state unemploy-
ment commission. Also hang-
ing over the union’s head was
a company damage suit against
both the local and Internation-

cumbent Secretary - Treasurer
Albert Pezzati who was not a
candidate for re-election, Dich-
ter defeated Charles Wilson,
International Representative in
Arizona, by a vote of 10,311 to
5,224. -Powers won over James
Buck of Selby, Ca1if., Local
51, by a vote of 1,216 to 696.

Election of one new member
to the International Executive
board was certified by the
committee. He is Alfred Petit-
Clair, former regional direc-
tor in New Jersey, who suc-
ceeds Dichter as Board mem-
ber for District 6. Petit-Clair,
running without opposition,
received 4,138 votes.

Other top officers and board
members re-elected without op-
position are:

$800,000 at the time of the
settlement.

Tough as all these condi-
tions were, they did not shake
the memberships determina-
tion to carry on.

The company had fired nine
men, seven of whom were top
grievance and bargaining com-
mitteemen including the local’s
president. Literally hundreds
of disciplinary slips had been
issued by AS&R management,

DENVER—,__-Mine-Mill’s Inter-
national Executive board held
two’ series .of meetings last
month, concentrating on accel-
eration of the union’s collective
bargaining with major compa-
nies in the nonferrous metals
industry (See story in Column
1). Defense of the union and
its leaders likewise was a ma-
jor topic.

The board met here first on
June 9, continuing through
June 11. It met later on«June
22 and_ 23. The June 22 -session
was as part of the National

in line with the policy
which was begun in Jan-

that the board named

Asks 'Rigllfs' Acfion

V A -special legislative bulle-
tin issued June 1 by the Dis-

trict 6 Civil Rights commit-

tee urged local unions to bring
pressure on congress for pas-
sage of a federal anti-lynch
law and stronger federal civil
rights legislation protecting
the right to register and vote.
It also called for opposition
to bills which would curb the
powers of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

Action by locals in Connec-
ticut, New York,‘New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Maryland
Wasurged, in support of the
Javitts anti-lynch, and Douglas
voting rights bills in the Sen-
ate, and against Supreme
Court curbing bills HR 3 and
S3 in the House and Senate.

A federal civil rights law
such as proposed both by
Senators Douglas of Illinois
and Javitts of New York, the
District 6 bulletin pointed out,
would put the ballot in the
_hands of Negroes and working
people in general throughout
the South and “would be an
effective weapon in ending the

flagrant injustices suffered by
citizens of both races who

. advocate the practice of demo-

cracy.” “In such an atmos-
phere,” the bulletin continued,

, “it would become impossible

for an Asbury Howard type of
case to develop.”

The Mack Parker lynching
in Poplarsville, Miss.,

    

“points up the urgent need for
the enactment of a federal

anti-lynch law,”
said.

early last month finally and .

officially Won the union-
backed fight to retain his
United States citizenship
against a four-year effort of
the Immigration service to de-
naturalize and deport him to
Mexico.

A final U. S. District court

‘order permanently enjoined

the U. S. Attorney General and
Immigration service from at-
tempting to deprive Hasso of
his U. S. citizenship and send
him to Mexico. Last March
both the original order that
Hasso be denaturalized be-
cause he allegedly had voted
in a Mexican election and sub-
sequent decision of the Dis-
trict court in Washington, D.
C., sustaining the order were
reversed by the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. which ruled unan-
imously that the evidence
against the local leader was in-
sufficient.

The El Paso District court
issued the final order forbid-
ding Hasso’s deportation when
the Justice Department de-
cided not to appeal the case
to the Supreme court. The

District court upheld Hasso’s -

contention that he has been

Mine-Mill in Canada will be
honored in another way next
September. Norman Dunlevy,
member of the Central council
of the Australian Miners’ Fed-
eration, will be a fraternal
delegate representing the Aus-
tralian miners at the Canadian
Mine-Mill National convention
which opens in Toronto on
September 14. Dunlevy is also
president of the Broken Hill
Miners of the Australian Coal
and Shale Employees’ Federa-
tion, thg metalliferous . section
of the Aussie Miners’ Federa-
tion.

Miners’ Federation general
president W. Parkinson, noti-
fying Mine-Mill’s Canadian
Executive board that Dunlevy
had been named to attend the
convention said that a chief
factor in his organization’s de-
cision to send a fraternal dele-

gate was that “we must never

disregard the cardinal point of
extending and consolidating
international working class
solidarity.” The Australian
miners donated $1292 to Milie-
Mill’s INCO strike fund last

On Monfana Law

The Montana Mine-Mill Leg-

issued a printed 24-page book-
let on Montana’s first occupa-
tional. disease law which the
union, in conjunction with
other farsighted organiza-
tions, was successful in get-
ting written into the state’s
statutes during the past ses-
sion of the Legislature.

The booklet summarizes the
new law’s - provisions, limita-
tions and benefits, and en-
deavors to answer some of the
basic questions that are ex-
pected to come up as it goes
into operation. Sufficient
copies ‘of the booklet were
printed for distribution to all
officers, committeemen and
active leaders of Mine-Mill lo-
cals throughout the state.

A foreword" to the booklet

points out that while the new
legislation is" not a perfect
law, “it is a beginning and

a good law, "providing p_rotec- 
tion to both the employeeand '

goes-on to predict-that certain ’
controversial and ambiguous 9
portions of the law will be
clarified through administra- ’_
tive decision and/or legal ac- 
tion with the result that cer-
tain of the present provisions
will be eliminated or modified’
and amendments added. “Mine-‘

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

BAYARD, N. M.——Western
Vice President Orville Larson
told newspapermen, a radio
audience, and a mass meeting

* sponsored here by Mine-Mill
Local 890 last month that any
“claim of inflation in the min-
i_ng_,_industry is a phony.”
' Larson declared that such
I ‘false claims “won’t influence
Mine-Mill's determination to
win-‘its demands in this year's
: ' ‘ bargaining.” He said the union
' ‘and ‘its members “are serious
in all our demands. Kennecott
,' ’ ‘Copper has doubled its profits
in‘ the last 12 months, over the
previous 12 months, and we
ca’n"t? see how it can conscien-
tiously deny a wage increase
, under those circumstances.”
He continued:

“Our position is this: the
recession in the mining indus-
try has fallen on the workers

‘ rather than on the producers.
‘Costs of living have spiraled,
but mining industry workers
have received no increases dur-
*ing the past three-year con-
tract period.”
“ON. RADIO
. In his radio address, the
Mine-Mill leader was highly
_ critilral of those who want a
j if-—_vvor,ker “to prove that he needs
 a ',wage increase. Moreover,

 

_ -there are some folks who want‘

./‘the worker to prove not only
that he needs more money,

_ but also thatlhis employer can

afford to givefit to him.”
_""Larson said he didn’t “see
 ‘much sense in all this, for you

   can-lt, live‘ in a mining town ”

/‘ye"ryi long. w-ithout knowing

ifJ"i‘It's="strange, but those who“

propose this never seem to

_ advocate denying corporate

 f employers further profit in-

needed, there is plenty on both‘

_ counts——the need of the‘em-

/,___ployye'es in the mining industry

7., and the ability to pay of the
 eIIll310yers.”

‘Larson asserted there are

 V H mm; whv workers in

  .. the nonferrous metals indus-

try deserve wage increases,

-butjhe explored only two: “the

‘tremendous increase in both

‘-5 ' the output of the workers and

S I -in the resultant profits of the
employers.”

While in Grant county, Lar-
son. was interviewed by the
Silver City Daily Press. The

- guards existed in Mine-Mill
‘for. the membership to pre-
serve their control over the

Congress Shops for Proper
Club for Clobbering Labor

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

WASHINGTON, D. C.——The type of so-called labor reform legislation we will

have, if any, should be determined some time this month.

The Labor committee -of the House of Representatives, more specifically its sub-
committee on labor legislation, has been discussing the contents of a bill which would
be reported to the full- committee and then to the floor of the House. At present the

situation is. rather con-
fused, with no one being
able to predict with any cer-
tainty what kind of a bill will
come out on the floor. Every-
one agrees, however, that some
kind of bill will be Written.
The Labor committee, itself,
is divided into several group-
ings. There are those who
want to plug for the Kennedy-

Senate. Others like James
Roosevelt, (D., Calif. ) , and
Ludwig Teller, (D., N. Y.) ,

both have introduced separate
bills as substitutes for the

; Kennedy-Ervin bill. The Roose-

velt bill contains far-‘._les-s puni-
tive prdvisions‘ than ‘does the
Kennedy-Ervin bill, and does
not give the Secretary of La-
bor autocratic powers over the
-life of trade unions.

The Teller bill is more along

"the lines of the original bill

ered sympathetic to the union

"movement as is, of course, Mr.

Roosevelt.

The conservatives and reac--

tionaries on the Labor commit-
tee will without doubt vote for
any bill just to get a labor re-
form measure out on the floor.
This is where the trouble be-
gins. It is extremely doubtful
if once a labor reform bill hits
the floor of the House, no mat-
ter how “mild,” that bad
amendments can. be defeated
and prevented from changing
the character of the bill, itself.
-UNION POSITION

This is. what. our union said
in San Francisco when it unan-
imously called upon Congress
to reject any measure. Aside
from the overinflated hue and
cry for labor reform, which we
believe does not actually exist-,
our union has been convinced
from the beginning that it is
impossible to steer a mild, non-
punitive labor measure through
Congress.

The results of the Senate -

passed version support t h i s
fact. _The bill passed by the
Senate is far more restrictive
than Senator Kennedy’ appar-

fently intended. The last-mire

ute compromise away from the

/

‘ McClellan bill of rights has

not made it any better and, in
fact, possibly worse.

What happened in the Sen-
ate will be doubly dangerous
in the House. Proportionately
the liberal Democrats and pro-

labor Republicans in the
House will not be able to con-
trol debate and direction any-
where near as well as was
done in the Senate.

POLITICAL ISSUE

House liberalsiof both-

parties somehow believe that

the '58 elections brought them.

to ‘Congress for thepurpose
of writing a labor reform
measure. It seems impossible
to convince any of them that

' these labor bills are not the

answer to true union democ-
racy. Labor reform legislation
has become a political issue,

and every Congressman some- '

how feels that his reelection
in ’60 depends on what kind of
labor measure he can speak
for and‘ vote for this year._

Members -of Mine-Mill - and.

local unions who wish? to ex-
press themselves on this la-
bor. reform ’ issue still have
time to write - to their Con‘-
gressmen expressing their own
and labor’s point of view. Un-
fortunately, w h a t e V e r the

source or the cause, the mail
to Congressmen, while-not of
great value, has beenrunning
for enactment of a labor union
measure.

Members of the House of
Representatives should be ad-
dressed at the House Office
Building, Washington, D. C.
SUPREME COURT

Another important legisla-
tive issue which is coming to

- a head is contained in the bills

HR3 ‘and S3. Both these bills,
one in the House and the other
in the Senate, .-are similar and
deal with the question of curb-
ing the powers and jurisdic-
tion of the Supreme Court of
the U. S.

In effect, while these ‘bills
do not state it as such, they
have for their purpose revers-
ing practically all of the re-
cent liberal decisions of -the
Court. These bills are in the
main being pushed by South-
ern delegations in both Houses
of Congress. ’

V vAgain Mine -‘ Mill ‘members.

who wish to _'’express' their
ideas to their Congressmen-,

should do so by writing to

their‘ Representatives and ' to

Fizzles Out  

SAN MANUEL, Ariz.—
An AFL-CIO Steelworkers" \-
attempt to split the bar- , m
gaining unity of San Manu-
el Copper company workers
under Mine-Mill's jurisdiction
got the Ingemar Johannson
treatment last month.

The Steel petition to sever
some 120 smelter Workers
from the over-all production_
and maintenance bargaining
unit of 1,500 represented by
Mine-Mill was dismissed by
the National Labor Rvelations
Board in Washington, D. C. on
June 25. s 
NOT PROPER

In throwing out the Steel
petition, the NLRB found “that

the employees sought to be

severed by the Steelworl-zer.-'
do not constitute the type of
department unit traditionally
accorded separate representa-
tion."

The Steelworkers have at-
tempted to maintain a core of '
opposition in the smelter ever
since they were defeated byes
Mine-Mill in the -1956 NLRB"
election at the then unorgan-
ized San Manuel mine, mill and
smelter. Unable to broadeng
their support, the Steelwork-
ers this year filed a ca‘-rve-out
petition for the smelter alo_ne,_
just as Mine-Mill bargaining _
with San Manuel was getting -

underway. _ ‘ ~-»~+~--.'”f~.
REAL VICTORY _ _. ‘
William N. Key, president.
of San Manuel Local 937,- said -
the NLRB decision “is with-
out question a real victory for
the honest and loyal Mine -Mill
members who work in the
smelter.” He said: “No_one"
who works.’ in the smelter
should underestimate the im
portance of this NLRB de-_,
cision in relationship to the
present contract negotiations _
being carried on __between the
company and the union.” , , _ ’
Key urged all the smelter
workers “to join us in ’ our
efforts to secure for them the —
best possible contract in Wages V
and Working conditions.” J '

I Labor Unions

Steelworkers

, ' Steel union negotiations with 12 major steel
" companies continued past the June 30 contract
expiration deadline as President Eisenhower's
11th-hour intervention gained agreement be-

_ tween the parties to hold off locking horns in

an" industry-wide strike for at least two weeks. A

The two-week continuation of bargaining
without a strike was interpreted as a compro-
. mise between the industry’s demand for indefi-
nite extension without assurances of retro-
activity on ultimate settlement terms and the
, union’s counter-proposal for a limited 15-day
I extension with all improvements retroactive to
,1 July 1. The agreement topostpone the strike
deadline until midnight July 14 made no men-

9 tion of retroactivity.

Reported union demands for shorter hours,
‘higher pay, improved insurance and pension
protection, greater job‘ security, higher SUB
and other contract improvements were coun-
tered by the industry’s position against any
“net employment cost increase” and press
statements to the effect that the steel compa-
nies would “resist” any -new “inflationary ad-
justment” of labor costs.
that the eventual settlement may be more on

A the basis of so-called “non-inflationary” fringe
benefits than cash.

I It Other Negotiations

Negotiations,‘ meanwhile, were being con-
cluded and continued in other industries in-
volving millions of workers independent of
steel throughout the country. Typical increases,
' as reported by Business Week magazine in a
round-up of settlements already made, were
runningon the average between 8 cents to 11
cents an hour, with the majority going 11 cents
_,gr,_l,1,1gl1er plus fringes. These covered:

' BUILDING TRADES, involving about a mil-
lion construction craftsmen—carpenters, plumb-
‘ V ers, bricklayers, electricians and others in about
 ‘ a dozen unions received wage increases aver-
‘ E aging about 131/2 cents per hour this year, some

ymatic pay boosts next year. _

- ‘reached agreement with the Firestone Tire &
4- -‘Rubber company to end a 54-day strike. Fire-
 stone was the last of the “Big 4” in the rubber
industry to sign contracts open only on non-
,wage issues. The union won a 30 percent in-
crease in pension benefits plus substantial
gains in insurance and supplemental workmen’s
compensation plans. Still to be negotiated now
_ are economic demands covered in separate
= agreements. The union, pointing to increased
~productivity and record profits in the rubber
 industry, is going after wage increases and a
' I ‘program’ to correct wage inequities within and
I between plants.

Some Startling Figures
On Neglect of Schools

The following are eoccerpts from an article in the
United M me Workers Journal on the subject of education.-

“The National Education Association has come up
with some startling figures about American education
that ought to shame the Congress into doing something
constructive about the school problem—even if President
Eisenhower doesn’t like it. ’

“The American people put more tax money into ed-I

ucation 25 and 50 years ago than they do today. For ex-
ample, in 1902, education’s share of all taxes was about

17 percent, and in 1932 it was 25 percent. Yet today,‘

with the cost of education expected to double in the next
ten years, only 12 percent of our taxes go for the schools.

“Uncle Sam gets almost three out of every four
tax dollars. But despite this the Federal government con-
tributes only 4 percent of the cost of public schools. Lo-
cal and state governments pay 96 percent of the cost of

- public education. . . ,

 “An examination of ,«local and state tax structures, -
the NEA states, makes it very doubtful that the expected
- 100 percent increase in the cost of education over the

next decade can be handled by these governments. Lo-
cal and state debthas risen 182 percent since 1948. And
the states are hampered by competitive tax exemptions
and other tax-saving devices aimed at attracting new_in-
dustry. . ,

“Unless there is a reasonable assumption on the part

of the Federal government of a bigger share of school .

costs, American taxpayers can expect to look forward to:
“O A 50 to 90-percent increase in real estate taxes in thou-

sands of communities. ' .
“O A 2 to 4-percent increase in sales taxes in some states.
“0 An increase of 4 to 8 percent in cigarette taxes in sev-

eral states. , , ‘ ,

“In terms of wealth, the NEA says, the United States
can well afford better schools.

“National income is up 63 percent since 1948 and
average personal incomes and savings alsolhave increased
rapidly. The value of all goods and services produced in
one year (the Gross National Products) ' is now $440
billion. That’s a-70'-percent increase since‘ 1948. . -

“And since 1948, the American people were able to,
. afford $110 billion for automobiles, $151 billion for alco-

holic beverages, ‘tobacco and cosmetics, and $127 billion

for recreation.‘ ’  "
“In the same period, we spent only $78 billion-‘for

the public schools.” _, 1' ’

Economist Says, U.S.‘
Needs»Wage Boost

CHICAGO — Packinghouse
workers have been warned not
to let themselves be “brain-
washed” by the inflation the-
ories of employer groups.

One of the nation’s-' fore-
most economists, Leon Keyser-
ling, told delegates at ' the
UPWA National Wage‘ and
Contract Conference that the
American economy is falling
far behind.

He said wages, salaries, and
farm income must be ‘given a
strong stimulant if the nation’s
economy is to “stop thisebob-
bing up and down” andachieve
an adequate growth rate. '

Keyserling was chairman of
the President’s Council of
Economic Advisers under the
Truman Administration. A

In Dublin, the unification of
two battling Irish unions ap-
pears to be in the making. For
years, the Congress of Irish
Unions, comprising purely
Irish unions, and the Irish
Trade Union Congress, which
includes British unions with
Irish affiliates, have fought
each other. Finally, both sides
decided they had better get to-
gether and they formed the

Vice-President I

Larson Blasts
Data Jugglers

RODUCTIVITY~—most commonly defined as j

output per man-hour—has again become a _
major issue in bargaining. The copper com-Lg.
panies, for example, are unduly sensitive about _
our emphasis on the truly remarkable gains ,_'
they registered in the last two years. During ,
the Worst industry recession since World War. 
II, with thousands of copper workers unem- ,
ployed, they were able to boost their output 9
per man-hour by almost 20 percent; in the face I
of automatic annual wage increases, their labor_

cent. These gains, according to Bureau of La-;__i
bor Statistics figures, are much greater than 9- .
the average of all non-agricultural industries.

What this all boils down to is that out of
the tremendous savings in labor costs accruing
to the companies through rising productivity,-' 
they can easily afford to pay the wage in-*:
creases and other benefits included in this
year’s demands. And as output has been ris- .
ing . in 1959, much sharper productivity gains 
will be registered. 1 , 

That’s a pretty basic and obvious argument . i
-—one that the companies find hard to refute. "
Their -answer, in different ways, is to .keep,;.-;.«_:.
saying that it isn’t so. That sometimes takes ‘ . 
a lot of juggling of figures, but in Arizon'a,y:
where about half of all U. S. copper is pro» " '
duced, the companies don’t even have to pro-’ , 
duce the figures. That job has been Clone for 
them—in a very crude and distorted way——by‘ .
the Arizona Department of Mineral Resources; . 
This supposedly impartial, tax-supported state. —_ 
agency was set up in 1939 to aid in the pro- "

THE‘ MINE-MILL UNION-

labor-employer contracts. To-
day, negotiated SUB plans

Workers in aluminum, auto,

A flat glass, rubber, steel, sugar

refining and other industries.
To some, SUB may appear
to be just another “fringe” is-

sue, part of a “package.” But

to many more workers seri-
ously affected by recurrent re,

‘ cessions, ‘SUB represents an _
 increasingly necessary cushion
gagainst the shock of unem-

President John Clark, in his
annual report to Mine-Mill’s

than in any other plan of its

— type. The Mine-Mil1Ap1an.fur-

ther provides SUB coverage
not only for laid-off Workers,
but for those on short work-
weeks as well. ’

Our union’s proposed supple-
mentary unemployment bene-
fit plan sets as a standard 80
percent of take-home pay for
52 weeks for laid-off workers,
and 80 percent for those on
short weeks.

Under Mine-Mill's SUB pro-
gram, 5 cents per hour for
each worker would be deposit-
ed by the employer in a trust
fund until the maximum size
of the fund is reached. This

'. "maximum fund balance is set

at $500.00 per employee. Com-

“expresses most ably the broad

years.” A

and told the committee that
“industrywide campaigns in
copper, lead and zinc to step
up output per man-hour” was
a major factor accentuating
the curtailment of employment

Plan

would have the choice of either
accepting severance pay or
supplemental unemployment
benefits, whichever he thinks
is to his best advantage.

If the laid-off worker
chooses to accept the lump-
sum severance pay, he becomes
ineligible for SUB payments
during the same layoff. Any-
body who has received SUB
would still be eligible for sev-
erance pay computed on the
basis of one Week’s pay for
each year of service, less the
amount of SUB payments al-
ready received.

EASES STRAIN

As Mine-Mill sees it, sever-
ance pay is another way
which, when tied in with SUB,
would serve to ease the burden
of job losses resulting from
technological displacement of
workers by machines, long pe-
riods of business decline, merg-
ers between companies, perma-
nent or temporary shutdowns,
and other factors beyond the
control of workers involved.

The concept of severance
pay, either to discourage lay-
offs or to compensate the laid-
off worker, is nothing new. It
has been a subject of collective
bargaining for years. In vari-
ous forms, it has already been
written into contracts in such
manufacturing and non-man-
ufacturing industries as auto,
aircraft, children’s a p p a r e 1,
electrical equipment, instru-
ment manufacturing, oil, pack-
ing, rubber, steel and syn-
thetic fibres.

added that this two-year in-
crease in each industry was
“more than the total increase

in productivity achieved over.

legislative representative in-

formed the committee.
To overcome these effects,

. Clott summarized the union’s

recommendations under three
main objectives:

Protection where n e e d e (1
against excessive imports of
cheap foreign metal produced
by cheap native labor, with a
standby program of direct
price supports to domestic pro-

‘ ducers.

Positive action to look for

and develop new markets
for non-ferrous metals, sup-
ported by afederal program to
augment beginnings along
these lines which have been
made by industry, and extend-
ed federally-supported research
on new techniques of discov-
ery and exploitation of low-
grade ore. -

New and improved pro-
grams to meet the prob-
lems of cyclical unemployment
and technological displacement,
directed to the needs of the in-
dividual and the community in
which he lives.
4TH OBJECTIVE
He added that a fourth ob-
jective pursued by the union
is collective bargaining aimed
not only at better pay and
benefits, but also. greater job
security. and substantial cush-
ioning of the effects of in-
creased productivity and tech-
nological displacement. These
would include the shorter work
week, sharply increased sever-
ance pay standards and higher
supplemental unemployment
benefits than those now gener-
ally prevailing.
Specifically referring to the

Apsinall resolution, Clott said ‘

it ‘Fwould be most valuable and
useful in pointing up the many

 places at which existing fed-

eral programs fall short of
meeting the needs” outlined by
Mine-Mill. Little effect has
been achieved by the lead-zinc
import quota program during
its nine months of operation
either toward increasing do-i
mestic production of those

- metals or restoring; lost jobs,“

Lead-Z inc Jobs, Clott Testifies;

is a reappraisal of the quota
program and a standby plan of
domestic price, support along
the lines considered by Con-
gress last year, until longer
range stability can be achieved.

 He also declared that the_un- )‘

ion’s proposal for greatly ex-
panded federal and federally-
supported research into new
uses, markets and methods of
discovery and extraction of
non-ferrous metals “might well
be made the responsibility of
an industry board established
by legislation similar to that

recently passed by this House)

with reference to the coal in-
dustry.” '
AREA PROGRAMS

Clott further urged that the
“most liberal interpretation”
be given the resolution to ex-
tend depressed area program
benefits to mining areas and
to encompass a liberalization
of existing inadequate unem-
ployment benefits under state
programs. Observing t h a 1;
none of these measures gives

MURRAY-ALLOTT
Meanwhile, a bill calling for
higher import duties on lead
and zinc was introduced June‘
15 by Senator Murray in col-
laboration with Senator Allott,
which had the immediate an-
nounced support of at least
fifteen additional co-sponsor-

ing senators from western’

states.

According to Senator Allott,
the most important feature of
the ‘bill is a four-cent import
tax which would be applied
whenever the price, of zinc
falls below 131/; cents a pound
and whenever the price of lead
falls below 151/; cents a pound.
As in a. similar proposal of-
fered by Secretary of Interior
Fred A. Seaton last year, the
measure is designed to stab-
ilize domestic production of
lead at 350,000 pounds per
year and zinc at 550,000 pounds
per year, Allottsaid.

HOW IT WORKS

The ﬂat- 4-cent import tax
would be slapped on lead and
zinc in metal form. Imports
of ores and concentrates would
be taxed 2.8 cents a pound.
The increased tariffs would be
in addition to import quotas
imposed last year which such
co-sponsors of the new Mur-
ray-Allott bill as Senators
Anderson (D., . N. M.) and
Moss (D., Utah) declared were
inadequate protection for _do-
mestic 4 producers .__against

" cheaply produced foreign lead

and zinc. »

, , D. C.———Several new moves were
éiirnade in Congress last month in an effort to further bol-
 ster the lead-zinc industry.

A GROUP OF, SPEAKERS at annual local 758 convention in Chicago,
pause for lunch served for delegates. left to right are Mine-Mill
Research Director Bernard W. Stern, Shop Steward Herb Fleemore of
National lead plant, Board Member Raymond Dennis of District 3,
and David -Rothstein, local 758 attorney, who spoke on Kennedy-
Ervin bill.

The" bill also provides for
determinations by the U. S.
Tariff commisison of U. S.
market prices on the fifteenth
day of each calendar month in

order to effect the applica-
tion or non-application of the
tax for imports during‘ the fol-
lowing calendar month.
Senator Murray said: “Vital
American industries and the
workers employed in them
must be protected from the
unfair competition of foreign
labor which in some instances

is paid less than one-twelfth,
- as much as the American

miner receives.” ,
An earlier plan by Senator

Murray for a three-cent tariff

to be offered as an amendment

.. to the Excise and ‘Corporate  _
.- sistance to‘ the lead-zinc in-
' dustry. . i - 4

Extension bill due to expire
June 30 was later dropped.

Another development came
June 15 when Congressman
Aspinall introduced a new
quota bill into the House hop-
per. ,

All these moves indicate the
thorough dissatisfaction of
western lawmakers along with

_the western mining industry,

especially the small operators,
with the Administration’s
quota plan. Observers on Capi-
tol Hill are of the opinion that
regardless of what happens

Write a Letter,
Says Metcalf

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Don’t just sign a pc-
tition, write a letter, says U. S. Congressman

Lee Metcalf in an article on how to Write your . V

congressman.

“In general,” says the Montana Democrat,‘

“a petition is not the best way to communicate :
with your congressman.” Too often, he says

the purpose of a petition is negated by the-
fact that many signers don't even know What ~

JULY. 1959 

they are putting their names to or in other 

cases are not even voters.

Metcalf gave ‘as an example a petition he ..

was onceéhanded which he had been told ”w_
signed -by nearly all the teachers in his ho
constituency representing their views on a

certain bill. On checking the petition, which  _
had about 50 names on it, he found that only _ if

one ‘was .a- registered voter.

“That petition, then,” he says, “represented-
the views of a single voter who would ‘have, f 3
--done better to have written me a letter.” ’ I

  
 

"\4

Although the volume of mail on a given.‘ 

subject is important, sometimes laws have]
been passed or killed on the basis of a single

well-written letter, Metcalf says. Your letter’s 

influence depends on the point
how clear you make it.

PRESSURE --

Metcalf thinks that ready—made ‘printed: 

post cards or form letters nullify themselves._by‘-
being easily recognizable as part of pressure!’

campaigns. He suggests that “one thoughtful,”
letter carries more .2;
weight than 100 form letters or ‘printed, post

factual, ‘well-reasoned

cards.”

Letters to senators should be addressed: 
“The Hon. So-so, Senate Office Building, Wash-__ f ’
ington 25, D. C.” To representatives; ,“T_he_‘
I-Ion. So-so, House ’ Office Building, Washing-p

ton 25, D._ C.”

1

The right salutation in Writing,-to talsenator ’_
. or representative is: “Dear Sen'at,or”‘-or _“D.ear;,' 1
Congressman.” “Dear Mr; ‘So-so” is also" o_ka'y“.--

cents per pound as soon as

U. S. BRASS MILLS, through
their trade association, the
Copper and Brass Research
association, have fired the first
shot in what is almost certain
‘to be a long fight to win high-
er tariffs on brass mill prod-
ucts. The association has is-
sued a study, “The Domestic
Brass Mill Industry,” putting
forth the industry’s case for
higher tariffs. Copies may be
had by writing to the associa-
tion at 420 Lexington Avenue,
New York. The study notes
that before World War II the
United States exported 50 mil-
lion pounds of brass mill prod-

ucts, imported very little. Last '

year, imports were 154 million
pounds, exports only 13 mil-
lion pounds. - The association
' says it is ‘entitled to relief un-
der the escape clause in the

existing tariff law, but would
favor reduction of U. S. tariffs
for countries whose wages are
increased and approach U. S.

wage levels. Any attempt to, A

obtain higher tariffs will meet,
with strong opposition from
importers of brass and copper

Recent events emphasize more - than ever before:
‘the urgent duty of Congress to strengthen and expand
federal laws relating to civil rights. ' A
. The Justice department’s announced lack‘ of au-
thority to _prosecute the .1-ynchers of Mack Parker in
.P_oplarsville,, Miss.,,, points. up the need for enactment
-of the Javits anti-lynch bill into a federal law author-

when not only civil rights but life itself is denied mi-

_ The Asbury Howard case once -again, proves that.-
‘stronger Federal legislation must also be enacted to
more adequately protect the right of every American
-. citizen to register and vote regardless of the color of
his skin or the place in which he lives. This principle
is embodied in bills introduced both by Senator Javits
of New York and Senator Douglas of Illinois.

On the other hand, the same forces which stand
for the preservation of second-class citizenship for
minorities in this country are also the champions of
such bills as HR3 and S3 which would curb the U. S.
Supreme Court’s power to protect the civil rights of
the very people who need them most.

I therefore urge you as one of my representatives
in Congress to support the Javits and Douglas bills
5 mentioned above as well as any other legislation guar-
l anteeing civil rights, as opposed to such anti-Supreme
E Court bills as HR3 and S3. I am sure that your par-
: ticipation in an all—out drive in Congress to put some
5 adequate civil rights legislation on the books will earn
:.you the commendation of all decent Americans.

Sincerely yours,

"called on all local unions urging renewed pressure _on
' Congress to strengthen and expand federal laws relating

opposition to bills for curbing
the Supreme Court. The Dis-
trict 6 Civil Rights committee
issued a series of bulletins
urging all locals to act. (See
Around the Union on Page 2).

One District 6 bulletin urg-
ing support for bills strength-
ening registration and voting
rights effectively points out
that enactment of these meas-
ures would make it “impossi-
ble for an Asbury Howard
type of case to develop.”

CITE NEED

The Justice department’s

Mack Parker lynching case in
Poplarsville, Miss., on the
grounds that no existing law
gives the federal government
power to intervene is cited by
the union as pointing up -the
need for passage of the J avits
anti-lynch bill.

Support is also called for
behind two bills introduced by
Senators Javits of New York
and Douglas of Illinois for
stronger federal legislation to
enforce the right of anyone to
register and vote.

Opposition is urged against
HR3, introduced by Rep. How-
ard Smith (D., -Va.), and a
companion bill, S3, sponsored
by Senator John McClellan
(D., Ark.), both of which would
curb the power of the Supreme
Court to protect civil rights in
the states.

Granting authority to the U.
S. Attorney General to initiate
civil suits to compel school

er minority rights is one of
the provisions sponsored by

It Had to Happen——a TV Shows
With Nothing But Commercials-st.-,1

 
 

PUBLICITY-WISE TV station executive’ out on the west coast has come up   lg

novel idea—a half-hour ‘show of nothing but commercials. Richard. A. ,Mooré,il,:"

president of KTTV in Los Angeles

for the prime air time spot
of 6:30-7:00 p.m. on Satur-
day nights, starting July l1_.
Moore’s idea is to put on the
best commercials he can gath-
er together (free) from all
the big ad agencies around
the country and tie the whole
selling caboodle together with
a big-name master of ceremo-
nies delivering smart continu-
ity in between the sales pitches.
Moore told Hollywood re-
porters he got the idea from
his daughter one night when

she interrupted a conversation -

to watch a commercial on
some TV show. Obviously she
thought more of the commer-

. cial than the show, which isn’t

too surprising considering all
the money and talent the big
ad agencies throw into a pitch
that may not take more than
a minute on the air.‘ Moore

_ says his daughters preference

for the commercial over either
conversation or the show‘ it-

self got him thinking with the "

idea for the all-commercial pro-
gram being the result... 
. Philosophy en 1: er s
Moore’s designsﬂwhen‘ "he ‘of.’
fers theopinion that TV view-

ers really do not -object to com-’'

mercials’, and he’s out tolprove

it. Our own conclusion is that ‘

Mr. Moore has more _practical
ends in mind. If the program
attracts the audience he’s bet-
ting on, well make our own
bet that his all-commercial pro-
gram will soon start running
commercials in between the
commercials—for a nice price.

On the other hand, a beer
brewer in New York has a
view on commercials quite op-
posite to that of the station
owner on the other coast. He
bet on the idea last month that
the fewer commercials hein-
terrupted a show with to push
his product, the better his
prospective ‘customers would
like it. The product inciden-
tally, not to leave the commer-
cial out altogether, is Schaefer
beer. .

Schaefer beer sponsored the
showing of the old movie com-
edy classic, “It Happened One
Night,” starring Clark Gable
and Claudette Colbert. The
beer brewer deliberately adver-
tised the fact in advance that,
for once, an old movie show-
ing (this one ran 105 minutes)
would be interrupted by only
one (not three or four back-to-
back) commercial just four
times during the entire ‘pro-

7i n.t o‘

, is so hepon the idea that he’s slotting the  

gram. That made it one inter-
ruption about every 25 min-
utes instead of every 10 or 12
which is the usual harassment
on the late, late-late or late-
late-late movies which most of
us are inclined to lose sleep

over.
‘I: * it

Personally, a public service
such as this would switch this
column to Schaefer beer if it
were available in Denver. The

fact -is that it must have_

boosted Schaefer sales in New
York, where the’ soft—sell was
tried, because the rating fig-
ures’ showed the old film.-‘drew
the 11th biggest audience of
all TV shows in New York
during’ that whole week, com-
ing in right behind
smoke.” ,

We hope the idea catches on.

But‘ then, maybe Mr. Moore. in

Los Angeles has something in
the implied thought that ‘it's
probably not so much the fre-
quency of commercials that an-
noys most people as the qual-
ity of the pitch - and perhaps

‘ thefskill or lack of skill with
‘ which itis introduced into the

program’s continuity.

In most cases the action is
stopped cold, and the first
thing you know you’re in the
middle‘ of “Anacin” with a

headache and upset stomachg

which, for our money, is the
worst commercial on the chan-
nels, bar none. The same
thing goes for the toothpaste.
commercial with the kid and
the punchline “look. Ma, no
cavities.” One of these. -days
that brat is going to have no
TEETH. For the most part, a
good many of these advertis-
ing pitches (particularly those
aimed at sales of patent medi-
cines, detergents and squirts
for b. 0.) have a singular qual-
ity in commonnpoor taste.
*, * *

There oughta be a law, and
some people think there actu-
ally is, but there is none
against this type of injury to
people’s sensibilities on .TV.
True, there is a Code Review
committee of the National As-
sociation of Broadcasting
whose seal of good practice is
supposed to regulate the qual-
ity of commercials or at least
the degree to which fake
claims can be stretched. It has
no real power or authority to
do so, however, except an-
nouncing, withdrawal of its

Interest in Effect

WASHINGTON —— Compa-
nies in the business of mak-
ing money by lending money
to ex-GI’s who Want to buy
homes got another shot in the
arm June 30 when President
Eisenhower signed legislation
boosting interest rates on vet-
terans’ mortgages and provid-
ing for $100 million in direct
loans for veterans’ housing.

The new law permits lend-
ers to charge 51/; percent in-
terest on mortgages guaran-

_teed by the Veterans adminis-

tration. The previous ‘ceiling
for the GI interest rates was
4 and 5% percent, well below
FHA. and conventional home
loan rates.

Labor's  

Active in Canada

TORONTO, Ont.——The enemies of organized labor in
Canada, like their counterparts in the United States, are

‘ actively engaged in legislative campaigns to destroy trade

unionism throughout the country.
They have launched their attacks in the provincial

legislatures of British Col-
umbia, Ontario, Quebec,
Manitoba, Alberta and New-
foundland. Industrially and
population-wise these six prov-
inces are the leading ones of
the 10 provinces and two ter-
ritories that make up Canada.
The laws proposed and passed,
in many instances go far be-
yond the scope of the state
“right-to-work” laws in -the

. U.S. The la t t e r, themselves,

are meant to undercut unions.

The most calculated and vio-
lent legislative attack upon or-
ganized labor is being made in
British Columbia.

The Canadian -Labour Con-
gress reported that the B. C.
legislature, dominated by the
Social Credit Party govern-

-ment, prohibits picketing ex-

cept at the employer's place of
business and by members of

. the striking union only.

BANS SUPPORT

This law prohibits support
from the In emb e rs of other
unions, including refusal to
handle “hot” goods. It pro-
hibits the publication of infor-
mation elsewhere about the
unfair labor practices of a
struck employer.

Many bad features are in-

- cluded in the changes recom-

mended to the Ontario legis-
lature by a Select Committee
on Labour Relations. It in-
cludes a ban of strikes in “es-
sential services.” Since‘ the
recommendation does not de-
fine what is meant by “essen-
tial services,” it is believed
that the strike ban could be

clamped on anyitype of work. .,

In Quebec, its prime minis-
t_er_,, Maurice -Duplessis, is the
foremost exponent of fighting
the labor movement by legis-
lation and reg u-lation. This
leader of the Conservative
Party in Quebec, has consist-
ently denied the labor move-
ment any of its basic rights by
using provincial police in his
efforts to crush trade unions.

In Manitoba, “the hand of
the law is threatening to reach
and pilfer some of the rights
of the labor movement,” the
Canadian L ab our Congress
stated. ‘

The CLC asserted that if the
proposals would become law
the government body would
have the power to tell a union

where to organize and where

not to organize.

dustrial Relations yh a n d e d

SUDBURY, Ont. — Interna-

tional President John ‘Clark

left International Executive
board meeting in Denver on
June 23 to fly here at the invi-
tation of Don Gillis, president,
and the executive board of L0-
cal 598, 

While here, Clark met with
President Nels Thibault, Vice-
President William Kennedy,
and Secretary-Treasurer Wil-
liam Longridge of the Cana-
dian Mine-Mill union.

The Mine-Mill leader spoke
at two large meetings of Local
598. He expressed keen inter-
est in some of the locai’s prob-
lems and said “their settlement
will insure unity to build fur-
ther gains for the entire mem-
bership.” Clark also attended
a shop stewards’ meeting here,
and listened with interest to
their problems and current
grievances. He said he was
deeply impressed by, the prog-

ress which Local 598 siewarils

are making in handling vital

union activities. He and Thi-
bault addressed the steward
body. In addition, he addressed
the Ladies Auxiliary in two
different me’eti,ng's.’ ‘ "

While in Sudbury, the inter-

national union president met
with 1 President King of the
Trail, B.C.,, local; President
Thompson of the Kimberley
local, and President Kopinak
of the Port Colborne, Ont., lo-
cal. The three presidents were
in Sudbury on a special com-
mittee assignment.

In commenting on his Cana-
dian trip, President Clark said:

“As usual, I was pleased to
be able to meet many of the
old timers of our union there.
Most of them are charter mem-
bers whose devotion to Mine-
Mill has been the spur for
great gains made by Local
598. .

day in the near future we can
plan ajoint convention in Sud-

Bargaining

vened by the Executive board.
The committee is made up of
members of the International
Executive-. board and rank-and-
file representatives of such
bargaining councils as Ana-
conda, Kennecott, Phelps
Dodge, American Smelting and
Refining, Magma-San Manuel,
Brass, and Northwest.

LITTLE PROGRESS

After a full day of reports
on the lack of progress in ne-
gotiations around the country,
the Wage Policy committee
sent out the call for a national

strike vote, along with this

message:

“Bargaining since early May
with major nonferrous metal
companies has thus far failed
to yield- any appreciable prog-
ress toward settlement of the
union’s proposals.

“To date, no single com-

pany has made any offer
worthy of serious considera-
tion.
‘ “Therefore, this N ational
Wage Policy committee, with
representation from all major
bargaining groups in the in-
dustry, authorizes the taking
of a national strike vote on
June 30.”

KENNECOTT

Typical of negotiations in
the last week of June were
those which were still taking
place in Salt Lake City be-
tween the Mine-Mill National
Kennecott council and a com-
pany committee representative
of all western operations in
Utah, Nevada, New Mexico,
and Arizona. -

In negotiations led by Board

,Member Al Skinner of District

2, Kennecott co-ordinator, and
Western Vice-President Orville
Larson, the union told com-

.. pany representatives on June

26 that the negotiations had
‘become “mere conversation
sessions.” In negotiations with

, the company since May 1 on

local issues and since June 1
on western division issues,
Mine-Mill’s committee remind-

, ed Kennecott officials that

they had not made a single

counter-proposal to the union‘

on any single local issue or on

' a package settlement.

Skinner told the“ company
that the union was requesting
intervention by the Federal
Conciliation service. The serv-
ice was notified later in the
day.

Without even making a pro-
posal of their own, company
negotiators were spending all
of their time trying to con-
vince the union to cut its de-
mands.

OTHER COMPANIES 9

Similar fruitless discussions
were experienced by union
committees in nearly -all nego-
tiations around the country.
Bargaining sessions were in
progress in San Francisco be-

' tween the union and AS&R on

national issues, while local
unions. were meeting with
plant officials on strictly local
and‘ non-economic issues. Ex-
tension of contracts was
agreed upon, subject to 48
hours’ notice.

The same pattern was be-
ing established in Phelps
Dodge negotiations in El Paso
and in Douglas, Ariz., where

-Arizona locals were bargain-
' ing jointly with the company.

A meeting was scheduled for

- June 30.

Meetings were held in Butte
July 25, 26, and 27 with the
Anaconda’ company for its
Montana operations and re-

1 sulted in no change in the com-

pany-’s position. The company

 offered to renew -the agree-

for employees who are off
sick. Negotiations were sched-
uled to resume July 1, with the
agreement being extended un-
til that time.

“OFFERS”

On June 29, the American
Brass c o In p a n y , Anaconda
subsidiary, made its initial of-
fer to the union’s joint com-
mittee. This provided for a
general wage increase of 2 per
cent, a slight increase in holi-
day pay, an increase in surgi-
cal insurance‘ from $250 to
$300, and a one-year agree-
ment. The offer was rejected
by the committee. An exten-
sion of the agreement has been
agreed upon subject to cancel-
lation upon 24 hours’ notice, a
pattern that seemed develop-
ing in most companies.

Another brass c omp any,
Plume and Atwood in Thomas-
ton, Conn., offered an increase
of 31/; per cent, plus fringes.
Negotiations were continuing.

At American Zinc in East St.
Louis, Ill., the company has
offered a two-year agreement
providing for a 3-cent wage in-
crease now and a wage reopen-
er allowing for a wage “in-
crease or decrease” after 11
months. An alternative “pro-
posal” from the company was
for a one-year agreement with
a 2-cent increase and an “up
and down” escalator clause.
Negotiations are continuing.

In the Coeur d’Alene Mining
District of Idaho there have
been no wage offers and there
is every indication that sever-
al of the larger companies are
endeavoring to provoke . a
strike. _

In Carteret, N. J ., negotia-
tions were taking place, large-
ly around the pension issue.

A score of locals were ne-
gotiating with other compa-.
nies around the country. ,-

As of July 2, there was still,
a lot of negotiating left to be
done.

two slips meaning a three-day
layoff and three ‘slips a dis-
charge. These actions fol-
lowed almost a year in which
local management had not set-
tled a single grievance of any
consequence, and during which
crews were slashed and jobs
eliminated wholesale.
COMPANY TACTICS

During the lockout the com-
pany’. consistently refused to
discuss anything until after
the men returned to work.
Desperate company efforts to
get men in the plant included
letters to more than 200 pre-
viously laid-off employees still
holding seniority rights, some
with as much as eight years,
ordering them back to work.
When the overwhelming ma-
jority of these refused to take
someone else’s job, they were
notified that their names were
being dropped.

Report-to-work letters were
also sent to every member in-
volved in the lockout. The
company had their foremen
telephone members’ homes,
-telling them they couldn’t win
under the injunction. Even an
AFL-CIO engineers and oilers

scavenger outfit sent letters to

members saying that if they
signed cards their troubles

would be over. All of this failed '

to dent the membership’s solid-

arity and determination to win. ‘

Added strength was given

Tacoma management again
tried to get the men in the
plant with the bait that they
could come back Decoration
day and receive two-and-one-
half-times pay, knowing that
the men would be trapped once
they were in the plant. When
this failed the company final-
ly agreed to sit down and talk.
It offered to reinstate the
seven local officers; but main-
tained that the disciplinary
slips still stood, that the "men
on the call-back list who were
dropped .would remain that
way, and that the law suit and
injunction still stayed in ef-

‘ feet. This was rejected unan-

imously by the membership at
a meeting on June 7.

Settlement terms were final-
lly reached.by the union and
company at bargaining ses-
sions June 14 and 15, with the
following result: the hundreds
of disciplinary slips were
