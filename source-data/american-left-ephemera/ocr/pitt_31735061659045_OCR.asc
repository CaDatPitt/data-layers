DRAFT PROGRAM OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY

 

V-........p-v--—..

 

T they challenge only his fascist “methods” while agreeing with his
anti-Communist “objectives.” This stands everything on its head. V

McCarthy’s objective is fascism; his method anti-Communism.

The danger which confronts this country is that of McCarthy-
ism, of fascism. It can be defeated only when progressive Ameri-
cans, whether they like or dislike Communism, begin to realize
that Communism is not the issue in this country today or in the
near future. The false issue of Communism has been cunningly
injected and kept alive in order to distract the people from the real
issue which confronts them, the imminent black-out of all consti-
tutional liberties. and the brutal imposition of an American type
of fascism. This was the method of Hitlerism. It is the method
of McCarthyism.

McCarthyism is trying to win complete political power through
the present Republican Administration which is increasingly em-
bracing the methods of McCarthyism. '

Thus it aims to impose fascism on the country, to take it over
through a program of unbridled intimidation and demagogy. It
aims to transform the present increasingly reactionary Republican
Administration into an outright fascist government. This is the
objective of McCarthyism.

Thus the danger of McCarthyism, of American fascism, is real,

9: grave and growing. To defeat this menace, to safeguard the demo-
;‘ cratic rights and precious liberties of the American people is the
‘ first task of the hour.

V. The Communist Program Against Depression——
For Jobs, ‘Peace, Democracy

The American Communists propose for our nation an ﬁ*y,e_-‘ppint
grograﬁrnj of H lfare, Democrajtic__‘_EMreedoms, and Peaceful
oexistenge.

1. Raise the Purchasing Power of the People and Curb the
Power and Proﬁts of the Trusts!

0 To combat depression we urge the defeat of all wage-cut

10

_-._.nn:aann_n_4n:aAqA_n.A|_n_a-A

 

I-ﬁ_A.4|-n_|_|.rA Mich

 

attempts and a militant struggle by labor to raise wages on all
levels, to shorten the work-week without a reduction in weekly

-earnings, and to curb speed-up. We advocate the lowering of

consumer prices, an end to rent gouging, and a shift of the tax
burdens to the rich.

0 An anti-depression program requires government protec-
tion of home owners, small farmers and small business from mortgage
foreclosures and bankruptcy. It requires a government guarantee
of 100 per cent price .parity and crop insurance for small and
middle-sized farmers, and Government loans and credit at low
interest rates to small business and needy farmers.

0 To end the economic backwardness of the South and to raise
the purchasing power of the people of that region, the Government
should institute agricultural reform measures aimed at helping the
sharecroppers and tenant farmers, Negro and white, to become
independent producers who own the soil they till. The wage dif-
ferentials between North and South and between men and women
workers should be ended and equal pay for equal work guaranteed

to all, regardless of race, nationality, religion, sex, age or political
belief.

2. Spend for Human Welfare, not Warfare; for Homes and
Schools, not Bombs and Battleships!

0 The Government has the responsibility to guarantee jobs
and living standards. The giant plants which have been erected
for the production of planes, tanks, atom and hydrogen bombs for
war, need not be shut down. They can be converted to peace-
time uses. For example, the giant war-time aircraft plants can be
converted into huge factories for producing pre-fab homes on an
assembly line basis. A Government—supported program of this
kind can produce a minimum of 1,500,000 additional modern pri-
vate dwellings a year. This would help wipe out the rat-infested
ﬁre-traps in which so many of our people live and die. The Gov-
ernment which built these giant war producing plants with the
people’s money must guarantee their continued operation, but for
peaceful purposes. If private industry cannot or will not do so,
the Government can and must!

11

0 We propose a Substantial increase in unemployment and old-
age beneﬁts; special measures to keep our youth from becoming
a jobless generation and to guarantee all our youth free and equal
educational opportunities; a federal health program; and a large-
scale federal program of flood control, conservation, power dam
development and rural road building.

3. End the “Cold War” and Promote Friendship and Trade!

There can be no hope for a lasting peace and world disarma-
ment without accepting the principle of peaceful coexistence be-
tween the capitalist U.S.A. and the socialist Soviet Union. This
is necessary whether one agrees or disagrees with socialism, whether
one likes or dislikes the’ Soviet Union. _

Peaceful coexistence does not preclude, but includes, a peace-
ful competition between the different social systems. It does ex-
clude, however, a settlement by force of arms of the dispute as to
which social system is superior.

To ease world tension and to restore the United Nations as an
instrument for lasting peace we propose:

0 A return to President Roosevelt’s policy of big power negotia-
tion and agreement. This must include People’s China, the estab-
lished and effective government of the great Chinese nation.

0 An end to the arms race and to the policy of encircling the
globe with U.S. military bases. What ‘is needed is a world ban
on the use of all atomic weapons and an agreement for a drastic
reduction in all types of armaments. We oppose the militarization
of our youth and Universal Military Training.

0 The widest promotion of peaceful world trade. Our coun-
try, in its own interests, must take advantage of the immense mar-
kets for American goods available in the Soviet Union, China and
Eastern Europe. These markets can provide millions of jobs for
American workmen for years to come. We favor the extension of
credit to bolster world trade and to help overcome the hunger
and under-development of the colonial lands. The colonial and
semi-colonial countries need machine tools, agricultural implements
and farm products. But they rightfully reject fraudulent “Point 4”

12

 

vvar--'—3'—I—:*iI:I

programs which aim at robbing them of their natural resources and
keeping them as backward hinterlands.

0 An end to the policy of remilitarizing Germany and ]apan.
The lessons of World War II prove that a re—militarized Germany
is a threat to world peace and to the security of the U.S. We stand
for a united, democratic and peaceful Germany.

0 No intervention in the internal affairs of other nations and
the recognition of the right of all nations to govern themselves. This
means an end to the Dulles policy of instigating civil wars in other
countries and of aiding the oppressors of the colonial peoples of
Indo-China and of all Africa and Asia. This means hands off Guate-
mala. We favor the right of full and unconditional independence
for Puerto Rico; full equality and democratic rights for Hawaii;
and complete political and economic freedom for the Philippines.
The right of all nations to restrict and control all foreigninvestrnents
on their territories should be recognized and respected. We favor
a policy of the good neighbor to the Latin American lands and to
all nations. - ‘

4. Defend and Strengthen Democracy!

We call for the defense of the Constitution and its Bill of Rights,
for an end to the “dictatorship of fear,” and for a turning back of
the evil tide of McCarthyism. This requires the defense of the
constitutional rights of all, including the Communists. To deny the
Communists their constitutional rights is the ﬁrst step to denying
these rights for all Americans. This is the lesson of Nazi Germany.
It is the lesson of the witch-hunt in this country. Labor leaders and
_former New Dealers are learning that theycannot obtain immunit
from the witch-hunters by crawling on their knees and Red-baiting.
In the words of Benjamin Franklin, “They that can give up essential
liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty
nor safety.”

0 We urge an end to the witch-hunting, the abolition of all
Congressional witch-hunt committees, and a halt to the Gestapo-like
political activities of the FBI. Political arrests and deportations
must cease. Amnesty must be granted to Eugene Dennis, Benjamin

13

 

]. Davis, Gus Hall, and the other Communist leaders and victims
of McCarthyism. The attempts to outlaw the Communist Party and
to deprive Communists of their citizenship rights must be defeated.
The Smith and McCarran Acts should be repealed.

0 Labor’s right to organize and strike must be protected and all
anti,-labor legislation such as the infamous Taft-Hartley Act must
be repealed and defeated. Strike-breaking by court injunctions or
government decrees should be stopped.

0 Academic freedom and freedom of inquiry should be restored
for America’s youth. Young people should be given the right to
vote at 18. The time has come to end bookburning and know-
nothingism, to put a stop to the cult of violence in our movies, TV
and literature, and to promote culture for peace and democracy.

5. Win Equal Rights for the Negro People!

Democracy is only as strong as its weakest link. All progressive
forces should give full support to the valiant ﬁght of the Negro
people for their rights. This is necessary because the ﬁght for the
liberation of the Negro nation, for the rights of all the Negro people
is an integral part of the ﬁght for democracy, for peace, for the
rights and living standards of labor and all the people.

If there were no oppression of the Negro people in our land,
there would be no wage differentials between the North and the
South. Thus, Southern white workers, together with their Negro
brothers, would receive higher wages, while Northern labor could
put an end to run-away shops and Southern cheap labor competition.
In this way wage levels could be raised for the whole country.

If there were no oppression of the Negro people there would be
no poll-tax congressmen. Without poll-tax congressmen it would
have been far more difficult for the reactionaries to pass the Taft-
Hartley, the Smith and the McCarran Acts.

If there were no poll-tax Dixiecrat congressmen in Washington
there also would be a better chance to get improved social security
legislation, price and rent controls, more federal aid to education, a
federal housing program, greater aid for the unemployed and the
aged, and far more equitable tax laws.

14

"._t.('D_ C!'.’7‘.:$"d '.3"< '-'5

 

Thus, the American people are paying. for the shame of Jim
Crow. This price is added to the humiliation and oppression heaped
upon the Negro people. The Negro people should have their free-
dom because that is right. They should have it also because all
America has a stake in it, stands to gain by it. Democracy, like
peace, is indivisible.

0 We urge prompt federal action to wipe out every form of
discrimination in employment and job opportunities for Negro
workers, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Indian and ]ewish workers, and
for women and young people. This can help end the practice of
hiring Negro workers last and ﬁring them ﬁrst, of denying them
opportunities for advancement as skilled workers, or of employment
as white-collar workers or professionals. A federal F EPC, strictly
enforced, can help prevent the corporations from pitting one group

of workers against another and from reducing wage standards for
all workers.

0 We further urge federal civil rights legislation to outlaw the
poll-tax, lynching, segregation and Jim Crow. Equal educational
opportunities and the right to full representation should be guar-
anteed the Negro people, North and South.

9.’? # it

We call upon wage workers, working farmers, the Negro people,
small business and professional people, upon the women and the
youth, to join hands in a common ﬁght against the ravages of eco-
nomic depression, against the menace of McCarthyism—for jobs,
peace, and freedom. We urge support for the anti-depression de-
mands of the A.F. of L. and C.I.O., for the farm demands of the
National Farmers’ Union, for the democratic demands of the Na-
tional Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for
every proposal, every action, which can help save our people from
threatening economic ruin, fascism, and war.

V. What Has ‘To Be Done-—The Road Ahead

This Program ‘for ]obs, Peace and Democracy is a program for
America. It can be realized. It corresponds to the needs of the

15

people under circumstances in which their liberties and living
standards are in imminent danger of complete destruction and in
which they are not prepared to accept socialism as the way out.

The program outlined here cannot do away with the planlessness
and recurring economic crises of capitalism. Only socialism can do
that. This Program can help, however, to delay the outbreak of an
-economic depression and to cushion its blow upon the people. It
can save America from the clear and present danger of McCarthy-
ism-can block war and fascism, save U.S. living standards, and
maintain democracy.

No one group in America can achieve these things. The unity
of all democratic and peace-loving forces is needed—unity on one
issue, or a score of issues—unity irrespective of ideological and po-
litical differences on other questions and on longer range goals.

If»£19.‘£‘.99£€‘ﬁ._9.. 11.1?_1'.tX_i5 to be We1.§.§§,.a..§1I!diiI.L.t1I1n.e, ..a..rnajor_rc;spQ.I1-
sibility rests upon the o~rga-r~1'1"2“:‘é‘(l'labor movement. It must become
the ‘propelling force of a popular coalition movement which unites
labor, the working farmers, the Negro people, small and middle-
sized business and those groups of capital opposed to the McCarthy
program of fascism and war. Such an alliance must also include the
nation’s professionals and intellectuals; its women, youth and na-
tionality groups. This alliance, if it is to become fully eifective, must
include the Left and the Communists who have a vital and indis-
pensable contribution to make.

Labor does not play its full role today.. It does not give a clear
and ﬁrm lead because it is unclear and divided itself, because its
own ranks are infected with Red-baiting and the “cold war,” be-
cause its top leaders still play the part of errand boys to big business
politicians.

The responsibility for this rests on the oflicial leaderships of the
major trade union centers, the A.F. of L., C.I.O., Railroad Brother-

hoods and Mine Workers. By their support of Wall Street’s foreign.

policy and the anti—Communist drive they have misled the workers.

The labor movement must change its course if it is to save itself
and help save the nation. It should practice the slogan, “an injury
to one is an injury to all.” This should govern the relationship of
one section of labor to another, and of the labor movement to the

16

l
I

 

farmers, the Negro people, the professionals, intellectuals, and small
business people. This can be achieved only by an alert and active
rank and ﬁle.

There are signs of a new awakening in our land. Larger sections
of the people are beginning to speak up for peace and for a program
of peace-time jobs. They are becoming alarmed over the menace of
McCarthyism. Their opposition to the Eisenhower Administration
is growing. The bitter fruits of the war drive are bound further to
dispel many illusions. The people are compelled to enter more ener-
getically and consciously into the struggle to defend their living
standards, their democratic liberties, and their peace. The collision
between the people and the foreign and domestic policies of Mc-
Carthyism must grow in volume and intensity.

Important sections of the labor movement are becoming in-
creasingly conscious of the life-and-death need for labor unity. Some
of these are also beginning to point in the direction of increased
independent political action, are beginning to think in terms of
forming a great political alliance under labor’s leadership.

e immediate objective in 1954 must be to prevent the Eisen-
hower Administration and Congress from taking the country further
down the road of McCarthyism. Defeating McCarthyism requires
the turning of the present Administration out of political power,
first by changing the composition of Congress in 1954 and then by
electing a new Administration in 1956. This requires a new political
majority so strong that it not only changes Administrations but im-
poses on a new Congress and a new Administration a new course in
domestic and foreign affairs.

The answer to our present national plight is not a switch-back to
another Truman-type Administration. The Truman Administration,
by departing from Roosevelt’s foreign and domestic policies, only

’ paved the way for the Republicans to grab political power and for

McCarthyism to ride roughshod over the nation. What is needed
is a new Administration which starts to build again where the New
Deal left off. .

Only the prospect of such a new Administration can inspire and
rally the many millions of independent voters in the ranks of labor,
the Negro people, the farmers, and the city middle classes, who

17

_‘ __ M,“ ,__w,,.........4

when acting together, constitute a new political majority.

To unite a new political majority for 1954 and 1956 requires rec-
ognition that the two-party system remains the form through which
the overwhelming majority of the American people now express
themselves in politics. Except in special local and state situations,
there is no immediate prospect that decisively large masses will
break away from the existing two-party structure. This is particu-
larly true since the struggle between the McCarthy and anti-Mc-
Carthy forces is likely to be very close. Under these circumstances
the decisive sections of organized labor, without which a mass third
party is impossible, will ﬁrst attempt to ﬁght out the issues within
the ranks of the Democratic Party.

The key to both the crucial 1954 and 1956 elections lies in the
ability of organized labor to come forward as a distinct political
force even within the framework of the present two-party system.
Labor must come forward with its own clear-cut progressive pro-
gram for the nation, its own ties and alliances with other indepen-
dent electoral forces, and its own highly organized and efﬁcient
election machinery. Its objective must be to help bring about a
regrouping and realignment within the Democratic Party nationally
and within the Republican Party in local areas.

The liberal and independent voters cannot create a new majority
and defeat McCarthyism by giving the political bosses a blank
check, for McCarthyism exists in both major parties and must be
fought in each. They must, therefore, exert every effort to make
their independent weight felt in the determination of program and
the selection of candidates, including, where necessary, the running
of independent candidates. Organizations such as _the Progressive
Party and the American Labor Party, by pursuing correct unity

 

policies and running candidates where necessary, can help clarify .

the issues and greatly strengthen the common struggle against
McCarthyism.
The 1954 elections are crucial in determining the path America

will take. McCarthy already has thrown down the gauntlet to the

American people. What is needed is unity of every decent, honest
force of our people, of all independent-minded voters, whether
Democrats, Republicans, or Progressives. Such unity must set itself

18

.—1. -- ..

the objective of electing an anti-McCarthy Congress by defeating
every McCarthy-McCarran-Dixiecrat type of candidate, every pro-
fascist and rabid war monger. It is also necessary to bring into the
halls of Congress a bloc of articulate and uncompromising oppo-
nents of McCarthyism, of courageous spokesmen for a further relax-
ation of world tension and for the defense of the people from the
ravages of economic depression. Labor and Negro representation
in Congress must be strengthened by electing a larger number of
trade union and Negro candidates. This will facilitate the election
of a new Administration in 1956.

_ Only in the course of sustained struggle along these lines will
the perspective of a mass third party of the people, led by labor and
its allies, materialize. Labor will ﬁnd that the many important
battles it must wage within the Democratic Party, decisive as they
may be in checking the immediate danger of McCarthyism, will not
transform that Party into a farmer-labor party. Labor must set its
sights in the direction of a great party of its own, a party without
Wall Street ﬁnanciers, corrupt underworld racketeers, or Southern
Dixiecrats—in short, a true united front party of labor and the com-
mon man. V

As the American people succeed in electing a new Administra-
tion and blocking the immediate menace of fascism and war, a new
stage of the struggle will begin to unfold. It is then that the per-
spective of subsequently electing a _n_eyvW__typ_eM_g9_v_e~rnment, a

farmer-labor government, will begin to arise in our country. Such  l

‘a people’s governméritfbased on a farmer-labor party, will represent
the militant advance of the great majority. It will be a government

, in which the working class plays a leading role, serving the interests

of the common people, and directed at curbing the power of the
trusts. ‘

VII. Communist Aims and Perspectives

The Communist Party, basing itself on the scientiﬁc principles
of Marxism-Leninism, believes in socialism as the ultimate solution
for the problems of our nation. Modern industrial production under
capitalism is a vast social process, but it is operated for private

A NOTE TO THE READER

This Draft Program is offered by the Communist Party as a
statement of its proposals for meeting the critical problems now
facing the American people.

In line with its own long-standing democratic practice and pol-
icy, the Communist Party offers this Program as a draft, to be
weighed in the light of the nation’s most burning needs, to be sub-
jected to frank and constructive criticism—not only by Communist
Party members but, as the Draft Program urges, by,.“all groups con-
cerned with saving our nation from fascism and war.” The Party
warmly welcomes the participation in this discussion, which will
continue through June, of “all Americans, no matter what our past
relations or present differences,” and pledges publicly to acknowl-
edge all serious and constructive criticism. It urges both members
and sympathizers, and all progressive and democratic forces, to
study the Program carefully and to re-examine their activities and
habits of work and thought in the light of the Program’s objectives.

Letters, articles, proposals, criticisms, and all forms of opinion
bearing on the Draft Program, should be mailed to the National
Office, C.P.U.S.A., 268 Seventh Avenue, New York 1, N. Y. They
will receive serious attention and consideration. In its ﬁnal form,
as it will be hammered out by the best collective thought, and hav-
ing the full approval of the Party, the Communist Program will be
re-published to serve the people’s continuing ﬁght for jobs, peace
and democracy.

enrichment and not for the public good. It is this contradiction that
socialism would resolve. Socialism alone would utilize to the fullest
the immense scientiﬁc" and technical know-how of the American
people, including atomic energy. It would forever end the scourge
of economic crisis, unemployment, racial discrimination, fascism
and war. It would build a land of peaceand plenty, of knowledge
and culture, of freedom and opportunity for all.

At the same time, the Communist Party emphasizes that the
issue_ at the present time is not communism. The choice before our
people today is peace, security, democracy versus the grip which
the monopolists have on the country and their plans of fascism
and war.

But while the issue today is not communism, the true nature of
the Communist Party and the role which it plays in American life
is very much an issue. The American people must know the truth
about this issue lest the monstrous deception now practiced on them
lead to the loss of the democracy and freedom they prize so dearly.

What is the truth about the Communist Party?

The Communist Party advocates a peaceful path to socialism in
the U.S. It brands as a lie the charge that it advocates the use of
force and violence in the pursuit of any of its immediate or long
range goals. It declares that socialism will come into existence in
the United States only when the majority of the American people
decide to establish it. The Communist Party aflirms its deep and
abiding faith in the American people and their ultimate decision
to establish socialism. The needs of our nation cannot be served by
any sect or conspiracy. For no progress, whether of a minimum or
of a more far-reaching nature, can come other than through the will
and action of a majority of the American people.

The Communist Party has no blueprint for the path to socialism
in the U.S. The American people will move along the path to
socialism as inevitably as other peoples and nations have done be-
cause ultimately there is no other solution to their problems. But
they will do so in a form and manner which will be determined by
the history, the traditions and the speciﬁc needs of- the American
people. No social system can be imported from abroad. Nor do we
propose to do so.

20

 

 

Basing itself on these fundamental propositions, the path to
socialism in the United States which is advocated by the Commu-
nist Party envisions: the unity of the majority of the people to block
the present imminent threat of McCarthyism, thereby upholding
and defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; and then, the
forward march of that majority toward a strengthening of democ-
racy and the election of a new type of government, a farmer-labor,
anti-monopoly government. The election of such an Administration
and Congress would then open up the possibility for a peaceful
advance of the American people to socialism.

The Communist Party of the United States has its roots deep in
the history and struggles of the American people and its labor move-
ment. It is the inheritor and continuer of the best in American
democratic, radical and labor thought and traditions. Its devotion
to the true national interests of the American people is the source
of its deep and abiding patriotism. That patriotism has been sealed
in the blood of hundreds of members of the Communist Party who
have died in defense of our country and our people.

American Communists believe in the defense of their country, ‘

and the people and territory of their country. We deny that the
Soviet Union or any country led and ruled by working people
threatens our country, or could threaten our country. We resolutely
oppose “police actions,” wars of aggression, or wars of intervention
in the affairs of peoples ﬁghting to shape their own way of life as
they see ﬁt.

The false and despicable charge that Communists are “agents
of a foreign power,” or “spies,” emanates from the monopolists who
want, thereby, to cover up their own betrayal of the true national
interests of the American people. It is the monopolists who are the
agents of a foreign power-—the power of the international cartels
and trusts which they dominate and to whose greedy manipulations
they subordinate and betray the interests of our country. Not what
is good for our country, but what is good for General Motors deter-
mines the loyalty of the monopolists. A

The Communist Party declares that it seeks no conﬂict with any
church or any American’s religious beliefs. On the contrary, we
stretch out our hand in the fellowship of common struggle for our

21

  

mutual goal of peace, democracy and security to all regardless of
religious belief. We stand on the fundamental principle of the Con-
stitution which guarantees religious freedom by separating church
and state, and, in the same spirit, we oppose the intervention of any
church -in political affairs.

The Communist Party considers the emergence of a powerful
trade union movement during these past two decades as the most
important and positive development in our national life. We are
proud to have helped build it and to be a part of it. As a working
class political party we strive to inﬂuence the policies of the labor
movement and deem it our right and duty to speak out against pol-
icies which we believe are harmful to labor and the nation. But
we deny any intent to dominate or control the trade union move-
ment and recognize and respect its organizational autonomy and
political independence.

We proclaim our fraternity with all peoples who have pioneered
the new frontiers of human history toward socialism, with all peo-
ples struggling to achieve their independence and national develop-
ment. We aflirm the good will and solidarity of our people with all
those who stand for peace and progress. We seek to realize Abra-
ham Lincoln’s saying: “The strongest bond of human sympathy,
outside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working
people, of all nations, and tongues and kindreds.”

We are ready to work with all Americans, no matter what our
past relations or present differences may be, to block war and fas-
cism, to save U.S. living standards, to restore free exchange of ideas
and debate on the great issues facing the nation. We propose a
coming together of all progressive and democratic forces to consult
with each other and to make such consultation and working to-
gether a habit. The grave problems of our nation cannot be solved
otherwise. I

We call upon all progressive and democratic forces to re-ap-
praise their policies and activities in light of the nation’s crisis. The
American Communists pledge to do the same.

We urge mutual and friendly criticism among all groups con-

 

cerned with saving our nation from fascism and war. We invite .

criticism of ourselves and of this Draft Program, and are prepared

22

 

to publicly acknowledge all criticism that is just.

We urge upon all our members and sympathizers a most careful
study of this Program and a re-examination of their daily activities,
habits of work and thought, to bring them in line with it.

In full conﬁdence that the objectives of this Draft Program can
be realized, We call upon all members and friends, upon. all anti-
fascists, to spare no_ effort to realize this program of jobs, peace and
democracy for America.

THE AMERICAN WAY

To Jobs ° Peace ° Democracy

I. Introduction

Our country and its people rapidly are approaching a crisis.

-The storm clouds of a major economic depression are nearly
upon us.

—Our nation’s foreign policy has led us into a blind alley.

--Our traditional liberties are vanishing, being replaced with
the ugly menace of McCarthyism. _

The American "people face the danger that everything they be-
lieve in, everything they want this great land to be, is being turned
into its opposite.

At a time of great national fear and anxiety the Communist
Party submits this Program as an appeal to reason, an appeal to
the common sense of our fellow Americans. The crisis of our nation
cannot be resolved by any one group alone. Therefore, we offer
this Program for the consideration of the workingclass and all
Americans who are concerned with the welfare of our country.

We are_convinced that only the widest unity of the American
people can avert the disaster of economic ruin, fascism and war.
Only the most open-minded and deep-going democratic debate
can produce such unity.’

Toward that end we submit this Program.

II. The Looming Depression——The Danger of Hard Times

Ours is a great land. The American people are proud of its in-

ventive genius, its technical know-how, its tremendous industrial ‘

machine and vast natural resources. One would, therefore, expect
to ﬁnd among the people a sense of conﬁdence in the future. But
such is not the case. Whether in the huge shops of Detroit or the
vast farmlands of Nebraska, there is a gnawing fear of impending
economlc rum.

There is indeed cause for alarm. Signs of an approaching eco-
nomic crisis are increasing. Production is falling. Unemployment

is growing. Weekly earnings are declining as over-time pay dis-'

appears. The farrners are once again being caught in the desperate
squeeze between high production costs and falling farm income.
Small business bankruptcies are multiplying. Warehouses are
loaded with $80 billions of unsold goods, while the American people
still owe the unprecedented amount of $27 billions on installment
purchases.

Human needs could easily absorb all that American can pro-
duce. But human needs and fabulous proﬁts are opposite things.
The corporations reap huge proﬁts from the people’s skill and
labor. Corporation proﬁts rose from $636 billions in 1939 to $45
billions in 1953. In contrast, the Government’s Bureau of Labor
Statistics admits that more than one-half of all American families
cannot afford to buy the minimum requirements for decent, health-
ful living.

Since World War II, big business and the Government con-
sidered renewed arms production as the panacea to prevent de-
pression and to keep proﬁts high. Military expenditures have in-
creased more than twenty times since 1939.

But this is no answer. The increased expenditures for arma-
ments and war are paid for by increased taxes and higher prices
taken from the pockets of the people. Taxes today are more than
twelve times higher than in 1939. The cost of living has more than
doubled. Thus the real wages and buying power of the workers
and farmers have been cut. “Cold war” politics also led to an em-
bargo on trade with one-third of the wor_ld——the Soviet Union, China
and Eastern Europe. This reduced the ability to sell American
goods abroad. Finally, the over-expansion" of the armament indus-

. tries makes ever larger appropriations necessary to keep them

o1n .

g Tghe arms economy is proving to be not the road to prosperity,
but to economic ruin.

Big Business has no remedy for the chronic threat of economic
crisis. It knows only one way to keep its industrial plants run-
ning and its lush proﬁts ﬂowing-by bigger war preparations, lead-

ing to ever more barbaric wars. The “cure” it offers is worse *‘

than the disease.
The arms economy is strengthening the big monopolies at the

e ense of th_e_n_at' n—particularly of labor, the working farmers
‘E5 rnﬁ%1'

a srnallwand e-sized business. A few giant corporations
have a stranglehold on the nation’s industries. This hold is even
further strengthened by the Administration’s “give-away” program
to the monopolists.

There is an ever greater subordination of government to big
business. The Eisenhower Administration is an administration of,
by and for big business. Corporate wealth—General Motors, U.S.
Steel, Standard Oil and du Pont—America’s biggest, richest and
greediest trusts, run the U.S. Government just as surely as they run
their own corporations, and for the same end of ever more exorbi-
tant proﬁts.

The monopolists are planning to turn the approaching economic
crisis to their own advantage. They are preparing to put the
American people through the wringer; They will throw millions
of workers on the streets and attempt to cut the wages of those em-
ployed. They strive to reduce their own taxes while keeping them
high for the lower income brackets. They want to crush and wipe
out little business, to force millions of small farmers off the land,
to push the small owner to the wall and to foreclose on his home
and property. They want to intensify the exploitation and op-
pression of the Negro people and to put more of our youth into
uniforms. In short, they want to place the burden of hard times
on the backs of the “little people.” This is what they mean when
they speak of “limited recession” or “economic readjustment.”

Above all, the monopolists will seek to use the approaching
economic crisis to accelerate their drive for more and more arma-
ments and for ultimate war.

But the American people are no longer going to accept hard
times as just “hard luck,” or as the process by which individuals
are made “rugged” under capitalism. They refuse to blame them-
selves or fate for mass unemployment. They expect the economic
system and the Government to guarantee them jobs at a living
wage as workers, and a living income as farmers.

This very dread of economic depression is cleverly utilized
by Wall Street to sell its “defense” program to the country as one
to prevent depression and to safeguard peace. However, big busi-
ness now fears the indignation and wrath of the people when they
learn that they have been hoodwinked.

III. The Crisis in U.S. Foreign Policy—-
The Danger of War

This nation’s foreign policy since World War II can only lead
to disaster. It is’ a policy without a future.

This policy has failed because it represents neither the national
interests of the American people nor the cherished aspirations of
all mankind for peace, national freedom and higher living stand-
ards.

The Wall Street trusts and cartels have set their course on com-
pletely dominating the nations, the markets and the resources of
the entire globe. This they aim to do by a combination of bribery,
cajolery, intimidation and ultimate war. This is the real cause for
our Government’s reactionary foreign policy.

This explains the building of air bases and military installations

around the world. It explains the aggressive NATO war alliance A

and our headlong rush to rearm Germany and ]apan. It explains
our intervention in Korea, and our military and ﬁnancial aid to
the oppressors and butchers of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and
Latin America.

Our country, which won its national freedom in a great revolu-
tionary war against despotic colonialism, now strives to prevent
other peoples from having their 1776. Our economic royalists
shout “Communism,” but what they are after is the tungsten of
Korea, the rubber of Indo-China, the oil of Iran and Venezuela,
the diamonds and gold of South Africa, the sugar of Cuba and
Puerto Rico, the bauxite of Guiana, the fruit of Guatemala, the
nitrate and copper of Chile, the tin of Bolivia, and the immense
super-proﬁts derived from cheap colonial labor everywhere.’

No longer are the democratic forces of the world our allies and

friends. Our new found “friends” are the Nazis of Germany, the
militarists of ]apan, the Franco fascist regime in Spain, the Chiang
Kai-shek clique in Formosa, the white-supremacists of South Africa,
and the military dictators of Latin America. »

To call U.S. foreign policy one of “strengthening democracy
and the free world,” is to make a hollow and cynical mockery of
words.

Powerful social forces are at work in the world that will not
accept Wall Street dictation or domination. One third of mankind
is emancipated from imperialist oppression and capitalist exploita-
tion and has taken the path of socialism. The rise of the Soviet
Union, its tremendous industrial and cultural advance, the victory
of the Chinese people and the peoples of Eastern Europe, prove
that socialism is here to stay and is indestructible.

At the same time, the colonial and dependent countries refuse
to continue to live in conditions of national oppression. They re-
fuse to continue to let their resources be exploited for the beneﬁt
of imperialism.

The more economically advanced capitalist countries are like-
wise impelled to assert their national independence, to break away
from the grip of Wall Street. They desperately need foreign mar-
kets to keep their industries running. U.S. capitalism cannot pro-
vide these. Instead, Wall Street seeks to monopolize all capitalist
world markets for itself. Thus, these other capitalist nations are
compelled to enter into ever ﬁercer competition with U.S. capital
and to seek proﬁtable trade with the Soviet Union and the other
socialist countries. '

The present crisis in U.S. foreign policy arises from the refusal
of the ruling class to accept this new relationship of forces in the
world. The “cold war” is the attempt to turn back the clock of
history, to prepare a war for world domination behind the myth
of Soviet aggression. Wall Street has done all in its power to build
a world-wide coalition against the Soviet Union. But this coalition
is now falling apart. Wall Street has no real allies. Even its present
so-called allies cannot deliver on their commitments. The people
of the world, including the American people, do not intend to
goose-step to the martial music of Wall Street. They are tired of

7

   

constant war tension, unbearable armament burdens, the threat of
atomic devastation, and of both “hot” and “cold” wars. They want
eace.
P These defeats suffered by Wall Street’s foreign policy, especially
the ending of the Korean war, have led to a certain easing of world
tension. This opens the possibility of putting an end to the “cold
war” altogether. But to realize this possibility the American people
must be on guard against those ruling circles who pay lip-service
to the need for a negotiation of differences but in reality place
obstacles in the path of such peaceful settlement. The American
people must demand an end to all world tension and the “cold war”!

IV. The Menace of McCarthyism-—Tl1e Growing
Danger of Fascism

Hand in hand with the drive toward war has been the attack
on our democratic heritage. This grave danger to our democratic
liberties is becoming understood by more and more Americans.

McCarthyism is on a rampage. It is trying to brow-beat into
submission every independent point of view, every thinking person.
It burns books and destroys art and culture. It aims to smash
the labor movement, to further enslave the Negro people, to stir
up racism and anti-Semitism, to gag the young generation, and to
wipe out all vestiges of liberty. McCarthyism seeks to turn Amer-
ica into a land of yes-men, a land where patriotism is replaced with

1,1,‘. jingoism, independent thought with conformity, courage . with

servility.

The victims of the witch-hunt are many. They are in the first
place Communists, but they also include men and women of varied
political views. They are leaders of labor and the Negro people.
They are the foreign born. They are men and women of science,
gifted writers and artists, prominent churchmen and educators.

The gradual whittling away of our basic democratic liberties
is not some post-war madness which will pass of itself. It repre-
sents an ominous and monstrous trend toward a full-ﬂedged police-
state and fascism. The McCarthys and McCarrans are not merely

8

 

 

publicity-seeking demagogues. They are the conscious creatures
of powerful ultra-reactionary monopoly interests. McCarthyism is
the ugly face of American Hitlerism, American fascism.

The attack upon democratic liberties these past years has been
an integral part of the preparations of Wall Street for its war for
world domination. It was designed to divide the country, to break
up the popular majority that stood for President Roosevelt’s policy
of peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union.

The attack on the Communists, the witch-hunt, the attack on
the whole New Deal and Fair Deal has nothing to do with the

-:‘....“‘...:.‘...—z

nation’s security. It is an expression of ruling class fear of the re- .

emergence of the progressive majority in which the American Com-
munists were a part and a stimulating force.

To take this country throu h a depression and into a war,
the ruling class needs fascist co ormity, apathy, terrorized and sub-
missive Americans. This is the meaning of McCarthyism.

Why has McCarthyism made such alarming inroads in Ameri-
can life? The last convention of the United Auto Workers, C.I.O.,
correctly noted that “under the guise of protecting us from the
Communists,” the worst vﬂlainy has become possible. McCar-
thy’s shady ﬁnancial deals, Nixon’s slush funds, the big business
looting of the public treasury in lush defense contracts and in tax,
property, land and oil steals, have all been gotten away with un-
der the guise of ﬁghting Communism. Anti-Communism has be-
come the biggest and best paying racket in the country. The Ameri-
can people are paying for this. They may pay for it even more
dearly—with their very lives and liberties.

It is the Big Lie that the Soviet Union menaces this nation that
has made possible the inroads of McCarthyism. McCarthyism has
been able to utilize this lie to frighten and intimidate the country.
The responsibility for this rests largely on those who helped cul-
tivate and perpetuate this Big Lie. This includes the Truman
Administration and the A. F. of L. and C.I.O. top leadership.
By their propagation of the hoax of the Communist menace, they
have helped transform McCarthyism from an insigniﬁcant con-
temptible worm into a dangerous and venomous rattlesnake.

Accepting the Big Lie, many of McCarthy’s opponents say that
