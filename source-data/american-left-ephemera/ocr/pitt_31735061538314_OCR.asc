What Every Working Woman Wants

TOMMY was a little fellow of six, just beginning school this

year, and his stockings just wouldn’t stay up smoothly over
his spindly thin le-gs. .

Mary Davis looked at "him across the table and wondered what
was going to happen next. She and the child lived in a little
wooden frame two-family house in a small mill town, but she
hadn’t -been able to work in the mill for two months. A heavy
cold had developed into pneumonia and she was still strangely
weak from" the ‘effects. Neighbors upstairs had kept the child
while she was in bed. And now she was better, but not yet able
to work.

Rent was long overdue. A warninginotice had reached her—.

The town was not exactly a mill village but the mill owner owned
the workers’ houses just the same. And there was a rule that
any family more than a month behind in the weekly tent was
evicted. Today was the last date, they had said, when the rent
must be paid. But she had no money. Neighbors had helped
all they could. She could not ask them for any-thing; they were
hard up themselves. '

While she sat, trying to think, two people were talking about
her in another house in the town. The foreman in charge of
the workers’ houses came home to lunch with his wife and said
it was really too bad he would have -to go that afternoon and
evict Mary Davis from her house. But orders were orders. Mr.
Green, the mill owner, never allowed anyone to stay ina house
when the rent was not paid. _

“You leave it to me,” said his wife, who had worked in the
mill herself as a girl before marrying the foreman. “I have
sympathy for that woman.” '

The foreman’s wife dres
out. She went directly to t
admitted into the inner r
sive cigar. He Had just had a _go elt amiable.

“Wha»t can I do for you, Mrs. Nelson?” he smiled benevo-
lently.

“Oh, Mr. Green. You are so kind, I am sure you will help
in this needy case. There is a poor woman in the town who sup-
ports herself and her child ’-by her work. But she hasn’t been
able to work for many weeks and the rent is overdue. She -will
be evicted today unless we can get the money for her rent.”

“How much is it?” he asked with his best charity smile.

“It’s all of $24, sir. Four dollars a week for six weeks,'not
paid.”

“I can meet that amount, I think. I had money brought from
the bank this morning. You are sure it is a worthy case?” Tak-
ing out his bill-folder he counted over the clean bills from the
bank and found he had cash enough to cover twice the amount
she asked for. .

“Oh, quite, sir. She is usually a very hard-working woman.
Just ill now, you see.”

“Yes, I see. Here-is $24. Very glad I can help you in your
work for the poor. I hope it is really a worthy case.”

The foreman’s wife took the money and hurried out to find
her husband. She gave him the $24 in the fresh, clean bills
to take to Mary Davis in payment of -the rent.

Then the foreman went to see Mary Davis and told her he had
a contribution from a rich man to help her pay the rent. I-Ie
handed her -the money and she handed it back to him in pay-
ment of the rent. And the foreman took the money and carried
it back to the oiiice of the mill owner in payment of the rent
that was due. And the mill owner in due course received back
-the $24 as the rent -that was due from the woman who lived in

the house that he owned. ’

But the mill owner did not let his left hand of charity interfere
with what his right hand of business was doing.

Mary Davis’ rent, was paid. But she and Tommy were still
hungry and there was still no food in the house.

=1< * * * *

This is a true story, though the names are changed. But it is
true not only .of this one worker and this one mill owner. It is
true of the whole proﬁt system in the United States that leaves
the worker and the child at the mercy of a little charity when
unemployment or illness or the death of a wage-earner or old
age or any other hazard takes away the worker’s small weekly
wage.

But Mary Davis and others like her are not going to sit and
watch Tommy and the other children like him starve to death.
Revolt is beginning. Spontaneous strikes of industrial women
workers against wage-cuts and speed-up have been followed by
rent strikes and bread strikes of working class tenants and
housewives. Jobless women have taken part in demonstrations
and hunger marches.

Negro women in St. Louis and Chicago factories, Mexican
ﬁeld workers in Colorado, farmers’ wives in Iowa, miners’ wives
picketing with their men, workers in anti-imperialist demonstra-
tions, jobless workers in demonstrations of the unemployed—all
have taken an active, spirited, heroic part in these struggles for
increased wages, increased relief, or for other demands. Often
the struggles have been successful. ‘_

What they have done, you can do. With this unquenchable
spirit of struggle we move forward now to ask the government
and the employers not merely for a little more relief, but to
demand a whole system of adequate insurance for unemployment,
industrial accident, and sickness, old age, and maternity. What
such social insurance means is the subject of this pamphlet. It
represents what every working woman in the United States
wants and needs.

A Mo’thers' Bill of Rights .

From the time the working class girl is first married, she has
the problem of having children whether she wants them or not,
whether she can afford them or not, because she has no way of
getting the information that is known to practically every woman
of the middle and upper classes—on how to space and limit the
number of children. To the parents who can afﬁord a private
physician the information on -birth control is given as a matter
of course. .

But according to the present «federal law, passed in 1873, espe-
cially Section Zll of the Criminal Code, the giving of informa-
tion to prevent conception is classed with obscenity, pornography,
and indecency. A violator of the law is su-bject to imprisonment
or a fine, or both imprisonment and ﬁne. It is illegal to send
information or supplies through the mails or by express or to
import any article designed to prevent conception. '

As a result of this cruel class legislation, working class women
have no way of knowing the good from the bad methods of birth
control. They often resort to poisonous medicines or worthless

- contraceptives. A bootleg business has developed. Manufac-

turers are making proﬁts in putting on the market, under cover
of such fancy names as "Feminine Hygiene,” "Birconjel,” and
others, devices which may or may not be good. The worker has
no way of knowing.

In desperate efforts to avoid having another baby when the
working-class family cannot feed those already born, a mother
will go to extreme measures. One mother swallowed two table-
spoonsful of gun-powder in the hope of producing an abortion.

In discussing this question of birth control we must broaden it
and outline what we may call a Mothers’ Bill of Rights, to in-
clude the establishment of free birth-control clinics where workers
may secure scientiﬁc information; free day nurseries for the
children of working mothers; and maternity insurance as pro-
vided in the Workers" Unemployment and Social Insurance Bill,
introduced in the 74th Congress in Washington, January 3, 1935,
and numbered HR. 2827.

 

Why Maternity Beneﬁts
This Workers’ B-ill (HR. 2827) calls for “the immediate

establishment of other systems of social insurance for the purpose
of providing compensation for all workers and farmers who are
unable to work because of sickness, old-age, maternity, industrial
injury or any other disability. Compensation for disability be-
cause of maternity shall be paid to women during -the period of
eight weeks previous to and eight weeks following child-birth.”

Just what would this provision for maternity mean to you?

' You are a young girl just married; you and your husband have

decided you would like to have a child, but as things are now
you can’t afford to take the time away from your job. Besides,
there would be hospital expenses, and the care of the baby
afterward. ‘

But ifthis Workers’ Bill were passed by Congress, that situa-
tion would be changed. You would receive every week, for
eight weeks before child-birth and for eight weeks afterward, an
amount of money equal to the average local wages for your
kind of work, in no case less than $10 a week.

Maternity insurance should also include free medical care in
the hospital. Not only working mothers but the wives of men
workers and farmers should be entitled to all the benefits of
this maternity insurance.

Many of the European capitalist countries have at least some
form of sickness insurance which includes something in the way
of maternity beneﬁts.

But-—-in all these capitdlist countries workers themselves must
pay for this insurance with their own contributions, supplemented
by employers’ contributions and usually -by the State.

According to the Wagner-Lewis Bill, proposed in Congress in
January, 1935, with the endorsement of President Roosevelt and
his advisers, there would still be no maternity insurance in the
United States. In place of maternity insurance, the Roosevelt
administration suggests spending only $4,000,000 a year for all
48 states "for the health of mothers and children, especially in

‘ 6

    

J»

rural areas”. This paltry sum would give not even $1 apiece
for the mothers and children who are in the greatest need of help.
It is not in any sense maternity insurance.

If You Lived in Hue U.S.S.R.-

If you lived in the Workers’ State, the Soviet Union, and
decided t-o have a child, you would go to the maternity clinic,
and the physician there would ‘tell you how much work you can
do while the baby is coming. For this medical care and for all
medical treatment always while you are ill, from whatever cause,
you pay nothing at all. It is a system of socialized medicine,
provided by the Workers’ State and by industry, free of charge
to the workers, whether factory, ofﬁce or professional workers.
The doctors and nurses are on salary, paid by the State and by
industry. ‘

The physician gives you a card which entitles you to rest, even
while you hold the job, at any time you feel the need. Your
factory, or other place of work, receives word that your work
must be lightened, but there is no decrease in wages. If you
need a vacation before the regular time—eight weeks before the
child is to be .born—you receive it at full pay.

If you are engaged in mental rather than physical work, your
insurance period begins six, instead of eight, weeks before con-
ﬁnement and continues until six, instead of eight, weeks after-
ward. Your insurance payment is equal to your full wages be-
ginning with the ﬁrst day of the 12 or 16 weeks. You can buy
extra milk and special food without extra cost. For the baby’s
clothing you receive an allowance well before the date of con-

' ﬁnement.

In the clinic, and later in the hospital, you receive -the best of
care, free of charge. During the first six months after the ba-by
is born, you can have extra money for his milk, whenever needed.
On returning to the factory your job is waiting for you and the
factory has a nursery where. you may leave the child, under ex-
pert care, in case there is no one a-t home to care for him. You

    

will have regular nursing periods when you may leave your work
for a half hour to go and nurse the child. Your insurance in-
cludes the care of the child in the factory nursery for three
years.

While you have this aid in making your -boy or girl a healthy
child, you will receive full information on spacing and limiting
the number of your children. This advice is provided, free of
charge, of course, at the birth-control clinic. The best and most
up-to-date methods of birth control are known and made avail-
able in the Workers’ Republic. '

“When sick, our wages go on just as if working,’
worker from the Soviet Union.

All these beneﬁts are provided free of charge in the State
that is owned and governed by workers.

’ writes a

Here and Now

But in the United States of America, richest of all capitalist
coun-tries, maternity beneﬁts are as yet practically unknown.
There is no sickness insurance to provide for the worker who
cannot work through no fault of his own or her own. Mothers’
Aid Laws do not usually include expectant mothers in the help
they provide, little as it is. Although many States have these
so-called mothers’ aid laws, supposedly to help widows with de-
pendent children, it is very hard to get this aid. Even after the
worker qualiﬁes in every way by being a widow, -by being a citizen
and by being so destitute that her children ‘would otherwise be
taken away from the home for institutional care—even then the
county is often unable, due to “lack of funds” ,~to pay the small
monthly allowance called for "by the law. (See Women Who
Work, pages 173-174.) Nor would the meager provisions of
the Wagner-Lewis Bill change this situation.

Ten thousand mothers die needlessly each year in child-birth,
according‘ to the U.S. Children’s Bureau. Of the 16,000 who
die annually in childbirth, over 60 per cent might be saved
through adequate maternity care. ’ Many of these mothers’ lives
3

    

 

could be saved if proper medical -treatment were provided and if
maternity beneﬁts‘ ena-bled them to have rest and care before
conﬁnement. ‘ e

We have plenty of work to do ahead in making known to
other working women what the maternity provisions of the
Workers’ Bill would mean to them in their daily lives. Ask
them if they know what maternity insurance means and, if
they don’t, then explain it.

With health insurance as provided in the Workers’ Bill, a
worker would receive free medical care while ill, and a compen-
sation equal to average local wages. In other words, during the
worker’s illness, wages would go on just as if he or she were
working. ‘

Growing Old

“When you go looking for work, they all want kids,” said one
woman only 29 years old.

A silk worker in Paterson, N. _I., still under 40, told me that
the one thing she dreaded most in the world was old age, when
she was sure she would be forced to go to the Old Folks’ Home
on the hill. _

"Every day I look out of the mill window,” she said, “And
I think to myself, we can never save enough so as I won’t have
to go there. Sure’s anything, I’ll land in that terrible Old
Folk’s Home.”

Not less than one-third of all old people in the United States
reach old age without a competence. Even in the years of “pros-
perity” two and a half million persons, aged 65 and over, were
dependent upon public or private charity. At least half and
probably more than half of these old persons are women. Such
old-age pension schemes as have been introduced in certain states
are entirely inadequate to meet their needs, as we have shown
in Women Who Work. The so-called old-age -pension plan of
-the Wagrter-Lewis Bill, as proposed by the Roosevelt adminis-
tration, would give only $1 a day or less to those who are 65

‘ 9

 

  

or over, who are citizens, have resided five years in the State,
and are entirely destitute.

The old-age provisions of the Workers’ Bill would give each
old person the equivalent of average local wages or at least a
minimum of $10 a week. But we must restore to the bill an
important provision taken out by Representative Lundeen when
he introduced it in Congress-—that this provision for old-age should
be available when the worker or farmer is “55 years old or. older”.
Otherwise there are many long years -of destitution, between the
time the worker is considered “too old” for a job’ and the time
when he or she becomes eligible for an old-age pension.

Negro Women Need Insurance

Every word that is said about the situation of white women
workers is doubly true for Negro women of the working class.
White women’s wages are lower than men’s but Negro women’s
wages are lowest of all. They are discriminated against in every
imaginable way and the discrimination is by no means conﬁned to
the Southern States. Negroes everywhere have been forced
to submit to the white ruling class. Jim-crowism runs through
every phase of capitalist society in every part of the United
States. . ‘

Capitalism depends for its very existence on a lar_ge body of
surplus labor power ready to be bought at the lowest possible
price. It is therefore in the interests of employers to keep these
Negro women workers in a condition of so-called “inferiority”,
ready -to underbid white workers, just as it is in the interests
of employers to keep women to ‘underbid men in the labor
market. One group of workers is played off against another
grou-p—foreign-born against American, Negro against white,
women against men. So long as the -boss can point to a body

7 of workers ready -to work for still lower wages, he has the whip-

    

hand over his employees. A
A Negro wom-an from Detroit, Michigan, speaking at the

women’s sub-session of the great National Congress for Unem-
10

ployment and Social Insurance in Washington, January, 1935,
spoke in vigorous terms of the need for a wider front and more
united action between Negro and white women in working for
the Bill, H.R. 2827. She said: . .

‘'Don’t push the Negro women workers away from you. Draw
them closer. They are a little afraid. of you. But ‘when they
understand that . you want them they will work with you for
social insurance. Help them and get them to help you in the
ﬁght for the Workers’ Bill.”

Many Negro women were among the 400 women delegates
at this social insurance congress. They and many thousands
of others whom they represent are actively engaged in the strug-
gle for maternity beneﬁts, for old-age pensions, for sickness and
unemployment insurance.

Owl" of a Job

You are jobless. You have watched the newspaper ads for
jobs; you have watched the factory gates for that old sign: “Girls
Wanted.” .

But it has not appeared. You have worn out your shoes walk-
ing the city streets. You have registered at all agencies that
are accepting any registrations. But there are no jobs.

You have lived on “relief”. You have seen the gas and electric
light turned off by the rich company that is making increased
proﬁts in this sixth year of the crisis and depression.

You have gone hungry and tried to give more of what food
there was to the children or to the man of the house. Perhaps
you have seen your child die of what they call malnutrition.

And you are one of more than 3,000,000 jobless women in
the United States. It is estimated that of the more than 16,-
000,000 unemployed workers in the country, about 22 per cent
are women; in other words about 3,500,000 girls and women want

‘ jobs and cannot ﬁnd any.

A million more families have been added to relief -rolls since
Roosevelt tookoiﬁce in the spring of 1933. Now there are more
11

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  

than 20,000,000 persons, or nearly one-sixth of /the whole popu-
lati-on, on relief.

And 7,400,000 of these persons are children under 16. More
than 6,000,000 are women.

What is the “relief”? In one state it averages $1.91 a week
for a whole family. The highest average in any state "is only
$9.85 a week for a whole family.

What such “relief” really amounts to is seen even in the few
ﬁgures that are available. on deaths from starvation. In the
world’s richest city, New York, at least 29 persons died of hunger
in 1933. (New York Times, June 1, 1934.) Undoubtedly even
in these few hospitals there were many other cases of death from
starvation that were not called by that name. There were also
in these New York City hospitals 110 deaths from “malnutri-
tion”, and most of these malnutrition cases were children.

But President Roosevelt goes on smiling. His administration
plans have raised the prices of things workers and farmers must
buy. Food is 27 per cent higher now than when he took oflice
in March, 1933. Prices will go still higher during this coming
year.

For more than 16,000,000 ‘persons who are now jobless in the
United States the Roosevelt “security” program, as outlined in
the Wagner-Lewis Bill, would provide absolutely nothing at all.
Even the future jobless would be beneﬁted only for a maximum
of 15 to 16 weeks, and the compensation for these few weeks
would be. only half the average wage. No "compensation” at
all would be available for any unemployed person for about
two years. ~

The whole purpose of the New Deal has been to increase the
proﬁts of corporations. The number of million-dollar incomes
more than doubled between 1932 and 1933, but incomes of less
than $5,000 were sharply cut. One multi-millionaire (probably
John D: Rockefeller,  drew more than $5,000,000 in income
in one year (1933), a sum equal to the total relief income of’
about 20,000 unemployed families, or about 80,000 persons.’

12

For war preparations the Roosevelt administration has already
spent more than a billi-on dollars with further huge sums appro-
priated for war purposes during the coming year. These war
funds should be made available for unemployment and social
insurance. ‘ - '

Yes, there is plenty of money in the United States to meet
the provisions of the Workers’ Bill. Taxing inheritances, gifts,
and individual and corporation incomes of $5,000 a year and
over would provide enough -to supplement the funds from the
Treasury of the United States to be appropriated for this purpose.

How ’ro Work for H.R. 2827,

Speaking on this bill at the National Congress for Unemploy-
ment and Social Insurance in Washington, January 6, 1935,
Earl Browder, Secretary of the Communist Party, explained how
it has already been adopted -by workers all over the United States
as their bill:

“It is true that the Communist Party worked out this Bill,
after long consultation with large numbers of workers, popular-
ized it, and brought millions of Americans to see that this Bill is
the only proposal for unemployment insurance that meets their
life needs. . . .

“W/e Communists have no desire to keep this Bill as ‘our own’
private property.  . _ ’

“Of course the Bill is yours; it -belongs to the entire working
class, to all the toiling masses of America.”

It is an impressive list of organizations that have already en-
dorsed this Bill. The list includes over 2,000 locals of the
American Federation of Labor, six State federations of labor, at
least 29 central labor unions and a considerable number of city
councils, county and municipal’ bodies. At the Congress in
Washington, in January, 1935, a strong united front was forged
in support of the Bill.‘ Over 400 women delegates were present
from various organizations.

You can secure copies of the Bill by writing to the National
13

 

 

Joint Action Committee, 799 Broadway, New York City. Get
a few of your friends together and discuss the Bill with them,
explaining the need, not only among those you know personally,
but among millions of others, as outlined in this pamphlet, for
a system of unemployment and social insurance. _

If you -belong to any organization of any kind, bring up’ the
Workers’ Bill for discussion, if possible at a special meeting on
that one subject, and press for its endorsement. To secure en-
dorsements by‘ women workers go where the workers are-—
whether they are in the Young Women’s Christian Association,
the Young Women’s Hebrew Association, the churches, or any
other organization of whatsoever kind.

Work for the Bill especially in those industries where there
are more women than men, as in the needle trades, and in indus-
tries where there are very large numbers of women, as in textiles.
If you are in the woman’s auxiliary of a trade union, press for
the bill within that organization. When the bill is endorsed,
send full information as to the name of the organization, the
address, date and action taken, to the National Joint Action
Committee.

But don’ t stop with endorsements and letters. Get into the
struggle for the Workers’ Bill. Attend the meetings and demon-
strations of the unemployed. Take part in local activities of
the workers in stopping evictions, putting the furniture back in
a worker’s home, going with a committee to the relief agency
to secure more relief. Join the march to the capital in the state-
where you live. i ‘

These struggles for more relief and for other demands have
already been successful on a local scale. Some day they will be
successful on a national scale.

The struggle that begins with the Workers’ Bill for Social and
Unemployment Insurance will end at. last in a workers’ and
farmers’ government that will abolish forever all -unemployment,
misery and hunger.

THE WORKERS BILL FOR UNEMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL
INSURANCE ' .

H. R. 2827
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
January 3, 1935

Mr. Lundeen introduced the following bill; which was referred to
the Committee on Labor and ordered to be printed

A BILL

To provide for the establishment of unemployment, old age, and
social insurance, and for other ‘purposes. _

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act

shall be known by the title "The Workers’ Unemployment, Old

Age, and Social Insurance Act.”

Sec. 2. The Secretary of Labor is hereby authorized and di-
rected to provide for the immediate establishment of a system of
unemployment insurance for the purpose of providing compensa-
tion for all workers and farmers above eighteen years of age, un-
employed through no fault of their own. Such compensation shall
be equal to average local wages, but it shall in no case be less
than $10 per week, plus $3 for each dependent. Workers willing
and able to do full-time work but unable to .secure full-time em-
ployment shall be entitled to receive the difference between their
earnings and the average local wages for full-time employment. The
minimum compensation guaranteed by this Act shall be increased
in conformity with rises in the cost of living. Such unemployment
insurance shall be administered and controlled, and the minimum
compensation shall be adjusted by workers and farmers under rules
and regulations which shall be prescribed by the Secretary of Labor
in conformity with the purposes and provisions of this Act through
unemployment insurance commissions directly elected by members
of workers’ and farmers’ organizations.

Sec. 3. The Secretary of Labor is hereby further authorized
and directed to provide for the immediate establishment of other
forms of social insurance for the purpose of providing compensa-
tion for all workers and farmers who are unable to work because
of sickness, old age, maternity, industrial injury, or any other dis-

15

-3
ability. Such compensation shall be the same as provided by sec-
tion 2 of this Act for unemployment insurance and shall be ad-
ministered in like manner. Compensation for disability because of
maternity shall be paid to women during the period of eight weeks
previous and eight weeks following child-birth.

Sec. 4. All moneys necessary to pay compensation guaranteed
by this Act and the cost of establishing and maintaining the ad-
ministration of this Act shall be paid by the Government of the
United States. All such moneys are hereby appropriated out of
all funds in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise
appropriated. Further taxation necessary to provide funds for the
purposes of this Act shall be levied on inheritances, gifts, and in-
dividual and corporation incomes of $5,000 a year and over. The
beneﬁts of this Act shall be extended to workers, whether they
be industrial, agricultural, domestic, oflice, or professional workers,
and to farmers, Without discrimination because of age, sex, color,
religious or political opinion or aﬂiliation. No worker or farmer
shall be disqualified from receiving the compensation guaranteed
by this Act because of past participation in strikes, or refusal to
work in place of strikers, or at less than average local,or'trade-
union wages, or under unsafe or unsanitary conditions, or where
hours are longer than the prevailing union standards of a par-
ticular trade or locality, or at an unreasonable distance from home.

 

NOTE: The Workers Bill (HR. 2827) differs from the original draft as
sponsored and endorsed by numerous trade union, unemployed, professional and
other organizations associated with the National Joint Action Committee, in the
following respects:

It sets the age of eligibility at 18 instead of 16 years.

(2) It fails to specify that old-age beneﬁts commence at the age of 55 years.

(3) It does not speciﬁcally state there shall be no discrimination because of

citizenship.

(4) It does not speciﬁcally declare that present as well as past participation

in strikes shall not serve to disqualify.

Aside from these very important omissions which we will endeavor to correct
by amendments, the Bill. as above presented, embodies all the essential principles
of genuine social insurance.
