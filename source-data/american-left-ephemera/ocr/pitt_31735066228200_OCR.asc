ABOUT THE

AMERICAN

YOUTH

ments and rejecting all fanciful theories about a conflict
between the generations, is created entirely by youth. This
is an important consideration in view of the fake nostrums
that are being peddled by potential Fascists under the name
of “Social Justice,” "Share Our Wealth,” and the like.
The programs of these organizations parade as solutions to
many of the problems facing youth, but they are actually
dangerous to youth, as well as to all members of the work-
ing and middle classes. Although they make special appeals
to the youth, youth had no part in their making.

2. To carry this program into action, and simultaneously
bring it to the attention of the whole youthful population
of the United States. This is done through the regional and
local continuations committees (or councils) of the Con-
gress, and through the various aﬂiliated organizations.

3. To forge closer bonds of unity between all youth,
between Jew and Gentile, Catholic and Protestant, Negro
and white, native and foreign born, as well as between
youth of America and of other lands, and between youth
and adults of the working and middle classes—whose prob-
lems frequently overlap and in a great many cases coin-
cide with one another. The American Youth Congress is
the ardent champion of all minorities, and although deﬁn-
itely American in tradition and ideals, is ﬁrmly opposed to
narrow nationalism, and an ardent supporter of ﬁrm inter-
nationalism of all peoples.

An American Program

The core of the American Youth Congress movement is
its program. Created by youth and adopted by the elected
representatives of hundreds of thousands of young farmers,
workers, and students, it is not simply a statement of prin-
ciples but a plan whereby these principles may be translated
into action.

The program, for example, does more than declare a de-
termined opposition to war, which today is mainly pro-
moted by proﬁt-greedy monopolists and their jingo, big-
army-big-navy catellites. It declares that war is best pre-
vented by not waiting to oppose it until the day it arrives,
but by organizing demonstrative actions against war now-
in the form of mass meetings, parades, and outdoor assem-
blies--—so that those who are responsible for wars will know
in advance the attitude of the youth who are expected to
die in them. The program, also calls for the support of
strikes in industries engaged in the manufacture of muni-
tions, for the demilitarization of the C.C.C. camps, and the
abolition of military training in the schools.

Particular attention is paid in the American Youth Con-
gress program to the question of Fascism. This is not sur-
prising in the View of the particular attention which this
growing menace to culture and civilization pays to youth,
and in view of the wide support given it by newspapers and
radio as it appears under various guises in the United

11

    

  

States. The program warns the youth of America against
several Fascist movements now appearing in this country,
which conceal the headman’ s axe of black reaction under
a cloak of pseudo-radicalism, and which, whether led by a
clergyman, senator, or retired general, are equally danger-
ous to the welfare of youth and the whole people.

The program is likewise concerned with bettering the
working and living conditions of farm and laboring youth.
It holds as inviolable under ordinary human justice the
right of workers to engage in collective bargaining in labor
unions of their own choice, and condemns the almost in-
variable line-up of all government agencies, including courts,
police, and National Guard, on the side of employers in
all industrial disputes. For those youth who are unable to
secure employment, the program calls for a system of unem-
ployment insurance, whose beneﬁts shall include youth and
all those at present unemployed, and shall be paid out of
taxes on incomes of $5,000 a year and over. It calls for the
replacement of C.C.C. and Transient Camps with unem-
ployment insurance or jobs at regular wages. It demands
that child labor be completely abolished, with provision
equal to loss of wages to children thus displaced from in-
dustry.

In the matter of education, the program insists that in-
stead of less, there should be more money appropriated to
schools in times like these, when so many people are unable

12

 

to ﬁnd jobs and might at least prolong their education. It
believes that the civil liberties guaranteed in the Bill of
Rights should be strictly observed in schools and colleges,
and that full academic freedom should be accorded students
as well as teachers.

Finally, the American Youth Congress program deplores
the tendency on the part of the widely heralded “New
Deal” to allow the “forgotten man” to sink out of sight
beyond the pale of living memory, and to bend its eﬁorts
instead to the furtherance of monopolies, to raising prices
to dizzy heights and reducing wages to a sub-subsistence

dead level.

In its totality the American Youth Congress program is
a veritable bill of rights, a modern declaration of the rights
and aims of young America, a document planted ﬁrmly
on all that is ﬁne and progressive in American tradition and
rooted deeply in the ideals for which our forefathers fought
and died. It staunchly supports the political and social
equality of all races, creeds, and nationalities, including the
Negro people who comprise a large section of the back-
bone of the American nation——the laboring class. It recalls
the Constitutional guarantees of free speech and free assem-
blage, and takes a determined stand against any attempt
to abridge these rights. It stands for those sterling prin-
ciples of justice, equality, and a good life for all, which
were enunciated in the Declaration of Independence on

13

    

  

July 4, 1776, and for which our forefathers battled in the
American Revolution.

Subject to Amendment

Being completely democratic, the American Youth Con-
gress program is subject to amendment, and one of the
tasks of the delegates to the Second American Youth Con-
gress will be to re-examine it and determine how it may be
improved. The program is the creation of the youth of
America. It is their program and they have the power and
the right to make any changes or modiﬁcations in it as they
see fit. Pending that time it is a document around which
young people may well rally for their own betterment. That
they are doing so is evidenced by the steadily mounting
army of youth who, week by week, in ever larger numbers,
are throwing their weight behind the American Youth Con-
gress program, are familiarizing themselves with it, and
working for it.

But a program without action is empty, meaningless. A
good program is really a plan of action, and the American
Youth Congress program is such a program. Activities
which the American Youth Congress has carried on include
a campaign for the enactment of the Workers’ Unemploy-
ment and Social Insurance Bill (H.R. 2827), a militant
and, for the most part, successful struggle against the
numerous anti-civil liberties bills recently introduced into

14

 

state and national legislatures, and a ceaseless and untiring
campaign for the freedom of working class prisoners, in-
cluding the Scottsboro boys, Tom Mooney, and Angelo
Hemdon. One of the most successful and far-reaching of
these actions was the nation-wide student strike on April 12,
of which the American Youth Congress was a co-sponsor,
which resulted in over 200,000 students voluntarily leaving
their classes for one hour in a protest against war and Fas-
cism. At the time this pamphlet goes to press the various
aﬂiliated organizations and committees are working vali-
antly in preparation forthe Youth Parades Against War
and Fascism to beheld on Memorial Day, under sponsor-
ship of the American Youth Congress. These activities,
more than anything else, are responsible for the tremendous
growth of the American Youth Congress.

The rate of growth is little short of phenomenal. The
first American Youth Congress, held last August, was at-
tended by less than two hundred delegates. Four months
later, one of the regional congresses—Michigan—restricted
to a single state and with only ﬁve weeks of preparation,
attracted 513 delegates. The Second American Youth Con-
gress, on July 4, will be participated in by more than 3,000
regularly elected delegates. A

iTbe Second American Youth Congress

These delegates will hail from every state and section of
the Union: sharecroppers and textile workers from the

15

    

south, young miners from Pennsylvania, students, oﬂice, and

professional workers from New York, farmers from Iowa, I

lettuce pickers from California, iron puddlers from Indiana,
ranch workers " from Montana, youth from the churches,
Y’s, settlement houses, community centers, fraternal so-
cieties, cultural circles, C.C.C., and from every conceivable
group or association, to which the young people belong.

They will gather in Detroit on the evening of July 4 for
a monster outdoor celebration and mass meeting, which
will also be attended by thousands of youth not delegates
to the Congress. This celebration will be a milestone on
the path to emancipation from many of the social and
economic injustices that shackle a depression-ridden genera-
tion, and it is altogether-ﬁtting that it should occur on the
anniversary of the day our forefathers announced their
emancipation from the shackles of a tyrannous monarchy.

The succeeding three days will be devoted to the serious
business of hammering out a program to be carried into
action for the advancement of the welfare of American
youth. The Congress faces squarely the manifold diﬂiculties
that beset the present younger generation, laying down a

-plan to guide themselves and their constituents in over-

coming these difficulties. Here the voice of youth will be
heard, clear and straightforward, disclosing with youthful
honesty the mainsprings behind this social chaos, studying,
teaching, outlining with simple directness the steps which

16

    

/

must be taken for the common good of all the people,
youth and adults alike. Here the bonds of unity, under-
standing, and good feeling will be tightened to protect the
rights of minorities, and to weld the whole body of Amer-
ican youth together to march forward to a better life and
a higher destiny.

But not the whole time will be devoted to business, inter-
esting and important as it may be. There will be addresses
by ﬁgures of outstanding national prominence, offering a
variety of points of view on numerous questions. Besides
this, one evening will be given over to entertainment, pro-
bably in the form of a moonlight steamer dance, by way of
the Detroit River down to Lake Erie or up to Lake St.
Clair. Add to these attractions the stimulus of association
between delegates from widely divergent sections of the
country, and it will be seen that the Second American
Youth C ongress will not only be a monument to the awak-
ening of American youth, but will be as well an unforget-
table lifetime experience to every individual who attends it.

Set Up Provisional Committees

Preparations are already under way in cities and towns
throughout the country to make the Second -American
Youth Congress the greatest delegated convocation of
youth this country has ever seen. Provisional committees
have been set up in some localities, and are rapidly being

17

    

formed in others, for the purpose of popularizing the Second
American Youth Congress, and inviting all youth organ-
izations, regardless of creed, color, nationality, and political
opinion, to elect delegates.

Where no provisional committee exists, young people who
have the interests of the American Youth Congress at heart
should proceed to organize one, by calling a meeting and
inviting all the various youth organizations to elect delegates
to attend this meeting and accept membership on. the com-
mittee. Every effort should be devoted to making the provi-
sional committee as broadly representative as possible. All
bona-ﬁde youth organizations, and general organizations
with a large youth membership, should participate in its
formation and activity. Only by following this policy
throughout the country will the Second American Youth
Congress itself be made as fully representative of American
youth as it deserves to be.

In Detroit, greater tasks face the local provisional com-
mittee than elsewhere, inasmuch as it has the responsibility
for all the arrangements in connection with the Congress.
For this reason an especially large and extensive committee
has been formed, the Committee of 76. The Committee of
76 will have complete charge of all.matters alfecting the
Second American Youth Congress, except those speciﬁcally
relating to program. It is, in short, to all intents and pur-
poses, the sponsoring body of the Congress, as authorized by
the National Continuations Committee.

18

All Detroit youth organizations, not at present aﬂiliated
to the Committee of 76, who desire to have a hand and
voice in the preparations for the’Second American Youth
Congress, who are concerned—as they rightfully should be
—-that every interest and shade of opinion be consulted
and be given ‘adequate representation, should immediately
inform the Committee of 76 and signify their intention to
afliliate. As an evidence of good faith, and to assist in de-
fraying the expense incidental to the preparation for the
Congress, a membership fee of one dolla_r is asked of each
organization.

The funds raised in this way will not by any means be
adequate, however, in view of the extraordinary expenses
of printing, stationery, postage, rent and general oﬂice
overhead, as well as rent of halls, fees for speakers, and so
forth, necessary at the time of the Congress itself. For this
reason a general appeal is being made to everybody who
appreciates the importance and worthwhileness of this great
youth movement, adults as well as youth, in Detroit and
elsewhere, to make a voluntary contribution, however small,
to further this good work. Contributions should be sent to
the address given on the back of this pamphlet.

In conclusion, all youth organizations of whatever nature,
which meet anywhere within the United States or its pos-
sessions, are urged immediately to begin devoting a part of
their meetings to a discussion of the American Youth Con-

gress, its program, as well as to independent research into
the questions touched upon in the program. Delegates
should be elected as soon as feasible to the Second American
Youth Congress, and activities undertaken in the form of
dances, socials, etc., to defray the expenses of sending the
delegates to the Congress. The Committee of 76 invites
all youth organizations and local provisional committees to
keep in touch with it and to feel free to ask any questions,
or to call on it for any assistance it may be able to olfer. It
pledges itself to work, with the utmost self-sacriﬁce, to-
ward the goal of a Second American Youth Congress in
Detroit, on ‘July 4, 5, 6, and 7, which shall decisively sig-
nalize the coming of age of American youth!

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

Editorial Comment

Following is a copy of an article which appeared in the
Connecticut Craftsman (oﬂicial organ of the A. F. of L.
in that state) in March, 1935:

“The nucleus of what promises to become a strong
movement for social and economic justice has been
formed in the recent organization of the Hartford Con-
tinuations Committee of the American Youth Congress,
the program of the latter having been adopted by dele-
gates from a varied range of organizations comprising
a total membership of close to two millions.

"The time seems to have passed when youth took its
duties to society lightly, being well protected from the
biting economic problems which they face today. Now,
young people everywhere are becoming conscious of the
modern problems which threaten society’s structure, and
they are starting to do something about it. Groups that
never before have found a common ground have that now
in such organizations as the American Youth Congress
. . . Catholics . . . Protestants . . . Jews . . . Negroes . . .
Whites . . . Laborites . . . Communists . . . Socialists-
and even Right Wing Groups—all have accepted the

21

  

invitation to join together in thrashing out problems
about which most of them have come to the same broad
conclusions.

“This might seem too fantastic for reality were it not
for the fact that ‘although the various Congresses will
inevitably deal with many political subjects, the actions
of the Congresses themselves must stringently maintain
an attitude of scrupulous non-partisanship.’ ”

* * *

The following editorial comment on the Michigan Youth
Congress, which convened on December 14, 15, and 16,
1934, as one of the regional gatherings under the sponsor-
ship of the American Youth Congress, is indicative of the
kind of response the American Youth Congress and its
regional affiliates are receiving all over the country.

* >l< *

Michigan Christian Ada/ocate.—.-“A real youth movement
seems, at last, to be under way in these United States of
America. It is genuinely of, for, and by the young
people. . . . Sunday afternoon the Findings Committee
brought in its report which indicates that though this
group was not deﬁnitely being sponsored by any religious
organization, yet it was arriving at similar conclusions
reached previously by many Christian gatherings of
youth. The mind of the group seemed to be uncom-

 
  
 
 
 
  
   
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
   

, promisingly set dead against war and the whole military
program. . . . The conclusion of the Congress can be
summed up in a single sentence: Young People-—Be-
ware of the Fascist trends already too apparent in
America.”

Bulletin of the Council of Social Agencies, Metropolitan
Detroit — “Standing very close to each other and speak-
ing for all submerged groups, they (the delegates to the
Michigan Youth Congress) determinecl to work for such
objectives as any sane parent could wish for his child-
world peace, educational facilities, decent working condi-
tions, protection for children. If the Congress went
further to the left than the leaders had foreseen, it at
least stood for that most American principle-—democ-
racy; it at no time denounced the existing social order,
though it decried many of today’s social and economic

evils.

“The Congress, it seemed to some of us, who watched
from the side lines with interest and sympathy, destroyed
entirely one myth-that of the callowness of youth. For
these young people were thoughtful, keen, and tolerant;
in spite of their disillusionment, they had hope and de-
termination; they really seemed to believe that all men
are brothers.”

Charles Harris, President of the Junior Division of the
23

  

 Detroit National Association for the Advancement of
 Colored People-—"\X/e pledge our full cooperation in all

of your plans and activities, and I hope personally to
;_ take an active part in them.”

Radio Broadcast on -"Foreign A fair: Forum” made by
Francis A. Henson, general secretary in U.S.A. of Inter-
national Student Service-—“The American Youth Con-
gress is the broadest united action which has ever been
achieved by youth groups in the United States.”

The Truth About the American Youth
' Congress

By ARTHUR CLIFFORD
Chairman of the Michigan Youth Congress

PROBABLY no single recent social aspect of American
life has given rise to more controversial opinion than
the youth congress‘ movement. It is, in the eyes of some,
"the most hopeful sign in the last ﬁve years”, to others it is
“visionary, too ambitious, dangerously radical.”

What exactly is the truth about the American Youth
Congress movement? What are its aims, its background,
history, its accomplishments? These questions are all the
more pertinent in the light of the fact that July 4th of this
year will see the convention of the historic Second American
Youth Congress, in Detroit, which, it is conﬁdently anti-
cipated, will be the largest and most representative gather-
ing of young people ever to assemble in the history of the
United States.

Perhaps the foremost fact about the American Youth
Congress, and the one most responsible for its rapid 
exceptional growth, is its essentially American character. It

should not be forgotten that until very recently there was no
“youth movement,” so to speak, in America. While young
people in other countries displayed an active interest in pol-
itics, government, and social problems, the political apathy
of American youth was a subject of general comment. This
despite the fact that comparatively large numbers of youth
did actually participate in the periodic social upheavals that
have swept the country during the depression years.

Even as late as December, 1933, Henry A. Wallace, U.S.
Secretary of Agriculture, could say, without complete justi-
ﬁcation, however, that there was something altogether “too
smug, complacent, and self-satisﬁed” about American youth.
“We have never,” he asserted in an address to the Confer-
ence of Students on Politics, then in session at Washington,
D. C., “had in America a youth movement worthy of the
name. Since the war we have heard much about ‘ﬂaming
youth’ and the rebellion of youth in this country, but these
terms have merely described a rather smart-alecky, pre-
mature sophistication.” This statement, of course, while
having a pertinent measure of truth, placed at a discount
the widespread although disconnected activity which was
soon to take on an organized form.

Today, a very short time since this statement was uttered
-——a matter of months really ——-there is in America a youth
movement worthy of the name. It has enlisted the support
of hundreds of thousands of young people who have entered

4

enthusiastically into the formulation of its program and
who are now working in their organizations and on com-
mittees to carry this program into action.

First American Youth Congress

The ﬁrst American Youth Congress was held in New
York, August 15, 16, and 17, 1934. It was attended by
delegates representing 79 diﬂerent organizations and ap-
proximately 1,700,000 youth in sixteen states of the Union.
It was called by Viola Ilma and her Central Bureau for
Young America. Miss Ilma is a young person who deter-
mined to devote herself to a career of youth work, having
published a bool<,,“And Now Youth,” as well as three issues
of a magazine, “Modern Youth.” She hit upon the idea
of calling an American youth congress which should pre-
sume to be the oﬂicial mouthpiece of American youth and
line up the youth of America behind her social and econ-
omic program, a program identical in most respects to that

of the "New Deal.”

There is today a good deal of evidence to support tr c
View that Miss Ilma was not acting entirely in the interests
of American youth when she called her American Youth
Congress. She had recently returned from a visit to Nazi
Germany, having conferred with high oﬂicials in the Na-
tional Socialist government. The source of her expense
money for this pilgrimage she has never cared to divulge,

5

    

  

although only by so doing could she effectively answer the
charge that her trip was ﬁnanced by the Nazis themselves.
This is a serious charge inasmuch as it is well known that
the Fascist government of Germany has a cynical, coolly
directed policy of corrupting college professors, journalists,
and other teachers of youth to disseminate the vicious Nazi
doctrines in America by the simple expedient of providing
these unprincipled individuals with a free trip to Germany.
Add to this the fact that Miss Ilma is an acknowledged
and devoted admirer of Adolph Hitler, and the inference

is inescapable.

Furthermore, the funds with which Miss Ilma ﬁnanced
the American Youth Congress were for the most part con-
tributed by persons and interests decidedly inimical to the
interests of the majority of American youth. The ‘names
of large scale industrialists and ﬁnanciers, who have con-
sistently stood in opposition to the welfare of the working
and middle classes, from which the great mass of youth

 

hails, dominate her contributors’ list with gifts of consider- ,

able size.
H and-Picked Delegates

Then, too, there is good reason to quarrel over the way
in which delegates were recruited to the Congress. Little or
no effort was spent in seeing that delegates were democrat-
ically elected, and that all sections of the youth population

6

were represented, including farmers and industrial workers
—aims which have been constantly in the forefront of all
preparations for the Second American Youth Congress.
Instead, delegates were secured in a very haphazard fashion,
by personal invitation. By this means it was hoped to pack
the Congress with a body of delegates who would meekly
accept Miss Ilma’s private program, an achievement of
more vital concern to her than any attempt to have the
youth of America draw up a program of their own.

Finally, no sooner had the Congress assembled than Miss
Ilma proceeded to put into practice the lessons learned
from her Fascist mentors, suppressing all democratic rights
of free speech and free discussion. Miss Ilma was chairman,
without the formality of election. Everything was arranged.
All the delegates need do was jump through a few hoops,
give a general, if somewhat lackadaisical, vote of conﬁdence
in Viola Ilma, and go home, leaving in the willing and
ambitious hands of this disciple of Hitler the mandate to
solve the manifold problems with which the present younger
generation is faced.

The youthful delegates smelled Fascism. They resented
with all the spirit that their devotion to American Revolu-
tionary traditions gave them, this attempt to restrict their
democratic rights. They insisted on democratically electing
their own chairman. They insisted on the right to formulate
their own program—a program which should truly represent

the desires and opinions of American youth. They won
their point, and Miss Ilma in high dudgeon withdrew from
the Congress, with a few dozen delegates, mostly unaﬂiliated
henchmen of hers.

Remarkable Growth

Thus the American Youth Congress was born. Since
then the movement has grown larger, ﬁrmer, and broader,
involving ever more numerous strata of youth—youth from
the churches, schools, mines, factories, farms, trade unions,
language and racial groups, in short, from every walk of

life.

Since then, regional congresses have been held in New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon,
Michigan, Buﬂalo, Rochester, Schenectady, Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, San Fran-
cisco, Honolulu, New Orleans, Topeka, and St. Paul, as
well as a National Youth Congress in Washington, D. C.,
to name only a few of the most important. Without a
single exception these congresses went on record as funda-
mentally endorsing the program of the American Youth
Congress, with slight modiﬁcations to adapt it to local or
changing conditions.

Exactly how large may be the number of youth who
participated in these congresses through the medium of
their elected delegates, it would be impossible to say. In

8

 

only one of them, the Michigan Youth Congress, there
were over ﬁve hundred oﬁcial delegates in attendance, hail-
ing from 57 different cities and towns, from 232 different
organizations, and representing between two and three hun-
dred thousand young people of the state.

Unquestionably there must be a great deal of substance
to a youth movement which in so short a time has been able
to command so much inﬂuence and enthusiasm. And when
one realizes that it is a movement rising largely spon-
taneously from the youth themselves, organized along the
lines of absolute democracy, sensitive to every wish of its
youthful constituents, its tremendous importance to the
youth of America and the future of America becomes evi-
dent.

Three Major Aims

It would be interesting, therefore, to investigate the aims
of this American Youth Congress movement. Brieﬂy and
basically they are three:

1. To determine, by direct appeal to youth itself, what
are the major problems facing the young people of America
today, and to construct, by free exchange of ideas and
opinions, a program looking to the solution or amelioration
of these problems. The American Youth Congress is one
of the few mass youth movements in America, whose pro-
gram, while recognizing kinship with similar adult move-
