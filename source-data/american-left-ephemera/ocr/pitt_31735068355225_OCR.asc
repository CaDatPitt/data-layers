INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.——The Indiana State Health Department closed down the
National Lead Company’s secondary smelter for a week at the end of last month,

' - following an inspection of the plant which found that 27 workers—more than half

of those employed ~— had blood levels of lead far higher than what is considered

safe.

' . “This is only one shocking example of the high incidence of lead poisoning
among smélterinen throughout the country,” said Mine-Mill International Secretary-

Treasurer -Irving Dichter, “but it helps point up the need for federal safety legisla-
' tion which will set and-- enforce liiliform safety standards.”

Although, in the past, some companies have required periodic clean-ups‘. of their
plants or closed down certain departments temporarily because of unsafe conditions,

this is perhaps the first time
that an entire plant has been
closed on order from a state
government.

The Health Department re-

port stated that the dust and"

-lead -fumes were -among the_
worst ever encountered.

Eiglrl Very Bad Cases

Company representatives,
meeting with Health Depart-
ment officials on May 18, im-
mediately after the inspection,

. were asked to lay,off immedi-

ately eight workers with ex-

A. tremely high blood lead counts.

The plant was then closed

down from May 25 through June ,

2, and none of the 27 workers
involved were allowed to return
to work unless their lead count
had dropped back into the safe

-orange.

Medication for the 27 em-

I ployees was started on May 18,

and daily checks by
wereordered. - ~-

Clayi-on Firm Hired

Clayton Associates of Detroit,
Mich. was hired by the com-
pany to put the plant in proper
condition during the one week
shutdown. The" state insisted
that the clean-up required in-
stallation of new safety equip-
ment. The plant is due to close
again from June 15 to 29 for
vacations.

Following the May 18 meet-
ing, the workers voted unanim-
ously to cooperate while the
state's recommendations are
being carried out.

-Local 632 ‘President William
Jones, Joseph Scruggs, "the, re-
cording "secretary, and Jesse

Van Camp, "international repre-'

sentative, attended’ the May 18
meeting on behalf of the union.
J. F. Keppler, -the director

of the Division» of Industrial-
. Hygiene of the Indiana Board

of Health, chaired the meeting,

which was ‘also attended by

Hobert P. Butler, an Indiana La-

bor Department commissioner,

R. C. Mckittrick, plant superin-

tendent, and C. Wickemeyer,
‘general superintendent, Chicago
branch of the NationalgLead
Company, among others.
‘ The Indianapolis situation is
reminiscent of the fight by Lo-
cal 51 in Selby, Calif. to get
AS&R to clean up its lead
smelter there.

Over. a year ago... the Car-
quinez Smelter Workers "Union
began‘ requesting" an inquiry
into possible lead poisoningat
the Selby p1ant—an investiga-
tion which was eventually car-
ried out by the California De-
partment of Public’ Health.

There too, medical check-ups
of some 40 employees disclosed
that over 50 percent had danger-
out lead conditions, according
to Dr. L. Lewis, an authority on
non-ferrous industrial diseases,
who supervised the program.
AS&R closed down some depart-
ments for a brief clean-up, and
there followed months of discus-
sions and conferences between
company, union, and state offi-
cials and representatives of the
Kaiser Medical Service, which
handles the health and welfare
insurance for the workers.

A Public Health report, is-
sued in April, indicates that
many of the‘ recommended
safety procedures have now
been instituted at the Selby
smelter, including more regu-
lar medical checks on both the
urine and the blood of the_ em-

. ployees. The report cites the-

need for removing -workers from

high exposure areas on the
basis of increased lead storage,
even if there are no symptoms.

An English doctor at the Uni-
versity of Manchester, Robert
E. Lane, writing in an AMA
journal a few months ago, re-
ferred to “this slightly poisoned
man, who is able year after
year to carry on with his work.”
“I maintain,” wrote Dr. Lane,

“that is does matter—that a,

substantial proportion of these
men are being damaged, and
that from this group come
those who, later on, show evi-
dence of this damage and in
some cases die before they
should.”

A recently-passed law in Eng-
land requires periodic examina-
tions of all lead workers in cer-
tain industries. ’

E Iecfion Set in Anaconda

This year's raiding season ended last month, with
Steelworkers President David J. McDonald on the same
diet as when it started. For seven months now, he’s been
eating crow. There’s been a little variety though. He’s
also been forced to swallow a few of his own words.

Four Mine-Mill election victories in late April and
May plus the forced withdrawal of a Steel petition in
Butte, Mo‘n_t., completely crushed the heralded assault
by that 11111011 upon Mine-Mill’s jurisdiction in the non-

ferrous metals industry.

Rallying around the Mine-Mill bargaining program
for 1964, workers at the Magma Copper Company’s
mine, mill, and smelter in San Manuel, Ariz., the Ana-
conda American Brass Company plant in Buffalo, N. Y.,

the Anaconda Company smelter
in Great Falls, Mont., and the
AS&R refinery in Baltimore,
Md., snowed under the attempt-
ed raids.

National Wage Policy Group

Set to Break Bargaining Sfall

As the Mi11e-Mill Union goes to press, the International Executive Board and
delegates to the National Wage Policy Committee prepare to convene in a special
session in Denver during the week of June 8. Bargaining experiences to date with all
major non-ferrous metals companies will be reviewed at this national meeting, and the

delegates will develop plans for -bringing

of the month.

All major contracts expire on June 30. .
“This national meeting,” International President A. C. Skinner said, in calling
the session, “will mark the end of the stalling and foot-dragging by the companies
Which has characterized negotiations since the contracts were opened on May 1.”

“Every major mining company V

has been ‘playing it cool’ ."and

watching from the sidelines .

while Mine-Mill was pre-occu-
pied with disruptive Steel raids
in ‘five states,” he maintained.
“But the disruption of bar-
gaining by the Steelworkers is
now over,” he continued, “and
the June 30 expiration date is
rapidly approaching. There are
no more excuses for stalling.
Negotiations will be taken out of
the deep freeze and thawed out
in the next two weeks. It's now
time for serious bargaining.”

The Anaconda Company, .be- -

cause of the futile Steel raid in
Great Falls, was the last major

first time. -

At the American Brass Com-
pany in Buffalo, N.Y., an Ana-

SELBY, Calif. —— Arbitrator
John P. Troxell of Stanford Uni-

proximately $55 to Ervin L.
Fisher, now a carpenter first

class at the AS&R smelter, in a.

recent ruling.

‘ A member of Mine-Mill Local
51, Fisher was paid the differ-
ential of 10,1/2 cents per hour be-
tween first and second class
carpenter for the period from
Oct. 1, 1963 to Jan. 1, 1964.

His grievance was that a
man with less departmental
seniority, George E. ‘Greene,
was given a promotion in Octo-
ber for which Fisher had’ap-
plied. Fisher was promoted
from second to first class car-
penter on Jan. 1.

Although the company said
that Fisher did" not have the
necessary qualifications to be
promoted in October, Arbitrator
Troxell ruled that AS&R should
have fully informed him on how
he was being judged. Troxell
said that his decision will help

Great Falls Workers Topi

Steel by Margin of 212

GREAT FALLS, Mont.-——In huge contrast to an election squeaker of two years
ago, Mme-M111 Local 16 here crushed an attempted raid by the United Steel-
workers of America by a 621 to 409 vote in a NLRB election on May 15, retain-
ing bargaining rights for some 1100 workers at the Anaconda Company smelter.

This was the fourth time that Steel had unsuccessfully challenged Mine-Mill’s
jurisdiction in Great Falls, and the'13th time in the past 10 years that Steel has
tried and failed to dislodge Mine-Mill from Anaconda Company properties in Mon-
tana. In Anaconda, Mont., where the Steelworkers won an election in 1962, a petition
has been filed by Mine-Mill for
a repeat election this year, al-
though no date has yet been set.

District 1 Board Member
Barney Rask, who stressed that
“this victory belongs to the
workers,” said that last month’s
election proves once and for all
that Mine-Mill is the union
which represents the smelter-
men in Great Falls.

The 212-vote marginfor the

 

‘ bor Record, a labor newspaper
in Pima ‘County, featured the

'  Mine-Mill victory with a scream-

ing headline on its front page.

—The story quoted a Mine-Mill

spokesman as saying that the

.9 ; win was achieved despite the
 “downright dirty tactics of the
7- > Red-baitingist union of them all”

' '—-;-tactics which included threat-

ening Mexican nationals with de-

portation should they support

’  Mine-Mill.

The victory for Local 937,

.7 "which is "in the-dozen-member

Magma Unity Council, cleared

 the way for it to get back to bar-
- gaining with Magma Copper.

Formed for Bargaining

 The Unity Council, formed
. early this year, includes Mine-

Mill Locals 937 and 938 in San
Manuel and Superior, and AFL-
CIO Metal Trades unions, Team-
sters, and Railroad Brother-

 hoods in the two towns. It was
 established to strengthen labor’s
‘ bargaining position with the

‘company. _

For Company
Officials in l963

Promotions for top officials
of the American‘ Smelting and
Refining Company led to big
salary increases in 1963, accord-
ing to information filed with the
Securities and Exchange Com-
mission this year.

Principal beneficiaries were
E. McL. Tittmann, chairman,
whose salary rose to $121,832 in
1963 from $88,320 in 1962. R. D.
Bradford, president, received
$108,459 in 1963, up from $88,320
the previous year. R. Worth
Vaughan, vice-president, re-
ceived $72,916 last year, com-
pared to $72,860 in 1962.

The three men took over their

‘present positions on April 23,

1963. Tittmann and Bradford
were formerly executive vice-
presidents, while Vaughan was
formerly vice-chairman.

Top copper company officials
did even better last year. 1963
salaries were as follows:

Anaconda Company: Clyde E.
Weed, chairman, ~$204,460;
Charles M. Brinckerhoff, presi-
dent, $154,320; C. Jay Parkinson,
executive vice-president, $129,-
280; Edward S. McGlone, execu-
tive vice—president, $124,460‘;

$151,100; Walter C. Lawson,
vice—president, 76,600; J. Mills
Hawkins, vice-president $59,594.

    

FROM THE ECR DEPT. AND

Mill and Smeltermen’s Union
compared to the one vote by
which Mine-Mill won in 1962.
That year, the Chemical Work-
ers were also on the ballot, and
received a handful of votes, with
Mine-Mill getting the barest of
possible majorities of the total
number cast. Mine-Mill had 476
in 1962, to 460 for Steel.

Heavy Vote

On May 15, three workers vot-
ed for neither union, and one
vote was challenged. A total of
1,034 votes were cast out of a
total of 1,056 e1igibles——a 98 per-
cent turnout.

Other attempted Steel raids
were beaten in 1951 and 1956.

The victory was a key one for
Mine-Mill in view of the close-
ness of the 1962 vote. The Steel-
workers, who will be ousted
from the state completely should
they lose in Anaconda, kept Jim
Smith, a staff man, in Great
Falls for the past two years, and
brought in several other organ-
izers for the lengthy campaign
here. ‘

Financial Secretary Gabriel
Kuntz said after the results were
announced, “We’re‘going to ful-
fill the confidence that the rank
and file has shown through this
smashing‘ victory in this local
un1on.”

Kuntz, President Arthur Claus-
en, and J. P." Mooney, interna-
tional representative who has
been assigned to’ Great Falls for
the past year, ran the campaign
for Mine-Mill, assisted by the
many rank and file members
who did door-to -door contact
work, distributed literature, and
did organizational work at the
smelter.

Joe Dispenza, president of L0-
cal 485 in Bingham, Utah; Joe
Dunne, also from Local 485;
and Richard Miller of the press
department were assigned to

the campaign by the internation-
.al union. Mine-Mill Local 72 in

East Helena sent Jack Harris to
Great Falls for the final week.
Most of the pictures from
Great Falls appearing in this
issue were taken by Dunne.

Steelworkers
Scuttle Settlement

An important issue in the cam-
paign was the rejection of a pro-
posed settlement for the furnace
r e f in e r y _ department, which
would have set the crew at 24
men, lightened the work loads,
increased the length of lunch
periods and wash-up time, given
wage increases to some of the

.men, and provided free shoes

for every man in the depart-
ment. The terms ,of the settle-
ment, tentatively worked out by
the union’s negotiating‘ commit-
tee, which included six workers
from the department, was de-
feated in a department vote
when many of the Steel support-
ers opposed it.

The entire smelter was closed’

down late last fall in the dispute
over the furnace refinery, with
the company wanting to reduce
the work crew to 19 men. ..
The proposed settlement would
have gone into effect immediate-
ly, with unresolved issues being
carried over into the general ne-
gotiations. '

Baltimore Triumph

Keeps AS&R Unity

BALTIMORE, Md.—The rank and file of Mine-Mill
Local 625 beat back a Steel raid here on May 20, pre-
serving their bargaining unity with other AS&R locals
around the country through Mine-Mill’s AS&R Council.

The vote of 358 to 311 in an NLRB election handed
Steel its second defeat in two years at the Baltimore

refinery, which employs some 700 workers. The Victory
"was achieved despite the fact —

that Steel poured 10 paid or-
ganizers- into the area.

The Mine-Mill campaign con-
centrated heavily on the bar-
gaining program of the union,
while Steel pointed to the many
locals that it had in the Balti-
more area — locals, however,
which, for the most part, repre-
sent workers.in the steel indus-
try, not the non-ferrous metals
industry.

Raymond Thompson, former
president of Local 625, resigned
his position just a few weeks
prior to the election, and began
campaigning for Steel. The sud-
den shift seemed strange in
view of the fact that, only a
week before, Thompson had sent
a letter to all workers urging

that they not permit themselves

to be diverted by the raiders.
Sticking with the AS&R Coun-
cil, he had written, was the only
possible means of protecting the
interests of the Baltimore work-
ers.

International Vice - President
Asbury Howard, assisted by
Angelo Destefano and Edward
Coleman, international repre-
sentatives, and. Board Member
Alfred Petit-Clair, handled the
campaign for the Metal and Fab-
ricating Workers Union. Charles
Savoy, Local 625’s acting presi-
dent, and Chester Hetmanski,
the financial secretary, were
among the many extremely
active local members. Some
Mine-Mill members from the
New Jersey locals also took
part.

BUFFALO, N. Y.—The Buffalo Brass and Copper Workers Union No. 593
retained bargaining rights at the Anaconda American Brass Company on May ‘12,
clobbering the United Steelworkers of America by a 428 to 295 count. This was

the second defeat for Steel in two years at the
Anaconda Company. .

Some 800 men are employed in the production unit at the brass fabricating

mill.

There were five votes for neither union.

Mine-Mill stressed its 1964 bargaining program during the campaign,_and pointed
out the value of unity with other Anaconda locals in achieving those objectives. The

Steelworkers, on the other hand,
attempted to set one nationality
group against another and to
split the traditional Negro-white
unity of Local 593.
International Represe nt a tiv e
Joseph Scioli called the election

"‘a victory for unity, democracy,

jobs, and job security, and an
end to criminal raiding which
divides the workers, wastes their
energy, and drains their re-
sources.” “The top officials of
the Steelworkers Union, who are
responsible for the division in
the American labor movement
today,” he continued, “should
be organizing the unorganized
and‘ seeking unity in the labor
movement instead of wasting
their in e m b e r s’ hard-earned

money trying to break other un-

Scioli,

ship of the local were responsi-

which defeated the raid. L

Positions Differ
On Sales Tax

Local 593, along with the four
other Mine-Mill locals in -the
Buffalo area, has been in the
forefront of the fight against the
proposal to increase the Erie

County sales tax from one to,

three percent—a struggle which
continued during the raid. Mem-
bers of the Mine-Mill locals have
handed out thousands of leaflets

throughout the city on the issue.

and have been carrying on a-
petition drive against the pro-
posal.

The political arm of the area
United Auto Workers also has
condemned the proposed hike,
while the Steelworkers union,
through its state director Joseph
P. Malony, supported it.

ors still has not passed any tax

increase started last December
and is being supported by the

The UAW, with 16 local un-
ions and a membership of close

state, also joined Local 593 in
voicing opposition to the House

Scioli was one of those “hauled
before” the committee during its
Buffalo hearings, and the Steel-
workers attempted to make this
an issue during its raid. -

Arbitration Grant
Favors Union in

Overtime Case

MIAMI, Ariz.-—A. C. Heran—
dez and Ruben’C. Licano, two
members of the Miami Miners
Union, Local 586, each won back
back at time and a half for one
shift not worked, in‘ an arbitra-
tion award handed down late in
April by Dr. George N. Hilde-
brand of Ithaca, N. Y.

Both men were working in ‘

Inspiratio-n Copper, Company’s
tank house promotion unit last
November, and were improperly
passed ov'er”in the assignment
of overtime; work.

-The company, which admitted
the mistakes on the part of its
supervisor, had offered to pay
each man "for one shift not
worked at straight time or to let
each man work an extra shift to
be paid at time anda half. The
union argued that, since the
men had unfairly been denied
the chance to work for premium
pay in November," straight pay
was not, sufficient. ‘ It further
maintained that the company
could not now make available
extra work for the two men,
because that would take the
chance for overtime away from
other workers. _ ‘

Because of a history of griev-
ances over the issue of assign-
ments of overtime work, a sup-
plemental agreement to the con-
tract had been negotiated at the
beginning “of November, 1963.
This supplemental “agreement

closely ' regulates all temporary f

assignments -on a
basis.

It was this part of the con-
tractthat was violated by the
company later thatsame month,
Arbitrator Hildebrand ruled.

WHITESBURG, Ky.—Berman Gibson, the leader of a roving,
picket movement.in the coal fields of ‘southeastern Kentucky, ‘arid
six of his followers were acquitted late in April of charges that

they ﬂogged a group of non-union miners at a mountaintopytrap V

more than a year and a half ago.

The Letcher Circuit Court jury, which deliberated only an hou
and 25 minutes, found the defendants not guilty on two charges,"
armed robbery and assault with-intent to kill. Convictions on’ the
first charge would have meant life imprisonment or death in the
electric chair, while the assault charge carried possible sentences

of two to 21 years. ‘ - i

The legal defense for Gibson and his associates washandled-.,

by the Committee for Miners, formed in July, 1963 and sponsored;

by prominent trade unionists

~ and liberals. At its meeting last

November, the Mine-Mill execu-
tive board voted a $100 contri-
bution to the committee.

The seven defendants were
accused of setting up a road-
block near the top of Pine
Mountain to stop three cars
carrying several Harlan County
men to jobs with the Southeast
Coal Company in Letcher
County. Some of the men were
pistol-whipped, beaten with
fists, threatened, and robbed of
their-own weapons at gunpoint
in an incident that the prosecu-
tion alleged took place in No-
vember, 1962.,

One Year -Later

Gibson andthe other miners
were arrested and charged with
the crime in early November,
1963. » - ’
The defense, headed by attor-
ney Harry M. Caudill of Whites-
burg, ‘maintained that the de-
fendants were the victims of an
attempted frame-up by the com-
pany, which, Caudill charged,
“had a most vital interest in
seeing that the picket move-
ment didn’t work.”
. During the fall and winter of
1962, Gibson and his followers
organized more than 4,000 un-
employed miners in seven Ken-
tuck counties on two issues-
getting jobs and getting back
their union. The-roving picket
movement was aimed at the

operation of s m a ll hillside-

mines or “dog holes,” which
was being run on a non-union
basis, under generally unsafe
conditions.

Political Movement

Although the picketing even-.

tually failed, the movement led
_to the formation late last year

of the Appalachian Committee-

for Full Employment—a group‘ S‘
which is attempting to ,’organize‘__ M

politically the thousands of un-
employed Workers in the ‘area.
The- committee, which meets
every Saturday at an abandoned’
United Mine Workers hall 
Hazard, is also collectingand’
distributing food" and clothing‘ to
those in need. ‘
On July 14, another trial
will begin for Gibson and seven
other leaders of the movement.
The charge — conspiracy to
dynamite a railroad bridge. The

_federal trial will be held in‘

Lexington.‘

. Gibson claims collusion exists 4 - --

between the coal operators and,
the federal agents, state, and_
city police,‘ and‘ that the arrests
are simply further attempts at
intimidation. . -. '

President’: Column
*Stee| Rank and File Gan Rejoice;
  Their General Lost the War

by Al Skinner
S International President

p T A PRESS CONFERENCE in Tucson, Ariz. in February,
 Steelworkers President David McDonald made some rather
_- irrational public statements, among them a boastful “declaration
. of war on Mine-Mill.”

i L Members of our Arizona locals, reading their papers that day,
’wondered why the Steel president publicly announced a. “declara-
. tion of war,” since the Steel leaders’ war against Mine-Mill had
been going on for 15 years. I say “the war of Steel leaders” be-
---ecause that’s all it's ever been. The rank and file Steel member-
.{ship knows little about this 15-year “war” against Mine-Mill-
‘i6n\1y what McDonald chooses to publish in Steel Labor.

 

Si-eel Members Don't Know

 ”_ Members of the Steel Union don’t know that millions of dollars
:. that they ,pay in dues have been squandered over the past 15 years
. in a splitting, disruptive, but vain attempt to conquer and destroy
  ‘Mine-Mill. They don’t know that scores of so-called “organizers”
 are kept on the paid Steel staff for the sole

L ‘purpose of developing and promoting raids on ,
‘j’ -Mine-Mill locals. They don’t know that dozens 
 "of former Mine-Mill leaders were bought and 
 ‘ are -now paid -and carried on Steel’s staff for 
 ' this ..one purpose.
 , _ _ If the members of the United Steelworkers 2
‘ "knew the whole story and were told the stagger-
 ing cost to themselves of McDonald's 15-year
 “war,” they would be sick. They probably
.couldn’t do much about it since no one in the
_'Steel leadership seems much concerned about
 what the rank and file think. Steel members
I —don’t make steel policy. We wish they did. They
1- ﬂwould “soon put an end to these wasteful and suicidal raids against
' ‘trade union brothers.

Steel Raids in ‘I964

 A What did the 1964 series of raids in Arizona, Montana, New
_ York, Connecticut, and Baltimore get for -the Steel leaders? After
 " pouring another $100,000 down the drain, they wind up with 250
"jgof our members in Connecticut, while Mine-Mill took 250 Steel
<~ members in Arizona. Big deal! ‘

In Montana, there have been 13 Steel raids in the past ten
-.é._.- years. Steel won but one election, and these 1200 men—the smelter-
 .._men at Anaconda-are already, in two short years, fed up with
6 Steel’s broken promises and their now-broken union. Their story
 is a typical one of the damage of Steel raids to working men in
 the mining and smelting industry.

‘I00 Raids Since 1950 L

A * In over 100 raids since 1950; Davey McDonald has succeeded
 in breaking off a local here and a local there. The members of
such locals, now in Steel, admit they’ve lost their bargaining power
and their uinted front with miners and smeltermen in the in-

V dustry. Many of these locals have been led into long.and futile
 "strikes, and have been cut into little pieces by the big mining

. 5‘ companies;

- For all the boasts and baloney about Steel’s big union and big’

‘ treasury, the workers in the industry have been paid off in noth-
ing but broken promises. Thousands of miners, millmen, smelter-

. (men, and refinery workers in nonferrous metals have gradually
.- -— but surely learned the truth behind the false propaganda that
' ‘ Steel’s agents have been peddling for the past 15 years. It’s going

_ to "be much tougher for them to sell their tripe from now on.

**‘k

V _ “ HIS IS STEEL’S last raid in our local.” That statement has
‘ v ’ been made, in one form or another, by hundreds of men in
every local Steel tried to raid this year. Many of the workers
said, “Stee1’s had it here,” or “They had better not come back.”

After all, this was Steel’s fourth defeat in Butte and the fourth

A in Great Falls, Montana. It was their fourth licking in Buffalo. It

, ,.was their third loss in both San Manuel and Baltimore. The men

in these locals are not kidding—they’ve had enough of McDonald’s

“war.” Apparently they just don’t think the same way as a $50,-.

, 000-a-year labor leader. The view from in front of a hot furnace,
: ‘ after all, is not the same one gets from a $100-a-day hotel suite.

  Mr. McDonald. The War Is Over

- _'For all practical purposes, Steel’s raids are washed up. Fif-

teen years and a hundred raids are enough. Steel’s leaders can
'_ ‘continue pouring more millions of Steel members’ dues money
 down that raiding rathole, and they probably will—-until the mem-
{- zbership finds some way of stopping them. And this fantastic waste

Duarte and Stanford Elected

To Bisbee Common Council

BISBEE, Ariz.—The Copper Queen Miners Union, Local 551 made inroads last
month into a company-influenced Common Council, by helping to elect David G.

.Duarte and J. J. “Junior” Stanford to councilmanic seats in Wards 2 and 3 in a
general election on May 25. -

A third member of the Union, A. C. “Tex” Whiteaker, was defeated. in the
Democratic primary on April 20 by William Marshall, who was the incumbent in
Ward 1. John Banchi, the only other incumbent on the six-man council to be re-
elected, is a member of- the Teamsters Local 310. He snowed under Max Seger,

the only Republican candidate
competing in the general elec-
tion, by a 239 to 62 margin.

Because of the lopsided edge
that the registration figures in
Bisbee give to the Democrats,
the important election was the
April primary.

Duarte, business agent for
Local 551 and chairman of the
Arizona Mine-Mill Council, the
union’s political arm in the
state, defeated Manuel Lugo, a
local grocery store manager,
by a vote of 150 to 121. He then
turned back a write-in cam-
paign for Lugo in the general
election, 149 to 62. The seat in
Ward 2 had been vacant for sev-
eral months.

In the third ward, Stanford,
an underground‘ miner in Bis-
bee since 1940, edged John
Parker by an 83 to 75 margin
in the primary, and was swept
into office in the general,-
Parker getting but two write-in
votes‘ on May 25. Two years
ago Stanford dropped a pri-
mary contest by 13 votes to Otis

David G. Duarte

    

J. J. Stanford

Mason, who did not seek re-
election this year. '

Marshall polled 269 votes in
the Ward 1 primary, to 69 for

Whiteaker and 63 for Jess‘

Gamino. Whiteaker, a member
of the union’s grievance com-
mittee, also lost to Marshall in
1962.

Two other newcomers to the
council were elected. Fred Phil-
lipi, an underground engineer
for the Phelps Dodge Company,
was unopposed in Ward 4, and
Howard McKinny, an assayer at
the mill concentrator, defeated
Ralph Ruiz, a former council-
man, in Ward 6.

The _ incumbent mayor, Paul
Durrett, won another term, beat-
ing A1bert_ Domico by a mar-
gin close to 3 to 1.

A heavy vote of nearly two-
thirds of those registered turned
out for theprimary.

Local 551 and the ladies

auxiliary were credited with,

much strenuous and effective
political activity during the
campaigns. The women or-
ganized a telephone drive dur-
ing the final stages, aimed at
getting the workers to the polls.

Mine-Mil! Member
Wins Council Seal

MIAMI, Ariz.—Elias C. La-

zarin Jr., vice-president of the*

Miami Miners Union, Local 586
was elected to the seven-man
Town Council on May 25, fin-
ishing a strong third, with a
vote of 475, in his first race for
public office.

Although he was the only
Mine-Mill member running, the
first woman ever named to the
council, Katie Weimer, was the
office secretary for the Mine-
Mill local for several years in
the late 1950's. She won the en-
dorsement of the union and a
second place finish in the elec-
tion, polling 509 votes.

Otto Santa Anna, who was de-
feated in the same race two

_ years ago, this time ran first.

A member of the Teamsters
local in Miami, he received 519
votes.

A tank operator at Inspira-
tion Copper’s leaching plant,
Lazarin replaced’ Thomas
Morgan, who was killed in an
automobile acident late in April,
as vice-president of the union.
He is also the chairman of the
recently-formed Gila C o u n t y
Mine-Mill political action com-
mittee, which will coordinate
the political and legislative ac-
tivities of Local 586 and Locals
886 and 939 in Hayden.

A total vote of 1024 turned out
to choose the councilmen, who
are elected at large in the town
-—-the top seven vote-getters
winning.

Lazarin, Mrs. Weimer, and
Santa Anna qualified for- the
election by posting victories in
the Democratic primary on
April 20.

The councilmen—and woman
—will assume office in July, and
will elect the mayor of the
town from among their own

‘ranks.

land, Charlotte Hobson of Chicago, Louis Chatman, president of the Cleveland local,
and William Garrett of Chicago. A. Philip Randolph, president of the Brotherhood ' of
Sleeping Car Porters, is chairman of the National Steering Committee of the NALC,

founded in Detroit in May, 1960. The three-day convention approved resolutions urging’

support for the War on Poverty, passage of the civil rights bill, the setting up of (1 Com-
mission on Automation by President Johnson, discussions on the formation of an Amer-
ican Labor party, the abolition of the House Un-American Activities Committee, and a
summit conference on the state of the Negro race in September, among other things.

addressed the convention, saying that the most bitter racial war in the history of man-

kind couldferupt in South Africa and ‘spread to at world war if the racial policies of the

the recommendations made in the report-to the Congress by the
Secretary of the Interior entitled "Health and Safety study of Meta),
and Non-Metal Mines".

As you are aware we submitted our proposed bill to the Bureau of the
Budget and have been making every effort to expedite its clearance.
The Bureau referred the proposed bill to several Government depart-
ments such as the Departments of Justice, Labor, and Health, Education

and welfare and asked for their comments.

The recommendations of the

various departments had to be given the most careful consideration by

the Bureau and this Department and this has occasioned some delay in

clearance. ~ »

We are hopeful that clearance will be obtained" shortly and we will
forward our proposed bill and the reports on the Senate and House

Mine-Mill United for

Comin N goti tions
VANCOUVER, B.C.—Delegates to the well-attended
20th annual Mine-Mill Western District convention, held
at Fisherman’s Hall here from May 5. to 8, unanimously
passed a strongly-worded resolution of support to the
Trail and Kimberley locals, now in the final round of
bargaining with Consolidated Mining and Smelting Co.
- “The union is determined to fight through,” the
resolution stated, “and if a strike in the main Cominco
operations is necessary, there is no doubt but that the

union will. act.” Delegate after delegate demanded’ the ‘ ‘

floor to pledge the wholehearted financial, moral, and

unreserved support of his local
to the struggle.

Harvey Murphy, chairman of
the joint bargaining committee
now deadlocked in negotiations
with Cominco, maintained that
never in his 35 years in the labor
movement had he seen the kind
of unity and fighting spirit now
being demonstrated by the Com-
inco workers. He commented on
twomeetings held in Trail, each
of which was attended by over
1,000 members who wanted to
hear the progress reports of the
bargaining committee.

WGQESNOW Main Issue

Negotiations W i t h Cominco,
which is in especially good fi-

nancial shape this year, have,

been draggnig on since Jan. 16.
The union, in both Trail and
Kimberley, has been fighting for
the establishment of a 40-hour,
Monday to Friday week, with
bonus pay for Saturday and Sun-
day work, as well as for an hour-
ly wage increase of 15 cents.

Additionally, Mine-Mill is bar-
gaining for longer paid vacations
for the workers and supplemen-
tal retirement benefits.

A company offer of five cents

an hour for each year of a two-
year agreementwas quickly re-
jected by the union‘. Jack Sher-
lock, a government conciliator,
who entered the dispute -after
direct negotiations had failed,
said that his efforts to develop
an offer above the five cents an
hour had met with stubborn re-
sistance from the company.

As the negotiations now stand,
a government conciliation board

will hear evidence from 

parties, and submit a report to
the Minister of Labor.

Proﬁts Up 28 Percent

Although many other resolu-
tions were debated and passed,
the Cominco action became the
heart of the district convention
because 1964 is a bargaining
year for most Mine-Mill locals
in Canada. The settlement with
the huge company, which em-
ploys some 7,300 workers for its
various operations and which
reaped profits last year totaling
nearly $30,000,000, a 28 percent
gain over 1962, will undoubtedly
affect bargaining in the industry
throughout the country.

Running for the position of
national vice-president are Har-
yey Murphy of Vancouver and
Mike 'Solski of Sudbury, Ont.
Both are on the national execu-.
tive board. . . V

Until the constitution was
amended several months ago,
Murphy was the Western vice-
president of the union. He is
also chairman of the joint bar-
gaining committee involved in
the Cominco negotiations.

the Sudbury local, No. 598, is
serving his third term as the
mayor of Coniston.

I   S  t C’ ‘I R'ght
WASHINGTON,. D.C.——Although everyone agrees that a majority of U.S. Sena-

tors favors the substance of the comprehensive House-passed civil rights bill, the

problem continues to be one of lining up a two-thirds majority which favors the limit-

ing of debate so that a vote on the bill can be taken. Reports from this capital city
indicate that the first attempt at invoking cloture, the anti-filibuster rule which has

never been applied on a civil rights measure, will come on Tuesday, June 9.

In spite of the fact that Senate minority leader Everett Dirksen has dem anded
and gotten compromises from Democratic whip Hubert Humphrey on major provis-
ions of the bill, the vote on cloture is still uncertain as the filibuster grinds along in

its third month. A recent As-
sociated Press poll showed only
58 Senators—39 Democrats and
19 Republicans——prepared to

' vote to limit debate. The figures

is 9 shy of 67, the number of
votes needed to» constitute a
two-thirds majority if all the
Senators vote.

Opposition Votes

Definitely opposed to cloture,
of course, are the 18 members

-of the Southern caucus, and sev-

en other Democrats are leaning
strongly in that direction—Sens.
Albert Gore and Herbert S.
Walters of Tennessee, Alan Bible
and Howard W. Cannon of Ne-
vada, Carl Hayden of Arizona,
Frank J. Lausche of Ohio, and
J. Howard Edmondson of Okla-
homa. (Sen Edmondson, inci-
dentally, was badly beaten in a

_Democratic primary on Mayi26

by Sen. Fred Harris, so is serv-
ing his last few months in the
Senate. Harris, who won the pri-
mary by about 271,000 to 173,000,
will face Bud Wilkinson, the Re-
publican candidate, in Novem-
ber). . 1

Sens. John G. Tower of Texas
and Barry Goldwater of Arizona
are the two Republicans com-
mitted against cloture.

Uncommitted to Date I

The balance of power on this
issue, th e r e f 0 r e, apparently

rests with 15 Senators, many of

them from the Midwest and
Rocky Mountain area, who are
thus far uncommitted.

This group includes Wallace F.
Bennett (R-Utah), E. L. Meach-
em (R—N.M.), Ralph Yarborough
(D-Tex.), Peter H. Dominick (R-
Colo.), Len B. Jordan (R-Idaho),
Bourke B. Hickenlooper (R-
Iowa), chairman of the Senate
GOP Policy Committee; Jack
Miller (R-Iowa), and Milward
L. Simpson (R-Wyo.).

amendments to the bill was in-
troduced in the Senate on May
26, and were explained in party
caucuses. Some of the proposed
changes to the bill which passed
the House of Representatives by
a 290 to 130 vote on Feb. 10 are:

1) Federal funds can be with-
held only from a particular
locally-operated program or
from a particular locality
where discrimination exists,
rather than from an entire
state; - ’

2). Jurisdiction over complaints
.of discriminatory hiring or
denial of use of public accom-
modations would be given
first to state authorities for
a specified period before fed-
eral authorities can step in.
The original bill would allow
federal participation from
the start;

3) The Attorney General could
bring suit only in cases in-
volving an intentional pattern
or practice of discrimination

by groups of employers or
businessmen.

Another ‘possible amendment
might ‘be the inclusion of a pro-
vision which would provide a
jury trial for those violating the
law, even ‘though the civil rights
bill contains no primary crimi-
nal penalties and historically
jury trials are not authorized in
civil actions.

Mine-Mill Action

A recent Mine-Mill “Legisla-

tive Action Letter” to all locals
again urged that the member-
ship s continue letter-writing

campaigns to their Senators,

and the response has indicated

that this is being done. The
members of Chicago Amalga- *

mated Local 758, for instance,
sent over 500.post cards to Sen.-
Dirksen- In addition, letters
from Business Agent James

Pinta went to Sens. Dirksen and ' "

Paul Douglas.
The fight is critical and action

must be continued until cloture 3

is achieved.

Dear Senator,

(The following letter from the international of-
ficers was sent to the Senators of each of the 26 states,

‘Lee: Helps inmates

Ready for Release
TACOMA, Wash.—William E.
Lee, business agent of the Ta-
coma Smeltermen’s Union, Lo-
cal‘25, recently addressed a
group of inmates at the McNeil
(Island Federal Penitentiary
who were about to be released
from the prison. His talk was
part of a program designed to
help the men, most of whom
had '-been confined for many
years, in their transition from
institutional to private life, part-
ly by informing them about the
functions of labor organizations
andthe benefits to. be derived
from joining a union.  ' -
Lee represented -the industrial
type of union, while Roger Cru-
san of the Carpenters Union
spoke on behalf of the crafts.
‘Verne Neilsen from the Depart-
ment of Labor also spoke to the
men about apprenticeship pro-
grams.

Situation Normal—  
eompanies Sta! on Negotiations

by Irving Dichter
International Secretary-Treasurer
ITHIN a few days our International Executive Board to-
gether with our National Wage Policy Committee will be

meeting to assess negotiations to date.

We have presented our

demands to every major company in the industry. Thus far no
company has come forward with a set of counter proposals.
Heaven only knows what the companies are waiting for. They
have had years of experience in negotiating with our union. By
now they should know that attempting to settle with one of the
splinter unions in our industry or one of the craft unions will have

no effect on our bargaining.

UR demands are clear enough. It seems that year after year
we have to go through this period of paralysis on the part of

the companies. Each one is attempting to peek
around the corner to see what the other com-
pany will do. If that bothers them, we have
the solution—-industrywide bargaining.

During this period of paralysis some com-
panies go through ridiculous attempts to justify
their inactivity. The Kennecott Copper Corpo-
ration, in a report to its supervisors on the
May 18 negotiating session, makes these bril-
liant comments on some of the union’s de-

mands. We quote.

“1) UNION——Substantial wage increase.
COMPANY—Present wages are more
than competitive and higher than other

    

Dichter

companies in the industry.
V “2) UNION—Increase shift differentials to 10c, 15c and 20c per

hour.

COMPANY?-Existing shift differentials adequate and
, competitive’’—and so on down the line.

Same Old Lame Excuse 7 ‘T
I suppose that every mining company in the industry in 1893 l ’ 
though that $2.50 for a nine-hour day was “adequate and competi- ,.
tive.” And had the unions accepted this kind of argument, we'd i A
still be back in the days of the horsecars. . ' ‘

‘k

* .

* .
ENNECOTT’S comments on some of the union’s job security
demands are worth quoting——“unrealistic, impractical, and

would result in excessive administrative costs.”

Wasn’t this the same answer the companies gave us when we
proposed pensions, health and welfare insurance coverage, paid

holidays, and practically every other improvement in our con-.

tracts?

Let's Get Serious
Perhaps the words “adequate and competitive” and “unreal-
istic and impractical” are good enough for marking time. They 
certainly won’t settle any agreements. ' 

. Every circumstance demands that the companies sit down and
talk turkey. Profits are up, the metal market is in the best state
of health in years, our economy is booming,’ productivity per
worker is up and continuing to go higher.

.' . * . * * . ’
UR rank and file is not-impressed with words and has a
tendency to get impatient with stalling. They see no point to

it. Someone once called our union a “meat and potato union,” and s
so it is. And meat and potatoes in 1964 means not only money in ;» 
the form of wages, but also job security, completely paid. health  I

and welfare, extended vacations, and a whole variety of contract {Iii
proposals that will make the job more secure and endurable. ' I ‘

Steel Raids F izzl e 

(Continued from Page 1)
Mining Company’s underground
mine in Heber City, Utah, are
inconclusive as the Union goes
to press. Three challenged votes
hold the key to whether or not
Mine-Mill will be in a run-off.
Mine-Mill had 52 votes, Steel
had 10, and 64 workers voted
“no union” at the-now unorgan-
ized property.

Not Enough Cards
The Steelworkers petition in

Butte, which Mine-Mill all along .

maintained was invalid because
of a lack of sufficient number of
cards, was withdrawn on May
1_8——immediately _after the Great
Falls election.

Not only did Steel fail to make
any dents in the above proper-
ties, but, in general, the margin
of defeat was greater than in

. previous years. In Great Falls,

for example, the 212-vote ma-
jority for Mine-Mill compared to
a vote of 476 to 460 two years
ago.
Who's Being Buried?
Back in October, Mine-Mill
clobbered Steel’s attempt to take
over the AS&R Page and Ga-
lena mines in Idaho’s Coeur
d’Alene district by a better than
two to one vote, but this did not
prevent McDonald from brashly
claiming in Tucson in February
that Steel would “bury” Mine-
Mill this year. v
Since that time, Steel won one
raid—by a 138 to 100 vote at the

THE MINE-MILL UNION

' Melly-June. ‘I964

  

    INDUSTRY NOTES   

THE AMERICAN SMELTING AND REFINING COMPANY is
making long-range plans to assure adequate supplies of copper
concentrates for its smelter in Tacoma, Wash. According to the
Wall Street Journal, the company has agreed to put up $10 million
of $50 million required to finance a new copper mine in British
Columbia, just south of the Alaska panhandle. The new mine,
owned by Granduc Mines Ltd., which is 54.9 percent owned by the
Newmont Mining Corporation, will need a 30-mile access road,
10 miles of which will cut through a tunnel in the mountain between
mine and tidewater. Newmont Mining says that the mine, when in
operation, will produce 44,000 tons of copper in concentrates per

_year. Construction of the road and mill will take an estimated 42

months from the date of authorization of the project.
* tit .=l<

ANOTHER NEWMONT PROJECT slated to begin production
next year is a $5.8 million open pit gold mine about-40 miles

. northwest of Elko, Nevada. Mining observers figure the property ‘

already has an indicated reserve of 5% million tons of ore.
Ii: Ill >l=

KENNECOTT bought out American Smelting & Refining Com-
pany’s 50 percent interest in Garfield Chemical and Manufacturing
Co. near Magna, Utah, in April, giving Kennecott sole ownership.
Garfield Chemical produces 1,000 tons of sulfuric acid per day
from smelter slag and gases from Kennecott’s Garfield plants.

It was built during World War I. Garfield’s biggest customer has
' been Western Phosphates, Inc., two miles away, controlled by
' f Stauffer Chemical Co. Prior to Kennecott’s take-over at Garfield,
Stauffer had bought out minority interests of Kennecott and AS&R

in Western Phosphates.

HARRISON-WALKER Refractories Company’s net profits for
the first three months of 1964 hit $2,236,433—-45 percent more than
for the January-March quarter in 1963. Harbison-Walker’s plant
at Bessemer, Alabama, is under contract with Mine-Mill Local 531;
its Fairfield, Alabama plant with Mine-Mill Local 553. A company
spokesman said, “Incoming orders in April have been higher than
in any previous month this year. Modest price adjustments up-
ward, effective April 1, should help second quarter financial re-

sults.”

’ CERRO CORPORATION, U.S. copper fabricator, owner of the
Cerro de Pasco lead-zinc mine in Peru and part owner in Southern

-Peru Copper Company, has purchased the Stamford (Conn.) Roll-

ing Mills from Howe Sound Company, for an undisclosed cash
payment. Stamford Rolling Mills is under contract with Mine-Mill
Local 552. Cerro is believed to have purchased Stamford in order

. to expand its product line and more fully utilize its copper produc-

tion. The Stamford mill has an annual capacity of 50 million
pounds of mill products “and can be expanded if necessary,”
according to a statement by Cerro President Robert P. Koenig

- at a recent annual stockholders meeting. Cerro’s net‘ profits for

the first three months of 1964. were $5,034,980, nearly three times
as much as the $1,777,793 net profits racked up in the first three
months of 1963. -

-BAGDAD COPPER CORPORATION, small copper producer

I that Bagdad, Arizona, says it will announce by the end of the year

whether or not it will undertake construction of a plant to produce
copper powder to be used in an adjoining tube mill tomake pipe

— and tube. Production of powder direct from concentrates would

bypass the conventional smelting and electrolytic refining
processes. Commenting on the higher profits resulting from higher
prices, a company spokesman said, “A penny rise in the price
of copper is worth about 40 cents a share to us in after-tax earn-

,ings.”_,

CIIILE’S CONGRESS has put another bite on Kennecott and
Anaconda operations in that country. It passed, and President
Alessandri is expected to sign, a bill that would:

1) Tax all exports of copper two cents per pound effective

July 1,‘ 1965, except for electrolytic or fire-refined copper. The tax

is designed to encourage the U.S. companies to refine more or

all of their Chilean mine production in Chile;

2) Require copper exporting companies to absorb import

.duties levied by other countries on copper, chiefly the U.S. whose

duty is 1.7 cents per pound. Previously these duties, when paid,
were written off as a cost and lowered the amount on which Chile

' levied income taxes.

4 RUSSIA last month withdrew from the European-market for
lead and zinc, which she had been selling on the London Metal
Exchange for the last three or four years. While‘no reason was
given by the USSR for halting of exports, trade observers specu-
lated that Russian industries might now be in need of all that
the‘ country could produce. The Russian action tightened the
supplies of both metals in Europe, with the result that zinc prices
in Lond_on rose to an 11-year high.

THE PRICE OF ANTIMONY, under pressure for months,
wasraised 3.5 cents per pound to 39 cents by the National Lead
Company late in April. This is 10 cents higher than the 1960 price.
National Lead’s net profit for first three months of 1964 was
$12,425,835, up 11 percent above the same period in 1963.

HISTORIC LEADVILLE, Colorado, keeps hoping for a revival
of lead-zinc mining, which has been shut down for years in the

* area. The Leadville-Lake County Economic Development Council
._quotes- a U.S. Interior Department report as saying that three
 ‘million. tons of lead-zinc ore, averaging more than 15 percent
f metal, are available- in the district, awaiting only the construction
Vofa drainage tunnel to dewater the area. The council proposes

the building of a new type of smelter which smelts mixed lead-zinc

 concentrates and yields slab zinc and lead bullion at the same
 time. _The new_ type, named the imperial smelter, after British
~- ‘-.I_l31l‘Jer1,ai_l Smelting Company which developed it, first went into
 "production in 1950. Three are now operating in England, one each
3 .iin;,Australia, Rhodesia and France, and two others are being built

_ 1‘-Poland’ and Rumania. Leadville’s problem is to find investors
tofinance the tunnel and smelter and pay royalties to’ Imperial

capacity of the electrolytic refinery at 103,000 tons of copper. Smelter capacity is rated -

’at 600,000 tons of concentrates. Local 25 was chartered on August 7, 1933.

General Motors Corporation led the profit parade of American industry for the first three months
of 1964, with the highest quarterly profits in its history. Net ‘profits for the J anuary-March quarter
were $536,331,704-—up 29 percent from the first quarter of 1963. Booming auto sales were behind the
upsurge.

There are two newcomers in the above list-—Cerro Corporation, which has acquired the Stamford
Rolling Mills, and Shattuck-Denn, operator of the Iron King mine where Mine-Mill recently took bar-
gaining rights away from Steel. -

The predominantly lead-zinc producers, Cerro, American Zinc, and New Jersey Zinc, show the
most spectacular profit increases because of sharp jumps in the prices of both metals over the past
year. .

The one-cent price increase in copper came too late in the first quarter of 1964 to be reflected in
profit figures of copper producers for the quarter. The profit increases there reflect mainly increased

production and sales. Anaconda says its profits would have been higher except for a seven—week strike

at the El Salvador mine in Chile and for short work stoppages in Montana.

One needn’t feel sorry for Inspiration and Magma, which reported less profit in the first quar-
ter this year than last. Magma in the first quarter this year held almost 9 million pounds of copper
off the market, because, it said, of the “need to restore inventories to more normal levels.” What
this means actually is that Magma was holding copper off the market waiting for another price in-
crease. If -it had sold this copper, its eprofitswould have‘ been way above 1963’s first quarter. Inspira-
tion manages to show a. decline by a bookkeeping trick. It -charges off’ heavy. development, expenses

Accidents in Montana and Idaho lake Six Lives

Jack Erickson, 19, of the Philipsburg Mine and Millmen’s Union Local 24, was killed in a 25-foot_
fall into an ore bunker on the surface at the Montana Phosphate Products Company’s Douglas
mine near Hall, Montana about midnight on April 10. The bunker and trestle leading to it had been
completed four days prior to the accident, and handrails, temporary lights, a bulkhead, and a rail
stop had been installed. However, frizzly rails had not been installed at the or_e dump.

Operating a locomotive pulling a string of three loaded cars, Erickson for unknown reasons
stepped down from the locomotive while the train was stopped. In the absence of the grizzly rails,
he fell to his death. The accident was investigated by the United States Bureau of Mines. Grizzly
rails have since been installed at the scene of the accident.

Erickson is survived by his
parents and four brothers and
sisters. .

More Fatal Accidents

Two miners were killed by a
rockburst April 15 at the Star
Mine in Idaho’s Coeur d’Alene

district. The mine is 70 percent .

owned by Bunker Hill Company
and 30 percent by Hecla Min-
ing Company, which operates
it. The two miners were work-
ing in a stope at the 6900 level
when a 30-foot wall area caved
as the burst came out of the
wall. The blast splintered tim-
bers and lagging’ which had
been installed in the stope. Lo-

 cal geologists say that rock

bursts may become more fre-
quent in the Coeur d’A1enes as
mines in the district go deeper
and deeper and rtm into greater
pressure of the earth.

Three accidental deaths oc-

curred recently at the Anaconda
Company’s operations in Butte,
Mont. within a period of less
than three weeks. Ralph H.
Clawson was caught in a mov-
ing belt at the concentrator on
April .18; William Leddra was
struck in the chest by a heavy
steel gate at the Berkeley pit
mine on May 2; and John P.
_ Quinn fell off a landing at the
concrete batch plant on May 6.
The Anaconda ‘Company did not
request investigations of these
accidents by the U. S. Bureau
of Mines, and the Bureau now

- -lacks the authority to make

such investigations without com-
pany agreement. Investigative
authority ended last September
with the expiration of the tem-
porary two-year Mine Safety

,  {Study Act of 1961.

Lung Cancer Studies

Two studies of lung cancer in
underground uranium miners
have appeared receIitly.'_ ‘One,
published by the U. S. Public
Health Service, is based on a
12-year study of over 5,000‘em-
ployees at uranium mills and
surface and underground mines
in the Colorado Plateau area
(parts of Colorado,'Utah, New
Mexico, and Arizona). The PHS
study found that deaths from
lung cancer among miners with

,.:;,g,'§ve years service in under-

ground uranium mining were
more than 10 times as frequent
as might be expected in such a
group. The report said, “It . . .
appears likely that the cumu-
lative dose of airborne radia-
tion contained within these
mines was responsible for the
excess of respiratory cancer
and possibly contributed to the
excess of non-malignant respira-
tory diseases.”

No excessive incidence of lung
cancer was encountered. among
employees with less than five
years underground, or among
employees in uranium mills" or
open pit mines. .

The New Mexico State Health
Department reports that over a

., two year period ending June 30,,-

   

 

1963, 2,526 uranium miners were
examined at the Grants, N. M.
clinic, and that no «cases of lung
cancer were turned up during
the survey.

The differing conclusions of

the two reports may not be in-
consistent. .Some mining around
Grants is open pit, while the
underground mines in the area,
according to the Udall report on
Health and Safety in Metal and
Nonmetal Mines, are better
ventilated and have consider-
ably .lower concentrations of
radon gas than the smaller
mines in Colorado, Utah and
Arizona. Constant monitoring of
air in the New Mexico mines is
being maintained. _
Compensation Claims
Accurate data on workmen’s
compensation claims for dis-
ability or death fromlung can-
cer are hard to come by, but
press reports have disclosed
recently the first such death
enefit claim has been filed in
tah on behalf of the widow
and children of Douglas G.
Garner, who-had been employed
at the Hecla Mining Company’s
uranium mine in the Big Indian
district. The State Industrial
Commission plans a lengthy
hearing and investigation before
ruling on the claim. '
Three death benefit claims

also have been filedrecently in .

Colorado on behalf ofsurvivors
of three uranium miners who
died from lung cancer. Tight-
lipped Colorado Industrial Com-
mission aides, questioned by the
Mine-Mill Union, admitted that
other claims had been pre-
viously filed based on lung
cancer -among uranium miners.
They declined, however, to state
whether or not benefits had
been awarded.

. Zinc Poisoning

Don’t serve food or drinks
from zinc-coated tubs or pails.

This is the message of an ar- 6

ticle in ‘a recent issue of
A r c h i v e s of Environmental

Health. The report says that 1

galvanized tubs borrowed from
a Moslem temple in Sacramento
were the cause _of several epi-
sodes of food poisoning due to
contamination with zinc. On a
recent occasion, 300 to'500 Sikhs,
natives of India or of Sikh
parentage, were poisoned at a

celebration of an Indian holi-

day. A previous massaom New Philipsburg contract Provides
  l5 cents an Hour Wage Increase  

ing had not been reported to
health ‘authorities because mem-
bers of one Sikh faction thought
another faction was trying to
poison them. '

Barred from U.S. Contracts

A little used penalty provi-
sion in the federal Walsh-Healy
Act has been invoked recently

lations of federal health and

safety standards which apply to
companies selling to Uncle Sam.

Under the blacklist, the com-,

pany would be barred from
gaining government contracts
for a period of three years.
