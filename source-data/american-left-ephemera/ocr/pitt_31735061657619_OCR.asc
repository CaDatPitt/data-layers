pardons or to extend executive clemency where fundamental justice

iequires it. That is not overthrowing the law-—that is provided by
aw.

  

Since the processes of the law have obviously failed, in
this case, to achieve justice, we must arouse sufficient enlightened
opinion to compel mercy. We must get at the facts, so as to formulate
our own opinions, and help others to formulate theirs. We must
overcome the hostile attitude of the press and of the commentators,
not one-tenth of one per cent, of whom have read the record. I
challenge them to prove to the contrary. Their attitude is based
purely on hearsay, generalities and the current hysteria.

When a friend opposes mercy for the Rosenbergs or vigorously

proclaims that "they deserve electrocution", ask him calmly whether

he has read the record. His almost inevitable answer will be, "I
know only what I have read in the papers." However, if he claims to
have read the redord, ask him a few uestions alon the lines of our
discussion here; you will soon find ghat he has no% read it. After
all, why should Winchell, or Pegler, or McCarthy~F§ad the record of
2700 pages when he can better satisfy his readers by stentorian
bombastic demands for the execution of the "Communist traitors".

To read the record is painstaking work; you can write twenty editorials
or make twenty speeches while someone else is studying the record once.

I challenge any person to read the record from cover to
cover and then meet me in a discussion of executive clemency--on this
or any other platform. No! I withdraw the challenge; I assure you
that any intelligent person who reads and considers the record, and
thinks about it, will arrive at the same conclusion as you and I
entertain. I have enough confidence in the sense of fairness of my
fellow Americans to beleive that once the truth is placed before them
they will recognize it and act on it. The all-important fact is to
get that truth to them, as it appears in the cold record, devoid of
embroidery and free of the approach of fear or hysteria. Let us look
at the record:

First, the Rosenbergs and Sobell were ggt tried for treason,

The federal Constitution requires that treason be proven by the
testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act. Since no one-~not a
single person—-testified that the Rosenbergs gave any secrets to an
representative of 331 foreign power, the charge of—tFeason was ou of
the question. .

 

The defendants were indicted under a fairly recent statute;
the indictment on which they were tried (filed January 51, 1951)
charged that Julius Rosenberg, Ethel Rosenberg, Anatoli A. Yakolev,
David Greenglass and Morton Sobell conspired with each other and with
Ruth Greenglass (wife of David Greenglass) and Harry Gold to communi-
cate, deliver and transmit to the Union of Soviet Republics, documents,
writings, sketches, notes and information relative to the national
defense of the U.S., with intent and reason to believe that it would
be used to the advantage of a foreign nation.

Two things are striking about this indictment:

(a) The list of the overt acts which the defendants are
alleged to have committed--which list the U.S. attorney was ardered
to file--related twelve acts--ll of them innocuous to say the least——
_all of which were laid between June 6, 1944, and January 14, l945—-
over six years before the indictment and charged at a time when Russia
was our ally-- at least not our adversary in the present cold war;

(b) Although the indictment expressly names seven conspira-
tors, only five of them are indicted; Mrs, Greenglass and Harry Gold
are not indicted although they are named as co-conspirators. The
evidence attempts to establish that the Greenglasses, David and Ruth,
had created and then had handed certain sketches and plans of the atom
bomb to the Rosenbergs. Why are not the givers of this secret at
least as quilty as the recipients? Why is Mrs. Greenglass less—§uilty
than Mrs. Rosenberg? Why does Mrs. Greenglass escape indictment while
hrs. Rosenberg faces the chair? What is there about this that even
remotely resembles fairness, or law or justice?

And why is Harry Gold not indicted, an admitted spy, who is
now serving a 50~year sentence for espionage, inflicted upon him by a
Philadelphia court, a man who will, in a few years be asking the
government for a parole?

It is but too obvious why Mrs. Greenglass was not indicted.

That was obviously part of the price paid by the United States attorney
for the favorable testimony of Ruth Greenglass and David Greenglass
against the Rosenbergs, the other part of that price being the 15-year
.sentence imposed upon him after he had testified against the Rosenbergs.
No fair-minded person can doubt but that their testimony was thus
purchased.

But there is an even more weighty and, in my opinion more
unworthy, reason for the action of the United States attorney. Why
did he name Ruth Greenglass and Harry Geld as co-conspirators when he \
knew he was not going to have them indicted? Why did he also name ;
Anatoli Yakovlev, a former Russian consular attache, as a co-
conspirator when he knew, or must have known, that Yakovlev had been
allowed to depart this country several years ago, and could not
possibly be tried in this or any other case? I will tell you why he
pursued that course of action; I wish he were here to attempt to
justify it.

Please follow me closely. There is a well—accepted rule of
law that once there has been proof of a conspiracy among several
defendants to do an unlawful act, thereafter anything said or done by
any one of the alleged conspirators may be introduced in evidence
against any and all of the other alleged conspirators; that may be a
rule of law born of necessity, but it was in this case utilized by the
United States attorney in an especially unjust manner. He had the
Greenglasses testify to a conspiracy among the defendants, and
thereafter anything that any of the co-conspirators said to the other
was binding on the Rosenbergs even though they were not present, had
not participated in the conversation, and were not placed at the scene
of the alleg ed conversation. Thus, Greenglass was permitted to
testify as to what he said to Ruth Greenglass and she was permitted
to testify as to what she had said to him, all in the absence of the
R osenbergs. How could the Rosenbergs possibly meet that evidence;
how could they disprove, or even attempt or prepare to disprove,
conversations or acts outside of their presence or knowledge?

And in like fashion, Greenglass was permitted to testify
what he said to and did with Harry Gold, and Harry Gold was permitted
to testify as to what he said to and did with with Greenglass, in Los
Alamos, New Mexico, 2500 miles away from the Rosenbergs, who have never
been there. And Harry Gold admittedly neither knew, nor had ever met,
nor had ever spoken with, nor had ever communicated with the Rosenbergs.
And the grand climax of this manner of paving the way for the
defendants to the electric chair came when Harry Gold was allowed to
testify, at great length, as to the details of his conspiracy with
Anton Yakovlev, the missing consular agent, even leading to the actions
and words of the leader of the conspiracy established by the English
Courts, Dr. Klaus Fuchs. In decency, in fairness, how could the
Rosenbergs disprove the charges of men they never knew, whom no one
ever placed in association with them, who were not here to t ell
their own side of the stories told by Gold and Greenglass, Obviously
under the circumstances, Harry Gold was free to say anything he wished
about the words and acts of Yakovlev, and bring his actions before this
Jury--to the immense prejudice of the Rosenbergs. He certainly did
S0--he had a Roman holida, which he appeared to enjoy immensly. Yes
the law permitted him to do so because Greenglass had involved Yakovlev
and Rosenberg in the conspiracy, even though neither had ever met the
other--a Sinister door was thus opened to the passageway which inevit-
ably led to the conviction of the defendants, and may lead to their
execution,

Not satisfied with the foregoing, the United States attorney,
in his very opening statement (p. 182) introduced the charge that the

that it was to Communism. Communism in this country and Communism

loyalty and allegiance of the defendants "were not to our country, but ﬁt

throughout this world", and referred to them as "traitorous Americans"
(P. 182), guilty of "traitorous activities" and "trcasonable acts".

Remember, please that none of the defendants had been indicted on
the charge of treason.

When the defendants objected to the introduction of the
element of Communism, upon the ground that the defendants were not
on trial for being Communists, the trial judge held that that inu1;ry
was proper as going to the motive of the defendants to commit the
acts charged against them; the United Circuit Court of Appeals hold
that he was correct in that ruling. The trial judge went on to
caution the jurors that they. were "not to determine the guilt or
innocence of a defendant on whether or not he is a Communist". I
submit that such a performance by a trial judge may be legally sound

_but in the long run is one of those amiable hypocrisies of the law.

It represents one of those rules which the law feels necessary but
which the seeker for justice finds practical rather than just. In
these days, repeatedly to call a defendant in a criminal case a
Communist and then expect him to get a fair trial before a jury
simply because the trial judge directs the jury to disregard that
charge is naive, if not directly insincere. The warning to the
jury to disregard a particular charge is, as stated by no less a
personage that Mr. Justice Jackson of the Supreme Court, in
Krulewiteh v. United States, 536 U.S. 440, (l.l650) but "an empty
ritual without any practical effect on the jurors". It is largely
on the basis of such repeated "empty rituals" that the defendants
now face the chair.

The trial proceeded in the atmosphere generated by those

"charges and by the evident conviction of the trial judge that the

defendants were guilty, a conviction which he did little to conceal
from the jury. I have made notations, in the record, of over a
hundred points at which the trial judge aided the government and
its witnesses or showed hostility to the defendants or their
counsel, or minimized their evidence.

The court's attitude toward counsel was well shown by such
observations as the following: (p..202)

"Let me ask you mils, Mr. Phillips: Have you tried any
criminal cases? I know your specialty is in the real
estate field."

Or this choice bit, before the jury (p.808):

"Mr. Kuntz: May I finish my argument?
The Court: Mr. Kuntz, no, you may not. It is a lot of
gibberish.

******=l<>|<*******>F************

Mr. Kuntz: "May I--" V

The Court: "No, the Court put that question, Mr..Kuntz,

and den't give me any course of instruction as to what

is usually done in a courtroom. This is the way I am
running this courtroom, Mr. Kuntz, and I think I understand
the way a courtroom should be run. I don't care to hear
anything further from you. Your objectien is noted."

It does not take a veteran trial lawyer to understand what
this sort of an attitude on the part of the presiding judge does to
the attitude of the lawyer thus humiliated.

But it was in the field of the examination of the witnesses
that the attitude of the trial judge was most marked. I shall give
you but two examples, bearing in mind the fact that in a federal
case the trial judge is allowed to comment upon the evidence.

The first example:

One of the main problems of the defense was to give the
jury a reasonable explanation as to why David Greenglass testified
against his own sister, Mrs. Rosenberg. I am sure that when he
started out on his testimony he did not expect her to be sent to
the chair. I am also sure that he was perfectly willing to testify
against her in order to save his own skin, his own guilt having been
Clearly established long before he even mentioned the names of the

Rosenbergs. But counsel for the defendants also dwelt upon the
further fact ﬁiat Greenglass and Rosenberg had gone into business
after the war, had lost money and had had many quarrels as a result
thereof. To emphasize this logical argument, counsel for the
defendants asked Greenglass whether he remembered an incident when

Greehg1ass' brother Bernie had to separate them (p.665) The record
then proceeds:

Q. Did you hit Julius?

A. I--I don't recall if I actually hit him.

The Court: Do you r emsmber what occasioned that?

A. I Don't recall what—- it was some violent quarrel over
S0m0thing in the b'ClS1n33‘3ooooooo

The Court: Subsequent to that, had you patched things up?
A. Certainly. We were very friendly after that." And thus
in the middle of the cross-examination, and without

waiting until counsel had concluded it, the Court rushes to
the rescue of the witness Greenglass, and by a clearly
leading question virtually destroys an important theory of
defense. How did the Court know that they had patched it up?

Why was a fair judge justified in helping Greenglass in his
dilemma, even before he had concluded his testimony?

The second example of the trial judge's attitude: Ruth
Greenglass was testifying (and this was in 1951) as to the conversation
which she claimed to have had with Julius Rosenberg in New York, over
six years prior to that time, namely, in November, 1944 (p. 678); her
recital of that conversation covers about 35 lines; it employes such
phrases as "dangercus radiation effects", that "the atomic bomb was

the most destructive weapon used so far", etc.; phrases which a house .'

wife could hardly be expected to store away in her memory for

over six years; counsel for the defendants a ttmepted to show that she
had been coached to say this and had simply memorized those phrases,

by having her repeat this conversation on cross-examination. She
repeated it in almost the same language as on direct, phrases and all,
thus making it rather clear to tho disinterested mind that she was, in
fact, merely repeating what she had been instructed to memorize; that

a person is able to remember the words of a conversation which

occured six years ago is rather remarkable; that she can repeat those
words so well that she repeats them again on cross-examination, when
the conversation covers 35 lines in a record, is hardly believable
unless we assume that she had read these words just before the trial
and had memorized them. Counsel for the defendants ¢alLed Mrs.
Greenglass' attention to the fact that her verbiage on cross-examinatio:
was almost identical with that used by her on direct. The U.S.
attorney objected. The trial judge: (p.728): "If the witness had

left out something, Mr. Bloch would say that the witness didn't

repeat the story accurately. And the witness repeats it accurately,
and apparently that isn't any good." Was that comment on the evidence,
or was it an out-and-out partisan attempt by the trial judge to

destroy the defendants‘ position as to this testimony?

But the most striking evidence of the trial judge's

attitude came at the conclusion of the case and at the pronouncement
of the sentences. Every lawyer will tell you that in 95% if not 98%
of federal criminal cases the trial judge asks for the recommendation
of the United States attorney as to the sentence to be imposed after
the jury has found the defendant guilty. In this case however, the
trial judge asked for no such recommendation. Why? His statement
was (p.l6l2) that "the responsibility is so great that I believe

that the Court alone should assume this responsibility". Which is,

of course, one explanation. Two others are equally valid: (a) Did
the trial judge fear that the United States attorney would Egg
recommend the death sentence and thus make it practically impossible
or extremely difficult, for the judge to impose it? (b) Did he desire
for himself the assumed glory of imposing a death sentence upon
members of his own racial group and thereby demonstrating that

he could be a firm and severe and unrelenting judge even as against
them? Was this not a classic instance of a judge's leaning backward,
a most unfortunate performance in a federal judge, in a capital case.

As stated in the opinion of the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals, which affirmed the conviction (except for Judge Frank's
dissent as to Morton Sobell), "the government's chief witnesses were
all self—confessed spies" (p. 1648}. They were, Harry Gold, who did
not even know the Rosenbergs; Max Elitcher, who admitted that he
feared a7five~year sentence for perjury; he had sworn falsely, in an
application for a position, that he was not a Communist, but has
never been tried for that offense; and the two Greenglasses.

The courts of all American jurisdictions (as distinguished
from those of the totalitarian states) have always held that the
testimony+of self»confessed accomplices must be accepted with great
caution, since they have every incentive to gain the consideration
of the government, its favorable recommendation as to a sentence, and
the leniency of the trial court by testimony favorable to the govern-
ment. In plain words, they are "out to save ﬂieir skins" by helping
the government. To make sure that David Greenglass would proceed to
"save his own skin", the United States attorney did Egg ask that
sentence be imposed upon him, upon his plea of guilty, until after
he had given testimony against the Rosenbergs. That he had well and
accurately played the game of "saving your own skin" is best illustrated
by the fact that he received a sentence of fifteen years, and his
wife was not even indicted.

The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals refers to the
undeniable fact (p. 1648) that if the testimony of the Greenglasses
"were disregarded, the conviction could not stand".

Let us examine the most cogent portion of the testimony of
David Greenglass, and see how credible is that testimony without
which "the conviction could not stand".

David Greenglass was a young machinist, with a high school
education, with a record of having failed in every one of the 8
post-high-school technical courses which he pursued at Brooklyn
Polytechnic Institute (p. 610); he was finally drafted, and was

assigned to the buildings of the Atomic Project at Los Alamos,

New Mexico. He had never studied calculus, either differential or
advanced, nor nuclear physics, nor atomic physics, nor any of the
higher scientific subjects, (p. 612), nor had he read any basic
works on any of those subjects (p.615). He nevertheless testified
that he was able, entirely from memory, and without having removed
any notes or sketches from Los Alamos, to prepare a sketch of the
atom bomb itself. Truly the genius:

He did not testify that either of the Rosenbergs ever came
out to see him, or even wrote to him, at Los Alamos. *

Greenglass testified that his wife, Ruth,came out to see
him at Los Alamos, New Mexico, November 29, 1944, and there related
to him a conversation she claimed to have had with Julius Rosenberg
back in New York; this conversation between the two Greenglasses was
in the absence of either of the Rosenbergs, and their counsel
objected thereto; the trial judge overruled the objection on the
ground that Ruth Greenglass "is named as one co-conspirator" (p.399);
from that point on, of course,David Grcenglass was free to put into
R uth's mouth any words he wished as having originated with the
Rosenbergs, and Ruth, in like fashion, was free to testify to
anything she wished as having been told by the Rosenbergs to her.
Please remember that neither of the Greenglasses ever stated that
there was s single third person present at any of these conversations
which they claim to have occurred between them and the Rosenbergs,
nor did they produce any withe ss as to any conversation between
themselves. It all stood, baldly and boldly, upon the unsupported
words of the Greenglasses. All that the Rosenbergs could do was to
deny the alleged conversations, which they did, unequivocally. They
are still denying them. '

At that November, l944, conversation at LosAlamos, Ruth is
supposed to have told David that the Rosenbergs, back in New York,
had told her that Julius was now giving information to Russia, that
they knew that David was working on the atomic bomb project and that
they wanted David to give information to the Russians (p.424). He
said that at first he was "frightened and worried about it"(p. 425)

and said he would not do it, but thought it over during the night and
the next day told his wife he would do it(p.425); he was then 22
years of age (p.539); he had not talked about it with the Rosenbergs
nor with anyone else but had "consulted with memories and voices in
my mind"(5B9). When I came to that silly answer I had to read the
record twice to make sure I had made no mistake. No one asked him
what memories or what voices or what mind he had consulted. He
admitted that he knew that what he was agreeing to do constituted a
"very serious crime" (p.559).

There is much more of similar testimony of the Greenglasses
as to alleged conversations between themselves and between them and
the Rosenbergs. But the climax of the David Greenglass testimony was
the following: .

He testified that Rosenberg had come to see him in his
apartment in New York upon his return there in September, 1945
(p.490) and had asked him what he, Greenglass, had for him,
and that Greenglass had replied'that he had a "pretty good
description of the atom bomb"; 2-at Rosenberg said he would
like to have it immediately (p. 46), and would like to have
Greenglass write it up and bring it over to his house; he
further testified that Rosenberg then and there gave him
$200. (p.496): surely a princely price for the greatest
scientific discovery in the world's history!

He then testified (p. 497) that after Rosenberg had left
he and his wife, late in the morning, had brunch, and then returned
to the apartment and "I wrote out all the information and drew up
some sketches and descriptive material", including "a sketch of the
bomb itself" and "descriptive material to explain the sketch of the
atom bomb", and some scientists’ names and some possible recruits
for espionage. He claimed that all these matters took "about 12
pages or so", and that the work was completed by about 2 o'clock in
the afternoon, when he took it over to Rosenberg.

Since neither the F.B.I; nor any one else ever found any
such sketches or descriptive material, the government was unable to
produce them, and the witness was therefore allowed to produce what
he claimed to be a replica of the 12 pages he had given to Rosenberg
back in September, 1945, which copy he had prepared, from memory, a
few days before the trial. In other words, the original sketches were
prepared by him in September, 1945, from memory; he extended that
memory by 5 years and 4 months longer-—to the time fo the trial--
and was able at the time fo the trial in January, l95l, to make, so.
heelaimed, a replica of this highly technical data, which he had last
seen,at Los Alamos approximately six years before, in 1944 or 1945.

As to.the foregoing testimony, which goes to the very
essence of the case, and without which, as the Circuit Court of
Appeals says, "the conviction could not stand", only the following

need be said:

(1) That Greenglass could glean enough information from
overhearing conversations of scientists and memorizing
portions of drawings to compile the whole into a finished
sketch of the bomb is incredible;

(2) That a 23 year-old machinist, with a high-school
education and no completed scientific training, could do
this, and could do it from memory, is beyond belief; I think
it is no exaggeration that the world's leading scientists

would not attempt it;

(8) That he, or any other human being, could compress the
sketches of the atom bomb, with descriptive material, within
12 pages, seems utterly impossible; the sketches for the
least complicated of new machines are more elaborate;
scientists who have been questioned about it, say that it
would cover several printed books;

(4) That he could again do it from memory, in preparation
for the trial, after a further lapse of over five years, is
incredible;

(5) That he would sell the world's most important scientific
secret to his brother-in-law for transmission to the Russians
for $200, is a bald lie. «

The Los Alamos project was surrounded with the utmost in
security measures. Billions were being spent on the atomic bomb
project. Presumably Russia and perhaps other countries would have
been willing to pay millions for the secret, if it was a secret.

If anyone surreptitiously secured that secret, his identity should be
established among persons on the top level, and his compensation
would doubtless be in proportion to the value of the secret. No
higher-ups have been unearthed by the F.B.I. To say that the secret
could be appropriated by a lowly machinist sergeant and thereafter
sold for $200, is to introduce a Gilbert & Sullivan note. It is so
obviously a lie that no jury—-except it be moved by fear and hatred
of the Communists, or impelled by hysteria, could possibly give it
credence.

But the trial judge said, and people have said, that the

yguilt of the Resenbergs is no less even though they did not got a
true sketch of the bomb. That is beside the point. The Rosenbergs
deny steadfastly that they asked for or received or ever saw a
sketch or material for the atom bomb; the Greenglasses say that they
did deliver it to them; there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict
in their testimony. It therefore become the function of the jury to
determine which story was the more plausible; I calmly submit that
the story of David Greenglass is so implausible, so obviously a lie,
so full of lies, that it should be entirely disregarded, as wholly
unworthy of belief, and that the denial of the Rosenbergs that they
got any sketch of the atom bomb, good,bad or indifferent, should be
accepted. And if the testimony of Greenglass be disregarded, "the
conviction cannot stand,"in the language of the Circuit Court of
Appeals.

The government was unable to produce a scrap of paper
traceable to the Rosenbergs, not a document, not a bit of physical
evidence other than a petition signed by Mrs. Rosenberg for a
successful Communist candidate for the New York City Council
(joined in by about 50,000 other American citizens) and a tin can
used for the collection of funds for Spanish refugee children. It
did not establish the possession of any moneys by the Rosenbergs.
It did not produce, although David Greenglass testified, that his
sister had told him that she had received a wrist watch from the
R ussians and also testified that the Rosenbergs had received from
them a console table with a compartment for the use of microfilm.
As Dr. Urey has well asked, "are spies paid in wrist watches and
console tables from Macy's for $21." They introduced evidence that
the records of Macy's relating to cash transactions and deliveries
in the year when the console table was purchased have been destroyed.
I understand that since the trial evidence has been unearthed, at
great effort and considerable expense, to prove that the console
table in the Rosenberg home had in fact been a very simple table,
purchased from Macy's for about Q21.

Another witness presented in connection with the Communist
picturization of the case was our old friend, the ubiquitous Elizabeth
Bentley. Since she has made a career of professing to be areformed

Communist, and has made a living off writing books, presenting
lectures, and testifying in practically every case and every
Congressional hearing involving Communism, directly or indirectly, it
was to be expected that sooner or later the charming Elizabeth would
appear here, too. She was subpoenaed from a hard-earned vacation in
Puerto Rice, for the ostensible purpose of establishing the relation-
ship between the Communist Party of the United States and the
Communist International. She was allowed, however, to give an
extensive history of what she characterized her activities as a
secret courier among many named and unnamed alleged Communists, which
testimony consisted of many generalities, much hearsay, etc. The testi-
mony certainly was calculated to give the jury a picture of very
widely-spread and sinister activities of the Communists in this
country. That it was very prejudicial to the defendants, in the

eyes of the jury, cannot be doubted, even though she did not profess
even to know the Rosenbergs. Her activities centered largely around

one Jacob Nathan Golos (p.999), referred to by the United States
attorney as "Mr." Golos, whom she characterized as a Communist and
her sweetheart. (p.lOOO). She ran little risk in relating her
supposed Communistic activities with "Mr." Golos, since he had been
dead since November 25, 1945 (p.974).

Her only reference to the Rosenbergs was that shortly after
she had visited the neighborhood of Knickerbocker Village with "Mr."
Golos, in which neighborhood the Rosenbergs had a modest flat, she
received a telephone call from a man whom she could not identify, by
recognition of voice or otherwise, but who introduced himself simply
as "Julius" (p.991). From the fall of 1942 to about November 1943
she had about five or six such conversations, and dramatically enough‘
they "glways came after midnight, in the wee small_hours¥ (p.lOO5)
and he always started with the phrase, "This is Julius" (p.lOO4),

She claims to have transmitted these messages to "Mr." Golos. What
the messages were, was not established. Rosenberg denied knowing her
or ever talking to her. would a key spy introduce himself to a
person ever the telephone, by stating correctly even his first name?
If that was a pre-arranged code, why not "James", or "John" or
"Stephen", rather than the caller's true name? I leave to you the
credibility of this testimony of this professional witness.

Well, you ask me-—and your friends ask you--if this case was
so patently full of holes, why did not the Circuit Court of Appeals
reverse a conviction based upon that evidence? Even lawyers ask me
that. The answer is simple. In the lederal judicial system, unlike
the practice in most of the state courts, the Circuit Court of Appeals
that is the court of review, "is not allowed to consider the credi-
bility of witnesses or reliability of testimony. Particularly in the
federal judicial system, that is the jury's province": Mr. Justice
Frank's opinion in behalf of the Circuit Court of Appeals: (p.l648).

Why that rule has become so well established in the federal
courts is hard to say. Time and time again, a trial judge upsets a
a verdict of "guilty", or criticizes an acguittal'as a miscarriage of
justice. Time and time again, a state reviewing or appeals court
reverses a judgment upon a verdict of guilty, sometimes even without
sending it back for a new trial. History, too, has not infrequently
shown juries to have been dead wrong. But in the federal judicial
system the verdict of a jury, however induced by fear, or hysteria or
prejudice, if approved by the very trial judge who probably impelled
that verdict, can never be set aside on the ground that it was based
on false or unreliable testimony. Jhy must the defendants, why must
we all, accept irrevocably the view of a Judge Kaufman and of the jury
so exposed to the influence of his attitude and his rulings? why may
not a higher court review the reliability of the testimony, particular-
ly when the lives of two people depend upon that testimony? I should
think that every lawyer, every judge, anxious to vindicate the process-
es of law and to administer justice, as far as that is humanly possible,
would demand that some higher court, in the fair and detached atmos-
phere of a court of review, free from hysteria and devoid of the spirit
of "we'll show these Communists", review the evidence, every bit of it,
and direct the acquittal of the defendants, if the evidence did not
warrant their conviction. That is what we have a right to expect of
our courts: that is what courts are for!

But no, the federal courts of review are precluded from doing
this, and if the jury and Judge Kaufman were wrong on the facts that
is unfortunate, indeed. All that the apologists for the verdict can
say is, "These damned Communists had a trial according to law; they
had their day in court". And so have others, whose complete innocence
was established only after their bones had rotted in the grave to
which they were sent by the executioner appointed by the law.

And do not let anyone tell you that the defendants have had
their day in the United States Supreme Court. On the first present-
ation by the only mode of review allowable in the Supreme Court, that
is by a petition for a writ of certiorari, the Court refused to
accept the case for review, and thus the record of the case never came

before the Court. A second application has been made to that Court
and is there new pending. Incidentally, let no one, unwittingly
jeopardize the case or place himself in a criticizable position by

addressing himself to the Supreme Court with a single word of suggest-
ion, criticism or pleading. Please let the case there strictly alone.

Your interest, and your action, should still be directed to-
ward President Eisenhower, I believe his decision to refuse clemency
was based solely upon the recommendation of the pardon attorney of
the Dept. of Justice, arrived at in a few hours after the President
had received that recommendation. I understand that the President
has since s$ated.that he would re-consider the case if substantial
new evidence were presented. The Committee is working assiduously
in that direction, and needs your funds and your support to carry on
that WOI‘ko

I have given you a fairly detailed resume of the record, very
truthfully, without embroidery, with the utmost sincerity; I have
wanted to demonstrate to you that at the least, there is v ery grave
doubt as to the guilt of the Rosenbergs. Personally, I do not believe
them guilty. But even if you are not prepared to go that far, you
are convinced by now, I am sure, that there is grave and well-founded
doubt as to their guilt. I want you to carry that conviction to your
fellow—men; I want you to talk about it; I want you to join us in
stirring up as many of our fellow-Americans as you can to an under-
standing of the facts and of the records I believe that anyone who
takes the time to read the record will agree with us. I believe that
even the press and the commentators would agree with us if they read
the record, instead of merely depending upon what other publicists
wrote or what the trial judge or the United States attorney said
about the case. There is nothing so dangerous as a little learning.
How can people who know so little about this case speak and write
about it with such apparent conviction? What can we do to protect
the reputation of America for fairdealing with, and justice to,all,
even the most unpopular and the most humble?

We are in the midst of the greatest witch hunt of all time.
That witch hunt is possible largely because the majority of the
people do not know the truth. Our enemies, both internal and exter-
nal, have given us some legitimate cause for fear, and publicists and
minor-league politicians have fanned the fires of resentment and

hatred and fear until the true and original spirit of America is hard-
ly recognizable. It is almost as if we were back to the days of the
old witch trials, the days portrayed in that splendid play of the New
York stage, "The Crucible". I

But we will not be intimidated by public clamor. We will con-
tinue to speak up for the truth, and for generosity of mind, and for
kindness of heart, and‘for fairness and humanity. Thus we are built,
and thus we shall continue.

We shall spread the gospel truth about the Rosenberg case;

we shall plead for clemency for them, and at least for the following
reasons:

(1) There is grave doubt as to their guilt, as shown on the
record.

(2) The jury arrived at its verdict in the atmosphere gener-
ated by the introduction of the evidence as to Communism
an insurmountable obstacle to the defense, in the present
spirit of hysteria and fear;

(3) Their conviction was unquestionably due, in a large
measure, to the attitude of the trial judge and his treat-
ment of the defendants and their counsel, as contrasted
his attitude toward the witnesses and counsel for

the government;

When a jury, in this or any other case, sees the evident
disfavor with which the trial judge--and a federal judge
at that~-looks upon the defense, that jury inevitably,
understandingly reacts in the same manner, no matter how
many peous utterances or instructions come from the lips
of that judge, directing the jury to disregard his
attitude; .

The conviction is based almost entirely upon the testi-
mony of self-confessed accomplices, two of whom, Mrs.
Greenglass and Max Elitvher, were not even indicted and
the third of whom, the creator of the atom bomb material
if there was any such material--was let off with there-
ward of a fifteen-year sentence;

4‘;

(ll )

(5) The story of David Greenglass is so obviously false in
so many material respects that he is entitled to no
credence; a dog should not be put to death upon the strength
of his testimony;

(7) The story of the accomplices was not corroborated in any
material respect, by a single disingerested witness, nor by
any documents, writings, papers, or physical evidence of the
slightest materiality;

(8) No reviewing court, no one except the trial judge and tha
l2 jurors, has considered the reliability of the testimony or
its sufficiency for conviction;

(9) The chief acts charged against the defendants are alleged
to have occurred in 1944 and 1945, when we were an ally of
Russia; had the defendants been tried then, rather than 6
years later, it is doubtful whether they would have been
convicted; certainly death sentences would never have been
imposed;

(10) The sentence was imposed by the trial judge in thelight
of his avowed belief that the conduct of the defendants had
placed the A-bomb in the hands of the Russians years before
Russia could perfect the bomb and in the light of his opinion
that that had caused the Korean aggression; that histrionic
statement hardly synchronizes with the statement of one of
America's leading scientists, Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer, that
"there were not unpublished secrets concerning atomic weapons
and no secret laws of nature available only to a few", or with
the unequivocal statement of the Smyth Report, an official
Report of the United States Government, as to Atomic Energy
Development, published in l945, that "the principles that have
been used were well known to the international scientific world
in l940"; the trial judge was apparently not cognizant of the
fact that the development of the atomic bomb was a matter of
national resources and capacity rather than a matter of any
so—called atomic secrets; his sentence was based upon a clear

misapprenhension;

(ll) If Greenglass should recent his testimony, or the future
more clearly establish its utter falsity, a terribly and
irreparable injustice would have been done;

(12) The infliction of the death penalty for espionage, in a
civil court, is utterly without precedent; it has never
heretofore been inflicted by any civil court, in the history
of the United States;

(13) The infliction of a death penalty upon the two
defendants, one of whom is the mother of two small boys, is
out of all proportion to the 10-year sentences imposed upon
Axis Sally and Tokyo Rose, traitors directly serving our
enemies in time of our war with them, and to the 5 to 15 year
sentences imposed upon the four men who sold vital air force
secrets to Germany in the fall of 1941;

(l4) The leader of the atomic bomb conspiracy in which the
defendants are diardged with being links, the British
scientist and Russian spy working directly a t Los Alamos,

"Dr. Klaus Fuchs, was sentenced by a British court to fourteen

years for overt acts much more serious than those charged
against the defendants, and clearly proven; thus, a brilliant
scientist will soon be released from prison although proven
guilty of much more serious offenses than those for which an
obscure and humble New York engineer and his wife are now
sitting in death 861180

We are a great and powerful nation. We have never been
motivated by fear or hysteria or impelled by hate or blod-lust. The
world has been bathed in blood during almost two generations; we know
that the use of the implements of death is useless. We must lead the
world away from violence and death; we must remember that we are, as
the trial judge said, a God-fearing nation. And as a God—fearing

Copy of letter from D. Bernard m. Loomer, Dean of the School
of Theology, Chicago Univ. Chicago, to President Eisenhower:

February 13, 1953

The ﬁon. Dwight D. Eisenhower
President of the United States
The White House

Washington D 0

fear Mr. President:

I urge you to reccnsider your refusal to commute the death sentence of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

Together with nearly 2300 other clergyman, I signed a letter asking for
Executive Clemency. we assume that our letter is included in the mat-
erial prepared for your attention by the Justice Department.

Our unaffiliated group represents an important segment of the Christian
clergy of this country, Among us are members of 28 communions and cit-
izens of all 48 states, the District of Columbia, the territories of
Alaska and Hawaii, the Canal Zone and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

Many of the signers are spiritual and executive leaders in their res-
pective denominations. Included are presidents, deans and professors
of numberous theological schools and colleges and important members of
interdenominational organizations. All of us, as pastors, are in inti-
mate touch with our people; it is fair to conclude that our opposition
to the death sentence is shared by a much larger number of conservative
and thoughtful citizens.

It is difficult in a short letter to convey adequately the sense of the
considerations which led us to make our original appeal. Certainly,
one major consideration is the fact that the Rosenberg case has become
an occasion that catches up within itself all kins of attitudes, forces
and movements which are operating within our society. For this reason
we suggest that the Rosenberg case cannot be looked at simply in terms
of itself. Bbr this reason, the death sentence in this instance is an
indication of our national weakness rather than our national strength.
It is a reflection of our growing hysteria, fear and insecurity. When
looked at in this symbolic way, the death sentence itself further re-
duces the range of our freedom to think and act. It contributes to a
paralysis of critical thought, It furthers the mood of suppression
that becomes increasingly characteristic of our way of life. We are
not questioning the justice of the trial, but we earnestly question
the political and spiritual wisdom of the sentence. Surely we, as a
country, are strong enough to endure the kind of tension involved in
the Rosenberg case.

Since this is an inadequate summary of our views, I respectfully ask
on behalf of all of the signers that you grant an appointment at which
some of our number can present to you personally the considerations
which moved us to join in a common plea for mercy.

I am forwarding to you, herewith, a copy of our original-letter. I am
also forwarding a list of the 2300 clergyman who supported this appeal.

GREENGLASS PAPERS REVEAL
PERJURED TESTIMONY IN

ROSENBERG CASE

Two documents have become available that throw new light
on the testimony of the government's two chief witnesses, David and
Ruth Greenglass. 5?

One document is in David Greenglass’ handwriting, and is
dated "Saturday June 1950" , which is shortly after his arrest.
It purports to be a statement or recapitulation of what he told the
FBI, although there is no internal evidence that would indicate that
this was his first statement to them. The importance of this
document lies in the contradiction it gives to his courtroom testimony;
in the language of some portions which sound like a man inventing
a story rather than relating a truthful narrative; in certain serious
and inexplicable omissions; and, finally, in its confession that he
permitted the FBI to "remember" for him events he could not himself recall.

This handwritten document has been analyzed by a foremost
handwriting expert, and has been identified as a product of Greenglass‘
own hand. The authenticity of this document is further attested by
the fact that at least four major newspapers in France, £3 Combat ,
l§_Nbnde , Liberation ( all strongly anti—Communist) and the
Communist newspaper L'Humanite , have featured these documents on
their front pages since the middle of April without the charge of
"perjury" being levied by our government.

The second document is a typewritten one which appears,

‘from external evidence, to be from the office of 0. John Rogge,

 

Greenglass‘ attorney. It concerns a discussion between the Rogge
firm on the one hand and relatives and friends of Greenglass on

the other. This second document is likewise of extreme importance
because in it Ms. Ruth Greenglass, David's wife, contradicts vital
aspects of her husband's written statement and courtroom testimony;
because in this document Mrs. Greenglass portrays her husband as

a liar and a psychopath; and because it provides some internal
evidence that Greenglass may have comitted a fraud upon the FBI,
the court, his family, and the public with the possible knowledge
of his attorney.

This document is now being analyzed by an expert in
such matters, and there is every reason to believe that the document
is a product of the Rogge firm.

These two documents do not deal with peripheral or
secondary matters in the case. They go to the heart of the case, and
therefore raise fundamental doubts, which, when taken in the
context of other doubts - particularly the absence of a single
document linking the Rosenbergs to a "conspiracy to commit espionage" -
cause the trial to be viewed in an altogether new light.

At the very least, these two documents compel one to ask
whether Greenglass and his wife perpetrated a gigantic hoax on
the government, the courts, and the public. From this flows another
question: are the Greenglasses actually shielding other criminals
by involving two possibly innocent persons? One striking thing
about both documents is the complete absence of mention of Ethel
Rosenberg.

Below is presented an analysis of these two documents,
comparing them to each other where they meet, and comparing them
to the testimony in the court record.

1. In Mrs. Greenglass‘ summarized statement, she characterizes her
husband as follows: As to her husband, she stated that he had a
"tendency to hysteria’. As other times he would become delirious,
and once when he had the grippe he ran nude through the hallway,
shrieking of ‘elephants’ , ‘Lead Pants‘ .

"She had known him since she was ten years old. She said
he would say things were so even if they were not. He talked of
suicide as if he were a character in the movies but she didn't

think he would do it.“

Greenglass, in his written statement, corroborates his
wife's description of him in this fashion: "They (the FBI) told
me that I had told him (Harry Gold) to come back later because I
didn't have it ready. I didn't-remember this but I allowed it in
the statement". f

At the trial he repeats this willingness to have otherm
remember for him in another connection. (p. 590) " A. I - I had
told them about this - what they put in the statement, what they
wanted me to put in the statement, what they wanted me to put in
the statement in the first thing, they told me was just to make
a general statement, that is all."

Also, at the trial, he testifies, in respect to Harry Gold,
as follows:.P. 457. “ Q. Now, after mutual identification was
effected, did you have any conversation with Harry Gold?

5" A. Yes, I offered him something to eat and he said he
had already eaten. He just wanted to know if I had any information
and I said, ‘I have some but I will have to write it up. If you
come back in the afternoon I will give it to you.’ I started to
tell him the story about one of the people I put into the report,
and he ~ ~

"Q. Who was one of the people you put into the report?
"1. A fellow by the name of Bederson, and he cut me short."

This is an example of how Greeng1ass' memory improves to

‘the point of recollection of minute details, though starting from a

total absence of recollection of an entire incident.

In the light of his wife's description of him, these
discrepancies have to be viewed as more than innocent slips and
reoeveries.

Later, more such examples shall be given.

22 The guilt of the Rosenbergs revolved around three basic allegations:
a) that they involved Greenglass in espionage; b) that they sent

Gold to Greenglass to obtain inforation; c) that they personally
received a sketch of the A-bomb and twelve pages of scientific formulas
and notes from Greenglass.

a) In his document Greenglass says: " I told them (the FBI)
that on a visit to mewin November 1944 my wife asked me if I would
give informa tion. I made sure to tell the FBI that she was trans-

ittin this information from brother-in-law Julius and was not her

m g my
own idea. She was doing this because she fe t I would be angry if she

didn't ask me.“

In the typewritten document one finds: "Mrs. Greenglass discussed
her visit to New Mexico. She was there between March 1945 and March 1946.”

(Note that Ms. Greenglass was not under arrest when she
made this statement, but was actually home, having just returned from
the hospital after an accident. It may be presumed that she felt less
pressure than her husband to "color" a story.)

Mrs. Greenglass this establishes that she did not go to_
New Mexico until four months after the date her husband established
as the time of her visit.

It is also significant here that the government charges no
overt acts after January 1945. If Mrs. Greenglass did not get to
New Mexico until March 1945, as her statement indicates, then there
is no basis for any corroboration she attempts to give to events in
New Mexico prior to her arrival. The governmnt brought no documents
to show that Mrs. Greenglass was in New Mexico before March 1945.

Neverthess, she testified at the trial as follows: P.678-679

    

    

Q. And did you in fact go out to New Mxico in Nov. 1944?
A. I did.
Q. And prior to the time that yﬂu left New York to go to New Mexico
did you have a conversation with the defendants Julius andLEthel Rosenberg?
Ac Yes, I dido

oooooooooooooicooo

A. (continued) And he said - I wanted to know how he knew what
David was doing. He-said that his friends had told him that David was working
on the atomic bomb, and he went on to tell me that the atomic bomb was the most
destructive weapon used so far... (Also p. 727, 399, 423, 424).

Elsewhere in the typewritten document, however, she makes a statement
that casts doubt on whether such a conversation actually took pkxce. "She
would not have allowed her husband to bring anything hom after Hiroshima had
disclosed what the project w;§i" ~

The Hiroshima bomb was dropped in July 1945. If that was when she
first (?) learned about the atom bomb, as she says here, then the conversation
with the Rosenbergs either never took place, orelse it did not concern the
atom bomb in any way.

The tim at which she places her visit to her husband (March 1945)
and the time she establishes as fer first knowledge of the atom bomb (July
1945), contradicts completely her testimony that she visited her husband in
November 1944 and that she already knew before her visit of the atom bomb
from Julius Rosenberg.

This casts doubt on the governments first premise that the Rosenbergs
recruited Greenglass into espionage activities.

This doubt is strengthened by the complete absence in Greenglass'
written statement of any passing of atomic data to Rosenberg, although he
testifies otherwise at the trial), as well as by the absence of such a charge
in Ruth Greenglass‘ summarized statement.

b) In his handwritten statement Greenglass states specifically, "Also I
didn't know who sent Gold to 6."

Nevertheless he testifies at the trial, p. 457. "A. There was a
knock on the door and I opened it. we had just compheted eating breakfast,
and there was a man standing in the hallway who asked if I were Mr. Greenglass,
and I said yes. He stepped through the door and he said, ‘Julius sent me,’
and I said ‘oh’, and walked to my wife's purse, took out the wallet and took
out the matched part of the Jello box."

This portion of his testimony is further undermined by his written
statement, "Also I definitely placed my wife out of the room at the time of
Gold's vis it?“

On page 699-700, Mrs. Greenglass testifies that she was present
during the visit of Gold, and repeats the same account her husband gives.

But in her summarized statement she says, "She had remembered no
visitors at her house (in Albuqurque)."

Whether Gold ever visited them is less important than whether the
Rosenbergs sent Gold. It is upon this latter point that both David and Ruth
Greenglass now cast considerable doubt. This is apart from the unlikelihood
that a purported master spy would use his own name as a password.

This doubt is reinforced by Gold's testimony, during which it is
revealed that he never heard of the Rosenbergs,and by the absence of any
attempt by the government to show a connection between Gold and the
Rosenbergs.

One final statement in Greenglass' handwriting casts additional
doubt on this episode. He writes: But this I'll tell you I can honestly sa
the information I gave Gold maybe not at all what I said in the statement.
This is preceded by, "T=also made a pencil sketch of an H.E. mold set up for
an experiment."

At the trial he recalls the incident vividly, p. 459. "A. I got
out some 8 by 10 ruled white line paper, and I drew some sketches of a lens
mold and how they are set up in an experiment, and I gave descriptive
material that gives a description of this experiment." He also adds that
he'gave him a list of possible recruits for espionage."

And adds, p. 462. "I showed a high explosive hens mold. I showed
the way it would look with this high explosive in it with the detonators on,
and I showed the steel tube in the middle which would be exploded by this
lens mold."

His handwritten statement inclines one to disbelieve that Greenglass
"recovered" his memory. Rather, it tends to show that he was simply eager
to please the prosecution.

c) The government's third major premise was that the Rosenbergs
received from Greenglass a sketch of the a-bomb plus 12 pages of scientific

notes and formulae.
The contradictions in points a and b already begin to throw doubt

on this premise.

 

.. . ..,.M..—..,~ .......s.~ss............o...-.-.i—l..,_~

g, 4 5 g 5‘

Those doubts are strengthened by the absence of even a hint of
such an action in Greenglass' handwritten statement or in his wife's
summarized statement. Certainly one cannot say that Greenglass was attempt-
ing to shield his brother-in-law, since elsewhere, as shown, he says that
he was recruited into espionage work by Julius Rosenberg.

This doubt is further bolstered by the following testimony de-
signed to test Greenglass' background and his ability to sift overhead data,
evaluate it, and integrate it into the sketches and notes, p. 610. "Q. Now,
Mr. Greenglass, I believe you testified that you graduated from high school
here in New York City?

 

"A. Yes.
Q. And I think you testified that you went to Brooklyn Polytech?
A. Right."

"Q. How long did you go to Brookly Polytech?

A. Six months.

Q. And how many courses did you take during those six months?

A. About eight different courses."

"Q. Did you fail in your subjects?

A. I was ouite young at the time, about 18, and I liked to play
around more than I liked to go to school, so I cut classes almost the whole
term. Simple. ‘

Q. How many of the eight courses tat you took did you fail?

A. I failed them all."

Greenglass then denies any study or knowledge of calculus,
differential calculus, thermodynamics, nuclear physics, atomic physics,
quantum mechanics, or advanced calculus. (p. 612).

There is a further contradiction between Greenglass' omission of ,

the Rosenbergs as alleged recipients d‘ information and his testimony in
court concerning his first and subsequent statements to the FBI. P. 578
"Q. Are you now stating that you did not withhold conscientiously any
information concerning your illegal activities at Los Alamos and elsewhere
to the FBI authorities on the evening of June 15, l95O and the early hours
of the morning of June 16, l950?
"A. That is substantially what I mean."

Comparing this to his handwritten statement, with the aforemention-
ed omission, it is plain that Greenglass is lying. The passing of the secret
of the atom bomb to Rosenberg cannot be considered less than substantial,
or that Rosenberg had sent Gold to him.

One can only conclude that "remembered" this later.

3. No where in the handwritten document or in Ruth Greenglass' summarized
statement is there any mention of Ethel Rosenberg. But in all the foregoing
portion of transcript, Greenglass and his wife mention Ethel as being active
in the conspiracy.

4. In his handwritten document Greenglass sta tes, “I then mentioned a
meeting with a man who I dtin't know arranged by Julius. I established

the approximate meeting place but no exact date. The place was a car, an

Olds owned by my father~in-law, somewhere above 42nd Street on let Avenue

in Manhattan. I talked to the man but I recall very little about which we
spoke. I thought it might be that he wanted me to think about finding out
about H.E. lenses used in experimental tests to determine data on the a—bomb."

By the time the trial took phace, the stranger had acquired a Russian
nationality, p. 451. "Q. Did he (Julius Rosenberg) tell you who this person I
he wanted you to meet was?

A. He said it was a Russian he wanted me to meet.“

5) In Mrs. Greenglass’ sumarized statement, the following
appears: "People keep flocking in the house to offer support and advice
including that perhaps a right~wing lawyer should be selected."

At this time, according to the first paragraph of this statement,
"She was in bed as she had just returned from the hospital."

But she testifies as follows, p. 755.

Q. "Were you interviewed by newspaper men at any time between the 15th
of June, and three, four or five days thereafter?

A. “No.

Q. "You are quite sure of that?

A. "I was in bed. Nobody came into the house."

And yet on June 19th, "people keep flocking in the house."

The discrepancy would not be important were it not for the fact
that she is attempting to deny that she ever maintained that she and her
husband were innocent, thus eliciting nighborhood sympathy.

This is proven in the following lines, p. 733.

When did you go to see Mr. Rogge?

He came to see me.

At you home?

That's right.

Do you remember the day?

Yes.

Did you tell M. Rpgge that you were innocent?
No, I told him the whole truth.

The sumary document belies this later pose of instant confession
in these words: "OJR (0. John Rogge) pointed out that if Dave was innocent
he shoubd talk; that if not it would be advisable not to talk but to let
the Government prove its case. The third course was that of cooperation:
That was also discussed at 1ength:"

If the third course, "cooperation", was discussed at kength in the
absence of any difinite statement of innocence or guilt, it could only lead
to the situation which these documents reveal, namely that Greenglass and
his wife were both prepared to help "make" a case in order to save their
own skins.

It is significant that the statement on discussing cooperation is
the next to the last sentence in the document. The last one is, "There
was a long discussion about JR."

There the document ends, with JR (Julius Rosenberg?) mentioned
for the first time.

6) The sumary document, far from giving a hint of guilt,

actually gives one the impression that Mrs. Greenglass feels herself an
object of persecution. There is a hint that Greenglass had brought home
some uranium, and had been Questioned about it by the FBI. Mrs. Greenglass
complains that she and her husband were followed about and bothered by the
FBI. '

7) Doubt is even cast on the testimony that the Greenglass family
brought $4000 - David's espionage wages - to Rogge almost immediately upon
D&Vid'S arrest. "Mrs. Greenglass urged OJR to try to get a court appointment

,for himself and he agreed to try?“

It is very unlikely, unless the Greenglasses were prepared at that
time to plead innocent, that they would consider $4000 too small a sum to
pay for an attorney. Had they, as they claim in their court testimony, at
once confessed their guilt, they would undoubtedly have considered $4000 a
very adequate sum of money to pay a lawyer to plead them guilty.

8) Finally, we come to one characteristic of the Greenglass hand-
written statement. In portions it does not read like a man narrating the
truth, but more like a man carefully framing a story. "I made sure to tell
the FBI that she was transmitting this info from my brother-in law" - "I
established the approximate meeting place but no exact date" - "Also I
definitely placed my wife out of the room."

To any one familiar with taking statements from accused persons,
this language is inventive rather than narrative.

Conclusions: These two documents, taken together, indicate that
the Greenglasses were at first prepared to plead innocent, that they quickly
chose to "cooperate" with the prosecution, that their "cooperation" con-
sisted of making statements at variance with other known statements and
facts.

The documents are arguments for two steps: 1) Presidential
clemency, so that the danger of electrocution in the face of newly raised
doubts will be set aside, thus giving time for further exploration. 2)
Recognition by either the appropriate District Court, the Court of Appeals,
or the Supreme Court that the case merits a full scale investigation by the
Courts.

Re: David Greenglass

OJR and I visited Mrs. Greenglass at her home, 285 Rivington Street,
Brooklyn, New York, at 4:00 P.M. Sunday, June 18, 1950. She was in bed as
she had just returned from the hospital.

we first discussed the question of arranging a meeting of various

proposed are as follows:

There was subsequently present during the conference: Issy Feit,
Sam Greenglass, Bernard Greenglass, and Louis Abel.

T Mrs. Greenglass discussed her visit to New Mexico. She was there
between March 1945 and March 1946. They had been married in 1942. She feels
that New Mexico is a very bad pk: ce to try the case since the citizens did
not like GI's, because of the big boom and then the big slack, because of
anti-semitism and because the local citizens all felt bitter about the wives
of the GI's taking jobs there. She was employed in Albuquerque by the CPA
and temporarily by the Soil Conservation Office.

As to her husband, she stated that he had a "tendency to hysteria”.
At other times he would become delirious and once when he had the grippe he

‘ ran nude through the hallway, shrieking of "elephants", "Lead Pants”.

She had known him since she was ten years old. She said that he
would say things were so even if they were not. He talked of suicide as if
he were a character in the movies but she didn't think he would do it. They
had been under surveillance by the FBI for several weeks. In particular,
they had noticed a car of the Acme‘Construction Company, 1400 First Avenue in
Manhattan. She ascertained there was no such Company. (There is an Acme
Construction Company at 1402 Fulton Street in Brooklyn). She was interviewed
at the hospital by two FBI men, Mr. Tully and Mr. Wood. One was tall,
ruddy and dark. The other she described as toothy and short. They assured
her that they had nothing against her. She described her stay in Albuquerque
and stated that she could not remember all of her addresses. Since it was
difficult for GI's to get rooms for a long period, they had lived in five or
six places. She had only been to Los Alamos to a party for a few hours one
time. She had remembered no visitors at her house. She had notice of the
project and signed an affidavit for it. She knew her mail was censored.

She would not have allowed her husband to bring anything home after Hiroshima
had disclosed wha t the project was. vShe intended to raise a family and did

  
 
 

'not want that kind of material around. In the future she will refer everyuy
one to her lawyer. . ;

      
         

‘ She pointed out Dave did not ask for the job; that he was going
' overseas; that they have been watched constantly and feels as if they are
the object of persecution. Shortly before their accident the FBI asked if they
had a specimen of uranium in the house, in the course of what they call a a
routine investigation. One of their friends had a similar experiences

    
   
     
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
    
  
  

  

Pebple in the neighborhood want to raise a petition.
All newspapers are to be referred to her lawyer.

People keep flocking in the house to offer support and advice including that
perhaps a right-wing lawyer should be selected. The Jewish Daily Forward,
which is certainly not a leftist newspaper; is very excited about the
antisemitio issue and_has offered a lawyer, Mrs. Greenglass urged OJR to

’ i try. OJR pointed out that if Dave was innocent he should talk; that if not
it would be advisable not to talk but to let the Government prove its ease.
The third course was that of cooperation. That was also discussed at length.

There was a long discussion about JR.

Questions to be leaked up:

1. Was the arrest valid - was he held in detention
before the complaint issued? r

2. What is the effect of‘ the complaint?

3. What do the cases hold on the intent to harm the
a Government? '

4. Statements of Coconspirators.

STATEMENT FROM WALDO FRANK- Writer

At this late hour, I can only repeat my plea for clemency. I
have no right to question the guilt of the Rosenbergs, for I did not
attend their trial nor study the evidence against them; although I
have been moved by the grave doubts of equipped legal minds, about
evidence and the attitude of the trmal Judge. These doubts, from
from such quarters, alone, should move our country to avoid the
irrevocable act of the death sentence.

But there are other urgent reasons for clemency. Granted that
the Rosenbergs are guilty, their crime is still not proved, in the
perspective of the years when it was committed, to have been a de-
liberate and hostile act against the United States and our people.
For Russia at.that time was our Ally, and, if the Rosenbergs were
communists, their motivation might conceivably have been - however
deplorably misled— loyalty to what seemed to them the cause of peace
and social justice.

It is the intuition of this, I believe, which has horrified
sensitive people and leaders, the world over, against the death
sentence: people and leaders who cannot be suspected of "softness"
to the communist cause. I, for well over a generation, have been
an ideological opponent of Communism and orthodox Marxism. ‘

But I know that, despite cynical power-politics, milltons of
simple men and women have been moved by dreams of social justice to
believe in communism. The way to reach people is not through cruelty,
which they will interpret as fear. no we not dare to be generous?
have we so little confidence in the right and strength of our own
way of life, that we fear to temper justice with mercy?

From the cool standpoint of foreign policy, our President and
our State Department are in danger of committing a great stupidity:
one which would corroborate the lies spread against us by our
enemies, which we so continuously and so expensively protest against.
But there is more at stake in the conscience of our people. If we
permit this unprecedented legal act, so deplorably different from
the actions of British Justice, we shall not forgive ourselves for
ignoring the human factors in this case and for barring the door
against a possible reparation, if the perspective of times changes
our View of what is just. -

The death sentence against the Rosenbergs should be commuted.

STATEMENT OF DR. HAROLD C. UREY

Last December I made a statement in a letter to Judge Kaufman
on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in which I outlined my
impression relative to the evidence presented in their trial. I see
no reason to modify that statement at the present time. The new
data relative to the console table published recently in the Guardian ;
if it can be substantiated, confirms my impression relative to the ‘
importance of this part of the testimony. I hope this matter will
be gone into in great detail in a new trial for the Rosenbergs.

(1) There has been much discussion of the importance of the
secret data which Greenglass states that he gave to the "Russians".
I believe this data was important and that it was not publicly
known at the time it was disclosed, and I have been assured of the
correctness of this conclusion by competent scientific men who were
at Los Alamos at the time. Scientists who have made contrary state-
ments are uninformed on this subject. It seems likely that the
data transmitted by Greenglass was not nearly so important as that
given by others, particularly by Fuchs.

(2) It seems probable to me that a mechanic such as Greenglass
eapahle of making metal parts from drawings, should be able to re-
produce those drawings in rough form after a lapse of some years.

No great scientific knowledge is required to understand the
approximate shape, arrangement, and sizes of a mechanical object,

and considerable information of this kind could have been aquired and
transmitted by Greenglass. This does not mean that he could be ex-
pected to understand the theoretical or scientific reasons for con-
struction of the A—bomb.

I believe that we should emphasize the question of guilt or
innocence and questions relative to the fairness of the trial. In
this connection I wish to emphasize certain points part of which I
have previously emphasized.

(1) Three witnesses against the Rosenbergs, Ruth and David
Greenglass and Max Elitcher, had confessed to crimes, Ruth Green~
glass was not indicted. David Greenglass hoped for leniency which
he received, Max.Elitcher stated that he hoped for leniency and has
not been indicted. I do not trust the testimony of self—confessed
criminals, especially when under such great temptation. I wonder
why the government did not call Ann Sidorovich as it promised to do.
There was no third party to the contradictory testimony of the
Rosenbergs and Greenglasses and she could have supplied this.

(2) No connection between the Rosenbergs and Russian agents
was established. Consider on possibility: If the Greenglasses dealt
directly with foreign agents, the Rosenbergs are not needed in the
conspiracy at all, either to supply the gelatine box identificateon,
instructions to the Greenglasses, or bribe money.

(3) It has been suggested to me that the government has much
evidence against the Rosenbergs involving vital secret data which
cannot be disclosed in open court and hence the conviction and
sentence are justified regardless of the evidence. I reject this
theory and practice of justice as exceedingly dangerous and contrary
to the historical justice of the United States. If our secrets are
so important, then criminals should not be tried and condemned to
death without public presentation of the evidence, and in this case
criminals must go free. Personally, I would like to see this evidenc
and until I can see it and discuss it in public it does not exist for
the purposes of my discussion of this case,

 

-3-

I should like to see a new trial granted to the Rosenbergs.
Such a trial would give much information about this whole affair
and would be worth all‘the cost even if the verdict and sentence
were the same, because the cloud and uncertainty of the present
situation lowers our confidence in our own courts of law and be-
cause such a trial would place us in a better position in the
light of world opinion. ‘

Dr. Urey's letter to the New York Times:

After reading the testimony of the Rosenberg case I find that
I cannot put to rest my doubts about the verdict and wish to cite
the following points:

(1) Max Elitcher’s testimony is of doubtful value. He says
that he and Julius talked about espionage but never transferred
any information for some five years. This doesn’t seem probable
to me.

(2) No certain conspiracy between Sobell and Rosenberg is
established.

(5) The connections to others than Ruth and David Greenglass
are not established. Miss Bentley was unable to identify the
telephone voice that said,"This is Julius" with the voice of Jul-
ius Rosenberg. If "Julius" did not refer to him in this case, lt
probably did not when Harry Gold said, "I come from Julius" when
he met Greenglass in New Mexico. From Gold's testimony it seems
that he knew nothing of Rosenberg at all. It seems unbelievable
to me that the name of an arch conspirator would be used in such
identification phrases.

(4) No contact between the Rosenbergs and Anatoli Yakovlev
is established, ‘

(5) The government's case rests on the testimony of Ruth and
David Greenglass. He had pleaded guilty, but had not been sent-
enced and hoped for clemency. -She has never been charged and tried,
obviously it seems as a reward for her testimony. A family fued
between the Greenglasses and the Rosenbergs existed because of a
business altercation. The Rosenbergs' testimony flatly contradicted
that of the Greenglasses.

TESTIMONY OF ROSENBERGS

I found the Rosenbergs' testimony more believable than that of
the Greenglasses, although I realize that I have not had the jurors‘
advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses. It is costumary
for spies to be paid in wrist watches and console tables? Green-
glass and Fuchs were paid in cash. The Rosenbergs appear to have
been poor as church mice and the statement that Julius was spend-
ing m5O or 975 a night in night clubs seems to me to be a very
doubtful one.. Had he done this, he would have been obviously and
unaccountably rich to all his associates.

However, even if the verdict is correct, 1 am amazed at the
unequal punishment for the same crime. For the very same con-
spiracy Ruth Greenglass was never brought to trial, though she
admitted her guilt on the witness stand; David Greenglass got
fifteen years; Morton Sobell and Harry Gold got thirty years, and
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg got death, Only the last two took the
witness stand and maintained their innocence. If capital punish-
ment is to be given in the future for espionage I should like to
have it introduced in a case for which the evidence rests on the
testimony of witnesses who did not stand to profit from their
testimony. I do not regard self-confessed criminals as reliable
witnesses.

We are engaged in a cold war with the tyrannical Goverment
of the U.S.S.R. We wish to win the approval and loyalty of the
good people of the world. Would it not be embarrassing if, after
the execution of the Rosenbergs, it could be shown that the United
States had executed two innocent people and let a guilty one go
completely free? And, remember, somewhere there is a represent-
ative of the U.S.S.R. who knows what the facts are.

I Strongly urge a careful reconsideration of this sentence.

Harold C. Urey

QHJMYTH oF_mHa,ATou_soMs sscssr

The logic which put the Rosenbergs in the death cell
collapses as soon as one-ﬂaces the fact hat there was

1 - No "secret" of the atom bomb;

2 ~ No appreciable gain in time by Russia in.manufact-
uring the first atom bomb, as the result of espion-
age.

Dealing with the first, Dr. Ralph E. Lapp, who spent 3 years
on the Manhattan Project, wrote in Colliers of July 5,'l952,

in an article titled "Too Many Secrets Spoil the Atom", as
follows:

- - ~ "To assume that there was a secret to the A—bomb
(is) a myth born in the days following Hiroshima.
Just what the secret was nobody specified; pre-
sumably it was too secret. Nonetheless, this atomic
myth grew and grew until it was finally implanted
in the American mind. Ask any reputable scientist
and he will tell you flatly that there is no scien-
tific secret to the A-bomb. The thing which gave
the United States the A—bomb so quickly was our tech»
nical know-how and the power of our production line
- exactly the same thing which gives America its
millions of automobiles and TV sets. And there's
no secret about that."

Dr. Lapp points out that the only "secret" we had was —

"simply that an A-bomb could be made. We let the
world in on that "secret" on Aug 5, 1945, when Hiro-
shima felt the unleashed and savage power of the
atom. But that secret is out, and can never be
locked up again." ’

There seems little need to belabor the point. Since Hiroshima,
scientists of every type have been busy trying to educate the
world to the fact that there is no secret to the A—bomb - and
that it was only a matter of time before any nation willing to
spend the time, money and skill on the project would have the
bomb Q

However, a few other quotations should be noted. J. Robert
Oppenheimer, reported in the N. Y. Times of January 1951 ~

~ — — "declared there were no ‘unpublished’ secrets con-
cerning atomic weapons and no ‘secret laws of nature’
available only to a few."

Editorial in September 1949 issue of "Atomics", commenting on
President Truman's announcement of Soviet atomic explosion:

- - - "It should not.be startling since it is only what ev-
ery reputable scientist who knows the principle of
nuclear physics has been predicting since we dropped
the bomb on Japan 4 years ago. Since the discovery
of nuclear fission in 1958 there has been no basic
secret regarding an atom bomb."

To accuse a junior engineer and his typist wife of stealing

this mythical "secret and putting it in the hands of foreign
powers, and further to use this accusation as the basis for
sentencing them to death, all in the name of justics, is to make
a mockery of the law and courts. ‘

ESPIONAGE AS A FACTOR IN DEVELOPING THE A—BOMB

In reference to the second point in the logic of death,
1.e., that spy information shortened the time necessary for
Russia to produce the A-bomb ~ Dr. Lapp in his Collier article
exposes this effectively. Commenting on the fact that "many
a glib commentator and columnist" had "explained" the fact that

- 1 -

.li...,_..i..~g....m...i.....i..m.....“...v.l..~.....‘...u......A...it A‘ A> ,. , .  .

Russians had the A—bomb by "saying that the Russian bomb was
our bomb."

Dr. Lapp quotes one writer as saying:

~ — - "Dr. (Klaus Emil Julius) Fuchs, the arch—traitor of
all time, gave our A-bomb secret to the Soviets!" "Pre-

;ec; cisely what did Dr. Fuchs give to the Soviets?" Dr.
Lapp asks, and continues "It is known that Fuchs
passed on valuable dasa about Oak Ridge processes and
about technique for assembling the component parts of
an A—bomb. There is no doubt that these data were
greatly useful to the Russian A-bomb project. Egy-
ever, the Fuchs data did not give the A-bomb to the
Soviets. . . ."

THe reason, Dr. Lapp points out, is that important parts of

an A—bomb are not the "specifications or drawings", but the
"ingredients" - the "precious refined uranium most of all" —
which required the "building of enormous plants such as those
at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, or those
built at Paducah, Kentucky, and on the Savannah River in South
Carolina." So, continues Dr. Lapp: -

— - - "Short of transplanting our huge production plants to
Soviet soil, there was really no way to 'give' the A~
bomb to the Russians. Had we sent them every singde
blue—print or document in our atomic project, this
would not have given them the A-bomb. Of course it
would have helped just as the Fuchs data helped; bgg
it would not have made the difference between success
and failure in their project. We sadly underestimated
the Soviet technological and industrial capacity, and
it is wishful thinking to attribute their early suc-
gess with their A—project to the theft of our secrets.
Soviet espionage probably shortened their A-project
time schedule by only a few months."

What Dr. Lapp says is concurred in by scientists everywhere -
that is, that any nation willing to spend the time, mlney and
skill to build the installations necessary can have the A-bomb.
The U.S. was first, the Soviet Union followed 4 years later,
and the experiments in Australia indicate that Great Britain
is third. Espionage, while helpful, is relatively unimportant
to the success or failure of such a project.

Since the factor of importance, that is, the value of the data
supposedly transmitted to the U.S.S.R. through the Rosenbergs,
was basic in the reasons given by Judge Kaufman for imposing
the death sentence, one reads with a wierd sense of unreality
the report of the Joint Houseesenate Report on Atomic Energy.

For this 222 page report, publicized after the Rosenbergs were
sentenced,and entitled "Soviet Atomic Espionage", describes
the data supposedly supplied the Soviets by the Rosenbergs as
the least important of all spy information. The Report lists
the spies in order of their effectiveness as follows:

- - - Dr. Klaus Fuchs, Dr. Allen Nunn May, Dr. Bruno Pente-
carvo, and David Greenglass.

The last mentioned, David Greenglass, brother of Ethel Rosen-
berg, was the chief government witness against the Rosenbergs.
Greenglass' testimony that he had given information to Julius
Rosenberg Egg the government case against the Rosenbergs.

The Commission Report says of David Greenglass:

- - - “The bomb sketches and explanations that Greenglass -
as a virtual layman - could prepare must have counted
for little compared with the authoritative scientific
commentary upon atomic weapons that Fuchs transmitted -
_- Everything considered, Greenglass appears to have
been the least effective of the four spies. . ."

X21

I ' '
I

And the Rgsenbergs? The Commission Report mentions them enly
to record their sentences. '

In view of the above statements by Dr. Lapp and the Joint Conn
gressional Committee, what becomes of our "super-criminals"
who stole the "super secret", who “changed the course of
history", and who incurred the super penalty 9f death - the
first time such a sentence has been impgsed in the U.S.A.?

Can scientists of the world stand by and allow the execution

gf Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg, sentenced for stealing the scientific
discevery of this age, when the facts demolish the foundation
gpgn which the sentence is based?

It is our opinion that elementary justice demands that all sciw
entists speak out against this savage sentence, even if no ad-
ditional mitigating circumstances were present in this case.

And there are such other mitigating circumstances, which not
gnly condemn the harsh sentence, but raise grave doubts as to
the guilt of the convicted couple. .

THE PROSECUTION case

. Sg far we have confined ourselves to a discussion er
the reasons advanced by Judge Kaufman to justify the impqsit~
ion_9f the death sentence. At this point we must discuss the
case itself for the purpose of showing that there is grave
doubt as t5 the guilt of the accused.

THE EXHIBITS

First, we must state that we have ng government exu
hibits to refer to; no documents, no intercepted messages,
no recordings of conversations, no corroborating testimony
of unbiased witnesses; not a thing, unless we wish to con~
sider the Spanish Refugee collection can (found in the Resen-
berg apartment), or Ethel Rosenberg's signature on a nomin—
ating petition for Peter Cacchione, Communist candidate for
the New York City Council, offered in evidence by the govern-
ment to prove the Rosenbergs had "radical" leanings.

No, this was a trial based on meetings and conversations be-

tween relatives, classmates and friends, none of which could
be corroborated. -

THE TESTIMONY OF GREENGLASS

The case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg boils down

to this:

David Greenglass, a confessed espionage agent, states without
proof that he gave to his brother-in-law for transmission ta
the Russians: ’

l e A sketch of a lens mold used to detonage the
atom bomb;

2 - A sketch of the bomb itself with 12 pages at
descriptive material. -

A MACHINIST "PICKS UP" THE A-BOMB

Greenglass is supposed to have obtained this informa~
tion while employed in a machine shop in the Los Alamos, New
Mexico, plant where experiments on detonating mechanisms for
the A-bomb were in progress. The information, testified T
Greenglass, was transmitted to Julius Rqsenberg during two
rurloughs he (Greenglass) spent in New York City in January
and September of 1945.

_ 5 -

P

Greenglass further testified that he had never taken any blue-
prints or classified materials from the plant, and that the
sketches and descriptive material transferred to the Rosenbergs
were all taken from memory. .He further testified that he had
obtained this information (a sketch of the A-bomb and 12 pages
of descriptive material) solely by talking to people, picking
uﬁ snatches of conversation, and bits of information "here and
t ere .

THE A-BOMB FROM MEMORY - TWICE!

Greenglass introduced sketches and descriptive material
at the trial in 1951, which he claimed he had drawn up from
memory of those in 1945, and which he claimed were similar to
those he turned over to Rosenberg, 6 years before.

Other than the statement of his wife, Ruth, who supported his
testimony, there was nothing to corroborate Greenglass’ testi~

mony. No witnesses, no documents.

THE ROSENBE1-'iGS* DENIAL

Julius Rosenberg denied all accusations, as did his
wife, who was chargedeas an accomplice on the grounds that
she was aware of the nature of the acts of her husband and
had actively aided him by contacting her brother (Greenglass)
and typing the 12 pages of descriptiveumaterial.

The Rosenbergs admitted that the Greenglass‘ had visited them
many times, but not for the purposes outlined by them in their
testimony. ‘

So what have we? Relatives meeting at home; private conversa-
tions, unrecorded, unheard by witnesses, and not a scrap of
concrete evidence.

Whom shall we believe? - the uncorroborated word of a David
and Ruth Greenglass, or a Julius and Ethel Rosenberg?

This was the problem the prosecution had to overcome; a prob-
lem which was aggravated by the fact that the key witnesses for
the prosecution were self-confessed perjurers and spies, the
type of witness whose testimony is always taken with the gravest
reservations, unless supported by corroborating evidence or un—
biased witnesses. (David and Ruth Greenglass had been indicted
in New Mexico for espionage, and faced a death penalty. For
testifying against the Rosenbergs, David Greenglass’ sentence
was limited to 15 years, and his wife Ruth went free).

Before we discuss just how the prosecution solved the problem -
at least to the extent of obtaining a jury verdict - let us try
to solve this problem for ourselves from the facts set forth
in the transcript of the trial.

QUALIFICATIONS OF DAVID GREENGLASS AS A-BOMB SPY

We might start by asking: has David Greenglass the
qualifications necessary to gather, analyze, piece together,
memorize, and reproduce from memory (once in 1945 and again in
1951) the highly technical information he claims to have trans~
mitted to the Rosenbergs?

Greenglass went through New York public schools; learned his

'trade of machinist in aviation school; failed eight courses at

Brooklyn Polytechnic; took one and a half semesters at Pratt
Institute, an engineering school. Under cross-examination, he
admitted he never took any courses in calculus, thermo-
dynamics, nuclear physics, atomic physics, quantum mechanics,
nor had he read any basic books on these subjects.

0 ~ V-‘ . .

O 0‘

Now, this man spent one year in one of four machine shops in
Los Alamos, machining experimental parts for a detonating mech-
anism for the A~bomb., In this one year, as the result of con~
versations, bits of information picked u here and there,
Greenglass claims he was able to make a ketch of the A-bomb

and write up 12 pages of descriptive material. Six years later,

Greenglass again drew (from memory) another sketch of the bomb,
which he gave to the court as evidence. John A. Derry, electn

rical engineer and personnel officer to Major Groves, testified
that the Greenglass sketch was a reasonably correct representa~
tion of the Nagasaki type bomb.

Need we comment on this? No fair-minded person, freely'con-
sidering the case unharrassed by prejudice and hysteria, could
for one moment give credence to such patently pre-arranged and
coached testimony by a person trying to save himself by turning
state's evidence.

And where is the scientist who even in these times will.have
the stomach to call this fakery the truth?

(For the uninitiated, we suggest a visit to any machine shop,
anywhere, in which classified material is handled. one could
work at machining parts for a life-time and never know the
finished, assembled product. Even the assemblers are kept in
ignorance, by having units assembled separately, then units‘
combined to other units. The final stage of any assembly is
done behind closed doors in ultra-restricted zones. This is
true of any type of classified material, and ten times truer '
when it comes to a project like the A-bomb).

» 0

Now, Greenglass is a confessed spy. Although he claimed to
have stolen the secret of the bomb itself, he was not above
admitting the theft of a detonating lens mold which he worked
on as a machinist. And this type of esp onage is just about
suited to Greenglass' capacities and opportunities. The rest‘
is hocus-pocus, designed to inflate and dramatize the charges,
and Justify the death penalty.

The Joint-Congressional Committee confirms this:

- - — "Greenglass' diagrams" said the Committee, "have a
theatrical quality. . ."

It may have been good theater - - but it was poor justice for
the man and woman on trial for their lives.

a letter showing perjury in the Rosenberg Case as having been written
by David Greenglass, whose testimony has sent Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg to the Death House.

Elizabeth McCarthy of Boston, Mass., reported her findings to
the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case after
a "detailed microscopic study" comparing samples of Greenglass’ sign
ature with the handwritten letter published by Le Combat,French
anti-Communist news paper.

The letter directly contradicts testimony that Greenglass made
in the trial in which he claimed he stole the secret of the atomic
bomb at the request of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

The letter was checked against the writing of Greenglass appearé
ing on his marriage license, a physician's statement, and on a
certificate of partnership of the G. &.R. Engineering Co., and on a
Certificate of Conducting Business on file in New York. d

Elizabeth Mccarthy stated that "there are such unique and
remarkable similarities between questioned and standard writing in
all of the important, underlying unconscious writing characteristics
that I can come to no other conclusion than that they were written
by one and the same person.

"These are the elements in one's hand of which his is not aware,
and which he cannot therefore hide, alter or disguise. They include
type of motion; finger, wrist and arm movement; rhythm, balance and
hand coordination; condition of writing line; pressure; vertical and
base—line angulation, trouble spots; spacing; relative proportions
between small, tall and capital letters; initial, connecting and
terminal strokes; as well as individualistic formation habits in
key letter." '

Elizabeth McCarthy has testified during the past 18 years in
many states, in state and federal courts. She has appeared for the
federal government, state and county attorneys, attorneys in general
criminal and other cases, and also in cases for defendants.

She has been consulted in many cases involving signatures and
writing identifications by bank, insurance companies and other
business and credit organizations. She is also a member of the Bar.

***************=|<************************#***

I am sincerely grateful for this opportunity of joining with so
many of you here, and with thousands outside of these portals, in supporting a
cause which we so earnestly feel just - a cause so deserving of the support of
all true Americans interested in maintaining the reputation of our nation for
justice to all, however humble they may be or however unpopular their opinions,
and in extending the gesture of mercy to all deserving of it.

The story of the Rosenbergs and Morton Sobell has aroused the
interest and excited the sympathy of intelligent and humane people the world
over. Its possible horrible climax is one which chills the sympathetic hearts

The unfortunate results thus far achieved in the judicial

process, the overwhelming voice of the press and commentators, the strident

clamor of professional patriots, the attitude of a good portion of the public in-
fluenced by the current hysteria, are appaling. It is difficult to believe that a
powerful, literate, largely Christian people would so loudly and so bitterly cry
for the blood of two small people, at the tremendous risk of taking their lives by
an act which to many appears almost uncivilized folly. How can man be so cruel to
man 3 And yet how can man be so kind to man I '

How can so many hundreds of thousands of people, in constantly
growing numbers, Jew and Gentile, clergy and layman, humble and poor, or influen-
tial and great in achievement, offer their time, their money, their best thought
in behalf of three humble persons whom they know not. How can so many of us accept
bitter criticism, endure the condemnation of professional colleagues, the receipt
of natty and obscene letters, social ostracism, yes, death threats ? Unless she be
sustained by an overwhelming conviction, by an unconquerable love of man, how can
a 90 year old lady, bowed by arthritis, greatly impaired in hearing, travel alone
from Washington to New York to add her clear voice to that of the mercyuseekers ?
How can an Irish Catholic women give her entire life savings of $1700 to this
Comittee because her little children are daily asking her, "Mother, who is taking
care of the Rosenberg children ?"

These women, all of us, are able to do and endure these things be-
cause our hearts and minds cannot tolerate injustice. we have to speak out against
it. we have to continue to speak out for justice even after the formalities of law
have been observed. we do not - despite the yelping of the uninformed - seek to
overthrow the law or to nullify its operation.

Law and justice are not always synonimous. Fbrty-five years ago,
in the first lecture to us as law students, Dean Wigmore, one of the great legal
minds of all time, said, "You are not here to study justice you are here to study
law." That was not cynicism. Law is a body of rules formulated for the conduct of
§33iety, intended to meet the greatest possible number of situations; each rule is
intended to be that which, in the long run, is best for society. It is the rule
which is designed to meet the average situation. In seeking to cover 100 different
situations, the rule of law inevitable meets none exactly - it does exact justice
in none - or at most in very few of the 100.

And for that reason, every constitution vests in the highest
executive officer of the government the authority to grant
