.. .:..:. ..\;‘;"’T.":..§l§VT:.Y,.  Senator Robert M. LaFollette Sr. was one of the few au- mmmgyou -“E mag
 ’   ‘   ~* thentic heroes of American politics. His constituents 
called him Fighting Bob, and the magazine he founded in ..  

1909 was a ﬁghting publication. It still is.

Since the ﬁrst issue came off the press almost three-
quarters of a century ago, The Progressive’s mission has
been to report the hidden history of the United States as it

» unfolds, presenting readers with the information and
analysis the mass media won’t provide.  _ 

That’s why ‘ ‘Project Censored’ ’ has selected several A I  T — I I

articles from The Progressive every year for its prizewinning list of ‘ ‘most censored” stories———articles that deserved,
but did not receive, nationwide press and broadcast attention.

In this seventy-ﬁfth year of publication, The Progressive can pledge once again to provide its readers every month
with an important and unique perspective on national and international developments and on local situations that may
have broad signiﬁcance.
