More than 200 Anti-Labor Bills are now before Congress and another group be-
fore the State Legislature. Every one of these Bills is designed, in one form or another,
to cripple the Labor Movement, hamper its bargaining power and reduce its effec-
tiveness in struggle against the employers.

Among these Anti-Labor Bills are measures to abolish‘ the Closed Shop, the Union
Shop, and the Maintenance of Membership Shop. Others call for the elimination
of the right to strike, the legalization of labor injunctions and the crippling of the
Wagner National Labor Relations Act. ~

EVERY SINGLE RIGHT OF LABOR, EVERY SINGLE
ADVANCE MADE BY LABOR, EVERY SINGLE GAIN FOR
WHICH LABOR HAS SO DESPERATELY FOUGHT AND
WHICH WAS FINALLY WON IS NOW IN DANGER!

rm: IITTIIIJII on man IS AIME!) IIT YOU

Weak U|1i0|1S: mean wage Guts. P00!‘ Working conditions, long hoursand speed up—this
hastening a repetition of the hunger days of 1930-39. ALL the people (small businessmen.
professionals, farmers) will suffer if unions are weakened and wage levels cut.

An attack on the rights of 50 million trade unionists and their families will be the "GO"
sign for reactionary attacks on ALL civil rights. Weakening and destruction of the Labor Move-
ment leads directly. to Fascism.

Only Big Business—the trusts-—and their reactionary stooges—-gain if Labor is weakened.
Their immense profits will soar even higher, and H165? ¢l0|‘|'|l|13l'i0ﬂ 0Ve|' "16 Amem-'3“ Pe°Ple
will be greater than ever.

ﬂct ﬂow!

Labor and the People must make their voices heard in Washington and Sac-
ramento. United Labor Action can stop the drive to destroy organized labor.

I. Write, wire, petition Congress to defeat all Anti-Labor Legislation.

2. Send protest to F. A. Hartley, Chairman, House Committee on Labor. Robert A. Taft,
Chairman, Senate Committee on Labor.

   

3. Write your Congressman, Senator and Assemblyman.
