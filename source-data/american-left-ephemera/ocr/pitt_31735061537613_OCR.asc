 

that today history is merely repeating itself. They cite the
current elections, the formal legal existence of the Com-

'munist Party and the trade unions, as evidence, that things

aren’t really so bad here, after all. And so they prophesy that
the present reactionary offensive of big capital will quickly
run its course, that the “pendulum will inevitably swing” back
and automatically assure the victory of the democratic camp.
These well-meaning but misled people believe that the demo-
cratic sentiments and traditions of the American people are so
strong that “it can't happen here.” They see the fascist drive
of the monopolies only as a temporary aberration, a passing
“phase,” and shut their eyes to the reality of its danger.
But those who are seriously determined to win the ﬁght
against war and fascism cannot put their reliance in the tactics
and weapons that sufﬁced for earlier struggles, nor can they
allow themselves to become prisoners of a Maginot line politi-

cal psy-chology. They must uncover the new features in this’

postwar offensive of American monopoly, and estimate cor-
rectly how and to what extent the danger is increasing.

To this end, it is necessary ﬁrst to know clearly what fascism
is, to understand its class nature and to generalize the uni-
versal features of its development. ,

As the history of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy tragically
demonstrates, fascism in power is the open, terrorist dictator-

’ ship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic and most im-'

perialistic elements of ﬁnance capital.

Fascism is the power of ﬁnance capital, its organized ven-
geance against the working class and all militant progressives.
In foreign policy, fascism is jingoism in its crudest form.

_The establishment of fascism does not substitute the rule of
one class for the rule of another. But neither is. its advent an
ordinary succession of‘ one bourgeois government by another.

. Fascism is bourgeois rule by open, terrorist dictatorship, re-

placing the old form of capitalist domination, bourgeois
democracy. . '

Fascism advances toward power where the working class and

the popular forces generally are weak and divided. ‘But its A

advance also reﬂects the weaknesses and instability of capital-
ism, which is unable to rule in the old way, or to pursue a
peaceful foreign policy. -

History tells us that the development of fascism and the
establishment of fascist dictatorship does not follow an iden-
tical pattern in all countries. The forms and methods of fascist
rule also differ from country to country, determined by dif-
ferences in the relation of class forces, national traditions and
the economic position of monopoly.

‘But despite the speciﬁc features that mark the development '
-of fascism in this or that country, there are certain general

features which it displays always and everywhere.

Thus, while the way fascism has come to power differs in
this or that country, in every country the drive toward fascism
and its victory have been accompanied by extensive prepara-
tions for imperialist war, especially for an anti-Soviet crusade.
Thus, too, while the establishment of a fascist dictatorship in
certain countries has been preceded by the development of
fascist mass movements, in every country it has been -preceded
by the growth of capitalist reaction and by the adoption of a

- s stem ofreactiona measures to cri 1e and smash the trade
Y YY PP

unions, to outlaw the Communist Party and ruthlessly to
oppress all national minorities. .

And, while the establishment of fascism has been accom-
panied by the abolition of bourgeois-parliamentary govern-
ment only in certain countries, and in others has maintained
the forms of a sham parliamentarism—yet in all coun-tries fas-

cism has ‘savagely wiped out all democratic liberties for the-

masses. -

No matter how fascism develops, or by what ‘means it comes
to power, fascism everywhere, as Dimitrov pointed out in 1935,
has these characteristics in common: . -

“Fascism is .a, most ferocious attack by capital on the mass
of the working people;

“Fascism is unbridled chauvinism and annexationist war;

“Fascism is rabid reaction and counter—revo1ution; V

Why does the danger of fascism increase in the United States
at this particular time? What factors impel monopoly capital,
spearheaded by its most extreme and bellicose sections, to
move toward fascism? _ A '

The ﬁrst and most decisive factor is the special position of
U.S. capitalism in the postwar period, in which the general
crisis of world capitalism has become deeper and more acute.

.The United States emerged from the war stronger militarily

and, in certain respects, economically. (T-he productive capa-
city of the U.S. increased 5o.per cent -during the war, etc.)

At the same time, world capitalism was much weakened in
the course of -the war. Fascist imperialism was shattered in
Germany, Japan and Italy. Britain and France were reduced
to second-rate powers. New People’s Democracies, arose in
Eastern Europe. Despiteits great human and material losses,
the Soviet‘ Union came out of the war with its socialist system
strengthened and its international inﬂuence tremendously
enhanced. '

The U.S. monopolies, with their swollen proﬁts and in-
creased- productive capacity, face a relatively restricted home
market and a shrinking capitalist sector of the world. Their
“solution”-is to embarkon an aggressive program of im-
perialist expansion and intervention. They seek to bolster and
restore capitalism in Europe and Asia, under U.S. hegemony.
They prepare for a new world war to attain world domination.

Such an ultra-reactionary foreign policy cannot be carried
through without complementary domestic measures. There-
fore, the monopolistsstrive ‘to imilitarize the country, curb

~ labor, illegalize the Communist Party, and smash the anti-war,

anti-imperialist people's coalition and opposition. That is
why monopoly reaction turns to fascism.

The second factor is connected with the ﬁrst. American
monopoly is haunted by the specter of the coming economic

l0

 

 

crisis, by the rapid maturing of the first postwar cyclical crisis
of overproduction.

In an effort to avert or postpone the outbreak of the crisis,
and to cushion its effects in the interests of Big Business,
monopoly is organizing a war preparations economy, an econ-
omy of the Goering type, governed by the principle of “guns
instead of butter.” It resorts to a colossal twenty billion dollar
armaments program. It uses the Marshall Plan to promote
government export subsidies and protection for U.S. monop-
oly’s foreign economic penetration, as well as to further t-he
political enslavement of nations. It is introducingthe Nazi
system of “voluntary” cartel arrangements, whereby the large
corporations controlling basic materials and production are
permitted to work out priorities and the allocation of these
materials to the domestic.and foreign monopoly ﬁrms.ﬁnan-
cially allied with the suppliers. All these measures are being
integrated with the state power in the fashion of Hitler Ger-
many. Thus, there is also taking place an accelerated growth
of state monopoly capitalism.

These measures of monopoly to delay or circumvent the ap-
proaching -cyclical economic crisis assure gigantic monopoly
proﬁts. But for the masses these measures mean that they are
already experiencing some of the hardships and ravaging ef-
fects which are usually connected with a severe economic crisis.

Despite the present relative high levels of employment,
nearly eight million workers now work part-time. Despite
currently higher nominal wages, the real wages and the living
standards of the working people have been reduced through
run-away monetary inﬂation, intensiﬁed speedup and regi-
mentation, as well as heavier taxes. While the production of
weapons of destruction increases, there is a steady decline in
the production of means of production -for peacetime pur-
poses, as well as a critical shortage of many consumers’ goods.

This program of monopoly therefore leads currently to
greater mass impoverishment, exploitation and suffering, and
will make the oncoming economic crisis more devastating and
protracted in character. But it is also a program which, un-

11 -

  
  

._ ..__ 4_._\._ _-.

war preparations economy into a full-blown war economy in
an unjust and disastrous war. .

Confronted with the growing resistance of the masses to this
reactionary program and its logical consequences, the Ameri-
can monopolies are turning toward fascist methods of rule.

Thirdly, and related to the above factors, the postwar drive
of American capitalism toward fascism shows itself in the
unprecedented concentration and centralization of capital
which developed at an unparalleled pace during and after
World War II. The intensity of capitalist exploitation of
labor has been increasing. Not only labor, but the masses of
toiling farmers, as well as small business, have been drawn
ever deeper into t-he clutches of monopoly domination and
oppression. -

Consequently, the internal contradictions of U.S. monopoly
capitalism have sharpened tremendously. These have reached
the point where the domination of the trusts in the economy
and politics of the nation has not only become incompatible
with peace, with the liberty and economic security of the Amer-
ican people, but has also become unacceptable to a growing
section of the labor-progressive camp. A

Fearful of the rising might of the new people’s anti-mo-
nopoly party and coalition, the increased role of working—class
leadership in it and the growing inﬂuence of the Communists,
American monopoly capital is losing faith in the possibility
of governing effectively by bourgeois-democratic methods.
Therefore, the most reactionary monopolies are turning ever
more rapidly toward the introduction of fascist methods of

rule and repression.
=ll= II =3

That is the why of the fascist danger in our country. How
does this danger manifest itself? What are its symptoms‘ and
trends? _

' In the classic fashion set by Hitler, the postwar offensive of

the American trusts shows‘ its fascist colors by ﬂying the ﬂag

of anti-Communism. Like Hitlerism, Wall Street reaction pre-
12

 

 

less checked by the mass struggle for peace, will transform the .1

pares for war under the guise of “preserving” world peace and
democracy from “Soviet imperialist aggression.”

Nazi Germany, presenting itself as a “have-not” nation, pro-
fessed to seek only “room to live in” as justiﬁcation of
its expansionist course. American imperialism, boasting that
the United States neither needs nor seeks new territory, justiﬁes
its expansionism and aggressive military program as self-
defense and benevolent protection of the small nations. Under
this guise a vast military program for aggression to the tune
of over 20 billion dollars, the largest peacetime military
budget in world history, has been adopted.

Hitler proclaimed that Nazi imperialism could not live in
the same world with the socialist system of the U.S.S.R. Amer-
ican imperialism, playing on the anti-fascist sentiments of the
American people, declares that socialism is “Red fascism,”
and that t-he Soviet Union refuses to live at peace with the
capitalist states. Under this guise the U.S. and its satellites
have violated the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, vitiated and
bypassed the U.N., organized an anti-Soviet economic blockade
and embarked on a series of anti-Soviet acts and provocations.

Wherever fascism has come to power, it has incorporated the
most reactionary, warmongering and imperialist elements
of ﬁnance capital into the government, and elevated the
military to positions of power over all aspects of civilian
life. That process is far advanced in our country today. \Val1
Street’s men.have attained positions of decisive importance in
both old parties, Republican and Democratic. They have
secured control of the House of Representatives, where the
extreme reactionaries, like Halleck, Martin, Parnell Thomas
and Rankin, rule the roost. ‘Extreme pro-fascists and war-
mongers like Forrestal and Royal are appointed to high public
oﬂice, or, like Dulles, shape policy in a semi-official capacity.

From these controlling heights, the bipartisan pro-fascists
and warmongers advance their military, economic and political
preparations for expansionist adventures and an anti-Soviet
war. This is true not only in matters of foreign policy but
also in the efforts of the U.S. monopolists to use their control

13

  

and -to transform the peacetime economy of the country to
a pro-fascist war economy.

Wall Street is subverting the Bill of Rights, as well as using
the Constitution and the organs of Government to promote
its reactionary and fascist aims. With the “loyalty” order and
the “subversive lists,” the pro—fascist monopolies have begun
to practice the Nazi-like rule by decree. The House Un-Amer-
ican Committee, never a legislative body, has passed from
dangerous fascist propaganda to illegal, punitive measures
against the Communists, trade unionists and othermilitant
progressives. '

On the legislative front, the pro—fascists have succeeded in
enacting the evil Taft-Hartley Law, which is seriously crippling
and undermining the trade unions and their -capacity, not only
for economic struggle, but for struggle against war and fascism
as well. The introduction of the sinister Mundt-Nixon Bill, and
its passage by the House, as well‘ as the projected re-introduc-
tion of_ this Nazi-like legislationin the early days of the 81st
Congress, signalize a further advance of the fascist drive to
outlaw the Communist Party,’to regulate the unions and the
new Progressive Party, and to -curb or destroy these and
other progressive organizations. Should such a bill become
law, it would signify a most ‘advanced stage in the fascist drive.

In the various states, also, ‘a series of repressive measures
have been passed to pave the way for the advance of fascism:
examples of this are the Callahan Act in Michigan, and the
activities of "the Canwell ‘Committee in the stateof Washington.

There is no ground for any lingering illusion that the courts,
particularly the Supreme Court, can be relied on to “check
and balance” the drive toward fascism. The courts are major
instruments of government :by injunction and coercion, The
lower courts have upheld, and the Supreme Court has refused
to review, the infamous persecutions of the Un-American
Committee. “Leaks” from the Justice Department violate
Grand Jury secrecy, and, with the help of the most reactionary
sections of the press, prejudice Grand Jury proceedings. They

14

of the government to subvert and nullify the Bill of Rights

 

 

result in such monstrous fascist-like frame-ups as the current
indictment of the National Board of the C.P.U.S.A., under
charges of violating the infamous Smith Act. Trial juries,
parti-cularly in the District of Columbia, are directly intimi-
dated by the “loyalty” order, so that verdicts of “guilty" have
become ‘a foregone conclusion in any case involving anti-
fascists. _

Militarization of the country goes hand in hand with the
process of fascization. Not only has the peacetime draft been
enacted in the face of broad popular opposition, but the
military are increasingly intervening in the sciences, uni-
versities, industries and other aspects of civilian life, and plac-
ing them on the “alert,” on a wartime basis.

All these measures to prepare the way for fascism are meet-
ing with growing resistance. In the labor-progressivecamp they
arouse increasing uneasiness and mass opposition, even though
their full signiﬁcance is not everywhere adequately grasped.

=l(< , ﬁt #

While this and more is going on, the open advocates of fas-
cism are trying to supplement government repression‘ with a
reactionary mass movement. They are instigating a campaign
of terror .and violence against the working class, the trade
unions and the Communist Party.

The organization of violent, extra-parliamentary actions
has a special signiﬁcance today. Whether undertaken by the
American Legion, -the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Catholic
War Veterans, the Ku Klux Klan or chauvinist elements
among the nationality /groups, this activity is designed to
provide American fascism with a mass base.

At the same time, the most extreme fascistic elements in the
country are waging a mass political—ideological offensive" to
bring labor, farm, church and nationality group organi-
zations under fascist inﬂuence. Shouting the battle cry of
anti-Communism and anti-Sovietism, these forces are propa-
gating chauvinist, white-supremacist, anti—labor, anti-Semitic
and anti-Negro views. A

15

What does all this add up to? Are these just straws in the
usual reactionary wind that blows “after every war”? If we put
these jig-saw pieces together, do we see nothing more than the
ordinary reactionary offensive of monopoly?

Clearly, the answer is no. These are moves designed to pave
the way for fascism. They are the organic parts of the fascist
offensive of American monopoly capital andxits preparations
for a new world war.

Yet it would be profoundly wrong in analysis and highly
dangerous in policy to assume that this drive of Wall Street

toward war and fascism has already reached its goal. Nor I

should it be assumed that the outbreak of war is necessarily
and inevitably contingent upon the establishment of fascism,
or that the ushering in of fascism is necessarily and inevitably
contingent upon the outbreak of war. The reactionary and
warmongering policies and measures of the trusts and their

bipartisan political agents are facilitating and promoting the '

drive toward world war and the internal process of militariza-
tion and fascization now under way. This is a fact. But fascism
has not yet triumphed! Nor is World War III and the victory
of fascism in the United States inevitable. These, too, are
facts of great importance.

3I= =l|= ‘ =I=

We have considered some of the main factors impelling
American monopoly capitalism toward war and fascism, and

the manifestations and gravity of the fascist danger. Now we '

must ask why, in t-he postwar period, the monopolies have
made such alarming advances in their drive toward fascism,
and hence toward war.

After the defeat of the Axis powers, the anti-imperialist
camp advanced on a world scale, and its socialist sector has
been strengthened. In our country, the ﬁghting spirit of the
American workers and progressives has been demonstrated in
the development of the new people’s party, in the unfold-
ing of powerful economic struggles, in the reconstitution of the
Communist Party on a Marxist.-Leninist basis, and in an up-

16

 

surge in the national liberation movement of the Negro peo-
ple. Why, then, has the reactionary offensive of Big Business
made headway, and why has the danger. of fascism become so
threatening? -

For one thing, -the reactionary postwar drive of American
capital, which coincided with the death of Roosevelt, brought
the breakup of the old Roosevelt-labor-progressive coalition.
The majority of organized labor, which followed and was
dependent on Roosevelt and the Democratic Party, was un-
prepared—in the ﬁrst phase of the postwar period—to come
forward as an independent class force. As a result largely of
social-democratic inﬂuences, and partly because of the harm-
ful consequences of our former revisionist policies, as well as

because of the limited base and inﬂuence of our Party in the _

labor movement, labor in the early postwar period was not
yet ready‘ ideologically or mobilized politically, to forge a
new people’s anti-imperialist coalition under working-class
leadership. The mass of the workers, who learn the hard way
in the school of experience, were, at ﬁrst, reluctant to break
with Truman and the Democrats. It took them quite a while
to realize that Truman and the Democrats had already broken

with labor, and with the progressive features of.Roosevelt’s

policies.

It is true that after we repudiated Browderism and re-.

constituted our Party as a Marxist vanguard party, we re-
oriented with relative promptness to the realities of the post-
war situation. X/Ve steered a course of uncompromising strug-
gle against American imperialism and its political spokesmen,
even though we did not" in the ﬁrst postwar months draw all
the practical political conclusions from our correct estimate
of the new situation and the need to forge a new people’s coali-
tion of which the working class would be the backbone and
eventual leader. Because of this we were able to inﬂuence only
a minority in the C.I.O.—albeit a sizable and inﬂuential
minority—‘and only very negligible forces in the A. F. of L.
However, we did succeed in reaching and inﬂuencing a more
substantial section of the Negro people and key sections of the

.17

intellectuals and professionals. Nonetheless, this delay in the
regrouping of the labor, democratic and anti-imperialist forces
enabled monopoly reaction to gain c-onsiderable ground in its
turn toward war and fascism. .

Secondly, the forces of fascism advanced on many fronts
because they were able to break through on the ideological
front. Wall Street’s gargantuan anti-Communist and anti-
Soviet propaganda war made some inroads among certain sec-
tions of labor and the middle -classes. Masses of people who
want pea-ce have been deluded into believing that the cold war
will avert a shooting war, and that the atom bomb, plus a huge
armaments program, are defensive weapons which will assure
peace by discouraging “potential aggressors.”

Millions who fear mass unemployment and the impending
crisis have been sold on the Marshall Plan, as a measure to
ensure American prosperity and European recovery. Large
sections of the population have been duped by the foul lie
that Communism is “totalitarianism” of the Left, and so they
have fallen victim to all kinds ‘of anti-Communist poison.
The temporary successes of its psychological warfarehave also
enabled_ pro-fascist reaction to advance.

Most importantly, this postwar drive of monopoly reaction
toward fascism and war has been aided and abetted by the
reformist and social-democratic lieutenants of monopoly.
These agents of the class enemy have succeeded up to now in
maintaining and deepening the split in the ranks of the work-
ing class, and especially in the trade unionlmovement. Con-
sequently, the A. F. of Land C.I.O. remain divided. The
C.I.O. national leadership is engaged in bitter warfare against
the C.I.O. Left Wing. And political divisions in the ranks of
labor, fomented largely by the social-reform‘is'tsV and Social-
Democrats, manifest themselves in a particularly dangerous
manner in this year's» national elections. e

Clearly, the danger of fascism has been heightened by the
class collaboration policies pursued by the ofﬁcial national
leadership of the trade union movement, by the national lead-
ers ofmost farm organizations and of most of the mass youth,

’ 18 '

 

 

women’s and fraternal organizations. This class collaboration
policy expresses itself in support for the Marshall Plan and
the armaments program, adherence to the two-party system of
Big Business, Red-baiting and anti—Soviet activity. It shows"
itself in the Murray-Tobin counsel to adopt a no-strike policy.
It leads to the spectacle of trade union leaders who are against
wage increases if the corporations are against them. It results
in Capitulation to the Taft-Hartley Act and passive acceptance
of injunctions. It means holding the -trade unions back from
active opposition to the various reactionary measures through
which big capital, its government and Congress pave the way
to fascism. It leads to the ‘betrayal of international working-
class solidarity in the struggle for peace and democracy.

Thus, even where leaders like Murray and Green formally
oppose such pro-fascist steps as the Taft-Hartley Law and the
Mundt Bill, their opposition is purely formal and perfunctory.
They discourage and head off militant mass actions by the
workers and their allies. They prohibit united front. mass
actions locally and nationally. They compete with the pro-
fascists in Red-baiting the -Communists and other anti-monop-
oly progressives. ‘ -

While, of course, the reactionary leaders in the labor move-
ment bear the responsibility for facilitating the war drive and
fascization policy of the monopolies, the working class, to the
extent that it tolerates such leaders and their policies, partici-
pates in the responsibility for this betrayal ‘of the cause of
labor and the nation. ‘

Finally, the Left Wing of the labor movement, including
certain Communist leaders, also bears a share of responsibility
for the fact that the fascist offensive has not yet met with the
necessary rebuff. Some of the advanced workers have, at times,
underestimated the ﬁghting spirit of the working people. They
have consequently failed to give adequately boldand militant
leadership and to develop a broad united front from below
on such issues as the ﬁght for peace, against Taft-Hartleyism,
for the rights of the N-egro people and of the Communists, etc.

Other sections of t-he Left Wing, while developing a militant

. 19

wage and strike policy, have manifested strong tendencies to,
ward economism. In particular, they hav-e failed to exercise

‘the necessary leadership in promoting and gu.iding_the build-

ing of the new people’s party, and in developing a ﬁghting al-
liance between labor and its popular allies, the Negro people
and the mass of the working farmers and city middle classes.»

#3 # =l=

Division, confusion and backwardness still exist in the labor
and progressive movements. We cannot gloss over these factors
which enable the most aggressive and reactionary monopolies
to press forward and advance the drive to fascism and war.

‘But neither can weiunderestimate the favorable,aspects of
the international situation, especially the great and growing
power of the world anti-imperialist camp. Nor can we fail to
appreciate fully t-he new trends in, and the great strength
and potential ﬁghting capacity of, the American working
class and the entire anti-fascist and anti-imperialist camp.
We must not fail to take into account the growing alert-
néss of our own Party to its vanguard role and tasks. This
new‘ understanding of the indispensable vanguard role of
our Party to assure the establishment of working-class leader-
ship in the people's coalition and struggles is bound_ to bring

Chapter I I

THE UNITED PEOPLES FRON'I'

Is IT POSSIBLE to beat back the offensive of Big Business, to
check and defeat Wall Street's drive toward war and fascism?
Yes, this is possible—if labor adopts an independent cla_ss
position and comes forward as the staunchest defender of the
-nation, as the most stalwart champion of peace, democracy and
social progress.
In this connection it is important to note certain marked

and basic differences between the prewar and the postwar

aspects of the struggle against fascism.

Prior to,World War II, t-he chief instigators of world fascism
and imperialist war were Nazi Germany and militarist Japan
and_their supporters among the pro-fascist monopolies in the
U.S." Today the principal center of world reaction, and thus
the main instigator of fascism and war, is American imperial-
ism, is Wall Street.

Prior to_ World War II and especially during the anti-Axis
war, sections of the American bourgeoisie, those which sup-
ported and worked through the Roosevelt Administration,
sought to curb or eliminate their imperialist rivals—fascist
Germany and Japan. At that time the main ﬁre of the anti-
fascist and democratic coalition within the U.S. was directed
primarily against the anti-Comintern Axis abroad, and, on
the home front, against the most reactionary economic royalists,
the appeasers of fascism, who opposed Roosevelt,. the New
Deal and its labor supporters.

Today the anti-fascist and anti-war coalition is directed not

21

   

only against the Munichite, pro-Axis opponents of Roosevelt-
the Hearsts and Du Ponts; it is directed equally against all
monopolists. For, today, after the military defeat of Ger-
many and Japan, all sections of monopoly 'capital—despite
their partisan, vested interests and tactical differences—have
common imperialist objectives, and toward that end pursue
a bipartisan war program for world domination. -

A paramount tactical conclusion to be drawn from’ this
reality, in the struggle to defeat the postwar dangers of war
and fascism, is the need, as our Party has emphasized since
1945, to forge both the widest militant united front of struggle
of the working class and the broadcast democratic, ‘anti-
monopoly people's coalition under labor's leadership.

In place of the old Roosevelt-labor-progressive coalition, led
by the anti-Axis section of the bourgeoisie, it is essential to
develop further and reinforce a new type of progressive, peo-
ple’s coalition such as is now arising. This coalition must be
not merely anti-fascist, but anti—imperia1ist and anti~monopoly.
Within it, the working class, instead of"tail-ending, as in the
New Deal period, must assume the position of the leading
social force. Therefore, the leadership cannot be of the type
that headed the previous loose, democratic coalition which

was led ‘by Roosevelt and the New Deal Democrats. To halt

the drive toward fascism and war, the new peoples coalition
must be led by the working class and its most class-conscious
sector. V

And here it should be noted, while certain sections of the
bourgeoisie consider that American capitalism may still ad-
vance its imperialist policies by methods of bourgeois democ-
racy within the country, and therefore may express doubts
about, or even vote against, a Mundt Bill—they cannot be
relied upon to lead or wage effective opposition to the
pro.-fascist drive of the most reactionary forces. These bour-
geois elements favor and support the Truman-Marshall-Dulles
bipartisan foreign policy. Hence, they vacillate, temporize
and in the end go along with t-he domestic program of
extreme reaction. ‘

22

 

 

 

At times the differences and conflicts between these bour-
geois elements and the most aggressive circles of monopoly may
assume considerable importance and may be used by the anti-
imperialist and anti-fascist camp. But this can be done only if
labor pursues an independent working-class policy and relies
on its own strength and that of its natural allies.

Is it possible for the American working class to measure up
to its historic" postwar responsibilities and to lead the great
majority of America’s working people in united mass struggle
to avert the growing menace of war and fascism? Is it pos-
sible to do this when labor’s ranks are so sharply divided and
confused and when sections of the labor movement are in-
fected with the virus of class collaboration and 'chauvinism?~

Yes, this is possib1e—if the Communists and other progres-
sive workers imbue the working class -and “i'ts"popular allies
with conﬁdence in their own strength, leadership and ﬁghting
capacity. This is possible if they utilize labor’s experience with
the Taft—Hartley injunctions, with the bipartisan armament
and tax program and with the Truman-Marshall doctrines, to
cultivate ‘ the class consciousness of the working class and
systematically forge militant united labor action and a more
powerful people’s anti-monopoly coalition led by the pro-
gressive labor movement. This is possible if they defend and
help build their Marxist, vanguard party, the Communist
Party.

There is good ground for such conﬁdence. The workers and
common people of America don’t want fascism or war. Their
strong. democratic and revolutionary traditions have implanted
in them both the desire for peace and progress and the will
tostruggle for the attainment. of their aims.

The organized trade unions have immense potential
strength. They have a ‘great capacity for militant class strug-
gles, as shown in the three postwar rounds of wage ﬁghts.

The progressive .workers and the entire anti-imperialist
camp will gain in self-conﬁdence to the extent that they
recognize and rely on that which is new and rising in the labor
movement and the political life of the country.

.23

 

  
 
 

There is a new tide of independent political action rising
in the ranks of labor. The Progressive Party is developing
as a mass people’s party and comes increasingly under labor’s
inﬂuence. And in this situation it is of no small consequence
that our Communist Party shows a new political maturity and
a growing capacity to ﬁght and to inﬂuence events.

Powerful allies are moving in a new way toward the working
class and its Communist vanguard. Among these are the Ne-
gro people, carried toward united action by the upsurge of
their liberation movement and by the increased activity of the

labor-progressive camp in behalf of Negro rights. Among these.

are millions of .working farmers, moved by -their anger against
the trusts and their desire for peace. Among these are the
many intellectuals-and professionals who see fascismas the
deadly enemy of science ‘and culture. Among these, too, are
the anti-imperialist masses of the youth, women and of the

national groups, especially of the American Slav and Jewish ’

people. *

These popular forces constitute the labor-progressive camp.
Uni-ted under labor’s leadership, pursuing a ﬁghting policy,
and aligned with the anti-imperialist forces of all nations, they
can block the -establishment of a fascist dictatorship and help
prevent a third world war.

Favorable conditions do not, however, in themselves guar-
antee a favorable outcome. It is the human beings, and in the
ﬁrst place the class-conscious workers, who‘ must guarantee
that what can be done, is done. A

Therefore, the American working class, and especially its
Communist vanguard, must show itself in action as the champ-
ion of the nation’s interests and of peace, as the best ﬁghter
for the social welfare and progress of the immense majority
of the American people. It must unite its own ranks in mili-
tant struggle» and gather around itself all patriotic and demo-
cratic elements. It must reinforce the democratic anti-mo-
nopoly and anti‘-war coalition now emerging, and give it ﬁght-
ing working-class leadership. .

This is the path of unity of action, of class struggle. The

24

 

path of class collaboration does not lead to united front ac-
tion against fascism. It leads only to trai-torous complicity in
Wall Street’s drive to war. and the establishment of a fascist
dictatorship. _

Clearly, we cannot speak seriously of defeating fascism with-
out determining how the disastrous policy of class ‘collabora-
tion can be routed. Unfortunately, this evil cannot be eradi-
cated at one fell swoop by adopting a resolution reading it out
of.the labor movement.

On the contrary, labor and its al1ies——and especially its Com-
munist vanguard—must come to grips with -the policy of class
collaboration whenever and wherever it shows itself. The key

to its exposure and defeat lies not only in a sustained and ef--

fective political-ideological struggle, essential as this is, but
above all in the adoption of a policy of class struggle and the
organization of mass resistance to each and every reactionary
measure advanced by.monopoly and its government. _

A united class struggle policy means combating every
pro-fascist and warmongering assault, means not letting the
monopolists get away with anything. It means a ﬁght against
every piece of reactionary legislation -that bobs up in Con-
gress, o_r’in the states and municipalities. It means a ﬁght
against every threatened wage cut; against every attack on
and discrimination against the Negro people and the Jewish
people; against every penny rise‘ in the price of milk, or
nickel rise in fare. -

It means a ﬁght against every move to militarize the coun-
try or undermine civil liberties. It means a resolute struggle
against the pro-fascist Mundt-Ferguson Bill to register and
outlaw our Party and all so-called “Communist front” organi-
zations. It requires a determined struggle against the .mon-
strous frame-up of the Communist Party under the anti-labor
Smith Act. It means a ﬁght against every betrayal of peace by
the advocates of the jingoist, imperialist, bipartisan foreign
policy. ‘

And it means that the labor movement as a whole must en-
gage in united action whenever one of its component parts is

25

  
  

under attack. A most dangerous and hidden form of class
collaboration consists in permitting the monopolies to concen-
trate their forces against the Communist Party,’ or against this
or that trade union or mass organization and decimate them
one at a time, while their labor and progressive allies do
nothing, or conﬁne themselves to cheering from the sidelines.

To defeat the policy of class collaboration means. to rally
the whole labor movement and its allies in defense of the pack-
inghouse workers_, the miners, the typographical workers, the
maritime workers, when they are menaced by Taft-Hartley de-

'crees, injunctions or elections. I-t means to reject and cast

aside the program of company unionism in labor’s politics
as well as in its wage struggles. It means to combat and eradi-
cate from the labor movement all anti-Communist policies and
practices——the Typhoid Marys planted in labor’s ranlgs by its
enemies, by the reactionaries and pro-fascists. It requires that
every section of the labor-progressive camp get into -the ﬁght
against all the victims of Clark’s subversive lists, the loyalty
purges, the House Un—American Committee,» and the Smith
Act or a Mu-ndt bill.

Labor and the American people have some tried and trusty
slogans. that must now again be carried into battle. Now more
than ever, “An injury to one is. an injury to all!” Now, as
always, “In union there is strength!” i

It is no easy matter to break through the barriers of trade
union bureaucracy and reformism, and the-political and craft
differences which stand: between the masses of the workers and
a correct, ﬁghting policy. But it can be done. What it takes
is a bold and systematic application of the tactic of -the united
front of struggle from below,‘ combined with a resolute effort
to enlist in commonaction every leader, group and mass or-
ganization opposed to war and fascism, irrespective of all other
differences.

In other ' words, the Communists and other progressives
must rely on the rank and ﬁle, go to them with the issues, ex-
plain what is what, and organize them. This requires or-
ganization and leadership and plenty of leg work. It espe-

26 -

 

 

 

cially requires initiative and steadfastness in ﬁghting for the
most urgent economic and political demands of the workers

and common people.

In this connection, and precisely to reinforce and extend the
struggle for peace and democracy, the Left Wing in the labor-
progressive movement must devote far more attention to devel-
oping mass actions for the economic needs of the masses, es-
pe-cially for the demands of the most exploited sections of the

working people: the Negro, Mexican-Americans, youth, and
women workers, and white-collar workers in industry, the .

professions and government. And how can labor win sorely
needed allies for its ﬁght against Taft-Hartleyism and speed-
up, for wage and salary increases? How can it strengthen the
anti-fascist and anti-monopoly people's coalition and enhance
its leadership‘ within it? To achieve this, la"-bor must come
forward decisively and organize a nation—wide people's cam-
paign in behalf of genuine price and rent controls, lower
taxes and an adequate and non-discriminatory federal and
state housing,’ veterans, education, -health and social security
program.

The united front from below is not the easiest tactic to
apply but it can be organized—and it. certainly pays big politi-
cal dividends. In the Chrysler strike it thwarted the G.M. cost-
of-living wage pattern for robbing all the auto workers, and,
together_ with the heroic struggle of the packinghouse workers,
it broke the wage freeze in industry. It saved the life of Mrs.
Ingram and her sons and advanced the whole struggle for

Negro rights. It promoted a grass roots mass movement which’

helped initiate the new people’s‘ peace party, over the heads
of the -social-democratic leaders and trade union reformists
and against their class collaboration policies.

Moreover, this was the tactic that upset reaction’s time—table
for outlawing our Communist Party by temporarily defeating
the Mundt—Nixon Bill. ‘

Here we can proﬁtably comparetwo tactics, two policies-
that employed in the struggle against the N.A.M.’s Taft-

 The FASCIST DANGER

 and’ How To Combat It  

by Eugene Dennis

Hartley Bill, and that which won the ﬁrst round in the struggle
against the pro-fascist Mundt Bill.
In the Taft-Hartley ﬁght, the C.I.O., A. F. of L. and Railway

Brotherhoods voiced their official opposition, while the Com- .

munists were active in -trying to launch an effective mass move-
ment. Labor’s top leadership organized a legislative lobby and
launched a public relations’ campaign.

But the oﬂicialdom of labor rejected every proposal for mili-
tant, united front, mass action. Both major trade union centers
relied on the Democrats in Congress to vote against the Taft-
Hartley Bill and on Truman to veto it. Both preferred parallel
activity to joint action and co-operation with labor’s allies.

In the ﬁght against the Mundt Bill, the Communist Party
displayed a maximum of political and organizing initiative.
So did a numberof other progressive groups, particularly the
Wallace forces. This initiative and leadership succeeded in

developing a broad united front campaign embracing a wide

variety of labor and non-labor groups which differed from
one another on many other questions. This.campaign involved
the Communist Party, the N.A.A.C.P., many A. F. of L. and
C.I.O. unions, the Progressive Party, the American Youth for
Democracy and the American Veterans Committee, many na-
tionality and fraternal organizations, as well as many conserva-
tive public ofli-cials, church groups and even the Americans for
Democratic Action. Unquestionably, these united actions stim-
ulated much more widespread parallel action than would
otherwise have developed against the Mundt Bill.

Not only was there extensive legislative and lobbying ac-
tivity, but there was also broad demonstrative mass action.
This was organized in many states. Nationally, it reached its
high points in the Negro people’s Non-Partisan March on
Washington on June 2, and in the subsequent mass veterans’
lobby on housing. _

Two tactics and policies: two results. In the ﬁrst, a policy
of reliance upon a capitalist‘ party and business-as-usual tactics,
with the usual Red-baiting, jurisdictional back-biting and
timidity. Result: the Taft-Hartley Bill became law.

_But in the second instance, the pursuance of a militant,

all-inclusive united front ‘tactic and policy. Result: the tem-

porary defeat of the Mundt Bill.

It is plain which policy, which tactic, the working class and
its allies must pursue and develop, especially as the pro-fas-
cists will again seek to enact the Mundt-Ferguson Bill.

It is clear, too, that the organization and leadership of the
united front of struggle from below, which is of decisive im-
portance, is not an end in itself. It must be pursued with the
aim of drawing the widest masses, their organizations and sec-
tions of their leaders into joint struggle -against the attacks
of capital, against the drive toward fascism and war. It must
be directed to inﬂuence the policies of the trade unions and
other mass organizations, no less than to inﬂuence the foreign
and domestic policy of -the government and Congress. *

=|l= it it

But militant self-defense is not all that is required for the
working class to mobilizeand unite its ranks and to achieve
decisive leadership in the people’s coalition of struggle against
fascism and war. It is equally necessary that the Communists
and other advanced workers search out the ways and means to
counter-attack and to go over to the counter-offensive.

Attack is still the best defense, in politics as well as in war.
And the masses will more readily respond to the call to struggle
when they see that it involves not only preserving what they
have won, but making new gains as well. ~

Therefore, for example, it is not enough to call for the de-
fense of the Bill of Rights. The Negro people especially de-
mand that it be enforced and extended. They demand guaran-
tees that their right to vote in all primaries and elections will
be respected now, this year. To defend the ‘rights of the Negro
people, to strengthen the unity of Negro and white workers
and progressives, and hence the people’s coalition—it is neces-
sary for labor carefully to prepare and initiate mass demonstra-
tions, political mass strikes and other state and nationwide
campaigns that will demand and secure full suffrage for the

29

  

Negro people, prosecution ofpall lynchers, an end to Jim Crow
in the army and civilian life, and the enactment of federal
measures to aid and provide land to all tenant farmers and
sharecroppers, especially to the Negroes in the South.

Surely, neither we Communists nor the other anti-fascist
victims of the Department of Justice and the Un-American
Committee can content ourselves with defensive action in the
courts or Congress. What_ is needed here is an‘ all-out mass
campaign that will prevent not only the adoption of a Mundt-
Ferguson Bill, but will also secure the dismissal of the Grand
Jury indictments against our Party, repeal the “loyalty order”
and the Smith Act, impeach Tom Clark, abolish the Un-
American Committee, and bring ‘about the criminal indict-
ment and prosecution of the warmongers, the lynchers and the
anti-Semites.

Of course it is essential that the trade unions, for their self-
preservation, refuse to" comply with the Taft.-Hartley Act and
work for its repeal. But that is far from enough to save the
labor movement from strangulation and slow death. Shop, in-
dustry and national work stoppages must be organized on a
mass scale and other suitable mass actions‘ must be adopted
to resist and defeat all Taft-Hartley injunctions, raids and
rigged elections. ' ~

Pro-labor Democrats say they are for repeal of the Taft-
Hartley Act. But what is to replace it? Labor must now set
in motion a grass roots movement to secure the enactment and
enforcement of a more progressive Wagner Labor Relations
Act, andto guarantee by united mass action that there will
be no political, trade union, racial or religious discrimination
in public or private employment. ‘ ‘ t

It is not enough to expose and condemn the monopolies,
and resist their many-sided offensive, vital as this exposure is.

' The anti-monopoly people’s coalition must hit the‘ trusts where

they are most vulnerable, must hit them often and hit them
hard. Millions must be rallied to-ﬁght for a people’s tax ‘pro-
gram and a ceiling on corporate proﬁts. They must be called
to struggle for lower freight and passenger rates and for the

30

a

 

 

3

- abolition of all monopoly patents, grain and commodity specu-

lation, restrictive ﬁnancial controls and restraints of trade.
They must be enlisted now in a mass movement to end all
cartelagreements and practices, and to curb drastically the
powers of monopoly. A

How does one wage a serious struggle against the “cold
war,” Wall Street’s armament program and its Marshall Plan?
Of course, it is essential resolutely to oppose every step and
manifestation of the bipartisan war policy. Without this it
would be impossible to wage an effective struggle against war
and fascism. But more is required. Labor and the people’s
coalition must now militantly crusade for an affirmative pro-
gram of struggle for peace.

Such a program exists, and has wide support. It includes I

as its corners-tone the restoration of American-Soviet co-opera-'
tion through friendly negotiations based on the fulﬁllment
of the Potsdam and Yalta agreements; the reinstitution of the
meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers; and a speedy
Four Power peace settlement with Germany and Japan, on the
basis of guaranteeing the complete democratization and de-
militarization of these countries. This positive peace program
also includes putting an end to U.S. by-passing and undermin-
ing of ‘the U.N., especially to its military intervention in China
and Greece. It includes achieving agreement on universal
disarmament; prohibition of the manufacture, stockpiling and
use of atomic weapons; and carrying out the U.N. decisions
to curb the warmongers and defend the independence and na-
tional sovereignty of Israel. '*

Yes, the people have a peace program. But now it is neces-
sary, as Comrade Foster has repeatedly stressed, for labor, es-
pecially the trade unions, to ﬁght for this program by organiz-
ing on all levels and everywhere a powerful, united front
mass movement that will voice the popular demand for peace
through petitions, mass conferences, meetings and demonstra-
tions. It'is necessary to create a broader peace front that can
draw into struggle new millions of workers, youth, veterans,
women and churchmen, that can secure the active support of

31

 
 

/

millions of people, regardless of whether they are Republicans‘

or Democrats, Progressives or Communists.

Furthermore, the ﬁght for these speciﬁc anti-war proposals
will be immeasurably strengthened if the peace forces bring
forward a positive program of concrete demands for beneﬁts
of which the war economy is robbing the American people.
Thus, the over-all ﬁght for peace should and can be buttressed
by a mass movement determined drastically to reduce the arma-
ments program and to secure a 15 billion dollar, three-year
federal low-cost housing program.

These and other points of an immediate program of action,
which are supported by the Progressive Party, many labor,
Negro and other people’s organizations—-as well as by the Com-
munist Party—furnish a wide area for common agreement and

. action by the labor-progressive camp. The struggle for these

demands will bolster the resistance of labor and the an-ti-
monopoly coalition and will enable it to counter-attack and
go over to the counter-offensive. .

Yet, side by side with this, we Communists and other class-
conscious workers should advance additional points of a posi-
tive, ﬁghting, working-class and people’s united front program.
We should bring forward a program that will give the working
class and its popular allies a clear perspective and policy for
drastically curbing the power of monopoly capital, and achiev-
ing governmental power for the people’s coalition, and thus
for eﬁectively undermining the social and economic basis of
fascism and extending democracy.

At the heart of such a program are the proposals to.nationa1-
ize the banks and insurance companies, and the steel, railroad
and mining industries, as well as to institute basic land reforms,
especially. in the South. Such proposals voice a widespread
popular demand. But if they are not to breed illusions and play
into the hands of demagogues and social-reformists—or even
assist in the process_of fascization of the country—-they must
be advanced as an organic part of the struggle for a govern-

" ment based on the developing people’s anti—monopoly coali-

tion and led by the working class.
. 32 .

 

 

.%}p."“ ‘

Demands for nationalization which are advanced irrespective
of time, place and struggle, and regardless of governmental
power, democratic controls and the- right of labor to organize,
bargain collectively and strike——serve today to promote only
the interests of the monopolies, including the accelerated
growth of state monopoly capitalism, as symbolized by the
present reactionarygovernment monopoly control and opera-
tion of atomic energy development.

Contrariwise, the struggle for nationalization of the basic
industries and the banks, when integrated with the struggle of
the working class and its allies for a democratic people’s
government, can reinforce the people’s mass movement to
curb the monopolies, pro—fascists and warmongers today. It
can advance the struggle of labor and the people to higher
levels and in the direction of socialism.

# # it

Finally, if the working class is to come forward as the most
reliable leader in the struggle against fascism and war, it must
initiate and sustain a great political-ideological counter-offen-
sive against the chauvinist propaganda and psychological war-
fare carried on by the forces of reaction, fascism and war

. under the banner of anti-Communism.

Unless the labor and anti-imperialist camp——from indepen-
dents and progressives to Communists—really unmasks and
counteracts the white supremacist and Red-baiting program of
the monopolies; unless it shows the Nazi-like course and aims
of Wall Street's anti—Communist crusade; unless it steadfastly
promotes the unity of action of non-«Communist progressives

‘ and Communists—unless this is done the pro-fascists and war-

mongers will continue to make headway. Unless this is done
the reactionaries will continue to employ and take advantage
of Hitler’s secret weapon—the virus of anti-Communism—so as
to perpetuate and create prejudices, confusion and division in
labor’s ranks and among the people as a whole, so that they
may press forward to monopoly’s “American Century” of im-
perialist expansion, war and fascism.

33

 

Here, we Communists, clearly, have aspecial responsibility '
to help equip labor and its allies with the ideological weap-
ons for waging this counter-offensive, a responsibility which in
turn requires the strengthening and building of the Commu-
nist Party, including a radical improvement of our theoretical
and ideological activity so as to enable the people’s coalition
to win the battle of ideas in the struggle against the monopo-
lies, war and fascism.

At this point, I would like to pass on to a consideration
of a most crucial political battle now being waged in. the
people’s struggle against war and fascism.

34

 

Chapter II I

THE 1948 ELECTIONS I

ONE or THE BIG POSTWAR BATTLES between reaction and prog-

ress is being fought out in this year’s national election. ‘ The

.election outcome will directly affect the tempo of monopo1y’s

drive toward war and fascism. The election campaign, and'its
results, will inﬂuence the course of coming events and the prog-
ress of political re-alignment. This electoral struggle will deter-
mine whether or not key sections of the American working
class and people are now ready to break away from capital's
.two—party system, and move toward an independent position
under labor’s leadership. ‘ .

In this election there are three main» political parties, but
only two sides. On oneside there are the two main parties
of monopoly, the Democrats and Repu.blie'ans. «These are the
chief parties of imperialist reaction and war, the parties of the
bipartisan “get tough” policy—get tough with Russia and get
tough with-: labor. These are the parties which, under the
banner of anti-Communism, are paving the way toward fas-
cism and World War III. I '

In this camp the Dewey-Warren ticketrepresents a G.O.P.'

internal compromise. These‘ bipartisan war candidates were
selected because they are less discredited than their rivals of
the Taft-Martin-Hoover ilk. But Dewey and Warren are sup-

'35

ported by "the Chase National Bank, the Rockefellers, the
N.A.M., Hearst and Ford. .

They cannot disclaim the miserable 80th Congress. They
are the men of the party of Taft-Hartleyism, the Mundt-Nixon
Bill, the draft, Knutson’s Big Business tax program, the Bul-
winkle Bill giving new powers to the railroads to ﬂeece the
people, and all bipartisan war measures, including the Mar-
shall Plan. .

In its bid for the Presidency, the G.O.P. is counting on the
voters to decide that now it really is time for a change. Its
main reliance'for mass support is on rural and city middle-class
support, on a sizable vote from the Negro people, veterans, un-
organized workers and some major nationality groups. .

Truman and Barkley, the unwanted men, are the candidates
of the Democratic Party. Partisan compromise, within the
framework of commitment to the bipartisan war policy, la-
bored and brought forth mediocrity.

The Democratic Party is the party of Dillon-Read and cer-
tain other Morgan interests, of the clerical fascists and a ma-
jority of the Southern Bourbons. It was the G.O.P.’s partner in
the crimes of the 80th Congress, and shares equal responsibility
for all bipartisan warmongering. This is the party of strike-

_ breaking in the railroad and mining industries. It is the party

of “thought control” and the “loyalty order.” It,.together with
the G.O.P., is the party ’of betrayal of Israel and the Jewish

people.

The Democrats count on popular resentment against the 80th,

Congress and the'high cost of living, and on the magic of the
F.D.R. tradition which they desecrate. They count on sup-
port from most of the South, the Catholic voters and big sec-
tions of organized labor, the young voters and the Jewish
people. - . ‘

What other groups and forces are at present lined up with
one or the. other party in this single camp?

The leadership-of the major veterans and farm organiza- '

tions, and of many nationality groups, for the most part sup-
port the G.O.P., while a minority support the Democrats. Of

the trade union bureaucracy, both C.I.O. and A. F. of L., a
majority supports the Democrats, a minority the G.O.P. The
A.D.A. and the Liberal Party, while plumping for a rejuve-
nated Democratic Party or a new “liberal” party under social-
democratic inﬂuence after the elections, presently support the
Truman-Barkley ticket. The Socialist Party of Norman
Thomas acts as an auxiliary for the Democrats, supporting the
Marshall Plan and centering its campaign against Wallace. The
counter-revolutionary Trotskyites formally oppose bot-h major
parties, but like the Socialists, they concentrate their main
ﬁre against Wallace and the new -party, as well as against the
Communists;

On the other side, there is the new Progressive Party, which
is becoming a mass people’s party, and already embraces the
most active and politically conscious sections of the new labor
and people’s coalition which is arising in the postwar period.

The new party has a progressive, anti-war and anti-
monopoly program which expresses the immediate demands
of the immense majority of the people. It also has a record. It
crystallized in, and has advanced, Wa1lace’s crusade for peace,
for American-Soviet friendship. It has put up a stubborn ﬁght
for civil liberties and Negro rights. It is beginning to associate
itself with labor’s economic struggles, as in the auto and pack-
inghouse industries.

The new people’s party is supported by the Left Wing and
the other consistent progressives in the ranks of labor, by sub-

' stantial sectors of the Negro people, by_the Communist Party,

as well as by some of the main forces in the Farmers’ Union,
the A.V.C., and the Slav and Jewish groups. It also has the
support of large numbers of youth, veterans and women.

III ‘ II= #

A sharp and vital political-electoral struggle has begun to
unfold. The ﬁght between the G.O.P. and the Democrats, de-
spite its heat and oratorical bitterness, is based on secondary
partisan and vested interests and on minor tactical differences.
But this struggle between the two old parties within a single

37

 “NE!/‘V" Cb}/ENTIJ:RY' PUBLIs}£1:kS, ‘INc .,i   _Njé_w Yqlfk 

 

camp is not decisive. For both contestants underwrite the bi-
partisan war policy. Both pursue the same fundamental anti-
labor and anti-Communist objectives, and both facilitate and
promote the rise of fascism.

In this election, the main political ﬁght develops as a strug-
gle between the camp of the people and the camp of the mo-
nopolies, between the new people’s party and the two old
parties of Big Business. .

This is so because the new Progressive Party and its support-
ers challenge the two-party system itself,.as well as monopoly’s
war program. Thereby they promote a new political re-al'ign- 

“ ment in the country, under the leadership of the progressive 
labor movement.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the very emergence
of the new anti-monopoly people’s party is an expression of the
developing crisis within bourgeois democracy and monopoly’s
two-party system. This -crisis manifests itself most profoundly
within the Democratic Party, though it begins to ﬁnd a certain
reflection within the G.O.P. . ‘

The Democratic Party, whose sixteen years in oﬁice as the
party of government depended in the ﬁrst ‘place upon 1abor’s
support, is most immediately affected by the breakup of the
former Roosevelt—labor coalition—which was facilitated by
Truman's betrayal of the people’s mandate of 1944—and above
all by the new trend toward genuine independent labor po-
litical action. Furthermore, the Democratic Party, which has
always relied on a solid Democratic South, is now torn and
affected by the upsurge and re-alignments taking place among
the Negro people, as well as among many progressive white
Southerners. ’_

Together with the formation of the new people’s party, ‘
the sharpening crisis in the Democratic Party, and above all
in the two-party system, is being reﬂected in the so-called anti- ‘,
Truman “revolt” of the Mississippi, Alabama, and South
Carolina Democratic Party delegates. But the “revolt” of the
Bourbon extremists manifests itself ﬁrst of all because the Ne-
gro national liberation movement in the South has entered

38

a new phase and because the growth of iNegro—white working-
class unity and independent political action is growing both

_in the North and the South. .

The most reactionary Southern Bourbons are opposed to al-
lowing the national Democratic Party to give even lip service
to Negro rights. They feel that .Truman’s demagogy on this
score is too dangerous. They dread the possibilities of the or-

ganizing drive of the C.I.O. and A. F. of L. in the South, and’

particularly they are fearful of‘ the growth of the Progressive
Party. While most of the Southern Democratic “rebels” will
end up supporting Truman and Barkley, they are now bend-
ing every effort to bring pressure on the Democratic Party so as
to avoid even the formal pretense of election promises for a
civil rights program to which the masses respond and for which
they will ﬁght. At the same time the most reactionary Bour-
bons are using their parliamentary “revolt” and campaign for
states rights as _a pretext for conspiring against the Bill of
Rights and for launching a. campaign of terror and vengeance
against the Negro people and their white allies.

Another expression of the current crisis within the Demo-
cratic Party and the two—party system was the short-lived Eisen-
hower boom, which united Southern Bourbons, Northern
machine-Democrats, the A.D.A. crowd, and various C.-I.O. -lead-

V ers in a desperate search for a winning candidate. _

Evidently, big capital ‘is saving Eisenhower for a more acute
national emergency, where he can appear in the guise of a non-
partisan candidate and play the Cincinnatus role of national
savior.

Nonetheless, Big Business seeks to make sure that the crisis in
the Democratic Party does not develop into a death crisis for
the two—party system. Therefore, while placing its money on
the G.O.P. to win, it is doctoring up the Donkey to keep it in
the race and to make the Democrats a formidable “loyal oppo-

sition” after November. And this, too, explains why the mo- V

nopolists encourage their social-reformist and social-demo-
cratic lackeys to support Truman. —
Finally, the developing crisis in the major parties is reﬂected

39

 

in the embittered struggle against‘ the _new people’s party being
waged by the bipartisans and their lieutenants, by most of the
trade union officials and the Social-Democrats.

The Left-wing and popular forces can expect and must pre- i

pare to meet an avalanche of intensiﬁed political opposition
to the new party and its adherents. No. holdsl will be barred.
lntimidations and pressures from within the labor movement,
as well as large—scale provocations, are in the cards, such as
those attempted in the indictment of the National Board of
the Communist Party and in the current “spy” scare.

In this connection, it is obvious that. the government andits
bipartisan colleagues, bent. on saving the two-party system at
all‘ costs, may, during the election campaign, resort to addi-
tional measures to curtail democratic rights generally, and the
rights of the Progressives and Communists in particular.

=X= =)(= =1!‘

What are some of the key problems which the new people’s
party and the labor—progressive camp confront in these vital
elections?

In general, the electoral tasks coin-cide with the -main po-
litical responsibilities which the people face in order‘ to halt
the bipartisan drive toward war and fascism. The Progressive

Party ‘and its labor-democratic supporters, organizing a bold

and systematic ﬁght on issues, can best serve these ends by
developing the people’s resistance to every reactionary, pro-
fascist and war measure, and, basing itself on the central
points of its own progressive program, thus advance the
people’s ﬁght for a democratic, anti.-monopoly domestic and
foreign program.

Inevitably, such a policy will rally support from all demo-
cratic and peace-minded sections of the population. Especially
it will draw into the over-all struggle new sections of. labor,
the Negro people, the farmers and the veterans, who can be
moved int_o united mass action on speciﬁc issues. '

It is necessary of course to crusade on_issues. It is essential,

obviously, to bend every effort to achieve the maximum num-

40

 

ber of votes for Wallace and Taylor and all Progressive Con-
gressional and local candidates. It is also essential that every-
thing be done to build the new party organizationally, as a
grass roots movement, as a mighty shield and bulwark for the
people. A .

To accomplish this, three things are necessary.

First: Now, on the heels of the main party conventions, a
new initiativeis necessary on the part of the advanced workers
to widen the Progressive Party’s trade union base and to
heighten labor’s political leadership and inﬂuence wit-hin the
new party.

-There is no reason to doubt that this can be done. Recent
polls show that nearly two million A. F. of L. and C.I.O. work-
ers already are prepared to support Wallace and the new party.
At present,’ the “lesser evil” theory and passivity in labor’s
ranks stand as serious obstacles to augmenting this ﬁgure. But

A if a sustained and vigorous campaign is undertaken to organize

mass activity around the Progressive Party platform, and to
bury once and for all the "false and disastrous concept of the
“lesser evil” theory in which the jingoist and anti-labor Tru-
man is being palmed off by the trade union bureaucracy as
the re-incarnation of Roosevelt, then it will be possible to win
additional working-class millions for independent political
action, for the new people’s party.

Inoline with this, maximum support is necessar.y to organize
united front Wallace-for-President trade union committees in
every shop, mine and mill, based on active mass support for
the program of the Progressive Party.

Moreover, the Left-wing trade unionists need to put an V

end to all tendencies toward economism, as well as overcome
the harmful practices of giving support to the new party in the

same way as labor supported Roosevelt. So far the progres-

sive labor movement conﬁnes its support for’ the new party to
recommending points of a program for its platform, working
to place it on the ballot, raising money and urging its mem-
bers to vote for Wallace and Taylor.

Today, .labor must not only endorse and give general sup-

port to the Progressive Party. It must participate in and
build the new party from the precinct level on up. It must
not only recommend policy in an advisory capacity, but must
help formulate and execute policy through trade union mem-
bers and leaders of all the organizations and committees of
the new p-arty. Hence, the progressive labor movement should
not only officially support the new party; it should actively 
participate in it, grow with it, and lead it. ‘

Secondz. It is necessary to consolidate and extend the mass _
base and inﬂuence of the Progressive Party among the Negro _ ;?
people. The ratio of independent voters is higher among the
Negro people than among any other group, as is the ratio of
its direct support for Wallace, -But the Negro. vote cannot be
taken for granted, not even by the Progressive Party. 3

Determined efforts are necessary to expose Truman and his .  t
demagogic civil rights program, as well as the betrayal of the E
Negro people by all who settle for this or who try to sell the
G.O.P. demagogy on the civil rights issue as a “lesser evil.”
The new party, as a matter of principle, is duty bound to
develop its election platform as a program of action to ad-
vance the struggle for Negro rights, as well as to bring forward
a larger number of Negro candidates and leaders. If this is
done it will be possible for the new party to secure a wider
and ﬁrmer mass base and following among the Negro people,
and to strengthen the Negro liberation movement and the
people’s coalition as a whole. ’ . °

Third: It is vital for the advanced and progressive workers
to help the new party secure a solid ‘base and mass support
among the working farmers. The establishment of a ﬁrm S‘
alliance between workers and farmers, under labor’s leader- 
ship, is indispensable if the Progressive Party is to acquire ‘
mass strength and effect a major political alignment; if it is-to
effect a serious change in Congress and the government; and y 9
if it is to counteract and combat the new, dangers of war and ‘
fascism. As at no time in its history, the progressive labor
movement" must ﬁnd the ways and means to reach and de-
cisively inﬂuence broad sections of America's farmers. It can

42

if

%

 

‘do this _to the extent that it actively supports the progressive
demands of the farmers, draws them into the struggle for
peace, takes an independent class position and ensures its po-
litical leadership in the Progressive Party.

Fourth: It is imperative that the Communists and other
progressive workers exert their maximum efforts to inﬂuence
the youth to participate in these elections on the side of the
people’s camp. It is as possible as it is necessary to achieve this
vital objective, especialy in View of the strong pro-Wallace cur-
rents already in evidence among the campus youth and large
sections of the veterans and working youth. This undertaking
is made. doubly necessary by the fact that wherever the Left
Wing, in the trade unions has suffered setbacks in the recent
period,’ as in the auto, maritime, and packinghouse industries,
this has been due in no small measure to the neglect of a con-
crete approach on the part of the progressives to the new work-
ers in these industries, the largest percentage of whom are
youth. V

Suffice it to say that progress in the ’48 elections, as well as in
mobilizing for‘ the people’s victory over the fascists and war-
mongers, requires that the Communists and other anti-fascists

redouble their efforts to reach and inﬂuence the youth, to draw.

them fully into the new party and people’s coalition, as well
as to establish a solid Marxist core and base among the young
people. '

Likewise, major attention should be paid to winning the
masses of the national groups, especially of the American-Slav,
-Mexican, -Jewish, —Italian, and —German masses——of whom
large. numbers are attracted to the new puarty’s struggle for
peace and equality, and can be won to support the Progressive
Party and its candidates. V

In carrying on such activity among the national groups, it is
important to pay heed to the varying situations and special
problems that demand a concrete and realistic approach. Thus,
as regards the Jewish people: Among the Jewish workers and
lower middle classes and professional people, the exposure of
Truman and the Democratic Party is themain task. Among

43

 

the upper middle classes and professional circles, the main task '
is to expose the Republican Party. In any event, both old par-

ties must be exposed for theirinsincerity and bipartisan
betrayals of the Jewish people in general and of Israel in
particular. 1 -

=l= it !I=

Today, as never before, the Progressive Party and its ad-

vanced and militant supporters can best promote their elec-_

toral and political objectives if they pursue a bolder united
front policy and strive to break through the existing political
line-ups in the trade unions and other mass organizations,
which certain progressives tend to view as frozen, but which in
reality are quite ﬂuid. This makes necessary joint action be-
tween the supporters of the third party and other progressives
around issues, and the development of the broadest democratic
coalition to support scores of pro-labor and anti-war Congres-
sional and state legislative candidates, irrespective of party
aﬂiliation. In this connection, the proponents of the new party
will undoubtedly make new united front approaches to the
pro-Roosevelt Democrats among the electorate. Many of these,
including certain candidates, will now be more ready to arrive
at agreements with the new party because they are more
skeptical of their political position, and'of the outcome of the
elections, than was the case before the Democratic convention.
. C‘ III ill

Every step taken by the Progressive Party to advance its pro-
gram and build its organization during the campaign and after
the elections will be countered by t-he most extreme Red-
baiting and other efforts to divide the new party. Experience
shows that only if the Progressive Party reinforces its ‘policy
of rejecting Red-baiting can it develop as an all-inclusive
people’s mass party and coalition.

In this connection, it is appropriate to comment on the-

remarks of a leading new party spokesman to the effect that
if we Commun'ists really wanted to help the new party, we
would run a -Communist Presidential ticket. Here the argu-

44

 

ment was advanced that such a step would_lose the new party
100,000 votes, and gain it 3,000,000.

Granting that this spokesman is most sincere in his motive,
his prognostication is at best wishful thinking. It also unwit-
tingly reﬂects the pressures of the anti-Communists.

One of the chief sources of the mass strength and growth
of the Progressive Party is its rejection of Red-baiting, and its
advocacy and develop-ment of a united peace front, inclusive of
Communists. The pro-fascists and warmongers slander and at-
tack the new party not merely because the Communists
support it, but because the Progressive Party champions
a progressive anti-war and anti-monopoly program which
promises to enlist the militant support of millions of anti-
imperialists, non-Communists as well as Communists.

Insofar as the Communist Party is concerned, it gives or
withholds its support to mass movements for principled
reasons. It supports all progressive movements, to the extent
that these are effective instruments for helping defeat reac-
tion, fascism’ and war. It has additional reason to support the
Progressive Party, because the new pe0ple’s party creates con-
ditions favorable to labor’s historic struggle to lead the demo-
cratic movements of the peopleand to ‘advance its independent
class position.

The Communist Party’s support of the progressive policies
and mass campaigns of the new people's party does not alter
the fact that we have fundamental and some tactical differ-
ences with \Vallace and related third party forces.

We are the party of socialism, and repudiate all notions of a
“progressive capitalism.” We foresee that in the future, at
certain moments in the anti-fascist and anti-monopoly strug-
gle, these ideas could become most dangerous.

As the most ardent defenders of the welfare and national

securit of our eo 1e and- the cause of world eace, we are the
Y P P P

most consistent opponents of imperialism and the staunchest
champions of American-Soviet _friendship. Consequently, we
cannot accept the viewpoint of those who ﬁnd both the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R. responsible for the increased war danger. \A7e‘

45

maintain, as a matter of record and fact, that the Wall Street
interventionists and bipartisan warmongers alone are to blame
for the real and growing danger of a new world war.
Desirous of helping to promote a people’s anti-war and anti-
imperialist coalition, under labor leadership, capable of check-
ing and defeating the -fascists and warmakers, we Commu-
nists will support the peace and anti-monopoly program of

_ the Progressive Party and will help build the new party as a

non—Communist, people’s united front mass organization and
movement.

But we Communists have no desire to “take over” the new
party, nor could we if we would. We are also determined to
launch the most extensive Communist election campaign in
our Party’s history. Even though we have no Communist
Presidential ticket and even though we are putting for-
ward only a limited number of Communist Congressional
candidates, we intend to wage our most extensive Communist
political-election campaign. We intend to and will advance
our immediate program which coincides in many respects
with that of the new party and with that of certain C.I.O.
unions and other progressive groups. At the same time, we

will pop-ularize, advance and win support for our socialist ob-C

jectives. We will energetically build our Party and its press,
and everywhere forge united labor-progressive action to defeat
the Candidates and parties of war and fascism.

This determination‘ is not‘ dictated by partisan _considera-
tions. It is based on our political-theoretical understanding
that never does a .working class so need a strong, organized,
Marxist detachment at its head as when it is entering into an
anti-fascist and anti-war people’s coalition and party, into an
alliance with other classes and their political representatives.

is it 3% .

Comrades, a large vote for Wallace, the election of a bloc
of pro-labor and anti-war Congressmen, and the consolidation
and strengthening of the new Progressive "Party under working-
class leadership can change the political -situation in favor of

46

 

 

the labor-progressive camp. It can give a ﬁtting rebuff to the
proponents of war and fascism. .

It can help convertthe new people’s party into a mass anti-
monopoly party and deliver ashattering blow to the Demo-
cratic Party and the two-party system. It can facilitate the
united front from below and a new progressive ‘re-alignment
generally, and within the trade union movement in particular.
It can upset the plans of the Social-Democrats and reformists to
reorganize the Democratic Party under pseudo-liberal inﬂu-
ence_or to create a new mass “liberal” party.

Therefore, everything must be done to rallythe full strength
and resources of the labor, Communist and progressivetmove-
ments to realize these immediate and feasible /objectives. Every-
thing must be done to mobilize this strength and these re-
sources for the people’s anti-war and anti-monopoly camp,
to enable the working class and its allies in these elections
effectively to prepare the way forward and make advances in
the new and stormy political and economic mass struggles
which lie ahead. * '

Chapter IV

FOR THE MASTERY OF MARXISM

FAsc1sM can be defeated, and’World War III is not inevi-
table. Now, and in the coming period, struggle will decide
everything. ' l l
A We have- met here to assure that our Communist" Party will
make its maximum contribution to the momentous struggle
in which the future of our country and the world is at stake.

Can our Party, which is the Marxist vanguard of the
American working class, but which is still numerically small,
measure up to the great responsibilities that history has thrust
upon it?

The answer is and must be, Yes!

It is now three years since our Emergency National Conven-'
tion. As all Communists and workers may now judge, and as
the latest indictments of our National Board by the govern- ‘
ment unwittingly acknowledge, this‘was a historic conven- .
tion. For at our 1945 Convention we broke with and decisively
rejected Browder’s revisionism.

‘ We reconstituted our Party, in the South. and nationally,
on a Marxist-Leninist basis, as the ﬁghting vanguard. Party
of the working class, with a program based on advancing the
immediate and fundamental interests of the American working
class and people. . ‘

Since our last convention we have gone forward in struggle

  ,......,, ,..,,_,....,.... ..,, . ,

 

. and have met a number of big tests, even though we have erred.

and made serious mistakes on a number of questions.

It is true, of course, that we-have not succeeded in developing‘
a sustained and broad enough mass movement against ra-
pacious American imperialism and its bipartisan war policy.
Yet it is a fact that our Party correctly estimated, unmasked
and opposed the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan

from their inception. And we have succeeded in helping or— -

ganize mass opposition to Wall Street’s provocative anti-Soviet
policies and its interventionist program in China, Greece and
Israel. We must now heighten and expand our anti-war and
anti-imperialist activities, develop a mighty crusade for peace
based on the friendly co-operation of the U.S. and U.S.S.R.,
and demonstrate that the struggle for pea-ce, democracy and
economic security are one and indivisible.

Our Party and_ its leadership muffed a number of political
opportunities since 1945, particularly in Party building, and
in the ﬁelds of trade -union, Negro, youth, women’s and vet-

erans’ activity. But it must also be recorded that we did not

miss the most decisive political opportunity of this period-
even though in the ﬁrst phase of the postwar period we made
both Right and “Left” mistakes in carrying out the political
tasks which we set ourselves on the basis of our correct esti-
mate of the postwar situation. A

In the main, our national leadership did not lag behind
or run ahead‘ of the political regroupings of this period. We
helped to forge and shape the new progressive political align-
ment and people’s coalition which is now unfolding.

Now we must help broaden thiscoalition, strengthen at all
costs the political inﬂuence and base of the working class in this
movement and guarantee that our Party displays the greatest
political and organizing initiative and does not submerge it-
self in, or become the tail of, this anti-monopoly people's
coalition and party. It is now‘ a task of major importance to
ﬁght for and ensure the vanguard role and position of our

Party in the labor movement and in the ..people’s coalition.

Our Party has committed many mistakes in its trade union
" 49 ‘

 

work, especially in respect to its slowness in forging the
united front from below. During the period of Left-Center
coalition (1945-1947) which was correct at that time, we often

2 failed to strengthen the independent role and positions of the

Left Wing, including the Communists, especially its working
relations with broader masses of workers in the shops, mills
and factories.

We did not wage a ﬁrm enough struggle in the trade unions
.-as a whole and even in the unions under progressive leader-
ship, against opportunism in practice, especially against the
strong tendencies of economism, reformism andbureaucracy,
as well as against the sectarian concepts of union separatism,
isolationism and adventurism. Nor did we pay sufficient atten-
tion to the problems of reaching, inﬂuencing, and’ winning
the A. F. of L. membership, as well as the new and generally
more backward sections of workers who have entered the
ranks of organizedlabor during and since the war, especially
among the youth (auto, maritime) and the women workers
(textile, garment). We did not ﬁght hard enough for building
the authority of the Party among the masses in the trade unions
and shops. ‘

But’ even these grave errors and weaknesses cannot obscure
the fact that, despite certain desertions and waverings (trans-
port, mine-mill, oﬂice, etc.), the majority of Communist trade
union leaders have adopted and pursued a ‘militant anti-
imperialist and class struggle policy, and are coming forward
as the foremost leaders of the people’s mass movement.

Nor can our shortcomings and deﬁciencies obscure the fact
that we Communists have displayed considerable political
and organizing initiative in some of the most important post-
war ‘economi-c struggles, as in the auto, packing, farm equip-
ment and electrical industries.

What is necessary now is to establish an unbreakable soli-
darity and the closest co-ordination of the Communist and
other Left-wing trade unionists, on all levels. The tactic of
the united front from ‘below must be resolutely pressed in the
shops and plants _and in the union locals. A radical turn must

be made to carry on in our mass work within the A. F. of L.,
noless than within the C.I.O., bearing in mindthat the A. F.
of~L. embraces the largest number of organized workers and
that the winds of progress are blowing in both federations,

_ and that the conditions for working in the A. F. of,L. are not

one whit more diﬂicult than for working within the C.I.O.
Finally, the key link which the progressives in the trade union
movement must now seize upon is the struggle for independent
labor political action, especially for ensuring labor’s full par-
ticipation and leading role in the people’s Progressive Party.
Together with this, full use must be made of labor’s bitter
experience and disillusionment with Taft-Hartleyism and the
Marshall Plan in order to safeguard and strengthen the trade
unions as militant mass ‘organizations, and systematically to
raise labor’s class consciousness.

=)(¢- =ll= =16

In the postwar period our Party has not always and every-
where given adequate leadership to the struggle for Negro
rights. We have been remiss in developing a sustained struggle
against white chauvinism. W

Yet it is‘ a fact that during the past three years our Party
established a clear perspective; advanced the struggle for
national self-determination of the Negro people in the Black
Belt; and initiated a number of effective local and national
mass campaigns, as in defense of the Ingrams and the Colum-
bia, Tennessee, vi-ctims. We have been second to none in
ﬁghting for jobs and equal rights for the Negro people, and in
helping launch such vital nation-wide actions as the struggle
against the Un-American Committee for enforcement of the
14th Amendment and for the June 2 non—parti«san march on
Washington. ‘ L 7

What is required now is that our entire Party give a.bolder
and more determined lead to help end Jim Crow and segre-
gation in the Army and government services, even before N o-
vember 4; that we vigorously aid the Progressive Party to im-
plement its planks for Negro rights, especially to guarantee

51

the rights of the Negro people to vote in 1948 everywhere in
the nation; that we take up the cudgels against every open and
covert expression" of white chauvinism in our Party, in the
trade unions and all other mass organizations; and that we

‘cultivate a new understanding in the labor-progressive camp‘
_of the cardinal importance of Negro-white_unity, of the Negro

question as a national question and the development of the
Negro liberation mass movement as one of the major and
indispensable sectors of the Progressive Party and the new
people’s coalition. ' ‘

=1‘ 3!‘ =X=

Since our emergency convention three years ago, our Party
has not always exercised the necessary vigilance against the
class enemy and its agents within our ranks. At times, certain
Party leaders and committees have adopted a rotten liberal
attitude toward the concealed Browderites and the semi-Trots-
kyite anti-Party grouplets led by Harrison George, Vern Smith,
Sam Darcy, Bill Dunne and Francis Franklin. Not a few Party
leaders and organizations have failed to discern the hand of
the enemy in so-called “honest,” but in reality negative, de-
structive and one-sided criticism.

Nonetheless, it is a fact that our Party and its national
leadership were able ‘to live up to their responsibilities and
emerge stronger as a result of the relentless struggle against
Browderism and Leftist sectarianism and adventurism. We
combated the remnants of revisionism as well as Right oppor-

tunisrn; likewise we cast aside the varieties of Browderism

that assumed a Leftist disguise. _

VVhat is needed today is a merciless struggle- on two fronts,
to eradicate completely the consequences of Browder revision-
ism and to put an end to all irresponsible and semi-Trotskyite
“Left” deviations and practices. What is needed is the sternest
struggle against, Right opportunism, which now prevails in
the labor movement and ﬁnds expression within t-he Party, as
well as against “Left” sectarianism which continually arises
and obstructs the winning of the masses for our main line.

In the past three years, our Party has not been able to use
every event, incident and opportunity to reinforce adequately
the democratic rights of the people and promote fully the
Party’s freedom and legal existence. We have not yet been
able to convince some within our own Party to act upon the
understanding that the “defense of the rights of the Commu-
nists is the, ﬁrst-line defense of all democratic rights” » (Wal-
lace). _ ~

But whatever our shortcomings in mass work or in ‘Party
building, and these are many, our Party has been in the fore-
front of the ﬁght to stop the fascists and warmongers. It has
been among the ﬁrst to safeguard both its democratic rights
and all democratic liberties."

Whether in the mass ﬁght in 1947 to defeat the Schwellen-
bach and Un-American Committee proposals to outlaw our
Party, or in the mass struggle in the last session of Congress to
defeat the iniquitous Mundt-Nixon Bill, our Party has not
been found wanting in ‘foresight, policy and ﬁghting capacity.

Today -our Party spurns all efforts and tendencies to isolate
it and follows a resolute policy of militant‘ united labor and
people’s mass action. We renounce and castigate all legalistic
and constitutional illusions. At the same time we must ensure
that labor and its vanguard ﬁght consistently for every inch of
civil liberties, for the preservation and extension of the demo-
cratic rights of the people, making fullhuse of these rights to
promote the leading role of the American working class and
its vanguard in the nation.

=X¢ =1!‘ =l(=

During the past three years, our Party has weathered a num-

ber of storms. We have begun to meet our heavy -postwar.

responsibilities.
We are well aware that our resourcefulness,. courage and
steadfastness will be more severely tried in the.months and

years ahead. Fortunately, the American working class from

which we -come has endowed us with its ﬁghting spirit. Many
of our brother ‘Communist parties have passed through the

53

ﬁres of fascist trial, and “their. heroism imbues us with deter-
mination to prove equally worthy in the face of whatever trials
may be ahead. 3

But we know from the German experience that more than
heroism is demanded of a working-class vanguard that would
guarantee the defeat of the forces of war and fascism. Only
a Communist Party which fully performs its vanguard tasks
can swing the decisive sections of the working class and its
allies into effective united action. Only a Communist Party
which has mastered the science of Marxism-Leninism can lead
the labor-progressive camp forward in broad, united front
mass struggles to victory over monopoly reaction.

That is why this convention must turn our whole Party
toward the fullest mastery of Marxist theory and practice, as
Comrade Foster so vigorously emphasizes. This is the indis-
pensable condition for the discharge of our obligation to the
American workers and people. '

Nineteen hundred and forty-eight, the year of our most
severe test, coincides with the iooth anniversary of the Com-
munist Manifesto. Happily, the science of Marxism in which
we place our reliance, has itself come through triumphantly
in many tests. The twice-told nursery tales of the specter of
Communism are being told again, with embellishments. But
Communism is no specter. Its solid reality now confronts not
only old Europe, but the whole capitalist world.

History has abundantly conﬁrmed the central theses set
forth in the Communist Manifesto, namely, that the struggle
of classes is the motive force of history and that “. . . the pro-
letariat . . . must rise to be the leading class of the nation,
must constitute itself the nation.” And this Marxist teaching
has been enriched and developed further by Lenin and Stalin
out of a century of working-class experience.

Lenin wrote that “the chief thing in the teaching of Marx
is the explanation of the world-historical role of the proletariat
as the creator of socialist society.”
still remained to be proved in practice that a so-cialist society
could be created. Now the chief thing in the teaching of Marx

54

That was in 1913, when it _

,, .....,..—.- ..:u, c;.

 

. ........—.~ ...n, e;l

 

is no longer only a scientiﬁc theory. A socialist society exists
in the Soviet Union. Its creator was the Russian proletariat,

ledrby the great Bolshevik Party. Now new transitional‘ forms

toward socialism are being created by the working class in the
people’s democracies of Eastern and Central Europe and in the
liberated areas of China.

Conﬁrming’ the validity of Marxism, history has cut the
ground from under its reactionary foes who today pick up

' Hitler’s anti-Communist banner and wave it as they-drive
S toward fascism and war.

The Manifesto declared that “The proletarian movement
is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense.
majority, in the interest of the immense majority.” Stalin:
and the Bolsheviks, wielding the weapon of Leninism in battle:
against‘ capitalist reaction, imperialism and fascism, brought
home this truth to millions and hundreds of millions through.-
out the world: .

Nor was the Soviet Union’s leadership of the national lib-~
eration and anti-Axis war coalition an accidental and ﬂeeting‘
phenomenon, as the American imperialists declare. Defending;
the socialist state in which itthas come to power‘, the Soviet
working class and its Communist vanguard always and in-
evitably defend equally the peace, national independence and
social progress of the immense majority of the world's people.

That is why all who base themselves on enmity to the Soviet A

Union inevitably are hostile to their own people and become
enemies of the immense majority, enemies of peace, national

_ independence and progress.

That is why not only we Communists but millions of other
progressive and patriotic Americans will not have any part-of
Wall Street’s ‘anti-Soviet crusade or war—hot or cold. We
Communists always have served, and we always will serve, the
interests of the immense majority of the American people.
Come what may, we will never betray, in peace or in war, the
interests of America’s working millions to those of the un-
American sixty families. . e

We Communists will oppose any unjust, imperialist war

55

  

against any other nation, as Lincoln, in his time, opposed
the unjust, anexationist war against Mexico. ,

We proudly associate ourselves with the patriotism of Carl
Schurz, who corrected Decatur’s slogan, “My country, right or
wrong,” by adding, “When right, to be kept right. When
wrong, to be put right.”

We call on the ‘American workers and people to consider
that slogan in the light of the German tragedy. If the German
people had put their country right, in time, Hitler would
never have come to power. Nor would the Nazi war criminals
have succeeded in betraying the interests of the immense ma-

~ jority of the German .masses by wreaking their fascist ven-

    

geance on the immense majority of the peoples of the world.

We Communists are not utopians. We do not believe that
it is possible to bring social order out of capitalist chaos. But
we strive by every means in our power to save the American
working class and people from a disastrous war and from
being devoured by monopoly’s greed and crushed by its im-
pending crisis. We keep before the American working class
the perspective of an ordered world, free from crisis, fascism
and war—the perspective of a socialist society. And we carry
on the ﬁght for peace, democracy and international working-
class solidarity in such a way as to help prevent the victory
of fascism and the unleashing of World War III, and to pre-
pare the working class for its historic mission of socialist lib-

eration. .

The concept of international working-class solidarity is im-
plicit in the recognition of the world-historical role of the
working class. In the -capitalist countries today, the working
class leads the people's struggle against fascisml and war, for
peace, national independence, freedom and progress. In this
life-and—death struggle, it inevitably relies on and allies itself
with’ the anti-imperialist masses of all lands, and especially
with the workers of those lands where a socialist society has
been created or is in process of being created. In the eyes of

 

the Wall Street cartelistsand bankers, international workin.g- '

class solidarity is the crime of crimes—-it is “treason”! A

But the spirit of working-class internationalism is bred in
the bones of the American working_ class. One of the earliest
labor papers in the United States in 1834 expressed the hope
that “it will not be long before the working classes of every
part of thetcivilized world will be united by an indissoluble
bond.” «

Today when the imperialist warmongers and fascists are
fanning the ﬂames of chauvinism and bourgeois-nationalism,
when they are inciting worker against worker, white against
Negro, gentile against Jew, native-born against foreign-born,
non-Communist against Communist—we Communists and all
class-conscious workers must instill in the American working
class the principle and practice of proletarian internation-
alism. L '

This Marxist teaching, embodied in the slogan of action
of the Manifesto: “Workers of all countries, Unite!”, embodies
the basic unity of interests of the workers of all lands, as
against the designs and efforts of their exploiters to corral
t-hem for imperialist wars against other nations and peoples.
In ‘this imperishable slogan in the Manifesto there is inherent
the lesson which Marx later enunciated explicitly to the work-
ing class. This lesson is that the labor movement must view
as one of its major tasks active concern with foreign policy,
that it cannot wage an effective struggle against the trusts on
the domestic front without simultaneously uniting with the
workers everywhere and waging a joint struggle against the
predatory policy of the same exploiters on the international
front.

Concretely, today, when U. ‘S. imperialism, seeking to es-
tablish its hegemony over the world, is more and more en-
croaching on theﬁfreedom and national sovereignty of peoples,
we Communists must rouse the working class and all anti-
imperialists to come forward much more resolutely in active
solidarity with the democratic and national-freedom aspira-
tions and struggles of the peoples of China and Greece, of
Israel, of Spain, of Puerto Rico and all of Latin America.

every foul means of defamation and slander to inﬂame the
American people against the Soviet Union, we must resolutely
work to strengthen the bonds o-f friendshipéand co-operation
between the American and Soviet peoples as the key to world
peace. .

Finally, at this time, when the reactionary top leaders,

'Social—Democrats and other bourgeois agents in our labor

movement are seeking to prevent the consolidation of a solid
world labor front, it is the task of us Communists to ‘spur
the strengthening and extension of American labor’s partici-
pation in the V/Vorld Federation of Trade Unions.

We Communists are now falsely accused by monopoly and
its government of “advocating” force and violence, of “con-
spiring” forcibly to overthrow the government.

But we are Marxists, not adventurers, conspirators or putsch-

ists. As Marxists we condemn and reject. the policy and prac-.
' tice of terror, assassination and coup d’e’tat. A

Precisely because we are the vanguard Party of theworking
class we are the party of mass struggle, mass action, which today
seeks to unite American labor and the common people as a
Whole to halt the drive of imperialist reaction toward war and
fascism. Precisely because we are the Party of socialism, we
believe that social change can take pla-ce not alone when the
historical, objective conditions exist for such change, but also
and only when a decisive majority of the most exploited class
in society is convinced that this change is necessary and is pre-
pared to a-ct unitedly to enforce its democratic will and aims
in the interests of the immense majority of the people against
the small minority of exploiters.

In this connection, we proclaim and shall repeat again and

again a cardinal principle of Marxism as. enunciated by Lenin: I

“The rule of capitalism could not be brought to an end if
the-whole economic development of capitalist countries were
not leading to this. . . . No power on» earth could destroy capi-

58 *

 

and rosy cheeks and look like eternal life. . . .

talism if it werenot being washed away and undermined by
history. . . . We do not want to ‘usurp’ power, for the whole
experience of revolution teaches that only a power that is
backed by the majority of the people can be durable. Con-
sequently, ‘usurpation’ of power would be merely an ad-
venture; and our Party would not agree to anything of the
kind.” -

As the vanguard Party of the American working class, we
condemn andloppose the force and violence of capitalism, of
imperialism. We oppose its system, its philosophy and its prac-
tice of political reaction, exploitation and oppression. We
work for the socialist re-organization of society, when the
majority of the American working class and peoplewill be
the ruling class and end forever the exploitation of man by
man, and crises, wars, reaction and fascism;

Today when the advocates and practitioners of forcible
imperialist expansion and atomic war, of lynching and police
violence, maliciously charge us with conspiring to overthrow
the government, we strongly second the observations of Fred-

erick Engels made half a century ago when Bismarck inaugu-_-
rated the infamous “anti-socialist” and “anti-revolt” laws of

that time:

“The irony of world history turns everything upside down.
We, the ‘revolutionaries,’ the ‘rebels’-—we are thriving far bet-
ter on legal methods than on illegal methods and revolt. The
parties of order, as they call themselves, are perishing under
the legal conditions created by themselves. They cry despair-
ingly with Odilon Barrot: la . legalité nous tue—legality is
the death of us; while we, under this legality, get ﬁrm muscles

The Communist Manifesto, in its brilliant reﬂection of all
class struggles prior to 1848, is more than a mirror reﬂect-
ing the image of class struggle in our country. The Manifesto
is itself a weapon of struggle, a mighty weapon, even in this
age of the atom bomb. It does far more than prophesy the role

59

of the working class as the creator of socialist society. It in-

dicates the leading role of labor as the staunchest defender of
the people and all democratic mass movements.’ Its principles
provide a guide. to action for the performance of that role.
Above all, it calls on the working class to forge the special
instrument which alone can enable it to shape its destiny.
Comrades, that instrument is the Communist Party. Any-
one who, in theory or in practice, belittles the role of our
Party in‘ effectnegates the chief thing in the ‘teaching of ‘Marx-
ism, namely, the world-histori-cal role’ of the working class.
And this is the cardinal sin and -crime of Browder_ revisionism.
Only after Lenin had shown the way to“ build this Party
of a new type did the working class develop its capacity to
create a socialist society. In our country there are some
progressives, honest trade unionists and anti-fascists, who
think that the building of the American Communist Party can
wait until some distant time when the American working class
is ready to take the road to socialism. They do not join with
the fascist forces that want to outlaw and destroy our Party;

but they would like us to shrink in size, make ourselves as un-_

obtrusive as possible, and go about our work anonymously.
Some of these people even argue that this is the way best to
promote working-class leadership in the anti-war, anti-mo-
nopoly people’s coalition and the new people’s party.

We must convince them that they are dead wrong. And we

must take sharp issue with and rout out any such ideas that'

may be smuggled into our own ranks. p

The enemy, at least, knows better. It is precisely in order to
keep labor from assuming leadership, and -to weaken and dis-
rupt the anti-fascist, anti-imperialist coalition, that the most
extreme reactionaries seek to isolate, "discredit and destroy
our Party.

No, ‘we do not have to convince the enemy that a ‘strong
Communist Party is a major stumbling block to Wall Street's
fascist and expansionist ambitions. But we still have_to con-
vince many of our friends. V/V‘e must explain to them why,
now more than ever, and above all to assure labor’s leadership

’ 60

 

in the struggle against fascism and war, America needs a mass

Communist Party. We must explain why we Communists strive

, constantly to strengthen our internal discipline, democracy
 and unity, tighten and extend our mass ties, enhance our van-
guard role and deepen our grasp of the science of Marxism-
Leninism.

We must ﬁnd the ways and means to educate ever-wider‘
sections of the American labor-progressive camp in that theo-
retical understanding of the role of our Party which is summed
up by Stalin in Foundations of Leninism.

As for ourselves, comrades, we also have need to refresh and
deepen our theoretical understanding of the role of the Party.
This is but one of the many theoretical tasks we must turn to
with new determination during and following this Conven-
tion. '

Here I have singled out ‘the question of the role of the Party,
not only because developments in our country have placed it
very much on the order of the day, but also because events
in Yugoslavia have elevated it to new importance.

There are many lessons to be learned from the experience
of the Yugoslav Party, whose present leaders deserted the path
and betrayed the principles of Marxism-Leninism and dis-
solved the Communist Party in the Pe’op1e’s Front. As a con-
sequence they betrayed the true interests of the Yugoslav

I workers and people and the cause of peace, socialism and
‘ proletarian internationalism.
I do not propose to spell out those lessons now. I wish
rather to say a few words on the question of why we American
‘Communists, in guarding the organizational and ideological
integrity of our Party, learn not only from our own experi-
ences but also from those of our brother Communist parties.
Also, once again to lay the ghost of that oft-repeated slander
that we .“take orders from Moscow,” I wish particularly to
explain why we study and proﬁt from the experience of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik Party-of
Lenin and Stalin.
Not long ago, the New York Times Sunday Magazine car-'
61

 

ried an" article on "The Infallible Men.” The stale sarcasm of
the title had reference to the Politburo of the C.P.S.U.
Is it‘ because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has

proved itself infallible that we can learn so much from its

experience? No, we leave infallibility to the Roman Catholic
Church; its Popes need the shield of myth. The Communist
Party of the Soviet Union, which has led its working class to
victory and to the position of ruling class, is,not only wise in
the supreme achievements of working-class victories; it is also
a party which has shown how to avoid mistakes, and how to
overcome mistakes and correct them in time.

That is one of the many reasons why we consider its history
so worthy of study. That is why we should ill serve the Ameri-

can working class if we did not learn from the generalized ’
‘experience of the world working class what we would other-

wise have to learn through costly experience. ‘That, too,
is why we must vigilantly and consistently use the Marxist
weapon of criticism and self-criticism so as to enable our Party
and its cadres to adopt and pursue a sound strategy and tactics,
and to prevent or to overcome in timeierrors and mistakes.
=1!‘ =l(‘ . =X=

Without trespassing on Comrade Winston's report, I want
to say a few ﬁnal words on one aspect of the chief thing in the
teaching of Marx, with which Comrade Winston ‘will deal at
length. That is, the burning need vastly to extend and
strengthen our Party’s working-class base, particularly in the
basic industries, and to reinforce our leadership with loyal
andcapable working-class cadres, Negro and white, youth and
women, who ‘have the closest ties with the masses’ and are
tested and skilled in organizing and leading mass struggles.

We have made some small progress in this direction in the
past three years. Browderism negated the chief thing in the
teaching of Marx and assigned to the bourgeoisie the role of

‘creating a world of peace and progress. We have made a clean

break with Browderism. But,‘as a consequence of Browder-

ism, our Party’s industrial growth still lags far behind what ‘

' the times require.

62

 

I cannot believe that the shortcomings in our practicein
this regard are wholly unrelated to a theoretical underesti-
mation of the role of the working class in general, and of its
vanguard Party in particular. We cannot say we have fully
mastered the chief thing in the teaching of Marxism, until
we have found the way to root our Party more deeply in the
working class and extend its inﬂuence, base and ties with the
most militant workers in the basic industries, among the work-
ers in the A. F. of L. and Railway Brotherhoods, as well as
in the C.I.O.

. 3)!‘ =X= =X=

Comrades, we are heading into some big storms. Here in
the citadel of world reaction, the forces of monopoly capital
are ruthless and powerful. The American working class and
its allies are bound to suffer some defeats and setbacks as they

mar-ch forward in struggle. But the presence of a strong and '

inﬂuential Communist Party, grounded in Marxism-Lenin-
ism_ and closely rooted in, tied to and relying upon the
working class, will create the guarantees that setbacks will be
reduced to a minimum and that defeats will be turned into
starting points for new struggles and new advances. We will

A build our Party on this basis regardless of the outcome of the
present ﬁght for our democratic rightsand legal existence.

The American trusts are likethose extinct monsters of the
animal kingdom, whose giant size spelled their doom. The gar-
gantuan American bourgeoisie is producing its own grave-
diggers o.n a mass production scale. It turns towar and fascism
because it is sick and dying. It is not invincible; for only that
is invincible which is new, progressive and developing.

a We do’ not delude ourselves that the old will die peaceably,
or that the new will be born wit-hout great travail. But we are
conﬁdent that the American working class and people will
rise to the responsibilities of this historic battle against the
forces of imperialist reaction, fascism and war. And we are
determined that our Communist Party shall perform with
honor its vanguard role in the ever-sharpening struggles for
democracy, peace and social p6rogress.

Chapter I

THE FASCIST DANGER

COMRADESI I

IN MY REPORT I wish to concentrate on one central question
of the postwar struggle of the people for peace and democracy,
namely, the growing danger of fascism and how to combat it.

Three years have passed since the end of the anti-Axis war
and the military defeat of‘Nazi' Germany, fascist Italy and
militarist Japan. " _

Fascism has been destroyed in the newly established ‘de-
mocracies of Eastern Europe where the foundations are being
laid for the transition to socialism. .

In\Eastern Germany the process of democratization and
demilitarization is well advanced. In great parts of China and
in Northern Korea the victorious liberation movements have
smashed the old feudal—militarist regimes and are bringing new
anti-imperialist peoples’ governments into being.

‘But in Western Germany, Anglo-American imperialism is
building up monopoly capitalism, and the cartelists are again
doing business, under the newmanagement of Wall Street. In

U.S.-occupied Japan, the monarchy, feudalism and the"

trusts remain. The Wall ‘Street cartelists are converting
Western Germany and Japan into spheres “for American
capital investment and control, as well as into spring-
boards for predatory military adventures against the U.S.S.R.

5 .

 

and the anti-imperialist governments of Eastern Europe and\_
Asia. I

In France and Italy, the decisive majority of the working
class and their Communist Parties ﬁght for peace, national in-
dependence, democracy and progress. The United States is try-
ing to enslave these countries. It promotes the rise of clerical
fascism in Italy. It seeks to prepare a fascist coup d’e’tat in
France, making use of the Blum Socialists to pave the way for
the fascist De Gaullists. Similarly, Americanimperialism aids
and tries to bolster the fascists in Greece, Spain and Latin
America. _ '

This sharpening postwar world offensive of American im-
perialism,_ which combines the most reactionary intervention
in the internal affairs of other nations with gigantic and ag-
gressive war preparations, is.accompanied by the growth of
fascism in our country. The development of fascism in the
United States now appears as a serious and threatening men-
ace. The process of fascization, most directly engendered by
monopoly’s war drive, itself in turnserves as a key internal
instrument to facilitate and accelerate Wall Street’s prepara-
tions for World War III. .

The United States is not Spain, nor is it Japan. It is not even
Germany. As «the center of world monopoly capitalism, it has
become in the postwar period the chief center of world reac-
tion. Obviously, therefore, if fascism were victorious in the
U.S., it would subject the American people to_ a savage
regime of unparalleled terror, oppression and exploitation. It
; would plunge the whole world into a new global war of unpre-
cedented violence, horror and death.

=l= =K= =l=

Only those who have eyes but will not see can be blind to *
the increased danger of fascism in America. Yet in some
quarters the danger is denied, while in others it is not under-
stood. V . c ' '

-_ Naturally, the architects and engineers of fascism and war-
the monopolists and their apologists—try to conceal the process
of fascization taking place under their direction.

To obscure their purposes, they try to portray the-~Unitecf
States as the citadel of democracy. They proclaim that.

private enterprise and the two-party system are the hallmarks.
‘ of liberty. They profess that they are championing human

rights—by preserving corporate and states rights. They self-
righteously “justify” every act of aggression abroad and of
repression at home, asserting that they safeguard democracy"
by ‘fcombating Communism.” .

In essence, thereactionary Social-Democrats and the trade
union reformists subscribe to this thesis. They defend Wall.
Street’s reactionary drive toward fascism and war——“because”'
they are “opposed to totalitarianism.” They explain that

the reactionary measures of the bipartisans in both foreign

and domestic affairs are necessary “because” there is no other

= way to prevent the “inﬁltration and spread of Communism"

abroad and within the nation. They extol the virtues. of “the
American way of life,” and consider any form of American

. bourgeois political reaction a “lesser evil” with respect to

socialism.

These Right-wing socialist and reformist labor ﬂunkeys of
the economic royalists serve their masters well by denying the
real source of the fascist danger and minimizing its gravity.
They divert attention from the organizing center of native fas-
cism to its lunatic fringe. They attribute the reactionary and
pro-fascist acts of the government and Congress to “bad in-
dividuals”—and not to the system of monopoly capitalism that
breeds war and fascism.

There isanother school of thought, embracing millions of
honest but confused workers and progressives who can’t see
the ‘woods for the trees. They readily admit that the men
of the American trusts have launched a reactionary post-
war offensive. But they cannot distinguish between the varied
forms through which bourgeois reaction rules and manifests
itself. To them this postwar offensive of monopoly appears
identical wi.th that whi-ch followed World War I.

‘ They point to the Palmer raids, in-junctions and “racelriots"
of 1919-1923, as well as to the Dawes Plan, and think
