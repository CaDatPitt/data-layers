ontract Demands.

DENVER——Over-all ‘bargaining perspectives for 1962  T
held top priority in deliberations -of the International =

  

Executive Boardlast month at itsfinal meeting of the

outgoing year. .

After devoting much of their session to thorough
review and discussion of conditions in the non-ferrous
metals industry and the national economy generally, the
Mine-Mill leaders adopted a statement projecting a com--
prehensive program-outline of contract proposals in four

major bargaining areas.

Formulated primarily as a springboard for local dis-
cussion prior to finalization at the next annual convention
in March, these objectives emphasize the issues of wages,
job and income security, health and welfare, and fringe
benefits dealing with premium pay. .

As an important part of the proposed bargaining
program, the Board issued a .call for all unions in the

industry tounite‘ in a common approach to ‘this year’s‘

negotiations with the major company chains. (See sep-

arate story this page.)

The research department
was directed to prepare a
complete study of changes
proposed by the Kennedy Ad-
ministration in U‘.S. foreign
"trade as they might affect do-
m e s t i c industry production
and employment.

=l< * >34
AMONG other matters given
close attention by the officers
and b_oard_ members were:

' preparations for legislative ac-

tion during the coming ses-
sion of Congress, progress in
the union’s wage equalization
program, expansion of civil
rights activities among the lo-
cals, union defense develop-
ments, reorganization and con-
solidation of forces, adminis-
tration and finances.

Taking a hard, realistic look
at the union’s financial situa-
tion, the Board acted to insti-
tute sharp economies both in
the International‘ office and
the districts with a A view V of

Min-MiIlUrges United

Approachon Bargaining

_ DENVER—A call for _unity of allnon-ferrous metals industry unions in a common
approach to 1962 bargaining was adopted -by the Mine-Mill Executive Board at its

meeting last month.

_ The statement was an important adjunct of a comprehensive program of bar-
gaining perspectives which the Board projected in preparation for this year’s negoti-

ations in all major company
chains.

Present methods of bargain-
ing “where every craft and in-
dustrial group takes the com-
panies on alone makes no
trade union sense,” the Mine-
Mill leaders declared.

The statement particularly
called attention to “fruitless”
strikes by unions representing

small groups in the industry
which have proved costly not
only to their own members but
have hurt the big majority of
workers not involved in those
disputes.

“Only a united bargaining
approach can avoid such waste-
ful battles,"_ the statement
pointed out.

FOLLOWING is the full text
of the Board’s statement:

“The most important job be-
fore the non-ferrous metal
workers in 1962 is negotiating
an agreement to improve their
wages and working conditions
and safeguard their jobs.

“All workers in the industry
are invneed of a wage increase.
Severance pay, supplementary
unemployment benefits, fully
paid health and welfare pro-
grams, are long overdue in"

. theindustry. 1962 should mark

(Continued on Page 8)

streamlining operations and
balancing the budget.
Additionally it was agreed
that a study be made of the or--
ganizational set-up of the un-
ion and that a reorganization
plan be prepared for recom-
mendation by the Board to the
1962 convention. The Board
also voted to recommend con-
vention approval for a 75-cent

V per capita increase of which

25 cents would be set aside in
the Strike Fund. Both actions

are designed to consolidate,-

tighten and strengthen the un-
ion’s entire functioning ap-
paratus.

0 O
Bargaining
In its designation of four
major economic areas as con-
centration issues for 1962 bar-
gaining, the Board’s statement
pointed to new high levels of
p r o d u c t i o n, particularly in
copper, accompanied by in-

creasing profits, which have-

resulted from the rapid rise
in productivity or output per
man hour.

’ Emphasis, was placed on
the fact ‘that “increased pro-
ductivity in non-ferrous met-
als has been in excess of the
increase in average produc-
tivity for the U. S. as a whole."
‘ “Wages under our contracts
have been rising at one-third
or less of this rate,” the
Board said. “Rising productiv-
ity, which has brought higher
profits to the companies, has
meant increasing job insecur-
ity, and static or shrinking
work opportunities for our
members in the face of rising
output.”

Following are the main is-
sues projected by the Board
for local union consideration
prior to convention action on
1962 bargaining demands:

Wages
Two aspects of the wage
problem were underscored for
Mine-Mill .members:
FIRST,.the need of a gener-
al wage increase to provide a

planned a Christmas party
and exchange of gifts as well
as arrangements for making
up Yule baskets for delivery
to the needy on Christmas
Eve.

A tamale sale held by the

' Auxiliary’ in San Manuel and

Mammoth on Dec. 8 was a
huge success. Publicity chair-
man Mrs. Ben Horner reports
that 60 dozen tamales were
sold “and we could have sold
that many more if we had
them.”

An earlier meeting of the

was attended by some 300 pen-
sioners and their wives, plus
an additional 600 local mem-
bers and their wives.

ers will also receive an aver-
age of bonus earned in event
of mechanical breakdown-

"A committee will be set_,_,u.p‘

CTM Guests at
Mine-Mill Dance

AS&R El Paso Local 509

‘held a very successful dance

for its membership Nov. 23 at
the Cruz Blanca Club across

Invited guests attending in-
cluded the executive board of
the Confederation of Mexican

- Workers (CTM) in Juarez, of-

ficers of ‘the Juarez Nurses"
union as well as a representa-
tive of the Mayor of Juarez.

portunity for the U. S. union-
ists to renew relations with
the CTM whose officers were
very cordial and expressed
their intention of inviting
Mine-Mill local union officers
to the CTM banquet in Febru-
ary being planned in honor of

.a forthcoming visit of CTM

Baltimore -Wins
Upgrading Case

An i m p o r t a nt seniority
grievance involving the
upgrading of a Negro worker
to the job of Sample Man was
won recently by Local 625 at
the Baltimore, Md., AS&R re-
finery.

Mine-Mill member Gerald
Williams applied for the high-
er paying job which had pre-
viously been run by a white
man. The department foreman
called in shop steward Ted
Hopkins and advised him that
none of the men in the depart-
ment were qualified to run the
job. The foreman said a work-
er from another department
was being brought in to train
for the Sample Man’s job.

When Hopkins told the fore-
man there were men Within
the department who could
qualify and insisted that the
men be permitted to exercise
their seniority for the promo-
tion, the foreman still refused.

The union filed a grievance
and vigorously processed it
through the first three steps.
At the top level, when manage-
ment was advised that the un-
ion was prepared to take the
case to arbitration, agreement
was finally reached that sen-
iority would be applied, and
Williams was assigned to the
job of Sample Man.

State Court Backs
Superior UC Case

The Arizona Supreme Court
has ruled that three elderly
workers retired against their
will by Magma Copper were
entitled to unemployment com-
pensation in addition to pen-
sions under their Mine-Mill Su-
perior Local 938 contract. The
state top court's unanimous de-
cision reversed a ruling by
Pima County Superior Court

 

SAN MANUEL LOCAL. 937 officers and stewards participate in blackboard discussion led by, Financicil
‘terry C. G. Provencio on iob description phase of Superior-San Manuel Council's wage‘ equalizatio

 
  

gram. Locals 937 and 938 were nearing completion of this phase of the program at the Magma‘-_Co‘ 00'

Company properties in -Arizona.

Judge Herbert Krucker.
The company contended that
the workers 2 had agreed to re-

tire at age 68 in return for -a
pension under the union agree-—
ment. The high court, how-,

ever, held that the state UC
law does not disqualify invol-
untary claimants because they

happen to be receiving em-

ployment or pensions.

This was the -case handled-

by ‘Local 938 Business Agent
Rodolfo P. Garcia, which the
union won some time ago, but
which Magma Copper ap-
pealed to the courts after the
Mine-Mill members, aged 69 to
72, collected $910. It was the

1 first time that Magma work-

ers won such.an extra amount
of money after being retired.

Council Acts on
Magma Job Plan

Arizona Locals 937 and 938,
which make up the Superior-
San Manuel Council, report
progress on the job descrip-
tion phase of their wage equal-
ization program expected to
be finalized into-specific «bar-
gaining proposals covering the
two Magma Copper proper-
ties at the March convention.

A November session of the
Council urged that the local
committees complete the job
description portion of the pro-
gram by Dec. 15 for the mill,
s m elt e r and surface depart-
ments. Target date for the
mine departments is Feb. 18,
when the Council meets again.

Leaders of both locals have
been visiting each other’s offi-
cers and stewards and mem-
bership meetings for exchange
of views and close coordina-
tion of their activity on the
program. They are being as-
sisted by Council Coordinator
Charles H. Wilson.

tions connected with the min-
ing industry.

IN THEIR testimony, the
Council delegates blasted the
inadequacy of State safety and
health controls while at the
same time recommending cer-
tain remedial measures.

On the Occupational Disease
and Disability law, the union
urged that the House commit-
tee= .

0 Look into files of the In-
dustrial Commission on all
matters affecting claims, spe-

cifically relating to lung dis-

eases ;

o Obtain from employer rec-
ords all employes’ lung com-
plaints and the number given
new jobs removing them from

“exposed areas” and the type
of work they were assigned
to; .

0 Investigate and request
from TB sanitoriums informa-
tion on the number of sili-
cotic cases admitted to such
institutions; ,

0 Introduce legislation to ex-
pand benefits and minimize
qualifications, and to extend
benefits over the ‘entire period
of disability;

0 Go into mining camps and
enter mines to investigate
dust, gas and other hazardous
conditions. V

=l< * *

THE COUNCIL f u r t h e r

urged revision of the State
Mining Codes and_extension of

-the Codes jurisdiction to mills,

smelters, leaching plants, acid
plants and other operations
connecting with mining.

To accomplish this, the un-
ion urged that the Legislature
set up a five man committee,
in cl u d i n g a representative
from Mine-Mill, to draft a new
and more adequate Code.

Expressing the sentiments
of residents of their communi-
ties, the Council delegates also
reported on air pollution in
mining, milling and smelting
areas where tailings, dusts,
smoke, acid fumes and other
contaminations constitute a
nuisance and danger to public
health, impairs public comfort
and convenience, and endan-
gers property and livestock.

* * *

MEANWHILE, the Council
has issued a message to its 10-
cals urging immediate con-
tacts and meetings with their
state senators and represen-
tatives to discuss the union’s
safety and health program.

Additional proposals in its
state legislative program were
scheduled to be considered by
the Arizona Council at its next
meeting during January.

Talk Safety 

In Olympia

OLYMPIA, Wash. —— Mine-
Mill locals in Tacoma and
Metaline Falls were represent-
ed at the Governor's 12th An-
nual Conference on Industrial
Safety heldat the state capitol
here recently.

Attending from Tacoma Lo-
cal’ 25 were Chairman Alvin
Kuehl and Charles Meyers of
the .union’s safety committee,
and Business Agent William
Lee. President Bert Irwin
headed thegroup present from
Metaline Falls Local 515.

Altogether more than 1,200
registered, the largest num-
ber ever to attend the Gover-
nor’s safety conference.- The
occasion this year marked the
50th anniversary for industrial
insurance in the state of
Washington, one of the first
states to establish such ben-
efits.

Chief labor - speaker was
President E. N. Altman of the
AFL-CIO Marine Engineers’
Beneficial Association who
stressed the need to eliminate
safety hazards before they re-
sult in the disabling or death
of workers.

Other speakers inclu d'e d
Stephen H. Shulman, execu-
tive assistant to the U. S. Sec-
retary of Labor, and Dr. Wil-
liam Edmark of Seattle.

Tough Greenfield Strike Ends

BUFFALO,yN. Y.—Members
of Mine-Mill Queen City Smel-
ter Local’ 537 end-ed their four
months rough-tough strike at
the Greenfield plant here No-
vember 29-with a victory over
the company’s calculated drive
to smash the union and wreck
the contract.

Not only did the workers
maintain their union against
the company’s all-out attack,
but they went back on the job
protected by a better and
stronger contract. Their well-
conducted strike was one of
the longest on the Niagara
Frontier during 1961.

Around-the-clock picket
lines were set up at contract
termination time on July 31.
The strike was forced by com-
pany demands for 10 per cent
wage cuts, removal of union
standards and job classifica-
tions which would have rolled
back conditions 20 years to
open shop slave labor days,
slashing of health insurance
and holiday benefits, and other
mutilations of the old agree-
ment.

SETTLEMENT of the strike

came with unanimous mem-
bership ratification on Nov. 27
and signing of a new and bet-
ter contract on ‘Nov. 29. Terms
of the one-year agreement,
running till July 31, 1962, in-
clude:
, All union standards, jobs,
Wages; fringes, hours and

Labor’s Fight Must
Be Made-Together

ITH the opening of the New Year, I wish at this time

to extend the season’s greetings to the membership
of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers and their families.

Taking a close look at happenings during the past
year, labo-r as a whole cannot have a ‘great
deal of confidence in facing the-problem
of the year ahead. -
The instability of the top leadership in
the presumed. joint House of Labor, ‘ and
their proposed programmatic activities dur-
ing their convention in the sunny climes of

fidence among the rank and file that a joint
supreme effort is to be made to help solve
some of the vital problems confronting the
worker today and in the days to come.

 

CLARK

unemployment and ‘ways to conquer the
ever-growing automation and its killing impact. No real under-
standable discussion took place on the economic situation with
its serious implications for labor—cheap competitive imports and
loss of world markets—acceptance of tariff cuts with the
European Common Market without assurance of alternative job
openings for displaced workers. All this gives yQu_a feeling
that straws are being grasped without real advantage to the
millions of workers in our country. i / " “

**‘*

FLAG of truce presumably washoisted over the juri-sdic-0

tional fig-hts-and raids which have been rampant "s’in"cei the

merger of the twofederations; with -a pro'po'se'd“arbitratidniorce '

given power to settle these disputes. ‘ -

We who have seenand felt the effects of this disease of raid-
ing, and its cost to the worker financially and morally, can only

believe the proposed "arbitration set-up is little more than a face- '

savingmotion. Some of the leadership and their henchmenhave
become so steeped in -this cancer-- in the labor, movement that
we doubt any sincerity of any agreement to end it, , When you
divide a union membership by these tactics you lose labor unity
and create doubt among the unorganized workers, thus stifling.

the program we all should be carrying out——organizing the un-G

organized.

There is some excuse"-in losing membership" because of
economic reasons like shrinking work forces, etc., but to lose or"
gain by raiding and breaking up functioning trade unions is

slowly but surely bringing on the decline of the trade union_ G

movement, physically" and morally. _ -.

***

ABOR in general hassuffered enough membership losses

already. ,At the time of the AFL-CIO merger in 1955, be-

fore the Teamsters and other unions were expelled, it showed a

membership of around 15 million. Today the merged federation

shows an estimated 12% million members.

Francisco convention two years ago, the AFL-CIO shows aloss
of nearly 200,000 members.

' According to reports, the Auto Workers lost some 37,000
members since 1959; Machinists dropped almost 50,000 in two
years; the Steelworkers, worst violator in the union-breaking
raiding campaign, claimed a membership of over" a million in
1957——it’s now down to around 840,000. Other big losers‘. were

the Woodworkers, Textile Workers and Packinghouse Workers,_

losing anywhere from thirty to fifty thousand members each.

A few federation affiliates show some increases in member-
ship—the Municipal Workers, the Government Employees, the
Retail Clerks, the Federation of Teachers——but those can hardly
be called basic industries. ’

On the other hand, the Teamsters Union shows a gain of
some 300,000 members since its expulsion from the merged
federation. ‘ The field for organizing and the cry for organizing
is there, not only in the South but all over this country of ours.

How long will it be before these top ﬂight labor leaders
become convinced that their inter-jurisdictional hassles, their
raiding programs, their villification of other unions’ policies and
their lack of any real fight against legislative and other controls
over free labor are splitting unions apart, giving workers the
feeling of “a plague upon both your houses,” and making it
doubly hard to organize the unorganized?

***

HE program of Mine-Mill this year, as of other years, is for

unity and joint action with all unions on the bargaining
front as well as in the political and legislative field. We have
sent out a call to the craft unions in our industry who face the
same companies as we do for cooperation this year to achieve
the maximum benefits possible for all our members.

The companies with which we deal are able to grant conces-
sions both on the wage level and welfare benefits, as well as

. other important issues set forth in our bargaining perspectives

for 1962. We have seen the results of divided action in such
places as Bingham and Miami, to the disadvantage of the
workers involved. It is up to the leaders to ‘see that the fight
is made together. V

The same applies in the political and legislative field. A
strong, unified labor movement can and must offset the trend
of further legislative shackles. This is what's needed to heat off
the “right-to-work” and other ultra‘-right maneuvers against
labor. It can work in overcoming unemployment.

Such unity can advance civil rights, and can -make itself.

Termed ‘Collective Insanity’
_ NEW YORK—The individuals who are paving the
way to‘ World War III‘ are individually sane, but in com-
bination they are insane. ‘That was the reasoned opinion‘
of “speakers ‘ at a ‘symposium here of the American
Psychological Association on the psychopathology ‘of
thermonuclear war. ‘ ’

Terms such as “the col-
lectivity of death” and “col1ec-
tive insanity” were used fre-
quently by the psychologists.

Dr. Howard E. Gruber of the
University of Colorado said:

“The threat of thermonu-

it are, for the most part, indi-
vidually sane and intelligent.
The scientists on both sides
are sound, the military men
are sound, the statesmen like-
wise. The individuals" are
sound but the combination"“is
sick. _

“We have been playing an
international game of blind
man’s bluff,’ with two blind
men. If the game continues,
they will eventually collide
and the game will be over.
We need to dismantle the
thermonuclear military estab-
lishment, and if that means to-
tal disarmament, so be it.” . .

NEW YORK, N. Y.—“Phony Charges Got Page One _Coverage_,-Truth. Got. Pag

of the National Maritime Union. The story reported on press treatment of a . Just‘ e‘

validate the NMU’s 1960 international officers election.

    
 
   

The suit was filed in
October, 1960, by former
President Eisenhower’s Labor
Secretary James P. Mitchell.
Charging fraud in the conduct
of the election, it was the first
such government case initiated
under the Landrum-Griffin act
against a national union.

New Subversive
Paper Exposed

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The

Congressional Record has, been
added to the list of subversive
publications ripe for investi-
gation, Cong. James Roosevelt
(D., Calif) reports. Roosevelt
cited this gem in the letters-to-
the—editor section‘ of the Sacra-
mento Bee: _ .

“Sir: I recently came upon
the Congressional R e c 0 r d,

which I understandis an offi- -

cial government publication.
In that publication was a vi-
cious article attacking the
John Birch Society. ' I .

“When a magazine can at-

tack a patriotic organization
like the ‘John Birch Society,
that is carrying freedom of the
press too far. I think the Con-
gressional Record should be
investigated and if it is found
to be un-American it should be
suppress-ed.”

SUPERIOR, ‘Ariz. —— Times

sure have changed at Magma
Copper since Mine—Mill or-

ganized its mining and smelt-'

ing operationshere four years
ago. -

For nearly 50 years thc
company had discharged work-
ers at will, with the policy
that, if a man was rehired and
no matter how much service
he had, he came back on the
payroll as a new employee.
Not so now, as recent cases
show.

Local 938 member Daniel
Espino, a Magma miner with
21 years service, -was fired for
alleged violation of a com-
pany rule. In answer to the
union’s grievance, the com-
pany said the discharge would
stand.

THE grievance was then
processed up to the General
Manager, who agreed to re-
hire Espino, but only as a

new employee, arguing that -

it was against company policy
to reinstate discharged work-
ers with seniority. ,
Not satisfied with this an-
swer, the union continued to
press the grievance until‘
finally the  General; Manager

agreed to reinstate Espino -on‘
his regular job‘ with full

seniority -rights for 21 years!

Magma Mine ldled by Fire

SUPERIOR, Ariz.—Members of Mine—Mill Local 938 were involved last month in

helping to contain a
portion of the Magma

cooperating with managemen
mine safe enough for resumption of full op

smelter.

Some, 700 miners were
ldled by the underground fire
which has been accompanied
by numerous small cave-ins

~and sloughing in ground. The

conflagration was in a heavily
timbered area which has been
mined out for about four
years, but is close to work-
ing areas.
=I¢ ii! iii

THE union has been instru-
mental in getting the Arizona
Employment Security Com-
mission to establish a tempo-
rary office in Superior for the
Magma workers filing for un-
employment compensation due
to the operation shutdown
caused by. the blaze. Claims
have been filed since the fire
started.

Because of the. slow process
of sealing ’off'the fire area,
full work was not expected
to be resumed until after the
new year.

Fire crews have succeeded
in containing the fire, and
work» was progressing on the
pouring of. permanent con-
crete bulkheads at the various
openings leading to the area

Kennecott Council 1
Issues H G W Tips

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—Steps to combat doctors’
overcharges under the union’s Health and Welfare plan
at Kennecott have been outlined by Mine-Mill Kennecott
Council Coordinator Verne Curtis in a Council informa-
tion bulletin issued to all members.

The bulletin called atten-
tion to the new paragraph
relating to surgeons’ fees
which was added to the gen-
eral terms of the H&W plan
as a result of Mine-Mill's 1961
negotiations with Kennecott
Copper.

Il¢ 3!‘

THE paragraph says:

“At regular intervals, as de-
cided by the Company and the
Union, the Insurance Com-
pany shall provide the Com-
pany and the Union with in-
formation on the charges of
surgeons’ fees which are in
exce s s of the stipulated
amount pursuant to the com-
prehensive schedule used in
administering this plan. The
Company a nd the Union,
either separately or jointly,
may refer to the respective
State Medical Societies, for re-
view, any of these surgeons’
fees which apply to employees
(or their dependents) repre-
sented by the Union."

Curtis pointed out "that a
joint committee of the com-
pany and union has now met
with the respective medical
societies in Nevada, Utah, Ari-
zona and New Mexico for the
purposes described inthe
above paragraph, with the re-
sulting agreement between the
joint committee and medical
societies in each of these
states that meetings will be
held to discuss surgeons’ fees
which are in excess of the
schedule of benefits.

* =3 '8

MEMBERS were reminded
that a H&W Sick Committee
has been set up in each local
union to meet with company
representatives and doctors ' to
discuss possibilities of revis-
ing overcharges downward. In
addition, the committees are
also supposed to handle any
weekly sickness and accident
grievances such as payment
delays, etc. Management per-
sonnel handling. these pay-
ments have been instructed
by the company to act with

dispatch on all claims to avoid
hitches or unnecessary delays.

Any members having prob-
lems either on excess doctors’
fees or weekly benefits were
advised to contact their local
H&W committeeman imme -
diately.

Curtis also urged all mem-
bers who anticipated hospital-
ization or doctors’ services of
any nature either for them-
selves or their dependents, to
do the following:

0 Talk to the doctor and ask
him to adhere to the H&W
plan’s schedule of benefits;

0 If the doctor overcharges,
check it out with the local un-
ion committeeman before pay-
ing the doctor on the over-
charge. .

The Council bulletin empha-
sized that all members should
attend their local union meet-
ings to get the facts regard-
ing any type of Health and
Welfare problems.

Local 937 Votes

Fund ‘Contribution

SAN MANUEL, Ariz. — A
recent membership meeting of
San Manuel Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers Union Local
937 voted to make a regular
contribution of $20 per month
to the Mine-Mill Defense Fund,
starting in December.

It was the second Arizona
local to take such action since
the District 2 leadership con-
ference in October recom-
mended regular voluntary do-
nations by locals to the Fund.
Copper Queen Miners Union
Local 551 in Bisbee approved
a $40 per month contribution
beginning in October. —

Other District 2 locals al-
ready making the regular do-
nations are Arthur-Magna
(Utah) Millmen’s Union Local

Special Sudbury Meeting Calls V
For Mobilization to Defeat  

SUDBURY, Ont.—A special mass meeting of INCO‘ Local 598 at the lsu’d 
Arena here Dec. 3 unanimously called for “full mobilization of all resources"?-of ”
national union and the local union against the Steel raiders.” Nearly 4,000 ‘rfn_efm'b

of the local packed the ice hockey arena for the meeting called by Mine-Mill Can
National President Ken Smith under the union’s constitution to. protect the. inte es

of the rank and file.

Smith acted to call the
special meeting after Don
Gillis, president and leader of
the Steel clique in the local,
refused to heed a‘ petition
signed by some 2,300 local
members demanding that Gil-
lis himself call an official
meeting to take up the ques-
tion of fighting’ the Steel raid
and to follow a program of
membership unity in bargain-
ing with INCO.

Twice during the month of
November Gillis arbitrarily
adjourned Local 598 member-
ship meetings when members
took the floor to press. for ac-
tion against the raid and for
defense of the local union.

Since then Gillis and his
board ' have announced cancel-
lation of all Local 598 meet-
ings.

Magnus Metals
. Some four months of hard
negotiations, the last two ses-
Sl0nS with the assistance of
Federal Mediation, fin ally
brought agreement on a new
20-month contract with the

Magnus Metals division "of Na-’

tional ‘Lead.

This is a shop which was
successfully raided by the
AFL-CIO Molders, Union six
years ago and only last June
voted in an NLRB election to
return to, Mine-Mill. Negotia-
tions on the new contract were
hampered by the old AFL die-
hards in the plant who aided
the company to resist every
union demand and attempted
to coerce the workers into. re-
taining the old  contract
unchanged ‘except. for. a wage

.  The company. ‘at-the
  time, notivonly resorted

,..

to the pressure of heavy lay-
offs, but also implied a com-
plete shutdown of the plant.

Despite this line-up, the un-
ion won a new contract pro-
viding for vastly improved
grievance procedure and sen-
iority rights protection, both
of which were woefully inade-
quate in the old Molders con-
tract.

Other terms include: a un-
ion shop; improved vacation
and holiday provisions; Blue
Cross and Blue Shield hospital.
and medical plan; increased
sick and accident insurance
benefits worth more than
eight cents ‘per hour. '

And, a contributory retire-
ment annuity and life insur-
ance plan which, in addition
to retirement benefits -based
on earnings, provides life in-
surance in the amount of dou-
ble the employee's annual
yearly earnings. The com-
pany contends the plan will
cost management 17 cents per
hour, based. on $2.51 plant
hourly average ‘earnings. —

- The new contract, rtmning

till June 30, 1963, also provides ,

for improved severance pay

and a general wage increase ,
of 10 cents per hour, effective.
— July 1, 1962. ‘

A new two-year agreement
with Paragon Die Casting is
retroactive to Oct. 17, expira-

moves up 17 cents the first
year and 19 cents the second.
For other categories in the

SILVER producers are ex-
pected to oppose the proposal,

because‘ they would prefer to
‘have the -’Treasury purchase '

its coinage requirements on
the open market. This would
tend to increase the price of
silver still further. Commer-

cial users of silver — mainly

the photographic film, silver-
ware, and "electronics indus-
tries——can be expectedto sup-
port the Administration pro-
posal.

The rise in silver’s price
that has taken place thus far
means extra profits for prac-
tically every mining company
under contract with Mine-Mill.
About three-fourths of U.S.
mine production of silver is a
by-priduct of copper, leadzand
zinc mining. The rest is re-
covered mainly from predomi-
nantly silver ores.

For the big copper produ-
cers, the extra profit will not
mean as much as an extra
fraction of a cent on the price
of copper. But for some lead-
zinc mines rich in silver, and
for the silver mines, particu-
larlyvin Idaho, better times are
in prospect.

MAGMA COPPER COMPANY and its subsidiary, San
Manual Copper Company, are scheduled to come under control
of Newmont Mining Corporation, $200 million, New York based
investment trust with world-wide minerals holdings.

Newmont now owns 211/; percent of Magma Copper, val-
ued at the end of 1960 at $10,417,120, and plans to enlarge its
control to 80 percent, by an exchange of stock. The exchange
would first require approval by Newmont and Magma stock-
holders. The proposed move would increase Newmont’s staturi
in world copper production.

Other Newmont copper holdings include Tsumeb Corp.
(S.W. Africa), 29.1% owned; Southern Peru Copper Corp.,
10.25%; Cyprus Mines (with mines in Cyprus and Arizona),
12.2%; O’Okiep Copper (So. Africa), 57.5%; Granduc Mines
(Canada), 37.6%; Sherritt Gordon (Canada), 37.4%; Idorado

Additional Newmont holdings are in such companies as
Continental Oil, El Paso Natural’ Gas, Lucky Friday (silver),
St. Joseph Lead, Dawn Mining Co. (uranium), and in lead and
zinc mines in Morocco and_Algeria. ‘

RESEARCH has been given new emphasis by the copper
industry in the closing months of 1961. ‘The following recent
developments highlighted this trend;

1. Opening of a Detroit -branch. office by Copper and
Brass Research Association, an organization supported by

u U. S. copper fabricators. The new office will emphasize prac- .

tical use of copper. research developments by auto manu-
facturers, who last year used 200,000,000 pounds of wrought
copper, and copper and brass sheet, strip, tube, rod and
wire.

2. Announcement by Copper Products Development As-
sociation that it now has 23 research studies in progress
with various research laboratories and universities, includ-
ing. the University of Arizona, the University of Ghent in
Belgium, and laboratories in England, Sweden and the
United, States.

This association was formed less than two years ago by
34 copper producing companies in the United States, Canada,
Europe, Africa and Australia. Its 1960 budget was $750,000,
-andit -is expected to spend $1,000,000 in 1961 and about one-
third more in 1962. 7 5

Dr. Charles H. Moore, the association's technical direc-
tor told reporters the object of the research program was
to find new uses for copper, and that he expected the copper
industry research program to become greater than research
activities of the steel and aluminum-industries.

Among possibilities under investigation are a stainless
or non-tarnishing copper, a copper-iron alloy for -engine
castings, a speeded up oxidation of copper so mills could

3. Opening of Anaconda American Brass Co.’s multi-
million dollar research center at Waterbury, Connecticut. 130
technicians are to be employed at the new facility. Tentative
budget plans are to spend about 1' percent of sales receipts
on research. ‘

4. Announcement by Kennecott Copper Corp. of purchase
of a site at Lexington,’ Mass. for a basic research center in
copper and other metals.

Robert G. Page, President of Phelps Dodge Corporation,
which supports both the Copper and Brass Research Association
and the Copper Products Development Association, was quoted
recently as saying the 1940s and 1950s were a period “mainly
of copper shortages——there was very little incentive to find new
uses and customers, since the problem was to supply the ones
we had.” 0

But Dr. Moore of the Copper Products Development As-
sociation says research is needed now because “the days of
copper shortages are past. The industry has to protect existing
markets and put new tonnages to work.”

The New York Times in a recent roundup estimated $10
million or so being spent by various companies and associations
this year for copper research. It compares this with $68 million
spent on research in 1960 by Standard Oil of New Jersey, and
$15 million to $18 million per year in recent years by Aluminum
Company of America.

LEAD AND ZINC prices advanced a month ago. The slight
111. cent increase in lead signified no basic improvement in the
lead market, which continues to be plagued with heavy stocks
in the hands of producers and continued. shrinkage in the use
of lead.

The 1/2 cent rise in the price of zinc, on the other hand,
reflects continued shrinkage in U. S. producers’ stocks of zinc
and the highest shipments of zinc to such users as diecasters,
brass mills and galvanizers in October and November since
June 1959. U. .. S. zinc, now at 12 cents per pound, could imove
higher with continuation of these trends.

Zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange, however, re-
main depressed at less than 9 cents per pound because of world
oversupplies of zinc. The U. S. price of zinc is protected to
some extent by the import quotas which limit the amount of
foreign zinc that can be imported. -

equalizing wage rates through-
out the industry, in line with

the union’s ‘program already ‘

implemented in certain basic
sections and being prepared in
others.

Regarding the latter point,
the Board said: “The intensive
and detailed work that has al-

this industry must be made

table". . . This is the year in
which long strides can and

nation of existing wage differ-
entials.”

Job Security

A major effort to provide
both greater employment op-
portunities and steadier in-
comes was called for. Without
committing the union to any
particular formula in the
many approaches toward job

and income security, the Board’

statement proposed considera-
tion of:

0 A shorter workweek, work-
day or workyear without loss
in take-home pay;

0 More paid holidays in line
with the growing tre nd in
many basic industries;

yo Longer paid vacations, in-
cluding a four-week vacation
for older workers;

0 Earlier optional retirement
with adequate benefits;

0 Restrictions on contracting-
out of work done by Mine-Mill
members; ‘

0 Job transfer rights and
moving allowances for dis-
placed workers.

_ Supplemental unemployment 

benefits, severance pay and
minimum weekly wage guar-
antees were also proposed as

necessary measures to attain»

greater protection against loss
of A income through layoffs,
permanent displacement and
short workweeks.

While specific demands in

each company chain are ex‘-
pected to differ with the wide-
ly varying conditions and cir-
cumstances "that now exist,
the statement set forth several
general principles for applica-
tion in all chains:

1. Employers sh ould bear
the full. cost of a minimum
adequate program of compre-

hensive care for workers and
their families; a '

2. Where the union has sub-
s tantial concentrations of
members, benefits should be
provided on a direct service
basis through agreements with
groups of doctors and hospi-
tals;

3. Plans should be jointly
administered;

Fringe Benefits 7’ '

Without attempting to blue»

print the number and kind of
fringe benefits to be included

in the union’s final bargain-1

ing program at the March

convention, the Mine-Mill lead-A

ers nevertheless suggested at_
' least two s u ch benefits re- '

quiring serious attention in lo-
cal discussions.

The first of these is shift
differentials which, the Board

declared, “no longer, have prac- - -:

tical meaning in ‘this industry.”
The statement pointed out that
in the nearly 20 years that
such differentials have existed,
wages have increased by from

$1.50 to $1.60 an hour while‘

the raise in shift premiums

have been negligible and com-

pletely out of proportion. L
The second is premium pay

for weekend work. This pay,

once considered unduly expen-
sive and impractical in con-.
tinuous o p e r a t i o n indus-

«tries, has been extended into,

‘several such industries, the
Board said, adding: ‘ s
“The companies themselves,
in the past two recessions,
have demonstrated that mills,
smelters and refineries can be
operated‘ on a regular five-day
basis. Where, in the interests
of higher profits, continuous
seven - day around-the-clock
operations a r e maintained,
then workers in this indus-
try, as is now being done
in other industries, should be
compensated for being ‘ de-
prived of their right to a nor-
mal and regular family life.”

Actiu of AFL-CIO on Civil

Rights Fails to Heal Dispute

BAL HARBOR, F1a.—A move to heal the civil rights dispute within the AFL--

CIO appeared to be * short-lived during the merged federation’s convention here last

month, despite unanimous adoption of a civil rights resolution by the delegates.
Prior to the opening of the convention, AFL-CIO President George Meany had

agreed to recognize and work with the Negro American Labor Council in fighting dis-

crimination Within the la-
bor movement. Meany pre-
viously, had followed a policy
of refusing to recognize the
NALC or deal with it in any
way.’
it 5!! *

, THERE was also some indi-
cation that Meany might with-
draw the AFL-CIO’s R censure
of A. Philip Randolph, Presi-
dent of the Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Porters and the
only Negro member of the
AFL-CIO’s executive board,
for his charges that the fed-
eration had failed ‘to eradi-
cate racism in its own house.
Randolph is head of the
NALC. .

Before the convention was
over, however, Meany accused
Randolph of running out on _a
pledge to avoid speaking criti-
cally of the executive council,
which had acted to censure
Randolph. On the other hand
Randolph, who denied he
made any promises about

what he would say to conven-
tion delegates, charged Meany
with reneging on -his assur-

ance that he would ask the ex- -

ecutive council to reconsider
its censure action.
*9 I61 bk

IN THE civil rights resolu-
tion adopted by the conven-
tion, the federation pledged
that it would “intensify its
drive to make fully secure
equal rights for all Americans
in every field of life and to
assure for all workers with-
out‘ regard to race; color, creed,
national origin or ancestry the

_full benefits of union mem-

bership.” .

The new civil rights policy,
however, emphasized volun-
tary compliance by affiliates
with the principle of ending ra-
cial bias in their ranks, instead
of the compulsory :require-
ment proposed by Randolph
and the‘ NALC. ’
