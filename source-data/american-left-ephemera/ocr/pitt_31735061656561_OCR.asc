The following is the full text of cable sent on
George C. Marshall by Eugene Dennis, Genet

Hon. George C. Marshall,

Secretary of State, U.S.A.
%United States Embassy,
Moscow, USSR.

Dear Mr. ~ Secretary:

I have read with deep interest the definition of democracy which you
presented. in behalf of the American Government to the Council of Foreign
Ministers on March 14.

Whatever one may think about applying those democratic rights to
‘ALL persons in Germany, I believe those rights must be guaranteed for
the American people, regardless of race, national origin, creed or political
affiliation. ' H '

I I wish to ‘call to your attention that Representative J. Parnell Thomas,
Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American‘ Activities, announced
on March 15,'that his Committee will open hearings March 24 on HR 1884,
HR 2122 /-and other bills designed to abridge the constitutional rights of
Communists and to outlaw the American Communist Party.

The proposed legislation which will be considered by the above-mentioned
House Committee hearings, would deny the right, enunciated by you, of
“freely constituted political parties” to participate “in a free and competitive
election system.” ' ‘

It would also nullify “the uniformly effective ' guarantee of freedom  A H

of press and radio,” in all parts of the United States.

Among those who will testify at the House Committee hearings,
starting March 24, as announced by Rep. Thomas, will be Secretary of
Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach. Mr. Schwellenbach has recommended that
Congress shall pass legislation banning the Communist Party and barring
it from participating in federal elections.

Legislations is also pending both in the House Committee on Un-
American Activities and in the House and Senate Labor Committees
abridging the “uniformly effective guarantee of the rights of free trade
unions” in all parts of the United States. '

v Included in this legislation is the proposal that patriotic American
citizens, who are Communists, or who are suspected of being Communists,
shall be barred from employment in government and industry, membership
in trade unions, and denied thegright to hold elective office in trade unions.
This, too, is in violation of your statement that: - A

 

Committee hearings, scheduled to open March 24,

 

“To us a society is not free if law-abiding citizens live in fearxof being
denied the right to work or deprived of life, liberty and the - pursuit of
happiness.”

I therefore respectfully urge that you authorize the State Department
representatives in Washingotn to submit as testimony before the House
your definition of
democracy. F

I also respectfully suggest that you recommend to the Congress that
the democratic principles which you outlined in your statement shall be
applicable to all Americans, including trade unionists, Communists, the
Negro people and the foreign-born. I have special reference to the five basic
principles you mentioned: I -

First, an “effective guarantee of civil rights . . . ”

Second, a “uniformly effective guarantee of the rights of political
parties . . . Freely constituted political parties should be insured the right
to participate in a free and competitive election system, win adherents, and
obtain just re-presentation.” '

Third, a “uniformly effective guarantee of the rights of free trade
unions . . . The rights offree and autonomous trade unions to carry on the
customary trade union activties. in accordance with the Wishes of their mem-
bers should be clearly established.” _ '

Fourth, a “uniformly effective guarantee of freedom of press and
radio . . . ”

Fifth, an “effective guarantee of freedom of movement for persons.”

' I respectfully submit, that the presentation or these views by the
State Department to the Congress will help ...every American citizen preserve
for himself those “constitutional guarantees of his basic rights and liberties,”
of which you speak. ‘ W,

Respectfully,

EUGENE DENNIS,

General Secretary, Communist Party,
35 East 12th Street,

Hie danger is reuI— tlre danger is no w!

  The reactionaries are moving fast in Washington. They hope

to put this shameful move over before people wake up to what
is happening.

But we Communists have faith in the American people. We
believe Americans are too smart to let democracy be taken
away from them behind the smokescreen of a hysterical red
scare.

Do YOU want fascism in America? If you don't, then for your
own sake. . . for your children's sake. . . for America's sake . . .

it, is your duty to speak out now!
