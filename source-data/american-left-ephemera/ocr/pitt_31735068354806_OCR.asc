McCarran’s subpena to Dolan was
seen as quick retaliation against the
reporter’s probe,‘in what was a_ bold
attempt. to interfere" with the freedom
of the press. _

Morris Wright, editor of THE .

McCarran" attempt at intimidation,
THE UNION will carry Do1an’s full

Flaxer cited for contempt of ‘Congress

mand forfthe union's membership list
has been blasted by even the IIl_0St
conservative union leaders as ‘a shock-
ing invasion of the traditional. and
hardwon right of secrecy.

McCarran’s attack on Mine-Mill was
also believed to have stemmed‘ from
the fact that our union stands for
everything to which he is opposed. The
Nevada senator has been a key leader
in the drive for tighter and more re- "
pressive thought-control laws. He was ‘

Q HOW IT‘ WORKS ,
The_ kind of “hearing” to beheld in
Salt Lake City October 8 is well des-

’ cribed by Prof. Zechariah Chafee,'iJr.,.

of the Harvard Law School, one of the

nation’s outstanding authorities on the .
Constitution, in his recent pamphlet,_

“Thirty-five" rem with Freedom _of
Speech”, Chafee writes:7 A
“A person who is " snbpenaed into» a
lcgislat-_ive “investigation, w h e r 9 his
reputation and perhaps his livelihood
is at stake, is denied much. of the'pro-
tection long enjoyed by those who“_risk

giniprisonment or fine. He is not told

what he is charged with [before he pre-

. ‘pares his defense andistarts answering

questions; -the ‘investigators have a
raving commission to find out anything

“ whatever that will damage him.-

“He cannot demand to be confronted
with the witnesses against ‘him, for
they may be spies whose identity the
secret police do not want disclosed. So
he may not know‘ who his accusers are,
and in any event he cannot cross-
ezvamine them. The normal right; to
counsel is ‘denied. Sometimes he can-
noterencbring dlawyer into the room
with him.”_ , . “ —

YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Terri-

the Con Sub Local 802, headed by ‘Jack

Garrity, ha won a new agreement
which brings‘ wage increases of from

7 to 19c, recognition of contract com- _

mittee, also agreement between union
and company to extend plan A & B

insurance to provide more coverage.

The company agreed to have full in-
vestigation into the cook house and
streamlining of grievance procedure.

,The present board rate will stay in
effect for the contract year.

The ba.gaining committee recom-
mended the settlement to the Con Sub
Local membership unanimously. The
membership voted concurrence, 78 to 5.

The Bargaining Committee of the
Con Sub Local are to be congratulated
on the way they conducted bargaining.
For the_ first time to be involved in
bargaining, President Jack Garrity of
Local 802 is to be congratulated for the

. fine job done. .

Every member of th Bargaining

.. Committee took their»re‘sponsibility like
real trade unionists and after a thor- ‘

no hesitation in making their unani-
mous recommendations to the member-
ship, according to Int’l Rep. Martin

Woodworkers compromise

« to end 7-week strike
VANCOUVER, B. C.—The seven
strike of the International

No. 1, ended July 28 with the union

and the operators accepting a “compro-
V mise” recommended during last week’s

mediation meetings by Mr. Chief Jus-
tice Gordon M. Sloan, accepted as medi-
ator by both sides.

Judge Sloan had recommended a
wage increase of 51/2 tents an hour,
with three paid statutory holidays, and

DAWSON, Yukon\‘Territory —-
Dawson Miners Union, Local 564

upheld the frontier tradition of 71

the Yukon bylbecoming the first

' local union to be organized into

Mine-Mill in the Canadian North-
west. It is also the farthest north
local of the International, and its
jurisdiction probably, covers more
ground than any.

It was chartered August 1944, to op-
erate in holdings of the Yukon Con-
solidated Gold Corporation which, with
a virtual monopoly of the Yukon pla-
cer fields, has nearly a dozen camps
sprawled out in a fifty mile radius
around Dawson.

This situation, and the fact that the
placer mining is seasonal, serves up
some peculiar problems to the local,
which up to now has never failed to

solve them with the resource and
courage of traditional pioneers.

FROM APRIL until November the
local has about 400 members, but for
"the rest of the year the membership
drops to around one—tenth that num-
ber while the Yukon holes up with the
bears for the long Arctic night.

Former Int’l. rep. “Wild Bill” Mont-
gomery used to service the local from
Alaska, but it is now taken care of by
Int’l rep. Barney McGuire from his
headquarters in Prince Rupert, B. C.

SLOAN REFUSED to recommend
the so-called “Sloan formula” of union
security, operative in the Mine-Mill
Trail local, on the ground that the IWA
had not acted “in a responsible man-
ner" in the initiation of the strike, they
having called it without a government-

conducted vote, contrary to B. C. law."

Over 30,000 woods and mill workers
are expected to go back to work im-
mediately, although due to the strike
having been called during the “fire
season,” woods operations may be cur-
tailed for some time.

However, a considerable reserve of
logs will permit_the mills to resume
work at once. ’ ’ '

The union had asked for 35.cents an

hour, union security, and many other.

fringes, to bring them up to the stand-

_ ards of the province in other basic in-

dustries. The result is discouraging
to the building trades and other unions
now out on strike, but cannot be
ascribed in any degree to lack of mili-
tancy on the part of the rank-and-file
IWA members, who have evinced their
determination in many areas ‘and inci-
dents.

VANCOUVER, B.C. -— A further
crack in the formerly resolute front
of B.C. employers against wage in-
creases was opened July 25 by an
average increase of 25 cents an hour
in the Reeves McDonald mine at
Remac. ‘

This brings that base metal producer
up to—« the copper operational scale in
this province.

Eight statutory holidays, with dou-
ble time if worked are also included,
and shift differentials are increased to
five and eight cents. A One week vaca-
tion after one year, and two weeks
after two years are also provided.

Local 901, Nelson and District Mine
a.nd Mill Workers Union, also Won the
Rand Formula, whereby all emplﬁyees
covered by the agreement have union
dues checked off by the company as a
condition of employment. I

The local and company also share

» the costs of a $1,000 sickness and acci-

dent benefit plan.

On the negotiating committee for
Local 901 were E. J. Leclerc, G. J.
Belanger, G o r d 0 n Sutherland, and
M. O. Bellavance, with Business Agent
W. C. Muir of the Remac‘ unit of Local
901 and District President Ken Smith
assisting.

The agreement was attained after
a conciliation board had been estab-
lished, -which‘ adjourned to permit fur-
ther direct negotiations.

The contract is generally conceded to
be the best yet arrived at by any local
of any 1113311 in British Columbia this
year. ' - ‘

480 WINS GRIEVANCE

TRAIL, B. C.———Mine-Mill’s Local 480
here has won its fight against‘ a 4%
cent hourly pay out which the company
tried to put over‘ on 17 carpenters

working in smelter revision.

In the course of_ pressing the griev-
ance, three union members, Brothers
Walsh, Jensen and Kurulock were dis-
charged. In the arbitration decision,
the company was ordered to reinstate
Jensen. The ruling on the carpenters’

wages meant that the company had to,

send a back pay check for $7.18 to Nick
Kurulock. '

Payment of the check to Kurulock
proved that he was quite correct in
taking up the grievance, and that the
company should have settled without
any stalling, so that no one would have
been fired. 0

miner has almost set in this corner of

The company takes full advantage of
its monopoly, and can pull powerful
strings in government circles at Otta-
wa to insure that its operations are not
subjected too much to the precautions
and restrictions that surround mining
in organized provinces.

WORKMEN’S Compensation amend-
ments were recently fought through by
the local which still leave much to be
desired when "compared with British
Columbia, but are infinitely better than
the provisions which prevailed before.
The local has also fought for and
achieved sanitary regulations govern-
ing camps, holidays with pay, and ‘an
hours-of-work“ ordinance which betters

 

  

from, and in many cases, against the _

active resistance of the company.

Due to its policy of bringing in more ~

workers than it needs every season,
the Yukon Consolidated can keep a la-
bor reserve at Dawson which can play
ball or ' be stranded in this outpost
where the cost of living and transpor-
tation outside is such as to appall

. those Mine-Mill members in more cli- I

matically-favored communities.

The local, under the leadership of
Mike Comadina, who is- also an alder-
man of Dawson City,’is demanding
that the Territorial Government stop
the practice of bringing in surplus la-
bor, and with Bob Minet, executive
member from Bear Creek, is pressing

 HENEVER a Mine—Mill negotiating

 committee mentions the cost of living these
a A days, the boss tries /to change the subject in
‘_ a hurry. He has »ai good reason.

The cost of living has started to climb
again——fast; And there are three new big

. reasons why_it’s going to keep on going up
8 for a long time before it levels off once
.‘ more. They are—— ’ 

»-—The new steel price increase of $5.20 a

ton, which Price Stabilizer Ellis Arnall
sayswill cost the average American fam-
ily about $100 a year in higher prices.

;--The swiss cheese (lots of big, holes)
amendments to the Defense Production 4

Act passed by Congress in June, which
guarantees a big new round of inflation.‘

most conservative economists refuse to es-
timate how many billions of» dollars in in-
flation this law will cause in the next
year. ' c '

Virginia estimates will cost U. S. house-

 period was the greatest in any single month

‘ -President Truman that it may be necessary

to call a special session’ of Congress if food
prices “continue to get out of hand.” Arnall
ﬂatly predicts “constant and steady” ‘con-
sumer price rises in the months ‘ahead.
Economic "Stabilizer Roger Putnam says

the profit,-hungry steel operators held a

“loaded gun” at the government’s head un-

-  til they got their $5.20-a-ton price increase.
The boost was almost twice as much, as the

in the price of widely-used aluminum, which

in turn is bound to be followed by boosts

in prices of all utensils and appliances con-

taining aluminum. The chain reaction push-

ing up prices of thousands of products made

from steel and aluminum parts was expected _

to be quick. ,

Biggest "boost to inflation, however, has
already begun under the Defense Produc-

tion Act amendments, which caused the -
overall cost of living to. hit a new all-time ‘

high in mid-June, even according to the dis-
torted Bureau/of Labor Statistics index.

The new law exempts fruits and vege- (

tables -—- fresh, canned and frozen ‘-—- from
all price controls, and guarantees higher’
prices on milk, ‘meats and other foods by~a
series of . tricky amendments which serve
to make “ceilings” on prices a complete

New record. every month

The BLS cost of living index, which is
notorious for the ways in which it under-
plays the real increases in prices —— climbed
by mid-June to anew peak of 91.1 per cent
over the 1935-39 average. This is the “old”
BLS index, on which the Wage- formulas of
the Wage Stabilization Board. have been
based. =
' ‘As a result of ‘the virtual junking of all
controls on food, egg prices‘ jumped more
than 3‘ per cent in June and another 18 a

per cent in July. During the first half of Li

July, prices of milk, butter,‘ meats, poultry,

fish and many vegetables -— including po- V

tatoes — moved up. The experts who prepare

« the BLS “cost of living” index are already

saying that the all-time peak reached in June,
would be topped by a new high mark in July.

Price Stabilizer Arnall says, there is rea-
son to believe “the cost of living will set a
new all-time record every month for the

next year.” And he warns consumers they -

will have to pay more for food, refrigerators,
washing machines, autos and scores of other
items. Other OPS officials admit they are
already preparing to announce hikes in
prices of such items as floor coverings and

A many types of finished textiles.

Arnall also adds that the public can ex-
expect “higher living" costs, further depre-

ciatiofkof the dollar . .  The: ugly picture of >

rising prices is plain to anyone with _a de-
sire to see it.” _ j "

RENT is another big item on which in-
flationary jumps can‘ be expected shortly.

‘The 10 cities listed here are among 34 major American
cities in which th.e U. S. Labor Department checks on what it
costs for a family. of, four to live. These 10 werepiclcecl for
listing because there are Mine-M ill locals in all of them."

The figures in this chart were issued
by the Bureau of Labor-Statistics. They
show what the BLS experts say it took
for a family of four to get along on a
“modest but average" living. standard
in October, 1951. A b

When they say “modest but aver-
age," they mean a bare minimum which
provides for no more than absolute,
necessities. It allows one used car every
seven years. ct wool suit for the wife of
the family every nine years and a wool
dress every five years.

The budget is for a family of four in-"

ices than the I-lel1er——-"minimum health
and decency” budget. A . .

This "family budget'7 is different from
the BLS Consumer Price Index. which
does NOT includesuch important items
as taxesand savings. and which is A
not really\—a cost-of-living index; even
though it is often used as such.

     
  

It _allows less for food, medical care, ’

The figures inlthe table are for_Oc-
tober, 1951. Remember, prices have risen
sharply in the 10 ‘months since then—so
the figures are already out of date. 4‘

Between October, 1950 and October,
1951. the Labor Department's Price In-

dex went up 7 per cent. But the cost of A 1
the “family .buc_lget" went up more than”
10 per cent during the same period. The .

difference is extremely important.

Even though it doesn't do thejob ade-
quately, the "family budget" is still a
better measure of how living costs are
going up than the Consumer Price In-
dex; But the Price Index is what ‘the
Wage Stabilization Board uses to tie

Wages to the freeze.
' Iust to ‘keep pace with the increased 1

cost of living for the one yearvfrom
.October, 1950 to October, 1951, the
workers supporting three dependents
would have had to get a basic wage
increase of 17 to 25.cents an hour.

 

MAC WON'T ASTARVE

U. S. taxpayers were angry last week
at the news that.ex—General ‘Doulas
.MacArthur was going to keep on get-
ting -his $19,548 in army pay even.
though he's gone to “work” at Reming-
ton Rand, Inc., at a reported salary of
$100,000 a year.

MacArthur was made chairman of
the board of directors at Remington

labor record which employs some 36,000 ,
workers in 22 U. S.‘ plants and 23 fa_c-
tories in 15' foreign countries.

Congress has adjour,ned———-but big business isn’t lettingup
in its many-sided attacks on organized labor. A

The Guaranty Survey, monthly publication of ﬂthe.'New ‘ 

York Guaranty Trust Co., carries a frontal attack on industry-

wide bargaining in its J uly‘ issue. The Guaranty bank is a J. P.

Morgan.‘ enterprise. 9 , ' .
The bank’s letter made .. clear that it wants the power of

“big unions” cutdown and it thinks bargaining should be put’

on a‘ single plant or single company basis. It says: —

- “The only solution of the problem that is in harmony with .
the basic American principles of free labor and free enterprise

is to limit the size of the bargaining unit.” I
1 It was recalled that during the recent steel industry dis-
pute, a number of congressmen introduced bills to outlaw
industry-Wide bargaining. Many of the big‘, business spokesmen
who testified before Congressional committees urged that such
a law be enacted. . , j ‘
Demands to ban industry-wide bargaining ignore the fact
that in all the big industries, the companies have their industry-
'wide associations through which they present a united front

to the unions. J. P. Morgan partners, who have controlling ‘

interests in Anaconda, Phelps-Dodge and Kennecott, are able
to enforce the same kind of labor policies in "every plant of
thoseicompanies just by issuing a single order. ' '

The only answer to a solid front of the employers, in an
industry is, of course, a solid front of the workers in that
-industry. That means industry-wide hybargaiiiiiig. Attacks on
industry-wide bargaining are therefore‘ clearly intended to.
weakenthé power of the unions,. strengthen-the power of the
.corporations.  . A «

TEHACHAPI
TEHACHAPI, Calif. —— Letters and

t'elegrams continue to arrive asking for
information on the quake and how the

local and membership are making out,

according to business agent Bob Hol-
lowwa.

Homes were damaged far more than
first reports indicated. A survey shows
walls knocked out, some down plaster
on frame houses knocked off, etc. Over
400 families are still without a place to
cook meals. In one block, nine families
are sleeping in their yards and cook-

 ing on camp-type stoves.

The. Monolith:Portland Cement Com-
pany is refusing all vacations and leave
of "absences. Workers are leaving.

The short shocks have become far-

ther apart and indications are that our __
heavy shocks are over. Yet when one

hits, everybody runs outside. .

Hollowwa has discussed the prob-
lems of the members with the Red
Cross and city officials, urging that
house trailers be brought in as one
measure to help the people until houses
can be rebuilt. '

Temporary ‘headquarters for Local
550 have been set up in a hotel. The
executive board and stewards’ council
meet there. Local union meeetings will
have to be held outdoors.

MT. PLEASANT

MT. PLEASANT, Tenn.—'Two im-
portant grievances have ‘been won by
Local 279 at the Virginia-Carolina
Chemical Corp. plant here. -

James Johnson gets one full month’s

. back pay as a result of one of the vic-

tories. And Jesse Dawson has been

, reinstated with full seniority rights as

9. result of the other. In both cases,
the workers had been unjustly dis-
charged. Commenting on the grievance
victories, one worker said:

“This just shows what a good union
will do. Without the union .these broth-
ers would have lost their jobs —— but
now they are back.”

 PULASKIC

PULASKI, Tenn. — Lo cal 486 has

chalked up a batting average of _tw6"

out of three in fighting on grievances
recently.

In one case, three hours pay was won
for each of seven menlwho had been
sent back home by the- company one
day last November, when an arbitra-
tion hearing was to be held.

In another case,’ Mahlon Wright -was
taken from his senior job and put on a.
labor. job, then laid off. The arbitra-’
tor ruled that Mahlon should be paid
the‘ difference between the carpenter's
rate—the job on which he should have
been put—and the labor rate for all the
days he worked at the labor rate.

PHEGELER

DANVILLE, Ill.—Hegeler -Zinc

' workers were locked out last week. This

was part of the company’s campaign of
stubborn refusal to grant anything but

' \a 1_0-centrwage increase.

When the workers of Hegeler Local
209 reported for work after a 4-day
stoppage that had been called in protest
against company stalling, they were
refused admittance. All shifts reported
for work, and then filed claims for un-
employment insurance, according to
Int’l rep. Jesse Van Camp.

CARLSBAD

CARLSBAD, N. M.—Mine Mill Local
.415 has opened acampaign to correct
unsafe conditions at the Duval Sulphur
& Potash Co. mine, a;. new property
now in process of organization.

Local 415’s president E. N. Gibbs

wrote to_ state mine inspector John .

Garcia last month about the lack of
proper safety precautions by the com-
pany. Within a few days Garcia replied,
agreeing that all the safety hazards
mentioned by Gibbs must be corrected.

Gibbs’_ letter—and Garcia’s reply—-

were widely publicized in this area by .

leaflets and through Local 415’s paper,
“Potash Dust.” As a result the Duval
workers report that the company has
alreadybegun to correct some of the
conditions. ’

The union is now demanding that
some real safety. rules be -established
at the Duval mine and that a rank—and-
file safety committee be set up to en-
force the rules.

LEADVILLE, Colo. —— The firemen
employed by this city have now won
their first union contract—and it’s a
Mine-Mill ‘contract.

The firemen have belonged to Local

ment with city fathers has always been
a verbal one. Now ‘it's been put in
writing, and among other things it in-
cludes two more days of vacation 2.

Trail members pay last
respects to Ken Uzelac

The workers in Trail and his old
fellow hard rock miners are saddened
by the tragic death by drowning of
Kenny Uzelac, a militant member of
Mine-Mill since its rebirth in this
Province some fifteen years ago. f

Many will remember Kenny as th
man who was employed at Pinchi Lake
as a minerrby the C.M. & S. Co. Ltd.
and after giving notice of quitting to

i join the Canadian Army, was per-

suaded to work one last shift, which he
did. The ensuing accidental fall down
a mine shaft of several hundred feet
and Kenny’s successful fight ‘to recover
from multiple in j u r i e s therefrom

- . stands as one of the epic stories’ of the

hardrock miners of the West.

Kenny played an active role in the
long fight in Trail against the Steel
raiders. During the vote that resulted
in thefinal humiliating defeat of Steel,
Kenny was in the Trail Tadanac Hos-
pital. ’

"It will always be an inspiration to
honest workers in Trail and especially
those on that particular polling booth
when Kenny came limping along, the
sweat pouring down his face, and w ar-
ing that big happy grin. Yes, Kenny

had sneaked away from his hospital .

bed, crippled_ and painful though he
was, to vote for his Union, Mine-Mill,
Local 480. , _ e .

Kenny was buried Saturday, July
26th, and many friends thronged to the
United Church in Trail to pay their
last respects to an honest, happy and
warm hearted guy. '_

Those that knew him will never for-
get . . . Kenny Uzelac.

LOS ANGELES

LOS ANGLES, Calif.—Western Me-

That’s why L. V. Collinshas justwon
an award calling forfive weeks of back
unemployment benefits. Here’s the
story: , .1 ’ ,

Collins had been fired after being
away from work because of illness; al-
though he had complied with Adams-
Campbell rules: requiring that he notify
the company of his absence and the
reason for it. ‘ ' e »

-A local official of the unemployment
compensation office denied his jobless
compensation. So Collins took his case
to’ the union, which in turn obtained
the services of Union Research _&,In-
formation Service. -

Union Research carried the case to
the Division of Appeals, which upheld

Collins and ordered that he get the

back compensation benefits.

The anti-Roosevelt Minnesota Demo-
crat has let the union-busting cat out

violation of the Taft—Hartley law for
an employer to play one union against
another, Humphrey said: ,

“ ‘Oh, yes. But we must be sophis-
ticated about this.. There are a hun-
dred subtle ways in whichan employer

/if he wants to, can play off one union

against another, And he can do it

_ without technically running afoul of '

intelligent people have the courage to
speak up and defeat the lunatics, we
may soon find the lunatics in control
of American schools.



I ‘purge’

The N a-fion sees emergency 

in U.S. civil liberties

One of America’s oldest magazines,
The Nation, has declared a “state of
emergency” in the field of civil
"liberties.

The magazine, founded in 1865 as
part of the Civil War movement for

emancipation, devoted an entire issue

late» in June to a detailed- breakdown
of ways in which civil liberties are
being destroyed. Fifteen writers con-
tributed to the issue.

“From 1945 on it has been war——
against ALL labor organizations,"
says Arthur Eggleston, labor columnist
for the New York Compass in an
articleon labor and civil rights.

“No matter how ‘anti—Communist’
theunion and its leaders maybe, no

matter how» actively they support the '

defense program or the Administra-
tion, when itrcomes to cents-per-hour,
contract benefits, and labor’s /rights to
an equal voice in determining wages

and conditions, the war is against all g

the unions,” he adds. .

/‘Effective unions and leaders can

never ‘purge’ themselves unless they
allow themselves to be captured,
neutralized, or destroyed.‘

“The witch hunt is a tested. device.
The first recorded use of the ‘foreign
agent’. theory of labortroubles was in
Boston in the 1820's. Carpenters struck
for the 10-hour day. The master-
employers could notibelieve fthis proj-

ect to have originated with any of the .

faithful and industrious Sons of New
England, but are compelled to consider
it an evil of foreign growth.’

“So it is today.“ Under the guise of
rooting o_utl‘foreign agents,’ the drive
got under way in 194?’ with the loyalty
of government employees a;
year after the U.S.’ Chamber of Com-

l

merce suggested that this might be‘

necessary. Then came the Chamber’s

demand for publication of a list of ‘~

‘Communist-controlled front organiza-
tions and labor unions_’——a suggestion
now being seriously considered by the
labor-management subcommittee to the

Senate Labor and Public Welfare Com-  

mittee. *

“But the real drive was fore-
shadowed in a report of the Chamber
early in 1.947 on ‘Communists within
the labor movement, which predicted:
"It is probable thatthe 80th Congress
will modify the Wagner Actso that
_employers can work more ‘effectively
and without ‘fear of law violation with
American-minded employees in oppos-
mg Communists within the labor move-
ment.’ Congress got, the point im-
mediately and in June, 1947, passed
the¥Taft-Hartley Act. '-

“So the witch hunt, which began _i

’w5th“foreign agents,’ is being extended
to cover liberals of all shades of eco-
nomic and political belief. _Those who
do not conform must be barred. from
factories, business offi_ces,‘schools, col-
leges, government, the entertainment
world—in short, from their jobs.”
lExplaining why this issue of The

I

Nationiwas titled. How Free is Free? _

editor Freda Kirchwey’ said that the
question _“cannot;much longer gaun-
answered lest welose ‘eveniithe freedom
to ask it." .

Miss Kirchwey said Americans are
being “drawn into a single, framework
of what constitutes conformity——and
the namelof thisysort of conformity is
fascism.” The answer, she says, lies in
political action:’ “The elections offer a

chance to focus and organize the scat-‘

tered movements of" resistance.”

Red boiiier Carey gets red bullied

by om exper'|' in Humphrey hearing‘

WASHINGTON, D. C.-CIO secre-
tary-treasurer James Carey, who went
before the Humphrey labor subcommit-
tee recently and tried to smear another
union, was himself smeared before the
same committee soon afterward.

Carey, who is also president of the
CIO Int’l Union of Electrical,,Radio
and Machine Workers, charged that
General Electric Corp. had worked with
the independent United Electrical Ra-
dio & Machine Workers to keep IUE
out of GE plants.

GE vice president L. R. Boulware
then appeared before" the Humphrey
committee, backed by truckloads of
documentary evidence, and proved that
Carey himself had worked in collabora-
tion with the company in his jurisdic-
tional fight with UE.  \

_B0ULWARE called Carey’s charge.

against UE “untruthful, deceitful and
irresponsible.” He added that Carey
knew the charge was “fantastic” when

dent of U.  Steel, Philip Murray, president of (IO and Steelworkers, and James
Thimmes, vice-president of union. Murray invitedobosses, to speak, and proposed that

Steel ‘locals. b

he” and President -Ben l-‘airless of U. S. Steel make a tour to appear before all muior

  

 

he made it. Carey, said Boulware, “was
shamefully un'truthful.”

, Then Boulwareturned on the entire A

CIO. -He expressed’open doubt that
UE, Mine-Mill and other unions were
expelledefrofn C10 in 1949 because of
alleged Communist domination. “It
seems to us,” he said, “that the organi-
zations were expelled .. . chiefly be.
cause they had refused to follow the

political and other policies which had . S

been adopted and endorsed by the CIO.”

And the GE vice president Went on g
to develop .the idea that the whole CIO ‘
should be suspected of sinister, sub-

versive beliefs.
Then he raised a threat to all of

organized labor by demanding a law '

setting up a new government agency to
identify Communists in labor organiza-

tions and bar them from positions of .‘

influence.

Two “unfriendly? witnesses who also
appeared before the Humphrey sub-
committee were UE organization direc-
tor Matles and Washington representa-
tive Nixon. They showed how Carey’s
activities violated CIO policy.

THEY POINTED OUT that C10 presi-

 

dent Murray and nearly all other CIO , .

officers had asked the Humphrey group
to drop its hearings, which have been
a sounding board for anti-union propa-
ganda by big business. But Carey took

full part in the hearings, enlisting.

Humphrey’s aid in h_i§ War with UE.
Nixon also produced evidence to show

that proposals Humphrey has made as

subcommittee ch'airman are" almost

_ identical with those of Sen.’ Pat_McCar-

ran (D. Nev.) .

Humphrey regards himself as a lib-
eral and an enemy of McCarran pro-
posals. Nixon pointed out that McCar-
ran’s bills——S1975 and S2548——would
remove company obligation to deal with
a union whose members are Communist
according to the Internal Security Re-
view Board and would prohibit employ-
ers from bargaining with such unions.
McCarran’s. bill would also allow em-
ployers to fire any employe who is
called a Communist. »

 HEAD5 WALL

THE “Fair Dealers” ‘were routed by the big city

Dixiecrats at the Democratic Party’s convention here.

"‘We’ve had the double-cross of our lives. _ _
working against us here and I don’_t have to tell youriohat it is,” was

the way F.’ D. Roosevelt Jr. put it.

, Richard Sasuly of the labor press service, Federated Press, re-
ported that the whole show was “domi- ' .

nated by men like Rayburn, Demo-

‘cratic national chairman Frank Mc-

Kinney, Jim Farley; CWCQQO 5033 Jake
Arvey and -the ‘political bosses of

“Kansas City, Pennsylvania and New

Jersey. They evidently will also domi-

there are to be‘such, in cooperation

' with the Southerners who already head

most of the Congressional committees."

THE TEST of the Convention’s sin-
cerity on its civil rights plank came on
the fourth day when the delegates‘ took
9,. rollcall on whether or not to bar the
flagrantly _Jim Crow delegations from
Virginia, Louisiana and South Caro-
lina. The disputed delegates had re-

.fused_, even to accept a mild and con-

ciliatory “loyalty pledge” to make ef-

,~nate\future Democratic Congresses, if .

forts to put the convention nominees ‘
S . on the ballot in their states.

The rollcall dragged on for an hour.’

Meantime, Jacob Arvey, the Illinois

 boss and a kingpin in the draft-Steven-

 son, movement, was working on the

Illinois delegation. Most of them had
voted to enforce the loyalty pledge.
After ’Arvey worked them‘ over, they

, switched and-threw most of their 60

votes to admitting Virginia.
Pennsylvania, another key state in

the Stevenson movement and tightly

held by the political bosses, had al-

"ready voted for admission of_ the Dixie-

crats. James ‘A. Farley and other polti-
cal bosses were seen busily passing
from delegation to delegation on the

' floor." In the end they switched enough
' (votes to admit Virginia. The same

coalition won every _other test of

strength. i

“The Democratic civil rights position
in 1952,” reports Sasuly, “remains

pretty much where. it wasgin 191.8. ‘If

anything,-it probably moved slightly to

- _l the right. Consideringvthat the 191,8

plank. led to exactly no action through
four years of Democratic administra-
tion,'it is hard to see action coming
out of‘the Z952 plank eit__her—unless

there is great pressure from outside

Congress.”

THE LABOR PLANK, was almost -»

exactly the same as the one adopted by
the 1948 convention. It declared:: “We
‘strongly advocate the repeal of the
Taft-Hartley Act.” Four years of in-

action separated the two identical la-

bor planks. , -

Labor witnesses appearing before
the convention’s platform committee
stressed the fact that it wasn’t enough
to have Democratic majorities in Con-

is needed is the kind of Democratic
majority that would be willing to car-
ry out platform pledges. The,§commit-
tee smiled and agreed. But as one ob-
served commented: ‘

“The liberals and labor won the plat-
form; the regulars and Dixiecrats won
the party machinery. How the plat-

‘_.form’s.pledges can beachieved without

a change in Democratic party machin-

' - cry is a mystery which the convention

_ failed to unravel.”

NOT EVEN MENTIONED in the
platform were the Smith and McCar-

. ran laws, which have beenattacked by

most of labor as violations of basic
civil liberties of all. Unions lost
ground slightly on other labor issues in
the new platform. In 1948,‘the ‘Demo-
crats went on record for a specific in-
crease in the federal minimum wage
to 75 cents an hour. This year's plank
said only that minimum Wagesshould
be “consistent with present-day prog-
ress."

In the same way, the‘1948 platform
said social security benefits should be
increased at least 50 per cent. The

C ‘- 1952 version said there should. be im-

. provements but mentioned no amounts.

Only a faint echo of the Fair Deal
campaign for national health insur-
ance appeared in the 1952 platform.

THE Democratic and Republican conventions have given proof, if
any were needed, that Big Business owns thesefpolitical parties. News-
papers that Speak for Wall Street have said, in" effect, that they will be
happy with either Eisenhower or Stevenson.

It is part of an old plan that, the Democratic Party should. put on a
liberal front to snare the votes of labor and others interested in social legis-
lation. LABOR LEADERS wHO TOOK PART IN THIS YEAR'S CONVENTION

The nomination of Adlai Stevenson
as Democratic candidate for President
didn't come till latethe fourth day—-
but it was a sure thing from the hour
the convention began. The northern big
city bosses and Dixiecrats had only to
put the finishing touches on their
“draft” by the time the delegates as-
sembled. . ‘ v

Stevenson himself .made the choice

‘of John Sparkman of Alabama as his

running-mate, quickly approved. by; the

Labor pulled strings

I for Stevenson?-.--Hcvrdly. 

. After Alben Barkley withdrew from

- the race for Democratic presidential

nomination in favor of Adlai Steven-

ison, newspapers across the -co.untry
' shouted that the convention had been
’ taken. over by “labor bosses.” ‘

Truth is, the men behind the scenes"
did not want Barkley. They maneuvered
to let so—called leaders of labor take
the blame for ditching an old man

A Whom many people like.»

Early in the convention week, man-
aging editor Bernard Tassler of the
American Federationist, AFL monthly
magazine, sent awire to President Tru-

man strongly condemning Stevenson. ‘

He said the Illinois governor was not
really against the Taft-Hartley law.
- But Stevenson got the nomination—

and with strong support from Truman.-

Here is what,Stevenson said about-
the T-H lawthis spring: “Some fea-
tures of the law seem to me to advance

the cause of good labor relations and ‘
other features, in my opinion, do not. A
I think the Democratic platform should

recommend modifications.” ‘

Platform drafters must have. had
their eye on Stevenson when they
drafted the labor planks. Their prom-
ises to repeal Taft-Hartley contained
two jokers: I E

1) a demand for Presidentiallpower
to “deal. with” strikes, which means
strike—breaking' plant seizure; and l

2) a call for s-ubstitute labor legisla-
tion, without mentioning what kind—
which could lead to a law even worse
than T-‘H’.
