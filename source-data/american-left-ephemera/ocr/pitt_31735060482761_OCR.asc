THE NEGRO QUESTION
Outline and Study Guide for a Five-Session Course

Prepared by the Education Department, Communist Party of New York State

Central Idea

Negro Americans constitute a distinct people within the general popula-
tion of the United States. Further, in the Black Belt of the South, the Negro
people represent a nation oppressed by American imperialism through a semi-feudal
plantation economy. This imperialist oppression arouses the sharpest struggle for
liberation of the Negro people.

4

In present-day America, the Negro people have emerged as an indeperdent
political force of tremendous importance. Increasingly allied with the progressive
forces of organized labor, they constitute a decisive sectcr of the broader demo-
cratic coalition which is struggling to defeat the aggressive imperialism and pro-
fascist reaction which now threaten the security and freedom of all Americans --
indeed, of all the world. ‘

The hope of a democratic and peaceful America in this period depends
primarily upon an increasingly unified and politically developed labor movement
struggling in conscious alliance with an increasingly unified and militant Negro
freedom moveffent -- both directing their power against the common enemy, the resur-
gent and ambitious Americanimperia lism.

Among the Negro people, it is the Negro proletariat which must play the
leading role in building Negro people's “unity and in for gingen effective Negro-
Labor alliance. Among the white population, it is the militant, class-conscious
trade unionists who must play the leading role in cementing this alliance. The
work of the Communist Party, both in ‘the Negro liberation movement and in the labor

movement, will prove decisive in furthering this development on the path toward
democracy and socialism.

This is the central idea of this course on "The Negro Question." There
follows. an outline study-guide which comprehends the main ideas and points of view
it involves ---— with their implications fcr the nation as a whole, and for New York
State in particular.

This five-session course is designed to give an introduction to the Marx-
ist analysis of the Negro Question. It is prepared in connection with the Party's
State-‘-wide Ideological Campaign on the Negro Question. The purpose of this Cam-
paign, and’ of the course, is to deepen the understanding of the Party members on
this issue, and thus to lay the basis for more intensive struggles -for Negro’ demo-
cratic rights and against all fcrms of white chauvinism.

Session 4

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST WHITE CHAUVINISM

Nature of white chauvinism

Definition of clrauvinism: The theory and practice of the superiority of any na-
tion, people, ethnic group, over others_. White chauvinism: the theory and prac-
tice of the superiority of white over "darker" peoples. Also, any actions or ex-
pressions of white superiority. Roots of chauvinism in capitalist exploitation.
Growth of chauvinism and its special importance in era of imperialism. Role of
chauvinism: to rationalize and thereby justify imperialist oppression"; to divide
the working class into hostile groups. '

Reason for struggle against chauvinism

Chauvinism divides the working class, which above all needs unity’. Chauv inism
deprives the working class in the 11.8. of its most important ally, the Negro
people. Chauvinism prevents a united struggle against imperialism on the part
of the workers and the oppressed nations. Chauvinism ~ main weapon of fascism.
Chauvinism opposite of fight for pr oletarian internationalism - essence of
Leninism.

Origin and development oi‘_ chauvinist theories

General principle that chauvinism does not bring about slavery and oppression,
but oppression and slavery breed chauvinism, to rati cnalize and justify the op-'
pression. Origin of white chauvinism in the slave trade. Its developnent to
jus tify the Axrerican slave economy. Its further development to serve the needs
of imperialism in the modern era. The verdict of science: all nations and eth-
nic groups are equal in ability.

Forms of chauvinism in the labor movement

Why chauvinism exists among white workers. Everyday pressures and inflvences.
Role of segregation, theatre, movies, textbooks, belles lettres, newspapers,
radio, advertising.

Subtle and open chauvinism: Recent growth of chauvinism in the labor movement,
with growth of American zimperialism. Subtle forms of chauvinism: failure to
recognize need for special struggle for Negro rights; use of certain expressions:
"humor"; failure to bring Negroes into leadership; relegating Negroes to Negro‘
work; patronage and paternalism in approach to Negroes; approach to Negroes on
basis of Negro question alone; undue familiarity; false sociological and biolo-
gical arguments fer chauvimism. N

The struggle against white crauvinism
Special duty of whites to come forward in the struggle. It is not possible to
go -t oo far in the struggle against chauvinism; there is no such ing as bend-

ing over backwards.

Relation of the struggle against chauvinism to the struggle against petty bour-
geois natiora lism. ‘ ’

(Note _t__o Instructor: We urge you to use instances of chauvinism
as contained in the material provided by the Education Department.)

libera 1 appr oach?

linquent than white’ children, but their envir onmmt has caused them to become

COMMUNIST POLICY AND PROGRAM IN THE STRUGGLE FCR NEGRO LIBERATION

.. la. One nation cannot be free which oppresses another.

_ b. Because Negro people are a powerful ally of the working class in the strug-
gle for peace and security - socialism.

Party Resolution (1946) states:
"Defense of Negro rights has become an imperative and inescapable
task of the American labor and progressive coalition in the struggle
against reaction and the threat of fascism. Such a coalition must
be based solidly upon alliance with the Negro people.“
"Labor in white skin can never emancipate it self where labor in the
black skin is branded."

-- Marx

2. Communist Party has the only prcgram for the final and complete solution
of the Negro Question.

From C.P. position on Negro question:

“Communist Party supports the right of self-determination for the
Negro people c...whose form will be determined by the relationship

of social forces in the country as a whole and by the relation of
the Negro people to the progressive coalition."

U.S.S.R. points the way in its Constitution:

"The equality or the rights of citizens of the USSR, irrespective of
their nationality or race, irrall spheres of economic, state, cultur-
9.1, social and political life, is an indefensible law."

Only socialism banishes national prejudice, race hatred, inequality and
oppression. Socialism guarantees full‘ equality and free union of all
nationalities.

B. Communist ccntributions to Negro liberation struggle:

1. Theoretical contributions of Marxism on the national question in general
and on the Negro que stion in particular.

2. Struggle for the freedom of the Scottsboro boys.
5. Struggle for Angelo Hemdon's freedom.
4. Defense of the Ethiopian people.

5. Negro and white unity in the unemployed struggles.
