INTERNATIONAL BLACK WORKERS CONGRESS

The following draft proposal has been adopted by the founding convention of the International Black Workers Congress. We are withholding the date
and place of the convention because of the intense repression in the United States, but we are building our movement on a solid base of mass support
and believe that we must encourage constructive criticism ojiour ideas.

_ The International Black Workers Congress is an org'anizati*9n ofBlack workers and students who have joined together to further the revolutionary
struggle in the United States and other parts of the world, to consolidate many existing organizations, and to build unity among the
revolutionary Third World Forces. 

A final draft of our Manifesto will be issued after the educational and planning meeting of the International Black Workers Congress to be held
on August 21 and 22, 1971-, in Detroit, Michigan.

We call upon all Third World people to devote their attention to the condition of workers in the United States and other parts of the world.

By the end of 1971, the Congress hopes to estab-
lish at least twenty newspapers throughout the country
speaking directly to the needs of Third World Workers.
This approach of local newspapers, _we believe, is much
better than just the distribution of a national newspaper.
However, a national paper will be published and will
nﬂect the political line of the Congress.

Those who publish newspapers should strive to in-
volve students in the production and distribution. This
is important, for students must learn to work with work-
ers, and workers have a responsibility to educate students
to the political realities and to working class conditions.
Those students who are unwilling to distribute and help
prepare the newspaper are not good candidates for the
organization. But many students will respond to the
calls of the workers. Try. Educate. Try again. But always
relate the student workers to the realities of other work-
ers. Encourage them to go to work in the plants and
organize and learn what production is all about.

(3) Organize according to the natural division of the city.‘
Establish workers’ committees in the various wards of a
city that will implement programs, politicize, distribute
newspapers, and raise funds. We must build a parallel
political structure if we are to be successful in our organ-
izing work.

Decentralization of activities and work must be our
main thrust in program implementation. Centralized
direction ﬂows from the structure of the organization,
but decentralized implementation will help us at all
times to constantly expand our base and get more and
more roots deep into our communities. The deeper our
roots into the community, the harder will it be for the
government and the capitalistic bosses. to wipe out our
organization.

We can never accomplish our objectives until the
masses of our people observe and participate. in shaping
correct political objectives and help to achieve these ob--
jectives. Building an infrastructure, or a structure for im-
plementing programs and distributing information, is
one of the best ways to begin organizing supportbases
in a community. 1
(4) Establish book stores. This is a priority. which must
be accomplished immediately. Ultimately, we should
strive to open book stores in various sections of cities,

but even if we have to open a book store in the corner
of our offices, we should do it. If we are to educate
workers, they must buy and read books. We can get I
books from publishers at a greater discount than‘ from
bookstores, if we get a discount at all. Then too, we can
earn some money to help support a" worker who might
need a job, by letting him be responsible for that. ~
(5) Establish printing concerns. This too is a priority,
for no revolutionary movement can succeed if it does
notihave its own printing operation. We must try and
devise all types of methods to get printing operations
going in our cities. This must be stressed over and over
again. A printing operationcontrolled by workers puts
the struggle on a new plane. I

Every worker should try to learn the art of printing,
composing, and editing a newspaper. Those with these
skills must teach others. ,

(6) Establish consumer cooperatives, housing projects,
gasoline stations, etc. At a later date we will prepare a
more detailed plan for cooperative econoiriic prpgrarris,
but as a rule we should try to establish service‘..Tou.tlets4’for-
workers. Workers must live; all people must live and we
all spend money for food, clothing, and shelter. We
‘should try to utilize all the various mechanisms in a city,
state, and country to build these service units for work-
ers all under a cooperative program. This has been start-
ed in some cities, but experiences must be codiﬁed and
expanded. It is not just enough to politically educate.
We must seek to provide as many services for workers as
possible. In all communities we will ﬁnd third world
people who are willing to help us implement programs
for cooperative economic development.

(7) Establish clinics, schools, and institutions to help
raise the reading, writing, and speaking ability, of all
workers. The International Black Workers Congress is
interested in preparing strong working-class leadership .
that will grow stronger each year, and until we raise the
reading, writing, and speaking ability of, workers, we
cannot accomplish this objective with efficiency. A A V ,

Urge all workers to obtain and constantly use a .
dictionary as they read.

Utilize the services of third world teachers to start
remedial and advanced reading schools for workers.

Teach the skill of writing the English language and
encourage workers to write for plant and community
publications. , _ \ ~

Prepare forms and urge workers to answer these ques-
tions about any important event in their community or -
place of work: What happened, who was involved, .
where did it happen, when did it happen, how did it
occur, and the evaluation and significance of the action.

Always encourage workers to speak in public and -
at meetings, following the rules for basic public speaking.

a. State clearly basic points you wish to make.

b. Give supporting statements, illustrations, and

comparisons. .

c. Conclude, urging listeners to support your

basic epoignts and proposals, while urging

them to act against other incorrect proposals.
(8) Engage in mass fund raising. Workers must ﬁnanci-
ally support their struggle. Without money we cannot
accomplish many of our objectives. Money is the nerve
of warfare. We must constantly stress that workers must
pay for the cost of the war we are waging. No revolution-
ary can work without money and no people will liberate
themselves if they are not willing to pay to help with
their liberation struggle. '

The following suggested ideas must be improved
upon and each worker in our organization must under-
stand the political importance of raising money and can-
not evade his responsibility to the organization. We can-
not tolerate the liberal attitude that raising money is the
function of someone else. True, we must have a division
of labor and we plan to establish cadres who will special-
ize in raising money, but from the very beginning, every
worker must clearly understand that he has a responsibil-
ity which we will not allow him to forget or to evade —

a responsibility to help provide funds, food, housing,

and other forms of material support to the workers’ revo-
lution. At the point of repetition, we stress again that
without money we will not be able to accomplish our
objectives and no forms of evading the responsibility to

u help raise money will be tolerated.

 

Suggested Ideas

a. A voluntary tax upon each worker in a plant or a
work situation. Exact honesty on the part of all cadres
and members is absolutely essential and he or she who
would steal one penny from the organizationis violating
trust and must be eliminated from our ranks and pun-
ished for his crime against the people.

b. A voluntary tax upon each household in the com-
munity. People will support our efforts if they under-
stand our objectives and see us working to implement
those objectives. We are truly the servants of the people.
We are a part of the people and we must never remove
ourselves from the people, for the masses will not sup-
port us ﬁnancially if they see us violating trust and con-
ﬁdence. Certainly they will never support us ﬁnancially
nor should we expect them to if we become a gang of
opportunists who abuse the people, terrorize them, ,
speak harshly to them, ignore their problems and strive
to be elitist in our behavior and attitude.

c. Fund raising parties, dances,‘paid cultural events, etc.

(1. Solicitations with cans on the streets or places where
people gather. Not only should we try to raise money at
these points but we must striveat all times to give people
a copy of our objectives. Raising money is a political act.
The revolutionary forces will grow stronger to the extent
that they are educating about our objectives, discussing
them and joining the ranks of workers who are working
for the total society. » A s I

e. Sell posters, bumper stickers,buttons,_artifacts, etc.
Mass fund raising is possible and the best ‘method-by '
which revolutionary forces can gather resources to help ' ‘
carry out programs. No worker can assume the attitude
that he is above selling any item that will help bring . . . 
revenue to the organization. Elitism in all its forms must , ,
be combatted at all times and any person who refuses . .
to sell items for the organization is expressing an elitist
attitude. - .

f. Establish and organize units of the United Black
Appeal and the International Black Appeal. Details on
this program are contained in a separate memorandum.

g. Collect food and gasoline stamps. Many people buy I
food and gasoline at places where stamps are issued and
do not bother with collecting or redeeming them.

h. Utilize the welfare system and food stamp programs.
While this is not a direct fund raising proposal, some
workers might feel too proud to take advantage of exist-
ing laws that will help to improve their economic situa- _
tion. This is a manifestation of liberalism. The money
that the government spends is our money and one day
we will control the ﬁnances of this country, but in striv-
ing to accomplish our objectives we must utilize all avail-
able methods that will provide us with food, clothing
and shelter.

i. Cooperative buying of food at wholesale houses. This
is another indirect method of fund raising. It is absurd
for workers to raise money to spend at neighborhood.
food stores whose prices are often sky high. By organiz-
ing collective food buying programs and going tothe
city or farmers’ market, we often save money and get
better food products. Collectivhin must extent to buy-
ing and cooking foods.“ _ M}:;  ,

The above are suggestions’ or raising money; the
following is our fund raising policy which must be ad-
hered to at all times. 

FUND RAISING POLICY

Our policy is to accept funds from anyone who

wishes to support our objectives and programs and who
understands that policy is madeiby our organization, not

by those who give money. We cannotpafford to allow any-
one to dictate our policies. At the same time we "cannot

turn down help from anyone, regardless of their skin color.
It is the duty of whites in this country to support lil_rerati_on
efforts of blacks, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans,- Asians and
Indians. ’

We must ﬁght against those reactionary forces in our

communities who say that we should not accept money

from whites. When you check it out concretely, many of

the most anti-white forces in the black community are.
accepting foundation grants and white church grants for
reformist programs, yet these vultures criticize third world
people who accept money from whites for political purposes.
Not only are they dishonest, ‘but they are retarding the revo-
lutionary process with their criticism of blacks who are study-
ing the science of making a revolution, and one of the prin-
ciples of making a revolution -to have the ﬁnancial resources.
to wage warfare. We stress that our policies are made by our
organization but we welcome help from all progressive forces
in the United States and around the world. Self-reliancedoes
not negate ﬁnancial and material support from anyone who
wants to help us accomplish ourobjectives and programs.

(9) Build the regional and national conferences. TheVInter-
national Black Workers Congress isplanning a two-day inter-
national education and planning conference on August 21- 1
22, 1971 in Detroit, Michigan.» These‘ dates have been select-
ed because of their historic importance. On August 21, 183-1'

METHODS OF CARRYING OUT‘ R-EVOLUTIONARIY WORK I
We believe leadership must be carefully selected,

rebellion against French planters. We plan to hold many
workshops, local and regional planning meetings to culmin-
ate in the national conference. We want to build a base for
our organization prior to any national meeting and utilize
the national conference to further build the base of the
organization. Details of this objective are contained in a
separate memorandum.

(10) Prepare for a Third World Labor Strike on August 8,
1972, to end the Indo—China War, the restoration of the
Palestinian people to their homeland, the withdrawal of
United States investments from South Africa.

To implement this objective we must begin to educate
workers about the Indo-China_war, the Palestinian armed
struggleand the role of United States investment in South
Africa. Constant propaganda around these issues must be
accentuated. Further details for building the strike are con-
tained in a separate memorandum.

(11) Qrganize personal and community self-defense units.
Training in the martial arts should increase and other forms
of personal and community self-defense techniques.

(12) Beware of leeches, opportunists, and those who would
latch onto our movement for their purposes. Remember we
are trying to lay the foundations for a genuine revolutionary
party among third world people. Some people in the tradi-
tional white left in this country have historically tried to
jump on the bandwagon of black movements and just as
often have jumped off when these movements took positions
that offended the white leadership of these traditional organ-
izations. Usually these organizations have sent their black
members into black organizations and they have often
worked very hard, but when directives were given that they
should pull out, they pulled out for the most part. There

are those who will say we are anti-communist for this posi-
tion, but we know this is not true. We must build our own
revolutionary movement. We too can read all the revolution-
ary thinkers and apply their thoughts to our concrete realities.
Only when we read and apply for ourselves will we~make
progress in advancing the cause of world socialism, an ex-
plicit deﬁnition of the sum total of our objectives.

(l3) Beware of police infiltration. The recent trials of the
Black Panther Party and the revelation that Gene Roberts,

a bodyguard of Malcolm X —- a man who tried to breathe in
Malcolm’s mouth and revive him — is a police informer cer-
tainly indicates the extent of police inﬁltration in this coun-
try. At the same time we cannot stop motion and orgamzing
because of the increasing number of black people who are
turning into police spies. Certainly one of the reasons the
pigs revealed Gene Roberts as a police informer inside the
Panthers was to frighten other black people from getting to-
gether and working on programs collectively. If the Umted
States government can frighten black people away from
mass collective action, then it will have retarded the revo-
lutionary process. Only through the mass action of third
world people will we be able to generate ferment among
our people and this mass action does not always have to
take the form of demonstrations.

Statement of Principles That Govern Our Revolutionary
and Work

We are issuing this ‘statement as a part of our manifesto so_

that the people  have a further guide by which to judge
our behavior. We encourage all the people to critically exa-
mine our standards for work and study and to examine other
groupspand organizations by the standards which guide us.

Why do we study?

1. To equip ourselves with the knowledge‘ of the science
and art of making a revolution so that we may apply.
scientiﬁc principles and historically proven techniques
to the art of making a socialist revolution in the United
States. If you want to build a skyscraper, you study the
principles of architecture. If you want to be a good
farmer, you study agriculture. Hence, if you really want
to change conditions and to fulﬁll the objectives of the
International Black Workers Congress, then you must
study the science and art of making a revolution.

2. To build revolutionary strength, and i_i_11_2_1g__%

3. To hold ﬁrm to a consistent working Class attitude-

4. To fight petty-bourgeois or middle-class tendencies such
as individualism, selﬁshness, greed, ultra-democracy,
liberalism, petty bickering, elitism, anti-intellectualism,
know-it-all attitude, dislike for detail. work, egotism,
male chauvinism and reactionary nationalism.

5. Tobuild iron discipline and a firm commitment to a
life of struggle for world socialism and the ending of all
exploitation.

6. To weed out corrosive elements by observing how
people study and implement what they learn.

7. To build a spirit of international solidarity.

8. To train cadres who will further organize the party and
revolutionary organizations of the working class, the
only class capable of giving correct political direction
to revolutionary forces. '

Black Wor ers ..
Congress will maintain its right to recruit and to
accomplish its objectives, waging principled and
non-antagonistic. struggle with wll other members of

 
 

 
  

 

that will give direction and educate._' the masses.
Stated objectives are the basis for recruiting and
waging the ideological struggle. - *

2. We believe that all revolutionary organizations
must practice democratic centralism. This means: a
Centralized administration and collective authority. bé
Decentralized methods of implementation of wor
that promote initiative, democratic discussion and a
channel to initiate policy resolutions. c Subordination
of minority opinions to majority ecisionsflower
bodies to hi er bodies and the supremacy of the
central col ectiye. d) Constant criticism, and
self-criticism, study and practice as the best methods
to insure the vigor and vitality of the part or
revolutionary organization and the promotion of
owth of revolutionary theory and practice. We
elieve that any organization that does not promote
criticism and self-criticism will mislead the masses and
cause its own decay. « I

3. We believe that liberalism in all its political
manifestations must be combatted consistentl ,for in
lI1€.UI_llt§d States the influence of middle cl,
capitalistic ideology 1S rooted deep in all‘ people,
including workers. Liberalism is dangerous to a
revolutionary organization for it retards growth,
causes a diversion of energies, a turnin inward on
sisters and brothers and a ailure to un erstand that

imperialism is the ma'or enemy. (By nature.

imperialism is capitalistic an racist.) _

ass and . .

for an organization is juclged _by its leadership and
leadershi creates a dynamic of its own which must

constant y be evaluated b the organization. Therefore _
we believe that all revo utionar organizations must .

have leadership that is working c ass and revolutionary
in outlook. The past history, activities, and
commitment of leadership must be examined before it
is selected and the strength and weakness of each

person in a leadership position must be collectively A

discussed at all times.

5. We believe that an one wishing to make a
socialist revolution in the United States or who wishes
to be known as a genuine revolutionary must struggle
to master the science and art of making a revolution

, and learn how to apply those teachings to the concrete

realities of the United States. We do not believe that
formulas will work everywhere but that we must study
revolutionary theory to learn how to appl it. Theory
which we cannot apply is interestin rea ing but not
relevant to our concrete realities. A road knowledge
of revolutionary theor will increase our ability to
wage revolutionary war are in the United States.

6. We believe that we must build the United Front,
realizing that all united fronts are ‘the unity of
opposites which includes various classes in league with
each other on the basis of a definite common ro ram
of stru le.’ Le Duan,- VIETN M SE
REVOL ION: , UNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS‘

the Front, trying to et them to realize the correctness
of our objectives an how they are in the best interest
all the people of the world.

Individuals and organizations that wish to become a .

part of the International Black Workers Congress must
accept in principle our manifest. It is our ‘ob to
educate about our principle, objectives and met 0d of

‘work and to test people in their daily work to see if

they are furthering the goals which they have accepted
in principle.

We ur e all those who want to sup ort the
International Black Workers Congress to dup icate this
draft proposal, mirneograph copies, reprint it in
newspapers, distribute it in plants, in factories, in any
work situation, in communities. Hold discussion
groups and try to implement the objectives.

We are especially interested in this document receivin

wide publicity and ,criticism in the internationa
community. We welcome books, periodicals, working
drafts; documents, suggestions, and ideas by
pro essive and revolutionary forces anywhere in the
