(Down with Fascism! Long live the social revolu-
tion I)

The appearance of this sailor symbolized the cour-
ageous, determined character of the Congress.

The Congress adopted a practical program of
struggle against war and, to put that program into
effect, it set up a unity among hand and brain workers
of all lands. A permanent international committee-
was established with headquarters in Paris, The
chairman of the Committee is Henri Barbusse.
Through the international organization and the vari-
ous national committees, the work of -the Congress is
being carried forward in 30 different countries. Al-
ready many mass meetings have been held in various
countries to hear ﬁrst-hand reports of the Congress
from delegates. Here in the United States the ﬁrst
mass meeting was held at Webster Hall, New York

City, on September 11. Since then other meetings
_haVe been heldelsewhere, and the work is broadening

in scope.

The task is gigantic. We must build anti-war
committees all over the country; we must disseminate
the Manifesto of the Congress and the news of what
is being done about it; we must reach the workers
in all industries, especially steel, munitions, transport
and chemical workers. All this requires Vigorous
and substantial assistance. We need the time and

thought of many persons; we need active cooperation

of all groups that can be drawn into work for the
common cause and to share the world-wide unity
established in Amsterdam. ‘ ‘

The issue is a burning one. Already we are poised
over: the abyss. The horror is upon us. '

We must act, and act now!

A DECLARATION BY ROMAINI ROLLAND*

We extend fraternal welcome and express cordial
gratitude to the men and Women who, despite in-
numerable obstacles, have come here from all parts
of the ‘world in response to our appeal.

From the ﬁrst, let us avoid those questions which
may produce discord. Let us not voice grievances,

.let us only regret the errors of those who have tried

in advance to distort the powerful, direct, and healthy
purpose ‘of this mass rally of a world people, this
assemblage of representatives of all nations to lay
the foundations of a universal federation against war.

This great movement, surging up from the depths
of the masses of humanity, has been viewed with
consternation. Those in governmental circles who
have an interest in dividingto rule have tried,
through the press, to poison public opinion against

our congress, On the other hand, more than one of =

those bureaucrats who head the great" social parties
have been frightened by what has seemed to them

. a ‘blow at their administrative routine. They have

seen sinister machinations in our efforts to create a
“united front” against war. The very phrase “united
front”—glorious phrase !——has become a bogey, by
an aberration of the age which has frittered away
the Vital force of great revolutionary times in scrib-
bling and empty talk. ,
Let us pronounce that phrase boldly here. And
permit the man Who was stigmatized, during the
World War, with the title “Above the Battle” to pro-
claim, at the outset of this Congress, the slogan

* Read at the opening session of the Congress by Mme. Duchene in the
absence of M. Rolland. who was too ill to attend.

11

“Above all parties—united front.” Let it be under-
stood in its true sense of openness and fairness.

We have rallied to this slogan an army of men
and women from all countries, to declare peace, to
force peace on the world. This army is composed of
widely differing elements. Some of us follow party
doctrines and tactics, others are strictly non-partisan.
Let us not emphasize our differences. For our clearly
outlined present purpose of “War against war” we

a need be concerned, not about the affiliations of our

comrades, but about their integrity, their courage,

their absolute devotion to the great cause which

unites us. We will follow those—whoever they may
be—who prove most energetic in struggle, most ready
for heroic sacriﬁce in order to crush the common
enemy. We reject none but cowards, and those feeble
spirited preachers of false security who satisfy them-
selves with declamations never translated into action
or else contradicted by action, all those who, though
they do not admit it, merely_ seek pretexts for not

b acting. We have seen too many evasions of responsi-

bility, too many compromises, since the end of the
last War. In all countries, the people, exhausted by
the four years’ bloodletting, have permitted their
power to fall into the hands of dubious proxies. It
is urgently necessary for the people of the world to
seize back their own power and give a forceful re-

minder to those who, having quite forgotten their"

existence, speak in their name without taking the
trouble to consu1't them. ‘ .
Our congress is a reminder to the people of the
world. They are represented here by their most
experienced and active elements. These have felt
and affirmed their unity of aspirations, their desire
to cooperate against war and against those who make
an industry of war, against every kind of imperialism,
against the conspiracy to separate them and so use

12

4,. “.7... 4., _, .V __ ....,_.....__,_,_,...,..._,__.. _,

 

them to destroy each other in the battles of Capital
and the bloody games of politics. This reminder is
a call to arms. War against war! Let each count
in the struggle.

Each individual here, each party, brings weapons,
tactics. Let us compare them. Let us try to co-
ordinate all sincere endeavors. In the general cam-
paign there is place for many private campaigns, so
long as they converge in the same purpose. Refusal
to serve because of conscientious objection is a way

of undermining the enemy’s fortress while the prole- ’

tarian armies assail it in battle- formation. Mass
combat does not exclude the parallel utilization of
individual efforts. An army whose battle fronts ex-
tend over all the earth must, while co-ordinating its
general campaign, permit each front to have its own
freedom of action. The forms of action vary accord-
ing to those which the adversary brings against them,
on every front.

In Germany since the Hitlerite coup d’éta.t, and in

V the nations dominated by fascists, there is manifestly

greater -danger, hence more valuable service, in at-
tacking the obscure forces of nationalistic hysteria
rising from misery and despair and cynically ex-
ploited by the Reaction. We French have especially
to hold in check— until we can smash them —-our
money and business powers, our great barons of in-
dustry who are the secret or proved masters of
politics. We must oppose their underhanded im-
perialistic maneuverings to subjugate Europe with
mercenary armies and to exploit the colonial races.
The Anglo-Saxons of Europe have to liquidate» their
burdensome heritage of world empire. Maintained
for centuries by the tribute of a subject universe,
today their state sees its satellites detach themselves,
letting it bear alone a social burden to which it has
become unequal. The social crisis takes particularly

brutal forms, and will continue to do so, in the United
States. The chaos and antagonisms of Europe have
found there fatally favorable conditions for repro-
ducing themselves. The doub_le oppression, social and
intellectual, the exploitation of the masses and the
subjection of intellect to amoral atmosphere never

 

cleared by the free criticism of an Erasmus, a Vol- V

taire, must inevitably end in explosion. This will
awaken, too, the other great races of the Americas

. for dominance of which the Yankee imperialism com-

petes with the British. Asia is an immense powder
barrel re.ady to explode at every point. India with
its peculiar weapons, wages its silent, invincible war
of liberation. Gigantic China, lacerated by the for-
eign imperialists and their domestic accomplices,
rises heroically from inﬁnite suffering.

In all this chaos of conﬂict one great power, the
U. S. S. R.—which is more than a nation, twenty

nations, __a world——has established the proletarian .
state and is building it up, day by day. Its very

existence deﬁes the old world of exploi'tation. The

hope of all exploited races, the example for them 1.

to‘ follow, it must be preserved against the myriad
threats of . a _world-wide imperialism united to
destroy it. ‘

From the intricate complex of individual struggle "

we must pick out the general lines for a common and
co-ordinated_campaign. In these three or four days
of our session we must not be satisﬁed with estab-
lishingharmony of feelings and ideas, important and

difﬁcult as even that achievement may be. We must -

not adjourn until we have laid_ down the basis for
continuous international action against every possi-
bility of the war which is constantly, universally
threatened. The basis of such action must be a close
union of the two great groups of allied workers, those
who are called the intellectuals, and the manual

14:

 

workers. As an intellectual I consider it essential
here to denounce and excoriate the stupid, nefarious
vanity which at this very hour the chiefs of the great
ruling bourgeoisie know so well how to exploit. This
false pride in a ﬁctitious caste tends to pit “the

s aristocracy of the intellect” against the masses. As

if intellectuals could exist apart from the masses! As
if, without the support of the armies of the Workers,
of the toilers, who are the very fulcrum of all action,
the intellectuals ‘Were capable of any effectiveness in
those conﬂicts involving the fate of humanity! Let
us here affirm, “Action is the aim of thought.” All
thought which does not aim at action is abortion and
betrayal. If, then, We are the servants of thought
we mustbe the servants of action. Right here we
must seal the union of intellectuals Worthy of the
name with those who are the substance of action,
who are livingpaction, the working class. A

Our last word, and our first, must be action. Let
us organize for action in these general sessions and
in the concurrent sessions of professional and trades
groups, the meetings of doctors, teachers, and other
intellectuals and manual Workers. Every group will
have to’ study the form of action appropriate in its
domain. And in general session We must examine
the most effective method of demolishing War by
striking it, at decisive moments, in its very sources
of proﬁts and murder, in its armament factories, in
the means of transportation. The future war is in
the hands of the working class. It is up to the workers
to put an end to War. Our, role here is to remind the
working class of its responsibility and to assume our
share of it. The safety of the World is conditional
on this. '

M A N I F E S T O
’ of the .
V WORLD CONGRESS AGAINST WAR
at AMSTERDAM
August 27-29, 1932

The hand and brain workers united in this Con-
gress against War realize the importance of the task
which has been entrusted to them by millions of men
and women in all countries. In order to lay a solid
foundation for their future work, they wish to record
in a single document the efforts and intentions of
this Congress and to come to an agreement on the
essential points and conditions of the struggle against
war, and the duties and responsibilities incumbent
on each and on all.

The Congress, regardless of the ideological and
political differences which may separate itsvarious
component elements, desires to face facts and facts
only. It emphasizes that the dangers of war are no
less real and grave today than in the years imme-
diately preceding 1914. Though no one, not even
those ready to launch the war, can specify the exact
date of its outbreak, the fate of the human race is
nevertheless at the mercy of‘ somediplomatic con-
ﬂict, of some frontier incident, or of a political crime.

Existing Wars

The Congress faces the facts. It points out that
colonial Wars, wars for the purpose of establishing
protectorates and for economic robbery. are raging

16

 

 

inall parts of the world. It points out that entire
nations and vast countries such as India, Morocco
or Nicaragua, are at the present moment waging a
defensive war against the armed forces of imperialist
proﬁteers. ~

The Congress observes the invasion of China by
Japan, a fact which implies that the Great Powers
are the latter’s accomplices. This dastardly act of
brigandage on a vast scale will inevitably be followed
by a division of the spoils no less bloody than the
conquest itself.

In the present political situation, with its more
or less veiled alliances and treaties, and its various
conﬂicting yet interlocking capitalist interests, any

imperialist war‘ must certainly spread until the whole

world is involved.

War Propaganda

The Congress denouncesthe attitude of the big
newspapers and of public men who, through servility
or love of gain, either maintain silence about the wars
which are now in progress or else misrepresent or
distort the truth concerning them and concerning the
catastrophes towards which the present generations
are being visibly driven and in which, unless they
make a vigorous resistance, they will be engulfed.

Military Preparations

The‘ Congress notes and condemns the huge and
ever-growing armaments throughout the world,
which ﬂatly contradict the seemingly paciﬁst state-
ments and theatrical proclamations of the govern-
ments concerned. It denounces the terrible efficiency
of these armaments, as well as the sinister instru«
ments of scientiﬁc extermination, namely poison
gases and disease germs, certain to be used in the
next world War. a

17

 

Imperialist Rivalries

Itcondemns the capitalist policy which aggres-
sively shuts off one country from another for the
exclusive "beneﬁt of a greedy minority, and drives
every government to exploit to the utmost the terri-

tory, wealth and population of Weaker countries,'in

order to secure markets at any cost. The Congress

accordingly condemns the agreements recently con-

cluded at.OttaWa and elsewhere.

These protectionist measures, adopted under the
pressure of the economiccrisis, which results from
the existing economic system and can only end when
that system is ended, merely deepenthe crisis and
render inevitable the transformation of economic
rivalry into armed conﬂict. The sole course open to
the governments of capitalist countries, or rather to

the ﬁnanciers who ‘thoroughly dominate these coun- ‘

tries and these governments, is to resort to an act of
violence which Will forcibly dip the scales to the
exclusive if temporary advantage ofthe best armed
and most powerful group among them. Capitalism

is the cause of the economic crisis and the economic

crisis hastens war.
Capitalist Breakdown

Amid all the facts of the World crisis, the Congress
denounces one single fact which illustrates the de-
plorable plight of world capitalism, namely, the
destruction of enormous stocks of foodstuffs in cer-
tain regions of the World While in others -famine
reigns. In India and in China a large proportion
of the population die of hunger, and in the other
continents millions of human beings are suffering
and dzrirrg in misery.

18

 

 

.. —

The Attack on the Soviet Union

The Congress points out that all capitalist powers
treat the Soviet Union as a common enemy which

they are attempting to undermine and overthrow. ,

There have been direct wars of intervention, encircle-
ments and blockades, armed attacks supported by
Western imperialism, arming of White Guards in
Europe and Asia, attempts at destruction by sabotage
withinthce Soviet Union, unprecedented campaigns
of calumny and defamation, all carried on under
ﬂimsy cover of diplomatic relations established
merely for the sake of immediate ﬁnancial advantage.
And today is being openly prepared in the Far East
a deﬁnite armed crusade against the Soviet Union.
The Congress points to the steadfast peace policy
systematically pursued by the Soviet Uni_on, and
repudiates the legend of “red imperialism”, the only
object of which is to justify and mask the persistent
attacks against the Republic of workers and peasants.

The Economic‘ Crisis and the Workers

The Congress proclaims that the present and
fut-ure victims of the whole situation are the great
masses of the people. The crisis of over-production

and maldistribution resulting from the chaotic sys- -

tem of private proﬁt, the consequent increase of
unemployment which _has reduced hundreds of mi];-
lionsof human beings‘ throughout the world to the
point of starvation, the enormous growth of military
expenditure, the rise in the cost of living and in taxa-
tion, all combine to crush the working masses already
decimated by the late war and after’ 14 years still
suffering from its wounds and bereavements. After
having been ruined they are now to be driven to the
slaughter once more.

The Congress points out that the Japanese workers

The 1World ‘Congress Manifesto

American Delegates to the Congress

$"P.°°!\"!“

There’s something vital in this'Congress. Surely it means
a step forward with its friendly internationalism,'its warmth

V and eagerness for action. Shall we take fright and withdraw

at the ﬁrst signs of rebellion against authority? Or shall we
recognize in these young workers just the material needed

for the mass-resistance to War we've all “preached? True

paciﬁsts are rebels.
—-LOLA MAVERICK LLOYD.

The call for a united front against war was never more

vigorously sounded ‘than at the Amsterdam Congress." Most
of the delegates were young. Most were Workers. They

spoke with one voice in condemning imperialist war and in ‘

demanding the defense of the Soviet Union against imperial-
ist attack. The American Committee must carry the message
of the Amsterdam Congress to the workers and help to organ-

-ize them in a united front against imperialist war.

—Sco'r'r N EARING.

have, by their heroic example, already shown how
the ﬁght against imperialist war must be carried
on. They have stood up against their own bourg-
eoisie, held up war production and munition convoys,
and shown up this war in the eyes of the Japanese
soldiers for what it is—a robber war.

The Peace Treaties

The Congress points out that the maintenance of
the artiﬁcial frontiers imposed by the peace treaties
——those one-sided arrangements dictated by ven-
geance and by political interest, and sacriﬁcing the

. immediate future to a momentary gain to the victors

———has created a great division between the nations
which conjures up war upon all frontiers. The very
basis of these treaties, Article 237 of the Treaty of
Versailles, which ascribesthe sole responsibility of
the war to Germany, is a ﬂagrant untruth which has
been used by a trick of demagogic mysticism to con-
tribute to the growth of the Fascist reaction in
Germany.

Imperialist War Aims

The Congress points out that regardless of this
or that apparently paciﬁst maneuver every imperi-
alist power, whether it be the United States, or Eng-
land, or France, or Japan, or Italy, is working for
war. ~ .

It draws attention to the leading role played by
French imperialism which, in its preparations for
war, is attempting to bring about and to direct, with
the aid of its Polish, Roumanian and other vassals,
who are themselves the victims of their own imperial-
ism, a regrouping ofthe imperialist forces. (Dan-
ubian Federation, Lausanne Pact.)

20

 

Necessity of Concerted Resistance

Determined as it is to offer ‘every, resistance in its .

power to the current which is sweeping the whole

-of the present generation towards disaster, the Con-

gress sees salvation only in the concerted actionof
workers, peasants and all who are exploited and
oppressed. ‘

It declares that there is no other adequate means
of carrying on- the war against war.

Futile Faciﬁsm

It is aware that many distinguished minds are
desperately seeking to ﬁnd a means of saving society
by noble dreams. It is aware that there are men
who offer a personal resistance to war which may
draw down upon them the vengeance of capitalist
laws. But it considers that in the face of the terrible
challenge offered by present developments, it is im-
possible to stop short at abstract formulas, or to
conﬁne oneself to means of resistance foredoomed to
failure; notably the—unfortunately futile-sacriﬁce
constituted by the noble attitude adopted after a

declaration of war by conscientious objectors, and by‘

all others who ﬂing themselves individually against
a collective disaster.

It hopes that the men of character and courage.

who preach those heroic measures and who are pre-
pared to accept for themselves the very grave conse-
quences of such an attitude, will join with the others
in erecting, stone by stone, from the ground up, a
massive collective barrier against War. Every form
of opposition to this work merely helps the enemy.

“The Plebiscite”

The Congress considers-that the so-called Plebis-
cite, proposed by‘ some in the event of war, is ineffec-

21

tive. Such a referendum can have no inﬂuence once
the war has broken out. Public opinion will then be
forced to accept the situation as it is and will do so
the more readily since it will have been intoxicated
by newspaper propaganda. ‘

The League of Nations

Above all the Congress warns the public against
governmental institutions, and especially the League
of Nations, which functions at Geneva as the imme-
diate mouthpiece of the imperialist powers. The
words spoken at its great pompous ceremonies are
words of peace, but its acts are the acts of war. The
Congress calls upon the sincere men and women
assembled here in response to our rallying cry against
war, to expose this hypocrisy which, like all merely
verbal paciﬁsms, aims only at lulling the vigilance

of the masses, so that war may once more take them

by surprise. V
The Second International

The Congress warns the true enemies of war
against the political compromises with the prevailing
system practiced by certain leaders of working class
organizations. Such cooperation strengthens this
system. and betrays the cause of the struggle against
war. The attitude of the leaders of the Socialist
International in August, 1914,. one of the outstanding
facts of the last war, marksa notable setback in the
movement towards human emancipation. The hostile
attitude adopted by the leaders of the Second Inter-
national towards‘ the present Congress conﬁrms the
impression that they maintain the same political
position which they held in 1914, in ﬂagrant viola-

tion of the true principles of Socialism.

22

 

M-ass Action

The Congress addresses itself to the innumerable

masses of the proletriat which need only conscious
organization in order to come to power. ‘

On the strength of the mandate given to it by a

multitude of people coming from all quarters of the’

globe and united in their sincere and burning desire
for peace, though holding divergent political opinions;
on the strength of its profound conviction that the
struggle against war is only genuine to the extent to
which it is eﬂicacious and inﬂuences the facts, the
Congress calls upon the masses, the only invincible
power existing in the tragic disorder of our times, to
enter upon? this scene of disorder in closed and dis-
ciplined ranks and to raise their powerful voice.

It is along these lines that this Congress intends
that its International Committee for the struggle
against War shall work towards extending this front
of the working class across the world.

The Pledge

Each of us here takes what is in the nature of a
pledge, and we take it all together. a

We pledge that we will never allow the formidable
unity which has been established here among the
exploited and victimized masses to be broken up.

We pledge to ﬁght with all our forceand with all
the means at our command against imperialist cap-
italism, that purveyor to the slaughterhouse.

We pledge to dedicate ourselves with all our forces
and all our resources to our immediate and pressing
tasks, taking our stand

against armaments, against war preparations, and

for that reason against the imperialist powers
that rule us; '

23

 

against chauvinism, jingo national incitements and A

fascism, the police army of imperialism which

leads to imperialist war and provokes civil war‘

against the working class;
against war budgets, a vote for which is a dishonor
and a crime; ‘
against the loans and taxes that rob the masses to
build armaments;
against the campaign of propaganda and slander
aimed at the Soviet Union, the country of Social-
ist construction which we will not allow to be
touched;
against the dismemberment of China, of which
each imperialist power covets a portion;
against the exploitation, oppression, and massacre
of the colonial peoples; .
for the support of the national minorities and the
peoples ﬁghting for their national and social
independence ; ‘
for the effective support of the Japanese workers
' who have raised the standard of struggle against
their own imperialist government.

All the burdens of war, as well as all the burdens
of armed peace and of war preparations, are laid on
the shoulders of the working class, whose van-

guard .is formed by_ the armament and transport —

workers. The working class must therefore immedi-
ately organize and be on its guard. We pledge to
ﬁght with all our power against the gathering
disaster.

The Appeal

And we continue to appeal to all: to appeal to the
workers, peasants, and intellectuals of all countries,

to the exploited and oppressed to join us, and at public

meetings and demonstrations to enter into the pledges

V we have entered into here and to put them into eifect. i

A successful struggle against war requires not only a
movement inside the imperialist countries, but also a move-
ment of colonial and semi-colonial peoples, and the oppressed
nationalities, who form an overwhelming majority of the
world population. The Manifesto of the Amsterdam Con-
gress, by urging support to the struggle of the masses, for
independence and liberation, and by proposing joint action
against war, has widened the anti-war front into a genuine
world movement. It is this world-wide aspect of the Amster-
dam Congress Against War and of the movement to which it
gave rise, which gives it the necessary base for a successful

struggle against imperialist war.

——WILLIAM SIMONS, Delegate, National Secretary
of the Anti-Imperialist League of the U. S;

The government arsenal at Piccatiny is working day and
night, the airplane factories of Paterson are making ﬁghting
type planes. The Crucible steel plants are making shells and
other war materials. Chemical plants are making poison

gases, and other peace time industries are being converted A

into war industries. As a worker delegate and a friend of
the Soviet Union, I go to the World Congress to ﬁght any
proposals detrimental to the Soviet Union and upon my return
to America I will carry a renewed and more vigorous ﬁght
against war.

-——LLOYD WESTLAKE, New Jersey Delegate

That was a new sort of anti-war meeting that was held in
Amsterdam this summer . . . with its 2,000 delegates-workers,
peasants, colonials, intellectuals—from across theworld. Some
were afraid that the workers (the strategic group if the
pending war is to be headed off) would not go because the
Congress "was called by intellectuals. . . . But the workers did
go and they were vocal, not just with promises to “down tools”

As a member of the Socialist Party I feel that the leaders
of the Second International made a serious mistake by re-
fusing to participate in this Congress. . . . In spite of their
attitude 323 Socialist Party members were seated as delegates
and there was absolutely no indication of Communist domina-
tion. . . . In order to achieve maximum results we must pre-
sent a united front. We therefore appeal to all enemies of
war to unite with us in this movement to save humanity
from annihilation. -

Socialist, Delegate.

- We are determined not to support a war made by'these
people who enforce upon us, in addition to the usual exploita-
tion, special forms of oppression. In Philadelphia a Negro
preacher openly stated that he would not put on another
uniform in defense of any country againstiwar. But I'must
state that soldiers are not paciﬁsts. We know that to ﬁght
against war we must take deﬁnite military steps, both as
soldiers and as workers. *

While other dividends are passed, munition plants such as
the Dupont Powder Company, are paying huge dividends. . . .
No less than 50,000 tons of deadly nitrates have been shipped
to'Japan in two months. . . . In Lawrence, Massachusetts,-
orders are being placed for the making of khaki at the same
time that the wages of the workers there are being cut. In-
dustrial plants are being so devised that they may be rapidly
converted for the purposes of wartime production. . . . Instead
of waiting for war to be declared, we must declare the war

against war now.

My organization has carried on a struggle against war, as
one of the major planks in its platform. Ours is a left-wing
veterans’ organization. Our men understand that wars are
fought by the workers. We know that we have been fooled
into ﬁghting the World War and into believing that that war
would end all wars. . . . Since we represent the soldiers of
previous wars, we feel our responsibility towards strengthen-
ing this movement.

—-SAMUEL J. STEMBER, ex-Serviceman,
Delegate.

Students are opposed to war-, have a feeling against war,
and this opposition must be crystallized into a movement
which will draw these students in. We want to utilize. this
Congress for the beginning of a militant, united front student
movement against war. Regardless of what political organi-

tations these students belong to, we want them to unite with.

us in ﬁghting war.
—-—JOSEPH COHEN, Student Delegate

The vigorous spirit of the Amsterdam-Anti—War Congress
was trenmendouslyr impressive. It represented, no doubt, the
most effective international anti-war demonstration which
has been held thus far. . . . To those who came as paciﬁsts
and conscientious objectors, it was confusing. . . . They were
urged, however, to go along with the Conference on the plea
that there was a large area of justiﬁable cooperation within
the program of opposition to imperialist wars. . . . Con-
sidering that this was the ﬁrst conference of its kind, it was

’ a remarkably successful demonstration.

-—-RABBI ISRAEL GoLDs'rEiN.

Often we in America are as separated from one another
as are. the countries of Europe. . . . What is wanted is .  the
beginning of understanding that can keep on growing. There
is the eternal conspiracy always to separate, to prevent the
growth of understanding among the workers, to build up not
only national, but sectional hatreds. The meeting at Amster-
dam was a great beginning. It should be carried on.

, THE WORLD CONGRESS AGAINST WAR

During August 27-29, 1932, there met at Amster-
dam a Congress of great signiﬁcance for the struggle
against war.

This was no conference summoned" by diplomats
intent on deceiving their several peoples by mock
disarmament proposals while, behind the scenes,
they zealously carry ou't the orders of the inter’-
national ring of steel and munitions makers. On the

contrary, it was a Congress initiated by the eloquent"

appeal of intellectuals of international fame, Romain
Rolland and Henri Barbusse, t-o arouse the peoples
of the World against the bloody catastrophe threat-
ening them as a result of imperialist rivalry, and
speciﬁcally the danger of an attack on the Soviet
Union. They sent forth a call to action; it was taken

» up by like-minded men -and Women in various coun-

tries, such as Maxim Gorki, Bertrand Russell, Hein-
rich Mann, Albert Einstein, Michael Karolyi, Martin
Anderson Nexo, Madame Sun Yat Sen, Theodore
Dreiser, and Upton Sinclair. From these the appeal
was carried out to the broad masses of the people,
to “all men and women of good will.” _
This appeal Was deliberately ignored by the cap-
italist press; it Was censured and rep-udiated by the

leaders of the Second International, but it reached’

workers of head and hand throughout the world. And

they responded! Over 5,000 delegates were elected _

from all sorts of organizations; lack of funds pre-
vented many from attending, but 2,196 men and
women from 27 countries succeeded in reaching the
Congress, besides 1,800 visitors. The Congress was

a gathering of young, serious, enthusiastic ﬁghters.
Originally it was to have been held in Geneva, but

this was prevented because the League of Nations

found itself embarrassed at the proximity of a Con-
gress which planned real action against war. Paris,
London and Brussels also refused to harbor such an
assemblage; Amsterdam ﬁnally consented, but even
then the Dutch government refused to admit the
Russian delegation. As August 27 approached, the
delegates of all other countries began to stream
towards Holland. Some of them hiked, some bicycled,
some came by train, some—from the countries of
fascism and the white terror—were smuggled across
the borders. There were French railroad workers,
German factory workers, Belgian miners, Polish
students, Austrian ‘physicians, paciﬁsts and war
veterans of many lands. Of the delegates, 1,861 were
workers, half of them members of trade unions.
There were 1,041 without party allegiance, 830 Com-
munists, 291 Social Democrats, 24 Left Socialists,
and 10 of the Communist Opposition. Germany sent
the largest delegation, numbering 752; France was
next, with 585; colonial workers were present from
several countries. In the face of the chauvinistic
antagonisms and hatreds incited by their respective
governments, their unity of purpose was indeed an
inspiration.

When Henri Barbusse rose to address the delegates
he was visibly moved. In a voice penetrated with
emotion he greeted this formidable representation
of workers who, despite different political aﬂiliations,
had come together to oppose war. For it is the
workers primarily who can take effective action, since
they must bear the brunt of the slaughter when it
occurs. Barbusse pleaded for unity of all the elements
represented at the Congress, so that the Congress
might have effective results. He emphasized par-

4

 

 

ticularly the unity of workers of hand and of brain
in the common cause. “The toiling masses are not
only the source of power for social progress; they
are also the power for intellectual progress.”

The need for unity was also stressed by Romain
Rolland in the message which he sent to the opening
session of the Congress. “We reject no one,” he said,
“except the cowards, except the pusillanimous
sleepers who satisfy themselves with declamations
never translated into action or contradicted by ac-
tion; except, in a word, all those who seek, without

confessing it, to ﬁnd a pretext for not acting at all.” ‘

And at the end of his message he drove home the
point once more. This was to be a militant Congress:
“Action is the end of thought. All thought which
does not look towards action is an abortion and a
treachery . . . And we should seal here the union of
those intellectuals worthy of the name with those
who are the very substance of living actions: the
working people.”

The Russian delegation had been barred by the
Dutch government, but the banner of greeting sent
by its chairman, Maxim Gorki, was received. with
thunderous applause.

Some of the most impressive speeches were very
brief ones by workers. A Belgian striking miner
told dramatically how, the month before, when the
army was called out and ordered to ﬁre on the strik-
ing miners, the soldiers refused to -obey. One cor-
poral even broke his gun as a sign of protest. Equally
impressive was a German marine transport worker
who urged that the ﬁght be carried on, no't only in

. munitions industries, but in all key industries. He

pledged the active support of his union in preventing
the transport of munitions. Len Wincott described
the Invergordon strike in the British navy last year.
Joe Gardner, American Negro miner and ex-service_-

5

  

man, also spoke Mrs. Wright, mother of two of the
Negro boys condemned to death at Scottsboro, was re-

ceived with a memorable ovation when she arose to

greet the Congress ; a vigorous resolution was adopted
demanding the immediate release-ofivthe innocent
boys.

Among intellectuals, Karin » Michaelis, Danish
novelist, spoke against militarism in the schools and
urged that the ﬁght against chauvinism begin with
teachers and pupils. Sherwood Anderson, American
author, deplored’ the exploitation of authors in time

of .war——men of talent are boughtover to serve for

the propagation of hatred and lies. Anderson assured
the Congress that an increasing number of American
writers are aware of this and stand ‘ready to use
their ‘talents to expose war. Professor H. W; L. Dana
brieﬂy described the mass unemployment and hunger
in America and the consequent unrest which the

% ruling class attemptslto sidetrack through war. He

urged a concrete program including such steps as
protest strikes in munitions factories against the
manufactureof munitions, refusal to transport muni-

___tion or troops, and continual ‘struggle against the

capitalist system which is the chief cause of war.

 

Hugo Graef, delegate of the International League’

of Veterans, described the sufferingsof the victims

. of the last war and denounced the treatment they

at
i .

receive, particularly in fascist countries. He accused
the leaders ofthe Second International of complicity
in the war of 1914. The present leaders of the
Socialist International continued the same. policy in
their refusal to participate in this very Congress at

Amsterdam. Nevertheless there were 291 members.
. of.t,he.Socialist Party present to listen to Graefand
‘ applaud his words. Two were French "Socialist mem-

bers of the Chamber of Deputies, Hamon and Poupy;
another was Nicole, editor of “Travail”, a Swiss

There were many» memorable and dramatic mo-
ments during the sessions of the Congress. . One was
spontaneous cheering that broke’ out from the huge
assembly when Sen Katayama, veteran Japanese
-revolutionary leader, came forward. to make his
speech. He began by recalling a Congress held 28
years ago in Amsterdam, to which he was a delegate:
an International Socialist Congress. “The Congress
was held in the middle of the Russo-Japanese War.
At the opening session I sat in ‘the Praesidium with
all the old leaders of the Social Democracy, and in
,  the name of the Japanese workers I greeted Plek-
‘ hanov, ‘who represented the Russian workers. It was
a solemnly moving spectacle of international pro-
letarian solidarity. . . . Comrades, I stand here again _
,  _ today for the Japanese Workers, and demand inter-
,3  ‘ . national proletarian solidarity for the struggle
, 3. ‘ against War.” a
" A ' Sen Katayama Went on to review the conditions of

 

the Russian and the Japanese workers since 1904.
At present it is Japan who most openly threatens the
peace of the world, since she is already waging an
imperialist war in Manchuria.” But the resistance of
the workers in Japan is increasing; even soldiers in
the army, like those in Belgium, are actually refusing
to obey orders. “The Japanese workers and peasants
are ﬁghting a heroic struggle against Japanese
fascism and militarism. They carry on demonstra-
tions, strikes, sabotage of war activities; they often
engage in bloody encounters with armed forces, in
Japan as well as on the Manchurian front. For_these
ﬁghters I demand from this Congress international
help and solidarity. . . . I know how hard it is for
those who are starving and unemployed to refuse
to load and transport -arms and munitions for Japan,
but don’t‘ forget that you, by handling such ship-
ments, are helping to murder your fellow workers
and to attack the Soviet ‘Union, which is the guar-
antee of your hope for socialism.” V
Throughout Sen Katayama’s speech there was fre-
quent cheering. So, too, with Patel, picturesque,
white-bearded Indian nationalist, who denounced
British imperialism for its brutal oppression of the
Indian masses; and with Guy~Jerram, who denounced
French imperialism for its policy of domination, in-

tensiﬁed since the treaty of Versailles. Marcel

Cachin, a leading French Communist, was Warmly
Welcomed. “The ﬁght against war,” he said, “is im-
possible Without a clear condemnation of the Geneva
brand of paciﬁsm. . . . We have had ten years of
conferences, ten years of speeches, of sessions, of
commissions, of propositions, and at the end of these
ten years the result is war in Manchuria and China,
war which threatens to engulf the whole world!” He
was vigorously applauded when he presented a pro-
gram of action: “Penetrate the armed forces; win

8

 

 

over workers and peasants in the factories and
ﬁelds!” .

The most stirring, breath-taking demonstration
occurred towards the end of the last session, in honor
of an unexpected speaker whose name we shall never

know. The chairman stepped forward, and in an.

electrically vibrant voice he cried out: “Comrades!
I have an extraordinarily important announcement
to make! The sailors of the Italian warship now in
the harbor of Amsterdam have heard of this "Con-
gress, and one of them has come to bring you greet-
ings from his comrades !-—-But ﬁrst ‘let me warn you:
take no pictures! This _b0y’s life is doomed if his
picture gets into the hands of the police. And now
I present him to you—a nameless sailor of the Italian
ﬂeet.” Instantly the Congress was on its feet as one
man, and the International rang out from thousands
of throats. '

And there mounted the rostrum a slender, youth-
ful ﬁgure, a sun-browned sailor in the dazzling white
uniform of the Italian navy. He gazed at the audience
calmly until the singing was over; then, just as
calmly, but with full consciousness of what he was
doing, he spoke for ten minutes in Italian. He de-
scribed the absolutism of the Fascist dictatorship
which, he said, makes revolution the only possible
means of change; he declared that Italy under
Fascism is making ready to wage war at the ﬁrst
favorable moment. All Italians realize that they are
being driven into an imperialist war, with every
avenue of protest closed_ to them. Nevertheless,
there are small groups in the army and navy who are
aware of the true course of events, and they are pre-

paring for the only possible resistance when the _

crucial moment comes. The speaker concluded:

“Abbasso il Fascismo! Viva la rivoluzione soziale!”
