the Communist Party was formally organized, we ﬁnd that
the birth of our Party as an independent political organ-
ization was made possible by the infusion of Leninism into
the experience of the progressive labor movement of
America. These experiences plus Leninism gave us the basis
for the Communist Party. The Communist International,
and its model party——the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union——headed by Comrade Stalin, gave us the guidance
that helped the American Communists to ﬁnd the way to
the masses and to the position of vanguard.

Through the eighteen years of its existence, our Party
has passed through several periods, the same as the world
in which we live and struggle. These periods have to be
studied and lessons drawn for our work today. But through
all these periods and changes, our Party has always been
a loyal and devoted section of our class—the working class;
its self-sacriﬁcing advanced detachment in the struggle for
a better life. Mistakes we have made; but we\have never
been ashamed to admit them and correct them openly and
with the help of our class. That is why, in part, our Party
was able to function as the advance guard, to ﬁght most
consistently for the task of the day and to point the road
forward to the struggle of tomorrow. That is why so many
of our slogans of agitation of ‘yesterday have now .become
the slogans of action of great mass movements of the work-
ing class and its allies. That is how our Party has reached
its present advanced position in the labor movement and
in the developing People’s Front.

This we should make the masses conscious of by spread-
ing widely the writings of our leaders, Browder and Foster,
where the history of our Party comes to life and helps
build the future.

From such a study of our history, the masses will also
learn how our struggle against Right opportunism (Love-
stonism, which is becoming less and less distinguishable
from Trotskyism) and against Trotskyism, now degenerated
into fascist banditism, has helped us to become stronger,
more able to resist bourgeois inﬂuences, more effective
ﬁghters as the vanguard of our class. And especially our
Party membership will learn how persistence in deviations
from Leninism, froml the Bolshevik line of the Party, in-
variably leads to degeneration and to the camp of the
enemy.

Let us prepare properly for the fulﬁlment of these tasks
on the eighteenth anniversary of our Party. And let us
make this an occasion for heightening the work of Party
building: recruiting, Daily Worker circulation, improve-
ment of all phases of our work, and deeper training in the
theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.

Let the eighteenth anniversary become a milestone in
the realization of our great tasks as formulated in the de-
cisions of the June meeting of the Central Committee.

‘ It does not require much investigation for us to see that
never in the history of the Party was the situation; so favor-

« able as it is today for the Communist Party" to function

successfully as the vanguard of the working class. And for
the following reasons: the working class is in motion. It is
organizing economically and politically. It has come into
life as a class, becoming a leading politicalfactor in the
country and reaching out for correct relations with its
allies amongthe farmers, city middle classes and Negroes.
And where does our Party ﬁnd itself in relation to these
big progressive movements of the working class and of
the people? Not outside but inside, in the very thick of

9

 

‘them; not as observers but as active participants; not in
«conﬂict with these movements but as close collaborators.
Clearly, this is a most favorable position from which to

build the Party as the true vanguard of the working class. i

Never as yet has our Party found itself in such a favor-
.able position.

This, of course, did not come about automatically.
Given the objective conditions which characterize the
present situation, nationally and internationally, it was
our correct line and the struggle for it among the masses
that placed our Party in this position. It was our correct
struggle for the unity of the working class and for the
People’s Front that brought the Party to this advanced
position.

Is it true, then, or is it not true, that the present position
of our Party in the mass movements of the working class
and its allies is most favorable for the fulﬁlment of our
historic role as the vanguard, for the building up of our
Party as the true advanced detachment of the American
working class? It is absolutely true. The whole previous
history of our Party has prepared us for that. I refer espe-

cially to the following: our constant devotion and loyalty,

to the class interests of the workers and their allies; our
self-sacriﬁcing struggles in defense of these interests; loyalty
to our revolutionary principles; to the teachings of Marx,
Engels, Lenin and Stalin under all and every circumstance;
our pioneering work in all ﬁelds of working class organ-
ization and struggle; similar historic pioneering activities
among the Negroes, farmers, women and youth; our strug-
gle against opportunism and sectarianism in our own midst;
our readiness to admit errors and to correct them publicly
and with the help of our class; our devotion and loyalty

IO

 

to our Party and to the Communist International—to its
principles, discipline and leadership—all these vital achieve-
ments and experiences in the history of our Party which.
we placed at the service of the line of the Seventh lvorld
Congress, for the struggle for the united and People’s
Front, have helped to bring about the present forward
march of labor as well as to place our Party in thepresent.
favorable position in the mass movements.

Favorable in what sense? In the sense of being able to
render greater service to our class and to our people in the
struggle against their exploiters; in the sense of being a
more effective force in the struggle for the unity of the
working class and for the People’s Front against reaction,
fascism and war; in the sense of being able to help the‘
whole class and its allies to proceed from lower to higher
stages of struggle and to the socialist revolution; in the
sense, in short, of building up our Party as the true revo-
lutionary vanguard of the working class.

How does the Party build itself as the vanguard of the
working class? Comrade Stalin’s Foundations of Leninism""
gives us the answer to the question. He says: “The Party
must absorb all the best elements of the working class, their
experience, their revolutionary spirit and their unbounded,
devotion to the cause of the proletariat.” (p. 38.)

That means, ﬁrst, recruiting. \/Vithout day by day recruit?

ing by which we seek to absorb into our midst “all the best
elements of the working class,” our Party cannot become
the vanguard. He who talks about the Party being the
vanguard but does not exert himself to stimulate and help

*Foundations of Leninism, by Joseph Stalin. New York, Interna--

tional Publishers. 10 cents.

ll

 

recruiting is merely a phrasemongerer and a c.hat.terer.

That means, second, to cultivate and enrich the experi-
ence, the revolutionary spirit and proletarian devotion of
the new members. The Party builds itself as the vanguard
of the class only by absorbing continually the experience,
the revolutionary spirit and proletarian devotion of the
new members which it recruits. We continually seek new
members because we want more of this experience, spirit
and devotion. New ‘members have-a good deal to contribute
to the building of the Party as the vanguard, that is, when
we recruit the best elements of the working class. There—
fore, we must create for the new members the most favor-
able conditions to transmit to the Party their experience,
their revolutionary spirit, and to demonstrate their pro-
letarian devotion. And on this basis we undertake to trans-
mit to them our experience, our principles, our theory.

In other word.s, recruiting (without which there is no
building of the Party as the vanguard) is not a mere formal
act of bring in a new member but is a process of absorbing
his experiences and revolutionary spirit, thus enriching the
Party’s own experience and revolutionary spirit, and, at the
same time, of enabling the new member to absorb the
Party’s experience, its traditions, its theory, principles and
organizational practices.

This is the most fundamental way of building the Party
as the vanguard of the working class, that is, by absorbing
continually all its best elements, their experience, revolu-
tionary spirit and proletarian devotion. ‘

Are the circumstances today more favorable or less for
such work? More favorable, of course. Why? Because the
best elements of the working class are coming forward now

by the thousands in all the big mass movements (which

12

 

was not the case when the working class was not as actively
in motion as today), youcan literally point these people
out with your ﬁnger; because, being in the midst of these-
mass movements and in the front lines, we are /daily rub-
bing shoulders with these people, associating with them,
working with them in all ﬁelds, gaining their conﬁdence;
and because, ﬁnally, ‘the. prestige of Communism and off
the Communist Party is growing day by day.

Hence the conditions are most favorablefor recruiting
the best elements of the working class and thus building the
Party as the vanguard. p _

How do we fulﬁl the role of vanguard? Comrade Stalin
formulates two fundamental Leninist principles governing
this question. I shall quote them.

“1. The Party must be armed with a revolutionary theory,
with a knowledge of the laws of the movement, with a knowledge ~
of the laws of revolution. Without‘ this it will be impotent to
guide the struggle of the proletariat and to lead the proletariat.
The Party cannot be a real Party if it limits itself to registering
what the masses of the working class think or experience, if it
drags along at the tail of the spontaneous movement, if it does
not know how to overcome the inertness and the political in-
difference of the spontaneous movement, or if it cannot rise above
the transient interests of the proletariat, if it cannot raise the
masses to the level of the class interests of the proletariat.” (I bid.)

Stated even more concisely:

“The Party must take its stand at the head of the working class,
it must see ahead of the working class, lead the proletariat and
not trail behind the spontaneous movement.” (Ibid.)

‘‘2. It must at the same time be a unit of the class, be part of
that class, intimately bound to it with every ﬁber of its being.
The distinction between the vanguard and the main body of the

13

 

working, class‘, between Party members and non-Party workers,
will continue as long as classes exist, as long as the proletariat
continues to replenish its ranks with newcomers from other classes,
as long as the working class as a whole lacks the opportunity of
raising itself to the level of the vanguard. But the Party would
cease to be a party if this distinction were widened into a rupture;
if it were to isolate itself and break away from the non-Party
masses. The Party cannot lead the class if it is not connected with
the non-Party masses, if there is no close union between the Party
and the non-Party masses, if these masses do not accept its leader-
ship, if the Party does not enjoy moral and political authority
among the masses." (Ibz'd.)

There is nothing to add to these principles. They have
stood the test of time and have proven invulnerable.

What has to be discussed at vital turns in the class strug-
gle is the concrete ways in which these principles can ﬁnd
their best and most effective expression. These concrete ways
are not always the same. They depend upon many factors,
among them the maturity of the class struggle, the relation
of class forces, the degree of “moral and political authority”
which the Party enjoys among the masses, etc. Taking this
into consideration, the Seventh World Congress deﬁned
these concrete ways of realizing the vanguard role of the
Party as follows:

“The Congress emphasizes with particular stress that only the
further all—round consolidation of the Communist Parties them-
selves, the development of their initiative, the carrying out of a
policy based upon Marxian-Leninist principles, ‘and the applica-
tion of correct ﬂexible tactics, which take into account the con-
crete situation and the alignment of class forces, can ensure the
mobilization of the widest masses of toilers for the united struggle
against fascism, against capitalism.” (p. 36.) ‘

Let me draw your attention to the essentials of this very
important statement on the concrete way-s of building the
vanguard in the present period.

(a) Party initiative; (b) policies based on Marxist-
Leninist, principles; (c) correct ﬂexible tactics, taking into
account the concrete situation and alignment of class forces;
((1) the aim being the mobilization of the widest masses
of toilers for the united struggle against fascism, against
capitalism.

This is our guide. First comes Party initiative. This is
fundamental. Without it, there can be no building of the
revolutionary vanguard, there can be no mass mobilization
of the widest scope for the ﬁght against fascism and capi-
talism. This means that we continually have to discover the
best policies for the mobilization of the masses for this
struggle and to bring these policies to the mass movements
and to win them for these policies. This is the duty of every
Party organization and of the Party as a whole.

Second, we must initiate correct policies. Initiative is
good provided i-t produces good policy and good policy
is one that mobilizes the widest masses of toilers for united
struggle against reaction, fascism and capitalism-. To be
so, policy has tobe based on Marxist-Leninist principles.

Third, good policy brought to the masses by Party initia-
tive is good for the masses and good for the vanguard.
Yet this alone is not enough. Just as good initiative can
be ruined by bad policy, so good policy can be ruined by
bad tactics. To prevent this, we need correct ﬂexible tac-
tics. This, however, is not and cannot be given once and
for all because correct ﬂexible tactics must take into ac-
count “the concrete situation and alignment of class
forces.” These, as we know, vary and change and hence

15

 

tactics must vary and change. It is therefore incumbent
upon every Communist and Party organization to be con-

stantly alive to the problem of “correct ﬂexible tactics” '~

because this is just as decisive as timely initiative and good
policy. In fact, when these two are given, correctflexible
tactics will decide everything. And remember, to be correct
and ﬂexible, tactics must take account of the concrete situ-
ation and of the alignment of class forces.

Compare, for example, some of our policies and tactics
prior to the Seventh World Congress and subsequently.
During the years prior t.o the Seventh Congress, we ful-
ﬁlled our role as vanguard by propagating the ﬁnal aims
of our Party, by pointing out the next steps in the daily
mass struggle for partial demands and by independently
organizing masses of toilers to ﬁght for these demands;
independently, that is, from those mass organizations of
the workers and other toilers in which the reformists were
successful in preventing the workers from struggling and in
expelling the militant forces from the organization. We
fought for the uni-ted front all through these years but
because the objective conditions were not as favorable, be-
cause of our sectarian habits and practices, and because of
the splitting tactics of the reformist leaders, we were mak-
ing relatively little headway in bringing about the united
front. But we couldn't, because of that, give up the ﬁght
and capitulate to capitalism as the reformists did. This we
never will do. We will always defend the interests of -the
masses against their exploiters, regardless of the forms and
methods which conditions may dictate. We were forced
to lead minority movements and minority struggles.

Thus, in the former period, we resorted as a rule to the
tactic of organizing mass struggles independently, of lead-

16

I

ing them -largely ourselves and of raising the movements
from lower to higher levels at a comparatively fast tempo.

On the whole, barring the sectarian and Right o-ppor-
tunist errors which distorted this line and militated against
its greater success, this was a correct tactic. It laid the
groundwork in part for the present advance of the mass
movements. It helped prepare many of its cadres. It popu-
larized many of our slogans which in the past were either
slogans of agitation or demands of minority movements
and struggles but which are today slogans of action of
large mass movements (unemployment relief, organize the
unorganized into industrial unions, trade union unity,
Negro rights, farmer demands, youth demands, indepen-
dent working class political action, alliance with farmers
and middle classes, etc.). It served as! a check upon «the
capitalist offensive in many crucial instances and also as a
check upon the extent and scope to which reactionary re-
formists were able to betray the masses. It actually suc-
ceeded directly and indirectly in securing important con‘-
cessions for the masses from the. exploiters. It—-this.tactic of
independent leadership—strengthened our Party and pre-
pared us for the vanguard role in the present period.

Those who would negate in our past not only the sec-
tarian and Right opportunist errors but also our struggles
against these errors, and with that would cancel our achieve-
ments in helping to bring about the birth of the American
working class as a c1ass—the propaganda of revolutionary
Socialism and the leadership of minority movements and
struggles—those who would knowingly want to do that are
in danger of ceasing to be good Communists nor would
they be dependable ﬁghters for the vanguard role of our
Party in the present situation.

What-is the situation today? The working class is mov-
ing. The masses are moving. The unity of the working

class and the People’s Front is being cemented in the heat 2

of major economic and political struggles. The objective
conditions and our past struggles are moving the masses
forward. And we are in the very midst of it all. Where thou-
sands would rally around our slogans in the past, hundreds
of thousands are doing it today. From this certain impor-
tant tactical changes had to follow. We are now in a posi-
tion to place before ourselves tasks of major magnitude in
the struggle for the united front and for the People’s Front.
Instead of being forced to lead independently minority
movements and struggles, we are getting into a position
of collaborating with big progressive majority movements
of the working class and i-ts allies, of actively participating

in these movements and establishing ourselves as a van- '

guard of the class. For the ﬁrst time in the history of the
United States, the revolutionary vanguard of the prole-
tariat——the Communists—is able to begin to function
within the class and its mass movements in the way in
which The Communist Manifesto envisaged it. Namely:

“They have no interests apart from those of the working class
as a whole. . . . The Communists are practically the most ad-
vanced and resolute section of the working class parties of every
country, that section which pushes forward all others; and
theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat
the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the
conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian
movement.” (P. 22.)

This is the way in which we have begun to function and

I

to build ourselves as the vanguard of our class. The present
way differs in many essential respects from the old‘ way. And
necessarily so. As a rule we seek to fulﬁl our function as
vanguard within and in the front lines of the mass move-
ments of our class and its_al1ies, in line with the policy of
the united and People’s Front, instead of being forced (as
in the past) ourselves to lead minority movements and
struggles. This is clearly more advantageous to the class as
well as to ourselves as its vanguard. It is more advantageous
forthe needs of theuday as well as for the ultimate socialist
liberation. -

At ﬁrst glance it might appear as though the tempo of
transition from lower to higher stages of class struggle must
necessarily be slowed down because of the new relation-
ship between the revolutionary vanguard and the mass
movements. This is not absolutely so. The tempo of transi-
tion need not necessarily be slowed down if the relation-

ship of class forces continues, nationally and international-

ly, in a direction favorable to our camp. But even if, at
one point or another, this tempo of transition from lower
to higher stages of struggle should have to slow down as
compared with past years, this would be only relative; be-
cause in compensation for that we would have the decisive
fact that the transition when made would be made not only
by ourselves‘ and minority movements led by us but by
great mass movements, by the class. In other words, not
only minorities would be marching forward but the de-
cisive sections of our class and its allies. In the past we
could dream of that, propagate the idea and unfold the
perspective; today it has become a practical task and a prac-
tical possibility. 7

Does it follow from that that in the present situation,

19

 

with the new relationship between, the vanguard and the
mass movements of the class, a relationship stressed so well
by Comrade Dimitroﬂ’ in his May Day statement, the Com-
munists should permit themselves to become dissolved in
the mass movements, should cease to function within them
as Communists and Marxists, should; cease building the
Communist Party? Does it follow that the Communist
Party and its organizations have no independent activities
to carry on aside from the activities of Communists as par-
ticipants of the mass movements? Of course not. Such con-
clusions have nothing in common with Communism. Recall
once more the two principles of Stalin governing the role
of the vanguard. With the class and at the head of it. The
June meeting of the Central Committee has concretized
these principles fully in application to the present situation.
It warned against the danger of dissolution and indicated

the ways of guarding against it. The/Plenum resolution

puts it to us:

“Working on the basis of this democratic People’s Front plat-
form, the Communist Party should in no way lose its identity
or slacken in the task of strengthening its role as the most ad-
vanced and revolutionary section of the People’s Front movement.
This means that, in the midst of these mass movements, the
Communist Party membership and organizations must:

“ (a) Build the Communist Party into a mass Party;

“ (b) Carry /on mass propaganda for its ﬁnal aims of working
class power and socialism;

“ (c) As the vanguard of the mass movement, point out the next
steps of the, struggle, initiating and supporting the progressive
demands of the movement.”

In broad outline, Comrade Dimitroff elucidates the same
task as follows:

20

"When we carry on a resolute struggle for the defense of demo-
cratic rights and liberties, against reaction and fascism, we do so
as Marxists, as'consistent proletarian revolutionaries, and not as
bourgeois democrats or reformists. Where we come forward in
defense of the national interests of our own people, in defense
of their independence and liberty, we do not become nationalists
or bourgeois patriots; we do so as proletarian revolutionaries and
true sons of our peop1e.VWhen we come forward in defense. of
religious freedom, against the fascist persecution of believers, we
do not retreat from our Marxian outlook, which is free of all
religious superstitions.”

Thus we have the correct answer to the task of building
our Party as the true vanguard of the working class in the
struggle for the united front and People’s Front, for the
struggle against reaction, fascism and capitalism.

Fifteen Years

of the Communist Party

of the Communist Party of the United States.

Nineteen hundred and nineteen was the year when
our Party was formed. It was a year of great mass strikes
and deep revolutionary fermentation among the widest
masses of the toiling population of the United States. The
American working class was beginning to wake up ‘to the
swindle of the ﬁrst world imperialist war, to the gigantic
crimes of the capitalists and to their social-fascist supporters
in the labor movement. The demobilization and peace re-
construction plans of the American bourgeoisie, which
aimed at a widespread lowering of the standard of living

S EPTEMBER, 1934, marks the ﬁfteenth anniversary

of the toiling masses, were met with militant strikes in.
almost all the basic industries of the country. It was also.

the year of the great Seattle General Strike.
Nineteen hundred and nineteen was the year when the
Communist International was formed, preceding the forma-

tion of our Party by about ﬁve months. Our Party became .

part of it. This followed logically _and inevitably from the
whole. situation in the United States. All thellessons of
the American class struggle dictated this step. But it was
only through the costly experiences of the ﬁrst world war,
and especially the victory of the proletarian revolution in

242

 

Russia under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, that the
proletarian vanguard of the United States came to realize
that the Bolshevik way is the only way for the liberation
of the American proletariat and all the exploited and op-
pressed. Thus it came to pass that our Party came into
existence in the period of the ﬁrst cycle of war and revo-
lution. '

On the “theory” that American Communism is a “for-
eign importation,” the ruling class of the United States
undertook to uproot’ the young Communist Party by the
method of police raids and deportations of so-called aliens.
We refer to the infamous days of W'il«son-Palmer in 1919-
1920. '

History has already pronounced conclusive judgment
upon this bourgeois and social-fascist “theory” of the for-
eign originof American Communism. The judgment is con-
tained in the present anniversary which marks 15 years
of American Communism. The fact that 15 years after the
ﬁrst anti-Communist mass persecutions the American bour-
geoisie is again initiating similar measures as part of the
intensiﬁed fascization of its rule is the best proof of the
American character of the Communist Party of the United
States.

From the date of the birth of the Communist Party of
the United States to its ﬁfteenth anniversary the world has
passed through the ﬁrst cycle of wars and revolutions, then
the period of the relative stabilization of capitalism, and
now ﬁnds itself confronted with a new cycle of wars and
revolutions. For our Party it meant ﬁrst a long and difﬁcult
period of formation and uniﬁcation, then the establishment
of contacts with the masses and their daily struggles along
with the mastery of the program and tactics and organiza-

23

 

tional principles of Bolshevism, and ﬁnally the indepen-

dent leadership of mass struggles of the workers, toiling

farmers, Negroes, etc.

At the present time, which is characterized by dee_p-
going shifts in the ranks of the working class and a
sharp turn to higher forms of mass action (sympathy
strikes, general strikes), the revolutionary activity of
the Communist Party is growing, the inﬂuence of its
slogans is increasing, its contacts with the masses are
multiplying and becoming more ﬁrm, and its ranks are
becoming more numerous. The factional struggle, which
plagued the Party for many years, has become a thing of
the past. With the expulsion of the Lovestone group from
the Party and the liquidation of the Trotsky group, carried
through in the latter part of 1929 under the leadership of
the Executive Committee of the Communist International
and of Comrade Stalin, the Communist Party of the United
States became consolidated and was thus enabled to take
up in earnest the task of mass revolutionary work dictated
by the present period. S

From the end of 1929, the struggle of the Com-
munist Party of the United States for establishing ﬁrm
contacts with the workers in the decisive factories of
the basic industries, the unfolding of the program of
concentration, began to take place, though unevenly, with
ever-increasing effectiveness. The Open Letter of the Ex-

traordinary Party Conference (July, 1933), marks a mile-<

stone on the road of this development.

It is no accident that the ﬁfteenth anniversary of our
Party will be celebrated in a heightened revolutionary at-
mosphere generated by the great General Strike in San Fran-
cisco which was of the nature of a historic vanguard battle

24 .

 

in the developing revolutionary countenoffensive of the
American proletariat. There are more San Franciscos to
come with higher revolutionary consciousness among the
masses and wider Communist leadership. Following out the
analysis of the Thirteenth Plenum of the Comintern Execu-
tive in application to the conditions in the United States,
the Eighth Convention of our Party had foreseen and fore-
told the maturing of decisive class battles. Furthermore, by

developing and concretizing the Open Letter, the Eighth

Convention equipped the Party organization and member-
ship with the practical directives for daily mass revolution-
ary work. It was the application of _these directives of the
Open Letter and of the Eighth Party Convention that en-
abled the Communist Party to give effective leadership to
the masses in the maritime strike of the West Coast and
in the General Strike of San Francisco. These battles will
mark a decisive advance in the struggle against capitalism
and in the growth of the Party, if we utilize the experi-
ences of these battles in a Bolshevik way.

The present pamphlet is made up of a number of articles
previously published in The Communist. They are offered
as an introduction to the study of Party history but not as
the history itself. As an outline of the main paths of the
Party’s development, its organic and inevitable rise, and
the inﬂuences of international -Bolshevism—Lenin and} Stalin
——in the shaping of a revolutionary proletarian ideology in
the United States, these articles seek to arouse in the reader
a desire for further study of the growth and development
-of American Communism. Such a study is of the highest
importance for our Party membership, and for all class-
«conscious workers. There is a world to learn from the ex-
periences of the past, and many an error can be avoided in

25

 

the present and ‘the future through a critical evaluation
of- the history of our Party. In the history of our Party

From Left Socialism

to Communism ='=

HE formative period in the history of our Party

I appears as a development from Left Socialism ‘to

Communism. The essence of this development con-

sisted in this, that the Left wing of the Socialist Party

(1918-1919) was gradually freeing itself from vacillation

between reformism and ultra-Left radicalism by means of

an ever closer approach to the positions of Marxism-
Leninism.

The Left wing of 1918, the organizer of our Party, was
very deﬁnitely opposed to the reformist leaders of the So-
cialist Party and of the American Federation of Labor and
was consciously organizing for a complete organizational
break with the opportunists in the Socialist movement.
Furthermore, the Left wing of 1918, unlike the previous

‘ Left currents in the American labor movement, took issue

with the reformists on all the basic problems of the class
struggle of the present epoch, chief of which was the prob-

Left wing of 1918 as the bridge for the classl conscious
workers of the United States from vague Left Socialism
and general proletarian militancy to the deﬁnite and solid
foundations of Leninism. ’

However, when it came to the concrete application of the
fundamental principles of Leninism to the class struggle
as it developed from day to day, the Left wing manifested
great vacillations between reformism and ultra-Left radi-
calism. Also there was a strong current of sectarianism run-
ning through its policies and tactics. These weaknesses [of
the Left wing were somewhat similar to the weaknesses of
the ﬁrst Marxian groups in the United States. Of these
latter, Engels wrote in 1886 that they “have not been able
to use their theory as a lever to set the American masses in
motion. To a great extent they do not. understand the
theory themselves and treat it in a doctrinaire and dogma-tic
fashion as if it were something which must be committed to
memory and which then suﬂices for all purposes without
further ado. For them it is a credo, not a guide for action.”
It must be added, however, that the Left wing of 1918,
having arisen in’ the epoch of the general crisis of world
capitalism and of the proletarian revolution, was bound
to outlive its weaknesses much sooner and to ﬁnd its way
to the American masses much more easily than had been
the case with the ﬁrst Marxian groups.

From the foregoing it will not be correct to assume that
the only element that went into the making of the Commu-
nist Party of the United States was the Left wing of the
Socialist Party. As a matter of fact, there were many more
Left and militant elements, such as came from the Socialist
Labor Party, the American Federation of Labor, the Indus-
trial Workers of the World, etc. Generally, therefore, our

28

 

Party springs from the Left and militant elements in the
labor movement as a whole. Moreover, in the period that
followed the organization of our Party in 1919, it was
through the Left wing in the trade unions, headed by
Foster, that the Communist movement began to derive its
main strength and inﬂuence. But in the formative period
(1918-1919), the basic Left group which organized our

Party was the Left wing of the Socialist Party, the outstand-

ing representative of which was Ruthenberg.

THE ISSUES OF STRUGGLE

The social-fascist historians of the American labor move-
ment (james Oneal 8c Co.) ‘maintain that the issue be-

tween the official leaders of the Socialist Party and the Left

wing of 1918 was Socialism versus Anarchism. Nothing is
further from the truth. As we shall see, the central issue
was the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, revolution-
ary Marxian Socialism, versus reformism. And only hopeless
philistines and outright ﬂunkeys of capitalist rule can con-

‘fuse the adherents of the dictatorship of the proletariat

with Anarchism. Onea1’s method of “proving” this point
is quite simple. He takes all the elements in the American
labor movement of the past who advocated militant meth-
ods of struggle and direct mass action and clubs them
Anarchists; then he discovers that the Left wing of 1918
also advocated militant class struggle and mass action;
hence, the Left wing derives from Anarchism.

It is not the purpose of this article to trace the develop-
ment of the Communist_ movement in the United,States
back to the labor movement of the pre-imperialist era. But

that much can be seen without much argument, that the '

struggle between Marxism and Anarchism (Bakunin 8c Co.)

29

 

in the United States during the period of the First Inter-
national was not a struggle between the opponents of
“force_” in the class struggle and its adherents, as Oneal
tries to make ‘it out. Marx and Engels were no paciﬁsts, and
their struggle against Anarchism was not because of its
“violence” but because it represented the ideology of the
petty bourgeoisie and not of the working class. The historic
mass struggles and street battles of the American proletariat
in 1877, which the present-day social-fascist bemoans as an
unfortunate episode that seemed t.o strengthen the “force
tendencies” in the labor movement, Marx greeted as the
“ﬁrst explosion against the associated oligarchy of capital
which has arisen since the Civil War.” And while he fore-
saw that the movement would be suppressed, Marx pointed
out that it “can very well form the point of origin of an
earnest workers’ party.” (Letter to Engels, July 25, 1877.)
The Communist movement of the United States is un-
doubtedly absorbing and assimilating all the militant and
revolutionary traditions of the American working class.
Following in the footsteps of Lenin, who restored the revo-
lutionary essence of Marxism, developing it further in the
era of imperialism, the American Communists unquestion-
ably seek to revive these traditions, raising them to the
present higher stage of preparation for the struggle for
power. But it is just as unquestionable that the social-
fascists of today are the direct descendants of those petty-

‘bourgeois elements who, throughout the history of the

American labor movement in the imperialist era, had tried
to keep the working class chained to the chariot of the
capitalist class, hampering and retarding its growth into
an independent political force.

From its very inception the Left wing of 1918 was con-

30

 

scious of the fact that its differences with the ofﬁcial leader-
ship (Right wing and Centrist) were of a fundamental
character. “Many see in this internal dissension merely an
unimportant difference of opinion or, at most, dissatisfac-
tion withvthe control of the party and the desire to replace
those who have misused it with better men. \/Ve, however,
maintain that there is a fundamental distinction in views
concerning party policies and tactics. And we believe that
this difference is so vast that from our standpoint a radical
change in pa.rty policies and tactics is necessary.” (From

-the Manifesto and Program of the Left Wing Socialist

Party, Local Greater New York.)

In accord with this conception, the Left wing brought
to the forefront the basic question of the present epoch-
the question ofvthe attitude of the proletariat to the capital-
ist state and the struggle for the dictatorship of the prole-
tariat. The Left wing maintained that official Socialism
(“dominant moderate Socialism”) “accepted the bourgeois
state” and “strengthened that state”; the Socialist leaders
had “lost sight of Socia1ism’s original purpose, that goal
became ‘constructive reforms’ and cabinet portf01ios—the
cooperation of classes.” Moreover, the Socialist leaders were
ready to “share responsibility with the bourgeoisie in the
control of the capitalist state even to the extent of defend-
ing the bourgeoisie against the working class.” (Left Wing
Manifesto.) A

And what was the position of the Left wing on the ques-
tion of the capitalist state? Says the Manifesto:

“Marx declared that ‘the working class cannot simply lay hold
of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own pur-
poses.’ This machinerymust be destroyed. . . . The attitude
toward the state divides the Anarchist (anarcho-syndicalist), the

31

‘moderate Socialist’ and the revolutionary Socialist. Eager to abol-
ish the state (which is the ultimate purpose of revolutionary
Socialism), the Anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist fail to realize
that a state is necessary in the transition period from capitalism
to Socialism; the ‘moderate Socialist’ proposes» to use the bour-
geois state with its fraudulent democracy, its illusory theory of the
‘unity of all classes,’ its standing army, police, and bureaucracy
oppressing and baﬂling the masses; the revolutionary Socialist’
maintains that the bourgeois state must be completely destroyed
and proposes the organization of a new state—the state of the
organized producers—of the Federated Soviets—on the basis of
which alone can Socialism be introduced.” ‘

And this is the position which Hillquit, Oneal 8c Co. had
met with the charge of Anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism!
It is obvious that in formulating its views on the ques-
tion of the capitalist state, the Left wing was trying to fol-

low Lenin (the Bolsheviks), many of whose writings——asr

The State and Rez/0lut2'on—were already available at that
time in the United States. But it is just as obvious from the
Left Wing Manifesto as a whole, that many leading Lenin-
ist ideas escaped the Left wing altogether while others were
insuiﬁciently understood. Thus, the Manifesto throughout
speaks of “moderate” Socialism as the exponent of oppor-
tunism in the parties of the Second International without
a differentiated and close analysis of the various shades
and forms of opportunism. This was especially necessary
at that time, as Leninism repeatedly insisted, because the
most dangerous variety of opportunism was then the Cen-
trist group (Kautsky, Trotsky, Hillquit to a certain extent,
etc.). Failing to expose the nature of Centrism as hidden
opportunism and the most effective cover for the open
betrayals of the socia1—chauvinists, the Left'Wing Manifesto
disarmed itself to a considerable extent in the struggle

32

 

against the opportunist /leaders of the Socialist Party of
America, which, under the guidance of Hillquit, occupied
a position of Right Centrism rather than of open" social-

chauvinism; or, more precisely, it was maneuvering between

social-chauvinism and Centrism. It was partly for this reason
that the weakest part of the Manifesto is the one that deals
with the nature of “moderate” Socialism in the United
States. This very serious error was only partly rectiﬁed in
the agitation of the Left-wing press, with the result that
the Hillquit leadership was able, more or less easily, to

carry on “Left” maneuvers (willingness to join the Com- '

munist International on certain conditions) even after the
formation of the Communist Party. .

A Nor does the Manifesto analyze the economic and class
basis of opportunism, namely, the corruption of the labor
bureaucracy and aristocracy by imperialism. There is no
need for this article to explain the importance—theoretical
and practical—of this Leninist idea. The question arises,
how could this idea have escaped the Left Wing Manifesto,
especially in the United States of that period where the
corruption was so ripe and where the splitting up of the
working class was being carried out so consistently and
openly by the reformists, most particularly by the leaders
of the American Federation of Labor? That the Left wing
was familiar with this idea, and was developing it in its
discussions of trade union questions, can be "seen from the
Left press. Then how could it happen that, of all places,
this should be missing in the Manifesto? We may come
perhaps closer to the explanation of this fact when we note
another omission in the. Manifesto: it says nothing about

A the American Federation of Labor. Did the Left wing have

any ideas about it? It did. And its main idea was that

33

 

the A. F. of L. was an organization of the aristocracy and
bureaucracy of labor and hence so hopelessly reactionary
that it was considered totally out of the sphere of ’interest
and activity of revolutionary Socialists. Thus,_ while the
Manifesto proclaims deﬁnitely its position in favor of class
struggle industrial unionism, it says nothing about the
existing mass trade union movement under reformist lead-
ership. \A7hat does this show? It shows (1) that the Left
wing had not yet turned its face to the masses, their organ-
izations and their daily struggles; and (2) that the Left
wing’s understanding of the role of the A. F. of L. ibu-
reaucracy as the labor lieutenants of the capitalist class
was more that of the sectarian Socialist Labor Party
(S.L.P.) than that of the Bolshevik Leninists.

On the question of imperialist war, which was the second
big issue between the Lefts and the reformists, the Left
wing took a position which was substantially that of the
Bolsheviks. The war question played a very important part,
perhaps a decisive part, in precipitating the rise and con-
solidation of the Left wing. As late as April, 1917, the
time-’of the St. Louis Convention of the Socialist Party,
the Left elements still constituted an undifferentiated mass
of many tendencies and shades, running from a relatively

developed ideology of revolutionary Socialism to outright ‘

Centrism. The policy of the official party leadership (Hill-
quit 8c Co.), while social-chauvinist in substance, took the
form of a series of maneuvers, between outright social-
chauvinism and Centrism infused with a considerable dose
of paciﬁsm. The result was that the St. Louis Convention
produced no real division between social-chauvinism and
true revolutionary internationalism. This convention was
overwhelmingly Left, but in the above—described sense.

34

Only ﬁve delegates voted for the Spargo report (open pro~
war position); the rest of the votes (172) were distributed.
between two anti-war resolutions. But what was the nature
of these resolutions? While they differed somewhat in form
and in minor detail, they were nearly identical in sub--
stance, and the substance was a grainlof genuine revolu--
tionary opposition to the imperialist war dissolved in a
sea of paciﬁsm and reformism. The majority anti-war re-
port, which received 141 votes, was submitted to the con»
vention by Hillquit; the ﬁrst minority anti-war report,
which received 31 votes, was submitted by Boudin. This
alone—the fact that these two men were allowed to repre--
sent the anti-war position—shows how immature were the-'
views and attitudes of the Left elements at the convention-
And the resolutions bear that out.

However, soon after the convention things began to-.-
move pretty swiftly. There set in a process of rapid dif--
ferentiation within the Left, an unmasking of the maneu-
vers of the Hillquit leadership and the beginning of a
crystallization of a movement which resulted in the organ--«
ization of the Left wing of 1918. This was brought about.
primarily by the following factors: the open and flagrant.
betrayal of the St. Louis anti-war resolution by the Hillquit
leadership, which was especially glaring in Hillquit’s New
York Mayoralty campaign in the summer of 1918 and in
the pro~war activities of the Socialist aldermen in New“

York, in the decision of the National Socialist Party Con-M

ference to solidarize itself with the social-chauvinist Inter-

Allied Socialist Conference, etc.; the beginnings of mass.
disillusionment with the gigantic swindle of the “war to-
end war” and to make the world “safe for democracy”; the-*

activities of Lenin and the Bolshevik Party to rally and.

35

 

organize all the true internationalists throughout the world,
which were beginning to be more widely understood by the
class—conscious workers in the United States; and the vic-
tory of the Bolsl1evik Revolution in Russia, which demon-
strated the correctness of the Leninist principle of trans-
forming imperialist war into civil war for the establish~
ment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. _

Thus the Left wing of 1918 not only succeeded in sal-
vaging from the St. Louis resolution’ the grain of genuine
internationalism that it contained but it alsodeveloped this
further into a revolutionary position along the lines of
the Bolshevik point of view. A v

‘Closely allied with the war question was the question
of international aiﬁliation. Prior to the entry of the United
States into the war, the Hillquit leadership of the Socialist
Party tried to establish itself in the position of so-called
arbiter and peacemaker between the various groups in the
Second International. In Hillquit’s own words (Labor Year
Book 1917-1918), the Socialist Party had “preserved an
attitude of strict neutrality toward the belligerent powers
before our entrance in the war” and had at all times “en-
deavored to re-unite the Socialist International and to re-
vive it as a factor for lasting peace within and among the
nations of the world.” The reader will see that this was
in essence the position of social-chauvinism dictated at
the time by the interests of American imperialism which
(through the Wilson administration) was also trying to
maintain strict neutrality, seeking to function as “peace-
maker” between the warring nations._ The Hillquit leader-
ship, until the entrance of the U .5. into the war, was, more
or less frankly, trying to serve the interests of its “own”
bourgeoisie in the sphere of international relations.

36

 

On‘ the other hand, the Left elements in the Socialist
Party were deﬁnitely in sympathy only with the Left ele-
ments in the Second International _(Zimmerwa1d and
Kiental); But this sympathy was as yet (before 1918) un-
differentiated, with only a relatively small part of the
American Lefts deﬁnitely leaning toward the then extreme
Left of Zimmerwald and Kiental—the Bolsheviks and
their followers. But also on this question A the crucial
months of 1917-1918 brought in clarity and deﬁnite-
ness in political alignments in the American labor
movement. The Left wing of 1918 came into existence
taking its position on international afﬁliation together with
the Bolsheviks, expressingon this question, as on all the
other issues, the sentiments of the overwhelming majority

of the membership of the Socialist Party.

As a result the Hillquit leadership saw itself compelled
to engage in a lot of maneuvers calculated to cheat the

party membership and to check the growth of the Left

wing. Hillquit, Oneal 8: Co. even began to talk of the
collapse of the Second International and promised to join
in the rebuilding of the International only with such par
ties as had not been in coalition with the bourgeoisie dur~
ing the war. Of course, any honest following up of such
promises should have led to joining with the Bolsheviks in
effecting a complete break with the social-chauvinists and
Centrists. But the ofﬁcial leadersh-ip of the Socialist Party
were only maneuvering and cheating. All the while, they
were in deeds supporting the policies of Woodrow Wilson
(their own bourgeoisie), seeking to “rebuild” the Interna-
tional with the same social-chauvinist and Centrist elements
that had led to the collapse of the Second International in
1914. These maneuvers, of even a more “Left” character,

they continued also after the formation of the Communist
Party in 1919, inasmuch as considerable numbers of the
Socialist Party membership, which did not join the Com-
munist movement: in 1919 but preferred to stay in the
S.P. in the hope of making it more revolutionary, were
waveringly but none the less deﬁnitely pushing in the
direction of the Communist International. It was this
wavering group that forced through, at the Socialist Party
Convention in September, 1919, a resolution “in support
of the Third (Moscow) International not because it sup-
ports the ‘Moscow’ programs and methods, but because
‘Moscow’ is doing something which is really challenging
world imperialism” and because “it, is proletarian.” Con-
sidering these very substantial reservations to the program
and methods of the Communist International, and con-
sidering also the decisive fact that this resolution was being
passed at the time when the Left wing was already organ-
izing itself separately into a Communist Party, the above
resolution was objectively playing into the hands of Hill-
quit 8c Co., who were using it as a weapon against the
Communist International, while some of the. elements who
supported this resolution were subjectively and consciously
Centrist. The bulk of this group began to see the truth
of this contention only later on when they too broke with
the Socialist Party and joined with the Communists (1921).

When the Bolsheviks and their supporters issued the'ca1l
for the constituent Congress to organize the Communist
International, the issue of international affiliation in the
Socialist Party came to a head. The Left wing initiated
a referendum in the party on the following proposa1:.“that
the Socialist Party shall participate in an international
congress or conference called by, or in which participate,

38

 

 

the Communist Party of Russia (Bolshevik) and the Com-
munist Labor Party of Germany (Spartacan).” Because of
the sabotage and delay of the Socialist Party bureaucracy,
the results of this referendum became known only in May,

1919, after the First Congress of the Communist Interna-
tional had already been held (March, 1919). The result of
this referendum showed that the proposal of the Left wing
was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the members.
No wonder Hillquit 8c Co. did not want to make the result
known. It might be relevant to observe in this connection
that the reformists who made their main stand upon
“democracy” as against the dictatorship of the proletariat
were Haunting and violating every rule of inner-party de-
mocracy (betraying the St. Louis anti-war resolution,
violating the international affiliation referendum, etc.), in
order to make the Socialist Party safe for the democracy of
Morgan, Rockefeller 8c Co.

A Thus, the three principal issues of the Left wing against
the reformists in the S.P. were the dictatorship of the pro-
letariat versus bourgeois democracy, revolutionary struggle
against imperialist war and. proletarian inter-nationalism
versus social-chauvinism, and the Communist International
versus the Second International. All these issues arose
and matured on the background of the general ﬁght of the
Lefts for the revolutionary class struggle against reformism
and class collaboration. In its general ﬁght for class struggle
policies and tactics, the Left wing (especially in its Mani-
festo) emphasized particularly two points: the Marxian con-
ception of the class struggle as a political struggle and the
need of a revolutionary use of parliamentary action and the
need of class struggle industrial unionism.

It is well known that the reformists in the pre~war

39

 

Second International had reduced the political struggle of
the proletariat merely to parliamentary campaigns, and
these campaigns they had reduced to a purelyllegalistic
activity for reforming, that is, strengthening, capitalism.
This was also the policy of the oiﬁcial leadership of the
Socialist Party. But here the Left wing was confronted with

certain peculiarities in the American labor movement,

These were (1) the fact that the dominating labor organ-
izations from the point of view of ideological and political
inﬂuence among the workers were the trade unions and not
the Socialist Parties, the A. F. of L. under Gompers being
then the most important organization in the trade union
ﬁeld; (2) the fact that theoﬂicial attitude of the Gompers
bureaucracy toward the Socialist Party as a party was one
of hostility and opposition which, however, did not prevent

the closest collaboration of the Socialist trade union bu-/

reaucrats with Gompers;  the fact that the Hillquit
leadership maintained an attitude of Socialist Party non-
interference in the affairs of the trade unions, which in
practice led to collaboration with Gompers, which, in its
turn, meant collaboration with the capitalists.

The Left wing sharply challenged the narrow-parlia-
mentary and legalistic conception of political action as well
as the oﬂicial S.P. attitude of “non—interference” in the eco-
nomic struggles of the workers and their mass organizations.
The Manifesto states its position in the following way:

“We assert with Marx that ‘the class struggle is essentially a
political struggle’ and we can only accept his own oft-repeated
interpretation of that phrase. The class struggle, whether it mani-
fests itself on the industrial ﬁeld or in the direct struggle for
governmental control, is essentially at struggle for the capture
and destruction of the capitalist state. This is a political act.

40

 

In this broader view of the term ‘political,’ Marx includes revo-
lutionary industrial action. In other words, the objective of
Socialist industrial action is ‘political’ in the sense that it aims to
undermine the bourgeois state which ‘is nothing less than a
machine for‘the oppression of one class by another and that
no less so in a democratic republic than in a monarchy.’ ”

On the question of parliamentary action, which the
Manifesto considers only as one phase of political action
and not the most important one, it says the following:

“It (parliamentary action) must at all times struggle to arouse
the revolutionary mass action of the proletariat——its use is both
agitational and obstructive. It must on all issues wage war upon

/ capitalism and the state. Revolutionary Socialism uses the forums
of parliament for agitation but it does not intend. to and cannot
use the bourgeois state as a means of introducing socialism; this
bourgeois state must be destroyed by the mass action of the revolu-
tionary proletariat. The proletarian dictatorship in the form of
a Soviet state is the immediate objective of the class struggle.”

These rather lengthy quotations are reproduced here for
the reason that they show the weak as well as the strong
sides of the Left wing. It is clear that the general trend of

_ the Lefts on these issues was away from reformism and

toward 'Bolshevism. The central Marxist-Leninist idea is
here: that the class struggle is a struggle for the dictator-
ship of the proletariat and that the revolutionary party of
the proletariat must organize and direct/‘all the daily mani-

festations of the class struggle from this point of view,

Thus, the issue with reformism was drawn clearly, but not
clearly enough. The Left wing lacked the correct Leninist
conception of the dialectics of the class struggleand of the
role of the Party in it. »

On the dialectics of the class struggle. The Left wing

41

correctly emphasized the primacy of mass action, insisting
that all the forms of activity of the revolutionary party of
the workers be subordinated to the end of arousing and
organizing the struggles of the‘ masses against their ex-
ploiters. But the Left wing did not sufﬁciently understand
that revolutionary mass action does not spring out all
ready-made to conform to some pattern previously‘ drawn
up; The Left wing did not seem to realize that revolution-
ary mass action grows out only of the real living issues of
the class struggle, as it develops day by day, that these issues
are varied and manifold (sometimes big and sometimes
apparently ‘‘small’’), and that, depending upon the objec-
tive and subjective factors, these daily struggles will jump
up very rapidly to higher forms of mass action or they may
not rise higher at all or develop more slowly.

On the role of the Party. Here again the Left wing cor-
rectly emphasized the Leninist idea of the primacy of the
Party as the leader of all proletarian struggles (without,
however, showing any understanding of the role of the
Party as the leade_r of all oppressed: toiling farmers and
Negroes). But what was to be the role of the Party con-
cretely in the daily struggles of the masses for their partial
demands? How was the Party to deepen and widen these
struggles into political and revolutionary mass action? To
this the Left wing gave no answer or rather it gave the
wrong answer. The Manifesto says: “It is the task of a
revolutionary Socialist Party to direct the struggles of the
proletariat and provide a program for the culminating
crisis.” The reference here is to the revolutionary crisis
and the struggle for power, and the assumption here is that
the American proletariat will get to this stage merely by
the party carrying on agitation for its program. But how?

42

The Leninist idea of revolutionary agitation is that it be
carried on on the basis of concrete struggles for speciﬁc
demands and that in the course of these struggles the Party
aims to widen and deepen their political content, organiz-
ing the masses, organizing the Party, thus leading the masses
up, on the basis of their own experience, to higher forms of
revolutionary mass action. The Left wing had no such‘ idea.
As already pointed out, it had a non-dialectical conception
of the class struggle and it suffered greatly from an under-
estimation of the role of the Party as organizer and leader
of the daily struggles of the masses as well as organizer of
the proletarian revolution.

These weaknesses made themselves felt very strongly in
the. position of the Left wing on trade union questions.
Here the Left wing sought to combat the craft and “pure
and simple” trade unionism of the Gompers bureaucracy
in the A. F. of L., on the one hand, and the oﬂicial S.P.
non-interference but practical collaboration with the Gom-
pers bureaucracy, on the other hand. To accomplish this
aim, the Left wing formulated the following position:
“Industrial unionism, the organization of the proletariat in
accordance with the integration of industry and for the
overthrow of capitalism, is a necessary phase of revolution-
ary Socialist agitation.” But in taking this position the
Left wing did not rise much above the traditional, that is,
sectarian policies of industrial unionism as practiced by the
dominating element in the I.W.W. (Industrial Workers
of the World) and in the S.L.P. (Socialist Labor Party). To
be sure, the Left wing was largely free (not fully) of the
syndicalist conception of industrial unionism, but the sec-
tarian understanding of it was there. The correct ﬁght for

industrial unionism in the United States called for a policy ‘

43

of active participation in the American Federation of Labor
(the largest mass trade union organization), the systematic
building of 3. Left wing within it and participation in
and leadership of the daily economic and other struggles of
the workers against their exploiters. But this is not what the
Left wing was proposing to do. Its full proposal on this
question in the ‘Manifesto reads as follows:

“Realizing that a political party cannot reorganize and recon-
struct the industrial organizalions of the working class, and that
that is the task of the economic organizations themselves, we
demand that the Party assist this process of reorganization by a
propaganda for revolutionary industrial unionism as part of its
general activities. \/Ve believe it is the mission of the Socialist
movement to encourage and assist the proletariat to adopt newer
and more effective forms of organization and to stir it into newer
and more revolutionary modes of action.” ‘

The A. F. of L. is not in the picture at all. The Party is
called upon to ﬁght for industrial unionism only by means
of general propaganda. The ﬁght for industrial unionism is

’conceived as more or less of an organizational problem in-

stead of as an organic part of the general revolutionization
of the working class ‘and its mass organizations and the
struggle against the reformist trade union leaders. It will
also be seen from the above quotation that the Left wing
was not yet completely free of the Hillquit policy of “non-
interference” in the trade unions, for that is the meaning
ofvthe statement that ‘‘a political party ‘cannot reorganize
and reconstruct the industrial organizations of the work-
ing class.” Trying to avoid the pitfalls of S.L.P. sectarian-
ism, the Left wing failed to break altogether with the
official S.P. opportunism on the trade union question.

It is apparent that Lenin’s advice on this question to the

44

 

 

Socialist Propaganda League of America (1915) was either
unknown to the Left wing of 1918 or so little understood
that it made no mark on its policies. Lenin-endorsed the
position of.the Lefts against craft unions and for indus-
trial unions. But seeing the mechanical and sectarian twist
which the issue is receiving in the U.S., Lenin ﬁnds it
necessary to urge “the most active participation of all
Party members in the economic struggle and in all trade

unions and cooperative organizations’ of the workers.” The‘

emphasis upon the word. “all” is Lenin’s and the meaning
is clear: ﬁght for industrial unionism by participating in
the economic struggles of the masses and by working in all
unions, no matter how reactionary their leadership. This
meant primarily the unions of the American Federation of
Labor. This advice of Lenin became effective i.n the Ameri-
can labor movement only in later years, subsequent to the
organization and uniﬁcation of the Communist movement
and with the rise of the trade union Left wing (the Trade
Union Educational League headed by Foster), under the
guidance of the Communist International and of the Red
International of Labor Unions. ,

From the above it will be understood how the Left wing
cameto adopt a very sectarian and ultra-Left position on
the question of partial demands generally. The Left wing
correctly centered its attack upon the reformism of the S.P.
leadership, pointing out the “social-reform” character of
the S.P. program and platforms as well as its practices. This
was a move in the direction of Bolshevism, which move, at
the time, drew a pretty clear line of demarcation between
the opportunists and revolutionary Socialists. But unlike
the Bolsheviks, who always formulated partial demands for
mass struggles and through. these led the masses to higher

45

struggles and to the seizure of power, the Left wing ruled

out partial demands altogether. Here we have a case of the

Left wing trying to extricate itself from the opportunist
morass of the S.P. and falling into the sectarian pit of the
S.L.P. (which also ruled out partial demands). The Left
wing position was that “the Party must teach, propagate
and agitate exclusively for the overthrow of capitalism and
the establishment of socialism through a proletarian dic-
tatorship.” (Our emphasis—A.B.) This attitude, which the
Left wing carried over into the Communist movement,
proved one of the main obstacles to the growth of our
Party in the ﬁrst years after its formation.

The social-fascist slanderers of our movement (Oneal 8c
Co.) like to insist that the Communists in later years became
more “moderate” for a while, incorporating into their
programs and platforms the same social-reform planks for
which the S.P. leadership was attacked as opportunist in
1918-1919. What the social-fascists pretend not to under-
stand is this, that on the question of partial demands (as
on many others) the Communist movement of the United
States was developing from Left Socialism toward Bolshe-
vism. What appearsto the social-fascists as a return by the
Communists to S.P. social-reform practices is in reality a
more radical break with opportunism, Right and “Left,”
for underestimation of partial demands and struggle in the
Leninist sense is an expression of opportunism covered with
Left phrases; what actually took place in the Communist
movement, and is still taking place, but on a higher plane,
is a process of freeing itself from opportunism and sec-
tarianism and an ever closer approach to Bolshevism, not
alone in theory but also in the daily practice of mass revo-
lutionary activity. In this process the Communist move-

46

ment is learning to carry on the Bolshevik struggle against
opportunism on two fronts, Right and “Left,” which the
Left wing did not understand.

The Left wing also took issue with the reformists on
the question of the role of the Party and its organizational
structure. But on this _question the Left wing attacked only
the most obvious faults of the organization, such as its
loose petty-bourgeois structure, the lack of a single political
line obligatory for ‘every Party unit and member, the fact
that the Party press and educational institutions were run
as the private domain of individual “prominent” Socialists
rather than as Party institutions under Party control and
also the fact that the leading organs of the Party were
totally irresponsible before the Party membership, violat-
ing time and again the expressed wishes of the member-
ship, since these wishes were opposed to the opportunism
of the S.P. oHici.al leadership. The Left wing demanded a
correction of these opportunist abuses but it had not yet
risen to the understanding that a true revolutionary work-
ing class party must be a diﬁerent type of party in respect
to its leading role in the class struggle in all its forms, in
its relation to the non-Party mass organizations as the
Party's transmission belt to the working class, the principle
of democratic centralism, the primacy of the shop structure
of organization, Bolshevik discipline, etc. Thus, one might
say that the Left wing only signalized the need of a new
type of party without going much further, mainly because
it was not yet fully free from the influence of Right and
“Left” opportunism, the most decisive expression of which
on this question was .a considerable degree of faith in the
opportunist theory of spontaneity. We have already seen

above that the Left‘ wing assigned to the Party only an ~

agitational role in the daily struggles of the imasses prior
to the emergence of a revolutionary crisis, and that only
with the arrival of the revolutionary crisis does the Party
step in as the real organizer and leader of the ﬁght——which.
is the ﬁght for power. In other words, the maturing of the
revolutionary crisis on its subjective side was. conceived
largely as a spontaneous development. Hence the inability
of the Left wing to come closer to Leninism on_ the question
of the role of the Party and its structure. v .

To conclude with the subject of issues between the Left
wing of 1918 and the reformist leadership of the S.P., it,is
important to point«out at least two of the more funda-
mental issues which were practically not raised "by the Left
wing. These are the Negro question and the agrarian-
farmer question. These omissions willseerin today even
more astounding when we consider the fact that the Left
wing did place the struggle for power and the dictatorship
of the proletariat in the very center of its theoretical and
political ﬁght against the opportunists, showing thereby
the inﬂuence of Leninism. Then how could the Left wing
fail to raise the question of the allies of the proletariatin
the United States—the nationally oppressed Negro masses
and the toiling farmers? Besides, many of the implications
of the Negro question were at the time (1918-1919) mani-
festing themselves acutely in the class struggle and in the
unions (Chicago stockyards) whererthe Leftielements of
the A. F. of L., under Foster, were grapplingpwith these
problems, trying to ﬁnd a solution for-them.‘Under these
conditions, the failure of the Left wing to raise the Negro

‘-and agrarian questions would show that the Left wing

ideology was still largely dominated by reformism and sec-
tarianism: it took over from the STP. leadership its ignoring

of the Negro and‘ farmer questions, which to reformists’

could not appear as basic problems of the proletarian strug~
gle for power; it also took over some of the narrow craft
ideology, especially of the reformists in the unions, which
cannot see the working class as a class leading the ﬁght
against the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie in alliance with
and "supported by the Negro masses and the toiling farmers;
while its purely agitational attitude to the class struggle,
and general sectarian approach, prevented it from feeling
and evaluating the pressure of these issues that was coming
from the daily struggles of the masses. -

THE ORGANIZATIONAL BREAK WITH THE SOCIALIST
PARTY OPPORTUNISTS

From its very inception, the Left wing realized that its I

task was to bring about a complete break with the oppor-
tunists in the S.P., not only ideologically and politically but
also organizationally. While theoretically the Left wing
(with the exception of its most advanced elements) was
rather hazy on the especially dangerous role at the time of
Centrism, in practice the ﬁght was developed for the or-
ganizational break also with the Centrists. ,

In effect the organizational break with the opportunists
began to take place immediately after the organization of
the Left wing, while it still was formally a part of the
Socialist Party. Moreover, as Left groups were becoming
crystallized in various language sections, cities and branches
of the party, which took place throughout 1918, these
groups were practically ignoring the opportunist and social-
chauvinist policies of the oﬂicial leadership and were carry-

ing on their agitation and other mass work more or less in

accord with their own view of revolutionary Socialism.

49

 

This occurred especially on such issues as the war, interna-
tional aﬂiliations, the Bolshevik revolution in Russia (and
later the proletarian revolution in Germany), the Left
groups undertaking to carry out in practice their own point
of view even before there was a national Left wing organ-
ization and a national program. And wherever they did
so, the Left elements had the expressed overwhelming sup-
port of the party membership. Whatever truly revolution-
ary and internationalist work was carried on by the
Socialists of the United States at that time, was carried on
despite the official S.P. leadership (Hillquit 8c Co.) and
not because of it.

But on the question of how soon and in what form the
complete and formal break with the S.P. opportunists_
should take place, there soon developed in the Left wing
serious differences of opinion. These differences came to
sharp expression at the ﬁrst National Left Wing Confer-
ence, held in New York, in June, 1919. One section of the
delegates stood out for the immediate (or as soon as prac-
tically possible) convocation of a national convention of all
Left wing elements for the purpose of organizing the Com-
munist Party of America, while another section favored. a
slower and more ﬂexible mode of procedure calculated to
win for the Communist Party also the more backward and
hesitating elements of the S.P. This is not the place to dis-
cuss elaborately these differences, except to point out the
following: that it was a ‘difference of tactics, ‘and not of
principle as some of the Left wing delegates were inclined
to think at the time. Both sections had given unmistakable
proof of their determination to break formally with the
opportunists and to organize the Communist Party. But one
section of the Left wing proceeded from the belief that the

50

v «o my-V 4 «— --.......~_ ,.W,..... _ ,4‘, _v

 

formal break with the opportunists had been delayed long
enough, that there was no hope of the Left wing securing
formal control of the S.P. organization for the purpose of
transforming it into- a Communist Party because of the
wholesale expulsions carried on by the Hillquit leadership,
and that the hesitant Left elements who ‘would not join
in the organization of the Communist Party at once were
eifher no good or would come to the Party later. The other
section was not at all sure that the formal break had been
delayed but was agreed that the time for the break had
already arrived. However, it argued _that. considerable num-
bers of party members among the - native-born workers,
although in generalsympathy with the Left elements, were
not. yet ready for a formal break, but that they would be
won over soon to this step when it became more obvious
to them that it was Hillquit bureaucracy that was splitting
the party and not the Left Wing. Hence they proposed
a slower and less direct course which also led to the organ-
ization of the Communist Party in the United States. These
differences, which might have been composed if not com-
pletely eliminated, were aggravated, however, by disagree-
ments on the question of language federations in the party,
and also by a certain degree of factionalism. The result
was a split in the Left Wing, each side proceeding to carry
out it point of view.

There is this to be said on the question that is relevant
even today. The formal break with the opportunists in
the S.P.’was delayed. Had there been in the United States,
during the .war and especially in the crucial years of 1918-
1919, a strong revolutionary working class party—a Leninist
Party—the mobilization of the deep and powerful mass
upsurge of the American workers of that period would have

51

 

given the class struggle in the United States art entirely dif-
ferent turn. And the upsurge was not conﬁned to the work-
ers alone but was arousing also the Negro masses and the
toiling farmers in various degree. One cannot say whether

or not a revolutionary situation would have developed p

in the United States in the ﬁrst period of post-war capital-
ism had there been a strong revolutionary workers’ party,
but its absence certainly militated against the revolutionary
advance which was objectively being prepared and this
absence of a revolutionary party is directly traceable to the
historically delayed break of the revolutionary elements
from the opportunists in the Socialist movement.

From this, however, it does not follow that in the month

of June, 1919, the tactic of immediate break was the best. «

Certainly, when both sections of the Left VVing were ﬁnally
agreed that by September (the time of the emergency con-
vention of the S.P.) the formal break would have to be
consummated, and when mass sentiment inside and out-
side the party was continually rising in favor of the Left
Wing, the more ﬂexible tactics proposed for the winning
of the still hesitant elements, especially among the native-
born workers, were correct and in no way militated against-
the Left Wing widening its independent revolutionary
work among the masses outside of the S.P. Both could have
and should have been combined. Failure to realize this
resulted in a split and in the formation of two Commu-
nist Parties in September, 1g19——the Communist Party and
the Communist Labor Party.

Thus the formal break with the opportunists in the S.P.
became consummated and the basis laid for the building
of a mass Communist Party in the United States. Both

Communist conventions demonstrated in their delibera-

52

 

tions and programs considerably more clarity in their un-
derstanding of Leninism and its application in this coun-
try than did,the Left Wing. In the programs adopted by
these conventions we already ﬁnd the beginnings of an
understanding of the importance of partial struggles, of
their dialectics, and of their relation to the preparation of
the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat, We
also ﬁnd there a fuller understanding of the role of the
Communist Party as the leader of these struggles, a closer
approach to the practical problems of the class struggle
and of trade union work. In other words, the conventions
which formed the Communist Party and Communist Labor
Party took one more step away from Left Socialism ‘and
toward Communism. V

As already pointed out in the opening paragraphs of
this article, the historic role of the Left Wing of 1918-1919
consisted inithis, that it served as a bridge for the class-
conscious workers of the United States from vague Left
Socialism and general proletarian militancy to the solid
foundations of Leninism. This process of development was
by no means completed at the ﬁrst Communist conventions
but has been going on continuously in the Communist
movement throughout its history. Only, with each succeed-
ing period in the class struggle, old problems appeared
in a new fawn, new and strongerforces were being devel-
oped within our movement for the successful solution of

‘these problems, the general class struggle and our Party

with it rising to higher levels of revolutionary advance.
This is the struggle for the Bolshevization of our Party.
The question may be raised as to whether the present
“Left” Socialist tendencies are fulﬁlling the same role as the
Left Wing of 1918. The answer is this: far from playing

53

 

‘the same role, they are playing the opposite role. »Where
the Left Wing of 1918 was a bridge to Communism.‘ the
present “Left” Socialists, whether those in the S.P. or the
Musteites, are actually buildinga dam against Communism.
This does not mean that the rank-and-ﬁle proletarian ele-
ments in the S.P. who incline toward the Left and the
working class elements of the Muste movement are follow-

ing their “Left” reformist leaders because they (the rank,

and ﬁle) want a dam against Communism. Not at all.
Rather these reformist leaders put on a “Left” coloring in
order to stop this rank and ﬁle from moving further to
the Left, that is, to Communism. Let us make no mistake
about it. The rank and ﬁle of the reformist organizations
—Socialist and trade union—is genuinely moving to the Left
—to the Communist Party and to class struggle unionism.
Not all of them are as yet conscious of where they are
going; some of them still have many bourgeois prejudices
against Communism instilled into their minds primarily
by the “Left” reformists and most especially by the Muste-
ites; but if this rank and ﬁle is ever to have what it is
looking for—class struggle and a true working class party-
it will inevitably come to Communism. Of course, if we
leave uncombatted the activities of the “Left” Socialists
and Musteites, if we don’t expose them systematically
and in the course‘ of the class struggle, with the united
front policy, as “Left” social-fascists, and if we don’t prove
in practice the correctness of our line and our ability to
put it into effect. Muste and‘ Co. may succeed to an extent
in delaying and obstructing the drift to Communism.
Hence, the great signiﬁcance of the Open Letter and the
need of itslearnest and speedy execution.

The Party Anniversary
in the Light of Our Tasks ‘“"

N ITS Open Letter to the Sixth Convention of our

Party the Executive Committee of the Communist

International said the following: A

“The Workers (Communist) Party is obviously still unpre-
pared for the great class conﬂicts which will inevitably arise on
the basis of the sharpening class relations in the United States. »
Its past still weighs upon its present [Our emphasis——A.B.]. The
relics of the previous period of its existence form the greatest
obstacle in the path it has to travel before itsuccessfully passes
the turning point and develops in the shortest possible time-from
a numerically small propagandist organization into a mass politi-
cal party of the American working class.”

This task, the task of developing our Party from a nu-
merically small propagandist organization into a mass polit-
ical party of the working class, the Open Letter qualiﬁed
as “the chief, fundamental and decisive task to which all
other tasks must be entirely subordinated.” Furthermore,
the Open Letter said that this is the task “which the whole
objective situation in the United States, the entire post-war
development of American imperialism, places before the
Party.” ' -

I

munist Party of the United States, after the Sixth Conven-
tion, approaches our problems in this period from the
same angle. The Address stresses the vital necessity of our
Party converting itself in the shortest possible time into a
mass political Party of the working class. It points out that
this task has assumed a particularly decisive character in
View of the fundamental tasks arising before us “in connec-
tion with the accentuation of the inner andiouter contra-
dictions of American imperialism in the present period.”

Since the E.C.C.I. Address in the summer of 1929, our
Party has been engaged in thework of converting itself
into a mass political party of the American working class.
Its chief weapon for the attainment of this end has been
and continues to be the organization and leadership of the
daily struggles of the masses against the capitalist offensive
and the liquidation of the relics of the previous period
which obstruct our progress in the present period.

The Twelfth Anniversary of our Party, which occurred
in September of this year, ﬁnds us on the path which leads

to a mass Communist Party and freed from some of the.

relics of the previous period—the inner factional struggle-
which were obstructing our growth. The turning point,
however, we have not yet passed—that turning point which
we must successfully pass in order to be able to convert
our Party into a mass political Party in the shortest pos-
sible time. The Thirteenth Plenum of our ‘Central Com-
mittee declared that only “the first beginning of the turn
toward mass work was made,” that “the process is only
begun,” that we must now seize that particular link in the

. chain which would enable us to pass to the next link and

to turn the corner. The Plenum has pointed out" to the
Party the nature of that link. It is the building of the

56

Party and revolutionary unions in the shops, organizing

and leading the daily struggles of the employed and_

unemployed workers, combatting energetically "all manifes-
tations of opportunism. The carrying out of the practical
tasks formulated by the Thirteenth Plenum, increasing the
tempo of our work day by day in order to catch up with

s the demands of the sharpening crisis and war danger, will

create the prerequisites for the successful passing of the
turning point from which the Party will be able to develop
in the shortest possible time into a mass political party of
the American working class.

To fulﬁl the practical tasks formulated by the Thirteenth '

Plenum means to continue to liquidate those relics of the
previous period which are still obstructing our growth.
These are chieﬂy remnants of opportunism——Right oppor-
tunism (the main danger in the present period) and “Left”
sectarianism which is also opportunismylt is from this
angle that we must approach the review of the Party's past
development on the occasion of its Twelfth Anniversary.

THREE PERIODS IN THE PARTY’S DEVELOPMENT

It is possible to distinguish three deﬁnite periods in the
development of our Party. (1) The ﬁrst period is the period
of separation from social-reformism and the gathering of
the Communists in the United States into one Party. (2)
The second period is the period in which the Communist
Party developed itself into a propagandist‘ of Communism
and functioned primarily as a propagandist organization.-
(3) The third period is the period in which the Party be-
gins to emerge from the propagandist stage, moving to the
turning point from which will become possible its rapid
conversion "into a mass political party of the working class.

This division of our Party’s past development into
deﬁniteiand distinct periods, like every other historic de-
marcation, must be viewed dialectically. That is, that some
of the problems and tasks of one period were carried over
into the succeeding period and that the problems and
tasks of the succeeding period were already present, at
least in embryonic form, in the previous period. This,
however, does not prevent us from distinguishing deﬁnite
periods in the Party history. In what sense? In the sense
that each period placed before us speciﬁc and peculiar
tasks, which we undertook to fulﬁl in a certain way, thus
reaching the next period, the successive stage in the devel-
opment of the Party, with its own speciﬁc and peculiar task.

First Period. We deﬁned the ﬁrst period as the one in
which took place the differentiation and separation from
social-refonnism and the gathering together of the Ameri-
can Communists intolone Party. This period may be said
to have concluded with the organization of the Workers
Party in 1921. -

The beginning of this period is marked by intense ideo-

_ logical and organizational struggle in the American labor

movement (Socialist and trade unions) of the adherents of
militant class struggle against the reformist policies of the
oﬂicial leadership. The ﬁght of the American labor mili-
tants and Left Soci_alists against Gompersism and Hillquit-
ism was essentially (but not fully) of the same character as
the ﬁght of the revolutionary Marxists against the oppor-
tunists and revisionists in the Second International in the
period that preceded the late imperialisfworld war.

When did this period begin? In a broad historical sense,
the crystallization of the theory and practice of the revo-

58

lutionary class struggle of the American proletariat, whose
complete and conscious expression is Marxism-Leninism,
began with the ﬁrstlmanifestations of working class struggle
against capitalist exploitation in the United States. The
historic roots of the Communist movement of the United
States go back to the birth of the American working class
and the class struggle. These roots have absorbed and

grown upon the life-blood of all the struggles of the Ameri-

can working class and its advance guard through the vari-

ous periods in the history of the class struggle in the

United States.

But in a narrow sense, in the sense of the phase that .

immediately preceded the formation of the Communist
Party and Communist Labor Party (C.P. and C;L.P.) in
September, 1919, the ﬁrst period of our Party's history can
be said to begin with the organizational crystallization of
the Left Wing in the Socialist Party in 1918. The organ-
ization of the Left Wing was preceded by years of struggle
against reformism in the Socialist and trade union move-
ment of the country. This struggle, with its ups and downs,
had several culminating points in the years of 1905, 1912,
1914 and 1917. Through all these struggles the Left and
militant elements in the labor movement had given ex-
pression, often in a confused and incomplete manner, to
the interests and aspirations of the American proletariat
as against the corrupt la.-bor bureaucracy, aristocracy and
petty-bourgeois reformism. This was in essence the mean-
ing of the struggle for industrial unionism as against craft
unionism, for class struggle as against class collaboration,
for revolutionary Socialism as against the petty-bourgeois
reformism of the Hillquits and Bergers. The consolidation
of American imperialism in the pre—war period, with the

59

 

consequent sharpening of all inherent contradictions of
capitalism, has produ-ced on the one hand Gompersism and
Hillquitism, the expression of the corrupt bureaucracy and
aristocracy of labor, and on the other hand it has also
produced the various Left and militant tendencies in the
labor movement which gave expression to the awakening
proletariat, to its dawning consciousness of the need of
revolutionary class struggle and organization.

The Left Wing of the Socialist Party of 1918 was the

forerunner and organizer of our Party. With it began
(strictly speaking) the ideological and organizational dif-
ferentiation of revolutionary Socialism—later, Communism
-—from reformism. This Left Wing was born in the heat
and under the pressure of the late -imperialist world war
which opened up the epoch of proletarian and colonial
revolutions, and at the inception of ' the .great wave of
strikes in the United States that followed the end of the
war. Because of this -fact, this Left Wing was more con-
scious of its mission and objective than its predecessors. It
declared war againstreformism along the entire front. It
battled against Gompersism and Hillquitism on the ques-
tion of war, taking its position against the imperialist war,
at ﬁrst semi-paciﬁst but later approaching the Leninist
position. It sided unequivocally with the proletarian revo-
lution in Russia. It was trying to link itself up interna-
tionally with the revolutionary Socialists led bylLenin in
the Second International. \Vith the formation of the Com-
munist International, this Left Wing made its major battle
of that period in the labor movement of the United States
on the issue of breaking with the treacherous Second Inter-
national and for joining the Communist International. It
was in the process of this struggle against imperialism and

60

 

imperialist war, for the class struggle and against class
collaboration, for revolutionary Socialism against petty-
bourgeois reformism, for the proletarian revolution in

Russia, for the Communist International against the Sec- -

0nd International, that there began the process of organ-
izational separation from the reformists in the Socialist
Party which led to the organization of the two Communist
Parties in September, 1919.‘ '

The organization of the two Communist Parties took
place in the midst of the ﬁrst period of the post-war_ de-
velopment -of capitalism, the period of “extremely acute
crisis of the capitalist system and of direct revolutionary»ac-
tion on the part of the proletariat” (Resolution of the Sixth
Congress of the C.I.). The working class of the United
States was in great fermentation. Great strikes were “in
process of development in the steel industry, mining, rail-

road, meat-packing, etc. But the ideological differentiation"

between reformism and revolutionary Socialism was at that
time very little known or understood by the masses. This
fact, arising partly fromthe historically delayed organiza-
tional separation of the Socialists from the reformists,
together with the formation of two Communist Parties
struggling with each other, offers the main reason for the
relative ineffectiveness of the Communist Parties in those
strikes. The strong sectarian tendencies prevalent in the
two parties at the time had worked toward the same end.

In view of the above; what were the speciﬁc tasks of the

Communists of that-period and to what extent did they‘

succeed in fulﬁlling'.themP

The first of the tasks that were placed before us by the
objective situation and by the internal condition of the
young Communist movement at that time was to unify it,

61

 

to bring together all adherents of the Communist Interna-
tional into one party. This involved the task of completing
the organizational break with the reformist political parties,
since various groups of adherents of the Communist Inter-

. national had remained in the “Socialist” parties, especially

the Socialist Party of America, subsequent to the forma-
tion of the Communist Parties in September, 1919, and

the uniﬁcation of these two parties (Communist Party and;

Communist Labor Party) into one party. The second task
was to establish active contact with the proletarian masses
and mass movements. This involved the task of penetrating
the reformist mass organizations, especially the A. F. of L.,
the organization of the Communists and their sympathizers
within the reformist unions for the struggle against Gom-
persism, the popularization of the Communist program
among the masses on the basis of their daily struggles and
experiences, and skillful resistance to the efforts of ﬁle re-
formists and the government to isolate us from the masses
and to drive the young Communist movement underground
(the Palmer raids), while building up all necessary ma-
chinery for the protection of the Party organization from
governmental attacks. The third task was to deepen and
extend the struggle against reformist ideology, to analyze

‘the American situation in a theoretical way from the Com-

munist point of View and to educate the membership t.o an
understanding of Marxism-Leninism.

These tasks, which were placed before us by the external
and internal conditions of the Communist movement at
that time, were only partially fulﬁlled during the first
period of the Party’s existence. The vital task of establish-
ing active Contact with the masses and of organizing the
Communists and militant workers within the A. F. of L.

62

 

1

for the struggle against the Gompers policies and leader-
ship—~this fundamental task. of the ﬁrst period was left
almost untouched. This task, the fulﬁlment of which was to
create the prerequisites for the independent leadership of
the daily struggles of the workers by the Communists, began
to be tackled in earnest only in the second period of the
Party’s existence, following the formation of the Workers
Party at the end of 1921. Nor were the Communists suc-
cessful in _the ﬁrst year or so in combatting effectively the
wall of illegality that the government had tried to erect
between our Party and the masses. However, the achieve-
ments of the period stand out quite clearly. The Com-
munist movement was uniﬁed under the pressure and
guidance of the Communist International. The Party with-
stood the terriﬁc onslaught of the Palmer raids and the
regime of persecution that followed. It succeeded in draw-
ing a clear line of demarcation between itself and the re-

V formists, drawing into its ranks and rallying around itself

the most mature and militant elements in the labor move-
ment. The Communists came to the ﬁrst convention of
the Workers Party with a clearer realization of the nature
of those opportunist tendencies which have militated against
the Party’s growth, especially in the ﬁeld of mass work.
What were those tendencies? First there was the “Left”
opportunist conception that revolutionists can have noth-

ing to do with reformist unions, that the Communists ‘

must not work in the reactionary unions of the A. F. of L.,

that they must build their own unions. Considering the’

objective situation of the time and the fact that the Com-
munist movement had just been organized, this meant in
practice no work in the unions and no mass work. It meant
to condemn the Party to the position of a sect. On the

63

 

other hand, there was the Right opportunist conception,
taken over from the S.P. reformist leadership, that we must
live “in peace” with the reactionary bureaucrats of the
A. F. of L. and that the “political arm” of the movement
(the Party) must not interfere with and “dictate” its poli-
cies to the union. This meant to surrender the masses to
Gompers and to the capi.talists. It meant no work in the

unions and no revolutionary mass work of any kind. These I

opportunist tendencies, especially the “Left” sectarian ten-
dency, were primarily responsible for the fact that the
fundamental tasks of our movement in its first period were

fulﬁlled only partially, as was indicated above. These two,

opportunist tendencies have manifested themselves in all
ﬁelds of Party activity——in the question of legal and illegal
work, parliamentary activities, partial demands and daily
economic struggles, etc. In the struggle against these tenden-
cies,'in the clariﬁcation of the correct policies with» the
direct and systematic assistance of the C.I. and R.I.L.U.,
the Party had moved forward to internal consolidation,
to the establishment of contacts with the workers and their
mass organizations, and to a better understanding of Lenin-
ist policies and tactics. In this way the Party had reached
the second period of its existence’, the next and higher stage
in its development which was ushered in by the ﬁrst con-
vention of the Workers Party at the end of 1921.

Second Period. The second period in the history of our
Party is the period in which it developed itself into a propa-
gandist of Communism and functioned primarily as a
propagandist organization. Essentially, the Party is still in
this period, but just now it is beginning to emerge from
it. Already there are signs to show that we are nearing

64

a new period in the life of the Party—the period of de-
velopment into a mass political party of the American
working class. ‘ '
This period, which is thus far the longest in our Party’s
history, is marked by the following characteristics: (a) the
Party carries on systematic work in the unions of the A. F.
of L., taking the leadership in the organization of the Left
Wing in the unions (Trade Union Educational League);
(b) the Party begins to participate in the political struggles,
especially in various election campaigns, aiming to apply in
this ﬁeld‘ the policy of the united front, evolving in this
process its labor party policies; (c) the illegal Communist
Party and the Workers Party (its legal expression) become
fully merged; (d) the Party takes the ﬁrst steps in the direc-
tion of work among the Negro masses; (e) there become
crystallized within the Party two rigid factions, carrying on
an almost uninterrupted struggle during most of this
period, until the summer of 1929 when the E.C.C.I. Address
lays the basis for the liquidation of the factional situation;
(f)"the appearance of Trotskyism and the development of
Right opportunism and the struggle of the Party against it.
The development of our Party in the course of these
years was taking place on the basis and within the frame-
work of the second period in the development of post-war
capitalism. This was the period of “gradual and partial
stabilization of the capitalist system, of the ‘restoration’
process of capitalist economy, of the development and ex—_

pansion of the capitalist offensive and of the continuation’

of the defensive battles fought by the proletarian army
weakened by severe defeats. On the other hand, this period
was a period of rapid restoration in the U.S.S.R., of extreme-
ly important successes in the work of building up socialism,

65

 

T and also of the growth of the political inﬂuence of the

Communist Parties over the broad masses of the prole-
tariat.” (Resolution of Sixth Congress of the C.I.)

The peculiarities of the objective conditions at the time
of the formation of the Workers Party (end of 1921 and
beginning of 1922) arose from the fact that it was a period
of transition from the ﬁrst period of post-war capitalism
to its second period. That is, the transition from the period
of “extremely acute crisis of the capitalist system and of
direct revolutionary action on the part of the proletariat”
to the period of temporary and relative stabilization and
“the continuation of the defensive battles fought by the
proletarian army weakened by severe defeat.” The greatest

4 danger that confronted our Party at that time was the

danger of “Left” sectarianism which threatened to isolate
us from the masses by failing to utilize the then existing
possibilities _for Communist mass work, especially the work
in the A. F. of L. and the systematic application of. the
united front policy. At the same time the Party was men-
aced by the tendencies of Right opportunism which tended
to relinquish the independent revolutionary role of the
Communist Party by various maneuvers on top with re-
formist leaders. V
Between the years of 19224927 the Party developed into
a propagandist organization. It funct.ioned primarily as a
propagandist of Communism. Its efforts to become a mass

" party of the American proletariat and the leader ‘‘ of the

daily struggles of the workers against capitalist exploitation
and capitalist rule have been seriously hampered by the
opportunist tendencies and by the inner factional struggle,
with the consequence that the beginning of the third period
in the post-war development of capitalism found our Party

66

-u...u...—....-uu_................w.............-..i.._.__.... . ,

 

unprepared for the great class conﬂicts that have arisen and
continue to arise in increasingly sharper forms.

The possibilities for our Party becoming the leader of
the daily struggle of the masses, and hence for its conver-
sion into the mass political party of the American prole-
tariat, were already inherent in the objective conditions
that were beginning to shape themselves aroundi1927. This
was clearly seen in the big strike movements of that year
(miners, furriers, garment workers, textile in New Bedford
and Paterson) in which the Party and the T.U.E.L. were
playing a leading and organizing role. From these struggles,
and the independent leading role played by us in them.
the road was opening up for a new period in the life of
our Party. The second period of post—war capitalism was
coming to an end and the third period was approaching
with all the possibilities and responsibilities that this situ-
ation was bringing to us. But the Party was unable to
utilize fully these possibilities, to reorientate itself and
to make the turn toward, the approaching new period,

because of the acute factional situation in the Party and _

the serious Right opportunist tendencies that had accumu-
lated in the Party in the previous years.

Hence the Open Letter of the E.C.C.I. to the Sixth Con-
vention of the Party had to declare that “from a propagan-
dist organization . . . the Workers (Communist) Party is

‘non; beginning [Our em-phasis~—AV.B.] to turn into, amass

Party,” that “the Party is now just making its ﬁrsit "steps
on the new path.’ It is now just on the threshold between
the old and new, it has not yet passed the turning point.”
It was in this letter that the E.C.CI.. also declared that
“the existing factions must. be resolutely and deﬁnitely
liquidated. The factional struggle must be unconditionally

stopped. Without this no mass Communist "Party of the
American proletariat can be organized.” V

The liquidation of factionalism which became a condi-
tion for the growth of the Party, for the successful struggle
against the Right danger as the main danger in the present
period and for the conversion of the Party into a mass
Party, was accomplished after the Sixth Convention of the
Partywith the help of the Address of the E.C.C.I. which
constitutes a milestone in the Party’s history. In this way
the conditions were created for a fresh and de.terrnin.ed
effort to -pass the turning point that leads to the conversion
from a propagandist organization into a mass political
party of the American working class.

Third Period. This period we have deﬁned as the one in
which the Party begins to emerge from the propagandist
stage, moving to the turning point from which will become
possible its rapid conversion into a mass political party of
the working class. Strictly speaking it is not yet a com-
pletely new period. It is more in the nature of a transition
stage from the old to the new but with this speciﬁc charac-
teristic, that the Party is now moving unitedly, consciously
and honestly toward the turning point, the passage of
which will mark the full unfolding of the third period—
the rapid development of our Party into a mass party.

Herein lies the basic explanation of our lagging behind
the radicalization of the masses. Whereas objectively the
capitalist system and the world labor movement are already
fully in the third period of post-war development, our
Party still ﬁnds itself in transition to the‘ present period.
It is true that -the tempo of our movement is continually
increasing, but not sufficiently to catch up with the con-

68

 

tinued shattering of capitalist stabilization and the grow-
ing radicalization of the masses. The successive stages of
the Party’s development since the E.C.C.I. Address (the
Seventh Convention, Twelfth and Thirteenth Plenum of
the Central Committee) each marked a step in advance, at
the same time taking note of the outstandng fact that we
continue to lag behind. We must therefore make haste in
the execution of the decisions of the‘Thirteenth Plenum.
The Twelfth Anniversary of our Party ﬁnds us free
from factional divisions, united behind the Central Com-
mittee on the line of the C.I., extending our inﬂuence
among the masses and our leadership of their daily strug-
gles, and determined to convert ourselves into a mass party.
Our Party stands out today as the only leader of the work-
ers in their daily struggles against’ the capitalist offensive
(unemployment, wage cuts, imperialist war and interven-
tion, etc.). The great and historic strike of the miners, the
strikes of the‘ textile workers in Paterson and Lawrence,
the struggles of the unemployed and the ﬁght against im-
perialist war and intervention organized and led by our
Party and the revolutionary unions. of the Trade Union
Unity League are ampleproof of this fact; while the Love-
stone and Cannon renegades have moved into the camp
of the enemy. At. the same time we are still hampered by
some of the relics of the previous period of our existence
(Right and “Left” opportunism, especially Right opportu-

nism, formalism and bureaucracy), which we must combat

consistently and energetically, as formulated by the’Thir-
teenth Plenum of our Central Committee.

In its Address to our membership in the summer of 1929,
the E.C.C.I. said:

69

 

“With a distinctness unprecedented in history, American capi-
talism is exhibiting now the effects of the inexorable laws of
capitalist development, the laws of decline and downfall of capital-
list society. The general crisis of capitalism is growing more rapidly
than it may seem at first glance. The crisis will shake also the
foundation of the power of American imperialism.”

The truth of this prognostication is realized not only by '

us, members of the Party, but is beginning to be felt and‘
understood by hundreds and thousands and millions of;
American workers. The deepening crisis, the war danger
(war already a; reality in Manchuria), the entry of the
U.S.S.R. into the period of socialism—these are hastening
the radicalization of the masses, leading- them to a realiza-
tion of the need of a revolutionary way out of the crisis.
More than ever the masses need the leadership of our Party
and the revolutionary unions of the T.U.U.L. This leader-
ship we must bring to the masses without delay, exposing
and combatting the Right and “Left" reformists with their
renegade assistants that are trying desperately to check the
radicalization of the masses. «

lowed as the leaders of the proletariat and of all oppressed
in every country of the world. i ' .

The bourgeoisie, and especially the social-fascist agents in
the labor movement, speak of_Comintern “interference” in
American affairs as though the Comintern was something
foreign to and outside of the working class of the United

States. But that is sheer nonsense. The revolutionary van-

guard of the American proletariat, organized in the Com- ‘

munist Party of the U.S.A., is blood of the blood and ﬂesh
of the ﬂesh of the American working class; and it is this
Party that represents the Comintern in the United States.
On the other hand, the Comintern is a world party, and its

_ “interference” in the affairs of its various national sections

is nothing else but assistance rendered by all of these Parties
collectively to each of them separately. But the social-fas-
cists usually press the point further. It isn't, they say, so
much the “interference” itself as the “dictatorial” way in
which it is done. And the “Left’f social-fascists (Muste 8c
Co.), sometimes assisted and at other times -led by the rene-
gades from Communism (Lovestone and Trotsky-Cannon),
push the same argument from a somewhat different angle.
These-the “Left” social-fascists and the renegades—-pretend
to be concerned with what they call the ‘‘national’’- peculiar-
ities ofvthe American labor movement which the Comin-

tern so the claim fails to take into consideration. These ‘
Y

claims and assertions would be laughable if they were not
the direct reﬂection of bourgeois nationalism and imperial-
ist chauvinism with which monopoly capital is now trying
to fascize its rule and prepare for war.~Muste’s “American-
ism” and Lovestone’s “exceptionalism,” therefore, assume
especial value for the New Dealers, the value of the most
“advanced” detachments of the imperialist and chauvinist

72

 

bourgeoisie operating among the more conscious workers.
Stalin has long agoanswered these laughable arguments.
As to dictation from the outside, he said:

“There are no such Communists in the world who would agree
to work ‘under orders’ from outside against their own convic-
tions and will and contrary to the requirements of the situation.
Even if there were such Communists they would not be worth a
cent. Communists bravely ﬁght against a host of enemies. The
value of a Communist, among other things, lies in that he is able
to defend his convictions. Therefore, it is strange to speak of
American Communists as not having their own convictions and
capable only of working according to ‘orders’ from outside. The
only part of the labor leaders’ assertion that has any truth in it
at all is that the American Communists are affiliated to a_n inter-
national Communist organization and from time to time consult
with the central body of this organization on one question or

9 another.’’*- (P. 30.)

And as to the “national” peculiarities, the refuge of every
opportunist, Stalin observes:

“It would be wrong to ignore the speciﬁc peculiarities of
American capitalism. The Communist Party in its work must take
them into account. But it would be still more wrong to base the
activities of the Communist Party on these speciﬁc features, since
the foundation of the activities of every Communist Party, in-
cluding the American Communist Party, on which it must base
itself, must be the general features of capitalism, which are the
same for all countries, and not its speciﬁc features in any given
country. It is on this that the internationalism of the Communist
Party is founded. Speciﬁc features are only supplementary to the
general features.” (Speech in the American Commission of the
Presidium ‘of the E.C.C.I., 19:49.)

GUIDING THE AMERICAN PARTY

We shall sketch brieﬂy the most outstanding events in
the life of the American Party where consultation with
and advice from the Comintern marked off a special stage
in the development of the revolutionary movement in the
United States.

The bringing together of all’ American revolutionary’

workers into one Communist Party——to realize this historic
task of the American working class with the least waste of
time and energy—was the ﬁrst of the more signiﬁcant acts
of advice of the Comintern to the revolutionary workers
in the United States. Considering the historically delayed
organizational break with the opportunists in the Socialist
movement, on the one hand, and the heterogeneous char-
acter of the Left elements in the American labor move-
ment out of which came the Communist Party, on» the
other hand, this uniﬁcation was no easy or simple task.
The diﬂiculties lay in the “speciﬁc” features of American
capitalism and of the labor movement. And in the years
1919-1921, the best elements of the American working class
had been struggling to overcome the effects of these “speci-
ﬁc” features and to arrive at a united‘ and single Com-
munist Party. If it were possible to imagine those years
without a Communist International (which, of course, is
impossible), these struggles for Communist unity would
have been inﬁnitely more protracted, wasteful and harm-

- ful than was actually the case. But there was a Communist

International, led by Lenin, and, consequently, there was
made available to the revolutionary workers of the United
States the world experience and prestige of the Bolshevik
movement which has gone‘ through a long struggle with

74

 

opportunism and built up a united Communist Party.
These experiences the Comintern utilized in order to help

the American Communists of those years to solve their own
_ speciﬁc problems of unity, and these problems were solved.

A uniﬁed and single Communist Party was materialized
in the United States in shorter time, less painfully and
wastefully, than would have been the case without the ad-
vice and assistance of the Comintern. Is there a single class-
conscious worker in the United States who, having familiar-
ized himself with this event, would reproach the Comintern
for “interfering” in American affairs or reproach the Ameri-
can Communists for accepting this “interference”? No,
only Muste 8c Co., and the renegades, who echo the
chauvinism of the Yankee imperialists, will utter such
reproaches.

We come now to another milestone of Comintem leader-
ship. This time it was the problem of breaking through
the walls of illegality erected by the American bourgeoisie
between the young Communist Party and the working class.
The Communists, having been driven underground by
Wilson-Palmer in 1919-1920, were struggling to ﬁndgtheir

‘ way to the masses despite the illegality and governmental

persecutions. What were the special difficulties for the
solution of this problem? They arose from the danger of
seeking to achieve legality by sacriﬁcing Communist prin-
ciples and hiding the revolutionary line, on the one hand,
and from the danger of trying to preserve intact the Com-

_ munist principles by abandoning all serious ﬁght for legal

and open work, on the other hand.

The way to the masses, the Communist Party could then
ﬁnd only by ﬁghting and overcoming these Right and
“Left” opportunist dangers. One of the founders of the

75

recently launched Muste American VVorkers’ Party, Hard-
man—Salutsky, was at that time especially active in trying
to switch the Communist movement to the path of buying
legality by sacriﬁcing the revolutionary line. Lacking the
necessary Leninist training and experience, the American
Communist Party found it extremely difficult to reach the
correct solution of this task and was therefore torn between

the two opportunist dangers of legalistic liquidation of the ‘

Communist Party and underground sectarianism. Once
more -the American Communists consulted with the Com-
munist International. This was in 1921-1922. And the
correct advice came, as it was bound to, and with its help
the Workers’ ’Party of America ‘was organized, which
opened up for the illegal Communist Party of America
wide opportunities for open revolutionary work among the
masses. Illegal work, that is, revolutionary mass work that
could not be done openly because of governmental persecu-
tions, was not abandoned but continued; the illegal work
supplementing the legal, and vice versa. _

The Party authority continued to rest in the under-
ground Communist Party, as it should be under these con-
ditions. And whenwthe inﬂuence of the Communists in
the Workers’ Party had become ﬁrmly established, and the
basic revolutionary mass work could be carried on through
the Workers’ Party legally, then the underground Com-
munist‘ Party became merged with -the Workers’ Party, that
is, the latteribecame the Communist Party of the country.
American Communism thus solved-its immediate task and
reached a higher stage in its development toward becom-
ing the mass party of the American proletariat.

What was it that proved especially helpful for the Ameri- A

can Communists in the Comintern advice on legal and
\ .

76

illegal work? It was the world and Russian experience of
Bolshevism. Under Lenin’s guidance .the Bolsheviks had
repeatedly met and solved such and similar problems and
solved them successfully, as history has_ proved. The Bol-
shevik solutions, while-primarily applied in Russia because
there was the Party to do it, were based upon the experi-
ences of the working’ class movement all over the world
and thus acquired an international signiﬁcance. The Ameri-
can Communists have been helped by the Comintern in
applying these solutions to American conditions. In do-

ing so they not only defeated the efforts of the bourgeoisie-

to strangle the revolutionary movement in the period of
1919-1921, but have also acquired knowledge and skill to
defeat such efforts again, especially in the present period
of sharp turn to fascism and war which inevitably brings
new atacks upon the legality of the Communist Party and

the working class movement as a whole. Will any sincere

and militant worker in the United States, who is loyal to
his class and its liberation from the misery and sufferings
of capitalism,- reproach the Comintern for having helped
the American revolutionary workers to defeat the Wilson-
Palmer persecutions? And will such a worker hold it
against the American Communist Party for having accepted
this helpful guidance? No, only Muste-Hardman 8c Co.,
led by the renegades, will indulge _in such reproaches, be-
cause this select company is echoing the raging chauvinism
of the Yankee imperialists.

The next milestone in the Comintern leadership for the
American Party we ﬁnd on the ‘question of trade union
work. On this, more perhaps than. on any other question.

the Left and militant elements in the American labor move- _

ment, in the two decades before the emergence of the Com-

77

intern (not to go into ‘the pre-imperialist era), had got
themselves tangled up in insoluble diﬂiculties, torn between
reformism and anarcho—syndicalism, only because they
were unable, by their own efforts, to restore and further

develop the revolutionary teachings of Marx and to apply

them to the United States of the imperialist era. Lenin
did that; but the American militan-ts (even they) were too
provincial, not enough international, because still inﬂu-
enced by bourgeois ideology, to ﬁnd out what Leninism
stands for and what it could do for the progress of the
American working class. The Comintern brought the
American militants and Lefts closer to the world labor
movement and to the basic problems of the American labor

‘movement. The trade union question was one of them.

The young American Communist movement struggled
painfully to -throw off the ballast of Gompers-Hillquit re-
formism and DeLeon-I.W.W. sectarianism, sometimes fall-
ing victim to the former, at other times to the latter, and
occasionally to both. Even the best andmost experienced
among the Left and militant leaders of the American work-
ers, the builders and founders of the revolutionary move-
ment of the American workers in the imperialist era, such
as the late Charles E. Ruthenberg, as well as the present

 

leader of our Party, William Z. Foster, were able to rid.

themselves and our movement of the old ballast of op-
portunism only by coming closer to Leninism and into
the Comintern. By becoming more international, the prole-
tarian vanguard in the United States has become also more
American, because the international egcperience, as it is
incorporated in Leninism and in Comintern guidance,
helped the American Communists to come closer to the
basic masses of the American proletariat and to begin

78

to ‘function as the leaders of its struggles. against American
capitalism.

It was Comintern advice and guidance that helped the
American Communists to turn full face to the building of
a Left Wing in the reformist unions beginning with 1920;
it was the advice of the Comintern that helped formulate
a correct solution to one of the basic problems of the
American proletariat—the organization of the unorganized

into trade unions; it was advice of the Comintern on inde- _

pendent leadership of the economic struggles by the revolu-
tionary elements that helped formulate strikepolicies and
tactics; it was Comintern advice on how to revolutionize
the labor movement, through organization and leadership
of the daily struggles of the masses and systematic exposure
and struggle against the reformists, that helped the Ameri-
can Communists to prove to wide masses of workers and
toilers that the C.P.U.S.A. is the only true proletarian party
in the United States and the leader of all exploited. In
short, at every stage in the development of the revolution-
ary trade union movemen-t in the United States (Trade
Union Educational League, class struggle unions of. the
Trade Union Unity League, the application of the united
front on the trade union ﬁeld, the ﬁght for trade union
unity, etc.), it was with the help of the Comintern that the
American revolutionary workers were able to ﬁnd the cor-
rect way, to correct their errors and, through manifold
changes in tactics, to press on to the goal of building a
revolutionary trade union movement in the United States.

Comintern inﬂuence on. the development of revolution-
ary trade union policies in the United States has especial
signiﬁcance. Here, as in other capitalist countries, the im-
perialist bourgeoisie, with the help of the reformists, suc-

79

 

ceeded in splitting the working class, setting the-small
minority of “labor aristocrats” against the basic mass of
the proletariat. Following out this policy, the reformist
trade union bureaucracy was persistently shutting out of
trade union organization the bulk of the American prole-
tariat, especially its most oppressed and exploited sections.
This it was that constituted and still constitutes one of
the chief weaknesses of the American working class. And
the most damning indictment against the A. F. of L.
bureaucracy is its discrimination and exclusion of the
Negro proletariat.

I-t is signiﬁcant, therefore, that the ﬁrst question which
Comrade Stalin put to the American trade union delega-
tion was: “How do you account for the small percen-tage of
American workers organized in trade unions?” And he
added: “I would like to ask the delegation whether it re-
gards this small percentage of organized workers as a good
thing. Does not the delegation -think that this small per-
centage is an indication of the weakness of the American
proletariat and of the weakness of its weapon in the strug-
gle against the capitalists in the economic ﬁeld?”

That was in 1927. Lack of space does not permit to deal
here with the answer of the delegation. Sufﬁce it to say
that this delegation, made up as it was of so-called pro-
gressives, really bourgeois liberals, was in its answers, at
best, very helpless and confused. But the intent of Stalin’s
question is clear: Why don’t you organize the workers in
trade unions? Why don’t you strengthen them against the
capitalis-ts? And it was in this direction that the Comintern
threw the full weight of its inﬂuence and advice in the
American labor movement. Organize thebasic sections of
the proletariat into unions, liberate the existing mass trade

80

 

unions from the stranglehold of the reformists, and unify
the trade union movement of this country—this was the
nature of Comintern ‘ guidance to the revolutionary work-
ers in the United States. ‘

Tactics and methods of work may vary, depending upon
the state of the class struggle. In the light of recent events,
the Communist Party favors the organization of indepe11-
dent unions in those cases where such a measure would-
constitute a step in advance toward the revolutionization
of the trade union movement. But the strategic aim always
remained the same, and for this aim the Communist .Party
ﬁghts bravely and persistently and with increasing effec-
tiveness. The general crisis of capitalism, undermining the
basis of existence of large numbers of the “labor aristoc-
racy” as well as the working class as a whole, creates ever
more favorable conditions for the realization of this aim.
So, we ask again: can any American worker, who is alive
to the needs of his class and is willing to ﬁght for them,
ﬁnd anything to object to in this “interference” of the
Communist International in American affairs? And will
he object to the Communist Party of the United States
accepting and taking deep satisfaction in such “interfer-
ence”? No, he will not. Only Muste and Co., abetted by
the renegades, will object and will call it “outside dicta-
tion,” because these groups echo the mad chauvinism of
the Yankee imperialists.

We shall now relate another signiﬁcant instance of Com-
intern leadership in the United States. In the years 1921-.
1924, one of the important phases of the American labor
movement was a widespread urge for the organization of
21 Labor Party. The Left Wing in the Socialist Party and
the ﬁrst Communist Party convention took a completely

81

 

negative attitude toward it. But in their struggle to estab-
lish contact with the masses and with their movements
against capitalism and its major political parties, the Amer-
ican Communists came to adopt the position of active par-
ticipation in the Labor Party movement. The aim of this
position was to accelerate the_ existing break-away move-
ment of the workers and toiling farmers from the capitalist
parties and to direct this movement along. the channels
of independent working class political action. Comintern
influence and advice strengthened the American Commu-
nists in this determination, thus helping -to overcome the
various sectarian objections to such a policy.

But it also did something else; it tried to guard the
American Communists against some of the reformist dan-
gers, for instance, the danger of forcing the organization
of a Labor Party before there was a sound proletarian mass
basis laid for it; or the danger of the Labor Party move-
ment becoming a tail end to the petty-bourgeois Farmer-
Labor movements with the inevitable submerging of the
workers and the young Communist Party into this petty-
bourgeois outﬁt controlled by bourgeois politicians. The
Comintern advise was: Beat back your sectarian tendencies,
participate actively in the Labor Party movement, build
unceasingly your own proletarian base and the proletarian
mass base for the Labor Party, especially by building the
revolutionary trade union movement, and ﬁght against all
Right opportunist tendencies to submerge-_ the workers in
petty-bourgeois movements. _

Unfortunately this advice was not. always followed, with
the result that the Communist Party itself began to ﬂirt
with the petty-bourgeois Farmer-Labor Party and with the
late LaFollette (1923-1924). If continued, such ﬂirtation

82

might have become highly dangerous for the cause of work-
ing class independent political action and for the Commu-
nist Party. Again Comintern advice was thrown in to
straighten out the Party’s line, and at the Sixth Congress
of the Comintem the American experiences were evaluated
afresh. This was done in the light of the general analysis
of the world (and American) situation, which showed the
weakening of the relative stabilization of capitalism, the
approach of a new and sharper phase of its general crisis,
and the consequent growing radicalization of the masses.
This was in 1928. And the Congress said to the American
Communists: “Concentrate on the work in the trade
unions, on organizing the unorganized, etc., and in this
way lay the basis for the practical realization of the slogan
of a broad Labor Party, organized from below.”

No wonder Muste, Hardman-Salutsky and Go. do not
like Comintern “interference/’ because it helps to expose,
and cuts straight across, the reformist machinations of this
“Left” social-fascist outﬁt. In 1922, the Communist Party
was forced to expel from its ranks the same Hardman~
Salutsky because he was working hand in glove with the
A. F. of L. bureaucracy and the Farmer-Labor Party politi-
cians against the orga~nizat2'on of a Labor Party and against
the Labor Party policies of the Communist Party of which
he was then a member. Now, when the Communist Party
concentrates on building the ﬁrm proletarian base (in the
unions and in the shops and among the unemployed) upon
which alone, as experience has shown, a broad Labor Party
organized from below can come into existence without the
danger of its becoming the tail end of reformist and
bourgeois Farmer-Labor politicians, the same Salut-
sky-Hardman, this time in company with Muste, proceeds

83

 

again to collaborate with the A. F. of L. bureaucracy and
the Farmer-Labor politicians to oppose the line of the
Communist Party. Only now, having “learned” from ex-
perience, he and Muste are using the very Labor Party
slogan for this purpose, for the purpose of obstructing the
radicalization of the masses andof steering this radicaliza-
tion into Farmer-Labor channels. The Comintern has
helped the Amercian workers and their Communist Party
to expose and ﬁght against this and similar “Left”
maneuvers of the reformists; it has helped and is helping
to build organized proletarian strength and -to unite this

4 strength with the exploited toiling ‘farmers under working

class leadership.

With Leninism as its guide, the Communist Party of the
United States is ﬁghting for the organization of the alliance
between the workers, toiling farmers, and Negroes under
the hegemony of the proletariat, concentrating on develop-
ing the working class, -politically and organizationally,-as
the true leader of this alliance. Can the American class-
conscious workers and militant toiling farmers reproach
the Comintern for thus guiding the American Communists
and the struggling ‘masses of the United States? Can they
object to the American Communists accepting and follow-
ing out this advice? No, they cannot and do not. Only
Muste, Hardman and Co. raise such objections and this
they do because the Yankee imperialists do it.

We comelto a milestone of Comintern leadership in the
United States that has been especiallyyfruitful in making
the ﬁght for proletarian internationalism alive and real in
projecting the liberating mission of the American prole-
tariat in a most concrete and telling manner. We refer
here to the Communist program for Negro liberation. It was

84

 

no accident that this was the problem—-the Negro problem
in. the United States—tha-t it took the revolutionary work-
ers of America the longest, in point of time, to become
aware of and to ﬁnd a solution for. Bourgeois ideology, the
“white prejudices” of the old slave market, had poisoned
the minds, not alone of the backward strata of the toilers.
but also the most advanced sections. And thus we ﬁnd
that the Left Wing of the Socialist Party which formed the
Communist Party somehow “overlooked” the national-
revolutionary signiﬁcance of the Negro liberation struggles.
And even when the American Communists had ﬁnally
begun to grapple with the_ Negro question in a Leninist
way, starting practical mass work to organize the white
and Negro toilers to struggle for Negro rights, there still
was considerable hesitation and confusion among the
weaker elements of the Communist movement to project
boldly the full Leninist solution of the problem.

Once more came the “outside” inﬂuence of the Com-
intern; and what did it say? It said that the struggle against
discrimination and for Negro rights is a revolutionary
struggle for the national liberation of the Negroes, that we
must ﬁght for complete Negro equality, and that in the
Black Beltthe full realization of this demand requires the
ﬁght for the national self-determination of the Negroes in-
cluding the right of separation from the United States and

the organization of an independent state. Furthermore, it »

was the interpretation of Leninism and its application to
the United States as made by the Comintern that showed the
American Communists that the agrarian revolution in the
Black Belt, where the Negro masses are mostly peasants and
semi-serfs, is the basis of the national-liberation movement
and that this movement is one of the allies of the American

85

 

proletariat in the struggle for the dictatorship of the pro-
letariat. The Lovestone renegades advocate_ the bourgeois_

theory that capitalist development itself, the “industrial-
ization of the South,” will solve the Negro question. The
Communist Party—following the lead of the Comintern-
says that only the national-revolutionary movement of the
Negroes, as an organic part and ally of the proletarian revo-
lution, will solve the Negro question. From this point of
view, the American Communists are able to expose the
Muste-Hardman position on this question as bourgeois
liberalism in words and Yankee white chauvinism in deeds.

M7 ill the Negro workers, farmers, and city poor consider
the Comintern advice on the Negro question as “outside
dictation”? No. They will, as they actually do, receive this
advice with outstretched arms and will continue in ever
larger masses to rally around the Communist Party as the
leader of the liberation ﬁght. And will the white workers,
those belonging to the dominating nationality in the
United States bu-t who are already awake to their true
interests, will they perhaps resent this advice as “outside
dictation”? No. Some of these class-conscious white workers
may still hesitate because they are as yet not completely
free from the bourgeois curse of white. chauvinism, but
none of them will say that this advice is not in the best
interests of the Ameri-can working class and of all exploited.

Let us now cast just a glance (space does not permit
more than that) at still another “dictation” from the Com-
intern—-the advice to the American Communists and to the
revolutionary trade union movement to make demands for
unemployment insurance one of the major issues of. the
class struggle. Not that_the American Communists were not
aware of the importance of this demand, but (for a time)

86

 

they had not managed, for various reasons, to project this

demand into the mass struggles in a really effective way.
The Comintern began to stress this issue long before the
outbreak of the economic crisis with its 17,ooo,ooo fully

unemployed. Seeing the permanent unemployed army of

over 4,000,000 workers in the years of “prosperity,” and
foreseeing the end of relative capitalist stabilization which
would catastrophically increase unemployment, as it did,
the Comintern undertook -to prepare the proletarian van-
guard, the Communist Party, and through it the whole
working class for effective struggle against unemployment.

The Communist Party, guided by the Comintern, even-
tually succeeded in making this demand, together with the
demand for immediate relief to the unemployed, a major
issue in the class struggle of the United States. And it is
indisputable that whatever relief was “granted” -to the
workers, through governmental agencies and otherwise, was
a result mainly of the struggles initiated by the Communist
Party and the revolutionary ‘trade union movement. Fur-
thermore, these struggles had a powerful revolutionizing
effect upon wide masses of workers. V/Vill the unemployed
American workers, who know these facts, as well as the
class-conscious employed workers, resent this “interference”
of the Comintern in American aﬂiairs? No, they will not;
they will say: if this is what Comintern leadership means,
we are all for it, despite the chauvinistic “Americanisms”
of the Right and “Left” social-fascists and their renegade
companions. C

And lastly——the liquidation of the factional situation in
the Communist Party. It is on_this, more than anything else,
that the Muste—Hardman outﬁt, led by the Lovestone rene-
gades and the Trotskyist counter-revolutionaries, choose to

OF THE EIGHTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE UNITED STATES

Communist Party, it is our task to bring to life our_

IN CELEBRATING the eighteenth anniversary of the

Party’s history: its origin, its struggles for the working
class and for the people, its setbacks and achievements.
We should make the membership of the Party, and the
widest circles of our people, conscious of the fact that our
Party stems from the ﬁrst Marxian groups in this country,
which played such an important role in the birthand or-
ganization of the American labor movement, that we stem
from the groups of the First International of Marx and
Engels, which inscribed a glorious page in the struggle

against slavery and for democracy that was led by Abraham -

Lincoln.
We should make the people conscious of the fact that in
our Party are embodied the best revolutionary and demo-

I cratic traditions of the country, of the working class.
And as we come nearer to our own day, to the time when p

i illustrate the “outside dictation” and interference of the

Communist International. Well, the facts speak for them-
selves. By the early summer of 1919, the factional cancer

that had been spreading to the Vitals of the Communist

Party for many years was beginning to threaten the‘ most
serious consequences. A break-up of the Party into various
pieces with some of them getting switched into the channels
of “Left” reformism, others getting tangled up in some
hopeless sectarian nooks, while still others being caught
in the nets of Trotskyism, seemed almost inevitable, if a
quick and radical end was not made to the factional situa-
tion. And remember: these were the dangers confronting
the Communist Party at the very threshold of the economic
crisis, that is, at the time when the American working class
needed and was going to need this Party more than ever
in the history of the American class struggle.

But this disaster did not happen. And why? Because the
Comintern spoke to the American Party with authority and
wisdom; in so speaking, in pointing out the dangers and the
way to avoid them, the Comintern released the initiative
and creative activity of the overwhelming majority of the
Party, the initiative that had _become paralyzed during the

1 years of factional ﬁght; and on the basis of this ‘initiative

of the Party membership, with the help of this power, the
Party was able to cleanse itself of the hopelessly factional
elements and of the Right and “Left” opportunist group-
ings that went with the factions and thus laid the basis
for the subsequent uniﬁcation of the Party and its fresh
start on the ﬁeld of revolutionary masswork.

The Comintern did “interfere”; there can be do doubt
of that. And it is fortunate thatit did. And if you wish to
know what precisely it was that ﬁred the imagination and

88

 

enthusiasm of the membership and sympathizers of the
Communist Party of the United States to endorse and follow
out the advice of the Comintern in making an end to fac-
tionalism and in cleansing itself of the Lovestone opportu-
nists and the conciliators, read once more Stalin’s speeches
on the question. We must quote at least this:

“I think, comrades, that the American Communist Party is
one of those few Communist Parties in the world upon which
history had laid tasks of a decisive character from the point of
view of the world revolutionary movement. You all know very
well the strength and power of American imperialism. Many now
think [that was spoken in May, 1929] that the general crisis of
world capitalism will not affect America. That, of course, is not
true. It is entirely untrue, comrades. The crisis of world capital-
ism is developing with increasing rapidity and cannot but affect
American capitalism. The 3,000,000 now unemployed in America
are the first swallows indicating the ripening of the economic crisis
in America. The sharpening antagonisms between America and
England, the struggle for markets and raw materials and, ﬁnally,
the colossal growth of armaments—that is the second portent of
the approaching crisis. I think the moment is not far off when
a revolutionary crisis will develop in America. And when a revo-
lutionary crisis develops in America, that will be the beginning
of the end of world capitalism as a whole. It is essential that the
American Communist Party should be capable of meeting that
historical moment fully prepared and of assuming the leadership
of the impending class struggle in America. Every effort and every
means must be employed in preparing for that, comrades. For that
end the American Communist Party must be improved and Bol- 4
shevized. For that end we must work for the complete liquidation
of factionalism and deviations in the Party. For that end we must
work for the re-establishment of unity in the Communist Party of
America. For that end we must work in order to forge real revo-
lutionary cadres and a real revolutionary leadership of the
proletariat, capable of leading the many millions of the
American working class toward the revolutionary class struggle.

89

For that end all personal factors and factional considerations must
he laid aside and the revolutionary education of the working
class of America be placed above all.”

PROLETARIAN INTERNATIONALISNI AS AGAINST
IMPERIALIST CHAUVINISM

For the class-conscious American workers, but especially
for its younger generation, there is great signiﬁcance in the
fact that the two militant working class ﬁghters in the labor

movement of the United States in this country——the impe- r

rialist era—the two men who represent most fully the best
and most advanced achievements of the American working
class, Ruthenberg and Foster, that both of these became

the builders of the Communist Party, the builders and fol-H

lowers of the Communist International.

Ruthenberg we have lost altogether too soon; March 2
of this years marks the seventh anniversay of his death;
but the value of his Work in founding our Party, in point-
ing the way to the Communist International for other
thousands of workers, and in guiding our movement for
many years, this will neverbe lost. Now our movement has
Foster as the leader. And while he is temporarily disabled

‘by terriﬁc exertion in the class struggle, Comrade Foster’s

power of attraction to our Party, the power that has
brought and will continue to bring in-to our ranks and to
the Comintern all that is militant, honest and creative in
the American working class, this power has never weakened
but is growing stronger with the sharpening of the class
struggles. .

(Ruthenberg and Foster came to the Communist Inter-
national because in the proletarian internationalism of
Lenin's teachings, which guide the Comintern work-, both

90

 

had found the solution of all those problems and tasks that
confronted them and the American working class in the
present epoch. Ruthenberg’s experiences had been acquired
in the Socialist Party, chieﬂy on the political ﬁeld; Foster’s,
on the other hand, were acquired mainly on the trade
union ﬁeld. The revolutionary instinct and consciousness
of Ruthenberg could not but rebel against the narrow par-
liamentary limitations of Socialist Party politics; while the
revolutionary consciousness of Foster, and" the logic of the
great economic struggles which he had organized and led,
could not but make him rebel against the narrow “econo-
mism” of Gompers as well as of anarcho-syndicalism. Both,
Ruthenberg and Foster, were therefore led to Leninism
and its conception of a “new type” of Party as the only
ideology that offered a revolutionary and proletarian solu-
tion for their problems. And these were the problems of
the American working class and its revolutionary vanguard.

The coming together of these two revolutionists and their
followers into one working class Party marked a historic
event of the ﬁrst magnitude. The meaning of this event
was that, for the ﬁrst time in the history of the American
working class, there came to an end the traditional separa-
tion between the advanced revolutionary elements of the
trade unions, on the one hand, and the revolutionary ele-
ments of the Socialist (political-parliamentary) Party, on
the other. This traditional ‘separation was perhaps the
largest single factor that had retarded, in the past, the com-
ing into life in the United States of a proletarian revolu-
tionary Party of the Leninist kind. Ruthenberg and Foster
started the process of liquidating this separation by com-
ing together in the building of the Communist Party in the
United States. To this they came by the inexorable logic

91

 

of the class struggle in the United States and the point
at which they met and joined hands was Leninism and
the Communist International. . .
In the ﬁfteen years of its existence the Comintern has
grown into a true world party. It has reached the high
stage where all “Communist Parties are carrying out one
single line of the Comintern,” a stage where all “Commu-
nist Parties are united by the Executive Committee of the
Communist International into a single centralized World
Party which the Second International never had and never
will have.” (Piatnitsky, Speech at the Thirteenth Plenum
of the E.C.C.AI.) In this lies the main strength of the world
revolution and the guarantee of its inevitable victory. It is
this that makes possible, for the ﬁrst time in the history
-of the world, the effective carrying out of a world revolu-
tionary strategy, the only road to victory over capitalism.
And it is in Comrade Stalin, since Lenin's death, that this
strategy has found the greatest formulator, interpreter, and
organizer. With the deepest pride in this achievement, the
class-conscious workers of the United States, the militant
farmers and revolutionary Negroes, will celebrate the Fif-
teenth Anniversary of the Comintern. It is with the same
feeling of pride that -they realize that they belong to a
world party together with the glorious" Party of the Soviet
Union; that they belong to a world party which is daily
guided by such proved leaders as Manuilsky, Kuusinen,
Thaelmann and Piatnitsky; and that by building -the revo-

lutionary movement in the United States" we are also build-‘

ing the world power of the proletariatfor the victory of“ the
world revolution. .
