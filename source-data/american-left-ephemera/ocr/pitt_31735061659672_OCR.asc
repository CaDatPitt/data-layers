of private capital.

Where is our country headed? How long can we live
in an atmosphere of raging ‘inflation and growing
numbers of permanently unemployed, of systematic,
degrading racism and of discrimination against
women? How can the political and economic domina-
tion of the monopolies be broken? How can the
people’s goals of economic security, full equality, ex-
panded democracy and social progress be won?

The Communist Party believes:

—that it is necessary and possible to break the vici-
ous cycle in which the rich get richer while the work-
ing people must struggle to make ends meet;

—that the basic inherent contradiction of capitalism
is that most of our productive facilities and financial
institutions are owned and controlled by less than two
per cent of the population;

—that the drive for corporate profits is the source of
most of the social evils that beset our society.

What then must be done? Capitalism must be re-
placed by a system in which the basic means of produc-
tion and distribution are publicly owned and demo-
cratically controlled. Then they will serve as a means
to satisfy the needs of the people and not for the en-
richment of the few.

This program outlines the course for today's strug-
gles, advancing toward tomorrow's goal of socialism.

 

 

II. CAPITALISM:
PROFITS BEFORE PEOPLE

The desire of our people for a decent and secure
standard of living is in conﬂict with the capitalist sys-
tem under which we live.

Capitalism denies the great majority of our people
the reality of the American dream of “life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.” This is because the driving
force of capitalism is and can only be the unending
accumulation of private wealth, of the greatest corp-
orate profits, not satisfaction of people's needs.

The colossal U.S. industrial and financial apparatus
on which the life of the entire nation is based is in the
grip of a handful of private corporations. These giant
corporations, in turn, are in the hands of a small and
ever-shrinking group of fabulously wealthy and pow-
erful monopoly capitalists. A

The corporations and their multi-millionaire owners
appropriate the tremendous wealth which is created by
the cooperative labor of millions. They deprive the rest
of the nation of the benefits which they should justly
derive from their toil.

Opposing them are the millions of workers whose
labor is the primary source of our national wealth. The
workers own no means of production. They have no
source of income beyond their own capacity to work,
their labor power. This they must sell in order to live.

Workers have jobs only so long as their labor is
profitable for their capitalist employers. Workers are
“profitable” because the value their labor creates is

9

l

 

 

  

  

 

greater than the wages they are paid. This additional
value created by the labor of the working class-
surplus value—is the real source of corporate profits,
dividends, interest and all other forms of unearned
income of the capitalist class. This surplus value is
extorted from the workers by the capitalists through
the process of exploitation. Exploitation is the essence
of the capitalist system.

The Class Struggle

The workers who must sell their labor power for
wages in order to live and the capitalists who buy their
labor power are the two basic economic classes in our
society. They are the exploited and the exploiters.

These two classes are in unending and irreconcilable
conflict. Their fundamental interests clash. The drive
for maximum profits is the cause of Big Business’ re-
lentless efforts to force down wages and speed up pro-
duction.

Far from having it easy and living “high off the hog,”
workers in the United States are subjected to intensive
exploitation. Our factories, mines and construction
sites are the scene of killing speedup and industrial
carnage. Elementary concern for workers’ health and
safety is brushed aside in the scramble for production.
What protective laws exist, the result of sustained
struggle by workers and their trade unions, are under
constant assault.

New, more efficient machinery embodying the latest

technology is continually introduced to grind out -

greater profits from the labor of each worker. Automa-
tion makes it possible for corporations to radically
increase production while sometimes simultaneously
closing plants and laying off workers, contributing to a
permanent pool of unemployed.

We are entering the age of the “chip-and-robot re-

10

 

volution.” Microelectronic chips are replacing more
production-line and office workers than any previous
technological innovation. This leads not to greater
economic and social well-being for workers, but to
growing insecurity and chronic unemployment.
Capitalists seek, with considerable success, to avoid

. the costs of the technological unemployment they

create. Therefore profits continue to soar, while social

' misery increases.

Science and technology are not the enemy. On the
contrary, they have the potential of making life easier
and more enjoyable. But for science and technology to
serve the interests of the people it is necessary to make
a corresponding change in the socio-economic
system—to make satisfaction of the people’s needs the
aim of production.

With the growth of productive capacity, a yawning
gap is continually recreated between the ability to pro-
duce and the purchasing power of the ultimate
consumers—workers in the first place. This inherent
contradiction of capitalist society makes recurrent
economic crises inevitable. With each cyclical eco-
nomic crisis, more unemployment, poverty and mass
misery are generated. Products pile up because con-
sumers can not afford to buy them. Factories, mines
and mills slow down and shut down. Unemployment
skyrockets, unemployment benefits run out, people
suffer. The machines that replace workers do not buy
the products they produce.

All this sharpens the class struggle-—the struggle
between exploiters and "exploited. Under capitalism,
growth of production and scientific advance aggra-
vate, rather than blunt, the class struggle.

The share of the national income skimmed off by the
biggest capitalists and their hangers-on rises steadily,
while the conditions of the workers lag further behind.

The capitalist system itself spurs each capitalist to

11

 

  

greater efforts with the threat of being extinguished or
swallowed up by even more powerful rivals. Smaller
and weaker companies are continually being driven to
the wall. Those that survive must expand.

Therefore, the working class is the special product of
the capitalist system. It is the one class that, in the face
of unceasing technical innovation and greater concen-
tration of capital, continues to grow in numbers.

Monopoly capital oppresses classes and social strata
other than the working class. It systematically elimi-
nates small business. The agribusiness octopus strang-
les family farmers, bankrupting hundreds of
thousands.

Monopoly corporations despoil our land in count-
less ways. They destroy the landscape, pollute land, air
and water, wantonly exploit our irreplaceable common
heritage of natural resources.

Increasingly, monopolies originally based in a
single industry take over companies in unrelated
fields, forming corporate galaxies called conglomer-
ates. ’

Special Role of the Working Class

The basic source of profit, wealth and power for the
capitalist class is the exploitation of workers in the
work places—at the point of production. his lies the
special position of the working class. I can not free
itself without ending this exploitation.

The enormous concentration of production and
ownership which underlies the development of
monopoly capitalism is paralleled by the concentra-
tion of workers in the giant industrial plants. This
enables the working class to acquire a sense of cohe-
sion and a degree of organization matched by no other
class confronting the monopolies.

The concentrated, cooperative and highly produc-

12

.tive labor which is characteristic of modern industry is
the basis for the special role of workers in big industry
as the most highly organized and conscious core of the
working class.

The ability to take united action at the point of pro-
duction places the working class in the strongest posi-

V tion to combat capitalist exploitation. As the main

creator of value, it is the decisive force for social prog-
ress. Without its brain and muscle not a single wheel
would turn.

The workers as a class are the strongest and most
consistent opponent of corporate domination. They are
in the best position to lead all other social strata vic-
timized by the Rockefellers, Morgans, DuPonts and
Fords in a united crusade for social justice.

The working class of the United States is composed

of men and women of many races and nationalities. But ,

regardless of differing origins, its members have com-
mon basic interests. Each of its components adds to the
class heritage their own experience of struggle against
economic, racial and national oppression.

The Labor Movement and Trade Unions

Workers know from bitter personal experience that

they can not win a one-on-one battle with a corporate .

employer. Organization is the fount of workers’ class
strength. And in the era of conglomerate and transna-
tional corporations, organization becomes even more
imperative.

Our working class has succeeded in creating a trade
union movement of many millions of members. This
achievement took decades of effort against the unre-
mitting opposition of open-shop employers. Through
really heroic struggle the labor movement has been
able to extract some important concessions and to pre-
vent workers from being forced into abject submission

13

  

  

to the corporate bosses.

But on this basic front of the class struggle, some of
the biggest battles lie ahead. The great majority of
workers remain unorganized. Many economic and so-
cial goals of the labor movement remain to be achieved.
Trade union rights to organize, bargain collectively
and to strike remain restricted. And what gains have
been made must be constantly safeguarded from reac-
tionary attacks.

And new times make new demands. In the battle
against state monopoly capitalism, it is necessary for
the trade unions to raise their sights from taking on
employers one by one to challenge the whole system of
capitalist exploitation. The class struggle extends be-
yond collective bargaining and the picket line to in-
clude political organization and the battle of ideas.

It is necessary to combat and overcome the poison of
racism, which is consciously used by employers to
divide and weaken labor’s ranks. To overcome the di-
visive inﬂuence of racism it is essential that the white
majority vigorously take up the fight for affirmative
action to put an end to injustice and inequality result-
ing from racial and national discrimination.

For Class-Struggle Trade Unionism

The trade unions are by nature instruments of class
struggle. They are living proof of the fact that workers
as a class can only progress by fighting against their
corporate employers.

Labor’s fighting capacity is undercut by “class
collaboration”—the doctrine that workers’ interests
can be advanced by serving the interests of the bosses.
The capitalists constantly strive to corrupt the leader-
ship of the labor movement materially and ideologi-
cally in order to get them to adopt class-
collaborationist policies.

14

 

  

In a society dominated by big capital, “class part-
nership” or “class peace” can only mean the subordi-
nation of the workers to the corporations. It is class
betrayal. — :

Reformism is another trend which weakens the

fighting capacity of the unions. Reformism accepts the

validity of exploitation and defends the capitalist
framework. It only presents demands which do not
basically challenge that system. But defense of the
capitalist system conﬂicts with defense of the workers’
interests.

Communists strive to win reforms which benefit the
people. But they reject the notion that such reforms
within the framework of capitalism can ever be suffi-
cient. Communists are for reforms, but they are op-
posed to reformism. A

Some unions keep militant workers from being
elected to leadership by invoking “anti-Communist”
clauses in their bylaws and constitutions. This is an
instance of curtailing a basic trade union right-—the
right to freely elect leadership—under pressure from
the employers and government. Experience has shown
how dearly the labor movement has paid for the purge
of its most committed and able leaders during the cold
war. Such exclusion only weakens labor and
strengthens the hand of the bosses.

Despite limitations, the trade unions are the most
powerful champions of social, economic and political
progress. They alone put limits on the rate of exploita-
tion. They defend our democratic institutions.

Strengthening the trade union movement is a crucial
responsibility of all progressive and democratic forces.

Communists stand for working-class and trade
union unity, which are preconditions for winning ef-
fective working-class economic and political power.

The rejection of policies of class collaboration and
~the development of policies and tactics based on class

15

  

 
  

struggle are essential for a strong trade union move-
ment. This requires a struggle against bureaucracy and
corruption. To combat the inﬂuence of class collabora-
tion and to build a solid grassroots base, union mem-
bers organize rank-and-file forms of organization-
caucuses, ad hoc committees, etc. The aim of such
groups is to strengthen the unions, to mobilize grass-
roots support for policies and actions of struggle, to
help keep the unions on the path of class struggle and
militancy.

In the creative development of program and policy,
in launching new initiatives and in solving new prob-
lems, Left-thinking workers and Communists, in par-
ticular, have been and are indispensable. The Left
forces contribute an advanced class understanding of
the problems the labor movement faces.

To help unify the labor movement and to give a lead
in struggles, it is necessary for the Left to find special
organized Left forms. Such forms are a necessary and
legitimate part of the trade union structure.

The Left forces can be an inﬂuence in determining
trade union policies only if they work with other trade
unionists who have not yet reached the same level of
understanding. A working unity between the Left and
such Center forces is essential. Such unity is necessary
to win the Center forces away from the inﬂuence of the
Right-wing practitioners of class collaboration.

The Communist Party is committed to strengthening
and rallying the trade union movement and all workers
for the.achievement of labor’s progressive goals. It is
proud of its long record of fighting for the unity of the
labor movement and the working class based on
policies of class struggle, opposition to racism and all
forms of discrimination. No political organization has
done more for the organization of unorganized workers
and to mobilize support for union struggles.

  

16

The Inﬂuence of the Working Class

The influence and power of the working class are not
measured by numbers alone, but particularly by the
size, class consciousness and effectiveness of its or-
ganized sector.

The organization of the unorganized remains a cru-
cial question for the trade union movement. It is an
especially critical problem because for three decades
the percentage of workers who are trade union mem-
bers has been declining.

This points up the multiple obstacles labor must
overcome. The corporate giants defy collective bar-
gaining laws, blackmail whole communities with
threats of plant shutdowns, fire union activists,
employ both thugs and sophisticated anti-labor “con-
sultants” in their efforts to prevent unionization and to
weaken or destroy existing unions.

The forces of state monopoly capitalism spend mil-
lions in political-ideological labor-baiting campaigns.
Democratic and Republican Congresses have passed
and presidents have signed various anti-labor laws,
including authorization for states to adopt “right to
work” laws. Supreme Court decisions restricting the
right to organize and strike have their effect.

The capitalists invent ever new forms of class col-
laboration. They have involved such dead-end policies
as the buying of corporate stocks, labor banking, the
“social contract,” and token representation on cor-
porate boards. Another scheme is called “the quality of
work life.” It is a plan to make workers falsely believe
that they have real decision-making power on the shop

ﬂoor.
Full-time trade union leaders deserve salaries in

keeping with their role as representatives of the na-
tion’s organized workers. But with the adoption of
policies of class collaboration, in some cases these

salaries have risen far beyond the wages of even the
most skilled workers. Such salaries insulate union of-
ficials from the problems of their members and make
them complacent.

The labor movement can achieve greater power and
1W influence to the degree that it frees itself from the
 bonds of class partnership and the divisiveness of ra- «
cism.

‘ Labor must add millions to its organized ranks and
 develop greater class consciousness and unity.

It is crucial for labor to assert its political indepen-
1» dence and confront its corporate enemies as a class in

p. the political arena. ‘
To the degree all these are achieved the working
., class will fulfill its destiny as the leading and most
7» dynamic force in the anti-monopoly alliance of the
l: p people.

;; . What Communists Bring to the Labor Movement

Communists bring a sense of broad social responsi-
bility and political vision to the labor movement. They
1 :1 enhance its great moral authority. And they strengthen
its ability to attract other sectors of the population to its
~; w historically-destined cause.

Communists bring the rich experience of their Party
H ‘T in advancing the organization and well-being of the
 § American working class. They are dedicated and in-
av % corruptible fighters.

if Above all, Communists bring the vital elements of
M class and socialist consciousness into the labor move-
 ment. These are a firm base from which to repel the
V M political and ideological weapons employed by the
3 U capitalist class to weaken or divide the working class.
‘ it The Communists’ outlook shows how to harmonize the
j .| . immediate goals of the trade unions—improved wages
" l! T and conditions-—with the long-range goals of
working-class political power and socialism.

  111. THE ENEMY:
  STATE MONOPOLY CAPITALISM

The monstrous power of Big Business blocks the
path of social progress. Over the years, Big Business
has taken over or destroyed most of its small com-
petitors. The resulting monopolies dominate every
major industry.

The power of money, too, is tremendously concen-
trated in a narrow group of banks, insurance and in-
vestment houses. Concentrated shareholdings, inter-
locking directorates, an intense network of loans and
other business relations link - in fact, merge — indus-
trial, commercial and money capital into a single web
of high finance — into finance capital.

The corporate executives of finance capital shuttle
back and forth between corporate boardrooms and
government posts, federal, state and local. Representa-
tives of finance capital assume key government posts
to "use the state apparatus to serve their special profit-
making interests. The powers of government deployed
on behalf of Big Business are constantly expanding.
They have become so essential to corporate capitalist
rule that the system under which we live today may
well be called state monopoly capitalism.

The corporate tentacles also reach into developing
countries as well as developed capitalist lands. The
biggest U.S.-based and -owned corporations are multi-
national in their operations. They seek to exploit the
natural resources and low-wage labor of the develop-
ing countries and the skilled labor and large consumer

19

  

   

markets of the developed countries. This export of
capital, production and technology to other countries
aggravates U.S. unemployment and other economic
ills. '

The Face of Imperialism

To most people, “imperialism” conjures up an
image of empire based on colonial possessions. That
image is largely outdated. Modern imperialism is
marked by the growth of monopolies and multina-
tional corporations and the domination of finance cap-
ital. Imperialism today maintains a higher level of eco-
nomic plunder abroad than ever, even when it lacks the
old colonial trappings.

At the same time, many nations and peoples are still
kept in outright colonial bondage; witness, for exam-
ple, U.S. rule over Puerto Rico and other islands in the
Caribbean and the Pacific.

Whether by classic or neo-colonial means, U.S. im-
perialism is the most powerful and ruthless extractor of
huge profits from other countries and peoples in world
history. ‘

Within the United States, the largest monopolies and
banks have transformed the government into their pri-
vate political instrument. They seek an ever-tighter
grip on government at all levels. They use this political
power to guarantee favorable domestic markets, profit-
able investments, various kinds of subsidies, tax
loopholes and the public underwriting of research for
their benefit. They reorder government financing for
their private enrichment and power. Like leeches, they
suck profits from the industrial and urban centers of
our land, pushing our cities to the brink of bankruptcy.
Neighborhoods crushed under the weight of this
exploitation are steadily deteriorating into huge slums.
Congress and state legislatures pass anti-labor laws

20

 

whileassisting the enrichment -of the monopolies.
Courts enjoin strikes while eroding. citizens’ rights.
The government structure and the corporate
monopolies have become so intertwined that the state
apparatus has become a decisive instrument for the
transfer of an ever-greater proportion of socially-
produced wealth from the working people to the
monopolies. This, too, is state monopoly capitalism. It
is, in fact, a welfare state for the super-rich.

Military Industrial Complex

The most sinister component of state monopoly
capitalism is the military industrial complex. This is
the combination of military brass with financiers and
corporate directors whose companies profit from the
trade in weapons. The characters of this netherworld
rotate between posts in the Pentagon, the Defense and
State Departments and the armaments industries. They
wangle lush contracts for the manufacture and sale of
thelatest death-dealing technology. They are the most
ardent advocates of the nuclear arms race.

Incorporated in the military-industrial complex is a
network of secret and semi-secret government agen-
cies. These form an “invisible government” beyond
the reach of the voters: the National Security Council,
the CIA, the FBI, the Pentagon and select Congres-
sional and White House committees whose schemes
and activities are shielded from public scrutiny.

The lFight for Peace

. The drive for control of resources and profitable
spheres of investment gives capitalism an inherently
aggressive, warlike character. This presents the basic
threat to world peace. The capitalist drive for world
domination threatens nuclear disaster. Capitalism

21

  

 

 

spawns the arms race, squandering trillions of dollars.

The existence of nuclear arsenals of thousands of
warheads, each equivalent to millions of tons of con-
ventional explosives, creates a qualitatively new threat
to humanity. The simple truth is that, once unleashed,
a nuclear exchange would escalate inexorably into
total war. Literally in a matter of minutes, civilization
as we know it would be obliterated. Yet U.S. strategic
planners still seek scenarios by which they could wage
and win a nuclear war. This is the dangerous insanity
of a dying class. U.S. Communists, like all genuine
peace forces, urge that existing stockpiles of weapons
be progressively eliminated by international agree-
ment.

U.S. imperialism is not monolithic. Limited differ-
ences exist in its ranks, particularly over whether to
pursue futile attempts to “win” the arms race or
whether to accept detente. Detente—the relaxing of
tensions—is based on the reality of approximate mili-
tary parity between the United States and the Soviet
Union. A serious strategy for winning the struggle for
peace must take all such divisions within state-
monopoly-capitalist ranks into account. In moments of
crisis, they can tip the balance against disaster if used
to timely advantage by pro-peace, anti-monopoly
forces.

U.S. foreign policy is designed to secure areas of the
globe for exploitation by the multinational corpora-
tions. Areas in which the multinationals can operate
without hindrance—even if they are ruled by the
bloodiest tyrannies-—are considered part of the “Free
World.” U.S. imperialism views world socialism and
the national liberation movements as the main obsta-
cles to its drive for profits.

Only the corporate monopolies benefit from the
policies and actions of U.S. imperialism. Wherever
they gain a foothold, the multinationals strive to keep

22

 

wages belowpoverty levels, to deny health and safety
measures, to forbid trade unions. Their huge profits
escape virtually untaxed. The companies then seek to
“import” these conditions to the U.S.

Our people pay through the nose to finance the
trillion-dollar military budgets that back up policies of
imperialist aggression. While our cities crumble, the
U.S. government finances missile bases, airfields and
naval facilities all over the world.

Therefore, the struggle to curb U.S. imperialism is
literally a struggle to save our nation and the world
from catastrophe.

Peaceful Coexistence

The modern world is divided into two rival social
systems—capitalism and socialism. From its birth in
191 7, the Soviet state proclaimed the policy of peaceful
coexistence and peaceful competition between the two
systems. This policy follows from the nature of
socialist society, which contains no vested economic
interests which profit from preparations for or waging
of war. On the contrary, its greatest need, like that of
working people everywhere, is for a peaceful environ-
ment for constructive labor.

While imperialism has repeatedly unleashed war
upon the world, socialism seeks to direct the contest
between the two opposing systems into peaceful eco-
nomic, ideological and political channels. Socialism
consistently champions detente and the easing of in-
ternational tensions.

Detente and disarmament will not, however,
develop spontaneously. The working-class and peace
movements must oppose each specific militarist ad-
venture. Though the war lobby under capitalism is
very powerful, it offers no realistic solutions to any
contemporary problems. It is becoming increasingly

23

  
 
  
 

 

  

isolated. Detente and disarmament can be won.

U.S. imperialism seeks to camouﬂage its own ag-
gressive behavior by shrilly denouncing a mythical
“Soviet threat.” This is the tactic of the “Big Lie”
developed by Hitler. It provides a fig-leaf to cover the
naked instigation of reactionary military coups, the
propping up of reactionary regimes and the “destabili-
zation” of democratic governments. Everywhere, U.S.
imperialism seeks to obstruct and roll back the prog-
ress of other countries toward genuine national inde-
pendence and socialism.

Imperialism has an international system of reac-
tionary military and political alliances. To the interna-
tional collaboration of forces of reaction, the Com-
munist Party counterposes the principle of working-
class internationalism—solidarity of working and op-
pressed peoples around the globe based on their fun-
damental identity of interests.

World Transition to Socialism

The hallmarks of our time are the emergence of
socialism as a world system, the sweeping advance of
the national liberation movements in formerly col-
onized countries and the upsurge of working—class and
democratic movements in the capitalist lands.

Society is in the midst of an unprecedented transi-
tion. This world revolutionary process is propelled by
objective laws. The struggles for national liberation
and socialism are just and their victory is inevitable.

Socialism is a historic necessity which will ulti-
mately prevail worldwide. But it can not be established
from without; it can neither be exported nor imported.
In each capitalist country, urgent class interests impel
the working class and its allies to undertake the strug-
gle for socialism.

With each passing day it becomes more obvious that

24

capitalism has outlived its usefulness. Modern produc-
tion is a highly social venture requiring the coopera-
tion of ever-greater numbers of workers, even across
national boundaries. New developments in science
and technology propel this trend. The confiscation of
the fruits of the people's creative labor by corporate
thieves is increasingly intolerable. Growing anti-
corporate, anti-imperialist and socialist consciousness
is the foundation for popular struggles in capitalist and
developing countries. This historically new combina-
tion of popular forces possesses the power to deny
imperialism its former ability to determine the course
of world events.

State Monopoly Capitalism—-—Foe of Democracy

Real political power in our country, the control of
executive, legislative and judicial branches of gov-
ernment, as well as the mass media, is in the hands of
Big Business and its representatives. The concentra-
tion of wealth in the nation is paralleled by a concen-
tration of political power. To run for high office it is
usually necessary either to be a millionaire or to have
millionaire backers.

Fearing even limited democracy, the monopolists
who dominate the economy and politics of our nation
seek in a thousand ways to choke off avenues of popu-
lar democratic expression.

While they pay lip service to democracy, they con-
nive to block democratic access to the mass media and

_ to the ballot. They seek to hamstring the right of labor

to organize and strike. They savagely restrict the rights
of the Afro-American people and other oppressed
nationa_li_ties.

Ruling-class ideologues speak openly of the “un-
governability” of democracy, reflecting their basic
contempt for it and their readiness to junk it and rule by

25

 
  
 

 

  

naked force if necessary.

The Communist Party has always fought to maintain
and extend democracy so that the working class and
the people might more effectively inﬂuence the na-
tion’s economic and political life.

Communists champion rights which go far beyond
capitalist norms. These include the right to a job at a
living wage, the right to decent housing, to high-
quality public education, the right to free, comprehen-
sive health care, to public mass transportation. Com-
munists support the full equality of all races and
nationalities and the equality of women in every aspect
of economic, political and social life. Communists be-
lieve in the right of the people to be the owners of the
nation's productive wealth.

While advocating these advanced democratic rights,
Communists recognize the important distinction be-
tween fascism and capitalist democracy, and are the
staunchest anti-fascist fighters. Sections of Big Busi-
ness encourage and finance ultra-Right, fanatically ra-
cist and fascist movements. Fascism is a qualitatively
different form of class rule under which the
monopolies destroy democratic—including even
bourgeois democratic—institutions and abolish fun-
damental rights. Fascist movements, such as the Ku
Klux Klan, John Birch Society, neo-nazis and others,
are maintained as shock troops against the people and
as a possible alternative to the present forms of class
rule if the supremacy of the financial oligarchy is too
strongly challenged.

The defeat of ultra-Right, neo-fascist forces is indis-
pensable to social progress.

The KKK and neo-nazi groups advocate and practice
terrorism and violence against people on the basis of
their race, nationality or religion. The constitutional
rights of the intended victims and democracy itself can
best be safeguarded by outlawing such groups.

IV. FOR FREEDOM AND EQUALITY:
END RACISM

Class exploitation is everywhere the essence of
capitalism. U.S. capitalism wields a special weapon to

‘wring superprofits from the working class: racism.

Some 50 million of our people are oppressed, dis-
criminated against, segregated and exploited on the
basis of their race or nationality.

The U.S. ruling class considers this system of op-
pression both an instrument of added profits and a vital
component of its political and ideological domination
of the nation. »

Racial oppression is bone and marrow of class

exploitation. That is why defenders of the system of V

capitalist exploitation poison the bloodstream of our
nation with ideas of “white supremacy.” While di-
rected mainly against the Afro-American people, racist
ideas and practices oppress other peoples as well.

Because both racism and class oppression are inhe-
rent in capitalist exploitation, a special link exists be-
tween the two. This connection grows stronger as in-
creasing numbers of Afro-Americans and other nation-
ally oppressed workers enter the working class. There-
fore, the struggle against racism and national oppres-
sion is inextricably intertwined with the class struggle.
It is inseparable from other democratic struggles.

Racism is ugly, immoral and unjust by any yardstick.
That is reason enough to fight it.

But it is also true-though many do not realize it-
that most white Americans pay a price for racism.

1. TOWARD A BETTER FUTURE

This is the program of the Communist Party, USA. It
is a statement both of the Communist Party's funda-
mental principles and aims and of its views on how
best to defend and promote the rights and welfare of
the people of our country.

This program sets forth the essential steps on the
road ahead—to the people’s complete victory over
state monopoly capitalism and the establishment of a
socialist United States. » .

The Communist Party has been a force for peace and
progress on the U.S. political scene for over sixty years.
It is composed of workers, trade unionists, profession-
als, intellectuals, cultural workers, farmers—working
men and women of all ages, races and nationalities.

The Communist Party is a party of our working class.
Its supreme reason for being is to defend and advance
the interests of the working class, both immediate and
long-range. That is why it is an implacable opponent of
the system of capitalistiexploitation and all its ugly
consequences.

The Communist Party defends the people’s demo-
cratic rights and works for their extension. It actively
combats all forms of racial, national and sex discrimi-
nation, inequality and oppression. It also works for the
satisfaction of the special needs of women, youth,
seniors and oppressed nationalities and others who
suffer from the rule of Big Business.

The Communist Party advocates peaceful coexis-
tence of nations with different social systems and

1

  

 

   

Therefore the struggle against racism is vital to their
interests:
‘ Workers divided all receive lower wages. V

The corporations are able to tighten the screw of
exploitation an additional turn on white workers when
they are permitted to tighten it two turns on Black
workers.

People divided pay higher taxes and utility rates.

And a divided people are no match for an enemy-
the monopoly capitalist class—-that is united.

The struggle against racist ideas and practices, there-
fore, unites and advances the interests of all racial and
national fractions of our working class. It concentrates
the maximum strength of the people against the enor-
mous power of monopoly capital.

The Communist Party supports passage of legisla-
tion making acts of racism subject to severe penalties.

Afro-American Liberation

The thirty million Afro-American people are a na-
tional minority subject to national, racial and class
oppression. Capitalist rule has spun a web of restric-
tions depriving Afro-Americans and other oppressed
nationalities of equal rights in the economic, political
and other domains. The monopolies reap immense
superprofits from the labor and ghettoization of the
Afro-American working people. '

Scientific and economic advances alone do not
guarantee that there will be greater equality of Afro-
Americans. On the contrary, without a struggle for the
democratic distribution of the benefits of science, such
advances can increase joblessness and otherwise ag-
gravate national oppression. T

The struggle for Afro-Americans’ full political, eco-
nomic and social equality lies at the heart of the striv-
ing for democracy, justice and social progress for all

28

working people in our country. Afro-Americans are an
integral strand in the national fabric, and have made
profound contributions to the economy, social life and
culture of the American people from our nation’s ear-
liest days.

The national aspect of the oppression of the Afro-
American people manifests itself in the fact that all
social strata of Black people are subject to deprivation
of basic rights and to the humiliation of racism.

The overwhelming majority of the Afro-American
people are working-class. This class composition im-

‘ parts important class content to the basically national

character of the struggle. The working-class sector,
made up of industrial workers in proportions greater
than the general population, binds the national libera-
tion cause of Black people to that of the working class
as a whole.

Black workers play a dual role: one, as leaders of the
Afro-American liberation struggle; two, in the struggle
of the working class as a whole. This helps to cement
the alliance of the national liberation and working-
class causes. Historically, the most reliable, powerful
and advanced ally of the working class has been the
Afro-American people.

Affirmative action programs in work, housing, edu-
cation and all other areas of life are essential to guaran-
tee the achievement of real equality. Afﬁrmative action
includes special measures to improve housing,
schools, hospitals, employment opportunities and
other essentials in areas of Black majority. Such pro-
grams will also consolidate the unity and strength of
the nation’s working-class and anti-monopoly forces.
Without significant gains in the fight for equality there
can be no prospect of working-class or anti-monopoly
victory.

Further, it is necessary to fight for the right of major-
ity rule in all political districts with a Black majority. In

29

 
   

as,

M

 w

I W;

 

other areas, Black people should have at least propor-
tional representation in government positions, elective
and appointive. The achievement of full political rep-
resentation requires elimination of gerrymandering.
The inclusion of Afro-Americans in all levels of trade
union leadership will speed the achievement of these
democratic goals even as it advances the cause of mili-

tant class-struggle trade unionism.
The Communist Party, whose membership reflects

the full racial and national diversity of our country, has
always been a whole-hearted champion of the struggle
for freedom of Afro-Americans and other specially op-
pressed people. Communists oppose all notions of “ra-
cial superiority.” They work to unite working people
of all nationalities.

Chicano Liberation

The special oppression of the Chicano people is
rooted in the rise of U.S. imperialism. _

These policies of chauvinism and discrimination
have been nurtured by centuries of oppression of the
Afro-American people, by genocide against Native
American Indian peoples and by U.S. imperialist ag-
gression against Mexico and other Central and South
American countries. Immigrants from other Central
American and Caribbean countries are also victims of
racial and national oppression.

More than 80 per cent of Chicanos are workers in
industry and agriculture. The Chicano people reside
mainly in the urban centers of the West, Southwest and
Midwest. In the West and Southwest Chicanos are the
largest nationally oppressed group.

Chicanos are compelled to work at the hardest jobs in
the mines, mills and other basic industries. Chicanos
are also victimized by corporate landowners and ag-
ribusiness on farms, in vineyards and in food-

30

processing plants. . .

Chicanos are subjected to discriminatory treatment
in hiring, wages, housing, education and in the exer-
cise of political and social rights. Enforced poverty

grips whole Chicano communities.

Chicanos are subjected to assaults upon personal
and national dignity. Public authorities suppress the
use of the Spanish language and other aspects of the
national culture.

An important factor among the Chicano people is the
continuing large immigration from Mexico.

A steady stream of Mexican peasants and workers
ﬂows into the U.S. in search of work. Company agents
facilitate this inﬂux, taking advantage of the workers’
plight to impose low wages and intolerable conditions.
Immigration officials and other government agents
constantly harass the immigrants to intimidate them
and suppress any organized resistance to shameful
exploitation. Periodic “roundups” and arrests are car-
ried out under the pretext of searching for “undocu-
mented” workers. .

The Chicano liberation movement is part of the over-
all struggle for democracy. It has close ties to the trade
union movement, and is increasingly closely united
with the struggle of “Hispanic” peoples in general and
with the Afro-American liberation struggle.

Communists fight for economic, political and social
equality for the Chicano people. This includes the
freedom to develop the Chicano cultural and linguistic
heritage. The Communist Party works for increased
representation for Chicanos at all levels of the trade
union movement, in public office and in community
organizations.

Puerto Rican Liberation

The United States has held Puerto Rico as a colony
since seizing it in the Spanish-American War of 1898.
The so-called commonwealth status imposed on the
island subjects it to continued U.S. economic and
political control. It is a sham designed to divert the
popular movement for independence. The partial U.S.
citizenship proclaimed for Puerto Ricans likewise
leaves intact the bonds of imperialist subjugation of the
island.

Puerto Rico has been transformed--against the will
of its people——into a U.S. military-naval base in the
Caribbean. Meanwhile, U.S. banks and corporate
interests distort Puerto Rico's economic development,
exploit its natural resources and extract superprofits
from its low-paid workforce.

Within the U.S. proper, Puerto Ricans constitute a
large oppressed national minority. Almost in their en-
tirety, Puerto Ricans form part of the working class.
Victimization by racial and national discrimination
lowers Puerto Ricans’ wages, debases working and liv-
ing conditions and denies equality of job opportunity.
Puerto Ricans in the U.S. have been largely denied
political representation and deprived. of full social
rights.

The Communist Party demands and works for full
economic, political and social equality for the Puerto
Rican people in the U.S. It supports the demand for the
use of the Spanish language in U.S. courts and other
public institutions, in the trade unions and in collec-
tive bargaining agreements, and for bilingual educa-
tion in public schools where there is a substantial
Spanish-speaking population. It demands an end to
colonial domination over Puerto Rico and supports the
right of the people of that country to self-determination
as to their future relationship to the United States,

32

including the right to separation.

The Communist Party demands the withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Puerto Rico and the closing of naval
bases there as a precondition for the free exercise of
these rights, and declares its solidarity with the desire
of the Puerto Rican people for national independence.

Native American Indian Liberation
The Native American Indian and Alaskan Native

peoples and nationalities are fighting for their very
survival against the power of state monopoly

C capitalism.

The threat to the survival of the Native peoples stems
from the seizure of their lands. This robbery continues
unabated. Powerful monopolies are expropriating In-
dian coal, oil and uranium resources; U.S. government
agencies act as neo-colonial overlords; and the whole
mechanism of state monopoly capitalism produces
almost indescribable poverty, unemployment and de-
nial of cultural and social rights.

The Native American Indian peoples have a glorious
history of militant resistance to all encroachments on
their lands and societies. That struggle continues
today in the fight to retain and expand a land base, for
sovereignty over the reservations and the rich re-
sources on them, for the recognition of full treaty
rights, for an end to forced sterilization of Indian
women and other genocidal practices. The Native
peoples seek to defend the use of their languages and
cultures and the sanctity of religious sites and burial
grounds. The Communist Party fully supports these
demands.

The Party gives full support to struggles against all
forms of inequality of Native American Indian people
in hiring, upgrading and promotion, in housing, ac-
cess to education and medical care. Communists sup-

33

si.

port the right of Native American Indians to speak,
read and study in their own languages.

Communists also support the right of Native Ameri-
can Indian peoples to take over industrial enterprises
and natural resources on their land and place them
under cooperative or other forms of people’s control.
Adequate government assistance should be provided
to enable balanced economic development, providing
both jobs and services, for the Indian peoples.

Communists work to remove all barriers to full elec-
toral and representation rights for Native American
Indian peoples.

The Native American Indian and Alaskan Native
peoples’ movements are directed against the
monopolies. Full support by the working class, or-
ganized labor in the first place, is in the best interest of
the working class and the vast majority of the people of
the United States.

Asian and Paciﬁc Peoples’ Liberation

Peoples of many nations of Asia and the Pacific are
among the millions who are subject to racist discrimi-
nation and mistreatment. They include immigrants-
and their U.S.-born descendants—from the Philip-
pines, Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, Kampuchea,
Thailand, Laos, Indonesia, India and other countries.
Racism and great-power chauvinism deprive these
people of equal rights and opportunities, whatever
their class or social status.

Employers extract superprofits from the labor of
Asian workers by paying them sub-standard wages.
They connive with immigration and other authorities
to intimidate these workers to keep them from joining
unions or exercising other rights. Despite this, workers
of Asian and Pacific ancestry have a militant tradition
of struggle, and have played a proud role in the labor

34

  

and progressive movements in the United States.
The Communist Party demands that Asian-Pacific
peoples, historically victimized by national and racial
prejudice in the U.S., be included in affirmative action
programs to achieve real equality in all areas of life.

The Jewish People

The majority of Jews are workers and professionals
whose interests lie with the working-class and anti-
monopoly movements.

Jewish people are denied equal rights in many walks

, of life. Every year there are numerous instances of

anti-Semitic abuse and desecration of synagogues.
“Respectable” anti-Semitism is widespread in the at-
titudes and practices of the ruling class.

Anti-Semitic demagogy is a staple of reactionary and
fascistic movements. It seeks to divert people's anger
from the ruling class and the capitalist system toward
the Jewish people.

The Communist Party condemns all manifestations
of anti-Semitism and demands its legal prohibition,
together with all acts and advocacy of racial, national
and religious hatred.

For Unity and Equality

The people ofour country are of numerous national
origins and nationalities; many are discriminated
against on the basis of race or color. Various ethnic
groups are subject to denial of their progressive cul-
ture, history and traditions. The ruling class systemati-
cally pits each group against the others in order to more
easily exploit them all.

But with all their rich variety and distinctiveness,
the people of the United States are a single national
family. Their lives and destinies are tightly interwo-

35

ven. At work and in recreation, they have everything to
learn and gain from each other. They have nothing to
gain from family quarrels. The multi-racial, multi-
national working class of the United States is a single
organic entity, bound together by ties of common labor
and shared interests as strong as any family kinship.

The men and women who comprise the membership
of the Communist Party, USA reflect the wonderful
ethnic diversity of our country. And being based on the
working class, the Party’s aim is abolition of the
capitalist system from which racial and national op-
pression arise. V

The Communist Party works, therefore, to bring into

one great coalition all peoples victimized by monopoly ‘

capital. It proposes to the people of our country a
course of action that will break the grip of state
monopoly capitalism upon their lives so that all may
enjoy real freedom and equality.

36

 

V. OTHER ALLIES
AGAINST MONOPOLY

The tremendous power wielded by the combined
resources of monopoly capital and the state can be
effectively confronted and defeated only by a closely-
knit coalition of those it exploits and victimizes. The
strength of such a movement depends not only on
numbers, but also on a capacity for determined mass
action to win real gains at monopoly’s expense.

The most important anti-monopoly force is the
working class. Its decisive role in the economy, its
organization and its history of struggle make it the
force bést-equipped to rally and lead the people to
defeat monopoly domination. In its own immediate
and long-range interests, the working class defends the
special needs of all sections of the population who
suffer from state monopoly domination.

Women in the Battle Against Monopoly

Women are almost half of the labor force. However,
while capitalism has drawn women more fully into
social production, it has simultaneously accentuated
their oppression.

For comparable work, women earn only 59 cents for
every dollar men earn. Women are still largely
excluded from numerous occupations, skills and clas-
sifications, especially the better-paid ones. Discrimi-
nation against women in training and promotion is
rampant. Women workers are heavily concentrated in

37

 

 

  

negotiation of mutual limitations and reductions in
arms levels. In the age of nuclear weapons, war
threatens the extinction of humanity.

In its daily activities the Communist Party is guided
by the proposition “People Before Profits.”

The Communist Party believes that the material
conditions for a secure and better life for the American
people exist in our rich and beautiful land. Our indus-
try, agriculture and technology, developed by the labor
and skill of workers, farmers and scientists,, are
adequate to raise the quality of life for every person to a
higher level.

It is the system of class exploitation and of monopoly
capitalist domination which blocks achievement of
these aims. Therefore, such advances require a process
of sustained mass struggle in which the working class
and its allies unite to break the monopolies’
stranglehold on our economic, political, social and
cultural life.

000

The United States has long been exhibited tothe
world as capitalism’s showcase, hawked by its defend-
ers as having the best and most democratic of all
possible socio-economic systems. But in fact,
capitalism in the United States suffers the same inher-
ent contradictions, anti-democratic features and social
evils as capitalism everywhere.

Native American Indian peoples were driven from
their lands and slaughtered in the drive to amass pri-
vate fortunes.

U.S. capitalists extracted their wealth from the labor
of people who came to these shores from around the
world.

They profited from the inhuman enslavement of
African-derived peoples.

 

  

  

unorganized industries and occupations; therefore
nine of ten women workers lack union representation.

Women are also oppressed by lack of atlequate child
care facilities. They suffer a higher than average rate of
unemployment. Women and children are the special
victims of poverty and thegwelfare system.

In all these regards, women of the oppressed
nationalities suffer with special severity.

The extra oppression and exploitation of women
workers tends to depress the conditions of male work-
ers as well, and is of benefit only to the corporate
employers.

The scarcity of women in elective office testifies to
the continuing political discrimination against
women. -

Women continue to carry the greater burden of
housework and child care.

The pervasive use of women as sexual lures in adver-
tising and the widespread distribution of pornography
reflect and encourage the social and sexual abuse of
women.

But women are also effective participants and lead-
ers in all the people’s movements: the trade unions,
political action groups, peace groups, the parents’
movement. Special women's organizations, including
those of trade union and nationally oppressed women,
also play an important role.

The Communist Party is dedicated to the complete
emancipation of women. This will require a tenacious
struggle on all fronts—economic, political and
ideological, including elimination of the backward
concepts and habits of male supremacy.

The Communist Party calls for:

—equality of women in work and in pay, to be
achieved by affirmative action programs and such spe-
cial provisions as paid maternity leaves;

—a massive drive to bring the bulk of presently-

38

   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
   

   
 
    
  
  
  
   
   

unorganized women workers into the trade unions;

—a nationwide network of publicly-funded and
democratically-controlled child care centers;

—the unequivocal right of women to plan their re-
productive lives, which is a special target of the ultra-
Right;

— greatly expanded representation of women in pub-
lic office and in the leadership of trade unions and
other people's organizations.

Youth—A Vital F orce for Progress

State monopoly capitalism can not provide a secure,
happy future for the youth.

Young people need jobs, while capitalism generates
unemployment. Young people seek guiding values
which affirm life, while decaying capitalism promotes
a cult of drugs, violence and cynical individualism.
For the monopolies, public education, low-cost hous-
ing, recreation and culture are “fat” to be trimmed from
the public budget. Young people deeply desire peace,
while state monopoly capitalism strives to incorporate
them into its war machine. It views youth as
e5<pendable—as cannon fodder.

In all these regards, the heaviest burden of the crisis
of capitalism falls on Black and other nationally op-
pressed youth.

Today, half or more of the workers in many indus-
tries are young. Young workers often have special
problems of job security, training, promotion, the es-
tablishment of a home and family. A large number of
young workers lack union protection and are subjected
to fast-paced labor for pay at——or even below—the
minimum wage. Within the labor movement, youth are
a factor tending toward more militant, class-struggle
policies.

Unemployment, which reaches phenomenal rates

39

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
   

among nationally oppressed youth, is the most serious
youth problem. The unemployed, whom capitalism
regards as “superﬂuous population,” are brutally re-
pressed.

With modern scientific-technological advances, the
need for education and the number of students con-
tinue to grow. An increasing proportion of students are
from working-class families or will themselves become
wage workers. However, neither the availability nor
the quality of education nearly measure up to the need.
Students participate not only in the struggle against
monopoly domination of education, for their specific
needs as students, but also spark popular struggles
against war and racism.

Young people are subject to a common oppression
by state monopoly capitalism and they are, therefore, a
special force capable of uniting in a broad people’s
coalition against it. Young workers have a special role
in cementing and leading the youth alliance.

Young people, whose life experience begins with the
present historical period, are often profoundly inﬂu-
enced by the changing world balance of forces, with its
dramatic revolutionary promise. Youth display vital-
ity, initiative, daring and idealism. For all these rea-
sons, the youth movement plays an exceptional role in
the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism.

The Communist Party calls for:

—no compulsory military service;

—massive job creation and job training for unem-
ployed youth; unemployment compensation for first-
time job seekers;

—a sharply-increased minimum wage, with no
exemptions for any category of employment;

—free, quality public education for all, with stipends
for students beyond the high school level;

—an end to Big Business’ grasp on our schools; input
from students and faculty and democratic public con-

40

  
 

trol of schools. ' ~ - x

The Communist Party maintains fraternal links with
the Young Workers Liberation League, an advanced
organization which spearheads the struggle for youth’s
everyday needs—the right to “earn, learn and live”—
and for the socialist future of the youth.

Intellectuals and Professionals
Intellectuals are a growing stratum of society. They

are increasingly linked with the working-class and
progressive forces. Scientific development and the

‘ concentration of capital tend to deprive them of eco-

nomically independent status and transform them into
wage workers, into segments of the working class». This
process is evident among scientists, teachers, writers,
medical workers and technicians, cultural, mass media
and communications workers. They increasingly
strive for organization and adopt working-class
methods of struggle. D

They too are victims of monopoly exploitation. They
are hard hit by inflation, escalating taxes, insecure
employment and income. '

Additionally, intellectuals see their labor perverted
to serve the reactionary ends of monopoly capital. The
military-industrial complex seeks to use science to in-
crease its powers of annihilation. Large numbers of
intellectuals are active in the struggle-against U.S.
policies of confrontation, against the danger of a nu‘-
clear war. T

Decaying bourgeois ideology increasingly attacks
science itself——not only Marxist social science, but all
products of reason—'and turns to mysticism and irra-
tionality. Some intellectuals are used to develop and
spread capitalism's reactionary ideologies.

Every honest intellectual must resist this assault.
Progressive intellectuals are called upon to combat

41

    
   
  
  
    
   

  

, reaction’s misuse of the mass media, education, litera-

l? ture and the arts.

, Intellectuals play aprogressive role to the extent that

 A they join with the working class in combatting the
power of monopoly capital. —

Seniors and Retired Workers

Older workers are discarded by the monopoly corpo-
it i: rations after every cent of profit has been wrung from
 them during a lifetime of labor, and they are often
4 cheated of their just pensions. Millions of seniors and
retired workers have joined together in a network of
organizations to fight for their right to retirement in
dignityand reasonable security, including an adequate
income, quality health care and decent housing.

Though most retirees are forced to live in poverty,
they are rich in experience in the class struggle. They
are valuable allies in the struggle against monopoly
capital. Retirees form a potent voting bloc fighting not
only for their own needs but for those of all working
people.

Communists strive to win a guarantee of a finan-
cially secure old age for all workers, principally
through the strengthening of the Social Security Sys-
tem, as a high priority.

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

Small Business and Farmers

Small business is a term covering disparate kinds of
companies, from family-operated farms and corner
groceries to sizable enterprises employing scores of
workers. Their position is a contradictory one. On the
one hand, they defend the conditions of capitalist pro-
duction, under which monopolies inevitably domi-
nate. On the other hand, their struggle for existence
often pits them against the monopolies’ plunder and

42

domination of the rest of society. They tend to vacillate
between the two basic classes.

It is preferable for the working class that the prob-
lems of small business be solved—to the extent that
they are capable of solution—at the expense of
monopoly and not at the expense of the workers. On
questions of taxation, militarism and other matters, the
interests of small business and the working class
largely coincide. On this basis, small business partici-
pates in a broad anti-monopoly coalition.

Farmers are in especially deep crisis. Income and
debt are at disastrous levels for many farmers. Family
farmers’ demands for parity prices, secure markets and
other forms of assistance deserve the support of or-
ganized labor and consumers. Guarantees of land ten-
ure for farmers is important to all the people, since
speculators often purchase farm land in order to divert
it to other uses. This undermines the agricultural base
of the nation.

With the growth of corporate farming, agricultural
workers have become an important force for progress
on the farms. Communists call on all working-class
and progressive forces to give full support to their
efforts to organize and improve conditions.

43

VI. FOR AN ANTI-MONOPOLY ALLIANCE,
FOR A PEOPLE’S PARTY

There is a steady deterioration of the overall quality
of life in our country. High inﬂation has become a
built-in feature of capitalism. It puts tremendous pres-
sure on real wages, which decline over long periods.
The cities are in advanced stages of decay. Blatant
corporate robbery through tax loopholes, cost over-
runs, deregulation and other swindles have become
commonplace. Slums grow while housing construc-
tion lags. -

This reality cries out for the majority of the people to
unite against the exploiting minority.

The prospects for effecting a permanent shift against
the monopolies in the class balance of forces grow to
the extent that all anti-monopoly groups and organiza-
tions strengthen their mutual support and engage in
united struggle to curb the state-monopoly power.

Such a coalition could influence even non-
monopoly sections of the capitalist class. Those whose
interests coincide with the interests of the people on
certain questions may support—or at least not
oppose—some efforts of the anti-monopoly coalition.

A popular movement of this kind might not at first
challenge capitalism as a system, but it could win
concessions and substantially weaken and limit
monopoly power in important areas of political and
economic life.

44

For Radical Reforms

The monopolies generally yield to the people only
such concessions as leave the power of monopoly capi-
tal essentially intact. Every ruling class, when compel-
led to grant reforms, presents them as tokens of its own
generosity and reasonableness. Each new reform is
used to claim that the existing order is ﬂexible and
eternal. State monopoly capitalism does everything to
contain the struggle for reform within channels which
minimize mass participation and militancy.

The anti-monopoly coalition and its political party,
therefore, will have to involve millions of people in the
fight for radical reforms that will make inroads into the
power of the monopolies. Some of its demands may be
won in the process of contesting for political power
and others will be enacted by elected representatives
committed to curbing the monopolies.

The great lesson of the fight for major change in our
history is that victory requires mass participation and
militancy. The struggle for the abolition of slavery
included the systematic defiance of the Fugitive Slave
Law as well as slave revolts. The right of labor to
organize was won by strikes and demonstrations that
employer and government opposition often turned
into bitter battles. The fight for women's suffrage re-
quired civil disobedience, militant demonstrations
and mass petitions.

More recent experiences in the struggle for civil
rights and to end the Vietnam War proved again the
need for mass actions in the streets and workshops as
well as at the polls.

But no struggle is ended when a given reform is won.
The people must vigilantly pursue its implementation
and view it as a base from which further gains can be
wrested from the monopolies.

45

 

   

An Anti-Monopoly Program

A program of radical reforms would include, but not
necessarily be limited to, the following:

1. Negotiate comprehensive arms limitations and
reductions. Drastically slash the bloated military
budget and apply the savings to constructive public
use, such as providing employment and training;
guaranteeing affirmative action with firm quotas and
timetables so as to overcome past discrimination and
rapidly achieve full equality; building low-rent, qual-
ity housing; vast improvements in mass public trans-
portation and public services.

2. Close all tax loopholes for the rich and end public
subsidies to the monopolies; tax corporate profits
heavily; end all giveaways of natural resources to the
monopolies and reclaim past grants wherever possible.

3. Strengthen labor’s right to organize, to enforce
contracts and to strike. Curb “management preroga-
tives” on such questions as plant closings, automation,
job safety, environmental protection, product quality
and similar questions which vitally affect the lives of
workers and the whole people.

4. Nationalize the energy monopolies so as to pro-
vide adequate energy supplies at the lowest possible
cost. Build modern power plants providing conditions
of maximum safety.

5. Public ownership of the hospitals, drug and medi-
cal companies. Provide free, quality, comprehensive
health care for all.

6. Abolish the CIA and the FBI; enact measures to
prohibit racist or political repression of the people’s
movements.

7. Enact and enforce measures to protect the exercise
of full economic, political and social equality for all
races and nationalities and for women.

8. Extend aid to family-type farms through grants,

46

 

  

long-term government’ loans and guarantees of parity
prices for products. Make similar credits and loans
available to other small producers and service enter-
prises.

9. Rescue our cities from the grasp of the banks and
wealthy bondholders and provide funds to improve
the quality of urban and rural life.

10. Remove unequal barriers to foreign trade and
promote interchange with other nations on terms of
mutual benefit.

11. Enact a National Youth Act guaranteeing the
right of youth to earn, learn and live a full life.

Through these and similar measures, the power and
well-being of the working class and the people would
be increased and that of monopoly capital reduced,
subject to the considerable limitations imposed by the
continued existence of capitalism.

The Corporate Two-Party System

The present two-party system is a vise within which
the state-monopoly power seeks to confine class con-
ﬂicts and social pressures, thus ensuring its own rule.
The two major parties are alliances of conﬂicting cor-
porate sectional and economic interests, strung to-
gether by electoral expediency. But this very hodge-
podge, offered as evidence of “democracy,” leaves the
centralized power of the monopolies and their state
unchallenged.

As the corruption and demagogy of the bourgeois
politicians become obvious to millions, disillusion-
ment with bourgeois politics increases. This is shown
in part by the large numbers of people who refuse to
vote. Increasing numbers, however, work for anti-
monopoly, independent alternatives.

Monopoly’s answer to this process is not democrati-

47

  

  

European workers and peasants who ﬂed oppression
in their native countries became fodder for the sweat-
shops of developing capitalist industries.

The riches of U.S. capitalism also came from the
seizure of lands from Mexico and the oppression of the
Chicano people.

At the turn of the twentieth century, U.S. capitalism
embarked on its imperialist stage, colonizing Puerto
Rico, the Philippines and other lands.

Almost all the great productive facilities of our land,
developed by centuries of toil by the people, are
monopolized by a small fraction of the population.

Private corporations have appropriated the bounti-
ful riches of nature, the abundant mineral resources_,
vast areas of fertile soil, great forests and waterways.

Big corporations have bankrupted and taken over
millions of small businesses and family farms, and
thereby have swollen into gigantic monopolies.

006

However, the struggles of the common people for
their needs and for greater democracy are also a con-
stant theme of our history.

The Revolutionary War for Independence was a
great, liberating step forward. It freed the North Ameri-
can colonies from British colonialism, abolished
monarchical rule and established a republic. This was
a historic blow against feudal reaction on a world scale.
But native capitalists and slaveowners captured most
of the benefits of these hard-won victories.

The original draft of the Constitution included no
guarantees of individual rights. Mass popular insis-
tance won the addition of the Bill of Rights.

During the nation's first century the brutal reality of
slavery mocked the assertion that “All men are created
equal.” The fight to abolish slavery stood at the heart of

3

  

   

zation or a loosened grip on the old parties. Rather, it
turns increasingly to ultra-Right political formations
ll  and anti-labor and racist candidates.

15,,  The monopolies also encourage and finance diver-
l sionary “single-issue” movements that seek to turn
[ back even the most limited gains won by the people.
[xi ,, This is the role of the “New Right,” which pretends to
 . . identify itself with grievances of the people in order to
‘  divert popular movements into reactionary channels.

 Labor's Political Independence—Key Step

 it More and more, workers confront what is virtually
M T an interlocking directorate of the monopolies and the
state. The state organs intervene on behalf of the
monopolies to dictate the terms of collective bargain-
ing settlements and to break strikes.
More and more’, everyday economic issues merge
with broad political questions—unemployment, inﬂa-

tion, safety and health, mass transit, energy, plant
shutdowns, peace andthe military budget. This adds
to the urgency of taking a class approach to the solution
of political questions.

Not even the most diehard class-collaborationist
would dare propose that a steel corporation executive
should be elected to head the steelworkers’ union. But
without an independent political vehicle, workers are
compelled to vote for candidates and parties controlled
by corporate executives.

The historic challenge that faces labor, therefore, is
to develop its political independence and become the
leading force in a broad, people’s anti-monopoly party.

The Communist Party works energetically for the
success of the broadest possible anti-monopoly coali-
tion. It works to strengthen alliances of working-class
and progressive forces in the shops, thecommunities
and in people’s organizations. This grassroots base is
indispensable to a people’s political party.

The Communist Partyhas long advocated an inde-
pendent, anti-monopoly political party led by labor,
committed to a program of radical reforms. Such a
party could win satisfaction of many immediate and
longer-range needs.

However, the understanding of the common enemy
necessary for such a development does not occur spon-
taneously. The Communist Party works to increase the
consciousness of masses of people about the state-
monopoly foe and the requirements for victory.

The Party strives to ensure that the working class,
especially its organized sector, is recognized as the
force which unites and heads the anti-monopoly coali-
tion. At the same time, the Party cultivates among more
and more workers the highest level of working-class
consciousness. '

The Communist Party advances these aims through
its own candidates for public office and by support for

49

all candidates and legislative measures which serve
the interests of labor and the people. It seeks the estab-
lishment of a popular-democratic government devoted
to freeing the working class and the people from
state-monopoly control. The contributions of the
Communist Party are vital to the development of the
anti-monopoly movement, and a stronger Communist
Party is in the interest of all anti-monopoly forces.

Uprooting Monopoly Power

The strategic perspective of the Communist Party is
based on the inevitability of sharpening conﬂict be-
tween the interests of the people and those of the
capitalist monopolies. State monopoly capitalism is
running the U.S. economy into the ground. And while
capitalism decays, the rate of exploitation increases.
As a result, the class struggle sharpens, economic and
social issues come into sharper focus. The longer con-
tradictions remain unresolved, the more acute they
become. They compel the building of a firm anti-
monopoly alliance whose electoral arm is the people’s
party, led by labor. ;

Day-to-day struggles are a school for the fight to take
complete political power. One can not oppose or stand
aloof from the struggle for vital immediate needs on the
one hand and be for social revolution on the other.
Conditions which deteriorate without counteracting
struggle give rise not to revolutionary fervor but to
demoralization and tendencies to succumb to fascist
demagogy.

Thus, the anti-monopoly struggle for people’s power
is more than an answer to immediate problems. It is a
historic necessity for survival, for the satisfaction of the
people’s needs and extension of their rights. It is both a
preparation for and a component of the struggle for
socialism. '

50

 

The anti-monopoly" struggle for radical and struc-
tural reforms does not supplant the struggle for
socialism. However, there is an important relation be-
tween them. Carried to its logical conclusion, the
anti-monopoly struggle leads to the threshold of
socialism.

The Communist Party participates in the anti-
monopoly political alignment and would serve, along
with others, at the people’s will, in an anti-monopoly
government brought to power by the victories of this
coalition.

We Communists, motivated by the basic human
needs of our class and our people, fight every day
against the evils of capitalism. The fate of our class and
our people is our prime concern. We are convinced that
socialism, and beyond it communism, offer the only
fundamental and lasting solution to the problems of
exploitation and oppression. The struggle for re-
volutionary change is the logical continuation of the
struggle for a better life.

The electoral victory of a people’s anti-monopoly
party most likely would not produce a drawn-out
period of equilibrium between an anti-monopoly ad-
ministration and a capitalist economy in which the
monopolies retained positions of strength. In the
course of a many-sided struggle, which would neces-
sarily involve millions of people against the
monopolies, it would become apparent to the majority
of the working class and most of its allies that they were
dealing with an organic crisis of an outdated social
system which is exploitative, oppressive, corrupt, ra-
cist, dehumanizing and irrational. It would become
clear that fighting to restrain monopoly is not enough.
Capitalism itself must go.

The decisive steps in ushering capitalism to its his-
torical exit will be both political and economic. On the
one hand, it will require the extension of popular

51

 

power to all branches and levels of government, mak-
ing the working class, with its allies, the dominant
force in society. On the other hand, the people will
have to take control of the commanding heights of the
economy, first of all by bringing into the public domain
the property of the big industrial, energy, mining,
transportation, banking, insurance, agribusiness and
wholesaling corporations. '

Such a development would open the way for the next
stage of human progress — socialism.

52

 

A .VII. NEEDElD:l FUNDAMENTAL
SOCIAL CHANGE

Increasingly, the basic needs and interests of the vast
majority of our people demand a fundamental change
in our economic and social system, in which both
wealth and political power are monopolized by a
privileged group of industrialists and bankers.

For the rest of us there is constant insecurity, prepa-
ration for war, ever-rising prices and soaring rents,
unjust taxation, persistent mass unemployment, de-
gradation of culture and public education, the fanning
of racism, victimization by crime and corruption in
governing circles. The quality of life undergoes steady
deterioration.

Capitalism has been in an ever-deepening crisis for
most of this century. Millions of people throughout the
world have come to recognize that capitalism is not an
everlasting system.

The Revolutionary Transition to Socialism

The Soviet Union (USSR) was the first to abolish
capitalist relations of production and to develop a ful-
ler and happier life for its people.

In Europe, Asia, Africa and in the Caribbean, other
nations have since taken up the building of socialist
society as the solution to their problems. In this same
period, over two billion victims of colonialism have
broken out of imperialist bondage and established in-
dependent states. Many of these countries have also

53

  

chosen the socialist road.

The consolidation on a world scale of the new social
system, socialism, with its growing satisfaction of
human needs and establishment of humane relations,
reveals how outmoded and bankrupt capitalism is.

Existing socialism demonstrates that capitalists,
stockholders, landlords and banker loan-sharks are
parasitic and nonproductive. It proves that the work-
ing people can manage production and public affairs
for the common good.

The United States is well-equipped for the adoption
of this modern, progressive social system.

Our country, with its abundant resources, highly
developed productive capacity and concentrated eco-
nomic structure, is objectively ready for planned social
production for the well-being of all.

Our workers, the nation’s largest class, have long
experience in collective labor in large-scale enter-
prises. T

To advance to the construction of a socialist society
in the U.S. requires that the working people take over
the reins of government and assume power. The anti-
monopoly alliance, in the course of fighting for its
democratic aims, will be brought face to face with the
fundamental question: Either it curbs and destroys
monopoly power or monopoly will destroy people's
power. Such is the inner logic, the dynamics of the
class struggle.

But destruction of monopoly power can not mean
turning back the clock to pre-monopoly capitalism. At
the modern level of economic and technological
development, socialism is the next rung on the ladder
of social progress.

When a decisive majority recognizes that it is neces-
sary to do away with capitalism, the struggle is no
longer limited to anti-monopoly reforms, however rad-
ical. There follows the struggle to end the power of

54

 

private monopolies and to establish public ownership
of the nation’s basic productiveplant under the politi-
cal leadership of the working class.

A Profoundly Democratic Event

The circumstances under which such a turning
point will be reached can not now be predicted, nor can
the precise nature of the revolutionary conflict that
will then take place. Revolution, as our Declaration of
Independence affirms, is the most fundamental of
democratic rights because it involves the people them-
selves exercising their sovereign authority.

Social revolution is the replacement of one class in
power by another, of one social system by another. It
basically changes economic, political and social rela-
tionships.

So profound a transformation can not be made by a
coup or a conspiracy. A coup is an attempt to bring
about change by manipulation at the top by a small
minority. Socialist revolution depends upon mass par-
ticipation and majority support. This provides a firm
foundation for democratic rule by the producing
majority in all aspects of national life.

The entire history of the United States demonstrates
it is naive to think that monopoly capital would be
restrained by constitutional scruples from resorting to
violence to stop even the most democratic majority
mandate for a socialist solution. No ruling class has
ever voluntarily relinquished its power.

Whether the democratic will of the people can be
fulfilled by relatively peaceful means or whether the
ruling class will be able to inflict violence upon the
country can be answered precisely only in terms of the
total political situation prevailing at the time of such a
transition.

The best guarantee for averting violence is the crea-

55

  

  

tion of a people's majority. If this majority is suffi-
ciently overwhelming, firm of purpose and united in
command of decisive sectors of.power,.it will be able to
restrain and minimize monopoly’s capacity to use
force. Such may be the case when the revolutionary
situation matures, when the ruling monopolies can no
longer rule effectively in the old way and the majority
of the people are no longer willing to tolerate the old
order.
In short, the possibility of averting counter-
V revolutionary violence hinges on the success of strug-
gles for radical reforms which weaken or remove
monopoly’s grip on political and economic power.
The Communist Party works unceasingly to
strengthen the leading role of the working class and to
weld its firm unity with its allies in order to create the
most favorable relationship of forces against the
/monopolies and make possible a peaceful transition to
socialism.
The Communist Party will continue to seek the most
peaceful path possible.

Socialism, USA

A socialist government would transfer to public
ownership the privately-owned large-scale means of
production-—utilities and transport, banks, factories,
agribusiness and natural resources. This would not
include personal property serving personal needs,
such as homes, and cars.

Family farmers would be assured land tenure. Vol-
untary formation of efficient, large-scale co-operative
farms would be encouraged and assisted. Huge corpo-
rate farms would be taken over and operated by the
state on modern industrial lines.

Small businesses and shopkeepers would be as-
sisted, without the burden of high taxes and oppres-

56

sion by the monopolies. , I t

For the first time, the talents and skills of profession-
als and intellectuals would be utilized to their full
potential for the good of society. This would be made
possible by expansion of schools, hospitals,
laboratories, research facilities, publishing houses,
mass communications media, theaters, museums and
all other public institutions which enrich the physical
and spiritual life of our people.

In a socialist society all people able to work would be
guaranteed a job of their choice. It would no longer be
permissible to exploit and to profit from the labor of
others. Equal pay for equal work would become the
rule. Early retirement would be possible at a com-
pletely adequate income.

Under socialism, the products of social labor would
not be diverted for private profit. The profits of
publicly-owned enterprises would constitute the basis
for a social fund which the socialist government and
people's organizations would allocate for public serv-
ices, for ‘expanding production and for new technol-
ogy, modernization and automation.

This fund would provide facilities-including child
care centers—to ease household burdens; it would
provide for retired, handicapped and disabled people.
The fund would subsidize construction and mainte-
nance of schools, hospitals, low-rent housing and rec-
reational facilities, free and complete medical and
dental care, public mass transportation, free public
education up to and including higher education, and
other social measures.

Basic Democratic Rights and Freedoms

The building of socialism would lead to the abolition
of classes once and for all and to the establishment of
wide political and economic rights. Only the “right” of

57

   

  

the struggle to extend democracy and labor’s rights.
Five years of bloody civil war finally abolished slav-
ery and won adoption of the basic rights enshrined in
the XIII, XIV and XV Amendments to the Constitution.
Triumph over the slavocracy also paved‘ the way to the
democratic advances of the Reconstruction period.
Until well into the twentieth century, trade unions
were treated as illegal “conspiracies to restrain trade.”
The very idea of workers joining together to improve
wages and working conditions was rejected by the
government. Labor leaders were frequently framed-up
and jailed, and strikes were broken by force. Finally, in
the 1930s the efforts of uncounted rank-and-file or-
ganizers breached the biggest open-shop fortresses of
industry and won union. representation for millions of
production workers. V K
In the early years of the nation, the rights to vote and
to hold office were generally restricted to white male
property owners. Every grudging extension of the
franchise in the more than two centuries since has been
wrung from a reluctant ruling class by people’s strug-
gles. The efforts to win women’s right to vote was
finally crowned with success in 1920. It took Freedom
Rides, boycotts, sit-ins, mass demonstrations and the
Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts to reopen Southern
voting booths to Afro-Americans in the 1960s. _
We are heir to a long tradition of struggle which can
count amongits own such giants as Frederick Doug-
lass, Eugene V. Debs and W.E.B. DuBois, Elizabeth
Gurley. Flynn and William Z. Foster, thousands of
other people’s advocates, and scores of thousands of
unsung heroes. Our history, in short, like that of every
other class society, is a history of class struggles.
Much has been won by these struggles. But whatever
reforms have been won have not changed the basic
nature of the system. Our present reality, including the
reality of conflicting interests and class struggles, is

4

 

a minority to exploit and dominate the majority would
be infringed. Just as the “right” of the slaveowners to
“their” property was abolished in order to establish the
freedom of the slaves, the “right” of capitalist exploita-
tion would be ended.

The rights of the people would be protected and
expanded. ,

Every citizen 18 years of age and over would enjoy
the right to vote and to be elected to public office.

The people would become the managers of society
through elected government bodies, as well as through
trade unions, on-the-job committees and co-
operatives, farm, professional and community organi-
zations. The constitutional right of the people to recall
and replace their elected representatives would be es-
tablished.

All institutions which had repressed the people’s
democratic rights or strivings would be abolished.

Socialist society would prohibit exploitation of labor
in any form, put an end to all attempts to restore racism
or discrimination against women.

Under a socialist government, the individual liber-
ties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights would be retained
and expanded.

Fundamental civil rights, individual freedoms and
family life would be protected by the socialist state.
Separation of church and state would be maintained
and the right to religious beliefs and practices would
be recognized and protected. _

Freedom of speech, press, assembly and association
would be assured by the constitution. The exercise of
these basic freedoms would be guaranteed and ex-
panded by the public ownership of the mass media
under democratic control.

A socialist government would prohibit discrimina-
tion in any form and outlaw the dissemination of ra-
cism, chauvinism, anti-Semitism, religious or national

58

hatred and incitement to war or violence.

The socialist government would take affirmative ac-
tion to overcome the consequences of generations of
discriminatory treatment and guarantee equal oppor-
tunities and conditions for the Afro-American, Puerto
Rican, Chicano, Native American Indian and other
peoples specially oppressed under capitalism.

Special measures would be taken to assure rights to
distinctive languages and cultures.

Special measures would be taken to insure the equal-
ity of women in all walks of life.

A socialist government of the United States would
seek agreements with all nations for mutual total
disarmament—to banish war forever, freeing trillions
of dollars for constructive purposes.

Agreements would be reached with developing
countries to assist their rapid rise to equality with the
industrial nations.

The foreign policy of a socialist USA would aim to
secure peace, equality and mutually advantageous re-
lations with all peoples of the world.

These are among the great benefits of the new social
order—socialism.

Communism, USA

From its inception, socialism would reward people
for their labor, in accordance with their contribution to
society. At the same time, the principle would be in-
troduced of the full satisfaction of people’s needs. The
application of this principle would be steadily ex-
panded as enabled by growing material abundance.

Socialism would open the path to a society of abun-
dance for all, applying the principle: “From each ac-
cording to their ability, to each according to their
needs.” This higher stage of development of socialism
is communism. Under communism:

59

Socially useful labor will become an enjoyable part
of life.

The last remnants of social distinctions based on
class, race, nationality or sex will be eradicated.

Abundance and a high level of social awareness will
prevail and therefore there will be no need for any form
of coercion by the state. y

With communism, humankind will enter the era of
freedom from the whims of nature. Control of the envi-
ronment will reach unprecedented levels, and will be
exercised to achieve harmony with nature and to pre-
serve and enhance its potential for future generations.

Individuals will consciously and voluntarily strive
to benefit society as a whole. Society will foster the
maximum realization of the potential of each indi-
vidual. Human beings will become truly free at last.

Such are the advances which socialism and com-
munism will usher in for our people and land.

History’s Greatest Revolutionary Transition

Today’s revolutionary tide extends to all continents,
to the most remote regions.

Revolutions in previous eras swept away absolute
monarchies, feudalism and colonialism in many areas
of the globe. But in doing so, they exchanged one
exploitative ruling class for another.

Socialist revolution puts an end to all forms of class
exploitation. Today’s socialist revolutions mark hu-
manity’s historic transition—worldwide—from
capitalism and imperialism to socialism.

The transition from slavery to feudalism to
capitalism spanned many centuries. The hallmark of
our age is -the swiftness of revolutionary transition and
of socialist construction.

The economic, political and military balance of

60

forces in the world is not mechanical or static. The
march of progress is clear, but it is inevitably marked
by some ebbs and flows. Disunity and weaknesses
among the revolutionary forces, errors or miscalcula-
tions can—and at times do—lead to some setbacks.

But the overall course of social change is forward. It
takes place in a historical situation in which the forces
opposing imperialism, led by the working people
exercising state power in socialist and socialist-
oriented countries, allied with national liberation
movements and the working-class and anti-monopoly
forces in the capitalist countries, exert decisive influ-
ence on the course of history.

This paramount fact places its indelible stamp on
our time. The old colonial empires have been dumped
on the scrap heap of history. Almost all of the previ-
ously colonized nations and peoples are successfully
traveling the path of independence. More than a billion
human beings have already embarked upon the
socialist transformation of their countries.

It is important to note that while the basically ag-
gressive nature of imperialism is unalterable, circum-
stances can force it to modify its course of action. Even
as powerful a force as U.S. imperialism has been in-
creasingly forced to retreat before the united strength
of the anti-imperialist forces.

Socialist countries are characterized by steady eco-
nomic growth and the development of science,
technology, education and culture. The socialist com-
munity's development and closer unity are great con-
tributions to the freedom of all peoples.

The newly liberated lands have great pride in their
sovereignty and are firmly resolved to overcome low
levels of economic and social development and other
legacies of imperialist domination.

National liberation revolutions aim to destroy im-
perialist domination, feudal bondage and political

61

tyranny. For these goals a broad national unity may be
forged, including workers, peasants, intellectuals,
middle classes, sections of the armed forces and even
some capitalists whose development is hampered by
foreign monopolies.

These struggles are not necessarily for socialism, but
are closely linked to it. Imperialism is their common
enemy. The socialist world supports national libera-
tion struggles economically, diplomatically and
militarily and by revolutionary example. This is the
opposite of imperialist behavior.

Therefore, peoples subjected to neo-colonialism
more and more work to bypass capitalist development
and move onto a socialist path.

The balance of strength between the three revolu-
tionary currents—socialism, national liberation and
the working class of the capitalist countries—on the
one hand, and the declining forces of capitalism, im-
perialism and neo-colonialism, on the other hand, has
shifted irrevocably in favor of revolutionary change.

62

 

VHI. COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

A socialist revolution never breaks out simply be-
cause the objective conditions for it have ripened. Pro-
found revolutionary transformation equally requires
the development of subjective preconditions-the
consciousness and organization of the working class
and its allies. A revolutionary working-class party is
necessary to help bring it about.

The organized efforts of the people’s mass organiza-
tions and the trade unions are necessary, but are lim-
ited, for the most part, to the struggle against specific
injustices. These organizations embrace all who strug-
gle on day-to-day issues, even if they do not seek more
fundamental changes. In this sense, they do not bas-
ically challenge the capitalist system.

The members of the Communist Party are men and
women who are devoted to the struggle for social prog-
ress, including the winning of socialism. The organiza-
tional principles of the Communist Party make it an
effective instrument for the realization of this lofty
goal. The Communist Party’s strategic outlook and
ideology permit it to focus scattered struggles and
connect them with the historic goal of liberation from
capitalism. This is the revolutionary party of our coun-
try.

Founding of the CPUSA

The Communist Party, USA, was founded in
Chicago in 1919. The founders of the Communist Party

63

 

 

 

were activists of the revolutionary currents within the
old Socialist Party, militants in the American Federa-
tion of Labor, the best elements of the Industrial Work-
ers of the World (IWW). They were militant, revolu-
tionary workers, farmers, professionals and intellectu-
als of all races and nationalities. The birth of the Com-
munist Party was a working’-class response to the
exploitation and oppression of monopoly capitalism
and to the savagery of world war, into which im-
perialism plunged the world. These resulted in a pro-
cess of radicalization and a sharpening of class battles.

The founders of the Communist Party welcomed and
were inspired by the worldwide revolutionary upsurge
of that period and by the first successful establishment
of working-class power by the 1917 socialist revolu-
tion in Russia. *

What the Party Stands For

The Communist Party, USA, carries forward the re-
volutionary traditions of our War of Independence and
the fight for the Bill of Rights.

It advances the struggle so courageously begun by
the Abolitionists and the early Marxists who fought the
slavocracy in the Civil War.‘ It continues to build upon
the democraticheritage of historic battles for trade
unions, free public education, civil rights, civil liber-
ties and women's equality.

The Communist Party firmly opposes all imperialist
interference in the lives of other peoples and combats
imperialist war, especially mindful of its duty to halt
any such aggression by the ruling class of our own
country.

The Communist Party works for the banning of all
nuclear weapons and for total disarmament. It acts to
strengthen the solidarity of working people and of
anti-imperialist forces throughout the world. It advo-

64

 _.......,.....,_......~ ..—._.... . .

cates peaceful coexistence of states with‘ differing so-
cial systems. _ ‘ ‘ * ‘

As a revolutionary party of the working class, the
Communist Party stands unequivocably for peace,
jobs, equality, democracy and socialism. This program
spells out how we see these goals being realized.

Not all those who style themselves “socialist” neces-
sarily advance the cause of socialism.

Many pseudo-Left groups hide behind super-radical
cliches, resort to provocative tactics and spurn popular
unity and the struggle for reforms. They often misuse
and discredit the name “Communist” in a way which
divides the people's forces and strengthens reaction.

Communists work for common, constructive aims
with honest workers and progressive-minded people
who may have been misled, in their search for radical
change, into following pseudo-Left groups or organi-
zations.

There are organizations which, under the label of
“social democracy,” combat existing socialism and the
Communist movement. They urge working people to
adopt policies of collaboration with, instead of strug-
gle against, their exploiters. They resort to red-baiting
while supporting imperialist intrigues and aggression.
They opportunistically hold out the false promise of a
reformed capitalism in place of radical change.

There are, however, Leftward-moving currents of
social democrats who oppose these Right-wing
policies and seek cooperation with others for far-
reaching changes.

Communists work for united action wherever possi-
ble with such groupings, as well as with non-socialist
progressives, for the needs of the working people,
against nuclear war, against racism and for many other
mutual interests.

Communists work to strengthen a militant united
front against monopoly despite inevitable ideological

65

differences of the various groups in such a front.
Party Theory and Organization

The program of the CPUSA is based on objective
laws which govern the development of society in gen-
eral, and the transition from capitalism to socialism in
particular. This body of knowledge of social develop-
ment is called scientific socialism or Marxism-
Leninism. Like every science, it is being constantly
enriched by practical experience and theoretical study.
It has already enabled Communist Parties to success-
fully lead hundreds of millions of working people to
abolish capitalist rule and begin the construction of
socialism in a great part of the world.

The basic organizations of the Communist Party are
the clubs, to which all members belong. The clubs are
the main avenue for theparticipation of members in
Party life. They provide ongoing political education
and guidance in everyday struggles for members of the
Party.

The Communist Party operates on the principles of
democratic centralism. It is built on voluntarily-
assumed commitments of its members and democratic
procedures. Communists elect their leadership and
democratically determine the policies of the Party.
Once policies are arrived at, members give them united
support. The elected leadership exercises central di-
rection of the Party. A Marxist-Leninist party employs
collective methods of work, utilizing the knowledge
and experience of the entire membership.

IX. OUR SCIENTIFIC OUTLOOK

This program is an expression and an application of
a world outlook, of an ideology.

Our world outlook is scientific socialism. Its
pioneers in the nineteenth century were Karl Marx and
Frederick Engels. Its foremost exponent and developer
in the twentieth century was V.I. Lenin. Scientific
socialism is frequently called Marxism or Marxism-
Leninism, after the leading founders and practitioners
of this new science. Like any true science, it begins
with study of the world as it actually is. It rests on two
major philosophical foundations:

1. Human society, like the natural world of which it
is a part, is capable of scientific explanation. Its devel-
opment is governed by laws that can be scientifically
ascertained, that is, derived from and tested by human
experience and analysis.

2. Study of the world as it actually is must include
the world in the process of change, for change is its
most durable feature. At times change proceeds almost
imperceptibly, at other times by revolutionary leaps.
But to regard the world as static is to distort reality. For
us, the real question is not whether society will change,
but what laws govern that change and what forces
compel it. To the extent we find scientific answers to
these questions, we can, through conscious effort,
facilitate the change and minimize the hardships it
might entail.

In sum, our outlook is materialist, rejecting any ideas
of the supernatural. Our method is dialectical, recog-

67

War by far the strongest imperialist power financially,

 

still" conditioned by the" existence of capitalism.

The corporate giants and the government still “get
tough” with labor, deny trade union rights, resort to
police, National Guard, private goons, court injunc-
tions and public anti-labor campaigns.

In the mines, factories, fields and on construction
sites workers continue to suffer needless injuries, shor-
tened lives and instant death.

Thirty million Afro-Americans are still victims of an
outrageous system of institutionalized racial and na-
tional oppression. Similarly, the Chicano, Puerto Ri-
can, Native American Indian and Asian-Pacific
peoples are discriminated against on the basis of race
and nationality.

Poverty, insecurity, illiteracy and chronic unem-
ployment fester and grow despite the remarkable,
widespread application of science to production.

Money, manpower, scientific and natural resources
almost beyond comprehension are lavished on the
Pentagon and its corporate suppliers. But far from en-
hancing our national security, this is the most serious
threat to our continued existence as a nation.

And, not least, politicians beholden to their
capitalist campaign contributors hold a monopoly of
political power through the Democratic and Republi-
can parties. Access to the ballot and to the mass media
for minority parties and anti-monopoly independent
candidates is still sharply restricted and in many cases
impossible.

Unlike Europe and Asia, the United States largely .

escaped the devastation of two world wars in this cen-
tury. U.S. capitalism emerged from the Second World

nizing change as fundamental and rejecting all static,
frozen concepts of reality.

Our outlook clashes with others that view history as
a jumble of accidents, a haphazard series of exploits by
great men, the unfathomable clash of human wills, the
expression of innate instincts, the mechanical reﬂec-
tion of biological laws, the whim of supernatural
forces, or the predestined unfolding of some design.

This clash is not an abstract philosophical dispute. If
social conditions and developments are the product of
forces beyond rational understanding or inﬂuence, it
follows we can do nothing about them, that wisdom
lies in resigning ourselves to things as they are.
Clearly, such an outlook serves those with vested
interests in the status quo. It serves the capitalist class.

If, on the other hand, society is governed by scienti-
fically discoverable laws, it follows that discovery of
those laws endows us with great possibilities of
achieving mastery over social conditions. Clearly, this
outlook accords with the interests of those who are not
favored by the status quo, who are not led by privileged
positions in contemporary society to obscure its
realities, or to represent it as the end point of social
development rather than a passing stage on the journey
of human progress. It accords with the interest of the
working class.

Marxism-Leninism is, therefore, the science of soci-
ety and its development. It is revolutionary because it
recognizes that the struggles of today foreshadow fun-
damental social change. And it is revolutionary be-
cause it demonstrates that the climactic point of that
change, the replacement of one social system by
another, is a revolutionary act, as the building of a
socialist society is a revolutionary process.

Many are impelled by their own grievances or by
indignation at the injustices and social inequities they
see about them to rebel against capitalist society. They

68

may be motivated by admirable ethical principles, by
splendid visions of the good society. But their rebel-
lion remains largely blind, its effectiveness impaired,
without a scientific understanding of the society
against which they rebel or of the social forces that can
change it. Because Marxism shows precisely which
social forces are interested in basic change and how to
channel their protest against social injustice into effec-
tive, organized movements, it is a science of human
liberation.

The growth of Marxism-Leninism attests to two key
facts of contemporary history: capitalism inexorably
produces, in wage workers, a class which opposes that
system, and the working class finds in Marxism-
Leninism the ideological instrument for realization of
its aims and aspirations.

Marxism-Leninism is the world outlook of the work-
ing class, the theoretical instrument essential for
achievement of working-class political power.
Nowhere has the working class achieved victory with-
out it.

This explains the phenomenal spread of Marxism.
The property of a handful of revolutionary exiles little
more than a century ago, today it guides one-third of
mankind in the socialist countries. It has tens of mil-
lions of adherents in the non-socialist world. The dom-
inant powers of the old capitalist order have employed
all their intellectual resources to “refute” Marxism.
They have employed their formidable police apparatus
to suppress it. They have employed. their military
might to crush it. Yet it grows. The rulers of America
have repeatedly declared Marxism dead. They have
branded it as alien to this land. But this program is
itself one of many proofs that Marxism is deeply im-
bedded in our soil. Here, as elsewhere, it is linked with
an irrepressible striving for freedom.

Frightened by this phenomenon, unable to under-

69

stand it, defendersof the old order resort to the absurd
theory of “conspiracy” to explain it. This is the ulti-
mate rejection of history as a rational science. It is also
the ultimate expression of contempt for human beings,
for it asserts that hundreds of millions are embarked
upon social revolution, with all its trials and hazards,
by the mere manipulation of conspirators.

Another sort of accusation is also levelled against
Marxism. Since it asserts that social development pro-
ceeds according to laws that are independent of human
will, it is said that Marxism dismisses or belittles
human will, that it is a fatalistic theory. Such an argu-
ment totally misconceives the function of science.
Man's discovery of natural laws does not produce
fatalistic resignation to the forces of nature. On the
contrary, fatalism was most pronounced when people
were ignorant of natural laws. But with the advance of
science people have erected ever more effective bar-
riers to natural calamities. Similarly, people had the
will to fly centuries ago, but only through mastery of
natural laws did the desire become a reality. Human
will is chained by ignorance. It is released by scientific
knowledge.

Likewise, the greater the mastery of the laws of social
development, the greater the range for the effective
expression of the human will. Those who exalt human
will as absolute in reality reduce it to nothing. For
without scientific understanding of both possibilities
and limitations for expression of human will at any
given stage of social development, it can be rendered as
futile as Canute’s command for the tides to halt. Marx-
ism elevates human will and aspiration and enhances
their effectiveness as forces for social progress by arm-
ing them with the consciousness of the laws which
surround them.

The development of Marxism is an inseparable part
of the overall advancement of scientific knowledge.

70

Marx and Engels developed their theory utilizing and
building upon the valid discoveries of their outstand-
ing predecessors in the fields of philosophy, political
economy, history and political theory.

Today, natural science is making tremendous
strides, investigating phenomena from the farthest
reaches of the universe to the near-infinitesimal. Its
application in industry, agriculture, communications
and energy is radically altering patterns of life around
the globe. The scientific outlook of Marxism-Leninism
can not be divorced from these great strides in the
physical and biological sciences. It is a revolutionizing
force because it expresses profound truths about nature
and society and their laws of development.

Like Darwin's theory of evolution and Einstein’s
theory of relativity, Marxism illuminates mankind’s
true place in nature. By showing for the first time the
laws governing the succession of social systems, and
proving the transient character of capitalism, Marxism
qualitatively raises the level of self-awareness of man-
kind. '

Marxism’s dialectical method of investigating the
causes of change—of seeking out opposing tendencies
within a given phenomenon—has proven to be of tre-
mendous use in the natural and the social sciences
alike. Consciously or not, scientists proceed by apply-
ing general laws of development to a particular field of
study. Therefore, scientific findings in diverse fields
confirm and elaborate the philosophy of dialectical
materialism.

By renouncing all forms of exploitative social rela-
tions and refuting the rationales which have justified
them, Marxism provides the basis ‘for freeing science
from the social prejudices which have often warped
and inhibited its development.

In socialist society, whose construction is guided by
the theory of scientific socialism, humankind is for the

71

first time organized in a fashion which permits the
unfettered development of science and its application
for the common good.

The scope of the intellectual achievement of Marx-
ism is all the more impressive because its advance is
bitterly resisted by the furious prejudices which are
summoned by the forces of privilege, oppression and
ignorance. ,

Like any other science, Marxism consists of conclu-
sions and laws tested in the laboratory of historical
experience. And, like any science, Marxism develops
and expands with the appearance of new phenomena,
with the accumulation of experience, with the en-
largement of knowledge. Indeed, its very methodol-
ogy, which requires that all things be studied in their
concrete form and in the process of change, demands
constant re-examination of its relationship to changing
realities. Dogmatism, which proclaims the revelation
of eternal truths, is directly contrary to the spirit of
Marxism. ‘

Marxism is not only rational; it is humanist inthe
best and most profound meaning of the term. It ex-
plains the world in order to change it for the better. It is
science in the service of humankind. It is compass and
weapon in the struggle of ourtime to liberate humanity
from the fetters of exploitation, oppression and war, to
attain the vast measureof abundance, knowledge and
freedom now within human reach.

economically and militarily. For a time it enjoyed a
monopoly on the atomic bomb. The corporate rulers of
the United States set out to dominate and exploit the
whole world. Their goal was an “American Century.”

U.S. corporations became the biggest “merchants of
death” in history. U.S. banks became the loan sharks of
world capitalism. Vast resources were committed to
maintain monopoly superprofits, to “roll back the bor-
ders of socialism” and to suppress national liberation
movements.

At home, a tremendous wave of repression was un-
leashed under the banner of anti-Communism. Many
of the gains which labor and Black people achieved in
the ’30s and ’40s were rolled back. Militarization and
the legal and repressive apparatus of a police state
grew rapidly. A

But the “American Century” concept was not based
on world realities, on the developing balance of world
forces.

The victory of the Russian Revolution in 191 7, in the
midst of the First World War, marked the first time the
working people succeeded in taking power and
abolishing capitalism. This ushered in the general
crisis of capitalism, the period of its revolutionary re-
placement. This transition from capitalism to
socialism is the main content of our epoch.

After the Second World War the Soviet Union, with
unprecedented speed, rebuilt its devastated industrial
base. Soviet science broke the atomic bomb monopoly.
A number of countries in Europe and Asia, and later in
Latin America and Africa, took the socialist path.
Socialism became a world system.

Anti-colonial and national liberation victories oc-
curred throughout the world. Instead of moving into
the orbit of the “American Century,” the formerly
colonized peoples struck out on the road of indepen-
dence.

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     

 

 

Rival capitalist countries rebuilt their economies
and moved away from complete U.S. imperialist
domination.

And despite the repressions, the anti-Communism
and the war hysteria whipped up by the government
and mass media, the American people continued to
find ways to express their desire for peace, for social
progress and for democratic rights. The ‘Communist
Party was and is the staunchest and most consistent
advocate of these causes.

These developments seriously affected the role of
U.S. imperialism, both domestically and worldwide.
They began a new stage of the general crisis of
capitalism.

000

The ruling corporate powers resort to corruption,

‘ deceit and repression to control the electoral process,

to create divisions among the working class and
people, to combat the anti-monopoly movement and
weaken the people’s struggle for peace. They dominate
the two-party system and the city, state and federal
government apparatuses and use them for their private
enrichment and to defend their class privileges.

Corporate monopolies have meshed with govern-
ment to secure a new level of corporate power.
Capitalism has become state monopoly capitalism. The
military-industrial complex has emerged as the brutal
and corrupt hub of U.S. capitalism.

But there is a rising mood of resistance to corporate
power. It can be seen in the ranks of labor, among the
Afro-American and other oppressed nationalities, in
the expanding scope and depth of the peace move-
ment, in the women’s movement, in consumer and
environmental organizations and scores of other civic
