Howard Free After i’
Five Months in Jail 

DENVER—-Asbury Howard is free after serving‘
five months of his six-month sentence on an Alabama ‘_ ,
work gang. He was jailed in Bessemer Feb. 23 for ad-
vocating the right of his Negro neighbors to register "

and vote.

His return to active duty
as Mine-Mill International
Vice President was reported
by Howard himself last month
in a personal telephone call
from Bessemer to President
John Clark soon after his re-
lease. Clark said Howard
plans to attend the Mine-Mill
officers’ meeting in Denver
Aug. 3 as well as the union’s
National Wage Policy commit-
tee ‘ meeting w h i ch follows
(See President Clark’s column
on Page 4.)

Howard at the same time
resumed his position as presi-
dent of the Bessemer Voters
league, a civic organization de-
voted to the encouragement of
Negro registration for voting
in political elections. It was
in that capacity that Howard
had ordered the painting of a

- canvas poster to be hung in

the hall of the Voters League
which resulted in his arrest.
PRAYER ,

The poster, confiscated be-
fore it ever left the painter’s
shop, reproduced a cartoon
from the Kansas City Call

’ which showed a Negro in

chains saying: “Lord help all
‘Americans to see that you in-
tended human beings to have
the same rights.” Beneath,
Howard had placed the slogan:
“Vote Today for a Better To-
morrow.” ‘

Following his arrest, the
civic and community leader
was severely beaten by a mob
of white men, as police officers
looked on, while he was still
in the’ Bessemer city hall on
the floor below the courtroom
in which he was sentenced to

six months in jail and fined’

Explosion

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)
MCGILL, Nevada——
Twenty-nine members of
Mine-Mill suffered minor
injuries July 5 when a,-
giant converter blew up, -
at the Kennecott Copper
company smelter here.
Damage was estimated
at $90,000. -
The explosion appar- -
ently was caused by
water condensation in
the air lines leading to
the converter during the
Independence Day shut-
down. When the opera- _
tion was started up on
the 5th the water hit the
hot copper and blew up.
A three-ton cover on
the converter was blown-
through the roof and
over into a nearby park-a -
ing lot. The converters
were loaded and molten
copper spewed “all .over
the place,” according to'__'
a witness. .
That none of the work-' -
ers was killed or seri-._
ously hurt was termed
“amazing.” No one lost
a shift. ~

BUTTE, Mont. -- The Ana-
conda C o m p a n y has been
ordered to arbitrate — an im-
portant pensioners’ grievance
issue which has been fought
by Mine-Mill for more than
four years.

This was the effect ofa far-
reaching legal victory won by
the union in a decision handed
down June 30 by the United
States Court of Appeals in San
Francisco. The decision af-

firmed a previous ruling
issued in Butte March 3, "1958,
by U. S. District Judge Wil-
liam D. Murray.

At issue was the Anaconda

‘ company’s refusal‘ to arbitrate

union grievances concerning
the discharge of 68-year-old
employees before their eligi-
bility was established for pen-
sion benefits under the Mine-
Mill contract.

Union Wins Ainoconcla Pension

Under the Pension plan, the
company took the position that
it could fire workers at age

68 even though they had not .

yet had 15 years of service and
thus were not entitled to pen-
sions. Mine-Mill disputed this
and took the position that
since this was not a correct in-
terpretation of the pension
plan, the involuntary retire-
ment of such ,Workers
amounted ~to improper dis-

lems.

This was the principal conclusion reached
in a conference here on July 7 between repre-.
sentatives of Mine-Mill and a touring labor-
management‘ group from Japan engaged in a
study of metal mining productivity in the’

‘ United States.

Escorted by US. government officials, the
study team has been visiting mining proper-
ties in the west and, arriving in Denver, paid
a visit to Mine-Mill President John Clark at
International headquarters. The team had al-
ready inspected American mining and smelt-
ing operations in Butte and Anaconda, Mont. ;
Kellogg, Idaho; Arizona, and Utah.

Members of the Japanese group which
called upon Clark included the following:

3-HOUR SESSION

Because the Japanese team had limited
time and a crowded schedule, Clark and the
.Mine-Mill staffers refrained from any lengthy
inquiry on the Japanese metal mining industry,
relinquishing the bulk of the three-hour meet-
ing to answering questions by the Japanese
unionists and employers.

In. reply to preliminary questions by Mine-
Mill representatives, the Japanese visitors did
inform the American unionists that silicosis is
still a grave problem in Japan, that the indus- - 1' »

When the company» refused 

to ‘arbitrate the issue, contend-

ing that the involuntary termi-  
nations were not arbitrable, 
the union brought legal suit in J

Helps Darlene

Little Darlene Ramos, age 5,
is coming along fine at the
National Jewish hospital In
Denver where she is to under-
go an extremely delicate op-
eration for a serious heart ail-
ment. The operation is sched-
uled for Aug. 10.

Darlene is the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Pat Ramos Jr.
of Miami, Ariz. Pat Jr. works
at the Sleeping Beauty mlne
near Miami. Darlene’s mater-
nal and paternal grandfathers,
Pat Ramos Sr. and Angel
Perez, are also from Miami
and are members of Mine-
Mill’s Miami Miners Union
No. 586.

Darlene and her parents ar-
rived in Denver July 14 after
arrangements for the trip and
her admission to the w0rld-fa-
mous hospital were made by
in
Miami including Mine-Mill. Or-
ville Larson, ' Mine-Mill Inter-
national vice-president, who
lives in Miami, had personally
urged Grandfather Perez to

contact the union’s ‘ headquar- .
in Denver and assured-

ters
the Ramos family of assist-
ance. - _

Perez called the Denver
Mine-Mill office by telephone
from Miami, so that when
Darlene and her parents ar-
rived by plane. in. Denver they
were met at the airport by a
member of the Mine-Mill office
staff who drove them to the
hospital which had already
been alerted to‘ Darlene’s ar-
rival. The Mine-Mill staff
member then assisted Mr. and
Mrs. Ramos to get a room
close by where they are now
settled while Darlene is in the
hospital.

Doctors at the hospital, spe-
cialists in this type of heart
surgery, are hopeful of the

, operation’s success. They say

Darlene is an excellent patient.

Ifresident-'5 Corner:
Does It Move?
It Ain't Company

S THIS is being written in late July, col-
lective bargaining in the nonferrous metals
industry can be characterized as a “stalemate.”
At least, this is the popular headline term for

A‘  negotiations in which no progress toward a

settlement has been made.
Actually, “stalemate” is not
quite an accurate term in
this instance.

Stalemate is a chess term
describing what happens
after play has been going
on for some time. It is that
moment in the game when
neither‘ player can make a
move to his advantage. But
—and this is important——a
stalemate occurs AFTER

 

-there has been some MOVEMENT by both

sides. _ _
Thus far in this year’s negotiations with the

major companies, all of the MOVEMENT has

been on the union's part. True, there have been

. a few twitches and spasms on the employer’s
- side of the table, but by and large the compa-

nies have been acting like so many Egyptian
mummies, for all the signs of life they have
been showing. Aside from the feeble spasms

- and twitches, none of the companies thus far

has made any serious attempt to initiate any

‘ move toward " genuine bargaining discussion.

.They’ve been talking, yes, but not about set-

, tlements.

Some of the companies have indicated that

‘they would like to, move —- backwards. They

seem to take the attitude that this is the year
to inaugurate a stripping process whereby
many of the hard-won gains of our members
can be taken away or watered down and their

already enormous profits inflated even fur- _

ther. An outstanding instance of this is the
hard-boiled attitude of the Anaconda company

in cancelling the hospital-medical programs in

its Montana operations. Another example is
the action of some of the employers in the
Coeur d’Alene district who would throw the

"rising cost of the welfare insurance program

on the workers and their families.
‘k * . *
UR UN ION is exhibiting a considerable
amount of patience. Despite the over-

' (whelming rank-and-file vote sanctioning strike

action, our committees have been trying peace-
ful persuasion to move the companies into a

0 position of give-and-take so that a settlement

can be reached. Our efforts to conﬁne the 1959
bargaining struggle to the negotiating table

_ have been treated with something akin to

scorn. It is apparent to me that some of the

I companies actually are trying to provoke a

strike. At least they are practicing a danger-
ous -bit of bargaining “brinkmanship”——trying

 to see how far they can push the union with-

out actually incurring a strike. -
A few days ago, the International Execu-

‘ tive-board’s top strategy committee on bargain-

ing met in Denver and concluded that the union

‘ should make one more try at effecting a set-
‘ tlement before I convene the National Wage

‘Policy committee for another emergency ses-
sion. Various bargaining committees received
our recommendation that the area of disagree-
ment. be narrowed—narrowed by our own initia-
tive. A specific program of issues and a settle-

ment figure on wage increases was projected.

If this latest attempt at adult bargaining

. also meets with company silence and immo-

bility, we plan to convene the Wage‘ Policy

I’ 5 committee early in August to formulate a plan
.of action that will stimulate bargaining beyond

the feet-dragging performance of the metal

‘ companies.

_ We are prepared to settle. We_are not

. waiting for settlements by other unions or in-

dustries. We do not intend to take our mem-
bers down the road of being “seconds” to other

workers in this country of plenty. As always, .

the principal issue we have to fight for this
year is the right of Mine-Mill members to en-
joy decency in living conditions as Americans.

* * ‘k
I WAS HAPPY to receive a telephone call
from Vice-President Asbury Howard on July
20.‘ He's out of jail and a free citizen again.
With all of the agitation and publicity around
his case, he still had to go through with the

. sentence and fine meted out to him.

Personally, and I know it is the feeling of
other officers as well, I have missed Brother
Howard’s presence and counsel a great deal.
To be imprisoned for the sole action of urging
his fellow citizens to register and vote and use
their inalienable right of franchise in the coun-
try he loves so much was a deplorable miscar-
riage of justice and will be a reflection against
-us until the remedy is forthcoming.

Asbury. can now carry out his obligations
and the -work he was elected to perform. We
need him. The whole International union wel-
comes" you back, Brother Howard! — JOHN

  House Getting a ‘Clean’ V.

Labor Bill for Action .

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

WASHINGTON, D. C.-As we go to press, the House La-
bor Committee -is in the process of reporting out what is known
as a “clean bill.” This bill is the House labor committee’s own
version of the Senate’s Kennedy bilL

The bill probably will be printed during the week of July

    

27, and no doubt will be reported to the floor of the House for

action during the same week.

At this point, it is difficult to determine exactly what the
bill contains. But, based on general inquiry and contact with
committee members, this bill is a milder form of the Senate-
passed Kennedy bill. At least it is now, before it has reached
the House floor. ‘ ~

Some of the modifications deal with removal of criminal
penalties for failure to complete reporting forms and instead
substitute use of civil court action for gross failure to complete
the reporting sections. -

In addition, the powers of the Secretary of Labor, extremely
wide in the Senate bill are considerably limited in -the House
bill. '

The Taft-Hartley “sweeteners” are retained in the House
version. The House bill clarifies the powers of the NLRB in
what used to be known as the area of “no man’s land.” This
is done by requiringthe NLRB to accept jurisdiction over all
labor dispute cases. Also, the board is enlarged to seven mem-
bers. '

But, the real test will come on the floor. It is then to
be seen whether or not a coalition of the northern -Republicans
and southern Democrats give us a bill far worse even than
the Senate Kennedy bill. ' x

We predict rough sledding for any “mild bill.”

The Forand Bill ,

The first serious group of ‘Congressional hearings on the

Forand bill (HR 4700), which would provide health insurance
for the aged took place in Washington beginning with the
week of July 13. '

Secretary of Health, Arthur S. Flemming, was the first wit-
ness. As could be expected, speaking for the administration, he

, came out in opposition to the bill. The Secretary claimed that

the cost of the Forand bill would upset the Social Security

apple cart. But, Secretary Flemming conceded that the prob- '

lem was a serious one, and that he had ordered a staff investi-
gation. . »

Also in opposition-were the American Association of In-
ternal Medicine, who referred to the bill as “socialistic,” the
American Home Nursing association, and the American Farm

Bureau federation. The Chamber of Commerce and the Ameri- '

can Medical association; as we have come to expect, are vigor-

_ ously opposed to thisvforward-looking legislative measure.

On the other hand, the AFL-CIO’s Social Security depart-
ment and several national unions -testified or submitted state-
ments in support of the measure. —

Mine-Mill’s position in support of the Forand bill is well-
known, and we are continuing to give active support to the
bill. (SEE STORY PAGE 3)

However, it now appears that these. hearings, taking place
before the Ways and Means Committee will not be decisive
for this session of Congress. ~ _

A major effort to pass the Forand bill will be made with
the beginning of the second session in January, 1960.

Civil Rights - ‘

Some forward progress was made when the Senate Ju-
diciary Subcommittee on Civil Rights passed, by a slim four to
three margin, a measure which now goes to the full Senate
Judiciary committee. Actually, the bill is a far cry from- the
Labor and Liberal call for an adequate civil rights measure. The
approved bill merely extends the life of the Federal Civil Rights
commission from its termination date in September, 1959,‘ to
the end of January in 1961. _

Actually, backers of civil rights legislation on the Senate’s
subcommittee were pleased to have any bill reported out. Civil
Rights backers are hopeful that the full Senate Committee on
Judiciary, as well as the Senate itself, in floor action will amend
the bill sufficiently to make it a worthwhile measure.——-HER-

Cheap Settlemeiit-it

Is an Illusion!

INCE assuming office as Secretary-Treas-_i,.

In addition to carrying out my old duties as 

chairman "of the American Brass Joint ‘-Bar--”_,;

gaining committee, I have been assigned the‘.‘
job of coordinator of the , .
AS&R council and am now
fully involved in AS&R ne-
gotiations. There are many
responsibilities a n d duties
with the Secretary-Treas
urer’s office I would like
to dig into, but bargaining
comes first. A

It seems the companies in
our industry ‘ are hanging
back, hoping a combination
of circumstances will con- ----------------------- 
tribute towards ‘a cheap settlement this year. K
This is an illusion. Our membership is in no
mood for cheap settlements. M »

The employers might as well accept the 

fact that there can be no “combination ofcir-p
cumstances” which will make us accept a set-_
tlement on their terms. The industry is mak-

ing money, lots of it. They made money during" j
the recession period of ’57 and '58. As a matter 

of fact, someof them expanded and grew fat-
ter during theso-called lean years. It was our :

membership, with the layoffs and short work 

weeks, who took the brunt of the recession,
not the companies.

  

Productivity in our industry has risen. The 1

companies are getting more out of fewer work-

ers. At the same time our wages are shrink- T ‘
ing. The cost of living keeps rising» all the -.

time.
‘k _* ilr

\..

0 COMPANY can claim that our wages ‘

have been a decisive factor in the basic _
pricing patterns in the industry. For example 2
the price of copper rose 331/o. per cent within . ~

the past nine months without any relationship;

to our wages. We received no wage increases
during that period. The only ones who. benefit- 
ed from the price increase were the companies,’ 

Perhaps the companies are waiting for the 

outcome of the steel strike. If the Steelworkers

stand firm, the steel companies are bound to 

be beaten. Aside from that, our, 1959 contract 9

demands are based on the needs of our mem-

bership and our settlement will be determined. 
on that basis, none other. »  

High profits, the need for our ‘members to V“

recoup losses incurred during the layoffs and ‘L

short weeks, vastly increased productivity, in-.‘‘:

creased living c_osts—these factors will not ‘

change in the immediate future. They willrel 
main in the negotiating picture and will not be" jj

“wished away” by the companies.

One thing is certain: our membership is _n,ot". 
going to be sitting around waiting because the \
companies are so busy counting their profits 
that they" cant’ find time to settle with their _ 

workers.-i—IRVING DICHTER.'

,Tough Companies

Cguse Steel Strike

Every major steel operation in the country remained

 shut down July 28 as the industry-wide strike of the

AFL-CIO United Steelworkers of America continued into

 ; itslthird week.

The union reported that more than 500,000 steel

Pgworkers in 24 states were
'7 idled by what it charged
, was an industry-forced strike
 begun July 14 after 10 weeks
 _'0f intensive negotiations failed
‘Vjto; wrench anything from the

companies except double-talk
“modest” wage in-

. _'mination of previously-won

 ion contract gains.
 ' An’ additional 45,000 workers

infrelated industries such as
coal, railroads and trucking

 were estimated to have been

laid off as a result of the

1 steel industry walkout.

BULK .OF INDUSTRY

. Business and other sources
listed 28 basic steel producers,
led by 12 of the biggest com-
panies, involved in the col-
lapsed negotiations. These rep-

9‘ ; resent about 85 percent of _U.

S. steel-making capacity. Big-

 gest among the industry lead-

ers are United States Steel,

 Bethlehem Steel and Republic
" iSteel which together account
' for 55 percent of the total
” national capacity. -

The AFL-CIO News laid the

 blame for the shutdown on the

industry’s get-tough attitude

 “and the atmosphere created
 by the Eisenhower adn1inistra-
‘ tion’s campaign on ‘inflation.’ ”

. It was the sixth time since

' the end of World War II that
‘ , the Steelworkers have been
 forced into nation-wide strikes
 in. order to secure contract
- settlements from the industry.-
. 5' The last one lasted 34 days in
 1956, for the present contract
 which expired June 30.

Bargaining began April 10

[1 this year, with industry nego-
 tiators

. wage freeze was necessary be-
 cause any pay boost would
 cause higher steel prices and
--_’C_ thus be “inflationary.” Man-
‘ ‘agement spokesman insisted

maintaining V that a

that a new agreement had to
in contract

“pave the
way for improvements in ef-

. .ficiency and the elimination of
>1 waste.” 1 ‘
 WANT FREEZE

According to the AFL-CIO
News, the industry’s rejection

 of Steelworkers pre-strike pro-
-‘posals “was based on its insist-

ence on at least a one-year
wage freeze with a reported

p but unspecified promise of
 fsome fringe benefits this year

and the possibility of a ‘mod-

 est’ wage hike next year, plus

changes in eight basic work
rules. that the union has

 » termed ‘eight-point chains . . .
*to enslave . . .

our members?’

; In signed newspaper adver-

ements throughout the
".1 untry, Steel union president
' avid J. McDonald called the

-r companies’ position on work
 rule , changes an “infamous 8-
5. point ‘Break the Union’ pro-
 Lposal . . . designed ‘to reduce
«-workers to industrial slaves,
‘-“subject to, the whims of man-
-agement.”

preaching about budget balanc

benefits workers have fought
for and won down through the
years.” McDonald also ac-
cused the steel companies. of
“an organized ‘plan to take
away individual rights of ev-
ery Steelworker . . . to push
us backward to conditions that
existed before 1936.”
WORKERS’ NEEDS

Pointing to the fact ‘that
millions of workers in other

major industries have already‘

received wage increases this
year, the Steel union bases its

demand for a reported 15-cent '

an hour package both on the
workers’ needs and the com-
panies’ clear ability to pay.
Profits and productivity are
the main factors supporting
the union's contract demands.
Net profits for leading steel
companies in the first three
months of 1959 were running
up to 25 percent ahead of any
Steel workers’
productivity has increased by

10 percent in the past year-

alone, creating considerable
unemployment in the industry.

The steel industry has raised
prices $3 for every $1 the com-
panies have granted in pay

raises. These facts well war»

rant higher wages without
higher prices, the Steel union
contends.

As the strike entered its 21st
day, Federal Mediator Joseph
F. Finnegan was continuing to
act as go-between for both
sides. Labor Secretary James
P. Mitchell had started his
own fact-finding mission‘ of
investigating the causes of and
facts relating to the dispute,
and will report his findings to
President Eisenhower.

Mine-Mill States 
Boost Jobless Aid 

DENVER—Major improvements in unemployment. ~
and workmen’s compensation benefits have been won by ,  ‘
labor this summer in legislatures on both coasts, where
Mine-Mill has local unions. More moderate gains were re=-_
corded in recent months on labor-backed measures in some »

midwest and Rocky Moun-

tain ' states. '
Marking the first time in 82

years that it has been con-

‘ trolled by a Democratic ma-

jority, the legislature in Con-
necticut wrote the following
improvements into the state’s
workmen’s compensation law:

Raised maximum benefits
from a flat $45 to 55 percent
of the state’s average produc-
tion wage and minimum bene-
fits from $15 to $20; removed
restrictions on the second in-
jury fund so it can now be
used in cases where there is
an increase in disability; es-
tablished a special fund to

guarantee benefit payments ‘
where employers or insurance --

carriers b e c o m e insolvent;
lowered coverage from em-
ployers with three or more
workers to those with two or
more, on a mandatory basis;
reduced the waiting period
from_ seven tothree days and
lowered the time an employee
must be ‘unable to work to
collect for entire period from
ten to seven days; improved
rehabilitation payments and
extended period in which
claims mustbe filed.
CALIFORNIA

Before adjourning June 19,
the California legislature
passed important
providing ‘maj or improve-
ments in unemployment and
workmen’s compensation as
well as in the state’s disabil-
ity program. Advances in the
California unemployment com-
pensation law included: a
maximum benefits increase

Labor Board Throws Out SecondSteel

Raid Petition at San Manuel Operation

SAN MANUEL, Ariz.—AFL-CIO Steel was handed its second setback within two
weeks at the big San Manuel Copper company operations here when the National La-
bor Relations Board threw out another Steel raid-attempt on Mine-Mill’s jurisdiction.

An election petition by Steel to sever some 65 heavy duty equipment operators

from the 1,500 workers represented by Mine-Mill Local 937 at San Manue1’s mine, mill ,

and smelter operations was
unanimously dismissed July
1 by the Labor Board in Wash-
ington.

Less than two weeks earlier
the same board had denied a
similar Steelworkers’ carve-
out petition involving approxi-
mately 120 workers in the San
Manuel smelter. Both peti-
tions were filed last April, and
served only to delay participa-

tion by the smelter and heavy .

equipment workers in Local
937’s c u r r e n t negotiations
with the company on an im-
proved contract.
BARGAINING

With the piecemeal raid out
of the way, the smeltermen
and operators were once more
united with the rest of Mine-
Mill’s San Manuel members at
the bargaining table.

Regional Director Jack C.

Marcotti, bargaining cooi'dina
tor ' for Mine-Mill Local 937
members at San Manuel and
Local 938 members at Magma
Copper in Superior which owns
San Manuel, said the NLRB
dismissed the petitions for
each of the units as inappro-
priate for severance either as
separate crafts or depart-
ments.

HAILS VICTORY -
Hailing the board's decision,
Local 937 President William N.
Key said: “It’s good that the
petition was dismissed, but had
it gone to an election Mine-
Mill would h ave shellacked

the Steelworkers in any elec-' '

tion held.”

K‘ey further pointed out that
the board’s ruling also makes
it impossible from now on for
any splinter group to carve

out a separate unit from Mine-

   , Cost of Living Climbs Again!

' >‘ The cost-of-living index, which rose steadily during 1956. 1957. and the first
halfiof 1958. was stabilized over the ten months from June 1958 to April 1959
within the narrow range of 123.7 to 123.9. (The average for 1947-49 equals 100).

. Last May the index broke into new high ground‘ at 124.0 and in_June it hit 124.5

.—up half a point in one month! Every maior category of expense went up in

‘June except clothing. which held steady. Even food prices. which havebeen fall-

, ing steadily since last summer iumped by more than one percent in a single

1.». month! This is a big increase. We hope this isn't the start of another of those

vjprice climbs. which seem to occur regularly despite Washington economists‘

ing and tight money. The cost of living is now at

 

Mill’s jurisdiction at San Man-

What Other Labor
 Unions Are Doing

;.V ., 351,?‘ -3.’-i..v'y'

35-Hour Work Week .

Organized hotel workers in New York scored a major con-
tract victory last month by winning the first 35-hour work
week in the hotel industry's history. Also negotiated by the
Hotel Trades council in a new three-year agreement covering
35,000 employees of 190 main New York hotels were wage 11'1-
creases and improved vacation, holiday and health and welfare

’ plans.

The 35-hour week with no reduction in pay will become

effective next year for engineering and maintenance department
.employees. Jay Rubin, Hotel Trades council president, said of
the settlement:

“With the introduction of the 35-hour week, we have erect
ed a bulwarkto protect the workers against the impact of

gygrowing automation in the industry. , In so doing, we feel we

have contributed to labor’s nation-wide effort to absorb some
of the impact of automation by establishing the 35-hour week.”

Teamsters

Unfair labor practice charges filed by the Teamsters union
against a Southern trucking company which used racial dis-
crimination to discourage union membership have been upheld
by the National Labor Relations board. The charges were filed
against Intracoastal Terminal company following the company’s
denial of two weeks paid vacation to Negro workers as a means
of discouraging their joining the Teamsters;

‘Before the Teamsters started organizing the company,

5 Negroes got one week’s vacation as against two for white em-

ployees. .The company made it two for Negroes just before an

NLRB election, but cut it back to one week after the 'l‘eamsters
won bargaining rights. A

NLRB Trial, Examiner Bruce Hunt, ruling in favor of the
union, said it could only be concluded that the company's
maneuver was designed to make it appear that the union’s

’ by presence was the reason for the vacation cut and thus discour-

age membership. . -

Clothing Workers

The 275,000-member -Amalgamated Clothing Workers union
July’? warned that the men’s clothing industry in the United
States and Canada faced destruction as a result of imports
from Japan and Hong Kong. A resolution adopted by the ACW
general executive board called for legislative controls over im-

- C A-ported goods produced under “sweatshop” conditions abroad.

’ , politics with a bill he introduced

  

 

Traditionally opposed to free trade restrictions, the union
declared that its present stand was dictated by the need to pro-
__tect its members and the industry against “cut throat compe-
tition” from foreign producers which threatened many thou-
-sands of jobs in the U. S. and the destruction of an important
American industry.

Two other AFL-CIO clothing unions joined with the ACW
in seeking the import restrictions——the International Ladies
-Garment Workers and the United Hatters, C_ap- & Millinery
Workers.

Coal Miners

_ United Mine Workers President John L. Lewis July 21
blasted Congressional tactics which he charged are delaying
enactment of legislation to broaden Federal coal mine safety
regulations. Appearing as a witness before a Senate labor
subcommittee hearing on mine safety, the coal miners’ leader
accused Senator John Sherman Cooper (R.,, Ky.) of playing
proposing a study of safety
_‘ problems in small coal mines.

Lewis said the study bill was a delay tactic to avoid action
until after the 1960 elections. He declared that “widows and
orphans a.re being created and death is coming to strong men

,“ before their time” from preventable accidents while talk was

still going on about more study of the need to do something
- about it. He hit at any delay in tightening safety laws when
statistics show that injury and fatality rates from accidents

7*‘ in mines not covered by the safety laws are 21/; times greater

than in others.

Auto Workers

“Flower funds” in the United Auto Workers appear to be
a new target for investigation by the Senate’s McClellan com-
mittee. Committee member Karl E. Mundt (R., ‘S. D.) an-
nounced July 16 that the committee plans a secret preliminary
investigation on July 27 to see if evidence about the UAW’s
“ﬂower funds” and other matters warrants public hearings.
The start of the hearings was later changed to Aug. 4.

According to the Associated Press,'UAW President Walter
Reuther told the committee last year that the UAW’.s “flower
funds” really are union campaign funds raised by voluntary
members’ contributions and are used mainly to ﬁnance the
campaigns of incumbent UAW officers, including himself, as
well as the campaigns of rivals, with each side having its own
flower fund.

Textile Workers

Eight officers and members of the AFL-CIO Textile Work-
ers union, charged with conspiring to dynamite buildings of
the struck Harriet-Henderson Cotton Mills in North Carolina,
were sentenced July 23 to prison terms of from two to ten
years. Three of the union men, including TWUA Vice President
Boyd A. Payton, were ordered jailed for from six to ten years
as ringleaders.

More than 1,000 members of two TWUA locals struck the
mills Nov. 17, 1958, when the company rejected the union’s re-
quest for renewal of the old contract without any changes.
The company demanded elimination of the contract’s long stand-
ing arbitration f procedure and inclusion of a no-strike clause.

 Imported strike-breakers and scabs have been operating the

Let's Join the Human RcIce 

Let's pretend that you have not yet been
born but will be born this year, somewhere on
the planet. And. let’s try to estimate your
chances of living a happy, healthy, decent and
useful life. .

If you are born this year, then on the same
day more than 200,000 other babies will be born,
all over the world. You will have less than one
chance in twenty of being born in the United
States.

You will probably be colored. Remember
that you and the 200,000 other squawking brats
who will be the day's baby crop are goingto be
born all over the planet and that there are
just not many openings in the places where
the white ‘race lives. You must t a k e your
chances with the other babies. And the chances
are, you will be colored——colored black, or col-
ored brown," or colored yellow.

Your chances of being born white this-year
are not more than one in three. Your chances

of being Chinese are one in four; of being born
in India, better than one in nine.

If you are born colored, youwill probably
be born among people who have recently re-
volted and thrown out the white folks or else
in a country that is still trying to throw the

white folks out. If you are born in Africa, you

are likely to learn the maxim: “Never trust a
white man.”

You have only about one chance in four of

being born a Christian. It is far more likely.
that you will be born a Confucian or a Bud- ’

dhist, a Mohammendan or a Taoist.

If you are born in the United States—and,
remember, that is quite an if——you will prob-
ably live longer than a year. But if you are

born in India, which is more likely, you have ,

only a little better than a one-to-four chance of ‘,
living more than a year. - ,
If you are born colored, the chances are
overwhelming that you will be chronically sick 2.
all your life——from malaria, or intestinal para? 3
sites, or tuberculosis, or maybe even leprosy. 
And even if you are not chronically sick, you ’
are likely to be weak from hunger. . . You have 
a reasonably good chance of experiencing_ real
famine-—to the point where you will be glad to "
eat the bark off a tree. .  - ‘i “ ‘
If you are born colored, you have only: .
one-to-four chance of learning to. read. And
since you almost certainly will notown a radio)‘,
you will be pretty well out off from that part‘-1‘
of the human family that has enough to seat 
and that is reasonably healthy. You will most “
likely live in a mud but, with a dirt floor and];

will almost certainly work on the land, "and

INDUSTRY NOTES  

; WORLD ZINC SMELTER capacity will be significantly in-
-creased according to several announcements in recent weeks.
.MATTIIlESSEN & HEGELER, Illinois-based zinc producer,
—.— plans to build a zinc smelter and refinery at Port Maitland, on
‘the! northern shore of Lake Erie. The new plant will handle
zinc concentrates from eastern Canada which were formerly
shipped to .U. S. plants. Leading producers in the Mattagami
:‘Lake district in Canada are also reported to be well advanced
with plans for a zinc smelter to serve mines in the district.
 "Final decision to’ go ahead at Mattagami has yet to be reached
. ‘L. fhowever. /

 - _’ The Mexican Government announced meanwhile that it will
 build a smelter to handle about 70,000 tons of zinc per year, or

‘ nearly’ one-third of Mexico’s annual mine production.

A V The Canadian and Mexican developments will mean a
 ’inkage in the sources of ores and concentrates upon which

  wrong,But- --  

Recently U. 8. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of
Minnesota, made a speech in the U. S. Senate on the
American labor movement: what it has done, what
it is, what it stands for. The following are ‘excerpts
from his speech: ‘ - .

Byill. 5. Senator ‘Hubert H.’ Humphrey

For two years now we have been hearing much-

; about what’s ‘wrong with the American labor move-
* ment. A sordid’, frightening, loathsome image‘ of

that labor» movement has emerged from the hun-
dreds, ‘the. thousands of editorials and cartoons, the

countless speeches about corrupt labor ‘officials,

Mr.‘ President, I rise today to discuss what's
right withthe American laborimovement. If there
is any ‘area of human behavior where the dog-bites

. man formula is true, it is the.area of labor relations.

How often do we read articles about labor" peace?
-How often are editorials written about honest labor
leaders? Isn't it true that a $10,000 union contribu-
tion to a worthy charity is less newsworthy than. a

$100 bribe toa cheap crook? How often does a na-

tional magazine do a feature story on building trades-
men contributing their weekends to the rebuilding

. __ ofa school or a hospital destroyed by fire?

But there seems never to be a shortage of front

1 ‘ page space or editorial space when a strike is called,
j .or_ when some violence flares, or ‘ when a union
 official is called before an investigating committee.

.NoW, I do not want- to be misunderstood. I think

' strikes and violence and labor corruption are worthy
of public attention. I think the public should be

it , informed about the issues in a strike, why violence

results, which union officials have violated their
trust. But the public should also have the full story
of what decent, honorable, devoted trade unionists
are doing day by day for their ‘fellow men, for
country, and the cause of freedom in a troubled
world. ' »

Many of our finest economists, political scientists,
sociologists, and philosophers have written at length
about the basic meaning and goals of trade union-
ism. I think that the Hebrew Elder, Hillel, many
centuries ago, said it all-in one briefcomment:

“If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But
if I am only for myself, what am I?” n

This is the real story of American labor. Work~
ing men and women have banded together to further

‘ their mutual interests. If they failed to- do it for

I j their unionls legislative institutes.

G ‘irresponsible force. .  .

 Provide Forum _ .  . _.
Union organizations have provided for millions of »
’ formerly inarticulate citizens the forumvin which- to-

press conferences and enthusiastic applause.
‘perhaps the most stimulating periods I ever spend .
are the 20 to 30 minute sessions I have with groups‘

. 1 of textile workers or rubber Workers, machinists,
._ building tradesmen, auto workers, retail or commu-
nication workers who come to Washington to attend ,.

-themselves,‘ who would do it for them? But they

could notbe concerned. with their...p1:9b1s.rn$ .a1..0_1.1e-.

If they were only for" themselves, what.—ys_I.e1;e ,they_,? 

 ‘ . _It ‘is a tragic fact indeedqthatp the‘-recent disclo-

sures before the Senate Select Committee V "on" Im? ‘ "

 proper Activities in Labor-Management Relations, _
in the absence of adequate publishing of the ztotal

, labor story in.America, have led many people to be-

lieve that the labor movement is a

nat row, selfish,

hammer out policies affecting the world in which

they live and which their children will inherit. And
not only have they hammered out policies, but they
- ‘have developed techniques and resources for imple-
_‘ menting those policies. That is what‘ I find so right
 about ' the labor movement. They have made “de- 4
-, mocracy” and “citizenship” and “the ‘right to-peti-'

tion” a reality to millions of men and women.

I speak from some rich personal ‘experience. Like
every politician, I enjoy large audiences, television,

who need this additional protection. A growing num-

ber of union workers, as a matter of fact, look to

surance for their own protection. Don’t all wage '

earners in the nation deserve’ adequate protection
against the hazards of unemployment?

Are not these desirable social goals?

the public interest? " ' .

0 Labor seeks depressed areas legislation, help

we welcome such support?

America's farmers, such as R.E.A.,‘ and it backs
legislation to preserve the family-size farm. Is not
this in the best interest of our country?

0 Labor favors legislation designed to promote a
vigorous and healthy climate for small business. Is
not such promotion of our free enterprise system in
the public interest? - -

But I want to move on to another thing that I H

think is so right with the American labor movement.

On March 26 I introduced Senate Resolution. 96»

expressing the Senate’s backing of our negotiations
in Geneva looking to a meaningful inspect-ion-proof
agreement on suspension of nuclear tests. I hoped
for early approval for this resolution, an approval
that I did get expeditiously and unanimously. It was

not a matter on which I expected much public"

activity. It was particularly gratifying to me; there-
fore, to receive a telegram from Mr. George Meany,
president of the AFL-CIO, expressing support for
the resolution and indicating that he had wired

union, pointed out that there
had been years of affiliation
with the American Federation
of Laborand ‘that disagree-
ment over policy. had twice led

- to disaffiliation. Thus, for sev-

eral periods .during its history,
the union had operated on an
independent basis similar to
that of the present time, and,

because one disaffiliation was ‘

brought about by the miners
union favoring the industrial
type of union, Mine-Mill was
one of the first unions to join
'and help organize the Con-
gress of Industrial Organiza-
tion- _ ’ ' '
Thibault said that in "spite
of newspaper. propaganda the
real reason Mine-Mill was ex-
pelled from'the Canadian
. Congress of Labor was the re-
-fusal of the national conven-
tion to obey a Congresses’ or-
der which called for a deliver-
ance of the Timmins and Port
Colburn Locals to the United
.. Steelworkers of America.

“Refusal to obey. this order

S was the only reason the Union

was expelled and its official

reason shown on the Con-

gresses minutes,” Thibault re-
minded the membership.

The C a n a d ia n president
stressed that.it. was the feel-
. ing of the leaders of the union
at all levels provincial, nation-
. al and local that organized la-
, bor in Canadacould best serve
and further the interest of its
membership if all‘ branches
were united in one “House of
Labor.” ’

Thibault pointed out that al-
though some members had
reservations about the bene-

fits of congress affiliation, it
must recognize ’ that Mine-Mill

. being one of the oldest unions
on the American continent had

-a valuable contribution which
it could make were it to be-
come part. of the so-called‘

- mainstream of labor, and

that this could be“ sufficient

— reason in itself for making the
application.

Brother Thibault said he
wanted the membership to
clearly understand _ that even
in event that the referendum
carried by a big vote in the af-
firmative as was -the hope,
that this by no means meant
automatic inclusion in the
Congress. ,

‘This could only be brought
about through further negotia-
tions with the leadership of
the Congress and it was
hoped that strengthened by
the results of the vote that the
national executive would be
able to have further meetings
with the Congress and arrive
at affiliation terms whic h
would be ready for presenta-
tion at ‘the September national
convention of the union. Such
terms must for necessity in-
clude the three stipulations set
out on the ballot.

Archbishop of

Sdutli Africa       \

Calls Bias Grave,-Moral  

EDITOR’S Note: Theifollowing is aaai;--;i¢1ein the

August issue of Work, a Catholic labor paper; by-Arch--

bishop Denis E. ‘Hurley, O.M.I., of Durban, Union’ of
South Africa. In publishing the article, W,o’r_k’s, editors
commented that “one of the untold storiesof our time

is the valiant struggle that
the Catholic and Anglican
bishops of the Union of South
Africa are making against the
government’s policy of ‘com-
pulsory racial segregation .

‘apartheid’ (pronounced apart-
hate).” Work says ‘the moral

case that Archbishop Hurley,

builds “applies, of co’ur_se,’,not
only to South Africa but to
the United States.” '

A very common reaction to
an argument against the
color bar is to contend that
color is only a secondary. con-
sideration and that the real
reasons for discrimination in
South Africa lie in the cul-
tural and economic differences
between European and non-
European. To counteract this
maneuver I shall attempt‘ to

establish the paramount im-.

portance of the color prejudice
as the major issue of discrim-
ination in our country. .

I do not deny that there are
cultural and economic differ-
ences. I do not deny’ that there
are sections of ourypopulation
that have practically nothing
in common beyond the basic
fact of their human nature,
sections like the white urban
bourgeoisie and Africans of
the deep reserve. If such di-
verse sectionswere of the
same race and color, it would
still be a problem to blend
them into a homogeneous so-
ciety. That has to be admitted.

But the big obstacle to ‘ the

creation of a single society is
not that the -African of the
deep reserve is still living at
a tribal tempo, or that the In‘-
dian has a Muslin ‘or 'Hindu
tradition and way of life, or
that the colored man is very
often a poor "man. The big ob-
stacle to the single society is
the color prejudice _ of the
white man. i V
Again I do not deny that the
African or the colored or the

‘Indian may have his racial

antipathies. They do exist and
it would be foolish to. deny
them, but they contribute little
in comparison with the color

‘prejudicerof the white man to

South Africa’s social problem.

§re90F., .  .. . ., .
r <-1‘he1“ proof ‘_‘of. this  very ‘-

' simple. No matter what the

cultural or financial condition
of the non-European may be,
he is still not ‘accepted as a
member of the South: African
community. I, hazard_a guess
that there mu_st be well over
a million non-whites (perhaps
nearly two million), with a
standard of education entitling
them to full, participation in
the political, economic, and
cultural life of the country.
They are denied this par-
ticipation solely on account of

the color of-their skin..I have .

used the words “denied this
participation.” B e h i n d this
seemingly innocuous expres-
sion lies the iniquitous. tale of
Land Acts, Industrial Conciliw
tion Acts, Group. Area Acts
(laws relating to territorial
and economic» segregation),
franchise discrimination, job
reservation, and the rest of
the sorrowful litany of preju-

dice-inspired legislation.

Now the essential evil of the
color prejudice of the white
man is that it is a sneer at the
man of the dark skin. It is an
assumption that the non-Euro-
pean is by the very fact of his
racial origin inferior, that he
is not worthy of the considera-
tion accorded.to members of a
higher order of human beings,

- namely, the white: man; that

because of the inherent inferi-

. ority of the non-E u r opean
. there is every justification for
, social, economic, cultural, and

political discrimination.

' HUMILI-ATION

Such e_olo r prejudice pro-
duces a social order in which
millions of people are subject
to constant and inescapable
humiliation. Humiliation is the
ordinary condition of existence
for these people, the very at-
mosphere they breathe.

The infliction of unjustified
humiliation on a fellow-man is
a terrible offence against the
law of love. It is also an act of
injustice, for. a man has a
right to enjoy the conscious-
ness of his human condition,
the realization of his dignity
as a creature and child of God,

Human dignity is the value
constituted by t-hese-attributes,
the inherent worth of the hu-
man person founding the right i
to respect. Any un~justifiable.,~._.,
derogation from his dignity is
an act of injustice, an invasion
of the peaceful possession and
enjoyment of the human con-
dition.

That is why color prejudice
is so obnoxious. It does not
merely hurt a man in one or

- more of his freedoms. It hurts

him in the foundation of his
freedom, the source of his

,rights, the essence of his

being, his very humanity. Con-
sidered in this light, there‘ is
only one worse injustice to
man; the crime which is the
very destruction of his person,

namely, murder.

msroav or DISPUTE

The dispute over the com-
pany’s 68-year-old worker fir-

'_ings first arose at the Mon-

tana Anaconda properties
1955. _
Precedent for the Montana

I court action was set early in

1957 when Mine-l\Iill’s Buffalo,
N. Y., Brass & Copper Work-

, ers Union No. 593 won a crucial

UNION UPHELD

Arbitrator Hyman upheld

the union’s position that the

company did not have the
right of mandatory retirement

‘of workers at age 68 unless

they had 15 years of service
and were thus entitled to the
pensions. The four men re-

ing nearly $11,000 for work
lost, plus retroactive and then-
current pension benefits due
them from the time their 15
years of service with the com-
pany became effective under
the pension agreement.

Although the specific case
directly involved only the Buf-
falo American Brass plant and
Local 593, the decision to take
it to arbitration was made by
the National Anaconda Confer-
ence which consists of Mine-
Mill and locals of several other
international unions holding
contracts with the Anaconda
company throughout the coun-
try where the pension and col-
lective bargaining agreements
are similar.

Two main points were made
by Witt in his brief to the San
Francisco Appeals court on
the Anaconda pension case: 1)
that the discharges of the Mon-
tana employees were griev-

’ ances arbitrable under the
Mine-Mill collective bargaining
agreements and that the com-

pany was wrong, in trying to i

make it appear that the union
sought to compel arbitration
under the pension plans; 2)
that termination of employ-
ment was arbitrable under the
collective agreements and that
the fact that the pension plans
are in separate agreements
was irrelevent.

That the court agreed is evi-

denced by its decision affirm- ‘

ing Judge Murray's ruling in
favor of the union. '

“the union’s demands are way,
way out.-” Attempts to get the
companies talking in any se-
rious vein were frustrated «by
the industry’s common rou-
tine——talking and saying noth-
ing in the process. Stalemated
negotiations were the result.
It was to keep the bargain-
ing machinery in motion that
the union revised its demands
in order to be able to present
proposals for settlement that

kaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, and that Japa-
nese ore miners are retired at age 55. Other
information vollmteered was that zinc mining
was badly hit economically, but that 99 per
. cent of Japanese mine production is consumed

domestir-.ally.

Wage rates of Japanese miners rank 13th
among workers in major industries, a figure
considerably below that of metal mining in the
United States, where miners earn more than
in most manufacturing industries.

RESPONSIBILITY

Of considerable interest to Clark and his
committee was the revelation that Japanese
metal mining employers seem to possess a
greater sense of responsibility toward their
workers than in the U.S. Both Japanese union-
ists and employers in the conference confirmed
the fact that metal miners. are hired for life
and that, in the event. of shutdowns, companies
- do not dismiss the workers, but co-operate in
getting them relocated in other jobs. Even in
good times, they said, Japanese mines still are
not in 100 per cent production. Higher produc-
tivity is being sought by both employers and
unions. At the highest point of production,
Japanese metal mines produce only 40 per cent
of the domestic demand. An incidental piece
of information was that the Japanese can buy
zinc cheaper on the market in New York than

they can’ in Japan.

The trade union visitors, Higashi and Talia-
matsu, exhibited considerable interest in Mine-
Mill’s democratic procedures as outlined in
constitutional provisions on elections of offi-
cers, dues, per capita-, strike votes, conventions,
and administration. They asked detailed ques-
tions on such things as the composition of the
International Executive board, the administrw

in the three-hour session.

In addition to President
Clark's expression of gratifi-
cation in behalf of the union,
Howard also received a mess-
age from the Mine-Mill Cana-

dian National Executive board. ,

GREETED

' Several hundred persons
greeted Howard as he stepped
from the automobile of his
Bessemer attorney David H.
Hood, Jr. on his way home
from jail. Responding to the
cheering throng, he declared

that the fight for first class ‘

citizenship had just begun and
that “we as Negroes cannot let
up for a minute lest we lose
a few gains already accom-
plished.”

“The cost of freedom comes
high and- we must all be will-
ing to pay the price,” Howard
told the crowd. “Though I

did not leave such a large area
of disagreement.

STRIKE ALARMS

the union alone had been mak-
ing overt moves for a settle-
ment, the nation's press last
month suddenly raised the

- alarm over what it called a “

“threatened strike in nonfer-
rous metals.” Particularly ac-
tive in the alarm business was

ill-will ‘toward anyone for the
unjust suffering I_ have been
caused; it is but a small part
of the cost ‘of first-class
citizenship that I had to pay
for the liberation of my

everywhere.” '

Howard said: “I am not re-.

treating nor am I discouraged,
but will work even harder to
help obtain first-class. citizen-
ship of all my people. If I
am wrong in this, then the
Constitution of the United
States and the officials of the

federal government who en-

are also Wrong.”

He thanked “the people of

Reporters from all over the
country were calling the un-
ion’s headquarters here as the
nonferrous negotiations con-
tinued and as the giant strike
dragged on in the steel indus-
try with its serious impact on
the national economy. In an-
swer to reporters’ questions
about whether Mine-Mill was
