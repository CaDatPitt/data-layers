  PROGRAM      
of the National Student League
PREAMBLE. ‘

THE economic forces which are causing the disintegra-
tion of‘ capitalism are at the -same time destroying the
security of the American student. The present economic
crisis brings the student body face to face, with serious
problems which require immediate attention. These are in
the main problems of present income and future employ-
ment. At the same time the danger of impending wars adds
to a sense of insecurity. .

The right of the student to an education is threatened by
the wave of economy now sweeping our schools and col-
leges. Dwindling resources at home and fewer opportunities
for part—time work at school are forcing many students to
give up their studies. Many who do complete their educa-
tion have little chance to use their training and skill under
existing conditions. Every graduation day sees thousands
of' students joining the unemployed or entering unskilled oc-
cupations. This holds true despite the fact that millions of
people are in vital need of their services.

For certain sections of the student body, particularly the
Negro students, these problems are even more accentuated.
Because of their status as members of oppressed minorities
they are confronted with the added problems of discrimina-
tion and segregation.

In dealing with these issues, students ﬁnd old methods of
approach no longer relevant._ To meet present conditions
new weapons and new forms of action are required. Their
immediate situation demands that students organize to de-
fend their present interest. Their future prospects f-orce
them to realize that along with the impoverished intellectuals
they must even now align themselves with the working class

10

 

 

 

 

 

for unity in the struggle for’ common interests; and to re-
cognize that although it is possible to win certain immediate
improvements, only change in the very basis of society can
offer any permanent solution to their mutua_l problems. Im-
pelled by a sense of common cause with the workers, stu-
dents have participated’ inworking class activity.

We ﬁnd students directing their energies more and more

“towards united action in defense‘ of their immediate interests.

In many cities stuidents" haveorganized resistance to re-

«trenc‘hr’nen3t in education.. In numerous polls they have voiced

 

their opposition to imperialist war. This has found further
expression in the struggle against the R.O.T._C, and other
forms of war preparations in the schools. In conducting
these activities students meet administrative suppression in
the form of suspensions and expulsions, as well as other
drastic attacks on academic freedom. Experience has shown
that students can meet these situations through militant mass
action. . . ..

The National Student League is the organized expression
of the requirements of the student body. It organizes and
leads the students in securing their demands through mass
action. The interests of the. N .'S'.L. are;-th-ose of the large
majority of the student body. It combats all forms of dis-
crimination tending to divide the student body.. It appeals
to students of all races and nationalities, regardless of re-
ligious or political_ affiliation to join in struggle for their
immediate demands.

WPOLICIESI
Against Retrenchment, For the Right to a Free Education

Faced with decreasing sources -of revenue, state and muni-
cipal governments are balancing their budgets at the expense
of education. This has been brought about by the organized
pressure of large property owners, bankers and wealthy tax
payers. The revenues of private institutions have also been
reduced. v I .

Hundreds of schools have been“ shut down altogether,
while others have been crippled by drastic reduction in their

'-“:11

 
 

 

teaching staffs. At the same time attempts are made to raise
the present charges, to introduce fees where none have ex-
isted, and to reduce the number of scholarships. Thse eco-
nomies have the effect of‘ restricting education more and
more to a privileged minority. Here, as elsewhere the-bur-
den of retrenchment falls on the shoulders of those who can
least afford it.

Students can effectively resist this policy only if they are
organized. Further, an organized student body alone can
provide the militant leadership required to unite parents,
teachers and other groups behind the struggle against re-
trenchment. ’

In its campaign against retrenchment in education, the
N.S.L. makes the following demands:

I. Free universal secondary education.

2. No economies at the expense of education and educa-
tional facilities.

No shortening of the school term.

No reduction of teachers"salaries and teaching staffs.
Free four ‘year colleges in every city of 1oo,oo or over.
No increase in tuition charges and fees.

Federal aid to education.

Special taxes on concentrated wealth t-o support schools
and colleges. ‘ '

9. Federal relief for needy students.

10. Adequate provision of evening school facilities for
worker-students.

A gainst Fascism

The American students must learn from the experiences
of those of their ‘European brothers who have been tricked
int-o the ranks of fascism. Many have accepted all too easily
the glowing promises of those who seek to establish the open
and most ‘brutal dictatorship.of capital. Fantastic promises
to nationalize the banks, to supply work for all, and to curb
the predatory ravages of ﬁnance capital, cannot be and never
are fullﬁlled by fascism. “ e ' i
Fascism brings no change in the economic basis of

12

 

 

 

society. Rather, is it a desperate effort of the capitalist class
to retain its hold on the political and economic organism.
Intensifying military preparations and all forms of national-
ism, and increasing existing economic rivalries,» fascism
brings nearer the outbreak of war. .

Fascism does not solve the.economic problems of the stu—
dent. It leads on the contrary to the most drastic curtail-

‘ ment of educational facilities. In Germany, the Nazis seek

 

 

 

to reduce the number of students in institutions of higher
learning frm 130,000 to, 15,000, with special reductions in
the number of women. students. Focusing its attack on all
organizations of labor, fascism also stultiﬁes and destroys
s-cience and art. a .

The developments which have taken. place under the N.
R.A._. such as the centralization of government powers, the
legalization of wage differentials for Negro workers, the es-
tablishment of the supposed community of interests of capital
and labor, at the same time that machinery is established to
prevent strikes and to enforce state control over labor or-
ganizations, are similar to the fascist institutions in Italy’
and Germany. Hitler points to the similarity between his
treatment of the Jews and the persecution of the Negro
people in the United States.

Fascist and semi—fascist organizations, encouraging lynch
violence, have arisen in various parts of‘ the country. Nazi
propagandists are active in American Universities.

The National Student League ﬁghts against all fascist or-
ganizations on the campus, because these groups work against
the interests of the student body. Demagogy, the stock-in-
trade of fascism must be exposed, and all fascist student
groups must be driven from the campus. To raise the ques-
tion of academic freedom for the fascist is to favor the open-
ing of the ﬂood-gates of poisonous race theories and anti-

Working class and student doctrines. It means, in practice, .

abandoning the concrete, day to day struggle against fascism
on the campus. We ﬁght for student rights and for their
prerogatives not abstractly but in order that they may be

able to defend their interests and win their demands. VVe
ﬁght for student rights against those who would be ﬁrst to
deprive the students of‘ their rights-to an education.

The N.S.L.. conducts an uncompromising struggle against
fascism and every trend in that direction in the United States.

Against Race Discrim-i1iati0n; For Equal‘ Rights
A for Minorities
The Negro students are c-onfronted with special problems
arising from their status as part of an oppressed people. In
the South the Negroes are barred from the institutions pro-
vided for whites and herded into separate schools which are

woefully inferior and inadequate. In seventeen states and

in the District of Columbia only one fourth as much money
per capita expended for white students islallowed for Negro
students. In the North where no such discrimination is sup-
posed to exist, Negroes are excluded from a number of
schools and are deprived of the use of many facilities in
others. The lot of the Negro students who wish to work
their way through school _is made doubly hard by the fact
that they are usually barred from all but the most menial and
least remunerative forms of employment.

Because of this it is important that Negro students be or-
ganized. Because of their comparatively greater freedom,
it is the duty of white students to take the initiative in the
struggle to break down these barriers of‘ race prejudice and
discrimination which tend to divide the student body and
weaken its ﬁght. ‘Only through the unity of Negro and
white students cantheir common ends be attained.

Jewish, Catholic and foreign-born students are subject
to similar forms of discrimination both in the allotment of
jobs and in admittance to educational institutions.

As a basis for the solution of these problems the National
Student League demands:

I. Equality of students of every race, color, creed and na-
tionality. ‘

2. The abolition of segregation in education, admission
of Negroes to all institutions, educational and social.

,_-3.. That pending the establishment of complete equality
throughout» the educational system, equal appropriation per
capita _be alloted to both Negro and white.

4. Equal impartial opportunities for employment.
5. Destruction of all illusions -of race supremacy as fos-
tered by our educational system; discarding of school texts

derogatory to the Negro. .

Agdinst Suppression of Student Thought and Action

With the development of militant student activity, aca-
demic freedom takes on new meaning. It no longer sgniﬁes
the mere right to discuss and talk, nor is it any longer the
exclusive concern of isolated discussion circles. It now means
freedom to act in defense of student interests. Academic
freedom now concerns all students. The ﬁghts for academic
freedom is accordingly an integral part of our activity.
' We, therefore, resist the wholesale expulsions of students
and faculty members, the banning of student clubs and news-
papers, the abrogation of student self—government and all
other methods used by administrations in an effort to stem
the rising tide of student struggle.

The National Student League -ﬁghts:

I. For freed-om of speech and freedom ofcriticism for
students and. faculty members.

2. For a student press free from censorship.

3. For the right of students to organize," petition, hold

meetings, or conduct strikes, on or off the campus.

4. Against forcing students under duress to sign away

their freedom of action.
5. Against compulsory religiousservices.
6. For democratic student government.

Against Imperialist War and W 01’ Preparations
on the Campus
The school is as vital a link in ‘war preparations today as
it. was in 1917, when educational institutions supplied the
army with half a_ million trained men. Many schools and
colleges -have military training on their curricula. In some
of these -institutions this training is compulsory.‘ Elsewhere
15

 

 

special inducements are offered to‘ make students take it.
Jingoism and propaganda for national defense are dis-
seminated in the classroom, as well as in the R. O. T. C.

‘ courses. Expenditures for armaments grow daily in spite of

 

 

 

 

 

  

peace pacts and disarmament conferences. More than a
quarter of a billion for new ships. Hundreds of thousands
of young men have been herded into reforestation camps,
where the raily routine of military training prepares them for
war-time activity. The mounting expenses of future wars
ostensibly as part of a public works program can be ex-
plained only in the light -of the troubled international situ-
ation. - .

Although no wars have been officially declared, armies are
even now engaged in conﬂict in scattered parts of the globe.
Even these conﬂicts which are_ apparently local in charac-
ter are produced by economic rivalries between world powers
who today ﬁght each other indirectly through vassal states,
but who tomorrow force peace-time rivalry for markets be-
tween the great imperialist powers to the breaking point. Un-
able to dispose of a surplus of commodities to an unemployed
working class at home,’ each power is attempting a redistribu-
tion of colonial markets at the expense of the other.

Economic decline and imperialist conﬂicts cause intensive
exploitation of the colonial countries. We realize that for
these oppressed peoples to repudiate the resort to arms in
the face of an armed oppressor is a declaration of suicide.
As a movement that strikes at the most deep—rooted causes
of war, the National Student League supports the independ-
ance movement of the colonies. An added danger of war
is a constant threat of intervention against the Soviet Union.
In spite of innumerable interventions and provocations, the
Soviet Union has pursued a consistent policy of peace, Its
unequivocable stand for complete disarmament and peace
can be explained only by the ‘fact that it is the ﬁrst country
in the world where the basis for modern imperialist war,
the drive for capitalist proﬁts, has been abolished.

Whatever the results of the impending imperialist war, a
16

 

 

 

 

  

small group of bankers and manufacturers stand to proﬁt
while the great masses of people both on the battle-ﬁeld and
at home have nothing to gain but hardship and death.

Students play an important role in war- Frequently they
are the technicians and officers. It is for them to realize that
their interests do not lie with the makers of war, the manu-
facturers and bankers. e .

In the ﬁght against war, students must not put their faith
in peace pacts and pledges not to ﬁght. Experience has shown
the futility of opposition to war which relies on moral sua-
sion and is not prepared for organized mass resistance; Only
by an alliance with the elements of the population that are
opposed to war can the student wage an effective struggle.

Our economic system breeds not only international wars
but also internal class conﬁicts. As long as economically an-

tagonistic classes exist there will be struggle between these
. groups. The National Student League repudiates the paciﬁst

 

 

position, which, while it apparently refuses to take sides in
this conﬂict, in reality helps to prevent the action required
for the defeat of the imperialists. Only the working class
is capable of building a social order which will eliminate class
conﬂict, By its numbers and position in industry, the work-
ing class is the most potent class in the ﬁght against war. The
N.S.L. supports the workers in their struggle against im-.
perialist war and for the overthrow of capitalism.

We demand: ‘

I. The abolition of R.O.T.uC.
e 2. All war funds to the unemployed. R.O.T.C. funds
for relief and scholarships to needy students. A

3. Against the utilization of college and school facilities
for military purposes.

T C ampus Activities

Members of the National ‘Student League participate in
all campus activities. They do not conﬁne themselves to the
N.S.L. chapter. They are never isolated from the student
body. Members with a special interests are active in clubs
devoted to their particular’ subject. Those who have the

17

 

 

 

ability work on the college newspaper. In the classroom as

elsewhere N.S.L. members are known as such and they popu-
larize their program. One of the most important "N.S.L.
activities is participation in student self-government. Here
it attempts to elect candidates by applying the program of
the N.S.L. to the local situation. It cooperates with other
groups, always on the basis of program and principles. The
object is always the same; uniting the student body in. the
struggle for. its interests.’ ‘  i g

Although N.S.L. members also participate in sports they
make clear their opposition to the-institution as it exists to-
day. They consider the over—emphasis on competition be-
tween the large colleges harmful because it prevents the mass
of students from taking part in athletics. It further breeds
a rah—r'ah spirit which inhibits their understanding of their
own problems and those of society. 4 ' ‘

The National Student League ﬁghts for:

I. The abolition of the star system of athletics.

2. The institution of intra-mural athletics.

The Student and the Working Class

In conducting their campus struggle students ﬁnd them-
selves confronted by the dominant economic groups and their
subservient political machinery. They ﬁnd themselves op-
posed by the power of the state, when the police are «used
to break up student demonstrations and strikes. The press
falsiﬁes its accounts of militant student activities. All this
follows from the fact that the demands of the students are
in direct opposition to the educational program of the bank-
ers and industrialists. Since their program of retrenchment
tends towards the curtailment of free education .and their
interest in war preparation toward the militarization of
schools and colleges, students ﬁnd themselves engaged in in-
creasing conﬂict with these groups. - t

In this clash the students have a powerful ally in the work-
ing class which is engaged in the constant struggle against
the identical economic interests. Workers support student
struggles because they also desire a free education for them-

18

 

 

 

 -

 

. .....m,g,,-«w.:.... ... .__ .

selves and their children. They -also oppose war and war

, preparations. For eﬁective action against the forces that

control the schoolﬂsystern, the support of so large and power-
ful a group as the working class is essential. “

After graduation —students—~ will§ﬁnd«the*rr‘1.s"elves bound to
the "workers with. ever closer‘ ties. They will faceyagpworld
wherein the’. demand for their services__ will’-be far surpassed
by the supply of applicants. , Many of’ them will join the
growing army of‘ the unemployed.‘ Those who get jobs will
be economically dependent on the will of lemployeis "who
may arbitrarily discharge them. They thus’ shareithe in-
security of all wage earners. In addition, many students, es-
pecially evening school students, are themselves .part-time
or full-time workers and are at present subject to wage—cuts,
arbitrary dismissals and overlong working hours.

The only effective answers to those conditionslis‘vt-he unity
of all who are concerned. The students mustithereforegally
themselves with the -working class which-bears the brunt of
these conditions, and join its ﬁght for security and a decent
living, ~

This we can do by joining in the demands for social in-
surance for unemployed workers and graduates, and by

giving active support to the militant organizations of the

workers and farmers.

Students must align themselves with the wor-kers if they
are to win their immediate demands, and they are drawn to
the support of the working class by the larger need for a
new social order, since the working class is the leading force
in bringing about this change. ’ ’ T

A Letter‘ to the Reader

You are interested in the National Student League- You
know something of. our activity and you feel the need for
a student organization thatvwill raise and ﬁght for the de-
mands of students. What can you do to build an organiza-
tion on your campus to ﬁll this need? i

If you believe, after reading this pamphlet, that the Na-
tional Student League is such an‘ organization, the ﬁrst
thing to do is to ‘ﬁll out the membership blank at the end
of this pamphlet and become a registeredimember. The next
step is to write to us, and to secure our literature. Now, you

are, perhaps, a member of some school club, where you have

a few personal friends. Show these“ friends a copy of Stu-
dent Review, and of this pamphlet. You can readily get one
or two people who will be interested in the N.S.L. Or you
might write a letter to your school paper, calling upon stu-
dents who are interested to come and talk things over with
you. Two or three will answer. With this small nucleus,
you plan for a large organizational meeting; posters on every
bulletin board, letters in your newspaper, personal contact,
perhaps a mimeographed or printed leaﬂet.

Let us say that ten people come to your meeting. There
should be only two subjects on your agenda: program and
organization. With these ten people, read the program of
the N.S.L., discuss it thoroughly and emphasize those sec-
tions that relate most closely to your own school situation.
You have read several issues of the Student Review and the
National Organizer and you can describe the kind of activity
other schools with problems like yours have conducted.

In the organizational part of the meeting, distribute ap-
plication cards, and register those who are willing to join.
It should be made clear that students may join on the basis
of _ any one part of the program. Registration requires
that youcollect either one dollar (dues for a full year) or

24

 

 

 

 

 

 

20c (registration dues only) and that you mail the cards
and 80 per cent of the money to the national membership
secretary. Elect your ofﬁcers then; an executive secretary,
an organizer, who writes to the national office, a membership
secretary, who collects dues, and a Student Review agent
and treasurer. (The names and addresses of all officers
must be sent to the National office as soon as elections have
taken place.) At this meeting, also, get as many subscrip—
tions for Student Review as you can and mail them to the
manager of the magazine. You may modify your executive
committee to suit your needs, by combining ofﬁces (executive
secretary and organizer, for example) or increasing their
number.

The next meeting of your group should take place very
soon after the ﬁrst and should be devoted to a thorough dis-
cussion of the needs and the character of your school, and
to the planning of your future activity. Center your dis-
cussion around the program.

Retrenchment:—Are tuition rates high? Have teachers
and student—workers salaries been cut? Are prices in the
lunch room and book store too high? Have scholarships
been decreased? Courses cut, student fees raised? Are
classrooms crowded? Has the school term been shortened?

War :—Is there R.O.T.C. in your school? Junior Naval
Reserves? Compulsory? Optional? ‘Other military or
fascist propaganda?

Discrimination :~—-Are Negro students permitted to attend
school functions, proms, etc.? Swimming pool? Get Negro
students to come to your meeting. Make them feel at home.
Show them that no discrimination is tolerated in the N.S.L.

Do employment agencies discriminate against Negro stu-
dents? Are municipal, state and civil service jobs open to
them on equal terms with white students? Write to us for
further advice on how Negro and white students may unite
to combat discrimination.

Another extremely important question to raise and resolve
is———what agencies we can employ to reach the students and

25

 

 

 

to gain our demands. Student government——is it powerful
and can we win. it over? Campus clubs——French Club,
Mathemathics Club, Chess, Club, Discussion =C1ubs-——have we
any inﬂuence in them? If not, let’s’ join them and win them
to us, at least on one speciﬁc demand. Raise the issue of‘
fascism in the German Clubs. School newspaper,—how does
one get on the staff? Will they publish letters and articles
that we write? Faculty—are there any sympathetic men:
among them, who will speak’ for us and help us in any

discouraged. Three good N.S.L. members can do more in
inﬂuencing the history of a school than hundreds of un-

  , "INTRODUCTION

by students on the various questions of the day; but
the moment they cease to be merely discussion groups and
become action groups,we must draw the 1ine”,iMark Eisner
stated recently. _ ,

Ever larger numbers of students are beginning to corn-
plement their study and discussion by acting on their con-
victions. Alarmed at the rise of a militant student movement,»
Mr. Eisner as Chairman of the Board of Higher Education
of New York City, has decided to “draw the line”.

In the face of administrative opposition, students are be-
ginning to. take action on the immediate problems confront-
ing them; on the problems of war and fascism, educational
retrenchment and discrimination against Negro students.
George F. Zook, United States Commissioner of Education
states that : “My complaint about college students is that
they are too darned docile. They are too easily vbossed. They
don’t create enough problems for the college or university
administration.” Commissioner Zook closes his eyes to the
startling developments on the American campus.

* =1: :1: >9:

What factors have brought about such a change in the
life and activities of the American students, so that even the
sedate columns of theNew York Times refer to the new
“radical student movement”? The question can be answered
by tracing the developments which have taken place during
the past three years and‘ which have been crystallized in the
formation of the National Student League, with chapters in‘
125 colleges and universities, and numerous high schools in

. every part of’ the United States. i

 

 

The ,U.S. Commissioner of Education has stated that’ we

“OBVIOUSLY, there can be no objection to discussion

  

 

are now “faced with the greatest crisis in American educa-
tion.” Over 5,0oo schools have been compelled to close down
in four years of crisis. Confronted by nation-wide €C01’l01’l‘11C

collapse, and byithe “stabilization” of economy at a de-_

pression level, faced with chronic unemp1oyment——students
have been compelled to realize the failure of the educational
systm to integrate the graduating student with his social and
economic environment. _ V . "‘

The Natio-nal Student League did not spring into being
‘ffully armed” as Minerva from the brain of Zeus. It was
not simply the result of bright ideas occurring to college
radicals. Nor was it formed as a result of “split over tactics”
in the “L.I.D. chapter in the New York Colleges” as is er-
roneously stated in a pamphlet issued by the Intercollegiate
League of the League for Industrial Democracy.

During the fall term of 1931 there was formed in New
York City a federation of college clubs in order to act on
certain immediate problems. Max, Weiss and ten other stu-
dents had been suspended from City College for their anti-
militarist activity. Violations of academic freedom were be-
coming more frequent in the metropolitan colleges. There
was no previously existing group to give organized ex-
pression to student opposition. Included in the federation,
which called itself the New York Student League, were
members and sympathizers of all shades of opinion including
socialist, communist and liberal; It was this New York
Student League which published the ﬁrst number of The

Student Review. .

Concluding its ﬁrst editorial, the Review stated: V

“For our is not a solitary position. Students in all cities
and towns in America, and in all parts of the world, face
an identical fate under this outmoded economic order. It is
only for us to unite with this common purpose before us.
Like the workers, we have nothing to lose.” ‘

And overnight, we became national.

Simultaneous with the organization of the now famous‘

student delegation to Kentucky, there took place the ﬁrst
4

 

 

 

National Conference of the N.S.L. (March .1932). Reports
indicated that chapters had already been established in" col-
leges from California to Massachussetts, as well. as in a
number of high schools. It was at this conference that a"
long step in the direction of clarity with respect to the pro-
gram of the N.S.L. was established. The program adopted
at the ﬁrst national conference is in most regards similar
to our present one. Donald Henderson, at that time still at
Columbia University, became Executive Secretary of the

, organization.

 

 

It is important that we make clear the fact’ that when the
National Student League was formed it was the only in-
dependent ‘organization of students, led by students them-
selves, committed to a program of activity on immediate
student demands, and supporting the working class.

So many events and struggles have taken place during the
brief span covering the existence‘ of the National Student.
League, that it is impossible for us to recount even all the
important ones. i - p C

The Kentucky trip has already been mentioned. It is
signiﬁcant that the National Student League became a na-
tionalvorganization onthe basis of the widespread student
support gained through this dramatic action of solidarity
with the working, class. The ninety students who Went on
that trip could indeed, as Rob Hall, leader of the delegation,
said, “tell the story of our disillusionment as the story also of
our education.” '

Immediately after, there occurred the ﬁrst signiﬁcant stu-
dent strike in American history. The N.S.L. chapter at
Columbia took leadership of the strike in protest against the
expulsion of Reed Harris, editor of the Spectator. Thousands
of students‘ struck and demonstrated. Reed Harris was re-
instated. i

[There followed many campaigns against retrenchment in
education and increase in tuition fees, in Detroit, Chicago,
New York and other cities. Following upon the participation
of the N.S.L. in the World Congress Against War held at

-.5

 

Amsterdam in the summer of 1932, there took place the Na-
tional Student Congress Against War, at the University of
Chicago during the Christmas Vacation, 1932. We can trace
the great spread of student anti—war conferences and action
back to that conference. A V

Directly after the “Chicago Anti-War Conference the Sec-
ond National Convention was held. Reports revealed the
growth in our inﬂuence and organization. Reports were
heard from the Canadian Student League and from a stu-
dent representative from Colombia, South America. The
latter received an ovation; ‘

The Second National Convention saw the setting up of a
National High School Council. In the months that followed
the High School section grew in strength and succeeded in
leading a number of important high school struggles. While
the anti—retrenchment strike of 20,000 high school students
in Chicago, the leaders of which tried to exclude the N.S.L.,
ﬁzzled out in a short while and lost its great potentialities
for complete victory against retrenchment, a subsequent
movement, under N.S.L. leadership, succeeded in obtaining
a partial victory, with the return of a number of subjects to
the curriculum in Manley and other high schools. This move-
ment was carried on in the face of even greater terrorism
than usually confronts a high school struggle.

The movement against ‘retrenchment spread to the eve-
ning high schools in New York City, and an evening high
school council of the N.S.L. was set up, whose activities
centered mainly around this issue.

The anti—militarist movement begun in Chicago reached
a climax in the demonstration at =C.C.N.Y. which led to the
expulsion of ‘twenty-one students, and which saw the spect-
acle of a college president belaboring his own students with
an umbrella. .

The inevitable took place and Donald Henderson, our
executive secretary, was refused reappointment at Columbia.
Another strike and countless demonstrations resulted. Men-
tion should also be made of the exclusion of Professor Gal-

6

 

 

 

 

 

 

lagher from Cal., and of Oakley Johnson at ~C.C.N.Y.

Stating its support of the struggle of the_ working, class
against the system which oppresses them along with the
student body, the N..S.»L. has on many occasions given con-
crete evidence of this support. Raising relief, marching on
the picket line and actively supporting strikes, were students
at Yale, Harvard, California, Smith,Co.llege, Chicago, New
York, Utah and countless other places. We have supported
and shall continue to support strikes led A. F. of L., T.U.U.
L. and independent unions. .

Never was a better opportunity presented -than at the Na-
tional Conference on Student In Politics for evaluating the
respective merits of the various student organizations in this
country- To this conference, held in Washington on Dec.
30, 1933, the N.S.L. alone came with speciﬁc proposals for
united action against war and fascism, educational retrench-
ment, and Negro discrimination. All the other organiza-
tions were pledgedto the holding bf a “deliberative con-
ference” and they had promised the Chamber of Commerce
in whose building the conference was held that they would
not adopt any resolutions.

And when the continuation committee of the conference
met, despite the fact that it was pledged to carry out the
above mentioned program, the N.S.L. delegate alone (reper-
sentatives from the L.I.D., Y.M'.C.A., American Student
Union, etc., were present) voted in favor of a motion which
said that the committee was obligated to carry out its own
program. And now these organizations have ‘permitted the
conference to die a very sorry death-

"Student in Politics” was not the only conference held at
the close of 1933. At Howard University there took place
the “Third National Convention of the N.S.L. where a na-
tional plan of action emphasizing the issues of war, retrench-
ment and Negro discrimination was adopted. There also
cook place a conference of the Student L.I'.D. which heard
the now famous proposal of the National Student League
for the amalgation of both organizations in order to form

:1

 
 

 

one united militant student movement. Despite the growth of
sentiment for such unity among many students in the .S._L.I.
D., the motion was rejected on the basis of-a proposal to
undertake joint action, sidestepping the issue of a united
student organization and program. A working agreement
and a united front on the issues facing the students now
exists between the N.S.L. an-d S.L.I.D'.

Although the pressure of the activities of the N.S_.L. com-
pelled the Student League for Industrial Democracy to un-
dertake student activities on student issues,’the rejection ‘of
our Amalgamation proposal is but one indication of the fact
that the Student L.I.D. retains its previous orientation.
Brieﬂy stated the S.L.I.D_.‘seeks to keep the student move-
ment within the narrow conﬁnes of the Socialist Party. It
looks upon the students as a force which can arouse and
lead the working class to a new social order, rather than as
an independent force with its own speciﬁc problems, accept-
ing the leadership of the working class and supporting its
struggles, In spite of all obstacles, the N.S.L. continues to
stand for student unity on the basis of its militant program.
Through their own experiences the students will see which
organization works for a powerful united student movement.

Internationalism has notonly been a pious phrase to the
N.S.L. but a basis for action. The spread of Fascism, which
thrives upon the utilization of nationalism and race pre-
judice, and often tries to use students as its storm—troopers,
makes all the more necessary the creation of an international
ﬁghting front. The N.S.L. was represented at Amsterdam
and participates in the work of the International Bureau of
Revolutionary Student organizations, now located in Paris.
Delegates of the N.S.L. attended anti-war conferences in
Montevideo and ‘Costa Rica, and Walter Relis spent three
months in Cuba as N.S.L. representative, working with the
embattled students of that country, struggling together with
the workers against the oppression of American imperialism.

The greatest manifestation of student action against im-
perialist war was the April I 3th strike, which climaxed Na-

'8

 

 

tional Student Anti-War week. T hisstrike of more than
25,000 students throughout the country, testified to the
growth of that movement which was initiated -by the Na-
tional Student League, two ‘years ago.

The N ..S.L. was the cooiidinati‘ng‘i and driving force

V throughout t‘hei'-two-<years. of anti-war activities, ;.as well as in
Anti-War Week itself. -A _ __

The history of the N.S.L. is thus seen to be one of militant
struggle. In our short period of existence we have created
a new approach to student problems and new methods of
student action that are profoundly changing the role of the
American student in the life of the country. The student is
‘becoming a force in the political scene and the recent’ Hearst-
Easley blast against the N .S.L., is proof enough that this
force is recognized and feared by the jingoes and reaction-
aries. . .

In presenting the program of the N.S.L. and in appealing
to the students to join the organization we wish to make
clear the fact that the N .S.L. is not a student substitute for
a political party on the campus. The N.S.L. is affiliated to
no political party and it is controlled by the membership
itself. Our members are students of diverse afﬁliations and
beliefs. On the basis of its program, the N.S.L. invites all
students to join. The student must take a stand!
