SALT LAKE CITY, Utah
-—With a strike deadline only
hours away, the American
_melting & Refining Co.

inally came through with a
settlement worth 7 % cents
The agreement
covers all AS&R plants under
contract with Mine-Mill.

The company had stalled
its negotiations all summer.
By the end of August, the
workers in AS&R plants
across the country were fed
up and mobilized for strike

ction. The strike was set to

egin with the day shift 0

uesday, August 31. T i

At this point, the company
agreed to resume negotia-
tions, and it summoned its

lant managers here for
foint chain-wide bargaining
with the Mine-Mill AS&R
negotiating committee.

‘ THEN FOLLOWED three
days and nights of almost
continuous negotiations,
with the Company spokes-
men keeping their eyes on
the clock as the strike dead-

line got closer’ and‘ closer.
The company’s negotiators
began to push up the amount
of their package offer, which
was worth 5 cents when it
was made——and rejected-—
earlier in the summer.

Finally, the night before
the strike deadline, phone
calls were made to AS&R
locals across the country. A
tentative settlement had
been reached. It ‘ looked as
though no strike was needed.
The company had agreed
that it would apply the “pat-
tern” settlementsto the E.
Helena and Leadville opera-
tions, even though it had
insisted earlier that it could
make no offer at these
plants.

THE AGREEMENT came
as the result of the first
genuinely national bargain-
ing ever conducted in AS&R.
The national Mine-Mill nego-
-tiating committee for the
first time included one mem-
ber from every local in the

Q’

for the first ‘time had its
plant managers present,- so
that local issues could be
settled right then and there.
And it was agreed that the
“pattern” settlement would
cover every plant in the
chain.

- The agreement included a
wage increase varying from
5 to 6% cents across the
board, varying from plant to
plant. It also included in-
creases of 11/; to 2% cents
in the company contribution
to health and welfare plans.
Eligibility qualifications for
health and welfare plans
were greatly improved.

Among the numerous special lo-
cal gains were such items as an
increase in premium pay for Sun-
day work as such in Perth Am-
boy, N. J.; clothing allowances in
Omaha; medical care for pen-
sioners in Tacoma; and the
company to pay the increased
cost of the Permanente -health
plan in its Selby and San Fran-
cisco plants. _ .

The agreement was quickly ap-

DOUGLAS, Ariz. "- The
settlement reached between
Mine-Mill and Phelps-Dodge
Copper Corporation for Ari-
zona operations last week in-
cluded the following gains:

A Wage increase ranging
from 41/2 cents to 6 cents.
Increased shift differentials
to new levels of 5 cents, 71/2
cents and 10 cents. A $1,000
paid up life insurance policy
to cover pensioners, provided
they are already covered by
the insurance plan at the
timeof retirement at age 65.

Sickness and accident
benefits extended from the
old 13 week limit to 26
weeks. In the case of an ac-
cident on the job, benefits
will now beginiwith the first
day.

There are also a ‘number of re-
classifications and minor contract
readjustments.

The contract is for two years,
with a clause providing for re-
opening on economic issues June
30, 1955. Signing of this contract
and the new one in El Paso means

Lecld, zinc prices

copper holds firm 

Lead a.nd zinc prices were boosted by. government‘
stockpile ‘buying within recent weeks‘. Copper
supplies remained tight as the result of s-trikes: in both
U.-S. and Chile. " ' " 

Lead prices moved up one quarter  .a,cent on

’-August 25 and another quarter cent on September 7 to a 

2

new level of 14 1/1. cents, Theseincreases followed simi-
lhr increases on the London market, and resulted from
. Isteclipile» buying. _  

.The new stockpile objective for-lead could mean
_addit'ional stockpile purchases of as much as .18, to 19

thousand tons for the remaining 10 months of the fiscal ~

year. .
Lead at 14% cents is now 21% above the lowkpoint
of 12 cents reached in April of 19533.
. .0 r - -_

Zinc prices jumped one half cent to 11‘/2 cents on
September 3-. The boost was directly attributable to in-
creased stockpile buying. ~ ._ .

Just before the increase, the General Services Admin-
istration, which does the buying for the stockpile, had

ccepted everything producers offered for September
_uying and asked. for more. The price increase soon
followed. - p, _
_ Between 18 and 20,000 tons of zinc, it is estimated,
were bought for the stockpile this month. Purchases
between now and June I955 cpuld go as high as 27,000
tons per month. ” '

\.

Copper prices are sure to stay at the 30-cent level
for some months and, despite presentgdenials by pro

ducers, could go higher as the result of “shortages brought.‘

about by current strikes. 

-While, as reported elsewhere in this issue‘, Kennecott,

resumed production last week, Anaconda, Miami Copper.
and Inspiration—-which together account for about 15,000

tons per month-—continued shut down. i 6

dluces about 11,000 tons a month, hassbeen closed since
August 18. Anaconda’s Porterillos mine, with monthly
production of about 3,750 tons, has also been shut down
for over a week and their big. Chuquicamata mine (16,-

Why enlployers   are 
tougher this year    

By Orville Lorsonﬁ

   
  
    
 
   
  

International Vice Pr._eside”§vi'

THE FINAL BATTLE for ’54 contract gains is far 
from won but we have, so far, taken some important
ob'ectives. We’ve won settlements with three of the.‘-‘Big 

can Metal. Those settlements——in the eight to nine «cents 
range—clearly offer a pattern on which the rest of the f
industry, if it so wants, can settle. - ‘  V 3’ "

At this Writing, we’re on strike
in all of Anaconda, at Phelps
Dodge in El Paso; and .at American
Zinc in Metalline Falls. We’re, still
negotiating with the-rest of the
industry‘. ' P ' " '

WHY THEN, are these com-
panies still holding out? It is
simply a matter of dollars and
cents. We know that“ the souls
of many of these corporations
co-me wrapped in dollar bills. How,
then, explain the fact, for ex-
ample, that Anaconda has already
lost more from the strike this
year than a decent settlement  V ._ 4~
would cost them? Why are they willing to-risk millions V 3. 

 

in a desperate‘ effort to avoid paying a few more cents  

in wages, or, in some cases, settling issues which don’_t  

involve more ‘money? i «  _ ' 
We have to understand something of the way these  :;

corpoi_fate inoguls think. They’re not concerned solely  

with tomorrow, or.even the next year. The~y’re concerned~’, I . 

with long-range g'oals—with achieving objectives which,_ 

over the years, will payoff handsomely. ~ . t A"

O

THERE WAS A TIME—not so long ago—when com.-V 
panics were out to destroy all unions.——to prevent tliem,-if“ 0  if
possible, from even getting off the ground‘. They spent» {:  .
‘millions in a vain effort to stop the greatorga.ni~zing'.- 
drives of the 30’s and early_ 40’s—an.d lost. _ ,    ‘

Today, the corporations are a bit more subtle. They}; 
are willing to deal with unions—_—if they7re the “right-._}j 
kind.” ‘They want unions that go through‘ the mot-ions'":of—  
representing workers while actually playing the . em; 
ployer’s game. That kind of union can sometimes geta in 
few penniesmore in_wag'es and even respectable looking ; ~:_ 
'contracts——on paper. Their value to the bosses is   
they don’t fight grievances, f‘coopei'ate” on speed-up, and.  
ggenerally forget the‘ contract after it’s signed. Tjliey.   ‘

’ ‘weaken the spirit of unionism,’-‘soften up the workersfor 7 

‘=_ '/ss propaganda.’ . V  .

This is thekind‘ off unionism the non-ferrous metal 
_c(_)_rporations_want. -This is the year they decided _to__make  
their big- gamble -for that big objective — in negotiations»   pp
and on the, political front.‘ Theyfelt that the.pol_iticaI 
climate-—with a Cadillac cabinet and a reactionary. Con?-7'

' grass in power—was_ just right. . ’  ‘

It/would also be worth-millions to this company to
be able to destroy the nation-wide solidarity ofi'tAnacoii‘d”a'
workers that we have built up through the Mine—Mi[l;3l

erence. \ A '  . ‘

/

WE KNOW THESE “hold-out” companies will be dis;
appointed, just as Kennecott found itself forced to give.
and sign,up. The spirit and determination of our mem-
bers‘ on the picket lines is the proof of that‘.-' j j 75

V We can be proud of what we have already achiev”ed"_._

best won by any union. Gains like the Kennecott Health,
and Welfare Plan, for example, will long be models for:
any union towork for. ' - N V ._t 

ALL THE 1 GAINS we have won, however,‘ are not"
secure unless and until similar settlements are won
throughout the rest of the industry. What has been con-
ceded by one‘ company this year can be taken away an-_
otheryear-—1f we are unable to extend our gains to all?
companies. ‘ ,. ,  f

That is why our full membership and resources must,

Their objective? To settle
the strike and sign a con-
tract. Ithas been the union’s
objective from the beginning
to settle th e negotiations.
And in every Way possible,
the union negotiating com-
mittee and the membership
have tried to indicate to the
company how ' negotiations
could be. wound up‘ peaceful-
ly. Without "a company coun-;
ter-proposal, however, ‘it has
been impossible for the union
to indicate the kind of. settle-
ment ‘ that would be satis-

WHAT IS the company's
objective? At first the union
believed that AC_M had a
simple objective of holding
‘out so that it could execute
another of its-notorious soft
settlements, the kind it was
accustomed to reach with
the old gang‘ of renegades
whom‘ '=Mine"- Mill’ ‘defeated’

last " March.‘ But it has ' be-

come apparent that the com-
pany wants more than a soft
settlement. [ ‘ l ’

‘As one Butte Local leader
put itrecently :1 “They don’t
.want to settle at all; they
think they can -b met the
union.” \ ' ' _ .

Recently, the-company has
been putting, the heat on‘

shut off the strikers’ credit.

"FAIRMO1NT, CITY, Il1.—*— '
Twenty years of militant
unionism has been climaxed
. by Fairmont Smelter Work-
. ers, Local 82, with the offi-
~ cial opening of their new
,/ $50,000 union hall.
’ The Local, which was or-
‘ ganized under the Mine—Mill
banner back in 1984, proudly
holds a contract which ranks
._ second to none in the zinc
v _ industry. ,. “
_ This is the same local
which/carried on a victorious
‘ 13-month strike against the
American Zinc’ Company in
1948-49, when the officials
‘of the company got the idea
they could use the Taft-
, Hartley act- to smash the
-union. _
Police brutality, T-H injunc-
tions,‘ arrests, fines red-baiting
by the press, local businessmen,
clergy the company .and its
agents, attacks by AFL and CIO
ﬁiteelworkers raiders and their
hired goons and gunmen, even
the brutal shooting of two local
82 members-—Joseph Petroski
and Epiinenio Rodriguez—all
‘these failed to bust the strike.
THE STRIKE ended in victory
because the members of local 82 . .  = .
were determined to maintain the NEW‘ HAI-.1: Members, of Fairmont
-union they had fought for and S I W "- l '

, FORTUNATELY, the courts do
have the right under the act to test
and examine an attempt by Attorney
General Browne 1 and his special witch-
hunt board set up by the McCarran

-Act of 1950,. to take away the right

of workers to stick to the union of
their choice. ' _ . -

We are informed by counsel that
much morethan two years will pass
from the‘ time the_Attorney General
“recommends” action against a union‘
until that action can be taken.‘ i ‘ .
, Those two- years will be precious to
the.entire labor movement. They will
give the ‘chance to expose this..dis-

' graceful law for what it is‘-—a direct

assault on the Bill of Rights and the
living standards of all American work-
ers. They will give us the chance to
convince Congress that in the , good

name of American democracy, this law i

must be repealed. \

 E ARE. CONFIDENT the ma...

bers of our- union will realize this law
is just another weapon in the handsof
the employer. We in. Mine-Mill are
veterans -of a great many battles with
the "non-ferrous metal corporations,
battles goin’g*back_for more than six.-
decades. Licensing of unions is just
another term for ‘company-unionizlng.
We have defeated many attempts to
compan.y-unionize Mine—Mill. We will
defeat this one, too. .

The Executive Boardlof our union

‘will, of course, make a thorough study
‘of this new law and its meaning for

Mine—Mil1 andthe rest of the labor
movement. The Board will certainly

issue a statement after that study islji

completed. - . .
