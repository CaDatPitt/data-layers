a handy excuse came from the N e.w York Times’ thoughtful James Reston

«who wrote. from Washington on June 28:, “The whole issue of reversing

U. S. policy in Formosa would have been raised  . even if the Com-

munists had not attacked South Korea.”, Q’
‘The next shift in our Formosa policy came on February 2, 1953, when
President Eisenhower removed the restrictions placed upon Chiang Kai-

» shek by Truman’s neutralization order. However, Eisenhower maintained V

the 7th Fleet in the Straits of Formosa to prevent any retaliation against
Chiang from the mainland. ,

The present crisis stems from the new Formosa policy inaugurated
by Truman and pushed a step further by Eisenhower. In June 1950 the
Chinese were not involved in the Korean ﬁghting. It was Truman’s neu-
tralization of Formosa which first linked’ Korea and China.

Large-scale aid to Chiang Kai-shek was resumed in 1950 and has
been increased each year. Press estimates of the total for 1954 ran as high

as $320,000,000, while U. S. aid in the first months of 1955 has been
«reported as running at the rate of half a billion dollars a year. But even

such overall compilations do nottell the whole story, since “incidental
costs,” such as the expense of maintaining the 7th Fleet off Formosa or
the extra military personnel required to train and advise Chiang’s army,
navy and airforce, are not included.

I Chiang Kai-shek has not been slow to take advantage of the anomal-
ous situation in which he is encouraged by the U.S. to harass the mainland
and at the same time is protected from any retaliation. China has charged

, that Chiang’s’ forces, which are equipped, supplied, trained and advised

by the United States, made the following attacks upon the mainland from
1950 until the summer of 1954:‘

0 Killed or captured 1300 Chinese ﬁshermen.
0' Seized or sunk 470 Chinese vessels.

0 Captured and /or halted and pirated 67 foreign ships enroute to or from
Chinese ports. (43 were British, the remainder belonged to Denmark,

Italy, U.S.S.R., Norway, Greece, Poland, Panama and West Germany.)

K 0 Made 41 raids on offshore islands and mainland coastal areas.

0, Flown 1427 bombing, straﬂng and reconnaissance sorties over the main-
I land. /

from the mainland. (On November 24, 1954, China "announced it had ‘

killed _or captured 230 Chinese agents dropped from planesin the
period 1951-54.) ‘
Indications that these ﬁgures are probably pretty close to the mark
are the continuous protests to Formosa by Britain and other powers over
interference with their merchantmen by Chiang’s navy and Formosa’s
own frequent boasts of attacks against the mainland. ‘

If Washington actually desires a cease-ﬁre in the Formosa area, it
certainly has been proceeding in an unusual way.,The reaction of the
Chinese government to the increased attacks from Formosa has" been to
move against the smaller offshore islands, such as the Tachens,* which
Chiang Kai-shek has been‘ using as forward bases.

From the record it is apparent that today’s explosive situation is of
our own making. '

We May" Be In For More Than We Realize

DOES the administration realize what we may be getting into? Do we,
the American people?

Is China a sprawling, backward country which we could .“polish off”
i9 30 days, as.House Minority Leader Joseph Martin assures us? Or is
she the uniﬁed nation of 600 million people which fought us to a stale-
mate in Korea? A -

Is China an isolated country which we can block off from the world
andbring to her knees by a show of force and a little ’judicious bombing?
Or is she a nearly self-suﬂicient country one-fourth again as large as the
United States which is closely allied with the Soviet Union and officially
recognized by Britain and 22 other nations? _

Is our policy of embargoing all trade with China accepted by the

rest of the Western -world? Do we have the support of the other countries

of Asia for our “get tough” policy, or do the sympathies of the Indians,
Burmese,.Indonesians and others lie with the Chinese?

Although the China Lobby and the administration may be willing to
close their eyes to the facts of life in Asia, there are signs that the Amer-
ican people are worried over the direction we are heading. According to
Newsweek magazine, letters to congressmen and the President have been

"In May of 1954 China began operations against the Tachens. On January 18,
1955, Secretary Dulles dismissed the fall of Yikiang, one of the Tachens, as “without
any particular importance,” while the following day Mr. Eisenhower wrote off the
entire Tachen group. Yet, less than one week later the administration expressed
grave concern over the military situation and the first use the President made of his
new authority was to send the American Navy into the Tachens,’ some 200 miles
from Formosa, to evacuate and thus save the beleaguered Chiang ‘Kai-shek garrison.

L running- heavily,'against a war over Formosa. James Crowley; the "C10

"__ AutQ'Workers Union Washington correspondent, later reported opposi-

tion to "the Formosa resolution running .150 to T1 and called’ the protest
“unprecedented.”  . « '

Despite the overwhelminglyfavor-able vote (409 to 3 in the House

and 85 -to 3 in the Senate) for the resolution and the subsequent quick
passage of_ the Formosa. Treaty by the Senate (64 ‘to 6)," many Congress- V

men expressed misgivings.
As Sen. Morse said, a majority of .-the senators were “privately op-

posed” to it, Indicative of the doubts held by somewasrthe statement of _.
V Sen. Byrd (D., Va.):

V “It ‘was Chiang‘Kai-shek to whom America sent hundreds of .
millions of dollars worth of war materials. . . . Later (they) were/'
found not only. inthe blackmarkets of China but also in the hands 0 '

the Communists. -

\

“We are becoming a partner with (men) who have been driven
from their country. . . . The primary desire of Chiang Kai-shek is
war on the mainland to recapture his power in Asia.

“. . . Chiang Kai-shek knows better than anyone else that he can

. never set foot on China again without ‘American planes, troops and 
» ships. . . . It is my considered opinion that Chiang Kai-shek is mbti- ‘

vated by self-‘interest; that . . . he may place his ambitions above the
welfare of his American partner.
“These conditions present an extremely dangerous situation
‘which may force our country into a war with China, whether _we
want it or not.” i S

‘ i~ Further underlining the strange situation prevailing were the «state-
ments of several other prominent lawmakers:

. 7Sen. Herbert Lehman (D., N. Y.) called the resolution “a blank
 check of dangerous authority which can be "used to involve us in a war

which we do not want and which the free world does not want.”

Sen. William Langer (R., N. D.) said the resolution “authorizes

preventive war.”

Sen. Russell‘ Long (D., La.) declared: “There would be considerable
concern-(if the public) knew what I heard in those secret hearings.”

Sen. Estes Kefauver (D., Tenn.) said: “We shall place our future‘

. .v . in the hands of a man who . . . apparently would give anything in the

1

world to get us involved in a war with Communist China. . . .’ ,»

‘The China Lobby has done its work well. Caught in the general

hysteria surrounding the China question, our lawmakers voted against
' _ their better judgment. '

_ , Five years‘ago the -,do'mest_ic climate was rather-different from that

" blatantly rewritten as  is today.,Stec'retary Acheson was able to talk of

A moral principles and decry “legal quibbliitig.” History, commonsense and-
"moral principles” are all being stood on theirfheads in Washington"
these days. ‘ ' A - '

_ Letus assume a hypothetical situation in which our position were

‘ reversed..Assume that Hawaii is Formosa and that the American-‘Civil
War is just coming to an end. Chiang Kai-shek is Jefferson ‘Davis and the

' U. S. 7th, Fleet is a'British ﬂotilla:'The British government has branded
our plans to bring Jeff Davis’ rump confederacy.to an end a threat to
world peace, has given Davis a navy, suppliedhim with money andwar
materials and naval advisers and encouraged him to raid the West Coast, .

Does this make any sense? Itmakes no more sense than our present
_ actions. concerning Formosa make. It is unfortunately only here in the‘ a
United States that the weakness of our position is not readily apparent; '
In Europe and in Asia the Formosa question is viewed more realistically. H

isolated; Indicative of the comments from other world capitals are the
following: ' 1

Premier Nehru of India: “There will always be trouble in Asia and

elsewhere until Communist China is recognized in the United Nations.”

(Reuters from New Delhi, May 19, 1954.) _
"Foreign Minister T. Clifton Webb tonight urged the admission of
Communist China to the United Nations.”
(AP from Auckland, New Zealand, July 6,4954.) _
Former Prime Minister Clement Attlee‘: “It is absolutely ridiculous
not to recognize/what is the effective government of China; And that

Formosa Today—_-Democracy or Despoﬁsm?

THE situation has all the makings of a sequel to “Alice in Wonder-
land” and might be equally amusing if it were not a matter of such deadly , .'

seriousness. Highly placed officials talk of protecting the “lawful Republic

of China” from “Communist aggression,” while spokesmen for the China ,

Lobby—-a foreign conspiracy if there ever were one—cynically talk of
preserving Formosa as “an outpost of democracy.”

As the leopard has trouble in changing his spots, so the martinet -of
Formosa ﬁnds it diﬂicult to pose as a democrat and would-be “liberator”
of his people. During the war Gen. Joseph Stilwell summed up the
suitation in Chiang’s China:

“Under Chiang Kai-shek (the_Chinese people) now begin to see

4 what they may expect. Greed, corruption, favoritism, more taxes, a ruined

currency, terrible waste of life, callous disregard of the rights of man.”

_ ' Evidence that Chiang is still _doing business at the same old stand is

plentiful. Gen. Li ‘Tsung-jen, a former acting-president of the Chiang ,

Kai-shek regime, declared in Dec., 1951:

“Chiang is repeating . . . exactly what he did on the mainland . . .
Corruption and graft are now practiced on a smaller scale simply because
the territory under Chiang’s control is now much smaller.”

‘ Dr. K. C. Wu, a long-time colleague of Chiang Kai-shek,. a former
mayor of Shanghai and more recently governor of Formosa, wrote in the
Christian Science _Monitor on March 30,1954:

14-

With the passage of time the United States is becoming increasingly  ._

 

“.  The secret police of our country have so- abused their

powers that they have no regard whatever for law.-The people . p_. .
only dare to resent, but not to speak . . . A
“. . . Formosa has become virtually a police state. The liberties

of the people are almost totally suppressed. While I was governor’

of Formosa.I did my utmost to inculcate the principles that arrests

cannot be made without sufficient evidences of crime and searches

cannot be conducted without due process of law. But as my powers
were limited, even now I,can hardly tell how many innocent people
were‘,,and have been, illegally held and molested . . .” —

But we do not have to depend upon Chiang Kai-shekfs ex-colleagues
for signs that conditions on Formosa are not all the China Lobby has
themcracked up to be.

Columnist Joseph Alsop, writing in the Washington Post on Octo-
her 31, 1953, reported: “Army and divisional and sometimes even regi-
mental and battalion (commanders) -are still being chosen, not for,eﬂi-
ciency, but by . . . inﬂuence . .\ . The truth is that (Chiang Kai-shek’s)
tendency (is) to prefer the plielble bad lots to the independent minded
good men . . .‘’’A -

NEA staff correspondent Fred Sparks posed the following question
and answer in an article carried by the San Francisco News on March 1,
1954: V .
“Ques.: What is (Chiang Kai-shek’s) chance of retaking the main-
land alone? ' i -

“Ans.: Same as surviving a trip over Niagara Falls in a soap dish'.”

Even the daily news ‘agency stories from Formosa hardly picture a
burgeoning democracy.

On Aug. 27, 1954, AP reported from the island’s capital: “Ten
Chinese magazines today were ordered to suspend publication for periods

' up to ten months.”’Again, on Jan. 6, 1955, AP reported: “For the second.

time in two days .. . . a top-ranking (Formosa) oﬂicer is under sentence
of death . . . on charges of corruption.” Or AP’s March 6, 1955, ﬁle from

Formosa which included the following item: Legislator Cheng Sheh-wo p

"charged that a newspaperman had been held ﬁve years without trial and
a (fellow) legislator for three years.”

Or consider the mechanics of Chiang’s re-election as president 0
Formosa last year, as reported by AP on Sept. 26, 1954: ’ . «

“After a day-long heated debate, the (Legislative Yuan)‘ voted 149-9'
approval of a formula designed to.assure that the Assembly would have’
-the necessary 1523-member quorum. Latest ﬁgures show there are only

about 1200 members of the 3045 seat Assembly in Formosa. _
“The bill passed by the Yuan permits runners-up (defeated candi-

‘opium on the Chinese people a century ago cannot force Chiang Kai-shek

dates) or reserve candidates in the last Assembly election to replace
Assemblymen who joined the Communists, are missing or were sentenced
to jail by (Chiang Kai-shek).” (The reconstituted Assembly subsequently
re-elected Chiang as president.)

The American People Musi Decide

THIS is the “government” we are now committed to protect and pre-
serve. And it is this same government that the China Lobby wants to put
back on the mainland, even at the cost of a war’ which our young men
will ﬁght and for which our taxpayers will ante up.

We have run almost to the end of the blind alley down which our
China policy has long been leading. A decision must soon be made. Either
we "come to our_ senses and start looking for a new approach or we follow’
the advice of the Knowlands and Radfords and attempt to solve the
dilemma by blowing up the world—and almost certainly ourselves in the
process. A

The Formosa crisis is, of course, only the latest in a whole series of
crises stemming from Washington’s refusal to adopt a China policy
embodying both realism and true self-interest. Since the ﬁrst‘New England. ,
fortunes were made out of the China trade in the days of the Clipper
Ships we as a nation have been vitally concerned with and affected by
events in China.

We most recently got off on the wrong foot when we intervened in
China’s long over-due revolution in an attempt to preserve an archaic
despotism ripe for disposal because we mistakenly thought it best served
our “interests” in China. We are now compounding our past mistakes by
refusing to recognize that the Chinese people have made their decision
and that, in the last analysis, our own real interests arebest served by a
stable, economically developing China united under a government of its
own choosing.

Today is not 1840 and a gunboat policy which succeeded in forcing

on them in 1955. As we learned in Korea, the Chinese are not a “back-
ward” people whom we can push around at will. If the American people
do not call a halt now, we risk a hydrogen war which will not only poison
our name in Asia for years to come but which may well result in our own
destruction. Time is running out but we still have it within our power to
curb the China Lobby and its “war now” allies who are rapidly moving
into ever greater control of the administration. We can do it. Will we?

 American people are again faced with the prospect of war——this I

time with China over who shall occupy and rule Formosa.

‘ Congress has authorized President Eisenhower to use American sea,
air and land power (which includes atomic and hydrogen bombs) to pre-
serve the status quo of Formosa, the Pescadores and an undisclosed num-

ber of other islands. The measure has been widely interpreted as per-'

mitting the President to initiate hostilities if he suspects the Chinese are
planning an attack on Formosa. Thus has the doctrine of “preventive war”
—a concept totally foreign to all American tradition—been given official
expression.

This was followed by the Senate's speedy ratiﬁlcationiof a military
pact with Chiang Kai-shek. The public has not yet been told the full extent
of our commitments. under this‘ treaty but it is clear that we have tied our
fortunes, and perhaps even our own security, to those of a discredited
adventurer who has publicly declared that his aim is to wage war against
China. This is the same “wrong horse” Chiang whom we backed to the
tune of three billion dollars in our unsuccessful attempt to alter the course
of China’sicivil war. ' A

To whom does Formosa belong? Why should we,“protect” it? Is it
an "outpost of democracy?” Does our action risk only another “brush ﬁre”
conﬂicti or does it threaten to set off a major war in which we may ﬁnd
ourselves, alone and without allies, facing not only China but also the
Soviet Union?’ A

To help answer these questions, let’s first take a brief look at For- 4

mosa* and its history.

A fertile island of nearly 14,000 square miles, Formosa is approxi-

mately 6000 miles west of San Francisco. Viewed from the other direction, .

"The island is known throughout Asia by its Chinese name, Taiwan (Terraced
Bay). The designation "Formosa” comes from early Portuguese sailors who called it
“Ilha Formosa” (Beautiful Isle) when they first sited it in the 16th century.

JOHN W. POWELL is an American newspaperman who has spent ‘I5 years in China. The son
of J." B. Powell. the American editor and foreign correspondent, "Bill" Powell was born in '
Chino. educated in America and has worked as a newspaperman and U. 5. government
official both in China and the United States. In 1947 he succeeded his father. as editor
and publisher of the China Weekly Review. Since returning to the United States in 1953.
Mr. Powell has been writing and lecturing about China.

‘I I HIS is not only the most important of the many questions surround-

ing the Formosa issue, but it is the one about which there has been the
most confusion — and the one to which the answer is clearest.

'In 1360, more than a century before Columbus discovered émerica,
China appointed a constable-general over Formosa and the Pescadores.

_The earliest historical references to Formosa, however, date from China's

Han Dynasty, a period beginning two centuries before Christ, while by

' the 12th‘ century Formosa and the Pescadores were administrative "districts

of»China’s Fukien province.

The first real attempt to wrest Formosa from China ‘came in .1622-24

' America also showed an‘ interest in Formosa during this period.
In 1854 Commodore Perry sent a squadron to _visit the island and.later

recommended that we occupy it asa naval base. There was pconsi-derablev‘-.
I agitation among American traders for annexation. Two enterprising mer-

chants, Nye and Robinet, having cornered theicamphor market» (Formosa
then held a near monopoly of natural camphor which was an essential _
ingredient in the manufacture of celluloid and smokeless gunpowder.)
did in fact temporarily raise the American ﬂag over the harbor of Kaoh-J

siung. In 1867, following an incident involving survivors of the wrecked _

American shi “Rover ” a unitive force‘ of American Marines was tem-
. , '
porarily landed.

Following the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, Formosa was ceded to
Japan.* ' ’

During World War II it lwas agreed that China would recover‘ those
territories stolen by Japan. The Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943,
and the Postdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, formalized this decision.
Formosa and the Pescadores,‘ as well as Manchuria, were in fact returned
to China after the war. _ 

' In February of 1947 the people of Formosa revolted against Chiang
Kai-shek’s extortionate levies. But while Chiang’s governor negotiated,

' promising a complete governmental reform, troops were on the way from . ~
the mainland. Landing at either end of ‘ Formosa Chiang‘s soldiers shot '

the New Yorle Herald Tribune and William Gray of Time magazine, I
visi‘tedFormosa in early March, just as Chiang "Kai-shek’s troops were
re-establishing control. Men, women, the young and the old were shot

 without distinction. In some cities the soldiers knocked at private homes

and shot whoever opened the door, assuming that they thus "executed”
the head of_ the family. The hospitals were ﬁlled and we personally exam-
ined the wounds of civilians] whose legs and arms were blown off or who
‘had other‘ gaping wounds from dum-dum bullets.

I

A While the islanders were afraid to talk withvisiting newspapermen, ‘
we interviewed American and European missionaries, U. S. consular offi- "

cials, United Nations relief personnel and Western businessmen. Without
exception they told of personally witnessing almost unbelievable atrocities
——mutilation of young men, rape of women, random shooting of people
in the streets, of the tides washing up hundreds of bodies for days on end.

Estimates of the number killed in the repression run as high as 15,000.

The Western community was thoroughly sickened and began agitat-
ing for some method—independence or autonomy——of relieving the peo-
ple of Chiang Kai-shek’s terrible despotism.

However, the_Western Powers showed little interest in the idea. The
American embassy put its Formosa political officer, who had written a
_detailed report of the atrocities, under wraps and refused to allow him to
talk with reporters. U. S. officials in‘ China told me that, after all, For-
mosa was part of China'and thus it was purely an internal affair of the
Chinese government.

The China Lobby's Role

TALK of independence and Western intervention was revived in 1949-
50 when Chiang Kai-shek ﬂed to Formosa. However, this time it came
from Chiang’s supporters who were unconcerned about the “Formosa

' ‘ issue” at the time of the 1947 blood bath but who now declaimed against

the, “inhumanity” of allowing the islanders to fall into the hands of the
“Communists.”

However, the United States, already suffering a severe loss of pres-
tige because of Chiang’s ignominious defeat despite largescale American

provide a fertile field for investigation, the Lobby has managed so far to
avoid an official inquiry into its activities; ’ - A ‘

 

The most complete expose of the China Lobby was published in the
Reporter magazine on April 29, 1952: “(The Lobby) has had to exert
pressure on Congress, on the Executive, on public opinion, to get dollars
if-' and weapons in almost unlimited quantity. Yet, not‘even billions or ar-
senals can satisfy it. Actually, nothing can, short of total war . . .” -

"There have been many other references to the Lobby and its. chief
supporters in recent years. Officials such as Sen. Styles Bridges (R., N. H.),
Sen.-...\X/illiam Knowland (R., Calif.), Rep. Walter Judd (R., Minn.),
Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R., Wis.), as well as such prominent individuals
as Gen. Claire Chennault, ﬁnancier Alfred Kohlberg, Gen. Albert Wede-
meyer, Gen. MacArthur and publisher Henry Luce, have frequently been
linked in the press with Lobby activities or views.

One source of Chiang Kai-shek’s lobbying funds was revealed in the
“airplane scandal” when the Formosa regime charged one of its military
purchasing agents in the United States, Lt. Gen. P. T. Mao, with stealing
$6,000,000. Gen. Mao replied that he was being falsely accusedlbecause
he objected to making large unmilitary payments to Chiang Kai-shek’s
personal friends and associates living in this country.

The New York Herald Tribune on Feb. 10, 1954, ‘quoted Gen. Li
Tsung-jen, former acting-president of the Formosa regime until hisiouster
by Chiang Kai-shek, as charging that Chiang spent millions of dollars to
bribe U.S. officials, deposited government funds in his own bank accounts. ' .4
in various countries, and turned over numerous government bank accounts
held abroad to political favorites. 1

Chiang Kai-shek’s government has been bankrupt for years, _its chief
source of funds being grants amounting to at least four billion dollars
from the United States. It is one of the ironies of history that the Amer-
ican taxpayer has supplied the wherewithall for‘ his own propagandizing.

However, "in 1950 the Lobby’s inﬂuence was limited. President Tru-
 V man stated the administration position quite clearly on January 5, 1950:

“In the joint declaration at Cairo (it was stated) that territories

“The United States was ad Signatory to the Potsdam Declaration

of its-surrender. ' V ,* I 7 .i "T

*Even'more explicit was Secretary of State‘ Dean Acheson"-s coin-

ment on the same day: _ S. _, i
“The world must believe that we stand for principle and .that we

"are honorable and decent people and that we do not put. forward
words . . . only to throw them overboard when the change in events

A makes the position‘ diﬂicult for us . . . i

"‘It is important that our position in regard to China should
never be subject to the slightest doubt . . . When Formosa was made
I a province of China, nobody raised any lawyers’ doubts about that . . .

“Now . ._ . the situation has changed. (Some) believe that the

4 forces now in control of the mainland of China . . . are not friendly
to us, andtherefore they want to say’: ‘Well, we have to wait for a
(Japanese) treaty.’ We did. not wait for a treaty on Korea. We did

not wait for a treaty on the islands over which we have trusteeship.

“. . . The United States of America, Mr. Truman said this morn-

ing, is not going to quibble on any lawyer's words about theintegrity

of our position. Therefore . . . we are not going to use our forces in
connection~'with the present situation in Formosa . . .”

 the question of intervention, the State Department had declared

on Dec. 23, 1949: ~ ‘ _ '
“Formosa, politically, geographically and strategically is part of

‘China. . . . Although ruled by the Japanese for 50 years, historically

it has been Chinese. Politically and militarily itis astrictly Chinese
responsibility.” (Italics added.)

The outbreak of the Korean war was the occasion for announcing a
reversal in policy. On June 27,1950," President Truman stated:

“The occupation of -Fortﬂosa by Communist forceswould be a l_

, direct. threat to ‘the security of the Paciﬁc area and to _the United
States forces in that area. Accordingly, I have ordered the 7th‘
Fleet to prevent-any attack on Formosa‘. ' J

\

“As apcorollary of this action I am calling upon the Chinese
government on Formosato cease all air and sea operations against
the mainland. The 7th Fleet will see that this is done.

“The determination of the.future,status1of Formosa must await .

the _restoration_ of security in the Paciﬁc, a peace settlement with
Japan, or consideration by the United Nations.”

A Thus did the Truman of June 27 contradict the Truman of January 5. .

One point in the President’s statement merits special .attentio'n.iHis'
order to Chiang Kai-shek to respect the neutralization, backed by the

assertion: “The 7th Fleet will see that this is done,” makes a mockery of.
later talk about the “sovereign” government of Formosa. Long after this ,.

directive Washington was steadfastly denying, particularly in the case of
Soviet protests to the U. S.,over Chiang’s seizure of its merchantmen in

China waters, that the United States was in a position to control the For-‘ i

mosa regime's activities.

While the shift seemed solely a result of the Korean ﬁghting, there
had been earlier signs that something was in the wind. -

On June 14, 1,950, the New York Herald Trz'bune’s Marguerite. Hig- My 1"

gins reported from Tokyo that MacArthur would propose a new formula
for “saving Formosa” during the forthcoming visit to Japan of Defense
Secretary Louis Johnson, Gen. Omar Bradley, and John Foster Dulles.

Subsequent dispatches hinted that the visiting ofﬁcials were “coming
around?’ to the MacArthur way of thinking. A further indication that
these stories were not without foundation and that Korea may have been
