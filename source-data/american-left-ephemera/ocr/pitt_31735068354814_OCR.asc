Shelving of Bil H-8.

is victorystor people

OTTAWA, Ont.—Bill H-8, described
by Canadian labor as an “open door to
fascism,” has been shelved by the
Dominion’s Parliament until its No-
vember session. , .

The decision to put off any further
action on the dangerous bill was taken -
as a victory for labor and other\_advo-
‘cates of civil rights who have been
conducting a Fvigorous campaign against

the measure. The delay means they

- 1-«will have additibnal weeks to. explain

A p it dropped considerably from‘the fig-

4

\

to the. people the threat to liberty con-
tained in Bill H-8. ‘ V A
I Both-the Toronto Trades and Labor
Council and the Hamilton Labor Coun-
cilthave gone on record against the
bill. The danger of the proposal was
shown in an editorial printed by the

_ Financial Post, July’ 12. The editorial

commented that the .railway workers
are opening negotiations and have come
forward with a number of‘ demands. It
went on:

“CCL. president Mosherin a public:
statement a ‘ few days ago threatens
another railroad strike. In view of the
government action following the 10-day

VANCOUVER, B. C.—-—With 19 mem-
bers in a legislature .ofV48, but prom-
ised the support of six Liberal mem-
.bers,.the Social CreditIParty is now
the government‘ of British Columbia.

T he Cooperative Commonwealth
Federat.ion,Awith 18' seats and the prob-
ablesupport of Tom Uphill, veteran
Labor‘ member from .Fernie, still re-
mains, although in a stronger position,
as opposition. » '

Uphill was the only candidate nomi-
nated by the Labor Representation
..Committee to be ‘gected, although Leo ‘
Nimsick, CCF candidate and Mine Mill
member endorsed by the LRC, also .
made the grade without difficulty in v
C1'anbrook-Kimberly;

THE CCF received the. largest per-
centage of the popular votefalthough

ure of the last election, as did also the .
total number of CCF voters, although
the ballot resulted in a. record turnout
overall. _ i

If the CCF had, taken a more posi-
tive ‘stand on the: world question of
peace, as did the CCF government in

« Saskatchewan the week before the .
B.'C. elections, there.’ is no doubtthat. 0
they could have been ._elected with 9;
large majority. . _

CCF pussy-footi-ang on this, and on 

' the many unpopular measures ofjthem.
late Coalition government, - such as ,
taxation 'disgui.d-ed as‘ Hospital Insur-
ance-, and the thoroughly unpoﬁiillarv .
Sales . Tax and excessive auto taxes, 
swung a lot of the protest vote over to,
the Social Creditors, who thus derived
their support from both the extreme
Tory‘ right, (the Conservative Party,
with only two members, is almost
eliminated). and he leftist CCF.

BUT THE GREATEST single fac-
tor to the defeat of the CCF was un-
doubtedly their support of Steel raid-
ers in Trail. This was fully demon-
strated in the election of those CCF‘
candidates who disavowed and repudi-
ated the raiding policy, and the defeat.
of’ others, better known to._the elector- I‘
ate, who had been identified‘ with it. .
No raid supporter was elected.

It may ultimately. de.velop:,, if the;

V Socreds display enough/poli't'ical7acu-

men, that B. C. party politics will be’
resolved. into a Socred right and a ’
CCF left. 0 -

, With the. former in many respects
much more reactionary than even the
Tories, the situation. calls for the great-
est‘ degree of unity within the labor
forces, a unity that is fortunately now
being welded as far as the rank-and-“

- Vfile is concerned under the pressure of’

the mounti pg strikepcrisis being pro-
. moted by e “Hold the Line” policy
of the bosses on wages and conditions.

tie-up of two years ago, it is inconceiv-
able that the federal authorities would
not insist on the matter being referred
promptly to compulsory arbitration. .
‘‘In that ‘case the railway unions,
like the Toronto District Trades and
Labor Council, may suddenlyawalcen
to the fact that it is an indictable
offense under Canadian, law to deprive

citizens of light, power, gas or water
services or prevent the running: of‘

street cars or trains through breach of
contract. A change clarifying’ the word-

ing. of the law was included in the

Criminal Code revisions before the
Senate . . . ”

Thesectionof Bill H-8 referred to
by the Post is aimed at limiting and
seriously restricting the right to strike.
Another section limits picketing. Still
another shocking, section would actually

deny Canadians the right to criticize-

the foreign. policy of their government.

Sellout hits,

,Reprlnted» from Canadian UE News

The prize. combination play of textile
employers, government -‘and, sell-out

right-wingers in the trade union move- ,

ment has proved to be. a rigged “vote”.
ordered by the (Quebec) Duplessis La-
bor Department,_alvote they couldn’t
lose. ‘ . " A

, All was arranged, even extra. voters
(!), except. that they didn’t ‘announce
their '/ballot count beforehand’.

Such’ a “settlement” means a sup-
posed raise—11c—-but‘ a cut inpbonus
earnings: and speedup. which. means: -4

net lossof up to 20¢ an hour and’ more.

This ‘kind of settlement. has become

- the general practice in both ‘ textile
centers in the United SLtatese—a. down-
ward settlement on wage matters—-
within the past three to. four years.’

Only as recently as May of this year
the union_ in textilelat the ‘American
Woolen Co. signed. a2-year contract
w-hich the-company’ claimed would save
it more than 30c an hour in Wage costs
because of workload changes. For ex-
ample, a worker formerly tending four
to six looms now has six to 12 to look.
after.

IN ANOTHER CASE, just. a couple
of weeks ago, an arbitration panel.
“awarded” a wage cut amounting to
7.7c anhour in a dispute at Bates Man-

National Lead Council, following a two-
day conference here of delegates from
National Lead locals around the coun-
try. President of the Council is Odis
Bowins of Local 632 in-Indianapolis,

of the United Electrical,_Radio & Ma-
chine Workers, who came __from the
Carter plant of National Lead‘ in Chi-
cago. . * 3

After reporting‘ on "and discussing

, the present bargaining picture, the Adel-

egates recommended {that all National
Lead locals step "Cup their bargaining
activities immediately. They. called ‘for
mass meetings each local community,
for’ setting up special committees in
each local to publicize‘ Mine-Mill's ’de-
mands by leaflets" and radio programs,
and that all preparations for strike-ac-
tion be taken. A"

By-laws ‘ adopted‘ at’ the conference
have already been sent’ out ‘to all Na-
tional Lead loca1s,'for~,discussion and
action_.by the membership." "A, letter

The conference also proposed that

litical action committee includingone A
or more representatives from each
shop or local union.

The delegates urged that in line with ‘
Mine—Mill’s tradition of independent
political_ action, National Lead locals
“actively tpwrticipate in elections at ’
every level to defeat public officials
regardless of party who fail to serve
the people’s, needs and to support those
candidates regardless of party who will
fight forrathe gcnuineonterests of that
people.” ’ .

NEUVQ ’ LAREDO, Mexico —‘ ‘How
free ‘is the freedom of the“ United

by /a great many residents -of this

About a month ago, V. L. Toledano,
progressive candidate for Mexican
president, visited Nuevo’ Laredo for ‘a
campaign speech. Among other things,
he attacked the ‘control, which Wall‘
Street’ holds over Mexico's economy.
Many of the Mexican workers wheat-
tended the rally applauded Toledano’s
speech. ~ -' ' c

in this townrequested .40 of those who‘

mits, under which they ‘have, been ‘ I
-. crossing into Laredo, Texas, for many

THIS FAIRY TALE
PAYS $$ TO BOSS

NEW roux (FP)—American busi-_

ness makes an extra $5.4 billion in

profits each year by, promoting the,

fairy tale that women
ferior to men.
According to the 1950 census, aver-
age wage for women in factories was
$1,285 a year less than that received

Workers are in-

by men. Multiplied by the 4,171,000 A
women in factories, this yearly short- ,

changing on the basis of sex adds up
to the additional $5.4 billion‘ in profits
for the employers. --
