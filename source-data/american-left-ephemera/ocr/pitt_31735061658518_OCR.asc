azi formula

THE NAZI FORMULA for anti-Semitic activities fol-
lows three simple steps, the A, B, C of fascist success.
- . (a) Discredit the Jews. Depict them as aggressively cruel

. and shamefully meek, disgustingly rich and disgust-
ingly poor, ultra-reactionary and ultra-radical, un-
civilized ignoramuses and conniving geniuses. Make
them hateful to all sections of the population. Use
everything from lies to forgeries, for, as Hitler wrote
in Mein Kampf, “The very enormity of a lie contri-
butes to its success.”

(b). Identiﬁcation of the Jews with the main objectives.
If you hate the Jews and are made to believe they
run the Roosevelt Administration then you must
hate the Roosevelt Administration. If John Q. be-
lieves Lie No. 1 why shouldn't he believe Lie No. 2?

(c) Attack. Follow up the propaganda barrage with phy-
sical attack. Beat up individual Jews, groups, break
store windows, wreck synagogues, start riots. Later
these acts of violence and terror can be turned
against the important objectives.

IT AIN'T FUNNY, MC GEE

When we analyze the “First American” leaﬂet in relation
to the Nazi formula it's no longer a joke. It becomes .a clever
example of..steps (a) and (b). In essence this “joke” states
it is the .non‘-Jews who are the ‘heroes and ﬁghters in this
war. The implication is that the Jews are cowards, they
don't do the ﬁghting. Not only that, but while the non-
Jews are ﬁghtingand dying, the Jews are home using up
that precious war material, rubber.

‘ The “joke” further implies it is a Jewish war, not a
people's war. If the Jews stay home and reap beneﬁts from
the war, for what are the non-Jews sacriﬁcing and ﬁghting?

Following this reasoning to its logical conclusion, it is not
difficult to see why many people have«been heard to say,
“What we need in this country is a Hitler to wipe out the
Jews.” Step (a), it slanders the Jews; step (b), it makes the
war a Jewish war. . . V

I guess there will be some readers who will say, “Come
now, nobody is going to reach subversive conclusions from
such a joke. They’ll just laugh it off good natured1y.” To

' put aside all doubts that this leaﬂet is the work of some

harmless humorist, catch a back copy of the New York
newspaper PM (Dec. 22, ’42). PM reported that research
institutions investigated this leaﬂet and found that with
minor variations it has been recopied, carbon-copied,
printed, and mimeographed by the hundreds of thousands.
The Baldwin Locomotive Works, a N. Y. shipyard, the War
Production Board, a Wall St. barber shop, the Boston Army
base, Watertown Arsenal, Charlestown (Mass.) Navy Yard,
and Boston City Hall comprise a partial list of places where
the leaﬂet has been circulated. _It has been found in citie
and towns all across the country. . ‘
Many of us have lost our- sensitivity about slanderous
jokes due to the loose conception of humor whipped up by

TI-Iollywood, the radio and the press. We seem to think that

if these mighty institutions deliver jokes which ridicule
Jews, Negroes and foreign born, it can’t be so harmful. Of
course, exactly the opposite is true. The prestigeot these
institutions which inﬂuence the opinions of the majority of
our population, only multiply the danger when they -use
such so—caIled humor.

A JOKE'S A JOKE — BUT

I have yet to listen to a program of “Can You Top This”
without hearing at least one joke ridiculing a Jew, Negro,
Italian, or some other American group.‘ Imaginejwhat im-
pression of Jews is created by characters like Mrs. Nussbaum
of the Fred Allen program, or the Goldbergs, etc., etc.

In normal times, jokes which ridicule people of any race,
color or nationality are certainly not in keeping with the

' 5

  

great American principle, “All men are created equal." But
now we are at war.. Our country is ﬁghting for its existence
against the most bestial enemy in history. An enemywhose
olﬁcial policy calls for the domination of the entire world,
for the oppressing and extermination of all Jews, Slavs and
Negroes, and in practise — all non-Germans.

. This isn't just my interpretation. The Nazis have broad-
castthis policy to all corners of the earth. They have printed

 

untold millions of books, pamphlets and articles about it,‘

even trying to justify it scientiﬁcally.

In such times the greatest need of our country is the
closest and friendliest unity of all people regardless of race,
color, nationality or creed for the best efforts on the battle-
front and the home front. In such times ridicule and slander
which cause mistrust and disunity of our people, are trea-
sonous.

There are over 100 fascist and semi-fascist organizations
in the United States whose open policy is anti-Semitic. Year
in and year out they issue reams of material. It is estimated
their periodicals (newspapers and magazines) reach be-
tween 6 and 7 million readers. They print cartoons of Jews
(grossly caricatured) murdering Christians and raping gen-
tile girls. In some sparsely-settled sections of our country
there are people who believe Jews have horns and tails.
Such extreme cases emphasize the effect some of this printed
material can have.

"RESPECTABLE" ANTI-SEMITISM

The hate drive against, the Jews is not only_carried out
by these small, openly-violent fascist organizations; or even
the larger but equally fascist outﬁts of Father Coughlin and
the Christian Front. Some of the so-called respectable daily
newspapers with the largest circulations in the United
States spread the same anti-Jewish germ. in a more subtle
manner. This includes the whole Hearst chain, the N. Y.
Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, the WashingtonTz'mes-
Herald and numerous other city newspapers scattered
throughout the country.

For example, at this writing the N. Y. Daily News is?

headlining some insinuations that the meat shortage is
due to the Kosher meat dealers. Further onin these pages
we will see other_ methods used by the press inpopularizing
thepropaganda of our enemy. It is important to note that
the above mentioned papers all supported the America

First Committee before Pearl Harbor and today are united‘

on an appeasement-isolationist program.

POISON PEDDLERS, INC.

V This daily poison is supplemented by weekly and monthly

periodicals headed by the Saturday Evening Post and the
Reader’s Digest. The classical example of the type of vicious
material put out by these “respectable” mags appeared in
the March 28, 1942 issue of the Saturday Evening Post
which boasts of 3,000,000 readers. Right on the front cover,
displayed on thousands of news stands in every state of our
Union, was the prominent headline, “The Case Against the
Jew” by Milton Mayer. .

Using Goebbel’s arguments, Mr. Mayer attempts to con-
vince his readers that some of the worst slanders against the
Jews are justiﬁed and that Jews are typically that way.
While the magazine was careful to have a Jew write this
article, it could not prevent a storm of protest, which made
the editors print a left-handed apology. ' _ '

Mayer’s conclusions in this article are very signiﬁcant,
“Denouncing Coughlin won’t save him (the Jew-S.V.).
The destruction of Hitler won’t save him.” This theory is
not very startling when you read that in an interview after
the article was written, Mayer is quoted as stating, “I still

think the war is wrong —— and I'll go on thinking it.” There"

you have it! Slander of the Jews leads to defense of Hitler.
which naturally leads to action against our war effort or in
other words —— treason.

The “respectable” propagandists of Jew-hatred worm
their way up even into the hallowed halls of the U. S.
Congress. Dozens of Congressmen and Senators, lined up
with the appeasement forcesin this country, have a standard
trade mark—anti—Semitism. Hardly a week passes but at

7

least one of these gentlemen uses the highest tribunal of
our land’ to feed the anti-Jewish propaganda machine.
Here is an example of the type of drivel they expound:
“The international ﬁnanciers, largely international Jews,
with a few international gentiles . . . who own and control
the gold supply of the world. They "have ‘controlled the
world through the gold standard ever since the Rothschilds.
. . . They are now crucifying civilization on a cross of gold.”
(Congressman J. E. Rankin, Congressional Record, April

25, 1941, p. A2032.)
THE BIGGER TI-IE LIE . . .

The -big banks and insurance companies, which are closely
interlocked, can buy and sell America. Together they own
and control the major industries, transportation facilities,
public utilities, real estate, and the natural resources of our
country. ‘ .

,The~editors of the conservative magazine Fortune con-
ducted an impartial survey called “Jews in America” which
has since been published in book form by Random House.
They name names and give ﬁgures. In answer to the ques-
tion “Do Jews monopolize industry?” they state: “And the
fact is this: that there is no basis whatever for the sugges-

tion that Jews monopolize U. S. business and industry. First .

of all and very deﬁnitely, they do not run banking. They

play little or no part in the great commercial houses. . .

The absence of Jews in the insurance business is note-
worthy.’.’.

It is not my purpose to give a detailed expose of all the
organizations and individuals conducting this Hitlerite
hate-campaign. .But even these few examples show the im-
pressive sewer systemconducting the flow of Jew-hating bile
to all corners of our country. It would be ridiculous to be-
lieve that this system had a natural and spontaneous devel-
opment. It is too obviously thework of skilled technicians
bought and paid for by that section of high ﬁnance sympa-
thetic to Hitler and his fascist cause. '

Let us examinefhow step (b) of the Nazi formula was and
is. being used to undermine our war effort.

8

 

he label method

FOR WANT of a better name let us call step (b) the
“Label Method.” A skull and crossed bones label placed on
a bottle signiﬁes that the.bottle contains poison. Place the
same label on a bottle of water -and for most people it will
mean “hands off.” Simple, isn't it? “If we can get large sec-
tions of the population to connect Jews with poison,” say
the Nazis, “then we merely have to place the Jewish label
on our main objectives.”

How is this working out right now? Unquestionably one
of the main objectives of the Fifth Column is to turn the
minds of the people against the war. This work began even
further back but let us pick it up about three months before
Pearl Harbor. On Sept. 10, 1941 the N. Y. Daily News in-

formed its readers in an editorial that there are two types

of anti—Semites; one group are genuine Jew-haters, says the
News. In the other group are “those who are called anti-
Semites by the more enthusiastic war-mongers — who believe
the United States should not send an army of ‘millions of
men —for hundreds of thousands would not be enough-
to Europe to avenge upon Hitler the wrongs he has inflicted
on the Jews in Europe.”

Unscramble this mess and what have you got? The only
reason there can be for ﬁghting Hitler is to revenge the
Jews in Europe. Therefore, people who say it is a Jewish
war are not anti-Semites—oh, no! -—they are sensible pa-
triots.,It seems the editors of the News were not informed
that Hitler had conquered most of Europe; had beaten back
England and bombed her cities; had treacherously attacked
the Soviet Union; had formed the so-called “Anti-Comin-
tern” Axis with Italy, Japan and several minor powers
which openly declared its intention to destroy the “decay-
ing democracies,” including America.

  

LINDBERGH CARRIES ON 3

Watch step Number‘ 2 develop. On the very next day,
Sept. 11th, in Des Moines, Iowa, Charles Lindbergh, his
heart still warm from the medal presented him by Hitler,
made his infamous speech at an America First rally. It is
worth studying this quote from the America First Commit-
tee’s lanky, leading light.

“The Administration, the Jews and the American-British
are the three major agitators for American entry into the
war. They knew the people had no intention of going to
war, so they planned ﬁrst to prepare the United States for

foreign war under the guise of American defense; second,

to involve us in the war step by step, without our realiza-
tion; third, to create a series of incidents which would force
us into the actual conflict.

“If any of these groups— the British, the Jewish or the
Administration stops agitating for war, I believe there will
be little danger of our involvement.

“Tolerance is a virtue that depends on peace and strength.
A few far sighted Jewish people realize this, but the major-
ity still do not. Their greatest danger to this country lies in
their large ownership and inﬂuence in our motion pictures,
our press, our radio and government.”

Lindbergh learned Hitler’s lesson well. If a lie has to be

 

.p—--«~ e 4.

big to be successful, this one ought to hit the jackpot. Lind-

bergh blames the British, the Jews and the Administration
for drawing us into war. However, with his last paragraph
he places his whole emphasis on the Jews. He makes sure
the whole Jewish people are blamed, notice the words “few”
and “majority.” He calls for an end to tolerance. Of course
the innocent lambs leading the fascist Axis have nothing
to do with starting the war. Although three months later,
Pearl Harbor should have smashed this theory, the Lind-
bergh poison had already achieved its purpose.

The Reader’s Digest took pains to label the government
‘-‘Jewish dominated” by printing an article “The Facts
About Jews in Washington” condensed from the book
“Washington Is Like That” by W. M. Kiplinger. This
article implied in a polite way what Hitler and Coughlin
have been spouting loudly.

10

 

E.  Garner, publisher of the paper Publicity, of Wichita,
Kansas, went further on March 12, 1942, three months after
Pearl Harbor. He stated: “With your loyal support and
distribution to right thinking Americans, the Mongolian
Jew Controlled Roosevelt Dictatorship will be smashed."

BOTH ENDS AGAINST THE MIDDLE

The “label method” is used with great energy against the
Communists. The Nazis use both ends of their spears. First
they label the Communist movement “Jewish,” then they
label the Jews “Communists.” They use either one or both
against other objectives. To the Roosevelt Administration
they apply both labels. But it would be difficult to apply the
Jewish “label” to the trade union movement of over 12
million organized workers.

The labor movement is the key in successful war produc-
tion. To split it, to destroy it, is a key objective of the Fifth
Column and reactionary industrialists who place victory
over unionism before victory over Hitler. Having used the
Jewish label to help “poison” the Communists, it is much
easier to paste the Communist label on the trade union.
This practice is too common to need examples. It has been
used against every progressive organization and individual
of any prominence.

William Randolph Hearst with his large chain of gutter
sheets was among the initiators of this label and one of the
foremost exponents of this method. Congresman Dies be-
came Hitler's darling by using this method to cover all the
truly subversive activities taking place with his knowledge
and approval. Mr. Dies is one of the 'most—quoted Americans
by the Goebbel’s radio in Berlin. Vice-President Wallace
explained that Dies could not do more damage to the war
effort if he were in the pay of Hitler.

Enough about step Number 2 in the Nazi formula. Suf-
ﬁce it to say that hardly a day goes by that the appeaser
press does not fail, directly or indirectly, to use this label
method to confuse the people about the war, the admini-
stration, rationing, price control, labor and every other
phase of the war effort. -

ram words to violence

THE FINAL and logical step in the Nazi- formula is
action. If the Fifth Column could mobilize enough people
to effectively attain its objectives without steps one and two,
it would not hesitate. It is a tribute to the inherent Ameri-
can quality of brotherhood and tolerance, that extensive
groundwork has been laid by steps one and two without
yielding the expected results instep three.

Although the ﬁfth column has not achieved its desired
results, it has had some successes. Most of its actions thus
far could be described as “training scrimmages.” The most
common of these practice sessions are smal1—scale attacks
against Jewish individuals, Jewish-owned stores, or homes
and synagogues.

In practically every major city and most minor cities
reports of these attacks appear from time to time in the
local press with little space and no editorial comment. Need
I take the time here to give details about the store windows
broken in the heart of the Chicago Loop; about the Jewish
air raid wardens beaten in the Bronx; about the synagogues
burned in Long Island, Harlem, etc.; about the few hundred
young people who gathered in a skating rink in Boston,
left in a body, beat up young Jewish children, broke store
windows, and yelled slogans like “There will be no more
Jews on Jewel Hill after the war”; or about 1001 other in-
_cidents all over the country training the storm troopers of
tomorrow?

i>ocRoMs FOR AMERICA

It would be naive to believe that these actions are merely
spontaneous outbursts. The more than 1.00 openly fascist
and anti-Semitic organizations have been printing leaﬂets,
pamphlets, magazines and newspapers calling foraction
against the Jews. ~«

The most recent and vicious example of the way these
organizations work can be seen in the Detroit anti-Negro
outbreak. Led by Gerald K. Smith’s American First Party,
the Ku Klux Klan, the Hitlerite National Workers League,
former Black Legionnaires, _etc., this organized pogrom has
so far resulted in 28 deaths and 700 wounded.

Federal and local authorities have been called upon to
investigate and prosecute these leaders in Detroit. Back in
March, 1942, Parker Sage, labor spy and leader in the
Black Legion, at the headquarters of the National Workers
League, predicted ‘Japanese victories and stated, “there
won’t be a kike left in the American nation’ a year after

Nothing was done about these warnings. Now we see
the result and feel the terrible harm to our war effort.
Already, the Detroit agents of Hitler are following up the
attack on the Negroes with a wide distribution of anti-
Semitic leaﬂets. ' 7 ‘

Joe McWilliams, Christian Front Leader, toured import-
ant cities inﬂaming his audiences with prophecies that the
slaughter of Jews in America would put the Nazi pogroms
to shame. Before Social Justice was barred from the mail,
Coughlin warned that if action was taken against his paper
torrents of Jewish blood would ﬂow in American streets. ‘

Certainly Lindbergh’s DesiMoines speech implying that
this was no time for “tolerance” was not misconstrued by

First American “joke” was not "created to stir laughter but
rather bitterness which would foster violent demonstrations.

Evenwhile all this is preliminary training for massac-

some major objectives. Back in 1939 Representative Jacob
Thorkelson, Wheeler's pal, sincendefeated in the elections,
referred to President Roosevelt as Rosenvelt in “off the

Semites, many such audiences have been reported by these
newspapers as calling for President Roosevelt's assassination.

To Czech and Sl0vak—AI11ericaI1 Headers

our Order has issued this pamphlet on a very
timely subject. For, now, when our country is preparing
to deal crushing blows to Hitler and his Axis, the friends
cf fascism in America are trying to weaken this blow by
disuniting the people.

Anti-Semitism was one of Hitler's main weapons to
divide the people so he could conquer Europe. We,
Americans of Slovak descent, know that Hitler's helpers
in Slovakia told the people that all the troubles of that
unhappy nation are due to the Czechs and Jews. Tiso
and Tuka deported all Czechs and sent all Jews to certain
death in ghettos established in conquered Poland. But
Slovakia's troubles have not ended, because her real ene-

Amies are the Hitlerites and not the Jews nor the ‘Czechs.

The people of Slovakia learned this. They sheltered the
Slovak Iews, hid them from the Hlinka guards, helped
them escape to join the armies of the Allies.

The Hitler trick of anti-Semitism must not succeed in
America. Americans, and particularly, Americans of
Czech and Slovak descent must refuse to become victims
of Hitlerism in any of its forms. This pamphlet will help
unmask the many lies that are spread insidiously to di-
vide us. Read it carefully. Give it to your friends to read.

TARGET FOR ATTACK

If the Fifth Column can be successful in leading mass
violence against the Jews, how simple would it be to turn
such a mob against a “ ewish” Civilian Defense Office, a
“Jewish” trade union office, a “Jewish” war plant, or even
a “Jewish” President? Surveying the records of newspaper
reports about these attacks, we ﬁnd that most cases were not
followed up by investigations of the local authorities. In

some places action was taken to whitewash offenders. Where

some arrests were made there were only a few recorded con-
victions.

IT'S=;AN ANCIENT TACTIC

Some readers may question, “Why blame the Nazis for
anti-Semitism which has existed for centuries?” Let it be
clear that we do not blame the Nazis for creating anti-
Semitism. We accuse them of using it and spreading it as an
instrument to crush civilization. A study of the history of
anti-Semitism only strengthens the case against the Nazis.

It is true that the Pandora's Box of anti-Semitism was
opened many centuries -ago and the virus of hatred and
prejudice against the Jews encouraged to multiply. But,
during many periods and in many countries the anti-toxin
of people's struggles for freedom would succeed in destroy-
ing most of these germs. These were periods such as Vice-
President Wallace spoke of in his historic “Century of the
Common Man” speech. He said:

“_\The march of freedom of the past one hundred and
ﬁfty years has been a long-drawn-out people’s revolution.
In this great revolution of the people, there were the Ameri-
can Revolution of 1776, the French Revolution of I792,
the Latin American revolution of the Bolivian era, the Ger-
man Revolution of 1848, and the Russian Revolution of
1917.” 4

But all through these centuries there were also periods of
counter-revolution. Periods in which the anti-Semitic germs
thrived in the ﬁlth of reaction. The authoritative study

14

 

 

“Organized Anti-Semitism in America" by Donald S. Strong
and published by the American Council on Public Affairs
states: “As a political ideology, anti-Semitism without an
anti—revolutionary aspect is so rare as to be almost unknown
. . .” and further, “. . . the ideology spread by anti-Semitic
groups in the United States is the same as that which ac-
companied certain political developments in Russia before
World War I, in Poland and Hungary shortly after that
war, and more recently in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.”

Today the ﬁercest counter-revolution against human
progress, the Nazi-fascist counter-revolution, has again
picked up the thread and started the greatest anti~Semitic
wave in history. ’

In these few pages we have seen not the record but rather
a short description of how anti-Sernitism is being used to
knife the war effort and bring fascism’ to this country. Patri-
otic Americans, using no other source of information than
reactionary newspapers, cannot answer in their own minds

the propaganda of the anti-Semites. There is littlecounter

propaganda in motion pictures or radio.

15‘

n the record  

THE LATE Pope Pius XI stated on September 6, 1938,
“Through Christ and in Christ weare the spiritual descend-
ants of Abraham. No, it is not possible for Christians to
participate in anti-Semitism.”

From the days of the ancient Hebrew prophets through

' the centuries, the Jews have contributed constructively top

the development of world civilization on a level equal to
any other people. \
' To list a few names like the Kings David and Solomon,
Philo of Alexandria, Josephus, Spinoza, Karl Marx, Men-
delsohn, Freud, Doctors Erlich and Einstein, Henri Berg-
son, etc., etc., is to list some of the world’s greatest thinkers
in‘ the ﬁelds of philosophy, social science and practical
science. ‘ A . 1

A glorious thread of Jewish contributions runs through
the history of America beginning with the voyage of Colum-
bus, in which at least ﬁve Jews participated. Misguided anti-
Semites, who think that Jews are tight-ﬁsted money hoard-
ers, would do well to read the letter of James Madison about
Haym Salomon who was outstanding among hundreds of
Jews in aiding to ﬁnance the American Revolution. Madi-
son wrote, “. . . I have for some time been a pensioner on
the favor of Haym Salomon, a Jew broker. I am almost
ashamed to acknowledge my wants so incessantly to you,
but they begin to be so urgent that it is impossible to sup-
press. The kindness of our little friend in S. Front St. near
the coffee house, is a fund that will preserve me from
extremities, but I never resort to it without great mortiﬁ-
cation as he obstinately rejects all recompense. The price of
money is so usurious that he thinks it ought to be exorted
from none but those who aim at proﬁtable speculation.”

AMERICA WILL NOT FORGET

It is difficult to think that Americans would retain pre-ju-

dices against the Jewish people when all _around them‘-, in

every phase of American life, Jews have and still are, con-'

tributing to the well being, the education, and the culture
of the country as a whole. ' J

A reminder of just a few examples show how; Jews have

‘helped develop a fuller and richer life for all Americans."

The last World's Fair, held in New York, had a tremendous ii

exhibition showing the wonders given to the world by that
wizard of electricity Charles P. Steinmetz. Leaders of the

worldmourned the death of Franz Boas, ourmost authori- A

tative anthropologist.

The music of George Gershwin will be enjoyedby Ameri~i ‘

cans for generations to come, long after the anti-Semites
will be forgotten. Millions pay homage to the -magical
strains poured forth from the violins of Jascha Heifetz and

«Mischa Elman; just as they laugh with kings of comedians,

Eddie Cantor and Jack Benny; just as they thrill with the
entertainment of Paul Muni_, Al Jolson and Edward.G.
Robinson; just as they dance to the favorite’ bands of Harry
James and Benny Goodman. — ’ J.
Just as ﬁne theatre is identiﬁed with the late David Bel-

asco, so is newspaper constructiveness identiﬁed with the

iate Joseph Pulitzer. Two; more Jews who rose to the top
in spite of discrimination. Lovers of art place Raphael Soyer
among the great painters. No list of America’s best writers
would omit Waldo Frank. . — ~

To speak about the former Governor Herbert H. Lehman
is to think of good government. Many great men have
served and will serve in our Supreme Court, but none will.
win greater love and respect from the American people than
the late Louis D. Brandeis and the late Benjamin N..Car-
doza.

America is considered one of the most sport conscious-

nations and in this ﬁeld Jews have won their places with
the best. Football fans pay tribute to Benny Friedman, All

American; baseball fans to Hank_Greenberg; boxing fans to‘

.17

 

the former light-Weight champion of the world, Benny"

Leonard; etc., etc.

But no athlete has captured the heart of America as
much as the former lightweight champion Barney Ross.
Barney joined the U.S. Marines to help score a knockout
against Hitlerism. He is now recovering from serious in-
juries received while defending his wounded comrades from

attacking Japanese on a South Pacific island. Sing1e—handed, _

he held the fascists off all night, until help arrived.
TALK Anour COURAGE

Yes, it is the military history of our country in which
Jewish participation is most glorious. Col; Isaac Franks,
aide-de-camp to George. Washington, and Major Benjamin
Nones, French Jew who left a proﬁtable wine business -in
Bordeaux to serve under Lafayette for the hard pressed
Americans, head an impressive list of Jewish heroes who
served on the battleﬁeld to win independence for our
country. ' '

In the American Revolution and in every war since that
time Jews served in the American armed forces in greater
proportion than their ratio to the population. In all these
wars Jews distinguished themselves for bravery. Speaking
for the Union Army during the Civil War, General Oliver
0. Howard wrote: “I had a Jewish aide-de-camp, one of

‘the bravest and best, in the battle of Bull Run . . . I had

another aide who was killed at the Battle of Chancellors-
ville, a true and brave officer. Two of my brigade command-
ers answered to the above description. Intrinsically there
are no more patriotic men to be found in the country than
those who claim to be of Hebrew descent and who served
with me in parallel commands or directly under my in-
structions.”

IN WORLD WAR I

Julian Leavitt, Director of the Office of War Records
for World War I, wrote in a preliminary report: “The

J States, however, have constituted from 4 to 5 per cent of the

entire Jewish population of the country, according to the
latest estimates, is about 3 per cent of the total population.

The Oﬂice of War Records lists a total of 1,132 Honors
and Citations received by Jews for the services in the last.
war. Three Jews received the highest award of our country,»
the Congressional Medal of Honor, and 142 received the
Distinguished Service Cross. General Pershing stated after
the war, “When the time came to serve their country under
arms, no class of people served with more patriotism or;
with higher motives than the young Jews who volunteered
or were drafted and who went overseas with our other
young Americans. I well remember in my inspections of
New York divisions seeing so many patriotic, well-disci-
plined, well-behaved young Jewish soldiers whose com-
manders spoke of them in the highest terms.”

Especially in this war against the most vicious, uncivilized
enemies of mankind are the Jews distinguishing themselvesw
Already, before America's major forces have been brought
face to face with the enemy, many Jews are among the out-
standing heroes. The “First American” leaﬂet which intro-

was Sergeant Meyer Levin, young Brooklyn Jew, who,
acting as Captain Kelly's bombardier, released the bombs
that sunk the S.S. Haruna. Like Kelly, Levin later died
risking his life for his shipmates when their plane crashed:
At the time of his death he was the holder of the Disting-
uished Flying Cross, the Silver Star award, and others.

All America has paid tribute to Levin, to the ﬁghting-
Marine Barney Ross, to Sergeant Irving Strobing who stuck
to his wireless in Corregidor until he was stopped by the
swarming Japanese, to Ensign Ira Weil Jeffery who died
ﬁghting heroically at Pearl Harbor, to Lt. Henry Mark,
killed while trying to stop Japanese tanks in the Philip-
pines, and to many other Jewish ﬁghters.

YET...

_ In the February-March 1943 issue of The Protestant,
Joseph Brainin, in an article, .“Anti-Semitism Triumphant,”
wrote: “In the vault of an organization that prides itself

on itsrecord of successfully combating anti-Semitism lies a

copy of a conﬁdential -poll of public opinion taken in Dec.,
1942.. This scientiﬁcally conducted survey reveals that the
Jews, more than any other ‘religious, national or racial

groups’ in this country ‘are viewed as ‘a threat (menace)
to America.’ In the East, the Jews lead the Germans by six
per cent, the Japanese by ﬁve per cent and the Fascists,

who are also listed as a group, by fourteen per cent _in this

011. , v

P “That the anti-Semitic propaganda about Jews being
slackers and war proﬁteers has scored throughout the coun-
try is proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by this conﬁ-
dential poll, which contains twent-y-one questions. Italso
provides incontrovertible evidence that Nazi and Fascist
propaganda about -the war being ‘Jewish-made,’ about the
Jews, ‘having too much power’ and about ‘Jewish control
of .thé;gov‘e1:nmen.t in. Washington’ has permeated a large
number of Americans in every walk of life.”

 

‘ !Hbw is it-' possible, in view of the record the American’

Jews have made, in view of the democratic war we are ﬁght-

ing, that‘ the poll mentioned above indicates as answer to
one of the questions that “one out of ﬁve Americans is

readytto join in an anti-Semitic crusade?”

 

ow do they get away with 

INDEED! How do they? Ourcountry is ﬁghting a war’

for survival against an enemy which has made "physical

extermination of Jews an official policy. They have used‘

anti-Semitic propaganda to divide and conquer most of the
nations of Europe. In every country they have overpowered,
the actions against the Jews werefollowed by the enslaving

and murdering of any and all people who opposed the

Nazi rule.

Is it possible that anybody can interpret the present,‘ in-
tense anti-Jewish campaign as anything but Nazi activity?
Of course, it may be expected the uninformed people would
not make the connection between anti-Semitismhere with

the anti—Semitism of the Nazis in Europe. But even those

people who should be informed, who should know better,
do not recognize the danger of anti-Semitism. Here is a
recent and illuminating example. ”

On February 1, 1943, Martin Dies made a speech on the
ﬂoor of the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.—
He said: “But there have come repeated demands that this
person or that person be branded as pro-Fascist or pro-Nazi
simply because he expressed anti-Jewish views. I do not
hold with those who condemn anyone on account’ of-the
misdeed of some people in that race, but there is no law
against a man's being anti-Semitic.” I - . ‘

In this speech, Mr. Dies also made it clearthat he be-
lieved the “war” against “bureaucracy" (the Roosevelt
Administration —S.V.) was “more important’? than the

military ﬁght against the fascist enemy. These two opinions‘

in one speech, defending anti—Semitism and defending the
enemy by making them less dangerous to our country than
the Roosevelt Administration, only strengthens the evidence
that anti—Semitism is the instrument ofithe Nazis.

CONGRESSMEN APPLAUD ANTI-SEMITISM

The above opinions are not surprising coming from an
open defender and pal of nearly all American fascists. How-
ever, these statements were so openly treasonous that Mr.
Dies modiﬁed them before they were placed in the Congres-
sional Record. The astounding point I want to make is
that Mr. Dies’ speech containing the original fascist declara-
tions was received by most of the representatives with a
standing ovation. .

How can we expect local officials to regard anti-Semitism
as treason, and to arrest ﬁfth columnists who peddle anti-
Jewish hate, when a Congressman asserts “there is no law
against a man's being anti-Semitic” and at the end of his
speech is greetedwith such a demonstration by the highest

‘legislative body in the land?

George Seldes reevals in his weekly publication, In Fact,
that Goebbels’ American counterpart, William Randolph
Hearst, thought so much of Dies’ speech, that he issued the
following signed order to all his editors, “. . . I am notifying
editors in this message to proceed on lines indicated,
namely; ‘We should begin with Dies’ speech, running sum-
mary in immediate news and the speech in full on the
editorial page, about one thousand words per day, as people
will not read more.’ ”

FROM BERLIN TO WASHINGTON

As I write these pages thirty-three Nazi propagandists are
awaiting trial in Washington. The logical prosecutor in
this case would be William Powers Maloney, who has gath-
ered most of the evidence against these conspirators and
has one of the best records in convicting ﬁfth columnists.
However, on the insistence and under threats of defeatist
Senators Wheeler, Nye, and others, Attorney General Fran-
cis Biddle kicked Maloney upstairs and assigned the prose-
cution to John O. Rogge.

This means an undeterminable delay, possibly as much
as one year, and a less effective prosecution. The desperation

22

 

 

 

of the defeatist Senators and Congressmen in connection
with this trial is easily understandable because practically
all of them have had associations with one or more of the
thirty-three indicted.

This one case shows clearly the tie-up of Nazi agents with
people in high places of the government, press and radio.
Who are some of the 33 people indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury, on charges of seditious conspiracy. Let us take
Robert Edward Edmondson, organizer of the Edmondson
Economic Service which claims to have distributed 5,000,000
pieces of literature with such titles as “How Key Jews
Rule the U.S.A.” and “Jews at the Bottom of All Our
Troubles.” His connections with the Nazis were deﬁnitely
established as far back as 1937 when the Nazi “World
Service” Conference meeting in Erfurt, Germany sent him a
letter signed by fascist representatives of 22 nations.

Their letter closed with the statement: “We are sending
you this letter to show you that we are thinking of you and
admire you for your tenacity and great moral courage in
ﬁghting this greatest of all ﬁghts against Jew domination of
all that we hold noble and sacred.”

Then there is George E. Deatherage who admitted to a
Congressional Committee his relations with the Nazi
“World Service” in Germany and boasted of his Presidency
of the American Nationalist Confederation and his post as
National Commander of the fascist Knights of the White
Camellia. The American Nationalist Confederation pub-
lished a News Bulletin which openly stated it was the oili-
cial organ of the Fascist Party in America. _ ,

Another example of the “characters” under indictment is
E. J. Garner, publisher of the fascist newspaper Publicity
of Wichita, Kansas, whose quote about the “Mongolian Jew

Controlled Roosevelt Dictatorship” was used on a previous '

page. Though under indictment, he distributes a leaﬂet
“How the New Deal Will End.” He writes he is being
persecuted by “Jews in the Department of Justice” because
he is “Jew wise,” and “fought Communism and found it tied
to the Jewish issue.” He adds, “If Jews do go daffy and
murder somebody who is opposing Communism . . . like is

being talked about these days, then pogroms will break out
in‘ this country of ours overnight.” '-

TG THE RESCUE OF FASCISTS

These and most of the others indicted are out on bail

and still issuing the same subversive material. It is the in-
dictment of these people that Representative Clare E. Hoff-
man of Michigan, called a New ‘Deal Plot. Hoffman then
sponsored a bill calling for an investigation of this action
by the Grand jury. Imagine! The newspaper PM’s serial
expose of this case reports that “Rep. Hamilton Fish, Jr.
(R., N .Y.) was permitting the use of his franking privilege
by some of the persons accused of sedition this Spring, to
mail -"out thousands of reprints of his speeches attacking the
forthcoming trials.”

In a speech to the Senate on January 14, 1943, Senator
Gerald Nye said most of the indicted were “no more guilty
’ and many patriots recognized a truth in this
statement. Isolationist Senator Burton K. Wheeler attacked
the Justice Department and called their action “one of the
most disgraceful proceedings ever carried on in this
country.” ‘

It was on such insistence that Attorney General Biddle
has held up the trial and allowed those indicted to continue
their destructive work during the most critical days in our
ﬁght against: Hitlerism.

‘- How can the FBI effectively smash the ﬁfth column when
its chief, Biddle, appeases American defeatists and delays
the prosecution of those enemies who have been arrested?

When Walter Winchell, well known commentator, wanted
to acquaint his radio audience with these facts, the Presi-
dent of the Blue Network, Mark Clark, censored all refer-
ences to this case. The Chicago Tribune front-paged this

sun-American censorship with the headline “Radio Forces

Winchell to Cease Smear."
THEY HAVE YTELDED TO HITLERISM

No wonder they get away with it. Even in this rather
sketchy picture-we can see a terrible reality. Here is a net-

.24

 



 

work of fascist conspirators working in scores of,orga"11i§2a-
tions throughout the country. They openly print and"'dis-
tribute anti-Semitic and anti-war propaganda. They slander
our Allies of the United Nations — especially England and
the Soviet Union. They encourage race hatred. They attack
every constructive piece of legislation, political, economic
or military, which helps the war effort. ' _ '
In this work they are" led, aided, abetted and defended
by powerful forces in all walks of " American life. These

forces, inﬂuential in government, industry, radio and press.

are either isolationists, defeatists, appeasers, Roosevelt-hat-'
ers, Jew-haters, Negro-haters,‘ labor-baiters, out and out
fascists or any and: all combinations of these. Their ideolo-
gies are so akin it is difficult to separate one from the other.

The important thing is they supplement each other and
objectively have the same result, weakening America’s war
effort by helping Hitler's ﬁfth column. . A ‘

As President Roosevelt said in his ﬁreside report to the
nation April 28, 1g42——“This great war eﬁort must be
carried through to its victorious conclusion by the indomit-
able will and determination of the people, as one great
whole. ‘

. .“It must not be impeded by a few bogus patriots who use

the sacred freedom of the press to echo the sentiments of
propagandists in Tokyo and Berlin. And, above all, it shall
not be imperilled by the handful of noisy traitors-— betray-
ers of Christianity itself—would—be dictators who in their
hearts and souls have yielded to Hitlerism and would have
this Republic do likewise.” V A V _ .
While anti-Semitism is part of the whole enemy campaign

-to undermine America’s victory drive and if must be fought

as part of the whole, it is also a. speciﬁc issue which needs
special attention. T l ' i

ﬁghting anti-semitism

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has always taken a posi-
tive position against anti-Semitism. Especially important
has been his action to wipe out discrimination against Jews,
Negroes and other minority groups in war industry. Other
prominent people of government and Church have spoken
out against the evil of Jew-hating.

Yet —— discrimination in industry still exists. Discrimina-
tion in the armed forces is rampant. The April 26, 1943
issue of In Fact revealed that 350,000 copies of a Bible had
been distributed to our armed forces containing a footnote
“Jews are the synagogue of Satan.” The First American
“joke” was recently printed in “The Blue-Jacket,” official
organ of the U.S. Naval Training School at Memphis,
Tenn. Anti-Semitism is being spread more widely than
ever. Clearly, speeches will not stop the foreign and home-
grown fascists from carrying on anti-Jewish propaganda.

A Federal law making anti-Semitism punishable by im-

prisonment as a crime against society would be expected
for ordinary times, in a democratic country like our own.
But right now, when national unity is our prime weapon
in the defense of our nation, such a law is a necessity.
__ ‘A At the time of this writing there are several bills in prep-
aration and some already before Congress which hack away
atone arm or another of the anti-Semitic octopus. Any bill
which even in a limited way obstructs this hate drive, de-
serves the support of all patriotic Americans, Jew and non-
jew. For instance, every Congressman should be urged to
support and pass the Dickstein Bill, H. J. Res. 49, and the
Lynch Bill H.R. 2328, prohibiting anti-Semitic material to
pass through the mails.

EDUCATION FOR VICTORY

The struggle to make the government and all its agencies
take action against all forms of anti-Semitism must be com-

26

 

 

bined with a broad, stream-lined educational campaign.
Under the leadership of the government, schools, churches,
trade unions, fraternals, movies, radio, press and all types
of organizations, could present such indisputable facts
about the Jews and the function of anti-Jewish propaganda,
that it would dispel the basis of anti-Semitism once and
for all.

The contributions of the Jews to the progress of science,
culture, philosophy, industry, agriculture, military achieve-
ments, etc., are second to none. History abounds with so
many advances the Jews have made to civilization, as to
disprove any attempted theories of exceptionalism. Such an
educational movement would not only teach the equality
of Jews and gentiles, but would result in destroying the
teachings of race superiority generally.

UNITY FOR vrcromr

Under existing conditions the initiative for achieving
such a two-fold program must come from organized Jewry.
It is aresponsibility and privilege that the leaders of Jew-
ish-American life must accept. It is their responsibility be-
cause they are the most logical leaders in this ﬁght. It is a
privilege because the destruction of anti-Semitism will be
an additional and particular contribution to our country’s
war effort.

It will take the full strength of a united American Jewry
to put such a program into effect. All the powerful Fifth
Column forces and their helpers will be put to work to
obstruct this program. In spite of all obstacles their re-
sponsible leaders must unite the ﬁve million American
Jews into one solid front; a visible, marching army, show-
ing to all America its heart and its brawn, its ﬁghters and
workers, its history and its perspectives, and yes, its de-
mands for the common good!

It is in this way that all Americans will unite with the
Jews on a basis of mutual understanding and respect. This
unity will be a great stimulus for a fuller, a11~around na-
tional unity so necessary for Victory.

27

   

This ﬁght against anti-Semitism and for inclusive na-
tional unity requires the full cooperation of especially the
leaders in all national group communities and in the trade
unions. It is anorganizational and patriotic duty of these
leaders to rally their people in this ﬁght against the Nazi
lies. which are being used to confuse them, break their
organization and ruin their country.

The Detroit anti-Negro attack and the other incidents

- mentioned in these pages are only a prelude to the out-

breaks which will occur if action is not taken at once.
When Congressman Vito Marcantonio found out about the

“5Blue-Jacket" case mentioned in this chapter, he com- V

plained to the Navy Department. After an exchange of
correspondence the Navy issued an oﬂicial directive barring
from service publications matter "that “will in any way
offend the sensibility of any racial or religious group.” Suc-
cesses like this can and must be won.

From the mass graves of occupied Europe, two million
massacred Jews cry: ‘,‘Nothing must stand in the way of
Victory.” This cry is echoed by the millions of other
slaughtered people—-“Hitlerism must be crushed.” Our
American boys—Jew and gentile—- ﬁghting and dying in
this holy war for civilization, expect nothing less than the
united support of their people at home. Who dares oppose
unity enters the camp of the enemy. We must not fail
our boys!

Foreword by

a Labor Leader

This pamphlet is a ﬁghting weapon in the war against
fascism. Our home front will be stronger for the publica-
tion oi "This Is Treason." The creeping poison of race
hatreds which is spreading within our country at the
moment must be halted. and halted quickly. It is essen-
tial that we understand that these hatreds are not spon-
taneous. but are nurtured as a part of the strategy of the
Axis tor the defeat of our democracy and of the United
Nations. "This Is Treason" makes that clear.

Here the real American speaks out. The labor moye-
ment. all minority groups within our nation. and the entire
American people owe a debt of gratitude to the Interna-
tional Workers Order for the publication of this pamphlet.

Do not hold on to it Make use of it. We will be made
stronger in our ﬁght against fascism by the message of
"This Is Treason."

Foreword by
a Congressional

Leader

 

The publication of this pamphlet is particularly oppor-
tune at the present time.

Under the fresh impulse of events which occurred in
the last few weeks in Detroit and other places. the re-
newed efforts of the Ku Klux Klan to make this country
conscious of its racial problems. causes all of the friends
of American tradition and fair play, to take notice of anti-
Semitism as a destructive force.

In our community it is absolutely correct to call anti-
Semitism contrary to everything this country holds dear.
and to everything in our type of government, and every
tradition of our constitution.

This pamphlet is vigorous. informative and teaches a
decisive lesson.

I am sure that the reader will ﬁnd in its pages plenty
of material to think about, and this pamphlet will encou-
rage him to do his share to eliminate from our public and
private life all traces of discrimination and racial in-
tolerance.

his is treason

DURING a recent visit to Chicago I attended a birthday
dinner. Charlie had just reached 35. Charlie produces war
material and is proud of this contribution to our country's
war effort. As the company relaxed after dinner, "Charlie

felt it was an appropriate time for a story so he began, “Do

you want to hear a good one?”

We all felt in the mood so he continued, “This morning
one of the salesmen came into my office and showed me a
leaﬂet entitled the ‘First American.’ Here’s how it read,
‘Who was the ﬁrst American to bomb a Japanese battleship?
Colin Kelly. Who was the ﬁrst American to detect a Ger-
man spy? John Cullen. Who was the ﬁrst American to bomb
Japan? jimmy Doolit-tle. Who was the ﬁrst American to get
four new tires? Abraham Cohen.’ ” L

Most of ‘the company laughed. The most violent form of
objection was a titter. I was shocked by the delivery of this
slander as a joke and more shocked by its reception. I pro-
tested, “This is no joke, Charlie, THIS IS TREASON.”

$300,000,000 —— FOR TREASON

Everyone appeared quite shaken by my statement, al-
though they knew I was not accusing them of being traitors.
But the fear that they, even unconsciously, were accepting
and repeating treasonous propaganda was not a pleasant
feeling. After a short discussion they agreed this leaﬂet was
a more dangerous piece of sabotage than the physical de-
struction of -bridges and factories.

As I left the gathering it occurred to me that here was a
representative American group. If they were unable to
recognize the vicious nature of this leaﬂet, wasn't it logical
to believe that many more Americans were swallowing this
bait, hook, line ‘and sinker? '

In his message to Congress January 6, 1942, President

1

  

Roosevelt warned against just such actions. He said:

“We must guard against divisions among ourselveséand
among all other United Nations. We must be particularly
vigilant against racial discrimination in any of its ugly

forms. Hitler will try again to breed mistrust and suspicion

between ‘one individual and another, one group and an-
other, one race and another, one government and another.
He will try to use the same technique of falsehood and
rumor mongering with which he divided France from Bri-
tain. He is trying this even now; but he will ﬁnd a unity, a
unity of will and purpose, against him, which will persevere
until the destruction of all his black designs upon the free-
dom and people of the world.”

Undoubtedly the American people welcomed this timely
warning. But unfortunately many of them are unaware of
what enemy propaganda is and complacently fail to connect
it with the dangerous effect it has on our war effort.

My experience at the dinner alarmed me sufficiently to
investigate the extent of Hitler's propaganda in America.
A partial investigation convinced me of its magnitude. The
Oﬂice of Facts and Figures’ booklet “Divide and Conquer”
states that the Nazis are “spending $300,000,000 each year
to organize Germans abroad, and to spread German propa-
ganda. Directing this subversive activity is the Auslands
Organization (-Germans abroad) of the Nazi party, with
headquarters in Berlin, 600 agencies in foreign countries,
and a membership of 4,000,000.”

ANTI-SEMITISM -- HITLER’S SPEARHEAD

,Too‘many people are complacent about enemy propa-
ganda because they cannot conceive its scope and virulence.
The individual does not see the vast propaganda machine
reaching millions of people. He does not see its widespread
and deep effects on the country as a whole. He only sees

-it in his immediate surrounding and as such it may not

appear too important.
Yet — propaganda is the main weapon that Hitler depends
on to defeat our country and world democracy. It stands to

- 2

 

 

reason that the Axis leaders realize «that their combined
strength in manpower, production capacities. and natural
resources cannot equal by a wide margin the combined
strength of the United Nations. Therefore, the -best chance
the fascist enemy has, is to split the unity of the democratic
nations and the unity of the people within each nation.

In utilizing this weapon, the Nazis use anti=Semi-tism as
one of their spearheads. Here is the way Hitler himself
directed his agents: ,

“Anti-Semitism propaganda in all countries is an almost
indispensable medium for the extension of our political
campaign. You will see how little time we shall need in
order to upset the ideas and the criteria of the whole world,
simply and purely by attacking Judaism.”

As recent as May 26, 1943, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency
reports how much hope -the Nazis place on this theory by
quoting the German Official News Agency release, “Only
history knows to what extent anti-Semitism among our ene-
mies can change matters in our favor.”

CHARLIE WILL KNOW BETTER

If the full signiﬁcance of these facts could be brought to
the attention of the people Hitler's last hope for victory
would be destroyed. The people need information to recog-
nize and counter attack every attempt to divide the people
against themselves. This booklet is a modest attempt to
help in that direction.

It would be impossible in these few pages to cover all

phases of Nazi propaganda, so the subject of this booklet.

will be the anti-Semitic spearhead of the fascist enemy. The
cracking of this wedge, will contribute to checking the
whole Axis propaganda machine. .
Let us discuss the “hows, whys and whats” of anti-Semi-
tism. Let this discussion arm us against Hitler's attacks on

the homefront. Let no American become Hitler's stoogefr.

because of ignorance about this urgent problem. Let us have

no more “First American” leaﬂets passed around by-

Charlies.
