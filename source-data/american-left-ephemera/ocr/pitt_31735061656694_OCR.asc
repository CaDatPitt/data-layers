out of the hands of any nation, and put intthe hands of the United Nations-—
and the United Nations always votes against us.” And they say, “We cannot
have our hands tied like that‘.” Now that is their angle, and we have got to
‘ take that into account. The mass, of the people have never_ discovered what the
is real position is from the Russian point of view. I think when the power to pro-
duce the energy is made free to every country, Russia will probably be willing
 to compromise, as she did over Berlin. I have every conﬁdence that Russia will.
7 But let us get around the table again, with all the facts known——and the ‘facts
not only known to the people up at the top—your people and" mine——-but the
facts made known to the common people of the land. That is the important
thing. _

When the common people know the truth in any country like yours or like
mine or in most other countries, the common people’s heart is nearly always
right. Our people just don’t know the facts, and you ought to know the facts.

 

 “The Marshall PIan——you ought to know the facts”

take one——the Marshall Plan. Why did all those countries say no to the Mars
shall Plan? I talked about it. I will tell you why they don’t like it. Some of
the elements of dislike I frankly confes_s I share.

I, personally, as an Englishman, never wanted to accept a penny of your
money. I (don’t like to go borrowing. I wanted us to tighten our belt as the
rest of Europe is doing. I thought my people could rise. to that———tighten our
belts. Trade with whom we liked, East or West. Trade with you; trade with
Russia, ‘equally. There are lots of things she wants that we can give, and we
want that she can give. I wanted that perfect freedom to build up ourselves

\ even if it is right from the bottom.

say, “In the ﬁrst place, it says you want to increase production. The Marshall
Plan says you must increase production. And it stops us from doing the very
things which, in our economy, we think essential to production. It says you
mustn’t nationalize, but you must increase production. You mustn’t make
reforms which we don’t like, but you must increase production. You mustn't
have- access to this-raw material or that, but you must increase production.”

To us, out of the twelve hundred millionsla year that we are having now
from the Marshall Plan, we are only allowed to spend thirty millions—thirty
millions only cut of twelve hundred millions—-in rebuilding our machines.

Furthermore, it says to us, “You must make yourselves independent of ex-
ternal help”, and it scales down all our investments in capital machinery which
would enable us to be independent.
I That is what they say in all Eastern Europe, and again they saypyou ought
 . to increase international trade, and yet it goes on to say you mustn’t trade with
if the East. There are a few things you may, but nothing that will be considered
til as war potential. What is not war potential. today? Everything is.

 Now, let us take quickly another item. I could take many more, but let’s

Now, why don’t they like it? They say it is full of contradictions. They J

And then again it says: You must not spend money on luxuries); you must
live austerely; you must tighten your belt. Then on the other hand, in the same
document, it says: You must buy our cigarettes and you must buy our codliver
pills.

Can’t you see it from the angle of Europe, especially Eastern Europe? It
is chuck-full of contradictions. It says again: You must stabilize your currency;
you must be orthodox over your currency. And yet at the same time, it does
not control that inﬂation which means that it is more and more and more dif-
ﬁcult for us’ in Europe to pay the debts that we owe you, and you see that is
one of the things that has to be taken into account. .

’If the common people here know ~ the kind of feeling that is growing in
Europe and has long grown in Eastern Europe, then we may come to some
terms about these things. ' '

“Russia has NOT expanded”

Now, there is another question————the question of “the expansion of Russia”——
“this terrible invasion of Russia into the world.” Don’t let us be hypnotized
by phrases. Russia has not expanded. Geographically Russia is less today than
she was in 1914, under the Czarist regime. Less. Less by Poland, less by Fin-
land‘. Russia has not expanded. There is no gun in advance of V._]. Day posi-
tion—and from country after country Russia has withdrawn her arms. And it is
your own Mr. Marshall who said that there is no evidence whatsoever that
Russia has sent a single gun to China. There is no expansion by Russia.

. “But what about expansion in the West?"

And yet, you know, when we talk about expansion, what about the expan-.

sion in the West? Well, you know, I was called to task at New York for having
said that  airplane bases are now in the possession of the United States, but
I ﬁnd I was incorrect because Mr. Struve Hensel, the Assistant Secretary for
the Navy, gives the sum more like 484-, divided between the Paciﬁc and the
Atlantic, and Mr. Reston, who I am told is another trusted authority, says

. that you now control twenty-six million square miles of ocean, right from, the

center of the Atlantic to the Philippines, right from Brazil to Panama, and
from Brazil to Greenland, and I don’t ﬁnd there is great eagerness to give up
a naval base when you have once got it—-at least,_ that is what they tell me in
Iceland, in Greenland, and in Panama.

So then, why not face the fact that Russia is not expanding? That would
remove one of the great objections and fears. “What about Eastern Europe,
though?” you say. “What about Russia's satellites?” It is so easy to use the
word satellites. You know, I suppose we are satellites of you. . . . Well, if I
have to be a satellite, you are a very nice people to be satellite to.

PAGE 11

 

I “What about Eastern Europe?”

Then you will say to me, “But what about Eastern Europe ?;” Well, I want
to talk to you a bit about Eastern Europe. I know it. I know it very well. I
have been in every country there, from Poland down to Yugo-Slavia——,every
country. Remember this with regard to those countries: It has been through
those countries of Eastern Europe that historically Russia has been invaded
through the centuries. Gustavus Adolphus, the Swede, Napoleon Bonaparte, the
Frenchman, Kaiser Wilhelm and Hitler, the Germans—our own country, and
eight other countries after World War One-all attacking through those coun-
tries, trying to smash the infant Soviet Union. Do you wonder that ‘they say,
“We must, in future, assure ourselves that. we have friendly governments in
those countries adjacent to us.” We in Britain dare cast no stone at them, for
that has been a cardinal element of our foreign policyifor four times as long as
I have been living. We have always determined that there would be no hostile
power in control of the Netherlands, the Lowlands, adjacent to us. We are so
vulnerable to them. And I think you have a Monroe Doctrine. So we cannot
complain of Russia’s asking for friendly governments.“ But that does not mean—
that does not mean that they are imposed governments. '

Now I would take the most crucial case of all, Czecho-Slovakia. I happen
to have had the opportunity, not only of visiting Czecho-Slovakia, directly after
the war, buttwice more since then. I was there only about six weeks ago; but I
also had the opportunity of talking for an hour and a quarter with their greatest
statesman, Benes. And Benes said to me, “We are Slavs. We love Russia. We
have been saved by Russia. It is to our interest to be closely knit to Russia, for

‘ trade and for other purposes. A primary plank in our program is friendship

with the Soviet Union.” He went on to add, “Not that we do not want friend-
ship with the West, We want it earnestly. We wantit with Britain. We want it
with the United States of America. We want friendship on both sides. Jan
Masaryk—I was with Jan Masaryk, on the night of Munich. Never can I forget
the agony of that ‘man, when his country was sold. And Jan Masaryk, before
he died, said, “Our people love Russia. Any policy that attempts to divide’ our
people from Russia is doomed to failure."’ I only mention this to show you that

because a government favorable to Russia is in power in Czecho-Slovakia, as in

any other country———that does not at all mean that it is an imposed government
upon the people.

“Our Iron Curtain”

I was told that there was going to be a very unfair election——in fact, no elec-
tion at all—so I was told, in Hungary. I had been invited to go to Hungary
by the women—a half million women of the Women’s Democratic Union. I
was invited to go and speak to them in their opera house, and see their work.
I made my application to go. Every obstruction was put in the way by my
Foreign Ofﬁce——and I might say, from some of the church authorities. “Don’t
go to Eastern Europe at all.” And if I did go, I wouldn’t have a penny to go with.

PAGE 12

 

I am not allowed to take a single penny with me if I go to any country in
Eastern Europe. That’s a part of the “iron curtain”. You know, I wasn’t al-
lowed to bring more than $3.75 per week here to your country. Not of my own
money. ' I had my pockets searched, as it were, before I was allowed to get on

the plane. At the utmost I was allowed to take only seven pounds, ten shillings. -

I‘ made application to the Bank of England. And I have not heard about it yet.
That’s the “iron curtain”. It’s got such a lovely velvet side, you know, when
it’s our iron curtain. —

. . . with full freedom”

Well, I went, in spite of it all. But then they said, with a ﬁnal despairing
word, “Dean, if you must go. to Yugo-Slavia and to Hungary——go to Yugo-
Slavia ﬁrst, and to Hungary afterwards.” Why? Oh, I knew.- There was that
election in Hungary that was going to be such a bogus election. So I decided
that I would go to Hungary ﬁrst to see the elections. And I traveled rapidly
through Hungary to see if people were allowed to speak, as they are in my
country. I went some 170 miles from Budapest, right out into the great indus-
trial town of Debreczen. Outside my window I heard a terriﬁc voice, and I
looked out, and on the balcony was a loud speaker and a political speaker, and
there was the square, full of people. It happened to be the Conservative speaker,
speaking will full freedom the whole afternoon. I got no rest, but I was very
interested to ﬁnd this complete freedom for a Conservative to speak, where and
when he liked. I went back to Budapest, and in the evening I heard the Peasant
Priest, head of the Peasant Party, speak in front of the great town _hall, with a
terriﬁc mass ‘meeting around him; and there were no restrictions whatsoever. I

- heard Rakosi, Communist Vice-Premier also speak, with no hindrance. And on

election day I went to polling booth after polling booth, and I found at each
one of them the ﬁve representatives of the ﬁve parties were there, ‘and nothing
could have been more regular than that election in Hungary. And not a ‘word
was said afterward by our press, “We were mistaken; it" was not a bogus elec-
tion.” I wonder if there wouldn’t have been some critical voices if I had not
been there to see. Now you see how important it is to get to know about these
other countries, and whether or" not their elections, which affect those who are
favorable to the Soviet Union, are really imposed, or are the choice of their
own people.

“ . . . an ‘invasion’ of Eastern Europe"

Now, I havegot to make a confession on behalf of Russia. There has been
an “invasion” of Eastern Europe_ from the East. And I want to remark on two
or three steps in that “invasion”. In Romania, there was one doctor to every
258 persons in rich Bucharest. And there was one doctor to every 15,000 persons
in the great country areas-—-people who never saw a doctor, and had no real
medical help. No wonder that in 1940, out of 500,000 infants born, only one-
third survived their infancy. Today, no man can take his degree as a doctor

PAGE 13

 

in Romania unless he has spent one year in the country, serving the people.
Mobile units are going out into the country everywhere. Now where did that
invasion come from? Well, I happened to see the origin of that invasion. In
Russia I asked to see, among other things—and I was never refused anything
that I asked—I asked to go north, south, east and west. I was allowed, and
facilitated to go——encouraged to go——among other things, I asked to see the
heads of their great medical service, the largest in the world——-and I saw Pro-

fessor Kolesnikov. And he gave me a lecture for three hours and a half. And I

took it all down. Thank heaven in the middle of it I was given sandwiches and
coffee. But what ‘a picture it’was! What they are trying to do with that great
organized medical service.

And then I was encouraged and facilitated‘ to go and investigate for my-
self, in any part of the country, to see how it was operating. The ﬁnest thing

M of all I saw there, perhaps, was that operation by Dr. Yudin, their great sur-

geon, who was made an Honorary,Member of our Royal College’ of Surgeons
in England because of his magniﬁcent contribution to surgical science. Through
his new art he can replace a diseased and useless aesophagus——-the tube from
the throat to the stomach——t_aking it out, then take a part of the intestine of
the patient, and fasten that in between the throat and stomach, and in three
weeks the patient is walking about, as you and I are walking about—resto.red
and healthy. I watched the operation for three hours. I ,think that I could
perform that operation myself.

Dr. Yudin took down from a case in his laboratory, a glass vial, and handed
it to me. He said, solemnly, “That is a cancer. Thatgrew in my mother’s body.
I removed it 13 years ago. It never recurred, and my mother died only seven
days ago. I removed it.” Then he looked up and said, “God helped me.” He is
a deeply religious man, Yudin is, highly favored by the Soviet Government for
his magniﬁcent services to surgery, given a great‘ new hospital.

“Tliat shabby little room—-a great Cathedral”

I saw another thing that struck me immensely in that medical service at the
bottom end. This was very beautiful to me. It was a rather shabby little room,
and the working women, going in and coming out of this room, were mothers.
They had lost their children, and they still had an abundant supply of mother’s
milk. And they were donating it. There is a great organization in Moscow
operating for this purpose, so that every baby in Moscow has.the chance of
having human milk in its earliest years. They have mobilized the mothers to
supply this milk. That shabby little room became to me like a great cathedral
in its splendor, when I saw it. That idea has invaded Romania. _

You see, they copy it. They copy that planned economy.

Now let us take another thing. I asked particularly, when I was in Russia,
that I might see the heads of the religious bodies. I was facilitated to see the
headsof all. I saw the head of the great orthodox church, the Greek orthodox
church, the great church of Russia, and on Victory Day he gave me this mag-

PAGE 14

 

niﬁcent jeweled cruciﬁx; and I went with him to a service, the biggest I have
ever been to in my life—no chairs—people standing shoulder to shoulder in the
packed cathedral—and ﬂowing far out into the street on all sides. I saw Dr.
Zhidkov, the head of the great Baptist Church1—there are perhaps three to four
million Baptists. He is a ﬁne old fellow who has been the head of this church
since before the Revolution. I heard him preach; I was there for two hours, an
immense crowd of worshipers, "standing in the aisles. I saw the head of the
Georgian Church. I saw the Patriarch the Archbishop of 'Leningrad—and be-
cause I heard they were going to elect a new Catholicus, head of the Armenian
Church—I asked if I might go. I was given a plane and I went 1500 miles to
spend two weeks with them—with the delegates from 15 countries of the world
--124 of them-—by whose suffrage alone could they elect their Catholicus. And
the Soviet Union paid their expenses in the Soviet Union, and their travel as
well. I was with them.

“We have civil liberty—we have religious liberty”

I saw Armenia through the eyes of the Armenians, who were accustomed
to the old Armenia. I saw their‘ astonishment when we attended one evening,
a magniﬁcent concert given by the children of Erivan. This concert would do
credit to any city in the world; not just jazz stuff, but real music. I listened for
four hours and a half, starting with two tiny children of six and eight, playingia
Beethoven duet. I was with them in that great, new, magniﬁcent theatre in
Erivan. I watched Othello, played as- magniﬁcently as in any English town. I
saw it through my own eyes, and their eyes as well. And I heard from them
what I had heard from all the others—from the Imam of Tashkent, where I
went right into the heartof Asia, and met the-Ahead of the great Moslem world.
I spent a whole day with him, and heard the same thing; and I met the head
of the Jewish cornmunity, and heard the same report from him. One and all
said—and they don’t lie-—— those great men don’t liPc'—“We are absolutely free to
worship.” ‘I Q‘

No hindrance-. We are all free and equal! NQ dominant -church ever has
allowed" equality before. The Imam of the Moslems said to me, “We have
today what we never-had before. We have civil liberty—-and we have religious
liberty.” But it was not only from the heads of the church I heard this, but I
learned it from the incidents I came across in the streets.

“THAT is an invasion”

I was coming out of a church in Erivan, which had been a Godless museum.
It is now a church !- I received the Sacrament there. Walking down the street

were children playing ball. Seeing a stranger coming, they parted to let us.

go through, and I could see them looking with curiosity at the blue crown on
the top of my cruciﬁx, which was tucked into my girdle, as usual. And‘ for their
curiosity, I pulled it out, and "the sun shone on the diamonds. And the children
gave a great gasp, and said, “Oh! How beautiful!” Then very solemnly and

PAGE 15

  

\

quietly the eldest boy stepped up, took the cruciﬁx in his hands gently, and
kissed the face of Jesus. And every child in the crowd did precisely the same.
And I thought this does not look like religious persecution. That idea of equal-
ity of religious bodies, and full freedom of religious worship, has invaded
Eastern _Europe!

There is no church dominating any other church. That is an “invasion”.

I’ll tell you of another invasion———the nationalities; there _are 11 of them in
Romania. The two dominant. ones are Hungarian and Romanian. Now, I
wanted to go to their great university town, the capital town of Transylvania;
and I went. They gave me a car. I went 1200 miles through Romania, and
spend one Sunday at Cluj, the great university town in Transylvania. Alter-
nately in history it had been in the hands‘ of Romania or Hungary. When in the
hands of, Romania, only the Romanian language might be used in the university;
when in the hands of Hungary, only the Hungarian language was used. And
there was perpetual clash and warfare between the two. But today that’s all
gone. There now is -complete religious and, political and national equality. All
the 11' nationalities are treated absolutely" equally. They do not let_ you call
them minorities. They are called nationalities. And today there are two uni-
versities in Cluj, and the Deans of both greeted me in that village: one for the
Hungarians, one for the Romanians. Side by side, they are working in com-
plete peace——-and there is a common hostel, one for the girls, another for the
boys, in which Romanian. girls and Hungarian girls live, side by side, learning to
love one another, and know one another. That is an “invasion”.

“ . . . the passion for work"

Now, another thing that has “invaded” is the passion for work, a passion for
reconstruction. Into the mind of youth has come the strong desire to, push for

the great goal to be aimed at; something to be achieved; something to which

they can bend all their energies. I watched them building railways that would
stagger you if you saw their accomplishments. I am an engineer. I was trained
as such. I was astonished at their 24 miles of railway, through granite rock——
33 tunnels, and great viaducts built—and done in- less than a 12th of the time
that the contractors formerly had contracted for. They built it themselves. And
I watched them in “the little town of Cluj——9000 of the citizens, out of 125,000
people—9000——young, old, doctors, lawyers, as well as charwomen and young
university students, and the like. They went out, and for 24 miles they dug a
deep trench, in which they put steel pipes which carried methane gas fromthe
deep wells about 5000 feet down——carries the methane gas right to the city of
Cluj, and now it is lit and heated with cost--free fuel and cost-free light—and
that job :has all been done voluntarily by the people, for their country, and
for their community. And that is an “invasion” from the Soviet Union.

Nc in conclusionlet me say this: People often say to me, “How can you,-
a Dean of old Canterbury, a religious man———how can you have anything good

PAGE 16

 

 

 

to say for such Godless people? How can you go to a wicked country like that?”
Well, I said, in the ﬁrst place, if they’re wicked, it’s the very place’that a Dean
ought to go,  he's true to his cloth. ‘

“There is ..fhe spirit of God operating”

Christ said that at the end of our life we have all got to appear before the
judgment seat. And I say to myself, and to Him, “By. what standard shall I be
judged?” Is it by my professed belief, my creed? No. Is is by my church
attendance? No. Is it whether I have said my prayers regularly or not? No.

We know what Christ thought about those things—that’s not the standard. '

What is the standard? Ah! Something much simpler than that—something that
a little child can understand—-something that only a great people can attempt
to fulﬁll. What was it? “I was hungry. What did you do about that? I was

‘naked. What did you do about that? I was sick. What did you do about that?

I was fettered and bound. What did you do about that?” Our attitude toward
our brother man——have we seen that everyone has food ad-equate, clothing ade-
quate, housing adequate, work adequate, health adequate, education adequate,
full security of life adequate? That is the standard by which we shall be judged.
And when I see any person, any group of persons, ‘any nation trying to do those
things—whatever the blunders may be—I say there, to that extent, is the spirit
of God operating. And they have my utmost support.

“We CAN live together . . . in peace”

I hope that the dark things will go away. I remember that the Parliament
that gave us the greatest liberties we enjoy today was the Parliament thatilcut
the head off its king. That was a terrible thing.‘ But the liberties were the
glorious things. And when I‘see those people there——perhaps having done many
terrible things (althought many have been exaggerated) when I see them stol-
idly, steadily, year in and year out, trying to do those simple things by which
we shall be judged-—~'th-en I say, for God’s sake, let us get together with them!
Let us put this fear of war to one side. Let us get around the table again. As
Stalin said, “We as Communists can live peacefully beside you, as capitalists.”

We fought together as allies in the war. We can live together in God’s world,
in peace. Let us get around the table once again. And you, the American peo-
ple, you, the richest people in the world, the most powerful people in the world
—have it as your chance—it is your opportunity——your golden opportunity———the
people of this land——I know your heart is sound and good—you, the people——
you can and I can, with myvpeople, join to make our people and our powers,
come again to the conference table, and say, “We are going to have no war.
We are going to have understanding. We are going to have peace.”

You can do it here. Let the -voice of your city and your country shout now
for the world, that you are on the path of peace!

Answers Questions

' Anti-S‘emitism' in the USSR?

Q. Is anti-Semitism growing in the Soviet Union, and is this evidenced by
the Soviet Union’s supposed disinterest in Biro-Baijan and the Soviet ‘Union’s
dealings with the Arab world? ‘

A. No. Far from it. There is now no need for Jews to go to a certain locality
of their own, because they are treated exactly. like anybody else wherever they

1 are; and they can have their farms in any place they choose. I mingled with the
‘Jews while I was there. One of the ablest young men I ever met in the Soviet

Union was a young Jew from Odessa. He and his mother were helped to escape
from Odessa. by the ‘Russians. People said, “That’s the kind of treatment the

‘ Jews get.” And I replied, “Yes, precisely-——because the Russians knew that the

ﬁrst persons to be attacked by the advancing Hitler host would be the Jews;
therefore, they said, the first persons to be removed to safety must be the Jews.”
And this young Jew and his mother were'both removed.

Slave labor in the USSR?
Q. Many reports have been circulated in the United States that there. are

more’ than 12,000,000 slave laborers in the Soviet Union. Will you please com-‘

ment on these reports. ‘ J

A. I know that in the books that are being published today about the
Soviet Union, there are these talks about the slave labor camps. I will take
one book only—that is by Koestler, in which he says there are 17,000,000 in
concentration slave labor camps in Siberia. Now I would ask you to do a tiny
bit of arithmetic, and then you will know how to deal with questionslike that.
Supposing that there were only two lines of railway between "Canada, and the
Argentine, in the far South; only two lines of railway, always ﬁlled with local
trafﬁc. Then I ask you how you are going to transport a population bigger than
the whole of Canada, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver—every part of

‘Canada, and about a quarter as much again, along those two lines of railway?

It would take the greater part of a century to do it. The whole thing is non-
sense! ‘It is an appalling exaggeration; it is ridiculous nonsense. I know that-
they think about those millions going from the Crimea. I wanted 'to ask Mrs.
Churchill, whom I know, and whom I met in Russia, how many they could
transport in a month from the Crimea with the railways in the state they are,
and were, when she was going through. You will see there that it is complete

nonsense. But you know there is a dangerous part to this whole thing. My

friend, Alexander Werth, one of the very bestreporters from Russia, who re-

ported for the Manchester Guardian very correctly for about seven years, has

 written two books on Russia, and he has just ﬁnished his third book. Admirable,

 factual, documents of the time. We went to his publisher. The publisher says,
“I can’t publish it now, but if you will write a book, Mr. Werth, called ‘Disillu-

V sioned,’ you will get 50,000 pounds for it.” That accounts for many of the books,
I think. ‘

Persecution of Communists in Wesfern Europe? ‘

A '  The Administration of the University of Washingtontis seeking to dismiss
six members of the faculty because of their present or past affiliation with the
Communist Party. Many people believe that a fundamental issue of academic
freedom is involved, and that the charges are part of the current anti-Soviet
war talk. My question, therefore, is, do the universities in ‘England and (or)

 Western Europe include on their faculties members of the Communist Party,
without discrimination and persecution? _
A. I happen to know that there arepﬁfty professors of history in England
who are members of the Communist Party. I have not heard of anything about
f ~~ . any of them having been dismissed.

The free press in the USA? . L

Q. Do you expect a fair review of your speech from the press here tonight?

A. I know that the press men will do their best. They don’t often, in my
country, get their best through, but I have yetdto ﬁnd press men who would not
like to get such a message through.

Land ownership in the USSR?
Q. Do the Russian people have access to the land, and may they own it?
A. They all own it.

Was World War It necessary?

Q. Was the Second World War necessary?

A. Now look here. I warned my people in England that‘the Soviet Union
3 at any rate was pretty strong. They didn’t believe it. Mr. Lindbergh came, and
he said the Russian airforce was negligible. He said that before Cabinet Min-'
isters——.and we were told .in our papers that Russian machinery—precision ma-
chinery——was tied up with string and wire. I had said on the ﬁfth day of the
war what the result would be, that the Russians would destroy Hitler because I
knew how strong Russia was. And no English paper would publish my letter.
It was published in the appendix to the second book I wrote—-and I‘wouldn’t
alter a line today. And General Montgomery came to me, and he said, “Dean,
how could you know they were so strong?” And he asked—he asked for a lesson

LATE in 1948, in the forty days from November 5 to
December I5, inithe midst/of a continuous war hysteria,
great audiences in tzventy-two ofsthe largest cities of the
United States and Canada came to hear Hewlett ]ohn_son,
Dean of Canterbury.

The Dean’s message———“We CAN Keep Peace” was received
with impressive enthusiasm——and reports of these great meet-
ings were almost uniformly ignored by the press.

Starting in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, thence f-rom coast to
coast of the United Stat.es—at Yale University,‘ New York’s
Madison Square Garden, Chicago’s Civic Opera House,
Atlanta’s St. Phillip’s Cathedral, Civic Auditoriums in Den-
ver, Seattle and San Francisco—and to thousands of listeners
in Los Angeles, Detroit, Boston; Cleveland, Minneapolis,

Madison, Winnipeg, Milwaukee, Ann Arbor, Vancouver and ‘

Philadelphia——the Dean of Canterbury brought his message
of facts and his proof that peace CAN triumph over the
forces of atom war. ‘

In every city, audiences urged that the Dean’s message be
made available to the people—'—so that the facts may be known,
so that we DO keep peace. The Dean’s great. San Francisco
audience, through the American Russian‘ Institute, has issued

“. . . if the people know the facts”

For seventeen years the American Russian Institute of San Fran-
cisco has given all its energies to providing the means of firm un-
derstanding between the people of our country -and the people of
the USSR. '

Thousands of educators, scientists, students, businessmen, writers
and professionals——as well as the general publ.ic—-have made use of

the /Institute’s facilities to get facts about Soviet life and culture..

Our Library, exhibits, motion pictures and musical programs, are

enriching the understanding of Americans who want to know what-

is going on in that vastland occupying one-sixth of the world.

The group of Americans who in 1932 founded the American. Rus-
sian Institute knew the value of facts as the basis of fruitful inter-
national relations———and peace. All of us, as patriotic Americans,
want our country to enjoy the benefits that come only with peace,
and with a peace outlook. ,

The Dean of Canterbury said again and again, in‘his San Fran-
cisco address, and in every one of the great cities of North America
where he spoke: “We can keep peace——if the people know the facts.”

Issuance of the Dean’s historic address is one large part of the
task of lighting up the dark corners of misinformation and apathy.
No human being today can afford the luxury of inactivity when
peace is at stake. , ‘

Your support will enable the Institute to better fulfill the demand,
and the need, for expanding its services for understanding and peace.

froduction

There are three reasons why I am here presiding at this gathering. The
rst is personal. It is my high regard for Dean Johnson.

 second reason for being here is my devcticn tc our American faith in '
freedom to speak and to hear. That faith is sadly lacking in some Americans
today. But it is our heritage. It is the.very lifeblood of our democracy. When
the State Department had first refused a visa to the Dean I accepted the invi-
tation from Professor Perry of Harvard to join the committee formed to press
forhis admission and then to welcome him. You have seen the names of the

committee, many of them very distinguished citizens. Like most, if not all of

them, I do not share Dean _]ohnson’s economic and social views. But having
joined that committee I am glad to represent it in accepting the invitation to
preside here. ' '

I do so the more gladly that I may thereby make clear my faith in that
freedom to speak and to hear which, as I have said, is our American heritage.
One of the most important implications of this freedom is that we must listen
patiently, not only to those with whom we agree,’ but to those with whom we
disagree. There is terrible danger to America if we shut our ears to_ the other
man.

The peace of the world today rests in the hands of Russia and the United
States more than in those of any_ other nations. The Cold war is a constant peril.
We do not want" a hot war, and I personally do not believe the Russians do.
War under modern conditions’ is defeat for the victor as well as for the van-
quished. War. with our new weapons_is merely mass suicide. Our only real
defense is to stop war altogether and to build through our peace system, the
United Nations, a law-governed world. ‘

We have to ‘develop theicommunity of nations, to put our chief emphasis
on the things which make for peace and not for war. '

In other words, whether we like it or not, we have got to learn to live on’ '

friendly terms with Russia just as individually we learn to get along with our
neighbors however little we may like them. And the only way we can learn
to live on friendly terms with Russia is to learn more about her, to try to
understand her better. To ask ourselves why her leaders feel so bitterly (or
seem to) about us, to understand what she is driving at, and" why she does it
the way she does. It is because I believe that our guest this evening can help
us towards that understanding-—it is that ﬁnally which brings me here tonight.

We 95;; Keep Peac

I am proud to be here tonight. When I wander through the streets of L0
don, there are three monuments which always ﬁll me with emotion. The ﬁrs

 

is that small, very beautiful bronze, opposite the National Gallery, of George

Washington. The second is that rugged, ﬁne ﬁgure, opposite the House of Com-
mons, Abraham Lincoln. The third is that new statue in Grosvenor Square,
of Franklin Roosevelt. I feel, as I stand here tonight, that something of their
great spirit is here, in this meeting. It has given me the chance of coming here
with a message which some of you may not altogether like, but it is that same
spirit of trusting the people, of wanting the people to have the opportunity to hear
everyrside, even if it may be only a little side, of what is happening in the world,
and then trusting them to form their own judgment as to how they shall act.

Nine years ago, one Sunday morning in August, in Canterbury Cathedral, as
the clock struck 11, a siren rang out, the ﬁrst siren of the war (and we were
to hear more than 3000 of them afterward). I bade the congregation to go
quietly to the shelters prepared. Then I went through the empty Cloisters to see
to my own home. The cloisters were not empty. In them were two little people,
a small girl of nine, and her baby brother in a small baby carriage. The child
was trembling from head to foot, struggling to get home with her brother, whom
she never would desert. I took her gently by the arm and said, “Come here,

child, to the shelter.” She cried in a so piteous voice, “No, no! I want my 0

mommy!” That cry echoed in my ears all through the subsequent years of war,
because I knew that there were millions and millions of children, uttering that
same piteous cry, and who would never again see their mommy or their daddy.

iThat is war!

I was the ﬁrst Englishman in that dreadful camp, Auschwitz, in Poland. I

saw those piteous piles-——shoes, spectacles, hair—piteous piles. Standing in"

front of a small pile of baby clothes, the Russian Major—a woman—took a
small garment and gave it to me, beckoning ‘me to keep it. I have it still. I
pictured what had happened. That baby, stripped of hericlothing, in the arms
of her mother, stripped of her clothing—side by side with a vast crowd of other
women, naked,,with naked babes in their a_rms—naked children clinging to
their limbs-———all pressed into a small building the size of a tennis court, jammed
tighter and tighter——'savage dogs driven against their naked ﬂesh. (I saw their
kennels.) They were driven tighter and tighter into the hall until it was ﬁlled to
capacity. Then the great iron doors slammed to, ‘and in the darkness, amidst
the screams and cries and prayers, the gas was turned on. Within 20 minutes
allewas quiet. Then the doors were opened, and with systematic brutality the
bodies were stripped of hair and gold teeth, the teeth forming an appalling pile

PAGE 5

 

which I myself saw. Then the bodies were taken to the incinerators. And in‘ one
day—I saw the dossier——in one day, 24,000 were gassed and burned. That  war!

Then, over Hiroshima, one summer day, out of the blue, there dropped a
single bomb—and_ not 24,000 lives _within 24 hours, but 80,000 to 100,000 lives
in one minute of time were taken, and a quarter of a million casualties. Four

I quare miles of buildingswere laid ﬂat. That is war!

“Who can think lightly of war?”

Who can think lightly of war? The next war has to take account of that
terrible weapon. The next war" will be atomic war. Now don’t let us make the
mistake that many made at ﬁrst, in thinking that the next war will be just a
press-button war. It will be no such thing. It will be a war which will demand
all the man power of the combatants. There is a book that you ought to read
in your country which is a valuable contribution to the whole question, by Pro-
fessor Maynard Blackett, a British atomic expert, whose name you will see‘ in
the list of Nobel prize winners this last‘ week. Professor Blackett has written a
book entitled, “The Military and Political Consequences of Atomic Energy”.
It is a careful analysis, as one would expect from a scientist, of the whole posi-
tion. He points out that very little actual damage was done to Germany’s mili-
tary output by tremendous bombing, and certainly it never crushed the spirit
of the German people. But if any future bombs were to be dropped, whole
ﬂeets of defenders would have to go with the fleets of bombers, and whole
ﬂeets of defenders in the attacked country would come out to meet them—
and not even then would the war be solved; because, as your own scientists
pointed out pertinently in the Franck Report, two countries are invulnerable
to atomic bombs: Russia and China. Now any future war would demand all
the man-power of your country, and mine; the women would have to- man the
machines and till the ﬁelds, as they did in Russia. And all the man-power would
have to ﬁght, because they would have to meet- a gigantic army of ﬁghters.

* I‘have spent 12 weeks in Eastern Europe quite recently. I know what the

I ﬁghters are there. I spent a day with Tito. I said to Tito, “I don’t suppose you

spend sleepless nights over the atomic bomb.” He smiled and said, “I remember;
an American woman journalist asking me the same thing. ‘Marshal, don’t you
know how terrible the bomb is?’ I said, ‘Yes, madam.” Then he learned toward
her and said,‘ “But we, too, have a secret weapon.” She said, ‘Marshal, what
is your secret weapon?’ He then answered, “The morale of our people! We
have built up, out of the peasantry, an army 300,000 strong. We have armed
them with the weapons we have taken from the Germans.” And he pinned
down a larger army than opposed General Montgomery at Alemein. '

That is only one country. There is Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, Romania; Bul-
garia, Yugo-Slavia. In any future war between East and West, there would
be armies of partisans, like those who are ﬁghting at this moment in Greece,
and in China. “There would be a hundred million to draw them from in Eastern
Europe, two hundred million in Russia——and you saw how they could ﬁght at

PAGE 6

 

. Stalingrad. If war should break out—which God forbid——there would be two

or three hundred million in China—six hundred million to draw from! Who
dares to contemplate a war like that? And who wants that war?

/“Who DOES want war?”

Friends, I have spoken to audiences all over your country, in Canada, an ,
in my country, before I came away—to great meetings like this——people who

are eager to ﬁnd a road to peace, people who believe that there is a possibilit

of peace, and.that it‘is preeminently desirable; You don’t want war. We

don’t want war. Who does -want war? \
Do they want war in Eastern Europe? Go as I have done, to Poland, and

i see what Poland is today. Talk to anybody in that country today and say,

“Do you want war?” They will look at you as though you were demented. War?
Look around at the devastation of war. All they want is peace, to rebuild;
peace, to make a home for their children; peace, that their country may live.
Then they will look at you and say, “But do you want war?” ‘ They will say,
“Why is Germany being rearmed?” When the explosion took place this summer
at Ludwigshaven, it sent a shock through the-peoples of Eastern Europe, and it
was a surprise to people in my own country. There was that great arsenal of
Hitler, working 90% of its old capacity; and in Eastern Europe they say, Why?

. Why arethey contemplating once again to raise up Germany to strike at us?”

That is the only talk of war you ever hear in Eastern Europe or in Russia.

Do they want war in Russia? I wish you could have been where I have been.
I have ﬂown thousands of miles through Russia, from end to end. One single
journey from Moscow to Prague took seven hours. We ﬂew low. I made notes
in my diary. They are monotonous. Hour after hour. Trench—tank—trench
——-shell hole—great shell hole_—shattered bridge——shattered village—ruined,town.
Do they want war? Some 1700 towns were wholly or partially destroyed. In
one of those towns alone—in Leningrad—there were a third more killed than
the whole of the British losses———Army, Navy, Air Force, and civilians, all put
together! In one town, out of 1700 towns! Do you think they want war?
Seventy thousand villages—two-thirds of the whole of their vast productive
machinery for the last ﬁve years gone. Six million people’s houses smashed, and
23,000,000 people homeless. Do they want war? Is there any reason why they

want war’? Have they any drive to war? Has their economy got within it some- _

thing which says, “I need a war, or unemployment?” No. Their planned econ-
omy can absorb anything that is made by the people, for the use of the people.

‘War today to them, instead of being an economic easement, and war prepara-

tion, instead of being an economic easement, is aidisaster, from ﬁrst to last.

“Peace niight break out”

I think that we in the Western world want to ask ourselves some serious
questions. I know there are some in my country who have a terrible fear that
peace might break out. Now what would happen tomorrow, in your country

PAGE 7

and mine, if peace———an assured peace, without any further threat. of war, were
to overtake us ?' What would happen? Well, I read in your _statistics that you.
consume only 71% of what you produce. At the end of the war youlwere consum-
ing 90%. Nowiit has dropped to 71%. How much of the gap has been ﬁlled
up by war equipment production? Ask yourselves seriously, because there are
these big questions which lie behind the other question; ask yourselves seriously,
what would happen if peace really were to break out?

“Russia has no drive toward war” . \.

Russia has no drive toward war of any kind whatsoever. Then why’ not let
us come to terms with Russia? “They’re so diﬂicult,”’I amjtold in my country,

and I think also in your country. “They’re so awkward! Everything that we ‘

propose, they say ‘No! no! no! no!’ ” Well, I know Vishinsky has a lot of No’s
in his vocabulary. But you remember what the first seven No’s were, do you
not? The ﬁrst seven No’s were against admitting Franco, an unrepentant Franco
Spain back again into the United Nations. ;

_ Now, if we are to have peace at all, we -must try. to understand the other
man’s point of view. So I want us to see some of these things from the angle of
the Russians.

Take ﬁrst the Berlin position. What is the Russian angle on this ?‘ Well, the 7

Russians say, “At Yalta and Potsdam, we agreed that we would be in Berlin
in order to create. a uniﬁed Germany, a demilitarized Germany, a denaziﬁed
Germany~——a democratic Germany. But———what _have you done? You have split
Germany in two; you have a new capital at Frankfort. You have not demili-
tarized. You have not denaziﬁed. You are putting back again, into their old
positions, Nazis, in charge of the great war machine of the Ruhr. You have
not democratized. You have rejected our eﬁorts to nationalize industry; you
have put a block on our desire for trades unions. Therefore, what logical right
have you in Berlin at all? Berlin is in our area. If it is not to be the base of
forming a new Germany, what right have ‘you got there?

. “They DID compromise”

Yet, in spite of their saying that they would never discuss anything except i

going back to Yalta and Potsdam——~yet in spite of that-—they went back. We
say that they do not compromise. They did compromise. They compromised so
far that they held a conference this summer, in Moscow, with the four heads
of the four big powers———and’ they came to an agreed solution of the problem of
Berlin. They came to an agreed solution which would break oil” the blockade‘,

and, while removing the blockade, would secure the Russian currency. The _

matter was passed over from the four civil heads in Moscow to the military
heads in Berlin to.make the technical.adjustments. Then our order came—
“Stop the whole thing. Berlin is a threat of war. Pass it over to the United
Nations.” Russia says she is anxious to go back again to the 20th of August,

1948, and our White Paper points out how much they compromised, and how ’

PAGE 8

 

much they were willing to compromise. Now they are ready to go back again
to that, and then behind that again to where they had yet reached no'plan of
the de-Naziﬁed, democratic, uniﬁed Germany. That’s the Russian angle, and
we have got to take account of that angle.

Now then, another matter—this atomic bomb. Vishinsky says “No,” to the
Baruch Report. Why does he say “No?” He says “No” to the Baruch Repor _  H
for this very simple reason, which is hard for some people in this country to V 

 

appreciate for its full worth.

“Russia is thinking of atomic ENERGY”

The Baruch Report deals with the ‘atom bomb. Russia is thinking primarily
of atomic energy. Russia is not so much interested in the bomb—-I should not
like to say that she has not got the bomb, or thegknowledge how to make the
bomb. I knew personally their great atomic expert, Professor Kapitza, who

was with Lord Rutherford in the earliest days of atomic energy explorations,‘

at‘ the laboratory in Cambridge. I know the quality of Prof. Kapitza, and of
those other atomic experts that surround him. But their interest is in atomic
energy. Why? Why’ are they more interested in energy than you in this country
are interested in energy? For this very simple reason: You are the richest
country in the world. You have the greatest horsepower per head of any
count.ry in the world. Yours stands at 100, while ours in Britain has dropped,
in comparison with yours, to 73%. Your wealth per head is 100%, in compari-
son with ours in Britain, which is 77%. Russia comes right down the scale. _She
has only 18% horsepower per head, in comparison with your 100%. , And she
has only 35% in comparison with your 100% of wealth per head. Now you see
why Russia is so interested in atomic energy. She says here is an opportunity to

A give us that energy per head which will raise the standard of the living of our

people, and that is their primary concern today. Professor Blackett, and most
of the atomic energy experts I know said, “If -only we have peace, and free
interchange oflscientists in all countries, we could arrive at atomic energy for
industrial purposes, for agricultural purposes, for medical purposes, with a frac-
tion of what has been used for bombing purposes.” And, my brothers and sis-
ters here, the vision before us is simply illimitable, if we can use this atomic
energy for all thosergreat purposes which we desire. ‘

Don’t let us damn this gift because of the use it is now being put to for de-
struction. It is one of the ﬁnest gifts that has ever been given to the world-

this access to new sources of power, to new sources of the investigation of the

human body and its diseases, to new sources of mastery of agriculture, and the
increase of food production‘ of our land.

“That is the Russian‘ angle”

Now to come back to the bomb again: That is the Russian angle. “The
Baruch Report,” they said, “would tie our hands. The Baruch Report would
say, the power to use this, to invent, to discover, to make atomic energy, is taken
