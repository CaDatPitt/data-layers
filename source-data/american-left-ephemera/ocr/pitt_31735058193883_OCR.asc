“MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY 0E THE LAW”

THE AGE OF ESCAPE

THE more confused and turbulent the world be-
comes the greater is the appeal of pseudo-solu-
tions to our problems. Like medicine men hawk-
ing their wares the various radical political par-
ties, church sects and philosophical schools pro-
claim their offers of salvation and each year more
people stumble into these byways to escape their
anxiety and to be reassured that everything is all
right.

The most attractive way of escape is the way
of authoritarianism. This is the way of the Catho-
lic Church, the Communist Party and all other
groups which demand unquestioning obedience to
established dogmas and infallible superiors. It is
no accident that Catholics and Communists un-
derstand each other so well and that so many
people have recently been shuttling back and
forth, “converted” ﬁrst to one and then to the
other. Thomas Merton, the young writer who be-
came a Catholic monk after flirting with the Com-
munists, in his recent autobiography praises “the
freedom of heart that one can only obtain by
putting his whole life in the hands of another,
with the blind faith that God wills to use our su-
periors, our directors as instruments for our
guidance.” This statement expresses perfectly
the authoritarian mentality, the desire to put
one’s whole life “in the hands of another”—be
it Church or Party. If we substitute the word
“history” for the word “God” in Merton’s state-
ment, what he says might have been said by a
faithful Communist.

Catholics and Communists

Catholics and Communists both believe in dog-
mas which are not open to question, which is
why it is almost impossible to discuss funda-
mental issues openly with either the one or the
other. The Communist may pride himself on be-
ing “scientiﬁc” but his science usually stops short
of the Word of Marx or Stalin as surely as the
Catholic’s stops short of the Bible or the Pope.
Those who have already found their haven in the
arms of Mother Church or Mother Party have to
that extent given up their search for new truth.

“Brave and Honest" -- So They
Send Him Back to Prison

Sander Katz, 24, an editor of Alter. ative,
was sentenced to one year and one dav in
Federal Penitentiary, November 19th, for
refusal to register for the draft. Katz had
already spent a month in jail on this charge
because he refused to accept bail. He had
pointed out that a man’s freedom should
not depend on the amount of money he can
commandeer.

The Judge was impressed by Katz’s loy-
alty to principle. Therefore he offered to
suspend sentence—-—if Katz would abandon
his principles by promising to stop his anti-
war activities.

When this failed, the Judge questioned
Katz’s mental stability. (After all, Judges
are not used to meeting—-either socially or
in legal circles—men who refuse to sell
their principles for worldly advancement.)

Katz was given ten days to wind up his
aﬂairs and to consider the Judge’s “oﬁer.”

The following notes were taken in the
courtroom, November 15, when Katz origi-
nally appeared for sentencing. While it was
not always possible to get exact quotations,
all the statements given below are essen-
tially accurate.

District Attorney: This man Katz is not a con-
scientious objector within reason of the law.

Judge Harold R. Medina: Well, a man doesn't
keep up violating the law and going to jail if
he’s just a draft dodger.

D.A.: The country needs an army despite this
so-called philosophy. A second offender should be
treated as a second offender.

Judge: A man may not come within the law,
but he still may have principles, isn’t that pos-
sible?

D.A.: Katz marked on his Selective Service

THE AGE OF ESCAPE
( Continued from page 1)

Such submission to authority easily passes into
fanaticism because difference are seen either as
a sign of inferiority or as a threat. The true
authoritarian knows of only one way of dealing
with differences of opinion and that. is, not to ac-
cept them, but to convert them to his own way
of thinking. A

Planned Sin

Along with the escape to authoritarianism is
the escape to pessimism or defeat which is being
canonized as “new theology” by the Protestants,
and which appears in another form in the long-
winded philosophy called ‘existentialism.” These
theologians are so obsessed by the idea of the
“sinfulness” of man that they use this as an ex-
cuse for lowering their sights so far that they do
not expect anything much from human beings any
more. Attempts to get at the roots of the issues
facing us they attack as “perfectionist” or “uto-
pian.” Writers like Reinhold Neibuhr, who claim
to be Christian, justify the use of the atom bomb
in the last war or the starving of the children of
Europe on the grounds that socially man is im-
moral and in order to be effective in a sinful
world we have to be immoral too. Time magazine
last spring summed up this gloomy brand of de-
featism with the slogan “Man’s history is not a
success story”—which is a dangerous and pessi-
mistic half truth. Neibuhr and his followers who
crowd the Protestant seminaries have the words
“sin” and “failure” so much on their lips that
they create a mood of despair which easily passes
into opportunism. And so we have the ignoble
spectacles‘ of parsons in mufti and doctors of
divinity haggling over political trickery in order
to be “effective.”

Defeat and Despair

With existentialism, which has been the fad in
Europe for some time and which is still the
catchword among our bright young intellectuals,
defeat and despair are tricked up in the fanciest
clothes and made to look actually appetizing. The
existentialist gloriﬁes the act ,of “decision,” but
his philosophy is completely empty because he
has no idea what to “decide.” Jean-Paul Sartre,
a French writer who has made a business out of
this philosophy, has left all others far behind in
showing how “lost” and “trapped” human beings
are. Sartre appears to believe that man because
of his very nature is defeated even before he
starts———the trouble is right in the roots of human
consciousness. Humanity and existence he re-
gards with disgust or nausea. The truth of the
matter is that the existentialist is obsessed with
only one thing———himself, his own “subjectivity”
and his own misery. His self-pity he has made

into a religion, but he has lost touch with the
world and with everyone else. The concreteness of
life for him is only “absurdity.”

Irresponsible Experts

The most widespread and still the most fash-
ionable of all the ways of escape is the simple
expedient of irrespon'sibility———particularly‘ if it
can be excused on the grounds of specialization.
This is the way out of professional men and sci-
entists who are too busy with their own researches
to care about what is going on in the world.
These men cannot be classed as callow intellec-
tuals or faddists. Often they know what the
trouble is but they say:‘ “That is not my ﬁeld;
leave it to the politicians or the reformers.” They
put on their professional blinders and go on pre-
paring their bacteria or writing their learned
lifeless treatises. The disease which this attitude
spreads is particularly virulent. It might be called
“expertitis”——the idea that everything should be
left to “experts” and we are not really responsi-
ble except for our own narrow little lives. Thus
the average man comes to think that “experts” in
politics and economics know best, forgetting that
we are all willy-nilly involved in a common plight
from which no one shall be spared. War, poverty
and depression are no respecters of persons". The
scientists who do not care how their researches
are used, the artists who claim “artistic immu-
nity” which is supposed to put them above the
common run, industrialists who are not interested
in labor or social security, and laborers who do
not think about long-range social objectives. are
all in the same boat. Such “specialization” is an
ugly pretension. Aldous Huxley’s picture of armies
marching to battle, each with their little scien-
tists on leashes like dogs, is a fair description of
the way most of our scientists and artists are
still behaving. It is not possible any longer to
respect science and art which forget their true
human bearings.

One Great Issue

The cults of authoritarianism, pessimism and
irresponsibility in the end are ways of avoiding
issues. Before the world comes to its senses
much that we have long held sacred will have
to be reappraised and perhaps dismissed. There
is no issue that can be sidestepped any more.
The one great issue is whether we are deter-
mined to live like human beings or not. If
to this question we answer yes then it is better
to make some small beginning on however minute
a scale. The truly human beginning of a solution
to our problems is to continue to distrust author-
ity, refuse to give way to pessimism, and to insist
on individual responsibility.

questionnaire that he was opposed to SS and war
because of political views. Violators of price con-
trol could have said that they disagreed with the
philosophy of the law because it interfered with
their economic interests.

Judge to the D.A.: Do you think he wants to
keep himself safe and let the other fellows do
the ﬁghting? If I thought so, I’d give twice as
much as he got last time.

D.A.: No, he’s not a coward, but he has a per-
verted state of thought. He is intellectually un-
stable and should be under mental observation.
However, the main thing in this case is the main-
tenance of the integrity of the law, the integrity
of the Selective Service system. An example
should be made of Katz.

Jail for Life

Judge: But we may have another draft call;
and if we do, Katz would have to spend the rest
of his life in jail.

D.A.: The armed services would never use Katz
anyway because of physical impairments and his
previous sentence.

D.A.: If Katz is probated he will continue to
violate the law as he continues to refuse to regis-
ter for the draft.

Judge: If I‘ probate, Katz might be on a picket
line, or speechmaking right after; and I won’t
permit him to do that.

D.A.: Certainly he’ll do that.

Judge: Do you think he’s crazy?

D.A.: No, but I doubt his intellectual stability
and suggest observation.

Arthur Garﬁeld Hays (lawyer for Katz): The
question that Katz requires mental examination
is more humiliating than the idea of a prison
term; it’s not his mentality we’re questioning, but
his principles. If he’s perverted, then I’m prob-
ably perverted too. I admire a person who says:
“Bring on everything, the police, courts, prison,
etc., but I want to maintain my individual and
moral integrity.”

Judge: I can’t alter the law; I have to take it
as it is.

Courts Fear Picket:

Hays: Katz is a brave man to have taken the
consequences of his convictions. He’s acting only
out of convictions, even though he is a bad physi-
cal case and could be deferred because of it.

Judge: If I let him free, will he picket, and
make speeches?

Hays: Katz’s voice will be louder in jail then

out free on the picket line. Jail won’t deter
others who have serious convictions; jail would
only serve to advertise the cause. If you free
Katz, he will do everything to carry out his prin-
ciples.

Judge (to Katz): If I suspend sentence and
put you on probation would you abide by condi-
tions of not picketing and making speeches?

Katz: I will do everything in my power to
stand against injustice; I will not abide by such
conditions. _

Hays: As an American citizen he is willing to
take the penalty, but the court should not impose
conditions which impair the freedom of expres-
sion guaranteed to American citizens.

“A Judge's life Is Not A Happy One”

Judge: I don’t want to put him in jail, but
maybe I’ll have to.

Hays: A judge should not impose sentence
based only on the legal circumstances, but he
should consider the question of the justice of the
law.

Judge: The law mayn’t appeal to me particu-
larly, but I have to administer the law. I can’t
change the law in court. _

Hays: A judge always draws moral distinctions
between criminals and those who have political
views. Jails are for criminals and not for honest
men.

Judge: If this were the first offense of this na-
ture I would sentence Katz all right, but what is
worrying me is putting Katz in jail a second
time, where it won’t do Katz or society any good.

Osmond K. Frankel (American Civil Liberties
Union lawyer): It seems a man can be kept in

prison for life for his thoughts under the DA’s
ideas, something which is done for no other
crime except for murder.

Judge: Why not have Katz psychoanalyzed?

Hays: I would agree to it since it is just an
inquiry. .

D.A.: The Katz case is not a cause celebre, but
just a plain violation of law; what is overlooked
is the whole method of inserting these so-called
principles.

Judge: But I am impressed by Katz’s consis-
tency to his principles.

D.A.: You might as well believe every anarchist
or seditionist. They believe what they do, too.
Punishment in this case may instill adherence
to the law in others.

Government Cheeses Victims

Hays: Roger Baldwin and John Haynes Holmes
are two persons I have great respect for. Baldwin
was in jail as a CO in World War I and opposed
World War II and felt that there should be a
segment of the populace opposed to war, which
segment would keep the light of paciﬁsm burn-
ing. Holmes opposed the draft but since he is a
prominent minister the government isn’t bother-
ing him but is prosecuting Katz for the same
thing.

Judge: I don’t feel clear what to do. I have no
right as a judge to let my personal views enter

the picture. Whether the law is right or wrong
is none of my business. As a judge, I have to con-
sider the man, society, family, etc., and then de-
cide what is best.

- Judge (to D.A.): If Katz does anything riotous
he’d be arrested for it. And about possible
speechmaking, maybe it’s just big talk on Katz’s
part.

Hays: Katz could be allowed out on his own
recognizance, or at least in my custody.

Judge: I won’t let him out, except on bail as
usual. And Katz can be psychoanalyzed if he
wants to.

Katz: I don’t want the court to force my par-
ents to pay for the treatment. If the court makes
treatment part of the sentence it should pay for
it and not ask my parents to do so. Or else the
court should ask whether I_can afford it.

Psychological Quickie

Hays: The process takes a long time, perhaps
several months. Can Katz be released for the
treatment? I thought such an arrangement was
in your mind when the question of treatment was
ﬁrst brought up. ‘

Judge: Heavens no! I thought analysis could
take place in prison within a short period of
time.

Judge: It would be awfully easy for me to im-
pose a long sentence but I can't do so under my
conscience until I think things over.
