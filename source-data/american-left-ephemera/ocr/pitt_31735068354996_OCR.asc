;Wifh Major Industry Producers

 

~ 1 - . r  DENVER—Mi‘ne-Mill negotiating teams moved into hard bargaining last month in a_drive
 _r to reach agreement with major non-ferrous metals producers and wrap up 1962 contracts 1n the

; gjindustry. Talks were in the brass-tacks stage with Kennecott Copper, the Anaconda Company,
‘T: _I-American Brass and U. S. Metals. Towards the end of June, the It-nion was on record as being

 
  
  

. each company.
Negotiations with Kenne-
 ”cott,>' began in May _,on a joint
 Utah‘ Unity Council basis, were

 contract package offer on the
2’ table. I
 I This package proposal, which
.- the company claimed was
worth 21.6 cents an hour, in-
, eluded: ‘a general wage in-
‘crease of-6 cents per.hour plus
/ ‘ one-quarter cent increments be-
 tween job grades effective July
,9 ‘ 1, 1962; general wage increases
, V of 6 cents plus one-‘eighth cent
pincrements effective July 1,
1963; increased, shift differen-
tials from the existing 5, 71/2
and 10 cents to 6, 9 and 12
' cents per hour; elimination of
the W remaining wage differen-

F-AT least three cents of the
7  company’s estimated cost of the
 _- package is based on Kenne-
;.?.1.-.-c0tt’s phony method of calculat-
  in'g_ its’offer’s value, a method
’  borrowed from ‘ settlements in
 t_he~steel industry which add

" ._.' Mine-Mill Kennecott Coordi-
 nator Verne Curtis, who is

‘ committee, said the company's

 much hot air that unless it is

 bralter or some other solid
 base, it would go into orbit.”

Cabinet officers, industry
and labor leaders.

The union’s views were de-
tailed in a statement on the

present lead-zinc crisis trans- J
mitted with a letter from Presi-

dent John Clark.

Clark’s letter called on the
White House, government agen-
cies and legislators to push for
adoption of an international
agreement to regulate interna-
tional trade in lead and zinc
and restore stability in produc-
tion, marketing and employ-
ment. s

It recommended th at the
United States, still the non-com-
munist world’s greatest lead-
zinc producer, and user of about
one-third of its consumption,
use this bargaining power to
a c h i e v e international agree-
ment. E

In reply to Clark’s letter, the
Department of State in Wash-
ington said it was deeply con-
cerned with the problems facing
the domestic lead and zinc in-
dustry and had under consider-
a t i o 11 an intergovernmental

_ agreement on lead and zinc.

It added that this was in line

with the Kennedy administra-I 1

tion policy to cooperate with
other governments in serious
c a s e-by-c a s e examination of
commodity market problems.
FOLLOWING th r o u gh ' on
Mine-Mi1l’s proposal, Washing-
ton legislative representative

Horace White and Research Di-
rector Arthur W. Stuart spent

. the week of June 18-22 in’Wash-

ington.

They conferred with State and
Interior department officials di-
rectly responsible for formula-
tion of lead-zinc industry pro-
grams, who also served on the
United States delegation to the

United Nations Lead-Zinc Study '

Group in ‘Geneva, Switzerland
last May. A

They were informed that the
government desired further con-
sultation with Mine-Mill prior
to the next U.N. lead-zinc ses-
sion, tentatively scheduled for
next fall, and were asked for
further recommendations as to
the detailed working out of the
agreement under consideration.

DESPITE the log jam of leg-

Congress Now Eyes

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)
WASHINGTON, D. C.—-Con-
gress, getting nowhere fast,
faces a long summer session,
with Labor Day now emerging
as the nearest thing to a wind-
up date.. Original plans of con-
gressional leaders called for a
mid-July adjournment so the
lawmakers could return home

for the electioneering wars.

Piddling legislative results
after six months of.1abors com-
pelled a drastic change in the
timetable. The general scheme

. of things. now calls for a speed-
up all down the line, final ac-
tion on several administrative
“masts,” and enough progress
on others to project them as is-
sues,_.into the election campaign.

A Scripps-Howard .p o l i ti c a l
analyst saw President. Ken-
nedy's New Frontier legislation
“in deep trouble’? as “Congress
.dawdles under soft Democratic
leadership.”

‘ its 10

- ALL. hands on Capitol Hill,
f r o In lobbyists to lawmakers,

agree that this session thus far
shapes up as one of theworst
in years. The congressional box-
score-toward the end of June
showed only two major bills
passed and signed into law: the
manpower retraining bill and
the pension plans ‘disclosure
bill.

More than anything, the ses-
sion resembled a picture in slow
motion with Congress meander-
ing along, _on _the whole seem-

9 ing to lack a sense, of direction

or a get-up-and-go spirit. Opin-
ion polls showed increased
popularity for President Ken-
nedy, but it wasn't showing up
in legislative results.

T y p i c a 1 of congressional
wrangling was the “octogenar-
ians” deadlock, which, going
‘into the-last week of June, had
blocked all appropriations bills.
Involved was a dispute over con-
ference’ procedures between the
84-year-old head of the Senate

Appropriations committee, Carl
Hayden (D., Ariz.), and his 83- '

Labor Day Closing

year-old H o u s e counterpart,
Clarence Cannon (D., Mo.). »
Appropriations were to be
ready to meet the new fiscal
year starting. July 1, but the
beef over who should preside
over joint meetings to work out
money bill compromises had
everything tied up, including
pay for some 10,000 government
agency employees whose dilem-
ma was somewhat brightened by
emergency stop-gap measures
being rushedjthrough the Sen-
ate and House.

>.‘ >3 3!‘

A MAJOR Administration
measure—the farm bil1—which
passed the Senate 42 to 38, suf-
fered bitter ‘defeat in the House
June 21 where it was rejected
215 to 205. The New York
Times termed this turn of
events a “debacle” and.said it
“pointed up the Administra-
tion’s troubles in Congress.”

A compromise extension of

existing emergency farm legis-

lation was rushed to._.the House

in an effort to salvage at least
part of the Kennedy farm pro-
gram.

Democratic leaders made it
clear they intend to make the
nearly solid Republican oppo-

sition to the bill an issue in the-

congressional e l e c t i o n cam

Local 521 Ratities
Contract Gains

A special membership’ meet-
ing of Carteret, N. J., Local 521
on May 31 voted ratification of ‘a
new two-year agreement with
Metal & Thermit Corporation

calling for substantial wage and
fringe benefit increases.

Effective June 1, 1962, were:
a graduated general wage in-
crease of 7, 8- and 9 cents per
hour; four weeks’ vacation for
25 years of service; optional re-
tirement at age 62, and company
agreement to pick up the in-
crease in the cost of Blue Cross
and Blue Shield plans (this cost
was increased by 19 percent,
absorbed by the company).

An additional graduated gen-
eral wage increase of 7, 8 and 9
cents per hour goes into effect
July 1, 1963, along with an in-
crease in pension benefits to
$2.50 a month plus pension vest-
ing rights.

The union,--was also able to
raise the rates on several classi-
fications. '

Normally the initial wage
boosts would be scheduled to go
into effect July 1, 1962, expira-
t.ion date of the old contract. The
new increases, however, were
made applicable a month ear-
lier, effective as of the date of
signing June 1. Int’l Rep. Angelo
DeStafano assisted the Local
521 committee in negotiations.

Elesco Smelting
Signs Agreement
The Elesco Smelting unit of
Chicago Amalgamated Local 758
signed a new two-year agree-
ment with the company last
month. .
Provided in the settlement is
an 8-cent per hour general wage
increase each ‘year plus, an ad-
ditional 5-cent inequity increase
for 13 men. An improved vaca-
tion plan calls for three weeks’
vacation for 10 years, with a
staggered vacation after 15
years—one day for each year of

 

    

service up to four weeks for 20
years.

Members of the negotiating
committee were Shop Chairman
John Sheffield, Secretary Willie
Lewis and Judge Coates. They
were assisted by Local 758 Busi-
ness Manager James Pinta.

Kellogg Local Has
Miners Day Picnic

Coeur d’Alene District Union
Local 18 celebrated its Miners
Union Day again this year on
June 9 with a picnic for mem-
bers’ families at beautiful Potts-
ville Park in Idaho’s Bitterroot
Mountains.

This annual celebration of the
Kellogg local commemorates the
early-days victory over the com-
panies and the organization of
the union in the Coeur d’Alene
mining district. The event each
year has been a tradition with
the union. '

Music, games, prizes and lots
of food to eat at the picnic
marked the occasion this year.

There were also commemora-
tive services in the morning at
the Miners Union Cemetery near
Wallace. Services were con-
ducted by Rev. “Chief” J. (Hap)
Mallot. Reverend Mallott works
as a miner at the Bunker Hill
Company.

Lee Attends State

Demo Convention

Business Agent William E. Lee
of Tacoma AS&R Local 25 was
an elected delegate to Washing-
ton State Democratic party con-
vention last month.

After attending the meeting
in Bellingham June 22 and 23,
he was scheduled to report to
the local on the coming political
campaign in the state where the
final filing date for candidates
is July 13, primary registration
deadline is Aug. 10 and the pri-
mary election itself is Sept. 11.

Allen's Sons Visit
Denver Hdqtrs.

A surprise visitiby a couple
of young men to the Interna-
tional Union office last month
stirred up memories of one of
Mine-Mill’s pioneer staff mem-
bers, Frank Allen, who died in
1957. *

The visitors were Frank’s two
sons, Bernard and Willie, during
a Denver stopover June 12 in
their vacation trip to California
from Detroit. Both the younger
Allens, union men like their fa-
ther, are members of the United
Auto Workers at the Lincoln-
Thunderbird plant of Ford Mo-.
tor Company in Wixon, Michi-
gan, near Detroit.

Frank Allen was 71 years old

Key sun Manuel Dispute Issue Settled

SAN MANUEL, Ariz.—Rank
and file members from all mine,
mill and smelter divisions of
San Manuel Copper Company
rallied unitedly behind Local
937 here to gain settlement June
"'8 of a key issue involving man-
agement’s recognition of and
adherence to each step of the
-grievance procedure.

The dispute came to a head
in the smelter when the com-
pany supervisor issued a 10-day
disciplinary layoff to grievance-
man Charles Burchfield after
refusing to discuss a grievance
which Burchfield had attempted
to present. The c o m p a n y
charged Burchfield with using
abusive language, but the union
has witnesses and evidence to
prove otherwise.

L o c a 1 leaders, maintaining
that the crux of the matter was
the company’s refusal to recog-
nize the grievanceman, imme-
diately called a meeting with
top management with m a n y
rank and file members standing
in and around the company of-
fice .as the session was held.

=l< ti! *

THE union insisted that
Burchfield’s 10-day layoff be
rescinded and that management
not only correct the situation of
supervisors f a i 1 i n g to give

proper recognition to stewards I

but also that grievances should
be handled as they occur with

efforts made to resolve them in

all steps of the grievance pro-
cedure.
Many employees laid off work

as a protest to the company ac-
tion and in support of the un-
ion’s fight. Special local meet-
ings were ‘held as negotiations
on the matter continued with
the company until a written
agreement was signed to take

care of the future processing of, L

grievances.

The company also reduced
Burchfield’s layoff to three
days, but the union is taking
the case to arbitration to re-
scind the layoff altogether.

‘it its $16

MEANWHILE, the n e W l y
signed agreement on grievance
processing has already shown
results in better understanding
and relations between stewards
and supervisory personnel. The
L0 c al 937 executive -b o a r d

, .

headed by President Fred San-
chez and leaders in the smelter
such as Rudy Hogg, Walter
Trabu and William Bickel are
actively handling the situation
for the union on the job.

Int’l Rep. Charles Wilson and
Regional Director Frank Vet-
torel assisted the local in resolv-
ing the issue. Local leaders who
played influential parts in rally-
ing the unity of the membership
in their divisions were Fred
Van Hoose in the mine, griev-
ancemen Leroy Houser and
George Chacon, Vice-Presidents
George Benitez and Abe Yanez,
smelter grievancemen Charles
Hubbard and C. Fairbee, rail-
road grievanceman G. Barraza,
and mill grievanceman Joe
Webber.

Cotinuing its weekly meet-
gs the committee‘ has ar-
"ed r for distribution of 100
st] sand thousands of circu-

lars throughout the county urg-
ing voters to register. This is
part of its program to increase
the political awareness of the
people.

A request for the County Dem-
ocratic organization ‘to appoint
deputy registrars resulted in the
naming of two committee
choices, one of Whom is Thomas
Aguilar, a Local 616 member.
The committee also approached
the County Republican chairman
for the appointment of regis-
trars, and was received with
cordial interest in the commit-
tee’s purpose. _,

The joint labor political action

group was formed in May. In

addition to the drive for voter
registration, its program calls
for publicizing qualifications of
candidates and getting out the
vote on election day.

ﬂack Pay Grievance Awards

AIJBISBEE, Ariz.—Back pay in varying amounts up to $580 was won for several
"Eby Copper Queen Miners Union Local 551 in two arbitration Victories at the
ps Dodge mining property here.

Decisions and awards on the cases, heard last Jan. 4 and 5, were handed down by
trator George H. Hildebrand of Ithaca,  Y., on May 15 and 16. The cases were

cards in the fall of 1961 for the
Cole shaft.

The difference in rate between _

what the company I paid and
what was awarded amounted to
$1.36 a shift up to Jan. 12 and,
after that date, it became $1.40
a shift.

Local 551 members Paul Ren-
ner and Edmund Ruiz were the
main beneficiaries of the back
pay, although there are other
men who worked on the job for
short periods who will also bene-
fit. Renner’s back pay of about
$580 was the top amount.

pany had promoted a helper on

Tacoma Arbitration 

Nets $7,565 Pay Gain

TACOMA, Wash.—A major grievance victory was
won by Tacoma Sme-ltermen’s Union Local 25 at the
AS&R plant here recently in an arbitration decision re-
sulting in total back pay of more than $7,500 for 56 em-

ployees.

The issue involved in the
year-old grievance on which
Arbitrator Thomas H. Tongue of
Portland, Ore., ruled in favor of
the union concerned a seniority
provision in the Mine-Mill Local
25 agreement covering recalls
from the lay-off list. ,

Specifically disputed by the

union was the Tacoma AS&R'

smelter management’s action
May 18, 1961, of by-passing 199
employees to recall two men
from the layoff list.

>l= >2: *1:

THE company contended, over
the union’s objection, that these
two employees, recalled were
the only men qualified to handle
the two jobs that were vacant.
The jobs, while perhaps not de-
sirable, required no great skill
or training. -

In his decision and award,
Arbitrator Tongue ruled that the
company was not entitled to
ASSUME that all.199 employees‘

— were not qualified without dem-
onstrated proof which the com- '1
pany, not the union, had‘ the.

  

1961, and March 19, 1962, are
entitled to co*mpensation.

INCLUDED in such compen--
sation ordered by the arbitrator
were full pay plus 10 cents per
hour shift differential and vaca-
tion pay for any individual em-
ploye who did not receive a va-
cation in 1961 by reason of not
being employed for one day in
the year 1961.

Under the computation made

.since the award, 56 employees

will receive a total of $7,565.87
in back pay. The range of indi-

vidual payments runs from, $25

to $1,282.18.

Representing the union in the
case were: Local 25 Business
Agent William E. Lee, Presi-
dent Joe Gilligan and Grievance
Committee members Paul Sovey,
Ray Wedrosky, Walt Fagan,
Earl Hendrickson and Howard
Elliott. They were assisted by
Attorney John Caughlan in the
arbitration hearing held March
15. .

V Vice-President:

Labor’s Goals Linked  
With Fight for Ballot

ANY Congressmen and Senators seem to be more

interested in setting up November election cam-
paign issues than transforming these issues into law in
the present session before they go home. What labor
may well ask these lawmakers is: Why this pre-occupa-
tion with electioneering in 1962 when there’s
so much left undelivered on campaign prom-
ises made two years ago?

What has happened to meaningful civil
rights legislation, to medical care for the aged
under social security, to federal aid for educa-
tion, to a break for the people on taxes, pub-
lic works and all the other social issues on
which the promise of the “new frontier” was
based?

We hear, of course, that President Ken-
nedy is trying, and we don’t doubt his sin-
cerity or good intentions. He’s balked by
roadblocks,’ it’s pointed out—the coalition of
Southern Democrats and reactionary Republicans, obstacles to

 

Howard

progress like the House Rules Committee and the Senate filibuster. i

‘***

ABOR has a basic stake in this, and I believe the brightest

hope for labor’s legislative goals must be linked with those
of the Negro people in a successful fight for civil rights, especially
the right to vote. It’s a necessity for white and Negro workers to
fight.together, especially in the South, for their mutual economic
and political advancement. This would go a long way toward over-
coming the congressional “roadblocks” to the social legislation we
keep talking about.

Yes, the right to vote is key. This issue was recognized in
an article I once clipped from the magazine U. S. News & World
“In this situation, old-line Southern
politicians are fighting with their backs to the wall. If white and
Negro workers in the South manage to work..together.,and getgtoj
the polls, they can send a new kind of Southerner to Washington.
He would speak for the poorest people in the nation and might
make the New York and Chicago New Dealers look like pikers.”

That was printed five years ago, and the Negro’s battle for
the ballot continues hotter than ever despite all the resistance and
connivance against it in such Southern states as my own, Alabama,
as well as others.

***k

N 1944 the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a

decision (Smith vs. Allwright) removing the last vestige of
constitutional sanction for the so-called “White Primary” which
had been used so effectively to prevent Southern Negroes from
voting in any significant numbers.

The Court’s majority opinion, written by Justice Reed, said
that “the right to vote in a primary for the nomination of candi-
dates without discrimination by states, like the right to vote in a
general election, is a right secured by the Constitution . . . that
right may not be abridged by any state on account of race . . . the
great privilege of the ballot may not be denied a man by the state
because of his color.”

Since that decision, the Democratic party emblem in Alabama
is a game rooster, and above that emblem is the state party’s
motto: “White Supremacy.” Democrats North, East and West
should protest that shameful motto.

Nevertheless, in spite of the motto, the Negro still voted the
Democratic ticket because, under Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Dem-
ocratic_party was identified as “the meat and bread party” by
many Negroes.

ikilrir

HE Negro’s fight for political status in the South is progress-

ing, no matter what stands in the way. In Alabama just a
couple of months ago, when candidates were qualifying for the May
primary, ten Negroes paid their qualifying fee to run for the
Democratic Executive Committee of Jefferson County, which in-
cludes precincts in the Bessemer-Birmingham area.

They were denied, not because they were not qualified. The
reason given was that the 144-man Committee believed in “White
Supremacy” and the ten didn’t. The 10 Negroes took their case
to the federal court and were permitted to qualify.

Ten ran, and six were elected. As a result, for the first time
in history, we now have six Negroes on the Jefferson County Dem-
ocratic Executive Committee. These six were elected by the peo-
ple to serve fairly all the citizens. ‘

. However, in a number of other counties in Alabama, not a
single Negro has been permitted to register and vote.

d*~k*

N his state-of-the-union message on Jan. 7, 1960, former Presi-
dent Eisenhower declared that in all history “the right to vote
has been one of the strongest pillars of a free society,” and that
“our first duty is to protect this right against all encroachments.”
President Kennedy has uttered just as forthright sentiments in
his administration’s declared program for civil rights legislation.
Yet, in the year of our Lord 1962 in America, hundreds of
thousands of Negroes in the South. are still denied the right to vote.
This fact, more than anything else, points up the significance

of the drive being ledby Dr.,l\/Iartin Luther King Jr. and Rev.
Ralph D. Abernathy for massive voter ;,registratioi1,of Negroes
acrossthe South. Success of such a drive, can change the ,south”_s

signed by the leadership to
single out “must’ bills.

Top rating, in order, has been
assigned to: the trade bill, cur-
rently scheduled for House ac-
tion; the tax reform bill, which
has been in serious trouble be-
fore the Senate Finance Com-
mittee; medical care for the
aged through social security,
tied up in the House Ways and
Means Committee and under
all-out attack from the Ameri-
can Medical Association; an

gram; aid to higher education;
the extension of Temporary Un-

TAX reduction is a new ele-
ment suddenly projected into
the limelight, butthere doesn’t
appear to be much meat and
potatoes here for the working
people. So far, two steps are in
the offing.

The first includes.the invest-
ment credit proposal in the
pending tax reform bill and lib-
eralization of Treasury rules af-
fecting depreciation; these two
total some 21/2 billions in sav-
ings for corporations.

Promised for next year is

the second step: a further re-
duction in corporation taxes and

-a..slash in individual income tax‘
rates, with most of the latter

going to the upper income
brackets. -For the ordinary
people, those at the lower in-
come levels, the trickle -down
theory still seems operational.

Miners Union Day Celebrates
Buffe Local's 84th Birthday

BUTTE, Mont.—Butte Miners Union No. 1 observed its 84th anniversary here
June. 13 with the entire city joining in the annual celebration of Miners Union Day at

Columbia Gardens.

An estimated 5,000 men, women and children thronged Butte’s popular recreation

center to participate in the traditional holiday marking the founding of the Mine-Mill

union. The spacious gallery
of the dance pavilion was
filled during the annual first
aid contest sponsored by the

Anaconda Company.

¥l<$*

SEVENTEEN teams engaged in
the first aid contest which was
the most competitive in the 44-
year-old history of the event,
a feature of Miners Union Day
for that many years.

First place and a $300 prize
was won by the Mountain Con
“A” team with a score of 1,994
out of a possible 2,000 points.
Second place and $180 went to
the Kelley “A” Miners team
with 1,992 points. Steward Min-
ers and High Ore Pumpmen tied
for third and fourth place with
scores of 1,983 points each and
each team receiving $120.

Prize money totaled $738, giv-
en by the Anaconda Company.

GI Home Defaults
Hit Record High

WASHINGTON, D. C. -— Ac-
cording to the Veterans Admin-
istration, continuing unemploy-
ment is causing a record high
in the number of foreclosures
on G1 home loans.

The VA estimates that it will
have to make good. on some
18,000 defaulted home loans dur-
ing the fiscal ‘year 1962, ending
on June 30. The national situa-
tion is so serious that the VA
has asked Congress for more
funds with which to carry the
unexpected load of defaults.

While the number of foreclos-
ures is relatively low compared
to the total home loans guaran-
teed by the VA, there is great
concern over the increase shown
particularly in areas hard ' hit
by unemployment.

THE MINE-MILL UNION ,

July. ii1i9aJ2,t ,_-

More Unions Voice Stand in
Support of Mine-Mill Fight

Four major AFL-CIO unions have taken official stands in recent months declar-
ing support of Mine-Mill’s fight against legal harassment in the courts and before the
Subversive Activities Control Board.

Latest of these actions was in the form of a civil ‘liberties resolution proposed by
the United Packinghouse Workers of America executive board and approved by the

UPWA convention May 25
in Minneapolis.

The UPWA resolution en-
dorsed a s i mi 1 a r statement
adopted earlier in the month by
the 18th constitutional conven-
tion of the United Auto Work-

.. ers, largest international union

in the AFL-CIO. ‘

“We join the United Automo-
bile Workers- and other unions
in opposing the governmental
harassment of the International
Union of Mine, Mill and Smelt-
er Workers,” the UPWA con-

. vention resolution’ declared.

“No section of the labor

movement can approve govern-

ment suppression of a union,”
it added, “and labor must par-

1 ticularly disapprove the use for

this purpose of the conspiracy
doctrine which has historically
been the legal weapon of the
anti-labor forces.”

*’ * 2%

A THE Auto Workers conven-

tion resolution, also basing its

stand in defense of labor’s civil
liberties, said: "

‘‘We 0 p p o s e governmental
harassment of the International
Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers . . . the civil liberties
of that Union must be protected
in the interest of insuring the
civil liberties of all unions. The
conspiracy prosecution of the
leaders of Mine-Mill for con-
spiring to file false non-commu-
nist affidavits was a transpar-
ent effort to use this ancient
anti-union device to avoid the
necessity of proving the actual
filing of such false affidavits.
The proceedings against Mine-
Mill before the Subversive Ac-
tivities Control Board is an as-
sault upon the rights of free
speech and free association of
all unions '. . .” ,

The UAW resolution further
criticized “the repressive meth-
ods” of the McCarran Act un-
der which the SACB proceed-

ings against Mine-Mill were
launched.

5.4 >l= >l=
IT was in this connection,

too, that the General Council of
District 65 Retail, Wholesale &
Department Store Union “voted
to oppose application of the Mc-
Carran Act to trade unions be-
cause its use against one union
could set a pattern for similar
attacks _on all unions,” ac-
cording to a news story in that
union’s official publication, The
65er.

Reporting on the recent ac-
tion of its General Council in
defense of Mine-Mill, the de-
partment store workers’ paper

President of Business Firm
Hits Headline N ame-calling

BOSTON, Mass.—The head of a Massachusetts publishers and
manufacturers consultants firm last month protested to The Wall
Street Journal for its reference to Mine-Mill as “red-labeled” in a

recent news story headline.

In a letter to the editor of the Journal dated June 15, President
Edmund C. Berkeley of Berkeley Enterprises, Inc., said:

“It seems to me that this kind of name-calling in a headline
is unAmerican, undemocratic, unfair, and antagonistic to the time
honored principle of Anglo-Saxon law that a person is innocent until

proved guilty.

“The International Union of Mine-Mill and Smelter Workers
has been attacked for many years, and charges. have been brought
against it. This-Union has fought back, and won a number of cases
in court. No uncontested court decision that I know of has estab-
lished” the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers-
is a Communist organization of any kind. The very use of the
adjective ‘red-labeled’ implies that the label has not stuck because
otherwise a stronger .adjective would be used.

“Senator Joe McCarthy of Winconsin, before his death, did
.a great‘ deal of damage to the United States by a similar use of
lies, and words implying falsehoods. As you remember, the Senate
of the United States finally convicted him of conduct unbecoming a
Senator. I hate to see the Wall Street Journal take steps in Sen-

ator McCarthy’s path.”

 

 

 

 

was passed by Congress_ over

the veto of Pres. Truman who
denounced it.”

The news story went on to
say that ‘Mine-Mill had been
“singled out for attack under
this law . . . in spite of repeated
denials under oath by the Mine-
Mill union’s officers that they
are Communists or Communist
sympathers, and court decisions
which have cleared the union of
charges of Communist domina-
tion.”

It reported that “many unions
had come to the support of
Mine-Mill in the present situa-
tion, including the Transport
Workers, Packinghouse Work-

ers, Oil, Chemical & Atomic
Workers and others.” A ~ ..

District 65 President David
Livingston was quoted as say-

ing, “The issue we fight on is"

whether this country is going
to have a free labor movement
or a labor front.”

were expressed-by an editorial

 NEW YORK——A simple device known as the “Guppy” will aid boating enthusi-

sts harrassed with salt water corrosion problems. It also provides an additional use
or,.one of the age-old metals-—zinc.

‘, Developed by the American Smelting dz Refining Company, the fish-shaped
a,“Guppy” is a five pound zinc alloy anode which can be suspended in the water while
_=‘a-boat is moored to protect
underwater metal parts and
fixtures from corroding. The

to AS&R, the secret is that
 galvanic corrosion has been put
to work in a controlled manner.
.‘”Made of a special zinc’ alloy
which is more active than any

Productivity Hits
Japanese Miners

Productivity in c r e a s e s are
hitting Japanese coal miners’
jobs just as hard as they have
in the United States.

Under a so-called “rationali-
zation” program, Japan plans
to cut coal miners’ employment
to 176,000 in 1963. It‘ was 455,-
000 in 1947. Production per work-
er planned for 1963 is more than
four times as much as in 1947.

The International Confedera-
tion of Free Trade Unions and
the Miners’ International Fed-
eration have written the Japan-
ese government urging favor-
able consideration of unemploy-
ed miners’ pay demands for
other jobs with a minimum wage
of 480 yen ($1.33) per day.

Meanwhile, it is reported that
Nippon Mining Company, a big
Japanese copper producer, is
closing down smaller mines
which will mean layoffs for 1,-

700 copper miners. Another 2,-

000 are being asked to volun-
teer for “retirement.” Other
non-ferrous mining concerns in
Japan are reported consider-
ing similar layoffs.

EXPANSION at home and abroad has been announced recent-
ly by several major non-ferrous producers. .
Phelps Dodge is going in with the government of El Salvador
and the Central.American Bank of Economic Integration to build

a $2 million copper wire and cable plant in El Salvador. The plant’s ' ’

products will enjoy special tariff protection in the Central American
common market countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras
and Nicaragua. 5
Anaconda Company and an Italian associate are reported to
have formed African Mining Co., which will invest $17 million in
exploration of a copper ore body .in Sudan where over 10,000,000
tons of ore averaging 2.78% copper h-ave already been established
at 500 feet. Another $17 million has been earmarked for a copper

_ prospect in another district in Sudan.

Kennecott Copper Corporation will start exercising options dat-
ing back to 1956 on a lead deposit in Reynolds and Shannon counties
in the Missouri lead belt. C. H. Burgess, Kennecott vice president
for exploration said a mine and mill costing “millions of dollars”
would be required to put the ore bodies into production.

Aluminum Company of America, at a time when the U.S. alu-
minum industry has capacity to produce more aluminum than it
can sell, is building a 60,000 ton per year aluminum smelter in
bauxite-rich Surinam, Dutch colony in northeast South America.
Location of the smelter in Surinam will permit Alcoa to ship its
production into the European common market countries, Holland,‘
Belgium, Luxembourg, France, West Germany and Italy, duty free.

U.S. produced aluminum, on the other hand, would be required to .

pay tariff duties in order to enter the common market.

MISSOURI is the scene of exploration by at least 18 major
metal mining companies looking for deposits of lead, zinc, copper,
iron and other minerals. The companies are currently spending
millions of dollars, and employing about 50 exploration geologists
in the state. 5 .

Major non-ferrous producers active in exploration in Missouri
include St. Joe Lead, National Lead, American Zinc, American
Smelting and Refining, Kennecott, American Metal Climax, Eagle

INTERNATIONAL COPPER RESEARCH ASSOCIATION is
the new name of Copper Products Development Association, or-
ganized just two and a half years ago by American Metal Climax,
AS&R, Anaconda, International Nickel, Kennecott and Phelps
Dodge. The association, now with some 35 member copper pro-
ducers in the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa and Australia,
plans a shift in emphasis with the change in name.

The association will confine itself in the future to technical
research in copper, and turn over to promotional and developmental
centers in all parts of the world the work previously carried on in
this country in developing new uses and application of copper. The
creation of such a copper promotional and development group in. the
United States is now in its early stages.

It will be under the joint sponsorship of producers, fabricators,
wire and cable mills, foundries and secondary metal suppliers,
whereas the association is sponsored only by producers. There are
now 14 copper promotion and development centers in other parts

of the world.

ResearchUrges Prompt Reports
()n All Mine and Mill Accidents

DENVER—All mine and mill locals are being urged to immediately report fatal,
near-fatal and seriously disabling accidents as they occur. The union’s Research De-
partment points‘ out that -these reports are more ‘important than ever, now that the
U. S. Bureau of Mines has resumed its mine safety surveys and fatality investigations
(see story below) and there is only about a year remaining before the field surveys

are completed. _-

Reports should be sen
by telegram, col1ect,'to the Mine-
Mill Research Department, 941
E. 17th Ave., Denver, or phoned
in to the office, KEystone 4-7211.

Telegrams arriving after busi-
ness hours or on week ends will
be phoned by Western Union at
once to the home of an officer
or staff member who can reach
the U. S. Bureau of Mines West-
ern headquarters on a 24-hour
basis every day of the week.

THE U. S. Bureau of Mines
has repeatedly asked for the
union’s cooperation on this mat-
ter.

Experience has proved that,

in a substantial number of cases
since the surveys started in J an-
uary, this is the fastest way the
Bureau can get information on
fatalities and other serious acci-
dents. This enables the Bureau
to dispatch an investigator to
the scene of an accident AT
ONCE to collect evidence and
pinpoint the cause of the acci-
dent. ' '

With this issue, the Mine-Mill
Union is starting a special col-
umn prepared by the Research
Department, called “Your Safe-
ty and Health.”

and enforcement legislation.

The Mines Bureau is now pre-
pared to investigate "near, fatal
accidents, where’ the victim’s
recovery is in doubt, as well as
fatal accidents where death is
immediate or happens shortly
after the injury occurs.

In all cases, the local union
reports to the Research Depart-
ment should include the name
of the victim, time and place of
accident, and nature of the in-

jury if the victim is still alive

and his recovery isin doubt.’

U niong Hails Mines Bureau  
Resumption  Safety Study

. WASHINGTON, D. C.——The mysterious log jam of inaction which suddenly»de-
veloped in mid-April on the Mine Safety Study authorized by Congress last year was
just as suddenly broken June 1 when Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall announced
selection of a three-man Mine Safety Study Board to function under John M. Kelly,
Assistant Interior Secretary for MineralResources.

Under the Board’s direc-
tion, the U. S. Bureau of
Mines‘ will continue to conduct
its field work in mine safety sur-
veys, mine fatality investigations
and other aspects of the mine
safety survey authorized by the
Metal and Non-Metallic Mines
Study Act of 1961 (Public Law
87-300).

This work got under way _in
January and was running
smoothly into mid-April when it
was mysteriously brought to a
halt. It was not resumed until
naming of the new Board last

month .
>I= >3: alt

NAMED to the Board are:
Paul Boyajian, chairman, a busi-
ness consultant of Phoenix,
Ariz.; Thomas J- Shepich, a
mining ‘engineer of Santa Rita,
N. M., and Harold J. Duncan
of Washington, D. C., a career
employee of the U. S. Geological
Survey since 1925. 4 .. 

Mine-Mill President John Clark
immediately hailed the resump-
tion of the interrupted surveys
by the Bureau of Mines. He
pointed out that much credit for
resumption of -the program is
due to Mine-Mill local unions
which, in coordinated action with
the International- office, main-
tained unremitting pressure to
get this work back on the tracks.

Noting that only a year and
three months remains before the
report on the survey is due to
be submitted to Congress under
provisions of the Act, Clark
urged all local unions to continue

cooperation as in the past with '

Bureau mine inspectors.

'l‘_he: International office, mean.- -
whﬂe. proceeded with its,_,act_i.Ve‘

participation in the program in
other ways.

FOLLOWIN announcement of

the appointment of the Mine

Safety Study Board, Interior Sec-
retary Udall’s office invited
Mine-Mill representatives to
meet with the Board to outline
the union’s views on the need
for mine safety legislation and

“its recommendations as to the

scope of the survey.

8 Mine-Mill’s Legislative Repre-
sentative Horace White and Re-
search Director Arthur W. Stuart
met for this purpose with mem-
bers of the Board in Washing-
ton on June 18. The discussion,
lasting several hours, covered
such points as cooperation be-
tween Mines Bureau inspectors
and Mine-Mill local unions, and
coordination between the union
and the Bureau’s Western safe-
ty headquarters in Denver.
White and Stuart also submitted
a long list of specific Mine-Mill
recommendations as to survey
scope and method.

The union’s long-standing posi-'

tion in support of mine safety
inspection and enforcement leg-
islation, dating back over 10
years, was reviewed.
VOLUMINOUS testimony sub-
mitted by Mine-Mill at Congres-
sional hearings in support of
such safety legislation in 1956,

1957 and 1961 was summarized

for the Safety Board members
who indicated great interest in
the research work and argu-
ments advanced by the union
over years of campaigning for a
federal, mine safety bill.’

White and Stuart later had a
long ‘conference with Marling J.

Ankeny,’ Director of the U. S.-
Bureau of Mines. Ankeny ex--

pressed great appreciation for
the excellent cooperation the Bu-
reau inspectors had been receiv-
ing from Mine-Mill local unions
in the course of mine safety in-
vestigations and inspections.

He said the safety recommen-
dations received from Mine-Mill
local unions had been of the
greatest value to the federal
inspectors. ‘

Some time earlier the mine management,‘ at the reques 99
Local 937, had suspended the use of ammonium nitrate because he
men underground were suffering from nausea, dizziness, f
rashes and other adverse symptoms attributed to the use of ‘ithi;
powder. The powder had been “do-it-yourself” mixed with. diese
oil by the mine company, the use of which is prohibitedun
