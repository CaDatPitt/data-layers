9. The biggest obstacle holding back the development of the
League and preventing it from utilizing the conditions favorable
for the development of a mass organization is the bitter factional
struggle which is a reflection of the struggle in the Party and ' —
arises from the same basic causes. The general basis of the group
strife is the political and organizational weaknesses of the League,
especially its unsatisfactory social composition and national com-
position. \_ T
Neither the Majority nor the Minority carried out the decision ,
of the Y.C.I. demanding that their connections with the respective
Party groups be completely severed. The Majority was wrong in
attempting to place the responsibility of the factional struggle on
 the shoulders of the Minority. Both groups actively participated in
 ’ factional activity which had a serious retarding effect on the
‘ — League, as is shown by the fact that (a) therpolitical errors of .
both groups were uncritically carried over into the League, (b) the . *
work of the League w_as gravely neglected, and comrades were not
utilized on the basis of their abilities and in many cases comrades
were not drawn into leading work because of the factional situation,
(c) the methods employed contributed towards developing a non-
Communist ideology and. incorrect ideas regarding the role of the
League.

The leaders of the factional struggle must be strongly con-
demned, not only because the C.I. has declared that the Party
struggle “is not based on any serious differences of principle,” but
also because there are no serious differences with regard to League

were chiefly frustrated by the joint resistance of the N.E.C. Major-
ity and the Polcom of the Party to the Open Letter of the Y.C.I.
This must be characterized as a direct political resistance to the
decisions of the CI. and Y.C.I. for the unification of the League.
Moreover, unprincipled and utterly impermissible methodswere
utilized, i.e., formal acceptance of Letter by Majority whilst ex-
pressing no disagreement with political objection of the Party
Majority, holding up the Letter, passing of statement nominally,

accepting the Letter but which was actually intended to be a reply .

to it, etc.

The factional spirit prevailing in the League and Party and the
misunderstanding of both groups regarding the decisions of the VI
World Congress led the Majority to take this attitude which was
the chief cause of the intensification of the factional fight and con-
sequently resulted in a tremendous set—back to the entire League.
‘ The Minority voted for the acceptance of the Open Letter and
against the Polcom appeal. The factional activity was continued,
however (continuation to charge the C.E.C. and N.E.C. with being
Right wing, which was forbidden by the Letter), which shows that
their acceptance of the Open Letter was not based on a full under-
standing of the tasks it set.

The handling of the Y.C.I. Letter showed that directly after

the World Congress of the Y.C.I. the Buro Majority extended its .

non-critical attitude to the Polcom Majprity, to the extent of com-
pletely and openly merging with it. This merging was still further
demonstrated at the time of the Party_Convention when it parti-
cipated in all caucus meetings and was indistinguishable from the
Party Majority group. The Minority, which the Open Letter de-
clared had already taken a partly critical attitude to the individual

A groupings and their mistakes, failed, however, to continue this line‘.

At the time of the Party Convention it had completely merged with
the Party Minority. ‘ ‘

The admission of both groups of their political errors and fac-
tional actions and their pledge to carry out the decision of the C.I.
and Y.C.I. gives a guarantee for the unification of the League.
Attempts to question the sincerity of the comrades in recognizing
their errors will be regarded as dangerous factionalism.

The future development of the League depends upon the com-
plete rooting out of the deadly disease of factionalism and the
smashing of all caucuses and the decisive breaking of factional con-
nections with Party groups. The last factional struggle had so
‘exhausted the League that a certain demoralization is already ob-
servable which must be energetically and speedily overcome. The
ending of factionalism is a political task of the first magnitude.

SITUATION OF THE YOUNG WORKERS.

10. The growth of the importance of the youth in industry, due
to capitalist rationalization and the growing danger of war makes

I

10

the task of winning the youth one of the basic problems of the
Communist movement. A bitter struggle for the young workers is
raging between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The heavy bur-
dens imposed on the young workers are driving them to the Left
and causing them to play an increasingly active role in the class
struggle. .

11. In rationalized production young workers are playing an
ever more important role. Youth labor is being drawn into industry
at a faster rate. Youth from non-industrial occupations, particularly
the farming youth, are being shifted into industry. Young girls
play an extremely important part in production, are being drawn
into the heavy, rationalized industries like auto, industry in the
South, and particularly into industry in ‘the small industrial towns
in the mining and steel sections. The proportion of young workers
in heavy industry is increasing and the general orientation of the
young workers is directed more and more to heavy industry. New
industries, established on a rationalized basis, employ a majority of

young workers. Thus the weight of the young workers in industry V

is greatly increased, leading to an increasing participation of the
young workers in the struggles in these industries. Simultaneously,
the continuance of the agrarian crisis, which throws large masses
of farming youth into the cities, the shifting of industries, the
industrialization of the South (processes which are organically tied
up with the rationalization process) and the shutting down of immi-
gration, are uniting to make youth labor the main source for un-
skilled labor in the United States. Consequently, among the youth
in general the growth in the number of proletarian young workers
in basic industries widens the gap between them and the non-pro-
letarian youth.

The continuance of the agrarian crisis, which is caused by the
disparity in the rate of development between industry and agricul-
ture, and the rationalization of agriculture, leads to the expropria-
tion of the poor farmers, the creation of an ever-larger number of
tenant farmers, agricultural laborers and migratory workers,
heightens their miserable conditions, and to the migration of large
masses to the cities.

The worsening of the conditions on the farm, which is ac-
companied by cultural backwardness, is felt with particular in-
tensity by the agricultural youth, who are extremely dissatisfied and
form a large proportion of those migrating to the cities.

The conditions of the Negro youth are becoming worse. In
addition to suffering from social and racial oppression, they are
doubly exploited in industry and agriculture, where they are placed
in the worst jobs. They are largely excluded from educational
facilities and suffer greatly from child labor. The capitalists are
making special efforts to militarize the Negro youth and win them
to the service of imperialism. The Negro youth has already
demonstrated the beginnings of class and race-consciousness.

 

 

 

11

The real and thorough vocational training of the youth is abso-
lutely essential in order to provide for their proper development.
The capitalists provide only for training of a relatively small num-
ber of skilled mechanics, technicians, foremen, straw bosses, etc.,
and for the great mass of the young workers provide either no
training whatsoever or just sufficient to meet the part operations
they fulfill in industry. Our demand for real vocational training
thru the establishment of work-schools is part of the struggle for
the Socialist reorganization of youth labor, which can be realized
only by a workers’ government.

12. The rapid expansion of American imperialism has given
rise to a very rapid-militarization. The United States has become
one of the biggest military powers. It has the largest military bud-
get of any country. It has already entered into a naval race with
Great Britain for control of the sea, in which the United States is
gaining headway. The United States has already assumed the

_ characteristics of a gigantic capitalist military power. For universl

conscription it has substituted a strong and well-trained mercenary
force, and large organized and unorganized reserves. The National
Guard is being strengthened and centralized and is being used more
and more against the workers in strikes. The militarization of the
entire population is proceeding rapidly. Industry is being prepared
for wartime functioning. Thru the C.M.T.C., in which the pro-
portion of young workers is increasing, R.O.T.C. and semi-milita-
rist and militarist organizations, the youth is being militarized.
Military organizations (American Legion) and semi-military or-
ganizations (Boy Scouts) are receiving the fullest support from the
capitalist class, and are becoming rapidly fused with the state
apparatus, being transformed into direct state organizations. Com-
pulsory military training is being introduced into all schools, in-
cluding girls’ schools, as an additional method for the militarization
of the youth. A military caste, the final product and symbol of
modern militarism, is being created in the United States. As part
of their militarization program the bourgeoisie develop big propa-
ganda pacifist stunts acclaiming America as the champion of World
Peace, etc. These are calculated to blind the working class and to
cover up the preparations for imperialist war. »
13. The burden of militarism and the effects of capitalist
rationalization are worsening the bad conditions of American young
workers, who are the most exploited section. of the working class.
Long hours, low wages, child labor, no protection from accidents
and diseases, unsanitary conditions, brutal speed-up, wage-cuts and
unemployment fall brutally on the shoulders of the youth who are
mainly unorganized and unskilled. Consequently the young work-
ers are being radicalized and actively participate in the class strug-,
gle, despite the fact that the influence of the bourgeois organiza-
tions and reformism are very strong. It is this general process of
radicalization which enables the Y.C.I. in its Letter to characterize

tic but as in many instances the most advanced and conscious part
of the proletariat.” . . »

Youth strikes are an important sign of the new role of the
youth. The radicalization of the young workers has further signi-
ficance insofar as they constitute a link between the foreign-born
and American—born workers.

14. This process of radicalization-is expressed in the active
participation of the young workers in important struggles (mining,
textile, needle), in the growing mood for other struggles in other
industries (auto, rubber) and in resistance to rationalization in the
South, in the strikes now taking place, in the increased sensitiveness
and rapidity with which the young workers react to pressure of
social changes, in youth strikes, and in the success of the League
in placing itself at the head of large numbers of young workers in
many instances and bringing its program into larger ranks of the
working class.

15. The process of radicalization develops at an uneven tempo,
bringing about radicalization of the young workers in some indus-
tries sooner than among other sections of the young workers. The
process of radicalization has affected mostly the young workers in
the industries which went thru and are going thru crisis—mining,
textile, needle.

SITUATION OF THE’ LEAGUE.

16. The Communist Youth League still remains a small or-
ganization largely isolated from the masses of young workers with
an unsatisfactory national and social composition. It has, however,
seriously begun to tackle youth problems, has not repeated the same
glaring reformist mistakes which were committed before the 4th
Convention, and has begun to participate in the mass struggles of
the young workers.

The League can record certain successes in itspractical work
since the 4th National Convention which shows that further 'steps
are being taken towards the development of a mass organization.
These are: participation in strikes, anti—militarist work in the armed
forces, concrete steps for the trade union organization of young
workers, more attention to basic industries, increase in membership,
participation in the’ election on the basis of a youth program and
new forms for drawing children into strikes.

Whilst not under-estimating the importance of the development _

it would be a big mistake, to over-estimate these achievements, a
tendency which exists in the League. The present situationof the
League demands a healthy spirit of ‘self-criticism which must be
fostered by the leadership in order that the mistakes and weak-
nesses may be clearly seen and overcome. The development of the
League is strongly lagging behind the growing class—consciousness
of the young workers.

the young workers as being “no more completely politically apathe-

17. The basic fact in the League situation is the weakness and
shortcomings of its leadership which has not been proletarianized,
has not been renewed and has tended to stagnate owing to the fac-
tional struggle. Consequently, the League has been unable to
respond to and take full advantage of the favorable objective situa-
tion for the development of its extension and influence and has
committed a whole series of Right mistakes. The uncritical attitude
towards the Party groupings has resulted in the carrying -over of
the political errors of these groups into the League and a weaken-

ing in the political activity of the League, consequently retarding,

its development. The factional struggle has been the biggest
obstacle preventing the League from overcoming its errors and ful-
filling its tasks.

18. The League has not yet understood how to develop a real
youth policy and has not a correct line towards the young
workers, both inside and outside the League, which is due to poli-
tical and organizational shortcomings. This wrong approach to
the young workers is shown by our failure to hold in the League
many good proletarian elements recruited during struggles (mining,
textile, etc.). The chief examples are as follows: factional struggle
and unprinc_ip'led methods; general under-estimation of mass work
and considerable confusion in the formulation of concrete economic
demands according to the situation in the factory or industry;
under-estimation of trade union work; misunderstandings on how
to develop special forms of youth organizations (trade unions,
auxiliary organizations); bureaucratic methods of work; only the
first beginning in the introduction of youthful methods into mass
activity and into the life of the League; incorrect relations with
the Party; neglect of Negro work and prevalence of white chauvi-
nism; deep-rooted sectarian and false ideas regarding the role of
the League which is often regarded as a social or self’-improvement

" organization, consequently giving rise to the tendency to hide the

face of _the League during struggles; insufficient pushing to the

forefront of proletarian elements; neglect of the task of raising
the theoretical knowledge of the members. ' -
19. Consequently, depite the favorable situation, there -has been

‘ even decrease in the percentage of proletarian elements since the 4th

Convention and a collapse of organizations formed as a result of
struggles. (December 1928, students 32%, industrial workers 44%,
of which the majority are not employed in heavy industry and big
shops). This question is closely connected with the question of
the national composition, the immigrant narrowness of the or-
ganization and the inability to retain American young workers who
were recruited. The gravity of this situation must be strongly
emphasized.

20. By developing anti-militarist work within the forces, the
League has broken with the bad traditions of the American labor
movement for the first time. The League has failed, however, to

 

14

see the decisive political significance of linking up the struggle
against capitalist rationalization with the struggle against, the war
danger. The failure to understand that anti-militarist work [must
be a part of the daily mass activity which must aim at exposing the
militarist plans of the bourgeoisie and strengthen the resistance of

the young workers to the war mongers ; the weakness of the mass .

activity; and the carrying on of the factional struggle which has
been a decisive obstacle against the development of mass work must
be regarded as expressing an under-estimation of the war danger.
There have been a whole series of serious pacifist errors. Although
these have been corrected, pacifist ideas are, however, still deeply
rooted within the League. The anti-militarist work is weak and
not on a permanent basis.

21. Very little Negro work has been done during the past
period and has had no definite plan or line for its work among the
Negro youth. The League has under-estimated the significance of
the new line for Negro work, laid down for America by the VI
World Congress, and has not learned how to approach the Negro
youth. The struggle against white chauvinism has not yet been
taken up. The neglect of Negro work is a major error of the
League.

22. The absolute failure of the League to mobilize its members
for the building up of the Workers Sport Movement is characteris-
tic of the under-estimation of the importance of working in the
mass organizations, and has been largely responsible for the immi-
grant narrowness of the L.S.U.

’23. Organizationally the League is in a very weak condition.
It is entirely based on geagraphical units and no shop nuclei are
functioning. Fluctuation is very high. Throughout the Leagues
there are profound organizational weaknesses and a marked in-
efficiency and lack of discipline which impedes the carrying out

of decisions.

24. The struggle against opponent youth organizations has
been completely neglected.

25. The weakness of internationalism in the League is shown
by the insufficient response to struggle in other countries (China,
Latin America, Europe, etc.), and an under-estimation of the role
of the Y.C.I. in leading its American section.

26. These errors show the existence of a strong Right danger
within the League.

“In your fight to win the working youth and against the
War Danger you must not forget. the objective Right obstacles
which will be in your way in the form of traditions and old
methods of work, under-estimation of the degree of activization
of the working youth and of the role of the C.Y.L., over-esti-
mation of the opponents’ strength and of the inertia existing
among the Working youth.” (Y.C.. Letter.) ‘

 

15
TASKS OF THE LEAGUE.

27. The main political task of the League, to be achieved by
daily mass activity is to fulfill its role as the leader of the Amer-
icau young workers in the struggle against capitalist rationalization
and the war danger, linking up this struggle with the final aims of
the Communist International. The League must place itself at the
head of the young workers, lead their daily struggle, stimulate the
growing class consciousness, organize them, _educate them and
recruit" masses into the League.

The successful carrying out of this task demands a decisive
change in the forms and methods of the League work by the dev-
elopment of mass activity and new youthful methods of work. This
means the energetic carrying out of the decisions of the V World
Congress of the Y.C.I. regarding the development of a real youth
policy which involves a sensitive response to the daily political and
economic events from the standpoint of how they effect the young
workers thus representing the interests of the young workers in all
phases of life; the fight for the every day interests of the young
workers and the putting forward of concrete demands correspond-
ing to their needs and linking them up with our ultimate aim; the
development of forms of auxiliary youth organizations and new
attractive methods of activity in mass work and also within the
League; participation in the political life of the Party on the basis
of contributing to solving of the problem of the Party by express-
ing the line of the Comintern. '

The League is slowly moving along this road but has not yet
reached the turning point. A decisive break must be made with the
old traditions and methods. This can be accomplished by the widest
mass activity and making the proletarian youth in the basic indus-
tries the center of gravity of our work and by carrying on a sys-
tematic and ruthless campaign against the many grave weaknesses
and shortcomings. Closer contact with the masses is the crying
necessity, for without it the League cannot move forward. To
achieve this is primarily a question of a broad daily economic trade
union work. -

(a) The entire League must be mobilized for the carrying
through of this turn without hesitation and the will for change
must imbue the activity of every member and be expressed in every
sphere of activity. This move towards the masses makes it neces-
sary to carry on a wide educational campaign in the League explain-
ing its role and tasks, thus overcoming the widespread misunder-
standing which makes it difficult to go firmly forward with the

‘ development of mass work.

(b) All efforts in this direction will be frustrated unless the
factional strife is completely eliminated. ‘

“There is a direct correlation between factional struggle and

the weakness of the League. Therefore, one of the chief

 

16 }
means of overcoming factional strife is development of the i
, League’s activity.” (Y.C.I. Letter.)

(c) In order to overcome the weaknesses and shortcomings of

the leadership, it is necessary to conduct a systematic policy of

drawing in new young proletarian elements throughout the League

and to undertake the regular training of the cadres in order that

they will be fitted for their responsibilities.

((1) The problem of the social composition of the League is
particularlypacute. The small number of League members in the 4
main industries and the large percentage of students expresses the
isolation of the League from the basic ‘sections of the young '
workers, and is a basis for the large number of mistakes committed I
and the inability of the League to make so far a real turn to mass »

. activity. The membership of the League must be thoroughly pro-
letarianized. This is bound up with the burning task of American-
ization which is an imperative necessity. ' 

(e) The struggle against war danger must be tied up with the 
everyday struggles of the young workers and activities of the 3
League. The abstract propagandist handling of the war danger 1
must be abandoned. The imperialist war plans against the Soviet .
Union‘ must be systematically unmasked and the achievements of I
the Workers’ Republic in the building ‘of socialism vigorously >
popularized. The exposure of the growing danger of a new war ,
between America and Great Britain must be linked up with this 1
campaign. The inevitability of war under capitalism must be
explained. A wide-spread educational campaign must be carried on
inside and outside the League popularizing the decisions of the VI i
World Congress in the struggle against the war danger, popular-
izing the Leninist teachings of “Transform the Imperialist War
into Civil War” i.e., working for the defeat of the American Gov-
ernment when war breaks out. '

An energetic campaign must be carried on against the various
forms of strong pacifist illusions amongst the young workers and
the pacifist ideas which are still deep-rooted in the League.

The work in the armed forces, which is a major task, must be
extended and placed on a permanent basis. The program of
soldiers’ and sailors’ demands must be improved so that it will really
express their ‘daily needs. Special activity must be carried on.
among the young workers_in war industries, navy yards, ammuni-
tion centers, chemical plantsand ports.

The_under-estimation of the war danger in the ranks of the
League must be ruthlesslycombatted and every member mobilized
for anti-war work, The work in the C.M.T.C., other militarist and
semi-militarist organizations, must be~intensified.

(f) The League must carry on a broad anti-imperialist activity-
against the murderous onslaught of i American imperialism on the

- toiling colonial masses, particularly China and Latin America. The
work of the Anti-Imperialist League must be wholeheartedly sup-

 

17

ported. The League must give assistance to the’ revolutionary youth
movement in Latin America and help to establish Y.C.L.s where
none exist. ‘ e

' (g) The present period demands ‘a strengthening and extension
of our economic trade union work. To meet the growing radicaliza-
tion of the working youth and to successfully lead the spontaneous
strikes, necessitates the proper organizational forms and methods
to recruit and hold the young workers. Our main task is organizing
the working youth. We must pay special attention to winning the
young workers for the new unions. To this end it is necessary that
we establish youth sections" in all the new class industrial unions
and that these be of a militant fighting character defending the
interests, of the young workers and leading them in struggle. The
present skeleton youth sections in the mining, textile and needle
unions must be built into real mass organizations. Economic Youth

Associations are the instrument of reaching the young workers ‘in '

those industries where there are no unions, or the existing unions
refuse admittance. With the policy laid down of building up new
industrial militant unions and economic youth associations, every
member must find a place in one of these as an active member,
organizer and leader in the everyday struggles of the young
workers.

The growth of mass unemployment makes it necessary to carry
on an organized activity amongst the young unemployed on the
basis of concrete program of demands and to develop forms of
organizing the unemployed for struggling for these demands.

‘Especial attention must be given to individual factory work,
youth conferences, shop papers, etc., in reaching the young workers,
organizing them and leading them in their struggles and strikes.
In all of our strike activity the League must play a leading open
role, popularizing its program and demands at all times. In these
struggles the League must be built.

In all of the struggles of the /working youth we must popu-
larize our basic program of demands in connection with fighting
against the destructive effects of rationalization.- To mobilize the

‘young workers we must issue demands in each industry, concretize

them to each situation and rooting out the misunderstandings which
exist in this sphere of activity.

VVithin the trade unions, youth sections, and other economic
forms, our League must function through a well organized system
of Y.C.L. fractions. This is a necessary pre—requisite to successful
work. In all our activities we must work in close connection with
revolutionary Left wing organizations, especially the T.U.E.L. An
immediate task. is the election of delegates to the coming Trade

,Union Unity Conference.

(h) The League must finally make a real beginning in work
among the masses of Negro youth and carry on a- bitter struggle
against white chauvinism in the League. The decisions of the CI.-

on the Negro question must be popularized and applied in the
work amongst the Negro youth. There have been many evidences
that the conditions for work among the Negro youth are ripe.
Unless this work is energetically undertaken, the League will never
develop into a mass organization.

(i) The powerful influence of reformist ideas is the chief
ideological barrier which we have to overcome amongst the young
workers. The fact that the organizational expression so far as the
youth is concerned is very weak, leads to the danger of under-
estimating the influence of reformist ideas and a weakening of
the struggle against it. "I he powerful reformist apparatus within
the working class, particularly that of the A.F. of L., strongly
influences the youth and becomes more aggressive and dangerous
as the class consciousness of the young workers awakens. “Left”
and progressive elements (Muste group) actively assist the reform-
ists in the doping of the youth by means of their Left phraseology.
There must be a particularly energetic struggle» against these ele-
ments who are a greater danger because of their special role in
misleading the radicalized workers.

The League must also make a real beginning in the very im-
portant task of struggling against the bourgeois youth organiza-
tions. Every member must, however, clearly understand that the
reformist ideology is the chief danger and that the fight against it
must be the content of our activity also in the struggle against
the bourgeois youth organizations. .

It is particularly necessary to carry on systematic activity
explaining the teachings of Marx and Lenin, the nature of the
capitalist state and the necessity for the proletarian revolution.

(1') A strong Agitprop Department must be immediately
established and plans worked out for carrying on a regular train-
ing work a_mongst the entire membership by means of local train-
ing groups and district schools. It is also necessary to publish a
series of educational pamphlets and to develop a League literature.
Special training facilities must be arranged for League function-
aries. The department must not only work out practical proposals
for brightening the inner life, but systematically guide the applica-
tion of attractive new methods of work in the daily ma_ss activity,
especially aiming at developing the militancy of the League. In
this connection, the questions of uniforms must be taken up and
proposals put before the members.

(k) The overcoming of the chronic organizational weaknesses
is one of the outstanding tasks of the League. A systematic im-
provement of the organizational position is absolutely necessary in
order to develop the mass work. Carefiil steps must be imm'ediately
undertaken for the building up of shop nuclei and the first steps
in the reorganization of the League on this basis. The inefficiency
and bureaucracy which is now a feature of the League—largely an
effort of the factional struggle and methods—must be completely

 

 

. ;.._

‘ 19

eradicated. This can be accomplished by improving the work of

the leading organs particularly the N.E.C. and District Commit-
tees. The work of the N.E.C. must be completely reorganized and
put on a functioning basis. Connected with this task is the activ-
ization of the membership, by setting tasks for every member,
guiding their activity, bearing in mind the inclinations and abilities.
Preparations for illegality must be made immediately.

(1) The League must be made to understand the growing
importance of children in the class struggle. The N.E.C. and the
districts must give more direct everyday guidance to this work.
We must recognize the bad situation as both regards the number
and quality of comrades assigned to Pioneer work and take steps
to overcome this.

The Young Pioneers must participate in all of the struggles
of the working class and take up the struggle in defence of the
working class children, against child misery and more particularly
against child labor. We must fight against all conceptions that the
children must not be drawn into the strikes and struggles of the
workers. The League must energetically call to the attention of the
Party its duty to the children’s movement. More systematic
guidance must be given to the graduation of Pioneers into the
League and their utilization in the League’s work and their being
drawn into active leadership.

(m) The problem of extending the influence of the League
among the ‘farming youth must be seriously considered and the
first elementary steps in this field of work taken immediately.

(n) It is necessary to form workers’ defense organizations,
especially in connection with the economic struggles and for the
protection of meetings and demonstrations. This matter must be
taken up with the Party. ,

‘ 28.’ The League is now reaching the turning point in ‘its
growth. To finally over-come the grave weaknesses and to place
it firmly on a mass basis demands the recognition of errors in a
fearless spirit of Bolshevik self-criticism, which must be fostered
by the leading organs.

The mighty struggles looming ahead, above all, the menacing
war danger, demand from every young Communist untiring energy

’ and relentless determination in carrying out his or her tasks in

the class struggle. The League is faced with big difficulties. The
deep-rooted danger of Right deviations and mistakes must be
continually guarded against. The powerful influence of reformism
on the young workers must be vigorously fought on the basis of
a careful understanding of its forms and methods. Trotskyist ideas
must be finally eradicated within the League, and the campaign
against Trotskyism continued. Not only factionalism but also all

non-Communist methods, corruption and unprincipledness must be

ruthlessly stamped out.
By carrying out the decisions of the Young Communist Inter-

ing into a mass organization the leader of the toiling youth of the
United States.

ig I 1 I —.
Speech of Y.C.I. Representative

COMRADES :-

The Fourth National Convention of the .Young Communist
League of America takes place during a critical period in the
development of the American Communist movement, and has,
therefore, a very special significance not only for the League but
also for the Communist Party as well. The decisions of the Con-
vention will not only contribute towards the development of the
;Young Communist League but will also have a very big influence
upon the Communist Party. The fact that the Convention has

 

shown itself to be united on all of the basic questions confronting ‘

it, the fact that the Convention has made its political line the line
of the Comintern, shows that the young Communists in America are
already rendering a great service to the Communist International
and to the Communist Party.

I want to tell the comrades that the Comintern is determined
to end the factional strife that has been raging for so many years
in the American Party and League. The Comintern is determined
to unify the Party and it can be done and it will be done, because
the basis for overcoming this factional strife is already eicisting.
The fact that the American workers are being radicalized, the fact
that masses of American workers are taking a conscious part in
the class struggle, this is giving the basis. for overcoming the
factional strife which has raged so long in the Party. Moreover,
the very fact that we are in the situation, that the working class of
America is awakening, shows ..the necessityfor the taking of drastic
measures, if necessary, in order that the unity of the Party and
League will be guaranteed, and that the Party and League will be
able to tackle their tasks as worthy sections of the Communist
International. The situation is very serious, comrades: When we
consider the problems confronting the Comintern, when we consi-
der that we live in" the period of proletarian revolution, in the
period when great mass struggles are taking place, and when human-
ity is being brought again to the brink of a new war, the situation
is much too serious to allow any polite or diplomatic phrases or
methods to stand in the way of bringing about the complete unifi-
cation of the Communist movement irr America. Not even the
cleverest tricks of the cleverest American politicians will divert
the Comintern from the path it is following now in its determina-
tion to unify the Communist Party and Communist League.

21

The historical basis for factionalism, comrades, is passing. It
is passing because the old immigrant narrowness of the Party is
beginning to give way before the movement of the’ American work-
ers who are coming to the Party. But despite the factthat the“'his—
torical basis is passing, the Party is still burdened by the tradition
of factionaljsm, still burdened by the old establishedgroups with
very close personal‘ ties, that is why it is so necessary that the
groups shall be broken up. These traditions of factional struggle
have brought with them the introduction of non-Communist and
unprincipled methods which have become so widespread that they
have caused a certain demoralization and degeneracy within the
ranks of the Communist movement. Every comrade knows that it
was during the recent months that these methods reached their
highest pitch, both in the League and in the Party.)

If we take our League, comrades, we find things going on in

our League which are a tragedy for a Young Communist organiza-’

tion. Young proletarians, whose class consciousness is just awaken-
ing and who desire to take. part in the Communist movement, are

introduced into a faction, are made members of a faction, where ‘

one side‘ or the other propagandizes them for their petty group
struggles. Instead of teaching these new proletarian comrades even
one basic principle of the Communist International, their minds are
poisoned by factionalism, which makes it terribly difficult for them
to understand the aims of the Communist movement. We find that
groups and the group struggle has reached such a point that much
personal antagonism and hatred exists between members of the
Young Communist League, who should be co-operating with one
another in-a comradely struggle, fighting against capitalism, and
not struggling against one another in an unprincipled manner in
the organization. This has gone on for so long that it has become
to be regarded aspart of the normal life of the League that there
should be factions, and the comrades have been blinded to what
they are driving to if «this factional struggle goes on. What part
can our League play in the fight against the war danger and strug-
gles that are arising in this country if we have a League which is
developed in this way? ,

. It was during recent months, comrades, that the unprincipledness
of this factionalism reached its highest pitch. I think that the
sharpest and the worst form of it has been the attitude that has
been taken to the Comintern. In making this reference, I am not’
speaking with ‘regard to the responsibility of particular groups,
I am speaking on the basis of my own knowledge of the ideas that
are current in the membership, and there is no point in discussing
here who is more responsible. The fact is that both groups by their
factional activity have contributed towards developing this attitude
to the Comintern. The idea has been portrayed that in the Comin-
tern the leadership are a bunch ‘of politicians scrambling for power,
that the policies can be explained in the terms‘ of “Did Smith or

22

Jones write this?” or “What IS tne influence of Robinson at this
moment in the Comintern P”. Comrades, this is a sign of degene-
racy, when such things can become current gossip, or rumour. It
is a denial of the basic principles of Leninism on which the Comin-
tern is built. The Comintern an organization founded as a result
of the bitterest class struggles and proletarian revolution, is based
on the scientific teachings of Marx and Lenin. The decisions of
the Comintern are based upon a study of the objective conditions
in accordance with the teachings of our great learders Marx and
Lenin. Personalities are never allowed to determine what policy
should be carried out. It is a foul slander on the Comintern and
on the hundreds of thousands of class conscious workers who are
every day carrying on the bitter class struggle to declare that the
decisions of the Comintern are a result of a struggle for power
between the various groups. The comrades who make statements
forget that the Comintern is composed of such parties as that of
the Soviet Union, China and Germany (to mention only three of
the largest sections), the members of which by their daily struggle
against tremendous difficulties contribute to the decisions that are
made by the Executive Committee.

Of course, these slanders are not made openly. In the meetings
and in the conventions we hear fine words regarding the Comintern
and its leadership, but fine words in the open don’t cover up the
foul slanders that are made in the caucuses. We are not deceived
by what is said in the open meetings.

Now with regard to the struggle within the League itself. The
thesis states very clearly both the general historical causes of the
factional struggle and its immediate causes during the last period.
It is not necessary to repeat the historical causes of the factional
struggle because by this time every member should know them by
heart. The Y.C.I. declares that both groups carried on an unprin-
cipled factional struggle, that the groups in the League shared the
political errors of their respective Party groups and also the mis-
takes which were made by the Party as a whole. In fact, the
groups in the League acted just as youth sections of the Party
groups. These mistakes are dealt with in the thesis.

We considered it necessary, however, in drafting the thesis to
especially characterize two political errors made by the Majority
wherein they placed themselves in direct opposition to the efforts
of the Comintern and Y.C.I. to bring about the unification of the
Communist forces in the United States.

Firstly, the opposition to the organizational proposals of the
C.I. which were an essential part of the Open Letter. We do not,
of course, argue that the comrades should accept blindly and
mechanically all decisions that are made. They have the right to
express their opinion and to oppose decisions, if they think the
decisions are wrong. This argument (the “right” to oppose) was
made several times in the meetings of the Bureau of the N.E.C.

Certainly, the comrades have the “right” to oppose the Comintern.
They have the “right” to be wrong. The Comintern has also the
right to oppose these comrades who make such a political mistake,
and to compel them to accept the political responsibility of such
errors. We have convinced the comrades that, they made a mistake
in opposing the organizational proposals of the C.I. The .C.I. which
had closely studied the situation in America and which had laid
down a very clear political line for the entire membership, also
understood what organizational decisions should be carried out in
order to guarantee that the political line would be put into opera-
tion. The Majority made a political mistake in opposing the or-
ganizational decisions of the C.I. They did not understand that
these organizational decisions were also political and an essential
part of the Open Letter.

Secondly, the Majority fought against the Open ‘Letter of the

Y.C.I. What this meant we have made quite clear in the thesis.‘

The thesis states as follows: ,

“The ‘efforts made by the Y.C.I. to overcome the factional
struggle immediately after the V World Congress of the Y.C.I.
were chiefly frustrated by the joint resistance of the N.E.C.
majority and the Polcom of the Party to the Open Letter of
the Y.C.I. This must be characterized as a direct political
resistance to the decisions of the C.I. and Y.C.I. for the uni-
fication of the League. More over unprincipledness and utterly
impermissible methods were utilized, i.e. formal acceptance of
letter by Majority whilst expressing no disagreement with
political objection of the Party-Majority, holding up the letter,
passing of statement nominally, accepting the letter but which
was actually intended to be a reply to it, etc.”

This was a very grave mistake and the fact that this political
resistance was accompanied by unprincipled and corrupt methods
led to such a situation in the League that we must, regard this epi-
sode as one of the darkest pages in the history of our American sec-
tion. We want to tell the members of the League that these
methods, which led to demoralization, do not deceive us in the least.
We know exactly what goes on and the motives of the leadership.

This attitude to the Y.C.I. and the declaration that was made

that the Y.C.I. is opposing the Comintern, is especially bad, when

we remember the role that the Y.C.I. plays in the Comintern not
only in fighting everywhere for the carrying out of the decisions
of the C.I., but also in actually participating and contributing
towards these decisions. The sections of the Y.C.I., particularly in
the Soviet Union, China, Germany and France, have a splendid
recordas being in the forefront fighting for the decisions of the
Comintern. Our American League, however, has not only not
fought for the decisions of the Comintern, but has even gone so far
as to fight the Y.C.I. and to declare that the Y.C.I. is against the
Comintern.

All of these mistakes, however, have been recognized in a frank
and open manner in this thesis. It is necessary to see that the recog-

 

nition of the mistakes as laid down in the thesis is carried into the
' daily activity of the members in the future.

In the course of the discussion, in dealing with factionalism,
the question of percentages has been introduced. It seems to have
been in the past one of the strongest arguments made with regard
to the factional struggle. Now, philosophically, all things are re-
lated, and it is possible to show the connection between arithmetic
an politics, but in introducing the arithmetical arguments, com-
ra_ es are only ‘causing the utmost confusion. The most interesting
thing was that some of the comrades who so virtuously denounce
the arithmetical arguments were the very ones who used it. -

Comrades, in this thesis we have not approached the proble
from the standpoint of sharing responsibility, of 50-50, etc. VVe
have approached it from a political standpoint, to show the political
errors of both groups, not to say “You have been a bad boy” and
“You have been a good boy.” We have approached it from the
standpoint of showing that certain political mistakes were com-
mitted on both sides, that this side was responsible for this mistake,
and this side was responsible for the other mistake, that both sides
were responsible for joint mistakes etc. But insofar as the intensi-
fication of the factional struggle is concerned, this thesis is very
definite. Where it says: V

“The factional spirit prevailing in the League and Party

‘ and the misunderstanding of both groups regarding the deci-

sions of the VI World Congress led the Majority to take this

attitude which was the chief cause of the intensification of

the factional fight and consequently resulted in a tremendous
set-back to the entire League.”

And so comrades, what we are concerned with is not making,

arguments regarding 50% or any arithmetical arguments. We are
concerned with, and achieved it here in this Convention, that the
comrades who made the mistakes recognize them and what they
led to. On the basis of this unanimous thesis we consider that the
comrades have already recognized their errors and that the Con-
vention and the entire League will work unitedly as one organiza-

‘tion for carrying out the tasks that confront it.

Just one other point, and that is with regard to an argument
introduced in relation to Party and League relations. Comrades
say we have made political mistakes, but the whole trouble is the

wrong relations between the Party and League. We cannot accept A

this normal mechanical argument. The basic cause of the errors
was the weakness and "shortcomings, of. our leadership, which was
not successful in understanding and applying the correct political
line, and it was on the basis of political mistakes that incorrect rela-
tions between the Party and the League grew up. But you cannot
say that the relations between the Party and the League were incor-

«

 

 

- « 25
rect, and, therefore, we made mistakes. The questionvmust be put,
why were the relations incorrect? The answer must be made, be-
cause of the political mistakes and weakness of the leadership.
Comrades must not confuse this issue because in so doing they
make it more difficult to overcome the mistake.

In regard to the general problems. There is no necessity to
speak at length about the third period. I think that the report
made by Comrade Minor at the opening, of this convention gave
to you a picture of the situation in world capitalism at the present
time. I want only to emphasize this, that the basic question is to
get into the minds of the leadership in general, the clear under-
standing of the crisis, the general crisis of capitalism at the present
time. Because if we do not get that clear understanding, then, as
the Comintern Letter points out, we will distort the revolutionary
perspectives not only for Europe, but also for America. We will
continue to make mistakes of a Right character unless we get this
clear understanding. And in that connection I will quote the Open

~ Letter, because I think it is very well to popularize what is written

in this Open Letter. Unfortunately, the Open Letter is not yet suf-
ficiently well known in the Party and League. The Open Letter
says: .

“These mistakes reflect the failure to understand the fact
that the roots of the contemporary general crisis of capitalism,
side by side with the sharpening contradictions between the
development of the productive forces of the contraction of
markets, side by side with the existence and development of
the U.S.S.R. as a factor which revolutionizes the working class
of all countries and the toiling masses of the colonies, and

stands opposed to the worldcapitalist system, there is a1so_thei

unequal growth in the economic development of the various
countries which has its expression in the transference of the
economic center of capitalism from Europe to America and
the rapid development of American imperialism which sur-
passes the development of the other capitalist countries.

“The rapid development of American imperialism does not
exempt the United States, or any other capitalist country, from
the crisis; on the contrary it accentuates the general crisis of
capitalism as a result of the extreme sharpening of all contra-
dictions which it leads to. On the other hand a sharpening of
the general crisis of capitalism is to be expected not because
American imperialism ceases to develop, but on the contrary,
it is to be expected because American imperialism is developing
and surpasses the other tcapitalist countries in its development,
which leads to an extreme accentuation of all antagonisms.”

i . The Communist Party has accepted the line laid down- in the

Open Letter of the Comintern. The speeches that we have heard
today andduring the course of the Convention show that our

League members have accepted the Open Letter of the Comintern.

26

But, comrades, does that mean that now and in the future every-
thing in the garden is going to be lovely? It means, comrades, that
we have taken a big step forward in the development of the Com-
munist movement here, but we have to recognize that we are going
to be faced with tremendous difficulties in carrying out this line,
for the Party cannot overnight shed all of its errors and become
pure. When we come up against the facts of life in daily work,
we will have difficulties in applying the line laid down by the
Comintern. Only frank, open discussion in the Party, and not in
the groups, will help to solve the problems that are before us.

We must be on our guard against the many dangers, especially
from the Right, which will arise. We must remember that the
Party is not in a glass case, that it is subjected to the daily in-
fluences of a powerful reformist movement and the pressure of
the still~developing American imperialism. For example, we know
that in Soviet Russia many leading comrades have been hesitant
and doubtful regarding the carrying out of the policy of the last
Party Congress. In Russia the class struggle is still going on. The
pressure of anti-Soviet elements is felt also within the Party and
even on leading comrades.

The perspective that we have before us is a revolutionary one.
The class struggle is intensifying and a powerful revolutionary
wave is arising amongst the working class and toiling masses. The
trend of events since the 6th World Congress has brilliantly con-

" firmed the decisions of the Congress regarding the radicalization

of the masses and the growing precariousness of capitalist stabiliza-
tion. The working class is already passing over from the defensive
into an offensive struggle against the effects of capitalist rational-
ization. May Day 1929 brings the news that there were mass
demonstrations all over the world and that in Berlin, armed strug-
gles took place between the working class and the forces of the
state. The fact that the workers of Berlin are prepared to lay
down their lives in the class struggle shows how determined and
revolutionary they are becoming. The fact that the Comintcrn now
issues the slogan of “Long Live Soviet India” shows how the
revolutionary ferment amongst the Indian masses has developed
and that we now have the perspective of a fight for the setting up
of a Soviet government in that tremendous country.

It would be a terrible blunder to underestimate the seriousness
of the Crisis in which the world capitalist system finds itself. The
approaching economic crisis may cause a direct revolutionary situa-
tion in the immediate future in a number of advanced capitalist
countries. The danger is that we will not see this crisis and the
radicalization of the masses. We are in danger of being left behind
aiid not catching up with the forward movement of the working
c ass. .

This crisis of capitalism is made all the more intense because
of the fact that in this period it has led inevitably to the imminent

danger of a world imperialist War. That is the burning fact that
we must impress upon the masses. War is being prepared
against the Soviet Union. Great Britain in particular is feverishly
working for an anti-Soviet bloc. The preparations for war against
the Soviet Union, ‘however, do not soften the antagonisms between
Great Britain and America, which are becoming more and more
intensified. These great imperialist giants are preparing for a new
world war. The fight against the imperialist war preparations
must be linked up with the daily struggles against capitalist ration-
alization. Every blow that we strike against the capitalist class in
theworkshops is a blow against the war danger and the strengthen-
ing of the forces of the working class for the struggle against
imperialist war. We must utilize the everyday struggles to explain
to the young workers the war preparations of the capitalist ration-
alizers and how to fight these plans. This has been made clear in
the Open Letter of the Comintern. '
We now come to the tasks which confront the League in its
struggle against capitalist rationalization and the war danger.
The task of the League is to make a real turn towards mass
work, a complete break with the past and to develop into a mass
organization. For this every member must be mobilized. We will
not deal in detail with the tasks because they are dealt with in
detail in the thesis, and have already been spoken about sufficiently
in the Convention, and it is not necessary to repeat them. What we
must emphasize is that the League must take strong, energetic

~ measures to develop its mass activity and to really carry on a real

policy. In order to do this, it is necessary to radically change the
social composition. The thesis shows concretely how the League

. can achieve this task. This means the carrying out of the decisions

 

of the 5th World Congress of the Y.C.I. At this Congress, we laid
down what is called “the New Course.” We did not revise our
basic principles.

We did, however, show how it was possible, because of the
favorable objective situation, and because we had learned from
our errors in the past, to develop our Y.C.L.s into real mass
organizations of the youth, how they can develope various new

-methods of work and forms of organization in order that they

can become real leading mass organizations, instead of sectarian
bodies as many of them have been and are. The meaning of the
youth policy ‘is clearly explained in the thesis. These decisions
have a very special significance for the American League, as has
been pointed outin the reports and discussion. This is because of
the fact that the American League, when compared to all other
Leagues, is in a very special situation, because of its immigrant
narrowness, because of the factional struggle that has gone on so
long, and its very bad social composition.

We emphasize that in developing ‘the organization along mass
lines an essential problem is the economic trade union work, is the

daily struggle, the fight in the work shops,’ the building of an
organization on that basis, and an understanding of the problems
of the young workers. This is the main plank inlbuilding a mass
organization, the daily fight for the interests of the young workers
on the basis of clear immediate demands. In that connection, it is
well to mention the problem of work amongst the Negro youth.
We cannot develop into a mass organization unless we conduct
systematic activity amongst the Negro young workers and win
their confidence. This demands the.complete elimination of white
chauvinism from our ranks, which still exists in a widespread
form, sometimes openly but more often concealed.

What do we need in order to carry out these tasks? We need
a clear political line. We need a clear understanding of our next
tasks. We need a spirit of self—critical analysis of our mistakes
and our successes. Of course, all of these things are related to
one another, and we cannot take them separately. If we take the
thesis, we will find that this idea is expressed, that we have a
clear political line. We have a clear statement of our tasks and
we have made at this Convention a real beginning of self-criticism.
Every member of the organization must understand his responsi-
bility, must understand that he has got to ask himself, “What am I
doing? Am I doing everything I can, am I carrying out the
decisions P”, etc. ‘

This is what we want to introduce, the spirit of self-criticism, '

the spirit of co—operation with other members, and the smashing of
the factional attitude that existed in the past; to realize the
activization of every member, that every member has a part
to play in the ranks of the organization. I think, comrades, that
the discussion we have had so far has been in the main sound and

healthy. I think the discussion, moreover, has shown a fighting

spirit in the ranks of the Young Communist League. Of ’ course,
there have been weaknesses in the discussion. There has been in-
definiteness, a political weakness, etc. But we need not dwell upon
these because they are brought out in the thesis. The analysis
given by the thesis has been brought out in the discussion that has
taken place. The main _point to emphasize is that the discussion
has been healthy, the discussion has been constructive, that there
has been self-criticism, that there is not a tendency to over-estimate
the position of the League, and that this is especially good in view
of the fact that such a tendency did exist before the Convention.

Further, the discussion has brought forward many valuable
suggestions with regard to the improvement of the thesis, and I
think that in the Political Commission we will have to go into what
many of the comrades suggested to improve the thesis,

One or two questions have been raised, not exactly as disputes,
but on one or two points there have been arguments and comrades

have expressed varying opinions. First of all, this question of the.

influence of reformism amongst the youth. I think that all com-

 

 

 

” 29
rades are agreed that reformism, the reformist ideology, is the
greatest obstacle, is the biggest enemy that we have to fight in the
ranks of the working class, that these reformist ideas have a
powerful influence upon the young workers, despite the fact that
the reformist youth organizations are very small indeed. I think
we can take an example from Great Britain. There is a very

powerful Labor Party there, but the reformist youth organizations‘

are very weak and as such do not have a big influence over the
young workers, but nobody would be so foolish as to argue that
the young workers in Great Britain are not under the influence of
reformist ideas. In America‘ because of the powerful reformist
apparatus, particularly of the A.F. of L., reformist ideas are
strong amongst the young workers. .

Now as to the question of the bourgeois youth organizations
in relation to the reformist youth organizations. I do not think
we can answer this question by saying which organization is the
strongest. Unquestionably, as organizations, taking the membership,
etc., the bourgeois youth organizations are by far the stronger. But
if we consider the real danger, if we consider how are we going
to fight these bourgeois youth organizations we get up against the
fact that-in the main our fire has to be concentrated against
reformist ideas. We have to make the struggle against reformist
ideas the main thing in that fight. We know that as the young
workers become radicalized and take part in political activity
that it is just precisely at that time that the reformist youth or-
ganizations become active and utilize all of their methods in order
to draw the young workers away from the class struggle and the
A.F of L. becomes more aggressive and dangerous. I think on
this question we should have a paragraph in the thesis, because it

_is clear that it is not dealt with sufficiently. It is also necessary

to deal with the “left” leaders. At the same time we must empha-
size this, that the struggle against bourgeois youth organizations
must to be undertaken in a real organized form, that it is one

g of the big tasks of the League, and in that struggle we must pay
special attention in the struggle against reformist ideology in the-

ranks of the young workers.

Now, the question of Europe and America. The issue Europe
and America cannot be put in the form of America versus Europe,
because Europe is not a political economic entity. The sharpest
form of the struggle now is between American and,Great Britain,
both countries are maneuvering against one‘ another on the
European continent. This struggle is all the more complicated by
the struggle against the Soviet Union. They are both endeavoring
to win allies for the coming struggle. -Moreover, America does still
continue to play a definite part _in contributing towards the sta-
bilization of Europe, but at the same time it has been evident all
along that this part that America is playing in the stabilization of
European countries. is two-sided. There is another side to it and

30 ’

that is that the efforts to stabilize capitalism leads to greater in-
tensification of the contradictions. We see the situation at the
present time, is that America continues to play an important part
in the economic and political life of Europe, but that the partial

stabilization is becoming more and more undermined and pre- ,

carious, especially as the masses in Europe begin to play an active
part in the class struggle, actually coming on to the barricades into
a fight with the armed forces of the capitalist state.

The South has received considerable discussion during the
course of the Convention. We have made a new discovery and
found a strange country which we must devote very much attention
to. It is to be expected that in tackling this problem, which is so
new and difficult for us, that some wrong tendencies will be dis-
played. It will, however, be possible to find the correct policy
based on the needs of the situation, providing we discuss this
problem in the League leadership in a comradely manner. I want
only to emphasize that the main question and the fact which makes
such a marked difference between the North and the South, is
the Negro problem. So far we have been only on the fringes of
the Negro question, but now we are being brought up sharply
against the real difficulties and problems. The Negro question up
till now has been largely the writing of pamphlets and theses, but
now we are faced with the practical application ‘ of the correct
policy which has been laid down by the Comintern, and we must
be very careful and especially guard against the tendency to give
way before the powerful prejudices of the white workers.

The leadership of the League has been very heavily criticized
during the course of the Convention. The criticism was justified.
If you read the thesis presented by the N.E.C., you will find that
the criticism made there is not weaker than the criticism made in
the Convention. I want, however, to point out that one cannot
view the mistakes and weaknesses from departmental responsibility.
One cannot say this department is wrong, or this department has
not functioned, because if this is the case, then the responsibility
of the department not working properly rests upon the shoulders
of the N.E.C. as a whole.

The Open Letter of the Y.C.I. pointed out that the basic
weakness if the League is the weakness and shortcomings of the
leadership. That is the key problem that we have to face at this
Convention. We have to renew the leadership and to draw in new
proletarian elements in place of the oldcomrades. The entire
League must co-operate in the task of drawing in new elements from
top to bottom and must help the Y.C.I. to carry out its decisions
in this connection. If the Convention does not succeed in doing
this, then it will not be possible to carry out the decisions and we
will have wasted our time here. —

Many comrades have expressed doubts about the possibilities

of ending factionalism. Some are quite cynical. They think it is

quite impossible, they cannot see the possibility of having a League
in the United States which is not divided into two groups. They

imagine a unified league as being a wild romance, a figment of’

the imagination. We have no use for such members.

Some of the comrades, however, are rather dispirited. They
are not very enthusiastic over the possibilities of rooting the disease
of factionalism from the League. To all of these comrades I want
to say that none of us are so utopian as to believe that factionalism
will immediately disappear by the waving of a wand. It is going to
be very difficult to finally stamp out factionalism in the ranks of
the League. I have been asked by comrades, “How are you going
to get rid of factionalism ?” Some comrades seem to imagine that
there is some peculiar charm which will end all ills. I must say
that there is no golden road to the overcoming of factionalism, that
fine words are not the solution. It is no good saying: “You have
been a bad boy, now please be good boy.” The overcoming of
factionalism is a political problem of the first magnitude.

The thesis as a whole in the tasks that it sets to the League
points the road to the overcoming of the factional struggle. The
carrying out of the tasks set by the thesis demand:

(1) A new proletarian leadership throughout.
(2) A correct political line and critical attitude toward the

Party.
(3) ~A real turn to mass work and improvement of the
social composition. /

(4) Self-criticism from top to bottom.
(5) Unswerving loyalty to the Y.C.I.

(6) Breakup of all caucuses and the ruthless stamping out
of corrupt methods.

The carrying out of these points and the tasks set by the thesis
call for the ‘self—sacrificing activity of every member. They
demand the activization of the entire membership. The energy and
virility of the young workers must be mobilized. Under the leader-
ship of the Young Communist International, the American section
will be able to overcome the effects of its past mistakes and place
itself at the head of the American young workers in the struggle
against the war danger and capitalist rationalization and for the

overthrow of American Imperialism.

THE PRESENT SITUATION.

_ Approaching all our activities. from the present situation—a
period of war and increased rationalization, leading to decisive
sharpening class struggles and radicalization—it is imperative that
our League be rooted amongst the young workers (shops, mines)
and be the driving force in organizing the unorganized working
youth, championing their interests and taking leadership in the
ever growing class conflicts in the present period. _

The entrance of the youth into industry in large and decisive
numbers, has been further accentuated in the present period with
the introduction of intensified rationalization schemes in all in-
dustries. Today the weight of the workingyouth in industry is
not confined to the so called youth industries, but is increasing
decisively in numbers and influence in the basic industries. As-a
result of the brutal rationalization processes, the young workers
go thru, in an intensified form all of its effects (intensified ex-
ploitation, lower wages, longer hours, unemployment, deterioration
of the living, social and health standards, etc.) ’

As a result of this increased pressure on the working class,
we see a spontaneous wave of struggle in unorganized industries
throughout the country (auto, textile, shoe, steel, rubber, etc.) in-
volving mostly young workers. The outstanding characteristics of
these are, that they are “rationalization strikes” (called against the
effects of rationalization) which many times pass) over from a
defensive to an. offensive character. At the same time, the series
of strikes in “youth industries” although many times involving
small numbers (50—200 Perth, Amboy, Wiz Radio, Kay Mfg.,
Pittsburgh, Hammong, etc.) are growing. In all of these spontan-
eous struggles the young workers have been most active. In
those intlustries (mining, needle, textile) which have been going
thru a continued crisis for the past several years, which found
expression in the gigantic strike struggles (Passaic, New Bedford,
Fall River, Colorado, Pittsburgh, Ohio, Illinois, New York etc.)
out of which was laid the organizational foundations of the new
militant class industrial unions, the young workers played an im-
portant and leading role. This was particularly true in the textile
and mining, where the young workers were to be found in predo-
minence not only in the local activities, but in the district and
national leadership.

CONTRAST PAST WITI-I PRESENT.

At all past conventions, while emphasizing the importance of
T.U. activity and specifically the question of economic forms of

organizations for the working youth, our main orientation was
towards forcing the old A.F.L., to organize and accept the young
workers into its ranks. While pointing out the need for auxiliary
forms (clubs) these were never pushed sufficiently to the fore-
front, always having in mind that they were secondary to the bona
fide unions, and emphasizing their transition aspect rather than
organizatory aspect.

With the A.F.L. becoming ever narrower in scope, based
only on the labor aristocracy—having no desire and actually fight-
ing against organizing the unskilled and working youth, it soon
became obvious that to meet the present period of growing
struggles—to equip the workers’ organizationally to defend the
interests and fight the bosses, a new policy was necessary. The
A.F.L. is not only based exclusively on the labor aristocracy and
fights against the organization of the unskilled and semi skilled,
but today it is part and parcel of the war machine of the gov-
ernment and the bosses and serves as the instrument of the bosses

in fighting the workers interests, in spreading social reformist '

influence, of strike-breaking, of ballyhoeing for American impe-
rialism and war preparations and leading the struggle of Amer-
ican imperialism against the Soviet Union. The A.F.L. will not
organize the working youth. It will only betray them. Only the
Communists and the Left Wing militants can and will be the
driving force for organizing and leading the workers struggles.
In the present period our policy is to build up class industrial
unions, especially in the basic industries.

APPROACH TO ORGANIZING UNORGANIZED
YOUNG WORKERS. /

In order to successfully carry out our work, the following

must be clearly seen and understood:

, 1. We must see clearly that the process of the young work-
ers becoming the decisive factor in the mass of unskilled, coupled
with the intensified rationalization processes (arising from the
intensified and ripening internal and external contradictions of
American imperialism) at work amongst the working class and
particularly the youth has its direct consequence in a radicalization
process on a national scale. While this radicalization process
proceeds at an uneven tempo, it is not limited only to the so
called sick industries (mining, needle, textile) but applies to a
large number of basic industries, specifically amongst the un-
skilled and semi-skilled masses.

2. We must base our agitation on fighting against the
worsening of the conditions of the working youth, no matter how
detailed or minute these may be. At all times in struggle we
must be alert to turning these defensive struggles into offensive
struggles, and take the leadership in this turn and not find our-
selves at the tail end of the young workers.

Our whole struggle against the terrible destructive effects of
the ever increasing rationalization schemes must be based on a
program of demands which will rally the young workers in
struggle against these conditions. This program of demands must
be pushed to the forefront in all our activities and in all in-
dustries. It must concentrate on central basic issues. Such a
program of demands are:

Six hour day for young workers under 18 years. No
overtime.

2. Fourpweeks vacation'with pay each year.

3. Re-employment of all young unemployed and vocational
training and general education in factory schools for young work-
ers under 18 years at regular trade wages.

4. Unemployment relief and social insurance (exact demand
to be worked out). ‘ V

5. $20.00 minimum weekly wage for all young workers.

6. *Against the gang-system imitation of speed of belt—l5
minute rest intervals twice daily, etc.

While starting on the issues arising from the effects of
rationalization we must be quick to link these up with the
struggles against'the war danger and the other pertinent political
issues of the day, locally and nationally.

3. We must understand how to win the working youth on
the basis of youth issues-—-by issuing youth demands and fighting
to have these adopted in the economic organization of the working
youth. We must combat the theory that there are youth problems
only in certain industries. VVherever young workers are to be
found, there we will find youth problems if our League has its
ear to the ground and is alert to the moods and feelings of the
working youth. In some industries there is discrimination in
wages and hours and at the same j0b——in others, special types of
jobs with lower pay are given to the young workers—and in still
others, adults are constantly being replaced by young workers
who for the same or more work, receive less wages, etc. While
there are varied forms according to each industry, there is always
a youth problem. Our League must issue youth demands of an
economic, social and political charester and push these into the
forefront, working for their achievement. Especially must we
insist that the New Unions incorporate the youth demands as a
basis of settlement, and not considerxthem of a mere propaganda
character which don’t haveto be considered in making agreements
with the bosses. (Needle).

When issuing youth demands for specific shops, there is a
prevailing tendency in some League districts, to take a standard
set of youth demands and issue them for each shop, irrespective
of the different conditions. While there are some youth demands,
that is, our basic program of immediate demands as a League-
which should be propaganda everywhere and at all times, we must

learn- to formulate and issue specific youth demands affecting the
young workers in each shop according to the varying conditions
existing.

4. Our aim shall be to draft for each important industry a
program of youth demands. While beginnings have been made
(needle, textile, mining, etc.) they are as yet too general and not

concrete enough. At all times we must push in the forefront in '

addition to our program of youth demands for the specific in-
dustry, our entire program of social legislation for the youth.
We must combat ‘all theories that the young workers
economic organizations shall not be built up during and through
struggle (needle—Pittsburgh, later corrected here). During strikes
is one of the most favorable opportunities for organizing the
young workers either into Union, Youth Section or Shop Com-
mittees.
ORGANIZATIONAL APPROACH AND FORMS TO
REACH THE UNORGANIZED.

The main bulk of the working youth are to be found in the
unorganized industries (exceptions are few—Bldg., Printing, etc.)
The main task of the League is to organize the young workers
into the Left Wing Trade Unions and to form -Youth Sections
in these. Owing to special conditions, numerous occasions will
arise, where it will be necessary to adopt other special measures,
of a temporary character such as economic youth associations.

YOUTH SECTIONS.

We approach the problem of organizing Youth Sections and
establishing a youth apparatus, from the viewpoint—not of sepa-
ration but definitely for the purpose of serving as a means of
consolidation and strengthening the fighting bond between the
young and adult workers. The Youth Section constitutes an
apparatus of the respective unions for the recruiting and holding
of the young workers into‘ the union, though being alert to
catering and fighting for their every economic need. The purpose
of Youth Sections must be to organize and activitize young work-
ers—-to lead them in struggles—to fight‘ for their interests against
the bosses and at all times see their interests are protected by the
union—to draw them into active union work and leadership and in
this way to help the union in becoming a mass fighting organiza-
tion. All tendencies to_ consider the Y oath Section as a social
auxiliary must be combatted.__The Youth Sections is a fighting
instrument of the young workers in all their struggles.

Membership in the Youth Section automatically means mem-
bership in the Union with full rights. The Youth Section is not
a separate'organization—-it is a part of the union, but only sepa-

rate to the point of enabling the young workers to have an instru-

ment of their own, to discuss their problems and formulate their
fighting program and demands—-at the same time arranging such

specific activities (educational, sports, etc.) which are of a specific
interest to the youth.

All workers, young and old, belong to one union. All work- .

ers will attend and participate in the regular shop and local
union meetings with equal rights—voice and vote. In the shops
and mines, where the Youth Section is based, the Young Work-
ers are grouped together to handle their own problems. At these
shop meetings of the young workers, they shall discuss all their‘
own problems, formulate their grievances and demands. They
shall elected their own youth shop delegates to be included in the
general shop committees leadership. The holding of" separate
meetings of the young workers does not mean that they shall not
attend all general shop meetings. On the contrary, the meeting
of the Youth Section must stimulate them to do so. At the‘ gen-
eral shop meetings, the decisions of the Youth shall be reported
upon and dealt with and the Shop Committee (there is only one

shop committee with youth delegates as a part) must be charged.

with carrying out the decisions. The same general procedure

holds true for the meeting of the local unions and the relation-'

ship between the Youth Section and the local union.

The Youth Section is organizationally bound up with the
whole union machinery. There must be held regular meetings of
the Youth Sections and from time to time, delegates conference
of the young workers, called by the Union. The leading com-
mittees of the Youth Section while directing all youth work must
be under the general supervision of the G.E.B. There must be
established a youth apparatus in the Union from top to bottom.

‘The. basis of this is the Youth Section as already explained.

Linked up with this there must be:

1. Youth reps on all union Executive Boards from top to
bottom. — e I

2. Creation of a Youth sub-committee of the General and
District Executive Boards on which there shall be adult represen-
tation. These committees shall be the national or district direct-
ing bodies of all Union youth work. These sub-committees shall
endeavor to have a full time worker in charge of all youth work.

3. .T here shall be appointed special youth organizers who will
devote their activity to organizing the young workers and leading
their struggles. . . .

4. The union shall issue special youth material (leaflets,
papers, etc.) for org purposes as well as a Youth Section in all
the Union press.

5. The Youth Section shall work out directly appropriate
sports, educational and social activities.

6. Lower rates of dues and entrance fees shall be worked '

out based on wages of young workers.
The Youth Section must work out a program of youth
demands for its industry. The Youth Section must be a body

of action—a leader and fighter invthe class struggle, in the in-
terests of the young workers. All organizatorymethods, includ-
ing youth conferences, mass meetings, etc., shall be used. The
Youth Section shall be built up thru struggle. All tendencies
which hold that we must wait till after the struggle is over be-
fore building the Youth Sections must be rejected. Ideas that
we should not establish a local union consisting solely of young
workers, in those cases where adults will not join, are wrong.
In many cases the youth, because of their greater militancy will
take the initiative in launching the union. . .

Thru the efforts of the Y.C.L. there has been established, at
least in name, Youth Sections in the three new Industrial Unions,
Mining, Needle and Textile. An examination of these will show
that these exist only in skeleton in the mining and needle“ unions
and are non-existent in the Textile union. Even the existing
skeleton structures of the Youth Sections are limited only to one
or two cities and there is no functioning apparatus from top to
bottom. Experience has shown that while some of the adult work-
ers resist generally they can be convinced of the necessity of the
Youth apparatus. Agreat difficulty is to actually get consideration
from the Union that the Youth Section is of major importance as
an apparatus that will. build the union, recruit fighting elements
and provide new militant leadership. The Youth Sections them-
selves must proceed energetically with their tasks and demonstrate
to the Union and the adult workers the true role of the Youth
Sections.

The main tasks are to build the existing Youth Sections of
the Mining, Needle, and Textile Unions into mass fighting organs
of the young workers. In every other new union being organized
(shoe, restaurants, etc.) we shall immediately proceed to organize
Youth Sections as outlined in this resolution;

NEW UNIONS IN YOUTH INDUSTRY.

For the so called youth industries’ (electrical appliance, radio, I

paper box, etc.) where the big bulk’ are young workers, our
task ‘is toorganize new unions. These will not be youth_ unions,
but will include all workers in the industry. However, since the

_bulk will be young workers it will not be necessary to organize

Youth- Sections. The union must adopt special and necessary
methods to win the young workers of the industry. In cases
where helpers are excluded from the existing old unions (elect-
rical, plumber, painter, trades, etc.) our task must be to organize
new unions. These must be careful not to limit themselves to a
sectarian (activity but must include all workers old as well as
young. VVhere these unions are successfully built up locally, we
must aim at broadening them to a national base. Thus in the case
of Plumbers Helpers Union in New York, it should have been
activized as the leader and fighter of the interests of all the

plumbers helpers and this struggle should have been initiated in
all other cities so as to establish the union nationally. In all of
this work the Party must co-operate and give assistance.

OLD UNIONS.

Where there are existing A.F.L. or independent unions cover-
ing an industry and the Party policy is to work inside this union,
we shall endeavor to orientate the union to the importance of
fighting for the interests of the young workers and of organizing
them. In those old unions we shall strive thru our fractions to
establish Youth Sections and apparatus. These must serve as a
means of organizing the unorganized and also as an instrument
against the corrupt bureaucracy.

ECONOMIC YOUTH ASSOCIATIONS.

These special economic forms, young workers, clubs in shops
or they may be a grouping of young workers in one trade or
industry into a special economic association in one or more cities
(Plumbers Helpers). These economic youth associations are to
organize where no union exists or where the existing Trade
Unions do not admit young workers. These fight for the imme-
diate economic interests and needs of the young workers. These
associations serve as the basis’for new unions, youth sections in

‘ Unions or will result in inclusion into existing unions. These are

not be organized on a permanent basis, but to prepare the work-
ing youth for organization in the new unions. When transferred
into Unions these shall not be limited _to young workers only,
but shall include all the workers in the trade or industry. If it
is an industry (Youth industry) where the bulk of the workers
are youth, then its transformation will leave the young workers,
the dominant element. If in an , industry where the new Trade
Union Center is organizing a new industrial union, the economic
yputh association while being included shall held to lay the basis
for establishing a Youth Section, or if such exists, shall be in-
corporated into it.

THE WAVE OF STRUGGLES AND OUR
STRIKE TASKS.

An analysis of the present situation can only lead us to the
conclusion that the present strike wave presages a greater and
further extension of strikes, in which the young workers will
play an active role. This necessitates special emphasis being
given to our strike activity. Our experiences in strike work
have been quite rich and we must learn from these so as to be

’ a more decisive factor and gain greater results in the future.

It is of basic ‘importance that the greatest attention be given
to proper preparations for strikes. The Y.C.I. in a recent letter
states, “the tactic of reaching the masses of young workers
depends primarily on active preparation before the struggle”. This

- - vnw~—~

means that we must prepare the ground thru formulation of
specific demands concerning the burning grievances of the young
workers and conduct a barrage of propaganda thru individual
agitation, leaflets, shop papers, factory gate meetings, stickers, etc.
thus preparing the workers for strike action.

Out of everyone of these strikes, large or small, short or
lenghty, must result economic organization of the young workers
and also organization results for the Y.C.L. We must particu-
larly stress that the following "be done during strikes:

1. Popularization of youth demands. These should be popu-
larized by the Y.C.L. and adopted as far as possible by the Union
involved. The youth demands must be included in settlement.

2. Holding of young workers conferences.

3. Youth reps to be on all strike committees and special
youth strike committees.

4. Selection of special hall committees to recruit the young
worker for the Youth Sections. These must see that the halls

_ are attractive for the young strikers (while they are off the

picket line) by arranging for speakers, mass singing, wall papers,
banners, reading corners, etc. .
5. There must be a shock troop of young striker leaders,

acting on the picket line, serving as speakers, etc. Special forms,

of picketing of an attractive nature, involving young workers
must be adopted. During picketing, banners should be used and
copies of songs distributed, to pickets. Attempts should be made
to organize young workers correspondence clubs. Adequate leaf-
lets, factory papers and Young Workers must be distributed and
utilized.

6. . There must be held regular meeitngs, both by the Union
and by the Y.C.L. These should be of general character and
also daily factory gate meetings should be held at plants where
the workers are not on strike. 1

Wherever the strike is of sufficient duration we must
organize, similarly as we did with the Miners Strike, Young
Workers Relief Conferences. We should make every effort and
lay the greatest stress to get delegates to these conferences from

_ shops.

In connection with our strike activity, attention must be
given to agitation amongst the military, especially the National
Guard. Special leaflets and appeals must be issued and we must
encourage fraternization between the strikers and the N.G. We
must also utilize the strikers in connection with intensified cam-
paign against our opponent organizations (Boy Scouts, Y.M.C.A.,
etc.). Our experience has been that in nearly every strike the
youth organizers we send in are soon taken for general strike
activity, to the complete neglect of the young workers. This
must be remedied in the future. A sufficient cadre of youth

organizers must be retained for the important work amongst the

youth. A ' ' _ _
During all these struggles we must build the Y.C.L. Indi-

vidual and collective recruiting must be mtesified. All theories

of waiting till after the strike 1s_over, before building the League

must be combatted. We must aim at establishing shop nuclei in

ROLE OF THE Y.C.I.

In all forms of youth activity of an economic trade union
character (organize the unorganized, youth sections, new unions,
strikes, youth demands, etc.) the Y.C.L. must be THE DRIVING
FORCE. This necessitates that the entire League will be orien-
tated to the new situation (increased radicalization on a national
scale of the working youth and the will to struggle) and that the
new policies outlined here will be energetically carried thru. This
necessitates the rooting of our League in the basic industries and
large shops and the development of proletarian leadership who

I each of these places.

i will react to and understand the moods of the young workers.

In this present period of radicalization of the masses of work-
ers and particularly young workers, the A.F.L. and its ‘fake
progressive (Muste, Labor Colleges, etc.), will intensify their
activity in order to try and misdirect this leftward swing into the
opportunist channels of the A.F.L. and its_ lackeys. We must
wage an uncompromising fight against the Mustes and their asso-
ciates because they will play a most dangerous role in misleading
the young workers in the present situation. The League must
expose the Mustes, Labor Age, etc. who are now giving lip
service to organizing the youth, organizing labor education, etc.
and show their opposition to taking real steps to organize the
young workers (in 1928 Muste busted up a Youth Conference in
N .Y.C.) and their struggle against the new industrial unions who
are“ organizing the workers and fighting the capitalist agents,
Green, Will, Schlissinger, etc.

The present situation necessitates the fulfillment of the fol-
lowing tasks: - _

1. A full understanding of the necessity of untiring every-
day individual agitation amongst the young workers in the shops.
There is too much of a tendency of being a Young Communist
only at meetings and not in the shop. While skill must be em-
ployed in agitation, it is V our revolutionary duty to outwit the
bosses stool pigeons in the factories.

2. While more shop papers are issued today than previously,
this number cannot meet the demands of the present situation.
The number of shop papers must be decisively increased. These
must be of a lively character dealing principally with the situa-
tion of the shop, but always linking up in each bulletin the shop
struggles with some current political issue of interest to the young
workers.

3. The League must work out concrete youth? program for
each industry and popularize these.

4. The leadership of the League in organizing the unorgan-
ized can be especially established thru a widespread calling of
youth conferences. There must be called on a city and regional
scale, actually having their base in the workshops and laying the
basis of helping to build economic youth associations of the work-
ing youth. The present period offers the League better possi-
bilities then ever before for organizing successful youth confe-
rences. There has been insufficient efforts to utilize the present
situation to organize a series of wide youth conferences.

, 5. In every struggle the League must come forward not only
with its full program of youth demands, but with a concretization
of these in given situation. ‘

6. VVithin the unions and all these various economic organ-
izations, the directing hand of the _League can only be‘ felt through
the proper functioning of the Y.C.L. fractions. At present the
state of our fractions is scandalously weak. These must be
organized at once with regular meetings and they should be
given immediate directives from the League Executive bodies.
Especially necessary is it that a National policy be carried out
uniformly—this can only be done through a smooth functioning
series of Y.C.L. fractions in each industry.

7. Every Y.C.L. member must be a union member.

8. Thru building shop and mine nuclei and putting proleta-

rians into the leadership. from top to bottom.

STATUS OF LEAGUE ECONOMIC TRADE
UNION WORK.

In the present period of increased opportunities for activities
in the economic field our economic-trade union work has not been
satisfactory. Directives from the center has been insufficient.
For the entire first half of 1928 practically no Industrial Dept.
existed. In the latter half, the work was attended to by the-—
various comrades responsible, in too spasmodic a character. The
“slow” orientation and wrong estimation on the part of the“League
contributed much to the existing situation. The dilutin' of the

jproletarian composition of the League membership ound its

immediate effects in the weaking of the League E.T.U. activity.
In the latter months the factional struggle resulted in insufficient
.attention from the National Industrial Dept.- and a practically
total stoppage and failure to carry out by the districts these
directives that were sent from the N.E.C. (constant failure to
organize Youth Textile Conference in Dist. ~1—failure to organize
Youth Sections in Needle Trade» Union in Chicago, Boston and
'~Cleveland——insufficient attemps at organizing Youth Sections in
Mining Union in Pittsburgh, Chicago and Cleveland, etc.)

42

YOUTH DEPARTMENT -IN NEW TRADE UNION
" CENTER.-

As pointed out, the driving force of organizing the unorgan-

'ized will be the Communist and Left Wing. This necessitates

that the T.U.E.L. must have a Youth Dept. We must endeavor
to have all Youth Sections, economic youth associations, shop
committees, etc. affiliated to the T.U.E.L., thru its Youth Dept.
This Youth Dept. must direct the youth activities of all these
organizations. Special literature, organizers, etc. must be provided
by the T.U.E.L. for youth purposes.

TRADE UNION UNITY CONFERENCE.

The Trade Union Unity Conference, has as its purpose the
creation of one common Trade Union center for all class struggle
organizations; which shall unite all new unions, revolutionary
minorities in the old unions, and all movements for the organ-
izing the unorganized, shop committees, under a single direction.

We must recognize that in nearly all of past struggle we
have entered late or in very heat of the struggle, not having laid
the base for our strike activity and leadership through systematic
preliminary work. Another outstanding fact in connection with
our past strike activity, was the weakness of the participation and
leadership of our district organizations of the League. We can
therefore definitely state that because of the poor social com-
position of the District organizations we were not able to properly

organize and lead these struggles and sometimes the League
organization actually hindered these activities. The'results were.

that with the withdrawal of the national leadership sent in during
the strike the district organizations ‘were not able, due to the
condition and poor leadership, and the failure to develop activities
which would continue the traditions of struggle built up during
the strike, _to hold, the new members and in practically every case
a large section of the new recruits have dropped from the League
(Passaic, New Bedford, Pittsburgh, Illinois, Colorado, etc.) and
in some cases the League actually reverts to its previous bad
composition with practically none of the workers of the industry
which had been rife with strikes (Passaic) leadership, the poor
org. status and the old traditions, our district.

The program of the organization of this new Trade Union
Center must interest itself in a decisive way about organizing the
young workers and winning them for the Left Trade Union
movement. The main base of the new Unions, must be the un-
skilled and semi—skilled masses, where the young workers are to
be found exclusively.

Our immediate task is to have a substantial representation of
the working youth at the coming Trade Union Unity Conference.
The central feature of the Conference for us is what it raises
to the forefront the entire question of organizingﬂthe unorganized

working youth. Representation of the working youth at the Con-
ference can be secure through:

1. Youth Sections. /

2. Inclusion of youth delegates in all delegations from
A.F.L. independent unions. '

3. Through organized shop committees of young workers,
who will send delegates. ,

— Inclusive of youth delegates in shop delegation where
youth are not predominent.
Form all economic youth associations. ,

From all of these sources we must get the maximum number
of delegates. 1"

Especially must we concentrate in every district in organizing
shop committees especially in the large shops of young workers,
the basis of the program of the T.U.U.C.

Elections of delegates must not be a mere formal procedure
in any of these different organizations. It must be accompanied
by an energetic agitation amongst the broadest masses of the
working youth as to the purpose-and policies of the T.U.U.C.

’ In the League fractions we must see that there is held a
special youth conference where a report and all the-problems of
the working youth will be discussed. .

Resolution on Organization Work

Despite ,the fact that the League has increased numerically
and penetrated into new districts, the organizational weaknesses
are a very grave shortcoming. The directives contained in the
general Y.C.I. letters on organization work and those contained
in the special organization letters addressed to the American
League are still to be realized. These may be listed under the
following six general sub-divisions:

(1) Proletarianization and winning of Negro youth.

(2) Improvement of factory work and building of shop
nuclei, reorganization on this basis. _ .. '

(3) Improvement of work in trade unions and other mass

- organizations.

(4) Strengthening of League apparattis and overcoming of
membership fluctuation. ‘

(5) Enlivening the inner life of the League.

(6) Improvement of Party and"League relations.

NEGLECT OF ORGANIZATIONAL’ WORK.

The marked weakness of our League must be laid to the
fact that this important task is largely neglected. There is a
tendency throughout the League to substitute high-sounding poli-
tical phrases for concrete organization work. It is also true

\

44

thatin some districts discussion and understanding of the general
political line is almost entirely eliminated and activities are largely
confined to internal technical work. There has been considerable
numerical growth along partly wrong lines in some districts, and
complete organizational stagnation and even loss of strength in

other districts. For example, in some districts our growth has’

been largely the gaining of student elements and in others our
organizations have either stagnated _or lost strength. Another
contributing factor to the bad organizational position of the Lea-

gue has been the factional fight, which kept unfit comrades in

certain posts. Comrades were not always drawn into work on the
basis of their ability. This prevented the development of Amer-
ican proletarian elements, which resulted in the neglect of real
mass work for inner mobilization, and which encouraged concen-
tration on “record writing” rather than mass activity.

PROGRESS AND RETROGRESSION.

The period since the last convention has been marked by a
limited organizational improvement. This is shown by the in-
crease in members, the lower age level of the membership, in-
crease in American elements, and beginnings in youth sections,
better relations between the district and national committees, etc.
Against this, however, must be put the negative sides, namely, the
bad social and national composition of the League membership
both as regards proletarians and Negroes ,increase in percentage
of student elements, the failure to build shop nuclei and the disap-
pearance of those nuclei which have from time to time been
organized in the districts, the tremendous fluctuation, the poor
discipline and badly functioning apparatus and district short-
comings. Although there ,has been an actual increase in the
number of proletarian elements, which is an important step for-
Ward, nevertheless they constitute only 44% of the membership as
against 51% at the time of the 4th National Convention.

OVERCOMING POOR SOCIAL COMPOSITION.

The weakest point in the chain of League characteristics is its
social composition. Although there has been a slight improve-
ment in respect to the number’ of young Negro workers since the
last Convention, there has been a distinct worsening if we consider
the proletarian composition. _

I. There is too much of a tendency to explain our poor
social composition completely by objective difficulties (bourgeois
terror, large turnover of youth labor in plants, apathy of working
youth, too many small shops, etc.), when in, reality the main fault
lies in our own weakness and shortcomings as a League. The
‘primary tasks in overcoming the oor social composition are: (1)
Increase of factory work and bui ding of shop _nuclei. (2) Over-
coming the membership fluctuation. ” . ‘

II. Immediate possibilities for building shop nuclei exist:

 

 

._:’v-m‘-Ls.  ..-. ‘. . w  <x~.‘s;awa.;xu.-mg;  

 

45

(1) In those factories where we have one or more members work-

ing. (2) In those factories where the Party has a shop nucleus. ;

(3) Formation of mine nuclei in those towns where we have
young miners in the League.

THE MAIN PROBLEM IN OVERCOMING POOR
SOCIAL COMPOSITION.

The lack of shop nuclei and the poor factory work is the out-
standing proof of our sectarian character. During the period
since the reorganization there have been organized a considerable
number of factory nuclei all of which have disappeared. A» com-
paratively large number of factory papers have been begun, pub-
lished for a short time and then ceased to exist, without any
organizational result. Examination clearly shows that failure was
due to wrong methods of work among which the following are
outstanding: ‘

(1) Lack of apparatus for conducting shop nucleus work
(initiative groups, cadres of shop nucleus work instructors).

(2) Failure to follow the issuance of a shop paper with
organizational measures.

(3) Irresponsibility of comrades who leave shop where nuc-
leus is established," thus breaking it up. \

(4) Careless methods of work which resulted in having our
members fired. .

(5) Failure to follow the general Party and League program
in carrying on‘ organization work. Thus in districts where textiles
are concentrated, shop work is carried on in isolated factories or
those of very minor industries, and textiles is neglected. Simi-
larly for auto, mining, etc.

(6) Failure of the leading bodies (N.E.C., D.E.C.) to
concern themselves directly with helping shop nuclei when they
are organized instead of following usual administrative routine.

Against these shortcomings and mistakes we must take vigo-
rous measures which must consist of positive steps carrying out

. correct work. In addition to steps obviously suggested by the

above we also list the following: _ .
(a) Organizing and activizing initiative groups which should
be smaller in number of members but more trained and trusted

' comrades in those factories where we have one or two members.

working.

(b) The colonizing of comrades in certain factories- (parti-
cularly large plants of more important industries) in the districts
where they now live.

(c) Conference of comrades who are involved in the pub-
lishing of factory newspapers which shall include several adjacent
districts for exchange of experiences. .

_(cl) Raising question in Party factory nuclei in concrete
form so that youth nuclei may be formed. (For smaller Party

nuclei one comrade placed in charge of youth work in factory.
For large Party nucleus youth initiative group of Party shop
nucleus is to be organized.)

(e) Greater attention to factory towns. _

In connection with this work there is a tendency to neglect
the largest factories in the district simply because they are located
in the suburbs. The tendency is to concentrate on those factories
near the center of the city, which are smaller for obvious reasons.
This automatically influences our work in the direction of light
industry. These influences must be guarded against. _

During struggles we must build up the League on the basis
of shop nuclei from the beginning. Our most important new
experience in recruiting work have been in the strike movements,
New Bedford, Fall River, Miners’ Strike, Colorado, etc. These
experiences all point to the ease with which it is possible to
organize large numbers of young strikers into the League during
the period of the strike itself. It has also shown us that we have
not sufficiently improved our methods of work in regards to
holding these members after the strike is over. Thus we cannot
say that the organizational results in New Bedford and Fall River
were so much better than those in Passaic as would show a
significant improvement in our work.

The weaknesses which we have failed to overcome are:

(a) Failure to cement new recruits to League life closely
enough and to. popularize the shop nucleus basis of organization.

(b) Assumption that the new recruits can carry on by them-
selves and withdrawal of better trained forces who were brought
in during the strike.

(c) Failure to prepare the recruits during..the strike for the
different work which follows after the strike is over.

NEGRO WORK AND SOCIAL COMPOSITION.
The winning of the Negro youth is part of the prbolem of

social composition. Although the League now better understands,

the importance of this work it still does not understand how to

carry it on properly. In line with the general tasks outlined in ’

the political resolution on this question we propose the following
organizational measures:

(a) The increaseof inter—racial activities (forms, social af-
fairs, demonstrations, etc.).

(b) Increase of number of Negro students at all summer
schools and stipulation that each summer school must have at
least three Negro students.

(c) Begin the building of‘a southern district.

(d) Special recruiting in factories where Negroes are em-
ployed as well as work in Negro residential districts.

(e) Struggle against white chauvinism which expresses itself

47

in organizational work in such policies as special “Negro units”,

' etc.

(f) To enforce the functioning of Negro committees which
shall include leading white comrades and be assigned practical
concrete tasks.

OTHER MEASURES TO IMPROVE SOCIAL
COMPOSITION.

The League must take other practical measures to overcome
the shortcomings in its social composition. Especially during the
past period a number of problems have presented themselves in
this connection which must be solved.

(a) Young Pioneers who eventually become workers but who
at the same time of graduation into the League are students have
been transferred into the League in considerable numbers, thereby
diluting the proletarian composition of the League.

(b)' This must be regulated through regulating the gradua-
tion age level for students and thru the winning of better prole-
tarian elements into the Young Pioneers—-such as child laborers,
children of unskilled workers, etc.

(b) This Convention decides to abolish the reduction of dues
for students.

IMPROVEMENT OF WORK IN TRADE UNIONS AND‘
OTHER MASS ORGANIZATIONS.

In this respect the League has moved forward. The for- .

mation of youth sections especially in the new unions has given
better possibilities of work and though these possibilities are not
being sufficiently utilized, we can yet show progress. The greatest
weakness in this work is the chasm between the fractions which
tend to work in a haphazard fashion simply because the res-
ponsible League committees do not co-ordinate the work.

P Another weakness is the lack of functioning of League
fractions in neighborhood clubs and other mass organizations of
young workers, especially Negro organizations, sports organ-
izations, etc. The organization departments of every district must
take such measures as will systematically. penetrate these organ-
izations.

LEAGUE APPARATUS AND LEAGUE DISCIPLINE.

The League has a very large apparatus but most of it does

not function. A certain bureaucratic tendency can be noted in the 

creation of a large number of committees for various purposes
most of which never even meet. In the N.E.C. it is manifested

in the existence of a too large staff at the center. On the whole .

the organization work of the League has not been systematized.
The result is that in the absence of a central guiding line the
work becomes chaotic or non-existent. Even where work is done
it is largely the work of individuals and not of committees.

Introduction

The young American workers are today showing an increas-
ing readiness for struggle. This has been proven by their mili-
tancy in all recent strikes. Their radicalization also finds -ex-
pression in the growing number of youth strikes. Because of
their special position in rationalized industry the young workers
many times act as a lever in bringing adult workers into struggle.
In the youth departments and branches of industry the speed-up
is so great and the wages of the young workers so low that they
walk out ahead of the adult workers. The extreme effects of
capitalist rationalization on the young workers and their ever
more important role in rationalized industry causes them to play
a leading part in the wave of “rationalization” strikes unfolding
before us today.

At the same time that the American young workers feel so
acutely the effects of capitalist rationalization, there ‘hangs over
their heads the danger of the rapidly approaching wars which
threatens them most of all. International competition is sharpen-
ing, so the boss speeds up the young worker in order to better

' compete with his rivals on the foreign market. The greater speed

of work piles up more and more surplus capital and goods which
in turn sharpens the competition of the boss with his imperialist
rivals. The young workers caught in this vicious circle must
necessarily struggle together against capitalist rationalization and
imperialist war since he is the early victim of both, first as slave
and then as soldier.

The increasingly improtant role of the youth both in industry
and in relation to coming wars sharpens the struggle for the
winning of the young workers between the working class and the
employers. The most dangerous enemies of the young workers
in the struggle are the reformist agents of the boss-class which
attempt to dull their militancy and prevent their organization.
These are the misleaders of the A.F. of L.», of the Socialist Party
and the so-called progressive of the Muste variety who enter the
struggles of the young workers in order to betray them. The
bosses also spend millions of dollars each year in order to directly
corrupt the young workers through their large bourgeois youth
organizations, such as the Y.M.C.A. This makes it especially

~ necessary for the working class movement to increase its efforts

to win the working class youth and to sharpen its struggle against
the influence of reformist ideology upon the young workers.

The changed position of the youth in industry, the imminent
danger of war against the Soviet Union and between the impe-
rialists themselves, sets new tasks for the revolutionary youth move-
ment in the United States, which lent a special significance to the
5th National Convention of the Young Communist League. The

Thus every time a new comrade takes the work over he must
begin from the beginning and cover the same ground making the
same mistakes and gaining the same experiences that previous
comrades have. .

There is a general laziness in discipline and a certain irres-
ponsible attitude especially towards the center which has been
increased by the factional fight as expressed in the making of

exaggerated reports, failure to carry out decisions, etc. The-

letters of the Y.C.I. already set ‘certain tasks for the American
League towards solving these difficult problems, the premise for
which solution is the abolition of the factional fight. The treé
mendous expense involved in the calling of plenums or organ-
ization conferences makes it impossible to hold them in sufficient
frequency to guarantee proper work. The League must, there-
fore, introduce the practice of calling conferences of adjacent
districts with the N.E.C. representatives in order to properly ex-
change experiences frequently. In this connection the various
organization conferences which were held were a step forward
but full value was not gained fom them because they were not

followed up with necessary supplementary measures and the"

decisions of these conferences were allowed to be forgotten.

The organization letters sent out by the N.E.C. were also a
distinct step forward. These letters, however, were too topical
and did not have any systematic character. _ "

To improve the work for the next period certain new steps
must be taken in addition to correcting our past shortcomings.
The League has gained‘ sufficient experience both from its own
activities and those of the International to develop a text-book on

‘ organization work which should be taught in systematized fashion

in regular classes and summer schools. Every district should
endeavour to set up week-end organization conferences to meet
every two month or so. Each conference shall be in conjunction

with certain definite concrete tasks such as the various campaigns

that the N.E.C. decides upon. Representatives should be obtained
from out of town units and neighboring districts. The Party
Organizer, though published. irregularly, is yet very useful for
our program. Our column therefore must be re-established. Every
district (and not only the larger ones) must elect a district
organization head. _

The period between I.Y.D. and the 12th Anniversary of the
Revolution must be set aside for a special recruiting drive.

ENLIVENING OF THE INNER LIFE OF THE LEAGUE. ..

This is mainly a question for the agitprop work. There is
one phase of it, however, which belongs to the category of organ-
ization work. That is the improvement of comradely relations
and especially the winning of new proletarian recruits to the life
of the revolutionary youth movement. This can be organized

    

 

 

 

»,——,—,x.,;= K——,-:a—.»‘~..,..,,.—A-a».. 

49

. through personal propaganda, improved recruiting methods as

outlined in the Y.C.I. resolution, etc. The organization depart-
ments must make it a special task to cement to the League every
new member that joins our ranks, rather than as has been the
case to permit good proletarian comrades to drop out because they
could not understand our movement and no one took the trouble
to explain things to them. Through these membership committees
a great part of the fluctuation which we have experienced can be
overcome. -

CO-OPERATION WITH THE PARTY.

In the period after the fourth convention there has been an
improvement in our relations with the P_arty on the field of
organization work. There is better understanding on the part of
Party organizers as to the tasks of youth organizers in their
fields. The C.E.C. has given greater organizational support to
the Leagues than was given since the third convention.

Those great shortcomings which still exist, such as the failure
to begin the work of building youth nuclei where Party nuclei
exist, etc., must be overcome through carefully planned and syste-

matic work -along lines already indicated. Following the central‘

line in our organization work, that is,‘ priming our League for
more effective work among the young workers of the basic in-
dustries, through: V

(1) Proletarianizing and drawing in of larger numbers of
young Negro workers, our functioning cadres and membership,

(2) Through building factory nuclei and improving our
factory work generally, ,
_ _(3) Through strengthening our fractions in mass organ-
izations,

(4) Through establishing real Bolshevik discipline and im-
proving the quality and responsibility of our apparatus,

(5) Through winning our new recruits to the life of the
League, and

(6) Through further” improving our co-operation with the
Party, we can temper_our organization so that it can meet the
tasks that the proletarian revolution places upon us as the van-
guard of the masses of young workers and as the best fighters
that the Communist Party and the Comintern can command.

more favorable conditions for building the League made it pos-
sible for the Convention to mark a sharp turn along a new course
to mass activity. The carrying through of this new turn in deeds

. was guaranteed by the fact that the Convention was united on all

basic questions that faced it with the help of our international
leadership, the Communist International and the Young Com-
munist International. By making our political line that of the
Comintern we went a step further than any previous Convention
in guarding ourselves against those right wing tendencies which
attempt to obscure the sharpening class struggles of the present
period, under-estimating imperialist contradictions and the im-
minency of war. -

Our 5th National Convention cleared the way for this new
course to mass activity by dealing in the sharpest manner possible
with unprincipled factionalism which has so long been a.break
on the development of our movement in the United States. Since
the conclusion of our Convention the Communist International has
sent an open Address to the membership of the Communist Party
U.S.A., demanding an end to factional methods and factional
groupings in the Party and proposing measures for the strengthen-
ing of the movement ideologically and organizationally to meet
the gigantic tasks of today. These decisions of our \/Vorld Party
have had the great significance for the League in the carrying
through of our own Convention decisions. At the same time the
membership of the League has been better able to understand the
Address as a result of its Convention. This is being proved in
the more rapid carrying through of our Convention tasks and the
unreserved support of the League in the struggle for a correct
line for our movement and the working class in the United States.

The thesis and resolutions of our Convention, which are being
printed here for the first time, speak for themselves in outlining

the course we must travel to a mass Young Communist League _

and Communist Party in the United States. This course is not
an easy one, but it is the only course in the interest of the
workers and their struggles guaranteeing their final victory over
the capitalist system which so heavily oppresses them today. This
pamphlet deserves, therefore, the closest study by every member
of the Young Communist League and every class conscious young
worker. It also deserves attention from Party members and adult
workers who wish to play their part in winning the youth for the
struggle against capitalist rationalization and imperialist war in
both of which they’ play such an increasingly important role.

Thesis on the Tasks of the C.Y.L.—U.S\.A.

1.‘ The present stage of capitalism, characterized by the VI
World Congress of the C.I. as the third period, is marked by a
growth of capitalist economy, exceeding the pre-war level, growth
of the socialist economy in the U-.S.S.R. and an intense develop-
ment of the contradictions of World Capitalism, giving rise to the
deadly danger of new imperialist wars—imperialist wars against
the U.S.S.R., among the imperialist states themselves, national
liberation wars against imperialism and gigantic class battles. The
growing pressure on the working class (speed-up, wage cuts, un—
employment, etc.) as a result of these contradictions is driving
them to the Left so that the new period is marked by great mass
struggles, in which the working class is assuming the offensive,
and which are intensifying the internal antagonism in the capitalist
countries.

All of these factors are leading to cap_italist stabilization be-
coming still more precarious and to the severe intensification of
the general crisis of capitalism. This estimation of the VI World
Congress has been brilliantly confirmed by the trend of events
since. The growing contradictions between Britain and America,
new‘ steps for strengthening the Anti—Soviet bloc, international
strike wave, bitter struggle of Indian masses against British im-
perialism. Special emphasis must be laid on the growing radicaliza-
tion of the working class (Lodz, Ruhr, 'etc.), and the growth of the
revolutionary forces in the ranks of the working class movement.

2. The building of socialism in the Soviet Union intensifies
the crisis of capitalist economy and also rallies the oppressed masses
in the colonies and capitalist countries around the proletarian state.
Consequently the imperialist powers are feverishly preparing.a
counter-revolutionary bloc against the U.S.S.R. The working class
is faced with the imminent danger of an imperialist war against the
Soviet Union. At the same time there is also the danger of a new
open imperialist war against the Chinese Revolution.

3. The transference of the economic center of capitalism from
Europe to America and the rapid development of American im-
perialism expresses the unequal growth of the economic develop-
ment of the various countries, which far from exempting the
U.S.A. from the general crisis of capitalism draws it more and
more into the. vortex of the developing contradictions of the world
capitalist system and leads to the crisis of American imperialism.
VVhile the penetration of Europe by American capital is continuing
the partial stabilization in Europe which was carried thru with
the assistance of American capital, far from “putting Europe on
rations,” has developed the competitive forces of Europe, placed
new obstacles in the way of American expansion and heightened
the struggle among the capitalist powers.

 

 

6 i

_ 4. The United States is showing a greater aggressiveness in
the struggle for markets and the most important sources of raw
material. In particular, the disparity between the enormous pro~
ductive powers of American imperialism, between its tremendous
foreign trade and the large supply of investible capital, on the one
hand, and its relatively small colonial possessions on the other,
brings it into sharp antagonism with the gigantic colonial monopoly
of British imperialism which is in a process of decline. The danger

of a new imperialist war centers around the struggle between the.

two imperialist giants for world hegemony.

“The striving towards domination in world politics drives
American imperialism, on the one hand, towards brutual ca-
pitalist rationalization which throws considerable section of the
proletariat out of production, leads to an extreme overstrain of

V labor without corresponding compensations, to a colossal
growth of unempolyment (3-4 million) and to a general wor~
sening of the conditions of the working class. On the other

’ hand, it leads towards tremendous growth of armament which
put ever heavier burdens onto the shoulders of the toiling
masses. All this and the menace of the terrific calamities of
war creates a state of uncertainty and insecurity in the entire
working class. It is on this basis that the tendency towards
radicalization of the American working class is increasing;
that its activities, its will do defend itself, which in some places
transforms itself into a will to assume the offensive, is develop-
ing. This drift towards the Left does not develop evenly in
all parts of the working class. It now embraces chiefly the
unorganized workers, especially in those industries which have
not reached their previous level after the depression of the first
half of 1928.” (Open Letter Comintern.) .

5. The Open Letter of the C.I. corrected the mistakes and
severely criticized the weaknesses and shortcomings of the Com-
munist Party of the U.S.A. It gave a correct revolutionary per-

spective to our Party and laid down in unmistakable terms the path V

which the Party must ‘follow in its development from a numerically

small propagandist organization into a mass Communist Party and _

leader of the American proletariat. The stalwart leadership which
the Party gave the working class in a number of fierce class battles
shows that it is beginning to turn into a mass Party of political
action, that it is making the first step on the new path, although
it has not yet passed the turning point. The Young Communist
League of the U.S.A. is in wholehearted agreement with the deci-
sions of the VI World Congress and their application to America
as expressed in the Open Letter and organizational proposals.
Every member of the Y.C.L. must. closely study this Open Letter.
The unreserved carrying out of these decisions‘ is the only way
to prepare the Communist Party and Y.C.L. for the great class
conflicts which are arising.

6. The mistakes and shortcomings of theParty were reflected
in the League which was also rent by factional strife. The Major-
ity and Minority groups carried ’over into the League the political
errors of the respective Party groups with the result that the dev-
elopment of the League was impeded. Both groups made the basic
error of failing to understand the nature of the general crisis of
American capitalism which “inevitably leads to a distortion of the
entire revolutionary perspective outlined in the decisions of _the VI
World Congress in connection with the third period.” The Major-
ity, by declaring that the Right danger was represented sharply by
Trotskyism, blurred over the difference between the out—and—out
Right wing opportunist deviation and Trotskyism, which is oppor-
tunism disguised with Left phrases. This mistake was an under-
estimation of the main danger—the Right danger, thereby weakening
the struggle against it. The Minority, whilst stating that the main
danger is the Right danger, under—estimated the seriousness of
Trotskyism (the significance of Cannon’s alliance with extreme
Right wing elements), failed to differentiate between the Right
danger and the ultra-Left phrases and approach of Cannon, and
consequently did not understand how to unmask Cannon’s “Left”
phrases. Both groups under—estimated the effects of the technical
developments and rationalization on the working class and the
youth and failed to see the importance and political significance of
linking up the struggle against the effects of capitalist rationaliza-
tion with the struggle against the war danger.

7. The chief danger in the Comintern is the Right danger,

which together with the conciliatory tendency towards it must be _

strenously combatted. The Y.C.L. is in wholehearted agreement
with the decisions of the C.I. in the struggle against the Right dan-
ger and conciliation, and, in particular, with the steps taken by the
Communist Parties of the Soviet Union and Germany in this strug-
gle. The growing economic power of American imperialism and
the tenacity of reformism, the role of the A.F.L. as an agency of

the bourgeoisie in the working class, give rise to the most serious .

danger of the development of a strong Right wing tendency in the
American Party. The Party has committed _a whole series of Right
mistakes for which the Party as a whole is responsible and in which
the N.E.C. of the League shared.

8. The National Convention of the Y.C.L. declares its full
agreement with the Comintern’s Open Letter of which the organiza-
tional proposals are an essential part. The League representative
in the Polcom and the Majority of the League delegation in the
Party Convention made a mistake in expressing opposition to some
of the organizational proposals.

It is the task of the members of the Y.C.L. to adopt a critical
attitude to the work of the Party including the Convention provid-
ing this is not done from a factional standpoint. The Convention
greets the fact that the Party Convention dealt with such questions
