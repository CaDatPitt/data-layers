Only three years have passed since the imperialists ﬁnished S

the last slaughter.

And now they are drafting the youth for another.
Militarism is becoming entrenched in America‘.

. ‘Militarism —— so long synonomous with goose-stepping
Prussianism——is now to be made synonomous with Americanism,
if Big Business has its way. ' . .

A large section of the sturdy immigrants who helped to

build this'country came here to escape militarism. Now their

randsons face the same brutal re imentation here.

All this is partand parcel of the development of capitalism A

——the system which puts proﬁts above all other considerations. A

The capitalist system has long outlived its usefulness.

Capitalism offers no future to the people but depressions,
imperialist wars, fascism, universal violence and a ﬁnal plunge
into barbarism. -

To avoid such a fate, the workers of the United Statesrnust

go into politics on their own account, independent of all capitalist

politics. They must take wer, establish a Workers and Farm-
ers Government, and reo ganize the economy of the country on
a socialist b.asis. .

Socialist economy in the United States, eliminating capital-
istwars, proﬁts and waste, will begso‘ productive as to ensure
a rich ‘living for all who are willing and able to work,‘ and
provide security and ample means for the aged and inﬁrm.

We should also help the hungry people of the world to —.

improve their standard of life.
Socialist America will rapidly make that possible by helping
them to secure their own freedom and develop their own economy.
Eventually, the economy of the entire world will be united
and planned on a socialist basis. . .
This will bring universal peace—and undreamed of abun-
dance for all people everywhere.
The real upward march of humanity will begin.

The American working class can open up the way to this p

new world. ‘
They are the majority.
They have the power in America.
All that is necessary is for the working class to understand

rit——and to use it.

is ‘ ’We‘ﬁrmly believe they will do so. _
Weﬁrinly believe the real America——the America of the
workers, the people——will help save the world by saving herself.
We, the American Trotskyists-—we, the National Conven-
tion of the Socialist Workers Party, summon our America to her
great destiny-—not as conqueror but as liberator of the world.

\ Capitol and Labor
inl948  

‘ BY FARRELL DOBBS

Speech of the Socialist Workers Party candidate for President,_
broadcast over a nation-wide network by the American Broadcasting
System on May 29, 1948., .

The unceasing war between labor and capital is the out-
standing issue of this election campaign. This is well understood

by the rich, and they determine their politics accordingly. It is

not fully understood by the great mass of the working people.

' Yet this conﬂict of capital and labor has been greatly intensiﬁed

during the past year. T t

The employing class, aided and abetted at every turn ‘by.

the government at Washington, has been conducting a furious
offensive against the workers. Their object is to beat down liv-
ing standards, and make the workers pay for the Third World
War. They aimgto break up the trade unions and impose upon
the people of this country a military and police dictatorship.

At the very start of our analysis we must begin with incon- .

testable facts. The anti-labor offensive of the employers and the
government has scored numerous successes during the past year
or so. -Due to the false policy of the union leadership the workers.
haveTsuﬂ‘ered ‘a number of serious defeats on the political as well
as the economic ﬁeld. The danger of still greater defeats and
even catastrophies for the workers of America is inherent in the

-present‘ drift of things.

 

Let us review in brief the price that the workers have al-
ready paid in the last year or so for tolerating the misleadership
of the’ present labor ofﬁcialdom and the false policy that is im-
posed upon the unions.

Labor's purchasing power has been driven down 15 percent
since V—J Day. At the same time, corporation profits have soared
to unprecedented billions of dollars.

_ Concessions to the unionsare bitterly resisted. The steel;  H
trust rewarded the n0~strike pledge of Philip Murray, president .

of the Steel Workers Union, with a cynical refusalto‘ grant any
cost-of-living wage increases whatever. Henry. Ford All has even
had the gall to demand that the Ford workers take a wage cut.

Today Congress works directly from the blueprint laid’ out
by the National Association of Manufacturers. Price controls

.11

were obediently smashed and taxes reduced for the rich when -

the- NAM cracked the whip. With the corporation heads dio-

tating policy, the Washington government enacted the Taft-.

Hartley Slave Labor Law, a dagger aimed at the very heart
of the trade union_ movement. . *

The Taft-Hartley Act fosters company unions, legalizes
scabbing,i,sanctions the ﬁring of unionmembers and restores
government by injunction. It restricts freedom .of speech and
freedom of‘ press, entangles the unions in a maze of red tape and
proscribes political activity by the unions.

Under the Taft-Hartley Act, the National Labor Relations
Board operates openly as anagent of the employers, as it did
when it obtained injunctions against the Typographical Union.

The Democratic and Republican politicians in the state
capitals have not lagged behind their Washington cousins. Wide-
spread state legislation has been adopted restricting the right
to strike and picket, undermining union_ security in collective
bargaining agreements. and interfering in the internal affairs
of the unions. These repressive laws have been passed not only
in agricultural states, but even in major industrial states like
Michigan and Pennsylvania. e ‘R

The Democrats are_ no less guilty than the Republicans .for'

the bitter governmental attack on the unions. President Truman

has dragged the coal miners into court three times in 18 months i

in strikebreaking assaults against them. Truman has twice used

» the army to break strikes of the railroad workers. The President

has been eagerly assisted by Judge T. Alan Goldsborough. Judge
Goldsborough -— one man —— proclaims, "I am the law.” This
one man vetoes the will of 600,000 coal miners, tens of thousands
of railroad workers, and ultimately, the will of ‘ 15 million or-
ganized workers. . ,
The Republican Governors of Iowa and Minnesota called

. out the National Guard to break up picket lines of the packing-

house workers, ﬁghting in self—defense against the greedy meat
trust, New York City’s Democratic Mayor William O’Dwyer
sent his cops into Wall Street to club the striking AFL ﬁnancial
employes away from the doors of the stock exchange.

Strikebreaking is the one ﬁeld in which government mono- A

poly is replacing “free enterprise.” The bi-partisan coalition of

____Democratic and Republican politicians are in the strikebreaking

bus‘in’essp.up to their necks. ,
Whatlare the ofﬁcial labor leaders doing about it?
Instead of mobilizing the workers for defensive battle, they
have retreated before the corporations and thegovernment. They
have tried» to buy friendliness in the circles of wealth and state

powerby so—called “labor statesmanship."

12

‘C10 and AFL ofﬁcials alike eagerly support the Marshall

Plan. Both unions have sent representatives abroad" to sell the
program of Wall Street imperialism. They have stood as apolog-

Lists for the bloodthirsty monarchist government in Greece -—
T a government which decreed the death penalty for strikers.

- ' Two weeks ago, Philip Murray rammed through the con- ' '

vention of the CIO Steel Workers Union a resolution empower-
ing Murray to decide union policy on peacetime military con-
scription. This undemocratic procedure is nothing but prep-
aration to capitulate to brass-hat demands for the prussianiza-
tion of American. youth. . .

When the union rank and ﬁle tried to mobilize last year to
block passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, the “labor statesmen”

sabotaged the struggle. Then they capitulated to the Slave Labor .

Law by rushing to sign the “yellow dog” afﬁdavits.

The top union officials, servile and cowardly before the-

enemies of labor, are very tough against the militant union mem-
bers who want to ﬁght back against the union-busters. Govern-

ment-inspired red-baiting is today running wild in the unions,

led and encouraged by the top officials. Democracy in the unions
is under attack because the leaders are acting against the inter-

ests of the rank and ﬁle. They dare not permit freedom of dis- .

cussion and criticism.

Packinghouse Defeat a Warning

The defeat of the packinghouse workers’ strike is an ominous

. warning that the union ofﬁcialdom is following a fatal course.
y it is a crime against all organized labor that the packinghouse

workers were left isolated and unaided, while the meat trust
starved them out, and the courts, police and National Guard
broke up their picket lines.

This grim lesson has not caused the union ofﬁcials to change
their course. On the contrary, they cling tighter than ever to the
skirts; of the capitalist politicians; They strive desperately to

breathe new life into the Democratic Party, while they cynically '
- tell workers who want to build an independent labor party,-

“Now is not the time."

Thanks to the spineless-union officials, the night-riders of.

reaction seem to have everything their own way. But the rank

_and ﬁle of the unions have not yet said their last word. They”

want to ﬁght and they know how to ﬁght. That Wasiﬁrrnly
proven after V-] Day when the great troop demonstrations from
Berlin to Tokio forced the brass hats to bring the veterans home;

A when four million embattled workers forced the monopoly cor-

porations to grant wage increases; when veterans, industrial
workers, white-collar workers and the middle classes united solidly

v18

and Victoriously against their common enemy, America's, Sixty

Richest Families. _ ‘ . i
The basic reason for the present frustration of the workers

in their efforts to smash the anti-labor offensive can be stated

S‘ simply and correctly as follows:

jThe exploiters of labor are conscious of their class inter-
est." They are united in the ﬁght against the workers. And they
have the governmentalpower on their side. The basic weak-
ness of the workers in the capital-labor war as it stands today
is to be found in the union leadership and their false policy.

_ Instead of recognizing that the conﬂict between labor and capital T ‘

is irreconcilable, the labor leaders preach the ridiculous idea
of the brotherhood of labor and capital and the identity’ of their

interests — a formula which causes the most raucous laughter-

in the councils of the rich.‘ Instead of recognizing that the
workers can never get a fair deal from government until they

set up a government of their own, the labor leaders restrain and A

sabotage every movement of the rank and ﬁle to set up their
own political party, which would aim at the formation of a
workers government. They support the imperialistic government
of the capitalists in its monstrous program to enslave the whole

‘ world. They act in effect as agents of the capitalistruling class _ ,

in the ranks of the workers.

The retreat of the labor movement must be halted. The
-rank and .ﬁle of the workers must recognize the reality of the
war. of capital’ and labor and create within the labor movement
a new policy and a new leadership corresponding to this reality.

Twelveyears ago, when the workers in basic industry were
beginning to organize their industrial unions, they soon found
that the ‘old Al?L leaders were not an aid, but an obstacle to
the campaignflt was necessary to thrust aside the old leaders
and raise up new, young leaders from the ranks.

Today organized labor is compelled to take the road of

independent political action. Capitalism must be fought ‘and .

defeated on the political as well as the economic field. For
that task, leaders of broad vision are needed; leaders like Eugene
V. Debs, Big Bill Haywood and Albert Parsons; leaders who
can tell one class from another in present class society‘.

Workers of America! Close your ranks against the union

‘ busters! Defend democracy in your unions! Seek out the able

young mentand women in your ranks who can lead you with a
correctprogram.~.Combine your economic struggles on the picket
line with independent labor political action. V

_ Unite with the Socialist Workers Party to rid America of
the plague of capitalism with its wars and depressions‘ Build a
socialist party of peace, freedom and plenty! .

Why American Workers
Need (1 Labor Party  

BY F ARRELLQ DOBBS

Speech of the Socialist Workers Party candidate for President,
broadcast over a nation-wide network by the Columbia Broadcasting
System on July 6, 1948. A
Working People of America.‘

In recent years it has become more and more difficult to

tell a Democratic politician from a Republican. Together they -

have knifed every proposal for social 1egislation——from anti-
lynch and anti—poll-tax bill to minimum wage raises and housing
appropriations. The Republicans and Democrats teamed up to
pass the Taft—Hartley Act, and they are now devising even more
deadly weapons to be used against the unions after the elections.

Now, for a few. months before the elections, these twin _

servants of monopoly capitalism are staging their customary
quarrel over the political swag at Washington.

Truman charges: “This Congress is the worst we’ve had
since the first one met.” '

Halleck, Republican leader of the ‘House, snaps back:
“There are a lot of people who think  Truman is the poorest
President we have had.”  L

’ Both politicians are telling the truth. Many millions are
agreed that both the Democrats and Republicans ought to be
thrown out of ofﬁce. People are turning away in revulsion from
these discredited parties and are looking for a new party.

More than that. The wor_king people of this country are
looking for a new kind of party. They want a party they can

‘control and call their own; a party that will advance the cause

of the workers, and not deceive and degrade labor for the beneﬁt
of the proﬁteers. V

Labor Party Would Get Response  .

Never were conditions more favorable for the launching of
a national Labor Party. This party would command immediate
response from 15 million unionists and their families, who
represent the mightiest organized force in this country. lt
would arouse the hopes of unorganized workers, who stand to

15

gain from every advance by ,the unions._ The Labor Party could a

count on firm support from the Negro people, who already regard
the CIO as their main ally in the ﬁght against ‘discrimination.

The nation’s youth, who are_being groomed for another ‘im=V-“'

perialist slaughter, and the working farmers, disillusioned with
the capitalist parties, would rally to the Labor Party.

An independent party launched by the unions will chal- T

lenge and displace both the Democrats and Republicans and
will become ‘the foremost party in the land. ‘

Will Act for the People

In ofﬁce this party of labor will legislate and act for the
people, not for a few plutocrats. It will pursue a policy of
genuine aidjand friendship toward the workers and colonial

peoples in the rest: of the world, instead of menacing them with ~ ~
‘ atom bombs.

The Socialist Workers Party would support such a party

launched by the unions. We would advocate that our program .

be made the program of the Labor Party.

However, the top union ofﬁcials have blocked this path
for 1948. These pygmies in politics cling desperately to the
corrupt two-party system, hoping by some miracle to ﬁnd a
candidate they can palm off on the workers as a “friend of
labor.”

The failure of the union officials‘ to launch a Labor Party

3

has enabled’ Henry Wallace to come forward as a self—styled .

champion of ‘labor in thispresidential campaign. Many who

are fed up with the two old—line parties are inclined to believe,
or at least hope, that Wallace's party will answer their demands.

Wallace-—who for the last 15 years has played the game
of capitalist politics-—now sets himself up as a new political

Messiah. Let us review his record, and then examine his pro- if

grain, to see whether hisnew party deserves support.

As Secretary of Agrivculture, Wallace, who today promises
abundance, was responsible for destroying pigs and ploughing

under cotton while millions of his countrymen went hungry .

and ill-clad:
As Vice-President, this “crusader for peace” peddled the

’ ’ imperialist lie that American participation in the Second World.
‘War would‘ make the “Four Freedoms” prevail and establish
' the “Century of._the Common Man.” Now Wallace himself

admits that the billionaires and brass hats are using the military
victory to undermine the freedom of the people.

As. Secretary of Commerce, he gave silent consent to,

_..!.I

.4

‘Truman’s strike—breaking actions against the miners and’ rail-'

road workers. _ A
Wallace parades as a champion of the Negro people. What

struggle for Negro rights did he lead while in high‘ office?-A‘
Wallace didn’t even dare oppose jim Crow practices in the ‘

Commerce Department in Washington, which he was supposed
to be_running. _ _ ,

Wallace pretends to be leading a ﬁght against war._He
seeks to mislead the people with the ﬁction that the United

~ Nations can protect the peace.

The United) Nations can no more be relied upon to prevent
war than the dead and buried League of Nations it has replaced.
The United Nations is not an agency for peace. It is a front
organization for American imperialism. Its function is to
furnish the diplomatic ballyhoo for a’ third world war. -

Wallace knows that. So do the Communist Party traitors '

to the working class, who support this Wallace swindle.

The truth is that the ﬁght for peace is inseparable from
the ﬁght against the capitalist system, which needs and breeds
war for proﬁt. Peace can be achieved only by rallying the people
of this country in struggle against the ruling capitalists to take
the powers of life and death outiof their hands.

Wallace cannot lead the American people in a genuine anti-
war struggle, because he is committed body and soul to the

‘preservation of the capitalist system. He has already" served

notice in theipress that, once war is declared, he will climb on
the military bandwagon. He’s not an anti-war ﬁghter to the
last ditch—but only until the ﬁrst shot is ﬁred!

Need Party ‘They Can Trust

This third party bossed by millionaire Wallace, who declares
that he is “the best friend capitalism has in the United States
today,” is surely not the kind of party American labor wants.
The workers need a party of their own, a party they can trust
to protect their welfare without compromise or betrayal.

I am conﬁdent that the working people will ﬁnd the Socialist
Workers Party to be the kind of party they are seeking. The
Socialist Workers Party is as different from the capitalist parties

as day is from night. 4 A
Our members are almost all workers, housewives and young   

  

people. We welcome men and women of all colors and nation-
alities into our ranks on an equal basis.. ‘
You will meet members of the Socialist Workers Party

wherever the going is tough, wherever extra energy and devotion ’

are needed todefendlabor against the employers.

‘ dimes and dollars. No bankersor corporation paymasters give

us funds the way they ﬁnance the Republicans and Democrats.

Our aims are the most realistic and at the same time the
most noble a working class party can have. ’ .

That is why I have proudly accepted the~Socialist Workers

— Party nomination for the presidency.

Workers and Farmers Governrment

The Socialist Workers Party is irreconcilably opposed to‘

the war plans of American monopoly capitalism and its political

stooges in Washington. lts candidates are pledged to Oppose.

Plan, and to ﬁght every measure aimed against the civil rights

.The Marshall Plan and the Taft-Hartley Act are but two
sides of the same capitalist coin. The Marshall Plan is intended

to ﬁnance police regimes for the suppression of labor abroad, L

just as the Taft-Hartley Act is used to break strikes here.

So long as capitalism endures, hunger, police violence and 7

war .will ravage the: world.

To guarantee enduring peace and clear the road for a new

A The Struggleior

BY GRACE cARLs6N

Acceptance speech of the Socialist Workers Party candidate for
Vice-President, delivered to the party's Thirteenth National Conven-
tion on July 3, 1948 and broadcast at that time over a nation-wide
network by the American Broadcasting‘ Company.

Biograp/Jical Note.‘ .

With a brilliant educational background including B.A., M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees, Grace Carlson lectured for two years at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota and for five years held the post of Vocational
Rehabilitation Counselor of the State Department of Education. But
she was not satisfied. Burning with a hatred of injustice and pov-
erty, war and class tyranny, she abandoned her successful career to
devote her energies to the trade union movement and the working-
class Struggle for socialism. ~-

Grace was a charter member of the Minnesota State Employes
Union Local 10; for four years delegate to’ the St. Paul Trades &
Labor Assembly and member of its Education Committee for three

years; twice a delegate to the Minnesota Federation of Labor con- i

ventions. She is a member of. the National Committee of the Work-
ers Defense League, and for ten years has been an active worker
in the Minneapolis branch of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People.‘

Grace Carlson was one of the defendants in the famous Min-
neapolis Labor Trial which sent her, Farrell Dobbs and other SW1’.

. leaders to prison for their socialist and anti-war ideas.
Twice she has run as SWP candidate for U.S. Senator from =

Minnesota, in 1940 and again in 1946. In 1942, when already sen-
tenced to prison, she was the SWP candidate for Mayor of St. Paul,
where she was ‘born. ‘

Delegates to the 13th National Com*erttio11 o/3 the Socialist
Workers Pa1'ty—-Working M en and Working Women of America:

It is with deepest gratitude that I have accepted your
nomination as candidate for V ice-President of the United States.

I consider it not only an honor but a responsibility and an

opportunity. _
A It is a high honor to be the first vice-presidential candidate
of the American Trotskyist movement. '
It is a solemn responsibility to carry the banner of truth
and socialism in a world ridden with capitalist corruption and
deceit, *

Set ﬁp,9rmted and~ Bound by Union Labor

 

. It offers an unexampled opportunity to unmask the plot .-
.of the fascist-minded rulers of this country who seek to destroy ,

the hard-won rights and liberties of the American people.

I want to. discuss this question here tonight. l want to
expose the duplicity of Harry Truman, the double-dealing of
Thomas E. Dewey and the hypocrisy of Henry Wallace.

I want to tell you about the Socialist Workers Party strug-
gle to protect and extend civil liberties-

J We stand for full social, political and economic equalityfor 
the Negro people and all other minority groups. We are ﬁghting

to put an end to the whole shameful system of Jim Crow—to

abolish the poll tax; to end discrimination in employment and’

housing; to put a stop to police brutality and outlaw lynching.
This is no mere vote~catching platform.’ We are enlisted in
the war against Jim Crow——for the duration.
The fourteen millions of Negroes are Americans in every
sense of the word, yet they liveas sub-citizens. I need not dwell
upon the persecution, the degradation, the humiliation to which

~ all American Negroes are subjected. Everybody knows it. That

is the greatest shame of ‘all! .
TheAFederal Government itself is the greatest perpetrator of
Jim Crow. Through its Jim Crow Army it carried this shame
into every. corner‘ of the earth. Andthis was under the ad-
ministration of President Roosevelt——and Henry Wallace.

_ For years bills for the abolition of the poll tax, for federal
legislation against lynching, for a Fair Employment Practices
Commission, have been kicked around by the ‘Democrats and
Republicans in Congress. ' J ‘

Today President Truman is seeking the Negro vote. So he
has made a resounding declaration in favor of rights for Negroes.
But at the same time his Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal,
declares that segregation in the P armed forces will continue.
Washington itself, the very capital of ‘the United States, is 21
Jim Crow city. In Washington some of the most vicious anti-

Negro practices of the deep South are shamelessly maintained, .

in full view of the President, Congress and Supreme Court.

Nobody is fooled by President Truman’s program for civil
rights‘, least of all the Negro people. All through American his-
tory they have fought for their rights. They have formed
innumerable organizations of struggle. Through one of these
organizations, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, in, Minnesota, I have been able to participate in
this struggle for over ten years.“ The Socialist Workers Party
welcomes with pride the spirit of resistance of the Negro

‘ people, of which the deﬁant attitude of A. Philip Randolph and ~
.Grant Reynolds is only one expression. - -A '

J But Negroes are not the only persecuted minority in the i
acountry. The Mexican people in California and Texas are

persecuted by reactionary landlords and capitalist interests;
They are shunted away into ghettoes. They are the victims of
unending police brutality. -

Anti-Semitism is growing everyday in the United States.‘

Daily, Jews are segregated by restrictive covenants written and
unwritten, insulted, threatened and refused employment simply
because they‘ are Jews. And this after we supposedly fought a
war against Hitlerism — which began with anti-=Semitism and

‘ ended with concentration camps and gas chambers!

America was built by immigrants, and prided itself on being
a haven for political refugees. Today the Immigration Depart-
ment and the FBI persecute foreign-bom workers with a vindic-

V tiveness and a ferocity that is shocking.
The second imperialist war was fought under the banner of -

"democracy” and “freedom.” Yet it was the administration of

Roosevelt — and Henry Wallace -— which treated American-

citizens of Japanese descent with sickening brutality.

Negroes, Mexicans, lndians, Jews, Japanese. That is their
story.

And why does all this take place? Because the Wall Street
billionaires want to keep their investments safe. They want no
change in the accepted policy of white supremacy. They wish
to feed prejudices against Negroes, Jews, Mexicans and other
minorities so as to distract the attention of the people from the
crimes and the chaos of the capitalist system itself.

They wish to keep the working people divided for easier‘

exploitation. We know that method. Hitl_er made it famous—or
should I say, infamous. »

J We of the Socialist Workers Party speak for a different '

America. We want the world to know that in this presidential
campaign of 1948 we speak as the true inheritors of the great
American traditions of resistance to tyranny——the traditions of
Patrick Henry and Sam Adams, of William Lloyd Garrison and
John Brown—+—traditions which the Republican and Dernocrﬂatic

parties are dragging in the mud.

We speak for the persecuted minorities. If they can be»
- deprived of their liberties, who can feel his.own rights safe?
. A ll of our traditional liberties are now in mortal danger.

 

The Taft-Hartley Slave Labor Law strikes at the rights of
60 million workers and their families. The Mundt Bill aims at
giving- the government the power to jail and persecute every
citizen and organization that opposes the tyrannical policies of
the ruling class.

21

Only those who are wilfully blind can fail -to see that in
every’ sphere the government and the capitalist masters of this
country are rapidly forging the chains by which they hope to
establish complete domination over the thoughts and actions of
the whole people, and above all, of the working class.

My friends, that is the way totalitarianism is prepared.
When the dictator ﬁnally makes his appearance and his bid for
power, his path has been smoothed first by the persecution of
rninorities.

That is why today the defense of the rights of minorities is
the defense of the liberties of all. Such is the nature of capitalism
that at a certain stage it must treat the great masses of the
people as if they too were an alien minority. America can be
safe from totalitarianism only if the people recognize the
ultimate objective of their capitalist rulers and resist them
without compromise.

Today the persecuted Negroes, Mexicans and the victims of
anti-Semitism must_ feel confident that a great unity of all the
oppressed and persecuted is being forged by capitalism itself-—
that their minority struggles are fast becoming the common

struggle.

The rich were able to put Hitler in power because of the
failure of the labor leaders and the Stalinist party in Gerfiiaiiy,
Today the workers know that they are the ones especially
aimed at. They were ready for nation-wide resistance‘ agairisl

the Taft-Hartley Act. Their leaders sabotaged the ﬁght. But we '
‘ present ourselves to you in this campaign ‘with one dominating

idea. We believe that only the most uncompromising resistance
by all the oppressed and all the persecuted can create the forces
.to smash the encroaching tyranny. We are supremely confident
in the readiness of the workers and minorities to do this.

The real problem is how to ﬁght this evil. Certainly it cannot
be fought by supporting the Democrats, or the Republicans, or

the Wallace party. They will do nothing. Their words are .

nothing but election promises. V . A

We must draw the necessary conclusions. Wemust break
with capitalist politics, capitalist ‘parties and capitalist poli—
ticians; The minorities must join forces with the organized work-
ers for militant, independent class action.

This does not mean merely voting at election time, although ’

that is important. It also means action—organized protest by
groups, organizations and whole communities.

Organized labor, the most powerful ‘force in the country-
and for that reason the most threatened———must take the lead in
the defense of civil liberties. It must initiate, in every sphere, the

’ traditional methods of struggle of the labor movement, struggles

such as those which built the CIO and which have defended the
working class against its capitalist. enemies. ’ _ - .
This is the message of the Socialist Workers Party in this
1948 election campaign. _ '
This is the program we‘ ask you to vote for. But above all,
this is the program we ask you to act upon. ‘

In summoning you to this struggle, the Socialist Workers I

Party comes with clean hands and an unblemished record.
_ Trotskyists have paid with their lives and liberty for
resisting tyranny all over the world, yes, even in the U. S. -

Tonight I want to end with a message to one particular
section of our peopIe——the most oppressed, the most exploited,
the most humiliated in the United States. I am speaking directly
to the Negro men and women in this country who live in the
Deep South. ‘ .

The Socialist_Workers Party has members of all races and
nationalities in its ranks. We want you to know, brothersand
sisters, that for us there can be no talk of freedom in the United

. States until you are free. We of the Socialist Workers Party know

’ , «.~ how you suffer. We know the heroic struggles you have to wage
every day, every hour, every minute’ of your lives. Even though

so many of you are deprived of the right to vote for us in this

election, we would like to hear from you. Write to us, Tell us’ ' ‘

about your problems-—your struggles, and your suffering. I
pledge myself to bring your plight before the American people
as a symbol of capitalist oppression, your struggle as the symbol
of the road to freedom. 4

‘of Peace and Freedom everywhere:

I accept, with grateful thanks, your nomination as candidate
for Vice-President. In these dark days of imperialist reaction,
when ru-mors of war ﬁll every headline, a candidate of our party
-must be a real anti-war ﬁghter—a crusader for peace.

I am keenly aware of the responsibility you have placed

» A   '  ca

 
 

upon megl pledge myse‘lf to do all that l can tocarry forward

' the struggle against: the Third World War——the Atomic Horror,

which our American masters are now preparing for us and all

' of the peoples of the world.

, There is only one way to ﬁght war——that is, to do away
with the capitalist system, which breeds war, and replace it with

an international socialist society. Socialism or Barbarism——that 

is/the choice before us. , ‘e

.Other people have tried other ways to ﬁght war. All of them
have failed. How many‘ millions of peace-loving Americans
trusted Woodrow Wilson in 1916 and depended on his promise
to keep us out of World War I? Do you remember the old
paciﬁst song that was popular in those days, ‘'1 Didn’t Raise
My Boy To Be a Soldier?” Like the mothers and fathers of all
ages and of all climes, the mothers and fathers of 1916 were
saying, “I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier—l brought him up
to be my pride and joy.” A _ .

They thought that Wilson would help them. They hoped

‘ that he would save their boys from the horror of the First World

War, which was then raging in Europe. They voted for Wilson
in large numbers in the 1916 election.

A But Wilson was a capitalist politican——a tool of Wall Street.
When he‘ was told that America’s capitalist interests required it,
Wilson violated his pacifist promises and took the United States
into the war. And many thousands of American boys, who had
been brought up to be their parents’ “pride and joy," died
miserable deaths on the battleﬁelds of Belgium and France.

But this was not the last betrayal at the hands of capitalist

politicians. In the election campaign of 1940, President Roosevelt

said time. and time again that he hated war and that he would
never agree to send American boys to ﬁght on foreign soil. Arid
another generation of mothers andfathers, who didn't want to
raise their boys to be soldiers, hoped that Roosevelt would keep
us'out ofWorld War ll. They trusted him and voted for him.

Once again,’ American capitalist interests demandedthat
the United States enter the ,.war. American investments had to
be ‘protected! German and Japanese competitors had to be re-
moved! And so, once more; American blood was spilled on

foreign battlefields. Lonely graves on Okinawa and in Italy '

and in a half a hundred other far-flung places, bear sad testi-
mony to Roosevelt’s broken promises. .
Mothers and fathers of America, don’t make the same

- mistake again! Don't depend on the lying promises of today’s

capitalist politicians. Don’t trust them to keep your boys out
of the next war! They are no different from Wilson and Roose-
velt. They will betray you again and again and again!

'.,.24_

If you support the capitalist party candidates Dewey,

Truman, Wallace or whoever—you will find inevitably that you T

have raised another crop of soldiers for U. S. imperialism!
True enough, Wallace says that he is completely opposed
to Wall Street’s plans for a war against the Soviet Union. But
that.’ s foritoday. He has also said that he will -support the
war once it has beenideclared. And it couldn't be any-other
way! ‘The millionaire Henry Wallace is completely sold on
the merits of the so-called free enterprise system. He may
differ with some of the Wall Street leaders from time to time

as to their tactics. He may believe that it's best to make a deal,

with Stalin right now. But whenxthe time comes, Wallace will
find a way to justify American imperia1ism’s next war, just as
he has done in the past. .

But Farrell Dobbs and l and the Socialist Workers Party,

_ for which we speak, are consistent anti.—war fighters. We fight

against war, and for socialism—-365 days a year, year in and
year. out—before, during and after war. . a

We were opposed to World War ll at a time when Henry
Wallace was whooping it up for the war. Don’t you remember

Vice-President Wallace’s solemn declaration that World War II,

would usher in the Century of the Common Man? , ,
But Farrell Dobbs and I thought —— and spoke ——-other-

 wise. We said that nothing could come out of this bloody _. ,. .

capitalist war but increased suffering for the common’ men -1-:  , I  1

of all countries —- and increased profits for the wealthylfew;
And sadly enough, for thecommon man —- so called —-_ it was
Dobbs and l who were right and not the demagogic Wallace!
Nothing good can ever come out of a capitalist war — certainly,
nothing good for the working people.

Of course, the capitalists and their political agents and ’
high-paid journalists, try to tell us that these wars are fought
' for high and holy causes —— "To Make the World Safe for Demo-
cracy" or “To Establish the Four Freedoms All Over the .
Earth.” Is there a single soul left on the face of the earth, who i

still believes that there was even ONE Freedom established by
World War II —-— let alone Four? I

Now they are telling us that the Third World War, which
is.‘ being prepared, is necessary in order to prevent the spread
of “Stalinist totalitarianism.”_ They moan about the lack of
political freedom in the Soviet Union and in the border coun-

tries. They talk about “freedom," these Republican and Dem4- *

ocratic fakers, who have not only tolerated but supported the

system of abject political slavery in the South! Anyone who_« ‘

is truly interested in spreading political freedom can start. right

here in the United States"———- right in Washington, D.C., itself.V_ V

'25

The Socialist Workers Partyis unalterably opposed to
Stalinist totalitarian methods and to nationalism. Stalin has’
committed terrible crimes against the Russian people and the
peoples of the neighboring countries. But we doinot believe
that they should be. rescued by the American imperialists.
TheAme_rican imperialists and.their junior partners, the English
imperialists, dream of turning Russia into a colony for capitalist
exploitation.’ They hope to succeed where Hitler failed.

Wall Street’s war-makers must be stopped! Mothers and
fathers of America, ‘young men and young women who are
about to be conscripted, militarized and prussianized, all of

you who shudder at the all—too-real prospect of a fearsome

atomic war, support the Socialist Workers Party and its candi-
dates! All of you who want to walk the path of peace, join with
us in our anti-war struggle. V

There is only one path to peace and that is to replace the -
V capitalist system of war, poverty and fascism with a socialist

society of peace, plenty and freedom. join withus to speed the
day when peace and not the sword will rule the earth!

Farmers Government  

; BY FARRELL DOBBS

Acceptance speech of Farrell Dobbs after his nomination by the
Socialist Workers Party as candidate for President, delivered to
the party’s Thirteenth National Convention on July 2, 1948 and
broadcast at that time over a nation-wide network by the Mutual
Broadcasting System.

Comrade Chairman and Delegazes.‘

I accept the nomination as the first presidential candidate
of the Socialist ‘Workers Party, tendered to me by this con-
vention. I thank you for honoring me with your confidence.

We enter the battle for the presidency in a period of grave

economic and political crisis —— a crisis as vital in its conse-
quences to the American people as that which confronted our
forefathers l72 years ago. A
Before the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed,
the American people lived under the tyranny of the British
lords of trade and their political agent, King George. That
tyranny was smashed by revolutionary struggle at Bunker Hill

26 /

and Valley Forge. And the United States leaped forward to ‘
‘achieve the greatest capacity for production of any nation. '

Now a new set of tyrants ——-— the monopoly corporations
and ban-king syndicates -4 have fastened themselves upon the
American people. Under their rule, want and fear. stalk through:
the land. Food and clothing cost a king’s ransom. Housing condi-
tions are a national scandal. Negroes and.other minorities are
subjected to cruel persecution. The. foerign born are hounded-V-—
unless they happen to be unemployed kings, or fascists who were
run out of their native land.

For the unions, monopoly capitalism has provideda slave?

labor law, the Taft-Hartley Act. Government strikebreaking
has become routine procedure in every labor ‘contioversy.

Witch hunts against political minorities are conducted by‘

the government. Scientists, are subjected to military regimenta-
tion. The proposed Mundt bill threatens to establish thought
control. These are ominous steps toward a police state. ‘

V .Another long stride toward a military and police state is
the peacetime draft of American youth, who will be subjected
to the tender mercies of the anti-labor brass hats.

Over every» man, woman and child hangs the threat of

‘ war, with the grim prospect of destruction from atomic bombs.
These are the bitter fruits of capitalism, which today. rules V

America through the Republican and Democratic parties.

A new Declaration of Independence is needed" to smash
this new tyranny. Millions of working people no longer trust
the Republicans and Democrats. Nor can they, trust any other
politician who supports and defends the capitalist system.

The working people need to build their own political party, i

armed with a program to serve the class interests of the men
and_women who toil.

The Socialist Workers Party is such a party.» This-is
demonstrated by the platform adopted at this convention.

The Socialist Workers Party is 100% opposed’ to the
capitalist system. We call for the establishment of a socialist
society. We advocate the nationalization of the basic industries
and their operation under workers control. _

.The:Socialist Workers Party calls; for full equality for

Negroes _and all other minority peoples. We are opposed to

any restriction on the right to strike. We demand that all laws
which abridge the civil rights of the people -be wiped out.

The Socialist Workers Party advocates a law to take the -

war-making powers away from Congress and to let the people

Vote on the question of war or peace. ' .
We demand that the l7 billion dollars earmarkedfor war

preparations be used for government-built, low-rent housing.
    «27

I

The Socialist Workers Party calls for the withdrawal of‘

all American troops from foreign soil. We. demand that the
oppressed peoples of all lands be allowed to run their own affairs.

The Socialist Workers Party advocates the formation of a .

Workers and Farmers Government, to run the country, not in
the interests of the wealthy, but in the interests of those whose
laborcreates this country’s wealth.

If we examine American history, we shall get an idea how,

this can be ' done.

Back in 1776, King George said that his handpicked gov- s

emors had to rule America because the people weren’t fit to
govern themselves. King George was answered by the forma-
tion of committees of mechanics, farmers and tradespeople
throughout the colonies. These committees organized a Con-_
tinental Congress, and under its leadership deposed the king’s
governors and established American independence.

Today, the Democraticande Republican politicians pack,

the government with bankers, industrial barons and brass hats.
-Like King George, they also claim that the working people are
not ﬁt to run the country. But what are the facts?

The workers and ‘farmers, with their marvelous technical

skills and creative capacity, produce everything used -by man. ,

All the capitalist does is to make a profit on the products of
«industry and agriculture. Yet the capitalist politicians insolently
deny that the working people areﬁt to make laws and administer
them.‘ They-must be shown otherwise. ' .

If I am, elected president, I shall issue a proclamation calling
for the democratic election of committees of industrial workers
and white collar workers, sharecroppers andworking farmers,
students and Negroes, rank and file soldiers and sailors —_— in

short, committees of all the exploited and the oppressed, the great ‘

majority of thepopulation. My proclamation will ‘ask these com-
mittees to organizema national Congress of Labor to draft a pro-

gram setting forth the economic and political demands of the 1

American working people. I shall ask that Congress of Laborto

elect a broad national executive committee —- which l shall i

appoint as my cabinet. You won’t find in my cabinet a single
banker, industrial baron or brass hat. a V

Regardless of the outcome of this election, the working class
can and should organize politically along these lines.

Working people of America! The Socialist Workers Party T

asks for your vote in support of the program I have outlined.
We summonyou to joinwith us in the struggle for a socialist
society, in which at long last you will really ﬁnd complete free-

dom from want and true freedom from fear.‘ A -

A President, delivered to the party’s Thirteenth National Convention
on July, 3, 1948 and broadcast at that time over a nation-wide net-
work ‘by the American Broadcasting Company.

L Comrade C bairman and Delegates:

I am proud to accept the assignment you have given me,
as the presidential candidate of the Socialist Workers Party, to
carry to the working people of America our program of struggle
-against capitalist wars and for a socialist world. A

. Less than three yearsafter the Second World War, American
, imperialism is already ‘preparing for another war. The great

A establish military bases throughout the world and militarize
American youth. We are told we can’t build homes, can’t have
‘old—age pensions, can’t have economic security, because they cost
/\ too much. Yet billions. are spent on the military budget and
 ' corporation profits are at an all-time high.
7 Using Stalin’s crimes to justify their program of world con-
quest, the bi-partisan coalition at Washington calls for a holy
war to defend “free enterprise” against totalitarianism.
, . If the Democratic and Republican stooges of monopoly
 ‘capitalism are opposed to totalitarianism, why do they foist a
murderous police state upon the Greek people? Why do they aid
Chiang Kai-shek and his corrupt military clique in China?

 

‘Why do they set up dictators in South America?rWhy did the 4

House vote to include fascist Spain in the Marshall Plan?

When these politicians claim they are against totalitarian-
ism, they do not speak the truth. Their only concern is to pre-
serve the outlived profit system they call “free enterprise.”

The monopolies, with the government's help, havelong ago
stamped out any semblance of free enterprise in America. Every
phase of. our economy is today in the iron grip of the giant

‘corporations and banking combines. They produce for proﬁt,
or they don't produce at all.

.Capitalism has kept the American people on a merry-g0-
round of depression, war, inﬂation,‘ and again war. The workers
are learning from their own experiences that the capitalist proﬁt
systemmust be scrapped. But they are disoriented by the lying
propaganda of the capitalists and their labor lieutenants, that
the-only alternative to capitalism is Stalinist totalitarianism.

Military Dictatorship or
A Socialist America

BY FARRELL DOBBS

Speech of the Socialist Workers Party candidate for President,-
broadcast over a nation-wide network by the National Broadcasting
System on May 15, 1948.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

By James P. Cannon‘

_ The Socialist Workers Party launches today its first presi-

dential campaign, and presents its candidate,»Farrell Dobbs,
The Socialist Workers Party is the sole representative in _

this country of the authentic socialism of Marx and Engels, of

>“‘Debs and Haywood, of Lenin and Trotsky. ‘ ‘

We ‘are called “Trotskyist‘s”——and we are proud to ‘bear
that iiame. .. ‘T

For Trotsky—side.by side with Lenin—was the leader and
organizer of the Russian" revolution——the greatest and most
progressive social action in all history. ‘

Even more than that, Trotsky defended the Russian revo-
Iution—and the principles of world labor emancipation whichit
embodied——against the Stalinist betrayers up to the very moment
of his death, at the hands of a Stalinist assassin, in Mexico City
eight years ago. ' . .

“Trotskyism” is a world-wide movement which unites revo-
lutionary militants of all countries and nationalities, of \all
races and colors, in a common world organization, founded by
Trotsky and known as the Fourth International.

The Fourth International has just successfully concluded
its World Congress in Europe, with delegates in attendance 1
from 19 countries and four continents. Though prevented by the
reactionary Voorhis Act from afﬁliation, the Socialist Workers

Party is in full sympathy with the world struggle of the    1

International for the emancipation of the workers _/and"colonial
peoples from capitalist exploitation and oppression.

From this national radio forum I salute the World Con-
gress gf the Fourth International in the name of the Socialist.
_W_orkers- Party of the United States. ' ‘ A

\

to socialism, the falsehood is spread that Stalinism is the natural

product’ of socialism. y

Let me tell you the truth about Stalinism and socialisni.

The first realistic steps to set up a socialist state were taken
in the midst of World War I by the workers and farmers
of Russia under the leadership of Lenin and Trotsky. That was
the only way to end the war and to prevent the bankers, in-
dustrial magnates and landlords from despoiling their country.

Butvthe Russian revolution only opened the road to social-
ism. It did not create the socialist society at one stroke. Lenin
and Trotsky openly stated that the complete transition from
capitalism to socialism in Russia could not be accomplished with
the resources of that country alone. . .

They looked to the working people of highly industrialized
countries like Germany, England and the United States to
also establish Workers and Farmers governments and enter into
democratic ‘collaboration on an international scale.

But the workers of western Europe were defeated in their

‘ attempts to take this road. Instead, the ruling capitalists of
Europe and America organized counter-revolutionary military
J '.

expeditions against the Russian workers.

Capitalism had good reason to fear the new revolutionary
government. Lenin and Trotsky summoned the peoplesof the
earth to put an end to the First World War. Theyicalled on the

working people to scrap monopoly capitalist rule throughout, _ ‘

the world. They demanded freedom for all colonial peoples.

And crime of crimes! Lenin and Trotsky were so indelicate
as to publish all the secret treaties they found in the Czar’s
conﬁdential ﬁles. These documents exposed theconspiracy of
the imperialist‘ powers to divide up the world, as Al Capone
and Bugs Moran split up the bootleg liquor market. in Chicago.

You of the older generation will remember how the Wilson
administration united with the Japanese Mikado and sent troops.
against the Soviet Union. '

For four bitter years?/the Russian working people were
forced to defend themselves against foreign military interven-
tion, as well as against the sabotage of their deposed native

capitalists and landowners. They emerged victorious, but cut off:

from the rest of the world. The Russian workers-were hungry and
battle—worne, yearning for respite and peace. The heaviest blow
of all was the death of their leader, Lenin.

Stalin exploited these conditions. to defame and exile
Trotsky, to impose upon the Ru_ssian workers a false policy of

nationalism, and to ‘drag them into the trap of his police rule. ,
The American capitalists are thus directly responsible for -

weakening the resistance of the Russian working class. and
’ 30

enabling the Stalinist dictatorship to stamp out workers’ ‘democ-
racy in the Soviet Union; -

It wasn't until Stalin had consolidated his totalitarian rule
that the American State Department granted diplomatic recogni-
tion to the Soviet Union. American capitalism hated the truly

a democratic government of Lenin and Trotsky. But they found!

it easy to collaborate with dictator Stalin, and even to. cover up

. for him, when it" served their ends.

 

Now American imperialism no longer needs Stalin. So they

conveniently ‘discover that his brutal regime is totalitarian. But’

when they try to identify Stalinism with socialism, they cut a

lie from the whole cloth. Stalin is anything but a socialist.’

Stalinism is an obstacle on the path to socialism. This obstacle
will be removed, not through capitalist wars of conquest, but
by the unpostponable struggle against capitalism itself.

One hundred years ago, Marx and Engels in their famous
Communist Manifesto predicted that capitalism would bring
the world to disaster unless the workers took over the reins of
government and set up a world socialist society.

Today, the madmen who rule America are preparing to
use their power to plunge humanity into a barbarism of endless
wars, in their insane drive to enslave the world. This power of
the American capitalists derives from their monopoly ownership

of the tremendous wealth of this country and their monopoly _

control of govermen_t. This monopoly must be wrested from them.

To break the economic stranglehold of monopoly capital-
ism, the Socialaist Workers Party calls for nationalization of the
basic industries and_ their operation under workers’ control.

To liberate America from the political" rule of Wall Street,
the Socialist Workers Party advocates the establishment of a
Workers and Farmers government. '

Once theseparasites are olf our backs, war will be only 2
word‘ in the history books. We shall then stand on the threshold

of a new era of unlimited human progress.

Our country has everything necessary to provide permanent
security and prosperity for all. We have the raw materials, the
industries,,the technology, a skilled labor force, a high cultural
level. These can be put to work to ‘provide an abundant life for
every man, woman and child‘-~in the nation.

When the mighty American working class takes these steps,
the world will follow. The tyrants will fall in every land. Franco,
Chiang Kai-shek, the Greek king and every other dictator, in-
cluding Stalin, will be brought togbook by the oppressed and the
exploited. The peoples of all lands will ioin with us to build the

world on new foundations—a world in which the agealong dreams

of poets and prophets will becomea living reality. 1

  SPEECH BY FARRELL noses

Less than three years after the termination of the Second
World War we are threatened with the imminent outbreak of
another war. Within the lifetime of one generation, we have

j gone through a vicious cycle of war; then depression; then
another war; then the present inflation; and the frenzied pre-
paration for a Third World War. This is the cycle of capital-.
ism — war, depression, inflation, and again war.

Thecapitalist masters of America and their political tools
at Washington are deliberately preparing to drag the American
people into another war. Capitalist production for’ proﬁts cannot
be reconciled with peace and prosperity for the people.

Hardly two years after the converting of industry to peac.e—

- time production, the home market is already saturated. The
workers can buy back only a small portion of what they«pro-
duce, and the ruinous inflation, combined with a refusal to
grant even a cost-of-living wage increase, only aggravates the .
contradiction. The countries of Europe and Asia, ruined by -

' the war, are unable to buy the surplus American goods, The
ruling capitalists see no way of postponing the threatened de-
pression, whichwill be far deeper and more devastating than

-—m..\_',_,,that_,gf the Thirties, except by shifting to an armaments economy

in preparation for any actual war. In their_ minds, peace is
identified AV/ithgthe demands of organized Workers for a larger ‘
share of the products of their toil, for- a greater degree of security.
Peace is identified in the minds of the profit-mongers with the
‘nation-wide strikes of the miners, railroad, packinghouse, auto’

 

and steel workers. They want to make an end of that. They
want to break up /the unions and free -themselves from the
necessity of dealing with organized workers. ~ ‘

-The_ war which they are plotting and preparing is directed
against the American people as well as against the rank and file
of humanity throughout the world.

The drive against the unions was spearheaded by the pas-
sage of the anti—union Taft-Hartley Lawgwhose provisions are ..
now being used to smash strikes with injunctions and police
terror. The steel trust, giving the lead to the major corpora-
tions, has refused to disgorge a single penny of its fabulous
profits for wage increases to meet the increased cost of living
of workers in the mills. ’ s . ' h

The Chrysler Corporation, wallowing in excess profits, has
forced its workers to strike for modest cost-of-living increases.

The packinghouse workers have been battling injunctions
and police tenror on the picket lines for more than two months.

With all my heart I greet the heroic auto and packinghouse
strikers who are fighting the battle of all workers today.

The preparations for war coincide with preparations for

, "military dictatorship at home. The major posts in the cabinet A
’ and the chief positions in important government agencies are " ‘

occupied by the brass hats of the army and the navy or the
overlords of industry and finance;

Under the direction and inspiration of this notorious Wall

‘Street-Brass Hat combination, democratic rights and civil liber-
‘ ties are under constant attack. A bill to militarize the youth

left but the whip.” o

is being rushed toward passage. Government employes are
subjected to Gestapo-like inquisitions. Congress itself is the
scene of wild orgies of officially organized witch-hunting. »

Foreign-born trade union leaders are picked up every day
and held for deportation. The notorious Mundt Bill, now in
preparation, would make all .0_pposition to the military dictator-.
ship a crime punishable by long prison sentences, by deportation
and concentration camps. _ l

The monopolists are determined to take all the colossal costs
of the war out of the hides of the American workers.

tally admits to this purpose in its issue of April 24. l qJJ.9&e":**~”"“““"”""l

So speaks Business Week, an authentic voice of the mono-
poly capitalists, the chief enemies of the American people.

This is the outspoken program of military dictatorship --
the iron heel of the capitalist oligarchy stamping out the lives,
the hopes and the liberties of the masses of American people.

The military dictatorship is the inexorable‘ product of a.

system which is driven inevitably, by the iron laws of its own
contradictions and of its insoluble crisis, from one global war
to another. The conclusion follows with the same logic:

There can be no effective struggle to defend the unions, to

protect and improve the living standards of the workers, to safe-
guard and extend the rights and liberties o_f the American peo-

ple, unless it is directed against the capitalist oligarchy and-its-

agents in the bi-partisan coalition which rulesin Washington.
There can be no effective struggle against war unless it is

directed toward the elimination of the war-breeding capitalist '

system; toward destroying the power of life and death over the
entire human race now possessed by a handful of madrnen‘.

There can be no effective struggle against the twin monsters .
o’f~wa~r and military dictatorship unless it is directed toward.

the establishment of a Workers and Farmers Government,
which will organize this country and the world for a society
based on human‘ needs, without profits, classes or exploitation.
Only one party stands on the basis of‘ such a program, in
the United States today. That is the Socialist Workers Party
whose banner I shall be proud to carry in the coming presiden-

The party of Henry Wallace,‘ despite its loud agitation for
peace, disarmament and against internal repression, is not af

genuine anti—war party, because it is not an anti—capitalistpart.y. ’
"A movement for peace pledged to disband at the outbreak‘

of war is nothing but a mass swindle of the millions of people
who have placed their confidence in this movement. The Corn-

munist Party, by supporting this Wallace swindle, is once again .

selling out the American workers to serve the momentary diplo-T
matic interests of Stalin and his Kremlin gang.

There is another so-called peace party, not as large as the

Wallace Party but just as loud in its anti-war pretensions. I, _

'§fﬁ‘“'referring to the party of‘NormangThomas. This party
bears the-name of the organization which once claimed, Eugene
.V. Debs as its leader. But this is a cruel deception. Debs fought
against the First ‘World War before official entry of the United

declaration of war by Congress. ‘Norman Thomas and his

He went to jail for continuing this struggle after the ‘

cohorts betrayed thememoryof Debs by jumping on the war

 c The struggle for socialism does not cease in time of war.
On the contrary, those who quit the struggle when war breaks
out cease to be socialists. ’ '

The Socialist Workers Party took its position in the Second -

World War in the tradition of Debs. lt continued its struggle

against war and capitalism, even though eighteen of its leaders
"suffered imprisonment for their fidelity to the working class

and to the cause of socialism.
The Socialist Workers Party continues the same uncom-
promising struggle today on the brink of World War lll.
Workingmen and Workingwomenl In your great numbers,
and in your mass organizations, rests the power to stop this

fatal plunge into war and dictatorship. You have the power to.

The Two Americas

BY JAMES P. CANNON

Keynote speech of the National Secretary of the Socialist Work-
ers Party, delivered to the party’s Thirteenth National Convention
on July 1, 1948 and broadcast at that time over a nation-wide net-
work by the American Broadcasting System. ‘

Comrade C bairman, Delegates and Friends.‘

We meet in Nati0nalVConvention at a time of the gravest
world crisis—a crisis which contains the direct threat of a third
and more terrible world’ war. _The basic causes of. this world
crisis are no mystery.

‘The ﬂrst cause is the breakdown of capitalism throughout"

Europe—and Asia—and the colonial lands. -
The working people want peace and bread, which capitalism
cannot give. a

The colonial slaves don’t want to be slaves any more-—-and
_ capitalism cannot live without colonial slaves. «

...\

‘ the oppressed.

The working people, the poor peasants and the colonial

slaves’ are in revolt against the continued rule of bankers and
-‘ landlords. ‘

On the other hand, American capitalism:-—the last solvent
stronghold of an outlived and doomed world system———is trying
to prop up the hated regimes of capitalists and kings and land?
lords by economic pressure and military force.

These are the two main elements of the present world crisis.

The Wall Street money-sharks, and the brass hats of

‘Prussian mentality, are riding high in Washington these days.

The masters of America, drunk with power, arethreatening.
and terrifying the people of the world—seeking to dominate and

enslave them——striving to transform the other countries of the"

world into colonies of the American empire.
Their program is a program of madness, and is doomed to
failure. T
The great majority of the peoples of the world do not want
to be slaves of America.
That is to their credit and we applaud them for it. t .
The attempt to enslave them would be proﬁtable only for

the small group of monopolists——and the military caste,   , 
. dream of careers as colonial administrators of conquered peoples. -
But the‘ criminal adventure would encounter such ferocious  A

resistance that the American people at home would have to pay

’ an enormous cost, in living standards ruined, by inﬂation, inthe

stamping out of democracy by military _rule. And Americals
young-sons, would have to pay in misery, blood and death.
The American people.would be among theﬁrst victims of

_ the insane campaign of American imperialism to conquer and

enslave the world.

To avoid this calamity it "is necessary now to show the-

people of the world the other=America-
‘ For there are two Americ'as-—and millions of the people
already distinguish between them.
One is the America of the imperialists--of the little clique

- of capitalists, landlords, and militarists who are threatening and

terrifying the. world. . *‘
This is the America the people of the world hate and fear.

There is the other America——the America of the workers and A A
‘farmers and the “little people.” "

 They constitute the ‘great majority of the people.
They‘ do the ‘work of the country.

They revere. its old_democratic traditions-—its old recordrofr
friendship for the people of other lands, in theirstruggles against-

Kings and Despots——its. generous asylum once freely granted to

V8 '7 - > "/1

 

 

 

This is the‘America which must and will solve the world
crisis——by taking power out of the hands of the littleclique of

exploiters and parasites, and establishing la government, of work- A

hers‘ and farmers.

The Workers and Farmers Government will immediately
proceed to change things /u/ndame1ztall_'y-'——

Throw out the proﬁt and rent hogs, and increase the living
standards -of the people who do the useful work.
V Assure freedom and democratic rights to all, not forgetting
those who are denied any semblance of them now.

 ~_ ,5 Call back the truculent admirals from the seven seas——and
 ground the airplanes with their dangling bombs.‘ ’

Hold out the hand of friendship and comradely help to the
oppressed and hungry people in the world. "

These people don’t want to ﬁght anybody._

They only want to live. -

There are two billion people in the world——and more than

i _ half of them don’t get enough to eat. ‘-

These people should be helped-,—not threatened, not driven

back into slavery, under the social Qstem that has kept half

of them hungry all their lives.
It is well to recall now that America was born of revolution

' in T1776, and secured its unity as a nation through another
- rev'olution——the Civil,_War—which smashed the abomination of

chattel slavery, in the process. -
Our great, rich, wonderful country was once the light and

_ the hope of the world. ‘

But our America has. fallen into the hands of a small, selﬁsh

group, who are trying to_dominate the world——and to set up a

police state at home. \

These Wall Street money-sharks are just asiforeign. to the
real America as were the despots who ruled the land before the
revolution of 1776. . c

A They "are justas foreign as were the trafﬁckers-in human
ﬂesh and blood--the slave owners———whose power was broken

'b'y.the Civil War——the blessed second American Revolution.

These imperialist rulers of America are the worst enemies

of the American, people. ' —
American democracy, under their rule, is slipping away.

Thefear that oppressed Mark Twain, the fear that AmericaW_,__g_,_i_,__

would lose its democracy, is steadily becoming a reality.” "
The Taft-Hartley Law is but the most recent instance of this
ominous trend. g
The divine right of kings has reappeared in America-

. disguised as the divine right of judges to issue injunctions and

levy ﬁnes against labor organizations.
