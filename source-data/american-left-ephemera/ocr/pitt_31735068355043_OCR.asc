DENVER—Mine-Mill’s leadership from bottom to top fought back last month against the remnants of McCar-
thyism which made up the “recommended decision” of SACB Hearing Examiner Francis A. Cherry charging the
union with “communist infiltration.” In a magnificent display of trade union solidarity, rank and file local‘ leaders
from coast to coast joined with their district and International leaders in denouncing the charges as based on long-
discredited hoary tales with no historic validity or relation to the true democratic character of Mine-Mill. ‘(See

PRESIDENT JOHN CLARK addresses Arizona Mine-Mill Council meeting in Bisbee last month. Delegates from

Many Issues Still Pending as
Congress Starts New Session

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Congress late last month settled down to work on an
agenda heavily weighted with old and new business, against a backdrop of conserva-

tive domestic policies outlined b

Union messages.

First legislation to clear the Sena

already approved by the
House. One of the first
initial actions of the House
was to pass the Administra-
tion’s postal increase bill, an
important factor in the pro-
posed balanced budget. Still to
get through the Senate, the
measure would increase post-
age on first class letters from
four to five cents and airmail

from seven to eight cents, as .

well as boost the rates for

V newspapers, magazines and

books.

Another key test for Presi-
dent Kennedy was set in the
House Rules Committee on the
proposal to establish a new
Cabinet-level Department of
Urban Affairs. The $enate
agenda included action on
amendments to the Welfare
and Pension Plan Disclosure
Act, college aid, Urban Affairs
andga bill creating a Youth
Employment Opportunities
and Conservation Corps.

WITH the legislative wheels
beginning to turn, lawmakers
were still digesting. aloud the

— President’s Budget and Union
messages. Reactions‘ generally

y President Kennedy in his Budget and State of the

te in the new session was the Du Pont tax bill,

split along party lines. Demo-
cratic leaders termed them
“constructive,” while Republi-
cans found them “dangerous”
to the welfare of the country.

For the average person, the
President’s 1962 perspectives
showed an unmistakable mean-
ing: a decided emphasis on the

conservative side dealing with '

domestic problems‘ and con-
trasting‘ liberality toward na-
tional security expenditures.
This point was driven home
clearly by the $92.5 billion
budget for the next fiscal year,
biggest since 1944 ‘at the cli-
max of World War II. Of the

‘proposed $3.4’ billi'on"b00‘st in ,
government expenditures, only“

$1 million more goes for do-
mestic civil functions as com-
pared to a $2.7 billion increase
for security. . -
=l= 9.: ti:

LEGISLATIVE‘ requests
enumerated in the Budget mes-
sage were similar to those
earlier in the ‘State of the
Union Message, but funds,au-
thorized indicated that the
President’s rather surprising

emphasis on domestic prob-
lems was largely political talk.
In the Health, Labor and
Welfare area, spending was
upped $297 million, including

statements on pages 4

and 5.) »

As the story broke with the
widest kind of distorted press,
radio and TV publicity, the
men who run the union—its
elected local and national offi-
cers—were quick to set the
record straight with declara-

tions of support_ and condem- 1

nations of the SACB attack
for what they recognized it
was, an attempt to disrupt
their united bargaining
strength ‘just when the union
was preparing to enter new
contract negotiations with the
major producers in the non-
ferrous metals industry.
Immediate statements deny-
ing the charges were issued by
executive_ board members and
local officers in. the form of
press releases. Leaflets to the
membership were distributed
at plant gates in many areas.
Discussions were held at local
meetings everywhere.
general reaction of the rank
and file was similar through-
out the union—it’s the same
old baloney rehashed out of

the old hysteria of the Mc- ‘

Carthy era.

The case itself was initiated
before the SACB more than
six years ago, -in 1955. Pro-

ceedings before Cherry began

two years later, and continued
on and off until last spring
when the hearings were con-
cluded. It was another nine
months before the “recom-
mended decision” was an-

nounced, on the eve of 1962 .

  Biggest Yule Fete
By Miami Miners

The biggest Christmas party
ever held in Miami, Ariz., was
given by Mine-Mill’s Miami
Miners Union Local 586 this
past holiday for the children
of the city and the union’s
membership.

Some 1,200 children attended
the Yule fete at the Miami
Miners ‘Union Hall’ Dec., 23
where they were given candy,
nuts and other goodies by
Santa Claus and were ‘enter-
tained with movie cartoons.
The same type of a party was
given by the union at the

 Christmas, Ariz., mine site
' bunkhouse for the children of
members in that unit of Local
586. Santa was also there with
similar goodies.

The Miami Miners Union’s
local executive bo ard along
with many volunteer mem-
bers made the huge success of

._ both parties possible. Part of
the crowd at the affair in
Miami union hall is shown in

V photo below.

Apprentice Plan‘
Starts in Hayden

A new apprenticeship pro-

gram negotiated by Mine-Mill
Local 886 with American
Smelting & Refining Company
at its Hayden, Arizona, smelt-
fer is now being put into ef-
fect, following approval of the
membership just before the
New Year.

According to Int’! Rep. Jacob
Mercado, apprentices were be-
ing set up in the Boilershop,

‘ with‘ other craft workers rep-
resented by Mine-Mill at the
property to be included in the
program later.

The agreement contains two
unusual provisions:

1. The starting rate for the

. apprentice will be the helper’s
rate, which is 85 percent of
the journeyman’s rate. Ap-

 

prentices will get 85 percent

of the journeyman’s rate for

the first year, and an ad-
ditional one percent for the
second year, two percent for
the third year and three per-
cent on their fourth year.

2. "Exceptions to a 35-year
age limit will be made for
previous experience, unusual
educational training or other
qualifications.

On completion of apprentice-
ship, the apprentice will be
compensated for 80, percent of
the money spent on the train-
ing course. . ,

There are men in the shops
who have been working as
helpers for 15 years without
getting promoted because of
the company’s claim of lack of
qualifications. The new pro-
gram’s age limit does not pre-
vent the men already working
in the shops from becoming
apprentices; credit will be
given them for previous ex-
perience. ' 

Local ‘leaders feel that the
apprentice program agreement
opens up new: opportunities
for advancement of Mine-Mill
members into skilled jobs.

The agreement was signed
for Local 886 by President
Joaquin Flores, Financial.Sec-
retary Tino Torres and Re-
cording Secretary Milesio
Chavez. ,

Bessemer Starts

Defense Donations

Harbison-Walker Local 531
in Bessemer, Ala., has voted
to make donations of 25 cents
per week per member for
eight weeks to the Mine-Mill
Defense Fund. The first check
was received by the Interna-

tional office in December.

Magma Still Idled
By Fire in Mine

Some 800 men, most of them
members of Mine-Mill Supe-
rior, Ariz., Local 938, remained
idle last month as crews con-
tinued to fight the under-
ground fire in the Magma
Copper Company mine. Mag-
ma’s operations at the mine,
mill and smelter in Superior
have been shut down by the
fire since early December.

The workers remaining in
the area are eligible for un-
employment compensation
benefits. As of Jan. 17, the
company could give no esti-
mate on when the mine will be
returned to operation.

Bisbee Auxiliary Plans

Lobby in State Capitol

BISBEE, Ariz.——“If it takes the women to go to the
State Capitol to get legislation to protect our men, we

will go there.”

This was the sentiment of the Bisbee

Ladies Auxiliary No. 551 at their meeting in the union

hall J an.‘ 15.

The ladies discussed send-
ing a delegation to Arizona
Gov. Fannin and meetings
with House and Senate lead-

ers on the Mine-Milliprograrn '

for better safety and health
laws covering the state’s min-
ing industry. They also
planned to Contact other Ari-
zona auxiliaries to have them

join in this delegation to the

capitol. ' «
- >l< =ll =I<

A MAIN purpose of_the Bis-
bee Auxiliary’s special meet-
ing was to gather more infor-
mation on a recent move in

Douglas Local 470 to secede ;
iary include a children’s

that local from the Phelps
Dodge Council and Mine-Mill.
The women also wished to be
brought up to date on the
SACB case. They "invited Ari-
zona Regional Director Frank
Vettorel to speak on both mat-
ters.

Following their discussion,
the ladies ‘made plans for im-
mediate action to tell the wom-
en of Douglas Local 470 mem-
bers to speak up againstthe

disruption in that local. They _
decided to go to Douglas and M
' personally contact the women

there.
At an earlier meeting ' on

Jan. 7 the Auxiliary’s officers. .
g were sworn in— by Internation-
a_l President John Clark in

conjunction with the installa-
tionceremony for the new of-
ficers ‘of Copper Queen Miners

Clark, District 2 Board Mem-
ber M. _R. Barraza also spoke
to the gathering of Local 551
members and wives.

iOn Contracting Issue I

PERTH AMBOY, N. J .—A key grievance involving
the issue of contracting out of work was won in arbitra-
tion recently by Local 365 at the AS&R smelter and
refinery here. The union’s victory on this important issue
is considered by local leaders to be of considerable sig-

nificance not only to Mine-
Mill members throughout
the AS&R chain and other
companies, but to the entire la-
bor movement.

The grievance, affecting five
men specifically, was forced
into arbitration by AS&R man-
agement on the question of
whether the company had the
right to contract out work to
an outside contractor which is
assigned to janitors in the
Mine-Mill bargaining unit, and
to lay off the janitors.

Management claimed they
had this right due to the fact,
they said, that it enabled them
to save money. They ‘main-
tained they were justified in
laying off the Local 365 jani-

tors.
#4 =l< *

IN THE course of the arbi-
tration proceeding, the com-
pany argued, that they could
save $20,000 by contracting
out the janitorial services to
an outside contractor, whereas
the Mine-Mill members would
be paid $40,000 or double the

‘ amount. ,

The union’s position was
that the company had no right
to contract out work assigned
to Local 365’s jurisdiction un-
der the contract specifying the
bargaining unit. In addition to

. asking a favorable decision on

this issue, the union also ar-
gued that the’ janitors be re-
instated with no lost time, va-

  

cations, holidays and other
benefits.

Victory on the most impor-
tant phase of the case came
just before the New Year when
the arbitrator ruled that the
company did not have the right
to lay the men off, and could
not contract out the Mine-Mill
janitorial work, and ordered
that they be put back to work
on their jobs with all senior-
ity rights and benefits due
them.

>i= 3!: *-

ON THE question of back
pay, the arbitrator decided he
could not rule. Local leaders
feel his decision on this was
influenced by. the fact that two
of the five janitors involved-
were pensioned, two. came to
the Perth Amboy "plant from
Research in Plainfield and the
other apparentlyrefused a job
elsewhere when it was offered
him.

It is the belief of the local
officers and committeemen
that winning the arbitration
has stopped the company from
trying to contract out any oth-
er work in the union’s bargain-
ing unit, thus representing an
outstanding victory for the 10-
cal and all of the labor move-
ment.

The arbitration was handled’
by Local Attorney David Man- »

del, District 6 Board Member

Alfred Petit-Clair, Local 365.

President John Infusino and
the local committee.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

   

 February  _

UOTED on this 2-page spread are statements from
i Mine-Milllocal leaders on the recommended decision
of SACB Hearing Examiner Cherry to label their union
“communist—infiltrated.” Condemnations of the charge
have been received by the International office from rank
and file officers in every region of the union.

In numerous locals, denunciations of this latest legal
attack and declarations of support to defeat it have been
made by entire executive boards. Inothers,.the state-
ments were voted as the official actions of the locals in
regular membership meetings. Some locals have also
sent telegrams to their Senators and Congressmen urg-
ing that the unwarranted charge be quashed.

Space limitations do not permit the inclusion here of
all the statements and messages received. The follow-
ing, however, are representative:

OWEN MCNALLY, President
Local 117, Anaconda, Montana

“Regarding the one ,man’s opinion, Mr.
Francis H. Cherry of the SACB in the Mine-
Mill case, let it be known that we have in-
telligent leadership both as officers and
rank-and-file members in the Mine-Mill Un-
ion who would recognize any danger; to our
country’s welfare and security and would
do something about it if the necessity arose.
Now, in my opinion, it is just another at-
tempt at collusion between Government and
employer to wreck the labor movement. On
the patriotic front, our record speaks for it-
self.”

 

DAVID DUARTE, Chairman
Arizona Mine-Mill Council

“It is not a surprise to me that the SACB’s recommenda-
tion comes at a time when our International Union is prepared
to’ enter bargaining —in the non-ferrous metals industry. We
have been constantly under attack by those who seek to destroy
this Union and what we stand for. This is not only a move to
disrupt our program, but a move against the entire labor
forces in this country. I am sure that in the end a full vindica-
tion of these attacks will come.” I

DAVID BENNETT, President‘
Local 392, Magna, Utah

“The so -called recommendation of Cherry against our
union is another step‘ in the attempts to discredit and disrupt
allorganized‘ labor. This decision is not one of Cherry’s alone,
but is being pushed by parties not interested in the advance-
ment of labor unions——only in the disintegration of all labor
organizations. The support and pressure behind this move is
all too obvious, coming at a -time when not only are we’ about
to prepare to negotiate but also where we are faced with being
raided by so-called ‘perfectionists’. Who is kidding who?”

STANLEY WENHAM, President
Local 593, Buffalo, New York

“As a willing character witness, I was

Union and loyal present and former officers.
In’ all my associations with ‘said officers at ,

professional witnesses have occurred be- _- .
cause of the democratic -procedure that is
written into our International Constitution.
Under this democratic procedure, disgruntled
and vindictive.former officers and representatives have taken
advantage and tried to crush our Union. But our Union has
been built on the solid base of hardship and struggle, and I am

 

positive that the recommendation of Mr. Cherry will not stand
.up in the courts. Finally, I would like tomake the point that
-this isnot only Mine—Mill’s battle, but thestruggle for survival

of the entire labor movement.” , I. V ‘

EXECUTIVE BOARD, MIKE -BUKOWSKI,.P1-esident
Local. 711, Erie, Pennsylvania

“We are proud of our Mine-Milltunion, its democratic poli-
cies and its program to-improvethe living standards of all our
members and their families. Our International officers and
representatives do not ..tell us what .to do. We make our own
decisions. This is good unionism. We resent the SACB exami-
ner’s recommendation. . . . It’s an insult to our intelligence and
an injustice to our members. If this attack were upheld, all
unions would be in danger. and democratics rights we now
enjoy would be destroyed. We support our International offi-

cers and representatives all the way.”

WINSTON ELKINS, President

Local 551, Bisbee, Arizona

“The SACB case against our Interna-
tional Union is just another way of disrupt-
ing _our coming negotiations and contract
settlements. Our Union has for along time
been.under-attack by those that seek to de-

Union I cannot understand why they (the
SACB) could in any way use the testimony
of known perjurers and Army DESERTERS
in this case. I am confident that our Union
will be vindicated.” ‘

. . . It’s just another gimmick to help
the Steelworkers in their raids against sec-
tions of our membership. Each time Mine-
Mill is engaged in a struggle against the
employer or fighting off raids, this happens.
All it is intended to do is weaken, disrupt
and destroy Mine-Mill. I’m sure that this
will fail as it has done so many times in the
past. I urge every member to support your
union and continue to fight to hold our
union together as you have done in the past.
We’ll decide what kind of union we have; no
SACB Examiner is qualified to judge our
union. We, the membership who make up this great democratic
union, we are the ones who know what our union is. This is as
it should be.”

LOUIS CI-IATMAN, President
Local 735, Cleveland, Ohio

“The recommendation by a member of the SACB»is shock-
ing to say the least, especially in view of the fact they have no
basic ground on which to make such a recommendation. This
vicious unwarranted attack on our union serves only -one. pur-
pose, it unites every member into close unity for a fight to
protect Mine-Mill and preserve the right of fair bargaining.
Come on, members, let’s fight back!”

JOE GILLIGAN, President
Local 25, Tacoma, Washington

“In my opinion, the SACB.case against
Mine-Mill and its democratically elected offi-
cers is simply a concerted effort by the em-
ployers to destroy the working conditions
and lower the living standards of Workers
in the mining industry. This is part of the
harvest reaped. because workers have been
deluded into believing management’s pub-
licity that ‘unions have no business:in poli-
tics’ and so the job that can’t be done. on
the workers at -the bargaining table is be-
ing done with anti-labor’ legislation.” - -

 

WILLIAM’ THOMAS, President
-- Local 531, Bessemer, Alabama ,

“Are we or are we not practicing the ‘right way of life’
when we practice the true labor union’s .‘way of life’? Are
those who testified against Mine-Mill people who have. a. rep-
utation of being truthful, respectable, honest persons? Not {even
Mr. Cherry will say that Mine-Mill does not do a good ‘job for
its members. Is that why We are ‘called ‘communist’? ,I, have
heard that any minority who thinks he is as much hu'man'or
as good as anyone else and dares to fight for first class recog-
nition is a ‘communist’;

“Do We embarrass someone, other unions? In my area
we have many friends who are members of several interna-
tional unions. When we comparethe democratic practices, not
in the books but in the union halls and on the jobs, there is no
question at all why some unions will go to "any extent to have

, someone, anyone,‘ even the government to helpthem destroy

Mine-Mill. Theygwoud like to have vourmembers. They would
like to, save their faces, and continue to run their unions from

' , the, top down.” ' i

CARL KRASS, President

_' W Local 616, Morenci, Arizona,
“The SACB case against Mine-Mill is
harassment pure and simple. It is notable
that inclusions of unions, as such, only came
under the Subversive ‘Activities Law as an
i afterthought and since thentheibulk of case-
work has been against Mine-Mill. ‘Certainly
this points a finger of suspicion at the.

ernmental agency to do‘ their union-busting
for them. As a witness for Mine-Mill in the
SACB case, I can attest to the fact that the
government has used unduly rough tactics

“Brother Clark, the AS&R Unit of Local
50 took unanimous action at a special
meeting Thursday, Jan. 11, to concur in
your action to appeal the decision of Gov.
Cherry. Local 50 knows that as long as our
International Union fights for the right of
theworkers and continues with its demo-
cratic policies we shall be sub_ject to attack
by one agency or another.”

 

ROBERT BARCON, President
Local 586, Miami, Arizona

 “Looking back through the history of our Union makes me
form but one opinion. We have had different men as officers
and they have always been persecuted. . . . Some of these wit-
nesses were renegades and are now on the staff of other labor
organizatio-ns. These renegades are no longer being persecuted
since they tried to break our Union and are now considered
true loyal Americans.

“Now we have the present officers and leaders being per-
secuted by the SACB. To me this is just a followup, continuing
the‘ vicious attack on our Union, trying to dothe job the Mc-
Carran Committee failed to do. This convinces me the SACB
is not really after our leaders but is" being used as the em-

ployers’ weapon in its constant attempt to disrupt and finally

break our Union. . .
“I see but one reason for this and that is our union’s con-

tinued progressive program of improving our _-working condi-.

tions and getting us, its members, a higher standard of living.”

‘ “The SACB hearing was a- disgrace to
the fine‘ machinery of justiceset forth in’ the
Constitution of the United ‘States. The _few
hours I was a witness for the Union at the
hearing in Washington; D.iC., the hearing
chairman, Cherry, slept soundly while I was.
answering the questions "of Attorney Witt
at least 75 percent of the time. I fail to see
on what he based his decision. . . Cherry
admitted that the Union was democratic
and was run by its members, and I ask you,
is this b_ad?"Aft‘er making a statement like

 

he did, the main thing I can derive from this crass thinking
is that Democracy itself must be being pushed out of the way

by the SACB.”

THE MINE-MILII. umon

 

: fieneral C.o,u;nsel:_ .

lUnion’s

Status Not

 Aftected by SACB

”. THE most important thing to bear in mindjabout the
“recommended decision” in the S.A.C.B. case is that
it has no effect of any kind on the status of Mine-
Mill, its agreements and its right to negotiate agreements,
or its standing before the N.L.R.B.
' The law itself provides that there are

absolutely no consequences until all judicial
appeals, up to the Supreme Court of the
United States, are exhausted. The next step,
now that Cherry has issued his report, is to
file exceptions to the report with the Board
itself. These are due on February 1.
Sooner or later, the Board will issue its
order. If the order is unfavorable, we have
the right to have it reviewed by the Federal
Court _of Appeals. If‘ the Court of Appeals
upholds the Board's order, we then have the
right to ask the Supreme Court to review

the case.

 

Wiﬂ.

***k

N normal course, these-steps should take at least three years.
It could actually take much longer for an ultimate decision
because, at any stage, the case could be sent back to a prior

stage.

For example, the Board itself might order the case re- A

opened before Cherry or another examiner. Or the Court of
v_ Appeals, instead of deciding all the issues,_could send the case
7 back to the Board for reopening of the hearing or for further
consideration in one or more respects. Or the Supreme Court
might send the case back to the Court of Appeals or the Board

for one reason or another.

-Any one of these developments could delay the final dis-
position of the case for an additional year or more. And it is
not mere speculation to refer to these possibilities, as is illus-
trated by the history of the first case under the McCarran Act
of'1950 which set upthe S. A. C. B. In that case, the Board

issued its original order in April, 1953, but the—Supreme Court —
did not finally decide the case until June, 1961, eight years ’

‘kirir

 later.

AM not saying that the Mine-Mill case will take that long or
anywhere near it. After all, each case is different, with
different issues. But long delays are inherent in a proceed-
ing of this kind. And because, in my opinion, Cherry’s report is
so full of factual and legal errors, I am confident not only of
ultimate success in this case for Mine-Mill, but I would not be
S surprised if there were further long delays, along the lines I
‘ “ have suggested, for one reason or another.
"In addition, the statute under which the case was brought
- has a provision which gives an organization which the
Board finds to be “Communist-infiltrated” the right to try to
show the Board, within six months thereafter, that it is no long-
er “Communist-infiltrated.” Especially ‘since most of “Cherry’s
report is based on events which took place many years ago and
relates to many persons no longer connected with Mine-Mill,
we would be able to show that even if what Cherry says was
true in the past, it no longer is true.
Even if the Board itself then decided against us on that
question, we would have the right to take that decision also to
the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.

*A'**

S far as the legal issues in the case are concerned, I have

every confidence that when the case reaches the courts,

it will be decided in favor of Mine-Mill. There are an enormous

number of such legal issues, including constitutional ones.

Apart from everything else, the case rests on the testimony of a

few informers, professional witnesses, and persons who had
been fired by Mine-Mill, like Fred Gardner.

Never has a union in this country been subjected to as
thorough and minute an examination, in a legal proceeding or
otherwise, as has Mine-Mill in this case. Every small scrap of
evidence or alleged _evidence was dug up. The transcript of
testimony runs to’ almost 10,000 pages and there are many thou-
sands of pages in the hundreds of exhibits. The evidence covers

a period of more than 20 years.

’, Mine-Mill has every reason to be proud that the only ad-
verse testimony against it comes from a handful ofdisreputable
and discredited characters.—NATHAN WITT, Mine-Mill General

Counsel.

(Continued from Page 1)
the SACB Board itself and, if
necessary, all the way to the
Supreme Court, Clark stated
flatly: ,

“Mr. Cherry’s report has no
effect whatsoever,
any order of the Board. The
order ‘in no way affects the
agreements between the Union
and hundreds of companies
with whom it has contractual
relations. The Union’s status

‘under the law and as a labor

organization cannot be affect-
ed until all judicial proceed-
ings are concluded. It is esti-
mated this will take several
years.”

The first step taken by the
union in this procedure pro-
vided by the law was the fil-
ing of exceptions to Cherry's
report with the Board. Due to
be submitted by Mine-Mill
General Counsel Nathan Witt
by Feb. 1, the exceptions blast-
ed gaping holes in the testi-
mony of the government's
stoolpigeon witnesses‘ in the
case—most of them renegades
from the union, paid inform-
ers, or both——as well as pin-
pointing numerous errors of
ruling and fact. (See Wittfs
column at left.) H '

ll‘ II‘ II‘

IN HIS hard-hitting press
statement, President. Clark un-
derscored the fact that “the
government's case before the
Board was based on the evi-
dence of "discredited paid in-
formers, an Army deserter
and perjurer, a convicted
criminal and an array of oth-
ers with one or another kind
of ax to grind.”

‘ “Against this hodge podge
of stale lies, some of it dating
back to the 1930’s,” he pointed
out, “we presented 125 wit-
nesses, including over a hun-
dred members of Mine-Mill
from every section of the
United States. They testified
to the democratic conduct of
the Union’s affairs, and to the
substantial economic gains the
Union has won for our mem-
bership in collective bargain-
ing; they categorically denied

The veteran Mine-Mill leader
noted that, in his report “Mr.

that its members determine its

first-rate job in securing gains

CLARK said: a “Mr. Cherry
also ignores completely the
undisputed evidence that the
governments three principal

there would be no case against
Mine-Mill-—are liars and per-
jurers, He accepts all their
testimony at face value. On

this basis. alone, aside from’

any others, Mr. Cherry’s re-
port will not stand up.”

The SACB proceedings, Clark
observed, “are the last of a
series of government actions
instituted over , the last ten
years to harass us, in the hope
of ultimately destroying Mine-
Mill. We have already won all
three of such cases which have
gone to the Supreme Court of
the United States, and we are
confident that this case will

ILWU Says ‘Inﬁltration’
Tag Threat to All Labor

SAN FRANCISCO—The International Longshore-
men’s & Warehousemen’s Union warned last month that
the “communist infiltrated?»-’ ‘charge used by the SACB
against Mine-Mill is a threat to all unions. An editorial
in the Jan. 12 issue of The Dispatcher, official ILWU

newspaper, said:

“All labor should rally to
the cause of the mine and mill
workers. "We don’t believe
there is any union in the land
that could not, with the aid
of perjury, be found ‘to be
‘Communist infiltrated.’ In-
deed, the term itself is vague

like Jencks, was charged with

40 Percent

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Na-
tional and international unions
affiliated with the AFL-CIO
this year are paying 40 per
cent more in monthly per
capita tax per member to the
merged federation.

The per capita increase was
voted by the AFL-CIO conven-
tion at Bal Harbor, Florida, in
-December, to cover the federa-
tion’s in c r e a s e d operating

_ costs in the face of reduced
membership and income. Con-
vention reports indicated a loss
of 200,000 members by the fed-
eration in the last two years
and an over-all drop_ of some
21/; million members since the
AFL and CIO merged in 1957.

The new permanent per
capita increase replaces the 60
per cent temporary b o o s t
ordered as an emergency meas-
ure by the AFL-CIO executive
board last March to make up
a reported $2.2 million deficit
in the federation’s operating
expenses at that time.

New Barrage
To Hit Labor

. WASHINGTON, D. C.—~Ac-
cording to Rep. Elmer Holland
of Pennsylvania, a disturbing
build-up in anti-labor propa-
ganda to Congressmen is pres-
ently taking place.

He likens it to the period
which preceded the passage of
the Landrum-Griffin Act.

“It’s only a trickle now,” he
said, “but there is every indi-
cation that when this session
of Congress gets moving it
will be barraged.”

, CONGRESSMAN Holland, a
--former union organizer him-
-self, said there are intensive
efforts to promote the follow-
ing legislation:

0 Place labor under anti-trust
laws; , ’

0 More state or a national so-
called “right to work” law; .

1 Further restrictions on the
right to strike;

ment in Phelps Dodge is a
long step forward towards
equalizing wage rates in our
industry; The new agreement
also _paves the way for orderly
collective bargaining through-
out the rest of the industry
this Spring.”

Walter C. Lawson, vice-pres-
ident and general manager of
Phelps Dodge, hailed the con-
tract as assurance of stability
and continuity of employment.

He said the company intends
to offer the same early wage
increase and contract formula
to other unions representing
PD employees.

Sudbury Members Adopt New  

Democratic Program for Local

(Special to Mine-Mill Union)

SUDBURY, Ont.—Another rebuff was given the Steel raiders here last month.
At a Mine-Mill Local 598 rally held Jan. 21, more than 4,500 people crowded into the
Sudbury Arena in a massive demonstration of their determination to maintain demo-

cratic control of their own union and send Steel packing.
This was 1n sharp contrast to the “rall

previous week. Featuring
President Claude J odoin of
the Canadian Labor Congress
(AFL-CIO) as the main at-
traction, the gathering was a
flop. with less than 800 mem-
bers of the Steelworkers un-
ion in the audience.

Steel’s International Secre-’

tary-Treasurer I. W. Abel, who
came all the way from Pitts-
burgh to take part in the pro-
ceedings, was visibly disap-
pointed at the turnout.

MINE-MILL’S huge success
climaxed a week of broad rank
and file activity highlighted by
Local 598 membership meet-
ings called by the union’s
Canadian National President
Ken Smith.
The series of meetings
adopted. a sweeping new pro-
gram on policy and bargain-
ing, with its main emphasis on
membership control which
.would insure that power in
the local will never again be
in possession of a few indi-
viduals at the top.

laws to allow more democratic
