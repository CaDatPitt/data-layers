Dear Comrades:‘

The Negro work committee of the Socialist party, appointed at the July meeting _ yr
of the N.E.C., has held a fruitful meeting and calls upon the party members and j‘
“organizations to intensify activity among the colored people.

The September 19 issue of the "Socialist Call" will be especially devoted to
the Socialist approach to Negro problems. Organizations in localities where_ ‘V

‘there are Negroes should make special arrangements to get larger bundle orders ;
of the Call than usual, to be distributed and sold in the Negro districts.

7 The newly revised leaflet "The Negro and Socialism" should be regularly on
g t hand and special distribution in Negro districts should be undertaken between _
‘ N ' now and election day. The leaflet sells for 35¢ for 100, $1.00 for 300. $3.00 ..§
lfor 1000. N ‘ y N ‘ 7

Special efforts should be made to sell the new pamphlet "True Freedom for
Negro and White Workers“ to key people in the Negro communities. (Price:
10¢ each, 8¢ each for 12 or more; 6¢ each for lOO or more.) \

Visits should be made to colored ministers, trade unionists, leaders of the
Workers’ Alliance, social workers and school teachers. These are the most
important leaders of any colored comunities..

Special efforts should be made to supply Negro Socialist speakers for pol- .,
itical symposia.held by colored organizations or in colored neighborhoods.
Wrie to Frank R. Crosswaith, 312 W. 125th St., New_York City,‘about colored
speakers in the east; write national campaign headquarters for the rest of

the country. -o

Only a few sections of the party'are doing their full duty by propagandizing ;J_*
A in colored neighborhoods. We hope through our committee activity to be able '
pto supply material to all local organizations facing the problem of working .‘
with Negroes. It is up to you, comrades, to do the job which has been widely’ _:
neglected and which is of great importance. - I i"
