In 1978, one hundred million
Americans stayed home
on election day.

Why ?

 

 The two-party system is a fraud .

, At election time, the major parties fill the air
j with rhetoric about fairness and democracy.
2 Yet, once in office — whetheron the state, local

or national level — both parties act out the same _

T routine. They open the doors of our public

. treasury to corporate n'p—offs and to the greed of’
a. thousand special interests. When faced with
questiohs of morality and human rights, they
duck and fudge and
address the country’s growing domestic prob-

 lems, the major parties are trying to divert our

; attention to a renewed cold war. In less than a

decade, they have forgotten the lessons of '
Watergate and Vietnam.

 Corporations dictate policy

 Our nation’s leaders tell us the current national
i “malaise” is our fault, or the fault of mysterious
 economic and political forces. We disagree. Our-
problems are rooted primarily in the greed and
growing incompetence of the massive corporate
and bureaucratic institutions that dominate both

zans. They have made a mess of things and it’s
zime to call them to account -

A message from American voters

By not voting, Americans are voting. They are
sending out one clear message:_ we need a new

. Now is the time”

As most Americans now realize, our economic
system is breaking down: _,

.0

Inﬂation threatens the economic survival

of working people, the elderly and small
business.

The prospect of massive unemployment '
grows. It is already widespread among
minorities, women and others ‘who are
"last hired, first ﬁred. ”

Labor unions are targeted for destruction
by corporate interests.

Our energy system is hostage to a handful
of oil companies and their OPE C pa rtn ers. ‘

Nuclear accidents are almost a weekly
occurrence.

Public monies are lavished on wasteful -
military spending while our cities and
rural areas decay and the poor and the
elderly must choose between starving and

if freezing.

These trends will get worse . . . it we waitl

The Citizens'Party — a peace party’. . . a)
common sense approach to rebuilding the
American economy. . '

The Citizens’ Party is a new kind of party. In
the Citizens’ Party, every member-can take
part in developing platforms and choosing
nominees through a democratic, grass,-roots
process —- one in which the platform is a
serious contract between the Party and its
candidates.

We will hold our nominating and_ platform
convention in "Cleveland, Ohio, April 10-13.

We invite all Americans — Democrats,
Republicans, Independents, Non—voters — to
help us develop our platform, gain access to
state ballots, nominate local, state and national
tickets and begin the real politics of the l980’s
with this November’s election.

Ifyou believe that in November the present
two parties will not offer the alternatives
America needs . . . if you want to participate in
an exciting, serious, long-terrn effort to make
American politics meaningful again, then . . .

Join us! Make the Citizens’ Party your
party. Together we can take control over
the economic, social and foreign policy

decisions that affect our lives.
