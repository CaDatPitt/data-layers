 DAVID FRIEDMAN. Leader in community campaigns for
better schools

- Mr. Friedman, teacher of English at Iunior High School 64.
Manhattan, has taught 24 years.

The character of his teaching can be judged from the fact
that he was appointed chairmanof the English department by
four successive principals. He was advisor to the school publi-
cation which won ﬁrst place in a recent nation-wide contest.

He prepared many assembly programs commemorating pa-
triotic holidays which were commended for instilling an under-
standing and love for the most cherished American ideals and
traditions. He has achieved great success with difficult classes
and behavior problems. During the war Mr. Friedman, who was
over age for military service enlisted in the‘New York State
Guard, contributed blood nine times and contributed much
time and money to school and civilian war activities.

Twenty of his colleagues have signed a statement about him
which says, in part, "He has demonstrated devotion to the
principles of his country, and willingness to serve it loyally and
to inspire in his students the finest standards of brotherhood
and democracy . .  Friedman's dismissal from the school
would be a loss to the school, to his colleagues, and to his
students".

The Double Standard

Let us see how Dr. Iansen treats teachers whose conduct in

the classroom and the school is really “unbecoming a teacher".

.... A"/Ulv—f-‘L .. -......

1. SHE TAUGHT AN'I'I-SEMITISM AND  CROW.

Miss May A. Quinn was permitted to remain on the job while

serious charges of her misuse of the classroom were being A

investigated. Her bigoted utterances about the Negro people,
as well as her viciously anti-Semitic conduct a few years earlier,
are too well known to need elaboration here. Yet the Superin-
tendent of Schools, whose ﬁrst comment when the matter was
brought to his attention was: "If Miss Quinn made those remarks
‘about colored people, then her usefulness with the Board is
. ended," changed his mind most drastically and exonerated her

with a mere expression of ”Keen dissatisfaction".'Mr. Leo Sha-

piro, President of the Brooklyn Division of the American Jewish
., ‘Congress, observed that Dr. Iansen's action is "more frighten-
’ " ' g" than that of May Quinn (It) gives me the chills."

  

gl-c§ERNEXPRESSED CON'I'ElVIPT FOR THE FOREIGN

Miss Gladys Laubenheimer was guilty of making anti-Semitic

remarks and slurs against the foreign-bom in her class. It took ‘

months of persistent complaint by parents to get any action, and
then she was transferred to one of the most desirable junior high
schools in the city. '

3. SHE TOLD CHILDREN “GO BACK WHERE YOU
» CAME FROM".

Only a few weeks ago, Dr. Jansen received an official letter
_ from the Parents Association of a school in Washington Heights
asking him to look into an incident in which '1 teacher, Miss

Agnes Driscoll, had terriﬁed her sixth grade pupils by calling a

them "un-American" and "Communist" and telling them that
"a plane leaves the airport every hour," and they had "better
go back where they came from." This unprofessional tantrum
was aroused when a few of the children played some records
by Paul Robeson to accompany a patriotic, historical play they
had written. It is interesting that the teacher approved of both
the play and the songs until the singer was identified by one of
the pupils. The only reply to the parents thus far has been from
an assistant in Dr. Iansen's office to the effect that the letter
would be "called to the Superintendent's attention." That is
where the matter rests.

4. HE FALSIFIED nsconns.

Mr. Charles Pickett, former principal of Samuel Gompers Voca-
tional High School, was found guilty of falsifying attendance rec-
ords in order to be eligible for a salary of $10,000 instead of $8,000
paid to principals of schools with smaller registers. Mr. Pickett
was not dismissed. Instead, he was retired two years early, and.
with typical solicitude, on a pension that was not 50% of the
salary to which he had been entitled, but 50% of the inflated
salary he had secured through his swindling methods.

5. SHE INSULTED IEWISH AND ITAI.I.AN PARENTS.

In February 1948 a large number of parents asked the Board of
Education to investigate their charges that Mrs. Eudora Fletcher.
principal of P.S. 99, Brooklyn, had made anti-Iewish and anti-
Italian remarks to various parents. Nothing was done. The par-
ents have not been able to get any action from the Superinten-

dent or the Board of Education in spite of letters. petitions, and.-

personal visits to 110 Livingston Street.

 SHE INJURED A PUERTO-RICAN CHII.D.

In October, 1949, Mrs. Gladys Mann, when she was a teacher at
PS. 179, Manhattan, shouted at a child, "You dirty Puerto Rican,
why don't you go back where you came from?" She struck and
seriously injured a young Puerto Rican child. Numerous pro-
tests ﬁnally brought about her transfer. No other action has
been taken against her. She is now out of school waiting for
retirement-—but, unlike the eight—she is still on the pay roll.

7. PARENTS COMPLAINED ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM.

12

Parents at P.S. 174 Queens brought to Dr. Iansen documented
evidence of anti-Sernitism on the part of the principal. Dr. Jansen
did not even let them leave the material with him. He made a
vague promise that he would call them in some time. To date
they have not heard from him.

STATEMENT TO THE BOARD OF EDUCATION OF
NEW YORK CITY FROM PROF. IOHN DeBOER.

CHAIRMAN. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. UNI-

VERSITY OF ILLINOIS — May. 1950

"The action of Superintendent Iansenin suspending 8 teachers
for refusing to answer, without counsel, questions regarding
their associations comes as a shock to all Americans who still
cherish freedom of thought and association, and particularly to

_ all educators who regard academic freedom as one of the corner-

stones of our liberties. Security oftenure for teachers of proven
competence is one of the hard-won gains of the teaching profes-
sion. The right of teachers to seek improved conditions of work
and more adequate compensation without fear of reprisal can-
not be surrendered in any school system without threatening
teacher security and freedom everywhere. If teacher leaders can
be suspended for their political beliefs and associations rather
than their teaching competence, it will be possible, especially in
the present period of hysteria, in which blacklisting, slander,
and the threat of imprisonment for dissenters have become com-

_monplace, to destroy all collective efforts on the part of ‘teachers

to raise the standards of teaching. A school system which has
set the dangerous precedent of outlawing the ”Nation,” and
now applies a political test to its leading teachers cannot in sin-
cerity teach the youth the principles of I efferson, lackson or Lin-
coln. I earnestly hope that the New York Board of Education
will reaffirm its faith in American principles and in common

' sense school administration by reversing Superintendent Ian-

sen's arbitrary and vindictive decision respecting the 8 New
York teachers."

THEY FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF ALL TEACHERS

In refusing to participate in the Superintendent's political
inquisition and in insisting that teachers be judgedpn the basis
of their actual performance of their duties, the eight teachers
were defending the rights of all teachers.

To grant the Superintendent the right to ask questions about

a teacher's personal opinions and associations opens the way to ,

every kind of discrimination and abuse of power.

The Superintendent and the Board of Education have them-
selves made it clear that they consider the question "Are you a
Communist?" merely an opening wedge in their attacks on the
civil liberties and tenure rights of teachers. In June, 1948 in a
brief submitted to the State Commissioner of Education. the
Board of Education asked permission to dismiss "disloyal" teach-
ers. These were described as "members of‘ the Communist
Party," "those who for strategic reasons never hold aparty

card." "fellow travelers." The brief also insisted.that a "loyal"

teacher was obliged to "actively support the government" and
also to "instruct and guide the children along the right path" in
zealous support of the "cold war."

Under this declared program any teacher who criticizes gov-
ernment policies in or out of school, who has at any time sup-
ported any policy which in the eyes of a Superintendent Iansen
or a Senator McCarthy might put him in the class of "fellow
traveler," or who believes in education for peace could be called
in and questioned. t

THEY PROTECT THE CHILDREN

14

The children need good and devoted teachers. They need
teachers who have the courage to ﬁght for better schools. They
need teachers who have the courage to insist that the children
are not to be regimented into uncritical acceptance of cold war
hysteria. They need teachers who will ﬁght against allowing
the children to become victims of bigotry. They need teachers
who will by their actions set an example in defending the Bill of
Rights, instead of paying lip-service to it in class and allowing
it to be destroyed by school authorities. '

SINISTEB SCHOOL POGBOM a

Our school system has been taken over by men whose aﬂection

for public education is doubtful; under an administration which

has shown little concern for the welfare of teachers: and in an
era where anti-union activities and anti-Semitism can be roughly
disguised as evidence of "Americanism" and of loyalty.

The eight teachers suspended by Superintendent Iansen for
refusal to answer questions which were none of Iansen's busi-

' nee, oiﬁcially or privately, have several things in common.

They have in common the fact that all are teachers of long
service. i -

They have in common the fact that all are members of the
Teachers Union, and one is president of the union.

They have in common the fact that not one is charged. with any
improper act in teaching.

And they have in common the fact that all eight are Jews.

The suspensions were made on the grounds that these teachers
were insubordinate, and engaged in conduct unbecoming
teachers. " -
vWhat did they do?

They refused to answer questions put to them by Iansen about
their political beliefs—beliefs, mind you—not their classroom
techniques or their classroom teaching—but their beliefs.

In the Sunday Compass, May 7, I950

CI! USE FOB HEHBM

On May 4th eight of the best teachers in the New York City
school system, totaling among them 163 years of ‘exemplary
service and devotion to the children were suspended by Dr.
William Jansen. Superintendent of Schools. Not only are they
among the finest and best loved teachers in our schools, but
they have been among the most active in the fight for better
schools.

At no time has there been such widespread criticism of the
conditions in the New York public schools and such keen dis-
satisfaction with the policies of the Superintendent and the
Board of Education.

Parents grow more concerned each year at the neglect suf-
fered by their children. Retardation in reading, arithmetic, and
other subjects is reaching critical proportions. Teachers struggle
with large classes, lack of equipment, lack of space in old and
even fire-trap buildings, and double and triple sessions.

Parents are alarmed at the effect on their children of hys-

‘ terical war propaganda and a one sided. reactionary approach

to the important issues of the day.

Organizations and individuals have called on the Board of
Education to investigate what has been termed "a cesspool of
bigotry" in our schools. ’

The Bulletin of the Commission on" Christian Social Relations
of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of New York in June, 1949.
called for an investigation of evidence that the Brooklyn Tablet
appears to have a controlling voice in determining the policies
of the Board of Education. (The editor of the Tablet, Father
Edward Lodge Curran, was eastern representative for Father
Coughlin's Social Justice.)

Teachers are involved in a struggle for much needed salary
increases which has taken the unusually courageous and mili-
tant form of a stoppage of extra-curricular activities.

It is against this background of parent concern, teachers‘
struggles, and student unrest that the Board of Education is
attempting to pass the Timone resolution banning the Teachers
Union, the largest organization of teachers in the city, and the
one most active. in its opposition to the ruinous policies of the
Board of Education. ‘

It is within this framework that eight of the most active mem-
bers of the Teachers Union, including its president and secretary,
have been suspended.

‘iflraracter, Fitness, Conduct”

In April Dr. Jansen summoned the eight teachers to inquire
into their "character, conduct, and ﬁtness as teachers" in rela-
tion to "alleged association with the Communist Party." Their
request for the right to have counsel present was denied. Every
effort to have the Superintendent mention a single instance in
which their "character, conduct, and fitness as teachers" had
ever been questioned or criticized was unsuccessful. This is so
because the Superintendent cannot produce any evidence of
unsatisfactory work or conduct in the records of any of these
teachers. The teachers refused to participate in the inquiry.

On May 4th these teachers. considered among the best in

the school system, were suspended on charges of "insubordi-
nation" and "conduct unbecoming a teacher."

ABRAHAM IJEDERMAN. President of the Teachers Union

Mr. Lederman, a mathematics teacher at Junior High School
64, Manhattan, has been in the school system for 23 years (in-
cluding three years in the army). He is the only classroom
teacher on the standing committee on Junior High School Mathe-
matics of the Board of Education. His contributions to the teach-
ing of mathematics have been praised by teachers, principals
and superintendents. His faculty elected him chairman of their
Teachers’ Council.

In sworn testimony before a Congressional Committee in
September, 1948, Superintendent Iansen called his work "very
satisfactory". Dr. Jansen was then asked, "You have never had
any suspicion that they (the officers of the Union) were teaching
leftist doctrines to the children?" He replied, "None of the
officers, no."

As president of the Teachers Union he has led in cam-
paigns for higher salaries, veterans'_ rights, and school appro-
priations.

His pupils are very much upset by his suspension. One child
wrote him, "I write you these few lines to let you know that
all of the class is sorry to know you had to go out of school.
I think I will never be able to forget you. I hope you will come
back to school."

CELIA LEWIS ZITRON. Secretary of the Teachers Union

Mrs. Zitron, a teacher of Latin at Washington Irving High
School, has taught for 27 years. Every supervisory report praises
her highly. She has been especially commended for "her inspira-
tion and guidance of her students".

In 1930 she introduced the study of Hebrew at the Abraham
Lincoln High School and gave all her free time—even during

York City).

The sentiments of students are expressed in a letter received
after her suspension, "We have never had the opportunity be-
fore to tell you what a ﬁne person and worthwhile teacher
you are".

As chairman of the Academic Freedom Committee of the

Teachers Union, Mrs. Zitron has often led in the defense of
teachers unjustly persecuted by educational authorities.

CITRON. Member oi the Teachers Union Executive Board

Miss Citron, a teacher at P.S. 184,/Manhattan has taught for

eighteen years in Harlem. She has fought for equal opportunities
for Negro children and against every form of Jim Crow all these
years. Not only the children, but their parents love her. The
president of the P. T. A. at P. S. 184 and other parents say "We
love Alice Citron because she has fought for us and our chil-
dren. She has been more than a teacher to our children. She's
been their friend - - - she's one of the best teachers in our dis-
trict. Why she even comes to homes to help slow children. And
she puts her hands in her own pockets to help buy shoes and
get dental care for needy children".

48 of the 55 teachers at P. S. 184, including the principal,
wrote to Dr. Iansen, "We wish to state without reservation that
Miss Citron has worked tirelessly in behalf of the welfare of the
children in our school. Not only is she an outstanding teacher,
but a particularly gifted one. We are deeply concerned when
people of this caliber can be asked to prove their fitness for
their position". ' A ‘

Dr. Frederick Kershner, Dean of the School of Religion at

"It would seem that the New York school authorities want to
compel their teachers to deny all possibilities of avoiding World
War 3, and to instruct their pupils that we must engage in armed

on behalf of the pupils. teachers and the country.

"During the war period he organized single-handedly a suc-

ISADORE RUBIN. Co-Chairman. Teachers Union Political Action

Committee

Mr. Rubin, a teacher of English‘ at Manual Training High
School has had 13 years of service in the public schools.

As a combat soldier in Italy he won first prize in an essay
on "What Victory Means to Me". His essay was broadcast by
Walter Huston over a ‘national hook-up. It was cited in the
New York Times as the best expression of the hopes of our
fighting soldiers. It was reprinted in pamphlet form by the
American Jewish Congress. - A

Once before, in 1948, Mr. Rubin was tried on charges of "con-
duct unbecoming a teacher", arising from his participation in
the picket line of a sister union. District Superintendent Victor
Burger who was trial examiner and who recommended the
harsh penalty of a $1,250 ﬁne, nevertheless had to admit that

Isadore .Rubin's record was one ”of exemplary conduct and

school service. His war record is a shining example of true
American patriotism".

WHAT VICTORY MEANS TO ME

At the moment it is difficult to think of victory as
meaning anything but an end to tear, to loneliness and
death, and a chance to go back to pick up the strands
of interrupted lite.

Hencetorth each simple pleasure, each right we
always took so lightly will take on rich meaning. We
know what it cost to keep them and we know, too, that
we have already earned a share in them.

But victory means much more.

With victory we stand on the threshold of limitless
inventions and comforts; we possess the resources to
extend _ our horizons in every field of endeavor and
every aspect of human relations.

However, ancient and stubborn enemies are still to
be conquered, enemies which must be overcome not by
armies but by minds and hearts and talents set, wholly
free. Such enemies are poverty, insecurity, prejudice,

' disunity.

These, too, shall be conquered, for we have begun to
think more deeply and more dynamically, and it we can
sweep aside untold obstacles to smash the most ruth-
lessly efficient machines of destruction ever devised,
surely we possess the vision and practical genius to or-
ganize for peace, security and a world designed for
living.

Till now many have ruled because of accident of
birth or wealth, but throughout the world, the unlit, the
weaklings and the traitors are falling by the wayside.
New leaders are rising from the people — those who
never sold their heritage of courage, faith and simple
human dignity. '

With victory we shall have destroyed those who
would have enslaved the world. Our sacrifices have

. been great but we have won the opportunity to emerge

from the animal kingdom and enter the kingdom of man.

I look forward to living in such a world.
