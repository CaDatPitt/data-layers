MIAMI, ARIZONA: The summer
months have seen a steady hum of
activity in and around the union hall

5 of Miami Miners Union, Local 586.

R’ ;It‘ all started off with a bang when

A’  the union's soft ball team won the asso-
‘Wciation trophy in Gila county.

Then came August 4," the day that‘
the members at the Globe-Miami Laun-
dry and Dry Cleaners went out on

‘Z strike for recognition and’ the re- _

instatement of some-members who had

been fired‘. ‘At this writing, these wom-

en are stilliwalking the picket line.

During the first few days of the
strike the laundry. obtained a tempo-'

‘ rar ‘injunction - against the. Miami

Miners Unionand the striking laundry
workers, but when the hearing came up
he went into court and found the court

-house filled. to over-flowing with min-

ers and smeltermen. He immediately

withdrew the injunction. - ,

‘ SINCE THAT TIME he has been
threatening to close the laundry and
go out of business. The strikers say
that unless he recognizes the union and
puts all the v_women back to work he is ‘

' already out" of business, and will stay
"out of business. ' ' ‘

iThe membership have voluntarily

— assessed themselves one dollar each

Week to, feed and take care of the
strikers until such time as they win.

I’ it During this time negotiations were,

going on with the copper companies, all

~ of which have now been settled, includ-
V ing the pension plan at Miami Copper.

.' In addition-to the “pattern”. settle-
ment, negotiations have brought sev-
eral upward job reclassifications of 48
cents per day. It also resulted in all
men qualifying for their third week’s
vacation receiving three extra days’
vacation this year, even ‘though they
may have had their two weeks’ vacation
before June 30.

Political conference

On August 17 ‘a state—wide political
conference was sponsored by Miami
Miners Union, attended by delegates
from every local in Arizona as Well as
delegates fromthe Bayard (N.M.) Dis-
trict Union. '

Several candidates endorsed by this

conference were victorious in the pri-

mary electionon Sept. 9. One of the
most important posts won was that of
State Mine Inspector. v This was won
by the candidate supportedlby this con-
ference, Edward Massey, an old time

. Hard Rock Miner.

‘L Several county offices were filled by
candidates supported by the Miami

»Miners, including the Gila county treas-

urer’s office, several members of the

' state legislature. '

TO TOP OFF the season’s activities,
theVMiami Miners staged’ a huge Labor
Day celebration.“ George Blair, vice-
president of the local union, as overall
chairman of the Labor ‘Day activities,
and , numerous committees, worked

5 weeks preparing for this event.

‘Splendid co‘-operationiwas given by
the merchants and business men of the
area throughout the entire time in pre-
paring and staging the celebration. Al-
most every merchant and businessman
in the Globe—Miami area made finan-
cial contributions; the men on the job
contributed money as well as time. The
companies all made financial contribu-
tions. Some of the -business people
supplied public address systems and

  
 
   

 _;~ -1 s.

 

ws

other equipment necessary to stage the
show.

Included among the activities that

"day was a drilling‘ contest, a mucking

contest, a washer pitching contest. For
the children there were free rides on a
miniature train, foot races, bicycle
races, ball throwing contestand many
other events. The drilling and muck-
ing contest were the main attractions,
because of the big," cash prizes. The 1st
prize in the drilling contest was $125,
2nd prize: $75 and 3rd'prize $50.

Prize winners
First .priz__e was won ‘by D. H. Ches-

ley, an employee of the Miami Copper

Company, Frank Ellsworth was 2nd
prize winner and Coy F. Knight 3rd

prize.

In the mucking contest, M. E. Eberle
and W. G. Jackson tied for 1st and 2nd
place and D. H. Chesley won 3rd place.
Jackson and Eberle each received

$62.50 and Chesley $25. First prize in
the Washer pitching was taken by. M. E.
Eberle and Blackie Elliott for $25, and
Joe Valentine and R. H. Hayhurst
took 2nd place -for $15.

. Then- there were other activities, a
bingo game’ going all day, also a dart

game, food and’d_rink‘stands'to provide

food and drinks for the huge crowd
that attended the affair. All during
the day various candidates for office,
both county and state, were introduced
and said a few words to the ﬁople.

' The Gila Broadcasting Company pro’-
vided a 15-minute program over a 7-
station hookup on«Friday before Labor
day. This was free as a courtesy of the
local radio station, KWJB. All in all,
_it was the most colorful and the,big-
gest labor day celebration ever staged
by the Miami -Miners Union.

Mccurran petitions

A campaign is under way to get peti-
tions signed to send .Senator«Patrick
McCarran, protesting the hearing he

i‘ has scheduled for October 7- and 8."

Hundreds of names have been secured
in the first few days. J , .
This local. union has already -gone
on record as condemning this actionby
the Senator, from Nevada and will
probably take much‘ stronger action as
the time ofthe hearings draws closer.
To some of the membership of this
Interhational Union, the program’ of
concentration camps is: much more than
just talk. Not many miles from Miami

"is the concentration camp at Florence,

Arizona. Most- of our members have

at onetime or another had an oppor-
tunity to drive by and take a look at it.
They realize that it wasn’t built for

BOSTON, Mass.—The McCarran-
Walter immigration law was con-
demnednlast week by two members of
Congress from this state as “unAmeri-
can, /vicious, discriminatory . . . un-
Ch'risticin.” A
A At a" hearing, before a special ‘com-
mission on immigration. and natural-
ization, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge,
Republican, and Rep. John Kennedy,
Democrat, led the attack on the Mc-
Carran—Walter act.»

“This bill,” said Kennedy, who seeks ‘

to unseat Lodge as senator, ‘_‘is un-
American and di_sc'rimina.to'ry. It
virtually freezes iminigration fvrom

_,,eastern and southern Europe and the

glediterrcmean area, and sets u
cwricrs which did not fomnerly exist
‘Lodge argued; “No- concept has
fastened into our immigration laws
such a, vicious and odious fallacy that
the peoples of southerrn" Europe are

somehow inferior to their neighbors.”

Senator Herbert L e h m a n (Dem.
,N.Y.) drew attention to the “inequities
‘and iniquities” of thenew 1aw’s penal-
ties against naturalized citizens. He

beauty nor for any other purpose ex-

cept to, put people in. They‘ also realized.

that they don’t need this big camp and
10 others just for a few top union ‘offi-

- dials, but for anyone who would dare

question what goes on or demand a de-

cent living out of thehuge profits of =

the copper companies and other huge
corporations of today.

 ayard strike f‘leClCle—l‘S—

released on habeas corpus
: BAYARD, N; M.—On October ,1, five of the six jailed leaders of
Mine-Mill Local 890 were released on a writ of habeas corpus executed
by the Chief Justice of the‘ Supreme Court of New Mexico- Basis. for
this action was a writ of error filed onsbehalf of the union, pointing
out thatnmen can not legally be jailed for violation of a court injunction

_ after the injunction has been removed. - : ,
 j The following was written in jail by Int’l Rep. Clinton J encks, whp

\

will not be released until October 6_becai1se of another sentence he was

serving concurrently with the “contempt” sentence.

J encks was in solitary confinement, in a cell 21/2 by 6 feet, without
exercise privileges, and without the same ‘visitor privileges ‘as other
1 inmates. Light was so poor that he could not read,,and could barely

. see to write.

~ «-By Clint Jencks

On Friday, September 5, .1952, eight
‘months after the bitter fifteen month
'.Empire Zinc strike was settled, Ernest
Velasquez, .Vincente Becerra, Pablo
Montoya, Fred Barreras, Cipriano Mon-
toya and Clink Jencks were sent to jail
for 90 days by District Judge A. W.
Marshall for civil contempt of court.
The defendants were all members of
the E-Z negotiating -committee during
the long strike. .

Apparently thesemen were selected
by the New Jersey Zinc Company, the
’ arty pressing court action, with they
dea that an attack on the six would
smash the strike. ,

However, as matters developed, this
idea on the part of the company and
other enemies of the union.was wrong.
Union men, women and children from

the entire di§trict saw that New Jersey , .

Zinc’s union-busting, strike—busting ef-
forts were a threat to their own living
standards and to the union they had
. built in recent years. These men, wom-
. en and children saved the strike an
the union. . , A ~
NO ONE LIKES to go to jail, but it
is an honor to go to jail defending
,what is right and. just. Jailing our
union leaders will not .make any mem-
ber of Local 890,‘ including the six in
. Silver City prison cells, give up the-
~  fight.

It only increases the determination —

of all of us- to battle harder; to change

a situation where the selfish private

interests of companies are put before
the welfare of the general public;

Andsfight we will..In a democracy.

‘ the government, the courts,‘ officers of

the law and the companies,. them- .

selves, should’ serve the needs of the
people . . . as servants; not as mas-
ters. , Working ‘people ‘have given of-
their labor and often suffered and died
to make this kind of "democracy. Great
.  '-progress has been made, thanks to the
‘ courage of those who gave so much.
But today the companies are trying
hard to wipe out our- gains, to press
us back-. .
”‘ BIG BUSINESS (bigger than we can
even imagine) has brought up a whole
battery of big guns to fire on us.

These weapons include the Taft-Hart-
ley Law, the Smith Act, the McCarran
Act, the McCarran-Walter Immigra-
tion Act, the concentration" camps,
strike-breaking injunctions, “loyalty.”
oaths, witch-hunting congressional
committees, unlimited company profits
and the whole patterntof high prices
and ‘taxes we must pay today". ’

We six who are in jail ask you, the
people, ourfriends, our brothers and
sisters, to take warning from this in-

‘justice. We must learn to recognize
these weapons. Then we have to make
our government representatives know
that we insist ‘on, turning back to de-
mocracy.’

Replace enemies. in public life
with persons who will serve all of the
people, who will guard us from special
"business interests who seek to live off
the labors of others.

There are hundreds of union men and -
women in jail or facing jail in Amer- ,

ica today. They come from the AFL,
CIO and many independent unions- We
have to work to set them free, too.
IN ADDITION to our ‘own problems,
there are thousands more in the jails
of other countries. Money talks and it
is talking in those countries. Greek
union leaders are being shot in Greece
with the approval of our own admin-
istration in Washington. ‘Thousands of
. men and women- are jailed in South
Africa for opposing racial segregation
and discriminlftion, and our own U. S.
_ government oans $80 million dollars
to the nazi-like officials who do the
jailing. '

“New Jersey Zinc is ‘a short-sighted ‘_

. loser. Without doubt, this company has
gained the contempt of most of th
people of this district. . .

The. New Jersey-» Zinc‘ Company
charged almost 1% million dollars in
1951 strike-expenses against its. taxes,
taxes due the government. This is a

“tax loophole given by congress to the
rich. Now "after. taking money out of
the U. S. Treasury as a reward for
strike-breaking, New Jersey Zincwants
the Union to pay it $38,000‘more. 1

YET I SAY,we are the winners be-
cause they have shown us the way ‘we
must go. They have opened our eyes,
where before we could not see. '

Carrying out the convention’s deci-

, lating our union’s petition against the

McCarran committee inquisition; are
selecting a delegation to the Union’s
Political Action Conference in Salt
Lake City; and have invited interna-
tional officers to a Chicago mass meet-
ing to put “McCarran on trial.” The
local also intends to send a delega-
tion to Washington, D. C., on Oct. 16,
when Bus. Mgr. James Pinta is sched-
uled to appear before the Un-American
Committee.. . ‘
.Brother Pinta/was originally sub-
penaed to appear in Chicago Sept. ‘8,

but this was cancelled when the Un-

American Committee was forced -to
cut short its stay in Chicago by the
chilly reception it got from Chicago
workers, who picketed the committee-
by the hundreds and stood firm in- the
plants.

CHARLESTON

CHARLESTON, S. C.—A work stop-
page by Lacal 863 at the plant of F. S.
Royster Company’ has resulted in re-
instatement of a fired worker‘ and the
smashing of a speed-up scheme.

Mack Kelly, the man who was fired,
had told’ his foreman he could not do
his work and that of a former helper
who had been laid off. The foreman
fired’ Kelly. 1 A

James Wilson, president of the local,
called the committee together and took
up the firing with'management. -When
this did not bring results, a plant meet-
‘ing was called, and by decision of the
workers, the superintendent was in-
formed that no one would go back
to work until Kelly was put baclron
his job with pay for time lost and‘ with
a helper. «

After blustering and threatening to
sue. the union, the company gave. in to
the union’s demands.

Commenting on the victory, Wilson
said: . -~ i ‘

“These workers will not let the com-
pany or the McCarran committee de-
stroy their union.” *

Committee members were James
Wilson, Israel Wright; James Wright,
assisted by Int’l Rep. Jesse Doster.

TRADE UN1oNs AN» commas

One of the guest speakers at the Mine-Mill 48th convention in New
York was the distinguished scholar and historian, Dr. W. E. B. Dnbois.
Our delegates wereoso impressed with his analysis of the inter-relations
of industry and workers around the world-—of why the welfare of
workers on other continents affects ’ll«8.—Ifll(1.If”I77.(L’l’Ljl/ asked for the com-
plete text of the speech. This was supplied to delegates in 7ni1neo-

graphed form.

THE UNION is reprinting Dr. Dubois’ address so that all ni_ein-
bers may read it. It will be in two sections, of which this is the first.

0 T

T is a singular fact that until recent-
ly labor union have felt no interest in
colonial problems. The reasons are ob-
vious. Colonial peoples are strangers
to the average American or British
worker: they are strange in appear-
ance, in color and hair; stranger in
cultur_e—in clothes and homes: in lan-
guage and religion; in folkways. They
easily appear as curiosities and cari-
catures.

This is the reason that when labor
came into political control of Great
Britain little change was reflected in
the colonial policy of the Empire. It

was still based on ignorance, poVe1'ty
and disease for black and brown, out
of which came luxury and power for
the rich and high wage for white la-
bor. '

In the United States,‘ the millions

of yellow, brown and colored Workers
of colonial countries have had little.

effect on thought or policies. When
the American trade unions withdrew
from the. World Federation, few of
their members knew that one under-

‘lying reason was because the white

British unions wanted to control and
speak for the colored unions, while the
Africans wanted independent voice and

action. We joined Britain in rejecting '

this demand.

HOWEVER, in our own nation, an
analogous demand that Negroes, liv-
lng then chiefly in the South, be ‘eith-
er denied union membership or segre-
gated, began to disappear before Ne-
gro migration “north and their entrance
into industrial competition. with white
Workers. Then came the discovery that
Negroes were men as good or bad as

-other men and as Worthy ‘of union

brotherhood.

But the labor movement now comes
to another phase of this same prob-
lem and that is their future relation
to other colored workers around the
world. And this is no academic prob-
lem of no immediate interest. White
and black workers of the world are
still separated and unacquainted, but
not nearly so widely as 100 years ago.

But if physical distance has lessened,
industrial ties of work and wage, of
trade ‘and commerce, have equally
clamped the imperial_poWers and the
colonial World together. This is true
in food supply and clothing, but espe-
cially in metals.

METALS are the basis of civiliza-
tion. Primitive man used stone, wood_
and bone for tools and weapons, ;but
started on the roadto civilization when
copper and iron, gold and silver, bronze
and brass came into knowledge and
use. Their discovery and use made his-
tory; Alexander became great on the
mines of Thrace; Carthage dominated
the. Mediterranean through the mines

of North Africa and ‘Spain and Rome
’ conquered Carthage to secure her min-

eral wealth. The Holy Roman’ Empire
was built on the Spanish control of

the mines and minerals of the Ameri-

(338.

Today metals are indispensable for
three uses: structure as in the case of
iron; transmission of power, as in the
case of copper; and chemicals as in
the case of petroleum oil. 0 i

_ The increase in the use of these ma-
terials during this century has been
amazing; pig iron has increased in use
from a half million tons in 1900 to
pver 100 million today; copper from
18,000 tons to two million. This shows
not only miraculous increase in the
industrial use of metals from wells and
mines, but the way in which a new
World of industry and labor is threaded
together. A

OF THE BONDS of industry you
are more or less aware-—ten groups
control the copper of the world; despite

A owning of our iron mines we imported

three million ,.tons in 1930 and much

more in 1950. We import minerals of *

every kind which laborers of other

nations and continents mine, dig and
process. Those laborers are your col-
leagues and fellow workers. What you
earn depends on what they earn. Their
standards of living indirectly determine
yours. -

The greatest reserves of copper in
the world are in Africa; the iron around
Lake Superior is 50% pure, but the
iron which we are just beginning‘ to
import from Liberia is 70% pure and
the ledge from which its fabulous sup-
ply comes is leased for 80 years to an
American corporation.

Negroes who mineuthis iron get less

than a dollar a day and have no union.
The copper miners , of Rhodesia have

a small union and recently struck for.

$2 a day and won only a part of their
battle. Out of South Africa, which our
consul in 1950 called the most promis-
ing nation of the world, Negroes work-
ing, under prison conditions furnish
the world with gold and diamonds at
less, than a_ dollar aﬁday.

Our vast oil reserves are being de-
pleted, but the oil of Venezuela and
most of the Near East belong to Amer-
ican businessmen, and we are gambling

desperately for the oil of Iran, where’

the Workers are ignorant, diseased and
miserably poor.

ALL THIS is your problern’?*Once the
trade unions of the civilized world
thought that they had no interest in
colonies and colonial peoples. As part‘
of the twhite imperial world they
thought to share the profits which or-

ganized industry sucked out of these .

unfortunates at low wages, underpriced
materials and no expense for educa-
tion or suppression of disease. Even
then, the /wage of workers. in Britain
and the right to vote in America were
paid for by war and taxes.

In the 100 years between 1817 and‘

1917, there took place in the world
204 wars. The victims of those wars-
the killed, crippled and insane; the im-
poverished and hopeless, were mainly
from the working classes of theworld,
and the reasons for the fighting were
mainly greed, avarice, cupidity, or
ruthless desire for private gain at any
cost to public welfare;

hat hecho creerxdurante mucho tiempo
que la gente colonial y de color son do

desde luego ellosv son ‘inteligentes y

Hoy se esta probando que esa teoria
es falza, que el sumergir en la ignor-

ayuda en nada a otro, de lo contrario
lo devilita. Asi pues esel deber y la
