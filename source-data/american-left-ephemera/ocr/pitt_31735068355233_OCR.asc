 

 Iron King Workers

Choose Mine-Mill

HUMBOLDT, Ariz. —— Mine-Mill won the bargaining . 

rights for some 225 workers at the Iron King Mine here

on March 25, defeating in an NLRB election the Unitedgﬁ:

Steelworkers of America who had represented the prop-

erty for the past six years.

The vote was 97 to 85, with three “no union” votes
and five challenged votes in the total of 190 that were

cast.

This is the first time that Mine-Mill will represent
the underground mine , which produces lead, zinc, copper,

and silver and is owned by the
Shattuck-Denn Mining Company.

Many Gripes with Steel
' District 2 Board Member
Maelovio R. Barraza, who di-
rected the organizational cam-
paign, said that major com-
plaints against the Steelworkers
‘included violations of seniority,
inability to process grievances,
and the. failure to help elimi-
nate the numerous safety haz-
ards at the mine.

, The mine lacked proper vent-
ilation—a condition aggravated

. by the company's practice of

blasting at any time during the

C ~ shift. There was only one way

in and out of the mine. In ad-
dition to these safety problems,
. miners were being fired at an
average of three or four a week.

Strike in 1962

,A 66-day strike in 1962 had
resulted in a weak settlement
which was approved only after
Steel ‘had threatened‘ to’ end
strike support.

Mine-Mill filed its petition for‘
. an election ~-on “March 4, ’ with

more than 70 percent of the
workers signed up on authoriza-
tion cards.

The million-member United

tion, again has_come- to the
defense of ‘Mine-Mill.

“We oppose,” the resolu-

ernmental harassment of the
International Union of Mine,
Mill, and Smelter Workers.”

Two years ago, the UAW
also passed such a resolution,
saying, “The civil liberties of
that union must be protected
in the interest of insuring the
civil liberties of all unions.”

  Union in F ul Swing  

Preparing to Bargain

With all major companies in non-ferrous metals facing the happy prospect of an
even bigger boom year than the banner 1956, Mine-Mill locals throughout the country,
joint negotiating committees, and bargaining councils this month moved into high gear
on preparations for the upcoming contract talks. ~ ‘

As the Mine-Mill Union goes to press, there are numerous signs in the copper
market indicating additional price increases there. This development has been forecast

by several trade and financial journals.

(See story on page 3.)

Increased production, rising prices, a11d reduced taxes all spell mushrooming
profits for the companies, whose major problem these days is how to clamp a lid on
those prices until labor negotiations are over.

Mine-Mill is just about ready to go with its industry-wide bargaining program
as it approaches the official May 1 opening date of all major contracts. Here’s what

Barraza following the election in which Mine-Mill won
bargaining rights for the 225 workers at the company's

Iron King mine in Humboldt.

  Truck Drivers Win Back
  Pay in N.M. Arbitration

SANTA -RITA, N.M.——About 65 production truck drivers at ,Kennecott’s open pit
copper mine here will receive time and a half pay for some extra 30 hours each" has
worked since last fall. The back pay is an arbitration award handed down last month
by Byron E. Guse of Albuquerque, who also said that the drivers must be given 30-
minute paid lunch periods for the duration of the contract which expires on June 30.

Last August 14, the company had unilaterally instituted 20-minute lunch breaks,
even though drivers for years had been taking 30 minutes for lunch and the contract
states that “present practice in regard to meal periods shall be maintained.” The over-

 .time pay awarded is for the extra 10 minutes



,-

since that time.

per shift that each driver had worked

‘Arthur Flores, Luis Gomez Jr., and Albert Millan Jr., witnes_ses for Mine-Mill

Local 890 at a January hearing, testified that the driv

. for‘, lunch until the company
order in August. They stated
that the practice had not been
an’ issue until 1957, at which
time the company began to try
to get the allotted -time reduced.

,From Rail to Trucks
’ Priorto that year, most of
‘the haulage of ore and waste
at the open pit was done by rail,
and few trucks were involved.
«The union representatives con-
’-.teIided that in "1957" the‘ com-
pany began to think about con-
verting the entire ioperation to

I _ — trucks, making it more efficient

and economical. V _,
 Some trucks were introduced
-as part of the continuous opera-
tion at Kennecott’s Chino Mines

 ‘Division _in 1952. As in all con-
 tinuous operations, the employee
[ must eat when it least inter-

feres, with the work. ~ In ex-

' fchange_ for the meal period hav-

ers had always taken 30 minutes

, ing to beflexible, the worker is‘

paid for the time.

S. Q. Merino, president of the
Amalgamated Bayard District
Union, testified that in October,
1957, when he was chairman of
the grievance committee, the
truck drivers on the day shift
were told verbally to take 20-
minute lunch periods. He said,
however, that the drivers were
told by the mine superintendent

at a subsequent meeting, to con- 2

tinue taking 30 minutes until he
had checked with“, other com-
pany officials.“
No Change in C,o,ni'racl"
Since that time, the~issue reg-
ularly had come up in negotia-
tions, but the union always re-

A fused to allowthelunch period

to be shortened. Contract lan-

guage remained the same-

“Present practice .

. . shall be
maintained.” , -

Last year, the company did A

convert from rail to trucks, and,
in July, asked the union to ne-
gotiate over the lunch period
because of the problems in-
volved. The proposal was
turned down by the member-
ship of the local after much
discussion.
It was not until last fall that
the conversion was completed.
With 58 truck drivers then
"working, the company took its
unilateral action of shortening
the lunch period. The union ad-
vised its membership to comply
with the posted instructions,
pending arbitration of the issue,

Sliutout Scored
IIINLRB Election

BEDFORD, Ohio —_ Mine-Mill
gained bargaining rights at the

.Federal Metal Company early

this month in an election which
saw the Doll and Toy Workers,
previous bargaining agent at the
plant, get no votes. Mine-Mill
had 46 votes, while one worker
voted for neither union.

A producer of brass and

- bronze ingots, the company had

become a union shop only a few
years ago, when an agreement
was signed providing a 5 cents
an hour increase the first year,
no increase the second year, and
3 cents the third. The Doll and
Toy Union, Local 56, failed to

conduct educational work in the ,

plant or to assist in grievance
settlements. _
A year ago, an unauthorized

< strike resulted in the discharge

of the entire leadership. When
the union made no real effort In

. the fight for their reinstatement,

the workers appealed to Mine-
Mill to represent_ them. It was
not until this year that an elec-
tion could be held, which took
place on April 6.

The company put on an exten-
sive campaign for a “neither
union” _vote, sending out “Dear
John” letters to all employees,
attacking Mine-Mill, and infer-
ring that the company might
move to another location should

Mine-Mill win the election. Com-

pany representatives talked to
each employee individually, in
an effort to stave off defeat.
The workers now are eagerly
preparing for contract negotia-
tions with the company. _ ,_
Key members of the orgamz-

L ing committee were Willie Walk- ‘
_, er, Joseph Smith, E d w a 1' (1

House, John Henderson, and

er in the plant who was -fired
during the wildcat strike of ‘a

THE MINLE-MILL UNION Aprn.f iisf-1,

 

’ Butte Mines Closed as
Rail Unions Walk Out

BUTTE, Mont.—A strike by
73 members of the Brotherhood
of Railway Trainmen against
the Butte, Anaconda and Pacific
Railway closed Anaconda’s open
pit and underground mines here
and its smelter in Anaconda for
10 days this month, and threat-
ened to curtail production at the
Great Falls refinery.

’ Just as a settlement -appeared
completed on April 14, six non-
operating railroad brotherhoods

. walked out——the carmen, main-

 " tenance of way workers, dis-

patchers, sheet metal workers,
boilermakers and blacksmiths.
. As the Mine-Mill Union goes to
. K, = press, 4,000 Butte miners and
‘ 6 millmen are still idled, as are

1,300 workers at Anaconda.
-The railroad is an Anaconda
subsidiary that hauls copper
— concentrate the 26 miles from
Butte to the Anaconda smelter.

However, operation of the com-
pany’s new $50 million copper
concentration plant in Butte,
which began late last year, has
made it unnecessary to trans-
port the ore from the mines to
the old mill in Anaconda.

At issue in the strike by the
BRT was the resultant layoff of
operating and service crews on
the railroad. Employment of
train operating crewmen, mem-
bers of the Brotherhood of Loco-
motive Firemen and Engine-
men, has been cut from about
400 to 170 in recent months,
while two-thirds of the men
,working on ground crews, BRT
members, have been thrown out
of work. The union’s demands
included job protection meas-
ures, pensions, severance pay,
and retraining of laid-off, em-
ployees.

Heart Attack Victim Back on Job 6

NEWARK, N.J..—Michael Woods of Local 482, who had worked

v for the Barth Smelting and Refining Company for over 20 years
as a mason, was rehired last month and given full back pay for

the period during which the company had refused to reemploy him.

The action was the result of an arbitration award handed down

by Monroe Berkowitz—-an arbitration that Board Member Alfred

 Petit-Clair called “one of the
most important in the past few
years.”

Woods’
were the basis on which the
company had refused to rehire
him. The company admitted
that, in such cases, it would
like to reduce industrial risk and
make some savings on insur-
ance costs.

A heart specialist, testifying
in behalf of Woods, pointed out,
at the hearing that, although
damage was incurred, Woods
was still capable of doing a nor-
mal day’s work. The arbitrator
ruled that the contract “permits

three heart attacks‘

a discharge only for just cause
and an injury or sickness sus-
tained by an employee is not
sufficient ‘cause for his dis-
charge.”

Petit-Clair, in pointing out that
many companies have been re-
fusing to rehire employees who
have suffered heart damage,
said that the decision “is of the
utmost importance to all older
employees who have spent years
in our shops and now may be
faced with health problems.”

Clarence Talisman, a local at-
torney, handled the ‘case for
Newark Amalgamated Local.

Producers Trying to Hold Registration Is Key  
Off Further Price Increase

  rut. MINE-MILL UNION

Prospects are growing that the producer price of copper, hiked last month for
the first time in nearly three years from 31_to 32 cents a pound, may“be raised again-.
So said the April 13 Wall Street Journal, which earlier had reported, Producers hope
to hold the price line to avoid entering _1abor negotiations this summer with a fat price
boost that might encourage higher union wage demands.’ . .

Increasing use of copper by industry and in construction and s.ome.stockpil1ng of
copper products by consumers have created a tight copper supply situation in the U.S.

T and abroad. -

All U.S. major copper producers are rationing copper to their customers; Ana-
conda, for example, has cut shipments through May by 20 percent of orders placed.
Although major producers have held thus far.to the 32-cent per_pound price,
copper prices on other markets are shooting up 1"aP1d1Y- F01" F-‘Xample In mld-APP115
0 New York dealers reported sales at 40 cents and up. »

0 Copper for May and July delivery on the New York Com-
modity Exchange was quoted at over 39 cents.

0 On the London Metal Exchange, copper sold at 391/2 cents.

O No. 2 copper scrap in the U. S. was selling at 32-321/2 cents,
equivalentto 371/2-38 cents refined for delivery in July. _

Pressure for an increase in major producers’ price 1S becom-
ing more difficult to resist. The Chilean government is_reported
to be dissatisfied with Kennecott’s and Anaconda’s selling price
in Europe of 301/2 cents per pound for Chilean copper,‘ and is in-
sisting that this price be brought more in line with prices on the
London Metal Exchange.

In the U. S., American Sinelting and Refining Company can-
not long continue selling refined copper for what it is now pay-
ing for scrap copper. It isn’t in the refining business for free.

Copper producers face a dilemma. The Chilean government
is pressuring the two largest producers to raise their prices, and
all producers would like to cash in on higher prices. On the other

-,hand, to raise prices now would make it more difficult for them

to resist Mine-Mill’s 1964 bargaining demands.

Every one cent copper price increase means an increase in
before tax profits of copper companies under contract with Mine-
Mill of more than $37 million a year.

Here’s a list of copper producers’ 1963 before-tax profits and

. extra profits per year that will result from every one cent price

hike. Extra profits are calculated on the basis of copper mine
production alone:

y Brass mill subsidiaries of the big copper producers also should
swell the profit totals of such parent companies as Anaconda,
Phelphs Dodge, Kennecott and AS&R this year. Production will
reach an all time high in 1964, at a time when prices of brass mill
products‘ have been shooting up much faster than copper prices.
For example, there have been four price boosts on copper and
brass tube and pipe thus far in 1964, totaling 61/2 to 8 cents per
pound, compared with a one-cent increase in copper price. Brass
rod prices have been increased twice this year, and virtually all
other brass mill products are up. This doesn’t tell the whole story,
since discounts of one-half cent or more under the listed price,
common last year, have disappeared.

Politcal Action
Group Formed
For Gila County

Elias C. Lazarin Jr. of the
Miami Miners Union Local 586
has been chosen chairman of
the recently-formed Gila County
Mine-Mill political action com-
mittee, which will coordinate
the political and legislative ac-
tivities of the three locals in
the Arizona county—-586, and
Locals 886 and 939 in Hayden.

The committee, which will
meet at least once a month,
will carry on voter registration
drives within each local union
and in the communities at
large. For this purpose, some
members of the group will be
deputized as voter registrars.

Candidates fo-r county offices
will be screened by the commit-
tee, which hopefully will ob-
tain joint endorsements of can-
didates from the three Gila
County Mine-Mill locals. The
committee also will work in
conjunction with the Arizona
Mine-Mill Council on endorse-
ment of statewide candidates.

Tina Torres of Local 886 is
the vice-chairman, while Angel
T. Gonzales of Local 586 will
serve as secretary.

Other members of the newly-
formed group ‘are Albert C.
Remor, Robert B. Barcon,
Ladislao S. Garcia, Charles
Books, and Tony Chaidez, all of
Local 586; Melesio Chavez and
Richard Copetillo of Local 886;
and Abraham R. Lorona, Ynes
“Nechi” Lopez, and Carlos Al-
varado of Local 939.

International Representative
Jacob S. Mercado will serve as

-coordinator ‘of the committee.

5 To Bisbee Primary

B-ISBEE, Ariz.-—Having campaigned to increase registration
in their districts, three members of the Copper Queen Miners
Union are "candidates for Democratic nominations for the Common
Council as Bisbee voters go to the polls on April 20, just after

Mine-Mill Union press time.

J. J. “Junior” Stanford, who dropped a primary contest two

years ago by 13 votes to Otis Mason, the present councilman, is 2

probably in the best shape. Mason, who is not seeking re-election,

is supporting Stanford in Ward
3, where traditionally the vote
is light. -

In Ward 1, A. C. “Tex”
Whiteaker, who was instrumen-
tal in organizing the Bisbee
miners in 1941, is opposed on
the ballot by William Marshall,
the incumbent.

David G. Duarte, business
agent for Local 551, is seeking
the party nod in Ward 2, which
is currently vacant. He is op-
posed by Manuel Lugo, a gro-
cery store manager.

Six persons serve on the Com-
mon Council in Bisbee. It is felt
that the present mayor and
councilmen are heavily influ-
enced by the Phelps Dodge
Corp.

An underground miner here
since 1940, Stanford is running
against John Parker. A veteran
of World War II, he is a mem-
ber of the American Legion,
Post 16, a member of the Elks,
is married, and has three chil-
dren. -

Whiteaker, 51, a member of
the union’s grievance commit-
tee, has been an underground
miner for Phelps Dodge here
for the past 24 years. He was
on the Mine-Mill negotiating
committee when the first con-
tract was signed.

Duarte, now serving his fourth
term as chairman of the Ari-

Hecla. San Manuel
Election Dates Set

May 21 is the date set by the
NLRB for an election at the
Hecla Mining Company’s under-
ground mine in Heber City,
Utah, Board Member Verne
Curtis recently announced.

About 130 workers are em-
ployed at the property, which
the Steelworkers attempted to
organize a year ago, but lost, 47
to 79 for no union.

Curtis and International Rep-
resentative G. L. Buckner are
heading the drive to organize
the mine for Mine-Mill.

Board Member M. R. Bar-
raza, in announcing an election
date of April 28, expressed con-

fidence that the workers would

turn back an attempted raid by
the Steelworkers at San Manuel,
Ariz. The mine and smelter
there, which employ about 1,200
workers, are represented by
Mine-Mill Local 937.

The union agreed to a quick
consent election.

Civil Rights Legislation  
Dead in Arizona in 1964

PHOENIX, Ariz.—All proposed civil rights legislation, including a House-passed
public accomodations bill, has been killed for this year’s session by the State Senate,
with political leaders blaming their own failure to act on the actions of CORE and

%‘b.'T- S’.

 

 

_‘April.l. mt; ,

i Letter From Hoffa 

Thirty-five pages of the April issue of The International
Teamster, monthly journal of the union, are devoted to letters
and telegrams expressing support for President James R. Hoffa,‘
following his conviction in Chattanooga, Tenn., on March 4 on‘
charges of jury tampering. .

In addition to impressive support from teamster locals, district
councils, officials, and rank-and-filers, Hoffa was backed up by
several international unions, both in and out of the AFL-CIO. The
general president of the Teamsters also received hundreds of sym- ‘

 

NAACP demonstrators, who for over a week picketed and “sat-in” at the Capitol.

Sen. Glenn Blansett (D-Navajo Co.), who refused to allow the bill to be consid-
ered by the Counties and Municipalities Committee which he chairs, said, “If the
legislature should give in to this kind of intimidation and pressure by this group, it
would set a precedent that would destroy the orderly legislative process of this state
by encouraging other pressure groups to adopt similar tactics.” ‘

Only a month ago in Colorado, Gov. John A. Love

had refused to place al proposed

bill aimed at strengthening the state’s fair housing law on his legislative call. He was

discouraged, he said, by a CORE
“sit and sleep in” at the Capitol
in Denver.

Apparently the kind of lobby-
ing many politicians find more
acceptable is the kind which
allows big expense accounts for
the lobbyists and campaign con-
tributions to the candidates.

Mine-Mill Participation

Mine-Mill members from
Locals 586 in Miami and 938 in
Superior joined the civil rights
groups in the demonstrations,
which at times had up to_ 150
persons participating.

They were shocked not only
by the Senate’s refusal to act,
but by the treatment doled out

- to the demonstrators.

On March 30, the protesters
were bodily ejected from the
second floor of the Capitol, where
they were staging a “sit-in.” 120
State Highway patrolmen were
involved, while 31 sheriff’s depu-
ties and 41 city policemen lined
the walks around the mall.

Substitute Proposal

Gov. -Paul Fannin, who did
nothing to aid passage of the
public accommodations bill, did
say that he was interested in the
creation of a state commission
on human rights. But even this

- modest proposal gained no sup-

port in a legislative caucus,
according to Sen. Harold C. Giss
(D-Yuma Co.). ’

At any. rate, civil rights
leaders were not enthusiastic
about such a commission. Rev.
George Brooks, president of the
local NAACP, called it “just
another instrument to lull people
to sleep.”

A 15-member Human Rela-
tions Commission in Phoenix,
set up nine months ago, awards
plaques to employers who sign

a" “no discrimination pledge,”
but does not check to see that
the pledges are carried out. ‘

A local electronics company,
which civil rights leaders say
discriminates "against Negroes,
has received three plaques in
the‘last‘nin_e months.

Taking part in the demonstra-
tion on March 30 from the
Miami Miners Union were Angel
Gonzales and Albert» Remos.
President David Shackelford,
Business Agent Roy Santa Cruz
Jr., Jesus Almanza, Lee J orquez,
and Eugene Jaime from the
Superior local also participated,
as did Internationl Representa-
tive Sylvain Schnaittacher.

A delegation from Local 938
marched again on Apri-l 2 and 3,
led by Schackelford, who was
also acting as a representative
of the Arizona Mine-Mill Council
of which he is vice-chairman.

, Legislative Fact Sheets

Roy L. Cooksey, a member of
Local 886 in Hayden, who is
president of the Southwest Area
Conference of the NAACP,
worked on a legislative coordin-
ating committee for the civil
rights groups during the battle
over the bill. In sponsoring a
letter-writing c a m p a i gn, the
committee put out fact sheets
which included the percentages
of minority group population in
each county of the state. The
percentages are high for Green-
lee, Pinal, and Gila counties, in
which Mine-Mill has locals, as
they are for Apache, Coconino,
Navajo, and Santa Cruz counties.

Sen. Blansett’s statements on
the demonst-rations were taken,
by Mine-Mill members who par-
ticipated, as attempts to intimi-
date civil rights advocates in

The union membership in

the fight is finally won. It is
their intention, too, to call to

for passage of the legislation.

pathetic letters from average citizens around the country.

The following letter was received by Mine-Mill’s executive .. C,

board, which last month had expressed support for Hoffa an
“confidence in your appeal against this unjust decision”: _

Dear Sirs and Brothers:

I deeply appreciate your telegram of encouragement during this”. 1
time of crisis. It is good to know that there are people like you still ._ 

around who haven’t forgotten the trials and tribulations of our _”"‘,_
formative years and who have the courage to speak up" as you _ 6

have done.

Rest -assured, the fight is far from over. From all parts of A 

the country and from every segment of our population and mem-
bership there has been a constant flow of telegrams, letters, and
yes, even small financial offers of assistance in support of my
struggle against enslavement by ﬁat. A

I shall continue to struggle to the very end not only to vindicate
‘myself, b_ut in behalf of all other leaders of labor, few though they .
may be, who refuse to conform at the price of personal sacrifices ;
by the memberships whom we are privileged to represent. ; 

Thanking you again, and wishing you well, I am

Walkout Closes ll.J. Copperﬂelinery

PERTH AMBOY, N.J.—Mem-
bers of Mine-Mill Local 365
closed down AS&R’s copper re-
finery here early this month,
walkingoff their jobs in a one-
day demonstration against
harassment by the company of
union stewards and their griev-
ance: chairman.

The problem, the cause of a
running battle between union
and company for some time,
had become greater in recent
months.‘ “The company,” said
John Infusino, president of the
local, “had been attempting to
dictate the‘amount of time af-
forded for grievance investiga-

tions and in some cases had de-
nied the right of the grievance
chairman to investigate.”

He felt, too, that the company
had been forcing an unreason-
able number of arbitrations.
“The membership,” Infusino
said, “will not permit the com-
pany to limit and attempt to kill
the union’s grievance machin-
ery.”

Frank Wagner is chairman of
the grievance committee of the
Perth Amboy Smelter and Re-
finery Workers Union, which has
about 1,100 members. The plant
here is the largest in the AS&R
chain.

Summary of l’rovisions—  

    llouse-Passed civil Rights Bill  

Title I—Voting Rights: This section is designed to close some holes
that Southern states have discovered in the Civil Rights Acts of
1957 and 1960. “

First, it prohibits registrars from applying different standards
to Negro and white voting applicants in administering and "inter-
preting literacy tests. Literacy tests must be written, except where

state law provides for oral tests. Applicants have the right to de- '
mand a transcript of the questions and answers, no matter how the A.

test is given.

Second, registrars are prohibited from disqualifying applicants‘
for inconsequential omissions or errors, such as date of birth of.

father, on application forms.

Third, to speed voting suits, the Attorney General is allowed to « 

bring such cases before special three-judge panels.
The voting section applies only to federal elections.

Title II—-Public Accommodations: This section prohibits discrimi-
nation, by refusal of service or segregation, in hotels, motels, res-.
taurants, gasoline stations serving food, theaters, and sports arenas.
Rooming houses in which the owner lives and that have five or
fewer rooms are exempted. ‘ » v

The section also prohibits segregation that is practiced under
guise of state law, local ordinance, or custom or usage. This simply
reaffirms a ban in the 14th Amendment, but it. allows enforcement
of the ban, as in the rest of the title, through suits by the Attorney
General.‘ - '

Title III—Desegregation of Public Facilities:'. This section forbids
the denial of access to, or of the complete use of, any public facili-
ty owned, operated, or managed by a state or sub-division, on ac-
count of race or color.

Title IV—Public Education: This section empowers’ the Attorney
General to bring school desegregation suits, a power not granted
in the 1957 act. It also authorizes the Commissioner of Education
to give assistance to local communities in planning school desegre-
gation.

Title V——Civil Rights Commission: Extends Civil Rights Commis- _

sion for four years and broadens its powers.

Title VI—Federally Assisted Programs: ‘This section directs all
federal agencies to take action against discrimination in federally
assisted programs in states and communities. It permits, but does
not require, cutting off funds where discrimination persists.

Title VII—-Equal Employment Opportunity: This section bans dis-
crimination by labor unions or employers in‘ interstate commerce;
after a four-year transition period, it would cover unions and busi-
nesses with more than 25 persons employed. The commission es-
tablished by this title has the right to bring suit to enforce its

views where it cannot end discrimination by persuasion. The courts, -

and not the commission, will make the final determination on
whether, discrimination exists.

Title VIII—-Registration and Voting Statistics: The Secretary of
Commerce is directed by this section to compile accurate statistics
onthe denial of the right to vote in areas designated by the Civil
Rights Commission. “

Title IX—-Procedure, After Removal -in Civil Rights Cases: This

, section would permit appeals from Federal District Court decisions

refusing to let civil rights defendants remove their cases to the
Federal Courts. At present, remand decisions of the Federal Dis-
trict Court cannot be appealed. Many Southern District judges have
been hostile to removals from state courts.

Title X——Community Relations Service: This section establishes
a Community Relations Service with a director appointed bythe
President. The service would helpcommunities resolve racial dis-
putes and other difficulties attending desegregation.

Title XI—Mis‘cellaneous: This section insures that nothing in the
act shall be construed to impair or deny any right or authority of
the Attorney General, or any other officer or agency of the United
States, to institute or intervene in any action under powers granted
in existing law.

Former Congressman
Agan Utah Candidate

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—David S. King, U. S. representative

from Utah’s 2nd Congressional District from 1958 to 1962, will seek

to regain that position this fall. The only announced Democratic
candidate for the seat at the time of the filing deadline on March
31, he will be opposed in the November general election by former
Republican state chairman Thomas G. Judd, a businessman, also

of Salt Lake City.

In 1962, King was the Democratic nominee in the U. S. Senate
race, bowing to Wallace F. Bennett, who won his third term by a

15,099 vote plurality.

Sherman R. Lloyd, the Republican lawyer who won the 2nd
Congressional District seat that year, is vacating the position to

run in a primary contest for the
Senate.

King, an attorney, who for-
mally announced his candidacy

on March 21, has .cal1ed.for_

“immediate establishment and
enforcement of adequate safety

‘standards for the operation of

our metal and minerals mines”
(see text of statement on page
9), saying that the Metcalf-
Montoya bill “points the way to
the solution of this problem.”
Early Retirement Bill
In April, 1962, he introduced
a bill, still pending before Con-

gress, which would authorize

early retirement with full social
-security benefits at age 60 to
persons employed in particu-
larly hazardous occupations.

" A native of Salt Lake City,

King is the son of the late Wil-
-liam H. King, who served for. 24
years in the U. S. Senate. He is

agraduate of the University of

Utah and received his law de-

I KELLOGG, Idaho-—The North-
west Metal Workers, an inde-
pendent union which three years
ago broke a 71/2-month Mine-

Mill strike at‘Bunker Hill, ap-

parently has retained the prop-
erty in an April 8 election.

While the NLRB still has not

ruled on 42 challenged votes,
the other totals were these, as
the Mine-Mill Union went to
press: Northwest, 688; Mine-
Mill, 415; United Steelworkers
of America, 254; and “No un-
ion,” ,9.

“We intend,” said Mine-Mill

MPr,esident Al Skinner, “to con-

tinue our long-range objective
of bringing Bunker Hill back.”
“We knew this was goingto be
a tough one,” he said, “because
the Northwest Metal Workers
and the Bunker Hill company
were working hand-in-glove to
defeat Mine-Mill. So we had

the company, the company’s

union, and Steel to overcome.”

Mine-Mill rank-and-filers who

filibuster provided a glimpse of what’s to come.

The best educated guesses in Washington are that

it will be the end of May at least before there can be any
attempt to cut off debate by invoking cloture, and to get

a vote on the bill itself.

In the meantime, there is the danger of amendments
which would weaken the bill as passed by the House.
Sen. Everett M. Dirksen‘ of Illinois, the Republican

Senate leader, has said ﬂatly that there will be amend- I

merits. To date; ‘however, he has been unable to win broad

.GO.P support for his . proposals.

to change ‘ the Equal «Employ-
ment Opportunity (FEPC) sec-

tion. Dirksen first suggested that -

state -Fair. Employment Prac-
tices Commissions should be
given priority over federal
authorities» in handling job dis-
crimination complaints, and later
proposed a revised amendment
which’ ,would""give state agencies

a ‘maximum ’ of 'six7m_on‘ths__in '
1 which -to‘ ’consider such com-"'
plaints before a case, goes‘ to a’
' federal FEPC. ‘ - ‘ ‘ ' '

‘At any rate, the Republican
leader ‘says he has " a dozen
amendments he wants to make
to the bill. '

Sen. Hube~rtHumphrey ‘of~Min- _'

nesota, whose job it is to pilot
the bill through the Senate as
is, claims 60 votes, some ‘of
them unsure, and 67 are needed
to bring the talking to a close.
The danger of compromise in
order to invoke cloture is real,
although Humphrey has pledged
there will be none of that.
Meanwhile, there have been
developments which make -it

‘ necessary for all supporters of

civil rights to launch angall-out
drive, to communicate their
feelings to their Senators. First,
mail to Senators is rumiing
heavily‘ against the bill——the
probable result of a very well
financed campaign by the seg-
regationists. Full page ads at-
tacking the bill have appeared
in many newspapers around the
country, paid for by the Coor-
dinating Committee for ;Funda-
mental Fre edolm s — a front
organization operating on funds,
the majority of which came
from a Mississippi legislative
appropriation. -

Second, Gov. George C. Wal-
lace of Alabama, running in the
Wisconsin primary election,
polled over a quarter of a mil-
lion votes, some 25 percent of

the ‘total. The fear _is that _he,.

‘might do as wel1.in"'_Indiana‘ and
Maryland. 0 ’ 3 ‘ »
President Johnson, however,
-remains’ confident. that the bill
will pass without crippling
amendments. «

‘THE»MIN_E’-MILL UNION

 

Committee Tackles

Auto 

 

WASHINGTON, D. C.——Whether anyone will listen is another
question, but a broadly representative committee of Americans has
come up with an answer to the problems of automation that com-
pletely upsets the old relationships of work, production, and con-
sumption—-and makes a lot of sense. Perhaps the most upsetting
part of the proposal, to anyone raised on the ideas that scarcity

is fundamental and work is good, is that:

“. . . society, through

its .appropriate legal and governmental institutions, undertake an

unqualified commitment to provide every individual» and every v

family with an adequate in-
‘come~«-as a matter of right”-
and that means whether they
work or not. -
. . _ A Utopian dream? Perhaps.
 But the group, going under the
V;-...) ‘unlikely, title" or the ‘Ad Hoc
9"‘ ‘Committee on the Triple Revo-
jlution, develops its ideas with
. A *_striking logic.
Among its 26 members are
Ralph L. Helstein, president of
the United Packingh_ouse, Food
and Allied Workers; James
~Boggs, auto worker (author of
:Pages_from a Negro Worker’s
Note Book); W. H. Ferry, vice-
‘president, Fund for the Repub-
lic, Inc.; and assorted attorneys,
businessmen, economists, and
journalists—-all distinguished in
their fields. ” ‘

The three revolutions of -the A
committee’s title are those int

cybernetics (automation), mod’-
ern weapons, and‘ human rights.
The report bears down hard on
th e revolution in production

brought about by automation ‘as,

the‘ liberating ke-y to the prob-
'lems— of the other two. For in-
stance, the Negro “claims his
full "share in America’s eco-
 nomic and social life. Yet Negro
unemployment rates cannot be
expected to drop, substantially.
‘Promises of jobs are a cruel
and dangerous hoax on hun-
dreds of thousands of Negroes

and whites _alike who are es-_

pecially vulnerable to cyb_erna-
tion because of age and inade-
‘quate education.”

In the military sector,~ “the
space budgets.

"military and
‘have absorbed a rising propor-
-tion of ,,national production and

formed a strong support for the -

economy However, these

. expenditures are coming in" for“

-more‘ and more criticism

the future of these strong props .

‘to the economy ‘is not as clear
‘today as it"was even a year
K ago.” . .

L The industrial revolution, with
its vast upheavals, took 200

years to mature. The automa-
tion revolution is being felt in

a sharp increase in produc-_,

tivity beginning in 1961, only
two decades after it began late
in World War II.

And under automation, “po—
tentially unlimited output can
be achieved by systems of ma-
chines which will require little
cooperation from human be-
ings.” In brief, ithasbecome
literally impossible , to keep
everyone employed. “We be-
lieve,”“ says ' the committee,
“that the -industrial productive
system is no longer viable.”

Should automation, ‘then, sim-
ply be slowed down or stopped?
On the contrary, _“The new sci-
ence of political, economy will

be ;built on the encouragement.
and planned. expansion ofcyberé .-

order in this country . ’. . Na-
tional policy has hitherto been
aimed "far more atvthe Welfare

at the. Welfare of-people. The
era of cybernation can revers

this emphasis.” — .

_ The committee is understand-
ably lessipositive about how to
make the transition from a
philosophy of scarcity to a phi-

los_ophy of abundance, but_.call's '

for a revolution in our thinking

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Strike Ends as Storm Clouds
Gather for Anaconda in Chile

Against a background of political developments which threaten the interests of
U.S. copper companies in Chile, the seven-week strike at Anaconda’s El Salvador mine
and Potrerillos smelter there was settled last month. "The company, which had been
offering a 38 percent increase in wages a week prior to the settlement, agreed on
March 21 to a 68 percent hike, following the threat of a nationwide 48-hour sympathy
strike at all copper’-producing facilities.

The agreement runs until May 1, 1965.

Negotiations have now begun at Anaconda’s Chuquicamata mine, where the con-
tract expires on June 30. The union, in this country of rampant inflation, is demanding
pay boosts of 90 percent for the miners. October 2 is the expiration date for the labor
contract at Kennecott’s Braden mine.

But a month prior to that, on Sept. 4, a presidential election will be held. In what

is already a hot and hard-slugging campaign, both leading contenders are promising.

bad news for Anaconda and Kennecott. Meanwhile, several proposals aimed at claim-
ing a greater share of U.S. copper company profits for the Chilean government are
being considered by the Congress.

The current front-runner in the presidential race, Senator Salvador Allende, who
represents a coalition of parties known as the Popular Action Front, announced early

L « in April that, if he were elected,

he would nationalize the Ameri-
can-owned mines in Chile “un-
der existing law."

Just how this would work has
not been made clear, but Al-
lende is sponsor of a bill to ex-
propriate the’ mines and com-
pensate the U. S. companies at
what industry observers regard
as a low figure. The compen-
sation would be payable in 30-
year bonds at low interest rates.
Allende also said that if Chile’s
traditional markets were closed
in retaliation for the expropria-
tion, Chile would ship its cop-
per to the Soviet bloc countries
in Eastern Europe.

Program of CDP Candidate
Senator Eduardo Frei, the
candidate of the Christian
Democratic party, has a pro-
gram calling for strict regula-
tion of the U. S. copper com-
panies. Major items include:

0 Increasing production at
U.S.-owned mines from present
levels of about 600,000 tons per
year to 1,000,000 tons per year
by 1972. How he would accom-
plish this is not spelled out, but
one method that has been sug-
gested is to heavily tax mines
failing to produce at desired
levels. _

0 Refine all Chilean copper
in Chile. -

0 Government control of the
pricing of Chilean copper in
world markets. (Chile has been

grumbling at the slowness of --

Kennecott and Anaconda to
raise prices of -Chilean copper
in Europe. The companies, of
course, are reluctant to raise
prices, as in the US, until new
labor contracts are signed.)

0 Unrestricted sale of Chile’s

copper to any country.

Conservative Withdraws

The conservative coalition, to
which now President Jorge

’ Alessandri belongs, has recent-

ly fallen apart. Senator Julio
Duran, who was to be its presi-
dential candidate, has with-
drawn from the race.

Even at the present time
moreover, the Chilean Congress
has a number of proposals be-
fore it which would put the bite
on Kennecott and Anaconda in
one way or another. A bill to
guarantee no further increases
in Chilean taxes on the U.S.
copper companies, on the other
hand, has never been intro-
duced, although much talked
about for,over a year and fav-
ored by the conservative Presi-
dent Alessandri.

Recently the Chilean Senate’s

‘Finance Committee has had un-

der consideration a bill which
would place an export tax on
all copper shipped out of ‘the
country except electrolytic cop-
per. This is designed to force
refining of all copper in Chile.
Another bill would raise taxes
paid by U.S. copper companies
to offset U.S. import duties paid

S Duarte, Hector Sierras, and Gilberto Parra (left to right) on

electric guitars. The action took place at a ‘Mine-Mill dance
for vteen—agers in Douglas, Arizona.

 

which the companies can now
use as a deductible expense.
Other Proposals
Three other bills which have
been turned down by the com-

mittee would have compelled

the U.S. companies to increase
production (which would re-
quire substantial new invest-
ments)‘ under penalty of higher
income taxes, required the com-
panies to make an interest-free
loan to Chile of the total value
of copper exports for five years,
and obliged the companies to
provide 100,000 tons of refined

copper annually to Chilean cop-.

per fabricators —— about five
times the current capacity of
Chilean brass and wire mills.

Bills in the Chilean Congress
to clip the wings of the U.S.
copper companies are nothing
new. In fact, taxes have been
raised in recent years to heights
that the companies call “con-
fiscatory.”

Now it looks, however, as if
popular sentiment in Chile fav-
ors an even bigger bite.

Tax Discrimination .
Already Charged

R.’ M. Haldeman, vice-presi-l

dent of Kennecott’s Chilean sub-
sidiary, recently wrote a letter
to the company's employees
there saying that unless “pres-
ent tax discriminations” were
ended, “you cannot expect the
company to satisfy your aspira-

tions” for new housing and other

welfare and social demands the
unions have been making.

The present outlook is that
nothing much will be done af-
fecting the status of the U.S.
copper companies in Chile until
after the election next Septem-
ber. After that, however, it
looks as if the going would get
rougher for them—-no matter
who wins.

The Kennecott Copper
Corp. has announced that
there will be no vacation
shutdown period for the West-
ern Mines Division in 1964.

' Employees,‘ instead, will re-
ceive vacations on‘ a stag-
gered schedule so that oper-
ations can continue.

The copper market certain-
ly is booming this year.

Mine Safety Sponsors lleerl 
  Political Help This Year L  

by Irving Dichter .
International Secretary-Treasurer ‘ 
HE dreary filibuster now being carried on in the U. S. Senate
by the segregationist bloc has brought the legislative process
to adead stop. Insiders calculate that it may very well be some
time in June_before.the Senate acts on the civil rights bill; And‘
after that, everybody will be rushing for the national conventions,
scheduled for July and August. .. _ A '
Under the circumstances, the best we can hope for on the Met-
calf-Montoya mine safety bill is preliminary hearings this y_e_ar._
This is what we are‘ shooting for. We have to convince Congress-~  ' '
man James Roosevelt and Senator Lister Hill, whose committees  -
are handling the bill, to schedule hearings in late May or early 9 2 O
June. ‘ , . . , . :.
There is one other factor which may play a determining part _ s
on whether or not such hearings are held this year. The adminis.-y if"
tration has prepared a bill under the direction of Secretary of In- Q2
terior Udall which is presently in the Bureau of Budget for analy- 
sis. and comment. The bill has been there since the middle‘ of; 
January. The sooner that bill is cleared and introduced, the sooner
hearings will be held on mine safety legislation. ‘ ~
i . . . . ‘k ‘k A . _ .
.HE ‘filibuster is not only blanketing normal congressional activi- f g; f
ty, but the time consumed is being used to develop a na-_ , -
tional campaign to weaken or kill the civil ’ ; - ‘
rights bill. This campaign is dangerous and
must be fought, not only by our union, but
by the entire trade union movement. Now is
the time to sit down and write a letter to
your Senator demanding that the bill be
-passed without crippling amendments. Let’s
set aside a part of each membership meeting
for that purpose. The Senators from our
‘districts may be critical in the vote.

Although the major part of our activity
these days involves preparation for bargain- _ 
ing, we are moving along in developing our ”‘°h‘" V 
political action work. Within recent weeks we have set up politi-' ’ -‘
cal action committees throughout the Rocky Mountain area. And"'_'1_»_,;.i
we are organizing them from the ground up. . . - '”

UR ability to involve our membership in political action work

will in some measure determine the fate of our mine safety . 7:7'_-
bill. Senator Moss, who ‘co-sponsored the bill with Senator Met-V,

Mexico. A '
All of the Congressmen who introduced our bill inthe House‘ ,
are up for re-election.‘ We have a commitment to assist them;  
But more than our mine safety bill is involved in the coming e1ec-  4
tion. We are committed to back those candidates who will sup-. - A ,
port the President’s anti-poverty program, those who will fight for’  
medicare and the extension and improvement of pension and fun!

choose a festival and social af-
fairs committee to plan and run
a series of dances and other

agers. The Catholic Youth Cen-
ter, which used to hold oc-
casional dances here, discon-
tinued them some time ago.

On Feb. 21, Mine-Mill spon-
sored a dance attended by al-
most 200 teen-agers. Youngsters
from several local bands do-
nated their time to provide
music for the affair.

THE MINE-MILL UNION.

  

. ‘Utah is a state where the
consequences of inadequate
mine safety provisions and en-
forcement are wellknown. Last
August 27, an explosion of

.-‘V-: -5 gases at Texas Gulf Sulphur

‘ .Company’s potash mine near

,Moab claimed 18 lives. In De-

est of the 50 states, based on
. the numberof violations of state
‘laws uncovered by federal in-
spectors during a two-years
study. The chairman of the
State Industrial Commission has
again been asked to resign by
”‘-the: district president of the
United Mine Workers of Ameri-
jca. r (See story in Your Safety
  and Health column.)

,. Two, candidates from that

newspaper their views on fed-
eral mine safety legislation.
Frank E. Moss, a Democrat, is
a candidate for re-election to
the .U. S. Senate. He is a co-

-,. .

T ; Their statements follow:

 Sen. Frank E. Mess

 Although we have made con-
3. ‘siderable progress in improv-
' ingsafety in both our metallic

. and-Z non-metallic mines, acci-
"de‘_nts and industrial diseases
still take far too heavy a toll.

We must continue to study the
causes and prevention of mine

injuries and the hazards to‘

health in our mines, and must
put ‘to good use all of the engi-
neering skill and all of the pre-
_ ventive knowledge we have in
..  both fields. Our objective should
V " be to give every ounce of pro-
- tection possible to every miner
I who goes underground.

I have consistently supported

. mine safety legislation ever

since I. came to the United

V Statessenate in 1959. In fact,

I have co-sponsored and worked

‘i . ‘ for. safety legislation for metal

and non-metallic mines in every

Congress in which I have

served—'7S.‘ 811 in the 86th Con-

gres.s,.S,. 1034 .in the 87th Con-

gress, ‘and S. 1949 (the Metcalf—

Montoya bill) in the present
Congress. _

. .When it became evident in the

.4 , last Congress that it was not

__.h  .'go_ing.to be possible to get direct

“N and _-»immediate -action -. on a

‘mine -safety bill without further

 

 

  aiidr.-‘health, conditions in the na-

 

 - — Metal and Non-Metallic Mines
.. ._Study Act. This act autho-rized
, the.Secre-taryof the Interior to
,  conduct a study of the causes
 aiidjprevention of injuries and
= 1 health hazards in mines other
 than coal mines. In supporting
 .,the' study bill, I regretted the
 delay which ’ making a ‘ study
 would inevitably cause in get-
,‘ ting on with the business at
"“'ha’n"d—that of increasing mine
;safety. But I-know that study
1 bills are sometimes the surest
route’ to action.

   

 

  
  
   
  
   
   
 
  
  

“._The" mine safety study was

V -partment of the Interior sum-
inlarizied’ and published the re-
.__-stilts; :-The report contains a
broatl'f'-lsweep: of information. I
 plarticulia-rly interested in
exteiit to. which full facts

 

information on current safety '

_tion’s- mines, - I supported the’

-lc,onclu’_ded last fall, and the De-_

only on safety needs and pro-
cedures, but also on the menac-
ing increases in the dimensions
of industrial disease. The in-
formation compiled on radia-
tion, air quality ventilation, gas
and dust levels, and silicosis
should be most helpful.

The Department is now study-

U. S. Sen. Frank E. Moss

ing all of the material assem-

bled and getting ready to make A

recommendations. I understand
they will be in the form of a
mine safety bill. Because these
recommendations are in the
mill, the Interior Department

_ has delayed in making an ‘offi-

cial report on S; 1949, the pend-
ing mine safety bill which I am
co-sponsoring.

It is my opinion that there
has now been ample time for
the Interior Department to
come up with some sound
recommendations in the field of
mine and health safety. I trust
those. recommendations will be
forthcoming soon. M

As I have said, one unneces-
sary death because of unsafe
mining conditions is one death
too many. And there are obvi-
ously serious health hazards
which should be met head on
and reduced or eliminated.

I pledge‘ my continued efforts
to secure the best possible
,health and safety conditions for
the workers in the nation’s
metallic and non-metallic mines.

David S. King

One of our paramount na-
tional urgencies is the immedi-

 

ate establishment and enforce-
ment of adequate safety stand-
ards for the operation of our
metal and mineral mines. The
mine safety report recently sub-
mitted to Congress by Interior
Secretary Udall shocked the na-
tion into realization that sub-
standard mining operations were
causing annually thousands of
human casualties and incurring
tens of millions of dollars in un-
necessary operational costs.
This report was based upon
the compiled findings from the
inspection of 800 individual
mines. The findings showed
that 544 of the mines operated’
in violation of their respective
state safety laws and codes,
and that even those laws and
codes, had they been fully com-
piled with, would have failed to

give adequate coverage to in-
sure minimum safety for all.

. To illustrate, the report
demonstrated that 28% of all
miners in the United States
were completely uncovered by
any mine safety legislation
whatsoever, and that the pro-
tection offered to the remaining

-72% was, in many cases, inade-

quate to meet modern hazards.

Of special interest in Utah
was the fact that more than
one-half of the United States
underground uranium miners
were regularly exposed to lung
cancer hazard from radon gas.
1,264 miners were found breath-
ing radon gas on the job in con-
centrations declared unsafe by
the United States Public Health
Service. In 1962, 212 miners

were killed, 329 were perma-

 Utah Candidates Present Views on Mine Safety

were sought and analyzed, not

nently crippled, and 7,000 man-
years of labor were lost from
debilitating injuries. Over half
of the accidents were primarily
caused by conditions over which
the miner himself had no con-
trol.

The Metcalf-Montoya bill,'now

before the Congress, points the ,

way to the solution of this prob-
lem. Every reasonable means
should be employed to bring
this bill to hearing, and to thus

expedite the enactment of ade-.

quate legislation to protect the
lives and safety of the men who
extract our nation’s metal and
mineral ore. To do nothing,
through excusable ignorance,
would be tragic. But do nothing,
in the face of incontrovertible
evidence of the need to do some-
thing, would be criminal.

Fulbright of Arkansas Attacks

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a
March 25 speech, Sen. William
J. Fulbright, chairman of the
U.S. Senate’s Foreign Relations
Committee, asked that his col-
leagues—and the nation—exam-
ine a number of widely accept-
ed ideas in American foreign
policy to see if they conform to
the realities of a rapidly chang-
ing world.

Among other departures from
some of the standard “myths”
supported by both parties, Ful-
bright suggested:

That the U.S. accept the fact
that there are -deficiencies in
the Panama Canal treaty, and
that we forthrightly announce
our willingness to renegotiate
that agreement;

That we accept Fidel Castro’s
communized Cuba as more of a

nuisance than a menace, and‘

face the fact that our trade em-
bargo is a failure;

That we stop discouraging
trade with Communist bloc
countries, both because there is
perfectly good business to be
had, most of which is now going
to our European “allies,” and
because it will help reduce ten-
sions that might lead to war;

That we be alert to develop-
ments of less- hateful attitudes

_ .by -. the Chinese-. Communists as

a new generation of leaders
grows up there, and that the
ultimate solution of the Chinese
“problem” must be recognized
by both sides of “two Chinas.”

Not having attacked enough
sacred cows, a few days later
Fulbright criticized the close
ties between the military and
industry, and said, “The Ameri-
can people are not now exercis-
ing effective control over the
military, and neither is Con-
gress.” He ‘said President John-
son’s proposed war on poverty
and other education-welfare pro-
grams “are at least as impor-
tant to the security of our coun-
try in the long term as is a
national defense establishment
and a good deal more important
than a voyage to the moon.”

Senator Fulbright raised all
these issues, he said,‘ because
Republican presidential candi-
dates Goldwater and Rockefeller
had both said foreign policy
would be an issue in the election
campaign. ‘

His Senate speech created a
stir among Republicans and
Democrats alike, and certainly
in the nation’s press. Bags full
of mail are still pouring into his
office, Fulbright says, and,
strangely enough, it favors. his

stand by- about 4;.,or 5 to 1..

P r o b a b I y more significant
than his specific suggestions are
the basic assumptions behind
Fulbright’s -call for a re-exami-
nation of American foreign pol-
icy. ,

(Following are excerpts from
the March 25 speech.)

“We are confronted with a
complex and fluid world situa-
tion and we are not adapting
ourselves to it. We are clinging
to old myths in the face of new

‘realities and we are seeking to

escape the contradictions by nar-
rowing the permissible bounds
of public discussion, by relegat-
ing an increasing number of
ideas and viewpoints to a grow-
ing category of ‘unthinkable
thoughts.’ I believe that this
tendency can and should be re-
versed, that it is within our abil-
ity, and unquestionably in our
interests, to cut loose from es-
tablished myths and to start
thinking some ‘unthinkable
thoughts . . .’ "

“If we persist in the view that
all Communist re gim e s are
equally hostile and equally
threatening to the West, and that
we can have no policy toward
the captive -nations except the
eventual overthrow of their
Communist regimes, then the

"West may ‘enforce upon. -the

Communist bloc a degree of
unity which the Soviet Union has
shown itself to be quite incapa-
ble of imposing——just as Stalin
in the early postwar years
frightened the West into a de-
gree of unity that it almost cer-
tainly could not have attained
by its own unaided efforts.”
“The myth is that every Com-
munist state is an unmitigated
evil and a relentless enemy of
the free world; the reality is
that some Communist regimes
pose a threat to the free world
while others pose little or none,
and that if we will recognize
these distinctions, we ourselves
will be able to inﬂuence events
in the Communist bloc in a way

' favorable to the security of the

free world.”
“We Americans would do well,

for .a start, to divest ourselves
_ of the silly notion that the issue

with Panama is a test of our

‘courage and resolve. I believe

that the Cuban crisis of 1962 . . .
was indeed a test of our. cour-
age, “but I am unable to under-
stand how a controvery with a
small and poor country, with
virtually’ no military capacity,
can possibly be regarded as a
test of our bravery and will to

‘defend ‘our interests.”

“In -recent years we have be-

mental to our security and our

“Old Myths”

come transfixed with Cuba,

making it far more important in‘-
both our foreign relations and
in our domestic life than its size
and inﬂuence warrant. We have
ﬂattered a noisy but minor dem-
agogue by treating him as if he
were a Napoleonic menace . . .
It is important to bear in mind
that, despite their best efforts,
the Cuban Communists have not,
succeeded in subverting the
hemisphere and that in Venezu-

ela, for example, where commu- » V

nism has made a major effort to
gain power through terrorism, it
has been repudiated by a people
who in a free election have com‘-
mitted themselves to a course of
liberal democracy.”

“We must not close our minds — "

to the possibility that democrat-

ic procedures may fall in cer-'5"
tain countries and that .where-/_

democracy does fall violent so-f

cial. convulsions-may occur . 4

We should be considering . . . 

what groups in particular coun-
tries might conceivably lead;

revolutionary movements, and:-if’  A

we can identify them and inﬂu-

ence them in such a way that *

their movements, if successful,
will not pursue courses detri-

interests.” . .4 .

WASHINGTON, D. C.-The
Amalgamated Meat Cutters
and Butcher Workmen spoke
up last month in behalf of the
consumer.

At an Agriculture Depart-
ment hearing, the union
asked for more chicken in
chicken soup, protesting that
some soups sold in dehy-
drated form contain less than
1 percent poultry meat when
ready to eat. ‘

‘Chicken or turkey soup
should contain at least 2 per-'
cent meat, the union said, in
order to be so labeled. The
housewife should not have to
“turn to a microscope” to
find the chicken, the union
declared.

Local 700 Wins  
L A. Arbitration

LOS ANGELES, Calif.—Roose-
velt McCown of Mine-Mill West-
ern Mechanics Local 700 won
five days back pay in an arbi-
tration award made last month.
In addition, Arbitrator Thomas

T. Roberts told AS&R to remove .

from McCown’s employment his-
tory all record of a disciplinary
suspension he was given last
June, saying that the suspen-
sion was a breach of the con-
tract.

McCown, who .works in the
scrap department of AS&R’s
Federated Metals Division, was
asked to work overtime one day
while he was temporarily as-
signed to the foundry crew. He
was given the five-day dis-
ciplinary suspension when he
refused.

Although the arbitration deci- 6

sion affirms the company’s
right to compel overtime work,
it said that in this case that
right was unreasonably invoked.
The production supervisor,
Frank Laney, had not ordered
McCown to work overtime until
he was punching out, although
Laney knew he would need over-
time workers at least an hour
prior to that time.

James L. Daugherty, repre-
senting the international union,
and the shop grievance commit-
tee handled the case for the
union. James Welch, a main-
tenance helper,_ and Leander

Fedal Inspection at Montana Phosphate Mines

Although authorityufor inspection of mines under the Mine Safety Study Act of 1961 expired last

order.

' year, the U.S. Bureau of Mines continues to make periodic inspections of mines on Indian lands and

on Government-leased lands on the Public Domain under authority of a 20-year old executive

The Montana Phosphate Company mines in Granite and Powell Counties of Montana fall in this
category. These mines were resurveyed last month and here are the highlights of recommenda-

tions from the federal inspec-
tor’s reports:
Douglas Mine

0 Repair and rehand ladder
in manway of 5205-B stope.

0 Ladders in 5203-B Stope
should be offset and landings
provided at 20-foot intervals.

0 Provide drainage ditch or

‘flume in 5200-A crosscut. (Re-

peated from previous report.)

' 0 Install ve_nt'tubing to pro-
vide positive ventilation in 5205-

C stope.
Luke Mine
0 Transformers on south side
of shaft station on 5300 level

should be installed on fire-re-,

sistant material. (R e p e a t e d
from previous report.)

0 Clean down manway ladder
of inclined shaft. —

O Extend vent tubing into
stopes and within 30 feet of
face.

0 Air intakes of compressors
should be extended outside the
compressor building. (Repeated
from previous report.)

Gimlet Mine

OThe 20 h.p. fan should be"

operated when men are working
underground.

0 The air intakes‘ of the air
compressor should be extended
outside the compressor building.
(Repeated from previous re-
port.) ,

Anderson-Brock Mine:

0 Motor-generator sets should

be mounted on a fire-re-sistant

- material. (Repeated from previ-

ous report.)

0 Underground sub s t a tio n
should be installed in fire-re-
sistant rooms. (Repeated from

’ previous report.)

0 Rock drill oil drums should
be provided with a means of
confining and disposing of
spilled oil.

0 A “no smoking” sign should
be provided at the 4600 level
service raise station.

0 A full guard should be in-
stalled on the resistors of the
service raise hoist.

IWhen the cager must ride
the cage with a load of ma-
,l;eria]s,the materials should be
tied insecurely and the gates
closed; -or if the gates must be
removed, a safety bar should

" be provided for the cager.

0 Only Bureau of Mines-ap-
proved, mobile, diesel-powered
equipment should be used un-
derground. Bureau of Mines-
approved equipment should be
used to replace or add to the
mobile diesel-powered equip-
ment now in use underground
when replacement of’ present
equipment, or additional equip-
ment is necessary. (The body

. of the report states, “Plymouth

I

--Model F.W.D. locomotives . . .
had not been approved by the -

‘ Bureau of Mines and no action

during this inspection shall be

. interpreted as official approval
. of this equipment.’’)

0 Power cables should be
mounted on insulators to avoid

 damage to \the cable and to

l

x ', V,‘ ,‘_l't

avoid contact with combustible
material such as timber sets.
(Repeated from previous re-
port.)

OThe power cable between
5237 and 5235 stopes and south
of 5223 stope should be rehung
to avoid contact by employees
and damage from moving equip-
ment. ‘

S Wies|ey's Ouster
Asked

Frank Stevenson, District 22
president of the United Mine
Workers of America, last month
renewed his call for the ouster

- of Otto A. -Wiesley, chairman of

Utah's Industrial Commission,»

saying that the explosion at the
Carbon Fuel Company’s No. 2
mine ne-ar Helper in December
might have- been prevented.
Nine men were killed in the
disaster.

In a March 13 letter, .Steven-
son asked Gov. George D. Clyde
to dismiss Wiesley or, if neces-
sary, to call a special session
of the legislature to do so. All
UMWA locals inthe state have
supported the request.

Shortly after the December I

explosion, UMWA officials met
with Clyde and_asked that Wies-
ley be removed. Four members
of Mine-Mill Local 485 in Bing-
ham Canyon attended that meet-
ing, at which President Joe Dis-
penza said, “We have _the same
gripes as the coal miners, ex-
cept that we have more of
them.” ~

Aware Last May
Stevenson charged that the

Carbon Fuel mine had been in- —

spected only twice during 1963,
although safety orders specify
that the commission inspect
mines at least four times each
year, and that the -governor
himself had agreed that this
was true. He also stated that
the commission was aware, as
long ago as May, 1963, of many
violations at the mine, but had
not enforced. the state safety
laws. _ - _ - ,

Utah employs 52 conservation
officers andfour regional direc-
tors in the Department of Fish
and_ Game to protect wildlife.
Stevenson -noted that for over

a year the state had only-one‘.
coal mine inspector who had to‘

inspect 37 coal mines, all the
gilsonite mine ‘operations,’ and
several oil drilling rigs.

In May, 1963, Stevenson said,
several hazardous conditions ex-
isted which had not been recti-
fied by the time of the disaster.
These included rock dusting be-
ing performed on the night
shift, accumulation of methane
gas, the continuous miner rais-
ing an excessive amount of coal
dust into the air at the working
face which was not being al-
layed at its source, the ventilat-
ing current of air at the work-
ing face not being sufficient to
dilute and render harmless the
methane“ gas being liberated
during mining operations. “No
recommendations of ch a nge”
were made by the state inspec-
tor at that time, Stevenson said.

  

mittee on Labor, which Rep. James Roosevelt heads.

Both Hill and Roosevelt (D-Calif.) are long-time friends of
labor, and their committees are generally regarded as favorable

to labor-backed legislation.

Sen. Lee Metcalf of Montana, one of the bill’s sponsors in the

Senate, sits on Hill’s committee.
Mine-Mill Secretary-Treasurer
Irving Dichter, in Washington
last month to confer with legis-
lative leaders and Interior De-
partment officials, was told that
the mine safety bill drafted by
the Interior Department had not
yet been approved by the Bu-
reau of the Budget.
Embodying the recommenda-
tions contained in Secretary
Udall’s report to Congress last
November, Health ‘and Safety
Survey of Metal and Non-Metal
Mines, the bill was sent to the
bureau in mid-January. It can-
not be submitted to Congress

-without approval. from the Bu-

reau of the Budget.

Dichter, Sen. Metcalf, and oth-
er. congressional leaders have
urged quick approval and early

submission to Congress, which
would clear the decks for com-
mittee consideration of the Met-
calf-Montoya and Interior De-
partment bills at the same time.

Indications of widespread con-

gressional and trade union sup- ‘

port for the Metcalf-Montoya bill
continued to pour into Mine-Mill
headquarters during the past
month. Altogether, some 30 na-
tional and international unions
have thus far indicated support,

4: ,.

‘er

I

and many union legislative rep- . ’

resentatives have written or ‘S
called upon members of Con- *

gress urging early hearings on
and enactment of the measure.

Sen. Metcalf said he 'still
hoped for Congressional. mine‘

safety hearings before adjourn-H

ment of the present session.

Work Stoppage Protests Unsafe
Conditions at Ghristmas Mine

WINKELMAN, Ariz.-—Three hundred members of the Miami ‘ ii

-Miners'Union, Local 586 stayed away from their jobs at the In-

spira_tion' Consolidated Copper Company’s Christmas mine on ‘ '

March 12 because of continued violations by company supervisors '

pofsafe practices. ~

The miners unanimously voted for the demonstration at _a

at “the mine, including some ho

for work. '

Members of the 1ocal’s"safety
committee, accompanied by
President Robert Barcon and

- International Representative

Sylvain Schnaittacher, had pre-
sented to company officials at

' a March 3 meeting a list" of 23’

safety problems and hazardsat
the mine. i ’ ’
Although the company agreed
to several recommendations and
promised further investigation,
and although H. Carroll Weed,

- vice-president and general man-
, ager, said he would be person-

ally responsible to see that
safety conditions were im-

. proved, the one-day demonstra-

tion was called because of foot-
dragging. Weed’s supervisors

did not comply with his instruc- '

tions, Barcon said. ,
Mine-Mill representatives at
another meeting with company
officials on .March 17 said that
there had been a great change

‘local union meeting. Members vital» to the continuity of operation. _
istmen and pumpmen, did report  '

in the company’s attitude. Bar-
con indicated too that safety

conditions would be a’ major
issue in forthcoming negotia-  "

/

tions. The present contract ex-'

pires on June 30. g
’ Included in the list of safety

hazards compiled by the union‘

were excessive blasting during
the shift, robbing muck piles
while men are working on them,
inadequate ventilation, men

working alone, inadequate clear-. _ 

ance for man-cars. Also, brakes
in poor order on motos, oil on

the floor at transloader station, 
transloaders running without .

brakes, lack of covers on draw-
holes, and blasting lines on

same side of drift as light lines

and 440 volt lines.
