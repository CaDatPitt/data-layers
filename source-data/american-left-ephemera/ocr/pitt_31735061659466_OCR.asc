The ﬁfth column’s ﬁrst and most important job is to under-
mine and break national unity. To build and maintain national
unity requires us to expose, isolate, and crush Hitler’s ﬁfth
column in the United States, with all its dupes and stooges. The
ﬁfth column is Hitler’s “secret weapon” with which he rose to
power, with which he prepared his invasion of one country after
another. It is the weapon upon which Hitler (depends especially
to conquer the United States. -

If you want to know who are the ﬁfth column, ask what Hitler
wanted most of all to accomplish in the United States in the
past two years in order to prepare to conquer u-s. The answer is,
obviously, that Hitler most of all wanted to keep apart and
hostile the two most powerful nations in the world, the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R., to prevent that ﬁghting alliance of these two coun-
tries with England, and, after the alliance had been made, to
weaken and undermine it.

Who has been ‘the most active creating issues and rousing
sentimen.ts which tended to make more difficult the consumma-
tion of the alliance of those powerful nations which could seal
Hitler’s doom? When you answer that question you have the
names of Hitler’s chief ﬁfth. columnists in the United States.
And,vamazingly enough,’ we ﬁnd them in positions of inﬂuence
and prestige, working away quite industriously in a way to
delight the hearts of Hitler and Goebbels in Berlin.

What names would head that list? Each one will have his own
opinion, according to hisown observations. Certainly one would
be that of a prominent -American ex-statesman who was chief
organizer in the U.S. of arms for Field Marshal Baron von Man-
nerheim, whose American-made planes are today sinking Ameri-
can ships. off Murmansk. Fantastically enough, the same issues of
the newspapers last week which hailed this person as a most
important advisor‘ on how to make peace (presumably without
victory, for he has no word forthat), also report in their news
columns that hisvprotégé Mannerheim has just visited Hitler to
re-pledge. his fealty and to plan his new attacks against the
American supply line to the Soviet Union, while Mannerheim’s
agent Procope sits in Washington gathering information for his
chiefs. Thus far are we from really combating the ﬁfth column!

Another, if "less illustrious, name on our list, would have to be
Congressman Martin Dies. Who worked so hard as he over years
to the single end of creating every possible obstacle to under-
standing and -agreement between the two great powers whose
unity was and is essential to the safety and survival of each, the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R.P I advise everyone to read and re-read

Martin Dies’ book, The Trojan Horse in America; A Report

to the Nation.

From the typewriter of the man whom Congress placed in
charge of protecting our country from the ﬁfth column, this
book is the prize exhibit of what the ﬁfth column and its master
Hitler wanted most of all in this country. It is an impassioned
indictment of the Soviet Union, and of Joseph Stalin, as the
deadly enemy, practically the only serious enemy, of the United
States. He foresees that the U. S. will join in the war against the
Soviet Union, but not against Germany.

Americans‘ are branded by Dies as “traitors” because they
refused to endorse in advance Mr. Dies’—and Hitler’s—war
against the Soviet Union. Mr. Dies did and wrote everything‘
in his power to prevent the establishment of the United Nations,
and the U. S.-U.S.S.R. alliance, which today is our greatest guar-
antee of victory over Hitler. Those who believed Martin Dies-
and he has but recently been again endorsed by Congress—must
hold a deadly fear of our Ally, the Soviet Union, must consider
the alliance an unfortunate accident or great mistake-in short,
must think exactly as Hitler wishes them to think in order the
better to soften up, isolate, and ﬁnally conquer the United States
as he has done with unfortunate France.

Surely Hitler ﬁnds Martin Dies’ work of more value to his
campaign of world conquest than even the open pro-Nazism of
Laval, Doriot, or Quisling, because it contributes to confusing
and defeating the greatest prize of all, the U. S. A. It is not for
nothing that the Berlin radio has long praised Martin Dies as
the best authority on America.

Uncover the trail of Martin Dies, and it will lead to most of t

the nests of Hitler's agents in the U. S. whose mission is to break
up national unity, throw the public into turmoil, sow suspicion
and fear of our Allies, and block the way to an all-out effort to

9

.-

  

win the war. It will lead to a number of politicians, publicists,
newspapers, radio commentators, political groupings—and be-
hind them Tory industrialists and ﬁnanciers, our American coun-
terparts of the German,Krupps and Thyssens. A

My own enforced sojourn for fourteen months in the solitudes
of Georgia was an incidental by-product of the desperate efforts
of world reaction, headed by Hitler, to prevent by all means
the realization of the U.S.-Soviet Alliance which I, as the spokes-
man for my party, had long advocated as essential to the national
interests of our own country as to the whole freedom—loving
world.

Today it is the official policy of the U. S. Government that the
defense of the Soviet Union is vital to the national interests of
the_ American people. There is ‘much merit in the thought ex-
pressed recently by Walter Lippmann that Russia regardless of
its prevailing regime was always the natural ally of the U. S.; it
is a hundred times truesince Russia became the Socialist Soviet
Union. ,

Today, it is universally admitted that the Soviet Union under
Stalin’s leadership—so viciously denounced over the years by the
ﬁfth column—saved the -world from Hitler’s conquest when it
turned back the Nazi invasion. What MacArthur termed “the
greatest military achievement in all history” saved the Soviet
Union from slavery, and at the same. time gave to Britain and
the United States the possibility of victory, saved civilization
itself. . ,

But today we still have in our U. S. statutes a whole series of
laws, based upon the assumption that '-the Soviet Union is the
enemy of civilization in general and "of the United States in
particular, and outlawing as “foreign agents” those Americans
who over the years have looked upon the Soviet Union as a
friendly power and potential ally, These laws were largely the
result of Martin Dies’ propaganda, and therefore are shaped. in a
way to please and serve Hitler. They are the peculiar product of
Hitler’s technique of international conquest. I refer to the anti-
Communist laws.

Most persons still think the anti-Communist laws are to sup-
presssome obnoxious and disagreeable, if not dangerous, people
10

 

 

who belong to a small minority party and are therefore not of
much importance even if an injustice is being done. I speak
against these laws not as a matter of injustice, but as an injury
to American democracy. These laws and the witch-hunt and
purges authorized by them are a Hitlerite poison at the very
well-springs of American political and social life. They tear
down the American democratic electoral system. They are being
used to disrupt national unity and hamper the war effort. They
are the instruments of Hitler’s hidden invasion of the United
States. They must be wiped out, not in the interests of the Com-
munists, but in the interests of winning the war. Every listener
will know from his own experience and observation the serious
disruption of our democratic processes that comes from the red-
baiting campaign. _

From the moment this global war and our participation in it
became inevitable, the Communist Party declared for the un-
conditional subordination. of all issues to that one issue of win-
ning the war. We meant, among other things, that our proposals
for socialism in our country will not be brought forward in any
way that could disrupt national unity for the war effort. It does
not mean; as some persons have charged, that we advocate that
all redress of grievances should be postponed until the war is
won. A typical and pressing demand for redress of grievances is
that being ‘made by Negro citizens for the removal of disabilities
and (liscriminations which have long denied their full‘ rights un-
der the Constitution.' The Communist Party supports these
demands of the Negro people unconditionally, and we declare
that they must be granted now, at once——precisely in the interests
of national unity, of utilizing every productive force, for winning
the war. Support for the war requires support for the demands
of the Negro people, and not silence on these demands or their
denial.

A leading Negro paper, the New York Age, in its current issue,
while recognizing the Communist Party as an outstanding ﬁghter
for Negro rights “until the war,” assumes that we are sacriﬁcing
Negro rights to the needs of the war, and have made our peace
with-race prejudice, in order not. to come into collision with
Southern Democrats and their “white suprenracy” dogma. Such

11

  

an assumption is nonsense, as we have always proved by our
work, and can arise only from a misunderstanding.

We consider the “white supremacy" slogan of Southern Bour—
bons one of the greatest dangers to the U. S. in this war, tending
to drive away from us our allies and potential allies in, Asia,
Africa and part of the Americas; only as we prove this “white
supremacy” ideology does not represent the. United States can
these allies have trust in us. We consider it necessary to ﬁnd
immediate remedies to the grievances, of the Negroes, in a way
that will help, not hinder, the successful prosecution of the war.
This is quite possible, since the Negroes are overwhelmingly
supporting the war, and the Administration has proved its sin-
cere desire to work in this direction.

No, there is not the slightest reason for misunderstanding be-«

tween any Negro leaders and "the Communists because of our
support of the war’; and we should give no opportunity for
douibtful forces to speculate with misunderstandings. In the
course of the war we Americans will wipe out the shame of a
Hitler-like race discrimination among American citizens, the
anti—Negro laws and customs, and the newly rising anti-Semitism
along with it. '

Just as the blows of war have forced Britain to revise her
whole approach to India, so the U. S. is being forced to recon-
sider the position of the only “subject nation” under U. S.
domination—Puerto Rico. We cannot win a People's War for
National Liberation by ourselves continuing to hold a people in
“subjection." It is a disgrace that our government continues to
treat the purest Puerto Rican patriots as “criminals” and “trai-
tors,” just as the British for so long treated the Irish, with such
dire results for themselves. Let us not, like the Cripps Mission
to India, repeat the old mistake of “too little and too late.”
Puerto Rico is not a mere military outpost of the U. S., it is
above all a Latin American nation. It must be treated as such,
or we compromise our moral standing, in a war where morals
and morale play an ever more decisive part.

One ﬁnal word; the pacts announced. on June 11, establishing
the Anglo-Soviet-American Alliance, not only decided on the
immediate problems of crushing the Axis. They also, and equally

12

 

 

important for winning the war, outlined a post~war collaboration
for the common tasks of world reconstruction. In the Anglo-
Soviet Pact this is embodied in a formal twenty-year alliance.
This is of enormous signiﬁcance, opening up a new era in inter-
national relationships, with consequences we now can only begin
to understand. It is the complete refutation of all pessimists and
prophets of evil, who would weaken our will to victory now by
picturing disasters to come after the war. The freedom-loving
nations, whether capitalist like the U.S.A. or socialist like the
Soviet Union, or some intermediate forms that may appear, are
pledging themselves to peaceful co-existence and collaboration
in the post-war world. All men who deeply desire the full extir-
pation of Nazism in all its varieties from the world will not only
greet this announced program as an ideal, -but will shape their
every word and deed to helping to bring its full realization

— in life. .

With full faith in the justice of the United Nations’ cause,
as a People's War of National Liberation; with full faith that
our own true national interests coincide with those of other peo-
ples; with pride and con.ﬁdence’in American labor’s mighty con-
tributions to our nation’s war; with strict adherence to principle
as the only sure guide to effective solution of all domestic and
international problems; with the inspiration of the glorious
achievements of our Soviet Ally in this war; with conﬁdence
British and American arms will earn their full share of the glory
of ﬁnal victory——we join our voices -to the call to -all Americans:

Unite for victory! , ’

Open the, Western Front now and smash Hitler in’ 1942! .

Everything for the destruction of the Nazi-Fascist Axis! .

(Speech delivered at Madison Square
Garden, New York, July 2, 1942.)

II. ‘WHEN DO WE BEGIN TO
FIGHT?

LMOST ten months after the United States is fully com-
mitted to the war against the Axis we are being told that
“the United States is losing the war, period.”

Loss of this war means destruction of our nation and slavery
for our people. Yet we are told that we are losing this war. That
would seem to be a matter to get excited about, something to
call for action.

We are losing this war before we have well begun to ﬁght.

Would it not be more accurate to say that we are losing this
war because we have not begun to ﬁght?

What is the matter? Whence comes this seeming paralysis
which keeps our tremendous military potential idle at the mo-
ment our fate and the fate of the world are being decided?

Roy Howard, Hearst and the Patterson-McCormicks, the chief
newspaper spokesmen for the modern Copperheads, give the
double-barreled answer that the people are not behind this war
and that the President is bungling it. But they are liars, and they

~ spread the lies that please Hitler. The people are behind this

war to the end, they are ready for every necessary sacriﬁce, they
are impatient to go ahead. The President is doing the best he
can with advisers who keep jogging his elbow and holding back
his arm; he can only be criticized for hesitating to sweep these
michief makers out of his councils, and for failing to crack down
on the defeatist newspapers.

Let us frankly face the facts, however, that the defeatist poison
penetrates and tends to paralyze the war policies of our govern-
ment in Washington. We must learn how to locate the seats of
this poison, in order to eliminate them. .

Look ﬁrst of all at the Paciﬁc front. Our armed forces in the
Paciﬁc have already demonstrated that they have a ﬁghting spirit
ﬁt for any task given them. But what about the policies which
direct the ﬁghting spirit? They are not yet serious ﬁghting war
policies! .

.14

I charge that powerful appeasement forces in the State Depart-
ment in Washington are deliberately withholding one million
of the most effective soldiers in Asia, keeping them out of the
ﬁght against the Japanese, and thereby releasing that many
Japanese soldiers for action against our boys in the South Paciﬁc.

I charge that it is on the advice of reac-tionary ofﬁcials in the

. State Department that Chiang Kai-shek is keeping his best

armies out of the war. The army under General Hu Chung-han,
with 440,000 troops, is engaged not in ﬁghting the Japanese, but
in blockading the Chinese Eighth Route Army in the north and
northwest, ‘and hampering that army in its ﬁght against the
Japanese; the army under General Tang En-po, with 500,000
troops, is engaged not in ﬁghting the Japanese but in blocking
the Chinese New Fourth Army in central and eastern China, and
hampering that army in its ﬁght against the Japanese. These two
Chinese armies, the best equipped and trained in all China,
totaling almost a million men, are being conﬁned to blockading
the Chinese Communist armies and territories, because the State
Department in Washington has informed Chungking’s represen-
tatives that our Government would be displeased if complete
unity was established in China between the Kuomintang and the
Communists. These ofﬁcials continue the old policy of “war
against the Communists” in China, they tell Chungking it ‘must
continue to ﬁght the Communists if it wishes U. S. friendship,
and they thereby accept responsibility‘ for withdrawing a million
Chinese troops from the war against Japan, and keep China back
from full unity in this war. _

What suicidal nonsense is this, by which persons-who speak for
our own government keep the best Chinese ﬁghters out of the
war and create a gap which must be ﬁlled by a million American
boys? _

This is not a way to ﬁght a war of survival, this is '21 sure way
to continue to lose the war.

Our attitude toward Europe is equally ambiguous. Our State
Department continues to do business with Mannerheim Finland,
Franco Spain, and Vichy France, three puppet regimes of Hitler,
to feast the representatives of these Nazi agencies in the highest
Washington society, to send vital materials_ to them, and to

15

 

   

appease them in every way while they conduct active war against
the United Nations. . .

This two-faced attitude of the State Department toward
Europe ﬁnds its highest expression in the campaign being waged
through the defeatist press against the opening of the Second
Front in Western Europe. Of course it is impossible to carry on a
policy of appeasement of Mannerheim, Franco and Laval, and at
the same time energetically prepare the immediate Second Front
in Europe. Find those ﬁgures in our government who push
through this appeasement policy, and there you will ﬁnd the high
opponents of the Second Front. They are the men who keep our
men, guns, planes, and tanks in idleness while our fate is being
decided at Stalingrad, where men, women, and children hold off
the full might of a Nazi-occupied Europe without counting the
cost to themselves. »

The only way to stop losing this war is to begin seriously to
ﬁght it. And to ﬁght it we must overcome the inﬂuence of Mun-
ichism, of appeasement, of defeatism, in the United States itself,
This Munich inﬂuence is not among the ‘people, and it does not
proceed from our Commander-in-Chief; it is entrenched in some
high ofﬁcials of the State Department, some members of the
Cabinet, in a disorganized Congress, dominated by a clique of
Vandenbergs, Wheelers, Brookses and Dieses, several powerful
industrialists, and ‘above all, in the newspapers of Patterson-
McCormi-ck, Hearst, and Roy Howard, which poison the mind of
the country with defeatism day after day. The people must be
roused and organized in sup-port of the President against this
cabal of the Munichmen.

These days we are being shown the most astonishing depths of
depravity to which the defeatist newspapers will descend in their
ﬁght against the Second Front. I wish to impose upon you for a
few moments to turn the microscope upon an example of this
moral and intellectual rottenness. I pick up Roy Howard's news-
paper for Sept. 29, where this defeatist speaks through his hired
scribbler, William Philip Simms. At the moment of crisis of the
battle of Stalingrad, this miserable voice ﬁnds it possible to whine
that he “would appreciate a little more cooperation from the
Russians." In that ‘phrase we can see the spirit of a Laval or
16

 

 

Doriot, the spirit that rotted out the heart of the French Re-
public and delivered that nation over to Hitlerite bondage.
“A little more coo eration from ‘the Russians,” cries Roy
P

‘Howard through the pen of Mr. Simms! At such a sound, every

decent American should vomit, in revulsion at the monstrous
thought that this could be America’s answer to Stalingrad.’ “A
little more cooperation from the Russians,” while certain gentle-
men in high places in the United States and Britain carefully
calculate the last and ﬁnal buttons on the uniforms of our boys.
which will make it “safe” to throw them into the battle.

Nothing could -be further from the spirit of America’s youth,

‘ in and out o-f the armed forces, than the rotten defeatism, ap~

peasement and cowardice expressed in this slogan of Roy
Howard.

The spirit of our boys in the Army, Navy, Marines and Air
Force is expressed in opposite slogans:

“Let’s give some ﬁghting cooperation to our heroic Russian
Allies!”

“When do we begin to ﬁght?”

“Open up the Second Front in Europe now!” . _

Let us not drop Roy Howard’s man Simms, however, without
looking deeper into the cesspool of his mind. What kind of
cooperation does he want from the Russians that he is not getting
in the most _magniﬁcent battle for freedom in all history?
“Perhaps this may require explanation,” remarks Mr. Simms,
Indeed it does. And what is Mr. Simms’ explanation? He explains
that he wants the Russians to teach the Americans and British
how to ﬁght. “The one place really to learn war is in war,” says
Mr. Simms, and “Moscow still refuses” to permit Americans
to learn how to make war in that “one place.” That, says Mr.
Simms, is why we have no Second Front. Our officers and soldiers
don’t know how to ﬁght and the Russians refuse to teach them!
Therefore there is nothing to do but wait until Timoshenko

‘gets time and leisure to open up a school for us!

I wonder what American Army oﬂicers think of this kind of
argument? I think I know. I think the vast majority will “give
theworks” to anybody who tells them they cannot open up a
Second Front because they do not know how to ﬁght. They have

17 ’

.a

  

already learned the great lesson the Russians have taught the
world, that the way to ﬁght is to ﬁght, to push aside all the
hesitators and appeasers and if necessary to shoot them, to go to

battle and put everything you have into it, to engage the enemy,"

to kill him, to get into the battle without delay, to ﬁght, ﬁght,
and ﬁght again until the Hitler Axis is crushed.

Yes, it is true, the one place really to learn war is in war. But
who is holding us back from learning war by making war? It is
the Roy Howards, the Hearsts, the Patterson-McCormicks, and
their fellow-appeasers and one-time friends of Hitler, who now
join together in their obscene outcries against the Second Front.
The Second Front is the practical school in which British and

American soldiers will learn how to smash Hitlerism. We are all V

learning and will learn from the mighty achievements of the Red
Army and the Soviet people, but we will not allow the worthy
idea of learning from them to be used for the purpose of delaying
our joint action with them in a two-front war.

Young people of America have no part or parcel of the appease-

_ ment conspiracies. Defeatism is the property of old and corrupt

reactionaries and their hired men. No young person could
possibly live in their stiﬂingatmosphere. Young people are par-
ticularly immune to the counsels of cowardice and capitulation.
A thousand times they prefer to risk their lives in combat with
Hitler’s hordes than to risk the living death of _ the Vichyﬁed
America, the slavery of a Hitlerite world. Our young people are
demanding the chance to ﬁght. They are the front lines of the
movement for a Second Front now. They will not permit their
future and the future of the world to be gambled away by the
Munichmen of appeasement and defeatism. They want to know:
When do we begin to ﬁght?

The Young Communist League, dedicating tonight its service
flag, has as high a percentage of its members in the armed forces
as any group of Americans. And this is not the ﬁrst time the
Young Communists have given their best members to the armed
struggle against the Axis. Not less than one-third of the Lincoln
Battalion, composed of Americans who gave their lives to stop
the Axis in Spain in 1936 to 1938, were from the Young Commu-
nist League. This ﬁrst American expeditionary force against the

18

 

 

Axis, defending the Spanish Republic from the Hitler assassins,
gave their lives in order to prevent the present war; if their warn-
ings and their example had been heeded and followed, the Axis
would have been ‘broken before it could -challenge the entire
world. But their bloodwas not spilled in vain.‘They left an
imperishable and gloriousvtradition, fully in the spirit‘ of the
Stalingrad of today. They helped to hold the Axis hordes outside
the gates of Madrid for thirty-two months. They were fully
representative of the youth of America today, a youth which is
ready and eager to strike Hitler's gangs now in Western Europe,
and guarantee that they will not have to stop them on American
soil later on.

There is no room for any issue in our country today except the
issue of how most quickly and effectively to crush the Hitlerite
Axis. There is no room for partisanship or special interests.

’There must be national unity of all men and women regardless
of race, creed, or class, who are ready to subordinate all else to,

victory. There must be international unity among all the United
Nations, who win or lose, stand or fall, together. And at this
moment all this is summed up in one issue,‘ whether our country
can meet the crisis of war with honor, whether we win through to
freedom, or go down into slavery, whether we have the quality of
victors or whether we shall be shamefully defeated without even
having fought—all this is summed up in the one issue of the
immediate opening of 'the Second Front in Europe.

We ask our Commander~in-Chief: When are we going to fight?

(Excerpts from a speech delivered
to Young Communist League Rally,
New York, October 2, 1942.)

III. AN INTERVIEW WITH
SUMNER WELLES

N The Worker of October 4 I made charges that persons
Iwhom I designated as “reactionary oﬂilcials in the State
Department” were encouraging the maintenance_of a situation

19

  

 

in China harmful to the war effort of our country and its allies.
I spoke of strained relations between Kuomintang and Com-

munists, resulting in the immobilization of large numbers of '

the best troops of that country.-

Upon the invitation of Mr. Sumner Welles, the Under Secre-
tary of State, I visited him in his office on October 12, in com-
pany with Mr. Robert Minor, and heard from him, and from
Mr. Lauchlin Currie, Administrative Assistant to the President,
a detailed refutation of my charges in this respect. The informa-
tion received from Mr. Welles and Mr. Currie convinced me
that my charges had been made on- the basis of "incomplete
information. I believe it is established that no responsible oflicial
of the State Department is contributing to disunity in China,
and that the policy of the U. S. Government is being exerted
in the opposite direction.

I am therefore more than happy to retract those charges with-
out reservation. What I had thought of as a heavy door that

needed pushing open proved to be but a curtain of lack of in-

formation. Since many persons in the U. S. and in China also-
are without that information which I lacked before visiting Mr.
VVel1es, I believe our war effort will be beneﬁted if I make
public that -portion of Mr. Welles’ remarks which was given to
me in written form. -
Mr. Welles’ memorandum follows:

“With regard to the speciﬁc ‘charge that it is on the advice of
reactionary officials in the State Department that Chiang Kai-
shek is keeping his best armies out of the war,’ the si'mple fact
is that the nearest a proach to ‘advice’ given by any officials in
the Department of tate in this context has been an expression
of an opinion that civil strife in China, at all times unfortunate,
would be especially unfortunate at a time when China is-en-
gaged in a desperate struggle of self-defense against an armed
invader. The implication of this expression of opinion was that
the Chinese Government should try to maintain peace by
processes of conciliation between and among all groups and
factions in China. And the course which Chiang Kai-shek has
been pursuing is not ‘keeping his best armies out of the war.’
Both the armies of the National Government and the ‘Com-
munist’ armies. are ﬁghting the Japanese. No Chinese armies are

20

 

actively engaged in large-scale offensive operations against the
]apanese—for the reason, principally, that there is lacking to all
Chinese armies types and amounts of equipment which are
essential to such operations; but this situation is one which both
the Chinese Government and the American Government are en-
deavoring to remedy as equipment becomes available.

“With regard to the speciﬁc charge that ‘the State Department
in Washington has informed Chungking’s representatives that
our government would be displeased’ if complete unity was
established in China between the Kuomintang and the Commu-
nists,’ what this statement alleges is the exact opposite of the
fact. The State Department in Washington has at all times taken
the position, both in diplomatic contexts -and publicly, that the
United States favors ‘complete unity’ among the Chinese people
and all groups or organizations thereof.

“With regard .to the speciﬁc charge that ‘these oﬂicials continue

the old policy of “war against the Communists” in China,’ this -

government has had no such policy, either ‘old’ or new. This
government has in fact viewed with skepticism many alarmist
accounts of the ‘serious menace’ of ‘Communism’ in China. We
have, for instance, as is publicly and well known, declined to be
moved by Japanese contentions that presence and maintenance
of Japanese armed forces in China were and would be desirable
for the purpose of ‘combating Communism.’

“With regard to the speciﬁc charge that oﬂicials of this govern-
ment ‘tell Chungking it must continue to ﬁght the Communists
if it wishes United States friendship,’ the simple fact is that no
officials of this government ever have told Chungking either that
it must ﬁght or that it must continue to ﬁght the ‘Communists’;
this government holds no such brief; this government desires
Chinese unity and deprecates civil strife in China; this govern-

States friendship contingent; it regards unity within China,
'unity within the United States, unity within each of the coun-

against the Axis powers and toward creation and maintenance
of conditions of just peace when the United Nations shall have
gained the victory which is to be theirs.” -

IVQ ,,§HOW THE PRESS TREATED
7 THE WELLES MEMORANDUM

HAVE been astounded at the way the great metropolitan
dailies of "New York treated the well-considered and histori-
cally" valuable words of Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles
concerning China. .
Mr. Welles had given a statement on American foreign policy
of the most tremendous and far-reachingtsigniﬁcance; I gave the

, statement to the public through the newspapers, accompanied

by a little incidental thing, that Browder had retracted some
charges which had been based upon the absenceof such a clarif-
ication before, and that in the light of this declaration the

,’ charges had to be withdrawn. The newspapers thought that my

retraction of charges was very important and merited consider-
able space, but the declaration of policy by the Under Secretary
of State was thrown into the waste basket.

I don’t understand that scale of values because whatever one
may think of the individuals involved, Mr. Sumner" Welles
speaks for the greatest governmental power in the world and I

 

am -spokesman only for a minority party. Well, that is only one «

of the strange and queer things whichour press gives us every
day. I don’t know whether they threw Mr. Welles’ statement
into the waste basket because they didn’t understand the signiﬁ-
cance or because they did understand and disapproved. Maybe
it was both—those who didn’t understand its importance threw
it into the waste basket, and those who did understand didn’t
want anyone else to know of it. But it is an important statement.
I don’t know how many of you read it; I know no one has read
it who doesn’t read the Daily Worker.

As Mr. Welles says, the policy thathe states in his memoranl
dum is a policy which comes directly out of the ﬁles of the State
Department, in the registration of declaration after declaration
of the American Government. But while this policy is not new,
itis not generally known, and this memorandum is new; coming
at this moment, it deepens and unfolds that policy of America
which was latent before, which was implied before, but which

22

 

._._,_,_

now is more than implied; it has been publicly stated, and by
being stated at this moment becomes active where before it was
not active.

What does Mr. Welles say? Both the Nationalist Government
and the so-called Communist armies are ﬁghting the Japanese,
that is, that both together form a part of the forces of the United
Nations; that the Chinese Government and the American Gov-
ernment are preparing to arm adequately all of these forces for
the war against the Axis; that the State Department would be
pleased and the United States Government would be pleased'if
complete unity was established in China between the Kuomin-
tang and the Communists. The form in which he states this is
thatit is the opposite of the truth to say that the State Depart-
ment would be displeased. The positive form is to say that the

_ State Department would be pleased if the Kuomintang and the

Communists would completely unite.

There are many people in Chungking of all parties who must
have been made happy to read that authoritative declaration
that the powerful United States would be pleased if they will
unite the Kuomintang and the Communists and dissolve the
situation that keeps one or two million of the best soldiers
immobilized.

Mr. Welles says that this government is very skeptical of the
so-called menace of Communism; he says that this so-called
menace is an instrument of the Axis to defeat us in this war; he
says that it is in the interests of the United States as well as the
interests of China completely to unify that country, and speciﬁ-
cally unify the Kuomintang and the Communists. He says that
this is a general proposition of American policy in this war-
that the United States regards unity within China, unity within
the United States, unity within each of the countries of the
United Nations group, and unity among the United Nations as
utterly desirable toward effectively carrying on war against the
Axis powers and toward creation and maintenance of conditions
of a just peace when the United Nations shall have gained the
victory which is to be theirs. That is the kind of unity, that com-
plete, all-embracing unity that he hopes China will achieve, that
he recommends for the United States and for all the United Na-
tions and among the United Nations.

23

  
 

 

In the face of such a declaration I was more than happy and
did not hesitate one second to respond instantly to Mr. VVelles
that I accepted his words as valid without reservation and that
I would take the first opportunity to make this as broadly known
as possible and I would correct any false impressions that might
ﬂow out of the speech I made on. October 2. My statement to
the press was carrying out that engagement which I undertook
with Mr. VVelles, which I did with a whole heart and truly with-
out reservations. ‘ ,

I was able to accept this statement without reservations be-
cause I know we are living through a moment in history when
words such as this, once they are uttered, never can cease to have
effect on real life. Because these are not mere words. They are
not the products of wishes and ideology. They are the product
of the iron necessities of this war, if we expect to win it. They
are the beginnings of a realization of a win-the-war policy for
America. including the State Department, that we are in a war
which we must lose if we do not ﬁnd the correct policies, if we
do not mobilize every available force in this war, if we do not
stop once and for all this sinister and suicidal immobilization of
our own forces. If we do not throw everything we have into this
war. we may lose it, and that consciousness is forging a foreign
policy for our country which is bringing. out and developing
all the unused latent implications of the democratic phrases in
which our nation’s foreign policy has been stated in the past,
but which have not hitherto been fully implemented and have
been sabotaged by crafty reactionary special interests.

I/Ve are now bringing all of the democratic potentialities of our
country into active operation, taking them off the. paper and
putting them into practice. That process is only the beginning.
We have far yet to go, but once that process is well begun, and I
think it is, itwill guarantee victory for the United Nations in
this war. '

_ers~ S(:hoo_l gathering October 16, 1942.)

V. NOW IS THE TIME TO FIGHT

E ARE in this global war, the war which will decide the
fate of -all mankind. If the Axis wins, there will be no
United States. There will be universal slavery.

It is eleven months since Pearl Harbor. Victory must still be
won. We are far from victory as yet and the record of the past
ten months is not one with which America can be satisﬁed. Vic-
tory requires the full effort of each and all of the United Nations.
The United States is not yet exerting its full effort.

This is your problem and mine and it will be solved only to
the degree that you and I take it up and solve it. This is a peo-
ple’s war. It is a United Nations’ war and only as we ﬁght it
unitedly with all our Allies can we win the victory.

If Hitler and his Axis partners can take up his enemies one
at a time, as he has succeeded in doing so far, then there is a
grave danger that Hitler may win the war. This fact does not
seem to be clear before the country as yet.

So far only one of the United Nations is ﬁghting this war with
everything she has. This is the Soviet Union. At Stalingrad and
onthe rest of the Eastern Front the Red Army is holding back
the full force of 300 Nazi divisions, with a Hitler—occupied Eu-

’ rope behind them. Hitler has only forty divisions of second and

third grade troops in Western Europe. And Hitler’s troops in
Western Europe are so weak that even the conquered peoples are
beginning to rise and ﬁght them successfully'without any help
from the West. V .

Where are we? Some people are wailing about the loss of a
cup of coffee. Some are wailing about the hardships of gasoline
rationing. But, most important, defeatists are still permitted to
go up and down the land virtually unchallenged. They are still
allowed to stand before the people as candidates for public oflice
—men whose ambition it is to negotiate a “peace” with Hitler in
hopes that Hitler might take them in as junior partners.

Where are we? There is nothing wrong with American ﬁghters.
They have proved their qualities wherever they have had a
chance at the enemy, such as at Bataan and the Solomons. Ameri-
can ﬁghters are as good as any in the world. They’re raring to

2'3

  

go against the center of the Axis: Hitler, Germany. The one
cry that goes up from our army camps, whether in this country
or in England, is the question. “When do we begin to ﬁght?"
“When do we open up that Western Front?”

People who are afraid to ﬁght and afraid to die are destined
to be slaves of Hitler. But Americans are not of that breed,
Americans are going to ﬁght. Why, then, are we still sitting on
the sidelines, cheering our heroic Allies of the Soviet Union?
Why aren’t wein there ﬁghting against Hitler? ‘. . . A

The urgent need of establishing a Second Front in Europe in
1942 was proclaimed simultaneously from Washington, London
and Moscow after a series of conferences and agreements between

- these capitals and centers of the military struggle against the

Axis. The declaration of June 11 established the Second Front
in Europe in 1942 as the central strategy of the United Nations.

And yet in the past four or ﬁve months we have been partaking
in the strangest debate that this country or history ever wit-
nessed. Most of our newspapers have been debating whether or
not we can or should open up the Second Front in Europe. We
have chains of newspapers through the United States telling us
that the Second Front is impossible, and then when they-are

compelled to change their tune, they tell us the Second Front -

must be left to the military “experts.”

America has not yet realized that those who are telling us
that the Second Front is impossible, or that it must be left to
the military “experts”—who may decide it is impossi-ble—are
telling us that victory is impossible, are trying to prepare the
way to negotiate a Vichy “peace.”

One is either for the Second Front, or one is for delay and
eventual capitulation to Hitler. There is no other course. If we
are for victory over the Axis, we must be for the Second Front.
There is no room for any discussion on this except, possibly, as
to the time and force of the blow. The time is already late. The
time is now. The blow must be powerful and concentrated on
the decisive front in Europe. It must be a concerted blow, coali-
tion warfare of all the United Nations.

. . . Examine some of the objections to the Second Front raised
by our newspaper military “experts," the typewriter strategists,

26

and others. They declaim against the “popular clamor” for the
Second Front. They say it is unfortunate pressure on our General
Staff which should be left free to make its decision without
pressure.

Who ever before heard of a general staff which was embar-
rassed by the expression of the people's demand to ﬁght? A
general staff which wants to ﬁght is always happy when the
people and the army clamor for action.

A general staff is embarrassed and disturbed when ‘the people
and the army are passive and are doubtful about ﬁghting. It is a
slander against the American General Staff to say that they are
embarrassed about the demand for a Second Front. I don’t be-
lieve it. I believe in the majority of the leaders of the American
Army and I believe that they want to ﬁght just as much as we
want to ﬁght.

We have known of generals, American generals, who were em-
barrassed by the demand to ﬁght. Lincoln had such a general.
His name was McClellan. He marched his armies up and down
for two years and somehow he always managed to evade a colli-
sion with the forces under General Lee in the South.

Lincoln complained that McClellan had the “slows” and
ﬁnally he had to replace him. He had to make. several changes
before he ﬁnally got Grant in the Supreme Command and found
a general who was ready to ﬁght and ready to lead his army to
victory. . I

I don’t think we have, many McClellans in the United States
Army today. But if we have, I hope President Roosevelt learns
from the experience of Lincoln and doesn't wait two years, but
cleans them out right now. . . . -

Well, what about the other objections to the demand for a
Second Front? Two weeks ago we had a strange objection raised
in the convention of the American Federation of Labor held in

Toronto. The representative of the British trade unions, jack

Tanner, spoke at that convention on behalf of the British labor

movement and spoke for the Second Front in Europe. .
William Green, President of the A. F. of L., replied to him and

disagreed with him. Green said, in effect, “Yes, we are for the

Second Front——but when it is safe.” This is a new slo an for
g

the war—“safety ﬁrst.” I’m ashamed to speak of this. It dishonors
everything in American history. Imagine George Washington
saying he would ﬁght the enemy when he found that it was safe.
Imagine Grant or Sherman saying that they would ﬁght when it
was safe. Imagine Douglas MacArthur saying that he was looking
for a safe place to ﬁght.

No, that is not the American slogan. The American slogan
was better expressed by that hero of our country who said,
“Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead.” . . .

While we are talking here tonight a patriotic American is
speaking over a nationwide hookup. His name is Wendell Will-
kie and he is expressing some views on this subject. Willkie is
not a military expert. He is a prominent civilian, a political
leader. He may be a ‘Wall Street executive, but this war is
bringing workers and capitalists together on many of the vital
questions of the war. . ‘

Wendell Willkie has been speaking the mind of the common
people of all the world when he called for the Second Front and
said, in his quaint Hoosier way, it might be necessary to prod
the military gentlemen a little bit.

The peoples of the United Nations understand today that the
Second Front is. the keystone to victory. It is the keystone to the

general offensive of the United Nations against the Axis to crush ’

it and bring this war to a speedy conclusion. The masses of the
occupied countries are already rising up ‘to create a Second Front
of their own. They got tired waiting for us. Are we going to
join them? Or are we going to sit it out a while longer, until
Hitler suppresses their risings again? . . .

Who is responsible for our slowness and delays? The Chicago
Tribune will tell you all our troubles come from the President.
But it is not the President who is responsible. It is that coalition
of Copperheads in the United States who have been jogging the
President's elbow, pulling his coattails and stepping on his feet
to make it difﬁcult if not impossible to carry on this war. It is
men like “Curly” Brooks, the candidate of the Chicago Tribune,
like Ham Fish, Vandenberg, Martin Dies, Hoover and their ilk
who are obstructing the opening up of the Western Front, who
are endangering our national war effort and victory.

28

 

\- llll"VlUI-10

And these men follow the line of the Copperheads of 1862,
who made difficulties for Lincoln and who, through their repre-
sentative, Mc_Clellan, at.the head of the Union army, gave vic-
tory after victory to the Southern slaveholders. Theycreated dis-
trust and dissatisfaction in the North. And then they went out
and asked the dissatisﬁed people to vote for them. They claimed
they would “change” things in Washington, that they would
“prosecute” the war more effectively. And the Copperheads car-
ried «the elections in 1862 with this kind of trick.

The modern Copperheads are trying to repeat the same trick

V eighty years later in, the midst of this war of national survival

and liberation.,They who are responsible for obstructing the war
effort try to place the responsibility for their obstruction and
dissension on the President and on all those win-the-war forces
who have been trying to go forward.

This,is why we must redouble the people’s efforts to defeat
the defeatists, especially now on November 3. This is why we
must strengthen national unity around our Commander-in-Chief
and press forward for the establishment of the Second Front in
Europe now. This is the supreme need and task of the hour.

It is the key to victory, the key to developing the alliance of the V

United Nations, the key to winning the “century of the common

!9

man.

(Excerpts from a speech delz'z/ered in the Civic
Opera House, Chicago, October 26, 1942.)

VI. TWENTY—FIVE YEARS OF
SOVIETiPOWER

' THIS twenty-ﬁfth anniversary of the establishment of Soviet

power is witness to the most profound change of the attitude
of the people of the United States as a whole toward the U.S.S.R.
and its great leaders. For the ﬁrst time there is almost universal
understanding of the Soviet Union as a stage in the rise of man-
kind to higher civilization. There is a high and rising evaluation

29

  

of the Soviet Union as the most powerful friend and ally of the
United States. And there is love for and gratitude toward the
Soviet Union as the power which has so far saved this country
and world democracy from destruction by the Axis aggressors.‘

Nothing in modern history has so profoundly stirred the
American masses as the heroic defense of Stalingrad. Americans
know their own fate is being decided in that battle. Americans
are ashamed that the full force of our own country has not yet
been thrown into the scale through the opening of the Western
Front in Europe. For the great mass of Americans now under-
stand full well that they can emerge from this war a free people
only if they ﬁght this war as a part of the United Nations, side by
side with the Soviet Union, in full partnership, unitedly sharing
its costs and burdens in full as they will jointly share the fruits of
victory. __

There are still some reactionary cliques in America which
cling to -their old dreams of helping to destroy the Soviet Union
and making partnership with Hitler in dividing up the world.
They are not large in numbers,»but they are powerful. They are
the most bit-ter opponents of the Second Front and are the advo-
cates of a negotiated “peace” with Hitler. They still dominate
much of the American newspaper world. They represent some of
the most powerful industrial monop-olists in America. Their in-
ﬂuence holds back the immense potential -power of the United
States, and prevents it from being thrown into full action to
smash Hitlerism now. But these native American fascists are
rapidly losing their power over the nation, and have already lost
their control over the minds of the people.

The American people and government are committed to alli-
ance with the Soviet Union for this war and for the post-war
period. American patriots will not tolerate in public life any

 

expression that runs counter to this will of the people. This is.

being demonstrated more and more every day in a thousand
different ways. The Soviet-American alliance has been conﬁrmed
in the hearts and minds of the American masses. On Nov. 7 it will
be the entire nation which celebrates the twenty-ﬁfth anniversary
of the rise of the.Soviet U-.nio.n, including the oflicial leadership
of the United States as well as the masses of the people.

30

 

This does not mean that the United States has turned or is
turning to socialism. Such an interpretation would be radically
false. There is no intimation in the United States of a mass
abandonment _of its capitalist system of economy and society.
There is the general belief that if the United States rises to its
tasks in this war, and fulﬁlls its responsibilities in the crushing

of Hitlerism, it will go into the post-war period as a capitalist’

nation.
But this also is no contradiction to a further fact that the

American people are beginning to understand that the socialist _

society of the Soviet Union is the source of its unparalleled
achievements in the war which restored for the United Nations
the perspective of victory. Socialism, even though not generally

’ accepted for the United States, is no longer looked upon as some-

thing alien and hostile to the American way of life, which was
the view which had long prevailed over the minds of the great
majority of Americans.

On the twenty-ﬁfth birthday of the Soviet Union the Ameri-
can working class and people are more and more raising their
voices to demand an immediate offensive on the Western Front

against Hitlerism. Wendell Willkie expresses, on this issue, the_

sentiment of the‘ American masses, who believe that President
Roosevelt is fully committed to the same demand and are ready
to strengthen his hand by all means, so that all restraining and
hesitating inﬂuences can ﬁnally be brushed aside.

Americans want to ﬁght. They want to ﬁght in full coordina-
tion with' the Red Army, which they respect and love. They want
to ﬁght now. They will never forgive those groups and indi-
viduals responsible for holding them back so long from the
ﬁght. Such is in truth the spirit of the great majority of Ameri-
cans as we come to the historic date of November 7.

For the American people the date November 7 takes its place
alongside of our own July 4, as part of the same forward move-
ment of the human race. Just as Americans have always aﬂirmed
the universal signiﬁcance of our revolution of 1776 and of
George Washington, so now we have come to recognize the uni-
versal validity of November 7, the Soviet revolution of 1917 and
Joseph Stalin. ‘

_ 31

In the ﬁres of the common war against Hitlerism, in the blood
of the best sons of both countries given to a common cause, in
the gathering of the peoples ofhthe world into the United Na-
tions, in the ﬁnal winning of victory through joint struggle, this
American-Soviet friendship and alliance will be so fully sealed
that it will be a great fortress for the collective security and
progress of all peoples in the post-war world. ‘

(The Worker, November 8, 1942.)

VII. ONE YEAR SINCE PEARL
HARBOR

 

WE ARE approaching the anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Our

country has been fully in the war for almost a year. At

last we have taken the initiative with the blow in Africa. It is a

convenient time for stock-taking, for adding up our accounts,
to see where we stand. ’

In the Paciﬁc, after many catastrophes, we have established a

_line of defense which holds over-months, and have even given a

sample of magniﬁcent counter-offensive action in the Solomons.
The total military score for the year, however, remains a stag-
gering loss. We _have but a relative handful of land forces in
contact with the enemy, and naval action remains essentially in
the phase of defense and protection of communication routes.

On the main front, Western Europe, we have as yet engaged
the enemy only in the air, and in naval safeguarding of the sea
routes. We have now secured French Africa from the Axis. In
the course of the ﬁrst year of war, however, we have not yet
been able to establish that Western European front which is the
key to the whole war, the obviously essential measureyfor victory.
The great signiﬁcance of our move into Africa is that it obvi-
ously prepares the Second Front-—-perhaps very soon.

Our ﬁrst year of active war, in short, has been a year of im-
provised defense, and of preparations for war. Now we move
toward offensive war. ’

One great achievement alone stands out in this ﬁrst year, a

32 r

political and diplomatic achievement which laid a ﬁrm founda-
tion for victory——the cementing of the Anglo-S_,oviet-American
coalition and the formation on that basis of the United Nations.

It is clear that our country entered the war appallingly unpre-
pared. It is further clear that we are not yet more than partially
mobilized for the war. I y

Our lack of preparation was only incidentally atlack of the
materiel of war. It was ﬁrst of all moral and political unprepared-
ness. Our national mind, heart, and character were unprepared
and ill-prepared for this Armageddon which decides the future
of all mankind. _

Let us remind ourselves, for a moment, how ill-prepared was
our national mind. We did not, as a nation, know the most
important facts about the dangerous world in which we lived.
We ‘did not even know the most simple facts of the relative
strength of the various governments of the world. We did not
even know that we were ignorant. We thought we knew, but our
opinion was illusion compounded of misinformation, prejudice,
and wishful thinking. It collapsed into dust at the ﬁrst blows

i of war. We found ourselves in war-to-the-death.in a world hith-

erto completely hidden from our eyes by clouds of illusion. We
had to begin, painfully and step by step, to reconstruct com-
pletely our understanding of the world.

We had thought of France, in alliance with Britain, as the
preponderant military power of Europe. But France, rotten with
treason at the head of the state, collapsed even more swiftly and
miserably than had semi-feudal Poland; the British army was
driven from the continent without its arms. Hitler conquered all
Europe west of the Soviet Union at lightning speed and nominal
cost. Our “experts” had misled us. The true relation of forces
was the opposite o-f our opinion.

We had been taught to consider the Soviet Union a weak and
minor power in the European conste1lation._ When Hitler in-
vaded the Soviet Union, even after our Government and Britain
had taken their stand inher support, our “experts” told us he
would conquer that country in a few weeks or months at most.

But the Soviet Union has alone held up the full military power

of Hitlerized Europe for almost seventeen months now, has
33

 

killed or incapacitated 8,000,000 of Hitler’s murderous hordes,
and has presented us and our Allies with the possibility of vic-
tory. Once again our ,“exp\erts’ ” opinions were proved wrong,
but this time we can be happy that they were wrong. '

We had been taught to sneer at Japan as a ‘military power,
and to look upon the British-Dutch Empire as our stronghold
in the Paciﬁc. But after Pearl Harbor, Midway, the Philippines,
we were astounded to witness a few hundred thousand Japanese
soldiers sweep that centuries-old structure away in a few weeks
and occupy the whole South Paciﬁc from India to the gates of
Australia. Once more our “experts’ ” opinions turned out to be
but silly illusions, disastrously ‘silly. i

Mo-re disastrous, however, even than these illusions about rela-
tive power, was our confusion ‘as to who were our enemies and
who our friends. We Americans as a nation helped Hitler’s‘
puppet, Franco, destroy the Spanish Republic, the same Franco
whose network of spies, the Falange, works freely "for Hitler
throughout the United States and Latin America. We supported
the traitors at the head of France, and continued to do business
with them until last Saturday; we went delirious in our gloriﬁca-
tion of Hitler’s ally, Baron Mannerheim of “poor little Finland,”
and give his agents the freedom of VVashington even to this

moment; and we took this course because, as a nation, we had ‘

swallowed entire the gigantic Hitler lie that the Soviet Union
was our enemy. We had been morally “prepared” for war against
the Soviet Union, but we had been systematically “unprepared”
for the coalition with the Soviet Union by which alone we could
defeat Hitler. We even trusted Japan up to the veryghour her
planes bombed Pearl Harbor!

Some persons will say: “Why speak of the past? That is all
changed now. Why raise dead issues?”

It is necessary to speak of the past, however, because it is not
yet dead. We have, as a nation, revised our wrong opinions, but
only very incompletely. We have not yet fully learned the les-
sons of thispast. The slogan “Remember Pearl Harbor” is im-
portant precisely because we must still learn the full lessons of
those" events. '

Allow me to cite a few examples of current continuation of

34

this pre—war thinking in illusions instead» of reality, which leads
to disaster for our nation. In a recent meeting of big industrial-
ists in New York to considerwar policy, the government’s efforts
to organize and plan the war economy were denounced as
“socialism,” and the chairman summed up the sentiment of those
present by saying:

“If we’re going to come out of this war with a Marxist brand
of national socialism then I say negotiate the peace now and
bring Adolf over here to run the show. He knows how. He’s
eﬂicient. He can do a better job than any of us and a damned
sight better job than Roosevelt, who is nothing but a Left-wing
bungling amateur.”

_Here we have a simon-pure American example of the same
treason that destroyed France. And it is deeply embedded among

the big industrialists who control our war economy. This is not

representative of all American industrialists (for example, at the
meeting mentioned, the direct Morgan. and Rockefeller interests
did not join in these treasonable expressions) but it does repre-
sent the business—as-usual capitalists who are ﬁghting against the
essential planning of the war, and who are responsible for the

present economic chaos. If they must submit to governmental

authority for the war, they call that “socialism,” and prefer the
defeat of the United States and its conquest by Hitler.

Clearly, all such talk about the “danger of socialism” is merely
a cover for defeatism bordering on treason. The recent Report of
the Tolan Committee to the House of Representatives, on Octo-
ber 20, proposes a completely centralized national administration
of industry and manpower, working upon a single plan for vic-
tory in the war. Its proposals are embodied in the Kilgore-Pepper
Bill in the Senate and’ the Tolan Bill in the House. The commit-
tee bluntly declares that “our war effort is in jeopardy,” that
“this war can be lost in Washington,” if such a central adminis-
tration is not established. The committee is composed of con-
servative Democrats and Republicans, with not a “Left-winger”
among them. Indeed, Congressman Bender of Ohio, supporting
the report, complains that “some points are not made strong
enough.” And Mr. Bender, leader of the old-line Republican
Party of his state, is a conﬁrmed anti-New Dealer, but clearly

35

   

moved by one single consideration——patriotism, the will to vic-
tory in the war, which he sees is in grave danger unless t-he Tolan
Committee proposals are adopted and carried out energetically.

Indeed, the Tolan Committee proposals are truly national, and
deserve the support of capital equally with that of labor, of the
farmers equally with that of the small industrialists, business-
men and middle classes. It shows the only way in which our
economy can be mobilized to meet the strains of all—out war
without a breakdown. But our business-as-usual industrialists,
who cannot abandon their old pre-war prejudices, ﬁght these
proposals to the death, and are ready to surrender our country
to Hitler rather than see them adopted.

The patriotic men and women of all classes must unite to

save our country from such influences, and thereby save it from.

destruction at the hands of Hitlerism. Victory in the war is the
single over-riding consideration that must govern everyone alike,
regardless of what sacriﬁces may be demanded to that end. Such
proposals as those in the Kilgore-Pepper and Tolan Bills must
be supported by all, whether they are adopted by the Executive
or by Congress.‘ V A .

Another example of this pre-war thinking which damages our
war effort is the campaign of certain newspapers about a sup-
posed “menace of Communism” in the United States. This cam~
paign takes the form of saying: “Yes, we are allies of the Com-
munist-led Soviet Union, and that is all right; but we must all
the more suppress the Communists here at home, for they are
not allies, but dangerous enemies.” - ' .

Now, it is unfortunately still true that most persons do not

see how dangerous this argument is, they do not see where it

leads; they see that American Communists are a very small
minority in the country, and think it makes little difference
one way or the other if the Communists are suppressed. But this
argument is equally as dangerous for our war effort as the openly
pro-Hitler arguments before quoted. This danger is not only
in that it endorses Hitler’s central slogan that he is the savior of
the world from the “Communist menace.” It has immediate,
concrete results that help Hitler in a military way. Allow me
to show a few of these results to you.

Look at China. The Chinese Republic is greatly weakened
today in face of the Japanese invaders by the fact that its unity
is incomplete. There are two powerful parties, the Kuomintang
or government party headed by Chiang Kai-shek, and the
Chinese Communist Party, which leads two powerful armies in
semi-autonomous regions; these two parties, after years of civil
war, patched up a truce in 1937, a kind of national unity, in
face of t-he Japanese invasion, but their relations remain very
much strained. The Kuomintang has, on at least one occasion;
deliberately prevented the Communist-led armies from inﬂicting
a heavy defeat on the Japanese, because they were more afraid
of “communism” than of the Japanese invaders. Today two of
the strongest Chinese Kuomintang armies are occupied in block-
ading the Communist-led armies instead of being used against
the Japanese. -

All this injures not only China, but also the United States;
our government, helping China, does not like to see its help
wasted in internal strife between Kuomintang and Communists.
But when Americans speak to Chinese leaders about this, and
propose to end this senseless quarrel within China, they are
answered: “But you also, in your own country, take exactly the
same position against the Communists that we take in our
country. We are only following your example. If it is necessary
for you to ﬁght the Communists so strongly, where the Commu-
nists are weak, how much more necessary is it for us to ﬁght the
Communists here where they are strong?”

Our government has but recently made a‘ serious effort to
inﬂuence the Kuomintang to make a real peace with the Com-
munists, so that the war can be strengthened against Japan by
_a million or two of the best soldiers in Asia; but it is greatly
to be feared that this appeal will not be successful, because the

Chinese do not take it seriously when over the same wires they .

get news that the U. S. Government is trying to deprive Ameri-
can Communists of their citizenship on the argument that it is
impossible for them sincerely to swear allegiance to _any govern-
ment except a Communist one, and when American newspapers
continually shriek about the “menace of Communism.”

Thus, by our own example at home, we are directly con-

tributing to the situation in China, where two groups of Chinese
armies are watching each other suspiciously and taken away
from the struggle against Japan. In the further course of the
war, if this is not changed, hundreds of thousands of American
boys will pay with their lives for this stupidity.

Or let us take another example, Yugoslavia. Two armies have
been ﬁghting against the German and Italian invaders, the

A Partisan Volunteers led by a united front of‘ all popular parties,

including the Communists, and the Chetniks headed by General
Mikhailovich and supported by the Yugoslavian Cabinet in
London. Recently we learned that Mikhailovich was ﬁghting
against the Partisan Volunteers, on the pretext that he had to
“suppress the Communists,” and had entered into treasonable
relations with the Italians for that purpose. ’

This is a terriﬁc blow against the United Nations, and for the
Axis, and the Yugoslavian Cabinet is itself sharply divided on
the issue. But American newspapers, trained in the necessity for
“suppression of the Communists,” unquestionably support Mi-
khail-ovich and deny his treason. The American Government is
seriously disturbed by this development, but not our newspapers,
who know, without investigation, that anyone suppressing Com-
munists must be in the right. And when American representa-
tives ﬂy into Yugoslavia to ask Mikhailovich to stop ﬁghting the

Communists and to ﬁght Germans and Italians instead, the wily

general will probably read to them a copy of Attorney-General
Biddle’s decision on the Bridges case. Thus Hitler continues to
be strengthened militarily in Europe by the “anti-Communists”
in the United States. A

Now let us take a look at France. Sooner or later, and we must
hope‘ sooner, Britain and America are going to open up the
Second Front, and hundreds of thousands of American boys
will be ﬁghting to the death with German troops on French soil.
We are already calling upon Frenchmen to rise and help throw
out the Germans. Conservative correspondents have united in
the judgment that the only political party in France that has
maintained ‘its organization and extended its inﬂuence despite
German and Vichy suppressions is the ‘Communist Partylof
France._ When our boys go into France are we going to issue
, 38 y A

 

the slogan to the French people: “Arise to throw out the Ger-

'mans and suppress the French Communists”? If we dowe are
simply going to help Hitler again as we have stupidly been ,

doing ever since he emerged from his Munich bierstube. For the
French Communists are ‘an essential and invaluable sector of
the coming French Army of Liberation. They will be as good
ﬁghters on our side as are the Russian Communists. ‘

If we really want to smash Hitler’s Axis and do it as quickly
and efﬁciently as possible, we need the Communists of China, of
Yugoslavia, of France as our allies, even as we need the Com-
munists of the Soviet Union. Yes, we need the Communists of
the United States also for victory, and the Communists of ‘all
lands, not least within Germany itself, where the Communists
are hard at work preparing to blow up the Hitler regime from
within. . A >

Let’s see how Hitler’s slogan of the ‘menace of Communism”
works close at home. I have a memorandum dated July 23, 1942,
circulated in Detroit among management and la-bor circles by an
important oﬂicial, which contains the following paragraph:

6

“There are many Communists in the plants and they cannot
be trusted since their attitude is likely to be guided by whether
Russia remains in the war on the side of the United States, or
not. Russia may or may not remain an ally of the United States.
She deserted the Allies in the last war and may do it again in
this war.”

Here we have the clearest example of the political signiﬁcance
of the “anti-Communist crusade” as it is carried on in the
United States. This is the sort of stuff Radio Berlin spreads to
Britain and America, and aaginst which our government has
warned us many times. It spreads suspicion and distrust against
our most powerful ally, the very one which restored to us the
perspective of victory by single-handedly stopping the Hitlerite
hordes. It sows disunity and suspicion among the war workers,
and throws doubt upon the patriotism and loyalty of every one
who expresses friendship and admiration for the Soviet Union.
It strikes directly against the most zealous guardians of our war
production in the plants. In every way this kind of thing is doing

39

 

  
  

Hitler’s work in America, just as surely as his agents who landed
from U-boats with explosives not one half so dangerous as this.
i We are in this war as a part of the United Nations, at the
head of which stands the coalition of Britain, the Soviet Union,
and the United States. ‘We can win this war only if we ﬁght it
as a United Nations’ war.

We are now entering the stage of active ﬁghting in which
American boys will be giving their lives to smash the enemy,
not in the hundreds but in the tens of thousands. We must unite
the entire country behind them, we must produce everything
they and our allies need, we must stop all arguments which are
not directed to the one question—how to win this war as quickly
as possible. ‘

Unity to win the war requires that we rise above all differences
of political opinion. Democrats, Republicans, Communists, So-

cialists, Prohibitionists,.al1 must work together without regard ‘

to their particular “ism,” and stop ﬁghting one another over the
old labels. The only test is what one is doing to win the war.
Any one who places private interests, his class prejudices, or his
political opinions, in a position of higher importance than the
winning of the war, is thereby moving toward treason to his
country and to humanity. '

The Communist Party of the United States meets this test.
It has proclaimed its policy, and carries out this policy, to sub-
ordinate its own program of socialism to the needs of national
unity that includes all classes. It actively mobilizes the workers
for complete support to the war effort. It helps to work out
democratic solutions for the problems of the war. It offers its
cooperation to all sincere supporters of the war to victory. It
works for the extension of American national unity, and of the
United Nations, for the orderly solution of postwar problems.
The Communist Party is entirely and without reservation a party
of national unity for victory. And we have a contribution to
make which no other group can substitute, a contribution at
home and a contribution in strengthening our country’s position
abroad. '

This fact is being recognized broadly in our country and
throughout the world. Thus, in India, the British authorities

40

 

 

have recently legalized the Communist Party and released all
its leaders from prison even though it supports the independence
movement, because the government learned from experience
that the Indian Communists were the best mobilizers of the
population against Japan. In Canada, the government has re-
cently released all the Communist leaders who had been held in
concentration camps, because it learned that it needed them for
the war effort. In Latin-American countries the Communists are
in the forefront of the ﬁght for alignment with the United Na-
tions, and in Chile the Communists, who are part of the coalition
supporting the government, lead in the ﬁght for declaring war
on the Axis. In Cuba the Communists are part of the govern-
mental coalition, which supports the United Nations. And so it
goes in country after country.

This trend of development-toward all-embracing unity which
includes also the Communists is a part of the general awakening
to the tasks of the war. Wherever persons’ and groups and nations
come to the realization of the gravity, dangers, and dilﬁculties of
the war they want all the help that is ‘available for victory. And
nowhere can they ﬁnd better helpers than the Communists.
Onlyin the United States is this fact not so generally recognized,
at least not by all the departments of the government, for some
of them work at cross-purposes. _ -

Under—Secretary of State Sumner Welles, who has faced some
of these problems concretely in his work, has recently made an
important pronouncement of policy on this question. On Octo-

ber 12 he declared that continuation of the strife between Kuo-C

mintang and Communists in China would be unfortunate; he
indicated that the United States wished to see such problems
settled by processes of conciliation; that the United States would
be pleased to see complete unity accomplished; that the so-called
menace of Communism was looked upon with skepticism as a
pretext of the Axis; that our Government “regards unity within
China, unity within the United States, unity within each of the
countries of the United Nations group, and unity among the
United Nations as utterly desirable toward effectively carrying
on war against the Axis powers.”

That is a policy to which we can declare our unconditional

41

 

support. It is a policy which should be made known throughout
the whole of our population and over the world. It is a policy
which needs to be carried out fully by all departments of the
government and in the armed forces. For it is a policy designed
to bring victory at the earliest possible moment, to reduce the
costs of the war, and to insure a just peace when victory h.as been
attained. ‘

It is not my intention to paint for you a bright picture of the
situation, nor to pretend that the problems of the war have been

, solved or that victory will come easily. No, the Axis will be

crushed only at terrible cost, and with the full exertion of all
our powers. Every step in the development of policy adequate
to victory must itself be fought for, it does not come automati-
cally, heavy obstacles must be overcome.,Correct policies when
established must still be fought for in practical application. And
ﬁnally when we have mobilized all possible resources they must
be thrown into battle against the enemy, and the enemy must be
crushed in deadly struggle. Africa is a ﬁrst step in that direction.

There is no other way.

But Americans do not look for an easy way. They are ready
for the full tasks which alone bring victory. No burden is too
heavy, no sacriﬁce too great, which is necessary for victory. We
will never be Hitler’s slaves nor try to ﬁnd a corner for our‘-
selves in a Hitler-dominated world. The Axis must be destroyed.
That is the only goal which means victory. And for free men
everywhere in the world the issue is victory or death!

‘(Speech delivered in Detroit, November 12, 1942.)

VIII. STORM SIGNALS—THE
PEOPLE MUST KNOW
AND_ACT,

EARS after the great French Revolution, a certain French
Abbé was asked, “What did you do during the great Revo-
lutionP” And the Abbe’ replied, ‘‘I survived.” A similar question,

42

I think, will be asked in the coming years with respect to the
war, only not of individuals but of entire nations: “What did
you do during the great war?” And the nation which is able to
answer as the French Abbé answered is going to be fortunate.
Because" truly this war is a test of the capacity of nations to
survive, for fascism, Nazism, is engaged in the physical destruc-
tion of whole nations and peoples. And the world outside of
the Soviet Union is only beginning to learn how to deal with
Nazism. .

Those who have read my book Vict0ry—and After will remem-
ber that while there is a certain fundamental conﬁdence in the
eventual outcome of the war, I do not in this book engage in any
excessive optimism. Indeed, I very speciﬁcally hold out the pos—
sibility and even the probability that the education of America
to the necessities of this war would be accomplished through a
succession of setbacks and blunders, and I am sorry to say that
the course of events seems to be bearing out this perspective.
Notwithstanding the magniﬁcent Soviet offensive and the initial
success of our African operation, we have not yet won the war.
And one of the most dangerous things in this war at the present
moment is a certain wave of irrational optimism that is sweeping
the country, at least as far as public expressions of opinion are
concerned. Many people are even so [convinced the war is
already won that they are beginning to engage in private schemes
of dividing up the world and settling the post-war problems,
picking out who is going to sit on the throne of which country
when the peace treaty is ﬁnally signed, an act which they seem
to think is just around the corner.

Thus, Otto of Austria is holding court in a hotel on 59th
Street, right on Central Park, and I understand he has already

placed an order with an American ﬁrm for iron crosses, decora- '

tions for the people whom he is going to appoint to the various
Orders of Nobility in the restored Hapsburg empire. Chief of
State Darlan of French North Africa is operating under the
protection of the Stars and Stripes with the same conﬁdence
with which, not many months ago, he operated under the swas-
tika. General Franco pronounced long speeches in Madrid in
which he declares his benefactor, Adolf Hitler, is going to rule

43

  

the world and that that is a good thing, and his speeches are
hailed by the press of the United States as a very comforting
assurance that all is going well in our relations with Spain.
General Mannerheim, a few weeks after he has received the
Order of the Rising Sun from Hirohito and a special decoration
from Adolf in Berlin, enters into negotiations with the ruling
circles in this country under conditions in which he will be re-
cipient of similar blessings as the future ‘ruler of “poor little
Finland.” One could go on and on with examples of the type
of mentality that is attempting to determine how America shall
participate in this war and how we are supposed to win it. We

‘ have even seen boasts in the public press about how special am-

bassadors of the United States are winning the war for us pain-
lessly by special missions in which they carry suitcases full of
gold pieces. _
Perhaps I am a little bit behind the times and fail to appre-
ciate all ‘these modern methods of warfare, but I cannot believe
that we are going ‘to win the war, or that we are in any way
advancing the war with this kind of, policy. One thing is certain,
this policy is cutting off our country from the conﬁdence of the
peoples of Europe. Perhaps if I_ were a narrow partisan I should
be pleased with this development, because, unquestionably, as
a by-product of this, there will be a further expansion of the
mass inﬂuence of the underground Communist Parties through-
out Europe. Whole sections of the population that were holding
themselves aloof from political commitments while waiting for
the American and British forces to enter Europe, when they
expected to crystallize themselves as a people’s movement around
the Stars and Stripes, are abandoning hope of that development
and are crystallizing themselves for independent action under

' their own working class leadership, including the Communists.

I would prefer to see a crystallization of the broadest national
front and people’s coalition, representing the United Nations’
war for the destruction of the Axis. But if the peoples of Europe
are being demobilizedby the mistakes and stupidities of those
who are directing the policies of our country, we certainly can
be glad that they are not being left entirely without leadership.
The best example of this is in Yugoslavia.

44

 

 

 

Two months ago, in fact even as much as two weeks ago, we
were being assured by the most authoritative spokesmen of
American opinion and policy that the hero of Yugoslavia and
one of the heroes of the United Nations is General Mikhailo-
vich. This week even the Saturday Evening Post carries admis-
sions about the role of Mikhailovich which make it clear that
this man and his supporters in the Yugoslav Government in
Londonrepresent people, ideas and policies which are a hun-
dred times closer to Hitler than to the United Nations. These
admissions show that we are dealing with a man who traﬂics with
both sides and who can send dispatches to the United States
claiming credit for military victories against the Axis while actu-
ally engaged in military cooperation with the Axis to kill the
people who won those victories against the Axis.

Of course, in the case of Yugoslavia the process of the amalga-
mation of the Mikhailoviches with the Nazi regime is so rapid
that the farce is already played out and even our most reaction-
ary newspapers have to begin to break the news gently. And I
venture to predict that in the very near future not only will the
Mikhailovich myth completely disappear, but, along with it, the
present Yugoslav government-i.n—exile. Already a real national
front and people’s government has appeared in Yugoslavia itself.
And while it was born in struggle against the Nazi-fascist occupa-
tionists and against the treachery of the emigré government in
London which still has the support of England and the United
States, yet it represents the -broad coalition of all the peoples of
Yugoslavia as represented by their most important political par-
ties. It has a ‘mass base consisting of all the classes in Yugoslavia
except the large landowners. Under the blows of the Nazi cam-
paign of extermination, the Yugoslav peoples have achieved a
unity and a force which are driving the invaders out of district
after district, while the sheer moral weight of their position is
making it impossible to continue all this stage-play of the Yugo-
slavian government-in—exile and its Quisling puppet, Mikhailo-
vich, inside Yugoslavia. -

Thus the Yugoslavian people are ﬁghting the war, gathering
their forces and together with the heroic Partisans in Poland,
‘France, etc., are opening the Second Front in Europe. This

45

people’s army of liberation in Yugoslavia is today engaging
more German forces than all the power of the great United States
one year after we entered the war. These Partisans, who embrace
ﬁghters of all political beliefs and affiliations, who armed them-
selves with guns they took away from the German invaders, kill
more Nazis today than has the United States to date. Likewise
the Communist-led armies in China have conducted more war-
fare against Japan in this past year than has been waged by the
United States. The Communist—led armies in China have not
received a gun or _a dollar in money from the Chiang Kai-shek
Government for over three years. The People's Army in Yugo--
slavia has not received a single bit of help.from England or the
United States. They have conducted more war, each of them
alone, against the enemies of this country than this country has
conducted after spending $46,ooo,ooo,ooo for the war. And today
certain leaders and forces are busily engaged in conditioning the’
country to a policy in the conduct of the war which means not
to strike at the heart of the fascist beast, putting him out of
business as quickly as possible, but which seeks to prepare as
quickly as possible a negotiated peace with the Axis along the
lines laid down by Herbert Hoover just a day or two ago. One
after another, most of our newspapers, including our libera.l
papers, greet the Hoover speech, which was a direct call for a
negotiated peace with Hitler, as constructive statesmanship. Did
you hear any rebukes of Herbert Hoover? Only from the “dis-
reputable” Communists. * »

It is evident that we are not yet adequately learning to make
war; we are not seriously making war with all forces at our
disposal; we have not yet developed real coalition warfare with
our Allies. This dark picture is causing quite a bit of confusion
among liberal circles in the United States. Our liberals are
sharply divided: One section swallows the policy of relying on.
deals with the Darlans 100 per cent in the name of military
expediency and sharply attacks anyone who criticizes this method.
of making war; another section falls into complete panic and
ﬁnds a voice in the speech of Pearl Buck last week in which she
said that this war was not a war for freedom any more and that
we would have to have another war later on to do our ﬁghting“

46

 

for freedom. What we are going to do about this war she doesn’t
say.

Both of these sections of liberal thought in America are even
more discouraging than the facts themselves. Both sections of
them—those who want to swallow the Darlan incident and say
it is a sweet pill, and those who want to fall into panic and give
up hope and everything——are equally bad because you can’t do
anything with either, and if you follow either you are lost
completely. ,-

Yet I must say I have more respect for Pearl Buck than I could
possibly have for a Kenneth Crawford, because Kenneth Craw-
ford is just licking the boots of the Biddles, of the “liberal” red-
baiters; whereas Pearl Buck, while she may not see any’ solution
to the problem, is at least screaming a protest against something

that is unacceptable. Screams are not very constructive but they_

do have one quality, even though it is only a negative virtue-
they are like the screeching of a nlaladjustedengine, indicating
that something needs to be remedied. The panic of Pearl Buck
and her kind of liberals has that negative value.

But what is the correct way to approach these very negative
features of the development of our war policy? The correct way
is to understand that these things do not change the character of
the war as a people’s war of national liberation. Further, these
aspects of our war policy can be changed by the intervention of
the ‘people, and these things must be changed because such

policies lead to defeat and n-ot to victory. The development of

events is inevitably going to prove this to the people. The one
thing that we have in this war which is our weapon against all
such distortions and which will correct all such distortions is
the will of the people to victory, their unity and activity. The
American people in mass do have that will to victory and they
are going to get rid of all policies which delay, postpone or
endanger that.victory.

This conﬁdence we can and must have. It is true the way is
not going to be easy and it is not going to be clear. We saw in
the elections on November 3 how the bad organization of the
war effort was being exploited by the reactionary forces in this
country, the very same forces that had helped to bring about this

bad organization", in order to prepare the ground for their ap-
peasement and negotiated peace policies. The same thing is going
on today on a much larger scale preparatory to the opening of
Congress. We see the rapid accumulation of all the elements of
a political and economic crisis in this country deliberately being
manipulated against the war effort by powerful defeatist organi-
zations and interests in the United States.

For instance Mr. Henderson’s resignation ‘from the Office of
Price Administration was a public announcement of a fact that
has been privately known for some time—that the whole struc-
ture of price control in this country has broken down. The re-
shuﬂling of the heads of the various agencies in charge of the
war economy was brought about by the fact that the war econ-
omy is getting tangled in the chaos that is contributing directly

_to the growing economic crisis in the country.

 

 

On this background, the political coalition representing the
dominant elements of the Republican Party, the Vandenberg—
Taft-Hoover clique, and the poll-tax Southern Democrats, is
sharpening up its axe to run wild against labor and the Ad-
ministration in the coming session of Congress, expecting to
unleash one of the severest periods of class struggle and ob-
structionism that this countryhas ever seen. Moreover, in the
big centers of war production, which are only partly organized
and are suffering from dislocations, a strike sentiment is grow-
ing. Clearly this is not a very promising background for entering
the year 1943 in the prosecution of the war.

What is behind the mounting wave of resentment of labor
against the conduct of the war economy? Our newspapers in
New York today carried several severe warnings, as if labor were
in some way rebelling against the war or the burdens imposed
by the war. In the past twomonths I have been out to most’ of
the main industrial centers and I have talked to the workers

_ and their leaders. I think I have a thorough picture of what is

going on in the ranks of labor in war production and I can say
that labor is totally patriotic, supporting the war and ready for
any burdens that are required by the war. But labor is fed up
with the senseless conduct of this war that is forcing unnecessary
and intolerable burdens upon the workers as well as upon the

48

 

 

general public, and labor is determined to change this state of
affairs. '

Those workers who are inclined to seek strike action as a.
solution to their problems are, of course, misled, because that
is no way to solve these problems under conditions of war.
Strikes will not help at all and Communists everywhere are re-
sisting this strike sentiment with all of the inﬂuence that they
have. But that strike sentiment may over-ride the Communist
inﬂuence and the inﬂuence of all of those «best elements of the
leadership of labor that are trying to prevent this resentment
from taking the channels of strike action. One reason why that
sentiment may over-ride us and sweep over us is because many
powerful industrialists, especially the N.A.M. crowd, are busy"
trying to provoke a strike movement.

There is unmistakable evidence that the most reactionary em-
ployers, acting from an organized center, are deliberately put-
tﬁig across such provocative policies and are dragging certain
patriotic employers along with them, making the tendency gen-

eral. Take the case of the bomber plant that Ford is putting up g A
-with government money outside of Detroit. The Government

Housing Authority tried to go in there and put up housing for
the workers employed in the Willow Run plant. They took their
surveyors out there, but Henry Ford’s private police ran the
surveyors off the land at the point of guns and the Government
Housing Authority withdrew and has done nothing about it
since. Meanwhile the workers in the Willow Run plant are
forced to live in trailers, in barns, in pigpens, in tents. And the
plant is still not producing anything for the war. Technically
it is in production. Actually nothing reaches the armed forces
fromit. And that is the institution where Charlie Lindbergh
works. But we have no investigations and nothing is done
about it. «
Consider more general manifestations of the treatment of
labor. There is a general policy in industry today to penalize
workers for increasing production. Many employers, in plants
which have cost-plus contracts with "the government, deliberately
slow the workers down on the job. On the other hand, some
employers that have ordinary contracts want their workers to

49

  

speed up production, but the moment they get the production
onto a higher level, they penalize those workers that increased
production by reducing their wages, so that if workers don’t
want their wages reduced, they have to keep production from
being speeded up. What kind of policy is this? This policy of
the employers is equivalent to sabotageof war production.

The American workers responded with great enthusiasm to
the policy of the government calling for increased production.
The workers know how to speed up production; they know how
to increase production without increasing the intensity of labor
too much, and they were ready to do it until instance after
instance proved to them that if they do itv the employers would
penalize them. And with that experience ‘many workers are stop-
ping the increase in production, but only because they ﬁnd out
it is not for the government, not for the war; it is only for the
private proﬁt of monopoly corporations which, far from helping
the war, is disorganizing the economy of the country and build-
ing up vast resources of power and proﬁt.

Consider another angle of what has been going on for the past

’ six vmonths since the issuance of the wage stabilization order.

Many employers have taken the position that they cannot adjust
any of the grievances of the workers in their plants except
through Washington. In the ﬁrst place they drag out the negotia-
tions now just as long as it is humanly possible and then ﬁnally
they conclude them with the declaration that it is impossible to
arrive at a settlement until they get the approval of Washington.

Thousands and tens of thousands of these cases are piled up in
Washington, which is completely unprepared to handle them,
and they lay over for two, three, four, ﬁve, six, seven months
with no answer, and then some good friend of the boss goes
around and says to the workers: “Well, you voted for this guy in
Washington, didn’t you? You are getting what you voted for.”
Then another good friend of the boss comes around and says to
the workers: “Don’t you wish you were back in the good old days

when you could strike?” Then the workers in one place pull a.

strike and the bosses come immediately and settle with those
workers. Yes, many bosses are putting a premium on strikes
today. These employers will settle nothing with the patriotic

50

 

 

 

workers who refuse to strike; but the workers who begin to join.
this strike sentiment and express discontent with Washington—
these /workers can go on strike for three hours and get their
grievances settled the same day, while nine months of peaceful.
negotiations failed.

All of this is an expression of a conspiracy against the war and,
is organized directly from a defeatist clique in the National
Association of Manufacturers, which involves even employers
who are against it. They are involved because they do not have
any leadership of their own and even when they know they are
doing wrong they are afraid to break with their fellow—employers;
besides, it ﬁts in so Well with all their previous training and they
have not been fully conditioned as yet to be really patriotic em--
ployers and really ﬁght for the policies of their government and
for an effective war economy. It is a very serious situation.

The Communists are holding back the working class today
from strike action, but the country had better understand that
the Communist Party is very small and against the concerted",
power of all of these forces the Communists cannot do the job
alone. Nobody can straighten out this situation until we get the
government in Washington to begin to take a sharp and clear‘
lead in the solution of these problems. Every patriotic citizen in
America who wants to win this war as quickly as possible had
better begin to give some attention to this Volcano that is rising-
in American social, economic and political life.

These are great dangers to our war effort at the present time.
We have sounded the,alarm on these- things and we have given.

suggestions of policy that will remedy this situation. We are not V

trying to intensify the class struggle; we want to help consolidate
national unity for winning the war, but we know that national
unity requires something more than the mere submission of labor‘
to intolerable conditions and practices, because we know that
these things are deliberately brought about as measures of sabo--
tage of the war.

We are now entering critical days. But I am not pessimistic; I '
think the country is going to solve these problems. But I don’t..

think they will be solved automatically; it is going to require a
struggle to bring a solution to these questions and I think that:

51

 

for this solution we will require the concerted action of all
Americans of good will, all Americans who place patriotism
first, all Americans who want to defeat Hitler and the Axis and
place that as the first consideration. All such forces must unite
and ﬁnd a way to express themselves and to place their active
support behind those policies which are known, which are before
the authorities in Washington, which are not yet adopted because
of hesitations and timidity. Labor and the people can inﬂuence
and can give courage to those men in the government who do
want to win the war, and do want the correct policies and who
will adopt the correct policies when the people make their will
known and felt. ' “

This is the picture. The task in the next period is to get that
mass support of all elements of the population, especially of or-
ganized labor, to the correct policies that can bring us through
this crisis, policies which can be adopted very quickly and which

- will bring order out of chaos in our economy and put power

behind the military effort which we are directing against the
fascist enemy.

(From a speech delivered at New York Work-
ers School gathering, December 18, 1942.)

IX. THE DE.CISIVE TURN IN
THE WAR

THE WAR has entered into a new phase. Some of the main
features of this phase were stated in the President’s message
‘to Congress, and quite’ correctly. The relation of forces has
turned against the Axis and in favor of the United Nations.
Public thinking about the problems of the war has reacted to
this new phase in a peculiar manner. First, there has been a wave

' of shallow optimism which considers the war practically over _

- except for the celebrations and therefore immediately turns to-

ward “business as usual”; second, there has arisen among liberal
and intellectual circles an opposite and equally shallow pessimism

52

which suddenly is overwhelmed with the unsolved political prob-
lems of the war, throws up its hands in despair, repudiates all
responsibility for the war, predicts a new war immediately after
this one and sits back to await the realization of its lugubrious
prophecies. My remarks today are mainly directed against both
these harmful tendencies in our country’s political thought.

Perhaps it would be well to deﬁne exactly those factors which
enable us to speak of the turn in the war unfavorable to the Axis.
What are these factors? .

First, and by far the most decisive, is the series of offensives by
the Red Army before Stalingrad, in the Don Basin, in the Cau-
casus, and in the Northwest, which began on November 20 and
roll on with rising momentum. The Nazis are losing, in dead,
and prisoners, more soldiers than the total engaged on all other
fronts. Whole armies are being annihilated. For the .ﬁrst time
Nazi oﬂicers and men are surrendering en masse. In contrast to
last winter’s offensives, which rolled back the invading armies,
this winter’s offensive is breaking through their lines, chopping
them up, annihilating them, and breaching their strategic
pOS1tl0l'lS.

Second, in North Africa the British have struck General Rom-
mel’s Army and sent it scurrying back from Egypt, through
Libya, in a wild race in which the Nazis have but one thing
to boast of, that they can run faster than the British can follow.
American forces, occupying French North Africa, prepare with
the British the destruction of the last Axis hold upon the
southern shores of the :Mediterranean, and open up Italy and the
Balkans to invasion. The long—prepared Second Front in Europe
can now be launched at any one of a dozen points of its entire
coastline, while Hitler must fortify and guard twice the area of a
year ago.

Third, the people of the occupied lands have begun to rise
and create their own “second front” against Hitler. The Partisan
armies of Yugoslavia have liberated half of their own land and
set up their own Government of National Liberation, despite the
treason of Mikhailovich. In Poland partisan armies are rising
and engaging the Nazis in ever larger actions. In France signs
multiply of an imminent rising of the people's forces. The Nazi-

53

occupied lands are seething volcanoes of hatred against the in-
vaders, with rising struggles which more and more break out on a
mass scale.

Fourth, the Axis coalition is disintegrating, with Italy begin-
ning to seek a way out of the war, with the ﬁrst signs of revolt
within Germany itself, with the few remaining neutrals, such as
Turkey, Sweden, Switzerland, moving further away from Hitler
and closer to the United Nations as they begin to see the clear
outlines of inevitable Axis defeat. -

. Fifth, the Japanese have -been halted in the Paciﬁc, and the
clear possibility has been shown that the opening of adequate
supply lines to China and a serious land and air offensive in and

.from that country can deliver a crushing blow to the Eastern

member of the Axis.

Sixth, and last, American and British war production, despite
all weaknesses and delays, now overtops the Axis and still has
tremendous potentialities of expansion, while Axis production
has already passed its peak and is declining. The marvelous re-
cuperative powers of Soviet war production, which is stronger
than a year ‘ago despite the loss of vital industrial areas, is being
shown in the present equipment. of the winter offensives, of
which only a small fraction represents help from abroad.

All these factors add up to a decisive turn of the war in favor
of the United Nations, creating the possibility of victory in
1943 over Hitler in Europe. -

What is wrong, then, with being optimistic about the status
of the war? Why do I warn against the current spirit of optimism
as shallow and harmful? -

The reason is, ﬁrst, that the favorable turn in the relation of
forces must still be realized by the maximum utilization of all
the forces on our side. It will do us no good to have the margin
of forces on our side if we fail to use them. And it is precisely
this shallow optimism, which already looks upon the war as Won,
which is now the greatest danger to our victory, for it brings
about a relaxation of the nation’s efforts, especially in the ﬁeld
of economic and political problems, it is manipulated by forces
of appeasement and greed to disrupt the national unity for the

W211‘.

54

 

 

At this moment when the war turns in our favor, it is especially

S necessary to make clear that it is still xpossible to lose the war,

that at this moment above all we must demand the-greatest
exertion, the fullest mobilization of every force at our disposal

V against the enemy. The turn of the war only makes the enemy

more desperate, more ferocious, more implacable. This enemy
has threatened that, faced with defeat, he will carry the whole
world down into ruin with him. W'c have no reason to doubt the
seriousness of this declared intention, but we have every reason
to do what we can to make it impossible. And we are not yet
doing everything.

Consider again those six factors which have turned the war
in our favor. Th-ink for a moment what would be the status of
the war if one should abstract the ﬁrst item, the Soviet offensive;
clearly, without that factor, the war would be disastrously un-
favorable to us. That is to say that the United States and Britain
have n-ot even begun as yet militarily to engage a considerable
proportion of Hitler’s forces, not to speak of defeating them.
The Yugoslav Partisan armies killed m.ore Nazis in 1942 than
did the U. S. forces, even as the Chinese Eighth Route and New
Fourth Armies killed more Japanese than we, despite our enor-
mous resources and our sixty-billion-dollar war budget. Do we
really think that we will win this war without large-scale ﬁghting?

That is a dangerous thought which we should get rid of as
quickly as possible, because it leads to mistakes and disasters.
That is the thought which delays the opening of the Second
Front in Europe, and'every day of delay increases the cost of
victory in lives and treasure. That is the thoughtwhich leads to
the slogan “victory at leisure,” to dilato-riness, to slackness, to
weakness, to defeat. Those who speak as though\the opening of
the Second Front were some sort of “favor” which we should
do for the beneﬁt of the Soviet Union when we get around to
it are not serving well our own country. The delay in opening the
Second Front has hurt us more than it has the Soviet Union, and
it has hurt the United Nations most of all.

Consider for a moment the second factor, North Africa. After
a brilliantly executed landing we seem to have bogged down
dangerously in political confusion which is seriously straining

‘ 55

    

great inﬂuence in France and other occupied countries. This and
similar dangers. ﬂourish in the atmosphere of shallow optimism,
of the thought that victory is already a “-bird in the hand.”

Examine now the third factor, the rising of the peoples of
the occupied lands. Here also we ﬁnd not only evidence of the
war’s turn in our favor,‘ but also grave dangers which we still
must learn how to avoid. Consider, for example, Yugoslavia.
General Eisenhower, our Commander in North Africa, is re-
ported as sending his congratulations to Mikhailovich, who
negotiated with the enemy while ﬁghting against the Partisan
armies which -brought us our victories there. This is even more
dangerous than the deal with Darlan, for it has not even the
color of “military expediency”; it acts as a "notiﬁcation to the
peoples of all oc-cupied lands that the United States does not
yet distinguish clearly between its friends and its enemies. Per-
haps we could “afford” such “luxuries” if the war was already
won, though I would question that very seriously; but surely it
is a deadly mistake at this moment when, to win the war, we
need the full conﬁdence and active cooperation of all the rising
people’s armies throughout Europe.

Or take the fourth factor, the disintegration of the Axis coali-
tion. That is a heavy item in our favor, but we will lose its
advantage if, at the same time, we permit the relations among
the leading powers of the United Nations to become strained.
And it is no secret that China has withdrawn her military mis-
sion from Washington out of dissatisfaction with the considera-
tion given China in our war policies; nor is it a secret that the
relations between London and Washington are less harmonious
than for some years past; and while the Soviet Union has made
no complaints, and considers her relations with Washington and
London as being improved and consolidated, yet we in America
should be disturbed that the President has found it necessary, for
the second time, to issue special orders that our lend-lease com-
mitments, now in arrears, shall be expedited, and that anti-
Soviet incitements still emanate not only from irresponsible news-
papers but also from official sources. _

In our ﬁfth favorable item, the halting of Japanese advances in

56. c

 

 

our cooperative relations with Britain, and is weakening our_

the Paciﬁc, we also can ﬁnd elements of weakness and danger.
We. have already mentioned the unsatisfactory relations with
China. There are two sides to this: not only has China reasons
to feel aggrieved, but the U. S. also has questions to raise with
China, for example, why are her best armies used not against the
Japanese but to blockade the Eighth Route and New Fourth
Armies, which conduct a continuous struggle with the Japanese?
U. S. diplomacy has spoken on this question, and at least pre-
vented a worsening of that damaging disunity within China; but
the basic problem remains unsolved. Then the question of India
remains in deadlock, to the deterioration of our relations with
all the Eastern and colonial peoples. We have not yet taken any
serious steps to rally to our side the Paciﬁc peoples subjugated
by Japan, with a basic program for theirnational liberation. In
all these weaknesses there is implicit the danger that we will not
be able, as soon as we should, to pass over to a serious offensive
against the Japanese, or that we may even suffer new setbacks.
Finally, there is our remarkable achievement in war produc-
tion. We should have remarkable production, for we have a re-

markable economy. But here also there are dangers and weak-

nesses, the most basic of which have been clearly deﬁned by
the Tolan Committee in Congress, the remedy for which is em-
bodied in the Tolan-Kilgore-Pepper Bills for an Ofﬁce of War
Mobilization which will integrate under one planned direction
the handling of production, manpower, prices and rationing, and
technological mobilization. Shortsighted management policies
which penalize workers for increased productivity are playing
havoc with labor morale, equally with the jamming of the col-
lective bargaining machinery, and the threat of anti-labor legis-
lation. The President’s Seven-Point Program against inﬂation,

presented last April, has been sabotaged by Congress on those

points requiring new legislation, the new tax structure is frankly
based on the principle of soak-the-poor, price control has broken
down, and the clear signs of an unnecessary and dangerous in-
ﬂation are appearing. There are grave dangers on our produc-
tion front, just as we are entering the period of our greatest
military effort. All shallow optimism and complacency become
most dangerous here.

57.

Yes, it has become necessary to combat and dispel the moods
of unreasoning optimism that have arisen on the -basis of-the
favorable turn of the war. That favorable turn is an unques-
tionable fact, and it should serve to fortify our conﬁdence in the
ultimate victory. But the darkest days of the war, its heaviest
burdens and most grievous losses, are still to come for us. The
most dilﬁcult times are ahead, and we must not soften up or
relax, we. must not grow dilatory or careless. On the contrary,
now above all.we must unite our nation and gather all its
forces to meet adequately the supreme test of modern ‘war. Above
all we must master the unsolved political problems of this war
of survival, of national liberation.  .

‘Now what about our pessimists, the faint-hearted liberals and
persons.of the intellectual professions, who have become fright—
ened at the diﬂiculties and dangers of this period, have fallen
into a panic and announce their despair to the world? Pearl
Buck was their most eloquent voice when, in a recent speech,
she declared that this war had ceased to be a progressive war of
the United Nations, that it had degenerated into an imperialist
scramble for loot on our side as well as that of the Axis, and

 

that we must look forward to a new war after this one. Fortu- ‘

nately, these pessimists are a distinct minority and the masses,
especially the labor movement, do not take their direction.» But
this pessimism is a menace to public morale, it feeds on very‘
real problems and difﬁculties, and it must be energetically com-
bated for it helps the camp of reaction and defeatism. The
calamity howlers can sometimes do much damage, even when
they are a small minority;

Imagine the results if the labor movement would listen to and
follow such‘ pessimists! Surely labor suffers from enormous provo-
cations, and has accumulated unsolved grievances, If lab_or should
lose conﬁdence in the United Nations, in the basic soundness of
the policies of our Commander-in-Chief, in the progressive and
liberation character of our war effort, then the strongest factor
which holds labor back from a great national strike movement
would belremoved; ‘our war production program would be dis-
organized, sharp class struggle-; would-rend the national unity,
and our country’s contribution to victory over the Axis would be

.58

 

jeopardized. Hitler’ and his Axis partners would gain a new
lease on life.

Can anyone, can even our pessimists, believe for one moment
that such a logical outcome of their pessimism when applied
in practical life would be of any beneﬁt to any peoples anywhere
in the world, or to labor in America? Clearly, it could have
nothing but disastrous results for all.

Strikes an-d strikemovements or threats do not help to solve
any problems under the conditions of this present war of sur-
vival. But strike movements cannot be controlled and liquidated

bycounsels of pessimism, -but only by constructive statesmanship ,

which channels the legitimate forces behind them into new
forms of action, ﬁnding solutions to these problems without
resort to open conﬂict. Clearly, such new methods of solution
are possible only because of the just and progressive character
of our w_ar effort, which generates a national unity that reaches
into all classes, that mobilizes the national will to enforce these
new methods.

It is not going to be easy. The recent convention of the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers, under the inspiration of
Lammot du Pont, issued a call to employers to take advantage of
war conditions to smash the labor movement, to dissolve the
New Deal legislation, and to defeat the policies of the President.
The reactionary Republicans, in coalition with the poll-tax
Southern Democrats, probably control for the moment a ma-
jority in Congress which is willing to follow the lead of the
N .A.M. Serious problems are inherent in this situation.

It is my conviction, however, that constructive solutions can
and will be found for all problems and diﬂiculties which stand
in the way of victory. The solutions must be found in the under-
standing and patriotism of the vast majority of the people,
especially the workers, roused to action and organized. V

Thepressure of the people, roused to express their will, will
dissolvethe power of the threatening reactionary coalition in
Congress against labor and the President.

The American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Indus-
trial Organizations, and the Railroad Brotherhoods can and
must move to closer unity among themselves, and with the mass

59

of working farmers and their organizations, on the program
which they already hold in common, and arbitrate lesser differ-
ences among them.’

Labor must seek closer collaboration with the patriotic sec-
tions of management, with the help of the government, for solu-
tion to the problems of production, for a broad development of
Labor-Management Production Councils, and for the peaceful
solution of disputes and grievances.

~ Labor and the people must study more profoundly the political
problems of the war, and bring an informed public opinion into
play to strengthen the arm of the President and the various
departments and organs of the government.

La-bor must be given more adequate and responsible positions
in the leadership and administration of the country’s tremendous
war effort.

-More organization and activity of the people provide the

' basic solution to all the problems of a -people's war.

The common man must step forward to claim his century.

Already the common men of the world, through their united
efforts, have turned the tide of war against the Axis. The most
difficult times are ahead. Rejecting alike all complacency and
shallow optimism and the panic of an equally shallow pessimism,
labor and the people will bring the nation to victory, to the
triumph of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations.

X. THE GHOST OF MUNICHISM
IN THE UNITED STATES

THERE is deep signiﬁcance for today in the fact that we

combine in this meeting the commemoration of Abraham

Lincoln, America's foremost contribution to the world leader-

ship of democratic liberation, and of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,
60

 

founder of the Soviet Power, which at this moment is liberating
the world from the menace of Nazism. _

In the joining of these two commemorations in one we are
expressing the understanding, now general among the Ameri-
can people, that the destinies of our two countries are inter-
twined, that close and ever closer relations of cooperation inevi-
tably arise from the deepest of common interests.

At this moment the common interests of the United States and
the Soviet Union are expressed in the goal of victory over Hit-
lerism. When the Axis is destroyed that common interest will

.lies in.the reconstruction of a world order in which peoples can

peacefully work out their own destinies.

Achievement of victory over Hitlerism is the supreme common
task today. In the name of Lincoln and Lenin we devote all
our capacities to that goal.

Great events are taking place. Hitler’,s armies on the Eastern
Front are being encircled and annihilated, one after another.
All. history contains nothing to compare with the mighty deeds

of the Red Army under the guiding genius of Stalin. They have

turned the tide of war deﬁnitely in favor of the United Nations.
They have «brought vict-ory within reach. _

We must ;be profoundly dissatisﬁed, however, with the con-
tribution which our country, the United States, has so‘ far made
to this victory. .

The conference at Casablanca gives us promise that Ameri.ra’s
might will be thrownlsoon into the scales of war. It is high time
that this were so. Laggards cannot win this war; victory does not
come “at leisure.”

At this moment when the black clouds of doom gather over
Hitler and his armies, Der Fuehrer has gained one brilliant
victory. To our shame we must confess that Herr Schickelgruber’s
single victory was won in the United States, in Washington, in
Congress. By a vote of 302 to 94, the House of Representatives
endorsed Martin Dies, the clearest and most consistent exponent
of Hitler’s policies and slogans within the United States.

If the Congress of the United States is still an important policy- .
»making body of our government, this latest endorsement of

Martin Dies must be looked upon as one of the most sinister
61

 

threats‘ to victory in the war, and to the future of our country.
For Martin Dies has declared that he hopes for the defeat of
our Ally, the Soviet Union; he has slanderously denounced
Joseph Stalin, Commander—in~Chief of the Red Armies, as the
chief enemy of our country; he has echoed all the slogans of
Hitler and promoted them; and now the majority of Congress
has renewed its declaration of conﬁdence in that same Martin
Dies and all hevstands for. '

It is small comfort to remind ourselves that Martin Dies does
not represent the vast majority of the people of our country.
It is small comfort to repeat that he does not represent the
Administration of President Roosevelt, whose correct war policies
are supported overwhelmingly by the peop-le. For this Congress
has the power, and a reactionary defeatist coalition of Hoover
Republicans and Wheeler Democrats is inﬂuencing a majority
of Congress to use this power, under our Constitution, to throw

4confu.sio‘n into the war effort, to, disrupt the national unity, to

negate the declared policies of the President, and to serve notice
on your Allies that they cannot depend upon the United States
honoring the commitments which have been made . by the
President. .

Is there anyone whotcan dismiss all this as merely the exag-
gerations of a special plead.er, because I have for years been
insisting upon the importance of friendship between our country
and the Soviet Union? Today this importance is recognized by
conservative circles of all political ideologies.

The_ New York Herald Tribune is a conservative Republican
newspaper. It has always hitherto supported Martin Dies. But
now it has called for a halt of this ‘‘play into- Hitler’s hands.”
And yesterday, enlarging upon its argument in connection with
our fumbling diplomacy in North Africa, this conservative
newspaper says: A -

“How can the oppressed Europeans believe in democracyjif V

we give them the impression that we believe so little in it our?

selves? There are but two choices before _the democracies now.

One is to cooperate with Russia in rebuilding the world——as there
is an excellent chance of doing, if we believe in the strength
62 v i

 

 

of our own principles and prove it by applying them. The other
is to get involved in intrigues with all the reactionary and anti-
democratic forces in Europe, the only result of which will be
to alienate the Kremlin. . . .”

I could spend hours in quoting from the most serious spokes»
men of all political groupings, to show the general acceptance of
the fact that the future of the world, and of our own country,
depends upon friendship, understanding and cooperation be-
tween the United States and the Soviet Union. But the majority
of Congress on Wednesday, by a vote of 302 to 94, voted no
conﬁdence in this whole line of policy by giving their conﬁdence
to Martin Dies, who is the embodiment of hostility against the
Soviet Union in the full spirit of Hitler.

Evidently, the majority of Congress does not wish, or does not
consider important, the friendship and cooperation between the
United States and the Soviet Union. Those who wish" to cement
that friendship are put on notice that they must defeat the
majority of (Congress on this question. One cannot eat one’s cake

- and have‘it, too; nor can we travel in opposite directions at the
{same time. No more can we have Martin Dies as the symbol "of

our policy, and also have friendship with the Soviet Union.
It is a contradiction in policy and interest. .

It is very interesting to examine the thought expressed by the
Herald Tribune before quoted. That conservative organ has
come to the conclusion, reluctantly we may be sure, that we of
the United States may ally ourselves with the forces of democ-
racy in Europe only on condition that we ally ourselves with the
Soviet Union; if we reject the alliance with the Soviet Union,
then inevitably we will ﬁnd ourselves plunged into intrigues
with all the reactionary and anti—democratic forces in Europe.
This means, further, that when our government’ engages in in-

tri ues with those reactionar forces, all intelli ent men" ever r--
g Y 3 l

where understand this to mean that we are thereby abandoning

our alliance with the democratic forces of Europe, especially"

with the Soviet Union. ~
There is a profound truth in this thought of the Herald
Tribune. Recognition of this truth is sweeping away one of the

63

biggest lies of all history, the lie that socialism or communism
is “undemocratic” or “anti-democratic.” The Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics is so much the foremost champion of all the
democratic forces of Europe that the United States, our country
which for a century and a half stood in the vanguard of world
democracy, can now be allied with those democratic forces in
Europe only on (:ondz'tz'rm that we are allied with the Soviet
Union. That is not my statement, that is the statement of the

New York’Herald Tribune, one of the outstanding conservative T

newspapers of the United States. This is a mere restatement of
the thoughts clearly expressed in the editorial which I quoted
verbatim. ~
Our country, in the midst of life—and-death war, has not clearly
deﬁned its policy. Our Commander-in-Chief points in one direc-
tion with the Atlantic Charter, the United Nations, and alliance
with the Soviet Union; but powerful forces in the State Depart-

-ment point in the opposite direction by its entanglements with

Vichy, with Franco, with Mannerheim, with Mikhailovich, with
Otto of Austria, with Bethlen of Hungary, while Congress em-
phatically contradicts the President by voting its conﬁdence in
Martin Dies. And the same Congress emphatically refuses to
express its conﬁdence in the President.

Our national policy is ambiguous. It points both ways. And
the conﬂict is not only within Congress and between Congress
and the Executive; it is within the Executive Department itself.
The President considers it necessary to conciliate a hostile Con-
gress; even more serious, he considers it necessary to tolerate
the same hostility within his own cabinet. _

In the State Department we have the ineffable Mr. Adolph
Berle, Jr., spinning his webs of intrigue in Europe and Latin
America. This is the person whom a prominent visiting Britisher
is reported to have sized up in these few words: “He is not only
anti-Soviet, he is also anti-British; he is not only anti-British, he
is also anti-American.”

At the head of the Department of Justice we have Mr. Biddle,
whose chief virtue is weakness of character which prevents him
from following his mischievous theories to their logical conclu-
sions. He introduced a brief in the Supreme Court on the Schneid-

64

 



 

erman case (and argued it against Mr. Wendell Willkie), which
bases itself onthe conception that the Soviet Union is essentially
hostile to the United States in particular and to democracy in
general. He issued an order for the deportation of Harry Bridges,
with a legal argument lifted bodily from Hitler’s “Anti-komin-
tern,” the illiteracy and obscurantism of which can be matched
only in Nazi Germany. He tried to imprison Senator Stanley
Nowak of Michigan on the same basis he wishes to deport Harry
Bridges, but had to drop it with a bald “admission of error.”
He shares the basic theories of Martin Dies, but is jealous of the
Texan’s prominence. ‘

Yes, our national course is ambiguous. The President has
charted a clear and correct policy, but it is challenged not only
by Congress but also by members of his own Cabinet and execu-
tive appointees. Instead of a‘ showdown and clariﬁcation, the
nation drifts along with compromise and appeasement of irrec-
oncilable policies. I

In the North African political muddle, that followed a bril-
liantly executed military occupation, we experienced our first
sharp example of the disastrous results of an ambiguous policy.
It requires the personal intervention of Roosevelt, ﬂying 6,000
miles to Casablanca, to begin to bring some order and sense into
that mess. The release at last of twenty-seven French Communist
Deputies," and some 900 other prisoners, di-d much to clear the
moral atmosphere. But even on this question of the North
African prisoners, it seems we have not heard the last word. Some
25,000 French patriots, Spanish Republicans and other anti-
fascists are still held behind barbed wire, and Mr. Hull has still
not clariﬁed his cry-p-ticphints that Francisco Franco may wish
to be consulted as to their fate“

In the question of the North African prisoners we are learn-
ing the ﬁrst lessons on the political problems of Europe. By the
way in which we handle this question the United States will be
judged by the peoples of occupied Europe. Uncle Sam is pre-
paring t-0 enter Europe heavily armed and ready to shoot o-n
sight; the peoples of. Europe are anxious to know if Uncle

I Sam’s eyes are keen enough to distinguish clearly between friends

and enemies! In the shadow of the Stars and Stripes in North
65

Africa 25,000 anti-fascist ﬁghters still languish in’ prisons and
concentration camps!

We cannot leave such questions to be settled at leisure. The
war goes on, and time waits_ for no man or nation. If our national
policy in its application remains ambiguous, then the results
it will bring to our nation will also be ambiguous.

There is a loud-mouthed cult in our country which is willing
to admit every weakness and error so long as it can blame it
on the President. These are the demagogues of reaction. But
there are too many honest democrats, progressives, and even
labor men, who weaken the President’s position by leaving all
problems for him to settle, by failing to take energetic action
themselves to help solve all these problems. This was the main
factor which enabled the President’s foes to gain strength in last
November’s elections, for the President’s supporters sadly ne-
glected that campaign with the excuse that “F. D. R. can take
care of it.” Now they chide the President for conciliating his
enemies, but they‘ are themselves among the ‘ﬁrst conciliators.
No one has any right to criticize the President who is not him-
self in the midst of the hottest and most uncompromising ﬁght
to hal-t the mob of reaction now controlling the majority of
Congress and threatening the whole country and its war effort.

The President has himself given more than a hint of the
course all democratic Americans should follow. Speaking at a
recent press conference, the President quoted from an interview
given by General Giraud from North Africa. Giraud had de-
clared his intention, following the example of de Gaulle, of
uniting all Frenchmen from conservatives to Communists, with
the only condition that -they unite to ﬁght Hitler and not to
play politics. The President expressedthe opinion that would
seem to be a good line for any country to follow. He evidently
meant that would be a good line for the United States also.

I wish to support emphatically this proposal of the President,
on behalf of the Communist Party of the United States. We have
thousands of Communists and‘ friends of our party in the armed
forces of the United States, ready and anxious to ﬁght Hitler
and not to play politics. But too many of them are being trans-
ferred out of ﬁghting units, and into non-combatant duties at

66

 

«::.o=-:.*."z»>rv‘-'

home, and even into polite substitutes for concentration camps.
We have raised this question with -the authorities, but have not
been able to obtain clariﬁcation of the problem. Until the Com-
munists are permitted to ﬁght Hitler and his accomplices on
the same basis as all other Americans, we must continue to dis-
cuss thisproblem publicly, and press for action in the spirit of
the President's expression on French unity.

Some well-meaning persons advise me not to keep raising the
question of discrimination against the Communists, but to simply
keep our mouths shut, to grin and bear it in the interest of the
war and national unity; after all, they say, the Communists are
only as small group in a big nation_.

My intelligence compels me to reject such an easy way out of
the problem. If the Communists of the U. S. are but a small
group in a big nation, that is all the more reason to insist that
correct principles be applied by the nation in relation to the
Communists. If the United States is so fearful of its own small
proportion of Communists that it must have special laws against
them, special committees of Congress to hunt them out of gov-
ernmental service, and special segregation of them into labor
service in the armed forces—then it will certainly be impossible
for such a fearful United States to have a realistic relationship
of alliance with the Communists of Europe and Asia who are
much more powerful, and without whom it is impossible for
.the United States to have an alliance with the democratic forces
of the world. When we ﬁght for the ‘full admission of American
Communists as citizens of the country without discrimination,
we are ﬁghting for a correct world policy which is necessary for
victory in the war.

American democracy needs more conﬁdence in itself in order
to win the war. It needs to snap out of the hypnosis induced by
Hitler and Martin Dies, in which the cry of “Communist” raises
hysterical fear and sets the democrats to examining one another
for hidden “reds” and protesting each his ‘own innocence of the
.“terrible” charge of which few know the meaning. American
democracy must grow up, and stop believing in ghosts and

witches.

-Above all, Americanfdemocracy must throw off the fear of

I. THE KEY TO VICTORY

E ARE participating in a globe-encircling war. .Its outcome

will decide the fate of ymankind for many generations. ‘

Hitlerism, Nazism gathering to itselfall the dark forces of the
world, bids for world domination. It has overrun country after
country. Only in the Soviet Union has it met serious military
reverses and been thrown back on its heels. But the Axis monster
still seriously bids for triumph. It is not yet beaten. It openly
proclaims its intention to subjugate the United States.

Already the vanguard of Axis military invasion has landed
on our Paciﬁc islands, while Atlantic Coast invasion begins with
the eight spies and diversionists caught red-handed after landing
with explosives from submarines. The United States is in the
most deadly danger of its 166 years of independence. It is war,
deadly war, a war of life and death for all nations. It has been
truly described as a war of survival.

If Hitlerism is victorious, then mankind is thrown back into
the darkness of pre-history, human progressof tens of centuries
is wiped out. Our children and grandchildren, with their fellows

_over the world, will suffer a slavery worse than anything the

primitive world had known. For Hitler is the ape-man, armed
with the most modern military science, claiming to rule the
world. _

For us in the United States, as for the peoples of the whole
world, this war has become a People's War of National Libera-
tion. Our very existence is at stake. That is why the obligatory
slogan is: “Everything to win the war! Everything for victory
over the Axis!”

The masses of the people are prepared to take up their tasks
in this war. It is unfortunately true, however, that our country
is not fully organized for the supreme test, that serious obstacles
are showing themselves. I do not speak tonight of the short-

5

victory. Yes, there is b-eing deliberately cultivated in our country
the fear of victory over the Axis because that victory is being
advanced today primarily by the armies of the Soviet Union.
That fear is stupid and senseless, in the ﬁrst place, because
America still has the opportunity despite all past delays of strik-
ing decisive blows against Hitler and winning an honorable
position in the victory by the side of the Soviet Union. We need
fear only our own failure to strike in time with our full force.
Such a failure, truly, would endanger victory, would have tera
rible consequences for our national safety and the common cause
of the United Nations.

That fear of victory came before a Congressional Committee
last week in Washington, in the person of Herbert Hoover. That
spector from an almost forgotten past mumbled a new slogan for
America: “Let’s not do too mu-ch, too soon.”

Hoover wants to drag out the war for two, three, four or more
years,‘with America doing little ﬁghting. Above all, we must not
strike in 1943, he intimated. He sees the good side of the war
in the opportunity it gives for him and his cronies to try to trans-
form it into chieﬂy a form of martial law against the American
working class, with unlimited proﬁts for the capitalists. Hoover
is still clutching close to his heart the banner of Chamberlain
and Munich.

But the last shreds of the ghost of Munich were scattered to
the four winds during the past weeks, by the events at ‘Stalin.-
grad, Schlusselburg, the -Caucasus, Kursk, and all the long list of
smashing victories of the Red Army. Any attempt to resurrect the
shameful policy of Munich can result in nothing but disaster for
those who try it. That old world which produced Munichism is
dead beyond recall. All those who try to follow that path now
will find that it leads immediately to the grave. _ '

We are in war, a war to the death. We are ﬁghting to save. the
world from reversion to ‘barbarism. We are ﬁghting to save
civilization from destruction by Nazism. We are ﬁghting for
the possibility of future progress for humanity. We are ﬁghting a
just war. .

All that means that we must ﬁght with all our might, not in
some tomorrow but now. We must ﬁght with a full heart, for

68

 

the destruction of the enemy, his complete annihilation, the
wiping of Hitlerism forever from the face of the earth. We must
ﬁght with complete good faith toward our Allies, and with full
conﬁdence in them. We must strengthen the Anglo-Soviet-Ameri-
can alliance in the ﬁres of war so that it will be an indestructible
instrument'for an ordered peace. We must forge the United
Nations as the guarantee of liberty and independence for all

' nations.

All this must still be won.

It can be won only by ﬁghting. I

Thanks to the Red Army the war has turned in our favor.
Let America also strike now, for victory in 1943.

atre, Baltimore, February 2, 1943.)

XI. THE KEY.Pl{‘OBL_EM IN
AMERICAN POLITICS

~ ENTLEMEN, Friends, I am always glad to talk to serious
thinking people. Due to great pressure of work, I came here

without speciﬁc preparation for what I want to say to you today. .

Therefore, it will be a rather informal and perhaps somewhat
disorganized presentation. .

The thought which I want to present is the importance of
clarifying certain relationships within our domestic political life
in America, if our country is to play its proper role in the
reorganization of the world, as the result of victory in this war.

_ I believe that it is possible for the United States to make a very

great contribution to the welfare of the world and, of course, to
our ‘own future. But I think that there are obstacles in the way
of this which are not yet generally recognized and to which I
want to call attention. '

To come as directly as possible to the central point, let me
refer to the Congressional Committee headed by Martin Dies,
which has just received a new mandate -from Congress and which
clearly is intended to continue its work in this next crucial

69

  
 

period with the same spirit in which it has worked for the past
four years. This Dies Committee is not yet understood in its full
signiﬁcance by the country. And when a Communist speaks
against the Dies Committee, this is usually interpreted as sort of
a self-defense measure on the part of the Communist because
Dies advertises himself as the Communist-baiter par excellence.
But it is in no spirit of defense of any special interests of the
Communists that I want to speak. I want to call your attention
to the Dies Committee in its functions as a menace to our nation
as a whole, as a poisoner of the political and intellectual life
of our country, as an agent for propagation of the basic ideas
of Hitlerism, and as a menace to the future world order.

Is it really a peculiar interest of Communists to combat an
institution which speaks in the name of our government, which
propagates the idea and creates the psychosis in the country that
puts every decent man on the defensive, if he is accused by any
loud-mouthed demagogue of being a Communist or of associat-
ing with them? That is the situation we have in our country,
which is supported, endorsed and put forward by the majority
in the House of Representatives.

Let's see what that means in relation to the international
problems of the United States today. American armed forces are
preparing to enter Europe, to liberate the nations occupied by
the Nazis. In each and every one of these nations we will have
to establish relations with the population we are liberating, and
in each and everyone of those nations -the democratic forces
of the people are organizing themselves in conscious collabora-
tion with, and inclusion of, the Communists of those countries.
If, in America, Communism is outlawed and made an object of
suspicion, discrimination, organized attacks by Congressional
committees, witch hunts, and so on, how can this country, which
has thus demonstrated .a fear of a small group of Communists in
the United States, have the proper relations with the peoples in
Europe where they will be dea ing with strong Communist ele-
ments in those populations? Or, are we going to have one policy
for our domestic life in the United States and a different policy
for Europe with relation to Communists? »

To make the question a little more concrete, what are we

70

 

 

going to do in relationcto France? Our armies may be in France‘

within a few weeks. The French people are organizing theirgown
armed struggle against the Germans today within France, on the
basis of an all-inclusive national front of the organized collabora-
tion of everyone ready to ﬁght Hit1er—from extreme conserva-
tives to Communists. The Communists are deﬁnitely included‘ in
the organized leadership of the movement. Not that they have
any monopoly of the leadership. They are included. General
de Gaulle has just included in his Council a French Communist
Deputy, Fernand Grenier, as the oﬂicial representative of the
French Communists. It is generally agreed by conservative ob-
servers that the French Communist Party today is the strongest
political organization within France, in the sense of an operating
organization with mass support. ‘

Now, how can the United States of America have a correct
attitude toward that national front of the French people that
includes the Communists if we have an organized Congressional
institution backed up by laws and public attitude which outlaws
Communism? It is clear we cannot. We will either have a correct
attitude in France (which contradicts our own attitude at home),
or (if we are consistent with our attitude at home), we will sup-
press with our arms the liberation movement of the French
people, or force it to expel" from its midst the organized French
Communists, which means to disrupt the whole French democ-
racy.

Clearly, that is impossible, because even General Giraud has

_ now endorsed thevpolicy of de Gaulle in the inclusion of the

Communists in the national front; and when such conservative
representatives of France join hands with the Communists it is
clear that the only logical answer to the situation in France is
either to deal with the Communists as a recognized party of
the community there, or to substitute pure and simple military
occupation of France -by American troops when we go in, and
dominate that country's affairs.

We have the same problem presented to us in Yugoslavia. .1
think that with France and Yugoslavia we can take it as estab-
lished that this is typical of all Europe; it is not a peculiar
national situation in any one country.

71

In Yugoslavia, we have a national liberation movement
of all former political parties, arising from within the oc-
cupied country without any ' help from outside, which has
brought together all of the active forces of the popula-
tion, including the Communists. They have established their
own armies that successfully ﬁght the Nazi invaders. They have
reconquered about half of the territory of Yugoslavia. They have
set up their own Constituent Assembly to head and direct the
armies and the civil government that they set up in the recon-
quered territories. The head of their national government is the
same man, Ivan Ribar, who was the head‘ of the Constituent
Assembly in 1918 that established Yugoslavia as an independent
nation. They openly include the Communists in the government
and in the leadership of the army, and, ostensibly because of
that fact, General Mikhailovich has made war against this peo-
p1e’s liberation government inside of Yugoslavia, and has col-
laborated for that purpose with the Germans and the Italians.
But our government and the British Government still continue
to hold Mikhailovich as their representative inside of Yugoslavia.

Here is another example of how this anti-Communist phobia
or psychosis in the United States predetermines our govemment’s
attitude toward vital questions of European policy and actually
places our government in collaboration with our national ene-
mies, in opposition to our friends.

I don’t know that I need to present to you any evidence of the
all—in-clusive popular character of that Yugoslavian government,
set up directly by the people themselves. The newspapers have
been telling you that this is a Communist affair, inspired and
instigated by Moscow as an expression of “Red imperialism.” I
assure you that this is not true and cite you evidence, not of
Communists, but of well-known non-Communists and anti-Com-
munists, including all responsible Americans of Yugoslavian ori-
gin, such as Louis Adamic and other men of that type, who are
agreed on the basic facts of the situation as I have described
them to you, and who support the ‘Constituent Assembly govern-

ment and its armies within Yugoslavia.

There are many people who dismiss these questions as prob-

lems which are in that ﬁeld of foreign relations which should

72

 

...,. .m.,.. Am; ...,n-  ~

be determined by “experts” in the government; and they say,
“How do you expect us’ to have an intelligent attitude on such
problems of the inner life of other countries? In so far as it has
to be handled by America, it must be done through the ‘experts’
that are put in charge by our government.”

I think this has already gone far beyond the stage where it
can be left to “experts.” In the ﬁrst place, unfortunately, most
of the “experts” on such questions are men who are the propa-
gators of this extreme anti4Comm‘unist phobia which obviously
makes impossible any objective, judicial handling of these all-
important problems in Europe.

We have reached the stage today, in the evolution or exercise
of our foreign policy, when the whole country must be awakened
to the fact that we face the possibilities of serious catastrophes

in Europe ifthis kind of unintelligent attitude continues to

prevail in determining the policies of our government. On many
occasions our President has given a clear lead for a correct policy.
But it is impossible for him in his position to conduct the whole
struggle for this policy. The citizenry generally—the rank and

ﬁ1e——must t_ake up the struggle for the correct policy that has

been enunciated.

Today, Congress has set itself squarely against the far—sighted
policy that the Chief Executive represents. Congress, unless the
country speaks up on this question, has the power to sabotage,
to distort, and to defeat the policy of the President. The key to
the correction of this whole situation must come from within
the population of the United States, from those men who assume
to help direct and mold the moral and political thinking of the
country. It is impossible thoroughly to correct our relations
toward the democracies in Europe without simultaneously cor-
recting our democratic life within our own country. And, as a
national question, it is necessary to include the clariﬁcation of
the position of Communists within the United States, no matter
l‘.-OW small a group they may be, as the precondition for our
having a correct foreign policy for the war and for the reorgani-
zation of the world after the war.

VVithout any qualiﬁcation whatever I declare that it is ‘ogically
illconceivable that we shall have a normal, peaceful world order

.73

     
 

unless we have a correct attitude toward the Communists of
every"country, including our own. It is impossible to reconstruct
Europe without the conscious, organized, friendly collaboration
of the Communists—not merely the Communists of the Soviet
Union‘ but the Communists of every country. And it is" impos-
sible to have that collaboration on a healthy basis if our own
; , political life inside the United States is based upon an irrational,
] l‘; even hysterical fear of the few Communists in the United States
‘ " who are constantly misrepresented and thoroughly misunder-
stood. ‘

The United States has the fewest Communists of any modern
country in the world in proportion to its population. it has the
highest developed hysterical fear of those Communists. We have
that because there has been an organized development of that
phobia. It has rooted itself in the heart of our government. It
_is officially represented by Martin Dies and his committee.

. Unless we_ can have the political and moral conscience of
 America awakened to the full signiﬁcance of this question, we
~:; cannot have any clear and accurate perspective of the proper
development of the war; and, above all, we can have no adequate
perspective of a peaceful world when this particular war is
ended. _ V

This is a political and moral question of the ﬁrst magnitude.
‘  .So long as we meet it by merely answering all of the indictments
$3  of Martin Dies by simple denials that the men whom he is ac-
cusing of being Communists are really Communists; so long as
1;  we continue that defensive attitude in which all non-Communists
S  faced with the accusation of “Communist,” say, “Were I to admit
that you were right, that I am a Communist, you would be
 entitled to do anything you want tome”; so long as we meet
} :3 it on that basis instead of arstraight headon challenge of the
‘ whole concept that Communists must be excluded from our
 democratic life; so long as there is not an understanding that
_9"f’i‘ there is no freedom for any American if these same freedoms are
$1 7:{ denied Communists, just so long is this country going to fail to
meet the tests of this war, and more especially is it not going
to be prepared to meet the tests of the peace.

I don’t speak of any aspect of this question which is peculiar

74

 

 

to the Communists. I only want to point out that in this case,
as ‘in sovmany cases in the past, it just happens that the key

problem -for theentire population of the earth is presented to .

you ﬁrst of all as this problem: What are yougoing to do about
the Communists? And, as you decide with relation to the Com-
munists, you later ﬁnd out, step by step, you .must.-decide it
similarly for everybody. Once you have given one inch to the
devil of Nazism——given one ﬁnger» to the anti-Comintern theories
and propaganda of Hitler—you have surrendered your whole
soul to him. You.may not know it at ﬁrst but before you are
through you will ﬁnd that one slight‘ concession has involved
you in difficulties from which you cannot escape. . . .

The time has come when America must begin to really cut

- itself loose from this whole ela-borate structure of anti-Com-

munist phobia, which is the principal instrument whereby the
Nazis almost came to the point of ruling the world. Now, when
the Nazi military effort is having its back broken, the time has
come when this Nazi moral and psychological “secret weapon”

_ must also be broken and purged from the life of America and of

the world.

Wranglers Club, New York, February 15, 1943.)

XII. FREE THE ANTI—FASCIST
P-RISONERS IN NORTH
AFRICA

THE question of the fate of anti-fascist ‘prisoners in North
Africa, tremendously important on its merits, becomes a
key question as to the whole course of the war because it has
become a symbol of United States policy in general. The demo-
cratic world is evaluating 'America’s choice as to its wartime role
by the standard of what we do with the anti-fascist prisoners in
the ﬁrst territories occupied by our armed forces.

When American and British troops occupied North Africa

the whole democratic world greeted the action with unrestrained
enthusiasm. On November 17 President Roosevelt issued his
statement calling for the release of the anti-fascist prisoners.
On January 11, Mr. Sumner Welles for the State Department
explained that “this government is using every effort to bring
about as prompt a release of prisoners and refugees as the mili-
tary situation will permit.”

“The military situation” was placed as the obstacle to the
release of the prisoners, two months after American troops were
in effective occupation of all French North Africa. How could
the “military situation” be injured by the release of tried and
tested anti-fascist ﬁghters? How could it be beneﬁted by the
continued imprisonment of such men? How could concentration
camps for Spanish Republicans -under the shadow of the Stars
and Stripes help us prosecute the war?

This question has been left unanswered. It is the ﬁrst and
most glaring ambiguity of the development of American war
policy on foreign soil. We told the world that sentimentally we
would like to release the prisoners, but as a matterof realism
we must recognize that it may not ﬁt in with our practical policy.
In February, following the President’s return from Casablanca,
a partial adjustment was announced between these conflicting
elements in our national policy; the release of some 900 prisoners,
including twenty-seven French Communist Deputies. This obvi-
ously had been accomplished only by the tremendous pressure
of the President’s personal visit to the scene of action.

At the same time, however, it was announced that the main
group of prisoners and internees, numbering some 25,000 per-
sons or more, had not been and would not -be released. Among
these, a most signiﬁcant group is composed of the remnants of
the Spanish Republican Army.

Why are not the Spanish anti-fascists released? When this
question was put to Secretary Hull, his reply was interpreted by
all newspaper men present as a statement that their fate was
dependent upon negotiations with Francisco Franco, fascist dic-
tator of Spain, signer of the Axis Pact. The following day Mr.
Hull said he had been misinterpreted, but offered no further
clariﬁcation.

76

 

But last week the American Ambassador to Franco Spain
praised that fascist dictator as a “wise” man and a ‘friend ofthe
United States. This throws a new and vivid light upon Mr.
Hull's cryptic statements, and requires us to re-examine a sen-
tence of Mr. Welles’ statement of January 11, in which he fore-
casts eventual “repatriation and release of prisoners and refugees
in North Africa.” If Butcher Franco is such a “wise” ruler, and
deserving of U. S. friendship and conﬁdence, then of course our
government will consider it the natural and inevitable thing that
we shall negotiate the “repatriation” of these Spaniards to their
homeland into the clutches of Franco, who has already disposed
of hundreds of thousands of such prisoners by shooting.

It is impossible to believe that the United States Government
can bring itself to complicity in such a horrible undertaking.
The enraged conscience of all progressive mankind would bring
quick and severe retribution to su-ch an act.

It remains an obvious fact, however, that the practical policy
being followed by the United States oflicials in North Africa
does not prevent such an outrageous crime -being committed,
but would facilitate that crime if not restrained by prudence
in face of an outraged public opinion.

We have no kind of guarantee inVAmerican policy for the re-
lease of the prisoners, -but must depend upon an increased vigi-
lance and awareness of the American public, and its increasing
pressure upon Washington.

We have no guarantee in American policy, because more and
more the declared policies of the President are being transformed
into their opposite in the course of application. The majority of

Congress has been organized against the President, around the

red-baiting program of Martin Dies. The Copperheads are run-
ning wild. American war policy is undermined and rendered
ambiguous.

We ‘find our nation is not only incapable of releasing the
Spanish prisoners in North Africa, despite the directive of Presi-
dent Roosevelt, but also that it is incapable of keeping in prison
the Nazi agent Viereck. We bungle both ways; our errors have
the -fatal quality of keeping the anti-fascists locked up and turn-
ing a Nazi ﬁfth columnist free.

77

   

comings in economic mobilization; with all its weaknesses, the
economic side is still the strongest phase of our war effort, thanks
to the labor-management-government joint committees and the
unleashing of labor’s initiative in production through the trade
unions. Tonight I wish to speak mainly of questions of policy,
of the mobilization of the masses behind policy, of morale, of
those factors which make it possible for a nation to throw its
full force into the scales of war to win victory.

We must never forget the armaments and materiel of war
are not enough to win. Arms are only the instruments of policy.
Without correct policy we are defenseless though we have arms
a hundred-fold. The long and mounting list of catastrophies
since Hitler took power in Germany are monuments to blunders,
and weaknesses in policy—a hundred times more than to lack of
arms. The world has been paying for its lack of guiding policy
with the lives of its youth and the freedom of its peoples.

We now hold the keys to an adequate policy for winning the
war. These keys are: The American-Soviet-British Pacts and
alliance—the bulwark of the United Nations and of world democ-
racy; the Washington and London Agreements to open the
Second Front in Europe and to extend all-out aid to China.
With the fulﬁllment of these historic agreements, we will have a
guiding policy ‘for victory.

But this policy must be fought for. The labor movement, the
entire people must and will support this policy. At this moment
this—the nation’s. policy—must be fought for in the Congressional
elections. We must have such a Congress as will strongly express
this line of policy. The present Congress does not; after voting
appropriations, it continues politics as usual, worse than the

industrialist or labor leader who continues “business as usual.“

The Congressional elections must become a vital front in the
winning of the war. We must have 21 Congress with the single

thought of turning everything to victory in the war. '
With the fall of Hitler the entire Axis will be speedilytcrushed.
Hitler can be smashed i11 1942! With 90 per cent of Hitler’s
forces tied down on the Eastern front, now is the time to strike
in the West, to open up the Second Front in Europe. That
requires that the United States carry its full share of the battle

u

I submit, in all modesty,.that this is not a very good fashion ;of
waging war. Itdoes not indicate that we have ﬁrmlyrset our feet
on*the road to victory in the war. The greatest task in the United
States is still to ﬁght for a correct and effective war policy. -

The most patriotic activity today for: Americans, therefore,
seems ‘to me to be the ﬁght for the liberation of the Spanish
prisoners in North Africa, immediate and unconditional liberae
tion. ' » V ~  — » _

That is the ﬁrst step in the ﬁght for clear and unambiguous

V war policies by our government which would automatically, as

a matter of course and without- debate, settle such questions
correctly.‘ I .

In a few weesk our American armies will be on the soil of
Europe striking against the strongholds of the main enemy.
They must be better armed politically for that task than were
t-he forces who landed in North Africa. . .

This is a necessity for victory in the war. It is a necessity for

Center, New York, March’4, .1943.)

XIII. A MENACE ,TO VICTORY

ERR HITLER and his armies are having a hard time on the

 

Eastern Front. Since Nov. 20 they have lost not only all

their 1942 gains, but also key points which they had held since
1941, not to speak of their crack armies and huge quantities of
war materiel far exceeding the amoun-t sent by Britain and Amer-
ica to the Soviet Union. This year opens, as in 1942, with the
distinct possibility for the United Nations of a military deci-
sion over Hitlerism in Europe, on condition of waging serious»
coalition warfare, that is, war on both fronts, West as well as
East. - . i »

It must be admitted, however, that Hitler is doing better
on the diplomatic than on the military front. A-t the moment

78

 

 

when his armies before Stalingrad were being cut to pieces,
he again appealed to the “gentlemen of the West” for help
against the “menace of Bolshevism”——and the generous response
he has received must have surprised even Josef Goebbels. After
the failure of Hess’ mission, I understand Goebbels had refused
to follow Jan Valtin to America, but is now reconsidering his
decision. - . V

For the House of Representatives of the United States Con-
gress, by a three-to-one vote last month, declared its conﬁdence
in Martin Dies, after «the gentleman from Texas had again re-
peated his platform of undying hostility toward the Soviet Union
and toward all Americans friendly to the Soviet Union. The
banner of Martin Dies is the “menace of Bolshevism,” exactly
the same as the banner of Hitler. Martin Dies publicly pro-
claims his hope for the defeat of the Soviet Union in this war.
The same -Congress that demonstratively voted conﬁdence in
Martin Dies just as demonstratively is expressing its lack of
conﬁdence in our war-time Commander—in-Chief. This is clearly
a major diplomatic victory for Hitler. It restores his hopes of
staying offmilitary defeat in 1943, bolsters up his wavering allies
and helps him consolidate his home front.

The Hitler—Dies victory in the U. S. Congress is no isolated
incident. It sets the key to which most American newspapers
and radio commentators have been’ singing ever since Hitler sen-t
out his latest SOS. Even the form of our debate tonight is an un-
conscious response to the "aims of Hitler’s latest diplomatic
offensive. t e i

Clearly, the war is at a crisis, a major turning point. The

\;Red Army of .the Soviet Union presented us with the possibility
of victory this year-and we suddenly learn that exceedingly in-

 

ﬂuential circles in our country are fearful of this victory even
more than they formerly were fearful of defeat.

This fear of victory is creating confusion and chaos in our war
-effort. It threatens to cancel our victory at the moment that
victory‘ comes in sight as a realistic possibility. ,

Fear of victory arises inevitably in all those circles which re-
fuse to" see the Soviet Union as a long-time friend and ally of -the
United States, and which have always considered the Anglo-

79

 

Soviet-American coalition a mere expedient of the moment, un-
fortunately necessary but to be discarded at the earliest possible
moment.

It is about time the United States -Government should make
up its mind on this matter. At present the government is of two
minds; the President advances one policy, Congress and a part
of the President’s Cabinet an opposite policy. We are in war, a
war for survival, and we cannot ﬁght this war half—heartedly
without inviting defeat. It was similar half-heartedness, arising-
from the same thought, which destroyed the French Republic.
If our own country cannot resolve this ambiguity in the national
mind, we risk the same fate. The war is not yet won by far, and
if we are afraid of victory then surely we will not grasp that
victory with strong hands, but would even fumble it if we could
imagine the impossible would happen and vi-ctory be handed
to us on a platter. '

This fear of victory is the product of a phobia, an unreasoning
fear of th€.,Soviet Union because thatcountry has organized its
internal life according to a system different from. our own. A

"phobia is a very bad guide to policy and action. When an indi-

vidual is dominated by an unreasoning fear, he loses his adjust-
ment to the world of reality step by step, until ﬁnally he is
pronounced insane and is locked up». When a nation is domi-
nated by an unreasoning fear, it loses the capacity to follow a
consistent policy, it confuses its friends with its enemies and
ﬁnally goes the way of Vichy France. .
The fear of sharing victory with the Soviet Union is an ex-
ample of a phobia, an unreasoning fear. It is the anti-Bolshevist
phobia, the fear of Communism. and the Communists. Its ab-
normal, unreasonable character is easily demonstrated. A simple
laboratory test can be made by anyone trained in scientiﬁc think-
ing, a test which will be conclusive. I suggest it for your experi-
ment. .
Find among your acquaintances the most extreme example of
this attitude of fear of the «Soviet Union, if possible a man or
woman o-f education and culture, trained in clear thinking on
most of the affairs of life. Talk with that person about the inter-
national situation until you have ‘elicited an expression of" the

current idea of fear about what “Stalin is going to do next.”
Then ask a simple question: “What do you wish that Stalin
shall do: shall he stop the Red Army at the borders of the

Soviet Union, or shall he drive on to Berlin?”

I promise you that you will get no clear answer to this ques-
tion. The person suffering from Communist-probia will not even
pay any attention to your question; he will vblandly continue to
use the two “menaces” interchangeably, ﬁrst that he will go to
Berlin, secondly that he will not go to Berlin, as examples of
“why” it is “impossible to trust Stalin.” If you press the question
he will become angry, and hint you must be something of a
Bolshevist yourself, and equally as untrustworthy as Stalin. A
reasonable question like this is an impertinence to the man who
suffers from the red-phobia. Invariably the phobia-ridden person
becomes angry when a reasonable question is put to him re-
quiring him to deﬁne his fear. Unreasonable fears cannot be
deﬁned and the phobia-ridden person ﬁghts against their deﬁni-
tion; any fear which rejects deﬁnition is an unreasonable one,

that is to say, an insane fear.

In addition to the phobia, which is a" form of insanity, there is
another fear of the Soviet Union which is a “reasonable” one,
although those who hold it also avoid revealing their reasons.
For example, all those persons who speak of the Atlantic Charter
as “globaloney,” and who wish the United States to emerge from
this war as the big «boss, controlling the airways of all the world,
dispensing the “American way of life” over the globe according
to the Lucean formula, absorbing the British Empire into a
greater American Empire, etc.—such «brazen ideologists of super-
imperialism are at best lukewarm in their friendship for the
Soviet Union, are not desirous of strengthening the collaboration
and alliance of our two countries, for, among other things, the
Soviet Union takes the Atlantic Charter seriously. One of the
ﬁrst acts of Soviet power was to liberate fully the nations and
national minorities formerly enslaved by Tsarism and to build
a multi-national state of free and independent republics.

It also granted national freedom to Finland and Poland, de- .

spite the anti-Soviet position of their ruling circles. Throughout
the years, when the Western democracies followed the path of
81

 

“non-intervention” and AMunichism, it steadfastly aided and

championed the cause of national liberation of China, Spain,
Ethiopia and of all peoples. Now, as in the past, in epic deeds
and not in platonic words, the Soviet Union takes second place
to no one in humanity’s ﬁght to destroy Nazism-fascism, to en-
sure that the peoples enslaved by Hitler’s Axis shall win their
national independence and have the right freely to determine
their own destiny and way of life. Yes‘——the Soviet Union will

surely not be “cooperative” toward those who sneer at the Char-

ter, and openly ‘talk of how they hope to rule the world after
this war. ..

As a matter of fact, it is those Americans who dream of ruling
the world in the style of Hitler who are worried about the Soviet
Union. -Clearly it is not going to be easy to conquer the’ Soviet
Union. It was a big mistake to imagine it possible to “utilize”
the Soviet Union to get rid of a rival for world rule, Hitler,
While “utilizing” Hitler to smash the Soviet Union. Those who
reasoned thus overreached themselves; they were too clever by
far. For it simply does not work out that way in life. The Soviet
Union is growing stronger in the course of winning the war, not
weaker. And with the crash of Hitlerism will go all the dreams
of world conquest wherever such illusions may be held, even if»
they are in the pretty head of a new American Congresswoman.
The plain truth is becoming evident that the Soviet Union has
at least as much chance of surviving this war as has Britain or
the United States. We can only choose whether we wish to

cultivate friendship or hostility toward the Soviet Union as a .

major world power.
The United States and the U.S.S.R. are allies in the common

. struggle to smash Hitler and Hitlerism. The President has de-

clared that “the defense of the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub-
lics against aggression is vital to the defense of the United States
of America.” Yet our government still maintains diplomatic
relations with, and aids and abets Hitler’s vassal, Finland. We
still send sup-plies to and collaborate with Hitler’s puppet,

, Franco, who has his “Blue Divisions” on the Eastern Front and a

hostile army at the rear of our gallant troops in North Africa.
We still allow our State Department to engage in anti-Soviet

intrigues with the emigre Polish government and with fascist
representatives fro'm Hungary, Rumania and Aus-tria.

This is a people’s war-of national liberation. Our government
leaders rightly proclaim that we are ﬁghting for the “Century
of the Common Man,” for the “Four Freedoms,” for the‘ “Bill
of Rights”—including the right of Americans of different creeds
and political persuasions to worship and believe as they wish as
they defend our country. But at the same moment the War De-
partment is weeding out from the combat units of our army
staunch American citizens and fearless anti-fascists———American
Communists. This is being done on the theorythat, as Commu-
nists, they are “potentially subversive.” And why are they al-
legedly “potentially subversive”? Evidently because as American
patriots they advocate and strive to promote the friendship and
collaboration of the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union in" defense of
our common interests, to win the war and to defend our national
security, peace and prosperity in the post-war period.

In reality what is dangerous for our national war effort today
and what is actually “potentially subversive” is the thinking of
-those army oﬂicials who are responsible for segregating American
Communists in the army into labor camps and non-combatant
duty. For behind this attitude toward Communists in the army
lurk the shadow of Munichism and the hopes of certain pro-
fascists to break America’s relations with the U.S.S.R., to switch
America’s role in this war, as Goebbels calls for, from an ally to
an enemy of the Soviet Union. ; ~

The defeat of Hitler opens up, inevitably, a new expansion in
the world of what Lincoln described as “government of the
people, by the people, for the people.” There will be less, not

‘ more, of rule over one people by another. We may reasonably

hope that the promise of the Atlantic Charter, of self-determina-
tion and self-government for all peoples, will be realized in life
by all nations without another long period of indeﬁnite pos-t-
ponement. We may reasonarbly have that hope, based on victory
over the Axis, because when imperialist domination over nations
and peoples‘ in its Hitlerian form is smashed, then the peoples
everywhere will demand self-government. The Atlantic Charter
gains its chief importance as an official registration of this basic
83

  
 

political fact. The Soviet Union is only an advanced expression
of the genius for self-government that is rising among most
peoples, not excepting the United States.

In such a post~war world what has the United States to fear
of a strong Soviet Union? Nothing whatever, even though one
conceives of our country being wedded to capitalism as thor-
oughly as the Soviet Union is to socialism. For the Soviet Union
is fundamentally based upon the principle of self-determination
of nations, and its inner organization prevents the rise of any
aggressive forces within it directed against the rest of the world.

Some commentators have professed to see the germs of future
conﬂict between the U. S. and the Soviet Union in the current
situation in Yugoslavia. That would be strange, indeed, regard-
less of the opinions one might hold about the inner problems
of Yugoslavia. It is not a fact that the Soviet Union is inter-
vening in Yugoslavia, but, assuming that charge were true, upon
what grounds would the U. S. object to it? The German Nazis
have invaded that country and its former government has ﬂed
abroad. Why should not the Soviet Union strike the Nazis
wherever they can be reached, and in whatever form the Soviet
Union ﬁnds convenient? Is that not what the U. S. is doing in
North Africa, and expects to do soon in Western Europe? Or do
we expect to deny to our Soviet Ally the same belligerent rights
which we most jealously reserve for ourselves, the right to strike
the enemy where and how we think it is most effective? Do we
still insist that the Soviet Union is “permitted” to ﬁght the Nazis
only within Soviet borders? Is it only the U. S. and Britain that
can search out the enemy?

But the real issue in Yugoslavia is more serious, and throws a
bad light upon ourselves, not on the Soviet Union. Within
Yugoslavia the people have been rising up and ﬁghting against

the Axis occupationists. They have rendered great services by
this to the United Nations. But they have had to ﬁght not only
the Germans and Italians, not only the Quisling Nedich govern-
ment. but also General Drazha Mikhailovich and his Chetniks
supported «by the Royal Govemment-in~Exile in London. -Mi-
khailovich has been helping to slaughter his "own countrymen,
in cooperation with the Axis, and has refused to ﬁght the Axis.

84

 

 

,.  9 ., M. V» .«...w,a~..

But London and Washington have supported, and continue to
support, Mikhailovich. Here is no longer an issue of which
persons or classes might be preferred in the government of a
country which is ﬁghting the common enemy; it is an issue
where we are supporting persons who are treasonably collaborat-
ing with the enemy.

The Yugoslavian people, in the midst of" struggle against the
Nazi invaders, have set up their own government through a
Constituent Assembly representative of all political parties of
mass following; they have installed elected officials in all areas
regained from the Nazis; they have built their army up to 300,000
soldiers; they have armed themselves with material seized from.
the invaders. They have invited the U. S. and Britain to send
ofﬁcial observers to their territories to conﬁrm their status, and
receive the proof of the treason of Mikhailovich.

If the United States continues to support the traitor Mi-
khailovich, and refuses recognition to the Yugoslavian people's
government and army, then I fear very much not only for the
post-war eriod but even more for the victory itself. This is not
afmere difference of opinion with the leaders of the Soviet Union-
This is a policy which cuts the United States off from all contact
with the broadest democratic people’s movement of the whole
of Europe. It is an extension to the whole continent, as a deliber-
ate policy, of the previously-established appeasement of Franco
in Spain,.Mannerheim in Finland, Pétain in France. .It threatens
to emerge soon in a new scheme, being hatched «behind the
scenes, for U. S. sponsorship of a restored Greater Austria under
Prince Otto of Hapsburg. '

If this kind of policy becomes established as the policy of the-
United States Government in the, prosecution of the war, then
victory is _a long way off and many disasters will intervene. Then,
too, our alliance with the Soviet Union will not become closer,
but, on the contrary, will become more and more strained. There
would arise the dire possibility that we could lose the war, even
while the Soviet Union is winning it. And, in such a case, the-
Soviet Union will be the representative of the democratic mass.
movement of Europe, and the United States will have cast its lot
with the second-hand fascists, the seedy aristocracy and the reac-

 

tionary unprincipled proﬁt-grabbers of Europe. In that case the
Soviet Union will have the sound moral position before the

peoples of the world, and the United States will have sold its V

birthright for a mess of pottage.

Thatis the only course of development which could bring a
serious clash of policy between the Soviet Union and the United
States. But that is also a course which would be a betrayal of the
United States itself. .

President Roosevelt has indicated a line of policy based
squarely on the Atlantic Charter, and the consolidation of the
Anglo—Soviet-American alliance at the head of the United Na-
tions. He is ﬁghting for this policy. But in Congress and in his
own Executive departments he faces powerful opposition from
appeasers and Copperheads. He is at times forced to retreat
before them. Therefore the United States war policy is not
secure and stable. It is ambiguous. This is the greatest danger
for our country in this war. This the great danger for the
post-war period. It is the danger of defeat through lack of

_'moral strength.

. . ,_
I am not one of those, however, who becomes pessimistic
because of the many dangers through which our country is now

a passing. The appeasers and Copperheads have strength in the

government only to the degree that they have been able to
camouﬂage their true policy and intentions before the country.
They have been successful in their camouﬂage so far only from
lack of aggressive leadership from the President’s lieutenants and
from the organizations of labor and the people. Everyone had
fallen into the bad habit of depending upon the President to do
everything. But the President is running a’ great war effort, and
has not had time and energy for the ‘domestic political struggle.
That has been the Achilles’ heel of American democracy in the

"war period. It is a weakness tht can and must be remedied.

When the larger issues are once clearly placed before the peo-
ple, there is not the slightest doubt that in their overwhelming
majority they will ﬁrmly support the policies of Roosevelt, of
the Atlantic Charter, of the United Nations, of the Anglo-Soviet-
American coalition. And that will bring us victory, with a post-

war world in which, whatever its problems, there will be no

86



debate whatever about imaginary questions, born of unreason-
able fear, such as that we are debating tonight.

(Speech delivered before the Yale Political
Union, Yale University, March 3, 194.3.)

XIV. THE CARROT AND THE
CLUB, OR THE COPPER-
HEAD CABAL

ICTQRIES over Hitler’s armies by the forces of the Soviet

Union have, since November 20, reached such proportions
as to astonish the world. In 100 days Hitler lost all ground he
gained in 1942, plus decisive strategic points, railways, and ‘much
territory held since 1941, not to speak of over a million of his
best soldiers, thousands of planes, tanks and heavy artillery, and
untold quantities of war materiel. For the United Nations vic-

tory was‘ brought within reach.

The appeaser and Copperhead newspapers of the United States
during these months of the Red Army advance have quickly
descended from heights of enthusiasm for the defense of Stalin-

grad; with Soviet victory a few more degrees of chill came over

them; until in the early part of March they burst into a veritable
orgy of recrimination and abuse against our Ally who is winning
victories for us. ‘ ‘

A It seems as though that part of reactionary Big Business which
expresses its views in the defeatist press stands in deadly fear of
victory, when it is won through the Red Army—a fear which is

more vocal, more unrestrained, than their fear of a victory for

Hitler. -

_-The Copperhead Cabal has stepped into the open to do what
it can to avoid the dread possibility that Hitler might be crushed
in 1943. Their desperate outcries are directed to ‘prevent the

' opening of the \/Vestern European Front by the British-American

forces which, by dividing Hitler’s armies between two fronts,

87

—now, not in a year or two. The old and shameful epitaph, “Too
little and too late,” must be buried and forgotten. We must
strike the enemy with all our force and on time. And this is the
time, this is the crucial year.

There is only one country as yet pulling its full weight in the
supreme test of war. Only the Soviet Union has thrown every-
thing into the scales. \Nhen General MacArthur said: “The
hopes of civilization rest on the worthy banners of the courageous
Russian Army,” he was not inviting us to stand aside and adrmire
the Soviet Union, waiting for them to win the war for us; he
was calling upon us to emulate the completeness of their effort.

When William Green, in his wholly admirable speech of June
22, declared his wholehear-ted solidarity with the Soviet people,
he was.speaking not for the American Federation alone but for
all labor, and above all he was speaking for the United States
to do its part now, in time. The patriotic speech of Green, and
the call of the C.I.O. Executive for cooperation of American
labor with the Anglo-Soviet Trade Union Council, must now
give rise to the unity of action of the great labor movements of
our countries which is necessary to achieve victory.

I have not the slightest doubt of the ultimate victory of the
peoples over Nazism. But I know that the price of victory in
lives and wealth will be much higher, unnecessarily high, if we
fail to achieve full national unity in the United States in a
mighty effort for victory in 1942.

As spokesman for the Communist Party‘, I declare that we
subordinate every issue to this one imperative necessity of na-
tional unity under the nation’s Commander-in-Chief to win the
war at the earliest possible moment, which means at minimum
cost.

National unity does not come automatically. It must be won.
It has many enemies, of whom the most dangerous are the
masked ones. Washington had his Tories and Benedict Arnolds
in 1776-1783, Madison had his Federalist defeatists and traitors
i11 1812; Lincoln had his Copperheads and Vallandighams—today
President Roosevelt must deal with the modern version of this
ancent evil—the ﬁfth column, which to its predecessors is as the
airplane to the ox-cart.

7

  

will quickly bring the Nazi “New Order” down in ruins and
defeat. -

Before I analyze this sortie of the Copperheads, permit me to
state for the record that I predict their failure. The logic of
events, the great offensive of the Red Army, the rising movements
in the Axis-occupied countries, and the growing sentiment‘ of
the masses of the people in the United States and Britain for
invading Europe without delay, bring the opening of the Second
Front nearer. Any other course is suicidal for the democratic
governments of the West.

Our American Copperheads are, however, obsessed by a sui-
cidal mania akin to that which dominated the “2oo families”
ruling France. Interestingly enough, they found their frankest
voice during these crucial days within the official family of our
President, in the person of William C. Bullitt, formerly Ambas-
sador to the Soviet Union and France, and now Special Assistant
to the Secretary of the Navy, the man who will be remembered
in history as an accomplice of Munich and as the negotiator of

‘the surrender of Paris to the Nazis without a light.

Mr. Bullitt lifted the diplomatic veil to give us a hint of the
real discussions going on in Washington behind the scenes. Let
us examine his words as reported by the United Press March 12:

“When a foreign government will not move in the direction
in which we want it to move then there is only one way to make
it move——the old way of getting a donkey to move by holding a
carrot in front of its nose and club behind his tail, and inti-
mating politely to him that he can have either one he wants. And
the carrot has to be a real carrot and the club has to be a real
club. . . . But the day that Germany collapses we shall still have
on our hands a war with ]apan—a hard war which may be long
—and the Soviet Union will be at peace and we shall want Soviet
support against japan. Under those circumstances. . . the real
carrot and the real club will be in the hands of Stalin.”

Does this pretty little parable require any interpretation? It is
clear enough, but anyway let us put it in plain English. Mr.
Bullitt wants “a foreign government" (the Soviet Union) to do‘
something it has not agreed to do. That “something” is not

88

 

 

I disclosed, but is hinted at. The “carrot” held before the Soviet

“donkey” can obviously be nothing else but the Second Front in
Europe; the “club" with equal obviousness can only be the with-
holding of the Second Front, plus perhaps the cutting down or

off of lend—lease.supplies. Mr. Bullitt sees in the collapse of Hit?

lersa terrible danger to the United S.tates—the loss of “the
carrot and the club.” Mr. Bullitt proposes that the United
States shall refuse to ﬁght the war against Hitler any further,
despite its pledge of the “Declaration of the United Nations”
and the June 1 1,. 1942, agreement on the “opening of the second
front in 1942,” and the repeated declarations of President Roose-
velt for the offensive——unless and until the Soviet Union promises
to do something they have not yet promised to do. In short,
Mr. Bullitt demands “renegotiation” of the Anglo-Soviet-Amerb
can coalition upon a new and undisclosed basis. -The short term
for such “renegotiation” is renege, and the name for persons who
make such proposals is renegade. _

Mr. Henry A. Wallace, our Vi_ce-President, has another word
for it. He calls it double_-cross, and warns that out of such
double-dealing can emerge alTh'ird VVorld War. But even Mr.

V Wallace, despite his obvious good faith and sincere alarm "about"

the intrigues going on around him, showed in his speech at the
Ohio Wesleyan University, March 8, that he also is weakening
under the pressure of the Copperhead Cabal; gone was the in-
spiring thesis of his May 8, 1942, speech on the “Century of the
Common Man,” with its tracing of the “people’s revolution”
across the centuries, and‘ in its place a muddled philosophical
jargon of abstractions unrelated to history and the experience of
mankind. ’ ' A

Our American Ambassador in Moscow, Admiral Standley, is a_

close“ friend of_ "Mr. Bullitt (and also of Hamilton Fish). In
the light_ of ‘Mr. Bullitt’s thesis of “the carrot and the club,” we
can‘ better understand “the bluff Admiral,” his sensational
charges made in the newspapers that the Soviet Government
“hides” American help from the people, and that ‘he doesn’t
know what the Russians are talking about when they speakvof
a Second Front. ’
Mr.’ V/Velles for the State Department declared that the" Am-

.89

bassador had spoken without consultation. From Moscow the
Admiral conﬁrmed that he had expressed his personal opinion,
not his government's policy.

Unquestionably, the Soviet Government will draw its own con-
clusions from all this. Of one thing, however, we may be sure
from past experience. The Soviet leaders never allow themselves
to be provoked; they‘ have had their experience with Bullitt be-
fore this, and “have his number.” They know that Bullitt has
done lots of damage, but he has never called the turn of history;
he always bets on the wrong horse. The Soviet Government will
forgive us for the antics of our Bullitts and Standleys, the mo-
ment we make good on our pledged program of the Second Front
and real coalition war to break Hi-tler’s back this year.

There are, of course, the most serious dangers inherent in this
light-minded playing with the fate of the world. We cannot
laugh off the Bullitts and the Standleys, when such a substantial
organ of ruling class opinion as the New York Times vacilla-tes
from week to week, plumping for the “carrot and club’’ thesis

and then demanding the immediate opening of the Second

Front, as it is torn between prejudice and patriotism, between
greed and good faith.

Mr. Neville Chamberlain in his day had a slightly different
version of “the carrot and club” thesis. Mr. Bullitt’s type of

 

wisdom, borrowed from Chamberlain, will suffer even quicker -

bankruptcy and oblivion. He made the fatal mistake of reveal-
ing his face to the American people. And Americans have never
knowingly followed a double-crosser and renegade in a critical
moment of national history. They will reject Mr. Bullitt with
his carrot and his club today.

We can trust our Soviet ally, because it has sealed its pledges
with the blood of millions. It is now our turn to win Soviet
conﬁdence in the United States by demonstrating equal good
faith. ‘

The Anglo-Soviet-American coalition is based upon the pledge
of a common war with all human and material resources against
Hitlerism. -

The Soviet Union is conducting that war with all resources.

The United States and Britain still engage not more than

90

 

eleven divisions of Nazi troops in North Africa, while Hitler
continues to shift -troops and equipment from the West to the
Soviet front. (Since the start of the Soviet winter offensive
alone, Hitler has transferred over thirty divisions from France
and other Western points to the Eastern front.) '

The supreme interests of victory, the honor of our country,
as well as its vital interests, demand the immediate opening of
the Second Front.

A double-cross of the Soviet Union is at the same time treason
to the United States.

Now, as never before, it is imperative for labor and the people
to organize the most active support for the declared program
of our Commander-in-Chief to strike soon and hard against the
Nazis in Wes-tern Europe!

The Second Front must be opened now!

(The Communist, April, 1943.)

XV. THE EHRLICH-ALTER
CONSPIRACY IN THE
UNITED STATES

WISH to speak about the Ehrlich-Alter case in the United.

States.
 This case originates in a conspiratorial effort of American citi-
zens, organized on American soil, to overthrow the government
of the Soviet Union, an Ally of the United States, at a moment
when our own government has declared the defense of the Soviet.
Union is vital to the national interests of the United States.
The Government of the United States had pledged itself to the
Soviet Union, in the agreement of December, 1933, that it would
prevent the operation from United States soil of any organization
directed toward the overthrow of the government of the Soviet
Union. But the U. S. Government has closed its eyes to this

91

conspiracy, has tolerated its continued operations, and now per-
mits a mass campaign in this country in defense of the conspira-
torial agents who were apprehended and executed in the Soviet
Union. ‘

We do not know the evidence upon which a Soviet court con-
demned Ehrlich and Alter. But we have enough evidence of the
conspiracy in the United States, of which Ehrlich and Alter were
agents, to ‘conﬁrm the ﬁndings of the Soviet court.

If Ehrlich and Alter were true to the teachings and decisions
of those men in the United States who are their sponsors, then
we know that they were as guilty as Benedict Arnold. And
their American sponsors testify publicly that their agents were
true to them. J y

A chief leader of the anti-Soviet conspiracy in the United States
is a certain Mr. N. Chanin. This gentleman operates as a leader
of the so-called “Jewish Labor Committee.” For years he has
collected money in this country to be used for secret conspirator-
ial work inside the Soviet Union. What was the nature of that

- secret work? Mr. Chanin has himself described it, writing in the

magazine Friend, issue of January, 1942:

“The last shot. was not yet ﬁred. It will still be ﬁred. And the
last shot will be ﬁred from free America—and from that shot the
Stalin regime, too, will be shot to pieces.”

Mr. Chanin was expressing the political line of the Social-
Democratic Federation of" the United States. This line was pub-
licly expressed in a detailed thesis, published under date of July
1, 1941, in a pamphlet entitled War Aims, Peace Terms, and the
World After the War, by the Rand School Press. ,It is signed by
leading members of the Social-Democratic organizations of
emigré Germans, Austrians and Russians, as well as by the Ameri-
cans, all long associated with every effort to overthrow the So-
viet Government. The central thought of this declaration is

the destruction of the Soviet Union. _It calls for the destruction -

of the Soviet Government in the course of the war; in case that
government “should survive the war,” it demands preparations
for removing this “source of danger” by the “armed force” of
Britain and America: it links the Soviet Union with Nazi Ger’-

many as equally “totalitarian regimes”; it declares for a new

League of Nations to which Russia shall be admitted “once she
has been freed from totalitarian rule.”

This group of American conspirators, with their allies from the
emigration, appointed as their representatives in the Soviet
Union Messrs. Ehrlich and Alter, a.nd heavily ﬁnanced them
through the channels of the Polish government-in-exile which
are most extremely anti-Soviet and anti-Semitic. These agents,
Ehrlich and Alter, were informed that “the Stalin regime, too,
will be shot to pieces,” and that the “last shot will be ﬁred from
free America.” -

Evidently Ehrlich and Alter took the teachings and decisions
of their paymasters in New York at their face value, and tried
to put them’ into action.

But everyone who goes into the Soviet Unionfor the purpose
of destroying the Soviet Government is in grave danger of being
himself destroyed. That is what ‘happened to Ehrlich and Alter,

- in company with a few million Nazis and their Rumanian, Finn-
ish, Hungarian, Italian and Spanish vassals. t

The Government of the United States has declared that Amer-
ica’s national interests also lie in preserving the Soviet Govern-
ment from all the current attempts to destroy it. Our country
is devoting a few billion dollars in lend-lease materials to carry
out that declaration, we signed the Pact of the United Nations,
we pledged to open the Second Front.

But Mr. Chanin, together with Mr. Dubinsky, Mr. Abe Cahan,
and others of Russian origin who think they should rule the So-
viet peoples from afar, from New York, raise a great howl about
the loss of their two agents inside the Soviet Union. They or-
ganize “protest meetings,’f denounce the Soviet Government in
the most unmeasured and slanderous terms, and even inveigle a
few misguided governmental ﬁgures to lend their names to this
outrageous campaign’.

It would be well to recall that these same gentlemen put up a
protest even more unconditional in defense of Mr. Leon Trotsky.
They were the defenders of Zinoviev, Bukharin, Tukhachevsky,
and the rest of the" “ﬁfth column” in the Soviet Union, whose ex-
termination deprived Hitler of his Quislings. Now they defend

93

Ehrlich and Alter in the same terms, though without the same
energy and conﬁdence.
And how do they “defend” their two agents? Do they say that

Ehrlich and Alter in the Soviet Union were actually helping the
Red .Army win their glorious triumphs which saved world civili-

zation from destruction? They do not dare make such a claim, .

for it would ﬂy in the face of all their own declarations.

Do they claim thatthe Soviet Union is not intelligent enough
to know its friends from its enemies, and that it executed the
wrong men? They do not dare make such a claim, for they them-
selves are not friends but enemies of the Soviet Union.

What they really say, boiled down to its essence, is to claim
for their agents ,in the Soviet Union the status of “extra—terri-
torial rights” accorded to Ambassadors, together with the right,
not accorded to any one, even Ambassadors, of organizing to
overthrow the Government of the Soviet Union in the midst of
life-and—death war.

Senator Mead loaned his name to the Chanin-Dubinsky—Cahan
conspiracy in connection with a public meeting last Friday.
Mayor La Guardia did the same. Several labor leaders also al—'
lowed themselves to be smeared with the mud of this political
underworld. Of course, none of these men knows Ehrlich and
Alter as anything but names. None of them has been told that
Ehrlich and Alter were working in the Soviet Union to prepare
“the last shot”—to come from America—by.which the “Stalin
regime” was t.o be “shot to pieces.” None of them speaks for
the American trade unions in expressing hostility to the Soviet
Union. .

It is not my role to speak here in defense of the Soviet Union.
Our great Ally needs no defense from me. I speak in defense of
my own coun-try, the United States, which is more endangered
by this miserable conspiracy hatched on its soil than is the Soviet
Un_ion. For it is a conspiracy against the United Na-tions, against
victory itself. .

Let me ask Senator Mead, Mayor’ La Guardia, and those re-
sponsible labor leaders who fell into the anti-Soviet net of "con-
spiracy, to turn, for__ inspiration rather to Thomas Jefferson. If
they have no personal knowledge of Ehrlich and Alter, and they

94

have not, they could at least have maintained the position Jeffer-
son took when he faced the conspiracy of Aaron Burr, the traitor
who had even more respectable friends than Ehrlich and Alter.
Jefferson told us how to handle such conspirators in the follow-
ing immortal words:

“I did wish to see these people get what they deserved; and
under the maxim of the law itself, that inter arma silent leges,
that in an encampment expecting daily attack from a powerful
enemy, self-preservation is paramount to all law. I expected that
instead of invoking the forms of Law to cover traitors, all good
citizens would have concurred in securing them, Should we have
ever gained our Revolution, if we had bound our hands by
manacles of the law, not only in the beginning, but in any part
of the revolutionary conflict?” (Writings, Vol. XII, p. 183.)

In the case of Ehrlich and Alter, there is no reason todeplore

their execution, except upon the part of those who share their ‘

aim to destroy the Soviet Union and its socialist system.

The whole democratic world has reason to rejoice that the
socialist state has always had the courage to strike hard and ac-
curately and ruthlessly at its counter-revolutionary conspirators.

But there is reason to deplore the rise of anti-Soviet agitation
in the United States. This agitation comes at a moment when
the whole war is at a turning point. The Nazi armies are being
whittled down, pushed back, and prepared for the ﬁnal blow of
destruction, by the amazing heroism and ﬁghting capacity of the
Red Army and the genius of its leadership headed by Stalin.
Herr Goebbels made his frantic appeal to the “gentlemen of the
VVest” who understand “the menace of Bolshevism." The New

[York Times and William C. Bullitt have launched their cam-

paign for the “carrot and club” method of dealing with the So-
viet Union, and openly threaten to carry America to the side
of Hitler. The hullabaloo about Ehrlich and Alter is a part of
this response of the appeasers and defeatists to delay the Second
Front and to prepare the ground for negotiations with Hitler.
It is a part of the preparations for what Vice—President Wallace
warned against as a “double—cross” of the Soviet Union.

The people and Government of the United States, however,

95

have learnedthe lesson that the Soviet Union is not our enemy,
as the anti-Soviet agitators try to make it appear, but on the con-
trary the great country of socialism is our natural ally, and all
the stronger our ally because it is a socialist country. _

The people of the United States do not want any “protests"
to our great Soviet Ally, but they want expressions of deep
friendship and appreciation for the immeasurable beneﬁts the
Soviet Union has conferred upon us by cracking the Nazi armies,
and saving the world from Hitler domination.

The people of the United States want to have nothing to do
with anyone who conspires to overthrow the Soviet Government;
on the contrary it wants a long-term treaty» of alliance and friend-
ship between the Soviet Government and our own, it wants a real
coalition war. " ' S . '

For this, however, it is necessary to clean out the Ehrlich-Alter
conspiracy from American soil. For this conspiracy is directed
toward breaking the Anglo-_So'viet-Aimerican coalition.

The future of our country, and of the world, is at stake.

Brooklyn, N. Y., April 1, 1943.).
