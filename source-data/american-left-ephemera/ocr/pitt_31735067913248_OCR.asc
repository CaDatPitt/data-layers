House and Senate Act
On Variety of Measures

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Several pieces of major legislation have
been acted upon by the U. S. Senate and House of Representatives
during the past month. In addition to mine safety, action has been
taken in the fields of unemployment compensation, highway and
auto safety, and uniform packaging and labeling of products. Addi-
tionally, late in the month, a House committee cleared another

far-reaching bill on civil rights.

By a 374-10 vote, the House passed and sent to the Senate a
bill (HR 15119) to revise the federal-state unemployment compen-
sation system. In its present form, the measure would provide

coverage for an additional 3.5
million workers and institute a

new program of extended bene-

fits for the unemployed during
national or state recessions.
‘These revisions fell far short of
the objectives of organized
labor.

The original administration
bill (HR 8282) called for mini-
mum federal standards for state
unemployment programs. The
version passed by the House,
however, leaves such standards
up to the individual states. A
major effort to restore the orig-
inal provisions of the bill is ex-
pected when the measure comes
before the Senate.

On June 24, the Senate passed
bills on both highway safety
(S 3052) and auto safety (S 3005),
the latter by a 76-0 vote.

The Highway Act of_ 1966 au-
thorizes a three-year, $465 bil-
lion program to help states and
communities reduce traffic ac-
cidents and to provide for fed-
eral highway -safety research.
The auto safety bill authorizes
the Secretary of Commerce to
set interim motor vehicle safety-
standards by Jan.-1, 1967, to be
effective in 180 days to-one year
after publication. ~ Federal safety
standards would be prescribed
by Jan. 1, 1968, and each two
years thereafter. "

The measure also provides for
construction of a testing facility
and a national driver registra-
tion service for information on
individuals with suspended or
revoked licenses.

"Trul'h-in-Packaging"

The Senate, on June 9, passed ,

an administration-backed “truth-
in-packaging” bill (S 985), de-
signed to prevent deceptive
packaging and labeling prac-
tices. Federal packaging and
labeling standards would be set
by the Secretary of Health, Edu-
cation and Welfare and by the
Federal Trade Commission. This
includes establishing standard
package sizes and weights, la-
beling the identity and manu-
facturer of the commodity, and
placement of this information
on the package. President John-
son called the bill “one of the"
most important pieces of legis-
lation before the Congress this
year.”

The Civil Rights Bill of 1966

(HR 14765), in amended form,
was approved by the House Ju-
diciary Committee_on June 29.
The measure would prohibit dis-
crimination in the selection of
jurors in federal, state and local
courts, and in the sale or rental
of certain houses; empower the
Attorney General to bring suit
to prevent official or private in-
timidation of any person; and
prohibit threat or injury to civil
rights workers engaged in “law-
ful” activities. I

In order to break a two-day
deadlock, the committee agreed
to amend Title IV to‘ exempt
from the bias ban sales by indi-
viduals engaging in less than
three housing transactions in
any 12-month period; sale or
rental by persons occupying one
unit of a dwelling containing no
more than three other rental
units; vacant land; and non-
profit religious, fraternal or

educational organizations.

hearings on this bill are now
being held.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Mark End of Long Era of Harassment

Two dates in June mark the end of an era, hopefully for all time, of government

. “The union is now free,”

— sdid International President A. C. Skinner, in hailing

two enormously significant events of the past month, “to devote all of our energies to

U.S. Department of
“Justice and the union, dismissed
the petition a.sking the board to
find that the union is “Com-
munist-inflitrated.”

Unanimous Decision

V Four days later, on June 20,
the US. Supreme Court unani-
, mously reversed, the convictions
of six past and present Mine-
Mill officers and employees on
a charge of “conspiracy” to de-

Nathan Witt
General Counsel

  fraud the government by the fil-
= _ ing of false non-Communist af-
fidavits.

“These victories would not
‘have been possible,” said the

‘international officers, on behalf

of the entire international ex-
ecutive board, “without the
loyal support of our local union
officers and of the rank-and-
file members of our union.” In
emphasizing the courage of the
Mine-Mill members throughout

 the long period of adversity, the
A officers, too, had -words of ap-
-preciation and praise for the

American Civil Liberties Union,
the many trade unions, and the

if " ‘many individuals “who stood by

our side through these most

i_¢_ -difficult times)’.

 The two actions in June are
vindication for the union and
sits leaders, who, from the be-

:,that the charges were false and
‘ vindictively inspired. The ac-

Tg tions spell two more defeats in’
« the government’s
' perpetuate in the country the at-

attempt to

jn'1’osphere of the McCarthy era.

L ’ “I must say with considerable
. regret," declared S u p r e m e

Court Justice Hugo Black con- "

cerning the ‘conspiracy’ case,
"that future historians report-
.ing this case may justifiably
draw an inference that it is the
petitioners ‘(the union defend-
;-ants) and not the government
who have been defrauded.”

SACB Case

 ’.'TheiSACB case, too, was one
;’of,_-the most extraordinary in
{American labor history. Begun
.1u‘_July of 1955 and involving
extensive hearings before the
Subversive _ Activities Control
l_3o__ard,_ the cases’ was returned

,.peals* in Washington to the

the: ‘evidence, was _‘?stale." The

_ government that there

board had found against the
union in May of 1962, but Mine-
Mill appealed to the federal
court.

The case was extraordinary
not only because of its unusual-
ly protracted nature, but also

-because of the character of the

evidence, all of which came
either from disgruntled ex-em-
ployees or officers of the union
or from paid, professional in-
formers. The evidence was all
truly stale (“rancid” is un-
doubtedly a better word), with

the bulk of it relating to the

1940’s_ _and " some going. back

__'even to the 1930's. , . - V
Additionally, policies of the
‘ union which today “are univer-

sallly pursued by the American
labor movement-—as, for exam-
ple, its support for civil rights
for Negroes and Mexican-Amer-
icans—were branded in the
case as “Communistic” and as
“evidence” that the union was
“Communist-infiltrated.”

The joint motion to have the
case dismissed and the action
by the SACB last month amount
to an acknowledgement by the
is no
evidence against the union or

"its leadership which can stand

up in court.

ality of the non-Communist affi-
davit provision in the Taft-Hart

ley Act, upon which the entire‘
~ case was based.

were filed in 1956 against 14 4

Victory Near on Mine Safety Legislation  
As Senate Overwhelmingly Passes

5 7 to 18 Roll-Call Vote
Takes Place on June 23

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Senate passage, by a  to
18 vote on June 23, of a safety bill covering the nation’s
metal and nonemetallic mineral mines and mills makes
victory in Mine-Mill’s 15-year effort to achieve federal
safety legislation for the industry virtually certain. The
bill, which is supported by President Johnson, now moves
to conference committee, where differences will be ironed
out between the Senate version and that passed by voice
vote in the House of Representatives last September.

In hailing last month’s action, Mine-Mill President
A. C. Skinner said, “Federal action comes as a result of
the continued failure by the states to meet their responsi-
bilities in protecting the health and the very lives of the

workers in our industry.”

Sen. Wayne Morse (D-Ore.) led the fight for the bill
on the Senate floor, in the absence of Senator Gaylord

Nelson (D~Wisc.), who had
chaired L abor Subcommittee
hearings on the proposal this
spring. Sen. Lee Metcalf (D-
Mont.) also played a major role
in the lengthy floor debate.
Two weakening amendments
were defeated on narrow votes.

State-Option Defeated

By a 40 to 41 count, the Senate
turned back a-n amendment by
-Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.),
which would have provided for
optional state administration
and enforcement of the safety
code to be established. The body
instead went along with lan-
guage similar to that in the
Federal Coal Mine Safety Act
providing for federal-state co-
operation in inspection where
desired by the states. .

The Senate Labor and Public
Welfare Committee, chaired by
Lister Hill (D-Ala.), had recom-
mended the latter language and
had substituted it for the state-
option feature of the House-
passed bill. No state-option pro-
vision was included in the orig-
inal proposal of the Johnson
administration. on mine safety,

-which grew out of a lengthy In-
terior Depart~ment~ study, of_

health and safety conditions in

the industry from 1961-to 1963..

Jilso defeated, by .a margin
of35'0o 42, was an amendment

by Sen. Paul Fannin. (R-Ariz.) ‘

to exclude sand and gravel pits
from the bill's coverage.

A unified labor legislative
committee, which for many
months had been lobbying for
the mine safety bill, strongly
opposed both amendments.

Conference Committee

The conference committee
which will resolve differences
between the House and Senate
versions is not expected to meet
until after July 11, when Con-
gressmen return to Washington
following their holiday break.
The Senate version of H.R. 8989,
primarily because of the ab-
sence of the state-option fea-
ture, is the stronger of the two.

Serving on the committee,
from the House side, will be
Adam Clayton Powell (D-N.Y.),
chairman of the Education and
Labor Committee; James G.
0’Hara (D-Mic-.h.), who carried
the bill in the House; Elmer J.
Holland (D-Pa.), one of the
bill’s strongest supporters; Dem-
ocrats Sam M. Gibbons of Flor-
ida, William D. Hathaway of
Maine, and William D. Ford of
Michigan; and Republicans Al-
bert Quie of Minnesota, William
H. Ayres of Ohio,.and John Ash-
brook of Ohio. _,

Democrats M o r s e, Jennings
Randolph of West Virginia,
Ralph Yarborough of Texas,
and either Nelson or Joseph
Clark of Pennsylvania are ex-
pected to be the Senate con-
ferees, along with J avits, Fan-

nin, and Winston Prouty of Ver- -

mont from the GOP.
Supported by President

V Whatever compromise is
agreed to in‘ conference then
goes back, to both houses of

5,.

Congress for approval prior to
going to the President, who ac-
tually signs the measure into
law. President Johnson is on
record as favoring the bill, hav-
ing predicted passage when he
appeared at an International
Labor Press Association confer-
ence at the White House late in
May.

The bill, said the President,

“will protect our men mining

copper and uranium, or working
in sand and gravel quarries-
practically everyone who labors
under the earth to earn his live-
lihood.”

A majority of both parties in
the Senate joined in supporting
the bill on final passage. The
measure was backed by 41 Dem-
ocrats and 16 Republicans.
Seven Democrats and I1 Repub-
licans voted against the bill.

, numbers of labor and manage-

which could reasonably be ex-
pected to cause death or serious
physical harm” shall be manda-
tory-—violation of which could
result in the closing of the prop-
erty by the Secretary of the In-
terior.

If such a “mandatory” stand-
ard is violated but death or se-
rious harm is not imminent, the
Secretary will set a time limit
during which the violation must
be corrected. If it is still not
corrected, the Secretary will
order the closing of the property.

Major administrative respon-
sibility, under terms of the bill,
rests with the U. S. Bureau of
Mines, which is authorized to
make any inspections and in-
vestigations it feels necessary.

President's Column

VIBTOB-Y! . . . and Thanks!

HIS IS a column that took almost 17 years to write. In a period

of 10 days last month, decisions were made in Congress, the
Justice Department, and the United States Supreme Court that rep-
resented 17 years of effort and struggle by Mine-Mill. These deci-
sions were: ‘

(1) On June 23, the U. S. Senate passed by a vote of 58 to 17
a federal mine safety law. Our union’s efforts for this legislation
began in Congress in 1949 and continued for the past 17 years.

(2) On June 20, in a remarkable 9 to 0 decision, the U. S.
Supreme Court reversed the conviction of six Mine-Mill leaders in
the “conspiracy” case. The original indictment handed down 10
years ago, in 1956, was against 14 union leaders.

(3) On June 13, a decision was made by the Subversive Activi-
ties Control Board to drop the discredited SACB case against the
union, which was started 11 years ago in 1955. Last November the
Federal Court of Appeals had returned the case to the SACB on
the grounds that the evidence. was “stale.” Early in June, the
union’s attorneys and the Justice Department joined. in a petition
to the SACB to dismiss the case.

’ ‘Ir ‘A’ 19:

LL THREE of these important decisions are victories justify-

ing the many years of sweat, effort and expense contributed
by thousands of good union men. These decisions represent impor-
tant victories for the entire labor move-
ment. To document the history of struggle
by Mine-Mill to win these three victories
would take several volumes. Suffice it to
say that the history of these false political
charges began with our expulsion from
the C10 in 1949, and continued through
the entire period of McCarthy-McCarran
hysteria of the 1950’s and into the early
1960’s.

It included, in additionto the “conspir-
acy” case and the SACB case, the Travis
case, the Jencks case, and an effort by the
NLRB to bar Mine-Mill from certification
in union elections. From the very begin-
ning, these wholesale efforts to destroy _
Mine-Mill were the real “conspiracy.” And no small part of this
effort was contributed by the mining companies, as thousands of
Mine-Mill members know very well.

Our members also know that for 17 years our effort} seeking
much needed federal mine safety legislation were opposed every
step of the way by the American Mining Congress and the major
mining companies.

it * ‘k

UT WHEN you fight the good fight, you win respect and you
win allies. That’s what's been happening in the past seven or
eight years. In our petition to the U. S. Supreme Court, we were
joined by the American Civil Liberties Union, United Auto Workers,
Amalgamated Clothing. Workers, Amalgamated Meat Cutters,
American Federation of Teachers, International Typographical
Union, National Farmers Union, Transport Workers Union, and
United Packinghouse Workers.

A united front among several unions began to form over two
years ago to push for mine safety legislation in the House of Rep-
resentatives. It was successful a year ago. This past year, this
unity of trade unions continued in a joint effort to seek passage of
the legislation in the Senate. Joined by many administration lead-
ers in the Senate, this effort was successful.

The unions working together in this Washington effort were
the Steelworkers, Teamsters, Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers,
International Chemical Workers, Op-erating Engineers, IBEW, and
the United Mine Workers.

UR THANKS to all of these unions and their leaders, whose
effort, support, and many contributions were essential to the

 

Skinner

' winning of the “conspiracy” case and passage of a mine safety

law. In addition to these unions were many others, including hun-
dreds of local unions, and the International Longslioremen’s Union
and the United Electrical Workers Union (both indep-endent), whose
generous financial and moral support continued from the very
beginning of the “conspiracy” case 10 years ago.

Our thanks to thousands of Mine-Mill members, local leaders,
and ‘local unions in both the United States and Canada, who con-
tributed regularly and substantially to the Defense Fund, who
argued in our behalf when the going was toughest, who testified
on the witness stand and defended this union and its leaders for a

"dozen years. Without this fundamental trust and support within

oui-‘union, we could not have won. And to the defendants in the

1 “conspiracy” case who stuck through ten years of difficulty,

harassment, and personal sacrifice.

Our thanks to the officers, board members, and staff through-
out the union,.who stuck with the defendants and regularly contrib-
uted substantial amounts of each paycheck to the Defense Fund,

Our thanks to our General Counsel Nathan Witt, whose wisdom
and dedication to the legal problems of Mine-Mill (including hun-
dreds of. NLRB and arbitration cases) for almost 25‘years has con-
tributed so much to the success of this union’s struggle; and to
Telford Taylor, who argued ,our case before the Supreme Court;
to George Francis, our Denver attorney, and to Joe Forer, Wash-
ington attorney,’-who made a substantial contribution tothe dis-
missal of the SACB case.

Our thanks also mustgo to David Jenkins, a member ofthe

. ILWU in San Francisco, who, as secretary of the Defense Com-

niittee, assigned by_the ILWU to assist us, took manymonths from
his job and his family to cover every section of the American trade
union movement to organize active union support for our case and

financial contributions to our Defense Fund. Dave’s efforts were

a‘ major contribution to our victory.

End of Harassment Seen In ’ 
Most Recent Legal Victories

period that affidavits were re-
quired, never signed any.

Like other labor unions, Mine-
Mill had protested the passage
of Taft-Hartley and its affidavit
requirement. For two years, the
union officials refused to coiii-
ply with the requirement, of
which President Truman had
been particularly critical when
he vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act.

Then, however, many unions-
among them Mine-Mill—which
had refused to comply with the
law realized that they would
have to sign the affidavits or
lose the services of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board,
which obviously were crucial to
the operation of a labor organi-
zation. The decision was made
at an international convention
of the union.

During the trials, Mine-Mill
attempted to present evidence
from the NLRB on the date of
its compliance with the affi-
davit section as compared with
other major labor unions, but
this was not permitted by the
court. The prosecution, mean-
while, argued simply that the
union changed its position on
compliance because the Com-
inunist party had changed its
position.

The convictions on the first
trial were thrown out because

of prejudicial hearsay that had
been admitted as “evidence.”

Third Trial Unlikely

Although the Supreme Court's
action on June 20 raise-s the
possibility of a third trial in the
case, it is extremely unlikely
that this will develop, according
to Witt, the Mine-Mill general
counsel. This is because the
decision gives the defense ac-
cess to grand jury minutes to
show discrepancies in the 
former testimony against the
defendants, thus making convic-
tion most unlikely.

Additionally, the testimony of
one of the witnesses, William
Mason, a former employee of
the union, who died in an auto
accident between the first and
second trials, is no longer avail-
able to the prosecution. -

Long History
of Vindicafions

The recent actions are two
more in a long string of court
vindications of Mine-Mill and its
personnel.

In 1953, then International
Representative Clinton Jencks
was charged with filing a false
non-Communist affidavit, but
his conviction was overturned
by the U.S. Supreme Court in
1957. Travis, prosecuted twice
on the same charge, was

cleared both times—once by the
Federal Court of Appeals in

July. 1966  1

Denver, once by the Supreme
Court.

Mine-Mill as bargaining agent"
for employees at Precision Sci-
entific in Chicago, but the Court
of Appeals in Washington the
following year unanimously
ordered the NLRB to return
the union to full compliance
status-—a decision later upheld

» by the Supreme Court. _ 

Hailed in much of the labor 
press around the country, the . ‘
recent actions also prompted-~ :

THE DENVER POST °

Time to Drop Mine-Mill Case

  

In 1954, the NLRB held hear-A j;
ings on its move to decertify ‘ 

 

‘back to the Justice Department Monday

in the department’s 10-year-old struggle
to obtain valid convictions of a group of offi-
cars and members of the International Union
of Mine," Mill and Smelter _Wor_kers.

The court threw out a -second conviction of
the defendants in the Federal District Court in
Denver on the ground that the defense had not
been allowed to examine grand jury minutes
that might have been relevant to the issues in
the trial.

The defendants-.-14 in number when the
prosecution started 10 years ago but now re-
,duced to six through various court actions --

were accused ofconspiring to defraud the fed-
eral government by filing false non-Communist
affidavits under the Taft-Hartley Act.

They can be tried again, but, under the cir-
cumstance, it ' would neither be» sensible nor
just to start this ancient andfcomplicatedcase
on another round through the courts. We be-
lieve the Justice Departmentwould be war-
ranted in dropping the case at this time.

THE. Supreme Court delivered another set-

The acts of conspiracy the government says

the - defendants engaged in began nearly 17

"years "ago, according to the charge. The non-" ’

Communist affidavit provision of the Taft-

-Hartley Act involved in the case was repealed

by the Congress in 1959 before the defendants
were brought to trial.

A Supreme Court decision last summer sug-
gests that. when the provision was still in the
act it was probably unconstitutional. In addi-
tion, the provision which Congress enacted to
replace it was held to be unconstitutional.

To CONTINUE a prosecution now for acts
allegedly committed 17 years ago, under a
provision that has been off’ the statute books
for nearly seven years and that was probably
"unconstitutional when it was on the statute
books simply doesn’t make any sense.

It would be far better to relieve the union
of the. continuing burden of this case and hold
it accountable for its deeds in the present and
the future rather than in the past.

‘The evidence in recent years suggests that
the Mine Mill union has been concentrating on
the task of improving wages and working con-
ditions for its members. ,

As long as it does that -task honestly and

_ ppenly, there is nothing to be gained by keep-,
ing alive an old prosecution that was spawned ‘

in the era of mccarthyism. I m

ofpolitical harassment of this union and its leaders. Even though
Brother Clark was never charged, nor was he a defendant, his
support of all defendants in the “conspiracy” case, his testimony
in our behalf and his generous personal contributions to the De-
fense Fund were a comfort and strength to every one of us. We
thank you, Jack.

HE ENTIRE union looks forward to the day, which we hope
will come very soon, when the Justice Department will dismiss
and close the “conspiracy” case. In light of the Supreme Court’s
decision, it is still legally possiblefor them to initiate a third trial.

This possibility exists, but it seems fantastic to contemplate. We

believe the Justice Department will close the case, and thus end

this long period ‘of legal harassment of our union.

JACKSON, Miss.—The “Mere-

which ended at the state capitol
building here on June 26, was
des:ribed as a success by lVline-
Mill Vice-President Asbury
Howartl, who participated dur-

an estimated 4,000 Negroes were
registere-'1. along the 260-mile
route, he said, “It clearly ac-

The unity and determination of Mine-Mill workers throughout
the industry were the big factors in the notable success achieved
at the bagaining table in 1964. Near unanimous strike votes were
approved at property after property, and strikes, when they did

occur, were solid.

The National Wage Policy Conference, held in Tucson,_Ariz.
in January of 1964, and attended by rank-and-filers and local un-
ion leaders from throughout the country, developed a set of real-
istic goals. The National Wage Policy Committee, elected at that
conference, kept tabs on developments in negotiations throughout
the summer and developed strategy to end the bargaining stall of

the companies.

The experience of 1964 shows that a solid set of demands, de-
veloped well in advance. of actual negotiations, can be won, as
Mine-Mill will have the chance to once again prove next year.

march had begun to pitch their
tents there, when police waded
in with tear gas to drive them
off——kicking and beating many
marchers in the process.

Over 3,000 persons, outraged

by the brutality, attended a
rally at the same spot on the

following evening. The marchers t

then moved to Tougaloo College,
where officials had given them
permission to spend a night.

James Meredith started the
march on June 5 in Memphis,
Tenn., in order to “gain respect
for the Negro from Mississippi’s
election officials.” He was shot
in the back by a white segre-
gationist the following day,
shortly after entering Missis-
sippi.

After the shooting, the march
was resumed by SCLC, CORE,
SNCC, the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party, the Delta
Ministry, the Medical Commit-
tee for Human Rights, and the
Deacons of Defense and Justice.

To many, the appearance of
the Deacons in the Mississippi
marching column marked a
frightening shift from the non-
violent tactics preached for so
many years by the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. Others, however,

including Howard, maintain that '

the Deacons, who were armed
and equipped with radio cars,
helped to prevent further vio-
lence from occurring.

The organization, in any event,
is growing in many Southern
cities, as -the civil rights move-

ment, with atrocities to Negroes. _

continuing to’ occur, seriously
debates the wisdom of striking
back when attacked.

Concludes With Rally

Meredith was back when the
22-day march ended with 2.
Jackson rally, attended by up-
wards of 20,000 people. He ad-
dressed the crowd, along with
the Rev. Dr. King, Floyd Mc-
Kissick of CORE, Stokley Car-
michael of the Student Non-Vio-
le 11 t Coordinating Committee,
and Whitney Young of the Na-
tional Urban League. The latter
organization, Young announced,
will be setting up a chapter in
Jackson.

The U. S. Labor Department
also stated that it would lend
aid in solving the problem of
finding jobs for Negroes in this
part of the Deep South.

The total Negro vote in Mis-.

sissipi now stands at about 137,-
000—some 35,000 of whichhave
been registered since the pas-
sage of the Voting Rights Act
of last year.

Just as the Selma to Mont-
gomery march of 1965 helped to
ensure passage of that bill, the
Mississippi “March against
Fear" undoubtedly served to
further the chances for Con-
gressional passage of new civil
rights legislation, which, among
other provisions, would prohibit
threats and injury to civil rights
workers. The House Judic.iary
Committee cleared a version of
such a bill on June 29.

The betrayal by the state gov-
ernment of the marchers, to
whom it had promised protec-
tion, helps to ensure such fed-
eral action.

 

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Three Morebeaths in Butte;

Hoist Disaster

 

 Averted

BUTTE, Mont.—Although a mine hoist disaster that could easily have taken 28
lives was narrowly averted at the Anaconda Company’s mines here last month, three
men were killed in separate accidents, bringing the toll of fatalities in the Company’s
mines in Butte to a total of 10 since Sept. 16, 1965.

This is a higher death total at Butte than in any calendar yea.rs since 1958, when

11 miners were killed.

Don Hendrickson, 48, chief engineer for the underground mining division of

Eimco Corporation, a Salt Lake City mining equipme

June 7 in a fall-of-ground acci-
dent while inspecting some
equipment being installed at the
4800-foot level of the Mountain
Con mine. He died 10 days later
in a hospital in Missoula, Mont.,
where he had been under inten-
sive care.

Clifford N. Galle, 48, was
killed June 21 in the tire depart-
ment of the Berkeley open pit.
Galle, a member of the Team-
sters Union, was pulling off an
outside tire of a dual wheel unit
of a 100-ton truck to get to the
inside tire, which was flat. A
lock ring broke loose, resulting
in a blowout of the outside tire,
which threw Galle about 20 feet.

Deputy Coroner Frank Johns
said death apparently resulted
from head and chest injuries.

Galle is survived by his. wid-
ow, his mother, a son and six

. « daughters.

1 A week later, on June 28, Fred
P. Bates, Jr., 19, waskilled at
the 2400-foot level of the High
Ore mine. He had just finished
lunch and was sitting on some
lagging when caps ofsquare set
timber broke at both ends.
About two cars of fine material

 followed by a large rock fell on
— Bates.

Deputy Coroner Johns
said Bates was suffocated.

The son of Fred Bates of
Butte, he was a graduate of
Butte High School and a schol-
arship holder at Montana Tech,
where he had completed two
years. Bates was working at the
High Ore mine for the summer.

He had been nominated for the .

U. S. Naval Academy at Annap-
olis, Md. by Congressman Arn-
old Olsen.

A disaster was narrowly
averted June 1 when a cage
descending with 28 miners went
off the guides at the 4500-foot
level. It descended another 100

‘ feet, but luckily the bottom deck

lodged against the sheets at the

_4600-foot station and the cage

was stopped, leaving 130 feet of
slack rope hanging down. All 28
men were safely unloaded.

Paddy Lee, chairman of the
trustees of the Butte Miner’s
Union, Mine-Mill Local 1, suf-
fered a fractured ankle and
three dislocated toes as the cage
bumped to a halt.

There were, fortunately, no
other injuries.

 

Newest M-M Local C
Elects Hs Officers

ELLINGTON, Mo.——The Ozark
Miners’ and Millmen’s Union No.
944, Mine-Mill’s newest local,
elected its first officers on June
15. Walter Pfaff was na med
president, and other officers are
Richard Davis, vice-president;
William Macom, financial secre-
tary; and Alvin Umﬂeet, record-
ing secretary.

Alvie Herrien is the conductor,
and Denver Tucker will serve as
warden. Windell Conway, Orbie
Collins and Roy Umﬂeet were
elected local union trustees.
Serving as shop stewards dur-
ing the 1966 term will be Joseph
Bowen, Montie Foster, Collins,
and Max Reed.

The officers were installed by
International Representative
J. P. Mooney on June 24.

Mooney and a local union com-
mittee, which includes Pfaff,
Collins, Bowens, and Foster,
now are engaged in negotiating
the local’s first contract with the
Ozark Lead Company, a subsidi-
ary of the Kennecott Copper
Corporation.

The Missouri local was char-
tered on May 9, following Mine-.
Mill’s victory over the Steel-
workers by a 2 to 1 margin in
an NLRB election on May 2. The
lead-zinc mine, when in full pro-
duction, is expected to employ
from 200 to 250 workers.

KELLOGG, Idaho—Jack Doug-
las, 35, a contract miner at the
Ame-rican Smelting & Refining
Company’s Galena mine here,
was killed on Jtme 10 by a slab
which fell from a back wall at
the 4300-foot level. The fatality
was the third at the property
since February 3, when Donald
Jutila, 32, was killed, also by a

K slab from a hanging wall.

According to the report of the
deputy state mine inspector,
Eddie V. Adams, the ground in
the area where Douglas was
killed was under heavy pressure
and was working continuously
while the investigation was be-
ing made.

Douglas, a veteran of the
Korean War, married Noriene

In addition to his widow, he

Statement by A. G. Skinner on A
 and Main Mining Deatiis .

 

June wrote .a black page in the history of min-
ing accidents in the Northwest.

At the American Smelting and Refining Com-
pany’s Galena mine in the Coeur d’Alene district,
a miner was killed by a slab which fell from a back
wall 4300 feet underground. He was the third miner
to be killed in a little more than four months at this
mine, which employs approximately 200 men. If
this rate were to be kept up, nearly half the em-
ployees at this mine could expect to be killed over
the next ten years.

At the Anaconda Company mines in Butte,
three men were killed last month. A mine hoist dis-

aster involving 28 men trapped in a cage was nar— .

rowly averted. Ten men have been killed in Butte
in less than 10 months.

These shockingly frequent tragedies have oc-
curred as Congress has been completing its work
on a federal mine safety bill. Mine-Mill and other
unions have sought this legislation for more than
15 years.

It is legislation long overdue, and we can only

regret that the most recent victims, and the thou-
sands of miners who have lost their lives over the
last 15 years, have lacked the protection which will
be afforded when the pending mine safety bill be-
comes law. . . — ‘T i

Mine-Mill grievance and safety committeem en, “graduates” of a series of classes on the
role of the local union steward, were told at a June 19 banquet celebrating the com-

pletion of the sessions.

International Representative George Kalafatich, who directed the classes, noted
the many on-the-job tasks that lie ahead for the committeemen, as he awarded interna-

tional union cigarette lighters
to the stewards and their wives
and Mine-Mill lapel pins to tie
“graduates.”

Four members of Mine-Mill
Local 904 in Melrose and 36
members of Local 1 in Butte
attended the series of classes,
which dealt at length with such
subjects as how best to handle
grievances, carrying them to
arbitration if necessary, and
similar matters. Early retire’-
ment for miners also was dis-
cussed and material was dis-
tributed indicating what retire-
ment benefits are available to
mine-rs in other countries.

‘All of the various mines on
Butte hill we-re represented at

A cocktail hour preceded the
banquet, which was opened by
Max Salazar, financial secre-
tary of Local 1, and then turned
over to Recording Secretary
Reginald Beavis, who gave .a
few words of welcome. Local 1
President John Glase served as
master of ceremonies for the
affair.

Other speakers included Bar-
ney Rask, board member for
District 1, and Mine-Mill Gen-
eral Counsel Nathan Witt, who
discussed the “conspiracy” case
convictions of six past and pres-
"/ent union officials-—convictions
that were the following day re-

Outlook for "See-Through": Meat
Trays Cloudy

Two supermarketlchains at opposite ends of the country have

‘ lately switched from pulp cardboard to transparent plastic meat

trays, thus responding to long standing customer_complaints that

packaged meat too often, consists of much more bone and ‘fat than —

the top view reveals. The July issue of CONSUMER‘ REPORTS
finds the new tray is got all gain for the consumer-—-plastic ribs
that strengthen also dis ort the view; so do several layers of plas-
tic film wrap; so do accumulations of blood and condensed vapors.

Furthermore, in California—and perhaps in other states, the
weights and measures rules give a windfall to the meat retailer.
Any liquid absorbedinto, the container while the meat is on display
must‘-be deducted from the net weight. Since‘ a plastic _tray does
-not absorb juices, the liquid can count as meat weight-—about 7
cents on a three-pound rolled, boneless roast of beef.

Still, the staff of Consumers Union concludes that the trans-
parent plastic meat tray does at least represent a small gain in the
direction of full disclosure. The story in CONSUMER REPORTS
notes, however, that the packaging manufacturers are already
offering supermarkets another innovation—the white plastic tray

.—-you can't see through it at all!

Salmon Steaks Pronounced "Dismal"

While doing a report on canned salmon, Consumers Union also
tested three brands of frozen salmon steaks. The July issue of
CONSUMER REPORTS sums up the findings in a single word-
dismal.

Seventeen out of 18 samples purchased were so rancid that CU
couldn't conceive of any cooking method that stood a chance‘ of
disguisingthe bad ﬂavor. The report concedes that the steaks may
well have been shipped from the packer in good condition, but
their condition suggests too-long storage or poor handling during
shipping or after arrival at the retail stores. CU se.es the salmon
situation as one more illustration of the need for vigorously en-
forced regulations for handling of frozen foods. The date-stamping
of each package of a product like frozen salmon, which is known
to deteriorate slightly after a few months of storage at a tempera-
ture as low as zero degrees, would help too.

A Need Suitcase. wan Travel

If you‘re preparing for a_ trip, should you buy one of the cur-
rently popular molded suitcases, or one of the soft-sided bags
whose popularity has continued over a number of years?

The July issue of CONSUMER REPORTS carries test results on
18- models of molded luggage "and concludes that this type appears
to have several clearcut virtues: Sides.can’t snag; the cases are
relatively scuff-resistant and‘ easy to clean; they will probably stay
presentable longer than the soft-sided type in hard use; they are
likely to protect your things better.

On the other hand, soft-sided luggage probably is a little less
expensive and perhaps a little lighter than molded luggage. The
report considers molded cases particularly suited for travel by
Eommercial transport and soft-sided luggage an equally good
choice if you travel mostly by car and handle your own bags.

Advice on Pesticides

Our era has been called the age of overkill, and, says the July
issue of CONSUMER REPORTS, this kind of strategy, unhappily.
often-prevails on a backyard level.

Many a homeowner, after helplessly watching weeds or insects
invade his .lawn or garden, turns to pesticides. But only rarely can
you find. a pesticide that is poisonous only to the pest you want to
kill. All are toxic to some degree if swallowed or inhaled and

1 many are toxic on contact with the skin. Some stay toxic for a

long time after application. 4

Don’t resort to a pesticide the first time you spot a pest. Swat
the occasional Wayfaring beetle, urges Consumers Union. Where
weeds are few, take them out by hand. Consider removing a. dis-
eased plant or two to halt an infestation before it takes hold.

Identify the pest first and then choose the "least toxic pesticide
that will deal with the trouble. Your State Agricultural Extension
Service can give advice through your -county agent.

Among insecticides ‘having relatively low toxicity, are the
following: malathion, methoxychlor, carbaryl (Sevin), Kelthane
(a miticide), pyrethrins, and rotenone (the latter, deadly to fish).

There are a number of extremely poisonous insecticides that
should never be, used by a- home gardener. This group -includes
Bidrin, endrin, parathion, methyl parathion, and demeton.. While

"these products are not likely to be sold through the channels

usually used by home gardeners, you might be offered some by
a farmer or other professional. If so, don’t accept.

A number of other products which can be absorbed through the
skin in harmful quantities and therefore require the utmost pre-
caution, are readily available. These include chlordane, dieldrin,
diazinon, heptachlor, lindane, and Zectran.

Among herbicides, amitrol (a specific for poison ivy, poison
oak, and poison sumac) is considered a relatively low-toxity com-
pound; the commonly used broad-leaf weed killers. 2,4D; 2, 4, 5-T;
and silvex are slightly more toxic. Among the most toxic herbi-
cides, if swallowed or» absorbed through the skin, are chlordane,
many arsenic compounds, the dinitros (a group of contact herbi-
cides including DNAP, DNBP, and DNC), pentachlorophenol (a

commonly used wood preservative), and PMA (a post-emergent

crabgrass killer).

Read labels carefully, follow instructions exactly, and if you
spill or spray any pesticide on yourself, wash immediately with
soap and water, advises Consumers Union. Don't overdose trees
or shrubs as you spray. The plant has had enough just before the
solution starts to run. Don't spray on a windy day.

Canadian Pact .

Has Substantial
Wage Boosts

VACOUVER, B. C.—A recent
contract settlement, covering
more than 300 members, be-
tween the Shaft and Develop-
ment Workers Union, Mine-Mill"
Local 1037, and Fry Western
provides for immediately in-
creased wage rates ranging
from $2.80 to $3.25 an hour.

The starting rate will nowvi

be $2.80, with clam and cat
operators and first class me-
chanics being raised to the
$3.25 figure. The miners’ rate
is upped 35 cents per hour, to
$3 hourly. Additional increases,
effective May 1, 1967, will bring.
the above classifications. to
$3.05, $3.40, and $3.15 per hour
respectively. _

Terms of the settlement will
be extended to Hanson Lake,
Manitoba, where an application
for certification has been filed,
as well as to Merritt, Smithers,
and other centers in British Co-
lumbia.

Room and Board

Overtime rates will apply
after eight hours in one day
and 40 hours in a week. Free
room and board will be pro-
vided in isolated areas and will
be negotiated at already settled
properties. Travel allowances
will be paid and union mem-

bership is a condition for em-

ployment.

A special contract clause pro-
vides that all contracts for
miners will be negotiated before
the crews leave Vancouver, with
an automatic re-opener‘ after 30
days should these rates and ‘con-
ditions be inappropriate.

Phosphate, Fertilizer, and chemical
accuncil deactivated at Jane Parley

CHARLESTON, S. C.—-The Mine-Mill Phosphate, Fertilizer,
and Chemical Council was reactivated at a meeting here on June
11, attended by some 35 delegates from local unions in Georgia,
,, Alabama, and South Carolina. In agreeing to work toward the
standardization of the contracts at 15 Southern plants represented
by the union, the delegates set an immediate goal of moving in
the direction of a common contract expiration date this fall.

R. N. Wagner from Local 863 here was elected president of



 

,~"v:'I'HE"ELECTION COMMITTEE IN SESSION. Delegates cornpleted .a full agenda during
“the: day—long‘-meeting of the Mine-Mill Phosphate, Fertilizer, and Chemical Council last

the council and John Pritchett,
semer, Ala., was named secre-
tary.

. Executive Board Member

. Raymond Dennis and Interna-

tional Representatives M. C.
(Dick) Anderson and Jesse Dos-
ter, both of whom have done
extensive organizational work
in the area for ' the union,
stressed the benefits to be de-
rived from the coordination of
bargaining efforts.

Thoroughly discussed by the
delegates, too, was the extensive
material prepared by the Mine-
Mill Research Department on
the financial conditions of the
various companies. Many of the
companies, which had been
highly profitable as independent
operations, recently have been
absorbed by giant, multimillion-

' dollar corporations whose main

businesses are petroleum pro-
duction and marketing, glass
making, meat packing, or chem-

. icals.

Four-Year Trend

Major reason for the trend,’
that has been taking place over
the past four years, is that the
big. corporations all produce one

. or more fertilizer chemicals and

are anxious to secure direct
market outlets selling mixed
fertilizer to farmers and other
consumers. The newly acquired
plants now. are contributing to
the already bulging profits of
the parent companies.

Locals 863 and 481, members
from Local 838 in Macon, Ga.

Operations Listed

Now under Mine-Mill contract
are the following operations:

arking

 ere nniversary

 

BUTTE, Mont.—A record crowd of some 8,000 persons turned out in ideal weather on June 13
to celebrate at Columbia Gardens Butte Miners Union Day. The traditional holiday-the city’s oldest
but for the Fourth of July—marks the founding of the union here in 1878, a year before Butte be-

came a chartered city.

Once again, huge amounts of ice cream and cotton candy were provided to the children, as the
uinon celebrated its 88th anniversary, Free rides on the roller coaster, bi-planes, and merry-go-

round also were enjoyed.

A free public dance at the
pavilion wound up the day’s
festivities, which included abun-
dant picnicking as well as simply
leisurely strolling through the
park’s beautiful grounds.

Steward Again Winner

, The Steward Mine “A” team
for the second year in a row
won the annual first aid con-
test, sponsored by the Anaconda
Company, which provided a $300
cash prize to the top team and
lesser amounts to the next five
finishers. Seventeen teams com-
peted in the contest, which con-
sisted of three first aid prob-
lems, each of which, if worked
correctly, was worth 500 points.

Walter Forsty, a pipeman
and former mine committee-
man, again captained the Stew-
‘ard “A” group, which now has
taken first place in three of the
past four years.

-The Mountain Con Mine “A”
team and the Butte Miners Ma-
chine Shop squad tied for sec-
ond place, trailing the winners
by three points.

Each participant in the con-
test received $83.15 for practice
and contest time, plus a white
sports shirt and a pair of trous-
ers. ' .

Lester D. Knill, subdistrict
manager for the U. S. Bureau
of Mines from Salt Lake City,
served as chief judge for the

we competition, with D. E. Martin

and H. J. McCreary, safety rep-
resentatives, acting as arbitra-
tors.

Local 72 Member Fights
For “Matter of Principle”

EAST HELENA, Mont.--Jack Harris, recording secretary for
Mine-Mill Local 72, went to jail on June 13 “as a matter of prin-
ciple.” He received a five—day sentence to the Lewis and Clark
County jail for refusing to pay a $10 fine for an alleged violation
of the city’s animal control ordinance.

Harris’ clash with the local authorities resulted from a citation
issued by the police after East Helena Police Chief Al Rose said

he saw Harris’ dog, a Welsh ter-
rier named Irish, outside the
owner’s yard. Answering a sum-
mons to appear in police court,
Harris was found guilty and

fined, despite his argument that’

there was “no evidence” to back
up the charge.

Admitting that he really
couldn’t be sure whether or not
his dog was off his property, be-
cause he was at work at the
time, Harris chose jail rather
than paying the fine. Prosecu-
tion of leash law violations, he
explained, should require im-
pounding of the animal—not just
the word of a police officer.

“If the police can say they saw
my dog outside my yard and
fine me,” said Irish’s owner,
“then they can say they saw me
committing grand larceny and
have me convicted.”

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Union Unity Wins Medicare
Integration Plan at Arizona PD

DOUGLAS, Ariz.—On June 21, for the first time in the history of collective
bargaining with the Phelps Dodge Corporation, representatives of all unions in the
company’s Arizona operations together met with PD officials across the negotiating
table. The occasion was the discussion of the integration of medicare benefits for
employees and dependents 65 years old and over into the existing hospital plan.

The settlement agreed upon calls for the company to pay the $3 monthly fee

for doctors’ coverage under
medicare for all workers and
dependents covered, which num-
ber about .175 persons in the
Arizona operations.

Other Provisions

Additionally, PD will absorb
all deductibles under medicare
and will furnish to dependents
without cost hospitalization in
company hospitals for the whole
90-day period of medicare.
When employees or dependents
are referred .to non-company
hospitals and doctors, besides
absorbing the deductible amount
and the $10 a day co-insurance
required by medicare after the
first 60 days of hospitalization,

the company will pay the 20 per-
cent of medicare-covered
charges that otherwise would
have to be paid by the patient.

Coverage lacking under medi-
care, but existing in the union-
negotiated h o s p i t a 1 - medical-
surgical plans are continued, as
for all other employees.

The Mine-Mill Phelps Dodge
Council, which approved the set-
tlement at a June 24 meeting in
Bisbee, noted that medicare in-
tegration for the few affected
workers and dependents at the
PD plant in El Paso, Texas
would be undertaken as soon as
some pattern develops for the

David V e 1 a s q u e z, Insurance
Consultant Paul Pinsky, and In-
ternational Representative Syl-

’vain Schnaittacher, character-

ized the agreement with Phelps
Dodge as a good example of
what can be accomplished by
the unified’ efforts of the various
unions involved.

Savings ‘I-o Company

At the beginning of the year,
the c o In p a n y had aproached
Mine-Mill and some of the other
unions with an informal propos-
al for providing some additional
benefits to the older employees
and dependents. At the time, the
Mine-Mill PD Council decided
that the offer was not substan-
tial enough, in View of the big
part of the existing costs the
company was going to avoid
because of medicare.

The council also agreed to
seek the cooperation of all of the
other unions in the PD chain on
the medicare integration prob-
lem. On March 25, a counter
proposal, which had not yet
been presented to the company,
was sent to the other unions for
their comments and suggestions.

Call for Unity

A result of the call for unity
wasthat PD was unable to get
separate negotiations with any
of the unions. In early June, it
was learned that the attitude of
the unions had made PD recep-
tive to negotiations which would
involve a better offer than that
first proposed.

Informal contact between the
unions resulted in all of them
being represented at the com-
pany offices in Douglas on June
21.

The Mine-Millvnegotiators met
first with the PD officials, pre-
senting them with the counter
proposal which had been de-
termined as the general position
‘of all of the unions. A group
representing the Steelworkers,
Teamsters, Boilermakers, Oper-
ating Engineers, and other un-
ions then met with the company
representatives, supporting the
same general position.

When it became apparent to
the company that there was no
point in separate meetings, PD
agreed, later the same day, to
meet with the whole union dele-
gation. It was at this meeting
that the final agreement was
hammered out.

points: The competition was juélged by personnel from the  S. Bureau of Mines.

Escalator Clauses Again Popular

With the Consumer Price Index going higher and higher, the
escalator clause is again becoming a bargaining objective of a num-
ber of unions. Among them are all eight unions bargaining with
GE this year. Machinists now striking the major airlines want
an escalator clause reinstated; ILGWU has already gotten it back
in one recently negotiated contract, as have‘Boston transit workers.
UAW members already covered by a c0_st—of—living adjustment
clause have received 11 cents per hour as a result since the signing
of their 1964 contract. Six of the 11 cents came in 1966.

Auto Workers Conference

A conference of delegates from 14 countries, representing 1,440,-
000 organized auto workers in plants of Ford, Chrysler, GM, Fiat,
Simca and Rootes, was held in Detroit in early June.

Following its five-day session, the conference issued a state-
ment calling for protection of workers in less developed countries
against anti-unionism and unfair discharge, for increased wages
and benefits to the full extent possible within the development of
each country, for an end to excessive overtime and establishment
of adequate paid relief time, vacations, pensions, shorter work
weeks, and a variety of other improved working conditions.

Pensions for Small Company Employees

The Industrial Union Department of the AFL-CIO announces
that a pooled pension plan for employees of small companies has
been put into effect. Under the terms of the plan, the costs of pen-
sion coverage for 1,100 employees of 14 companies are pooled. This
reduces the cost to the individual company, minimizes the risk to
the insurance carrier, and thus makes possible better pensions for
the employees involved.

The reduced cost and risk makes it possible to negotiate pen-
sions for employees of companies so small that until now coverage
for their employees would have been impossible. The IUD report
notes thatcompanies so far covered range in size from 3 employees
to 261, and are under contract with locals of five different interna-
tional unions. ‘

The pool plan allows for various levels of beneﬁts, depending
on what has been negotiated, and will be expanded as necessary to
include negotiated pension agreements of other small groups of
organized employees.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

First Pact for Grape Strkers
Outlined by Chavez in Denver

DENVER, Colo.—Cesar Chavez, militant director of the striking National Farm
Workers Association in Delano, Calif., told over 400 persons attending a dinner here
on June 15 of the union’s victory against the Schenley corporation—a contract pro-
viding a $1.75 an hour minimum wage, which has been labeled a “milestone” by
Chavez and the entire American labor movement.

The one-year agreement, the “first major contract won by the NFWA, which has
been on strike against the grape growers of the San Joaquin Valley for nine months,
was signed on June 21. Covering some 500 workers, only about one-tenth of the to-

tal number on strike, the agree-
ment provides, in addition to the
immediate wage hike of some
35 cents an hour, a union shop
and a union hiring hall, thus
making the NFWA the prime
source of labor.

The pact states that the com-
pany will give the union 72
hours’ notice of the need for
workers. It is free to hire out-
siders only if the union fails to
provide the needed workers in
that period.

Settlement of fringe benefits
was left for further discussion,
with the agreement specifying
that “in cases where inequities
exist with respect to insurance,
medical, hospitalization, and va-
cations, the company and the
union will meet to eliminate
them.”

All piece work rates also will
be adjusted by the contract to
correspond with the 35-cent in-
crease.

DiGiorgio Target
The grape pickers’ strike in
Delano, whose prime target now
is the huge DiGiorgio Corpora-
tion, is seen as key to the even-
tual organization not only of the

half-million farm workers in
California, but those in other
states as well.

Vice-President Asbury How-
ard and Secretary-Treasurer
Irving Dichter were among
those from Mine-Mill attending
the dinner to honor Chavez and
the NFWA. Also present were
representatives from the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers
Union, the International Brother-
hood of Teamsters, the Pack-
inghouse Workers, the Typo-
graphical Workers, and the re-
gional office of the AFL-CIO.

‘The following day, Chavez vis-
ited the Mine-Mill international
office, along with Henry Santie-
stevan, director of information
for the Industrial Union Depart-
ment of the AFL-CIO in Wash-

‘ ington, who accompanied Chav-

ez on his speaking tour, and Joe

Herrera, chairman of the C010-

rado American G. 1. Forum.
“A man of the people, who
has foughtthe establishment,”
said Rudolph (Corky) Gonzales
of Chavez in introducing him
at the banquet. Gonzales is the
leader of the “Crusade for Jus-
tice,” a recently formed Span-
ish-American movement in Colo-

Recruitmenf oi‘ Scabs

DiGiorgio “has broken at least
10 attempts to organize,” Chavez
said, in explaining the nation-
wide boycott of the company’s
products now being organized.
The corporation has recruited
high school students from
Orange and Marin Counties in
California and imported people
from Texas to scab on the strik-
ers, he declared.

Over 200 have been arrested
during the course of the strug-
gle. Of these, the NFWA leader
said, 53 have come to trial and
all have been acquitted. No
hearing has yet been held on a
complaint sworn out against a
grower who threatened two
strikers with a shotgun.

What was first termed a
“honeymoon strike” by "growers,
who didn’t expect it to last, has
been going on since last Septem-
ber, Chavez noted. “We soon
found,” he added, “that we were
also striking against the mer-
chants, the school board, the la-
bor contractors, the power
structure, and sadly enough, the
church.”

With the organization of farm
workers now expanding in oth-
er states, Chavez said that in
some areas the merchants and
some of the politicians are sup-
porting the movement. Although
organizers are having trouble
with the Texas Rangers, he said,
Rio Grande City in Texas is one
such area.

Berruzu Praised

During his speech, Chavez dis-
cussed how “my good friend"
Maclovio Barraza, Mine-Mill’s
District 2 board member, had
arranged meetings with some 20
locals in the Southwest at which
Dolores Huerta, a NFWA vice-
president, appeared in order to
distribute information on the

‘strike and urge support for the

Schenley boycott.

During his meeting at the
Mine-Mill office, Chavez talked
by telephone to International
Representative Alfredo Montoya
in El Paso, Texas to arrange
Mine-Mill help in preventing the
recruitment of Mexican work-
ers, called “green-carders,” who
have been used in the attempt to
break the California and Texas
strikes. The international offi-
cers and Montoya pledged all
possible aid in the struggle
against the growers. .

Anaconda, Reynolds Metals, and Kaiser Aluminum and Chem-
ical Corp. have a big deal cooking in Jamaica. Talks are in prog-
ress with the island government over construction by the three
.companies of a multi-million-dollar alumina plant. Alumina, a
white granular powder, is an intermediate product made from
bauxite (aluminum ore). Alumina is smelted into aluminum. Ana-
conda thus far has been purchasing alumina, mainly from Kaiser,
and wants its own source of supply.

Shipment Problems for Zambia

The Zambia-Rhodesia dispute over shipment of Zambian copper
over the Rhodesian railroad system continues. Rhodesia insists on
payment of freight charges in dollars or _. other convertible cur-
rencies, while Zambia, backing up British economic sanctions
against Rhodesia, says it will pay only in British pounds. Britain
has frozen Rhodesian accounts in pounds.

How to ship the copper by alternative routes is the problem.
Capacity of ‘the Congo and Tanzanian railways is limited, as are
possibilities for airlifting the copper.

Zambia produces about 62,000 tons of copper a month. Tr.ade
sources say only 20,000 to 35,000 tons a month can be shipped by
routes bypassing Rhodesia in the next year or so.

Steel ‘Use for Ammunition Explored

The U. S. Army is conducting studies of how steel might be
substituted for copper in making cartridge cases. Industry sources

‘ report that about 80 percent of the copper bought by the Defense

Department goes into am-munition. _

.4-The main difficulty in switching from copper to steel would
be in rapid fire small arms ammunition. Steel cools and contracts
less quickly than brass; hence greater danger of jamming and
wear on weapons. ‘

Steel has been used by the army for slower firing artillery for
some time. Copper-short Germany did use steel for small arms
"cartridge cases in World War II, but industry sources doubt the
‘U.S. will—unless copper becomes harder to get than at present.

Temptation of Scrap's High Pric

Reports of thefts of copper have cropped up recently from all

- over the country. Thieves, indeed, have risked their lives to cut

down copper transmission lines. With some scrap dealers ready
to absorb the copper at 30 to 40 cents a pound, a ready market has
been available. Late last month, one man’s luck ran out. He
climbed a utility pole near Denver and was electrocuted as he was
cutting a live wire. ’ I -

In Chicago recently, thieves hacked a hole through the brick
wall of a warehouse, bypassing doors and windows wired to a
burglar alarm system. Once inside, they loaded 60,000 pounds of
copper sheet onto a company truck parked inside the building, then
used the truck to batter a bigger hole in the wall, anddrove off.
The truck was abandoned but the loot was gone.

Pend Oreille Needs Miners

Pend Oreille Mines is the latest non-ferrous producer in the
Pacific Northwest to complain of a shortage of hard rock miners.
It says it has been able to operate recently at only 67 percent of
capacity because of the shortage. Last fall, Sunshine Mining Com-
pany in the Coeur d’Alenes said it was considering air-conditioning
its mines to attract about 50 needed miners to its payroll.

Subsidy Offered for B.C. Smelter

Talk about a copper smelter for British Columbia is heating
up again. The British Columbia provincial government is offering

exploration in the area, dating back to the 1950’s, and now will
proceed with further evaluation of a copper and nickel deposit.

Henry S. Wingate, Inco chairman, said the company hopes it
will be able to produce about 62,000 tons of copper and nickel
combined from the property.

How Brass Companies Get Their Copper

Two prominent brass companies have recently revealed how
they manage to get copper to supply their mills. Malcolm Bald-
ridge, president of Scovill Manufacturing Company, says his com-
pany gets about half its copper requirements at or near the U.S.
producers’ price of 36 cents per pound.

Twenty-five percent of requirements comes from scrap re-
turned by customers at the U.S. producers’ price. The other 25
percent comes from copper and scrap'purchased at premium prices

——70 cents for U.S. custom smelted copper, 72 cents for imported"

custom smelted, and about 66 cents for the copper..content of scrap.

Two Active Members
or Local 679 Retire

NIXON, N. J.—Joseph Vince
and John Yanik, two longtime
active members of Mine-Mill
Local 679,, the Nixon Plastic
Workers Union, recently re-
tired, receiving severance pay
at the rate of $80 per year of
service—a benefit gained in the
three-year contract negotiated
by the union in late 1964. The
men, both of whom are eligible

to begin collecting Social Se-
_curity benefits, also will re-
—ceive monthly pension pay-

ments, $1,500 paid up life in-
surance policies, and their four
pro-rated vacation
checks.

Vince, a charter member of "

the local union, received $3,360
in severance pay. Now 65, he
spent 42 years in the service of
the Nixon-Baldwin Division of
Tenneco Chemicals, Inc. He and
his wife plan to move to St.
Petersburg, Fla. from their‘
home in Metuchen, N. J.

Yanik, who resides with his
wife in Woodbridge, N. J ., had
20‘ years of service, and re-
ceived a severance check for
$1,600. Due to illness, he retired
‘at age 62, without loss-of'any
benefits.’ ‘

Excerpts from Senate Debate on Mne Safety Bill a

The Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safe-ty bill (H.R. 8989) was passed by a 57 to 18 vote in the

US. Senate on June 23.

Quoted below are excerpts from speeches made during the debate on the measure:

Wayne Morse

Senator Wayne Morse (D-Ore.): “. . . The cost of compliance with safety regulations must-be
accepted by management in this country as a part of the cost of operating in a system of private
enterprise. For private, enterprise gives to no employer in this country the right to avoid the reason-
able safety regulations envisioned by this bill, and which in my judgment will flow from the bill if

enacted.”

Lee Metcalf

V Senator Lee Me-tcalf (D-Mont.): “. . . This bill embodies an idea whose time is past due. The
idea is that men who labor under the earth deserve adequate protection from injury or ill health
caused by job hazards. The men in the metallic and nonmetallic mining industry have not had that
protection in the past. They do not have it now. That is why this bill is before us today- There is

nothing sudden or surprising
about this legislation. National
concern in this general area
goes back a long time. For ex-
ample, the report of President
Theodore Roosevelt’s National
Conservation C o in m i s sion in
1909 stated: ‘Even more serious
than the question of waste of
materials is the excessive loss
of life in our mining and metal-
lurgical operation.’

“. . . Almost 50,000 men in
this vital industry, one of the
most ‘dangerous industries in
the United States, are not cov-
ered by any safety legislation
at all. The only way to get such
legislation enacted and to up-
date the other safety legislation
in the states is to pass this
kind of national inspection leg-
islation.”

Frank Moss

‘Senator Frank Moss (D-

, Utah): “We are (Utah), as al-

most everybody knows, one of
the nation’s leading producers
of uranium. It is hard to be-
lieve that in this enlightened
day and age more than half of
this country’s underground ura-
nium miners are exposed reg-
ularly to lung cancer and haz-
ards from radium gas. In a
recent U.S. Public Health Ser-
vice survey, 1,264 miners were
found breathing radon gas on
the job in concentrations de-
clared unsafe. Out of the "544
mines examined, there were
4,080 violations of state mine
safety laws, with little or no at-
tempt in many instances by
state enforcement agencies to

'   _;(D,em.-I._lt’ahl‘

 

enforce or correct the situation
causing the dangers. Some 28
percent of the total number of
miners employed were not cov-
ered by any safety legislation
whatsoever.”

Joseph Montoya

Senator Joseph Montoya ( D-
N.M.): “In my state the experi-

Sen. Joseph Montoya
(Dem.-N.M.)

ence has been as follows: First
of‘all, the legislature has re-
.fused on many occasions to up-
date standards or regulations
that might be required to en-
force a proper safety program.
Second, we have lacked the
manpower in our state to prop-
erly safeguard the ‘miner in the
mines. This is the situation and
pattern .in most states having
mine safety regulations and
laws. There is not adequate
personnel to police safety in
those states‘.

“I think this piece of legisla-

tion will bring a happy day for

    /za-/z//aza

the miners of America because

under federal inspection there ’

will be new safety standards,
and uniform standards through-
out the country, which will in-
ure to the benefit of these wo-rk-
ing people who, when they are
injured, are not adequately
compensated by workmen’s
compensation laws in their re-
spective states.”

Joseph Clark

Senator Joseph Clark (D-
Pa.): “Unfortunately, some of
the operators and the American
Mining Congress were opposed
to that bill in 1953. [Mine safe-
ty bill introduced by Senator
James Murray (D-Mont.)] It
did not pass. They are opposed
to HR 8989 in 1966. But I predict
the bill brought forward by the

Senator from Oregon will pass,

today.

record contains abundant sta-
tistical justification of the need

bill. One is particularly re-

career as an underground metal
miner, no less than 7 of them
can expect to die on the job as
the result of an accident before
retirement age.

“That is a shocking fact.

“Yet the operators are

against this bill.”

Mike Mansfield

Senator Mike Mansfield (D-
Mont.), in remarks after pas-
sage of the bill: “Only yester-
day I approached Senator
Morse to request his services
along with the services of my
Montana colleague [Mr. Met-
calf] to handle this measure on
the ﬂoor today. His presentation
of the purposes and objectives
of the proposals, along with his
articulate and strong advocacy,
contributed greatly to its pas-
sage .

“I pay especial tribute to my
colleague, the
junior Senator from Montana
[Mr. Metcalf], who has fol-
lowed in the footsteps of Jim
Murray, who served for many
years in this body and who tried

during almost his entire ca-'

reer of service to have a bill
of this kind passed. It fell to
his successor, Senator Metcalf,
to pick up the ball and carry it
forward. . The miners of
the nation are fortunate indeed
to have an advocate of his out-
standing skill and ability.”

Report of theSenate
Labor and Public
Welfare Committee
on HR 8989

Quoted below are excerpts
from the report of the Senate
Labor and Public Welfare Com-
mittee on HR 8989, the mine
safety bill:

State Safety Codes
and Administration

“State mine safety laws and
codes by no means covered all
the workers in mineral mining
operations. In only 24 states was
there coverage of 100 percent
of these workers. The remain-
ing states either had no specific
laws or codes, or made them
applicable only to certain cate-
gories of mining. For the na-
tion as a whole, the Mine Safe-

ty Study Board estimated that .
approximately one-third of the . 79‘

workers engaged in mineral
mining, other than coal, were
employed in operations not sub-
ject to any State mine safety
law.

distinguished ’

safety standards which an indi-
vidual state proposed to main-
tain, the funds and qualified
personnel actually required to
enforce these standards were
all too frequently not provided.
The board’s report shows that:
many states employed too few
inspectors to allow thorough

coverage of the mining opera- -

tions within their jurisdiction;
in some states those serving as
mine inspectors were not re-
quired to have had specific ex-
perience in the mining indus-
try, or to have demonstrated
their competence through a
civil service examination or in
any other way; salaries paid
state mine inspectors were fre-

~ quently so low as to raise a

serious question of the ability
of many states to attract and
hold well- qualified inspection
personnel.”

Silicosis and Lung
Cancer

“. . . the committee does wish
to emphasize here its intention
that the standards developed
by the Secretary include stand-
ards with respect to the major
health hazards of -silicosis and ‘
other respiratory diseases re-
lated to excessive concentration
of dust, and of lung cancer and
other diseases related to ex-
posure to high levels of radio-
activity.”

Accident Reporting

“The mandotory reporting’
provision of HR 8989 is a ma-
jor one, and essential to the

purpose of this legislation. The

committee received ample evi-
dence demonstrating the neces-
sity of a mandatory, rather than.

 

 

  
 

merely voluntary, reporting sys-_‘ .
tem, in order to get adequately“ .‘
detailed and complete informs; -

tion from mine operators con-

cerning deaths, injuries and oc-- 
cupational disease conditions 

among their workers.”
