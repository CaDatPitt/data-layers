PREAMBLE

The Communist Party of the United
States is an American working-class
political organization which bases it-
self upon the principles of scientiﬁc
socialism. It champions the immediate
and fundamental interests of the work-
ers, farmers, the Negro people and all
others who labor by hand and brain,
against capitalist exploitation and op-
pression. C —

The Communist Party believes that
the abolition of the exploitation of
man by man, of poverty, war, racism
and ignorance will be ﬁnally achieved
by the socialist reorganization of so-
ciety—by the common ownership and
operation of the national economy un-
der a government of the people led
by the working class. The Communist
Party holds that there are various
roads to socialism and that the work-
ing people of our nation will ﬁnd
their own road to socialism. We ad-
vocate a peaceful, democratic road to
socialism through the political and
economic struggles of the American
people within the developing constitu-
tional process.

3

 

  

The Communist Party seeks to ad-
vance the understanding of the work-
ing class in its day-to—day struggles
for its historic mission, the establish-
ment of socialism. Socialism, through
the achievement of a vastly widened
democracy, will fulﬁll the promise of
an atomic age and guarantee the real-
ization of the right to “life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness,” turning
the epic achievements of American
labor, science and culture to the use
and enjoyment of all men and women.

The Communist Party upholds the
achievements of American democracy
and defends the United States Consti-
tution and its Bill of Rights, particu-
larly the 14th and 15th Amendments
which guarantee equality to the
American Negro, against those who
would destroy democracy. It ﬁghts un-
compromisingly against imperialism
and colonial oppression, for curbing
and breaking the power of monopoly,
against racial, national and religious
discrimination, anti-Semitism and all
forms of chauvinism. It regards the
struggle to wipe out the system of jim-
crowism and to win immediate and
full citizenship and unconditional
equality for the Negro people as basic
to the ﬁght for democracy.

The Communist Party holds as a
cardinal principle that there is an iden-
tity of interest which serves as a
common bond uniting the workers of

4

 

  

all lands. It recognizes that this com-
mon bond is strengthened when work-
ing-class movements operate in an
atmosphere of independence and equal-
ity and exercise the right of fraternal
and constructive criticism. It holds fur-
ther that the true national interest of
our country and the cause of peace
and progress require the solidarity of
all freedom-loving peoples, peaceful
coexistence of all nations, and the
strengthening of the United Nations
as a universal instrument of peace.
The Communist Party bases its
theory generally on the scientific, hu-
manist and democratic heritage of
mankind and particularly on the prin-
ciples of scientiﬁc socialism as devel-

' oped by Karl Marx, Frederick Engels

and V. I. Lenin. These universally
valid principles the Communist Party
of the U.S.A. interprets, applies and
strives to develop further in accord-
ance with the -requirements of the
American class struggle, democratic

\ traditions and ‘customs. In the struggle

for democracy, peace and social prog-
ress, the Communist Party strives to
carry forward the democratic tradi-
tions of Ieﬁerson, Paine, Lincoln and
Frederick Douglass, and the great
working-class and socialist traditions
of William Sylvis, Eugene V. Debs
and Charles E. Ruthenberg. In the
struggle for socialism the Communist
Party seeks no narrow partisan mo-

5

 
  

9

nopoly. It ﬁghts side by side with all
who struggle for socialism and seeks
to cooperate with all socialist-minded
Americans to achieve socialism.

For the advancement of these prin-
ciples, the Communist Party of the
United States establishes the basic laws
of its organization in the following
Constitution:

AR;r1cLE 1

Name

SECTION I. The name of this organiza--
tion shall be the Communist Party of

and extend their democratic rights,
help unite them against monopoly
control of the political and economic
life of our nation, and organize to
eliminate the scourge of economic
crises, unemployment, poverty, racism
and war through the establishment of
socialism by the free and democratic
choice of a majority of the people.
