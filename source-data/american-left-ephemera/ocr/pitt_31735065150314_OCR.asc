 REVIEW .

 

V , ,“.:.,._:..._.....“-,,_..--_ -

 

This is how-the year got under way in its first month:

1 Civil Rights

The conservative Negro press spoke out angrily last ‘month
at the do-nothing policy of the Eisenhower administration in con-
nection with white supremacist terror.

. The New York Amsterdam News said “that the plight of
Negroes in the South is no longer a problem within the several
states. Their mistreatment has become a national disgrace and
their situation has become a-national emergency. . . .

“We have aid for Communist Hungary but not for big-
oted Georgia. We have Federal troops for South Koreans but
not even the FBI for the bombed babies of Montgomery. Our
naval fleet commands the straits of Formosa but we can’t
protect Negro citizens in the bayous of the Mississippi river.

“This doesn’t make sense ‘and we feel that it’s high time for
the Federal government to make it make sense!” ’ -

Said the Pittsburgh. Courier: “The White South is afraid of
the Negro. It fears his brain, his brawn, his vigor, his endurance,
his" creative genius. The White South is not afraid’ of intermar-
riage. It is afraid of competition. »~ '

I “Those Senators who voted for the filibuster in league with
their Southern pals voted to deny freedom to some seventeen
million Americans. That is the long and the short of it. . . .
Freedom meant little to them where the Black American is con-
cerned. Freedom is -for Hungarians.” r "

The Supreme Court of the
United States by a vote of 6 to
3, reversed the Taft-Hartley af-
fidavit conviction of Ben Gold,
former president of the Fur
Worker's union on grounds that
it is an “official intrusion into
the privacy of the jury” for FBI
agents to question jurors;

~ ' The Supreme Court

court ruled that a union has the
right to strike on a contract
reopener issue provided that 60
days’ notice has been given. The

-decision is expected to encour-

age longer term contracts. The
case was one involving the Oil
Workers and an American coal

In an 8 to 0 decision, the company. I " g ‘

I The World Scene

There was growing criticism in Congress, around the U.AS.,
and theworld of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles.-and his
.alleged incompentency. U. S. Senator Wayne Morse (D., Ore.)
‘branded as an “unadulterated lie” a State department attempt
to explain away‘ as “humorous” a Dulles remark that was blasted
by English and French sources as a_‘ slur against the fighting
forces of those countries. Demands were heard from the Demo-
crats that Dulles resign because he “has lost the confidence of
our allies and congress” and has “outlived his usefulness.”

Wellington Long, writing for the Scripps-Howard papers,

charged that “Dulles so. far has defined what the ‘Eisenhower,

Doctrine’ for preventing Soviet invasion, of the Middle Eas't will
not do—but he still has not said what it will do.’.’ '

Congressman Wayne L. Hays (D., Ohio) blasted Dulles for

‘ “too much secrecy in government, and walked out of a hearing

for Dulles’ views on the Middle East.

Meanwhile, the press was underplaying a big story in con- *

nection with the Middle East——the oil companies’ gouge of. the
American motorist. Said _I. F’. Stone’s Weekly: “The 35-cent in-
crease a barrel in the price of gas will add up this year to an
extra tax of close to a billion dollars on the U. S. consumer. . . '.
This is pure steal. . . . Instead of a shortage of gasoline, we have

a glut.” Senator~O’Mahoney (D., Wyo.) called for a Senate’

vestigation.

in-

Other developments in connection with the “international
situation,” as reported by the press, were:

0 UAW Political Director Roy Reuther opposed giving Presi-
dent Eisenhower a completely free hand in the Middle East. ‘

0 Prime Minister Nehru Ofr India said events in Egypt and
Hungary “proved colonial aggression and Communist aggression

are not possible in the modern world.” - .

‘ 0 Prime Minister John Costello accused “national terrorists”
of trying to involve Ireland in a civil war through their under-
ground campaign aimed at driving the British out of Northern

Ireland.

0 Premier Guy Mallet of France said ‘his. country “will never

abandon Algeria."

0 Industrialist Cyrus E. -Eaton said recognition of China was
inevitable. He declared: “We are just hypnotizing ourselves in

the extreme if we try to pretend

sons does not exist.”

Here and There

ORep. James Roosevelt .(D.,
Calif.) and U. S. Senator Wayne
Morse (D.,A Ore.) demanded in-
vestigations of the National
Labor Relations Board. They
said the Board was anti-labor.
. . In one decision involving
the firing of a steel worker,
Board Member Abe Murdock ac-
cused the NLRB of interfering
in the right to strike . . . Mean-
while all labor cheered the
resignation of Theophil C.

' Kammholz as general counsel

of the Labor Board. Secretary
of Labor Mitchell and Secretary
of Commerce Weeks were feud-
ing over his replacement.
OSaid the Cleveland Plain
Dealer: “Employers who hunt
cheap labor have carted Hun-
garian refugees away from
Camp Kilmer by the station
wagon load, -Andrew D.ono, Jr.
-and the Rev. Mathias Daroczy
_charged yesterday at city hall.
‘For slave labor,’ said the Rev.

Mr. Daroczy, ‘they have taken

 

"a nation of 600 million per-

a.

‘them to Oregon and - every-

where.’ ”

0 Legal protection of the
right of a worker to join a
union was upheld by the Texas
Supreme Court in a precedent-
making -case /which‘ held that
the worker needn’t achieve full-
fledged In e In b e r s h i p before
being considered ajunion mem-
ber. . . . President David J. Mc-
Donald of the Steelworkers
charged Donald C. Rarick, his
opponent for election, with ly-
ing when Rarick stated that an
international officer of the union
had offered him $25,000 to drop
out of the race. Rarick had also
said he was offered a_job_, as
“McDonald’s right-hand man.”

0 U. S. Senator William F.

Knowland (R., Calif.) said he
»won’t run for re-election, thus -

clearing the.\way for running
for the governorship——and the
presidency. . . . U. S. Senator
William A. Purtell (R., Conn.)
introduced a bill for a 35-hour
week for Federal employees.

THE MINE-MILL umou I ~-

Legislatures Meeting

The beginning of 1957 found state legisla-
tures convening throughout the nation, and in
many areas Mine-_l_VIill locals were either in full
swing in cooperation with *labor’s legislative
activity generally or were preparing to do so on
local and state levels. ’

Monta n-a‘

On Jan. 21 a series of eight bills for improv-
ing the Montana Workmen’s Compensation act
was introduced in the state legislature by John
V. Healy, together with other legislators. Healy,
a Butte miner, is Democratic representative
from Silver Bow County. The bills, drafted by
the Montana Mine-Mill Legislative committee,
represent a large part of the union’s program
for this _ legislative session. .

Mine-Mill’s full involvement in the state’s

the past month by several events. Board Mem-
ber Ernest Salvas was appointed by the Mon-
tana Democratic Labor Activities committee to
be its Western Congressional District chairman;
lobbying activities in the state capitol were
being carried on by Salvas and members of the
Mine-Mill legislative committee, including com-
mittee vice-chairman Barney Rask and Int’l
Reps. Maurice Powers and George Kalafatich.
Earlier in the month, on Jan. 11, reports’ and
discussion of the state legislative program took
up an important -part of the Montana Mine-Mill
conference attended by International officers

East Helena Mill &‘Sme1terr'nen’s hall.

A major objective of Mine-Mill locals in Ari-
zona during this session of the state legislature
is to get an improved silicosis law approved.

Such a bill was introduced in the last session

by Clyde Dalton, state representative from Co-
chise County, and member of Mine-Mill Bisbee

from the Miami-Globe area. It passed the House
but was blocked in the Senate.

Council in 1957 approved severalpoints for im-
mediate action on legislation: support of the

minimum wage to $1, support of the State Mine
Inspector’s request for an appropriation to give
him additional deputies.

Plans for the Illinois Mine-Mill locals

vate a program are underway, following the
opening of the 70th Illinois General Assembly.
With other labor organizations taking similar
action it is hoped that all plans for legislative
action will be dove-tailed for maximum effect.

bill scheduled to be introduced by state legis-
lator James Brusatto from Bingham Canyon.

tative of the U. S. Department of Labor is being
planned for Feb. 6 to discuss proposals for
amending -the Utah workmen’s compensation
law. "

As Coalition   
Foundation

DENVER—The Mine-Mill
Executive board voted unan-
imously last month to sup-
port the general objectives '
of a -liberal legislation pro-
gram proposed by 28 Dem-
ocratic congressmen. . V ‘

The Mine-Mill board said that
“for, the first time in many
years, an influential group of
legislators have openly identi-
fied themselves with a program
of generally liberal objectives.
Their proposed program offers
the basis for a new coalition of
liberal forces’ in Congress that‘,
can exert a significant influence
on legislation in this session.”

‘The Mine-Mill officers said 
they were “especially pleased ‘to
note that sponsors of this pro- .
gram include many congress-
men who were" supported by‘
Mine-Mill locals; among these
are_ such leading Democrat-s "~-
from the Rocky Mountain area J
as Reps. Lee Metcalf (Mont),
Stewart L. Udall (Ariz.), Gracie
Pfost (Idaho), Wayne N. Aspin-
all (Colo.), and Byron G. Rogers
(C0lo.).” ' I

PROGRAMS J IBE

The union told the congress-
men that major elements of
their program “are in accord
with many, although not all, of
our own legislative aims, as well
as those of all labor and liberal _

» organizations.”

Of special concern to labor,
the union said, , the liberal »'
Democratic program calls for
repeal of Taft-Hartley‘, an in-
crease in the minimum wage
under the Fair Labor Stand ”
ards act, higher unemploy-
ment benefits, “'a stepped up,
sound program of public work
projectsi,” ‘ increased S 0 c i al
Security benefits, and "‘an
expanded and improved Fed-
eral housing prog'1'am de- ,_ ‘
signed to meet the special '
needs of low-income and

* middle income families, and “‘

senior citizens,” as the “pro-
posed program stated when it
was announced in Washing-
ton. , ‘

The union’s Executive Board
said further that the 28 con-
gressmen's proposal for an ex-
panded program of Federal aid
for medical, educational, .hos— .
pital construction, and health‘ ,
services “provides a framework
within Which some of our ob-
jectives for research _and study

- of occupational diseases in our

industry can be realized.”
OTHER PROPOSALS

Other proposals contained in
this program. the union leaders
said, “include goals sought by
all progressive-minded Ameri-
cans. Among these are——elimi-
nation of all ‘discrimination af-
fecting the right to vote and the - ‘
right to engage in gainful oc-
cupation . . . and to insure full‘
protection of the law and the
enjoyment of the security of
person and the rights of citizen-
ship,’ revision of the McCarran-
Walter act, an aid-to-school con-
struction bill, elimination of tax_ A
‘the
most burdensome and inequi-
table excise taxes,’ and reduc-
tion of income taxes ‘as the ‘
budget and general economic
conditions indicate.’

“The program also contains
numerous proposals of special . , '
concern to small business,
farmers, and veterans.”

Especially deserving of sup-‘_
port on foreign policy, the '. -
union said, is a proposed. meas,-* '
tire for strong and constant’

‘ support of

BULLETIN .

‘TORONTO-—Mine-Mill Canadian headquarters an-

’ nounced at press time that the Supreme Court‘ of Ontario

threw out an attempt by the Steelworkers union to block

’ Mine-Mill’s certificationat‘Consolidated Denison Uranium

mine in Blind River. The court upheld the Canadian La-
bour Relations board’s certification. of Mme-M111 at Deni-

son. Bargaining on

a contract" will commence shortly.

Meanwhile, Mine-Mill has applied to the CLRB for

"rehearing at Bicroft Uranium mine in Bancroft area. The

rehearing is scheduled for Feb. 13 ing_Ottawa. Mine-Mill’s
contention is that the CLRB order for a vote, placing Steel
on ballot, is contrary to _Rule 15 governing payment of‘one-
month’s dues with apphcation card.

The Supreme Court of On-

WORKERS REJECT STEEL

ThevSteel Union, with a large
force of organizers, screaming
propaganda, intimidation, free
beer parties, a fast pie-in-the
sky oontractwith the Company
and other gimmicks barraged
the workers to vote “no”
against establishing a union in
the camp. ,

‘Nor was the V company con-
spicuous by its neutrality. They
attempted to pad the voters’ list
by hiring new workers and
transferring area construction
men to the Denison payroll just
on_ the eve of the election. But
these workers too knew that
they needed a union and voted
for. it along with the other
men. ‘ '

cheek, suggested 'a - union would
interfere with the mines de-
velopment program, and W, ld
probably pull a strike in which
case’ the men who invested in
trailer homes, and those con-
templating purchasing a com-
pany house would suffer,_finan-
cial difficulty. '
' Certainly the miners at Deni-
son, the tradesmen, stationary
engineers and surface workers
are to be congratulated on
their united determination in
the face of such a campaign by
the company and ‘the Steel
union. '
DEFIES WORKERS‘

Now Steel is seeking to set
aside the certification issued by
the Canada Labour Relations
Board to Mine Mill. This ac-
_,tion is unprecedented by a
trade union. If flies in the teeth
of - a secret ballot vote of the
workers. Steel‘ waited with
their- court -action until after
the vote‘ was held. A vote which
they and the company worked
with might and main -to turn

into a “no” vote and leave the

workers unrepresented by a
trade- union. , ' _ *2
Approximately 40 new em-

ployees were engaged in the’

four days before the vote was
held. Most of these men have
since left. It proves that they

*were brought in only for one

purpose —— the hope that they
couldybe used -to defeat Mine
Mill in the vote. Steel is fear-
fully desperate in its attempt
to prevent the workers at Deni-
son Uranium Mines from bar-
gaining, because they know that
there are very important wage
increases and other conditions
due to be established which
will expose the deal to which
Steel has tied the workers at
Algom and Pronto Mines for
three years, and will show up
the -company ’ and Steel 1 col-
lusion. '.— . - -

THE reign of terror in the South has three major
causes, as I see it. — ' _

First, the children-—the United States Supreme court
decision which ordered an end to racial segregation in
schools, parks and playgrounds. _ _

0 Second, the ballot——the fight of the Negro people in
the South to vote. 5 "

Third, the union——the growing trade 
t

workers in spite of the white citizens’ ;
councils and the Ku Klux Klan. ‘

The powerful economic and political
rulers of the South and their allies else- __

than they do anything else.- I would like
to quote the big ‘business magazine, U (S.
News and _World Report, once again:

“A politician’s nightmare is shap- Howum

If the white man and the Negro throw down racial
prejudice and work together, unionization, will grow. ,
‘With stronger unions, the workers can do the same job

Safety  

The special supplement on

safety in the mining industry,
published in -the January issue
of the Mine-Mill Union, received
complimentary responses from
members all over the union, but
none as enthusiastic as a ,let-
ter addressed to Sec.-Treas. Pez-
zati from Jim Brady, , safety
committee co-chairman of 'An-
sonia (Conn.) Brass Workers
Union No. 44. Brady writes:

“I must say I am really
proud of you and the other
‘officials of our great union
who brought the true docu-
.mented facts to the House
Labor Sub-committee investi-
gating mine safety, . ; . Al-
though I am employed in the
fabricating end of the copper
industry I was always inter-
ested in‘ safety .in the mines
as well as in the factories.
Myfather often told me sto-
ries of the day when his un-
cle was ‘mining copper in the
days of Marcus Daley. "He _
said what a. hazardous occu-
_pation it was and the little.
{protection the" miners had in
the . way‘ of ‘compensation,
safety and health laws . .. .
Incidentally,_ _my grandunclé
died of silicosis. '-

f‘May I say at this time I go
along 100 percent on your Mine-
Milfprogram that you and your

ington . . .-.- Let Mine-Mill lead
the way in safety for all its
members and we can’t go‘
wrong.” " —

Brady goes on to describ
how the union developed a real
safety program in cooperation
with the company at the Amer-
ican Brass"plant“~—in Ansonia dur-
ing the last year. While re-
..marking that there is still room"
for improvementjhe points with
justifiable union pride at the
record which ‘shows that Nov.
1956 was the first month in 18
years-in which no recorded lost
time accident was listed and
December the second_ month in
31'-years. _ ~

--Last year J Brady received a
personal invitation from the
White House to attend Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s Conference
on Occupational Safety in May,
He represented /Mine-Mill at
that conference, and, as he says,
“It ‘was a "great moment for
me . ,. . also it was thebest bit
of favorable publicity that Mine-
Mill has had in some years. It
really .made me proud.”

, The 1956 performance figures
1' for the non-ferrous metals ‘in-
_ dustry are just beginning to roll
-1 , 'in,and they’re quite impressive.
‘L’ Some new production records
were established in copper mine
. -output and in slab zinc produc-
,_ .t_io'Ii. Mine production of lead
 “and zinc increased over 1955,
’ P and consumption of all.non-fer-
5-rous metals held up very well.

 

 

  
 
  

Complete profits figures for
f V major companies won’t be out
for a while, but there’s no doubt

-. that these, too, will be setting

new records.’ Anaconda, the
, first to report, estimates that
-its 1956’ take, after all taxes,
 was $111,350,000 or 70 per cent
‘higher than its previous record
take of 1955.  ‘

_ FORECASTS
It.’s’not as easy to read the
.future as it is to report what
happened in the past. We have
.'-”'.__‘011I'- usual‘ flock of new year

"forecasts. The trade associa- _

tions in this industry, see a big-
ger and better. year in 1957. A
 moresobér and cautious note is
struckby ASR’s vice president,

 , Simon D. ‘Strauss, in his annual
- _ review of the industry, “Metal
V , Markets in 1956.” Strauss sees
.“a mixed picture” with good

A prospects for “high level” ac-
tivity, but With many uncertain-
ties. ..
_Rarely has there been a time,
within the recent past, when so

_ ’ many “ifs” and “buts” would
»  have to be attached to any fore-

_ cast for this industry. -
"The biggest “if,” of course,,is

v_ -the. general business outlook.
'1 You can, as usual, take your
._.pick among the many predic-
5 ; ~.-tions. Most economists see gen-.

. ' terally good times ahead, at least ~

‘for the next six months, with a.
probable downturn about the
' middle of the year. '
- SPECIAL CONCERNS
-. < So far as thelseparate
'  branches of this industry are
Q concerned, there are many more
special concerns. Here are just
: ‘a few of the more important
5 ,ones: , ‘ T V
 Mounting world stocks of re-
 ’ fined’ copper are putting in-
creased "pressure on present
 ‘ prices. . Supply is again running
' ahead of demand. Here, in the
U. S., sales by fabricators, near
the“'end of last year, were down
about one third from early in
 the year. The “brass business
_has—_been 1. in the doldrums for
the past several months. “ ;_
, Strauss, of ASR, states that
.“Copp]e"r prices, although far be-
low‘ the peak levels, of late 1955
and early,1956, still appear vul-
nerable because of prospective
. increases in supply.” . ' ,
‘ -(Shortly after that was writ-
_-‘t_e'n,' Belgian Congo copper was
 seduced to ‘ about 533- cents a
''''‘‘‘"pound, and custom smelters
' A-‘rppped their ‘price to 34.75

Imports

22 ‘expressed deep concern over
the growing amount of copper
and brass mill products being
imported from abroad and the
effects of these imports on the
domestic. copper and’ brass mill‘
industry. Association manager
T. E. Veltfort said the growing
tonnages of. imports include
copper sheet, rod and tube, and‘
copper-base alloy sheet, strip,
rod, wire and tube. . ,
He said the Association is
“exploring all avenues of ap-
proach that show promise ‘of
affording effective_ relief as

courses ' of, action being E con-
sidered, he said, were control
measures such as tariffs, sec-
tion 7 of the Defense act afford-
ing protection to defense indus-
tries, and - the Anti-Dumping
act. _ - ‘

', Earlier, in Waterbury, Conn.,
Republican Congressman James
T. — Patterson declared that the
influx of ‘.‘cheap' foreign” prod-
ucts is one; -reason ’ for the
steady employment decline in
Naugatuck Valley brass mills
andfabricated metal plants. He
pointed out that West Germany
has already captured 95 percent
of the marketon tubing used in
various products. V

continued on the’ same scale
during 1957. Another possible
danger sign appears «inuthe an-
nounced intention of the British
government to sell 30,000 tons
of its‘ stockpiled lead on the
open market, starting in March.

SAN FRANCISCO, _(;'alif.,+——A

“reportable earnings will be

‘Executive Board Says:

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Consolidation, Organization

Require Boost inPer Capita

DENVER—-Since the 1956 Mine-Mill conven-
tion in Salt Lake City, there has been a grow-
ing sentiment among various councils, districts,
and local unions for improved financial sta-
bility in order to defray the costs of a three-
year consolidation program, including new or-

_ -ganization.

With this sentiment for increased union
-services as a background, the International
Executive board, meeting last month in Den-
ver, voted to recommend to the forthcoming
St. Paul convention that a referendum be held
 increase the international per capita tax by
50 cents a member and that a $3.50 floorbe
set for local union dues.

a DOUGLAS, Ariz.—Exchange of informa-
tion on local grievance problems and legisla-
iive action were the main points under dis-
<:ussion~at the first quarterly meeting in 1957
of the Arizona Mine-Mill Council held here
January 6: Southern Arizona Smeltermen’s

T Union No. 470' was th_e host local.

Preceding the reports and discussion, the

erlelegates elected new officers for the year.
- lloward Mooney, business agent of Miami
Miners Union No. 586, was elected chairman,
and . J. ~W. McDaniels of Ray-Sonora Copper
Workers Union No. 915 vice-chairman.

.A report on servicing of locals, new or-

ganization and the program of the union‘was ‘

made by, District 2 Board Member J. B. Chavez.
APPROVE WIRE

On the question of ‘ national legislation,
the delegates approved a council telegram to
Arizona's Senators Hayden and Goldwater urg-
ing them to vote in favor of curbing filibuster
m the U. S. Senate. A considerable, portion of
the council discussion was devoted to recom-
mendations on bills andappropriations in. the
state legislature on which the delegates were
given latest information by ' Clyde Dalton, a
member of Local 551 in Bisbee’ who is now
serving his second term in the Arizona legisla-
ture. (See legislative roundup on Page 2.)

The delegates also authorized a letter
from the council answering an editorial in the

-*.4mzona Republic which proclaimed the guilt
of the indicted Mine-Mill officers and staff
members before they have been tried and

‘ .charged that the union’s membership is -com--

munist-dominated. The council's letter not
only -denied the Republic’s allegations, but
showed how the rank-and-file nature and dem‘-
ocratic _procedures of Mine-Mill make domina-
tion by any group or individuals impossible.
DESCRIBE DEMOCRACY

The (‘letter described in detail how all ‘In-

-icrnational Union and local elections, constitu-

ional changes, salaries and per capita, etc.,'

,_..,.;‘ote of ‘the, entire ‘membership. It also de-

The increase would bring the total per cap-

ita tax to $1.75 per month.
URGED IN KENNECOTT

The Kennecott council already has gone on
record in support of the proposed increase,
following, a conference in which the whole area
of union finances was considered——including
drastically increased costs, organization of the
unorganized, plans to increase union services
such as research and -education, and the need
for increased space and more efficient union
headquarters. ' ,

The proposed per capita increase follows
a general trend in the labor movement which
is beset by mounting costs in every field of
union activity. -Recently, the business maga-

‘ gzine, U. S. News c6 World Report reported on

the various unions which have increased their
dues, under the heading “Union Dues Are
Going Up.” —

INCREASES

Recent union per capita and dues increases
were put into effect by the International Union
of Electrical Workers (AFL-CIO), Brewery
Workers, Hotel Workers in-New York, Steel-
workers, Rubber Workers, and others. In-
creases are planned by the United Auto Work-
ers and the Longshoremens’ union.

The recommended increase will be referred
to the Constitution committee in St. Paul.

Mentally liiel-T"cnd*"
Children “Booklet

Some practical suggestions to parents of
children who are mentally retarded‘ are con-
tained in a new pamphlet, “The Child Who Is
Mentally Retarded,” just released by the Chil-
dren’s Bureau, U. S. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare.

Out of each 1,000 of the population, 30 are’

mentally retarded, the pamphlet states.. Of
these, 25 are “educable,” and 4 “trainable,” and
one is “totally dependent.” The publication em-
phasizes that although some kinds of retar-
dation are inherited through the parents’ genes,
this doesn’t necessarily mean that retardation
“runs in the family.” “A retarded child or-an
extremely bright child can be born to almost
any parents,” it states. V
The pamphlet emphasizes‘ the value of a
thorough diagnostic evaluation of a child who
appears to be mentally, retarded to determine
how much he can ‘be expected to develop and
how parents can start to plan for the child.
- It also outlines some of the factors which par-
ents would wantpto consider in deciding either
to keep the child at home or to place him away
from home. . » - "

Mike Starr Dies

EAST ST.---LOUIS, ILL.—Michael Starr, fi-
nancial secretary of Fairmont Smelter Workers
Union No. 82, died suddenly and unexpectedly
from a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 27, 1956. He
was 41 years old and leaves a wife and four
children. ‘_ V i 4 ‘

Mike’s passing is mourned by all who -knew
him. — He was active in his community civic .,af_-
fairs and was outstanding as one ofthe most ac-
tive union members of Local, 82.’ The day he
(tiled he had just been re-elected financial secre-
ary.  ~'  
Mike held severalimportant posts in the 10-
cal during his 23, years in the American Zinc
plant: financial secretary, vice president,’ trus--
tee,f-plant. committeeman, negotiating committee
member, and convention delegate on several oc-
casions. He was a plant electrician during most
of the years he worked. _ . ,-
The officers and committeemen of the union
were his pallbearers. George McKenna, a ‘re-
tired member, conducted graveside rites from
the ritual of the International Union. ,
scribed the democratic way in which Mine-
Mill conventions are conducted, and »the"com-
plete freedom of local unions to decide on
strike action by majority vote of their own
members. .  v «

“As the readers of your newspaper can
see,” the ‘council letter concluded, “with this
kind of rank-and-file democracy our Union's
membership cannot be dominated by Commu-
nists, Republicans, Democrats or any other
group or individuals, including newspaper edi-
-tors. We respectfully urge the readers of your
newspaper“ to compare the democratic prin.
ciples and policies of our Union with those of
any other organization in America and judge
for themselves.” ' ‘_

pointing out that this,“will re-

burden ofoccupation disabilities
in our society.” His talk pointed
up the need for rehabilitation
of the industrially injured and
diseased. workers, especially in

try. , -

WASHINGTON — Mine-Mill
members in Arizona will be
interested, and no doubt sur-
prised, to know that Republi-
can Senator Barry Goldwater
of their state has introduced
-a bill to repeal the_ non-Com-
munist affidavit provision of
the Taft-Hartley act.
Nobody_ was more surprised
«by the Goldwater bill. than
Michigan’s Dem. Senator Mc-
Namara, the only trade union- '
ist in the Senate. McNamara
introduceda bill to repeal the
T-H oath early last session,
but couldn’t even get it re-
ported out of committee.
Goldwatenintroduced his bill,
almost identical with McNa-

time to reintroduce his.
Goldwater is up for’ re-elec-

REASON FOR ATTACK

Our deliberations have con-
vinced us that it is precisely be-
cause’ Mine-Mill has achieved
new -growth, strength, and sta-
bility, and is making more prog-
ress than it has made in several

years, that the present Alegal at-C

tacks on the union are taking
place. '
‘A strong Mine-Mill, a grow-
ing Mine-Mill, obviously is not
desired by those forces who
have tried‘ to weaken the bar-
gaining position of_-the work-
ers in our '. industry. There.
are some employers who are
trying to weaken‘ this union.

‘ There are raiding unions likaA._-

sthe, ‘Steelworkers who ‘still
cherishA_Aho'pes of gaining a
foothold in the ‘non-ferrous.

- metals industry, despite. their
many past failures. There are
-anti - labor politicians who
have taken another ‘wrap off
the Taft-Hartley law and are
beginning to use it in an at-
temptto cripple the political
effectiveness not only of this
union, but of ‘ many other
unions.

, FALSE CHARGE-

The
acy” indictment of 14 past and
present officers an‘d_staff mem-
bers - cannot be explained with
the false charge of .“commu-
nism." Neither can the sched-
uled Brownell-Butler ‘hearings
before the Subversive Activities
Control Board. This Executive
Board has made’ it amply clear
that the .A leaders of--this union
hold , no brief for communism,
the Communist‘ Party, or its
program. . ‘ -

We are opposed toall forms

of dictatorship, including the’

Communist, and we stand, as
always for the’ elimination of
all attacks on freedom ‘of
thought and civil rights, wheth-
er -the arena is Hungary, South
Africa, or. the public schools,
buses, mining camps and fac-
tories of our own United

  

States. We believe in and are

recent inflation. (‘See story 0

increase in per capitalevy and

Taft-Hartley ‘ “conspir-_

devoted -to the American ‘demo-
cratic system.

The Officers of this union
were telling the truth when they
signed the Taft-Hartley‘ non-
communist affidavits. We will
continue to sign” these affida-
vits in order to protect the in-
terests of this union and its
membership. Nor has there
been any “conspiracy” on the
part of leaders of this union to
violate the Taft-Hartley act.

EVIDENT STRENGTH
It is obvious that the present
legal attacksagainst the union
do -not make_our tasks of con-
solidation and growth” any eas-
ier, but it ‘must be noted that
so evident is the increased
strength of our union that only
this week an important employ-
er magazine in the industry.de-
voted its entire labor column

the subject.’ ‘ I . _
In its January issue, EN-

. _ GINEERING MINING _

JOURNAL, certainly no
friend of the Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers, reports the
union's victory over the Pre-~
cision Scientific Company and
the National Labor Relations
Board in the Supreme Court

' of the United States. The Su-

preme Court’s 9 to 0 decision

‘ "in favor of Mine-Mill is-frank-

ly assessed by the magazine
as “the union’s- biggest vic-
tory to date. It virtually as-
sures that the Anonferrous /
union cannot be disrupted as
bargaining representative for
at least several years.” A
The JOURNAL says that" the
victory “ended, once.-and for all,
attemptswby the National Labor
Relations Board to have Mine-
Mill disqualified. from Board
processes.” ‘ "A
