MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL

On June 4, 1952, in the Federal courtroom of Judge Wil-
liam C. Mathes in Los Angeles, counsel for 14 Communist
Party leaders, charged with violation of the Smith Act,
argued motions for acquittal.

The prosecution had rested their case; presented their evi-
dence and witnesses. Now the defense urged the judge to
acquit the defendants, arguing that the prosecution had
wholly failed in three and a half months of trial, to prove
that the defendants advocated forcible overthrow of the
government.

William Schneiderman, Chairman of the Communist Party
in California, acts as his own attorney in the case. Schneider-
man, accordingly, argued his own motion for acquittal to
the Court.

In a larger sense, he argued more than the cause of all the
defendants and the cause of his Party. For, in truth, the
right of advocacy for all Americans is really on trial

_ in Los Angeles. Excerpts of Mr. Schneidermanfs argu-
ments, beginning on page 9557 of the official transcript,
are given here.

 

Defendant Schneiderman:

Your Honor, I wish to discuss two aspects of our
contention that the evidence in this case, even taken
at its face value, does not prove the charge . . . . .

 

“. . . the defendants
engaged in ordinary
functions of a politi-
cal party . . ."

“. . . an unpopular
opinion might be-
come a majority opin-
ion if it is not sup-
pressed. For example
. . . Korea.”

in the indictment; that there is insufficient evidence to go
to the jury; and that there is affirmative evidence to justify
an acquittal. ' I .

The first question is one that has already been argued
some by other counsel, but I want to deal brieﬂy with one
phase of it.

There is a great deal of evidence showing that the defend-
ants engaged in ordinary functions of apolitical arty, deal-
ing with foreign and domestic policy, with legis ative mat-
ters, and with elections, etc. " -.

This evidence shows no proof of anything, except the ex-
ercise of rights that should be rotected by the First
Amendment. All it proves is that t e Government policies,
certain policies of the Government—-—in this case, not all
of them—-were criticized in the course of these activities.
It is true they were criticized more rnilitantly, more funda-
mentally than by other parties, and with s ecial appeal to
the working class. But we do not grant e claim of the
Government that one par? has less rights to appeal to class
interests of workers and armers, than anotherparty has to
appeal to class interests of southern landowners or of
bankers.

Now, there is some evidence in the record—and all of it
has not been stricken, I understand, although we have not
gone fully through the record—that dealing with certain
phases of foreign policy which the party advocated, the
prosecution has claimed and will claim that this evidence
tends to show some unlawful purpose or motive.

We contend that the platform of a olitical party and the
motives behind that platform and e hilosophy behind
that platform cannot be left for the overnment or the
courts to decide as to which views are safe to present to the
peo 1e and which are not, as to which foreign polizﬂis

‘ the est interests of the country and which are harm

cause only the people can decide that.

For instance, one policy at one period of time might be
considered good for the country and at a later time a chantge
in public opinion may take. place which may come to e
conclusion that such a ‘policy is disastrous for the country.
An unpopular opinion might become a majority opinion if
it is not suppressed.

For exam le, there was some evidence original! in the

record, w ich has been stricken," regarding what e Com-

munist party said on Korea. _

It is generally conceded, I believe, that public opinion in
the country is growing to the effect that our remaining in

 

 

Korea was a mistake. This was shown by the recent Gallu
ll, that is, it even showed that the majority of the peop e
elt it was a mistake to go into Kor .

Now, if the original unpopular view on Korea had been
completely suppressed, as it came very close to being within
the ast year or two, this would have struck at the right of
the majority to change their mind on such an important
questionof foreign policy and to speakout on it.

And this only emphasizes the evil of political trial
such as this which attempts to try issues which we
contend are not triable in a courtroom.

Now, the second question I wish to discuss: the Govern-
ment's contention 15 that the defendants adhered to the
principles of Marxism-Leninism, and that these princi les
of Marxism-Leninism equal force and violence; and t at,
therefore, the defendants advocated the principle of violent
overthrow of the United States Government. .

We believe that the evidence does not bear this out; and
we .invite the Government to show the contrary. In fact
the evidence proves the contrary.

There are three categories, of evidence in regard to what
the theory of Marxism-Leninism is, and I will only attempt
to summarize it, for the sake of brevity, and I will try to
summarize it accurately, although I am not referring spe-
cifically to any point in the record. . I

- These three categories are the books which have been intro-

duced, the speeches or staternents of defendants, and
the statements of third parties.

Now, the books reveal that what is being discussed in this
trial is a complex body of thought, a scientific theory of
social change which inter rets history and predicts the future
course of historical deve opment. Its major remise is that
socialism is inevitable as the next stage ofp historical de-

l velopment.

Now, the books of Marx and Lenin and Stalin that are in
evidence-—have a great deal to say about how revolution
from ca italismto socialism will take place, based on ast
historical experience; and they also discuss the conditions
under which violence occurredin the past. .

From this the prosecution draws the conclusion that the

- books in evidence constitute advocacy of violent overthrow

of the United States Government. But the evidence shows

I that Marxism-Leninism does not lay down a blueprint for

revolution; but, on the contrary, while general theoretical
conclusions are drawn whichapply to all capitalist coun-

\\
e

. . the govern-
ment's contention . . .
that . . . the defend-
ants advocated the
principle of violent
overthrow . . . the
evidence does not

bear this out . . ."

tries, it stresses that revolutionary change fromone eco-
nomic system to another, and the transfer of . power from
one class to another takes place in different ways in differ-
ent countries and periods, depending on a whole set of
historical circumstances then prevalent.

Now, it can and has taken place, asthe evidence will show,
at times peacefully when peaceful channels were open. It
has been accompanied by violence when the minority pre-
vented or attempted to revent the majority from exercising
its will by peaceful an constitutional means.

The prosecution in this case has relied on books which
have discussed mainly the Russian revolution under condi-
tions of the czarist regime, or the Paris Commune under
conditions of the Franco-Prussian war to prove advocacy
of violent overthrow of the United States Government under
totally different historical circumstances. ‘

Sometime: we have thought, while listening to the quota-
tion: which the or/emment has read here, that we are being
charged with atzézocatin the overthrow of Rmzrian czaritm.
Nov‘, there is no roof that these books were so used or
ux lcrstood or taug t by the defendants as applying in the
way read to the conditions in the United States at this time.
The evidence at most simply says that the defendants used
the books without any sign of how they used them.

I want to refer to a statement made by the court on Febru-
ary 28 to the following effect. I quote:

“It is not what was taught in schools as far as these
defendants are concerned; it is what they understood
to be taught and advocated by the Communist Party.
And more than that, it is not only what they under-
stood, but what they intend to result from it, not re-
motely, but immediately, relatively.”

Now, we contend that the quotations which have been
used from these books have been torn out of their context
and their meaning distorted, and that they do not prove
the government's charge in the indictment. As a matter of
fact, the prosecution has really had to strain itself to t to
draw some analogy between the conditions discusse in
some of these Marxist classics and the conditions under
which the Communist Party in the United States operates.

_Or more directly, let us take the questidn that was dis-
cussed in the Marxist classics about how, communists use

the slogan. “Turn the imperialist war into a civil war”.
This slogan, as is showntby the evidence, was used under
certain historical conditions in the eriod of the first World
War, but there is no evidence in the record that this slogan

 

 

was ever applied in the United States by the Communist
Party of the United States. Perhaps the best test of this
would be to show that there is some evidence that at the
outbreak of the Korean war, the Communist Party of the
United States used this Leninist slogan and applied it to the
particular war situation when war broke out in Korea, but
there is no evidence that this slogan was ever applied by
the Communist Party of the United States to a war situa-

- tion which has existed since the middle of 1950.

‘Furthermore, there is considerable evidence in the record

that Marxist-Leninist theory, as understood by the defend-
ants, adds new propositions or revises old ones that become
outdated.

The record shows that the thesis of Marx and Engels was
advanced in the 1870's that a peaceful change could take
place in England and America under those conditions. It
also shows that under different conditions in the war period
of 1917, Lenin stated that that thesis of peaceful change no
longer held good, which only goes to prove our con-
tention that the ‘most basic propositions of Marxist-
Leninist theory are not unchanging, and they change
in accordance with the conditions that exist, because
further in the record it is also shown by uotations from
Stalin's Problems of Leninism, that this thesis of Lenin that
peaceful change could no longer take place in modern im-

perialist countries is in turn partially revised by Stalin in

1927 when he quoted that under certain possible historical
circumstances in the future, exceptions to Lenin’s thesis
were still possible.

"We contend further that the evidence on the policies

adopted by the Seventh World Congress, which have be-

come the policies of the Communist Party in the United

States, opened up a new perspective in 1935 for peaceful
change in the United States through the adoption of a Peo-
ple’s Front policy, because it opened up the perspective of
fighting for the election of a people’s front government.

At one time, your Honor will recall how much we insisted
on the fact that every time a book or a quotation was
read, that the date of that book should be read and, if
possible, that the historical circumstances, the historical
circumstances in which it was written, should be at least
mentioned in order that it cannot be completely twisted
and torn out of context and its meaning distorted.

Our insistence on the reading of these dates and trying to
indicate the historical circumstances about which they were
written, was in accordance with this principle, that we
maintain is established in the evidence, that even the most
basic ropositions of Marxist-Leninist theory do not ap ly
for al time and can be modified and changed, and that

“fighting for the elec-
tion of a people‘:
front government. . .”

“. . . the danger of

in any case they are applied in different ways in different
countries. _

Now, in regard to the defendants’ own statements and
speeches, the record shows that these were largely on ques-
tions of foreign and domestic policy, on legislative matters.

There were isolated instances, as I recall, there were not
more than a half dozen or a dozen instances all together
where over a 15-year period defendants’ statements or
speeches were brought into the record as to anything that
could be remotely considered advocating the overthrow of
the government by force and violence.- '

Here, of course, I am assuming for the sake of this argu-
ment the truth of the testimony given by the witnesses,
distasteful as it is for me to do so, but nevertheless, even
on the basis of the evidence as it stands from the govern-
ment’s point of view, the statements of the defendants and
the s eeches that they have made in the big majority were
spee es that indicate they are carrying out their function as
members or officers of a political party, and at most these
particular references to force and violence were references

. that constitute prediction and not advocacy, prediction of

force and violence under conditions that might develop
when no peaceful means were open to brin about a
change, such as the danger and the threat of ascism, of
which we have spoken so much, and which the literature
in the record indicates so clearly. .

An additional thing that has to be borne in mind, and this
illustrates the danger of these kind_ of proceedings,
the evidence shows intense discussion and debate on differ-
ences in party meetings. Are the individual statements that
are made in the course of these debates and discussions, or
even the conclusion from these debates, whether they are
of defendants or others, taken out of context many times,
to be presented as the sum total of Marxist-Leninist theory
and practice? If this is to be permitted, then it strikes a
blow, not only at the Communist Party, functioning as. a
political arty, which the government denies it is attem ting
to stop, ut at the right of all parties to discuss and ebate
and formulate their policies under such a threat.

It establishes the principle of guilt by association, that
is, the principle of guilt by association of individuals, as
well as the principle of guilt by association of ideas.

If this principle is applied in this case, it only points
up the danger of trying books and ideas, and in any
case, the acceptance of this kind of evidence as proof means
we are not being tried even for our own words and actions,

but for somebody else’s words and actions.

 

 

"SO IN CONCLUSION, YOUR HONOR, I MAINTAIN THAT THE EVIDENCE

The last point I want to deal with is that the evidence
affirmatively proves the innocence of the defendants on
the charge in the indictment. The literature of the Com-
munist Party which is in the record shows affirmatively, and
I invite and challenge the government to show the contrary,
first, that the Communist Party and the members of the
Communist Party through its official actions stress the
difference between bourgeois democracy and fascism, and
stress the difference between bourgeois democracy in the
present period of time and reactionary re imes of an
earlier period that are discussed in many 0 the classics
in Europe.

Secondly, that this literature calls for the defense of bour-
geois democracy against fascism and ex resses the belief
that fascism is not inevitable and, there ore, expresses the _ “. . . they express the

majority of the American people by peaceful and consti-
tutional means.

Fourthly, they call for the election of a people's front gov-
ernment as the immediate objective of the Communist Party.

Fifthly, they see socialism as the ultimate aim, but not as
the immediate issue in this country.

Sixthly, they see the possibility of violence only if the
minority tries to prevent the majority from exercising its
will or defying the constituted -authority of a government
of the majority.

SHOWS NO PROOF OF THE CHARGE IN THE INDICTMENT, THAT ON
THE CONTRARY, THE EVIDENCE SHOWS AFFIRMATIV E PROOF OF OUR
INNOCENCE AND CALLS FOR A JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL BY THIS
