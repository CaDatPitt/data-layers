THE VALLEJO BRANCH SWINGS INTO
ACTION!

Good news came from Vallejo
this month when the branch or-
dered 200 copies of the Jerry
Newson Story. Of 65 already
sold, Roger Fleming, branch
chairman; has sold 50 copies
singled handed in this Navy-
controlled town.

OUT IN THE LEAD.

Last reports,had Ray Thompson

,pf the Berkeley Branch, near-
ing the 500 mark in his remarn
kable efforts to sell 1,000
copies of "he Book. This
places Thompson as top seller
in the county, When asked,
"How do you do it?" he replied
rather modestly, "Oh, I just
leave a few to be; sold here
and there in stores of all

kinds and ask everybody I meet
to buy one."

Thompson is a icinch to be a-‘
wardedr along with many top
sellers upon completion of the
campaign to sell 10,000 copies.

S0 THAT'S HOW ITS DONE.l

Three persons from the Rich~

‘waitress,

mend Branchy spent three hours
on a lovely Sunday morning re-
cently in North Richmond and
sold 105 copies. How did they

do it? "Door-to-door," said
the spokesman. The sellers
were: Harry Avington, Mrs.

Mary Brown, and Hugo Armstrong. ’.

HOW DOES IT_ FEEL TO BE BAFFLED? 

Ask Mrs.-Decca Treuhaft, East
Bay Head of CRC. She and a
friend went into a swanky joint
out in the lake district to
chew recently. The waitress
approached and said, "Order
please."- .

“Oh, by the way," Mrs.Treuhaft
asked the waitress, V while
flashing The Book, "have you_
read this?" "No," said the
"But I don't think
he was guilty, it was preju-
dice that convicted him.’

Looking sternly at Mrs. Trou-
haft and her friend, the wait-

ress added,"See you two would-

n't understand what prejudice

means, but I used to work with

colpred people and I know."

Thereupon, Mrs.Treuhaft seized
the initiative and left l0cop-

ies with the waitress to sell.
