peoples victory in 1948 %

Republicans have now increased their representation in the
House from 187 to 249; and in the Senate from 37 to 51.
Also they have increased their control of state administra-
tions from 23 to 25.

This means, obviously, that the main party of monopoly
reaction—the G.O.P.—the party of Hoover, Dewey, Vanden-
berg, and Taft, has increased its electoral positions, nationally.
It has obtained a deﬁnite majority in Congress, in both the
House and the Senate, for the ﬁrst time since 1928, and it has
secured certain electoral advantages to prepare for the 1948
elections. This likewise means that the trusts will now be em-
boldened to intensify their attacks upon the people outside
of, as well as within, Congress.

Secondly, the Democratic Party——the second party of Big
Business—-has emerged from these elections in a greatly weak-
.ened position. As a national party, the Democrats have been
reduced to the status of a minority party, smaller, weaker,
and less inﬂuential than at any time in nearly two decades.

Of some 34 million votes cast on November _5, the G.O.P.
obtained a so-called “normal" vote of roughly 19 million,
while the Democrats received only some 15 million vbtes, or,
in, other words, fell behind, in terms of 1944 percentages and
the increased voting population, by over 8 million votes.

In connection with the Democratic -vote, the following also
needs to be noted. ‘Some 50 per cent of the pro-Roosevelt and
pro-labor Congressmen from the Northern, Eastern and West-
ern states were defeated for re-election. Moreover, most of the
Northern machines, largely dominated by the Catholic hier-
archy which collaborated toward the destruction of the Roose-
velt progressive policies, lost ground and were considerably
undermined. ..

The next and one of the most outstanding features of the
recent Congressional elections is the fact that while the Right-
ist forces, including some of the most extreme reacfionaries,
increased their electoral strength, there was no G.O.P. land-
slide and no mass swing of the. electorate to the Right, to re-
action.

No Landslide

For instance, while the G.O.P. secured sizable gains in Con-
gress, and while the Democrats——libera1 as well as conserva-
tive—sustained numerous setbacks, the labor-progressive forces
did succeed in winning a number of important, even though
limited election victories.

Outstanding among these victories were the signal triumph
of Congressman Marcantonio, the re-election of Senator Kil-
gore and of Congressmen Powell, Price, Holliﬁeld, Miller
and Douglas; the election of Senator McGrath and of Con-
gressmen Carroll, Blatnik, and Donahue; the highly impressive
vote for Congressional candidate Bobrowicz in Milwaukee,
as well as the substantial vote of 427,000 received by the
American Labor Party in New York. .

These victories were, in the main, secured in the course
of the most bitter political struggles, by ﬁghting on the vital
issues of peace, security and democracy; by rebuffing or taking
the offensive against the Red-baiters; and by welding, in vari-

ous degrees, a measure of all-inclusive progressive unity, rang-

ing in many cases from the Roosevelt Democrats to the Com-
mumsts. ., -

Signiﬁcant, too, is the fact that in addition to the notable
re-election of the Negro Congressmen Powell and Dawson, a
number of Negro candidates were elected to several State
Legislatures, as in Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan and New
York; also in scores of other contests, Negro candidates, many
of. them Communists, polled proportionately the highest vote
ever recorded for Negro nominees. _

Not least of all, there is the generally relatively high, Com-
munist Party vote which in many states (though not in
Michigan or Indiana) more than doubled in comparison with

previous elections. Outstanding was the more than 90,000

votes secured by the two Communist state candidates in New
York, Robert Thompson and Benjamin J. Davis, Jr. Despite
the evident limitations of the Party's campaign, the Commu-
nist vote testifies to the growing inﬂuence of our Party, the
soundness of our election policies and platform of struggle,

9

O

and to our efforts to promote labor and anti-fascist unity and
the broadest coalition of all anti-war and anti-monopoly
forces.

Equally, if not more indicative of the fact that these elec-
tions did not register a Republican “sweep” and a “turn of
the people to the Right,” is the numerical relationship of
forces expressed in the elections. Nationally, a shift of less
than 6 per cent of the electorate would have swung the elec-
tions away from the G.O.P., while in some 70 Congressional
contests, a shift of from 1 to 3 per cent of the vote would have
defeated the G.O.P. nominees. This fact in itself also dem-
onstrates that the results of the elections were not inevitable,
that they could have been avoided.

Large Stay-Away Vote

Without minimizing the signiﬁcance ofthese G.O.P. vic-
tories, it is clear that most of the Congressional contests were
not decided by a landslide vote; they did not represent a mass
trend of the electorate toward the G.O.P. In fact, what is most
striking in the ’46 elections is the fact that over 8 million
voters, the majority of whom are undoubtedly independent in
their party preference and aﬁiliation, and have heretofore sup-
ported Franklin D. Roosevelt, stayed away from the polls on
November 5. _

This can in no way obscure the fact that from 2 to 3 mil-
lion of the electorate did shift their votes in these elections as
compared with 1944. But even so, an analysis will show that
this shift was by no means uniform or exclusively a shift to
the Right.

An examination of theelections in the chief industrial cen-
ters and in most of the states indicates the following: a rela-
tively high percentage of the independent voters, especially
among C.I.O. workers and the Negro people, abstained from
voting; in such states as Washington, California and Wiscon-
sin, a sizable proportion of the A. F. of L. and railroad work-
ers voted Republican; in Harlem and the South side of Chi-
cago, the Democrats carried the heavily Negro populated Con-

10

 

 

 

gressional Districts, even though the G.O.P. maintained its '44
vote, while the Democratic plurality was reduced, whereas in
St. Louis and Philadelphia, the G.O.P. made pronounced in-
roads among the Negro electorate; in such areas as Boston,
Queens (New _.York City), and Philadelphia, the G.O.P. in-
creased its vote among the Irish-Catholic population; in many
districts, as in Seattle, the veterans voted Republican in consid-
erable numbers, although in Denver, Peoria (I1l.), and -the
18th District in New York City, the majority of the vets sup-
ported the progressive candidates; in the Midwestern, North
Eastern and Central states, and on the Paciﬁc Coast, the
G.O.P. increased its vote in the rural areas; and, ﬁnally, it
must be noted that in practically all of the industrial areas,
there was a much higher vote for the G.O.P. in '46 in compari-
son with ’44 from among the city middle-class voters.

In analyzing the reasons for the small but telling shift‘

which did take place among important sections of the met-
ropolitan voters, as well as the evident apathy and abstentions
among large sections of the independent voters—who com-
prise roughly one-third of the electorat:e—it is necessary to re-
emphasize the following points which were signalized in the
preliminary statement of the National Board on November
7 and in subsequent editorials and articles in the Daily
Worker: '

Why the G.O.P. Won

a) The G.O.P. electoral 'victory took place because, in the
absence of a new, mass party alignment of a broad, indepen-
dent democratic coalition, the electorate had no alternative
between the Democratic and Republican parties. Hence, in
view of the popular indignation over the meat and housing
shortages and the spiraling cost of living, and in view of the
betrayals, weaknesses and procrastinations of the Truman Ad-
ministration in regard to the most burning domestic issues
as well as in the ﬁeld of international affairs, large numbers
of: working people expressed their mass discontent with the
Administration and its party principally by abstaining, or,’in
certain instances, by voting G.O.P. s

1 1

 

 

b) The equivocal and capitulating position of the Adminis-
tration, its abdication of Roosevelt’s program in foreign pol-
icy and in internal affairs, its soft-pedalling of the central is-
sues, its defensive campaign and generally weak candidates, its
surrender to and perverted competition with the Red-baiters—
all played into the hands of the G.O.P. and the giant trusts.
Thus, the most reactionary forces were able demagogicallyto
confuse and mislead millions of voters, to seize upon the eco-
nomic discontent of the masses, and to capitalize on the central
G.O.P. campaign slogans: “Had Enough? Vote Republican”;
“Vote Against ‘Confusion, Communism and Corruption.’ ”
“Foreign policy is not an issue-—it is bi-partisan and national.”

c) The A. F. of L. top ofﬁcialdom, largely pro-Republican
and anti—Rooseve1t in philosophy and orientation, -contributed
greatly to the G.O.P. victory. By obstructing and paralyzing
A.  of L.-C.I.O. joint action in the elections in most states
and districts, by echoing and refurbishing all the scurrilous
anti-Communist and, anti-P.A.C. slanders and attacks of the
G.O.P., and by calling for “free enterprise” and an end to all
government wage and price controls, the A. F. of L. top lead-
ers plumped for a Republican triumph.

d) The notorious traditionally weak ties ‘between labor and
the city middle classes——as well as with the 'farmers—accentu-
ated by the two waves of prolonged economic strikes which
have taken place in the postwar period, during which these
sections of the population were confronted with inﬂationary
price rises and frozen salaries and incomes——tended to make
large segments of the professional, salaried and white collar
employees victims of G.O.P. demagogy, of Red-baiting and
labor-baiting. -

e) Lastly, the adverse and negative shifts among the elec-
torate and the marked apathy among several million progres-
sives, can be ascribed, in part, to certain grave, subjective
weaknesses and shortcomings which afflicted key sectors of
the labor-progressive camp, including the Communist Party.
Just as the public struggle of Wallace on“ the issue of foreign
policy, as well as the Chicago Conference of Progressives, came
too late decisively to influence the outcome of the elections,

12

 

 

 

so, too, many of the Left-wing labor and people’s organizations
moved too slowly and veryibelatedly to mobilize for the de-
feat of the reactionaries in these elections. Feverish last minute
efforts were made by P.A.C., including its Left wing, to achieve
an all-out mobilization of the progressives in the ﬁnal weeks
of the elections. But this, in the main, came under the head-
ing of “too little and too late.” ‘

Party Weaknesses

In this connection, even certain sections of the Communist
Party were derelict in their duty. Some Party committees: and
sections were virtually immobilized throughout most of the
campaign. In the early stages of the elections, the Party in
some districts lagged behind events, failed to influence the
selection and nomination of candidates in the primaries and

to press for the adoption of a progressive coalition program.

and campaigning.

In other districts infantile “Left”-sectarian attitudes and
practices were expressed in an attitude of a “plague on both
your houses,” in tendencies to “go it alone.” Such viewpoints

V confused‘ the position to be taken by our Party toward both

major parties with that to be taken toward individual candi-
dates running in the established party primaries and sup-
ported by various coalitions.

Such ‘Leftist attitudes confused the question of running inde-

pendent tickets and forming independent progressive party
alignments, with what had to be.done to advance 1abor-pro-
gressive independent political action and mass movements,
concretely, in each situation and in a variety of forms. Such
tendencies fed the sectarian concept that the Party's election
campaign and candidates were to be approached as something
apart and isolated from our role and major responsibility
in advancing labor’s independent mass political action and
forging the broadest electoral coalitionof all labgr-progressive
and pro-Roosevelt elements and groupings around a common

platform of ‘struggle.

These viewpoints and practices, these subjective factors op-
erating within the labor and progressive movement, coupled

.13

 

 

N

with the damaging position and the reactionary policies of
/ - V the Administration, and many of the Democratic candidates,

the absence of a new people’s_party alignment and channel;-4

as well as the widespread illusions regarding the length of the l

so-‘called postwar economic boom—explain, in the main, why

on November 5. _

‘ a marginal shift took place among 5 per cent of the electorate
and why some 20 per cent, of the electorate of the so-called
normally “independent voters” stayed away from the polls

1 II. Immediate Post-Election

Perspectives

NOW that the Congressional elections are over, an analysis
of what happened and why is important though by no
means sufficient. What is necessary now is to survey soberly
the consequences of the elections, the perspectives, and the
tasks. '
Irrespective of any differences that may exist in estimating
the causes of the election results, it is clear for all to see that

the post-election outlook shapes up somewhat as follows: ‘

a) the G.O.P. electoral victory will usher in a period of sharp-
ening monopoly reaction on the domestic scene and in for-
eign policy; b) this offensive of the trusts and their political
spokesmen will meet with increased popular, mass resistance
at home and stubborn opposition from the peoples abroad;
and c) the ensuing economic and political struggles will fa-
cilitate the trend towards a new progressive political realign-

, ment within the country.

Let us briefly examine each of these points:

Firstly, it is a matter of fact and not of speculation that the
Republican gains on November 5 signalize that the big cor-
porations will now unleash a more determined and arrogant
attack against the living standards, civil rights and national
security of the American people. While this reactionary on-
slaught will be many-sided, indirect as well as direct, ﬂagrant

and demagogic, it also will be repressive and dangerous.
Even prior to the convening of the 80th Congress, the

G.O.P. stalwarts, with Truman’s acquiescence and coopera-

tion, compelled the elimination of practically all price con-

trols, thereby——in the period since June, 1946, a1one—facilitat-

ing a rise of 64 per cent in most foodstuffs and essential com-

15

 

 

' i I '  .~.:_:'«:.~.«.e=;.—  ~32;-..a‘.~‘:‘: -V: -1

modities. Also, these Tories have inﬂuenced Truman to re-
institute the yellow-dog injunction and generally to proceed
in a brazen and coercive manner to deny equitable wage ad-
justments to the miners, thereby hoping to set a strike-break
ing pattern for the forthcoming wage movements in the other
basic industries. Thus, too, the G.O.P. Congressional spokes-
men have announced to the United Nations that this Country
will now terminate or drastically curtail its contributions to
U.N.R.R.A. and will follow a “tougher” foreign economic

policy.
What G.O.P. Will Do

Of course, the G.O.P. will maneuver and make demagogic
gestures on a number of issues, such as in connection with the
unseating of Bilbo. Of course, the Republican victory ol
November 5 does not yet signify the coming to power of fas-
cism in the United States. But let there be no mistake about
it, if the renewed oﬁensive of the trusts and arrogant G.O.P.
Toryism is not checked and defeated now and in time, the
extreme reactionaries represented within the G.O.P. and the
fascists centered around American Action, Inc., will succeed
in usurping power and inaugurating the dictatorial terror—rule
of the most fascist-minded"monopolies.

_ With an eye on the political weathervane of ’48, the G.O.P.,
naturally, will try to soft-pedal and sugarcoat many of its
proﬁteering and anti-democratic measures. Yet no one should
underestimate the dangers to labor and our democracy which
inhere in its proposals to emasculate the Wagner Act and to

 

 

adopt the extremely reactionary Case Bill, and other repres-_

sive legislation. Nor should‘, anyone treat lightly the menace
to democracy entailed in the forthcoming witchhunts and
purges in the civil services and public" offices now being pre-
pared by the G.O.P. Moreover, neither should anyone pass
over with indifference the G.O.P. program for granting un-
trammeled free rein to the “private enterprisers," including
its “economy” program for drastically cutting expenditures
for housing and social welfare, and for presenting tax rebates
16

 

K
to the-wealthy via the medium of a “general” 20 per cent or
perhaps 25 per cent income tax reduction.

Threats to World Peace

s Nor should anyone gloss over the reactionary signiﬁcance

of the threats to world peace contained in the G.O.P. pro-

posals to reduce still further and curtail loans, credits and re-
lief to the needy and war-devastated countries; of the G.O.P.
threats to devalue the franc, lire and pound and more openly
to follow an unbridled policy of dollar diplomhcy to expand
and “protect” American investments and trade. This pro-
jected_ foreign—economic program of . the G.O.P., a logical
counterpart to the Hoover—Vandenberg-Byrnes ‘.‘get tough
with Russia” policy, is bound even more grievously to impair
friendly and cooperative relations among the Big Three and
the other United Nations. Its effect will be to promote further
distrust and enmity toward. the U.S.A. abroad; to lose fortus
allies and good neighbors, including opportunities _for ex-
panding peaceful commerce and exchange.-

All these measures are boun to worsen the economic
position of the masses, by reducing their income and in-
creasing inﬂation, and to hasten the outbreak of the next
economic crisis. This process isalready to be seen in the
economic sabotage of the monopolies which restricts pro-r
duction and drives monopoly prices upwards, together with
the intensiﬁed offensive of the trusts upon the trade union
rights and economic standards of the masses which reduces
the people’s income and narrows the home market. It is to be
seen in the aggressive drive of the American imperialists for
world domination which threatens the peace and creates"‘an
unstable world situation, hampers the development of world
trade and restricts the opportunities of American commerce

inithe world markets. These factors are hasteningand accel-»

crating the maturing of the next cyclicalreconomic crisis. And
the likelihood islthat this crisis may break out—unless retarded
by a great economic and political counter-oﬁensive of -» the
masses of the people—in 1948, or maybe even during the last
half of .1947.
17

 

Big Struggles Ahead ,

The second main consequence of the November elections
will be the ushering in of a new wave of mass economic and
political struggles. The American working people, as indi-
cated especially by the C.I.O. national convention and by the
militant miners, will not tolerate, or acquiese to, the renewed
offensive of the trusts and to the new Hooverism of the G.O.P.
and the tory Democrats. They will not accept the increased
orgy of Big Business inﬂation and proﬁteering, of the G.O.P.
and tory Democrat policy of “boom and bust,” of increased
labor productivity and deﬂated living standards, of continued
indifference to housing for the veterans and the homeless, of
drastic restrictions on collective bargaining and trade union
rights, and of curtailment of the wartime gains and liberties
«of the Negro people. ’

The great, progressive labor movement, headed ‘by the
»C.I.O., as well as millions of A. F. of L. workers, who have evi-
denced a new militant ﬁghting spirit in two rounds of post-
war strike struggles, will resist the mounting attacks of Big
Capital and its G.O.P. generalship, and will develop its own
.counter-offensive. Millions of salaried and white-collared em-
ployees, as well as tens of thousands of civil servants, as evi-
«denced by the vigorous wage demands of the St. Paul and
Minneapolis teachers, will concert their just demands with
-organized labor to meet the spiralling cost of living which
now will be accentuated by the Taft-Byrd-Taber “economy”
-policies and employer greed. And, shortly, hundreds of thou-
-sands of small‘ farmers will once again appear on the political
.are‘na in mass action to cope with the G.O.P.-banker program
of scarcity and the impending drastic drop in farm prices
which will take place during 1947. /

Further, the prospects are that the continued worsening
economic position of the American people, coupled with the
colossal tax burdens of the government's armaments program,
as well as the continued aggressive, expansionist moves of the
.cartellists and of the State, War‘ and Navy Departments, will
now evoke greater mass resistance to the ever more reactionary

18

 

 

 

   

foreign policy of Vandenberg, Hoover and Byrnes. Confronted

' with a “tougher" G.O.P. foreign policy, larger sections of the

labor-progressive movement, as shown by the orientation of
the Conference of Progressives to be held in Washington i_n
January, will now grasp more fully the signiﬁcance of the
Wallace—Pepper position for peaceful international collabora-
tion, and can be won to struggle more eﬁectively for a pro-
Roosevelt peace policy based on the equality and friendly
cooperation of the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain.

T hirdly, it is clear that the impact of the Congressional
elections will accelerate the process of political realignment
already under way.

New Political Realignment-ts

As Wallace, Pepper and other liberal Democrats have indi-
cated, the serious setbacks suffered by the Democratic Party
will now impel and encourage many pro-Roosevelt forces to
regroup, organize and ﬁght for a pro-Roosevelt presidential
ticket and a progressive policy within the ranks of the Demo-
cratic_Party councils and organizations. It will enormously
accentuate the struggle between the Southern Bourbons and
the most reactionary Catholic Church dominated Northern
machines, on the one hand, and the progressively inclined
Democrats, on the other, forcontrol of the Democratic Party.
It will tend, too, to sharpen relations and partisan conﬂicts
between the Democrats and Republicans in and out of Con-
gress and to place in question and severely strain the bi-parti-
san conduct of foreign aﬁairs. '

Likewise, the outcome of the elections, which is beinghailed
and misinterpreted -by all the reactionaries, will embolden the
Hoover-McCormick-Taft wing of the Republican Party. It
will also inﬂuence the expansion of such pro-fascist groups and
activities as sponsored ‘by the American Action, Inc., and the
National Industrial Conference, as well. as the KKK and the
Columbians. a

Most important, the lessons of November 5—and particu-
larly the impact of the coming economic. and political strug-

gles, as well as the continued concessions of the Truman Ad-

19

 

 

  

ministration to the G.O.P. andiBourbon reaction—will give

a new impetus to- independent political action. These develop- '

ments are stimulating and will spur on such independent
labor-progressive political movements as P.A.C. and the
Chicago Conference of Progressives. They will also give rise
to more advanced political action by the Negro people, and
by certain veterans’ groups and farm organizations. And, not

least of all, they will further widen the sentiment in broader .

labor and progressive circles for forging a new, mass people’s
and democratic political alignment.

This is shown -by the post-election position being taken by
a number of independent citizens’ committees and movements,

was well as by the inﬂuential trend toward a “third party”
which has “been registered in the latest Roper poll. One thing ,

at least is clear: notwithstanding the various forms in which
the sentiment and the activities for independent labor-progres-
sive political action are now being expressed, the mass_move-
ment for such action and a new progressive political align-
ment is striking deeper roots and will expand.

-20

 

 

III. p Unity of Action For a
_ People’s Program

THE post-election outlook can thus be summed up: reaction
will grow, the struggle will sharpen and new "political
alignments will take place. ' = I

The most pressing question now is: what must be done to
check and defeat the arrogant and reactionary olfensive of
the proﬁteers, the economic royalists, the warmongers and
the pro-fascists, which has been abetted by the G.O.P. elec-
toral victory?

Clearly, the most decisive immediate task confronting all
progressive workers—non-Communists and Communists alike
—is to bring about the unity of action of the entire labor
movement in alliance with all anti-fascist and democratic
forces. It is to forge a broader and more militant 1abor-pro-
gressivedemocratic coalition which can rally all anti-monop-
oly and antidwar elements and groups, irrespective of political,
trade union and religious affiliations. It is to unite the demo-
cratic camp around a common program of struggle for jobs,
security and equal rights for all, for progress,democracy and
peace, ‘moving toward a new progressive political alignment
under labor leadership.

Toward this end, top priority must be given topachieve the
widest joint action of the C.I.0., A. F..of L. and Railroad
Brotherhoods everywhere at every level. I

Unity of Labor-or Else

No "anti-fascist can lightly dismiss the gains which reaction
has made and the price which the American people already
have had to pay for the division which exists in the trade

pt union movement. No progressive can ignore, for example, the

21

 

disruptive and dangerous role and inﬂuence of the A. F. of L.
ofﬁcialdom in the November elections, or the reactionary,
labor-splitting program mapped out by the recent A. F. of L.
convention.

, Therefore, every progressive worker and anti-fascist must
realize as never »before, that to check and defeat the growth
of reaction and -fascism, it is indispensable, not only to
strengthen the organizations and the unity of the C.I.O.,‘ but
also, as _a life-and-death matter, to break through the “iron,
curtain" now artiﬁcially separating the bulk of the A. F. of L.
membership from the C.I.O., and other progressiveforces.

This means that the single, most decisive problem now can-
fronting the llabor-progressive camp is to forge the broadest
unity of action of the C.I.O., A. F. of L. and Brotherhoods
around a common anti-monopoly and anti-fascist program of
struggle. More than anything else, such militant united labor
action can enable the working class to resist the attacks of
Big Capital, to play its leading role in national affairs ‘and
forge a mighty democratic coalition and a new, progressive
alignment.

That is why special and major consideration must be given
determinedly to promote the common action of labor around
one or several issues on a factory and community basis, as
well as on_a state scale and national level. Towards this end
it is necessary to arouse and alert all of labor and every pro-
gressive to the government-employer conspiracy against the
coal miners—a conspiracy which is abetted by the dictatorial
and irresponsible policies of john L. Lewis—but a conspiracy,
nonetheless, which menaces the wage demands, the unions, and
democratic rights of every worker in America. Therefore,
everything must "be done to compel the government‘ to grant
the miners" demands, to withdraw its injunction and contempt
proceedings. Everything must be _done to ‘bring together,
locally and nationally, the C.I.O., A. F. of L. and Railroad
Brotherhoods in active support of the miners and to guaran- .
tee that their just struggle will neither be crushed from with-
out nor betrayed from within.

22

United Action on Wages

At the same time, every effort must be made locally and at
every level to establish united labor action to support the
projected wage demands of the C.I.O., as well as wage‘ in-
creases for all workers and employees. These wage movements-,
and the forthcoming strike struggles, must be approached in
a new way, as a vital part of the current people's struggle
against monopoly reaction, inﬂation and proﬁteering. Further,
these wage demands and strike struggles must, at all costs, be
undertaken in a united fashion, as joint struggles of all of
labor, seeking collectively to solve, not a craft or an industry
grievance, -but a common, national prob1em—the problem not
only of wages, but of inﬂation and economic chaos.

Such _joint labor action on the wage issue should be com-
bined with the organization of joint labor-progressive com-
mittees and movements to oppose the adoption of repressive
labor legislation, the cutting of expenditures for social wel-
fare, federal, housing and- public works by" the G.O.P.-domi-
nated 80th Congress; as well as to initiate united A. F. of L.-
C.I.O.-R.R. action in the various states, especially now in
Massachusetts, Nebraska, Arizona and South Dakota, to cope

V with and to work for, the repeal and nulliﬁcation of the anti- .

labor legislation adopted in these states on November 5.

In this conjunction, nothing must «be left undone to in-
volve the organizations of the A. F. of L. in such movements
as the January Conference of Progressives, and in the various
community and state actions for rent control and an adequate

housing program, etc. Likewise, a. renewed, bold and sys—_

tematic effort must be made to involve the A. F. of L. member-
ship in solidarity and cooperation with the World Federation
of Trade Unions, the united progressive center of the world

trade union movement whichchamplons the security, progress
and peace of all working people.

V Strengthen Progressive Labor.
To facilitate these urgent tasks it is imperative that all

" progressive trade unionists, and especially the Communists,

23 , ,/

 

without further delay, make a basic change in their A. F. of L.
work, strengthen their base and inﬂuence within the A. F.
of L., encourage and support every progressive movement and
realignment in the A. F. of L., and consistently develop, every-
where, joint or parallel A. F. of L.-C.I.O. progressive action.

At the same time, it is of paramount and decisive impor-

tance that everything shall be done to strengthen the C.I.O.-

and its organizing drives; unitedly to prepare for and ensure
victory in the coming wage struggles in the steel, electrical,
auto, packing, etc., industries; to rebuff ﬁrmly and isolate the
Red-baiters and to consolidate the internal unity of the C.I.O.
around its generally progressive policies; to re-inforce the
working collaboration within C.I.O. between the Left wing
and the Center forces headed by Phil Murray as well as to sup-
plement this policy with systematic efforts to achieve a
broader combination of forces within the C.I.O. which will
actively support the progressive C.I.O. policies and objectives.

if‘ it SF

It is a life-and—death necessity for the wholeness and ﬁghting
effectiveness of the great C.I.O. and the whole labor movement
that the unreconstructed Red-baiters in this progressive trade
union center shall -be checked in their destructive attempts to
bring about “purges” in any of the C.I.O. bodies or otherwise
carry on such divisive activities in deﬁance of the will of the
recent convention which rebuffed the nefarious efforts of these
elements to split the organization on the “Red” issue.

So far, in dealing with the cardinal question of forging
united labor’s action and a broad people's coalition, we have

_ stressed primarily one central task, namely, the vital need of

achieving the maximum unity of struggle of all sections of
the trade union movement. But along with this, major atten-
tion must also be focused upon another key question: the
supremely important task of developing further and faster
the united front of Communist and non—Communist workers,
and of promoting everywhere the united action of the Com-
munist Party together with all other anti-fascist and people’s
organizations. '

United Front of Communists and
Non-Communist-s '

At present, there are a number of important national trade
unions in which the Communist and non-Communist -trade
unionists have established a working united front relationship.
These unions are characterized by their solid unity and healthy
internal situation, by their continued growth and the constant
improvement of the living conditions and welfare of their
membership, and by the progressive role which these unions
play in the political life of the communities and nation.

There are, of course, other unions, mostly A. F. of L., though
some within the C.I.O., where the Communist workers are
harassed and hounded, and olﬁcially excluded from holding
elective or appointive positions. The position of most of these
unions can be characterized somewhat as- follows: these unions
enjoy a minimum of trade uniop democracy; they are con-
stantly torn by internal strife and are easy victims of employer
pressure and intervention; they do not grow in periods of
“stormy weather,” or grow relatively slowly, and their wage
standards or working conditions generally fall below the levels
attained by the progressive-led unions. Moreover, these unions
usually stand aloof from the political struggles of the people
for their common welfare and national security; or if they do
enter the political arena it is invariably as the ‘‘labor’’ mouth-
piece for one or another of the politcal parties of Big Capital.

But this is only one aspect of the problem. Today there are
known Communists in many united front organizations and
movements who are respected as Communists, but who are
accepted therein solely because they happemofﬁcially to rep-
resent their trade union or fraternal organization.

So far as official relations between Communist and most
non-Communist groups are concerned, there are only a few

states and a score of cities in which the Communist Party par» «

ticipates ofﬁcially as an integral part of the various people’s
and democratic front alliances, such’ as in certain united front
activities and committees for progressive legislation, for peace,

25

and for the rights of the Negro people. But in every instance
where this condition prevails, there is a vigorous and effec-
tive, united, people’s democratic movement.

Then, too, there is the current and widespread situation in
which‘there, are scores, or rather hundreds, of unoﬂicial under-
standings and friendly relations between Communists and
various individual trade union and political leaders for pro-
moting progressive policies. These cooperative relationships
are generally fruitful and productive, though the off-the-
record form’ of this cooperation deﬁnitely impairs and cir-
cumscribes the effectiveness and the beneﬁts to be derived from
such collaboration.

Barring Communists Aids Reaction

It is high time, ‘and the interests of the labor-progressive
coalition require, that within the democratic framework of
the various people’s organizations, a closer and more friendly
every-day working relationship should -be cemented between
the individual Communist and non—Communist workers in
each factory and in their respectiye mass organizations. Equally
important is the urgent need of establishing and expanding
normal and harmonious public political relations between the
Communist Party and other labor and anti-fascist organiza-
tions in all labor-progressive coalitions and movements.

/This is necessary in order to strengthen the united militant /

action of labor and the people, to halt and counteract the
Red—baiting offensive of reaction, with its baneful effect upon
the entire people’s movement, and to protect and advance
democracy. ‘

Let there be no mistake about this: no trade union or

people’s organization, not even the great C.I.O., could long
remain progressive if it were toexclude or attack Communists.
No labor or democratic organization or activity can become
or remain broad or effective if.it excludes or villiﬁes any sec-
tion of the anti-fascist movement, particularly if it endeavors
to ostracize and conduct warfare against the Communists-
26

 

 

themost‘ consistent and staunchest ‘ﬁghters against reaction
and fascism. _ »

As American and world experience has demonstrated, any
working class or progressive organization, or united front
movement, that attempts to bar '-Communists from member-
ship or elective leadership, and embarks on a so-called anti-

5 a

Communist campaign, cannot really defend the interests of

the people, cannot effectively advance the cause of democracy"

and peace. Such organizations and coalitionsiinevitably nar-
row their base, retrogress and are doomed to become, ﬁrst the
victims, and eventually the prisoners and tools of the Red-
baiters, of reaction. ' ' .

.In order to promote the unityof action of Communists and
non-Communists, we Communists are called upon, among
other things, concretely. to answer the arguments advanced by
various progressively-inclined‘leaders and groups who, for one
or another reason, still oppose a united front with the Commu-
nists. ‘ . *

For instance, some liberal and trade union leaders allege
that, since we Communists stand for socialism, there cannot be
united action between us and those progressives who support
and believe in capitalism.

l .
This “argument,” of course, 1S clearly untenable. It is true ’

that we Communists believe in and strive to convince the ma-
jority of our fellow-workers of the need to seek a fundamental-.
a socialist—solution of our common economic, political and so-
cial problems, that is, to establish the social ownership of the
means of production.

We advance the socialist solution, not as an immediate t-ask
nor as an arbitrary “invention” of the American Marxists that

C proceeds from wishful thinking.  advance it, as the scientific

recognition of the course of socia progress. We understand
that the contradictory processes of capitalist development, by
their inherent insolubility, will bring ever wider masses into
motion to’ realize ultimately, on the basis of their own experi-
ences in struggle, and the vanguard role of the Communist
Party, the socialist way forward to the highest stage of democ-
racy and progress. .

Build a Democratic ‘Front
to Defeat Reaction Now and

BY

NEW CENTURY PUBLISHERS: N ew York

We advance the socialist solution, furthermore, in View of
the epochal demonstration of the qualitative superiority of the

socialist system in its domestic and world relations as achieved.

in and by the Soviet Union-—in peace and in war——to anarchic
and reactionary capitalism, with its recurrent crises and mass
unemployment, its cutthroat competition, its ravaging impe-
rialism, its world slaughters, and its “solutions” through fas-
cism or near-fascism. _

We are convinced, however, that the majority of those pro-
gressives who do not understand or believe in socialism can-
not, or will not, deny us Communists the right to advocate our
socialist views, that is, unless they are prepared to deny and re-
nounce all democratic liberties and processes.

For all who squarely face the lessons of current history it
should be clear that nowhere, on any continent of the globe,
have the forces of the people been successful in beating back
and decisively defeating the forces of fascism save through the
participation-—the full, free and influential participatz'on—of
the Communists. This recognition in country after country in
Europe was signalized during the national liberation war and

is attested to before our very eyes in the mass conﬁdence again

accorded the Communist parties in the recent elections and

referenda.
Nevertheless, we Communists are not proposing now, nor in

the immediate future, that the non-Communist majority of

our population should enter into a united front with us Com-
munists in order to “establish socialism.”

What we do propose, is that the non—Communist and
Communist workers and progressive alike, should join hands
now on a common immediate program of action against reac-
tion and fascism.

We do propose that the workers and their allies, irrespective
of union, race, religion and politcal afﬁliation, should forge a
democratic front and ﬁght in unison today and on the mor-
row. We do propose that a united front of Communists and
non-Communists should be established in order to increase
the consuming power of the masses, to protect the people from

' the ravages of inﬂation and of the oncoming economic crisis,

social progress.

to safeguardthe civil liberties of all the._peoples, Negro and
white, Jew and gentile, and, above all, to shackle the war-
mongers and to prevent fascism from gaining power in our
country. ~

Further, we Communists know and are conﬁdent that when
the issue of united labor and people’s action is squarely put
and based upon such a program of action, that then large sec-
tions of workers and progressives, subscribing to very divergent
political opinions and social outlook, will take the path of
anti-fascist and democratic unity to defeat monopoly reaction
and fascism in the present and maturing economic and politi-
cal struggles, and will also continue further along the road of

ii % =l=

In order to cement a wide, democratic, anti-monopoly.

c,oalitio_n,. under labor’s leadership, effectively to struggle
against reaction, far greater attention likewise needs to be
given to ‘bringing about a new and cooperative working rela-
tionship between the progressive labor movement and their
great ally, the Negro people, and especially with the city and
rural middle classes. At this moment, the key link to accom-
plish this alliance is for labor to provide a clear-cut answer
and practical leadership to solve the acute economic problems

‘now confronting the vast majority of the American. people.

Labor Must Lead

Up to date, the advanced workers, including the C63-

lmunists, have been fairly attentive to the burning issue of

wages, and have exercised initiative and leadership in ﬁghting
for wage increases. However, even here, we have been in many
cases extremely negligent in championing the pressing and
just wage demands of the A. F. of L. workers, of the Negro
workers dismissed from the war plants, and of the salaried-
employees in the professions, commerce and government.
Insofar as the issues of inﬂationary prices, rent control,

housing and taxes, as well as the burning issue of national ,

oppression and discrimination, are concerned, we have not yet,

29

,5-

with the exception of the wage movement, passed beyond the
stage of general agitation. We are sluggish in initiating timely
and appropriate mass actions around these issues as they affect
the housewives, the veterans, and the young women, and
Negro workers displaced from wartime industry, the masses
in the national groups, as well as the old age pensionnaires,
the tenants and small homeowners, and the working farmers.

Is it any wonder then, that important sections of these vital
sectors of the population fall prey to the anti-labor demagogy
of the “free enterprisers” and either become politically apa-
thetic or the victims of ‘G.O.P. reaction? Continued indiffer-
ence to these problems and to these natural allies of the
working class will narrow down and retard the movement
towards a new political alignment. It will restrict the struggle
for peace.’ And during the coming economic crisis, such re-
missness would enable the most reactionary trusts to divide
the Negro and white workers, and to create a fascist movement
with a mass base from among the veterans, the youth and the
impoverished farmers and city middle classes.

For a People’s Program

Clearly, our Party, as well as all anti-fascists, must rapidly
overcome this neglect and lethargy on these issues and fronts
of struggle. We must pioneer and exhibit maximum political
and organizing initiative, and help influence the progressive
labor movement systematically to ﬁght for a rounded-out
people’s economic and legislative program. We Communists
and labor as a whole must champion, not only a program of
action which will protect and advance the interests of all sec-
tions of the working class, organized and unorganized, but also
one which will safeguard the welfare and raise the living stand-
ards of the veterans and youth, of the Negro people, of the small
property owners and businessmen, and of the farm tenants,
the sharecroppers and the family-operating farmers.

In line with this necessity, and taking into account the valu-
able points of such a program which already has been ad-
vanced by the C.I.O., the Chicago Conference of Progressives,

30

 

 

D

the National Farmers Union, the Economic Bill of Rights .pro-
posed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, etc., we Communists propose
and urgently recommend that the labor-progressive camp
unitedly support and ﬁght for a democratic, a people's pro-
gram of immediate action which will include such vital meas-
ures as the following: i -

I O I

This immediate program of action is designed to protect and
advance the most urgent interests of labor and the common
people. It aims to safeguard the interests of the common peo-
ple now, against inﬂation, and during the coming economic
crisis. It serves the national welfare and the cause of world
peace. And the struggle to realize this program will also ad-
vance the basic aim of the working class—socialism.

But this program will come to naught unless the people,
and in the first place the_Communists and all other anti-fas-

_cists, ﬁght for it vigorously, consistently, skillfully, and above

all unitedly, in unison with all democratic forces, on the
legislative and economic fronts, and on every ﬁeld of political
struggle.

Implement This Program

Obviously, one of the most important battlefronts which
will decide the fate of this program is not only the current
and pending vital wage struggles, but also the important strug-
gles that will take place around the 80th Congress, as well as
in the various state legislatures. Hence, nothing less than maxi-
mum support must -be rendered to such united front progres-
sive movements as the signiﬁcant Conference of Progressives
which is scheduled to convene early next year in Washington.
Thus, too, a new, bold and many-sided approach must be
worked out in each city and state to promote joint labor and
progressive action around one or several vital congressional
or state legislative issues.

34

 

 

 

 

Therefore, too, unusual’ consideration must now be given
to prepare for the coming 200 municipal elections which will
take place in 1947, especially in such key centers as Detroit,
Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles. Determined efforts
must be made to defeat the candidates of reaction and to
bring about broad political coalitions in the various non-
partisan elections in support of a genuinely progressive mu-
nicipal ticket and program; and wherever possible, in the
partisan contests, to bring forward a new, representative and
democratic party alignment. 4 '

These struggles on the legislative and electoral fronts, im-
portant as they are, can be successful only if they are com-
bined with a great expansion of the people’s mass movement
against evictions, for rent control and a real housing con-
struction program, for extending the consumers’ mass boycott
of high-priced commodities, “with a determined struggle for
equal rights for the Negro people, and especially with the
mass organization and most skillful prosecution of 1abor's
wage struggles.

Combine Struggles

For instance, the legislative ﬁght for rent controls can suc-
ceed only if it is accompanied with the mass organization of
tens of thousands of tenants in the cities, on a neighborhood
and block basis. It can really register only if it is combined
with an extension of the veterans’ squatter movement, with
advancing the movement for lower rents and homes for the
Negro people, and with the development of comparable mass
action by veterans and‘ non-veterans alike, to help dramatize
and overcome the housing shortage.

Similarly, the‘ political legislative struggle against the’

mounting rise of food prices requires not only that a con-
certed effort shall -be made to bring the meat trust and dairy
industry under public regulation and ownership, but also
that the present spontaneous consumers’, buyers’ resistance

r movement shall be extensively organized in every block, ward

and community and given systematic, progressive direction.
35 l

  

Further, in respect to the impending crucial wage and
strike struggles, it is clear that most of these struggles will not

V be so “easy” as the earlier postwar strike movements. As sym-

bolized by the events in the Allis-Chalmers strike and in the

a current miners’ struggle~—a struggle which affects the welfare

and future of the entire labor movement—the employers, cor-
porations and government will increasingly resort to injunc-
tions, violence and terror in order to try and break the union,
and to prolong and defeat the just and equitable wage move-
ments of the workers who are determined to safeguard their
interests and ‘rights, -both today in the midst of inﬂation and
tomorrow in the midst of deﬂation and economic crisis.
Thus, as we have emphasized earlier, in the current and
forthcoming ‘bitter wage struggles the workers must bend
heaven and earth to consummate joint C.I.O., A. F. of L. and
R.R. action, locally and nationally. Likewise, organized labor

,must reinforce its wage movement with a stubborn endeavor

to reach and inﬂuence the working farmers and the middle
classes of city and town. They must do this in stream—lined
public relations’ activity, and above all, with timely initiative

' to champion the most pressing economic demands of the lower

  

middle classes, and especially in ‘behalf of the professional

 

and salaried employees in both private and government em- .

ployment. _

In this manner, and through the closest coordination of
labor’s mass economic struggles with the broadest united front
political-legislative activities—and_ with a determined struggle
against Red-baiting, Negro-baiting and anti-Semitism, and
for consolidating the unity of action of all workers and anti-
fascists, Negro and white—it will be possible to stem" and coun-
teract the offensive of Big Capital, and progressively to inﬂu-
ence the process and direction of ,political realignment which
is now taking‘ place. ‘

36

IV. Towards .1948

THE 1946 Congressional elections were hardly over before
most political spokesmen turned their eyes towards the
1948 presidential elections. This is only natural, For while
the November’ elections this year were crucial, the 1948 elec-
tions may be decisive in determining the course of the U.S.A.
in foreign and domestic affairs for generations to come. Be-
cause of this, we Communists consider that without any delay

‘the labor and progressive movements must also seriously con-

cern themselves with preparing for and helping determine the
outcome of 1948. “

There can be no doubt that the Republican victory of last
November furnishes the G.O.P. with certain electoral advan-
tages in preparing for the 1948 campaign. Undoubtedly the
G.,O.P. high command will utilize their strengthened con-

~ gressional positions and electoral advantages to the maximum.

And while advancing their reactionary policies, program and
candidates, they will also bring forward and utilize a num-
ber of pseudo-liberals, such as Warren and Stassen.

Divisions Among Independents

As far as the Democratic Party is concerned, it approaches
1948 in a weakened and disadvantageous position. It has lost
control of Congress. Not only is its status as a minority national
party further reduced, but its ranks are- demoralized and
divided and its ties with labor and the independent forces
are at the lowest ebb in decades. Moreover, the outcome of
the sharpening struggle between the Wallace-Pepper forces
who desire to make the Democratic Party progressive, and the
block of Southern Bourbons and the" Farley-Flynn-McHale
forces who favor and steer a reactionary path, is still very
much in doubt.

In respect to the independent voters, these forces now are
greatly divided. Many consider that it is possible and neces-_
sary to try and capture or salvage -the Democratic Party for

pro-Roosevelt aims and to effect by 1948 a replica of the old ~

Roosevelt-labor electoral coalition. Other sections of the inde-

‘pendent camp, and they, too, are inﬂuential, though now in a

distinct minority, believe that there is only one course open to
the progressives in 1948, namely not only to move ahead and
forge a new progressive partyalignment, but also to run an
independent, a third presidential ticket, at all costs.

What should be the general orientation of the 1abor-pro-
gressive camp for 1948? And what is the orientation of the
Communists?

For a Democratic Coalition

The main. objective of the labor-democratic camp in the
1948 elections must be to defeat the candidates and the pro-
gram of the reactionaries and pro-fascists. It must be to es-
tablish 'a democratic coalition and new political alignment
capable of electing a progressive, pro-Roosevelt presidential
ticket and Congress which will vigorously champion an anti-
monopoly and anti-war program, which will take bold steps
to grapple with the problems of jobs, security, democratic
rights, and peace.

The decisive question, of course, is how to achieve these

immediate and vital aims, how to promote these progressive

and anti-fascist objectives? V
Is it possible to guarantee a progressive victory in 1948 by

I relying exclusively upon the efforts of the pro-Roosevelt Demo-
»crats to_ try to “make the Democratic Party progressive”? This
- is not possible, even though the pro-Roosevelt forces may

acquire a dominant position in many Democratic organiza-
tions and delegations, and among" the mass of the electorate
who traditionally vote Democratic. The la-bor-progressive

‘forces could not and did not succeed, in ‘‘capturing’'' the

National Democratic Party urider Roosevelt, and they have
less chances of success today. ~ -

'‘Capture’’ the Democratic Party?

Thedominant, ruling circles of the Democratic_Party were
and remain capitalist and imperialist. It is true, of course,
that the outcome of the November. Congressional elections
has undermined the power of the old Democratic machines in
the main industrial centers. But it is also a fact, as'we have
noted, that these elections have temporarily weakened the
electoral strength of the pro-labor, pro-Roosevelt wing of the
Democratic Party. Conversely, the positions and power of
the Southern Bourbons in the leading councils of the Demo-

cratic Party and in the national Administration itself, has

been momentarily strengthened.

Of course, while the outlook for “capturing control of the
major Democratic Party organization” is far removed, this

does not exclude the possibility that the Wallace-Pepper.‘

Democrats and the independent labor-progressive forces may

. not yet succeed in bringing great pressure to bear upon and

in inﬂuencing the outcome of the 1948 Democratic national
convention. In fact, labor and the progressives must encour-

age and assist the'pro—Roosevelt Democrats in organizing to‘

effect a progressive political regrouping within the Demo-
cratic Party, to organize progressive blocs in Congress and the
legislatures, to win all preferential Democratic presidential
primaries for a pro-Roosevelt candidate and for electing pro-
Roosevelt county, state and national delegates and com-
mitteemen. This task is of unusual and extreme importance
and must receive thejmaximum and most active consideration
of all progressive forces.-

But vital and signiﬁcant as this may be,’ the 1a'bor-progres-
sive majority cannot attain their main objectives in 1948 un-
less the ‘struggle of the pro-Roosevelt Democrats to secure
hegemony in their party is not only resolutely developed and
greatly expanded but also, and, above all, unless it is coordi-
nated with the popular mass movement for effecting a new,
broad party alignment in state after state as quickly as con-
ditions permit. '

Trends for a New Party

While, at present, only a minority of the progressive forces
understand the need of forming, and are working to achieve,
a new, people’s democratic party coalition prior to the com-
ing presidential elections, nonetheless it is true that the trend
for a new progressive party alignment is growing. _

According to a Roper poll in the November issue of

Fortune, 19.4» per cent of A. F. of L. workers and 28.4 per cent
of C.I.O. workers, queried some two months before the elec-
tions, favored the formation of a new independent mass party.
As a result of the recent congressional elections, this sentiment
and trend is increasing, as is evidenced by the advanced politi-
cal thinking of large sections of the Negro people, as well as
by the progressive viewpoints recently expressed by James
Patton, President of the National Farmers Union, and Bartley
Crum, the California campaign manager of Wendell Willkie.
Even certain C.I.O. and P.A.C. leaders, like Jack Kroll, who
heretofore have expressed opposition in principle to the
eventual formation of a third party, are now modifying their
stand. They are urging not only the extension of 1abor’s inde-
pendent political action, as -before, but state that time and
conditions alone will determine whether this development
should proceed along the lines of the .1944 elections or take
a new course, the course of an entirely new strategy and align-
ment. .
It is essential to understand that the future of labor and
progress requires an immediate and gigantic expansion of in-
dependent 1abor-progressive—democratic political action, espe-
cially the promotion of a mass movement directed towards
establishing a broad, people’s, anti—monopoly party alignment.
Both the immediate and the long—range interests of the work-
ers and common people—require that labor, together with all
progressives, with all anti-fascists and anti-imperialists, orient
upon forging a new, all-inclusive progressive and democratic
party alignment. ‘

This is required to ensure a democratic victory in the 1948

40-

\

elections, and to hasten the historic process now under way of
separating the American working class from the ideological
inﬂuence and political tutelage of the major parties of capi-
talism—Repuvblican and Democrat alike—and thereby to en-
able labor, in unison -with its progressive allies, to exercise
not only a key, but also the leading role in national affairs.
What must -be done to achieve this, to advance the move-
ment for an independent, political alignment, for a new,
united peoples’ party and a democratic coalition, embracing pp
all anti—fascists, which is so decisive to determine the ﬁnal out- it
come of 1948? 

What Must Be Done

First, it is imperative simultaneously to promote and coordi— ., 41;;
nate the activity of the pro-Roosevelt adherents operating ,1
within the Democratic Party with the independent political "
activity and organizations of the labor and progressive forces,
who are working outside of the Democratic Party. It is essen- i :,
tial to combine the activity of the pro-Roosevelt forces with p
those who are moving in the direction of establishing—as soon - H
e as the -prerequisites exist—a new, progressive, coalition party, 
f irrespective of whether they ﬁnd it necessary and advisable to
run an independent presidential ticket in 1948.

Secondly, it must be said that it is not the existing mani-
fold legal and technical difficulties which prevent the forma-
tion of a “third party” in the various states or nationally. ,
 These legal and technical difficulties are not insurmountable,
 especially if tackled in time and with broad mass support. _
‘ The main obstacle standing in the way of launching a new  “E

people’s and democratic party is not technical; it is political. . yr,

It is the absence of a broad base and of a wide and well or-
ganized democratic coalition alone which holds back the

. crystallization of a new progressive party alignment. I p A
To alter this situation, to advance a new, democratic coali- c fgﬂ

tion and a united front, people’s party alignment, inclusive  

of the Communists and all other anti—fascists, and based on ; ti

the trade unions and other people’s organizations, and under ‘

.4 1

 

 

 

labor’s political inﬂuence, it is essential a) that labor and -the
progressives continue to‘ organize independently along the
lines of PAC and NCPAC, etc., and steer an independent

political course; b) that the people, not only unmask the

treachery and demogogy of the G.O.P.,‘ but also “systematically
criticize and expose the betrayals and vacillations of the Tru-
man Administration and the national Democratic Party. They
must utilize these facts and ‘events to inﬂuence‘ scores of unions
and millions of working people to seek an independent politi-
cal solution, a united people’s and democratic way out of in-
ﬂation, the coming economic crisis and the existing threats to
the future peace of the world. They must work in such a way
as to overcome the current dilemma in which the progressives
have as yet no serious alternative for 1948 to the present reac-
tionary national leaderships of the Democratic and Republican
parties; ﬁnally, c) the progressives must move heaven and earth
to create a united, progressive front, of a coalition party of la-
bor, the Negro people, the working farmers, the small business-

omen, and of all pro-Roosevelt forces.

They must establish a new, progressive party alignment and
an electoral machinery so as to guarantee that a new, mass,
democratic, people’s party can be placed on theballot in at least

 

several dozens of states. In terms of “political expediency”

alone, this must be done prior to the major party conventions
in 1948, in time to inﬂuence the Democratic national con-
vention and to secure in time a necessary alternative in the
event that all efforts of the Wallace-Pepper forces to shape
the outcome of the Democratic national convention" do not
succeed.

19479 and 1948

, Whatever we may conclude concerning the probable pros-
pects for the formation of a national democratic realignment,
in time to play a key role in the 1948 elections, no headway
can ‘be made to realize the main objectives of the people and
the democratic forces in 1948, and to enhance la'bor’s political

positions and inﬂuence, unless in the coming year the move- 8

42  

 

 

ment for a new progressive- realignment assumes mass pro-
portions in the various states, -and is resolutely cultivated and
fostered. But in doing this it will also be necessary determin-
edly to avoid all sectarian and‘ premature organizational
moves, especially the divisive and reactionary so-called third
party ventures now being projected by the Liberal Party, the
Socialists and the Trotskyites. » _

Conversely, the signiﬁcant job of organizing and activating
the pro-Roosevelt forces in the Democratic Party cannot‘ be
formidably advanced unless the progressive forces outside of
this party, independently organize, encourage and aid» such
developments. - ‘ '

In conclusion, it must be recognized that no serious advances
can be made in furthering labor-progressive-democratic inde-
pendent political action and activity, or in crystallizing the

 .;....‘_T_2_—_'.-2"i%; ;&§m.a?'f;.7TAA »- — »

pro-Roosevelt forces within the Democratic Party, unless these"

moves and tactics are viewed and pursued as two inseparable
arms of one coordinated mass movement and central objective.

Finally, to harness and direct both_ trends and progressive
activity, it is imperative to eﬁect a bridge and close working
relationship between the advocates of a third, of a new people’s

L and progressive party, and between the supporters of PAC and

the Wallace-Pepper adherents within the Democratic Party.

To do this requires that the most advanced workers clearly.

project and raise before the labor-progressive-democratic camp
a central objective for 1948: namely, the need of forging a
broad, democratic coalition ‘and of electing in 1948 a progres—
sive presidential. ticket and Congress, committed to an anti-
monopoly and progressive, people’s program, and steering a
course and taking in time all measures necessary to guarantee
the realization of this aim.

V. The Struggle For Peace

NOW a few words on the struggle for peace. As is well
known, there now exists two main trends in interna-
tional affairs. One trend is expressed in the position of the
U.S.S.R. and the new European democracies who are striving
for a_ just and stable peace, who are promoting the equality
and sovereignty of all nations, great and small. The other
trend is reﬂected in the position of the Anglo-American
powers who are following an aggressive and bellicose policy,
who are striving to saddle the peoples with an imperialist
peace and seek to impose their will upon the entire world.

These opposite trends naturally ﬁnd their counterpart in
the United Nations and elsewhere. For instance, the Soviet
delegation again submits a decisive proposal to safeguard
the peace: namely, to effect an immediate, general reduction
of all armaments, including the outlawing of the use, manu-
facture and stockpiling of atomic weapons.

Other delegations, of Anglo—Saxon vintage, express pious
approval of the general idea, and then make counter-moves
to scuttle the proposal through various amendments and
reservations, most of which are calculated attacks on the
“veto” power ofpthe Big Five. Their aim in this is to curtail
or abolish the principle of the unanimity of the Great Powers
and to place the Security Council at the mercy of the. Anglo-
American imperialist bloc.

Another Soviet delegate proposes to implement the charter
of the U.N. so as to -carry out the U.N. trustee obligations
covering colonial, dependent, and mandated countries. How-
ever, other delegates, allied with the Anglo—American bloc,
concur with the “general objective,” ‘but propose instead that
the Anglo-American powers, or‘ their satellites, now adminis-
tering the ex-enemy colonial and dependent territories and
the conquered islands and bases, should unilaterally execute

44

x

 

exam 22-... -45» vi.

 

 

the U.N. trusteeships and should ‘maintain sole control and
absolute military authority over these territories and bases,
irrespective of the Security ‘Council. .
Another U.N. delegation proposes ‘to quarantine Franco
fascism, while certain Western delegations then hasten to
condemn Franco in words, but in deeds work to block any
“interference” in the internal affairs, not of China for Indo-

nesia, but of fascist Spain and Greece.

U. S. Imperialists Emboldened

 

It is clear, as we have already indicated, that the November"

5 G.O.P. electoral victory will tend to reinforce the so-called
Anglo—Saxon trend. It will, in fact, embolden the American
monopolists in their drive. towards world domination. At
the same time, it will also tend to sharpen tremendously all

Anglo-American contradictions and will stimulate a realign-‘

ment of forces among some of the governments now support-
ing the American-British axis.

But it is equally clear that the ﬁrst trend, the strivings of
the peoples to achieve a long-term peace, to wipe out the
remnants of fascism, to rout the forces of international reac-
tion who are plotting a new world war, and to determine
their own destinies without reactionary interference in their
internal affairs—\—that this trend continues to grow in strength.

Fortunately for the world, as we signalized earlier, there
have been other national elections than those in the U.S.A. on

November 5. Fortunately there were the highly signiﬁcant

elections in France, Italy, Bulgaria, and Rumania, in which
the peoples, the anti-fascist forces, .led by the Communists,
won great democratic victories. _ ‘

Then, too, the growing opposition in the British T.U.C.
and within the Labor Party and its representatives in Parlia-
ment, to the Tory foreign policy of Bevin and Attlee, coupled

with the important stand of the Wallace-Pepper forces and

the Chicago Conference of Progressives, are new develop-

ments. which also strengthen the people’s ﬁght for peace.
Therefore, while the imperialist policies of the G.O.P. and

the Administration will continue to complicate international

‘*45

relations, and will create constant difficulties in the way of
furthering constructive peace settlements—there are other and
very powerful forces at work. 4

It is not excluded that the near future may witness certain
compromises, though positive adjustments in the relations be-
tween the U.S.A.‘, the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain,_favorab1e to
the cause of peace. Such a possibility is indicated by the fact
that the current sessions of the Foreign Ministers’ Conference
-inﬂuenced in part by the favorable factors mentioned above
—have made some progress in resolving some of ‘the issues which
divided the Big Four in Paris. Such a possibility is likewise
evidenced by the limited, though ‘important progress which

has been registered in some of the decisions of theGenera1 _

Assembly of the United Nations.

' G.O.'P.-Big Business Control Menaces Peace

But this out1ook—as well as the fact that the danger of a
new world war is not imminent at present—-does not negate the
many threats to the future of world peace which now exist. It
does not negate the circumstances in which the future of
world peace is daily menaced by the fact that the control of
the atomic bomb is now in the sole custody of the U.S.A.,
that is, that the productiofl and possible use of atomic weapons
remains the private aﬁair, and under the monopoly control,
of the military and the warmongering trusts and cartellists,
the du _Ponts, General Electric and Westinghouse. ,

Nor does. the fact that the danger of another world war
does not exist at the present moment in any way belittle
the present war dangers inherent in the reactionary war-
making interference of the U.S.A. in China; of the U.S.A. and
Britain in the Near East; and of American-British “non-
interference” in Greece and Spain. Nor does it minimize the
dangers to peace ﬂowing from the imperialist policy of the
U.S. and Britain in rebuilding the cartellists and militarists
in Germany and Japan. Least of all does it signify that preda-
tory American capitalism, which greatly multiplied its pro-
ductive capacity and greatly centralized its monopoly power
during the war, is going to “abandon” its ruthless quest for

. 46 '

 

 

new markets, spheres of inﬂuence and opportunities for

a capital investments. .

Therefore, it is clear that the possi-bilities for securing a
long-terrn peace require, among other things, and insofar as
we Americans are concerned, that everything be done to place

the warmongers in a strait-jacket, to defeat the reactionary.

foreign and domestic policy of the trusts and their G.O.P. and

‘Tory Democrat representatives, and rapidly to forge a broader

labor-progressive peace alignment, and a powerful, democratic,
anti-monopoly coalition.

Reaﬂirm July iPlenum

To advance the struggle for peace and for a progressive
American foreign policy, we Communists reaﬂirm the program
of action outlined at our July Plenum. We especially under-

score the imperative need of rallying all peace-loving Ameri- - \

cans in a concerted effort to promote the Roosevelt policy of
Big Three unity and the establishment of close and friendly
relations between the U..S.A. and the Soviet Union; to speed
up the fulﬁllment of the Potsdam agreements on Germany
and Japan; to reverse America’s suicidal policy of instigating
and supporting the pro-fascist Kuomintang and the disastrous
civil war which it has launched against the Yenan Administra-
tion and Chinese democracy; to reverse the dangerous Ameri-
can policy of hostility to the new European democracies and
their people's governments; to mobilize maximum pressure to
end United States diplomatic and economic relations with
Franco—Spain, and to render the fullest aid to the heroic
Spaniards ﬁghting for their freedom; to exercise systematic
pressure to aid the Puerto Rican people and to guarantee their
right to full national independence, and to render fraternal
assistance to all the Latin American democracies against the
encroachments of Yankee imperialism.

The urgency of these tasks has not diminished. They must
be carried out with renewed vigor and determination. ‘

However, at this time, it is necessary to supplement the
points raised in our July meeting and "to place additional
stress on two questions which are basic if we are to succeed in.

developing the peace movement on a wider and more power-
ful scale. , -
Link Home- and Foreign Policy

In orderto give the movement for peace a real “shot—in-the-
arm,” and to draw into it additional millions ‘of progressive-

' minded Americans, it is essential that the struggle for peace

shall be linked and closely coordinated with the mass move-
ment for the most pressing economic and democratic demands
of the people. The aggressive designs against the democratic

 

peoples‘ abroad must be shown as inter-connected with the‘

aggression against the people’s democratic forces at home.
.T his requires, ﬁrst of all, that the most consistent ﬁghters
for peace now place far greaterlemphasis on the issues of
disarmament and demilitarization, especially on the need for
prohibiting the manufacture, stockpiling and use of the atomic
bomb, and for stopping the inauguration of universal military
conscription. They must’ demand a drastic curtailment of the
military budget as a means of curbing the military adventurers
and ‘the armament makers, as well as for lessening the tax
burden on the people. The progressive advocates of peace must
vigorously oppose the efforts of the trusts to militarize America
and to extend our armed -bases and beachheads everywhere in
the globe. They must do this if the American. people are to
receive butter andibread instead of guns and atom bombs,
and if we are to put a bridle on the most rampant advocates
of an American century of Wall Street imperialist expansion

\ and catastrophe. .
Secondly, to ﬁght most effectively for peace, we Communists A

and other militant anti-fascists must deﬁnitely orient upon
broadening the peace movement ‘by making common cause
with all democratic and anti-war individuals and group-s who,
for one or another reason, are opposed to one or many aspects
of the foreign policy of the trusts, the G.O.P. and the Admin-
istration. All sectarian attitudes toward those anti-war elements
who have not yet fully, or formally, broken with the Truman
Adminisration, or who are still opposed to a new, people's
democratic mass party, such as‘ Wallace and his pro-Roosevelt
adherents, must be fought against including such negative

48  

 

 

 

attitudes as those expressed toward Wallace's Madison Square
Garden speech, which even found reﬂection in the Daily
Worker.

The adherents of peace are legion. These forces must be
united, given a sound lead, and swung into action. And their
differencesover other issues must not be allowed to divide
them on the aim which they hold in common——the promotion
of our own national security and the cause of world peace.

"Bipartisan” Policy

Furthermore, to advance the struggle for peace, it is like-
wise necessary that the advanced workers cut through the
heavy and mysterious fog of “bi-partisanship” which now
surrounds our foreign policy. It is true, of course, that the
administration’s reactionary foreign policy was and is bi-

partisan, a policy subscribed to by the ofﬁcial and top leader-,

ship of both the Republican and Democratic Parties. But it
does not follow that this bipartisan policy is also a national
policy in the sense that it represents the national will and in-
terests of the American people.

The facts are that our present bipartisan policy is a Hoover» .

Vandenberg and Tory Democrat policy; it is the antithesis of
the Roosevelt foreign policy of Big Three unity for which
the majority of the American people voted in 1944. The facts
are that our bipartisan foreign policy is a rabidly imperialist
policy. It represents the viewpoint of the monopolies and
their reactionary high command in both the G.O.P. and the
Democratic Party. It ignores and violates the pro-American
position on foreign affairs taken -by Wallace and Pepper,
Aiken and Crum, the C.I.O. and the Chicago Conference of
Progressives an_d by all anti-fascist patriots.

What progressive America needs and longs for is a truly
independent, national policy——a policy which will strengthen.
the democratic unity-of the United States and the United
Nations. What progressive America requires and desires is a
foreign policy which will steadfastly promote the national
interests and security of the American people, will quarantine
the armament-makers and all warrnongers, and will secure
peace for America in a peaceful, anti-fascist world.

VI. The Menace of Red-Baiting

DURING the recent period an unprecedented and danger-
ous Red-baiting drive has been developed throughout
the nation. Under the guise of combatting “Communism,”
the reactionaries used Red-baiting as a major political weapon
to confuse sections of the electorate and to attain victory in
the election campaign. They are now redou-blilng their so-
called anti-Communist barrage so as to paralyze the ability
of the labor and progressive movements to meet the sharpening
offensive of monopoly reaction and the coming economic
CI‘lS1S.

This Red-baiting offensive is not so much a sign of strength,
as it is a symptom of serious weaknesses and despera-
tion on the part of the trusts. It indicates that American
monopoly capitalism, torn by internal economic and social
contradictions and operating in a new world setting which in

’ many sections of the globe restricts its power and expansion,

is confronted with mounting difficulties.

For one thing, the monopolies are increasingly losing their
ideological-political grip on broad sections of the American
working class. In comparison with the period immediately fol-
lowing World War I, they enter this postwar period confronted
with a more militant working class, a stronger and more pro-
gressive labor movement, a united, more powerful and mature
Communist Party, and a broader, more advanced labor-pro-
gressive coalition. Thus the monopolies are intensifying their
Red-baiting attacks in the hope of dividing the labor-progres-
sive coalition and of isolating and undermining the militant
trade unions and the ‘Communist Party.

However, no one should minimize the dangers involved in‘
the current witch-hunt and Red “purge.” This bigoted drive
against democratic liberties and “dangerous thoughts," this

divisive anti-American campaign, is sparked and supported by
a ‘formidable combination of diverse groups and organizations.

Behind the Red-Baiting Oﬁensive

Dishonorable leadership in this treacherous undertaking is
shared by the Hoover-McCormick-Dewey Republicans and
the.Bilbo—Rankin-Wheeler Democrats; by American Action,
Inc., a renovated pro-fascist offspring of the notorious America
First and American Li-berty League outﬁts; by the anti-labor,
fascist-minded cliques at the head of the N.A.M. and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce; by the clerical fascists in the Catholic
hierarchy; by the warmongering, anti-Soviet exabrass hats in
the American Legion and the V.F.W.; by the head of the
American Gestapo, J. Edgar Hoover; by the pro~K.K.K. Texas
bigot, Attorney General Tom -Clark; and by that un-American

monstrosity, the V/Vood-Rankin-Parnell Thomas Committee. _

An evil part in this Red-baiting crusade is also played by
the imperialist-minded, “free enterprise” bureaucrats dominat-
ing the A. F. of L.; by the disruptive Rieve-McDonald-Carey
clique in the C.I.O., as well as by the Trotskyites and the
reactionary Social-Democrats.

While there is a division of labor among these Red-baiters,
and while the purveyors of “anti-Communism” are varied
and numerous, and while even certain honest, but confused,
progressives have -become the victims and unwilling" dupes of
the Red-baiters—it is clear that Red—baiting stems from one
main source and has one central objective: The fountain-head
and chief instigators of Red-baiting are the .fascist-minded
monopolies. The prime objective of Red-baiting is to divide,
disorient, and wreck the labor and progressive camp so as to
promote the aims of the most predatory economic royalists
who seek to drag the nation into fascism and imperialist
adventures abroad.

These central facts must never be lost sight of in the midst
of the day-to—day struggles while combatting the many-sided
facets, attacks and diversions of the Red-baiters and their
galaxy of spokesmen. These central facts must be driven home

51

'.;.  ,. -~,.. . \. . . ..4 .  . . . ..  ’3’:,,:. .,:.;;L .‘“;:"f. I.‘“‘. 3f,'_'." “ ;.1 Z A ~ . _

 

quickly, to all of labor, to all progressives, to all advocates of
peace. And these central facts must -be explained in the light
of contemporary American and world experience.

Rebuff the Red-Baiters

To meet most effectively the drive of the Red-baiters, greater
attention should also be given to the following: ’

First, the most militant and advanced workers and progres-
sives, Communist and non-Communist, must organize to take
the counter-offensive against Red-baiting on every front, par-
ticularly within the trade union and independent political
action movements. It is on these fronts, least of all, that any
advantage or quarter can be given to the Red-baiters.

For instance, the current anti-Communist drive within the
C.I.O. must be unmasked and combatted for what it is: an
employer conspiracy to split the C.I.O. The Red-baiting charge
that the Communist Party is seeking to impose a “foreign
ideology” on the C.I.O. and allegedly seeks to intervene in
the internal affairs of the C.I.O. in an attempt to dominate
it, must be shown for what it is: namely, that through the
device of Red-baiting the corporations, their press and stooges
are actually intervening in the internal life of the C.I.O.

‘The trusts are injecting company-inspired division and
strife into the C.I.O. and are seeking to pit worker against
worker. They thereby seek to nullify one of the cardinal
principles upon which the C.I.O. was ‘built and made progress:
i.e.,“*the right of all workers, irrespective of race, color, religion
or political afﬁliation, to join the C.I.O. and enjoy equal
rights and opportunities to serve the C.I.O. and advance its
program... By falsely raising the "issue of -Communism as an
ideological “difference” within the C.I.O., the employers in
reality are endeavoring to divide the workers and are really
promoting an alien ideology within the unions, the class
ideology of the N.A.M., of U.S. Steel and the du Ponts.

Secondly, for effective struggle against Red-baiting an end
must be put to the paralysis, cowardice and short-sightedness

52

 

 

,,,-.:v. «.»- :v2-:.~:.- e  ~. 

 ‘-p-3,

 

which still afflicts many progressive leaders. The entire labor-
progressive camp should be made to realize that just as a threat
to peace in any quarter of the globe jeopardizes the cause of
world peace, sp, too, an ,,attack by the Red-baiters on any
progressive leader or organization equally endangers the
security and welfare of all labor and progressive organizations
and movements. Just aspit is essential to achieve collective
security to quarantine aggressors and warmakers, so, too, it is
imperative to weld the concerted action of labor and all anti-
fascists to defeat the Red-baiters, the reactionaries and pro-
fascist monopolies who seek to divide the forces ﬁghting for
peace and the people’s welfare.

Thirdly, while it is true, of course, that it is labor, demo-
cratic liberties and peace which are the main targets of the
current Red-baiting attacks, no one should minimize the fact

that the "Red-baiters are ‘at the same time deﬁnitely out to .

destroy the Communist Party.

What Communists Stand For

We Communists, for instance, would be politically blind
if we were to. close our eyes to the present drive to adopt
repressive anti-Communist legislation, nationally and in the
states. We would be criminally careless if we failed to take all
necessary precautions to protect our membership and organ-
ization. We and our progressive allies would be grossly derelict
in our common duty if we failed to develop now a broad,
united -front mass movement to combat the G.O.P.’s Hoover-
inspired congressional inquisitions and witch-hunts of all
progressiyes, to defend the rights of the Communists and
thus the rights of all anti-fascists and progressives.

Finally, while the struggle against Red-baiting is the com-
mon responsibility of all workers and democrats, non-Com-
munist as well as Communist, we Communists do have a
special obligation which no other labor or progressive organ-
ization can fulﬁll. We have the special duty to expose every
lie about the Communists and Marxism. We are called upon
to unmask. every villiﬁcation and misrepresentation of our

53

philosophy, principles and activity and ‘to make clear‘ to

millions who we are and what we stand for. :

5‘ We must defend and explain our science, the working class
science of Marxism-Lenini_sm. We must demonstrate that our
interests are the welfare and social progress of the American
working class and people, and of all freedom-loving peoples.

We must show, too, the harmony and mutual interconnec-.

tion "between our proletarian internationalism and our love‘ .
for and defense of the genuine n_ational interests of our _
' country. i ’ ‘

This is a special responsibility which only we Communists

‘can carry out. To the extent that we do this skillfully and in
a principled way, we will deliver a powerful -blow against the
—Red-baiters and trusts; we will strengthen the ties and united

action between Communists and non-Communists; and we‘will
also strengthen our own ranks and,our mass inﬂuence.

VII. The Party

IN CONCLUSION, it would be useful brieﬂy to evaluate
in -broad outline some aspects of our work since the last
meeting of our National Committee in July.

On the positive side of the ledger stands the struggle waged
by most of the Party for our correct policy and tactical line in
the elections, especially during the last stage of the election
campaign. With all our shortcomings, our ‘Party, in most dis-
tricts, helped to clarify the central issues of peace, security and
democracy, and generally strove to effect a broad labor-pro-
gressive coalition, in cooperation with the pro-Roosevelt Dem-
ocrats, to defeat the candidates of reaction. iWe helped pro—
mote whatever progressive unity was achieved in the course
of the elections and simultaneously developed a vigorous and
fairly successful campaign for most of the candidates of our
Party. '

Then, too, there were the great economic struggles in the
maritime industry, of both A. F. of L. and C.I.O. workers, as
well as the highly important local strikes in auto, in which we
Communists played. a constructive and leading role.

In the ﬁght for equal rights for the Negro people, and espe«
cially in the protest movement against the Georgia lynchings,

' our Party not only came forward itself, but also helped to de- _

velop a series of signiﬁcant united front mass activities.

In the struggle for peace, we continued to display consider-
able initiative on many questions and made some headway.
This is particularly true of the mass work of a number of
the West Coast districts in advancing the popular, anti-impe-
rialist movement against the reactionary intervention of the
U.S. in China’s internal affairs, and for withdrawing American
troops and economic-military aid from the reactionary Kuo-
mmtang.

Lastly, the positive activity of our Party since July has been
marked by a resolute and fairly effective struggle of the Com-
munists in the progressive-labor movement to check the Red-
baiters, and to consolidate and strengthen the unity of the
C.I.O. around a generally militant and progressive program.

Party Advances ’ . 

In estimating the work of the Party, mention also should be
made of the fact that the progress and increased activities of
our Party have been achieved under -quite difficult conditions.
For instance, the resurgent Red-baiting drive inside and out-
side of the labor and democratic movement has left its mark.
New obstacles have been placed in the way of the normal func-
tioning and growth of our. Party, as well as in the way of
cementing our cooperative relations with other labor and
progressive organizations.

Moreover, in several Party districts, such as in New York

and California, the headway we have made in the recent ,

period has been accomplished in certain Party sections under
conditions of internal disruption and sabotage——under condi-
tions in which the policy and unity of our Party. have been
provocatively challenged and distorted by a nest of anti-Party
conspirators.

Theseanti-Party elements, garbed in Leftist and pseudo-
revolutionary clothes, and grouped around Sam Darcy, Lyle
Dowling, Bill Dunne, and Charles Keith, while few in num-
ber, could cause considerable damage if they were not fought
‘uncompromisingly, and if their nationwide conspiracy was not
exposed and smashed.

Comrade Weiss, in his extended remarks, will analyze the
anti-Marxist roots and position of this anti-Party cabal. I wish
here merely to emphasize two things: Firstly, the Party must

‘ be on guard to ferret out these conspirators, must intensify

its political-ideological struggle against them and against all

other alien inﬂuences and elements, and it must combine this

struggle—a struggle against semi-Trotskyist, “Left"—adventur-

ism and disruption-—with .a sharper ﬁght against all remnants

of Browder revisionism and Right opportunism.

Secondly, it is necessary to warn against .certain weaknesses
and mistakes which currently are being made in the struggle
against these anti-Party elements. For example, since the July
Plenum it has been necesary and mandatory, for reasons of
safeguarding Party unity, principles, and security, to expel a
number of individuals in the California, New York, and
Connecticut districts, most of whom are involved in the na-
tionwide, anti-Party conspiracy headed by Darcy, Dowling
and Dunne. All of these expulsions,were imperative, and many
were overdue; and all of the measures taken to protect the
Party, its program and discipline were essential. Yet, it is also
a fact that most of these expulsions, these disciplinary actions,
were not preceded by a systematic political-ideological cam-
paign, were handled, in most instances, ﬁrst by organizational
measures, and only afterwards with a political campaign.

We consider that the procedure should and must be re-
versed. ‘An uncompromising struggle must be waged against
all Right opportunist and “Left” sectarian deviations and prac-
tices, whatever their source; but at the same time, While mov-
ing energetically and in time against all known anti-Party ele-
ments, a firm and a patient effort must be made to retain within
the Party all honest Party members who may be temporarily in-
ﬂuenced either by Right or “Left” deviations, so as to help
them overcome their mistakes and weaknesses. In most
cases, disciplinary action should not precede a politica1-ideo-
logical campaign; it should rather follow after a stubborn
endeavor is made to rectify the individual’s mistakes and after
a serious political campaign has been waged to expose and
isolate the die—hard violators of Party policy and discipline,
and after steps have been taken to unmask their tie-up with
other anti-Party groups.

‘ Some Shortcomings
It is obvious, therefore, that our Party has been operating
under great difficulties but has made advances, in spite of
them. But these difficulties must not blind us to the following:

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Eugene Dennis, the author of this pamphlet, was elected
General Secretary of the Communist Party at the plenary meet-
ing of its National Committee, held in New York, July, 1946.
Of Irish extraction, he has been Communist for 20 years, and
has served as a member of the" Party’s National Committee
since 1936. _ ‘

Before he came to the National Oﬂice he headed the Wis-
consin State Committee of the Communist Party for several
years, where his great ability as a political analyst and organ-

’ izer brought him into activity in the National Office.

Until his election as General Secretary in July, 1946, he
directed the political action and mass campaignsnof the Com-
munist Party, and was Editor of "Political Aﬂairs, leading
organ of Marxism-Leninism in the U. S. He is also the author

J of numerous pamphlets, including America at the Crossroads,
What America Faces, and Peace or War. .

His present pamphlet, The People Against the Trusts,\is the ,
text of his political report to the plenary meeting of the Na-
tional Committee of the Communist Party, held in New York
on December 3-5, 1946. His summary speech at this historic
meeting is printed in the January, 1947, issue of Political
Aﬂairs.

While generally we hammer out correct policies, and while
we can note effective progress in certain ﬁelds of mass work

i and struggle, we must critically note a number of major weak-

nesses and shortcomings in our activity.

As we have noted, the slowness of most Party organizations
in exhibiting the necessary initiative in advancing the eco-
nomic demands of all sections of the common people, as well
as the existing tendency to underestimate the mood of strug-
gle among the A. F. of L. workers, has impeded our mass work
and hindered the involvement of these forces in the gathering
la-bor-progressive coalition.-

Moreover,_ the great emphasis which our last Plenum placed
upon /the cardinal need of improving the relations between
the Left and center forces within the C.I.O. has not been ade-
quately heeded. As a result, the extreme Right wing forces in
the C.I.O. almost carried through at the recent National C.I.O.
Convention a so-called anti-Communist coup d’état which, if
successful, could have brought the C.I.O_. to disaster.

Here it is necessary to remark that even today not all Com-
munists understand the gravity of the offensive of monopoly
reaction, nor do they appreciate the central importance of
bending every effort to strengthen the ties between the Left
wing and the center forces in the C.I.O., a relationship which
helped to defeat the immediate objectives of the Red-baiters
inside and outside the C.I.O., and contributed to preserving
the unity of the C.I.O. at the Atlantic City Convention.‘

Moreover, the urgent need of striving to ‘bring about a more
favorable and progressive regrouping within the C.I.O., not

A ‘only between the Left wing and the Murray-Potofsky forces,

but also -between the Left wing and some of the non-Left,
though progressively-inclined leading forces. in the auto, tex-
tile and rubber unions, etc., is not yet sufﬁciently understood
or applied. V

More Attention. to Youth

Particular note must also be taken of the developments
among the youth. Among the nearly four million unemployed

58

 

 

at present, approximately three million are young veterans
and working youth displaced from war industry. The limited
facilities of our collegeeducational system are also creating a
special problem whereby hundreds of thousands of veterans
and high school youth are delayed in continuing their scholas-
tic training. Moreover, the threat of continued selective service
or of a new system of compulsory military training are cre-
ating deep uncertainties among the college and working class
youth.

It is clear from these facts that the position of America's
youth is very uncertain and insecure. It is alsopclear why the
pro-fascists and the reactionaries of all shades, and especially
the Catholic hierarchy, are renewing their activities to inﬂu-
ence the youth. But what is unexplained and most dangerous
is that, with the exception of the veterans movement, neither
the progressive labor movement nor the Communists are really

cognizant of this situation. We are not endeavoring to inﬂu- '

ence in a progressive way the masses of student and working
youth. We are not bending every effort to help shape the new,
progressive unity movements which are now embracing mil-
lions of, young people.

It is high time that we Communists put an end to such a
deplorable state of affairs. It is time that we Communists rec-
ognized the widespread enthusiasm and militancy of the youth
and helped direct them into pro-labor and anti-fascist, as well
as Marxist channels. It is time that we Communists stopped
relegating Communist mass work amongst the youth to a
small corps of young comrades in A.Y.D.—devoted and able as
they are—and begin to direct the attention of the entire Party
to solving the problems of the veterans and the students and
of the unemployed and the working youth.

The-youth will determine the future. Therefore we Com-
munists must help determine the future of America’: youth!

Key Problems of Party Building

Finally, and of major importance, it is self-evident that one
of the outstanding weaknesses in our Party's work is the pre-

, 59

Z‘ 1". 

 

 

ll’
:§l
._._~

vailing, pronounced tendency to relegate the building of our
Party and its press to a secondary place. A case in point is the
fate of the realistic decisions of our last Plenum to undertake
a three-month press drive, as well as to couple our mass work
in the elections with the recruitment of ten thousand new
members. Neither decision has been fulﬁlled, nor, for that
matter, really undertaken.

No one can seriously argue that the objective conditions do
not exist to multiply manifold our Party's membership or the
circulation of our press?‘ Yet the facts also are that during the
past four months, precisely at a moment when the Party ex-
panded its mass activities and inﬂuence, the growth of our
Party proceeded at a “normally” slow pace and practically no
headway was made to secure new readers for the Daily Worker
and The Worker.

It is not enough to say that we have not yet mastered the
ways and means of linking Party building with our major
mass campaigns. Something else must be said, namely, that
most of the Party leadership, from top to bottom, underesti-
mate in practice the need of building and strengthening the
Party; that most Party leaders still minimize both the possi-
bilities for Party growth, as well as the supreme political neces-
sity of building a mass American Marxist party.

Irrespective of how we may assess the blame, or muster argu-
ments about the various diﬂiculties (i.e., the effects of Red-
baiting, of political intimidation, etc.) which. often impede the
growth of our Party, there can ‘be no disagreement over one
cardinal fact: that the gap between the growing political in-
ﬂuence of our Party and its still limited organizational strength
restricts the vanguard role of our Party, weakens the labor and
progressive movement, and retards the extension of united
action between non-Communists and Communists.

Obviously, this is not just an “inner” Party problem, it is
not a matter of purely partisan interest. The solution of the

* In fact, during the past year the Party has increased its membership
by over 20,000 and will end the year with the highest registration in our
Party’s history. ‘

task of building a really mass Communist Party in the U.S.A.
is the N 0. I mass task of us Communists; and it shouldequally
be a major concern of every anti-fascist and progressive. And
if American political experience does not suﬂizce to make the
point, then, at least, international experience should convince.

How to Build the Party

To advance the building of a great, national working-class
party of American Marxists, what are some of the speciﬁc
questions which we ‘Communists should now bend maximum
effort to solve? W ‘

a) Our Communist Party must consciously and constantly
strive to become a mass party of mass action. We must develop
our political and organizing initiative, our pioneering role,
our leadership in all the struggles of the working people. We
must expand and consolidate our ties with organized labor

and with all anti-fascists and progressive organizations and -

movements. We must participate in every progressive, united
and democratic front struggle and movement, irrespective of
sponsorship.

b) Our Party must assert and establish its independent role
as the Marxist vanguard of the working class. The face of the
Party, the position of the Party, must stand out at all times. To
do this we must, for one thing, overcome all Right opportunist
tendencies to tail after, or uncritically support, other labor and
progressive leaders, as well as the spokesmen of the bourgeois
liberals. Likewise we must put an end to all Leftist moods, in-
clinations ‘and tendencies to “go it alone,” to belittle, or reject
entering into progressive, united and democratic front agree-
ments, no matter how limited in scope qr temporary they
may be.

To do this we must exercise greater initiative and boldness,
point the way forward, and provide, not only the basic long-
range answers, but also a practical solution for each tactical
situation and immediate problem confronting the people.

This means, too, that we must understand that our inde-
pendentrole consists not only in what we do or say alohe, by

61

 

 

 

ourselves, independent of all other forces. It also depends
upon how we Communists come forward as Communists, and
become recognized as the most loyal and capable trade union-
ists, as the staunchest ﬁghters in all people’s organizations,
carrying out, better than anyone else, the common tasks as-
sumed by non-Communists and Communists alike.

Moreover, if our Party is rapidly to -become a great mass
party of mass action, we must effect a radical change in our
methods of work. All of our leading committees must “grow
up,” limit and change our directives from on “high,” and
give our lower committees and membership concrete recom-
mendations and the know-how of how to implement these;
that we enable each lower Party organization to single out
from the host of pressing tasks the foremost, the single most
vital and urgent political task upon whose solution it will be
possible to press forward and solve all other tasks.

Further, it is necessary to ensure that every Party branch,
shop or community, is directly involved in the solution of the
most pressing day-to-day problems of the people in each given.
factory or neighborhood, including the problems of the Com-
munists themselves. Each branch meeting must serve to en-
rich the political understanding and personal life of every
Party member, and deepen and enrich his or her Marxist
knowledge, social vision, personal development, and capacity
to serve’ his or her branch, shopmates, family, union and com-
munity. .

These, comrades, are some of the problems we can and must
resolve as we move ahead in building our Communist Party
as a mass party of mass struggle. These are some of the things
we must do if we are to play our full part in helping prevent
fascism from coming to power in the U.S.A. and to advance
the people's welfare, national security and social progress.

l947——A ‘Fateful Year

Comrades, we are entering a fateful year, the year of 1947. i
This will be the first year of the 80th Congress, dominated by
the G.O.P. of Hoover, Taft, and Vandenberg. This will be a

62 ‘

year of a more rapidly maturing economic crisis in the U. S.,
and a year of stormy economic and political struggles. This
also will be the year in which the preparations for, and the
outcome of, the 1948 presidential elections will be largely de-
cided. This year, too, will mark the 100th anniversary of the
founding of Marxism.

We American Communists can help resolve in -a progressive
manner the burning issues posed in 1947, can make the best
contributions to our working class and country if we under-
take our tasks in the dynamic spirit of Marxism-Leninism.
We can do this if we utilize 1947 to fortify our Party, our class
and the anti-fascist movement with the lessons of modern his-
tory in the light of Marxism; to promote among the masses
within the reach of our inﬂuence, an understanding of Marx-
ism, the universal social science of the international working
class.

We Communists can make 1947 a year favorable for the -

people if, among other things, we take advantage of the moth
anniversary of Marxism to achieve the following ends:

First, to utilize 1947 as a year in which our entire Party
learns to master more fully and to apply concretely, creatively,

the world science of Marxism to the speciﬁc national condi-.

tions of American economic, social and political life.

Second, to utilize the 1ooth anniversary of Marxism to
understand the concrete development of American imperial-
ism, the economic and social conditions, and the political fac-
tors engendered by it, which aﬂirm the validity of Marxist-
Leninist theory and practice, as well as the speciﬁc effects and
contributions which the outstanding events and certain Amer-
ican leaders in our national life, have made to the enrichment
and development of Marxism, e.g., the revolutionary wars of
1776 and 1865, Benjamin Franklin, Lewis Henry Morgan, etc.

Thirdly, to utilize this centenary occasion to deepen the
understanding of our Party, and to ‘bring the understanding
to millions of progressive Americans that, to be a good Marx-
ist, means to be a better American; and that, guided by the
science of the working class, Marxism, we American Com-

63 7

munists take second place to none in serving and advancin
the interests of our people and country. s

3

4' 1‘ it .

Comrades! In concluding this report I wish ‘again to under-
score the central immediate tasks now confronting the Amer-
ican working class and our Party: These are, to forge the
united, militant action of labor; to weld the broadest unity,
of action of labor, of all progressives, and all democratic forces
against monopoly reaction and for a people's program; to
guarantee the nomination and election of a progressive, presi-
dential ticket and Congress in 1948; to construct a stronger,
a mass" Communist Party of mass action; and to advance
everywhere, on all fronts, a powerful democratic coalition to
struggle for jobs, security and equality, for progress,-democ-

' racy and peace. »

These are our immediate and vital aims which we hold in

common with all of labor, with all democrats and progressives.

And for theseobjectives, and to advance the fundamental in-

” terests and aims of the working c1ass—Socialism—we will ﬁght

steadfastly, with renewed vigor and determination.

\ L The Results of the 1946 Elections

THIS meeting of ou_r National‘ Committee is one of extra-
ordinary importance. We are called upon to make a
concrete examination of what happened at the polls on No-
vember D5 and why. We are faced, too, with the responsi-
bility of clearly estimating the consequences of these elections
and the future course of events.

‘Above all, we are confronted with the decisive task of point-
ing the way forward, of helping rally and unite the labor
and general democratic camp to counteract the major politi-
cal battle which reaction won on November 5, and to go
over to the counter-offensive to safeguard and advance the
cause of security, democracy and peace. “

=ll= as at

The Congressional elections ‘of November 5 were the first
elections in the life of our nation since‘ the end of World
War II. -

Any comparison of our national elections with the post-
war elections in a series of European countries naturally brings

E about a picture of contrast: On the one hand, there are the

5

strong and decisive democratic victories and Leftward trends
in countries like France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania; on the other, there is the shift of Congressional
party control in the U.S.A. to the Right, to the reactionary
G.O.P.

Comparative studies of various situations are useful only
to the extent that correct conclusions are drawn from them.
A study, and not just a recording of the facts, will reveal some
of the salient reasons for this contrast.

Contrasts in Elections

In the first place, American imperialism emerged from this
war as the most powerful capitalist country. While capital-
ism on a world scale came out of the anti-Axis war markedly
weakened and undermined, American capitalism strength-
ened its monopoly positions. This process must, of course,
be seen in conjunction with the simultaneous intensiﬁcation of
the contradictions that. are basic to'its system.

On the side of the peoples, of the national liberating forces,
the broad wartime national resistance movements in most
European countries brought together Communists and non-
Communists in common anti~fascist struggle and in a new
political relationship. In the course of these mass movements
the Communists became recognized by the masses as “people
of a special mould,” as the foremost champions of progress,
freedom and democracy. However, here in the U.S.A., largely
due to the absence of direct military struggle and people’s
resistance on these shores, the attainment of the anti-Axis
victory has been marked by the grave absence of an all-in-

clusive, people's democratic, anti-fascist unity.

Further, with regard to the recent American and European
elections, there is also a notable difference in the magnitude,
status and inﬂuence of the respective Communist. parties. Un-
like the situation in many European countries, our Party has
not yet succeeded in attaining the strength and influence of a
really broad, mass party.

6

 

 

   

Weaknesses of Labor

Finally, as a major point of difference, there is the curse
of economism, of “pure-and-simple trade unionism,” which has
long operated in the American labor movement as a major

‘obstacle to achieving a mass class consciousness and a quali-
tatively new advance in progressive political rea1ignments.-

Thus, we have a situation wherein the recent mighty and
militant economic and political struggles of American labor
and its popular allies, as well as the growth of the progressive

A ‘labor movement in the recent decade, have not yet resulted in
the fullest development of labor’s independent political ac-
tion. Thus, we have a situation in which, as yet, labor has
forged neither a mass united front party of its own, nor a
wide, people’s, democratic-coalitionparty in which it could
assume‘ leadership. A ‘ A

While noting these and other factors, we should fail in a

’ realistic evaluation of the post-election situation if we took
the contrast in electoral results on the Continent and in
America to mean that nothing progressive has, or is, happen-
ing in the U'.S.A. , _ ‘

The ‘electoral victory of the G.O.P. must in no sense be
viewed as a subjective “swing” to the Right” on the part of
labor or the common people. A deeper estimate of the situa-
tion shows that something progressive is happening in these
United States that contains great promise for the future of the
anti-monopoly and democratic forces.

The factors are present, as never before in the nation's
history, for a forward surge of the labor and progressive forces
on the political arena.

I will endeavor, within the limits of this report, to examine
some of,,th'ese factors and to outline what must be done to pre-
pare for a people's, a democratic victory over monopoly-re-
action in the decisive struggles which are maturing.
