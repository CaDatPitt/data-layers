Counter-Revolution in Budapest

V-Investigations and interrogations are still going on. There are
as" yet no detailed reports. on the White terror in Budapest in
autumn i956, but the accounts prepared thus far, if incomplete
and dry, throw suiﬁcient light on the question of what political
forces entered the ring in the days of anarchy, and against whom
the weapons in their hands were turned.

Testimony of an Eye-Witness '

Laszlé’ Oravecz, Budapest resident, relates:

“On October 31, 1956, at 14.30, standing at the corner_.of
Lenin Avenue and 7th November Square, I witnessed the
following event: A man dressed in khaki trousers and a
sports jacket of the Dézsa sports society was going along"
Lenin Avenue opposite" the Miivész Cinema. Somebody
shouted; ‘He's in the State Security!’ The crowd rushed at.
the man and started to beat him up. In the tussle which
ensued, somebody threw around the man’s neck a wire cable.
by means of which the man, who had lost consciousness,‘wa,s.
hanged on a tree in front of a hardware shop at the corner of ‘
Lenin Avenue and Aradi Street. A board was "ﬁxed to the;
breast of the murdered man with theinscription ‘Captain Téth
of the State Security Service. The same fate awaits every"
State Security member.’

The counter-revolutionaries,
who sought, under the guise
of ﬁghting against Stalin-
ism, to bring about the over-
throw of proletarian rule,
pull down a plate bearing the
name of Lenin Avenue, re-
placihg it by a ptate with the
inscription "Theresa Avenue,"
the name used before the lib-
eration

"‘Nobody made sure whether persons seized were really State

Security members. The brutally murdered people were victims of

a campaign of slander and baiting.”

Testimony of a Misguided Youth

Fifteen.-year-old Csaba Bényai, who was givenarms and. en-
rolled in a “special detachment,” relates:

V “On November 2 and 3 we billeted ourselves in groups of
ten in ﬂats commandeered from the inhabitants. We also
dragged our victims there. We murdered them with poison
injections and then shot them through the head for appear-‘
anoe’s sake.”

This youth relatedthat their “special detachment” was divided ‘

into groups of -ten. He also reported that on November_ 9 «all of
their commanders “got into motor cars and drove somewhere.”

The Death of Sandor Sziklai

The Swabians who were formerly members of the Volksbund,

and who were headedby J6zsef,Eszterle, threatened the Sziklai’
family living in Budakeszi with death as early as ten days before‘

the Octoberevents, On October 25 armed bandits attacked the
house. They threw a hand grenade into the ﬂat and then broke in.

‘ Colonel Sandor Sziklai defended himself with his revolver and

killed one of his attackers. However, a splinter from a grenade
thrown by the bandits mortally wounded him. The bandits chopped
up his father-in-law Lajos Kiss with a hatchet; Sandor Sziklai
was a veteran ﬁghter of the working-class movement, and Lajos
Kiss was an old ‘Communist, who had been in the -Party since 1919.

Some Facts

V In order to show who wanted to proﬁt by the events of'October'

23 and for what purpose, we shall cite anumber of facts and
portray a few persons. ‘

The leader of one of the armed groups which operated in the
llth District was Vera Laskovics who lives at 5 Illatos Street, is
a well-known prostitute and had already served prison terms. Her
group had large quantities of arms and ammunition and operated
in the vicinity of Ferenc Boulevard, Mester Street and Tompa
Street. Laskovics was nearly always drunk, and forced her asso-
ciates to shoot indiscriminately.

The sixteen-year-old J anos Szilégyi lived for a number of years
in a home for defective children. In the hospital to which he was
taken after being wounded he said, laughing:

“I fell in with a captain dressed in civilian clothes. He and
I went to addresses given to us to murder State Security
members and Communists. One day we went to a house not
far from the hotel and up to the fourth floor. The captain said.
we‘ were going to a State. Security man. We found him at
home with his wife and six-year-old daughter. First the
captain beat him up, then he tore off his ears and cut his nose
with scissors, after which ﬁred a volley into him. Meanwhile
his wife tried to escape, but one of the men from our detach-

ment shot her on the spot. After we had dealt with the parents
we began to wonder what to do with the daughter. Finally we
shot her too. . .. We did not operate only in that flat, every
day. we had a new task.”

Sz. E., who was freed from prison and was arrested on Novem-
ber 8 when attempting to leave the country, related the following.

“I made the acquaintance of the engineer-ﬁtter Janos
Horvéth; he is about 28 years old. In the house where he
lived this J énos Horvéth killed four or ﬁve State Security men
who lived in the same house. Besides, he took other State
Security men to the cellar where they were all shot.”

In the 19th District of Budapest Kélman Turner, an old welder

part in the defence of the Party Committee building.

In the same district Jézsef Labadi, a member of the council, was
called to the door of his house and shot in the abdomen. .

Kéroly Lados, whose wife was President of the Kispest Council,
was killed with a volley of sub-machine gun ﬁre.

Hundreds of honest people were -arrested and deported. In
the 3rd District Otto Bihari, Secretary of the Party Organization
in the Goldberger Works,_ and ‘Erna Molnar, Secretary of the
District Party Committee, were arrested. Armed people came to
the flat of a 70-year-old pensioner and former administrative
worker in the State Security Service in the same district. In order
to escape from his attackers, the aged pensioner. jumped out of the
window into the yard, and was killed. Detachments of counter-
revolutionaries sent some of the people they seized to deportation
prisons. By November 3 they -already had many hundreds of State

Security men and 120 civilians in their custody. Their execution ’

was ﬁxed for November 5. Other detachments ‘used to send their
victims to other places. Executions also took place on the spot.
On November 4 men standing in a queue at a food shop _in Marti-
rok- Street in the 2nd District were seized and taken away and
many other persons, who were in the street, were arrested.‘ The
Communists "were singled out to be shot. The fulﬁlment of the plan
was prevented by the arrival of Soviet tanks.

after the raid on the Hungarian- oviet Society building

Attack  
by Counter-Revolutionaries
on the Building
of the Budapest Committee
of the Hungarian Working
People’s Party

The attack took place on October '30, that is, after the oiﬁcial
cease-ﬁre. This attack openedthe general assault of counter—revo-
lution against the organizations of the Hungarian Working
People’s Party. Its purpose was to overthrow the people's demo~
cratic power and to restore the capitalist system. In terms of
tactics this was a turning-point; the organized armed forces of
counter-revolution, which had joined in the just mass movement
of the people under disguise, now discarded the mask. . '

One of the characteristic-tactics of the counter-revolutionaries
was incitement against the State Security bodies. They wanted to
destroy, in the most literal sense of the word, every man inthat
branch of the forces, every single member. of the State Security
Service, irrespective of whether they were rank-and--ﬁle soldiers
performing their military service, or honest old Communists who
themselves had been in prison during the Rékosi regime and who
in the period previous to October 23 had for that very reason been
sent to that service to improve its .work and to guarantee law.

When the counter—revolutionaries began the attack on the Party

Committee premises the Imre N_agy Government had already

adopted. the decision to abolish the State Security Service. How-
ever, that government did nothing to put an end to the frenzied

‘outrages. As a result, after the 'government’s decision to dissolve

the State Security Service, the counter—revolutionaries were able

The ﬁtter Lajos Kélemen, a K6bd_nya Communist, was brought to hospital
with a brain concussion and thirty-four bleeding wounds

to continue their organized campaign for the destruction of “every-
member of the State Security.” The streets of Budapest were
strewn with the corpses of Security Service members, murdered in
the most outrageous manner. The baiting of Party workers
started simultaneously. It was enough to say of anybody that he
“is a ‘member of the State Security Service” for him‘ to be
seized, tortured or murdered. The’ action against the members of
the State Security was accompanied by‘ incitement against Com-
munists. i

Under the slogan of Communist-baiting, the attack on the
premises of’ the Budapest district committees and local territorial
Party organizations was carried out. On October 29, before the
attack on the Budapest City Party Committee there was a raid on

22

 

the Party committees of the 7th and 8th districts and on the House
of Party Education. In the afternoon of October 29 small armed
groups appeared in Republic Square near the premises of the
Budapest Party Committee.

The Attack

The entrance to the building was guarded at the time by an
armoured car, equipped with as heavy machine-gun. At dusk, the
crew of the armoured car captured three rebels. All three were

Artillery Colonel Papp, who had come to the City Party Committee on the
business of organizing a militia, was atrociously murdered after the assault

found in possession of “National Guard” membership cards. One
of them, a sixteen-year-old lad, had a grenade and his comrades
had ﬁre-arms. This lad confessed that he had been about to throw
the Hand grenade into the armoured car. The other two rebels
were found in possession of new boots, spirits and other articles.
The three insurgents were disarmed and then escorted with the
articles they had looted to the police station in Mosonyi Street.

-At about nine p. In. two army officers arrived in the City‘ Party
Committee from the Defence Ministry.*They reported that armed
individuals had captured an adjacent area‘ and were preparing to
attack the committee building. The two ofﬁcers joined Colonel
Téth Lajos who had come earlier with several officers on the
business of organizing a working people’s militia.

The expected attack did not take place during the night. Next
day the armoured car left its place at the entrance of the City
Committee. At about 10 o’clock numerous armed groups began to

gather near the building. They seized the Erkély Theatre situated
opposite the «City Committee, and set up a machine-gun emplace-
ment on theroof. They also ﬁlled the square in front of the City
Committee and took up positions under cover of trees. The insur-
gents also broke into neighbouring buildings and settled down.

The City Committee building was guarded by about 40 men
commanded by two lieutenants. The guard did not react either to
the concentration of the armed groups or to their preparation for
an attack. There were present in the City Committee the City
Party Committee Secretary lmre Mez6 and about forty members
of the City Committee staff, including typists, dining-room attend-.
ants, iurnac.e—men-and others.

Those in the building, seeing-the preparations for the assault,
reported the situation to the executive of the Party, the'govern—
ment and the central police administration, and requested help.
They were assured that appropriate measures would be taken, but

at that time the government bodies and the command of the armed

forces were already on the verge of disintegration. As a result,
the promised assistance was not given.

The attack developed according to a military plan prepared
beforehand. Just after ten o’clock the insurgents started the
assault.

As long as the counter-revolutionaries used only. small arms

-and machine-guns, the guard succeeded in defending the building

 

with «small ﬁre-arms against opposing forces twenty or thirty
times as strong in number. However, at about half past eleven the
attacking groups brought in artillery. There W185 artillery, machine-
gun and riﬂe ﬁre. The building was set on ﬁre. Many people were
killed and lay in the wrecked rooms and corridors, the number
of wounded increased continually. During the assault the com-
mand of the armed forces repeatedly promised to send help. Some
higher ofﬁcials did try to help, but could not do so. Finally, at two
p. m., a telephone message came from the Defence Ministry saying
that no help could be given. «

Taking into account the gravity of the situation, the ofﬁcers
present in the City Committee ‘recommended that the guard cease
resistance and lay down their arms. C,

The City Committee Secretary lmre Mez6 ordered the guard to»
cease ﬁre. A white ﬂag was hoisted over the building. Then some:

of the insurgents made their way into the wrecked building while

others continued to ﬁre. . _
One of the Party workers who was in the committee building

gave the following accountof the assault: . _ » '

“The ﬁring, which lasted- about -four and a half hours,
reduced the building to ruins.’ Just aftertwo o’clock we were
convinced that further bloodshed was senseless. Comrade
Imre Mez6 ordered that resistance be ceased. Two army

‘of«ﬁcers.vo1unteered to inform the attackers of this. Comrade
Mez6 went with them. As they went out bearing awhite ﬂag
they were met by ﬁre. Comrade Mez6 intended to try to con-
vince-the insurgents that there was no sense in continuing the
assault and the bloodshed. But he‘ did not succeed in doing
so, for the three of them were killed. Rushing into the build-
ing, the insurgents tortured and killed the people there with
incredible cruelty. Men in military uniform, army ofﬁcers,
policemen, rank-and-ﬁle soldiers, who were doing their active
service in State Security units (most of them aged about
twenty), were hanged on trees in Republic Squzare. When -some
of them had been murdered their heads were chopped oﬁ,’ the
hearts of others were cut out.”

That was how the Secretary of the Budapest -City Committee
Imre Mezf)’ lost his life. The butchers cut out the heart of Colonel
J énos Asztalos, a respected veteran ﬁghter of the’ working-"class
movement, andkilled Colonel Papp and Colonel Szabé. The Party
School lecturer Péter Lakatos was" shot on the spot-. More than

twenty sons of the Hungarian people fell victim to the bloody"

terror in Republic Square.

The terrible butchery horriﬁed some of the insurgents. They
were shocked by the cruelty of the atrocities in which they them-
selves took part. Some of the insurgents tried to mitigate the
cruelty and save at least the civilians. But they.were unable" to
prevent the execution of the guard or to save the army ofﬁcers.

The City Party Committee workers were also tortured. One of
them, Eva Kéllai, in order to escape from the murderers, jumped
out of the window on the second ﬂoor. People were taken to
hospital beaten up, covered with blood and seriously wounded.

H. 1., one of the City Committee workers, gives the following
description of those ter.rible hours:.

old woman. They forced me to throw down my handbag and
my coat which I was holding. They went through my pockets,
took ev-erything away from me and one of them ordered me
to cover them and lead them along the corridor and pushed
me in front of him. At that moment a comrade from the
_Higher Party School approached ‘the staircase at the end of
the corridor. While checking his papers they kicked him. I
proﬁted by this moment to break out of the crowd and go to
the second ﬂoor. There I was stopped again. They struck me
with something on the shoulder, kicked me, and then sur-
rounded me and took me into the hall where the wounde
were lying. Then they led me out to Republic Square so that
could look at the fate ‘awaiting my comrades; -1” here was a
enormous crowd in the square. A State Securitysoldier was
kicked, pushed about and beaten up; ﬁnally’ they stuffed into
his mouth his Party member's card which they had found in
his pocket. Not far from the soldier was lying one of those
who had been wounded in the building. T hey" kicked him too,
spat on him, trampled on him, derided him and then dragged
. him a littleifarther away to where a comrade was already
hanged by the feet. I don't know whether he was still alive,
but the blood was still ﬂowing. The rope did not bear his
weight and snapped, but they hanged him again. The crowd
around him was in a real frenzy.” '

Lies and Calumny

In the fury of the counter-revolution, which reminded one of the
White terror in 1919, the monstrous lie about the City Party Com-
mittee in Republic Square played a considerable role. One of the
manifestations of this was the widespread ‘story about “secret
dungeons” under the City Committee building. '

According to the ﬁrst version of this lie, “several hundred State
Security members” who, it was rumoured, had been guarding the
building——-although, it was common knowledge that the guard of
the building numbered forty men—-—were supposed to be hiding in
those dungeons. ' ’ _

_Where in that case were the “several hundred” guards? There
was ‘a malignant rumour about “mysterious knocking comingfrom
the depths,” which could have come from the “State Security
members” who were supposed to be hiding there. But here logic

32

  

 

was completely shattered. If these mythical State Security men
‘had found a secret passage by which they went down to -the
dungeons, then why had they not found a way by which they

whereabouts by knocking. The absurdity of this «ﬁction became
obvious even for its authors and that is why they had to change
it as they went along. Then aversion full of horrors about “poli-
tical prisoners locked up there ten years before” was concocted.
The latter version was better adapted to the aims of counter-
revolutionary propaganda, for it helped to extend hatred for the
State Security Service to a universal hatred for the Party.-There
were journalists, too, who put their pens at the service of this
dishonest propaganda. Otto Végh, for instance, in his article en-
titled “Secret Underground Prison ‘under Party Building,” pub-
. lished in one of the daily papers, dished up this lie, which contra-
dicted elementary logic, as an irrefutable truth. The paper of Du-
dés and his associates, Magyar Fiiggetlenség, . combined both
these legends and placed side by side inthe “secret dungeons”
the vanished State Security men, and the mysterious political
prisoners. _
In an effort to give a semblance of truth to these nightmarish
stories and intensify anti-communist hysteria, excavations were in
the end begun near the City Committee building with the use of
numerous and various machines. There were repeated appeals by
wireless to those who had worked on the building and to engineers
who knew the site, to appear on the scene of the excavations.
Needless to say the “excavations” did not yield any results, for
there is not, and cannot be, any “secret prison” in a Communist
Party building. However, various strange legends are still in
circulation, and they have been, and still are, purposely spread by
_ the counter—revolutionaries in theirefforts to divert by any means
public attention from their own deeds of bloodshed and to carry
on unbridled Communist-baiting. Such is the truth about the story
of the “secret dungeons” in the City Party Committee.

This is the true story of the attack on the building of the
Hungarian Working People's Party in -Republic Square.

Counter-Revolutionary Actions
in the Provinces

\

The mass disturbances that began in Budapest on October 23
spread. to the provinces,on October 25 and 26. '
- At theclose of October, insurgents, part of whom apparently
guided by humane motives, opened the gates of the prisons and
released arrested fascists and criminals. These criminals played
an appreciable role in strengthening the forces of the counter-
revolution. From that standpoint the example of the Mér District
National Committee is characteristic. The chairman of that com
mittee was Imre Kovécs, an old peasant, but apart from him there
was only one other peasant in that body.’ Without exception, the
other "members were fascists and criminals just released from
prison. The deputy chairman was a certain Onodi, a criminal with

a record of seventeen convictions; the secretary was Jozef Kiss, a.

bandit serving an eleven-years sentence, while the members were
Janos =-Sehiffer and P51 Bandy, officers who served under I-Iorthy,
as well as former gendarmes Kdves, I-larsanyi, Lendvai and
Kovécs.' .

Horthyites in Gyiir

A certain Captain Lajos Somogyvary, a Horthy officer, arrived
in Gyfir in October. As soon as signs of ‘a counter-revolution
became evident, he hurried to ‘Hungary from Munich, arriving in
Gy6r by air, and immediately took command of thecounter-revo-
lutionaries. Somogyvéry put forward a programme that was
broadcast by the Gy6r radio station and recorded on tape. Here
are a few excerpts from Mr. Somogyva'1ry’s programme:

“l, Lajos Somogyvary, an envoy of the youth (I), who are at

this moment shedding their blood, have arrived in Gy6r and am '

speaking over the radio in .order to call upon you.to set up a
counter-government without delay. The Government of Imre Nagy
had no constitutional basis and is only upheld by twenty or thirty
thousand armed bandits and marauders. As from today we have
decided to create a governmental national defence c.ommissariat——
a committee for the conduct of military operations, to be more
exactwwhich would perform the functions of the ministries of
defence and the interior. . .. Our ranks have no place for those

whoduring the regime that dominated in the course of the past

twelve years held any leading positions. . .. We are fully deter~
mined to get in touch with foreign governments. . . .

“If we are unable to set up reliable radio communication, we
shall try to take back (t) the powerful transmitters guarded by
insigniﬁcant forces or to get a transmitter from abroad as quickly
as possible. We shall do all in our power to enable Hungarians
living abroad. . . to form and send volunteer regiments of freedom
ﬁghters to us because every minute is precious. We ask you to
inform everybody of this, including Radio ‘Free Europe’ so that
they can all contact the Gy6r Revolutionary Government created
under the leadership of Lajos Somogyvéry, and the governmental

commissariat for the conduct of military operations. . .. Every. T

Hungarian worker knows, his duty. Stop work immediately at
factories and all other places and resume it only at the bidding
of the newly formed government. In addition, arrest all unreli-
able persons in the provinces and elsewhere.”

Another person to appear in Gy6r was a capitalist nramed
Kertész, who was the chief share-holder of the Gyéir wool and
textile factory. He lived in West Europe, but ‘later, when he
learned of what was taking place‘in Hungary, he went to Vienna
in order to go on to his homeland and recover the ownership of
“his enterprise” in Gy6r. Kertész informed the chief engineer
at the factory of his desire “to start negotiations” for “his fac-
tory.” . ‘ ' ’

It is to be presumed that that is enough. ‘

Terrorist groups of counter-revolutionaries began to operate in
Gyfir. One of them, comprising some twenty men, stopped Vendel

Németh, a ﬁfty-year—old worker of the Regional Party Committee,’

in the street, beat him up and tried to throw ‘him into the Danube.

Two Hungarian soldiers saved him from the hands of his
attackers. The counter-revolutionaries began to form armed.

In Szekszérd

. In the town of Szekszérd, reactionary elements seized control of
the national committee. They arbitrarily removed the heads of the
town council from office, replacing them with old-regime off1cials—-—-
former rural district chiefs and police commissioners. »A committee

g_ of ﬁve, including former rural district chiefs, Dr. Marth, Dr. Far-
‘ kas and Dr. Simon, seized power in the regional council. Former
police commissioners Dr.‘ Antal Pet6, Dr. Gytirgy Taba and
Dr. Laszlé Mez6 became the heads of the district council. When
representatives of the rural councils assembled, they simply
- announced that no former leader could remain at his post and that
 the candidates they put forward must be accepted.

In the Village of Fiizesabony

During the night of November 3, a group headed by the Vku'lal<
Janos" Ga] and shirkers Janos Gal Kiss and Istvén Korédi, who
frequented the public house, pulled down a monument to Soviet
soldiers and then went to the village council with the intention
of beating up the head. Finding nobody in, they went to the house
of the rural procurement xagent, smashed the windows and then
dragged the representative, a worker sent to the district from
Budapest, from his house to the‘ building of the village-council,

0 beat him up and threw him into one of the rooms. The group or-
ganized by the kulak-s “proclaimed’_’ a certain Fecske, a former,
1-Iortyhy official and chief of the local government body, as the
head of the local council. . '

A “worke-rs’ council” was set" up under the leadership of this
former ofﬁcial. The council’-s first act was to remove Lajos Kovécs.
business manager of the consumers‘. marketing co-operative, from
office and to beat him up. Shouting anti-Semitic slogans, they
went to a textile shop and chased outjthe manager.-‘The wife and
child of the procurement agent were thrown out of--' their house
and the neighboursvwere warned not to take the child in. A group
led by Janos Gal attacked a police station, armed themselves
there and rushed to the District Party Committee. They broke
into the building and stole 18,000 forints from the safe.

In this village, the chairman of the village council, a former
worker in Budapest and one of the oldest council chairmen in
Heves Region, was brutally beaten up. His ribs were broken and
his lungs injured, while his nine-year-old son was beaten so severe-
ly that he could not rise from his bed. The chairman’s wife
was locked up between two doors so that she would not get away.

In Pépa

The leading communist workers here were arrested at dawn

on October 31. They included Sandor Pandur, chairman of the‘

district council, and Jézsef Pap, chief of the district po-lice. About
forty Communists were forcefully driven out of town, although
later a few of them were allowed to return. It was announced
that sortie of the arrested men would be sent to a concentration
camp and some of them would be executed. The arrival of Soviet
troops prevented this intention from being carried out.

Sanguinary events unfolded on October 29. A bi crowd gath-
ered in one of the squares. In the ensuing Cl'0SSr re ‘a member
of the “national guard” detachment was wounded in one of his
lungs. Somebody in the crowd shouted that “it was the State
Security Service men who had ﬁred.” The result was that, after
brutal tortures, three men were hanged in front of the building of
the workers’ council‘; two of them did‘ not belong to the -State
Security Service but to the police and only one. was a State Secu-
rity man. He wasitaken from his house, whichwas -three or four
kilometres from the scene of ﬁring, and he did not even know
what had happened. As a matter of fact, the ﬁring started when
one of the members of the “national guards,” who was in the
crowd, accidentally _(or with the purpose of provocation) tired
from a riﬂe". The other “national guardsmen” took advantage of
this and began to tire at random. The second of the men who were
executed had been seized on the scene, while the. third was de-'
t_ai=ned in some other street and,.consequently,‘had not been -in the
square either. These men were savagely beaten and then dragged
to the building of the workers’ council. Later, atgthe demand of
the crowd, the workers’_council handed them over to the counter-
revolutionaries after which they were hanged.

In Kiskunmajsa

_ The counter-revolutionaries _executed 60-year-old Jozsef Nemé-
nyi, who had been in the labour movement since 1919 and a
reader in problems of industry and trade at the Kiskunmajsa
councﬂ. . . .

On October 27, 1956, a detachment headed by a group of 10
to 15 people, broke into the council premises. They looked for
N-eményi, but he was not there. Then they went to his house.
dragged him to the council’s ofﬁces and beat him to death.

After that the bandits went to the offices of the Party commit-
tee. They did not ﬁnd the Secretary but, instead, found one-armed
paralyzed Kuklis ‘Lukacs, member of the pastures committee, and
beat him up. Then they moved on to the home of a Jew, small
shopkeeper Krausz, but the latter was not in. So, shouting anti-
Semitic slogans, they attacked the house of Fischof, purchaser at
the consumers’ marketing co-operative, and smashed all the fur-

niture. Fischof himself escaped through the attic. The mob

attacked and beat up the peasant Benjamin Balog, chairman of
the pastures committee.

These events were followed by the election in the village of‘
‘a -so-called workers’ council consisting entirely of kulaks, proﬁ-

teers, gendarmes. and criminals released from prison. It is char-
acteristic that the former sergeant-major of gendarmes Jozsei
Karcsﬁ became the new. police chief.

On October 27, 1956, a “national! council” which included two
gendannes, was set up under the chairmanship of a former Horthy
ofﬁcial named Mihély -Maroti. On November 1, armed members
of this council, former gendarmes Lajos Kiss and lstvén Halész
Jr., broke into the ﬂat of the Secretary of the Party ‘organization,
dragged him out into the street and-beat him up.

In Csormi

~ On October 26, 1956, under the leadership of the former inn-’

keeper Imre Plenér and others there was a demonstration which
was soon joined by all the reactionary elements of the village

, who had been lying low. Only about 6 or- 8 per cent of the popu-

lation took part in the demonstration. The participants set up
a “national committee" in which the leading. role was played by
Gytirgy Czinder, a former Nilasist ofﬁcial, chief of the village
government body. in 1920, Czinder’s father was one of the ring-
leaders of the counter-revolutionary White terror, who savagely
murdered honest toilers. During the event-s of October 26, his
younger brother, J énos Czinder, was the ﬁrst to demand that for-
mer gendarmes should at once put on their gendarmerie uni-
forms and seize power in the village. ‘The Czinder brothers’
accomplices were persons known for their reactionary, counter-
revolutionary views. Sandor Székely, a former Horthy officer, was
appointed chairman of the “national _committee,”.Ronge, a cap-
tain in the former Horthy army, proclaimed himself the military
commandant of Csorna. An officers’ detachment "was formed of
former Horthy ofﬁcers hiding in and about the village and at
‘once began to prepare a reign of White terror. By order of -Gy6r~
gy Czinder this detachment arrested Ferenc I-lajté, former Sec-
retary of the village Party organization, and handed him over
for trial to the “extraordinary tribunal” which they themselves had
set up. This farcical trial was to have been the signal for the exter-

‘ mination of all the other leaders_ who were___honest and loyal to

the people’s. democratic system. Gyorgy Czinder, Séndor _Szé-
kely and their accomplices ‘drew up a list of the people they in-
tended to destroy. During the “trial” of Ferenc I-lajté and other
persons named in the list, which was ‘held on November 3, at-
tempts were made to get incriminating confessions from them.
After the trial, Gyérgy Czinder ordered Ferenc I-Iajt<')’s guards to
shoot him at night. However, the guards knew Hajto pensonally
and did not carry out this _order.‘Bloodshed was prevented by the
arrival of Soviet troops. Seeing the failure of the counter'-revo-
lutionar terror, Gytirgy-Czinder and some .of his accomplices
ﬂed to t e West.

I ntroduction

Hungary has become the arena of tragic events. The Rékosi-
Ger6 policy has brought the socialist development of the country
‘to an impasse. The results of this criminal policy have aroused
deep indignation and a broad ‘popular movement. Hundreds of
‘thousands of working people demanded the expurgation of the

popular power, the elimination of widespread bureaucracy and the

end of a policy which was grievously insulting to national feeling.
Theaim pursued in all this was the consolidation and further
genuinely free development of the :people’s democratic system

which was following the path of socialism. For the working class
is not willing to return the factories to the capitalists, the»

peasantry will not countenance the return of the landed magnates,
the people has no intention of giving up its powerand does not

'.~VWish to be placed under the yoke of the capitalists and landlords
again.

‘i’ ‘However, the dark forces of counter—revolution tried from the

livery beginning to take advantage of the movement, which had
developed under the slogan of justiﬁed, popular_ and national_
demands, in order to overthrow the people’s power.

It is not the purpose of this pamphlet to give a detailed account
of the bloodshed that took place in these ‘regrettable days. It will
merely bring out certain facts which occurred in those days when
the counter-revolutionary forces were supreme in the streets of
Budapest, provincial towns and many villages.

The plan of the armed rebellion was. prepared by the counter-
revolutionaries in advance and carefully elaborated from the
military point of view.- A testimony-to "this is that on the very
ﬁrst evening of the mass demonstrations a planned attack was
carried out on the wireless stations, the international communica-

tions section. of the Jézsef central telephone exchange, the arsenals '

and transport depots. All this was strikingly reminiscent in many
respects of the counter-revolutionary action against the Hungarian

Hungarian Events as Mirrored
in the Western Press

‘ sA_.perusa'l,of the columns of the Western ress will brin to
light numerous excerpts which prove b_eyon all shadow 0% a
doubt that bourgeois circles in the West had also clearly seen
the offensive of the counter-revolutionary forces in Hungary and
their terrorist actions. Though scrappily, these excerpts, like the
stillsof a ﬁlm, show the impartial observer the events that have
taken place and their -pernicious _aftermath, as well as the broad
international contacts of"the Hungarian extreme Right and fas-

cistgroupings, which, after careful preparation, deftly utilized ~

for counter-revolutionary purposes the popular movement aimed

against the‘ crimes committed by the Rékosi-,Ger6 leader-‘

ship.' , .
Light isshed on the events that preceded October 30, when the
counter-revolution unmasked itself, by the well-known and al-
ready cited statement by Allgn Dulles, head of American intelli-
gence, in which he said that they “knew well in advance” about
the Hungarian rising- ‘ - ' ' ’ '

Role of the “Free Europe” Cor_nmittee-

In. ‘a long article printedon November 22, the Paris newspa-per

.LeAMon_d"e refers to foreign ties and detailed -preparations. It says:

“Top_+ranking Americans seized every opportunity to express their
interest in the peoples of Eastern Europe, to stimulate resistance

49

and to ‘emphasize that everybody ﬁghting for freedom-would re-
ceive support from America. . .. In 1949, at the heightof ‘cold
war,’ a huge organization was set up which was nominally pri-
vate butwhich in reality was under the State Department. This
was the ‘Free Europe’ Committee. It was headed -by Allen Dulles,
who was then deputy chief of the Central Intelligence Bureau
and is now its head. The committee was created with two
purposes in view: t.o take into its own hands the organization
and guidance of the post-war political émigrés and to ensure them
the leading role in the propaganda beamed to ‘Ea-stern Europe.
-National committees, whose members were picked by Americans,
were set up in New York. The Americans ‘gave them material sup-
port, thus enabling. them to be the sole spokesmen of the émigrés.
At the same time a radio station was built in Holzkirchen near
Munich. This radio station, which employed about a hundred
Hungarians, broadcast all-day programmes for Hungary with the
purpose of bolstering the spirit of resistance to the communist
system among its listeners. The principal theme of these broad-
casts was the might of America and its mission to help enslaved
peoples. 9n the other hand, ‘the Crusade for Freedom’ organiza-

' tion, a sister of the ‘Free Europe’ Committee, from time to time
used thousands of balloons to shower Hungary with leaﬂets which

incited the population to resistance in the name of the non-exist-
ent ‘committee offliberation. . . . During the rising, probably many
people responded to thepcalls of Radio‘ ‘Free Europe’. . . . Did they
not in the counseof these days wage a futile struggle. because
they listened to the advice given on the eve of the American pres-

idential elections by Radio ‘Free Europe,’ which assured its lisé ‘

teners that if the armed uprising continued after ‘publication of
the election returns, the Washington Government could‘ come
forward in the interests ‘of Hungary.” V ' «-

A picture of the direct preparations for the uprising is. given
by the Berliner Zeitung in its issue of November 20, when it ac-

quainted readers with the ties the counter-revolutionary ‘forces in-

Hungary have in West Germany.

“The participation oftrained Hungarian émigrés in the bloody

events in Hungary is now an established fact. It has been learned
in Munich that in Upper Bavari-a near Trauenstein there is an

American-run camp, in which officers from Franco Spain and.

members of Hungarian fascist organizations teach people parti-

san wnarfare. A large group of Swabians from Hungary, men who.

A ﬂed to West Germany in 1945 because they were members of

Waﬁen-SS detachments, arrived in the camp after October
20. . . . They have their own organization, which functions in Mu-,
nichat 3 Himmelreich Straﬁe. . _

“On the 24, 25 land 26 of October, groups of guerrilla trainees
were sent from the Trauenstein camp to Austria and from there
smuggled into Hungary in Red Cross aeroplanes and trucks.
Their assignment was to rouse the German minority in Hungary
«approximately 300,000-—-against the people's democratic sys:
tem. . . 

The newspaper further reported that the fascists who had been
-«sent to Hungary on this special mission had already returned to
the Trauenstein camp. Munich journalists who tried to interview
them were -prevented from doing so_by representatives of the
American authorities. According to the -newspaper, fascists were
sent to Hungary from other parts. of West -Germany as well.
Among those sent, for example, were members of the “Union of
Hungarian Fighters,” members of the “Free Hungary Movement”
and similar organizations. After October 20, the newspaper went
-on, groups of armed Hungarians from Regensburg, Stuttgart and
other West German towns were seen in Munich and neighbouring
airﬁelds. In conversation with Munich residents these Horthyites
openly declared that they were returning to Hungary as “masters
of the country.” .

Uj Hungaria (New Hungary), a paper ut out by Hungarian
fascists in the West, was even more outspo en. The issue. for No-'
vemlier 2 stated: ' i

“The Hungarian emigration is in motion. Hungarians in

the Walka camp, one of the main assembly points for Hun-‘

garian refugees in West ‘Germany, are enthusiastically form-

ing command battalions. Their job, no matter what hap-.
pens and irrespective of the stand taken by the West, is to _

penetrate into Hungary. « .

“In London, too, volunteer battalions are being enrolled. . . .
Hungarian youths and émigré soldiers living in France,
Germany, Austria and other Euro’ an countries are setting
out on their own initiative for the ungarian border, or have
already crossed it. . . .” . A . i

The former Soviet citizen I. M. Bisaga, a Ukrainian nationalist
residing in West Germany, who has expressed’ the desire to re-

turn home, made a statement in Berlin concerning the activity

of the Ukrainian nationalist organizations in: the West. "Here is
an excerpt from his statement: " -

51

 

“A few days ago I decided on a big step in my life. This was
because I could no -longer listen to the lies and witness the crim-
inal activity conducted by Ukrainian nationalist organizations
in the West. . . . up -

“A few weeks prior to the outbreak of the Hungarian events
I learned from Vladimir Lenik, one of the active leaders of the
Ukrainian nationalist organization known as OUN, that Bandera,
Kashuba and Lenkavsky, carrying out the orders of their chiefs,
had formed up to ten columns on Austrian territory. The members
of these columns were recruited from the Ukrainian nationalist
organizations for subversion and sabotage. '

“In August t-his_y_ear, Bandera and Lenkavsky travelled to
Austria in order to verify the state of preparedness of the col-
umns. Upon returning to Munich they attended a meeting held
behind closed -doors and expressed satisfaction ‘with the prepa-
rations. V

“Shortly before the Hungarian events I accidentally learned
from Lenik that -the groups formed on Austrian territory in August"
would be -sent to Hungary for subversion. Lenik told me that we;
were on the eve of important events, and recommended me to go-
to Hungary. He assured me that I would not regret doing so,.
and that I would be wellpaid. . ..

“The day after the events started, Vladimir Lenik, -in—the guise-
of correspondent of the Ukrainian émigré paper Shlyakh Pere--
mohy (The Way to Victory), arrived at the Austro-Hungarian:
border from where he sent the OUN columns into Hungary. F rom‘
Munich and its vicinity Ivan Kashuba, leader of the Bandera or--
ganization, dispatched several more groups to the border. They
crossedit together with terrorist groups led by the Horthy gen--
eral Kisbarnaki. '

“They were told to sow panic, open fire on Soviet soldiers and".
ofﬁcers, attack them and wipe out their families. The above-men-
tioned groups, were supplied with leaﬂets in the'Russian, Ukrai--
nianand'Hungarian languages and, what is most important,
were -supplied with American arms.”

Hand Grenades Instead of Food

Despite the endeav-  .‘ ,. ,
our to shroud things  ’_-‘A,".‘-'.'_ 
in secrecy reports ’ T‘ ’
have appeared in the .
Western -press to the ;
effect that the Hunga-
rian insurgents were
receiving the military .
supplies that had been _
smuggled into the
country. ‘On Novem-
ber 4 the Hamburg u
Welt am Sonntag,
quoting a Hungarian ‘
woman, reported: '

“It was on Satur-
day we received the .-
ﬁrst food. A foreigner,  , 
who spoke ﬂuent ' "

- Hungarian delivered

to us four wagons loaded with tin containerts, and -said we should
be very cautious when opening the tins. It was only later that
we understood the meaning of these words. Two hundred of the
tins were ﬁlled with hand grenades.”
It is w-orth recalling that this particular issue of Welt am Sonn-
tag was quickly conﬁscated by the West German authorities.
An interesting report published in the New York World Tele-

‘gram and Sun in mid-November, stated that the West German

 

espionage organization, headed by Gehlen, a former Nazi general,
had played an active part in launching the counter-revolutionary
rising. This American correspondent said that well-informed
diplomatic circles had conﬁrmed that the Gehlen network had
played an important role in the rising. Incidentally, General Geh-
len is directly responsible to Chancellor Adenauer, and his organ-
ization is ﬁnanced by a special fund at the disposal of the Chan-
cell-or.

The suspicious linkage between the Hungarianevents and
foreign countries did not escape the attention of such a highly
authoritative politician as Prime Minister Nehru of India, who
stated in the Indian Parliament on November 19:

53

 

“I am convinced that the arms for the fascist elements who took
part in the Hungarian uprising were supplied from abroad.” _

Concerning earlier events we have already quoted the Daily
Mail correspondent who boasted: , A

“In recent days I had lunch with free people who had been
working for a ‘whole year to prepare the insurrection which broke
outthis week.” . ’

Defeated politicians and Horthy officers got busy. The_Novem-
bet 3 issue of the Paris Le Monde, commented: -

“The crowds of émigrés who streamed into Budapest have rein-

‘ forcedthe position of the Right-wing parties.”

The A.F.P. reported: a _ — .

“There are good grounds for believing that the anti-communist
resistance movement organized by General Kiraly, has powerful
support among some of the garrisons quartered in Western Hun-
gary, which during this week have concentrated at the completely
open Austrian ‘border. The organizations of Hungarian émigrés
vtvlho ﬂed to Austria and Germany undoubtedly took advantage of
t is.” ‘ - *

Reynolds News: “It Is Possible That an llilxtn-eme Fascist
Regime Will Be Set Up”

On October 31 the same agency reported: _

“It has now been conﬁrmed that extremist military organiza-
tions are being formed with great haste in Western Hungary
with a_.v_iew_§to taking political action, the consequences of which
it will be ~di,,ﬁﬁcult to foresee. These organizations have already
established contact with former ‘crusaders’ (the French corre-
_spondent applies this term to the fascist-“Arrow Cross” organi-
zation.——Ed.)*and ultra-nationalists in Austria. The events in
Hungary are reminiscent of the Horthy putsch in l9l9.”

On October»30 the Osterreichische Volksstimme reported:

“At some of the border stations the counter-revolution is ac-
tually forming headquarters. During the past few days numerous
counter—revolutionary agents, in the guise of Hungarian refugees,
crossed the border to ‘link up with the insurgents.’ According to

*a report in yesterday’s Bild Telegraph, they are in direct contact

with the counter-revolutionsaries in Salzburg. Transports with
columns of counter-revolutionaries from Bavaria and other parts

54

 

of West Germany are arriving systematically‘-via Austria.”

That was how foreignreaction worked, seeking, and,‘ let it be
said, not without success, -to take advantage of the justified d.is-
content of the masses, ‘seize leadership of the popular movement
and utilize it for a counter-revolutionary putsch. Foreign news-
paper correspondentsp wrote about the tempestuous events in
Hungary in the following terms: '

The London Reynolds News reported:

“The Hungarian ‘revolutionaries’ are Right-wing radicals. . ..
Hungarian fascists have streamed into the country from abroad.
It is quite possible that an extreme fascist regime will be set up
under the successors of Admiral Horthy and Szélasi.”

The Express, a Paris bourgeois newspaper, commented on No-
vember 9:-, . ' .

“On November I the Nagy Government obviously lost its grip.
Lacking practical power it made concessions both to the right
and to the left... . The maddened crowd threw off all restraint,
and political police and others were lynched. Right elements came
to the top in the provinces where the so-called national -councils,
to a greater or lesser degree, steered a Nazi course. New politi-
cal parties appeared on the scene.” ' p» ‘

On November 3 the Vienna correspondent of the London Times
described the situation as follows: V

“Last Saturday (October 27) the question was how much fur-
ther Mr. Nagy could be made to go in ‘meeting the demands of
the revolution. B'y yesterday he had yielded all along the line.”

The German provincial newspaper, Aallener Volkszeitung, com-
mented: V V
' “The ‘supreme tragedy of Imre Nagy was that at the decisive
moment the movement which paved the way for his coming to
power assumed a glaringly anti-communist and anti-Soviet char-
acter.~” . V

“Now Comes the Terror or the. Mob”

' Counter-revolutionary terror groups, taking advantage of the

-inactivity and policy of concessions pursued by the government,.

ste-p_ped up persecution of the supporters of the peoples democrat-
ic system. Many Western journalists have described in detail all
the horrors of the brutal White terror. By this time the trend. was
no longer in doubt. Characteristic in this respect is a report is-
sued by. Reuter’s:. ‘ » . _ ’ p ‘-

“Acoording to reliable information former members ofthe fas-

55

cist movement are trying to revive their party. The uprising, sup-
ported at ﬁrst by only weak groups of Right-wing elements, has
now reached the stage in which the victory of those callingfor
restoration of the Horthy regime is no longer impossible. Yester-

day saw the beginning of a man hunt in the streets of Budapest.-‘

Members of the security police are being killed like dogs, they
are hanging, from the-lamp-posts and balconies. All over the coun-
try scenes reminiscent of the return of the ‘Whites’ in 1919 are
being enacted. The swing of Hungarian‘ policy" to the Right is
justly alarming the democratic elements.” ‘

On November lthe Swedisl1_,St0ckh0lms Tzfdningen featured an
article by Gunnar,Kuml-ien: ‘ __

“In a small village along the road leading to Buda-pest, I wit-
nessed thelynching of a communist leader. The lynching took
place in the premises of the village council. I found myself in‘ the
midst of large crowds of peasants, soldiers and insurgents. Sud-
denly a man standing in front of me emitted a roar and the next
moment, like a wild beast, plunged forward and attacked another
man. This communist leader, of course, acted carelessly in show-
ing himself so early, and was recognized at once. E-vents devel-
oped with lightning speed. The lynching began. The Commu-
nist, his hands raised above his head, tried to defend himself, but
blows were rained upon his face, back and stomach, his assail-
ants kicked him savagely, blood streamed from his face until ﬁnal-
ly he -collapsed. The lynching was over.” ‘

On the same day, October 30, Gordon Shepherd, correspondent
of the Daily Telegraph, wrote: _

“As. night fell popular violence. unrestrained by any ‘regular
military or police units, has held Budapest in the grip. . . .‘ The re-
gime..seemed_ completely powerless to control the position and was
issuing. promises by the hour over Bud-apest radio.” ‘

On October 31 S. Delmer of the"Daily Express came to the
same conclusion: . »- p O ’

“Nowﬁcomes the terror of _the mob. The auxiliary police...
have joined the mobs in imposing on Budapest a system of lynch
law.” - :

f‘Mindszenty——the ‘Banner’ of the New Regime”_
_Immediately after this, the issue of Bild Telegraph for October

31 triumphant] featured the headline: “People’s‘D_emo,c_racy_in
Hungary Over hrown.” It then went onto saythat according to

56

 

I the information received “so long as Imre Nagy heads the govern- -

merit in Budapest, so long as there is a single Communist "in it,
It will not ﬁnd majority support among the insurgents. . . . The
anti-communist forces are convinced that victory is near.”

. In_ these circumstances when the shift in the balance of forces
in favour of the Right became clearer, the emergence of Cardinal_

‘Mindszenty attracted special attention. According to the Ham-

burg weekly Der Spiegel of November 7, “Mindszenty inspires
the ‘insurgents with the myth of anti-communist martyrs and
Catholic ideology.” » ‘ '

Later, the same newspaper wrote’: ’ l .

» “Clearly there can be no talk about Mindszenty being the ‘lead-
er of the uprising, but one can absolutely speak of him as the
banner of the new regime.” - ‘ _ '

The Daily Telegraph had this to say about Mindszenty:

“Most ob.server.s_ admit that with the further development of
events he will become one of the central ﬁgures. . . .” '

Well worthy of attention is a report in the New York Herald
Tribune for November 20, by Barrett McGurn who, after describ-
ing in detail the liberation of Mindszenty, -makes the following
comment: ' - '

“Hungarian.s, many Western experts felt, should have content-
edthemselves at least for a while with a coalition of Commu-
nists and non-Communists, headed by the -Communist but natio-
nalist Premier Imre Nagy. .  It soon became clear that what
Russia faced in Hungary was not the prospect of a Gomulka, a
nationalist Communist of the stripe of Poland's Premier, but an
Adenauer. . . . When the soldier.s released the primate, new voices
were heard. Some urged even that there be a ‘Mindszenty govern-
ment,’ an idea which horriﬁed some Western friends of the Hun-
garians. The cardinal’s political ideas, these Westerners objected,
were of ‘the 16th century. . . .’ Others urged Mindszenty at least
for membership in a super-council of trusted national leaders who
could serve as asort of regency, nominating Premiers and Ca-
binets. . .. Some of the cardinal’s closest -supporters ‘were frank
about what they wanted from the UN: the instant arrival of a UN
mission,‘par'a.chuted medicine, food, arms.”

Thus, even from the Western -press reports one gets an idea
of the road along which the counter-revolutionary forces wanted
to take, the country. At the same time these reports make it per-
fectly clear that what took place was not a coincidence of fortui-
tous factors, but a result of subversive activity long prepared and

Soviet Republic ‘in 1919. Allen Dulles, brother of the U.S. State
Secretary and head of American intelligence, stated that he had
previous knowledge of the preparation of the rising in Hungary.
On October 25, two days after the beginning of the rising, the
correspondent of the Daily Mail wrote: “In recent days I had
lunch with free people.who had been working for a whole year to
prepare the insurrection which broke out this week.” The answer
to the question: who prepared and organized the rising and how,
will be given in the documentary material to be published later.
There is, however, no doubt that_ on October 30, when the govern-
ment ordered the cease-ﬁre, the counter-revolutionary forces had
already come out into the open. Mass bloody reprisals had started.
‘This pamphlet gives a number of iacts, testimony of eye-witnesses
zandseveral photographs. To give an idea of the scale of the
atrocities committed by the ‘counter-revolution," it will not be
superﬂuous to quote, besides the facts publishedin this pamphlet,

the reports of the Budapest correspondents of Western bourgeois

papers. Gordon Shepherd, Daily Telegraph correspondent, wrote

‘on October 30: “As night fell popular violence, unrestrained by

any regular military or police units, has held Budapest in the
grip. . .. The regime seemed completely powerless to control the
position. . . .,” S. Delmer wrote in the Daily Express on October 31:
“Now ‘comes the terror of the mob. . .. The auxiliary police . .
have joined the mobs in imposing on Budapest a system of lynch
law." (The correspondent refers here to detachments of the so»
called Na-tional Guard.) -

_ The government was completely helpless. All it did was to
reshuffle almostevery day and drift more and more to the Right.
When the peril of counter-revolution became obvious, from Octo-
ber 29-30,‘ not a word, notan appeal was heard from it calling for a
ﬁght against the peril of counter-revolution, when ordinary workers
and peasants, Communists, ofﬂcer-s, officials, State Security officers
and soldiers in security detachments were hanged, shot or tortured
to death in the streets, the premises of Party organizations were
assaulted, dwellings were broken into, children and aged people
were murdered. In an article published on Novembere20' by the
New York Herald Tribune, Barrett -McGurn gave the following
assessment of the’ situation in Hungary: “Hungarians, many
Western experts felt, should have contented themselves at least
for a while with a coalition of Communists and nor.1~Communists,
headed by the Communist but nationalist Premier Imre Nagy. . . .”
It soon ‘became clear, the newspaper continued, that the order 0
the day in Hungary was the coursefollowed by Adenauer.

Cardinal
Mindszenty’s Participation
in Counter—Revolutionary

Machinations

Cardinal Mindszen-
ty was arrested at the
end of 1948 on the
charge of being lead-
er of an organization
which aimed at over-
throwing the people’s
democratic sysstem.
Cardinal Mindszenty
achieved notoriety as
one of the leaders of i
the forces working to
restore the bourgeois-
landlord regime, and,
as such, was tried
and sentenced.

In 1955, at the re-
quest of the Episcopa-
cy, the Hungarian Government agreed, in View of the state
of Mindszenty’s health, to release him. Since then he had been
under house arrest in the Fels6petény‘Cast1e. This circumstance,
, A-naturally, made it easier for him to maintain contact with the
 outside world.

The Horthy leaders of the counter-revolutionary forces, by oust-v
ing the Nagy Government, wanted to advance Mindszenty, tem~
porarily at least, as a political leader “standing above parties,”
and at the same time capable of rallying the forces of the

. Catholic Church. As early as October 29. and 30, they began to

agitate for a “Mindszenty government,” and even held a meeting
under this slogan in Rakoczi Square. Simultaneously Mindszenty
was released from house arrest and brought to Budapest.

On October 30 he was taken‘ from the Felsiipetény-Castle and
installed in the barracks of a tan-k regiment in Retség. Next day,
October 31, he was taken to Budapest.

Upon arriving in the capital Mindszenty lost no time in getting‘
down to business and on the evening of November 3- broadcast
a “call” in which, notwithstanding all its restraint, he openly set.
forth the aims of the counter-revolution.

The Cardinal described the people's democratic system as a
“bankrupt regime.” He declared the victory of the counter-revo~
lution to be an accomplished fact. Although he refrained, from
speaking openly about the plans of the counter-revolutio-naries to
restore the landlord-capitalist system, Mindszenty said that the
new system would be based on private property. He said speciﬁ-
caally that an end must be put- to the socialist system based on
common ownership, the people’s rule must be abolished.

Mindszenty, like the other leading ﬁgures of thebourgeois res-
toration, had to tread warily in view of the fact that Soviet troops
were posted on the approaches t-o Budapest and the news that.
Soviet reinforcements had arrived. For this reason he. did not
fully explain his attitude. “In my call I deliberately refnained from
mentioning other details,” he said, “because what I did say was
enough.” Yes, that was enough for the former capitalists, land-T

lords and other reactionary elements who had come to the fore.
He did not go into “detail” about doing away with the results
of the land reform, about returning the nationalized enterprisses,
because he preferred not to tell the people about this. The Car-
dinal, however, did not refrain from making threats. He hinted
that “there should be responsibility before the law along all.
lines.’’ This was nothing less than proclamation of a general cru-
sade against the supporters of proletarian rule. From this, and
also from his vague allusions to the restoration, it was perfectly
clear that 'a herald of the counter-revolution had openly appeared.
in the political arena under the cover of clerical garb. This was
appreciated not only by former bankers, factory owners and land--

59

 

 

  

lordsl but also by the more politically conscious sections of -the
peop e.‘ . »t- _
Mindszenty’s speech was not simply a manifestation of his
personal activity. By this time the “Catholic People’s~Party," the
“People's Democratic Party,’’' the “Christian Front,” ‘-‘The League
of the Sacred Heart,” the “Christian Youth League,” various
-Christian youth organizations, the Horthyite “non-party” boy
scouts organization and‘ others, had appeared on the scene. The
Horthy counter-revolutionary forces unfurled their tattered ban-
ner and launched an offensive in order to seize the leading role

~ and oust the more democratic elements of the bourgeois restora-

 

tion. To achieve their political aims, they formed armed groups.

 

Cardinal Mindszenty, with whose help they calculated’ on Win»

ning the masses of religious people, became the leading ﬁgure
of these forces and was brought to the forefront.

. However, the emergence of Mindszenty was warning for.those
ﬁghting to expurgate the people’s rule and maintain it. Mindszen-
ty’s speech was a sort of a signal which warned them that it -was
necessary to launch a counter-offensive against the forces of
bourgeois restoration and to uphold popular rule.

Takingadvantage of the events of October 23, partly according
to a previously prepared plan, partly on the initiative of adven-
turers who had emerged in the meantime, various counter-revo-
lutionary detachments were raised one ‘after another. In Budapest,
they divided the districts of the city amongst themselves and
began to round up the sons of the people.

‘Thus, the maintactical features of the counter-revolutionary
‘rising and the activities of the counter-revolutionaries were the
following: .

1) A campaign was started to destroy all the members of the
State Security in order fully to eliminate the units of the State
Security Service, whose duty was to defend the people's power.
The government complied with the ‘demand for the abolition of the
State Security Service. This was correct, for a single state "police
is better able to carry out the important task of defending socialist
law and popular power. However, the tactics elaborated by the.
counter-revolutionaries consisted in laying the responsibility for
the actual crimes committed by a few hundred, at the most, of- the
members of the State Security, most of whom had already been
dismissed, and many arrested, on thousands of members of the
State Security, mainly ordinary soldiers doing their military
service ‘in’ security units, and in. arousing hostility towards
them. ’ " '

2) The counter-revolutionaries freed fascists and war and com-
mon criminals. Thus, from the Marianosztna Prison they released
the former Horthy ministers and war criminals Istvén Antal,
Antal Kunder and others. But a more important factor for the
rebels were the thousands upon thousandsof common criminals,

who joined counter-revolutionary detachments. _

3) They started a universal hunt for the leading force of t
popular power, the working-class party, with the purpose of
completely destroying it. During this campaign the building of
the Budapest Party Committee in Republic Square was destroyed
by artillery tire on October 30. Former Horthy ofﬁcers, ex-
gendarmes and others, who had managed to get into various
enterprises in preceding years, put on the national cockade and
tried to pass as revolutionaries, agitating against the factory
_Party functionaries, in order to shatter the Party organizations
in those enterprises or at least to paralyze them.

4) A broad campaign of calumny was started «against the-local
representatives of authority, workers in the local councils-and

5

 

 

 

economic executives. In many oases the counter-revolution
aries applied the tactics of “joining in the movement. for the
expurgation of the popular power.” But a few days later, when the
counter—revolutionary forces felt themselves victorious in Buda-
pest and in many provinces, they threw off their “socialist” mask
and started to undermine the whole state system of people’s
democracy with the open aim of restoring the bourgeois
system. - - g _

One of those persons was a man known as “Uncle Szabo,” who
had taken up a job at the Ganz Electric Engineering Works. This
“Uncle Szabo,” a former Horthyist gendarmerie officer, became
the organizer and leader of a group of rebels in Szena Square.
Kéroly Tibolda, son of the former editor-in-chief of the pro-Hitler
newspaper, Uj Magyarorszdg, contrived to become a member of
the workers’ council of the same works, and later even its secre~
tary; so did Maté Denes, a former bodyguard of Horthy, and

others.

5) One of the most important tactical features of the counter-
revolutionaries was to penetrate as quickly and on as large a
scale as possible into the governmental apparatus, particularly
the command of the armed forces in order to seize leadership or
at least to paralyze their activity.

While the Imre Nagy Government was in power, the Parlia-
ment was filled with former Horthy politicians, aristocrats,
monarchists, ofﬁcers of the palace guards and other raffle. Under
pressure from them, the government appointed as Commander-in-
Chief of the Armed Forces the former Horthy General Staff Officer
Béla Kiraly, a relative (husband of the niece) of the infamous
fascist leader Gyula Giimbos. Former Horthy ofﬁcers streamed
into the Defence Ministry. The inﬂux increased as the composi-
tion 'of the government veered more land more openly
towards the’ consolidation of the supporters of ca bourgeois
restoration. ' ‘ - z

6) The invasion from the West of fascist émigrés played a
major role in increasing the counter-revolutionary forces. Emigré
organizations, maintained on dollars, found means of penetrating
into certain International Red Cross bodies‘ and making use of
some Red Cross planes and vehicles transporting medicaments
and dressings, in order to smuggle in arms and ammunition and
also to bring counter-revolutionaries into Hungary. Of the one
hundred Red Cross aeroplanes which arrived in Budapest before
November, more than forty brought about’5OO counter-revolu-tion-'

‘varies. Other big armed groups ‘penetrated into our country across
the western border.

The Hungarian Government, hoping to see a more favourable
peaceful international situation and desiring to promote it, had
previously given orders to remove all the technical barriers on
our frontiers and to clear the mine ﬁelds. This was completed on
the,Western frontier in the second half of September. In their

preparations for the conspiracy the Western subversive organiza-

tions immediately proﬁted by this important and peace-loving
gesture of the Hungarian Government in order to bring an
increasing number of their agents into the country across that

frontier and to accelerate the preparations for the rebellion. In the

early days of the rebellion they availed themselves of the opportu-
nity of the eased crossing of the frontier in order to bring in

bigger organized groups to reinforce the interior forces of counter-

revolution. ’ »

7) As a result of the helplessness of the Imre Nagy Govern-
ment, its continual drift to the-' Right and then its disintegration,
the extensive, although atﬁrst disguised, activity of the counter-
revolution became more and more open due to the quick increase
of itsarmed forces. The various parties and organizations* which
stood for a bourgeois restoration sprung up like mushrooms, and
in the last week of the Imre Nagy Government they became
dominant in the political life of the country. This was reﬂected in
the appearance of a host of new newspapers. On October 29.one
of the rebel groups, headed by Dudés, seized the editorial offices
of the newspaper Szabad Nép and from the beginning of Novem-
ber the newspaper could not be published. All the other news-
papers, the overwhelming majority of which more or less agitated
against the Communists and the Soviet Union, were freeto
appear. On October 31 Cardinal Mindszenty was brought in
triumph to Budapest from t-he Felsfipeteny Fort. He openly called
for the complete elimination of the people’s democratic system.

Counter-revolution already felt itself in the saddle, although
the presence of Soviet troops extremely alarmed its leading
politicians and this circumstance restrained them to a certain
extent. They requested and waited and hoped for the arrival of
armed forces from the West and of United Nations troops. This
would have been a most important guarantee of the restoration
of the bourgeois regime. The counter-revolutionary rising threat-
ened Hungary with the overthrow_ of the people’s democratic
