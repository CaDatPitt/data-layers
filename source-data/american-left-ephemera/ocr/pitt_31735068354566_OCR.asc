ings‘ approving wage and.re,>classi-
‘fication increases totalling 15-17
cents an hour in three out of the
four major non-ferrous chains.
The “OK" stamp went on the
wage clauses in settlements with
the Anaconda chain in Montana,

- Nevada and New Mexico, and the
Phelps-Dodge chain in Arizona.
‘As the Board took up American
Smelting & Refining Co. settle-
ments»-late" in the week, it began
by approving those in Leadville
and Denver, Colorado, and San
Francisco, California._ .
.EXCEPT FOR two “fringe”
issues, the 1951 settlement made
' by Local 82 with the American
Zinc Co. at East St. Louis, Illi-
nois, also got the Board’s bless-
ing, as did those in three major
copper companies in the Miami,"

' fining, Miami Copper, and Inspi-
ration Consolidated.

. The Board’s action meant these
companies could readily make out
backpay checks for retroactive
wage increases well before Christ-
mas. It was estimated that retro-
active paychecks amounting to
from $50 to $300 would be pock-
eted by workers in the ,,“WSB
approv ” operations in plenty of
time for Christmas shopping.

Calling attention to the fact
that Mine-Mill has “broken the
ice" for workers in all basic in-
dustries, Int’l. president John
"Clark said, “We are proud of the

. That question is answered
in just a few words by In-,
ternational vice president,

. Orville Larson, who says the
reason is “the greatest pe-
tition drive in the history of
Mine-Mill.” And Larson
adds that our union, ‘along
with a few other progressive
independent unions, ‘‘,are
carrying the ball on the
"bust-the-freeze’ campaign.”

“Small businessmen ‘from little

l pend upon the miners for their

portant element in the campaign.

'Even members of Chamber of

Commerce and ‘mayors of small

[pl/addingfon ofe./5
By Hermon Cloﬁ .

I am an eye-witness to one of the greatest campaigns of grass
roots mobilization ever conducted by any trade union.‘ . _ .

Every member of our union would have gotten a terrific kick
being in Washington the last few days at the~Wage_- Stabihzation
Board. As you walked into the office of thepublic members dealing
with our cases, you could see the desks piled high with telegrams;

- some of them four feet long, containing the names of every one of e

our members who signed in a local. _
There were telegrams from businessmen and from mayors. Let-

ters from governors and senators. In addition, many congressmen

from ourareas put personal calls into the board asking. for action on
our cases.

‘ﬂrﬁik 0»

ANDIWHAT RESULTS! In one night, in a matter of 21/, hours,  

over 40 Copper cases were approved dealing with monetary ‘matters-
Kennecott, Phelps-Dodge, Internatiogal Smelting, Miami Copper and
Inspiration. In V AS&R, part of the package was approved and part
was being held up for a few days,_because one of the industry mem-

bers, perhaps to be just a little ornery, wanted more area information I
on the classification settlements at AS&R. But they will be approved V

in a few days. The campaig-nassures it. _ . _
The Anaconda cases arrived in Washington on the mormng of

Thursday, December 6, and‘ were approved by ‘Friday evening,_Decem- .

ber the 7th. The American Brass Company cases were expected last
week. After AS&R_and the American Brass cases, we will have the
bulk of Copper and Brass approved. . . » ' ‘
Concurrently, we. are pressing the board and they are rounding
*' up all Lead and Zinc cases. We will get action on a group basis, the
same as we did in Copper. . . .
. Once AS&R, American Brass and the ‘major Lead and Zinc cases
have been approved, we have been informd that the board will no
longer have to approve individual cases that may be coming up in the
next few weeks. Rather, an executive officer, of _the’ board will be
given power to make what is known as an “Administrative Ruling.”
This means that any of,the smaller cases which’ ‘are now en route to
the board, can be decided /simply by an approval’ ‘action of a staff
member of the board. That -is, as long as the se°t_t_lement conforms to
the “Big Four.” A’

it ‘A’ 75!

WE DO NOT MEAN that the campaign is over or that we should
slacken the pace. Telegrams and letters from everyone in the com-
munity must continue to come in. We must guarantee the approval
of every issue down. to the last case. . .. I - V r

‘ it ‘A’ 3'5: ‘ ‘  e -

WE BELIEVE it is understood, but nevertheless’ itfsliould be
clariﬁed, that at the moment, neither pensions nor insurance settle-L’
ments have been approved. The board has been discussingipolicy on
these two matters and it may be that even by the time this _~ is pub-
lished,_ _the decision bythe board on these‘l_two items will have been
made public. While wedonot know for certain, the grapevine has it,
that insurance and pensions will practically be decontrolled, ‘except for
certain top limits. Even based on decisions in the past, we are sure
that our insurance and pension plans are safe in any event.’

ALICE ARM, B. C. —- A smashing
victory has been chalked up by mem-
bers of Mine-Mill Local 906 in the
five-week strike against the Torbrit
Silver Mines.

The strike was settled with an agree-
ment which increases wages by 27
cents an hour across the board, re-
troactive to September 1. In addition,
there is a provision for $1 a diiy
retroactive pay from May 17 to

September 1. ,

The vacation clause provides for 10
:days at the end of one year and 12
days at the end of two years. The
pact also provides for six statutory
holidays. _

Negotiating for the union were Or-
rin Dittogand F. McIntosh, assisted by
Int-’l rep. Barney McGuire and I re-
gional director Harvey Murphy.

Local 906 leaders asserted that there
had been a magnificent response to

1 Cosf of living up 20%:
since January, I950-UE

NEW YORK (FP)—Tl.'cost of liv-

' ing has increased more than 20% since

the wage freeze base of January 1950,
according to studies just concluded by
the United Electrical Radio & _Ma-
chine Workers research staff. For the
same period the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics reported an increase of only
12.6%.

Results of the latest union study
were announced by President Albert

“Fitzgerald, who said the union would

issue its own privately compiled index it
every three months. The UE index was

first publishedin April 1951 in a re- a
port - charging that the BLS index, ~

mainstay of the wage freeze, was a.
fraud.-. _

At later hearings before a congres-
sional committee, the UE was joined
by the AFL and CIO in pointing to

faults and omissions in the BLS meas- -’

urement  of living cost ‘increases.

‘ _TH‘E‘U’E cost-of-living index for Oc-
tobéri 1951 stands at 276.1 (1939 equals
100).:A1llowance for the payroll tax in-
crease effective Nov. 1, but for none
of the other liivng cost increases be-

‘ tween’ October and November, will

raise the UE index to 278.4, or 20.3%
above the first quarter of 1950 and

-5% above the index for January 1951. '

By contrast, the BLS consumer price
index, which emits federal, state and
city direct taxes and other factors in
higher living costs, registered .._only

' 188.9 in October 1951, an increase of,

12.6% over the first quarter of 1950.
Fitzgerald called. attention to the

separate UE food cost index for Octo-

ber 1951, which stands at 818. In

Stern pointed out \tl:rat Mine-Mill

has a deep interest in wages paid in
other ‘industries in this area because it
represents. one of the largest groups
of organized workers in the Rocky

The Mine—Mill researcher introduced
figures from a -recent survey‘ show-
ing that even‘ with two members of
the family working in the ‘fields,
average -earnings of migrant sugar
workers in Colorado come to only
$1424 ‘a year. He also showed that the

‘NEW YORK, N. Y. —— Leadership
meetings held in New York, New Jer-
sey and Connecticut recently came to
the conclusion that action has to be

’ taken on_ two major problems that are

hitting our membership in the pocket-
' book: namely, the wage freeze and the

metal shortage.

;.-Mine-Mill leaders in the three areas

examined the situation and found

themselves in this cockeyed predica-

ment: The same so-called government
“controls that are permitting prices to

climb right out of their reach are also '

denying them wage increasethat were
. negotiated months ago or, in some
cases, encourage employers . to sit
tight_ on offers that wouldn’t buy a
cup of coffee.
While the Wage Stabilization Board
playsthe fiddle under the baton of the
big corporations, the wage increases

negotiated months ago are being wiped ‘

out by new jumps in the cost of liv-
ing._ For example, U.S. Metals workers
in Local 837, Carteret, New Jersey,
~negotiated a 20 cent package last
August 26th, on the eve of the na-
tional copper strike, when the BLS
Cost-of-living index ’ stood -at 185.6.

Today the index stands at 187.4 and,

"V still the US. Metals workers don’t
' have a penny of their package.

WSB OFFICIALS give their excuses
in high-class double talk, but the real
reason is that the Carteret agreement

contains precedent-setting fringe is-
sues which the industry doesn’t like,
such as four weeks vacation for 25
year men _ (they already had three
.__Weeks ‘for 15" years), an extra day
off. at Christmas, making seven paid
holidays, and full pay for 13 weeks
'-for workers injured in"the plant.

Profits and prices can rise‘ out‘-of

sight, but these corporation minded

b'ureaucrats.see only their single sol- ’

emn duty: to apply their Congress-
given veto to contracts freely arrived
at between union and company.

While this sad farce is being played
out in the never-never land of Wash-
ington as wellas in stalled negotiations
where the wage freeze plays the ma-
jor part, the non-ferrous metals work-
ers in District 6 are being. doubly

DENVER-—Support for thef§14-
month-old M_ine—Mill _ strike L against
Empire Zinc company-at Bayard, N. M.,
will be .one of the major activities of"
the National Association of ,Me_xi_can-
Americans (ANMA) in coming weeks
and until the strike is won. Thiswas
decided at at meeting, here this month‘
of the ANMA natio,nal_icomm'ittee‘._ -

Another ANMA abjective is to. or-
ganize a national boycott of the prod-
ucts of Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Com-
pany. The reason ‘is a slanderous
caricature ~ of the Mexican people on
the Judy Canova show, sponsored. by

this company.

Two Mine-Mill members took part in
the meeting. They were Jose M. Ca-
macho of Tucson, Ariz., and Lorenzo
Torres ofaBayard, N‘. M. '

“The importance of the Bayard strike
to the three and a half million Mex-
ican-Americans cannot be over-empha-‘
sied,” . said ANMA president Alfredo
Montoya. ‘_“This strike is being watched
with the greatestinterest by the Mex-
ican peop.le everywhere. Most of the
strikers are. of’ Mexican origin. They
are striking for elementary trade union
rights, such as the eight-hour day and
paid holidays.

“The stubborn refusal of Empire
Zinc Company to grant these benefits,
which are. enjoyed by‘ every other
union : in the area and most unions
throughout the country, "an be inter-
preted only as an attempt to break.
this: union._ It .is- therefore an attack 7

" Mexican-American people nationally,
. will continue to increaseits support of
the Bayard strike until it ends in vic-
tory for our‘ striking brothers.”
In connection with the Colgate-Palm-
'-olive-Peet bbycott, Montoya explained
that “The character Pedro in this show
is presented as a lazy, ignorant clown.
This stereotyped slander-is a part of
the pattern of oppression of Mexican-

Americans. Everywhere that a nation- ‘

al group is subject to discrimination
and_ prejudice, this is ‘justified’ by pic-
turing them as inferior, child-like peo-
ple who are incapable" of first-class
citizenship. ‘

“For this reason-, the use of ‘the’

character Pedro in the Judy7'Canova
—. show is a direct attack on the Mexican-
_American people—th_eir job rights and
their rights as citizens. The fact that
the part of Pedro_is played by a Mex-
ican, Mel Blank, does not mitigate the
slander. ~  i f
“We call upon all. whobelieve, that
people are ‘created equal ’a1id should
have equal- rights and oppo1=t"unities’in
America to express their resentment
of the Judy Canova show’ directly to
the sponsoring company in letters and

by refusing to buy products advertised 

‘on the show.”

The. ANMA committee also adopted

a “national plan of actiorf and a cam-

paign to be carried through to insure

Mexican representation on all levels of

city, state and national. government.”

Part of the plan is “an intensive. cam-

V vpaign of registration’ of all Mexican
voters.”- ‘

By Graham Dolun

Next steps in the mine-Mill, cam-
paign to completely shatter the wage
freeze were being planned in local
unions across the country last week
following the union’s historic victory
in winning approval by the National

.Wage Stabilization Board of wage
increases and reclassifications nego-
.tiated with employers after the na-
tional strike.

‘With the wage freeze looking like
a puddle of slush after a January
thaw, Mine-Mill was gearing its break-
" M the-freeze campaign to the twin jobs

. S e of -winning WSB approvalfor pensions
 ‘and insurance plans and joining hands
 with the rest of the labor movement
‘ in a united campaign to bury the wage

freeze and phoney “stabilization” once

andfforall.

Tactics for the next steps remain
approximately the same as those used
in winning government approval of
wage increases. A high degree of co-
ordination in the filing of petitions
with WSB and continuing demands for
complete approval 01' the union’s de-
mands are the two main factors.

INTERNATIONAL officers urged
last week that all local unions step
up their campaigns against the wage

‘ freeze. Delegations to congressmen,
senators,_ governors, state, county and
local officials should be planned in ef-

 ‘ ‘ forts t6 have these ‘political leaders
’ join in‘-, demands that the wage stabili-

ezationqetup be junke’d..

Mine-Mill's drive has '~ proved that

A ,,gwage:“stabilization” is a'farce. In ad-
' .di1_:ie1r, many local leaders are pointing

, outthat the Korean war is practically

 'tio1’t“»,-can’ be justified on grounds of

 5, . pated."

 thebattle against wage_ stabilization
 is yet to come. Demands that CIO
 _.and 'AFL labor representatives resign
 from the WSB are increasing daily.
 Mine-Mill .members and locals can be

:. ..pai§'p.=.i.-f',;CIO and AEL local unions

Continuing the campaign against
the whole stabilization setup is con-
sidered the natural outgrowth of win-
ning WSB approval for Mine-Mill in-

creases. Now that the way is paved»

in WSB for other unions to file their
cases and have reasonable assurance
that they will receive favorable action,
Mine-Mill members stand ‘to gain even
further if unions like Steel, Auto and
others further smash the fwage freeze.

It was pointed out by Mine-Mill
leaders last week that Mine-Mill cases
are coming up again. K_en_necott bar-

,gaining, for example, is due to begin
soon on 1952 wage reopener demands.
Just as Mine-Mill's victory will aid
Steel, Auto and others, so will vic-
tories by these unions be of benefit
to Mine-Mill in the coming year. In
short — the job of smashing the wage
freeze permanently is a‘_job for’ united
labor action in every community of
America.  

A PLAN OF WORKi'for Mine-Mill
locals was suggested by the interna-
tional officers, as follows":

‘1. Begin now t6 arrange community

mass meetings against" the wage freeze
to which can be invited nationally-
known labor leaders and other speak-
ers. The international office can be‘ of
assistance in promoting the‘ meetings
and arranging for speakers. Contact
the international officetoday. 

2. The rallies should be joint1y.sup-

ported and promoted wherever possible.‘

AFL, CIO, railroad and independent
unions can be induced to help hold
public protests against the wage freeze.

3. Call , on congressmen, senators,
governors and other political leaders
to support the «drive against the farce
of -wage stabilization. V

4. Renew petition and post card
drives to President Truman and the
Wage Stabilization Board, demanding
an end to wage freezing and urging ap-
proval of remaining Mine-Mill “pack-
age” demands, such as pensions and
insurance funds. ’  .

5. Adopt resolutions. —Get other
groups to ‘do likewise. . _.

6. Encotlrage CIO and AFL local
unions to send resolutions and tele-
grams to Philip Murray, president of
CIO, and William Green, presitlent of
AFL, demanding that labor representa-
tives cease participating in National

Wage Stabilization Boar .; .
7. Purchase newspaperiand radio ad-

‘ti

Mill locals in Buffalo "sent thousands
of penny postcards to President Tu-
man demanding that he “take immedi-
ate steps to end the wage freeze, lift
the tax burden from the people and
roll back prices.”,

As another part of its “bust ‘the
freeze” campaign, ABC Local 593 sent
a delegation to the office of Congress-
man Butler. They gave the Congress-
man all the facts and figures in their
case, and he agreed to write a letter
in their support to Nathan Feinsinger,
chairman of the WSB. His letter, sent
last week,_said:

“Having worked as a worker myself

and knowing the conditions in this‘.

area for ‘many years, I believe that ex-
isting _pr veiling conditions demand

TRAIL, B. lC.——Auxiliary Local 131
has jumped into the big discharge

 . grievance of Mine-Mill Local 480 with

both feet. Along with its branches in
Rossland and Castlegar, Local 131 got
out a hard-hitting leaflet, demanding
that the company -“Put the Stewards
Back to Work——No More Unjust firing

I of our Union Brothers!”

“We, the women, have a special
Itake-' in our Union,” the leaflet said.
““It’s the ‘machinery that keeps the
bread and butter on our tatblesil It
fights for the rights of our rot ers
on the job, just is it is doing at this
very moment, against the Company’:
discriminatory actions against three

 stop stewards and 14, carpenters. Our

union has been fighting on two fronts

' “for the past two years, against the

Steel Raiders and the Company, and
we are sick and tired of this situation.”

, Mt. Vernon Diecast

MT. VERNON, N.Y.——A.fter lengthy ‘

‘negotiations with the -Mt. Vernon Die
Casting Corporation, the Local 701
negotiating committee, headed by pres-
ident Moe Mazer, finally received an
offer of 3 cents across the_ board for
the 150 workers. When this was re-

ted, the company ‘raised its offer

“"‘ o a nickel for non-incentive workers
and 8 cents for die makers, but el1m- ,

inated any offer for the incentive
workers. . _

As a result, the latter had no in-
centive whatsoever to produce and for’
more than a week have been barely
able to make base rat-es. 'With re-
markable unity, the die casting opera-
tors and other piece workers have
been utterly unable to maintain their

. ‘previous rate of production of atleast

25% above base rate. ,

At the same time, the problems in-
yolved in negotiations have so agrra-
lated all the workers that frequent

‘ shop meetings are necessary and have

been held regularly three and four
times a week during company time.
It is felt that if a reasonable offer
was made by the company that in-
eentive earnings would soon be restored

to normal and a fullcproduction week 4

Reject ‘last offer’
e—gel a better one

BISHOP, Calif. — Here’: one-case

"where Taft-Hartley injunction proce-

dures were not able to help the boss!
i'1‘he tale goel<1*~»back to last —-August,
when Mine-Mill's nationwide strike be-
gan. Workers at U; S. Vanadium Co.
here were among’ the 60,000 members-
of Mine-Mill who‘ walked out -and set
-up picket‘ lines. =. V
When President Truman ordered -
and got -- his..'I‘.a.ft-Hartley, injunction,
the U. S. Vanadium workers went back,
and the negotiating committee went
back into bargaining‘ with the com-
pany. Negotiations dragged on. Finally
,in mid-November,’ the NLRB conducted
a vote among the workers on the com-
pany’s “last offer,” as required by
‘Taft-Hartley. --
The offer on which the workers
voted came to 19.2 cents in wages and
reclassifications. By an overwhelming
majority, the offer was rejected. be-

cause the workers didn’t like the re-‘

classification‘ provisions. '
Even as they rejected the company's

last offer, . the workers set a strike‘

deadline for November 24, the date on
which the Taft-Hartleyinjunction was
scheduled to expire automatically.

Then came the payoff. Within 8
few hours before the strike deadline,
the company, came through, with a
settlement in line with what the work-
ers wanted. It came to an even 20
cents an hour, divided between 11
cents in a general wage increase and
9 cents in féclassifications. This time
the workers" in Local 844 voted to ac-
cept the coinpany’s. “last offer.”

BAYARD, N. M. — The fourteen-
month strike against the Empire Zinc
Company at nearby Hanover was still
solid last week, ‘despite the filing of
a $25,000 libel suit against Amalga-
mated Local 890,. as well as the is-
suance of another contempt citation
against four women pickets.

The libel suit was brought by Conn
Brown, Grant County clerk, who
claimed that the Local 890 newspaper
—— “Union Worker” — i had printed
his picture with a caption describing
him as an E-Z company gunman.

Meantime, Simon Molina, E-Z, strike
relief ‘committee chairman, disclosed
that the union has worked out a “Fos-
ter Parent Plan” for the care of school
children of E-Z strikers. “Because
these "children have been in actual

’‘-.want for many necessities all young
1 people should have, sister locals of the

“’I‘nt’l Union of Mine, Mill & Smelter

Under the plan, each ‘local is asked
to adopt two children at an estimated
cost of 50 cents per day for each
child. Only school children are eligible

‘Too many bosses.‘ so
Hayden workers strike

HAYDEN, Ariz. — Workers at the
American Smelting &' Refining Co.
smelter here were holding tight last
week in their strike against the com-
;_pany’s program of discriminatory fir-

‘ ingand promotion.
.The company had been engaged for
some time in a drive to remove mem-

 bers of Local 886 from some of the

best jobs, inclding masons, mechanics
and skimmers, and putting “foremen”
into these jobs. When it began to look

V as though there would soon be more

_“for_emen” than workers, the workers
decided it was time to call a halt.
The walkout began November 27, and
was still in progress, with picket lines
solid, at presstime for THE UNION.

,’Sit-down’ wins in

r i ‘ J j ‘ ;AS&R grievance case

BAYARD, N. M.—A three-day “sit-
down” against the American Smelting
& Refining Company’s lead-zinc mine
at _Vanadium by members of Local 890
has resulted in a total victory for the
union. ,

The union met with AS 8: R man-
agement early this month to make up_
blasting primers, a job outside his clas-
sification. The company refused, and
in a ‘meeting that night, the AS&R
workers voted to stage a sit-down proj-
ect to win the grievance.

‘ The men reported to the job during
the next two days, but did not go down
"to the diggings. On the third day, the
company offered this settlement: full
‘reinstatement of the discharged em-

5 2 ployee with no loss in pay; agreement
-‘ that the company will not require me-

tormen to make up blasting primers;
. agreement that no worker will be re-

, ,,_ , qnired to perform work outside his own

A veteran miner remembers“

A copper camp died last week.

And the story of the town's death,
published in some Canadian and Rocky
Mountain newspapers, brought a remi-

niscent gleam into the ?eyes of John‘
Clark, Mine-Mill International presi-

dent. _ a _.
The town was Phoenix, British
’ Columbia, where Granby Consolidated
Mining & Smelting Co. took 13'/; mil-

lion tons of copper ore_out in 20 years.

between 1899 and 1919. The last resi-
dent of the town was William Henry.
Bambury, buried December 6 in the
cemetery on the hillside near the old
copper mine’s glory hole.

John Clark joined Local 8 of the old
Western Federation of Miners , when
he went to work at the Phoenix mine
in_ 1908. In his spare time, he drove
the stage coach from Phoenix to

Greenwood; and later moved to Green- v

wood where he also drove the stage to
and from Phoenix.

JACK LIKES to tell how he ran the
mail by stage to Phoenix from Green-
wood \on Sundays with a young lady
named Malvina L'Heureux sitting at
his side-—out for a Sunday “buggyride”
behind a four-horse team! '

While in Greenwood, Jack worked
in the Mother Lode Mine. When the

WFM struck the mine it was shut
down—never to reopen again. After

, the strike, Jack moved back to Phoenix

for two more years, and it was in 1914

. ‘that he married the young lady named

L’Heureux, who now is known and
loved all over the International union
as “Vina.” A year or so later, the
‘Clerks moved on to ‘Eholt Junction,
‘ where Jack worked at the Emma mine,
and later they came down into Mon-
tana. /

It was during the period-that Jack

A was in Phoenix that the camp's weekly

newspaper, “Phoenix Pioneer,” boasted
that “the largest copper mines in the
Dominion are situated at Phoenix. The
Granby Company employs 500 men,
and has a monthly payroll of over $50,-
000.”

At 4,300 feet, Phoenix was the high-

est incorporated city in Canada. It dis-‘

incorporated in 1919, when the ore ran
out. The world’s ‘ski championships
were once held in the" town, which at
the height of its boom had five church-
es, 17 saloons’,_ an‘ opera house, three
schools, and 33500 people. -

After 1’9,1_9',"»the town emptied. One
by one, the ‘houses fell down until to-
day only one is left standing in the
ghost mining town.

 
 

J CIO News  story
in phone booth, prints if

NEW YORK—The( “CIO News" in‘
its December 3rd i'_ssue,_ ‘ran a story
that indicates thatnot all _opium-smok-
ing is confined to'juvenil‘e delinquents.
The story goes that the Steel workers
have come up with. a brand new lan
to raid Mine-Mill -in-. the New ork
area. — j ‘ ; .- i
To plan the raids, a’, meeting was sup-

posed to have been held of representa-
tives oi’ Steel locals in the New York
area which were formerly in Mine Mill.
In that casethe meeting must have
been held in two telephone booths,
with Ed Murphy of Laurel Hill in one
and Jim Corriveau ‘ of Bridgeport in
' the other.

The story admits that the new ‘raid’
is a pipe dream of Murphy's, who has
been on the hot seat ever since he set-
tled with Phelps Dodge at Laurel Hill
for five cents across the board, with

.four cents of it subject to deduction -

for a pension plan-—leaving a one cent.
increase, plus such fringes as one cent
for insurance. _
- A MIN E-MILL leaflet put out at the
_Laurel Hill plant listed the Mine-Mill

.;and Steel settlements ide by side,~

’with ' the proposal that unity be
achieved; in order to win the same set-.
tlement for Laurel Hill and then secure
-‘joint: ‘WSB approval. The Mine-Mill
leaflet was the first news of their set-'
tlement that the Laurel Hill workers
received. No reply was ‘given by Steel
to the Mine-Mill proposal, but they
were forced to promise the workers
everything that Mine-Mill had. ’
Now theyhave finally come up with
an answer, not to accept proposals for
a united fight for greater gainsfor all
non-ferrous workers,‘ but to waste {more
of- their membership’s dueson fruitless
raiding to defend their inferior con-
tract. » _
At Jenkins Valve in Bridgeport, Cor-.
riveau’s Steel local also settled for a
nickel, and jit;.is,well known that senti-
ment for *8;  to Mine-Mill-is wide-
spread in tHé’fﬁlahﬁ: Yet, in the CIO '

‘ story, the “spokesmen” (presumably V:

Murphy ‘and §(Eo'rri?veia.u‘) are quoted as
follows: “One of the factors thatamjoved

i them was their satisfaétionwith theref-

 

 forts put forth by the USA on their 7
behalf since their affiliation, they said. -

Gains for the members through new
contracts, they said, were far greater

 than they had received while still mem-
,b.eI_'s of .Mine-Mill.” ~ '

’. - The record speaks ' louder. ‘than the
,CIO News. Since Laurel; Hill left Mine-

Mill for Steel, they have gotten two

, increases across the board totalling
15c..Ten cents of that came following
the national. Mine-Mill 10% raise in the
fall of 1950,.which Steel had nothing.
3t'o do with.'Of-the other five cents, ne-
gotiated this year, the-contract signed
by Steel provides that the cost of any

future pension plan, if the Phelps‘

Dodge Corporation adopts one for its
other plants, “will be deducted from
wages across the board.” . ‘
During ‘the same period the Mine
Mill workers at U. S. Metals plant in
Carteret, which is not only the same
type of refinery, but is ‘partly owned
by Phelps Dodge, won , increases in"
wages alone of 11% and 6% for a total
average wage increase of 23c‘-—not to
mention a pension plan in effect for
two years already and  insurance
program fully paid by the company.
. Yet, on the day the Mine Mill local
"concluded its negotiations for its‘21c
package this -year, , Steel ..pie-cards

_'showed up with raiding‘ leaflets. They

are now back on the same road of try-
ing_ to protect their own sell-outs by
undercutting other workers in the in-
dustry. , ._ V

Itstill looks like unity with the rest

of the non-ferrous metal workers is the
' best step for Laurel Hill workers.

IT IS a source of the greatest satisfaction to us, as offi-
cers of this great International Union, to know that
many thousands of our members are receiving or will
receive their back pay checks in time to make this Christ-
mas a merrier one for their wives and children. 

. There are others who will not have _their back pay
until after the holidays. We hope the assurance of having

‘it soon will help to brighten the season. » .

There are others among our membership for whom
there will be no back pay, for whom there has been no pay
at all for many weeks or months. We have published spe-
cial Christmas appeals for these striking brothers, and we
hope that every working member will make his contri-
bution.

, THE THEME of a statement we issued on January 1
of this year was “Peace can be won in '51." Now, as -the
year draws to a close, we do not know whether the people’s
hopes and prayers for a cease-fire in Korea will be realized
in time to make our prediction come true. But there are
some things we do know for sure about the issue of war
or peace. , h ‘

We know that if and when an end to the killing is
arranged it will come as a result of pressure for peace
from peoples all over the world. . - _ /

We know that only a continuation of such pressure
will preserve the peace. '

A We know that all of the problems of-working people
in the United States and Canada are bound up in the issue
of war or peace. A 1 ‘ » 1

We know from experience that war means, for work-

ing pepole, inflated prices, frozen wages, Big Business
dictatorship, repression, destruction of trade eunion rights,
destruction of civil liberties, increased repression of minor-
ity peoples. - _ > 

' WITH THE END of the shooting in Korea, we should
find opportunity to fight more effectively against these
war-born evils. ' l - ~

Our union has won tremendous victories in 1951. —We‘
smashed the raiders, we achieved nation-wide coordination ‘

of bargaining, and we broke through the wage freeze to
make unprecedented gains. “

We hope that in the coming year we can "have apart

in establishing a freer and more democratic climate in our
two countries, so that the victories for which we shall-

strive shall be not so much against such evils as union- '

busting and wage freezing, but that we shall be able to

take longer strides on the road to the greater: welfare of i

all our members and all working people. ; -

In this spirit we ‘extend the- seas_on’s greetings to all

of our members and friends.

Bust CIO Gas

raid in Kansas

HUMBOLDT, Kansas — What first
looked «like a full-scale “b1itz" raid
by the CIO Gas, Coke & Chemical
Workers on Mine-Mill’Local 570 here
‘hirned out to be a full scale defeat
for the raiders when the workers

' voted nearly 2 to 1 to keep Mine-

Mill as their bargaining agent and
fight for a better contract. ‘

In the NLRB election held November
23 at this small brick and tile plant,
44 out ‘of a total eligible 45 voted.
Resultswere: Mine-Mill Local 570-.27,
Gas-Coke-_16, Neither-1.

. The attempted “blitz” raid was
pulled by a renegade Mine-Mill member

from Pittsburgh, Kansas, nearby. He _

is Claude Jack Massey, now president
of a local CIO? Steelworkers union in
Pittsburg. _{ 1 -_ _ -
THEWORKERS at Humboldt Brick
& ’Tile> Co, wanted to know why a
character like“Massey," formerly in

.Mine-Mill and ;’now a CIO Steel local

president, was‘ ":trying to pull them
into Gas-Coke. The only answer they
could find was that Massey, who once

‘couldn't get along with Mine-Mill,.

now couldn't "get" along with Steel, and

consequently is undoubtedly looking"

for a job with Gas-Coke. .

Despite, the relative small size of
the Mine-Mill Humboldt local, the at-
tempted raid was carried on by no less

-than three outside “generals” from

the CIO. These included the president,
no less, of the Kansas State CIO Coun-
cil,\who no doubt was trying to make
‘a name for himself in the “new or-
ganization” column of the “CIO News,”
Gas-Coke organizer Ira Williams, and

Steel petition at
llurley tossed out

HURLEY, N. M. —- The National
Labor Relations Board has tossedgout .
the petition of the CIO Steelworkers:
for an ‘election at the Kennecott smelt-
er here. The Steel petition was dis-

lmissed because of “failure to demon-

strate evidence of representation" of -A
a substantial number of employees in-
volved.”

The Board called attention to the
fact that the smelter workers are al-
ready represented by Mine-MilliLocala='
890, which has a contract with.‘Kenne-. 
cott. ‘ '

Commenting on the dismissal,; LG‘. I

cal 890 president Cipriano Montoya

.-said: “Our union and the smelter work-

ers on the job ‘knew from the be-
ginning that the Steel raiders were
pulling their usual tactic of petition-
ing dishonestly. Time and time again,
they have tried ‘to fool the workers
they want to represent, as well as a
government board, by claiming repre-
sentation they never come close to.
“The men at the Hurley smelter have
refused to sign the Steel cards. The
Labor Board has now said officially
that Steel isn't in the running. So .if
-these would-be raiders keep on hang"-_
ing arpund, it will only be in the vain
hope of disrupting the unity and »

strength Mine-Mill has built «in "this _-

district.” V ‘
