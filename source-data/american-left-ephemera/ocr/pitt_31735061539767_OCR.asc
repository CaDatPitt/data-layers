When there were only a few factories and great sections of the world
were not industrialized at all, things went pretty well for the proﬁt system.
The silver and gold of the world went to those who owned the factories
and they grew ever richer. But ﬁnally the day arrived when factories became
very plentiful and many countries had them. The remaining undevelo ed
countries couldn’t buy all the goods produced. Then there was trou le.
Factories were closed down and unemp oyment was found the world round.
The proﬁt system had ceased to function successfully.

A SIMPLE ILLUSTRATION

Now let us try to make that plain by a simple imaginary illustration.
Let us suppose that there exists a productive island in the middle of an
ocean. This island has an excellent climate and good soil. Food is no prob-
lem because there is plenty of it growing wild. Shelter is no problem because
there is plenty of timber and material for building houses at hand. Clothing
is a problem. Cotton will grow if cultivated but there is no machinery for
spinning and weaving. This island is inhabited by 1,000 people, one of
whom is rich. The one rich man is a good business man. He sees the need
for clothing and the possibility of making some money by raising cotton
and manufacturing cotton cloth. So he builds a factory and hires the

people of the island to grow cotton and make it into cloth. He pays them-

$80,000 a year in wages for working for him, but he expects to sell the
cloth they have produced for $100,000. This is $20,000 more than it cost
him to make it but he must sell it for more than it cost him to produce it
or he cannot make‘ a proﬁt.

So he sells to his employees four-ﬁfths of the cloth they have made and
when they have purchased this four-ﬁfths of the output of the factory they
have spent all the $80,000 he has paid them in wages and have nothing
left with which to purchase the other one-ﬁfth. This one-ﬁfth, which
represents the factory owner's proﬁt, becomes an unsaleable surplus which
the people on the island cannot buy and consume, is then shipped to a
near-by island which has no factory for the production of cotton cloth and
there it is sold for $20,000 and all is well.

The next year he repeats the process and makes another 320,000 proﬁt.
In the two years he has paid out $160,000 in wages and has so d the
products of his factory for $200,000, a clear proﬁt of $40,000. ’ '

OVER PRODUCTION AND UNEMPLOYMENT

The third year he produces the same amount of cloth and sells the same
amount to the people at home but when he goes to sell the surplus to the
people inthe neighboring island he ﬁnds that they have built a cotton fac-
tory of their own and this marketis lost. He puts this unsold one-ﬁfth in
the warehouse and because he has this surplus on hand, he manufactures
only four-ﬁfths of the normal output the fourth year for which he pays
his workers only $64,000 in wages. As a result they buy less cotton than the

[8]

 

 

year before and the factory owner has more goods left on his hands which
he must store in the warehouse. The islanders have less clothes than they
once had but not because there is a scarcity of cotton cloth ‘on the island.
The cloth is there in abundance but they ‘haven't the money with which to

purchase it. and the reason they haven't is because their income, derived‘

solely from the wages paid them for growing the cotton and making the
cloth, is not suﬂicient to buy back the cloth they have made.

Now it is something like that, on a much vaster scale, that has happened
to us.

The factories of the world have been built by men who have grown richer
through ownership. The surpluses, which have represented the proﬁts, have
been sold in the undeveloped countries of the world and the proﬁts
pocketed by the owners of the factories. Now that almost every country in
the world has been industrialized and has its own factories for the produc-
tion of the things the people need, surpluses can no longer be marketed in
other countries and we have scarcity in the midst of plenty just as these
islanders came to have.

FABULOUS WEALTH AND DIRE POVERTY

Our country is the richest nation in the world. It is the most highly de-
veloped industrial nation in the world. And yet during the decade from
1930 to 1940 there probably were more people unemployed and more de-
pendent upon the public dole for their means of existence than in all of
Europe and Europe has ﬁve times our population. No other place in all
the world was there greater abundance and yet greater relative scarcity
among the people. We might look at the history of our own nation and
see how the proﬁt system has worked to make this come to pass.

It takes two things to make wealth—natural resources and the human
labor to change the natural resources into useful things. When the conti-
nent of North America was discovered no one realized how rich it was in
natural resources nor what opportunities existed for the turning of those
resources into usable wealth. Now we know how rich it was. The ﬁrst

settlers came to our east coast and the history of our nation has been one con- .

tinuous story of men moving from east to west taking industry and civiliza-

-tion with them. We all thrill at the story of the conquest of the continent

by pioneers who steadily moved westward until they reached the Paciﬁc
ocean. But behind the pioneers came the factories. While many of our land-
hungry forefathers drove covered wagons westward, others were laying the
foundations of a great industrial development. The inpouring of immi-
grants from Europe furnished the human labor necessary for the trans-
forming of natural resources into wealth.

Those who had riches built factories that they might grow richer. There
were times of booming business and times of depression but whenever
a depression came those who couldn’t work in the factories went west and

[9]

  

settled on the land and by their labor created new wealth from the natural
resources. That new wealth, which in the beginning was in the form of
agricultural products, was traded for manufactured goods. This would start
business booming again until so many factories would be built that the
farmers couldn't buy all that was made and another depression would come.
Then again folks surged westward for new lands and’-the same story was
repeated. The factory owners grew steadily richer by the rocess. Great for-
tunes were created, the like of which the world had not nown before.

EFFECTS OF THE WORLD WAR

About 1900 the unused lands of the west began to run out. Foreign
trade began to be of greater importance as an outlet for the manufactured
goods of the nation. The World War came on in 1914. The wheels of in-
dustry in America turned feverishly, producing goods which were con-
sumed in the great European conﬂict. Then Europe ran out of money. The
banks of America then loaned vast sums of money to European govern-
ments. The money loaned was used to buy goods from America. Those
who controlled industries made fortunes. By 1917 it became a parent that
unless something were done the Allies, to whom American ankers had
loaned the great bulk of the money sent abroad, stood a good chance of
being defeated. The United States entered the war on the side of the
Allies. The government took over the loans which our bankers had made
to the warring governments. New money was poured into Europe——this
time by direct loans on the part of our government to the Allies. That
money was spent in America for goods which we produced. The proﬁts
were immense for those who controlled industry. When the war was over
Europe had to be rebuilt. Money was loaned to Germany and other coun-
tries for the goods necessary to reconstruct what had been destroyed. Slowly
but surely European industries got going. They again produced surpluses
under the proﬁt system and had goods for the world market.

THE INEVITABLE COLLAPSE OVERTAKES US

Things began to tighten down so far as business activity was concerned.
They were kept going temporarily by the scheme of installment selling but
eventually the crash came. The markets of the world were no longer open
to our goods. Japan, once a great market for American goods, was in the
manufacturing game herself and was trying to sell abroad. Other once back-
ward sections of the globe were using modern machinery for producing
vast quantities of goods. We became like the islanders mentioned earlier——
we found that other people had factories and that we couldn't buy back all
our own products because of the difference between total income of laborers
and farmers and total price asked‘ for the goods produced. Surpluses—-
so called——ﬂpiled up in warehouses. Men were laid off. Every time a man
was laid o it cut down the urchasing power of the American people by
that much. A great business dbpression settled down upon us. Great efforts

were made by the federal government " to bring back prosperity" but 1940
l 10]

 

 

found us with relief rolls undiminished and a long list of unemployed be-
coming a permanent responsibility of society.

Then the war came. Men went back into the factories to make in-
struments of destruction. All of this meant temporary business activity
but it also meant increased taxation, increased government debt, and
greater actual scarcity of consumer goods. So long as the armament
building program continued we had a feverish and unnatural kind of
prosperity that will in the end bring its inescapable aftermath of misery
and suffering. Every student of history knows the regularity with which
post-war business depressions have plagued the race. Those who under-
stand the past cannot but face the future with foreboding.

It is, therefore, most important that we be thinking now of better ways of
distributing goods and services; that we see our apparent present prosperity
for what it is—a highly artiﬁcial temporary condition which will in the end
leave us exhausted‘ and impoverished. We will have neither enduring peace
nor lasting prosperity until we have found an adequate and eﬂ‘ective
method of distributing goods and services. The proﬁt system is outmoded.
To ﬁnd a proper substitute for it is the greatest single challenge facing
mankind. '

Fortunately we do not have to begin the search. Within sixty years after
the invention of the “Spinning Jenny” hungry and poverty stricken Eng-
lish working men started looking for what we so desperately need. Out of
their suffering came a new method of doing business which is called "Con-
sumers’ Cooperation.” An increasing host of thoughtful Americans believe
that it offers great hope for the future. We will now examine its history and
its methods.

THE PROBLEM DEMANDS AN ANSWER
' ROBERT OWEN

Some people are unmoved by the sight of human misery. It bothers them
not at all. They accept its presence in the world as they accept air and sun-
shine and earth and soil—as a part of the environment. But there are always
those who are made uncomfortable by the discomfort of others. Of these
there are two types: those who run away from the sight of it, feeling that
out of sight is out of mind; those who just have to do something about it.

Seven years after the invention of the Spinning Jenny there was born in

. England a man of the latter type. His birthplace was Newtown, Mont-

gomeryshire; his name, Robert Owen. Attwenty-eight Owen found him-
self a factory owner in position to make himself rich through his owner-

[11]

  

ship. He did become rich but throughout his lifetime he couldn't forget
human misery. The suffering of the poor who worked in the factories of
England weighed like a heavy burden upon his heart. He found no satis-

faction in living, save, as he found it in trying to lessen the misery of the *

poor. He appealed to his fellow factory owners; he appealed to his. govern-
ment. He launched many projects designed to bring peace and hap iness
to the lives of those who worked in the factories. He made his own actory
a paradise among those of the nation. In that he succeeded. But he wanted
to do something permanent. Improving conditions in one’s own factory
did not make a human brotherhood and Owen would be satisﬁed with
nothing else.

He saw the advantages of the machines. He knew that the world needed
all the goods that the factories were producing but the people who needed
what the factories turned out weren't getting them. The owners were proﬁt-
ing—-—not the many whose hands produced the goods. “If the workers
could be the owners"—Owen wrestled with the idea and tried again and
again to establish communities in which the workers were the owners of the
machines. Owen died in 1858. He had had a great dream—"Let the work
ers own the machines”—but he never discovered a way to make the dream
practical.

, DR. KING'S INFLUENCE

Another man living about the same time dreamed a like dream. His
name was King—Dr. William King of London, a physician who spent
most of a lifetime ministering to the ailments of the poor. But he was not

a satisﬁed to make sick bodies well—he wanted to do something about the

awful poverty that was a disease in the body of the nation. He started pub-
lishing a magazine called’ the “Co-operator.” He, too, said, "Let the
workers own the machines.” He urged the workers of England to get into
business for themselves; to help one another own stores and factories.
Under the inspiration of his appeal groups of workers here and there tried
to start Cooperative stores—stores owned by the laborers, and‘ run by them,
for them. By 1829 he was able to report the establishment of many societies
organized for mutual aid. He tried to guide them-——emphasized proper
management, cash trading, accurate accounting, and education.

It seemed as if the Cooperative idea was to succeed but the eighteen-
thirties had scarce begun when England had not a single operating Co-
/operative society.

It. would appear that Robert Owen and Dr. King alike had been chasing
a will-o -the-wisp. The answer had not ‘been found. It was not destined
that these two men-—each belonging to the privileged class but seeking to
help the underprivileged—should give the world the answer. That was for
a group of hungry laborers to.do. Owen and King were great dreamers
butrtthey did not ﬁnd the technique for turning their dreams into practical
rea 1 res.

TWENTY-EIGHT HUNGRY WEAVERS

THE ROCHDALE PIONEERS

Men have come to speak of the years between 1840 and 1850 as "the
hungry forties.” They were years in which the misery of the miserable was
even worse than usual, but out -of the deeper misery of those years was born
the answer to our need for something to replace the proﬁt system.

1843 was a bad year but particularly bad for the weavers of the city
of Rochdale. They had lost a strike and, as is often the case, when a strike
is lost, some of them found they had no jobs at all. Triumphant employers
saw to it that strike leaders were discharged; What to do? Those who could,
came to America, but few were they who could afford the passage money.
Some wanted to stage a political demonstration. To a few there came the
old "dream of Owen and King——own the factories, own the stores. It looked
foolish for men who had not enough to eat and to wear to talk of achieving
ownership. But talk they did. Those who had the courage to believe in the
dream organized themselves into a society. It was called "The Equitable
Society of Rochdale Pioneers.”

These "Pioneers” knew that it took capital to achieve ownership so they
set themselves to saving——a penny here, a shilling there. They saved for
a solid year and had gotten together $140. With that amount they started
into business for themselves. A factory could not be bought for that so they
decided to open a grocery store.

With half their precious capital they rented _a room and bought a few
ﬁxtures; with the remaining half they purchased a meager stock of goods-
some butter, sugar, candles, and meal. The store was opened on the right
of December 21, 1844. It was located in an old warehouse basement on a

street called Toad Lane. The name of the store’s manager was Samuel -

Ashworth. He was behind the counter on that ﬁrst night; he managed the
business for twenty-two successful years.

Twenty-eight people belonged to this ﬁrst successful Cooperative society
when it began——twenty-seven men and one brave woman. Her name was
Ann Tweedale;

AN HISTORICAL EVENT
When the shutters were taken down on that December night a gang of

. boys had assembled in the street and they made no end of fun of these,

weavers who wanted to be in business for themselves. But somehow the
weavers did what Owen and King had not been able to do. They discovered

a the technique by which their dreams could be made to work. The store was

a success. By the end of the ﬁrst year others had been persuaded to become
a part of this new endeavor. The membership had grown to 74 and the
capital to $900. The ﬁrst year's business totaled $3,500 and the net proﬁt

[13]

  

was $160. Robert Owen died in 1858. Three years later there were 1,850
members of the society and its capital was $75,000. That year the business
totaled $400,000.

In 1894 the "Equitable Society of R_ochdale Pioneers” celebrated its
Golden Jubilee. The membership was 12,000, annual business $1,500,000.
In 1940 there were 30,000 members. Sales jumped to $2,964,000.

Today millions revere the names of Rochdale and Toad Lane. The little
store, opened in 1844, was the beginning of the “Consumers’ Cooperative
movement.” Today it is found around the world.

They started with a grocery store but the ownership of factories came in
due time. The Pioneers purchased a ﬂour mill in 1850; in 1852 they began
the manufacture of shoes. In 1855 they began a "Manufacturing Society”
for cotton and wool weaving. The weavers were weaving, not to make
proﬁts for others but to make things for themselves.

How did they do it? That will be told later. First let us see how the
thing grew.

GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

After the successful demonstration of the possibility of those who had
little getting on by helping each other, came a steady spread of the move-

ment. By 1863 there were 426 similar cooperative societies in England. .

That year marked a great step forward. The societies organized to help each
other. They did’ it by the creation of the "North of England Cooperative

Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society.” Some had dreamed of this »

since 1850 but dreams sometimes take time in the fulﬁlling. It was on
Good Friday of that year that this new venture was launched. It was a
good Friday indeed. The Wholesale society began business in 1864. Things
went slowly at ﬁrst but within two years the success of the effort was as-
sured. The new society built its ﬁrst warehouse at Manchester in 1869.

At first the wholesale society did nothing but buy in the wholesale mar-
ket the things needed by the societies engaged in retailing. At the end of
ten years the volume of business had grown so great that it was desirable
that manufacturing be started. First came a jam factory, then a soap factory,
and a shoe factory. Today the wholesale society is a great business giant.

It has shortened its name. It is called today simply the Cooperative
Wholesale Society which is often abbreviated to C.W.S.

The Cooperative Wholesale Society is England’s biggest distributive
business. It owns 250 manufacturing plants which make a great variety of
products ranging from bread to blankets. Among these plants are the largest
ﬂour mills in the British Empire, and the largest textile mills. It does the
fourth largest banking business in England. In 1893 it set out to acquire
sources of raw materials. That year it purchased a large estate for fruit
growing. Today its land holdings in England are more than 30,000 acres.

[141

 

 

In addition it owns 33,000 acres of tea plantations in India and Ceylon;
palm and olive plantations in Africa. It owns a coal mine and a ﬁshing
ﬂeet as well. .

This business giant is not the property of a few men of great wealth.
It belongs to 1,064 local cooperative societies whose membership totals
9,225,240 families. In 1945 the total volume of cooperative retail trade
was more than $1,409,245,008. .

NOT AFFECTED BY DEPRESSION

Did England have ‘a depression? Yes, but the Cooperative movement
in England» did not. It grew bigger and bigger through the depression
years. It has built new factories, "hired more help, handled more and more
goods each successive year. During the years from 1932 to 1934 when we
in America were so drastically tightening our belts the Cooperatives of
England gave back to their members in patronage refunds more than
$600,000,000 with which to buy more bread and shoes and clothing and
radios and automobiles. Not only that, but the Cooperatives have, made it
possible for all British people to get more for their money. Bread is sold
through‘ cooperative channels for about half what we pay in America. In-
terestingly enough, a great amount of American wheat is used in making
English bread.

Twenty-eight hungry weavers found a better method for distributing the
necessities of living. »

III

AROUND THE WORLD

The movement begun by the Rochdale Pioneers is today world-wide. It
is found in practically every country of the globe and is growing daily.
Outside of England the strongest developments are found in the Scandi-
navian countries—Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. Japan was
not far behind with a movement which embraced about one-third her
population.

Moves toward cooperation between cooperators of various lands began
in 1884 when French cooperators sent greetings to the British Cooperative
Congress. The following year the French sent two fraternal delegates to the
English congress. In 1892 an organization known as the International Co-
operative Alliance was formed. Its first congress was held in London in
1895. v

In September 1934 the International Cooperative Alliance met again in
London. At this meeting delegates from thirty-ﬁve nations were present
In 1937 Parisian cooperators acted as hosts to a like assemblage. At this
meeting the ﬁnal steps were taken in the establishment of a functioning
international cooperative wholesale. Shortly thereafter the International Co-

[15]

  

operative Trading Agency set up its oﬂices in London and began routing
goods back and forth between cooperators of many nations. The coming
of the war has since made it impossible for such an organization to function.
But wars have never lasted forever. Almost immediately after the guns
ceased ﬁring steps were taken to revive international Cooperative trading.

The International Cooperative Alliance before the war represented
75,000,000 families in the world. The spirit of the twenty-eight hungry
weavers marches on—they were the "Pioneers" of the world’s tomorrow.

SUCCESS AND FAILURE
Robert Owen with all his wealth and Dr. ‘King with all his education

.failed where the penniless and uncultured weavers of Rochdale succeeded.

We would naturally have expected the opposite to have been the case. It
is important that we, facing as we are this problem of our lack of goods in
this age of abundance,. understand thoroughly the principles and methods
by which the Rochdale weavers achieved success. Owen and King alike
tried to teach the working people of England to work together for -common
advancement. Owen’ and King alike emphasized the importance of owner-
ship. They were constantly saying, “Own the stores and the factories."
Owen established one community after another in which he gave owner-
ship of homes and factories to the workers. One after another those com-
munities failed. A part of the failure of Owen's efforts was probably due.
to the very fact that he did too much for those who lived in the communities
he set up. He was too much the paternal god-father giving out abundance.
There is something about human nature which requires that we do for our-
selves. It is usually only what we do for ourselves that permanently counts
in our advancement.

Then too, Owen thought pretty largely of the workers as workers. It
was his idea that those who work in a factory should own it. The idea didn't
work then. It has been tried again and again and has failed again and again.
It took a different approach to bring success to the principle of working to-
gether for mutual aid.

THE CONSUMRR APPROACH

The Rochdale Pioneers discovered that different approach. They said,
"Let those who use what is sold from a storeor made in a factory own the
store and factory.” Let the wearer of the shoes produced in a shoe fac-
tory own it; let the people who eat the bread‘ produced own the bakery;
let those who use the things a store sells own the store. There is all the
difference in the world between these two approaches.

After all why do men work? Is it not in order to get things to use?
The primary interest of the factory worker is in earning money with which
to purchase the things he wants to use. The primary interest of the farmer

[161

 

 

is in producing things which he can use himself or which he can sell and
get the cash with which to purchase things he wants to use. Work is a
means to an end. Men work for the purpose of being able to secure things
to consume. Owen emphasized working together to produce. The Rochdale
Pioneers started out working together to get the things they, wanted to con-
sume. Owen failed; the Pioneers succeeded.

King's thinking was nearer that of the Rochdale group. He started a ‘

number of organizations of ‘men as consumers. The organizations which he
created failed largely because of bad technique. By some strange chance the
men of Rochdale stumbled on to the technique that would work. They
started with that much needed combination of a proper ideal and a work-
able technique. -

More can be said as to the advantages of consumer ownership of stores
and factories but ﬁrst we must achieve understanding of the principles and

methods of the Rochdale weavers. Their work was permanent. Those who_

have copied after them built permanent organizations; those who have
tried to organize Consumers’ Coo erative societies and have disregarded the
methods and principles applied rst at Rochdale have invariably failed.

Let us ﬁnd out what were these methods and principles.

PART III
I
THE ROCHDALE PRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION

SOMETIMES CALLED THE PRIMARY PRINCIPLES or
CONSUMERS’ COOPERATION

1. A Conrumerf Cooperative society rball be democratically controlled.

Most of us know what is meant by the term democracy because we have *

spent our lives in a political democracy. Democracy means one vote per
person. When electiontime comes around in the United States every person
over 21 years of age is allowed one vote and only one vote for each political
office to be ﬁlled. It matters not whether a person be millionaire or pauper
when the votes are counted one man’s vote is just as important as another’s.
The Rochdale weavers adopted this principle in the organization of bus-

. iness——they allowed each member of the society one vote and only one vote

in all its elections and on all questions.

This principle of democracy is one that is not found in proﬁt businesses.
In the ordinary corporation or business ﬁrm the number of votes which an
individual has is determined by the amount of money which he or she has
invested in the business. If a corporation's stock is made up of shares having
a par value of $100 each, each share holder has a vote for each hundred
dollars which he has invested. The person who has ten shares has ten votes,

[171

  

the person who has ﬁve shares has ﬁve votes. This method of voting makes
it possible, in a great many cases, for one person or a small group of persons
to absolutely control the affairs of a business ﬁrm. A corporation which had
issued ﬁfty shares of stock to twenty-ﬁve persons might have its stock dis-
tributed in such a way that one man could out-vote the remaining
twenty-four. If one man held 26 shares and the remaining twenty-four one
each, such would be the case. Under such an arrangement we see how easy
it is for the one man to take advantage of the many and conduct the bus-
iness in such a way as to work to their loss and’ his own gain. Some cor-
porations in America have many thousands of small share holders but they
are’.helpless to control the affairs of the business in which they have made
their investment.

In cooperative societies it is often the case that one person has invested
more money in the enterprises of the organization than another but that
fact makes no difference so far as control is concerned. Cooperators believe

_ that men should control money and not money control men. For that reason
. they insist on one man one note.

2. There rhall he open memherrhip. No perronr shall he denied mem-
bership in 4 Consumer: Cooperative unlerr it he hnown that they
with to join for the purpoxe of doing harm to the organization.

The Equitable Society of Rochdale Pioneers kept the doors of their
cooperative wide open. They excluded no one because of religious beliefs,
political aﬂiliation, or occupation. They made it clear in the very beginning
that no one was to be barred because of race, creed, class, or color.

 

It is doubtful if the Pioneers thought of it, but men have since come to .

see that when people are joined together as consumers they are uniting on
the basis of the one thing all have in common. Everyone is a consumer.
The desire for more things to eat, wear, and wear out is shared by all men.

We are not all workers. The child who is too young and the adult who
is too old cannot work. Yet both must consume: for consumption is life.
Without the eating of food, the drinking of water, the proper shelter from
the elements, life cannot go on. From the time the baby takes its ﬁrst milk
to the day when embalming ﬂuid‘ is injected into the veins, the human being
IS a consumer. 4

Men have not been able to agree about politics, they do not agree about
religion, they are of many nations, and many colors. But all need food and

shelter. The Consumers Cooperative movement can be all inclusive. It has a

place for every one.

But class feeling runs strong in the human race. There are always those
who feel that membership in their cooperative should be limited to those
of some single occupation or class. They are afraid of Open,Membership.
But any attempt to limit the membershi of a cooperative is an effort to
limit the service which a society can ren er to those who do belong to it.

[13]

 

 

 

 

it is one program of economic reform of which it can truthfully be said,
‘The more who share with us, the greater the beneﬁts for all to share."

3. Money inverted in a cooperative Jociety, if it receive interert, Jhall
receive a ﬁxed percentage which Jhall not he more than the prevailing
current rate.

Usually those who organize cooperative societies are not people of" any
great wealth. The capital needed to open the grocery store or ﬁlling station,
or whatever the business of the society happens to be, is often secured by
considerable self-sacriﬁce on the part of the members. We are aware of the
tremendous sacriﬁces which the twenty-eight weavers of Rochdale made in
order to secure their ﬁrst capital. They felt that the sacriﬁce made deserved
a reward. This they gave in the form of interest on the share capital—they
paid ﬁve per cent per annum. The rate was ﬁxed and deﬁnite. It was the
rate current at that time. The Cooperativelmovement of England still pays
ﬁve per cent. .

Now in ordinary proﬁt business the rate of return which the share holder
receives is not ﬁxed and deﬁnite. It is speculative—it goes up and down
with the proﬁts of the business. A corporation with a capital stock of
$10,000, if it makes $2,000 in a given year, will pay 20 per cent on the
invested capital; if it makes $1,000 it will pay 10 per cent. The per cent
varies with the proﬁts. Cooperative societies pay capital a fair rate of in-
terest—nothing more.

4. If a cooperative society make: a net proﬁt that proﬁt rhall he re-
turned to the c0n.run2er.r who patronize the Jociety on the ha.ri.r of the
amount of purchaser.

If you buy goods at an ordinary privately owned store you are charged
more than the goods cost. Some of that charge goes to pay rent or taxes_on
the building; some is for clerk hire; some is for the manager’s salary; some
may be for interest on money borrowed to keep the business going; some
is probably set aside to cover the cost of replacing ﬁxtures and other equip-
ment when it wears out. But after all these expenses are taken care of
there is usually some left. That which is left is the net proﬁt. Where does
it go? "To those who own the business. '

What did the Rochdale Pioneers do with that which was left over after
all expenses were paid? They considered it an over-charge to the people
who traded with them. So they gave it back on the basis of the amount of
goods purchased.

The way which this principle works in actual practice can be illus-
trated by what happened at the 1934 annual meeting of the members of
the Cooperative Trading Company at Waukegan, Illinois. The meeting was
held in March—after the books on the 1933 business had been carefully
audited. The total volume of business for that year had been something
over $500,000. After the cost of the goods was deducted, the wages of em-

[19]

 

ployees taken care of, interest paid on share capital, taxes paid, proper
amounts set aside to replace the equipment used, and .all other such ex-
penses met, it was found that there was more than $10,000 left over. On ,
recommendation of the board of directors the members present voted to
give the $10,000 back to the customers of the organization-—two per cent
on every dollar. The person who had bought goods for which he was
charged $100 received back $2.00; the person who had bought goods for
which he paid $10 received back 20 cents. The net proﬁt: were returned

to the comzzmerr on the hair of the amount of their patronage.

Now if the Cooperative Trading Company had been an ordinary bus-
iness what would have happened? The share capital of the organization
was about $70,000. On that capital the members received four per cent in-
terest. If the Trading Company had been a proﬁt business those who had
invested the $70,000 woul have received in addition to the four per cent
the $10,000 of net proﬁts. That would have made their total dividend better
than 18 per cent.

Sometimes cooperative societies modify this principle and‘ give back the
net-profit or over‘-charge in the form of a social service (provided for the
membership. This is particularly true in Belgium. Instea of paying back

’ cash to the patrons the Belgian societies have built recreation centers,
libraries, nurseries, and even hospitals for the use of their members.
Through this means cultural advantages have been brought to the coopera-
tors of Belgium which they could not possibly have otherwise secured. «
Some SOCiCtlc.> i. America have copied the Belgian plan. Some societies
pay back part of the net proﬁts in cash and devote a part to maintenance
of some valuable service for the membership.

ROCHDALE METHODS
‘ SOMETIMES CALLED TI-IE SECONDARY PRINCIPLES

1. A Cooperative rociety shall he compared of member: who voluntarily

yam. —

The Rochdale Pioneers believed in freedom for the individual. They
made no attempt to coerce or force anyone to become a member of their
organization. They left the matter entirely to the good sense "of the people
themselves._ They believed‘ in education and persuasion but not in force.
This method has been continued through all the years of cooperative growth
and development.

2. Burinerr rhall he done for ca.rh.

The failure of the cooperative societies organized under the inspiration 0
of Dr. King has already been mentioned. One of the chief reasons why
. those societies failed was because they did a credit business. Thecapital_ of

[201

..-,a——..~———~;-%?<&vm*o'-~v~.»‘v4—wiw\-iv’-. r-~-—----<~---~~-»-r~~»-~~-«---«- ...... —--—— ....__..._ __.__.,__ ... .. N . , .  ..

the organization was eaten up by credit losses. Eventually no funds were
left for carrying on the business.‘ Proﬁting by the costly mistakes of those
who had gone before, the Rochdale society from the very day it opened its
doors did business for cash——i'eady money it is called in England.

The temptation to do a credit business is very strong in a cooperative
society. Members feel that the society belongs to them and ought to give
them credit, and yet when the membership of a society votes to do business
on a credit basis it is greatly increasing the chances for failure. There
are several reasons for this.

In order to do business on a credit basis more capital is required because
a part of the resources are always tied up in credit accounts. The usual
cooperative society does not have an over supply of capital available. If
capital must be borrowed interest charges increase the cost of operations.

Then there is always the question of collections. The most honest are
not just sure what the future holds for them. They may buy on credit with
all good intentions of meeting their bills but unforeseen factors often arise
which make it diﬂicult, if not impossible, to do so. Then, unfortunately,
not all people are entirely honest. A credit policy is always an encourage-
ment to them to take advantage of the situation. Every unpaid account must
be charged against the cost ,of operations.

The added costs must be met in some way. They are met either by mark-

ing up prices on the goods offered for sale or are taken out of the net.

proﬁts. In either case the person who pays cash and the person who is
honest is penalized at the expense of the credit customer and the dishonest
individual.

Credit is diﬂicult to handle. It is not safe to trust every one and yet
to trust some and not others opens the way to strife within the organization.

Credit business is poor business for a cooperative society. The Pioneers
had yet another reason for doing business on a cash basis. They knew that
debt was slavery. The debtor is not a free man; he is always more or less

the slave of the creditor. The Rochdale weavers knew from actual experi- _

ence because many of them had been in debt to shop keepers of various
sorts. They knew how hard it was to get out of debt once a person was in.
They wanted freedom, so they refused ‘to let their society have anything to
do with credit business. T . ,

It is often said, “But_isn’t a cooperative society organized for the pur-
pose of mutual aid‘? If a member is in hard circumstances how can we
refuse him credit? He needs help.” Cooperators ought to be ready at all
times to help one another but giving credit at the store may be help that

endangers the very life of the society itself. The help should be given in

some other way. The wise cooperative society carefully avoids the pitfalls of V

credit business.

3. Non-member: may become member: by letting tbeir .r/pare of tbe
net-proﬁt: be applied toward tbeir initial Jbare capital.

After the Rochdale weavers started in business for themselves they
found that many persons who were not members of their society bought
at the Toad Lane store. What should be done with the share of return
which would normally go to them if they were members? Should it go to
the members until such time as these persons paid the necessary English
pound‘ in order to be members? They decided not. They didn't pay the re-
turn in cash but they did give it in the form of credit toward the amount
which was necessary to purchase the initial share of stock. By that method
many became members who would not otherwise have done so. Many of
these members became valuable additions to the society and helped to in-
sure its success.

4. A portion of t/ae pro ﬁt: .r/oall be used for educational purpo.re.r in tbe
ﬁeld of Cooperation.

Every magazine and newspaper that comes into our homes is ﬁlled with

advertising. Ordinary proﬁt business spends hundreds of millions of dollars

every year for advertising the goods which it has for sale. It is generally
held that without an expensive outlay for advertising no proﬁt business can
ever become very large. The subtle suggestion behind every advertisement
is that successful, beautiful, healthy people are the users of a certain

product. The purpose of advertising is to persuade people to buy goods, ‘

usually a particular brand of goods.

Cooperation has never made much use of advertising. It has a better
method——e'ducation. Cooperative societies depend for their success upon

the loyalty of intelligent members who understand what Cooperation is. .

So instead of immense outlays for advertising the cooperative movement

has through all its years of growth set aside a portion of its proﬁts to in- ~

form people about Cooperation, to bring to them an understanding of the
principles and methods of Cooperation, to impart the knowledge that Co-
operation is a technique by which the machine can be set to work producing
goods for human beings instead of producing proﬁts for the few. When
people understand that Cooperation is a way 0 doing business which in-
sures them” fair and‘ honest treatment and which opens up for them the
possibility of securing a fairer share of the abundance which the machines
produce, they do not need the lure of advertising to persuade them to sup-
port their cooperative society.

A part of the educational effort of a cooperative society should be
directed toward the non-member. He should be given information as to
what Cooperation is so that he will wish to become a member of the society.
A part of the effort should be directed toward the members in order to give
them full knowledge of cooperative principles an'd"methods so that they
will run their business eﬂiciently and accor ing to sound cooperative tech-

‘ nique.

£223

\

 

 

Almost invariably the society which has the best educational rogram
shows the most rapid growth. Cooperation grows with the spread oi) knowl-
edge. One American cooperator recently said, “The only thing which can
limit the growth of Cooperation is lad: of knowledge among the people.”

The Rochdale Pioneers started out with a ﬁrm decision to bring en-
lightenment to themselves and to others. They established reading rooms
and started holding discussion classes in the very beginning. Their edu-
cational program expanded with their business. As they brought knowledge
to themselves and to others they grew. Education is a most important part
of the cooperative program. —

5. Good: and service: shall be sold at prevailing market price:.

In the very beginning the Rochdale movement avoided the pitfall of
price competition. If they had not, the Toad Lane store would have been
just another failure. Current market prices were charged for all goods and
services. There are several sound reasons for this method.

In the ﬁrst place, no one can tell accurately in advance what it is going
to cost to do business. If a cooperative society attempts to sell goods at cost
plus the cost of handling, it will soon ﬁnd itself in ﬁnancial dilﬁculties due
to the impossibility of determining in advance what the handling costs
will be. In the marketing of meat, for instance, a sudden rise initemperature
will greatly increase the cost of refrigeration. In the handling of fresh
vegetables, a sudden change in weather may greatly reduce the volume of
trade and cause a higher percentage of spoilage than is normal. In the best
managed stores unexpected things arise over and over again which may
result in temporary increases in handling costs. A cooperative society plays
safe by charging the same prices as others.

Then too, to attem t to sell goods cheaper than others usually results
in price wars. Many 0 us have seen pr-ice wars in the ﬁeld of the marketing
of petroleum products. Some small independent company decides it can
sell gasoline a cent or two cheaper than do larger concerns. It starts out
doing so and takes business away from the big ﬁrms. The large oil corpora-
tions then sell gasoline at less than cost for a time. The small independent
can't afford to sell at a loss. So he has to go out of business. He doesn't have
the capital reserves to win a price war. The same thing would happen to a
cooperative society which tried to sell goods and services at lower prices
than competing proﬁt businesses. These competitors would offer goods at
less than cost until the cooperative had exhausted‘ itself in a useless war.
Then prices would go up again. -

The cooperative charges current market prices. At the end of each year
it gives back what it has over-charged its members and customers.

People who don't understand this method of cooperative societies often
say, "Prices at the cooperative are just as high as any place else. I don't
see why that is." Prices should be just as high at the cooperative. They
are just as high for the sake of preserving the society.

[23]

  

The fact that some people criticize a cooperative for charging current
market prices is just an indication as to how important cooperative edu-
cation is.

6. At en:/7 inventory, reserve: J/3411 be set wide to cover depreciation
and -unforeseen diﬂimltie: aririn g in t/ae operation of the bu.rine.r.r.

The Rochdale Pioneers checked the stock and the books of their store
once every three months so that they could have accurate knowledge of the
true state of their business affairs. By the term inventory we mean an ac-
curate check of books and stock. It is by taking the inventory that the true
state of a business is discovered. Proﬁts or losses which may not otherwise
be revealed are discovered. Accurate knowledge is essential to proper man-
agement of a cooperative society.

One of the costs of operation which must always be ﬁgured in is what is,
called depreciation. It is a big word but it means the wear and tear on
equipment which eventually makes it necessary to replace it. In a grocery
store cash registers, shelving, scales, counters, refrigerators wear out. No

 

matter how good they may be in the beginning, they must eventually be _

replaced. Some money for this replacement should be set aside each time
the books of the business are balanced. By so doing the cost of replacement
is properly distributed and can be taken care of without strain when the
time for it arrives. Cooperatives should be very careful to see that adequate
funds are set aside to cover this cost of doing business. To do otherwise
is to invite trouble.

Not only should funds be set aside for depreciation but they should be
set aside to take care .of the unexpected expenses which arise without
warning. It was in 1850 that the “Pioneers” discovered how important this
was. In that year they purchased a ﬂour mill. They fully expected it to be
a paying proposition from the start. But they hadn't had it very long until

ey discovered that it was operating at a loss. It took several months to
get it on its feet. During this period some of the members got badly fright-
ened and were afraid the mill was going to bring ruin to the whole co-
operative enterprise; But during the six years previous to 1850 the manage-
ment and the members had seen to it that reserves had been set aside
to care for zmforereen difficulties. They used some of these reserve funds
to carry the business over this diﬂicult period. Becausethey had them avail-
able they saved the society. .

Many other societies have been able to save themselves in a time of
danger by similar wise provision for the unexpected. Sometimes the desire
to pay a large patronage return tempts members and managers of coopera-
tives to neglect this matter. But the ﬁrst concern of the membership of a
cooperative society should be the preservation of the business. Especially in
the beginning, a new society is o ten wise to sacriﬁce the patronage return

entirely in order that reserves may be built up as rapidly as possible.

[243

 

7. Labor .r/Jall be fairly treated.

The Consumers’ Cooperative movement was born out of the suffering of
the laborers of England. It was not long until it found itself an employer
of labor. When it became that it did not forget the sufferings out of which
it had come, but sought in every way to make life as pleasant as possible
for its employees. That spirit has been characteristic of the movement
through all the decades of its development. In 1934 the English Parliament
passed a bill making compulsory in all industry working conditionswhich
the Cooperative Wholesale Society had maintained for twenty years in its
warehouses and its factories.

The result of this general policy has been a minimum of labor disputes
between cooperative societies and their employees. This has resulted in an
unusual loyalty on the part of employees to their employing societies.
Employees are generally encouraged to become members of the societies
whidi employ them and to master cooperative principles and techniques.
This gives them a real sense of being a part of the movement'and makes
them deeply concerned for the welfare of their society.

Since it has as its ultimate purpose the lifting of the level of life for
all humanity it is perhaps only natural that the Cooperative movement has
been concerned for the welfare of those who do its work. Certainly coopera-
tive employees have had greater security and joy in their labor than any
other class of employees in the world.

. 8. Cooperative societies .r/aall cooperate with one anotber.

Cooperation between societies has been a very important factor in the
triumphs achieved by the cooperative movement. The organization of the
North of England Cooperative Wholesale Society was a great step for-
ward for the English movement. U until it was organized, the movement
lacked organic unity. Cooperation ' een societies was often indifferent
and impermanent but with the creation of the Wholesale came the con-
centration of the buying power of all member societies. Large volume
buying. gave to the movement new advantages in the wholesale markets.
This in turn beneﬁted every member society.

Manufacturing on any very extended scale is out of the cfuestion for most
local societies but a central organization supplying many ocal groups can,
with safety, enter the manufacturing ﬁeld as soon as the volume of business
guarantees an outlet for the products manufactured. Ownership of the
sources of raw materials, such as mines, oil wells, and farms, is largely out
of the question for local societies but becomes possible through the pooling
of the resources of many societies.

It is pretty hard for a local society to maintain a cooperative press but
when many societies are associated together they can and do maintain their
own publications, the purpose of which is the advancement of Cooperation.

£25]

 

Another important service which can be maintained through central
cooperative organization is that of furnishing expert cooperative auditors
to go over the books of local societies, give counsel and advice to boards
of directors and managers, and thus help keep the business affairs in a
healthy condition. a

Cooperation has grown by the increasing sense of unity and common
purpose which has come to characterize the movement the world over.
In union t/acre is strength. Individual local societies ﬁghting the battle
against the proﬁt system individually can do something; but when local

- societies combine their strength in wholesale organizations, in central educa-
tional organizations giving help and counsel to all, Cooperation becomes a ‘

mighty power for bringing economic security and justice to humanity. '

THE TRIUMPH OF ROCHDALE

The methods and principles which made possible the success of the
Rochdale movement have been described in the preceding sections of this
pamphlet. Those principles and methods have been found necessary to the
success of Consumers’ Cooperation. Many have tried to organize societies
and neglect some of them. The results have ever been partial or total fail-
ure. A century of experience enable us to say with ﬁnality that the Roch-
dale plan is the only plan by which Consumers’ Cooperation can be made
to work.

PART IV
I

COOPERATION IN AMERICA
BEGINNINGS

Thus far our attention has been largely centered on Englan'd where the
cooperative movement was born. Let us now turn to America and see what
Consumers’ Cooperation has done under the stars and stripes.

An effort was made in Consumers’ Cooperation in New England during
those same “hungry forties” which brought forth the Rochdale movement,
but nothing permanent was accomplished. A cooperative store was organ-
ized in Massachusetts in 1844 but it did not last very long. After its
failure a number of "purchasing associations” were formed but soon went
out of existence. Not. a great deal is known of them but their failure is
generally attributed to their effort to do business on a price cutting basis.
They tried to sell goods for the actual cost of purchase and‘ handling. At-
tempts to do business on such a basis always bring defeat.

America soon became engrossed in the Civil War and no further atten-
tion was paid to Consumers’ Cooperation until the eighteen seventies. The
hard times of that period resulted in general unrest among both farmers

.[26}

 

 

and city laborers. Both attempted through Cooperation to improve their
lot—the farmers, under the leadership of the Grange movement; and labor-
ers under the leadership of the Sovereigns of Industry, a secret order of
city workers.

A PERIOD OF FAILURE

Bad‘ technique brought failure to both these efforts. The Grangers re-
peated the mistakes of purchasing associations of pre-Civil War days. They
attempted to do business on a basis of charging cost plus the handling ex-
pense. To this serious mistake they added a second——they permitted mem-
bers to vote on the basis of number of shares owned. These two mistakes
carried their efforts to swift defeat.

The Sovereigns of Industry established a number of stores and they
charged current market prices and had democratic control. They might
have succeeded in giving America a Consumers’ Cooperative movement had
they not made two other fatal errors. They did a credit business and they
limited membership to those who were “Sovereigns of Industry.” The
double handicap of credit losses and limited membership soon brought
disaster.

Another eﬂ’ort was made on the part of industrial workers in the next
decade under the leadership of the "Knights of Labor.” This aggressive or-
ganization started a number of stores for the purpose of providing funds
for the operation of the Knights of Labor program. All net-proﬁts were
turned over to the central treasury of the labor organization. When it
ﬁnally went under it took all the stores down with it.

America had its period of cooperative failures just as England had‘ hers.
Success had to waitlthe dawn of the next century.

ROCHDALE PRINCIPLES COME TO AMERICA
VIA FINLAND AND BOHEMIA

Rochdale Cooperation first came to America as a part of Old World _

culture. It was brought to our shores by emigrant ‘groups. The Finns and
Bohemians played a very large part in its early beginnings. There was a
large migration from Finland and Bohemia to America around 1910. The
Finns settled in Massachusetts, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Northern Michi-
gan. The Bohemians in Ohio. They immediately established successful
Consumers Cooperative Societies. In 1917 seventeen organizations in
Minnesota and Wisconsin set up the Central Cooperative Exchange which
is now known as the Central Cooperative Wholesale. Its headquarters are
at Superior, Wisconsin. In 1945 its business volume totaled $6,690,000.
It had 178 local affiliated associations with a total membership of more
than 55,000 families. This wholesale deals largely in food products

and household necessities but is developing an increasing business in
petroleum products, paint, hardware, and farm supplies.

, IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN STATES

The inﬂux of Finlanders and Bohemians left its mark not only in Wis-
consin and Minnesota but also to some degree in the Central West and on
the Atlantic seaboard. As a direct result of the Finnish emigration came the
establishment of cooperatives at Waukegan, Illinois, and at Conneaut and
Ashtabula, Ohio. The Ashtabula society failed. The Coo erative Trading
Company at Waukegan has become one of the nation's argest and most

aggressive urban organizations. The Conneaut society is a live and ﬂourish-»

ing business today in spite of past difficulties which at one time seriously
threatened its existence.

The most important Bohemian cooperatives were established in Dillon-
vale and‘ Cleveland, Ohio, and at Chicago, Illinois. The largest and most
important of these is the New Cooperative Company of Dillonvale with an
annual business volume of more than $600,000.00. ’

For a number of years these societies were the backbone of the Central
States Cooperative League——an educational federation of urban organiza-
tions in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and ‘Southern Michigan. In 1934 League
headquarters were moved to Chicago; a small cooperative wholesale was
established which in 1940 had sales totaling $204,000.00 It had 86 mem-
ber retails. During 1940 the league and wholesale were combined to form
Central States Cooperatives, Inc. In 1945 business was $800,000.

On the eastern seaboard Finnish societies were established at Gardner
and Maynard, Massachusetts, in 1908, and at Paterson, New Jersey, in
1909. Following the World War a cooperative housing movement got
underway in New York City which resulted in the establishment of ﬁve
separate projects with a total investment of more than $5,000,000.00 in
apartment buildings. New York cooperators are also proud of the Con-
sumers Cooperative Services which operate seven cafeterias and two mod-
ern food stores in the metropolitan area.

Two federations have been set up in this area: the Eastern Coopera-
tive League and the Eastern Cooperative Wholesale. The number of new
societies has been increasing very rapidly in the last few years. In 1945
the wholesale had 164 member retails representing 50,000 families. The
sales for that year were $4,656,338. ‘

THE COOPERATIVE LEAGUE

In 1916 the ﬁrst effective effort to unite the scattered cooperatives of
the nation into a federal organization resulted in the establishment of the
Cooperative League of the USA. The League was created to assist old
societies in properly carrying on their business and educational aﬁairs, to

1:281

 

_..-w... ..v..._v,...___. -vI$e§zu...

help new ones get properly organized, to spread the knowledge of the
Cooperative movement throughout America; to give a sense of unity and
common purpose to the cooperatives of the nation.

For a great many years the societies of foreign born who brought co-

operation here as a part of Old‘ World culture represented the strongest ‘

element in the League. To teach the cooperative idea to individualistic
Americans seemed a hopeless task. It took the post-war diﬂiculties of the
farmers plus the trials of the Great Depression to change this situation.

III
THE FARMER TAKES A HAND

OIL AND FARM SUPPLIES

About ten years after the Finlanders and Bohemians had successfully
transplanted Rochdale principles to American soil, the farm population be-
gan a native cooperative development with a distinctly New World ﬂavor.

I

Hard times hit rural America in the early twenties. The feverish pros-
perity of the middle and later twenties passed the farmers by. They asked for
government aid but found the politicians unable to deal with their problems.
Finally they saw little hope apart from self-help. Rochdale cooperatives
handling farm supplies began to dot the country. Coo rative wholesales
specializing in commodities used in agricultural pro uction made their
appearance.

In the far west the Grange recaptured its cooperative vision and suc-
ceeded in creating the Grange Cooperative Wholesale at Seattle. In the
area west of the Mississippi river the Farmers Cooperative and Educational

Union took the lead in teaching rural people about cooperatives. The Farm- -

ers Union State Exchange of Nebraska and a long list of local coopera-
tives was the result. In the east the leadership of the Grange, the Farm
Bureau, and the Dairymen’s League established the Cooperative Grange
League Federation Exchange of New York. In the New England States the
Eastern States Farmers Exchange was born without the assistance of a
sponsoring organization. All of these developments came within ﬁve years
after the close of the War.

With the coming of tractors and the increased use of automobiles,
petroleum products became an important factor in farm life. In 1921 the
ﬁrst cooperative was formed for the distribution of gasoline, kerosene, and
oil. In 1926 the Midland Cooperative Wholesale of Minneapolis was
formed to assist local co-ops in buying these products. Three years later the
Union Oil Company of North Kansas City was organized to render a like
service in that area. (This organization has since changed its name to Con-
sumers Cooperative Association. In 1940 it built the ﬁrst cooperatively
owned reﬁnery in the U.S. and "brought in” the ﬁrst cooperatively owned

T29}

oil well.) Both these organizations soon joined the Cooperative League.
By 1945 consumer cooperatives in the U-.S. and Canada" owned 11 oil
reﬁneries and were distributing over two hundred million dollars worth
of petroleum products a year.

In 1933 seven regional cooperative wholesales formed a central buying

committee called National Cooperatives. These seven wholesales served '

727 local retail outlets scattered through the Central and Northern» states.
By 1939 the business of those regional co-op wholesales grew to 3548,-
000,000. Seven years later, in 1946, it was more than $178,000,000.

By 1946 sixteen U.S. cooperative wholesales and ﬁve in Canada were
members of National. The following table gives some idea of their size
and importance: »

PRESENT STATUS

These wholesales are only a part of the total number in the United
States. There are several more who have not yet identiﬁed themselves with
National Cooperatives or the Cooperative League. But the trend is in the
direction of national unity. .

No one knows the exact number of American families aﬂiliated with
cooperatives but the ﬁgure is estimated at more than 2,500,000. The total
business volume probably exceeds one billion dollars. This does not in-
clude Credit Unions (cooperative credit societies) which have 3,500,000
members and an accumulated capital of $300,000,000. Nor does it include
the 1,125,000 members of Rural Electriﬁcation cooperatives.

Cooperation is on the march in America. This is revealed by the statistics

.of the business volume. It isialso shown by the recent extensions into the

ﬁeld of manufacturing. Within the past few years cooperators have built
fertilizer factories, feed mills, oil blending plants, reﬁneries, pipe lines,
paint factories, barn equipment plants, and even a farmvmachinery plant for
the building of tractors.

Some of the wholesales are operating their own transport truck systems
which roar over the highways carrying merchandise from factory to whole-
sale to retail outlet.

But Consumers’ Cooperation is more than a business. It is a social move-
ment. Those who carry it on realize their constant need of knowledge and
understanding. Along side of commercial growth stands an unceasing edu-
cational effort. Nearly all the large wholesales maintain educational depart-
ments with a staﬂ‘ trained in the techniques of adult education. These de-
partments operate short term schools for managers and employees, conduct
leadership training conferences in summer and winter, maintain camps and
recreational schools for youth, sponsor discussion circles in which people
meet to ﬁnd the answers to common problems, write and circulate a vast
amount of printed matter carrying the story of Rochdale. ’

The Consumers Cooperative movement sweeps across the country like
a prairie ﬁre. Wiﬂm its democratic ownership and control of business and
industry, with its thoroughly practical system of production and distribu-
tion for use, it provides a challenging solution to many of our economic
problems. It is a new system of distribution geared to the needs of an
age of plenty. ‘

The Cooperative League of the U.S.A. seeks to coordinate and unify
these efforts. It is engaged in the constant production of materials in pam-
phlet and book form. It sponsors and directs national educational confer-
ences. It operates and maintains the Rochdale Institute which is specializing
in the training of employees in the techniques of carrying on cooperative
business enterprises and the philosophy and program or the Consumers
Cooperative movement.

PART V
TOMORROW

The prewar decade has indeed brought suffering and insecurity to a host
of Americans. Millions lost their place in industry, a great multitude lost
ownership of their land and had to accept the uncertain status of farm
tenant. Thousands who had started bravely on a program of home owner-
ship were unable to meet mortgages or fulﬁll the terms of their land con-
tracts. Bank "failures wiped out the savings of many. Business crashes left

others penniless and broken. ~

But out of all this adversity has come the deepening conviction that in
mutual aid, in helping one another, in pooling our meager resources there
is hope for the future. That conviction has born its fruit in deﬁnite eco-
nomic action. Grocery stores owned by those who eat the food sold through
them have shown their ability to compete with great business chains. Co-
operative cre'd‘it societies have 0 rated where banks failed and become
storehouses of savings and frien ly sources of credit. Farm supply stores
have thrived under cooperative ownership in spite of the most vigorous
competition. Cooperative service stations have multiplied and ﬂourished
in the face of the open hostility of the major oil companies.

And the end is not yet. Each year brings new triumphs and ‘new dreams
of cooperative. expansion. The only way cooperatives can fail is through the
failure of human beings. The movement needs all the strength and cour-
age, idealism and intelligence, which we can bring to it. Never has the
world more sorely needed its practical gospel of economic brotherhood
Asthe cooperative movement grows, the need for man power increases-
managers for its stores, technicians to operate its factories, scientists to

"man itsllaboratories, bookkeepers and auditors to handle its accounting,

clerks to sell its goods, laborers to man its productive machinery, educators
to teach its message, editors, poets, and novelists to produce its literature.

Its growth will depend on the spread of knowledge. There is the need
in every community for clear thinking idealists who will proclaim the co-
operative story and organize new societies. The growth of the movement
will be fast or slow as we are diligent or slothful in this. Chaos or coopera-
tion are the stern alternatives before the world today. Education for prac-
tical brotherhood is the crying need of the hour.

We ﬁnd our present frontiers not out west. We ﬁnd them where the
Rochdale Pioneers found theirs—in the community in which we live. Con-
sumers Cooperation challenges us to begin there, laying the foundations for
an enduring human brotherhood. America needs a generation of pioneers
cut to the pattern of the twenty-eight weavers.

A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO
CONSUMERS COOPERATION °

Foreword

AS the Consumer. Cooperative Movement swings into the second
hundred years of successful cooperation, we need more than ever
before an able, clear-cut short introduction.to consumer cooperation.

It is important to know that two and a half million American families
are members of consumer cooperatives handling eight hundred million
dollars worth of business a year. It is important to know that these co-ops
handle almost every type of goods and services. It is important to know

‘that consumer co-ops are moving rapidly into production of the goods

and services they distribute. At this writing U.S. consumer’ co-ops own and
operate 158 mills, factories, and reﬁneries. It is important to know that
before the war the 28 Rochdale weavers who started the first of the pres-
ent line of cooperatives had grown to 70 million weavers of international
cooperation. l

These are important. But it if more important to know /aow and wlay
consumer cooperation work: and what it: promireiir for tomorrow.

To this speciﬁc and important job Ellis Cowling’s “Short Introduction

to Consumers Cooperation” is devoted. Its popularity is an evidence of its

success. With this fourteenth printing it moves over 80,000. Read it care-
fully. Pass it on to some other consumer who needs to know how and wlyy
cooperation works.

New York, December, 1946 WALLACE J. CAMPBELL

 

 AUTHOR , ‘ C ~
Ellis Cowling is widely known for his lucid, au-

thoritative writing on the conpsumercooperative move-
ment. He is the author of many articles on coopera-A

tives in popular magazines, several plays including
"Tbe Spider Web,” "Tbe Anrwer” and‘ "Two One-
Act P1471" and is perhaps best known ‘for  pam-
phlet and his book, "Cooperative: in America.”

Mr. Cowling has combined the experience of an
educator with the very practical application of co-
operation as manager‘ of Mahoning Farm_ Bureau
Cooperative Association, Canﬁeld, Ohio. He served
for" two years as educational director of Consumers

 

Cooperative Services, Inc., a '-group of . eight co-op‘

cafeterias in the heart of ~ metropolitan New York.
In the summer of 1943 he was made head of the
Grocery Department of CCS, responsible for an ex-
pansion program organizing modern co-op food stores.

 

A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO
CONSUMERS’ COOPERATION

PART I
  I
THIS IS AN AGE OF ABUNDANCE
IT WAS NOT ALWAYS $0

This is an age of abundance. Walking down the main street of almost
any American town or city we see the evidence of that -fact. The store
windows are full_of attractive displays of goods———food of all kinds, lovely
clothing, radios, electrical appliances, furniture, and many other things. The

. stores are well stocked with goods and‘ if by some strange chance the supply

on hand was wiped out over night a new stock could  secured in a very
short time.

With all our abundance not all our factories have been making things to
maintain our standard of living. Hundreds of them were put at the task of
making . guns, battleships, bombs, bombers—implements of warfare which
are useful only for destruction. If all our productive machinery has been at
work making goods for use in the peaceful pursuit of abundant living,
there would have been a ﬂood of them such as the world has never seen.

It was not always so. Up until a few years ago things had been scarce.
It had been so since the world‘ was young. Things could not be produced
fast enough to supply human needs, so the rich alone enjoyed anything
more than the bare necessities of life. Work was done by hand and hand
work was very, very slow. ‘

We have such an abundance today, and the means for producing a much
greater abundance, because mankind has solved the problem of production.
At last, after all the centuries of scarcity, we have learned how to produce

vast quantities of goods.

MACHINE AGE BRINGS ABUNDANCE

How have we done it? By using machinery to ‘do things once done by
human hands. The era of machinery began in 1764 when an Englishman by
the name of James Hargreaves invented a machine that would spin more
than one_thread at a time. He named the invention after his wife——called
it a “Spinning Jenny." Then ten years later another Englishman built the
first modern steam engine. His name was James Watt. Not long thereafter
the steam engine was used as power to turn the wheels of the Spinning
Jenny. That was the beginning of a new age in human history. The age

[5]

  

of machinery had come. Ever since that time mankind has used machinery
more and more in the making of things we need. ‘

Previous to the invention of machinery most of the work of the world
was done at home—either in the house itself or in a small shop built in
connection with the home. The spinning of thread and the weaving of
cloth and the making of clothing was all done in the home by the women.
Shoes were made, sometimes by, the husband and father for the family,
sometimes in a little shoe shop run by one man with perhaps one or two
helpers. In the process of shoe making the same man would often tan the
leather, cut out the various parts of the shoe, and do all the sewing himself.
Furniture was made in little wood working shops in which the furniture
maker planed his own boards, and cut every joint and every piece with hand_
tools. -

But now that machinery is being used, very little is done in the home or
small shop. The work of the world is done in great factories in which many
machines are brought together. Each machine does some small part of the
work, and a factory worker stays day after day at the same machine, operat-
ing it as it does its particular part of the whole task.

In the making of shoes one machine cuts the sole, another sews the
tongue, another punches the holes for the laces. It takes many men and
many machines to make shoes that way, but how many more can be made
by the same number of men than was possible under the old process! This
thing of having men work in factories, each doing a small part of the work
of making something, is what we call max:-production.

Machinery used in mass-production has made possible the great abun-
dance which we know today. ' '

II

SCARCITY IN A WORLD OF ABUNDANCE ‘
A PUZZLING CONTRADICTION

One of the strangest things about our age is the fact that with all our
ability to create abundance there are so many who haven’t enough. We have
loaded stores with goods, stuffed warehouses with them, and yet only a rela-

, tively few have had all they could well use and many have had to get along
.with only the bare necessities.

The goods from store and factory have not been getting to those who
could} best use them. In many American homes there has been decades
of want. In the large majority there is scarcity of some of the comforts
and conveniences which help make civilized living possible.

This great contradiction between widespread poverty and possible abun-
dance has been the great puzzle of the twentieth century. The millions who
have been denied the chance to earn their food and clothing have grown
hopeless and despondent in the face of it. Government oﬂicials have sup-

[5]

 

 

. Young people have grown

ported a host of devices to make possible a trickle of goods to those whose
need has been the greatest. They have voted large sums for direct relief,
put men at work with picks and shovels in order to give them "something
to do.” They have loaned money on farm produce at much beyond its
market value and paid farmers to cut down their production of food and
ﬁber.

Ministers and priests have railed about the sinfulness of our easy tolera-
tion of poverty surrounded by great wealth. Students of social science have
written volumes about the problem and its effect upon human behavior.

itter and cynical in a world that has defeated
so many of their normal ambitions.

And all those who "discuss the issue come back to one basic fact: through
the use of power machinery and mass production we have mastered the
techniques for making things but we have not learned how to distribute
what we know how to produce.

In the next section we will examine the methods we have used in the
past in an effort to understand why they have failed us.

III

THE PROFIT SYSTEM
POVERTY FOR MANY-—RICl-IES FOR FEW

The machines and the factory system brought great misery to a lot of
folks in the very beginning. The misery came to the people who worked
in the factories. Hours were terribly long, wages itably low. The homes
in which the laborers lived were miserable indee . In the early years of
the factory system child labor was the usual thing. Children could tend the
machines and children could be hired cheaper than men. It wasn't an un-
usual thing for fathers to carry their children to work in factories in which
they themselves could ﬁnd no work. The ﬁrst law which the English Parlia-
ment passed regulating child labor ﬁxed the minimum age of employment
at nine years and permitted twelve hours of labor a day exclusive of meal
time. It was called‘ Peel's Act and was made a law in 1819. ’

The textile trades hired more children than adults. But the very children
who worked in the mills were often the poorest clad in all England. If the
workers were men or women the same condition existed. Those who made
cloth did not have enough clothing. The cloth which they made was for
the owners of the factories. It was sold in the world markets to make
proﬁts for these owners. In the beginnings of the factory system many in
England grew rich and prosperous but the riches were not for those who
made cloth—it was for those who built the factories.

So we see that in the very beginning of the factory age abundance and
poverty existed side by side. '
