The regional office in San Fran-
cisco is sponsoring a summer pro-
’ject involving approximately 75
people and emphasizing broad pro-
grams of political activity and
research. ‘Work of the project‘

.will include both SDS-initiated

projects and previously establi-‘
shed non-SDS projects. Ihe edu-
cational part of it will include
such topics as’: electoral poli-
tics, imperialism and its respon-
ses, agencies of change, freedom
and alienation, ideology, strate-
gy and tactics, etc. @150 is the
expected minimum cost per person,
and the project begins on June.27,
For more information, brochures,
applications, etc., write to the
regional office, 924 Howard St.,
San Francisco, Calif. 9hlO3. It!s.
an eight- to ten-week deal, and
the living arrangements will be
made to allow for informal discu-
ssion, relaxation, privacy. The
r.o. will be renting several six
to eight room flats, with eight to
ten people in a flat. This means
two people in a bedroom, a kitchen
and at least one living room.’

.Back at local SDS, meanwhile, the

informal meetings have once again
become fact-—Saturday afternoons
at h:OO, usually at the New World.
Informal meetings provide some
kind of interim government between
formal business meetings, and it
is assumed they will continue in
the summer.

Every day young Americans are dying in a war that.they don't
understand. They say: I don't know the exact reasons for this.
war, but live got to fight for the people back home. And the
people back home say: I don't know what the war is really about,
but our boys are over there and waive got to-back them up. I

It isya nightmare in which a small country is being bombed and
machine-gunned into a mass of homeless refugees~- all in the
name of patriotism and antieCommunism. American foreign policyv
is more and more dominated by militarism and Great Power arro-
gance. President Johnson ta ks about defending_freedom and
democracy in South Vietnam, but he knows as well as we do that
we are defending the regime of General Nguyen Cao Ky, a military
dictator of the worst sort, a small-time Hitler. "People ask"
me who my heroes are. I have only one—-Hitler."-- General Ky,,
interviewed in the London Sunday_Mirror, July A, 1965.

What do you do when your country drifts into a war like this?

If you don*t care about America you say: "What business is it
of mine?" or “I'll leave it to the President-«he knows best."
But if you are ashamed that America is acting like an interna-
tional bully if you are norrified when American boys are killed

I ’ 1 3 0
and maimed for no reason, then you want to stop tnis war.

Awhile_ago, most Americans-voted for Lyndon Johnson because he
said he would be cautious in Vietnam. But Johnson thought that
the American people had given him a blank check on election day;
and since then he has gone on a wild spending spree of blood and
money—- 93; blood and our money.

There are American soldiers who are dying today_because they
think we want them to. If we kept silent, we would be disloyal
to them. We march against this war because we believe that our
loyalty to humanity and to our country is far more important
than any loyalty to politicians or generals. ~ »-

The F.S.C. is a movement of people against the war. Our
activities include forums, educational campaigns, speakers,
literature tables, publication of articles, business meetings,
and public demonstrations against each new escalation of the.
conflict. People in the F.S.C. have various political beliefs--
Republican, Democrat, socialist, pacifist, independent~- and
sometimes there are a few hot debates over such things as
tactics and strategy, but we are united by a common sentiment:
this war must be stopped;

Because we are a "protest" gronp, we have a hard time
raising money. _This means we can't afford to buy ads in the
newspapers or time on radio and T{V. to push our viewpoint.

All we can do is invite you to "investigate" our organization

by coming to meetings, listening to our speakers, and reading

our literature. And, if you decide you're interested, vou can
help us plan future events. Meanwhile, maybe you'd like to be

ISSUED BY THE FACULTY-STUDENT COMEITTEE TO STOP THE WAR —Uni. of Ore.

MORGAN AND PORTER:

THE SALVATION ARMY or JMPERIALISM

- opinion by Jerry Paul Simpson

w This shall be a slantedargument,

The recent Democratic primaries in Oregon were a test between "doves"
(Howard Mrgan and Charles Porter) and "hawks" (Robert Duncan and-William
Frye). Morgan lost, and badly. Porter won, barely. one up, one down.
Nothing has changed. But whether these liberal Democrats won or lost
should not have concerned leftists. ’ _ ’ ‘

.MDRGAN.

.Morgan, running against Duncan for Democratic-nomination for Senator,
«gave a prepared speech on Vietnam at.Harris Hall here in Eugene on-£pril
, 23 rd. It was the same speech he used almost everywhere. Let's consider
' that speech. - ' '

_ Morgan laid into the personalities of Rusk and McNamara, said they

_ were incompetent advisers to the President, called them names, etc. Sounds
good on the surface. But not once did he question the system that makes
-the-Rusks and McNamaras.more or less uavoidable. The whole point was
false-. as if the problem of Vietnam were somehow dependent upon Rusk and
MNamara (both of who were appointed by Mrgan’s fellow flaming liberal,
John F. Kennedy).

What would Hward Morgan do to stop the war?. His proposal included
all the usual modsrate_points: a cease-fire (how it would be arranged he
didn‘t say), negotiations directly with the V.C., coalition government,
free elections supervised by outside.powers, etc., and lastly (both in
chronology and importance) withdrawal of American~troops. "It seemed to
me that the whole process would drag on for as long as three to five years
andsmight-never=succeed anyway. Meanwhile, what are those troops going
;to do?. Play hide-and-seek in the elephant grass maybe? ‘(Also known as
"pacifioation"—- like, "pending free elections.") Except for the point
about negotiations directly with the V.C., Morgan's proposal was identical
to L.B.J.'s propaganda.. -‘ A‘ "

We should also consider whether this proposal would be acceptable to
the Vietnamese. Twice they have been screwed by the West in these "nego-
tiations." First by the French and then by the U.S.Government. Morgan's
plan would allow the West even another chance. The issue is not negotia-
tions—- the issue is withdrawal, and negotiations are purely a technical-
ity. Any solution to Vietnam must first include soe kind of proof for
the Vietnamese as to U.S; intentions.

. Nevertheless, Morgan?s speech sounded good. The audience felt that
there was hope for peace in this candidate, and they credited him with so

much integrity that they entirelyjmissed the implications, particularly
the implications of his replies to questions. A »

Someone‘ asked him what he would do about the C.I.A. He replied that

A he would join with those other Senators who ‘are trying to bring the C.I.A.

into the U.S. Government. In other words; he would do nothing about the? ,
C.I.A.' Thenaudiencemyresponse wasrooh, aaah,.wow.,... 4

Someone‘ asked  his. opinion. of: the Domino theory: and as: a .ii_-berali . . 

Democrat he of.’ course tQ0.k_issueT mu it, more or_1ess said it:-nwhs:hogwash."' 

The Dominos can go either way,‘ he said, and then he‘ summed up‘. by. pointing
to the results of the recent anti-Communist bloodbath in Indonesia: "Not

A had, not had, not bad...." An approving snicker arose from the audience.

Charles 'Port.er;presents similar discouragement for leftists. "ciharlee" 1‘

"hawk" William Frye and another "dove" Wa1‘t‘ér"‘“$wanson.' “' '~‘«‘~'~"

Porter spoke at the University on April 26, and during the question
period I asked him: "If Senators brse and Gruening are as principled as
you say, how do you account for Mbrse's support of the overthrow of Gou»
lart in Brazil and Gruening's support of American aggression against the
Dominican Republic?" His answers were nebulous. He apparently couldn't
account for it, or didn't want to.

AP5rter.ran against.a little known person, Frye; and won.

Charlie represents the leftawing fringe of the literal establishment.
On the one hand, Charlie says-we live in a free and democratic society.
on the other hand, he says_it!s hard to get.elected without money, He ‘
doesnit see-that the two factors.contradict each‘dther. ~In shbrt; Charlie

is a £uzsy#minded.1iberal. _- .~.

Mr. Pbrter notes that evenghard liners on-Vietnam like Senator Russell '
say we should get out of Vietnam if the Vietnamese don't want us. (Russell's
remark was made during the April riots in Vietnam against the Saigon govern-
ment. ). gcharpne says that 11’ even warniks like. Russell: are .th1n1~:1r1g»"abquptj

if warniks;1‘ e Russell can consider U.S. withdrawal; why should peopie

bother to.electgfuzzy~minded_Dempcrats like Charlie Porter? .

Porter*s politics are detrimental to the American left, for his approL
aoh is based on keeping people ignorant. He plays on the ignorance of the
regular voters instead of trying tc recruit new voters by educating people
to the issues, fFor example; his approach to L.B.J.?s.propaganda 9££ens1vee~
known in 1ibera1.circles as\the;"peace offensive"-awas to say that he was 5
"grateful" fbr.it, i.e. that he was glad to see the Administration "working"
for peace in Vietnam. {what a bunch of garbege:W By praising the Adminiﬁtrae
ionls propaganda offensive, Fbrter helps Jbhnson maintain his credibility.-

“people's faith in the estab1ishment_that sends Americans into war; CharIie_‘

does his part fer the war errort.;~. ,;y
"BDRING‘FROM'WITHIN"

,_. Morgan ran_against a well known political;figure, Duncan, and lost.

_ According to_the
editorial in.the pro—war Eugene Re ister—Guard, May 27, Pbrter won because
he solfhpedaled his opposition to the war and Mbrgan lost partly because

he stressed Viehman too much.» The Register—Guard editorial did not mention,
-and I’wouldn't expect thm to—- that the total‘*deve“ vote in the Fourth ‘
Congressional district was 57.9‘% (Porter-44.6 %5 Swanson"l3.3'%) against '

The politics of Mbrgan and Pbrter are identical, regardless of the
individual tactical differences in their campaigns. Pbrter, for example,
ran as a "dove" in the Democratic primary against Duncan two years ago

wrand 1ost..“He_then wrote a letterato-the-editor to the Reggetér—Guard

wherein he expounded the virtues of Duncan, urging everyone to get out ,

and were Ibr his fellow Democrat, Mr; Robert Duncan. Duncan ﬁgtglly sup+V‘~
ports the Administrationis war; again, Charlie did his part for the war _
effort} ;If Porterfs support nfIDuncan was simply an "error" two years ’
ago, then letis not assume his judgement-at his ageu-has improved; If

‘ his support of Duncan was simply "realpolitik", then his interest is first

with the Demqcratic-Party-— other things like Vietnam are secondary. ‘In
either case,ihefssundependab1e and use1ess.1 And when Mbrgan lost to Dun-
can a few weeks ago, he said he still might support him-against Hatfiéhi.
(The respense_of.Porter and Morgan to the Oregon Democratic pro~warfreso1u- ;
tion in Medford on March 27 was to say that it was a "reasonable and respo; ‘
nsible" statement.) And now Ebrter again says (June 1) he will support
Duncan,y This is the essence of "hawks" and "doves." "” '-t ' "‘n

working class. But I am suggesting than Morgan and Porter represent
certain identifiable social and economic class attitudes.

That little

constituency in Harris Hall for Mbrgan—- that was no community gathering.

I was hard put to find someone there who looked average.

These were not

the people whose sons would probably come back from Vietnam in coffins.
These were the national bourgeoisie who have an investment (psychologically
and/or otherwise) in the status quo, and they were worried_that perhaps a
their fellow anti-Communist liberals in the Capitol had made some kind of
"error" that might plunge not only the American G.I. into a war with China
but also themselves, the national bourgeoisie. ~
