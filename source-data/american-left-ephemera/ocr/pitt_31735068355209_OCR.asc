 enne Challenges G oldwafer
On ‘Right-to-Work’ Switch    

One of organized labor’s most important rights-—earned through the blood, sweat,
and tears of decades of labor strife—-is the union shop. _
Republican Presidential Candidate Barry Goldwater, solidly and fervently sup-

3 ported by those who want “right-to-work” laws and‘ the end to the union shop, re-
cently jumped into the middle of the gubernatorial campaign in Montana with another
of his astonishing 180-degree shifts on a position he has held staunchly through the

years. He. denied he ever supported national “right-to-work” legislation.
Dr. Roland Renne, Democratic candidate for governor of Montana, politely termed
Goldwater’s statement “somewhat less than honest.” His language could safely have

been much stronger.

As a Senator, Goldwater in
1963 proposed a federal labor-
management law that would
have outlawed the union shop
unless ‘and until it were author-
ized by individual states. Gold-
water was named “Phoenix
Man of the Year,” chiefly for
his efforts in establishing “right-
to-wor ” in Arizona. In. his
book “Conscience of a Conserva-
tive,” on page 49, Goldwater
says, “I strongly favor enact-
ment of state right-to-work laws
. . . which derive from natural

. law.”

Babcock Hit Too

Renne started the exchange
by stating, quite factually, that
“Goldwater has proposed this
(‘right-to-work’) legislation na-
tionally; (Tim) Babcock (the
incumbent Governor,‘ a Repub-
lican, who seeks re-election) has
worked _for it in Montana . . .”

Goldwater fired back in a
telegram to Governor Babcock
that “It is obvious that you -are
faced with a campaign based
on downright falsehoods. Like
yourself, I never have and do
not now favor a national ‘right-
to-work’ law.”

The record shows otherwise.

Best Settlements in Years  
Feature Manylnnovations

Four giant steps on the road to an extremely suc-
cessful wrapup of_1964 negotiations were taken by Mine-
Mill in the past month, as new three-year agreements
were reached with the Kennecott Copper Corporation,
after a five-week strike, the Phelps Dodge Copper Com-
pany, American Metals Climax, and the Anaconda Com-
pany.

Although many other contracts remain to be settled,
the pattern that has been established with the big mining
companies provides many important breakthroughs to
goals which have been pointed to throughout thepast
year of strenuous bargaining preparations by the union

——locally, on a. council level, and through the National

Wage Policy Committee.

_ Following on theheels of the pattern-setting AS&R
agreement of July 23, the NWPC met late in the month

in Denver to reassess‘ the bar-

gaining positions of other coun- ‘

cils and to map strategy for the
final push in negotiations.

OLRB Okays M-M at Cobalt;
Boots Quick Steel Agreement

TORONTO, Ont.—Mine-Mill Local 1028 has been granted automatic certification
as the bargaining agent at Silver Town Mines in Cobalt by the Ontario Labor Rela-
tions Board. The ruling on Aug. 19 threw out a collective agreement between the
company and the United Steelworkers of America which was signed just as Mine-Mill's
application for certification was being filed.

“The circumstances in which and the precipitous haste with which this agreement
was made,” said the Board, “indicates to us that there was little or no prior negotia-

tion or bargaining of the terms
thereof.”

Both company officials and
Steel representatives argued at
a hearing before the Labor
Board in June that the agree-
ment they had signed was a bar
to the Mine-Mill application for
bargaining rights. Aubrey
Golden, presenting the case for
Mine-Mill, called the company-
Steel agreement “collusive.”

’ ~ indicated, however, that further endorsements may be forthcoming at another meet-

I ‘ing in early October.

Concerning Phillips’ candida-
cy, Duarte said, “The office of
state mine inspector has been
a headache and source of frus-
tration to us for more years

than we care to count. Despite
his claims that he is serving
the miners in the field of safety,
lVIr. Hersey has consistently re-
buffed or completely ignored our
suggestions, has undermined our
programs, and, in general, has
served, in our opinion, the pur-
poses of the employers.”

“We intend,” the Council
chairman asserted, “to work
with all our vigor to elect Tom
Phillips to the office of state
mine inspector, with the full ex-
pectation that he will give some
support to labor’s justified de-
mands.”

Lyndon B. Johnson
Seeks a Full Term

All Labor Seeks to Bury Barry;
Voting Record Perfect—A|| Wrong

‘For the working man, for the great mass of low and middle income earners in the United States, the coming
presidential election may well be the most important in‘ the history of the country.

V With November only two months away, labor leaders, unified as never before, are preparing a massive assault .
on candidate Barry Goldwater, the conservative with a “conscience,” who has at one time or another opposed, in

writing or public statements, flatly and without equivocation, every major proposal of the past 75 years which was
designed to benefit labor and the common citizen.

I As. the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education stated recently, after listing what Goldwater was against,
“If he is FOR anything, in terms of specific positive programs to deal withthe nation’s needs, he has yet to express

it.”

American people, is going to change during the course

Becoming ‘Shifty

For example, having sewed
up the support of the crackpot
right——from the Ku Klux Klan
to the Birchers — and having
nailed down the bulk of the na-
tional Republican organization,
he is now reaching out for the
liberal and labor: vote—-chang-
ing positions on key issues with
the dexterity of a football scat-
back. Some of these shifts, such
as his change of heart on social
security, amount to the cynical
holding of bait for specific
groups of unwary voters.

Some, such as his ﬂat denial
of ever having sponsored na-
tional ‘,‘right-to-work” legisla-
tion, are outright falsehoods.

In spite of ludicrous efforts
to explain away the worst im-
plications of his “extremism”
statement, Barry Goldwater IS
extreme. Not many politicians
can boast a perfect voting rec-
ord, no matter what organiza-
tion does the tabulation. But,
according to COPE, he has AL-
WAYS, repeat ALWAYS, voted
WRONG ‘on measures designed
to benefit the consumer, the
working man, the sick and dis-
abled, the underprivileged and
disadvantaged.

Barry Goldwater has been
consistently against those who
don’t have it quite so good as
he does.

Voting Summarized

Here are some of the high-
lights of his voting record in the

These are his anti-labor votes
only. He has also opposed such
other major advances as the
civil rights bill and the nuclear
test ban treaty.

- Go1dwater’s- overall‘ voting
score in the Senate, according
to the COPE list of key issues,
is O to 53-0 right, 53 wrong.
When his following say that in
Goldwater they have a choice,
not an echo, they are correct.
Goldwater does have a distinct
point of view, repeated over and
over in speeches, in his book,
in his voting record.

"InsuIt to Voters"

The AFL-CIO executive coun-
cil has branded the Republican
platform, written by the Gold-
water forces, as “an insult to
the intelligence of the voters,”

which “merits not mere rejec-

tion but outright disdain” from
the American labor movement.
Declaring that the attempt to
make “extremism” a synonym
for patriotism is “obvious non-
sense,” the council said ﬂatly
that “extremism means the
death of the labor movement
and the death of liberty itself.”

In analyzing the platform, the
United Mine Workers Journal of
Aug. 1 said: “The 1960 GOP
platform was no ﬂamingly lib-
eral document, but it did recog-
nize some of‘ the needs of work-
ers and did call for Federal con-

against

But Goldwater, heretofore known for his strong consistent stands in opposition to the majority views of the
of this campaign. There is already evidence of this.

cern and Federal action in the
fields of social welfare. The
Goldwater platform, on the other

hand, speaks of labor almost-.

entirely in a derogatory fashion
and speaks of social welfare
programs—when it does—almost
entirely in terms of 19th cen-

tury ‘charity’ programs to an-

swer the needs of the poor.”
Goldwater's, attitude toward
those not born to all the privi-
leges that money can buy is
illustrated in this remark, made
in a speech to the Economic

Club of New York early this -

year: “We are told . . . that
many people lack skills and
cannot find jobs because they
did not have an education. The
fact is that most -people who
have no skills have no educa-
tion for the same reason——l3w-
intelligence or low ambition.”
Also in the UMW Journal,
Justin McCarthy reports from
the Republican convention that:
“The most frightening thing
about the candidacy of Sen.
Barry Goldwater as the Repub-
lican nominee is the people
around him. . . . They are the
new generation of the people
this writer first observed at
work in Chicago’s right-wing
‘lunatic fringe’ in 1939—a quar-
ter of a century ago. Then these
people thought Hitler and Mus-
solini were doing a good job.
“You find a few of them, of
course, wherever you go in this
country. But never before have
we seen so many gathered in
one place as we saw at the re-

cent Republican national con»

vention.”

As they showed in storming
the Republican party at the pre-
cinct level, as they show in their
talk of “infiltration,” as they
show in their boasts of copying
political and guerrilla tactics of
the Chinese Communists, the
Goldwater people are playing
“guts ball” in 1964. Labor is
girding, too, for this election.
The tools are not lies, not inﬁl-
tration, not fear, but facts—facts

about the Republican nominee.‘

(topper Pree Remains at 32 cents in II. 8.

While changes ‘take Place on Wcrldllarket 

Although U. S. copper producers have clung grimly throughout the summer to
the “phantom” price of 32 cents per pound, prices of nonferrous metals and brass and
wire mill products have been on the move in recent weeks. - " A

For most of the past month, copper on the London Metal Exchange has been at
the equivalent of 40 cents or more. After months of pressure from the Chilean gov-
ernment, both Kennecott and Anaconda caved in in August and raised the price of
Chilean copper sold in Europe by 2 cents a pound. Canadian producers followed suit,
raising the price of the metal in Canada and in Europe by 2.1 cents per pound.

The U. S. producers’ price is the lowest quoted anywhere in the world, and most
market observers feel that this will inevitably mean a price boost here, although pos-
sibly not until after the signing of all new labor-management agreements. There is

speculation that at that time the
price may be hiked by 2 cents
or more.

Other observers, however, say
that copper companies are hold-
ing off because they fear that a
price increase may encourage
the substitution of aluminum or
plastics for copper in some ap-
plications.

Supply Tight

At any rate, U. S. producers
haven’t had enough copper to
meet the needs of the auto, con-
struction, electrical, and other
big industrial users of the metal.
Fabricators have had to supple-
ment their stocks with pur-
chases of copper on the New
York Commodity Exchange and
from private dealers. In mid-
August, buyers were reportedly
paying at high as 46 cents a
pound in New -York.

The Kennecott strike, recent 6

strikes in Rhodesia and Chile,
and the possibility of civil war
engulfing copper-rich Katanga
province in the Congo all are
factors in the tightening of the
market. ’ '

Brass and wire mill product
prices, after several increases
beginning last winter and"con-
tinuing into the spring of 1964,

have moved sharply upward,

again in July and August. Water
tubing, sheets, brass rod, strips,
and a.variety of other products
have been ' affected. To some
extent the mostrecent round of
price hikes has resulted from
higher prices the mills have had
to pay for copper, but the price
increases in general have been
more than adequate to cover in-
creased costs ofraw material
and have substantially benefited
the profit position of the mills.

INITIAL BREAKTHROUGH IN THIS YEAR'S EGOTIATIONS came 1n‘Los-Angeles when on Iuly 23 the Mine-Mill AS<§R Council reached agreement with

13% cents per pound since April
in the United States, but the
price on the London Metal Ex-
change, where zinc has cus-
tomarily sold at about 2 cents
under the U. S. price, has re-
cently beengabove 17 centstper
pound. The sharp increases in
London have been occasioned by
tightness in zinc supplies in re-
lation to strong demand. An
increase in the U. S. price of

-zinc may be in the offing as a

result.

A similar situation has devel-
oped in the London lead market
where lead was selling at 141/2
cents a pound in mid-August.
Later in the month, American
Smelting & Refining Company
raised its price for lead by 1
cent to 14 cents per pound.
Other U. S. lead producers had

vides a fund for each employee
equal to $80 times the number

of years of service. It can be .

drawn in "$25 per week install-
ments in the event of layoff, and,
if not used for that purpose,
goes to the worker in a lump
sum upon retirement in addition
to his regular pension. In case
of death, the amount goes to the
employee’s beneficiary.

In addition, at Kennecott,
where members of eight Mine-

Mill locals hit the bricks, the .

new contract provides for vest-
ing of unused sick leave which
can be taken upon termination
for any reason or retirement.
Again, in the event of death,
the-amount .goes to the worker’s
beneficiary. The agreement pro-
vides for unlimited accumula-
tion of paid sick leave at the

rate of five days per year. Pre-
viously, the sick leave could be
used only for‘ that purpose and
could be accumulated only to 30
days.
No Layoffs Due to
Automation

Another contract provision
which guarantees no layoffs of
permanent employees (those
with 90 or more days service)
during the period of the agree-
ment because of technological
change, automation, or im-
proved work methods is included
in the Kennecott settlement. A

major cause of the five-week
strike, the only major walkout

by the union thus far, was the

necessity to achieve job and in-
come protection for the workers,
in the light of the company’s

stated plans for increased pro-
duction with fewer employees.

Biggest Package Ever

Although the Anaconda settle-
ment, which covers some 3,700
workers at Butte, Great‘Falls,
and East Helena, Mont., did not
include a security-severance pro-
gram, it was the biggest pack-
age ever won by any union from
that company. Health and wel-
fare gains in new benefits and
lower premiums amounted to $7
per month per employee over
the three-year period.

, The 25c per hour premium pay
for Sunday work as such (even
though it is not overtime work)
was won for the firsttime in the
mining section of the industry.

Settlement between Mine-Mill
Local 837 in Carteret, N.J. and
the U.S. Metals Refining Com-
pany, a subsidiary’ of American
Metals Climax, wasreached on
August 1. In addition to winning
three weeks of vacation for 12
years of service (effective April
1, 1965), an extra day will be
given at the following intervals:
17 years, 19 years, 21 years, and
23 years, building up to four
weeks of vacation for 25 years
service. .

About 1,000 men are covered
by the new Carteret contract. 

The Kennecott agreement, rat-
ified on Aug. 14, will complete-
ly eliminate the employee con-
tribution to the health‘ and wel-
fare program by the end of the
contract period, as does the

AS&R settlement. Although the .

KCC contract covers about 4,800
Mine-Mill members, the workers
in Utah and Arizona are not yet

Allende Promises Nationalization
As Glilean Ecetion Approaches

In a meeting with leaders of the Chilean Copper Workers Fed-
eration at Kennecott’s El Teniente copper mine last month, Chilean
Senator Salvador Allende elaborated on his campaign pledge to
nationalize the country’s copper mining, smelting, and refining in-
dustry if he is elected president in the national elections set for
Sept. 4.

His proposed program, reported in
ket, includes:

OWo1‘ker participation in “Peoples Planning” of the Chilean
economy.

0 Expropriation of copper mines by the Chilean government in
order to achieve maximum production.

0 Smelting and refining of all Chilean copper in Chile.

0 The sale of Chilean copper to all countries.

0 Employment stability for copper workers.

0 Maintenance of gains won by the Copper Workers Federation
and continued sharing by workers in company earnings.

The proposals were outlined in a document that was signed by
Allende and union _leaders at the August meeting. ,

The candidate of a coalition known as the Revolutionary Front
of Popular Action, Allende is a
member of the Chilean Socialist
party—one of those comprising
the coalition.

Also contending for the presi-
dency are Senator Eduardo Frei
of the Christian V Democratic
Party and Julio Duran, a con-
servative. Observers say the
race is between Allende and
Frei, with the results now rated
a tossup. -

Either way, the U.S. copper
companies in Chile appear to be

Frei, while not “an advocate‘ of
nationalization, ha s “advocated

The fact that the recently-released.governmental study of sili-
cosis in the metal mining industry does not cover workers who are
no longer employed ‘in the mines is the basis on which Mine-Mill
last month’ lodged protests with Dr. Luther--Terry, the U.S. Surgeon
General, Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall, and Anthony J. Cele-
lorezze, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.

“Medical screening bythe companies, disability due to silicosis,

L and detection of non-disabling symptoms all operate much more

on Aug. 7.

THE MINE-MILL" UNION

Japanese Study Group Picks

  M-M as Labor Union to Visit

, DENVER, Colo.—The Japanese Mining Industry Study Team, a group of rank-
__ing executives of small mining and processing companies in Japan, visited the Mine-
Mill headquarters here on August 7 as part of a month-long information-gathering

tour of the United States.

Irving Dichter, international secretary-treasurer, and Arthur Stuart, head of the
union’s research department, answered in a two—hour interview a variety of questions
ranging from the current status of collective bargaining in the nonferrous metals in-

 dustry to political involvement on the part of the American labor movement. V
Faced with rapidly growing domestic demand for metals, industry leaders in Ja-

pan are anxious to improve their methods of developing domestic mineral resources
and to better their competitive position internationally through the development of
foreign mines. The primary purpose of the tour is to gain firsthand knowledge about

, ; - the operation of U.S. companies,
 with particular attention focused

on modernization in the mining
industry, diversification by the
companies, and increased labor
productivity. —
.But the Mine-Mill interview
showed as well a deep interest
on the part of the Japanese visit-
ors in labor-management rela-

’ tions, the conditions under which

American laborers work, and
labor’s role in the society as a
whole. They also asked about the
attitudes of federal and state
governments toward the devel-
opment of small and medium-
sized mines. "

A Report by the Officers

0:: 1964 Bargaining

HIS YEAR’S collective bargaining really got started in Jan-
uary at the National Wage Policy Conference in Tucson, Ari-
zona. Over 100 delegates participated in committee work and floor
discussion to draft the union’s 1964 bargaining program and to
elect a National Wage Policy Committee ’

About 15 workers are-

which guided and directed the course of this

year’s contract negotiations.

The delegates gave top priority to job sc-
curity issues——severance pay and protection
against layoff. In addition, the bargaining
goals included substantial wage increases,
increased shift differentials, job reclassifi-
cations, health and welfare improvements
with elimination of employee premiums, im-
proved vacation plans, and additional holi-

days.

our 1964 bargaining achievements to date. A

completely determined and united union, op-

and excellent support of the membership,‘ is
responsible for these achievement at the bar-

. It took overwhelming strike votes in al-
most all companies to convince them to get
down to serious bargaining. It took a five-

R   t C II S'I' ' C t’ ' H  
Silicosis continues to be a serious health hazard in the U. S. metal mining industry says a recently-issued report by the U. S. Public Health” ‘
Service and the U. S. Bureau of Mines, which, however, ducks a stand on the controversial issue of federal mine safety legislation. . "
Although coming up with a raft of recommendations, most of them directed at mining companies, aimed at prevention of the disease, the
report takes no position on the proposals for federal inspection of mines and enforcement of safety and health standards. ~ ’
In this respect, the silicosis report contrasts sharply with Interior Secretary Stewart Udall’s report to Congress last November, “Health and;
Safety Study of Metal and Nonmetal Mines,” which flatly endorsed the extension of federal safety legislation to such mines and which provides,
the basis for an Administration bill expected to come up for hearings in the next session of Congress. ’ , * ‘ .3
The 238-page silicosis report, entitled “Silicosis in the Metal Minin-g Industry—A Revaluation, 1958-1961,” is based on a study authorized by I 

Congress in response to recommendations submitted by Mine-Mill at Congressional hearings on mine safety in 1956. The union subsequently
lobbied successfully for appro- - - M’ -

priations to finance the survey,
which covered 67 underground
metal mines employing approxi-
mately‘20,500 workers.

-» The mines included in the
study employ more than half
of the underground metal min-
ers in the United States, and

 represent virtually all metals

mined in commercially signifi-
cant quantities in this country.
Thorough testing of mine atmo-
spheres was carried out at nu-
merous surface and under-
ground locations at each mine
to determine concentrations of
airborne silica dust.

Includes Medical Exams

Medical examinations, includ-
ing medical histories and symp-
toms and chest X-rays, were
completed for a total of 14,076
miners. Participation in the
medical phase of the study was
on a voluntary basis, and results
of examinations were kept con-
fidential, with one exception:
where the medical data re-
vealed a condition requiring im-
mediate medical attention, the
employee’s personal physician
was notified of the condition by
the Public Health Service if so
authorized by the employee.

Study of atmospheric condi-

tions. in the mines. involved col-’

lection of 14,837 samples of air-
borne dust to determine concen-
tration of dust particles. Results
were measured in millions of

particles per cubic foot". Silica

content of the dust was also de-
termined, but mainly by analy-
sis of settled dust samples, due
to technical difficulties in col-
lecting sufficiently large sam-
ples of airborne dust for meas-
urement of free silica content.

Dust samples were classified
as-excessive, i.e., as, constitut-

ing a health hazard, according

to a standard adopted by the
American Conference of Gov-
ernmental Industrial Hygienists.

13.2 percent of average daily
exposures of miners to airborne
dust were, classified by the
study as excessive, or constitut-
ing a health hazard. Every mine
studied yielded some individual
samples of excessive dust, al-
though some of the mines
studied had considerably more
excessive dust than others. In
at least 7 mines, the mine-wide
averages of all airborne dust
samples collected were exces-
sive as measured by the stand-
ard.
' Only Current Workers

' Examined

The most controversial part
of the report concerns the re-
sults. of medical examinations.
476 miners, or 3.4 percent of
the miners x-rayed, were classi-
fied as silicotic. The ratio of
silicotics ranged from 12.9 per-
cent at one mine to none at
seven mines. The percentage of
silicotics among miners would
have been substantially greater

, had the study not been limited

to currently employed miners,
as Mine-Mill Secretary-Treasur-
er Irving Dichter has pointed
out—to the Public Health Serv-
ice.

The study confirmed that sili-
cosis is- a disease that generally
develops only after years of
prolonged exposure to dust. The
percentage of silicotics in-
creases sharply among men
with more than 20 years experi-
ence in metal mining. As might
be expected, silicosis is most
prevalent among underground
workers and especially among
those classified as stope, drift,

and raise miners and other.
-“face workers.”

Three Winseveranoe Pay
In Bayard, ll. ll.llrbilralion

BAYARD, N. M. —-+ Three members of Mine-Mill
Local 890 won severance, pay checks-late in July when
Arbitrator Benjamin Aaron said that they had been laid
off because of a technological change in the company's

operations.

Sigifredo Chavez, Alfredo _A. Barraza, and Jesus R.
Hernandez received $1,050, $1,025, and $1,025, respec-
tively when the arbitration award was handed down on

July 20.

Installation of a television monitor in April elim-

I inated the need for three car dumper operators in the

crushing department. Although the company said that
Chavez, Barraza, and Hernandez, who worked in the

labor pool, were laid off be-
cause they had finished the
work for which they had been
temporarily recalled, the arbi-

trator felt that they would not

have been laid off if the tele-
vision monitor had not been in-
stalled.

Now New Contract

.At that time, the Kennecott
contract provided for severance
pay only in the case of layoff
due to automation—at the rate
of $100 per year of service.
While that clause remains in ef-
fect, the new contract provides
-job security or severance pay
for any layoff, whatever the
reason.

Equally important, the new
contract contains. a- clause which
guarantees that no layoff can
take place during the life of the
agreement because of automa-
tion, technological change, or
improved work methods. In
other words, if the arbitration
had been held today, the award
would have been. a return to
their jobs with back pay rather

Conclusions

Major conclusions presented
in the report included the fol-
lowing: ‘

O Considerable progress has
been made in the metal mining
industry in the prevention of
silicosis.

O The industry has instituted
or improved many dust moni-
toring and dust control systems
during the past 25 years; this
has resulted in marked reduc-
tions in dust exposures. Since
the development of silicosis re-
quires a considerable period of
exposure, the full benefits of
these improved environmental
working conditions cannot be
fully evaluated at this time.

0 128 cases of silicosis were
found among men exposed only
since 1935. This finding, together

with excessive dust exposures,

in some of the mines studied,
provides evidence that effective
dust control has not been uni-
versally practiced.

0 Data obtained in the study

do not permit judgment of the

adequacy of present standards.

0 Combined medical and en-‘

vironmental surveillance and
control can prevent the develop-
ment of clinically significant
silicosis among miners.

O In many instances. ventilat-
ing currents in the working
areas were not being used, to

best advantage. Recirculation of '

air particularly posed a prob-
lem in that airborne dust was
often carried from one working.
place to another.

0 Drilling, slushing, and
mucking were the most prolific
dust-producing op er a tio n s to
which men at the face were ex-
posed. Workmen engaged in
haulage and crusher. operations
were also exposed, in several
instances, to excessive concen-
trations of dust.

OThe need for better main-
tenance ‘and cleanup practices
around c r u s h e r installations
was indicated.

0 Concentrate loading and ce-
ment mixing were sources of
excessive» concentrations of
dust; however, very few work-
men wereengaged in such op-
erations. . ‘

O In view of the long latent
period for the development of
silicosis, further comprehensive
medical and environmental
studies over a period of years
will be_ necessary to develop
additional essential information
on the problem. This will in-

clude determining ifinew cases

Recommendations
-Major recommendations in-
cluded‘ the following:

0 Each mining t company
should maintain a dust monitor-
ing program conducted or su-
pervised by a person competent
in- the techniques of dust sam-
pling and interpretation of re-
sults.

(a) For determining’ levels of
exposure, dust samples should
be taken in the breathing zones
of workmen.

(b) The program should be
conducted in such a manner
that it will detect changes in
environmental conditions and
promptly locate conditions in
need of correction.

(c) Accurate and complete
records of dust conditions
should be kept. These should be
tabulated, analyzed, and re-
ported to a responsible level of
management at regular inter-
vals. -

0 Proper m ethods of dust
control should be. in i't i a t e d
promptly when the need is dis-
covered. -

(a) Adequate _ ventilation by
mechanical means should be
provided at all working places.

(b) Recirculation of air should
be held to a minimum consist-
ent with good mining practice.

(c) All ore and broken rock
should be thoroughly wetted to
reduce dust during subsequent
handling operations.

(d) All dust control devices
and materials handling equip-
ment, both underground and on
surface, should be frequently
inspected and maintained in
proper working condition to
limit to the lowest practicable
level the generation or disper-
sion of dust.

(e)Men, should not be per-
mitted to reenter a workplace
after blasting until sufficient
time has elapsed for dust and
gases to be reduced to a safe
level.

. 0 Workers should be informed
of the dust? hazards associated
with theirjob, the methods em-
ployed for the control of dust
exposure, and instructed in good
work ‘procedures to minimize
dust dispersion and in the prop-
er use of equipment. All em-

. ployees should. give their full
. cooper.ation= in-helping 

 

tain an effective dust. control
program. , ,
0- Medical examinations: ‘

(a) ‘All men entering the met- » rm;

al mining industry should have,

a pre-placement physical exam-

ination including a technically_

satisfactory x-ray film of the
chest._

(b) Periodic physical examin- I

ations including. an x-ray chest
film should be performed an-

nually on undergroundworkers, ‘

and- biennially on surface work- a . ' ‘H

ers in order to detect early sili-,  -V

cotic changes, evidence of ac-
tive pulmonary tuberculosis, or
other pulmonary disorders.

(c) No worker should be de-
nied employment for which he
is trained because of simple

_,silicos__is, but rather he should

be permitted to work in an en-

vironment with effective dust.

Mine-Mill Local 570, won a
7 - cent- an - hour wage increase
last month, but only after their
first strike at the property which

» was organized in 1941. ‘ ,
Although the contract is not

due to expire until May 31, 1965,

it had a wage opener effective- I
on June 1 this year. The com- ‘

pany’s position, from the first
bargaining meetings early" in
May, was that there would be
no wage increase.

Neither a strike vote of 98
percent nor the Federal Media-

could move the company, and _

a nine-day strike began on
Aug. 10.

Jan.-June Pro its for This Year
Show 31.3 Percent ain Over '63

Nonferrous metals companies’ profits for the first six months
of 1964 registered big gains over the profits earned in the corre-
sponding J anuary-June period last year. Higher metal prices, hefty
hikes in the prices of brass and wire mill products, and booming
metal sales are behind the profit surge.

Listed below are profit figures for 16 major nonferrous metals
companies for the first six months of 1964 and 1963. Taken as a
group, profits are up 31.3 percent over 1963’s first half.

P&A Steel Contract

THOMASTON, Conn.———Workers at the Plume
and Atwood Manufacturing Company’s brass rolling
mills have their first contract under representation
by the United Steelworkers of America—a three-
year agreement signed at the end of July.

According to the July 30 American Metal
Market, trade journal of the industry, wage increases
over that period total 7c'per hour, none of which
comes in the first year of the pact. The second
year calls for a hike of 3 cents per hour, while 4
cents an hour will be given in the third year.

Some health and Welfare benefits were im-
proved; Hospital payments, which were ‘set at $19
per day for 100 days, willlbe increased to $23 per
day for 200 days, and, in the second year, to $25
per day. Major medical coverage was increased from
$5,000 to $10,000 and the surgical schedule’s maxi-
mum will be upped from $300 to $400.

Life insurance coverage will be increased from
$2,500 to $4,000. Weekly sickness and accident pay-
ments, which were $47.50 per week -for 26 weeks,
will be increased to $55 per week for 30 weeks.

The Plume and Atwood property was repre-
sented by Mine-Mill, but Steel won an NLRB elec-
tion there on April 30 this year by a narrow margin
——the only Steel victory in a series of attempted
raidsin 1964. Some 250 workers are employed at
the rolling mills.

I look forward to .a more favorable

situation next year. I extend to you and

your membership my sincere wish that your
negotiation of new agreements will be successful
for the point of view of the mine: mill and

UMW. Steelworkers Strike in N. J.. Tenn.

230 miners, members of,District 50, United Mine Workers of
America, struck the New Jersey Zinc Company’s zinc mine at
Ogdensburg, in northern New Jersey, August 19. The company and
the union were reported far apart on wages and fringe benefits,
and no early settlement is expected. The Ogdensburg mine is be-
lieved to be the oldest zinc mine in the United States still in oper-
ation. It was closed in August 1957 and reopened in December 1961.

Another zinc mine, operated by Tennessee Coal and Iron Com-
pany at Jefferson City, Tenn., was struck on'June 8 by the Steel-
workers who were still on the bricks at Mine-Mill Union press time.
Negotiations are hung up on wages, insurance and pension issues,
and vacations. Wage rates at this mine presently run from $1.73
per hour.

Auto Makers Using More Zinc

Zinc is in strong demand for new 1965 model automobiles. Auto
makers plan increasing use of zinc diecast grilles. Ford and Chev-
rolet are switching from aluminum tail light assemblies to zinc.
Use of diecast zinc will reduce the number of components in the
assemblies by 50 percent. Chrysler-name cars will carry what is
claimed to be the largest single zinc diecasting ever produced.
35-pound diecast zinc instrument panels will replace steel. In pro-
ducing the zinc panel, an original 50-pound rough casting will be
trimmed down to its final form. Advantages are more variety in
configuration, better mounting, and rattle-free service.

Dolomite Unit
Wins Hike on
Wage Opener

BONNE TERRE, Mo.——Mem-
bers of Mine-Mill Local 618 won
an across-the-board wage hike
of 9 cents per hourvlast month
from the Valley Dolomite Cor-
poration after a strike vote car-
ried by 98 percent and strike
sanction was approved by the
international union.

The agreement was reached
on Aug. 11, with retroactivity to
July 1. This was a wage opener
only, with the contract not due
to expire until June 30, 1965.

During seven bargaining ses-
sions, some of them involving
the Federal Mediation and Con-
ciliation Service, the company
insisted that it would not grant
an across-the-board
offering instead a rate range
which would give nothing to the
labor grade. When a strike
seemed imminent, however, the
company yielded from its for-
mer position.

The new labor rate is now
$2.34‘ per hour and the top grade
is $2.71 an hour. About 65 men
are employed’ at the plant.

The negotiating committee in-

cluded A. C. Thomas, president

of Local 618; W. W. Holdman,
vice-president; Homer A. Doug-
las, financial secretary; Stanley
E. Porter, recording secretary;
Lester White; Mayford Hold-
man; Sylvain Thurman; and
James Hutchings. They were
assisted by International Repre-
sentative Jesse R. Van Camp.
Thomas Brennan was the fed-
eral commissioner.

The Indiana State Board of Health has submitted a report to Mine-Mill on its findings at the Na-
tional Lead Company’s secondary lead smelter in Indianapolis. Workers at the plant are members

of Mine-Mill Local 632.

The report gives specific data resulting from atmospheric sampling and the testing of ‘lead blood
levels of all employees at the plant. ' .
In September 1963, air samples taken at seven locations inside the plant were analyzed for lead

content. According to the National Safety Council, “The maximum concentration of lead in work‘)

room air should not be permitted to exceed 0.15 milligrams per cubic meter for continuous exposure.
This standard is generally accepted in the United States.” Of the seven samples taken, six exceeded
the standard. Two samples contained more than 10 times the concentration of lead considered safe.

At the same time, blood samples of all employees were analyzed for lead content. The Ameri-
can .Industrial Hygiene Association recommends periodic lead analyses of blood and/or urine for
workers exposed to lead fumes and states, “The blood content is the more significant index of ab-

sorption, with levels in excess
of 0.08 milligrams lead per 100
grams of blood indicative of ex-
cessive absorption and the need

for cessation of further expo-

sure.’.’
Last September, 83 percent of

the employees were found to

have blood lead concentrations

in excess of this limit. One

worker was_ found to have .62
‘milligrams, or more than seven
times the amount at which he
should have been removed from
further exposure. The average

‘for all employees in the plant

"was .147 milligrams.

The report of the Indiana
Board of Health says, “The reas-
ons for the high blood lead

levels in employees of the plant

in question are:
“1. Exposure to excessive con-

lcentration of lead dust and
_fume (inhalation) due to poor

housekeeping practices and fail-
ure of company to have in-
stalled adequate local exhaust
ventilation equipment and other
necessary engineering controls
to control lead dust and fume

evolution into workroom areas.

“2. Excessive ingestion of lead
by workers due to eating, drink-
ing, smoking in lead-contami-
nated areas and failure of em-
ployees to practice good per-

. sonal hygiene.”

As previously reported in the
Mine-Mill Union, Local 632
President William Jones,
R e co r din g Secretary Joseph
Scruggs, and International Rep-
resentative Jesse Van Camp
participated in meetings with
the State Board of Health, the
Indiana Commissioner of Labor,
and company representatives,
at which a program to end the
threat to the employees’ health
was agreed upon.

The Board of Health report
continues:

“As a result of the serious
environmental lead problems in
this plant, National Lead Com-
pany hired one of the top in-

dustrial hygiene consultants in-

the country, Mr. George Clay-
ton, to assist them in getting
these environmental problems
under control. Engineers of this

Division have been w o r kin g .
closely with Mr. Clayton and the _

, plant engineer, Mr. Rudy Sed-
. lee, on these problems. As you
. know, some employees were re-

moved from exposure at the re-

. quest of this Division due to ex-
‘ - cessive blood lead levels._ The
, vacation period for plant was

moved ahead of schedule to get
all workers out of plant for 2-3
weeks. A respirator" program

_ was begun to afford workers

some protection against lead

- dust and fumes since control of

environment by e n g i ne e ring
methods does require some time
for development and installa-

tion. The plant has been thor-
oughly cleaned and controls
have been installed on blast fur-
nace operations. More engineer-
ing controls are being developed
to further minimize worker ex-
posure to lead.’’ -

After the cleaned up plant
was reopened, testing by the

State Board of Health in July

revealed some improvement in
conditions. Thirteen atmospher-
ic samples at various locations
were analyzed. Five were below
and two, slightly above the
recommended standard. Three
samples contained about double
the recommended maximum
concentration of lead, two had
about three times, and one had
8 times the recommended maxi-
mum.

Lead blood levels were found
to have been significantly re-
duced last July. Only; 13 percent
of the workers had lead blood
levels indicating excessive ab-
sorption, compared with 88 per-
cent the previous September.
The lead blood average for all
employees was found to be .067
milligrams, compared with the
danger level of .08 milligrams.

All employees are continuing
to’ wear respirators and are
changing work clothes at least
daily.

But, according to the report

.of the Indiana Health Board,
,much more needs to be done

before the plant will be a safe
place to work. The report con-
cludes, “Much still remains to
be done. We do plan to continue
to be active in this plant until
the necessary environmental
controls are installed and the
health of the employees of this
company is fully protected from
the serious exposure to lead
dusts and fumes.”

Noting the progress made thus

.far at the Indianapolis plant,

Mine-Mill International Secre-
tary-Treasurer Irving Dichter
said, “Very few state health
authorities have demonstrated a
willingness to move in on dan-
gerous health conditions in lead
smelters under contract with
M-ine-Mill. In fact, this has hap-
pened only in Indiana and Cali-

fornia. It points up the need for
federal safety legislation to en-
forc e uniform safety stand-
ards.”.

Uranium Accident
, A 38-year-old father of nine,

Robert Peabody of Charlestown, -

R.I., died from contamination
by deadly uranium radiation re-
ceived while working at the
United Nuclear Corporation
plant in that city. Death came
to Peabody five days afteran
accidental nuclear reaction
started. Four other men were
contaminated in the same acci-
dent. The radiation at the scene
of the accident was _very much
more intense than the radiation
encountered in uranium mines,
where the chief danger is lung

Damage Suits

Two Moab, Utah miners em-
ployed in the Thornberg Mining
Company mine in Grand County
have filed suits against the Tro-
jan Powder Company of Dela-
ware. Angelo Melo and Waul-
steine McNeely seek damages of
$100,000 and" $50,000 respectively,
plus medical expenses. The men
were injured February 20 in a
blasting accident. Their claim
is that a blasting fuse purchased

from Trojan Powder burned

faster than expected and
touched off the explosion before
lighting of other fuses had been
completed.

Causes of the disease are not '
fully understood as yet because '
until recently little research had ’
been directed at the problem. ’

Scientists believe, however, that
heavy cigarette smoking -is
mainly responsible for the in-

creased prevalence of the di- I

sease in recent years. Smog, air
pollution, employment in dusty

work like mining, and inhalation , A
of industry-produced fumes and ‘
gases are also listed as con-

tributing causes.

Bill Lanko, Key:
ﬂrganizer, Dies .‘ .

NEW ‘HAVEN, Conn.—-William P. Lanko, one of the key organ-
izers of the "brass industry in the Naugatuck Valley in the late 1930’s,

’ died on July 5 at the Grace-New Haven Medical Center following

a long illness. He was 73 years old.

Born in Kiev, Russia, he came to the United States and Win- - ‘
sted, Conn. in 1911. His first job in this country, which he started
in«1913, was as a machinist in a small shop for 90c per day. He was ‘
fired when he encouraged his co-workers to join him in a ﬁght for
higher wages. Lanko was now launched upon the co1u'se and for the
cause to which he was to devote his life.

In 1920, he took a job as a top machinist at the American Brass
plant in Torrington, Conn., earning the comparatively high rate
of 55c an hour. But the lean years of the ’20’s produced wage cuts
and mass layoffs. When the disunited workers finally rebelled,

strikes in the industry were bru-

tally" smashed and hundreds of '

workers‘ in “Brass Valley” were
deported in raids directed by J.
Edgar Hoover.

, Not until the late 1930’s did a

wave of successful ‘organization

sweep through Naugatuck Val-
ley, with Lanko in the forefront
of the campaign. In 1937, the
Torrington Brass Workers Union
was formed and became Mine-
Mill Local 423. Lanko was the
first financial secretary of the
local, serving in that position un-
til 1949, when he developed high
blood pressure and heart
trouble.

Back in the plant in 1950, Lan-
ko could not remain inactive and
became a plantwide steward and
later, with his health again fail-
ing, a machine shop steward.

AH-empt at Deportation

Very close to retirement, Lan-
ko ‘on Feb. 12, 1952 was ‘served

with a warrant fo-r his arrest."

The Department of Justice,
seeking to deport Lanko after he
had lived in this country for 40
years, issued the warrant under
the McCarran Act, charging him

with being a member of a “sub- ‘

versive” organization.
Although the deportation pro-
ceedings never succeeded, they

» hung over his head for many,
-many months.

Early in 1953,
Lanko suffered a heart attack
and was hospitalized.

“Through many trials and dis-
illusionments, he never grew bit-
ter toward his fellow men,”

'wrote Angelo Sardi, a former

president of Local 423, of Lanko
in a letter to the Torrington Reg-
ister following his death. “He
had a profound and unshakable

- faith in humanity, the basis of
. all‘ great religions. To Brother

Bill, ‘Brother’ was not just a

- formal salutation amongstunion

men. It was a conviction and a

* way of life. The good work he
has done and his good examples.

will long liveafter him.”

Lesniewski, Caroline Thebarge,

office ‘secretary for the Torring-
ton local, and the officers of the .
international union joined Sardi
in paying tribute .to Lanko~—to
his courage, his integrity,.his
dedication and nobility.

Although a uto m atio n has
caused employment at the Tor-
rington plant to dwindle from
over 1,000 to the present figure
of some 200 workers, the wage
scale is one of the best in the
area —- an accomplishment due,
in no small part, to the efforts
of William Lanko. 3

Mrs. Helen Huska Lanko of Win-
sted; four daughters, Mrs. John
