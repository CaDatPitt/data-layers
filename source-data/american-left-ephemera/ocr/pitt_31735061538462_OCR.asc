No Independent Road
for fine Middle Class

All attempts to create a separate middle-class party in the past
have proved abortive, with the party ending its life in one of the
two major parties. The Populist movement,‘at the turn of the
century, was ﬁnally interred in the Democratic Party. The Wis--
consin Progressive Party, once a national party which polled ﬁve

V T million votes in the presidential election, 1924, surrendered its

ghost to the. Republican Party three months ago.

if There is no independent road for the middle class. If it
does not follow the labor movement, it will be driven into
the arms of Big Business. '

There is only one reason why the siren tunes of the “Third

Party” lack volume today. The movement for an independent

c . labor party is not yet powerful enough to constitute a threat to
the “friends of labor” and to the labor leaders \who are still j

running the old skin game of two-party capitalist politics.
\To be forewarned is to be forearrned. The “Third Party” is

NOT the labor party wrapped in a more attractive package. It is

the old capitalist party with its face lifted and its name changed.

, Don’t be fooled by substitutes. The real ﬁght is the ﬁght for the f if i
 independent political party of labor based on the trade unions
and supported by the poor farmers and the small businessmen.

The Time Is NOW!

“Yes, it is true that labo-r needs its own party, but it is still
too- early to form it.” . ‘
p This argument comes from trade union leaders who are now
compelled to reco-gnize that the workers have been driven into

i L’ a blind alley by capitalist politics. It is their last stand against

the growing demand for the creation of a labor party.

Plausible as this argument may appear at ﬁrst glance, one
thing it is not: it is not new.

Almost as long as there has been a labor movement in
the United States, there have been champions of the labor
party in the trade unions. And for almost the same length
of time the bureaucrats have opposed the labor party with
the argument: “Now is ‘not the time.” '

, Prior to the organization of the CIO, they said it was pre-
mature to form a labor party because the trade‘ unions were, too

i . weak. Only the skilled workers enjoyed union protection; in the
mass production industries, company unions and the open shop .

prevailed. The main task was the organization of the unor—
ganized.

But this task itself was made more difficult because the state ’

and national legislatures controlled by the capitalist parties gave
legal protection to company unions, company spies and strike-

 breakers, breaking strikes with injunction laws, state troops and L
deputized thugs. Even at this time what a boon a labor party i

would have been, if only in easing the ro-ad to union organi-

l zation! '

i,i_Always "Too Soon" .
After the great CIO drive which swept steel, auto, rubber,

glass, aluminum, packinghouse into the union ranks, it became
patently ridiculous to speak‘ of the “weakness” of the labor move-

11

 

 

a “g‘reat'friend o-f labor” had moved into the White House and if I 
had brought with him into Congress and the state capitals many: ‘ ~ 
other “friends” from the Democratic Party. pp A A
According to this myth,so carefully built up by union bureaué R
’ Wcrats and Stalinist bureaucrats, Roosevelt virtually organizedthe

CIO single-handed, and all of the concessions and'pro-labor ,_
legislation won in this period were handed to the workers on a .g. 
silver platter by the man in the White House. It is diﬂicult to A
argue against a myth. But the facts are clear.

Wherever the workers won, the victory was due to their
own strength and their own militancy. Wherever they lost, ' , _ ,.
they could thank the “friends of labor” on whom they relied. 

The “Little Steel” strike was broken in 1937 by Democratic V
governors elected by CIO votes in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illi- S if
nois, When Roosevelt was asked to speak out against the use of P A
the National Guard he belted the steelworkers in the face with C
V. his infamous declaration: “A plague on both your houses.”

L’, L’ Despite these sharp lessons, Murray, Hillman and the Stalin.-V"
if i ists continued to hold the halo over Roosevelt’s ‘head. Naturally,
a labor party would be premature as long as a saint sat in the

President’s chair. But the workers were beginning to see the real

facts. Although they continued, with diminishing enthusiasm, to

follow Roosevelt until his death, the most progressive union mili-

‘ tants had turned their backs on the Democratic Party. Not all if —
 the artful demagogy of Roosevelt could make the party" o-f the
 Wall Street gang, the big city bosses and the poll-tax Congress-

P * men, attractive again for the organized workers.

Non-Partisan League
, and PAC ‘ .
_ To elect Roosevelt, the trade union leaders were compelled, to , A if  "S A
organize the workers into a separate political body: Labor’s N on. P V  ,
Partisan League in 1936, and the Political Action Committee of . S A

‘ and their families. But in aim and program they were not labor

L .Altho:ugh LNPL and PAC drafted their own’ programs, they
“ hadrno means of demanding action; they guaranteed to support
T Dem/ocraitic politicians, who then felt free to act as they pleased
——-or rather, as Wall Street pleased. The best that LNPL and
~ PAC’ could hope for was a few crumbs. A few crumbs for
p 9 the millions of votes that decided every major election since 1936!
 . Not only was the time ripe for a labor party, but without
. ’ organizing the workers independently, without bartering the com-
' bined millions of union votes, without betraying the deepest aspi-
(_ rations and interests of the workers, the Democratic administra-
—L  ‘ tions in'Washington for the past ten years would have been
impossible.

 if  , Whaf Counfs Is Power V A I ~ —. H

4 r if The crowning argument of those who keep postponing the

H labor party to some time that never comes is the theory of the
“lesser evil.” It is true, the more ho-nest admit, that Roosevelt

was becoming less friendly to labor all the time. But what was

,j T " V i the alternative? If the trade unions ran their own candidates,
they would split the Democratic vote and a Republican like

i Landon, Willkie or Dewey would be elected. And to make the
bogeyman even more terrifying, they never fail to recall the
odiousmemory of Herbert Hoover.

But one little fact punctures this argument completely: There
were less than three million organized workers during Hoover’s
administration. He could slug the workers’ movement without

~ fear of counteraction or reprisal. H

Today any president must count with the largest, the most
f, a “conscious and the most powerful trade union organization
in history. Short of establishing an outright dictatorship, not
even the most reactionary president could ignore this formid-
able, organized power.

 C Now suppose for A moment that to the organized economic
power of the trade unions there is joined the organized political ~
H T power of the labor party. Suppose that the labo-r party in its

.13

 

 

iﬁrst presidential election polls only one-third of the popular vote’ » . " t 

——l2,000,000. Suppose that the labor party wins one-third of
the seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives and
an equal number in the state legislatures. (This is not at all far—
fetched; if anything, it is an understatement of the electoral power
of the union members, their families, friends and their supporters
"among the nation’s poor.) Can anyone conceive of a Republican
President and a Republican House under such conditions acting
in the style prescribed by Ho-over? .
Henry Ford was a friend of Hitler and he” acted like Hitler
to the auto workers until they shut down River Rouge and made
him sign a union contract. What counts in politics as it does in
union business is NOT promises, gratitude or good-will. What

u counts is power.

Labor’s weakness permits “progressives” to act like gre-
actionaries. Labor’s strength makes reaetionaries pause
many times before they yield to their natural impulses.

_ When indeed will the time be ripe for the formation‘ of ag . /
labor party? This question the slippery-tongued gentlemen always"

evade. Weneed not wait any longer for their evasions and am-
biguities, for their procrastination and delays. We have seen how
they postponed, blo-cked and sabotaged the labor party through
the depression, then through the days of the great rise of the
CIO, then through the war. And now in the midst of the gigantic
postwar struggles they are still not ready.

The Time for Waifing Is Over! .

But the enemy is not waiting. Acting through its lackeyst in
Washington, Wall Street is crashing its ﬁst down on the working
population. The FEPC is slaughtered. The open sky is becoming

the ceiling on prices; fact-ﬁnding boards cut the wage demands‘

of striking workers. Plants, mines, railroads, entire industries are

seized by the government to force the workers into unequal battle T

with the state instead of individual employers. Truman was pre-
pared to go into the strikebreaking business in a big way by using
the army, navy and coast guard to smash the projected maritime
strike. And Truman and Congress vie with each other to see who
canplace the worst labo-r-crippling laws o-n thestatute books.

Shall we wait, politically paralyzed, politically disarmed, polit-
ically impotent, until organized labor is bound and gagged? Shall
we wait until the unions are beaten, defeated and cut to pieces,
robbed of their treasuries, persecuted by capitalist courts and
capitalist laws, tied hand and foot by arbitration, crushed by

e armed forces? Shall we wait until Wall Street brings down the
"iron heel of military dictatorship?

The time for waiting is over. The time for action is now. The
independent labor party must be organized immediately.

The unions stand at the peak of their strength. They repre-
sent a formidable power. The workers have emerged from every
strike undefeated.—every strike but the railroad strike. And there
the setback has tom the blinders off the eyes of the entire work-
ing—class population. It is alert, militant and eager to repel the
attack of labor’s enemies.

Great Victories are possible~—o-n one condition: the knot must
be untied that binds the political arm of labor.

The independent political party of the working
class and the poor farmers —— the LABOR _PARTY——
must be built NOW!

with a dangerous attack by the capitalist government. The great

A strength of the unions repelled the attack—-but only temporarily.

The Case Bill was killed, but some of its worst provisions have been
passed by Congress as the Hobbs Act. Truman’s forced labor bill is

still before Congress. Congress killed the new minimum-wage bill

and now has driven the last nail into the cofﬁn of price control.

I A labor party cannot be postponed. The SOCIALIST WORKERS
PARTY calls upon all workers to take action in their unions: I
1. By passing resolutions committing their organizations to the
I immediate formation of a labor party. I
2. By demanding the convocation of a Congress of Labor—AFL,
CIO, Railroad Brotherhoods, etc.—to draft the following program:
a. Mass action to ﬁght anti-labor laws; _
b. A sliding scale of wages to meet the rising cost of living;
c. The launching of a labor party. '
The SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY invites all militant workers who
agree with this program to join its ranks. A strong revolutionary

workers’ party is the best assurance for a successful struggle for the

The Anti-Labor Offensive

Every worker must be troubled by a paradox which stares hiin ‘qr.

in the face today. He sees the trade unions at the peak of their

W strength, numerically stronger and more powerful in action than

they have ever been, and yet at the same time these unions ap-
pear practically helpless before the offensive of Wall Street’s

L President and Wall Street’s Congress.

One after another, the biggest monopolies in the country were
paralyzed by great strikes and then forced to concede substantial

‘wage increases. Neither corpo-ration propaganda nor threats could

weaken the strike front. For the ﬁrst time in American labor .his-

. tory, scabs and strikebreakers played a negligible role against the

solid array of strength built by the unions.

Yet this unprecedented power appears practically impotent
today before the offensive of the capitalist government. After a
series of effective and successful strikes that began last winter, the
situation has been turned upside down in the one short week
that followed the end_ of the railroad tie-/up.

Spearheaded by President Truman, Congress is driving

through the most reactionary, labor-crippling laws seen in

this country since the open-shop days that followed the First
World War.

The entire labor movement is alert to their terrifying conse-
quences. From every union, from every shop a great outcry is
heard for resistance and action against the offensive Big Business
has launched from the White House and Capitol Hill. But to

date this swelling shout appears to be a voice crying in the wilder- r

ness. Fourteen million organized workers, invincible yesterday on

g the picket lines, today give the impression of trying to stop an

onrushing tank with shouts of protest.
The simple truth is this: the labor movement is politically un-

. prepared and unarmed. During this Critical phase of its. War

‘N.

against the proﬁt-greedy billionaires, organized labor ﬁnds itself a

without political weapons. — T
For as long as memory can recall, the labor leaders have be-
guiled the workers with the ﬁction thatythe government was the

impartial umpire between the classes, that this umpire was even :

inclined to stretch impartiality to the point of friendship with the
labor movement. When the blindfold began to slip a little during
the war under the pounding of Roosevelt’s regimenting decrees,

the Hillmans, Murrays and Greens quickly pulledpit back into 

place again.

The "Friend of Labor" T
They assured everyone that the “great friend of labor” in the

White House had been misled by bad advisors, and in any case”

that these were merely emergency measures that would die with
the termination of hostilities. As uneasiness began to grow in the

ranks and .opposition to their surrender policies mounted, the i 1

political program of the trade union leaders became restricted to

one plank: no independent political action of the unions, lino

labor party.
Thus in a series of tragic but inevitable steps the criminal,

. cowardly leaders of labor led the workers into the gigantic trap -

openly prepared by the monopolies. At the rim of the trap, wait-
ing for the blindfolded workers, was Truman, “the friend of
labor,” armed with the big anti-labor stick prepared by his pre-
decessor Roosevelt, also a “friend of labor.” The great pains suf-
fered by the workers came not so much from the injuries them-
selves as from the fact they were dealt by a “friend of labor.”

Everywhere workers are asking: Why are we so strong

on the picket line and so weak before Wall Street’s puppets
in Washington? ,What next?

The clear, unavoidable answer is that labor must have its own «

party, a labor party based. upon‘ and controlled by the trade
unions. Unless such a party is built, and built rapidly, unless
such a party takes control of the government, the Wall Street

gang will use the present repressive legislation as the ﬁrst iron ‘ A‘ W‘ W

hoops of a military dictatorship. The danger is grave. Let/no one
mistake it. i - ~— . ‘

e 0 The time is ripe for the organization of a ‘labor party. The
trade union movement is prepared for it.

.What then blocks the road? The very same trade union bu-

ll reaucrats and the very same Stalinist bureaucrats who have

blocked the road up to now and led the workers into their pres-

ent peril. They are like the Bourbons of old: they learn nothing.

‘They have no program of action, no solution to the present”
— crisis, no plan for mobilizing on the political arena the formid-

able power of 14,000,000 organized workers and their families.
Instead they bemoan “the accident” of Truman’s accession to
office; they call for a return to Roosevelt’s policy. Truman, they
say, has “betrayed” Roosevelt.

By thus conjuring up the ghost of Roosevelt the bureaucrats
are trying to keep the labor movement wandering in the grave-
yard of capitalist politics, supporting capitalist “friends of labor.”

Truman's Policy Forged by Roosevelt
Did Truman betray Roosevelt’s policy? This is not only a lie,
it is a stupid lie. There was in reality no such thing as a “Roose-
velt policy.” There was only a Wall Street policy to which Roose-
velt, lz'ke_Truman, faithfully adhered. m__,\ ’ 0
i It is true that Roosevelt was more skillful than Truman in

. r applying this policy and deceiving the workers. But then Roose-
V e velt did not face national strikes in auto, steel, packinghouse, coal

mining and railroads in quick succession. A
Nothing that has been done by Truman is original. Practically
every link in Truman’s anti-labor chain wasforged under the

_ Roosevelt administration.

The seizure of struck plants and industries was inaugurated

 Roosevelt during the wartime mine strikes.

 The run-around and kick-around of the railroad workers; de-
mands began tmder Roosevelt in 1943.

The “co»0linig-off” provisions of the Case Bill are borrowed —

from the “cooling-off” provisions of the Smith—Connally Billto

, which Roosevelt objected solely on the grounds that it would be -
, ineffective for preventing strikes. a ‘ . V
Truman borrowed his labor draft directly from Roosevelt who ' t ’

p 5

 

 

 

wrote to Congress on June (‘'25, 1943: “I recommend that the

Selective Service Act be amended so that persons may be in-
ducted into non-combat service up to the age of 65. This will
enable us to induct into military service all persons who engage
in stoppages or other interruptions of work in plants in posses-
sion of the United States.” i S V

. I

Union iBureaucrafs Befray

The record is clear. Truman learned his anti-lab-or political‘
methods in Roosevelt’s school. Truman was personally chosen

by Roosevelt as his successor. It was not Trumarf who betrayed
Roosevelt, but the trade union and Stalinist bureaucrats who
betrayed the labor movement by supporting these capitalist

“friends of labor.” By advocating the same policy today, they  9
continue? this betrayal under far more dangerous conditions.

  i II
The "Third Party" Fraud

 / “Labor statesmen” and their Stalinist camp-followers are very L
\ angry today——and they have every right to be. They expendedd
millions of dollars from union treasuries and workers’ pocket-

books to elect “friends of labo=r”—and no-w the “friends of labor”
headed by the President himself have turned up in the camp of
the enemies of labor.
But anger and cursing won’t protect the unions or win an
election. The workers want to know: What is to be done now?
The master-minds say that Truman will never again receive
the votes o-f labor. Whitney has pledged part of the treasury of
the Trainmen’s union to defeat him. - L
’ But who will replace Truman? From what party will the
new “friends of labor” be elected? These questions reduce

W all the brave shouting to an inaudible whisper.

These gentlemen—the most vociferous among them being the
Stalinists——reluctantly admit now that as between the Democratic
and Republican parties the workers are choosing between the
devil and the deep blue sea. Yet they remain opposed to- an
independent labor party based on the trade unions. .

Such a party, they say, would isolate the workers from the
rest of the population and therefore insure defeat at the polls.
Hence what is needed, they conclude, is a “Third Party” to be
headed by the “progressives” from both capitalist parties, by
such men as Henry Wallace, Ickes, Morgenthau, Pepper, La-

V Guardia and others.

"Buf Nof Now"

’The strangest thing about the self—appointed leaders of the
“Third Party” is that not one of them favors its creation now.
Wallace, Morgenthau, the newspaper PM—pride and joy of
the millionaire Marshall Fie1d—are all against it today. The

 

 

 

 

Stalinist Daily Worker says talk of its immediate creation is “A
plot of Trotskyists and reactionaries.” All of them pareplecturing
the workers that there is still a good apple in the rotten barrel,

that labor must remain loyal to the Democratic Party.

All of them are hanging on to the Democratic Party for dear 1
_ life—despite the fact that the Democratic Party, like the Repub-

lican Party, is just another way of saying huge proﬁts, high

prices, lagging wages and anti-labor laws; in brief, another way
i of saying Wall Street. But in their own way, Wallace & Co. are ,

right. They see no basic difference in program between the so-

called “left wing” of the Democratic Party and a “Third Party.” D

Same Anfi-Labor Program

The criticisms of the millionaire Morgenthau are a good ex-D i

am le. He condemns Truman for betra in Roosevelt’s ro ram

p O O C I y g 0 P g
and as a result‘ failing to curb inﬂation and stop strikes. What is
this but a choice of one anti-labor program over another?

Skyrocketing prices began during the war under Roose-
velt. It was Roosevelt who froze wages by the device of the

“Little Steel” formula. Every proﬁteer knows that the “Big

Steal” began under Roosevelt.

Morgenthau is bitter against Truman because he disbanded“
‘the War Labor Board and therefore could not prevent strikes. ~
But the workers were bitter against Roosevelt because he created‘ if
the War Labor Board which denied wage demands, buried

grievances and throttled strikes. . g
The difference between Morgenthau and Truman is over how

best to hamstring the labor movement. Truman wants to do it

openly, by means of Congressional action. Morgenthau wants to
pull the wool over the workers’ eyes, and then do the hamstring-
ing by presidential decrees and presidential boards.

, In essence theseare the differences between the “Third Party”

D ~ and the Democratic Party, and the so-called “progressives” can
i see no reason why these differences cannot be reconciled within,
” e , the framework of the Democratic Party. T -

But can labor go it alone? Doesn’t it need the suppiorto-fl the

if a poor farmer, the shop keeper, the insurance salesman and the  “  

 

 

 

 

 

bank clerk? True enough, no sane person would deny the need.

But how is this -support to be won?

How Labor Wins Support

B of the Middle Class

First, by recognizing the real community of interest that exists
between the workers and the lower middle class.
Both classes are oppressed by the same tax burden they have

to carry to pay the cost of capitalist wars. Both classes suffer at '
. the hands of the monopolies: factory workers receive low wages,

the poor farmer pays exorbitant prices for machinery.

Sixty Families revel in a golden paradise that is made possible
by the blood, sweat and tears of the worker, farmer and small
businessman. Middle class and working class have one common

as enemy: monopoly capitalism. That is why they can and must
‘unite around one program whose aim will be to drive out of
power the government of banks and industrialists and establish‘
W a government of_ workers and farmers. '

Second, this program requires the power of organization. And
this power exists ﬁrst and foremost today in the trade unions
which are in the forefront of the ﬁght against monopoly capital.

Farmers and small businessmen are in the nature of things
isolated from one another and not easily organized. They can be
politically effective only by supporting the political party of the

working class—the labor party. It would be the height of folly \

to disorganize and disfranchise 14,000,000 workers through a

“Third Party” when it is possible to give organization and‘

strength to the middleclass through a labor party.

The support of the middle class will never be obtained by -

lahor’s surrendering its independence and its program in a
“Third Party” dominated by Wallace, Ickes and Co.

These gentlemen do not represent the interests o-f the middle '

class. They are imposters whose role is to deceive workers and
farmers alike in the interests of Big Business. They denounce
labor’s struggles because, they allege, the middle class will be
offended.  '

By thus artiﬁcially dividing the workers from their natural
