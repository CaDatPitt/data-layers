In estimating the far—reaching signiﬁcance of the elections,
it will not detract from the greatness of the electoral triumph
I of November 7 to point to the closeness -of the vote and
l ; how dangerously near the reactionary Hoover-Dewey and the
K pro-fascist America First crowd came to winning. Nor will
A it minimize the magnitude of the electoral victory if, while
recording the fact that the G.O.P. campaign policy of obstruct-
ing the war effort, of class division and anti-Communism failed
to succeed at the polls, it is pointed out, nonetheless, that the
Red-scare, the Hitlerite issue of anti-Communism, as well
as the poison of anti—Semitism and Negro baiting, were used
to advantage among certain sections of the population. In
fact, these after-effects of the G.O.P. campaign present a series,
of unsolved problems jeopardizing the unity of our people and
the solidarity of the United Nations.

f_On1y by signalizing these ‘dual but dialectical aspects of the‘ ,

V evaluation. "For this over-all approach is necessary to appre-

ciate more fully] the odds encountered, the victory achieved’

to examine some of the outstanding facts of the election
’ returns

 

‘ I. THE ELECTION RESULTS

HE PRESIDENT was re-elected with 432 electoral votes

to Dewey's 99-, and with a popular plurality of over three
and one-quarter million out of some 47 million votes cast. In
other words, the total popular vote as well as the presidential
plurality is slightly under that of 1940. In fact, it is the closest
presidential race since 1916.

The large vote for Dewey, as well as that for many of the
isolationists who were also defeated, cannot be minimized.
However, it would give a false picture and lead to incorrect
conclusions if electoral comparisons were based solely on
quantitative consideration and the ﬁgures of 1944 and 1940.

A number of factors should be borne in mind, including
the following:

(1) Approximately 80 per cent of the armed forces, over
eight and one-half million men and women, were disenfran-
chised and unable to vote in these elections due to reactionary
Republican and Southern Bourbon sabotage. Yet it should be
remembered that Roosevelt's majority among the some two
million-odd soldiers’ vote cast, exclusive of the South, ranged
from 65 per cent to 77 per. cent.

(2) Several million war workers, outside of the South, were
disqualiﬁed from voting due to archaic and undemocratic
state voting requirements. ‘

(3) While the presidential contest was close, the majority
of those voting for Dewey stand for victory and, in the main,
support the foreign policy of the Roosevelt Government.
These voters accepted at face value Dewey's promises of inter-
national cooperation to win the war and secure the peace.
Moreover, they were inﬂuenced by partisan considerations, in-

10

 

 

cluding the. positions taken by Governors Saltonstall and
Baldwin, as well as Republicans of the type of Eric Johnston.

The New Congress

Next, and of great signiﬁcance, are the results of the
Congressional campaign. The new Congress, the 79th, will
have some eighty new faces. It will have 244 Democrats in
the House as compared to 222 in 1940, with four seats still in
doubt. It will have 57 Democratic senators, the same ﬁgure
as in 1940, with one Senatorial race still in doubt.

But the important thing is not merely, nor so much, the fact
that the Democrats will have an increased majority in the
House and will retain their majority in the Senate. The deci-
sive thing is the qualitative changes which have taken place
in the composition of both party delegations in the House
and Senate.

A vital part of the core of the reactionary, defeatist and iso-
lationist bi-partisan groups in both the Senate and House now
have been eliminated. An inﬂuential number of pro-Roosevelt,
pro-United Nations and pro-labor Congressmen have been
elected‘.

From the Democratic side, the 79th Senate will be immeas-
surably strengthened by the absence of Champ Clark, “Cotton
Ed” Smith, Robert Rice Reynolds, D. Worth Clark and Guy
Gillette, and by the presence of Myers, Magnussen, McMahon
and Taylor. From the Republican ranks there will be missing
the arch-isolationist Senators Nye, Danaher, Davis and H01-
man, and there will be added pro-United Nations supporters
like Saltonstall and Morse.

In the House of Representatives, such isolationist and red-
baiting spearheads like Fish, Dies, Maas, Day, Costello, Stames
and Busbey have been removed. On the other hand, some
two—score progressives and anti-Hitlerite Congressmen have

V been elected from Pennsylvania, Washington, Illinois, Con-

necticut, Ohio, California, West Virginia, etc. All this will
11

  


E

 

help cleanse the political atmosphere in Washington and re-
inforce the Administration’s position and the nation's war
effort. .

These changes in both houses of Congress, together with the
greater strength of the democratic camp, create the conditions
for bringing about an entirely new relationship of forces in
Congressfar beyond the quantitative changes involved. These
changes make it possible to mobilize the majority of Congress
actively to support the nation's war and post-war program.

In analyzing the results of the elections, mention should also
be made of the fact that the number of State Administrations
under Republican control has been reduced from 26 to 22.
Pro-Roosevelt Democratic governors have been elected in
Washington, Ohio, Massachusetts, Missouri and Idaho. Al-
though data is incomplete, it appears that favorable changes
have also taken place in the composition of a number of
State Legislatures, including those of Illinois, Michigan, Penn-
sylvania, and Washington.

FDR—’rhe Na+ion's Candiclafe

There are a number of other aspects of the presidential and
congressional vote which contain important lessons. These
pertain to the class, nationality and geographical composition
of the vote. And these warrant exact .and detailed study,
state by.state and election district by election district.

There are not sufficient data available at this time to make
more thanla preliminary and rough estimate of some of these

facts. But among certain things which can be noted are the .

following: .

. The main electoral strength of the President continues to be
in the large industrial centers, especially from among the
working people, including the mining areas.

The elections also show that the inroads into the rural areas
which the reactionaries have been able to make in and around
the‘ Republican Party since 1938, and particularly during the
1942 elections, have been checked and in some states offset.

12

 

 

 

This is evidenced by the vote in the South and the West Coast
states. It is also true in regard to the Roosevelt vote in up-
state New York and downstate New Jersey, and, in a more
limited way in regard to certain rural areas in Minnesota and
Illinois. This indicates the realistic possibilities which now
exist to help bridge the gap between the urban and rural
sections, especially as the policy of national unity is developed
further in the post-election period in such a way as to reach out
and inﬂuence wider sections of the farming population.

‘ Likewise, the elections demonstrate that Roosevelt was
truly the candidateof a broad national unity. In addition
to the working class and a substantial middle class vote which
Roosevelt obtained, important sections of ﬁnance capital like-
wise supported his candidacy and foreign policies, even though
powerful sections of business and ﬁnance supported Dewey.
While there are few election statistics to prove this in terms of
votes, this is indicated by the position of the New York Times
and by the stand taken by such outstanding representatives
of Big Business as Stettinius, W. Harriman, Donald Nelson,
J. Byrnes, A. Higgins, Henry Kaiser, and others. A

As for the Negro people, with few exceptions the pro-Roose-
velt vote in the main Negro communities reached what may
be an all-time high- The same is true for the vote of the
Jewish people and the Americans of Slav extraction. The
Polish vote continued as in former years to be predominantly
progressive and pro-Roosevelt. The Italian vote exceeded all
expectations and, despite some support for Dewey, was pre-
dominantly pro-Roosevelt. Even the German-American vote,
which was heavily pro-Dewey, showed sizable support for the
President. However, among Americans of Irish extraction.
there were certain defections away from the Roosevelt camp;
although here there was no uniform trend and no pronounced
swing to Dewey.

Concerning the geographical areas, Roosevelt and his sup-
porters won a definite and decided lead in most of the Atlantic
and Paciﬁc states. Despite the Republican maneuvers and

I3

 

f"’—‘“"“‘—“‘ “

heavily ﬁnanced anti-Roosevelt “revolt,” the traditionally
Democratic South remained united behind the President.
However, the anti-Roosevelt, anti—Negro and anti—labor cam-
paign of the Martin Dies, Germanys, O’Daniels and “Cotton
Ed” Smiths unquestionably was a factor in reducing the popu-
lar plurality of the Roosevelt vote in the South as compared
with 1940. Yet it is also a fact that the struggle against the
Southern Bourbons and their Republican colleagues, which
embraced all classes and patriotic groups in the South, re-
sulted in a national unity movement which promises basi-
cally to alter the relation of forces within and around the
Democratic Party in the South, in favor of progress and democ-
racy.

The Non-Parﬁsan Approach

One additional fact concerning the election returns needs
to be noted. It is a fact of major importance which helped

determine the outcome of the elections. The presidential

. vote this year revealed a crossing of party lines, of bi-partisan

and non-partisan voting, on a larger scale than that equalled
in any previous national election campaign.
While the majority of the electorate in such states as Con-

necticut and Minnesota cast their votes for a pro-war Repub-A

lican gubernatorial candidate, they also voted in their ma-
jority for Roosevelt. Whereas the majority of the electorate
in Massachusetts and Oregon voted for the Republican sena-
torial candidates who favor international collaboration, the
presidential plurality went to Roosevelt.

In a number of congressional races the non-partisan ap-
proach of the electorate to candidates and issues was even more
pronounced. For instance, in such contests as those which
led to the defeat of Fish and Nye, as well as to the election
of Marcantonio and Powe1l—both of the latter obtaining a
popular majority on all three tickets, Democratic, Republican
and American Labor Party—the trend towards splitting party
tickets, towards exercising a discriminatory non-partisan ap-
proach was eminently successful. And this was fostered, not
only by labor and the Communist Political Association, but
also by leading independent Republicans like Senator Ball,
Bartley Crum and Russell Davenport.

While this non-partisan tactic was limited in its application
in the elections, nonetheless it played a big role in helping
re-elect Roosevelt and in removing from high office a score or
more of defeatists and isolationists. The further development
of this approach and tactic is one of the keys to most eﬁectively
shape political realignments in the post-election period within
and around the two-party system and along democratic lines.
It is one of the keys to strengthen national unity.

II. NATIONAL COALITION SECURES VICTORY

N THE LIGHT of the election results and trends, the ques-
I tion inevitably arises: how was this victory secured? Before
answering this basic question, it is crystal-clear even from an
examination of the close election returns, that victory on No-
vember 7 was not inevitable. It is clear, as Earl Browder
has stressed, that if any one of the major points of the desper-
ate and reckless tactics and strategy of the reactionary Repub-
lican high command had fully succeeded, then the outcome of
the elections would have been radically different. Then, too,
the outcome of the war and the efforts to attain a durable
peace would have been placed in jeopardy. For this strategy
consisted of obstructing the military conduct of the war, creat-
ing hostility and resentment against our British and Soviet
Allies, provoking industrial conﬂict and stirring up of national
discord and strife, etc., particularly through the weapon of
anti-Communism and anti-Semitism.

But victory was achieved. The election results were, in the
main, positive and favorable. This is so because of several
vital factors. Amongst these the following should be noted:

First of all, these elections were held-duringvthe height of
the anti-Axis war. They took place at a moment when the
main military-political strategy and policies developed by our
"Commander-in-Chief and the Government, based on the unity
of the anti-Hitlerite coalition, were, and are leading the coun-
try, in unison with our Allies, to victory. This was one of the
dominant factors which stimulated the organization of broad
non-partisan support behind Roosevelt. This inﬂuenced the
majority of the electorate to take the unprecedented step of
electing Roosevelt to a fourth term.

16

 

 

 

The Democraﬁc ‘Parry

Another factor which helped in a decisive way to determine
the outcome of the elections was the nature of the Democratic
Party's campaign and the valuable contributions of many of
its organizations. Victory would not have been possible with-
out the national program and policies of the Democratic Party
which were mapped out and formulated by its leader, Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt, who is also the leader of the national
win-the-war coalition and the head of the government.

The aim and strategy of Roosevelt’s campaign as the Demo-
cratic presidential nominee was directed towards securing an
electoral victory for the camp of national unity and not just
for the Democratic Party. Therein lay the main strength and
power of the Democratic national campaign which, while not
entirely free of partisanship, was conducted on the basis of
speeding victory in the war, strengthening America's relation
with its Allies, securing a stable peace and a post-war economy
of expanding production and employment.

Most of the national spokesmen of the Democrats, such as
Pepper, Hannegan, Wallace and Truman, as well as a large

. number of the principal pro-Roosevelt Democratic candidates

running for the Senate and the House, developed their cam-
paign on this basis. Moreover, it should be noted that most
of the national leaders of the Democratic Party did not Capitu-
late to the provocative and divisive anti-Communist campaign
of Dewey-Bricker and Company. While they did not squarely
meet the issue, nevertheless they correctly stressed the fact
that the Republican tactics of Red-baiting were patterned on
the Hitlerite technique and strategy of divide and conquer.
However, the role of the various state Democratic Party
machines in organizing for victory was very uneven. Some of
these organizations were paralyzed by inner sabotage and
feuds. These exhibited great weaknesses and were less of a fac-
tor in determining the outcome of the elections than in previ-
ous campaigns. Such was the case in many of the county organi-

17

 

 

  

' On the other hand, a number of decisive county as well as
state organizations of the Democratic Party did display great
vitality and strength. This was so in Cook County, Illinois,
and in many districts in California, Washington and Penn-
sylvania. These and other Democratic organizations were a
positive, and in some cases, a key force in assuring the rela-
tively large registration and in mobilizing the pro-Roosevelt
vote.

Furthermore, in the course of the campaign, both in the
primaries and the elections, new forces and leaders arose from
among the Democratic Party ranks to challenge and help de-
feat the Farleys, O’Daniels and Elys. Important changes took

‘ place in a number of state and county Democratic organiza-

tions, as in Texas, Minnesota and California. New and more
favorable opportunities now exist for these Democratic organi-
zations to become stronger instruments of support for the Ad-
ministration’s anti-Axis policies and for enabling the camp of
national unity, in most states and communities, to operate
more effectively on the electoral front primarily through the
channels of the Democratic primary.

The Role of i-he People

It must be acknowledged, however, that the elections could
not have been won without the unparalleled initiative, the
mass activities and the ﬁghting enthusiasm which were de-
veloped during the course of the campaign by labor, by the
organizations of the Negro people and the main nationality
groups, and by scores of independent cultural, professional
and business groups and committees.

Never before in American political history have labor and
the people, including representatives from all walks of life,
from both major parties and from the ranks of the independ-
ent voters, intervened so forcefully and effectively in a na-
tional election. Never have they displayed such profound

18

 

zations, particularly in New York, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

 

political understanding, such creative energies and such politi-
cal drive.

Time does not permit an estimate of the constructive part
played by each of these groups and movements, such as the
important and unique role exercised by the Independent Vot-
ers Committee of the Arts and Sciences, composed of the fore-
most representatives of the cultural movement and scientiﬁc
thought of America, of men and women who came forward
in the role of great citizens and exercised a notable inﬂuence
upon the course of the elections. Nor is it possible here to
analyze the important contributions of such groups as the In-
dependent Republican Committee for Roosevelt, the Business-
men's Committee for Roosevelt, the Farmers for Roosevelt
Committee and a host of very inﬂuential non-partisan Citizen's
Committees. But it is appropriate to state in passing that it
is in the best interests of the nation that most of these com-
mittees and movements should be continued in the post—elec-
tion period. Whatever modiﬁcations or changes may be neces-
sary in their organizations to achieve greater unity and coop-
eration among them, these committees and movements have a

‘distinct and vital contribution to make to the cause of na-

tional unity, victory and progress.

Labor Advances National Unity

But at this point it is necessary and advisable to single out
for emphasis the special role of labor in these elections, par-
ticularly of the C.I.O.- and a number of A. F. of L. organiza-
tions. ~ _ ‘

This of course is not the ﬁrst national election in which the
labor movement has actively participated and exercised con-
siderable inﬂuence. However, this is the ﬁrst national election
in which labor emerged on the national political arena as a
major force, politically and organizationally. This is the ﬁrst
time in a national election that the decisive sections of labor
championed the interests of the entire nation and worked in

19

 

  

closer concert with wider sections of the non-working class
population. '

In these elections, the _most politically active sections of
labor, through the C.I.O. and its Political Action Commit-
tees, through the Labor Division of the Democratic Party, and

' through local A. F. of L. and United Labor Committees, came

forward not only as the champions of the rights and inter-
ests of labor. They came forward as never before as the best
organizers and most resolute defenders of the national war
effort, of the country’s welfare.

The decisive sections of labor steered a course of promoting
unity within the nation and amongst the United Nations as
the key to speeding victory and ensuring a lasting and prosper-
ous peace. Despite many weaknesses and shortcomings, and
despite the unevenness of its activity and contributions during
the election campaign, labor overcame many of its former
sectarian attitudes towards non-labor groups and towards
certain political machines. It learned to work within the two-
party system, and especially in collaboration with the Roose-
velt Democrats.

Labor helped defeat numerous strike and racial provoca-
tions initiated by pro-fascist employers, by John L. Lewis,
the Trotskyites and Socialists. The main body of labor did
not fall victim to the Red-baiting assaults of the Republicans.
Labor was a decisive force which rallied and inﬂuenced the
Negro people at certain moments of indecision and vacilla-
tion. And certainly, labor performed miracles of organization
in the campaign to register and get out the vote.

Labor"s strength and contributions in these elections were
multiplied by the growing political maturity and statesman-
like policy of the national leadership of the C.I.O. Labor's
role was strengthened because important sections of the A. F.
of L. actively entered into the elections, displayed considerable
initiative and understanding, and developed closer relations
with the C.I.O., as well as with the Roosevelt forces within the
Democratic Party. ’

20

 

 

La

 

 

Communis’rs_ Aid Viciory

‘If the main sectors of the labor and people's movement
played a new and more inﬂuential role in the elections, even
though not yet a leading role, no small credit is due to the
correct policies and the growing political inﬂuence and activi-
ties of the Communist Political Association.

In retrospect, and in all modesty, it can be stated that the
policies and the work of our Association were an indispensable
factor in helping win victory. The conclusions which Earl
Browder and our National Committee drew from Teheran
for the nation and for our own organization; our resolute ef-
forts to strengthen national unity and the collaboration of the
anti-Hitler coalition; our inﬂexible insistence on subordinat-

ling everything to winning the war; our timely and stubborn

21

 

.,,,.._._.._,,,,,_.,,,.“.._,,,,. . - ........_p .———-———1_-. .____. .. ,._.....

crusade to inﬂuence the labor movement to support Roosevelt

' for a fourth term; our uncompromising position against third

party moves and movements; our insistence on a non-partisan
approach and the development of this tactic to reach and in-
ﬂuence all patriotic forces irrespective of class or party, as
well as our decision to run no independent ticket but to
merge the main election activities of our members with those
of the mass organizations and broader national coalition move-
ments—all this, coupled with the practical organizational work
of the Communist trade unionists and that of our lower or-
ganizations, contributed greatly to the election victory. This
is true, notwithstanding many weaknesses and the unevenness
of the work of our Association and its leadership, including
a tendency in certain state organizations to underestimate
the possibilities for affecting a decisive change in Congress.

There can be no question but that the elections have amply
conﬁrmed the validity of the decisions of our National Con-
vention. What is especially urgent now is to develop further
our main policies and tactics in accord with the new political
developments following the elections, and the new world-scale

phase of the war which we have‘ now entered.

 

III. THE POST-ELECTION OUTLOOK

WHAT ARE the probable effects of the elections on the
course of political developments internationally and
within the nation?

Internationally, the outcome of the elections clears the way
for a new advance towards implementing the concord of Teh-
eran. The decision of the American electorate which was
hailed in Moscow, London and Paris, makes it possible to re-
inforce the solidarity and the alliance of the United Nations
and its leading anti-Hitlerite coalition.

The ﬁnal and most difficult phase of the war in Europe can
now be completed by the Allies more rapidly because the closer
and long-term collaboration of the United States, the Soviet
Union and Britain which the electorate affirmed, and which
the election promotes, will now help facilitate the solution of a
number of unsolved political and economic problems con-
fronting the United Nations, including some acute problems
arising out of Anglo—American economic rivalries. At the same
time, the elections, in continuing the Roosevelt government
and endorsing its war program and foreign policy, have shat-
tered the hopes for a negotiated or “soft” peace on which the
Nazis counted in the event of a Dewey victory. Therefore the
elections have helped to remove one possibility that might
have prolonged the war.

In the Far East, one of the consequences of the elections
will be to enable the Administration to move more ﬁrmly and
successfully in helping to effect a solution of the critical in-
ternal situation within China brought about by the Chiang
Kai-shek government which has obstructed and delayed the
most effective concerted prosecution of the war against Japan.

23

   

 

Naﬁonal Unify Sfrengfhened

Within the country the effect of the elections will accelerate
and strengthen the trend and movements to consolidate and
to broaden the camp of national unity around the Command-
er-in-Chief and the nation's war and post-war objectives. The
elections will stimulate and facilitate the establishment of a
stronger national victory and democratic coalition composed
of the most politically active and forward-thinking elements
from all classes and groups; The elections will encourage and
stimulate all democratic currents and progressive forces, espe-
cially those of the labor movement and of other people's or-
ganizations and movements, whose role now can be enhanced
and who can acquire a greater voice and inﬂuence in the af-
fairs of the nation.

At the same time, the outcome of the elections will impel
important capitalist groups, who assumed a position of neu-
trality in the campaign, to cooperate more closely with the
Administration and with the popular forces, particularly on
the vital issues of international security and the effective ex-
pansion of the foreign and domestic markets.

This trend and stimulus towards national unity which the

' elections favor, and which can be hastened by a correct post-

election orientation and policies of the labor and progressive
movement, has excellent chances of succeeding. For one thing,
the elections have weakened the enemies of national unity and
victory and have strengthened the position of the Roosevelt
Government and the whole democratic camp. This now makes
it possible to achieve a stronger and longer—term collaboration
of the various classes and groups comprising the national coali-
tlOIl. .

And here it should be remembered that the degree of na-
tional unity which has been forged in the United States in ‘the
course of this war, on the basis of the common national
interests of the patriotic” forces of all classes and groups, i.e.,
to crush Nazi—fascism and Japanese militarism, is not a transi-

24

 

 

tory or accidental phenomenon which will automatically dis-
appear with victory in the war. In fact, national unity can and
must be strengthened and continued in the post-war period.
For it is in the interest of all loyal Americans, of all classes, to
preserve and strengthen our national unity, to achieve the
utter destruction of fascism, to prevent the recurrence of ag-
gression, to achieve a prosperous post-war economy and to
protect and buttress our democratic institutions and way of life.

Andwhile the relation of forces within the camp of national
unity will change in the period ahead, and while many differ-
ences and contradictions will inevitably arise in the course of
future political developments and struggles, as in the past, the
conditions are now more favorable, after the elections, inter-
nationally and within the country, to resolve or compromise
these differences in the interests of the nation, of the people,
of progress.

The Plans of Reacﬁon

But it must not be forgotten that the November elections

T will also foster another trend, a counter-movement. The

camp of reaction and isolationism headed by the fascist-
minded monopolists, by the DuPonts, the Hearsts and Mc-
Cormicks, will not passively accept the verdict of the polls.
These forces were thwarted on November 7th in the most des-
perate bid for governmental power which they have yet made.
They have been checked and partially defeated. But they
have not yet been routed and smashed. In fact, during the
course of the election struggles they did succeed in organiz-
ing powerful reactionary and pro-fascist groupings and activi-
ties. They did succeed in deceiving and misleading millions
with their anti-Communist crusade. _

Clearly, these reactionary circles do not intend to wait until

the presidential elections of 1948, nor even until the Congres- ,
, sional elections of 1946, to renew their drive to try and alter

or reverse the direction of American policies at home and in
world affairs. Even though they will systematically and ener-

25

 

 

 

getically prepare for the coming municipal and Congressional
elections, these forces may be counted on to redouble their
efforts now to create disunity within the nation and among
the United Nations, to continue to obstruct the prosecution
of the war, the attainment of a complete victory and the estab-
lishment of a stable peace.

These pro-fascist, imperialist elements will try to exploit
the narrow margin of the presidential vote so as to distort and
circumvent the popular mandate of November 7th. They
will seize upon all diﬂiculties and differences accompanying
the concluding stage of the war in Europe and in the Paciﬁc.
They will seize upon all problems arising from the endeavors
of the United Nations to reach a common approach and agree-
ment on the questions of the peace settlement, economic recon-
struction and trade, on collective security to prevent future
aggressions and war, so as to weaken or break the unity of the
anti-Hitlerife coalition. '

They will aggravate and demagogically utilize the impend-
ing critical economic difficulties and dislocations of the recon-
version period. They will continue and augment in every
conceivable way their anti—Communist, anti-Semitic, anti-Negro
and anti-labor campaigns and incitements.

To achieve their anti-national unity and anti-United Na-
tions objectives, this pro—fascist and reactionary imperialist
clique will, among other things, use their huge economic and
ﬁnancial resources in such ways as to try to bring pressure
to bear upon the government, so as to retard or block a na-
tional program for reconversion and to-torpedo such measures
as the Bretton Woods agreements on international currency
stabilization, credits and capital investments, as well as that of
the Dumbarton Oaks decisions for the establishment of an
international security organization. They will use their weak-
ened but still relatively strong positions in Congress, as well as
in many government departments and agencies, to try to
undermine and sabotage the government's program from
within.

They will strive to strengthen their grip on the Republican
Party machines and will make new efforts in the South and
elsewhere to recapture control of various Democratic Party
organizations. At the same time, they will encourage and foster
formation of third party movements and organizations, utiliz-
ing for this aim the reactionary Social-Democrat, Trotskyite,
and Lovestoneite cliques and such instrumentalities as the
Liberal Party of New York and the Michigan Commonwealth
Federation.

They will try to maneuver with the Lewises and the Reuth-
ers and particularly with the VVoll-Hutcheson wing of the
A. F. of L. both to check and to prevent the growth of labor’s
unity of action nationally and internationally, to provoke new
divisions within the labor movement, and above all, to precip-
itate large-scale industrial strife and class conﬂicts.

this end they can be expected to build up a number of exist-
ing fascist groups ranging from Gerald Smith’s America First

. Party to the K.K.K., as well as to launch newfascist organiza-

tions,'perhaps with the leading participation of such elements
as ex-Senators Reynolds and Nye, and ex—Congressmen Dies
and Day. ‘

It would be a fatal mistake if the country, impressed with
the victories of November 7, were to minimize or under-
estimate the strength, the cunning and the desperate lengths
to which the camp of fascist-minded reaction will go in its
attempt to steer America away from the path of Teheran and
national unity. But it would be even more disastrous if the
democratic camp were to fail to see and utilize the new condi-

' tions, the new opportunities, which the elections and interna-

tional developments provide to nullify and defeat these re-
actionary and pro-fascist objectives.

These lessons of the election results must be fully grasped
to understand the immediate and central tasks which now con-
front our nation and the people.. ’ ‘

 

 

 

IV. KEY TASK—CONSOL|DATE NATIONAL UNITY

Unquestionably the single most important national need
and task of the post-election period is to unify and consoli-
date the loose coalition of national forces which supported
Roosevelt’s re-election and at the same time to weld an even
broader unity. This broader national coalition should include
millions of Republicans who voted for Dewey but who are
desirous of bringing the war to an early and victorious con-
clusion and of guaranteeing a lasting and prosperous peace.

The establishment of this unity of action and common en- 7

deavor for speeding victory over Hitlerite Germany and mili-
tarist Japanand for bringing about effective international se-
curity in the post-war period remains the central and most
urgent problem facing labor and the nation. Certainly this
is the prerequisite for preserving the unity of the United Na-
tions, for defeating pro-fascist reaction in the United States,
for realizing the President's Second Bill of Rights, for assuring
the welfare and progress of our nation.

. As the elections have demonstrated, the time is ripe to make
a series of new advances to solidify the camp of national unity
and to strengthen within it the political inﬂuence of the most
consistent anti-fascist forces.

The Commander-in-Chief, who was and is the leader of the
national victory coalition, has emerged from the elections in a
stronger position within the country, within his own party
and within Congress. In Congress the prospects are, and the

« conditions warrant, the welding of a broader pro-Roosevelt
coalition which will include, not only the progressives and

consistent Roosevelt supporters, but a larger number of con-
servative Congressmen both from the South and the North,
including a number of Republicans on the basis of the Admin-

29

  

_. --::;:17—::

 

istration’s foreign policy and a united national effort to assure
an expanding economy in the post-war period.

This can and must be achieved. To facilitate this, labor
and the progressives should learn to work in a new way, to
develop a new approach to Congress. Among other things,
they should help inﬂuence the progressives in ‘Congress to
avoid functioning in the new 79th Congress along the lines of
the old liberal bloc. They should encourage the staunch
Roosevelt supporters to cooperate with the many conservative
elements who support the government's foreign policy on the
most vital and central points of the nation's war and post-war
program. This will strengthen considerably the national coali-
tion within and outside of Congress.

Organize fhe Coaliﬁon

Secondly, and even more important, the conditions now‘

exist nationally and on a State scale, for bringing about an
organized coalition of the representatives of the main forces
and groups in the nation who supported Roosevelt's re—e1ec-
tion. It is now possible, as well as urgent, to help coalesce and
bring together in national and state-wide conferences, commit-
tees or councils, some of the outstanding national leaders from
the labor movement, from business circles, from the arts and
sciences, from the veterans, farm, and Negro movements, in-
cluding leading Democrats and independent Republicans. It is
necessary and possible to achieve an organized coalition of
various national and state leaders and groups who are inter-
ested in coordinating their efforts to win the war, to build a
durable peace and to realize an economy of abundance and
maximum employment.

But the realization of such projects and objectives would be
seriously impeded if these were viewed as establishing dual or
rival centers to the Democratic Party which has become the
national electoral vehicle of the democratic coalition. Similarly,
such unity moves would be hindered if the leaders of existing

30

 

 

 

national citizens committees would attempt to transform their
speciﬁc committees into the main organizational structure and
medium through which the broader forces should operate.

Undoubtedly, the form of the organized cooperation of
the main leaders and groups from the camp of national unity
should be loose and ﬂexible. This is advisable so as to per-
mit the broadest representation, the maximum coordination
of the combined efforts of the most diverse groups and indi-
viduals, who can be united around speciﬁc points of common
national interest, but who will insist on retaining freedom of
action to independently promote their own detailed programs
in accord. with their specialized interests. Whatever the form
this unity of action may take, one consideration is paramount,
and that is: the crystalization of a broader and more effective
national unity cannot materialize on the basis of blueprints or
by the adoption of a maximum political and economic pro-
gram. It must develop on the basis of common and parallel
action around a number of vital and key issues of national
interest which are essential to winning the war, securing the
peace and promoting economic prosperity.

The Vilal Issues

These issues would include, ﬁrst of all, such measures as.
resolute support for all governmental policies required to com-
plete military victory, including increased and uninterrupted
war production, systematic and energetic support for the
Dumbarton Oaks agreement, as well as the continuation of
Lend-Lease, and a considerable expansion of U.N.N.R.A. For
these and similar ‘measures will continue to provide the com-
mon denominator for the development of the broadest cooper-
ation of all classes and patriotic groups on a national unity
basis, including the involvement of certain business circles
which up to now have speculated on a change in Administra-
tion and which therefore have been reluctant to cooperate
closely with either the government or labor.

These issues might also include support for the main fea-
tures of the Administration economic stabilization program
and a series of practical measures to implement the President’s
goal of sixty million peace-time jobs, including legislation
embodying "the principles of the Baruch-Hancock report, the
Murray—Kilgore-Dingell Bill, continued price and rent control
and a large-scale housing program. And this should likewise
encompass the President’s proposals for establishing seven new
T.V.A.’s, particularly for the creation. of a Missouri Valley
Authority and the starting of the St. Lawrence seaway. For
these are all economically sound measures and can serve to
unite all classes, from workers and farmers to businessmen, in
a progressive and united national effort.

These issues could also embrace speciﬁc measures of vital
national importance, to extend the franchise and to eliminate
racial and religious discrimination in industry and in the
armed forces.

These issues should include too, many proposals requiring
action on a state scale, including state legislative measures to
basically improve existing state unemployment, health and
veterans’ legislation, the adoption of concrete bills and appro-
priations for developing an adequate state public works and
housing program, and other legislation to supplement the
national reconversion program.

Obviously, the consolidation of national unity will be inﬂu-
enced to no small extent by the course of action pursued by
the national Administration. Much will depend upon how
resolutely the Administration ﬁghts for its program‘ for victory,
peace and security within and outside of Congress. Much will
depend on the efforts made to extend and improve the practice
of establishing representative bi-partisan Congressional com-
mittees and citizens’ conferences, like those initiated by the
State Department on the questions of an International Security
Organization. And much will depend upon whether the Presi-
dent moves energetically to strengthen his Cabinet and a
number of government departments and agencies with per-

32

 

 


i.

,-—r

 

sonnel which will pursue a firmer anti-Hitlerite and national
unity policy.

But more, even much more, will depend upon how effec-
tively labor and the people continue to rally to the support
of the main policies of the Government, and how ﬁrmly they
aid and help inﬂuence the Administration and Congress to
resolutely implement the policies of the Commander-in-Chief,
including those points of his program raised in his. campaign
speeches in New York and Chicago.

Unifed Labor Acﬁon

In this connection, the role, initiative, unity and activity
of labor, including the Communist Political Association, can
be of decisive importance, just as they have been and are in
relation to all problems of strengthening the unity of the
nation and the United Nations.

However, to play a moreinfluential role and to make its
maximum contributions, the main sections of labor will have
to come forward even more boldly and consistently than in the
past, on all national and public issues, as the strongest bulwark
of the government's anti-Axis policies, as the strongest defender
of national security and the nation’s welfare.

Everything should be done to strengthen and expand the
unity of action and cooperative relations of the C.I.O., of the
A. F. of L., and the Brotherhoods which have developed in
the localities and states on an extensive scale during the
course of the election campaign.

Today, as in the recent past, the greatest headway towards
establishing joint and parallel labor action will materialize
in support of coordinated eiforts to assure victory in the war
and to secure the peace. And this will take place particularly

around a number of key legislative issues of national and state ,

import in respect to the burning problems of foreign policy,
war production, reconversion, social security, maximum pro-
duction and employment and expanding foreign trade and
capital exports.

It is equally important that labor develop its political activi-
ties in such a way as to avoid and overcome all tendencies to-
wards narrow and partisan trade union interests and policies;
and that it work in closer unison with the Roosevelt Demo-
crats, the Willkie Republicans and with all mass organiza-
tions of the veterans, farmers, Negro people, and nationality
groups, as well as with all forward-looking groups of manage-
ment and business.

To seriously and decisively shape the course of national
unity in the post—election and post-war period, it is vital that
labor should greatly strengthen its organizations and should
approach the problem of protecting and advancing the inter-
ests of the working people within the framework and on the
basis of maintaining the national coalition for victory, peace
and security, within the framework of facilitating and assuring
military victory, a stable peace, national progress, expanding
production and employment and an orderly solution of class
differences and demands. Any other orientation could only
lead to class conﬂicts and division, to the break-up of national
unity, which would weaken the camp of democracy and
strengthen the forces of fascism. To, realize this perspective
and the anti-fascist unity of the nation, the labor movement,
including the Communists, will among other things, have to
develop further and far more effectively its program, its poli-
cies, its mediums for mass political action: electoral, legislative
and public relations. '

In this connection there are several speciﬁc questions which
merit consideration: .

The ﬁrst pertains to the future of such political instrumen-
talities as P.A.C. Unquestionably, the Political Action Com-
mittees expressing, in part, the growing political activities and
strength of the C.I.O. are here to stay. They are an indispens-
able part and arm of the labor movement and of the political
life of the nation. Certainly now the political inﬂuence and
political action of the C.I.O., just as of the A. F. of L., should
and will be continued, multiplied and enhanced.

34

 

 

 

But from this it does not and should not follow that P.A.C.,
as a speciﬁc organizational form and apparatus should or must
be perpetuated along rigid lines or inﬂexible forms. What is
desirable is that P.A.C. should be developed further as an or-
ganic and integral part of the C.I.0.,’of its affiliated unions,
its locals and councils. It should implement C.I.O. policies
and decisions on the electoral and legislative fronts, working
within and through the basic organizations of the C.I.O., and
enabling the C.I.O. directly to work in concert with broader
movements and combinations of national forces.

L Likewise, the existing local and state A. F. of L. and united
labor legislative and political action committees should be
strengthened wherever possible. In this connection it would
beiadvisable to explore all possible avenues and mediums, in-
cluding various non-labor organizations and committees, to
draw a larger number of A. F. of L. organizations, nationally
and locally, into common legislative and electoral action with
other patriotic groups and organizations, including the C.I.O.

Non-Partisan Commifees

Closely related to this, the labor and the progressive move-
ment, including the C.P.A., has a major responsibility to
develop the broadest unity mass movements in the communi-
ties. For it is clear, as the elections have demonstrated, that
the course of political realignments in the country and the
outcome of many political struggles will depend to a consider-
able extent upon the widest mobilization of the working
people jointly with other strata of the population on a
precinct, election district, and community basis. This is
why the utmost consideration should be given to the forma-
tion of broad citizens’ non-partisan committees, of representa-

tive people's lobbies, legislative conferences and movements‘

organized on a permanent basis in each community, city or
state, around one or several central issues of foreign policy,
_war production, reconversion, or social security.

These non-partisan committees and councils should be com-
posed of representatives of labor, of the churches, civic, pro-
fessional and business groups, of Democratic and Republican
leaders and precinct committeemen, of the Negro and fraternal
organizations, and wherever possible, also of representatives
of the Communist Political Association. These committees
and movements should be approached, not as substitutes for
the independent and specialized community and public rela-
tions activities of the Democratic clubs, of the trade unions or
of various civic groups, but as coordinating committees, as

, local centers of national unity, of united community action.

Many of the various non-partisan citizens’ committees which
were organized during the elections should continue or be re-
organized on a broader basis, with the aim of supporting the
main policies of the President's victory and security program,

36

 

or of some of its speciﬁc points. These and additional com-
mittees, built in a hundred or more key congressional districts,
could become powerful instruments for uniting and rallying
the widest sections of the people for victory, for influencing
Congress and the state legislatures, for preparing and helping

. guarantee the outcome of the coming spring elections, which

are of exceptional political importance, for the crucial 1946
Congressional elections, and for shaping political realignments
on a solid, progressive and extremely eﬁective functional basis.

Dangers of Third Party

A few special comments should be made regarding the ques-
tion of a third party. Certain genuine progressives within and
outside the labor movement are once again raising the ques-
tion of state labor or farmer-labor parties and the establish-
ment of a national third party. These people are inﬂuenced
in their thinking by the strengthened political role and activi-
ties of labor and of various independent citizens’ committees.
They are swayed by the relatively large vote secured by the
A.L.P. and the Liberal Party in New York, as well as by the
favorable outcome of a number of congressional and state leg-
islative contests in which labor and progressive candidates
were elected. They are also animated by a state of chronic
contempt and hostility to the established major party ma-
chines and politicians.

In addition to these honest but misguided trade unionists
and liberals, the Social-Democrats of all stripes and the Trot-

.skyites and Lovestoneites are now plumping for a third party
venture. It seems from information at hand that they intend ‘

to organize in the very near future a national conference, with
the Liberal Party as its nucleus, for the purpose of launching
some sort of a National Commonwealth Federation, and at the
same time try to initiate a number of third party enterprises in
a series of cities and states. .

and mass work in unity with all other patriotic groups and to
operate on the electoral front in the next period through the
established two-party system will be decisive in counteracting,
preventing, or at least limiting or narrowing any third party
movement. A national gathering and crystalization of some
of the main sectors and leaders of the national anti-Hitlerite
forces, would also serve to offset, check or restrict the damage
which the third-partyites could and might do to national unity
if they were to receive any serious support or benevolent tol-
eration within the labor and people's movement.

But in addition to this, it is incumbent upon the most ad-
vanced progressives, and especially upon the members of the
Communist Association, to make clear that any third party
move under present conditions would divide and weaken the
unity of labor and the nation. It would therefore limit and
retard labor’s political inﬂuence and activity both in the com-
ing elections and in the general political life of the nation.

The honest militants in the trade union movement should
be helped to distinguish between form and content, and in
this case between the strengthened and independent role and
action of labor and the new and speciﬁc organizational forms
in which the American labor movement is developing its
political activities. They should be shown that despite the
“unorthodox” forms, labor’s political activities are now
developing on a scale and in national inﬂuence such as the
early and most consistent advocates of labor’s independent
political action could not have visualized a decade or even a
few years ago. '

The entire labor and progressive movement have already
seen what political miracles can be achieved in the interests of
the nation and people if labor and the progressive forces steer
a firm course of national unity and non-partisanship on the
electoral front. If labor and the progressives utilize the new
and more favorable opportunities which now exist to work
through the two-party system and primaries, far greater
miracles can and will take place!

Deve-Iopmenfs in GOP

Undoubtedly the outcome of ‘the elections will sharpen all
differences and struggles within the Republican Party. These
will include increasing conﬂicts and struggles for party con-
trol as well as cleavages within and outside of Congress on all
questions of major policy. Thus we may witness, not only
a struggle between the so-called internationalists and isola-
tionists, between the progressives and the reactionaries, but
also a sharpening struggle between powerful conservative ele-
ments in the G.O.P. and the Hoover-McCormick leadership.

While the prospects for changes and re-alignments within
and around the Republican Party are not comparable with
those which may be expected in and around the Democratic
Party, labor and the progressives generally cannot ignore these
developments. Nor, can they accept the fatalistic viewpoint
that the Republican Party is destined to continue forever as
the party of reaction. The democratic coalition should try to
encourage and inﬂuence all patriotic and forward-looking ele-
ments and groups within the Republican camp, particularly
the followers of Willkie, to take up the struggle against the
Hearsts, the Pews and the McCormicks now in control of the
Republican Party.

To facilitate this, it will become necessary to develop a more
effective non-partisan approach and tactic to reach and influ-
ence the millions of citizens who, for one reason or another,
continue to vote Republican and maintain party loyalty.

It will be necessary to work out a differentiated approach to
the Republican Party delegations in Congress and in the
state legislatures, to separate the sheep from the goats, and to
bring about a more effective bi-partisan coalition on speciﬁc
points of the national program for victory, peace and security.

It would also be advisable if the most active and courageous
independent Republicans were to remain within the Repub-
lican Party, to retain their party status. Thus they would be
in a stronger position to inﬂuence the thinking and action of

39

 

   

ﬂuence constructive regroupings within the Republican Party.
But to encourage this orientation, such people would have to
be given the opportunity to function freely and elfectively in

broader circles and through various non-partisan coalitions

and committees.

Finally, and in preparation for the vitally important 1946
Congressional elections which must be planned and prepared
for now: labor and the entire camp of national unity should
select several score of traditionally solid Republican Con-
gressional districts for special concentration with the orienta-
tion of working through the Republican Party primary.

V. ANTI-COMMUNISM ENDANGERS NATION

DNE OF THE chief problems confronting the nation in

the post-election period is to decisively root out of Amer-
ican politics the virus of anti-Communism. This is essential
in order to consolidate national unity and to reinforce the
alliance of the United Nations. This is necessary in order to
protect and strengthen American democracy from the attacks
of the fascist enemy abroad and at home. -

It is true that in the recent elections the Republican cam-
paign of anti-Communism waged by Dewey and Bricker and
led by the McCormick, Hearst and Patterson press did not
succeed in its main electoral objectives. It is a fact that scores
of outstanding Red-baiters were defeated in the elections. It
is also true that during the elections the Communists estab-
lished ﬁrmer relations of cooperation with various leaders
and groups in the national victory coalition.

Nevertheless, as Earl Browder has sharply warned, the pur-
veyors and instigators of the anti—Communist crusade have not
been decisively beaten. These pro-fascist reactionaries are still
powerful, active, and on the loose. And their Fifth Column
of seditionists, traitors and provocateurs still enjoys freedom
of action. -

Red-baiting is a poisonous Hitlerite weapon which still pol-
lutes America's political life and misleads millions of Ameri-
can citizens, especially in the rural and small town areas. Dis-
criminatory legislation ostensibly directed against the Com-
munists, but actually aimed at undermining the democratic
institutions and practices of the country, still exists on our
statute books. And anti-Communist clauses and practices con-
tinue to operate in certain trade unions, even in some under
progressive leadership.

41

 

 

Thousands of political, trade union and civic leaders—anti-
fascists—are aware of and recognize the patriotic role and the
contributions of the Communists to the national war effort.
They understand that Communism is the antithesis of fas-
cism,_. is the mortal» enemy of fascism. Yet many of these same
leaders, under pressure from the Red-baiters, from our na-
tion’s enemies, frequently ﬁnd it expedient to condemn the
Communists, and even go so far as to try to lump communism
together with its diametrical opposite and its implacable
enemy—fascism.

This state of affairs must be ended. This is required by the
supreme national interests of our country. For the victorious
conclusion of the war and the establishment of a lasting peace
demand that the anti-Hitler and anti-fascist unity of our na-
tion must be strengthened now and developed further into the
post-war period.

All obstacles and prejudices standing in the way of national

unity therefore must be speedily overcome and thrust aside.’

This demands in the ﬁrst place a new and united effort of all
anti-fascists to lay low the bogey of Communism and to reso-

' lutely combat and isolate the Red-baiters who are also the

most rabid exponents of Soviet and British baiting, of labor
and Negro baiting, of anti-Semitism, andof everything else
which is divisive, reactionary and treasonable.

Toward this end, it is timely and necessary to fully acquaint
the country with the pro-fascist nature of the anti-Communist
election strategy of the G.O.P. high command. It is necessary
to show how dangerously close this Hitler-like strategy came
to bringing about a reactionary Republican victory on No-
vember 7, and consequently, a national disaster. And it
must be explained again and again what consequences would
follow from the triumph of an anti-Communist policy in
the United States—consequences which would result in the
establishment of a government headed by fascist-minded
monopolists, in the subversion and destruction of American
democratic institutions, in a reversal of America's foreign pol-

icy and tl1e negation of the Teheran agreements which alone
hold the promise of victory, a durable peace and orderly prog-
ress.

Towards this end it is also urgent and necessary that we

Communists take the initiative to help clear up certain cur-
rent rnisconceptions regarding our role and position. ()1)-
Viously, our fundamental contributions to the cause of na-
tional unity will continue to be primarily in the develop-
ment of our policies and activities based on the interests and
needs of our nation and people, which are dedicated to win-
ning the war, destroying fascism, ensuring a stable peace,
guaranteeing democratic progress and a prosperous and ex-
panding post-war economy in the USA.

\

The Ciﬁzenship of fhe Communists

Basing ourselves on this program and outlook for the period
ahead, we must help make clear to all the American people
that the problem of ensuring the full citizenship and parti-
cipation of the American Communists in our national unity
and democratic processes, is in the ﬁrst place a question of"
the vigor and vitality of American democracy. It is thus
a domestic, an American problem, ﬁrst, last and always, which
affects all aspects of our country’s welfare.

What is decisive in any case is the nature of our national
policy as it is developed towards all groups and sectors of
Americans, including those who have a Marxist point of view.
If Communists are castigated or excluded from the official
camp of national unity, then national unity, by such exclu-
siveness, will become unstable and precarious—will annul itself.

National unity to be real and effective must be all-inclus-
ive and embrace all patriots, all anti-fascists, from conserva-
tives to Communists. This is one of the great lessons of this
national liberation war which has been driven home to the
peoples of all the United Nations, especially to those in the
Nazi-occupied countries. There is no responsible leader or group
in the United States, who, if they compare deeds with words,
can fail to recognize that American Communists are ﬁrst
among the ﬁrst in their devotion to our people and nation,
and uncompromising in their hatred of and struggle against.
fascism and all reaction.

Insofar as those honest but misguided persons "who con-
tend that America must “tolerate” Americans of Communist
opinion because of the importance and need of maintaining
ﬁrm and durable friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the
following must be said: The United States must and should
develop its foreign policy in accord with our most vital na-
tional interest, and not for any other reason. And it is in
accord with the deepest national interests of our country,
and in concord with our common interests with the U.S.S.R.,

44

 

 

.....-—......./.,.......—.—-————..-—»-.- r- v .. .....4
- .

Britain, China, etc., that our nation steers a course of strength-
ening the anti-Hitlerite coalition, consolidating the military
alliance of the United Nations, and helping to organize col-
lective action of the democratic world powers to preserve and
guarantee the future peace and security of world civilization.

Whether America follows an enlightened or a reactionary
internal policy towards Americans who are adherents of the
social science of Marxism is an American responsibility, which
must be met with full concern for our nation’s democratic
tasks. It is not the responsibility of any other nation.
America's national attitude towards Americans who value
the scientiﬁc approach of Marxism as a science, can and should
be of concern to other nations and peoples only to the extent
that our country adopts a reactionary or a democratic policy.
For if a reactionary domestic policy is adopted, then as ex-
perience has proven, this is bound to adversely affect our
country’s foreign "policy. Whereas, if there is a progressive
internal policy, this is bound to inﬂuence in a positive way
our country's relations with its allies.

America must “tolerate” and accept the American Commu-
nists as full-fledged citizens because this is essential to hasten
victory in the war, to complete the destruction of fascism, and
to protect and develop democracy. This is necessary to fortify
national unity by enlisting the contributions of all anti-fascists,
from Republicans and Democrats to Communists. This is
imperative in order to assure that American democracy func-
tion now and in the future with the indispensable political
plasma of the labor movement, which, perforce, includes the
most advanced section of the working class, the Communists.

The national victory won in the elections has created new
and more favorable opportunities for the democratic coali-

TEHERAN

Our Pafh in War and Peace
By Earl Browder

Americans of all classes and political affiliations will find in Earl

Browder's brilliantly illuminating book on the new problems, tasks‘

and perspectives confronting our nation and the world as a result of
the historic Teheran Agreement, a penetrating guide to the future.
As the newly-elected president of Communist Political Association
writes:

"The Teheran‘ concord furnishes the platform upon which can and
must be gathered all forward-looking men and women of all classes
and political ideologies, subordinating all other considerations to the
single purpose of welding a ﬁrm and effective majority of the people
and directing the nation and the world along the Teheran path."

His new work is a continuation and companion-volume to Victory
—-and After. But while in his former book the author devoted only
one short chapter to the problems "After" victory has been won, his
latest book is practically entirely occupied with the vast, world-envel-
oping tasks of post-war reconstruction which press ever more urgently
for attention, and which were tremendously inﬂuenced by the out-
come of the 1944 presidential elections.

Among the chapters are "The Guarantee of Teheran"; "Recon-
struction of Europe"; "Characteristics of Capitalism"; "Elements of
an Economic Program"; "The Changes in Communist Organization"
and "What Marxism Contributes to America."

THE ELECTIONS AND THE OUTLOOK FOR

NATIONAL UNITY

By EUGENE DENNIS

THE NATION'S VICTORY

OVEMBER 7, 1944, was one of the great moments in the

political life of America and world history. It registered
one of the decisive military and political victories of this great
people's war of national liberation. It was a triumph for all
the American people, for patriots of all classes and walks of
life. It was not a victory for any one class or group in the
country. It was a victory for the nation.

For the outcome of the presidential elections in the United
States is a notable victory for the camp of national unity and
the alliance of the United Nations. It marks a powerful po-
litical blow against Berlin and Tokyo. It signalizes a serious
political defeat within the country for the Hearst-McCormick-
Patterson axis and for all other advocates of disunity, reaction
and a “soft” or compromise peace.

The election of Roosevelt and of a Congress which will more
actively support the nation's policies, reaffirms the desires and
intent of the American people to prosecute the war against
Hitlerite Germany and militarist Japan to ﬁnal victory, to im-
plement the war and post-war policies of the Roosevelt Gov-
ernment. It constitutes a popular referendum and endorsement
of the concords of Moscow and Teheran. Likewise it gives a
go-aheadsignal for the realization of the President's Second
Bill of_Righ‘ts and the goal of sixty million peace-time jobs.
