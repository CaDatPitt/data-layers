Ilhy, and Sacriﬁces for the Best of Us

Then, when the Reagan Administration's tax-cut package went to Congress, Amer-
icans were told it was an "across-the-board" cut for all. But with final enactment of
the Reagan tax bill, it 's clear who is getting thehefty cuts and a lot more--the rich

and the large companies.

By 1984., these will be the tax giveaways to the rich. . .

total rate cuts go to those now earning more than
$50,000 -- yet they are only six percent of all
taxpayers. Cost to Treasury of cuts for the

achieved, for working people and the needy. That's what we're protesting

this country back on the track.

Only citizens who know the objectives of the administration, what it is

doing in Congress and the federal agencies to achieve them. and what its

blueprint really means for the country and its people . . . only such informed

citizens can fight back successfully.

lntorlnution is preparation tor this struggle.
