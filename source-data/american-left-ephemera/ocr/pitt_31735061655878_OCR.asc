Negro freedom.

The path of development of the
Negro people toward individual and
“national” equality does not‘ take the
route of struggle for national independ-

ence and political-geographical sover-
eignty and statehood. The Negro people

in the United States historically, now,
and most probably for the future, seek
solution to. its national question in
struggle for securing equality of polit-

V ical, economic, and social status as a

component part of that amalgam of
nationalities which historically evolved
into the American nation. This course
of development is in conformation with
the first law of Marxism that “man-
kind sets for itself only those tasks it
ca.n achieve.” It corresponds to the
sociological and economic forces operat-
ing objectively upon the course of
development of the Negro people. These
latter objective forces are centrifugal.
They operate against the progressive
build-up of closed areas of settlement
on the countryside or in the towns of
the Black Belt. They correspond to the
overbearing tendencies of industrial so-
ciety to invade diffuse and amalgamated
peoplesand dislocate sectional and re-
gional population. Furthermore, this
course of development and outlook cor-
responds to the central political reality

-of our historic period that the solution

of all democratic tasks is worked out in
conformation with, and on the basis of,
the primacy of the working class strug-
gle to transform modern society onto a
socialist base—the key task in the gross
solution of the overall problem of hu-
man oppression and exploitation. It
places the struggle for the solution of
the Negro question in direct and strate-
gic relationship to the movement and
main socia1'force——the working class——
for progress in our age.

The relevance of the general principle
of selﬁdetermination to the reality of
the Negro people’s status and outlook
in the U. '_S. can be expressed as fol-
lows: . . 1

The right of a people—-irrespective of
their level of, or direction of develop-
ment as a national entity»-—to act in con-
cert, or in alliance with fraternal
classes and peoples, under the direction
of their ‘own leadership, after the
fashion they mayvchoose, in pursuance
of their own goal of freedom as they so
conceive and construe it to be at any
given moment, is an inalienable demo-
cratic right of that people which can
neither be ceded or withdrawn by any
other power. Inpthis sense, the right to
self-determination is to the national
community; what the right to freedom"
of conscience and freedom of political
choice is to the individual.

ll. Some Questions

1. If the Negro people are not a
nation, then how does onc.chai'acter'i2c
their status in the United States? The
Negro people in the United States suf-
fer a special form of national oppres-
sion. It is national in the sense that all
class strata of the Negro people are
subject to a common yoke of oppression
and exploitation and social ostracism,
are victims of social, economic, and
political inequality. They are racially
identiﬁed and set apart by racist laws
and customs, social existence and by
actual ethnic identiﬁcations.

2. If the cliaracteristics of a nation
which can be discerned or ascribed to
the Negro community of the Deep South
(Black Belt) care not the deter-mining
factors or indicators of the course of
olevelopment of the Negro people, then
what is their significance for the Negro
people’s freecloin movement?

That there are sizeable areas of the

country where the concentration of Ne-
groes in the population is large or a
majority is of great importance for the
political struggle and economic and
cultural development of the Negro peo-
ple. These areas are bases where the
Negro freedom movement can organize
and assert the mass power of their num-
bers in struggle to secure political

economic

authority in proportion to their numeri- *

cal strength in the population. Their
favorable ratio in the population allows

for mutual aid and self-help, develop- 5

ments in the realm of advancing their
well-being. Such areas of
large Negro population allow for the
continued development of what is dis-
tinctive in American Negro culture.

In general the large areas of the
Negroes’ concentrated numbers become
the centers where mass actions of the
‘Negro people are generated, the vor-
tices of the Negro people’s movement
which draw into the freedom struggle
Negroes everywhere. They represent
the big wheels of the Negro peoples’
struggle which move the whole.

3. What are the objective factors
which operate and have operated
against the development of the Negro
people in the South as a nation?

The accepted Leninist deﬁnition of a
nation which Stalin so precisely formu-
lated is: “A nation is an historically
evolved, stable community of language,
territory, economic life and psychologi-

cal make-up manifested in a community

of culture.” A key word inithis deﬁni-
tion is “stable.” Capitalist development
in the United States generates forces
which assail the stability of communi-
ties. Two factors gave a certain dura-

’ diy1li$‘S‘llfor. arm to‘-the 7 Black Belt’ area
.10: Negro majority in the Deep South.

N-Ornie-—the fact that the overwhelming
 bulk of the Negro people -were attached
 to the land as sharecroppers, tenants,

and impoverished farmers. Two --l the
racist barriers erected against Negro

‘ integration in the economic, political,

and social life in the country.

As late as 1930, 70 percent of the

‘ Negro people were counted in this

“peasant” category. ‘The factor of a
large land-bound ratio in the Negro
community’s total population gave that
community a certain stability. But the
demands of industrialization and the
development of mechanization and tech-
nology in agriculture combined to com-
mand and expel the population from the
countryside into the cities. This process
considerably shrunk the areas of Negro
majority in the South and furthered the
distribution of the Negro population at
the expense of a “stable community on
a common territory,” until today there
remains in the old area of Negro ma-
jority some ﬁve million Negroes of

_ whom less than 40 percent are econom-
ically attached to the land. Two-thirds
of the Negro people, however, make
their homes in the- South. The Negro
people, therefore, are in the main an
oppressed urban working people. There-
fore, the decisive role in the solution
of the Negro question falls to the work-
ing-class strata. The poor farm masses
and their economic demands and strug-
gles relative to the land question re-
main 3. most important component in
the total cause of Negro freedom, but
clearly do not occupy the strategic posi-
tion as, of old, when the bulk of the
Negro people were farmers.

Not only the operation of the elemental
forces of economic changes have ex-
‘ pelled and driven the Negro people from
their paternal grounds, but the improve-
ments in the area ofcconomic and cul-
tural’ opportunity (wrested in long and
-ﬁerce struggle on the part of the Negro
people and their allies) opened at-
tractive small doors of opportunity to
' Negroes, particularlyin the non-South-
ern metropolises and the larger South-
ern cities.

In characterizing the Negro people in

‘ the Black Belt as a nation, we failed to
properly plumb the import of that sub-
jective attribute of nations which is one
of the determining features, namely, “a
common psychological make-up.” If we
, had, we would have more seriously in-
quired into the history of the Negro
people’s movement and freedom en-

 
 

  

.4», V

deavor in our_ country and drawn the

requisite conclusions.‘ The main cur-

rents of Negro thought and leadership
in the struggle for advancement and
freedom historically and universally at
the present time have projected their
programs for Negro freedom from the
premise that Negroes individually and
as a people are no less Americans than
any other claimants. They have ever
sought to identify the aspirations of
Negroes for freedom and equality of
citizenship status with the broadest na-
tional interests of the country. They
have not by choice sought a separate
path of development in opposition to
the main forward trends in American
national life. The Negro people related
their cause of Abolitionism to the inter-
ests of national survival and democratic
fulﬁllment prior to the Civil War. In
the Civil War years the Negro people
made their alliance with Federal author-
ity against counter-revolutionary seces-
sionism. Today, they invoke their con-
stitutional rights as citizens of the
United States in demands upon, and in
alliance with, Federal authority against
the tyranny of “states’ rights" South-
ern governments. The, red thread of
strategic conception that runs through
the whole history of the Negro freedom
movement is that of amassing the max-
imum self-organization, unity and
strength of the Negro people and ally-

 

ing its forces with the major progres-
sive cause and developments in comple-
mentary struggle for full equal rights
for the Negro people and progress for
the nation. Only in describing the di-
mensions of their oppression have the
Negro people represented themselves as
a people apart from the American na-
tion. Their whole struggle has been to
secure their historically due and just
recognition as Americans with all the
accompanying prerequisites of such na-
tional identiﬁcation.

It is true, of course, that objective
being is not conditioned upon subjective
recognition of one's status. A particular
working class is the grave-digger of its

    

  
  

 

capitalist ‘class historically V whether the p e
workers are;-aware of , this at a given T‘

time or not. So if objective factors and
the «line of historical development were
operating to enhance and foster the .
maturation of the national attributes
of the Negro people and compound
their features in, nationhood, the Negro
people would have a separate national
destiny whether or not they manifesetd ‘
this consciousness. But the objective
factors operating in relation “ to the
Negro people in the United States are
working not in the direction of national
insularity or separate development of
its nationhood but in the direction of
the integration of the Negro people of
all classes into the mainstream of
American contemporary and historical
development. '

4. By not placing the Negro question
as a. question of an oppressed nation
ﬁgh.ting for natiomzl-state sovereignty,
are we thereby diminishing the revolu-
tw'n.a,ry ‘import of the Negro peoplefs
struggle in the United States?

No. A special feature of the American
road to socialism is revealed in the fact
that the requisite preparation * of the
forces for effecting fundamental social‘
change in the system necessitates the.
completion of the bourgeois-democratic
norms of political, economic and social
development for the South in general
and the Negro people in particular.
Furthermore, a condition for "accom-
plishing the prerequisite unity of the
American working class with its class V
allies for advanced social struggle is to
level the main rails of the color bar. .
The struggle of the Negro people for
the democratic goals of political, eco-
nomic and social equality feeds into the
general stream of the historic working-
class cause of our time a powerful cur-
rent which raises the torrential power
of the whole cause of social advance.
The elementary democratic demands of .
the Negro people can be met only at the
expense of the monopolists and Dixie-
crats, by strengthening the popular
forces and depriving the monopoly rul-
ing circle of the means of - political
oppression and economic super-proﬁts.’
The fact that the Negro people's strug-
gle for freedom and equality unfolds
aroitlzin the United States in direct and
intimate association with the working
class and popular struggles, the fact
that it is directed against the common
class oppressor (the white monopolists
and ruling circles) and .not through a
compradore class of “native” agents,
the fact that the scene of the Negro
people’s struggle unfolds within the

11

. tional question. . .

.violation of that equality,

 

bosom of A American imperialism--on the
main stage and not a faraway land ‘or

. insular’ holding of American" imperial-
N ism—meanB that the full force of the

least activity of this movement has its
direct impact and consequences in chal-
lenge to the enemy and support to the
broad forces of social progress.

— Furthermore, the purging of white
chauvinist. and anti-Negro prejudices
from the thought and attitudes of the
white masses is a vital aspect of the
subjective preparation of the working
class for undertaking the leadership re-

‘ sponsibility in the struggle for a higher

form of social order—for socialism. It
is the way the American working class
is being educated in internationalism in
the ﬁrst instance. Lenin has written:

“Internationalism on the part of
oppressing, or ‘great’ nationsas they
are called (though they are great only

1 in violence . . .) must consist not
only in observing formal equality of
nations, but in an inequality that
would make up, as far as the oppress-
ing nation—-the great nation—is con-
cerned, for the inequality which ob-
-tains in actual life. Whoever does not
understand this has not grasped -the
real proletarian attitude to the na-

3’ (“Question of Na-

tionalities.”) ‘

_. The true proletarian attitude to the
national question, Lenin stressed over
and over again, consists of deeds per-
formed to wipe out the inequalities and
injustices suffered by the victims of na-
tional or racial oppression; in the strug-
gle for full equality for the Negro peo-
ple. As Lenin noted further:

“. . . nothing so much holds up the
dcveloprrzent and strengthening of
proletarian class solidarity as na-
tional injustice; ‘offended’ nationals
are not sensitive to anything so much
as to the feeling of equality and the

through a negligence or as a joke, by

their proletarian comrades. That is why

in this case it is better to overdo it in
the way of -ﬂexibility and leniency to-
wards the national minorities than
Vunderdo it. . . .”

A A revitalized, strengthened and more

democratic procedure of Constitutional

-government is the requisite form for the
Negro people to secure their full free-
dom aims. Therefore, the Negro people's
movement has a continuing partisan
stake’ and vital interest in all of the
general problems of the state structure,

‘laws, etc., for this is the frame within
-which it makes its struggle for free-

.12

if only I

dom. It is vitally affected by the nature
of these general questions of State.

5. When ‘we conclude that ‘self-de-
termination forthe Negro nation in the
Black Belt is not a sound or applicable
characterization of the-course of devel-
opment in the cause of Negro freedom
and the solution of the Negro question
in the United States, are we not saying
that the Negro people have voiced their
right of self-determination and chosen
integration?

No. The Negro people have not had
and do not now have the democratic
means of deciding for or against a
course of developmentas a nation. De-
velopments beyond the will of the Negro
people to determine—-objective economic
and historical fa'ctors——have primarily
conditioned the course and outlook of
the development of and solution‘ of the
Negro nati_onal question in the United
States. It is the reﬂection of these ob-
jective and material considerations and
circumstances which ﬁnd their expres-
sion in the articulated programs, out-

‘look and conclusions as to the course

that the movement for solution of the
Negro question will take. The essential
content and basic objective of the Ne-
grog people’s struggle is to secure full
and equal means of decision on, all ques-
-tions affecting them and the country’s
welfare, to secure the right to vote and
be elected to oﬁice and to secure unfet-
tered equality in all respects. These are
the tools for decision for which the
Negro people struggle now in order to
be enabled to decide matters in their

 

self-interest and in the national interest
as is consistent with democratic re-
quirements.

Ill. The Negro People's Development
‘and the Land Quesﬁoru
In the theoretical considerations of

the solution of the Negro question in
the’United States, our Party has in the

 

‘past put ﬁrst stress on the gland 
tion. As a matter of fact, the ﬁrst ‘ N

strategic, consideration for the _solution
of the Negro question was projected in
terms of securing to the landless Negro
farmers land holding at the expense of

the plantation-owning landlord class

and the land monopolists and banks.

The thesis behind this approach was
to the effect that by breaking up. the

plantation and turning the land over to
the Negro farm toiler, it would ‘be not
only securing the means of economic
sustenance and development to the Ne-
gro people but would also cut into the
economic might of monopoly, of U. S.
imperialism.

This approach had meaning in a situ-
ation where the bulk of the Negro people
were economically exploited‘ by and held
in the grip of landlord capital, b when

the largest numbers of Negroes ‘were ~

attached to the land. It cannot be viewed
as the’ strategic approach to the solu-
tion of the Negro question today, when
the emigration from agriculture has
proceeded to such a point that less than
1.2 millionNegroes are found to have
any occupational relationship to the
land as is shown in table 8.

The vast changes that have taken
place in the class structure of the Ne-
gro peo-pleas a consequence of this
occupational redistribution with the re-
sulting gcneral urbanization of the
Negro people means that the strategic
solution to the Negro-question has to be
worked out in terms of struggle pri-
marily of an urban people against in-
dustrial monopoly. It is in an overall
sense a struggle for the industrial ‘in-
tegration of the Negro people econom-
ically and their social-political integra-

T tion.

The strategic class force in the solu-
tion of the Negro question, therefore,

~ becomes ﬁrmly identiﬁed as the Working

class and the Negro component part
thereof. This is not at all to say that
the struggles of the Negro farmers for
the land and for a higher standard of
living and democratic rights as farm-
ers and the need for all democratic
forces to struggle against the reaction-
ary plantation system and farm trust,
is not of great economic and even
greater political importance, both for
the solution of the Negro question and
for the general democratic reformation
of the South. (For a programmatic

, treatment of this question of land re-

form, see The Southern People’s Com-

mon Program For Democracy, Pros- I

parity and Peace, issued by the Com-
munist Party in 1963.)

Distribution of Tenant Farmers in the

In 1954 there were 1.1 million com-
mercial farms in the South, or 11.3%
less than in 1950. The value of the
products sold on three out of ﬁve of
these farms was less than $2500. (On

In 1954 the number of farm tenants
in the United States was 1,167,885. Of
these. 577,021 tenant farms were in the

of all tenant farmers are Negro.

Given a continuous development of
the economic decline, is there a possi-
bility of a signiﬁcant return of Negroes
into agriculture? No. The redistribution
of the Negro population will not reverse
itself. Before the war two-thirds of all
American Negroes were Southern fann-
ers and farm workers; only one-sixth
are today. Now half of the Negro peo-
ple are living in Southern cities, and
one-third of the Negro people are living
in Northern cities. The manpower
needs of agriculture are in steady de-

_ cline. As a result of big strides in tech-

nical progress, the agricultural sector
of the economy produces quantities of
food and raw materials in abundance
with a steadily decreasing number of
workers and on a diminishing acreage.
“From 25.1 million persons on farms in
1950, the total was down 20.4 million in
19.57. Moreover, the recent drop in farm
population from 22.3 million in 1956
(13.2 percent of the U. S. total) to 20.4
million in 1957 (11.9 percent of the
U. S. total) sets a recent record both
relatively and absolutely.” For exam-
ple: “The technology of growing cotton
has been so perfected that the man
hours required to grow a bale of cotton
has dropped since 1930 from 260 hours
to 108, and the average yield per acre
has risen from 157 pounds to 409
pounds today. . . . Cotton culture is so
successful and eﬂicient that 17.5 mil-
lion acres now yield more production
(14,725,0~00 bales in 1955) than was
grown on 43 million acres in 1930.”
Clearly the tendency in agriculture is
one of progressively an-d rapidly expell-
ing the population from the countryside
with no margin for absorbing addi-
tional manpower.

;,

In 1957, farm population was only
12 percent of the total U. S. population,
compared with 23 percent in 1940.

THE NEGRO PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT

I. Character and Objectives

The common objective of Negroes,
wherever they may live in the United
States. is to be free of discrimination.
Negro Americans everywhere aspire to
legal equality with their fellow white
countrymen in the political, economic
and cultural life of the country. The
popular expression “to ﬁght for Negro
rights” is understood by the Negro peo-
ple to mean the struggle for these gen-
eral objectives.

To be able to realize these objectives
it is required that the Negro people in
the U. S. must secure their full right-
ful share of governmental power. In
those urban and rural communities
where they are the larger part of the
population generally, and in the Deep
South area of the historic American
cradle-land of the Negro people par-
ticularly, they must constitute the ma-
7'or-ity power in government.

In its essence, therefore, the struggle
for Negro rights is not a mere “civil
rights” ﬁght, it is a political struggle:
a struggle fora just share of repre-
sentation nationally; a struggle for
majority rule in the localities. where
they are the dominant. people in_ the
population; a struggle for genuinely
democratic representative government
in the southern states in particular and
in the country as a whole. ’

While the essential character of the

Negro pe_ople’s movement for democra-
tic ‘rights and national equality  a
polilicall struggle for adequate govern-
‘mental power and representation ‘in
gwernment in order to enact, enforce
and" "defend the freedom and equality
demands of the Negro people, it is also
a fact that economic struggles and
lpopnlar manifestations can compel
changes in practices and treatment long
before they are given expression in law.

At the heart of this political struggle
for Negro rights at the present time is
the ﬁght for the ballot, for free and
universal suffrage rights. Accompany-
ing this central demand and limited
only by the advances made in achieving
full suffrage /rights, is the fight for
Negro representation. To register suc-

cesses in this regard, certain things are

required:

1. A mobilizing, activizing and unit-
ing, to the greatest possible extent, of
the Negro people and their allies in
support of “unity” candidates commit-
ted to a’ program of equal rights for
Negroes. _ .

2. Maximum mobilization and unity
of . Negro voters in support of “unity”
candidates committed to a program of
equal rights for Negroes. _ l

3. Mutual assistance pacts-, for polit-
ical action_;- an ever solidifying alliance
between the organized Negro suffrage
movement and the Negro electorate on
the one hand, with the organimd labor
movement and popular democratic
rights and peace movement on . the
other. The latter point, i.e., the. linking
of the particular struggle of the Negro
people for Negro rights to the general
struggle of labor for democratic ad-
vancement and peace, for the welfare
of the country as a whole, is required
for winning either immediate or long
range successes. As a minority people
in the country as a whole, victory of
the Negro people is unthinkable except
on the basis that the struggle is fought
in alliance with the oppressed majority
of the whole people, i.e., with the work-
ing class, the poor farmer masses, and
the other strata victimized by the
monopolists.

4. In order to unite the Negro people
and to forge the alliance between them
and organized labor for the struggle
for Negro rights, it is necessary for the
Negro workers to exercise the initiative
and leadership. 9

5. To fulﬁll its historic role of the
“leading force” in the freedom en-
“leading force” in the freedom endeavors
of the Negro people, the Negro workers
must be fully organized alongside their
fellow white workers‘ in the mass organ-
izations of their class, the trade unions.

.13

 

 

6. To‘ best facilitate all developments
in ‘advancing the struggle for Negro
rights, the vanguard, the Communists,
should provide the most concrete leader-
ship _to its forces in (1) the trade
unions and (2) in the Negro mass organ-
izations. These are the primary mass
channels through which the Nero
masses and labor movement are reached
and rallied into the ﬁght for Negro
rights.

(a) For example, through the
agency of the NAACP, almost all of
the organized groups in Negro life
may be reached, inﬂuenced and ral-
lied to struggle——the Negro Voters
Leagues, the Baptist and AME
churches, the Federation of Colored
'Women’s Clubs, etc.

(b) Likewise, through the trade
unions Negro workers are able to
reach and inﬂuence all progressive
developments in the area of the gen-
eral struggle for peace, democratic
rights, economic opportunities and
legislative and political action. They
are able to place the struggle for
Negro rights in this context of the
general welfare of all peoples. They
are the "bonds” which can make fast
the alliance between the struggle of
the Negro people for equality and an
end to jim crow on the one hand, and
the struggle of the working masses
(the majority of the American peo-
ple) against reaction and oppression
and for peace, democracy, and eco-
nomic progress on the other hand.
Therefore, the speciﬁc agencies—-

above all others-—for waging the strug-
gle for Negro rights are the popular
Negro mass organizations and the trade
unions. ‘

The ‘immediate objectives of the Ne-
gro freedom cause are:

1. To force the government and
courts to make concessions toward the
securing and enforcing of the equal
rights of Negroes, against segregation
and discrimination.

2. To force industries to drop bar-
riers against the employment, training,
and upgrading of Negroes.

3. To force landlords to yield conces-
sions on the plantations and to better
the lot of the working farmers.

4. To force public and private insti-
tutions to abandon one restrictive mea-
sure after another.

5. To secure effective representation
in government at all levels.

The longer range goal is to secure
complete equality of citizenship rights
and opportunities for Negroes as a
people, in measure no less than that
obtaining for all other Americans.

What is the primary condition which

14

will enable the Negro people to a
greater or lesser degree to advance
along this path, in keeping with object-
ive circumstances?

The means for achieving this is not
yet in the hands of the Negro masses.
Therefore all eﬁ‘ort must be bent toward
securing the ballot and freeing the Ne-
gro masses from all the restraints of
fraudulent voter-registration and elec-
tion practices ln the exercise of their
right to vote and stand for election. The
objectives are:

1. To win the ballot for, and organ-
ize and unite the bulk of a “block” of
Negro voters-——numbering about six mil-
lion in the South, and about three mil-
lion elsewhere in the country.

2. To effect in the localities and on
a national scale agreements, pacts and
alliances with organized labor, poor
farmers and the ‘progressive groupings
of the popular White masses, for joint
and/or united electoral action in behalf
of common legislative measures and for
the election of mutually congenial rep-
resentation to public bodies on a pro-
portional basis. -

3. Increasingly to achieve Negro
people’s unity and Negro people’s white
working people’s unity in and for the

for mutually advantageous

struggle
demo(“r'atzc -renovations.

ll. Issues and Tasks

Vital issues before the Negro people’s
movement include 1) peace and anti-
colonialism, 2) anti-Dixiecratism, 3)
political action (right to vote, repre-
sentation, legislative issues, etc.), 4)
civil rights and the ﬁght against gov-
ernment and police terror, 5) economic
issues (job discrimination, organization
of the unorganized, housing, land re-
form and farmer assistance, etc.), and
6) defense of civil liberties, of ﬁghters

for Negro rights, including Communists. _

Among the urgent tasks in relation

to the Negro people’s movement are the

following:

1. Enhance the activity of organized
Negro Workers Within the trade unions:
a) for the fight against job discrimina-
tion, b) for organizing the unorganized
southern Workers of factory and farm,
c) for independent labor political action
and against barriers to voting, d) for
labor’s championing of the concrete de-
mands for Negro rights, e) for strength-
ening the activity of left forces in the
unions.

2. Develop the work of progressive

 

.1

' forces within the NAACP and other

Negro mass organizations: a) further
promote unity activities of NAACP and
other organizations; b) extend organi-
zation into rural areas; c) enhance
workers’ participation and leadership in
mass organizations; «d) secure maxi-
mum participation of left forces; e) in-
crease the participation of youth.

3. Sharpen the struggle against
Trotskyism, social democratism, reform-
ism and opportunism in tactics and poli-
cies in the trade unions and the
NAACP. This must be done skillfully,
in united front fashion, with proper
regard for the relation of class forces
in these organizations.

4. Within the right-to-vote and Ne-
gro representation movements, through
the trade unions and the Negro mass
organizations‘, the left forces should
strive for ‘these movements to pursue
a) ' mass pressure tactics of mobilizing
maximum strength ‘of the Negro people,
the trade unions and the white demo-
cratic forces in support of their de-
mands, and b) principled coalition ar-
rangements for legislative measures
and electoral struggles, with opposition
to all opportunist deals with reaction-
ary politicos, and advancement for elec-
tion of those Negro candidates who en-
joy the conﬁdence of the Negro masses.

The-re are a number of issues for
which masses of southern Negroes are
already engaged or prepared to engage
in struggle through their existing or-
anizations, issues which hundreds of
thousands of whites are prepared to

- support through their organizations.
‘These include: 1) universal, equal, di-

rect ballot rights with a full -measure
of representation in public and elected
office; 2) an endlto segregation in edu-
cation, transportation, public ‘parks,
libraries, etc.; 3) FEP and an end to
job discrimination; 4) an end to police
brutality; 5) federal action against
White Citizens Councils and KKK. In
addition, there develop at various times
local, sometimes national, “issues of op-
portunity.”

In -struggles on all issues, it is essen-
tial to strive for concreteness in leader-
ship. In each case the statement of ob-
jective should be accompanied by an
exposition of method and tactics to be
used. Each case should be treated with
regard to the existing situation, the
limited objective and the long-range
goal. The leading main and auxiliary
forces on which We must rely at each
stage shouldbe made clear, as well as
where the main blows must be struck
at each given stage and the single key
objective for that stage. i

To summarize: The goal of the Negrc

rights cause is to secure full equality in
respect to political freedom, economic
opportunities and cultural life in every
part of the United States. The ultimate
means for securing these rights em-
brace the achievement of controlling
political authority in the command of
the Negro people in all localities where
they constitute the majority, and of
proportional or maximum representa-
tion in all levels of government, public
services and public institutions every-
where in .the country.

The conditions for gaining these ends
include: 1) organization of Negro work-
ers and Negro poor farmers in class
unity with whites; 2) relying on Negro
workers to forge maximum unity of the
Negro people; 3) forging of a strategic
alliance of the Negro people with the
proletariat, the poorest farmers and the
agricultural workers; 4) cultivation of
bonds of mutual support and solidarity
with popular movements for peace and
democratic rights; 5) building the Com-
munist Party among the Negro masses.

Among the methods required for real-
izing these conditions are: 1) united
front tactics for Negro people’s unity,
with -main concentration on Negro
workers; 2) united front tactics for
promoting Negro-white unity; 3) con-
centration on selected key issues such
as full suffrage rights, FEP, organiza-
tion of unorganized Negro workers,
world peace, as well as such issues of
opportunity as freedom for Africa,
abolition of Jim Crow in education and
transportation, etc.; 4) quantitative and
qualitative strengthening of Party and
hence Negro people’s leadership.

To ﬁght effectively for these object-
ives, the leading forces of the Negro
liberation movement must be located
within and be solidly based upon: 1) the
organized Negro and white workers,
2) organized bodies of the mass of
landless, poor and middle Negro and
white farmers, and 3) all the demo-
cratic-minded strata of the Negro peo-
ple found in, gravitating around or in-
ﬂuenced by the NAACP.

PROGRAM IN REGARD TO
THE BLACK BELT

The Communist Party champions the
democratic rights of the Negro people
to equality in every sphere of American
life. It also supports the right of the
Black Belt comm.-um'ty to develop fully
and freely in the South.

Towards this end, the Communist
Party works for, and strives to inﬂu-
ence the Negro people’s movement, the
labor movement and all the democratic
forces of the population to wage a sus-
tained and concerted struggle for the

following immediate measures now—the
realization of which would create those
democratic conditions in the South, in
general, and in respect to the Black Belt
area of Negro majority in particular,
for the Negro people there to freely
manifest their right to determine the
course of their own development.

I. Political Demands

For Federal laws and executive and ju-
dicial orders:

1. To abolish the poll tax, to abolish
the arbitrary and. discriminatory
powers of local voter registration
oﬂicials; to secure and protect the
suffrage rights of all citizens of
voting age, Negro and white.

2. To protect Negro and white citizens
in the exercise of their right to full
political self-expression; to partici-
pate in all affairs of the existing po-
litical parties; to be a candidate for
public oﬂice and to conduct a po-
litical campaign free from terrorism.

3. To redistrict, to redeﬁne the bound-
aries of those Congressional Districts,
State Senatorial and Assembly Dis.-
tricts, Judicial Districts, City Wards
and Precincts which were so arbit-
rarily laid out, or so purposefully
gerrymandered as to place the Negro
people in an inferior ratio to the
population of each respective political
subdivision (e.g., the infamous N.C.
“bacon strip” Congressional Dis-
tricts) and thereby secure to them
the opportunity to insure their right
to full representation.

4. For the abolition of the “county unit

system” of deciding the outcome of

elections for state office in those
southern states where this practice
is still in operation.

For the election of judges and mag-

istrates ‘by direct popular vote.

5''.‘

II. Economic Demands

.4. In respect to industry:

1. For an all-sided strengthening of the
trade union movement in the South
on the basis of the unity and equal-
ity of Negro workers with white work-

.ers in the same unions, and .on the
basis of ending discrimination in
wage rates and job classiﬁcation ‘both
as between Negro and white work-
ers, and as between the northern and
southern workers. For the trade
union organization of the unorganized
working men and women in industry
and agriculture.

2. For Fair Employment Practices
clauses, i.e., anti-discrimination stip-
ulations governing the hiring, up-
grading, and job classiﬁcation of Ne-
gro workers, in all contracts negoti-

15

 the uniions  employers.’ 7 N

  iFor”Tan federal law; also,,for

 F.E.P.l state and local laws to out-

w law, job discrimination against Negro
workers. To outlaw the practice of
“lily white” industries, shops, and
job classiﬁcations.

For a broadly based, balanced de-
, ‘velopment of industry in the South
in general, and in the towns and

cities within the counties of Negro

hiring, and promotion policies guar-

anteeing full equality of employment
S opportunities to Negroes.

To the extent that capital investment

increases in the South, to the extent

that industries multiply and mechaniza-

'tion in agriculture expands, the pro-

ductive power Will be further developed
but this of itself will neither emancipate
the Negro people from oppression nor

' materially mend the social condition of
-the mass of the southern people. “But

what it will not fail to do is to lay down
the material premises for both. Has
the bourgeoisie ever done more? Has it
ever etfected a progress without drag-
ging individuals and people through
blood and dirt, through misery and

degradation?” (K. Marx, cited by Wil-

liam Z. Foster in History’ of the Three
Internationals, -p. 303.) ‘

B. In respect to agriculture:

1. Federal and state legislation to im-
prove the conditions of the sharecrop-
pers, farm tenants and wage labor-
ers, inclusive of the following and

related -measures-.- it  " N at w .

a. Written contracts for all classiﬁ-
cations of farm tenants and share-
croppers. ,

b. Increase of the tenants and crop-
pers share of the crop to 75‘ per
cent.

Government credits at low inter-

est rate (of 2 per cent or less)
to make cash payments for family
and household needs.

Extension to farm toilers of the
full protection of the child labor
law, the minimum wage law, and
the eight-hour day.

Extension of full social security
an-d unemployment insurance cov-
erage to all farm laborers, crop-
pers, tenants an-d farmers.

Upholding of the Constitutional
"rights and protection of the farm-
ers in the exercise of their rights
to ‘organize, petition, bargain
with the landlords and to strike
for the betterment of livelihood
and living conditions.

For a federal law for basic land
reform in the plantation country of
the South, to liquidate the planta-
tion system of agricultural economy.
Such a law would provide for:

a. The establish-ment of an agency of
the Federal Government, the ma-
jority of whose board of directors
would be the elected representa-
tives of the mass organizations of
the working farmers, farm labor-1
ers, tenants, and sharecroppers-—

S distribute Iandito the

poorest farmers. , c a  , ,.
This Agency of the Federal 
ernment would accumulate a land
fund by means of (1) the forced

sale (at 1939 prices) = of idle.‘’

farm land holdings of any in-

dividual or corporation in excess{

of an allowable maximum num-

ber of acres and agricultural land S

holdings in excess of 500 acres,
and through (2) a program of
land reclamation and restoration

of fertility and arability to waste- pi .

lands, drainage of swampland,
etc. i

From the land fund thus accumu-
lated, the agency would make land
available on a priority‘ basis to
the neediest farmers, sharecrop-
pers, tenants and farm laborers

in units of adequate acreage for

an effective farm operation ,(60
acres). Credits would be advanced
for the purchase of these farms

_(who-se prices would be a fixed

minimum not subject to market
-speculation) -by the agency. It
would, also, grant interest-free,
long-term loans for purposes of
equipping these farms with neces-
sary farm implements, seeds, 'etc.,
and for constructing homes, barns,
etc. Repaymen-t on the loans for
the farms or the farming needs
not to exceed 15 per cent of the
market value of the harvest in any
one year.

This Agency would establish a
network of farm machinery and

set which ‘are de—  S

Negro people’s movement and extend
it from the cities into the rural
areas.

To foster united action, mutual aid,

groupings, in struggle on issues of
mutual interest, i.e., for the abolition
of the poll, tax, and county unit
system‘; for increase in unemployment
insurance payments, for the desegre-
gation of the schools, etc.

To develop coalition relations between
the organized labor movement, organ-

Aspects of the Negro Question

component of the Negro "people has been’.

_ Pro position I

laThe American nation of the'U.S. is a

 -historically derived, national formation;

anamalvgam of more or less well-diﬁ"er-
entiated nationalities. The Negro peo-

Q pl-e are the most severely oppressed and
_- all-sidedly exp~loi_ted of all the peoples who

make up the American nation of the

A US.

a The Negro people «of the United States
are not constituted as a separately de-

 Avelope-d nation. Rather, their character-

istics are. that of al racialy distinctive
people or nationality who are a histori-
component of the
American nation of the U.S.

Though deprived of their just -and
equal rights and freedom to fully’par—
ticipate in all aspects of the affairs of

4’  the nation, the Negro .-people nonethe-

less have contributed to and have an

ll-inseparable stake in (no less than the
- other

nationality components) the
American nation’s common territory,
and
psychological makeup.

The Negro question in the U.S. is a
“national question”; it is one of the

A many varieties of the national question
j embraced by Marxist science. (See Docu-

ment* p. 11, top half p. 12).
A The op-pressors of the American Negro

A ‘people are the imperialist ruling circles

of the United States: the monopoly capi-
talists who own the biggest industrial-
ﬁnancial institutions of our country, and
through these, control and direct the
economic and political life of the coun-
try. The “extra-take” in super-proﬁts
extracted by this class through the Ne-
gyro-white inequality in wages alone, is
estimated at four billions of dollars an-
nually, a ﬁgure greater than American
its Latin-
American investments.

“The struggles of the Negro people and
V the resultant signiﬁcant advances inspire
 my [Negro Americans with a new quality of

5‘ The “Document" refers to the repctirt: 
t e mt

self-conﬁdence. A profound spirit of na-
tional consciousness and pride in their
racial identiﬁcation permeates the Negro
people of the U.S. today. It ﬁres their
determination to build ever closer their
unity in order to wage the struggle even
more militantly to break down all bar-
riers to their exercise of any and all
political, economic, and social rights en-
joyed by any other citizens.

“Negroes unite not in order to sepa-
rate themselves from the political, eco-
nomic, or social life of our country. They
unite to more effectively employ the
strength of their own numbers and weight
of their alliance with other parts of the
population to level the barriers to their
fullest integration into all aspects of the
economic, political, and social life of the
American people as a Whole. They are
forging an internal national unity to
facilitate tkeir‘st'r*u.ggle for full integra-
tion as free and equal American citi-
zents.” (Convention Resolution, p. 44.)

Proposition H

In applying the classic Leninist deﬁni-
tion of the factors making up a nation
(see Document, p. 14, par. 3), two such
elements must be re-examined in the
light of fundamental changes that con-
tinue to develop. First, the element of
a “stable community.”

Capitalist development in the United
States, particularly since 1930, assails
the stability of communities. The Ameri-.
can population, taken as a whole, is the
most mobile (i.e., the least “stable”)
population in the world. This is no less
true of the American Negro people,
whose position in 1930 was ‘essentially
that of an oppressed, land-bound peas-
antry, and has today become essentially
an oppressed urban working people. This
has resulted in a major alteration in the
geographical distribution of the Negro
people.

As has been historically true, the laws
of capitalist development in America
continue to register profound transfor-
mations on the Various class strata of
the Negro people. As a consequence, the

relative ‘weight of the peasant class-y

decisively reduced and the relative weight
of the working-class strata decisively

increased. The scientiﬁc conclusion to be A if A

drawn from this objective fact is: the
Negro natlonal question in the United,
States is no longer “essentially a peas-
ant question,” the peasantry is no longer

the -basic class component of the Negro _

people, but today its basic class compo’-
nent is the working class.
This transformation in . the absolute

and relative weight of the basic class it

forces of the Negro people’s movement
1S no more reversible than are the ob-
jective laws of development of the sys- _
tem which created these transforma-
tions.

Secondly: the element of “common
psycho-logical make-up.”

Taking into full account all that is dis-
tinctive in this feature of the nation-
like development of the Negro people,
nevertheless, this is not * determinative
for either the solution or representation .

of the Negro question in the United a

States. The main currents of Negro
thought and leadership in the struggle
for advancement and freedom, histori-
cally, and universally at the present,
time, have projected their programs
from the premise that Negroes individ-
ually and as a people are no less Ameri-
cans that any other claimants. Only in
describing the dimensions of their op-
pression have the Negro people repre-
sented themselves as a people apart from
the American nation. ' ’

Proposition Ill

These variants in the essential pre-
requisite features of nationhood (as de-
scribed in Proposition II) compel the
conclusion: the oppressed Negro people
are not a nation and, therefore, the
strategic concept expressed in the slo-
gan: “the right to self—determination,”)
which applies only to nations, is not a
valid, workable, scientiﬁc slogan for

the emancipation of the Negro people in 

America. - V
The Negro question in the United

United States remains a “national ques- _

 

 

 4 life of America, including the right to

  

lotion‘?  deﬁnition as stated in Propo-

sition‘ I.
The Negro question in the United

States remains a special question, com— .
i  mending the attention of the working
class and all forward looking sections of

the American population, because “the
Negro people are the most severely op-
pressed and all-sidedly exploited of all
the peoples who make up the American
nation,” and because the basic material
conditions for their emancipation, and
for the social emancipation of the

American working-class have been pre-
pared by the continuing massive urbani-
zation of the oppressed Negro people.
-(See Document, p. 13). It is also a spe-

cial question because there can be no
further basic advance for the working
people of our country as a whole with-
out the elimination from American po-
litical life of the traditional Dixiecrat

enemies of Negro freedom.

Proposition IV

The "re-appraisal of the “self-determi-
nation” concept and slogan, requires its
replacement by a strategic concept and
slogan which expresses a’ more accur-
ately scientiﬁc, workable solution to the
Negro national question in the United
States.
slogan must answer (as the "self-de
termination’? slogan attempted to do) the
very real problem. ofigovernmental pow-
er for the oppressed Negro majority
population,,c,oupled with radical agrarian

reform, in what remains of the tradi- '
tional areas of most-backward agrarian

relations, intense poverty, and brutal

landlord rule,'in what is referred to as

the “Black Belt” in the South.

The Communist Party program for
the revitalization of -Southern agricul-
ture and radical alterations of produc-
tion relations in the “black belt” re-
mains sound. (See attached “Program
in Regard to the Black Belt” by James
E. Jackson.) , .

The programmatic outlook of the Com-
munist Party on the Negro questionhas
heretofore been expressed in summary
form as:

“The Communist Party stands for the
full economic, political, social and cul-
tural equality for the Negro people, in-
cluding the right to self-determination
in the Black Belt.”

It is recommended that in the future
the Communist Party popularize its po-
sition in the following summary form: ,

“The Communist Party of the United
States stands for the full equality of the
Negro people; their inalienable right to
a fully integrated participation in the
political, economic, social, and cultural

Such a strategic objective and A

the guarantee of genuinely representative
government in the South, with propor-
tional representation, in the areas of Ne-
gro majority population.”

Proposition V

M “The Negro people’s movement is to-
day a standard bearer in‘ the struggle
to open up the now restricted areas of
democracy. It is the decisive strategic
ally of the working class in the current
struggles for liberty and livelihood and
in all stages that lead to the subsequent

achievement of the necessary fundamen-

tal transformation of American society
from the present capitalist exploitative
system to that of socialism.

“Now to cement the Labor-Negro al-
liance,ithrou=gh powerful mass struggles
for Negro rights, is to lay the corner-
stone for that broad anti-monopoly
coalition of labor and the .people’s forces
on which the progressive future of our
country, depends.

“This is the wwxin urwompleted demo-
cratic task of our country, and its ful-
ﬁllment will enormously advance the
goals of the working class and our en-
tire na.tion.” _ (Excerpt from 16th Na-
tional Convention Resolution,‘ pp. 44-45.)

The fact that the scene of the Negro
people’s struggle unfolds within the
bosom of American imperialism, and in
direct and intimate association with the
working class andpopular struggles and
is directed "against the common class
oppressor, feeds into the general stream
of the historic working class cause of our
time a powerful current which raises

. the torrential power of the whole cause

of social advance for the people of our
country. “The question of Negro free-
dom, then, is the crucial domestic issue
of the day, and is at factor of growing
2'ntcrncltz'o'n'al consequence.”

Proposition VI
The struggle against racism (white
chauvinism) is in the ﬁrst instance the
struggle against its institutionalized
forms, as represented in the all-sided
system of segregation in the South, and

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
   

 
 

etc.

In the course of unfolding broad

popular struggles in support of_ the Ne-

gro freedom movement, against the seg-
regation system, the harsh realities of
this racist system in the South must be-
come a knowledgeable part of the ideol-
ogy of the American people as a whole,
and in particular of the working class of
our country.

The democracy-loving forces of the
American people can only come to fully
appreciate the signiﬁcance of the Negro
freedom movement to them by gaining
an increasingly deeper understanding of
what segregation is; of its scope and
depth of practice.

Politically, the segregationist leaders
are the native Hitlers in the political life

    NEGRO OuEsTION IN THE us.

3 INTRODUCTORY NOTE

This is a paper on the Negro question

3 in the United States, the main thesis of
‘ -which was a-dopted unanimously by the
» National Executive Committee meeting
 of September 19-20-21, 1958, and by the

National Committee on December 6-8,

 1958, as the basis for a Party discus-
I_sion.- At the conclusion of the period
of discussion, and on the basis of this

discussion, a formal resolution on the

’Theory of the Negro Question in the

United States will be adopted.
This paper treats the three main

, parts, namely:

1) The status. of the Negro people in
the United States; .

2) The theoretical representation of
the status and nature of the Negro peo-

vple and outlook for soluition to the
T Negro question, and

3) A policy guide to program and
tasks in connection with the Negro peo-

V ple’s freedom cause.

.The reader will bear in mind that the
materials presented and argumentation
developed are incomplete in a number of
particulars. This additional material
will be presented in supplements to this
paper. There is need for further ma-
terial on the Negro people, in respect to
1) political status, 2) legal—statutory
status, 3) cultural status, 4) ethnic

status, 5) organization status, and .6)

educational status. Also desired is a
section on the status of racism and

gwhite chauvinism in the U. S.

In addition there is need for a his-

V _ V torical treatment of the Party’s theory
 «on the ‘Negro question in relation to the

question of self-determination and the
“nation” concept. It should deal with

the deﬁnition of tlie role of the Negro
Communists in particular and the Com-
munists in general in regard to the
Negro freedom cause. Also, it should

treat more fully the relationship be-

tween the Negro freedom struggle and
the building of the anti-monopoly coali-
tion and the socialist goal. The question
of the relevant relationship between the
Negro people’s movement and the anti-
colonial World front against imperial-
ism needs further elaboration.
Notwithstanding the absence of I the
necessary coverage of the above men-
tioned topics, We believe that this paper
will provide much factual material and
a sound general approach for a rich
and creative discussion which will result
in the establishment of an up-to-date

and correct Marxist theory on the
Negro question in the United States.

STATUS OF THE NEGRO
PEOPLE

L Size and Localities of the Negro
Population in the United States

Negroes in the United States number
some 18 millions, or about 11% of the
total population. [Bureau of Census
ﬁgures for July 1, 1957 count 18,766,000
of the population as non-white, of
whom 95.5% are Negroes. Negroes
were 10.8% of the population in 195-5.
As of July 1. 1957 the total U.S. popu-
lation was 171,230,000.] The Negro
population has increased 19% since 1950
and the white population increased 13%
over the same ‘period. [The total popu-
lation in the U.S. has experienced an
average increase of 1.8% per year from
1950, i.e., about 2.7 millions each year.]
Negroes constitute the same proportion
of the total population that they did in
(11.1%) 1910, but have doubled their
numbers since 1900 (from 9,185,000 in
1900 to 17,922,000 in 1957).

‘The population of the U.S. is the
most mobile in the world. Nearly 5 mil-
lion people, 3% of the p’opula.tion,
moved from one state to another during
the year ending in April 1955. The pat-

tern of this movement is from country,

to city and from cities of low economic
activity to cities of higher industrial
activity. The large geographical shifts

EDITORIAL NOTE

We present here in collected form the basic materials
for discussion on the Negro question, including the report
by Comrade Jackson, the draft resolution presented to the
National Committee at its meeting on December 6-7, 1958,
and the discussion which took place at the meeting. The
discussion is presented in full, except for some unfortunate
‘gaps occasioned -by the necessity of changing tapes in the
course of recording the speeches. Two supplements to the
‘report were also presented at the meeting; these have been
§incorp;orated in the report itself. .
M s.gSome of this material also appears in Political Affairs.
Thejﬁrst part of the report appeared in the October, 1958

»Comrade Jackson as a basis for discussion directed toward

issue under the title “Basic Data on the American Negro
People.” The draft resolution is published in the January,
1959 issue, together with the introductory speech by Com.-
rade Jackson: “The Negro Freedom Fight: Current Devel-
opments.” The latter is not in-cluded here.

Following the discussion in the National ‘Committee, the‘
following motion was adopted:

“The National Committee approves \the general line of

Proposiﬁon VII

.The Communist Party, the Party of
Negro-white unity, must continue tobuild
upon its accumulated credits among the
people of our country, by boldly imple-
menting the programmatic line which

flows from our Party’s estimate of Ne- _

gro freedom struggle as “the crucial
domestic issue of the day, and a factor
of growing“ international consequence.”
(16th National Convention Resolution.)

Leadership in the struggle against ra-
cist “white chauvinis-m” continues to be
a major responsibility for our Party,
and especially our white comrades in their
day-to-day contact with the white masses.

Negro Marxists have an indispensable
role to play in the over-all strengthen-
ing of the Negro people’s .movement.
American imperialism and its agents
are quite sensitive to this fact.

i The further development of the all-
class unity of the Negro movement re-
quiring the leadership of its working-
class component; the deepening of its
anti-imperialist ideological content, which
at present ishvery weak; the strengthen-
ing of the Negro national ,movement’s
international ties, ‘through the medium
of personal contact and otherwise; the
unfolding of a consistently correct tacti-
cal line in the day to day battles against

the skilled enemies of Negro freedom;

the consciousyfbauilding up ‘and training

' of its youth cadre for today and to-

morrow’s leadership of the movement; all
of these are necessities which Negro
Marxists can contribute immeasurably

 

towards providing for the liberation

movement.

This calls for their scientiﬁc contribu-
tion at all levels of the organized move-
ment.

Such a weight of responsibility cannot
be fulﬁlled from any position except
one of being within the mainstream of
organized Negro life. Despite whatever
obstacles and ‘difficulties are placed in
their way, by the enemies of Negro
freedom, it is the duty of Marxists to

 

  

eration movement. ;

Development of _an ideologically 6.-
ﬁnable, accepted, Marxist-scientiﬁc trend
in the Negro people's; movement is a con-
tinuing obligation of our Negro com-
rades. This continues to require careful

planning, ﬂexibility in tactics, and con? i

sistency of effort.

Negro Marxists must be second to none
in their demonstrable knowledge of the
history of the Negro freedom movement,
an-d in their, ability to apply the Marx-
ist scientiﬁc method of analysis, in gen-
eralizing these rich experiences into a
practical scientiﬁc theory and practice
of Negro freedorm struggle.

Applying the democratic 6ranization-
al principle of collective work, the Com-
munist Party, U.S.A. is dedicated to the
dischargeof its role as vanguard Party
of the American working class, in the
concrete task of mobilizing our class and
nation to meet the new challenges pre-
sented by the dixiecrat-faseist men-
ace to democracy and the new opportu-
nities for mounting a nationwide offen-
sive, for the ﬁnal and complete destruc-

  National committee Discussiﬂll

‘ The South and the Nation I
(John. New Jersey)

The question we are discussing is the
most important of the questions, as well

I as the most complex,‘ facing not only our

party but the“whole labor and progress-
ive movement. There is a growing em-
phasis that is being placed on the Negro
question in our Party, starting with the

0 16th National Convention, sharpened by

Comrade Jackson in his report of ‘a year
ago (The South's New Challenge, New
Century Publishers) and carried further
by at very ﬁnereport by a Negro com-
rade in New Jersey, which I had the
pleasure of hearing.

‘We are beginning to ﬁll ‘ a gap on

this question but I believe that the con- .

cept of its national character is one that
has to be fought for, explored, and
deepened. For it is not yet fully grasped
or accepted by the Party. This is ob-
sei9va~ble in many things. Among May
Day slogans, for example, we see the
sfogan "‘fo”i~« full, equality, for full in-

tegration of’ the _‘Negro people-" But’

there is a fai1ure‘to' ‘emphasize the heart
of the Negro question in‘ the United
States, which is that of the South,‘ and
to play it up in every way in connection
with all the tasks of the progressive

labor movement.

I want to discuss two aspects in rela-
tion to this, one strategic and the other
theoretical. First, there is the question
of the relationship of the South to the
nation. This is a wide open door which
neither Marxists in America nor any
one else except, notably, a few Negro
historians have attempted to enter, and
which we have got to enter.

Today there exists in our country a

A tremendous move.ment—emanating from

the Negro people in the South, but go-
ing far -beyond that confine- It is also
true that the working class Aold-s
primacy in society, and it is our task to
raise the level of the Working class to
what Lenin calls “link movements”—-

 those links which can move the whole

chain. The startling fact is that on the

two ‘biggest things which have been

moving the American people for the last

p.‘decad<.L—the Negro people’s movement
,_in the South and the peace question-»

the working class, as represented  its
organized labor ,movement, is not only

not in the leadership but is even far
from contact with these two most vital
American questions.

If we as Marxists can find the bridge
that will bring the labor movement into
participation on these questions, we will
be fulﬁlling a vanguard role greater
than what we accomplished in the 30's
in the organization of the unemployed
or the organization of the unorganized,
because we will have a profound effect
upon the history of our nation.~ The
problem of raising in the labor move-
ment ’the concept of the N egro-labor
alliance is one which is not going to be

solved by berating the labor movement

for a philosophy of white supermacy.
We have got to ﬁnd doors to help the
workers and especially the white work-
ers on this question.

In my opinion, the question of the
relationship of the South to the nation
provides such a door. The slogan of “not

only integrate the Negro people of the

South but integrate the South into the

.U.S.A.” is one which can be most mean-
. ingful to white workers, because it takes

into account not only, basic self-interest
but a deep underlying national con‘-
sciousness "which American workers
have got. It means converting what ordi-
narily is a drag upon development into
an asset. There are the problems of

run—away' shops and of wage diﬂ"eren- '

tials as well as -the dilemma created by
the victory achieved by labor in the
elections, because more than half of the

congressional committees are dominated,

by southern congressmen who are ene-
mies of labor.

This dilemma labor sooner or later
will have to tackle. The sooner it does
so and the closer We are to its tackling,
the healthier the situation will be. And
certainly the question of the right to
vote, the enforcement of the 14th
Amendment, will probably be a bigger
issue between now and 1960 than even
the school issue has been in the past
decade. These are matters upon which
we can attract the labor movement and
progressive people and people generally,
even if they have not yet surmounted

A the barrier of white ch-auvinism. The
.fact is that in the concept of completing

the‘ bourgeois-democratic revolution in
the South there is something which can
appeal to white workers, a road to the
building of the labor-Negro alliance.

Emancipation of the Negro womane
-(E. 6.. New York)

I shall -conﬁne myself to one particu

lar point which I think was not empha-
sized enough in any of the main reports

——that is, with respect to the placer of
the Negro woman in the ﬁght for Negro
liberation. Just as the white suprema-
cists rebel at’ giving any Negro full

manhood rights, lest it serve as a spur _
to the ambitions of other Negroes, thus 0
threatening the whole jim-crow system,’-* = s
so does white-supremacy psychology I
prevail against full woman-hood status _
for the Negro woman, lest it threaten I 
physical V. ex-.,

her economic, social and
ploitation. I _

It is time that Negro men aided their
women in destroying these ﬁlthy hang-
overs from slavery. The Negro worman’s
relation to our social structure is a
a question of the gravest importance to

the Negro people in general, and espe- - it

cially to the Communist Party, with
most especial reference to its Ne
members. ‘

" ’:.The Pittsburgh Courier, in addition I
to carrying two items on incidents in-  A
._ volving Negro women in the South, also
‘furnishes excellent... material for sup-' *
plementary reading on this question of 
the Negro ‘woman. There are excerpts S,
from a study by Prof. ‘Robert D. Schu- 
chert of Ohio State University, showing
white persons to I

more than 28,000,000

be of Negro ancestry.

This was generally ignored in the .
press by white persons, including the ;
Daily News. ,1 
mention that because this paper, a day A
» or so before the appearance of the arti- A «
do in the Pittsburgh Courier, had car-

what is common language among the 
Dixiecrat white supremacists, of S the my

had it not been for the degradation. of 0
the Negro woman's status, by the white ~

daughters of white-black unions. For it

I ..,.r._,«.;..-a....___ _ 

 

 

sociation of white men and black women
—~and the forcing was not on the part
of the Negro women.

The Cownlefs supplementary reading
included a Montgomery, Alabama story
about a 69—year~old colonel who alleged-
ly took “indecent liberties” toward
a 15 year-old Negro girl. The colonel
was not prosecuted, and another series
in the Courier entitled, “Who Wants
Intermarriage,” which ran for several
weeks, points out that but for the fact
that white men have abused the Negro
woman for 340 years there would not
have been such an incident. For among
the human rights denied the Negro

' woman in the South is her legal right

to compel the white man who used her
to marry hers The price of Negro
woman’s emancipation, complete and
unqualiﬁed, is a. conscious, purposeful
ﬁght with its own deﬁnite program and
its own rules and procedure as a part
of a general struggle to abolish all
legal inequality between black and
white in the U.S. This ﬁght for the
complete emancipation of the Negro
woman must become a part of the strug-

gie to emancipate women in general,
with white women playing a conspicu-
ous part, and the Communist Party
playing the leading role.

Now, may I propose some additions
to be worked into the Party’s general
program. The Party should include in
its program of liberation of oppressed
national, racial and ethnic minorities
the Puerto Rican, Mexican and Indian
peoples. It should study their interests
as such and ﬁght for these interests on
the basis of Marxism-Leninisln. The
Party in general and the Negro people
in particular would be strengthened as
a result of such an orientation.

Secondly, the Party must make
greater use of the unprecedented chan-
nels at hand through which to reach
and to seek the support of those African
and Asian peoples which U.S. monopoly
capitalism seeks to win over or at any
rate to immobilize, these people whose
hostility our State Department dreads.
In this connection, we are fortunate in
having the U.N. in the U.S. and thus in
having access to these African and
Asian peoples.

Thirdly, there is need for a special

program for the liberation of the Negro
woman, who is forced into an especially
degrading economic and social position
and kept there by the white—suprema-
cist, anti-working-class, white-male su-
premacist attitudes left over from chat-
tel slavery.

Our Mass Responsibilities (Paul. N. Y.)

First of all, I think it important that
both the report and the propositions
begin to tackle ' the theoretical aspects
of the Negro question and to redeﬁne
them more particularly for the period
we are in today. I think that is neces-
sary and that in general the approach
of the propositions and the report is a
correct one.

Secondly, I think the supplement
dealing with the class relationships
within the Negro liberation movement
is very important inthat it emphasizes
the fundamental changes that have
taken place in the last thirty years or
so-—primari1y the tremendous growth of
the Negro working class, both in its
present dominance within the Negro

liberation ~movement and in the nu--
merical growth of Negro workers as a
whole in the basic industries.

This begins to point the direction to
the class relations within the Negro
people’s movement from which must
ﬂow our class orientation and relation-
ship to it in terms of building the
working-class inﬂuence within it. I think
it leads to a more speciﬁc solution of
the crucial problem of the alliance be-
tween the Negro people’s movement and
the labor movement.

However, I would like to deal with
one point on which I feel very strongly,
and that is the crying need to develop,
along with this theoretical reappraisal,
a clear basis upon which to build a stra-
tegic and tactical approach. There is a
crying necessity to develop a mass line,
to develop the strategy and tactics of
the mass movement and the united
front, and to deﬁne clearly the inde-
pendent role of the Left and (what is
not exactly the same thing) the public
role of the Party. We need to define all
these aspects clearly in terms of a con-
crete mass line and mass program. That
seem-s to me the main practical prob-
lem that the Party has to address, and
the theoretical questions should not be
treated in isolation from it.

We must recognize that we are bring-
ing our theory up to date in terms of
the paths that the Negro people have
taken in active struggle and the manner
in which they see their struggle today.
But in putting forward such a theoreti-
cal position, we would be exceedingly
remiss if we did not have immediately
afterward a clear picture of what is to
be done in the mass movement, because
that is what the mass movement is cry-
ing for. I do not think that the Negro
people look to the Left and to the Com-
munist Party now primarily for redeﬁn-
ing the theoretical position on the
Negro question in mass terms, but
rather for the weapons——the strategy
and tactics——for winning their present
struggle. It is this which I think is the
crucial question to which the report, in
dealing with the theoretical questions,
must turn its face.

To be more speciﬁc, what do we mean
when we ask: What should be the stra-
tegy and actics of the mass movement?
It is not enough merely to say, as the
program for the Black Belt does: “The
task of the Communists is to influence
the course of development of these or-
ganizational movements and campaigns
which stem from the activities of the
progressive inﬂuence within the estab-
lished organizations of the masses. It is
not the task of the Communists, at this
stage, to undertake under their own

banner the building of such movements
or the initiation of such forms for the
mass struggle.”

Taken literally, that is true, only it
does not answer the question which the
mass movement poses now. The problem
is that the established leadership of the
Nero people is not only behind the
masses in terms of the mass movement
today, but is by and large sitting on
the neck of the mass movement. Now,
it is quite correct to say that we should
not under our own banner come forward
as the leaders of the mass movement
and say to the Negro -people, “Follow
us!” It is also true that we have to
work within the existing mass organi-
zations to inﬂuence progressive trends
within them. But what do we do in the
concrete situation where these leaders
of mass movements do not lead the
masses in struggle?

For example, in the last few years
all the major struggles involving mass
action have arisen ‘outside the NAACP.
And though the leadership of these
mass movements has come generally
from true representatives of various
mass organizations, it has been only in
individual actions of a speciﬁc and
I-imited nature. There has not been a
uniﬁed development of a line and a pro-
gram involving mass action of nation-
wide scope to reach the present goal
posed by the Negro people’s movement.
Further, as indicated in the report,
there is a struggle within these organi-
zations between a policy of strictly
legal action and one of mass struggle.

The question of an overall unifying
mass line of struggle for the minimum
demands of the Negro people has not
yet been posed by any of the mass move-
ments which has arisen, whether the
Pilgrimage or the King movement in
the South or any other. In saying this,
I don’t mean to detract from the posi-
tive aspects of all these movements, nor
am I criticizing them for'not having
taken this step.

But the fact is that even Reverend
King has not oﬁ"er—ed a line of develop-
ment which is national in scope, an-d
which can unify -the Negro people as a
whole and connect the mass movements
in the North with those in the South.
As a matter of fact, he has been to
some extent boxed in, and has -had to
retreat to a local level of struggle and
to say, in effect: “Our struggle is_ in the
South, and there is no direct way Negro
organizations in the North can give aid
fundamentally to this movement except
by ﬁnancial contributions and similar
means.”

There is not a united ideological ap-
proach to what. should be the general

strategy and tactics of a national, uni-

ﬁed Negro people’s movement. Nor has A

there been a search for the organiza-
tional means which would make pos-
sible the carrying out of such a program
of mass struggle. It is this question
with which the ‘Communist Party and
the Left have to deal, namely, how to
help create the- conditions under which
such a development, which it is quite
clear the masses of the Negro people
want to achieve, can come to fruition.

It is in this sense that our contribu-
tion can be most profound, because it is
a national, unified mass movement
which will be one of the most impelling
factors in bringing the labor movement
and the working class to support the
Negro people’s struggles generally. It
will begin to pose situations in which
millions of white workers everywhere
will have to approach the problem con-
cretely and in terms of mass action-—
not merely in theory, in resolutions, in
ﬁnancial contributions or in participa-
tion only in isolated individual actions.

This is the task that the National
Committee and the ‘Party as a whole
has to face. And it cannot be stated that
we should simply work in the mass
movement, though that is true, and that
we should carry on activity independ-
ently in the name of the Communist
Party. There must «be a Way, in addi-
tion, by which Communists and pro-
gressives can help initiate and develop
mass movements and the drive for or-
ganized action outside the ‘established
mass organizations of the Negro peo-
ple.

In the South, that has already beenr
an actual fact. Although many of the

people involved in initiating local mass
movements there happen to be NAACP
members, by and large they have acted
not ‘officially as members carrying out
a national NAACP line, but outside that
cizicle and through independent chan-
ne s.

This is the problem which to my mind
is fundamental. We must not merely
speak in general of avoiding the pit-
falls of sectarianism and right oppor-

ptunism, but must deﬁne this in terms

of how we do so in initiating and help-
ing to develop the mass action which is
held back by certain sections of Negro
leadership. And that is recognized in
general by the masses. To cite only one
example, after the struggle for the civil
rights law in Congress, the criticism in
the Negro press of the NAACP leader-
ship, including Wilkins, ranged all the
way to calling him a bedfellow of East-
land for selling out the Negrd people’s
movement. Of course, I am not saying
that we should do this, but the fact is

23

; er of misilealdership.
Another problem is the assessment of
ted-(baiting. I think Comrade Jackson
raised it in an oversimpliﬁed manner in
stating that the main problem with re-

gard to Negro leaders is their anti-

Communist attitude. In a sense that is

A true, but the main problem in mass
[terms is that the Negro leadership Otf
I today is not leading and is not doing
I the’ things which are in the interest of

the ‘Negro people as the Negro, people
themselves see them. It is on that level
that the question should be presented.

 It is not their anti-Communism which is

primary in ‘terms of the mass move-
ment, but rather their failure to act
in the interests of the movement.

The most effective way in which the

I .lNegro leadership can be challenged on

anti-Communism anywhere is on their

-‘contention that to support the State
. Department’s

anti-Communist policy

country as the masses see it. On that
issue we -can win, because everybody
can see that, and people are already
saying so without our recommendation.

To conclude, when we tackle any of
the problems that are raised in terms
of mass action, we have to treat them

speciﬁcally in terms of a speciﬁc strate-

gic and tactical approach as to what is
to be done. If we come out publicly with
a theoretical position on the Negro
question and then wait six months be-
fore We determine what is to be done,
the Negro people will look at us in
amazement and say: “Well, they ﬁnally
arrived at where we are now in our

struggles, but have nothing to say about ’

what should now‘ be done.” They want
from us an answer to: “What should we
do?” They agree on many questions as
to the Negro liberation movem-ent and
the colonial liberation movement. What
they want is the ways and the weapons
with which to win, and we have to help
provide those weapons.

Negro-Labor Unify (Jim. Mich.)

I think Comrade Jackson’s report was
a pretty good one, although I agree with
the speaker before me, who brought out
one particularly important fact around
the
South headed by Rev. King. That is, the
report fails to tie in what the next steps

are, what should we do to help it con- ~

tinue to advance.

Secondly, I think the report did pretty
well in pointing out the main enemy of
the Negro people’s, struggle. It men-
tioned monopoly capital, an-d I think it
named some Dixiecrat rdesperadoes."

I would like to point out a danger
that I see in regard to la.-bor’s role in

this struggle. We -can all agree that

labor has a major role to play for its

own beneﬁt in the struggles of the‘

Negro people. However, in the last elec-
tion in Michigan, there almost devel-
oped a situation in the Negro commu-
nity where the relationship between the
labor movement and the Negro leaders

and politicians was badly strained. This.

is one of the dangers in this type of
struggle. It is one of the key things that
we have to understand. We must play
a role that will guarantee that this will
not exist generally in the struggle for
Negro rights.

I think something should be added to
Proposition I, which says: “Though de-
prived ' of their just and equal rights
and freedom to fully participate in all
aspects of the affairs of the nation, the
Negro people nonetheless have con-
tributed to» and have an inseparable

ality components) the American, t.natio7n,s:‘,

guage, culture ‘and psychological make‘-

up.” To strengthen that, it might be I

added that the Negro people have con-
tributed even more in some phases of
building America. They have done so by
the very fact that they were slaves and
were forced to give
building the economy of America.
While thinking of the struggle of the
Negro people in the South and in the
country as a whole, we should try to
see its relationship to the World move-

ment as well. I think this is one of the A

weakest points of the American ruling
class in its relationship to other coun-
tries, and in particular to the African
and Asian countries. This was men-
tioned in the report, but I think some
detailed analysis should be made. A bet-
ter connection should be made in bring-
ing the understanding of the struggle
of the Negro people to these peoples in
relation to their own struggles. , I

Our Party is looked upon to show the
way and to show advanced thinking in
this field, even though we have no
monopoly on it. I think that over the
years we have not lived up to these
expectations. Today our Party has a
responsibility, ﬁrst, itself to understand
this «discussion that is now taking place

' around the Negro question and then,

when it is all worked out, to place it in
the hands of the leaders of the Negro
people’s struggle so that they them-
selves may «begin to orient their think-
ing as to how this struggle should un-
fold and give proper guidance to it. A lot
of thinking has to go into the discussion
of this report, and I think it will take
months to ﬁnalize a deﬁnite program.
And I am not through thinking yet. I
intend to do a lot more, and when I do
I hope to be heard from again.

‘Some Questions on Self-Determination
(Charlene Mitchell. Cal.)

Even if I should ﬁnd myself in agree-
ment with the report and the proposi-
tions presented here, I would be unable
to -discuss them in just that light be-
cause of the previous lack of discussion
in the Party as a whole and among the
Negro comrades in particular.

I feel that this is truenot only of our
area where, among other things, we did
not get sufﬁcient time to discuss the
question. I think this is a very serious
problem, one that needs a gerat deal of
attention, and one which we will not be

able to solve either. here today or for

some months to come.
One of the main weaknesses that I

  

 
   
  
 
  
     
 

labor itself in‘

 
 

 

  

. ale, with some g, of N the  many
  . that were made by Lenin
and later -byrrstalin. It has been my

pin 11 that -Stalin was considered an

authority on the national question, and
it seems to me that we based at number
of our" opinions on why we thought the
Negro people were a nation on some of

thewritings of Stalin. I think that we

;_at least owe it to ourselves to think
5 about why they are not true for ‘us
i today.

Also, the Party has to answer the
question of whether or not the slogan of

 _self-determination, if it is not correct .
L now, was ever correct. If it wasn’t, I
" “don’t think that this has properly been

proven by the‘ report.
In the Communist Party Position on

‘the Negro Question in 1946, just 12

years ago, the Negro people in the

lBIack Belt were characterized as a na-

tion, and the -Communist Party position

*at'that time was to struggle for the

A i right of self-determination for the

 Negro people. I have not been sum-
N ciently satisﬁed that this is no longer
‘true. *

.1 don’t think, accordingto individuals
with whom I have discussed this, that
the comrades who -agree with the re-

}.port can ﬁnd in it that which will back

up even their own argument. And I
think that as Communists, we owe it to
ourselves, if we are going to change a
position, to make the reasons for that

. change a lot clearer than has been done.

Whenever the question of the right of
the Negro people to self-determination

,is raised, the point is m-ade that the

Negro people are’ struggling to be in-
terated, to be equal, and not to be sepa-
rate. Well, I don’t think that there is

it . any contradiction between the right ‘to
1self-determination and the struggle for

equality and integration.
I am sure all of you are familiar with

N the quote from Stalin which says that
“a people has a right to secede but it

may or may not exercise that right
according to the circu<m-stances.” When

it we discuss that question we must put it
in that light, and-not in the light that
-thestruggle for integration is bound to

be different from the struggle for self-
determination. ‘ ,
' There ‘is also the question of the

I Negro people being now more an urban

than an agricultural people, and the

. argument that this changes their status
as far as nationhood is concerned. Here

Iwould like to quote from Stalin a little
further.‘ He says: “The persons consti-

tuting a nation do not always live in one L

L‘ at ,.

, ,   d L; 1¥1.t1iisit tlfoirieiii
territories. It is

came welded together but there is also’
no doubt that in the high-er stages of
capitalism‘ a. process of dispersion of
nations sets in, a process whereby whole
groups separate in search of a liveli-
hood.”

Going further into the question of
urbanization, those Negroes who have
moved away from the land and have
gone into industry--and by the way,
still into the most menial types of jobs
-—have not been completely ihtegrated
into all jobs. They have gone largely

' into the urban South, and not alto-

gether into the North. And if the urban-
ization of the Negro people means that
they are no longer a nation, then how
can our country, the U.S. be a nation?
The facts and ﬁgures in the report show
that the whole farm population is
dwindling in the US., but I don’t think
that means that the U.S. is becoming
any less’ of ‘a nation.

There are some questions that I have.
I think a -number of people have such
questions. I know that those who have
discussed, the subject with me have
them. We owe it to ourselves and to the
Party as a whole to become very clear
on these questions, and we must not

A deal with programmatic questions as we

do with theoretical questions. There
are times when programmatic questions
will arise before you can solve a theore-
ti-cal question. But programmatic ques-

tions flow from a theoretical point of‘

view, and I think We have to begin with
a correct premise before we come up
‘with the right kind of an -answer.

With this in mind, I think that we
should have a number of state, regional
and all kinds of other conferences tak-
ing place. A national Negro commission
meeting should be set up, where com-
rades can come togeth-er to discuss this
question, not for part of a day‘ but in a
two-day meeting, so that they can begin
to come to grips with this problem.

Why A Change Is Needed
(JamestS. Allen. N. Y.)

The documents before us, taken to-
gether-the Propositions, Program in

should result in a fruitful ‘discussion.
Their general approach gives promise

tion will remove an obstacle .*to _
and more effective Communist count“

Some time ago it was ‘already  vi
that developments within the .co_runt

approach, would force us to reexami
fundamentally our previous program"
self-determination. Objective tchanges
within the economy of the country,
wel_l as the course taken "by the ‘Ni

Apeople’s struggle, force us to -‘do ‘so.

First, I would like to say a few war
about our old position. I think Gomraw
Charlene is quite correct in pointing I ‘
the necessity for the Party to explain
to the public at large as well asto? 
own members the reasons for a_\ chan
in position. But in the process of doing
so, we do not want to lose sight of the
positive and permanent aspects of our
previous position. _ It ~

What was wrong in our pro $5
position was its programmatic den! nd
self-determination for the Negro] peo-
ple in the Black Belt, since life "2
shown that the development is
toward a fulliand distinct nationhood in
that area. But the basic national ap-
proach was not wrong then and is 
wrong today. If anything, events The
conﬁrmed this fully. ' V .

We were correct in seeing the oppres-
sion of the Negro people in our times
a consequence of the failure to comply‘
the Civil War revolution. We were 
‘rect in seeing Negro oppression
merely as a shadow” of the old est
system but as founded concretelybn
real remnants of the old regime in? th
South, upon the persistent iplantation
cropping economy with all its economi
social and political offshoots.

, We made a real andlasting contribu
tion also in seeing the Negro peop 
they struggle for freedom today, as,a
ally of the working class. _ We sf
clearly the strategic importance of tin
alliance, bothgfor the Negro people i
for the working class as a whol 
precept that we have to  up
ﬁrmly and develop further fort 
ent situation. The Labor-Negro valliaﬁ I
is .the._key to. progress in  coun 

I .

 
  

 

 

 A Another aspect of the Party’s contribu- '
 tion’ was the clear perception we had of
V the speciﬁc responsibility of the white

worker, as a member of the oppressing
nation, in the struggle; against racism

 and white chauvinism, and particularly
I . the role of the white Communist in this
respect. And the special role of the ._

Negro worker and Communist particu-
larly in ﬁghting for working class
unity as a whole, and for the expression
of that unity in terms of working class
inﬂuence and leadership within the

5‘ Negro liberation movement. The condi-

tions of the struggle have changed, but
these principles are fundamental. They
"need to be applied in a new situation
where the main task in the labor,move-
mentis to raise it to the higher level of
cooperation with the Negro people that
is now required, and within the Negro
people's movement to find the appropri-
~ ate -means to offset the weaknesses of the
prevailing middle-class leadership and
the inﬂuences of reformism, which in-

 terfere on both sides with the alliance
between labor and the Negro people.

I All these aspects were fundamental
to our position, and still are.
Thinking it over, I have come to the
conclusion that the self-determination
slogan was wrong at the time it was
raised, and not only for today. This
mistake reflects a number of things. For
one, it was a mechanical carry—over of
a national solution which is applicable
in general to peoples moving in the di-
rection of distinct and separate nation-
hood, whether their status be colonial,
semi-colonial, or some other form of
dependency. Now it is much easier for
us to see that mistake from hindsight
(there is no crime in seeing things from
hindsight if you have to——~that is the
way we learn from history and from

our own mistakes). It turned out that _

monopoly capitalism (under the impetus
of war) was still capable of internal
expansion, and this led to mass Negro
migrations from the Black Belt planta-
tion economy into industry South, North
and West. We were led to believe that
this process, which began on a mass
scale during World War I, had been
permanently brought to an end during
the great crisis of the '1930’s. Many
others. shared this mistake with us. At
that time it was the general impression
that with respect to internal economic
development American capitalism had
reached its apex and had fallen into a
condition of -permanent stagnation, had
indeed entered upon a period of con-
stant decline. It was not then antici-
pated that there would be further in-
dustrial expansion which would lead
monopoly capital to tap the labor supply
of the Black Belt to a greater extent

than during the first War.

Now it is obvious that a lot of things
have happened since we first formulated
the Negro program. I -believe that in
the material which [Comrade Jackson
has presented to us he has correctly
characterized the main signiﬁcance of
the change. From a peasant people in
the majority, the Negro has become
predominantly a people of wage-earners
in the industry and occupations of the
U.S. as a whole, and not only in the
South. At submerged levels, not on a
basis of equality——but a basic change
has taken place that requires a new
look at our position. As I have said,
we should explain in detail and clearly
why we ﬁnd it necessary to change our
previous position. As a result, I think,
we will gain much greater respect
among everyone for having the cour-
age and the boldness to look facts in
the face, to acknowledge our previous
error, and to set forth the necessary
change in position.

Now I turn brieﬂy to the problem of
deﬁning theoretically the characteristics
of the Negro question as a national
question. More thought has to be given
to some of the key formulations in the
material before us. I have in mind par-
ticularly placing the characteristics of
the Negro people as those “of a racially
distinctive people or nationality who
are a historically determined component
of the American nation of the U.S.”

The first question arises with respect
to the term “racially distinctive,” a char-
acterization which is misleading and
open to mis-interpretation if « used in
this way. That is not the basic factor
which determines the oppression of the
Negro people or their status of nation-
ality. These have been determined

basically by historic factors within the
country, to which I have already re-
ferred. Racial characteristics have
played an extraordinarily important
role, for the oppressor used these to
spread racism in a very active way as
an instrument in keeping the Negro
divided from other Americans and keep-
ing him in an oppressed status. As a
reaction to this, the factor-of race has
also served among the Negro people as
a means of building up consciousness
and identity as a people or, as we also
put it, as nationality. Although of great
importance, the factor of race is sup-
plementary to the prime condition of
oppression and the consequent striving
of the Negro people for full equality
and freedom. In my opinion, the prime
obstacles to freedom (in the present,
bourgeois sense) are still the economic
and social remnants of the old system
in the South (With their effects
throughout the country), which require
the completion of the democratic revolu-
tion. Therefore. in a deﬁnition of the
status of the Negro as a people the
basic emphasis should be upon continu-
ing oppres~s_ion——an “oppressed people or
nationality,” with the race factor
treated as derivative. (1 note here that
this marks a change from the deﬁnition
I suggested during the pre-Convention
discussion, which I now consider incor-
rect.)

With respect to the second part of the
deﬁnition, I think it is incorrect to con-
sider the Negro people as “a historically
determined component of the American
nation of the U.S.” The fact is that this
status of full integration still has to
be historically determined, for his-
torically the status that has been estab-
lished is one of oppression by the

 

, idoininant. Dixiecrat, monopoly-imperial-

 

 

      
 

ist forces. But what has also been
historically determined, and this is most

in important, is‘ the development of those

class and social forces which can de-
cide the question in the direction of full
equality, in the direction of free in-
tegration, making the Negro in fact a
component of the American nation.
That is the objective, that is what the
Negro people want in their great ma-
jority (as their demands and struggles
demonstrate), that is what the working
class——white and N egro——needs in order
to achieve the class aspirations, against

V‘ monopoly and reaction. The process still

lies before us, at a ‘higher level than
previously, but its outcome still has to
be assured, most of all by the develop-
ment and strengthening of what is
basic to it--the Negro-labor alliance.

I also want to make brief mention of
the necessity of taking into account
such separatist tendencies as do exist
among the Negro people, especially
since we are placing so much emphasis
upon the integrationist outlook. This is
a contradiction which exists objectively
in the situationwstruggles and aspira-
tions for equality through free integra-
tion, side by side with the tendency (as
a counter-action to Jim Crow) to sepa-
rateness and identity as a people. The
latter expresses itself positively in the
obvious fact that the Negro people rely
in the first place upon their own unity,
their own organizations, their own na-
tional-type institutions and movements

‘to safeguard their rights and to ﬁght

for full equality. The decisive factor
that can overcome ‘this contradiction is
to be found in the working class and in
the labor movement——a fully adequate
and energetic effort to smash Jim Grow
in the South and everywhere, ﬁrmly
welding the labor-Negro alliance, and
thus clearing the ground for a fully in-
tegrationist situation in the labor move-
ment itself, as the key to full equality
in the nation as a whole.

Finally, a programmatic View on the

-Negro question needs to include a more

complete statement of the relation of
the Negro freedom movement to the
socialist goal and to the transitional
program of the anti-monopoly coalition
for this period of struggle.

We Must Work in the Mainstream
(Jesse. N. Y.)

I am in complete agreement with the
theoretical basis of the dodumte-nt. /I
certainly think the question of dropping
the slogan of self-determination does a
number of things. For one thing, it

‘ opens the way for us very clearly with-

in the Party, and among the Negro
cadre themselves, to determine whether
full integration is possible, or whether
on the other hand we will oppose that
struggle and pursue the other aim of

nationhood. The question of setting the _

pace and the" "direction of where we are
going is extremely important at this
moment.

I say it is necessary to drop the slo-
gan of self-determination because there
is no question, as the document states,
that a general shift of the Negro popu-
lation from the rural areas to the urban
center ‘has taken place. For example, in
the county in which I was born, West
Louisiana County, which at one -time
had an overwhelming population of Ne-
groes, today the economic situation
alone has pushed them into the urban
centers in and around Louisiana, thus
greatly reducing the Negro population
which then existed there.

 

If we are to move forth into the gen-
eral struggle for full freedom for the
Negro people, then a correct line is
necessary. The big question is: Do we
believe that full integration is possible?
If we do, then it is necessary for us to
join the mainstream of the Negro peo-
ple who feel and see the possibility of
winning a complete victory and com-
plete freedom based on being part of
the over-all American nation.

This, in my opinion, will undoubtedly
become clear amongimany who feel full
integration is impossible. Certainly
there will be questions in states like
Mississippi or South Carolina, but the
over-all impact of the Negro people's

niovement throughout the nation, par-

ticularly in the northern centers and the
urban centers of the South, raising the
demands of the Negro people, certainly
will be fe1t—above all, the tremendous
role that will be played by the Negro
labor forces in these urban centers. If
we agree that the Negro workers in
the main must play the unifying role
among the Negro masses, then We can
see that in this process the motion of
the Negro people can develop and at-
tract large sections of the white masses.

In dropping the slogan of self-deter-
mination, making way for unfolding the

 

mass struggle we have talked about,"
and developing a mass line, we must
begin to examine a number of ques-
tions of how to go about this particular
type of struggle. ' »
among the Negro people a host of na-
tional organizations. These national or-

ganizations certainly are, in my opinion, 

playing the key role in whatever strug-
gle is now taking place in the ﬁght for
freedom If -this is so, then it is neces-

sary for us to examine our role in the 
basic centers of the Negro people in I

order to guarantee the proper unfolding
of a mass line to achieve and help
strengthen the base for struggle. There-
fore the -big question is to develop the
mass line and the mass role of the
Party and to turn its attention to the

centers of the Negro people that are 5

national in scope. ‘V

Some raise questions about the move-
ment of Dr. Martin Luther King and
others and their inability to give co -\—

sistent leadership. We should not debate - -I

about these organizations and their lead-
ership without also debating about our-
selves and the role we ,must play in
helping to give consistency and leader-
ship of a kind that will not permit a
movement to fall apart because of the
inability of the existing leadership to
see all of the things that are involved
in developing a liberation movement.
Therefore our role becomes a key one.

In line“ with the report and the re-
marks of Comrade Jackson, I think a
drive must be made to kick out of the
Democratic Party the -Dixiecrat forces
which are the base of the J im-Crow and
the reactionary system in our country.

We should therefore not underestimate « it

the necessity to work within the frame-
work of this party. I would like to cite
some examples. .

In most of the northern centers we
were unable to extract from those who
were running for office a pledge to kick
the Dixiecrats out of the Democratic
Party. However, in my opinion, had the
orientation to the broad movement of
the Negro people -been one of bringing
the necessary pressure from the broad
mass of the people on candidates
throughout the nation, I am sure we
would have gotten a greater amount of
support for such a measure.

It is necessary to see where we must
place emphasis. While we must fight for -
the unfolding of the independent role_ of

the Party, we must at the same time .

place emphasis on the united, front,
from the point of view that here is
Where the maximum, motion and the
maximum pressure is generated. For an
example, in -the ﬁght in the Democratic

Party around Congressman Powell in. 

There exist now L _

to -A necessary that the

r Harlem, the Party made  main con-

tributionl by ,helping to .bring together

and‘ consolidate the independent move-
ojment around Powell. And since then, the
progressive forces who have remained
and participated

 Democratic Party, have been able to

Work and to find ways to project a more
advanced ‘program. »

T ,As.we move forward, it is even,more
independent role
played by the Party is properly esti-

 mated, and not overestimated. For this

can lead to the danger of seeing the

 party as playing the major role and

itself moving the masses, instead of

T * V placing the emphasis onthe necessity to

move into the mainstream.

One comment on the question of left
centers. I think this is extremely im-
portant to the Negro people. I feel that
there is need for a certain kind of left

‘ ’ center in relation to developing our pro-

gram for the kind of left center which

can play the role of uniting and building
 the people’s movement. However, those

which are mechanically set up’ and can-
not play ‘that ‘role will not serve the
best interests of the mass movement or

the Party. Let me say this.

MI, ‘'think: that  we are able to bring

to A the « Negro cadre" _in the main into the

mass‘ movements , of the Negro people,

3 there is a" base -for work. We cannot be

in a position to exert mass inﬂuence
in "these centers overnight. On the con-
trary, it is necessary to -set a perspec-

N T tive of two, three, or ﬁve years for shift-

nag, our cadre into the main movements
of the people. Had we begun to do this
in 1950, today in 1959, nine years later,

Wwe ‘Would have a far different situation

in relation to the ability to move events

-and activities in the main centers.

If we are able to properly to asses-s

 the tremendous influence of socialism
, on the American working class move-

ment, including both ,Negro and white

. Workers, this gives us opportunities to

unite the workers and win important

N ‘victories at this stage. The world move-
 ment cannot be denied. Take the ques-
"otion of forestry in the U. S, I was just

reading a book on forestry in which the

 . New York Forestry Society was discuss-

icing forestry in the Soviet Union and on
that basis was moving to reshift their

 forestry policy. If the Soviet Union has
this effect on forestry, imagine the ef-

fact it has on the general population of
{this country. Therefore, there are tre-

 mendous possibilities «or moving and
 ivvinning i victories. '
It"is possible'to' see the tremendous

role of." the Negro worker ‘surging for-

 all y  of __struggle. But I

a

think the foremost task that must
emerge is to make every state a model
state in the sense of bringing the
masses into motion around a particu-
lar issue. As a result of that we will
be in a position to move the. masses

' ‘over a period of time into a united action

for freedom throughout the nation.

oWha+ Is Our Starting Point?
(Bob Thompson. N. Y.)

I think that in the report A and the

resolution we have a very substantial
and valuable ‘basis for opening a Party-
wide discussion on the Negro question.
These documents perform a very valu-
able service in that they forthrightly
correct our previous Party position on
two very important questions: first,
that the Negro people in the Black Belt
are evolving in the direction of sepa-
rate nationhood and secondly, that the
struggle of the Negro people in the

‘country as a Whole is of a separatist

character. This is a very, necessary cor-
rection‘ of our previous position.

With respect to the question of self-
determination, it seems to me that we
should make very clear in our presenta-
tion that we are not doing something
that we cannot do, and that is to with-
draw the right of self-determination for
the Negro people. What is happening
here is that with our estimate that the
Negro people are not moving in the
direction of separate nationhood, this

slogan of self-determination has no  

longer any real. Yalidity in life, andis
therefore dropped as an active slogan
in the Party. It seems to me, however,
that. the handling of these very _im,-
portant corrections is done in such a
way that the special, national character
of the Negro question is to some extent
de-emphasized. ' r -
.I believe that in part, this arises
from the fact that while a basic theo-
retical presentation of the Negro ques-
tion must correct these two aspects of
our position which were basically in-
correct, that is not the starting point
for the development of a theoretical
presentation of the Negro question in
the U.S. That starting point has to be,
rather, an explanation of why this ques-
tion has -erupted into the . number one
social and political problem confronting
our country at this particular moment.
It has to explain why the movement of
the_lNegro people is in this period taking
on more fully a people's and a national
character. ’ i T '
Take the development of the struggle.
in the South, for example, the Mont-
gomery boycott struggle or the battle
around Tuskegee. Never since the Civil
War period and the Reconstruction days
have the struggles of the Negro people
taken on such a people's and national
character as ‘those movements ‘have. In
the North, look at what happened in
the Powell campaign where a whole
community, Harlem, acted as a people
in that struggle. In any question that

9  é1s*eiwh;é;-r’e,_ lwhatfdov we
/mmediately ﬁnd? The very special role
that thej,Negro people play as such; in

 the trade" union _movement, for example,

the Negro caucuses. It seems to me that

the explanation of these things in a
‘fundamental way is the number one

task that is placed before us in the

I theoretical treatment of this question.

' In order to explain them theoretically
we must center attention not merely on
the fact that the Negro people are a
national minority and suffer national
oppression; there are other minorities

gwhich suffer national oppression. We
~ have to center our attention on what is

special, what differentiates the oppres-
sion of the Negro people in this country
from that of any other sector ‘of the
population. In this, our starting point
must be a recognition that the develop-
ment, of -the Negro people of the U.S.
has; been a historical process.

"It is not enough to say, as this docu-
ment does, that the “Negro people of
the US ‘does not constitute a separately
developed nation.” That is correct. But
when one says that, one must say‘some-
thing else,'namely, that the peculiar his-
torical development of the Negro peo-
ple in the U.S. resulted in their develop-
ment of many of the attributes of na-

tionhood. True, these never culminated

in the full development of nationhood
for ,the"Negro people, and essentially
some of the reasons for this are cor-
rectly set‘ forth‘ in the document. But
one cannot understand the special‘ char-
acter of the oppression of the Negro
people, and therefore the special stamp
which is placed on their movement and
on their course of development. without
understanding that which is historically
different -from any other sector of the
people in the U.S. ‘

The second question which I would
like to say a word on is that I think that
our presentation of the theoretical as-
pects of the Negro question, especially
as it relates to the course of develop-
ment of the Negro peop1e’s movement,
must pay much greater attention to the

"world context in which this movement

is developing, on the inﬂuences exerted
on this movement by the fact that it
coincides with the full ﬂowering of the
national independence movement on a
world scale, and by the special relation-
ship of that movement with the social-

7 ist forces of the world. This is unques-

tionably going to leave a tremendous
imprint on the direction of the Negro

people's, movement as it develops in the

period ahead. .
Finally, I think that it is true that

we ......t approach the“ question of lien:

initiative and left‘ centers among the
Negro people with a great" deal of “cau-
tion and deliberation. Certainly‘, our
criteria for such initiative and centers
must be that they contribute to and
stimulate those trends and currents
which help to unify, in the ﬁnal analy-
sis, the Negro people's "movement. But
that should not cause us to underesti-
mate the value of certain left initiatives
and centers.

One of the main lessons of the’ Ben
Davis campaign, for example, in ' the
electoral ﬁeld, with a Party candidate,
was the avenue for carrying forward -in
a most effective manner the united
front policy of the Party and for ef-
fectively contributing to the unity of the
Negro people around the Powell cam-
paign and the whole development of
that struggle in Harlem. If we cor-
rectly assess the role of‘ our Party we
will see as -one of the essential aspects
of its activity: those initiatives, in its
own name, and sometimes as a part of
the left grouping among the Negro
peoeple-which .are essential for unfold-
ing fully-and effectively its basic policy
of united front. -

Negro Rights in the South (Bill. South)

First of _all, I am in accord with the
document. I recognize some of the weak
points, which I will not be able to go
into at this time. But I do feel, as some
of the previous speakers have brought
out, that this document does open the
avenue for our Party and has opened a
discussion which begins to reach a real
approach to the Negro‘ question, and
particularly in the South, as well as the
rest of the nation. '

I want to speak also on the question
of the right of self-determination. This
question goes very deep with me, be-

cause I was brought into the Party .

around this particular question. And I
want to say that I "am proud this after-
noon to be able to listen to Comrade
Allen, because it was in his pamphlet
known as the Liberator, a small pam-
phlet, 27 years ago, that I was able to
read about the Negroes in the South be-
ing a nation. At that time I could not
read; I had to spell every word. If the
Word was “is,” I had to spell “i-s, is.”

There were six of us at that time and
we met every Sunday morning to discuss
this pamphlet on the right of self-de-
termination. There was a little map on
it showing the Negro majority areas in
the South, and as we understood it at
that time, this Negro ‘nation was the
beginning of the South. The slave-hold-

ers who brought in these lhundredsr

thousandsof Negro slavesiin the lbegifn .,
ning to till the land,__ as we understood.

it,’ were‘ creating a majority as we 
cussed it and as we understood it.’ 

Whether this "was a correct Marxistf-_:.
Leninist- approach or not, that is the
way we understood it. We discussed?
what would be our position on separa-
tion. We decided at that time that 
would not ﬁght to separate but to unite. a

white and Negro. '

Now, if we approach the Black I Belt 
as we see it on that map in thatdocu-C  
ment, we don't have that Black Belt any I I N I

longer. I was raised in one of those
Black Belt counties, a cotton belt county.

I can hardly ﬁnd anybody, now in, that
same county, where there were once  fu
hundreds and hundreds of ‘Negro ‘sh'are- N

croppers. -

This is the picture of a whole stretch I I
through the Carolinas, Georgia,  

bama. You ride for hundreds of miles

and see only trees and woods. The peo-

ple are gone. Where are they? I con-
sider they are where the report says

they are, in the shops, factories, unem-

ployed——-in the southern cities as well as
in the northern cities.

It-seems to me that on the question is 

raised A in this document on the role’. of
labor we must have = a program, an
approach. If we are to play our roleras

Communists, it is not enough to say that l
r labor must play its role. What we have u

to do is dig down. an-d organize as in the
days of building the C10 in the south.
In‘: those days we reached and organized

thousands of poor white workers and 

taught them the importance of ﬁghting

for the Negroes around their day to day a

needs. This is important. .

lWhen you found an unemployed white.

worker, hungry, without relief, it was
not difficult to show him how to get
together with the Negro and go down
and get relief. This we were able to do
many times. And we have to convince

the white worker now that it is for his .1

own security that he must ﬁght for
Negro rights. ‘The past experience of
many of us in the South shows that this
is one of the keys by which we will be

able to unite whites in the ﬁght for

Negro liberation there.

Our Party can play a role in the,
South, but let us avoid the serious mis-- I
takes which: were made in the past. I,
think that one of the most serious was  ,

the liquidation of the Southern Negro

Youth Congress. Today it is some of 

the-people who came uplin the Southern,
Negro Youthcongresswho are in the

in-the location of the Negro population
and the characteristi-c trends indicated
in the demographic pattern of the popu-
lation distribution of the Negro people
in the U.S. corresponds to the afore-
mentioned general features of mobility
for the population as a whole.

In 1900, 77.4% of the Negro popula-
.tion lived on the countryside. As late as
1940 only 47.9% of the Negro popula-
tion was urban. But by July 1956 some
63% of the Negro people were urban
dwellers, which was in comparable ratio
to the 64% urban for the population a
a whole. '

Between 1940 and 1950 the Negro
population in the states of Michigan
and California doubled. In the same
decade the Negro population doubled in

“some 45 cities which have populations
of 50,000 or more. (Of these 45 “cities,
all but Baton Rouge, La. and Lubbock,
Texas, are outside of the South.) Also,
by 1950 there were 16 non-southern and
11 southern cities in which the Negro
population was in excess of 50,000 and
10 per cent or more of the total number
of inhabitants.

There are now a dozen Northern and
Western cities which count a hundred
thousand or more Negroes in their
population. ‘The metropolitan areas of
New York and Chicago both embrace a
million Negroes and more than half‘ a
million reside in the Greater Philadel-
phia area.

Of the Negro city dwellers (64% of
all Negroes), 74% live
major cities.

When the Negro population moves
from the country to the city, and from
the “jobpoor” city to the “job rich”
city, it translates itself into a move-

_/ ment from the historic areas of Negro

population concentration in the south-
ern plantation country (the rural
“Black Belt” counties) to the southern
cities, and, from the South in general
to the North and West. This movement
within the Negro population has re-
sulted in (1) a radical decline in the
absolute numbers and ratio of Negroes

V to whites in the traditional areas of

Negro majority——-the rural Black Belt
area*, (2) a progressive increase in the
size and proportion of Negroes in the
population of the larger southern
cities** and (3) a huge growth in the

 

‘In 1940 there were 180 counties of absolute
Negro majority with a Negro population of
2,642,808. In 1950 there were 170 counties of
absoute Negro majority with a Negro population of

about 2,250,000. (Source: Dun’: Review 6' Mad-'

em Indnmy, October 1957; Statirtical Abstract of
U.S., 1957.)

’“"In Memphis, Tenn., the Negro population in-
creased from 37.2% in 1950 to 51.2% in 1955;

 

 

in some 50,

 

non-Black —Belt and non-southern sec-
tors of the Negro population in the
U.S.***

The demographic changes in the loca-
tion and redistribution of the Negro
population in the U.S. as between the
North and South is revealed in the fol-
lowing facts:

In 1870 Negroes living in the South
were 92% of the total Negro popula-
tion, ’ '

In " 1910 there were still in the
South some 89% of all Negroes in the
U.S.

In 1940, of the Negroes in the U.S.
77% lived in the South.

In 1950 Negroes living in the South
constituted 68% of the Negro popula-
tion in the United States and one-
fourth of the total Southern popula-
tion.

The rate of migration sustained
through the decade 1940-1950 has con-
tinued through 1957 with all prospects
that it Will carry forward into 1960 at
least. This is to say that in 1960 the
population distribution of the Negro
people in the United States will be 57%
in the South and 43% in the non-South.*

II. Economic Status of Negroes in the
United States.

A. Occupational Status.

The Negro is the most proletarian of
the larger nationalities components of
the American nation. Both the class and
special “racist caste” features of the
oppression of the Negro people in the
United States are graphically revealed
in even a cursory delineation of the
salient facts concerning their economic
status in our present-day capitalist so-
ciety.

Negroes in the labor force are largely
bound to the lowest rungs of the occu-
pational ladder by a myriad system of
racist prejudices, racist laws, castelike
prohibitions and popular prejudices. As
for the small percentage of Negroes
who overcome the “caste” barriers to

 

in New Orleans from 29% in 1950 to 35% in
1955; in Washington, D. C. from 35.4% in 1950
to 42.5% in 1955. The percentages of Negroes in

the population of other southern Cities are: Atlanta, 2

Ga. 34.6%; Birmingham, Ala., 48.8%; Durham,
N. C., 38%; Charlotte, N. C., 35%; Jacksonville,
Fla., 35.2%; Baltimore, Md., 26.7%; St. Louis,
Mo., 20.3%; Houston, Texas, 22.4%; Kansas City,
Mo., 22%.

*"**Between 1950 and 1955 the Negro popula-
tion increased in Detroit from 16.4% to 21.4%; in
Chicago from 14.1% to 18.2%; in Cleveland from
10% to 22%; in the San Francisco-Oakland Bay area
of California from 6% to 13%; in Los Angeles from
5% to 12%; in New York City from 9.8% to
11.1%. In Philadelphia, Negroes are 16.2% 'of
the total population.

attain an occupational status at the

level of the skilled categories or profes-

sions, they still face economic discrimi-
nation which limits their earning oppor-
tuntiy to half that of white profes-
sionals or artisans in the same categories.

The average occupational status of’

Negroes has advanced very little rela-
tive to whites in the last ﬁfty years. “In
the North there was very little , change
from 1910 to 1940 and. a 4% increase
between 1940 an-d 1.950; in the South
therehwas a 6% decrease from 1910 to
1940 and a 4% increase between 1940
and 1950. Thus, in comparing 1950 with
1910, Negroes in the North had about
a 5% higher relative occupational posi-
tion and in the South about a 21% lower

position.” (Gary S. Becker, The Eco-

nomics of Discrimination, University of

Chicago Press, 1957, pp. 113-114.)
“Almost all the improvements in the

absolute occupational position of Ne-

groes were caused by forces changing

the position of whites as well” (Op. eit.,
p. 114.) Therefore, the gap, the diﬁer-
ential between Negroes and whites re-
mains basically unchanged.

In April 1958 there were 7,364,000
Negroes in the civilian labor force. Of
this total 5,582,000 Negroes were em-
ployed in non-agricultural industry.
Only 758,000 were employed in agricul-
ture. There were 1,024,000 Negroes who
were totally unemployed. One out of
seven Negro male workers was unem-
ployed in April 1958. Of the total num-
ber of employed persons in non-agricul-
tural industries, 24.8% of the Negro
men an-d 38.9% of the Negro women
worked only part time as against 14.4%
of the white men and 27.8% of the
white women.

As of April, 1957, 85.2% of the
employed Negro men and 95.2% of gain-
fully employed Negro women are en-
gaged in urban occupations. Tlhis co-m-
pares favorably with the prevailing
percentage distribution of employed

iwhite men and women, 89.8% and 96%

respectively.

,Whereas in 1940 some 41.2% of the
total of employed Negro men and 16%
of the employed Negro women were
working on farms (as farmers, farm
managers, farm laborers, and foremen),
by April, 1957 only 14.8% of the men
and 4.8% of the women were so en-
gaged. The corresponding percentage

for white men was 10.2% an-d for white‘ M

women 4.0%. Between April 1957 and
April 1958 an additional 72,000 Negro
men and women left agricultural em-
ployment (this represented a loss of
9.9% for Negro men and 3.2% for
Negro women from the farm popula-
tion).

midst of the struggles in the South. Our
Party is responsible for this. I think
that when we examine some of our roles
we should examine some of our mis-
takes. ‘

We know that the Negro people have
migrated out of the South. They are in
the East, in the North, in the West. In
New York City you have social clubs
based on states—-Georgia, Alabama, etc.
How many of us are members of these
clubs, and how many of us are acting
to rally these clubs around the strug-
gle in the South? One more thing: we
must hammer ‘out how to involve the
Negro in the North, in the East, in the
‘West, in seeing that his security lies in
ﬁghting for the rights of the Negro
people in the South.

The Struggle in {he Unions (Joe. N. Y.)

As one engaged in this discussion on
the right of self-determination in the
Black Belt area, as a trade union dele-
gate, I want to say that even though
the report might have some weaknesses
to some comrades, I believe that it was
overdue and that we should have this
kind of discussion to bring back a ﬁrm
position among our rank-and-ﬁle com-
rades active in trade union work and in
many organizations.

I believe that in our discussion on
the Black Belt we must note the changes
which have taken place. Even in Harry
Haywood’s book, which ﬁrst brought
forth this proposition of a nation, there

’ were many questions asked. The point
was made that in the period between the
two wars there was a shift into the
industrial areas, and the Negro people
in the industrial areas became a part
of the proletarian forces and took up
those struggles. Even though I agree
with the comrade from California that
the Negro is not fully integrated into
the industrial set-up because they still
have the most menial jobs, they are
there, and they are part of the Ameri-
can working class because they are in
textile and they are in steel.

I Our work in the unions should take
up the most basic questions affecting the
Negro workers, such as the program
outlined here. I know that in the early
-lO’s we talked of upgrading, of pro-
moting Negro .workers to higher posi-
tions. Some feel that we broke through.
Some feel that we did not.

There was a let-down in this struggle,
which came about when the Party was
engaged in ﬁghting the Smith Act. Some
of us were scattered and we could not
tackle this basic issue. Then after the
defeat of the McCarthyi.tes, we had
other problems in our Party-——-inner con-
fusion and that left the trade union

 

work in confusion because we were en-
gaged in these ﬁghts and could not ac-
complish anything.

With the Powell campaign, we
emerged in some unions, like Distribu-
tive. We mobilized our forces and put
them in the struggle against Tammany,
and we succeeded.

I believe that this program as out-
lined should be discussed in all our
groups-———in the trade union groups and
in the Negro affairs committees. Also,
we who function in the trade unions
should have constant guidance from the
National Negro Commission of our
Party. If we are able to put forth a
program based on the struggle within
our union, and the struggle against the

A‘ white supremacists, and the struggle for

Negro representation, and if we launch
a program within our union, we will be
able to ‘bring back those forces that
were separated from us.

Also I have not heard the question of
the ﬁght against white chauvinism
raised in a long time. Our Party is not
as strong on this question as before,
neither in the union, nor among the
Negro people and the Puerto Rican peo-
ple, becausc while we were busy with
the inner struggle the white suprema-
cists within our union mobilized and
launched a campaign against the Negro
and Puerto Rican workers. And there
is no struggle within to bring about the
close unity between these workers. I
believe that we should correct this when
we discuss our program within our
Party and in general.

Fundamental Aspects (Ben Davis, N. Y.)

Comrade Jackson has brought us
some excellent material for making a
serious beginning toward a Party—wide
discussion on this matter. We should
not underestimate its value, not only
from the point of view of the Party
itself in developing and defining a cor-
rect line on this question, but also in
our relation to the Negro people’s move-
ment and to the working class, and also
to the Puerto Rican people in New York
City, which is very important.

It is my opinion that the Negro peo-
ple’s movement has reached a point
where further development along posi-
tive, conscious lines requires that our
Party’s position should be clear and

"that it should be popularized among the

broadest sections of the Negro people
and their allies. Many liberal and mid-
dle class forces will not be able to deﬁne
their position until we have done this.
That is the biggest importance of de-
ﬁning our Party’s position.

I consider, too, that although we are

 

W...-u.,... v-...., ..........  .

Benjamin J. Davis. Jr.

just beginning to deﬁne this question
with respect to the Negro people and
the Negro movement, we have decided
basically the nature of our solution
some time ago, beginning with the 16th
National Convention, and then, in the
February and June National Committee
meetings and since. That is, that what-
ever the precise solution should be and
whatever this examination might bring
forth, it would have to be an examina-
tion based upon the science of Marxism-
Leninism. Some of us knew that some
changes would have to be made. We

knew that from life itself, and from our ~

tardiness in tackling this question theo-
retically. But it was not settled in our
Party ﬁnally and irrevocably until we
made clear that the yardstioks by which
we would ﬁnd those new positions were
Marxist-Leninist yardsticks.

Now, it is necessary to deﬁne our
position within two contexts. One is that
of the living, breathing, vital Negro
people’s movement of today. The second
is that of our own Party situation for
the last few years, for our Party has
been drenched with revisionism during
that period which almost wrecked it.
Moreover, we had to contend with the
ultra-left, which sought to place our
Party, on the Negro question, on an
ultra-left, dogmatic basis. This was
expressed in the Haywood! document,
which failed to see what is new inythe
world-—-a new period, ‘new changes, new
directions of movement by the Negro
people. ,

My opinion is that the document by
Comrade Jackson on the theoretical per-
spective is one that moves in a. sound
and correct direction. I think that there
is a point to some of the questions that
are being raised with respect to its
being more convincing, and maybe in-
cluding certain things which are very
necessary. I think it has weaknesses,
some of them serious. But I think that

N’  provides the framework within which
‘ we must move,

   

A ,..

 
 

. Now, with respect to the context of

V the Party situation, we have found
. among many of our Negro comrades

resistance to changing the slogan of
self-determination. These are healthy,
militant comrades, who are concerned

-. about our Party situation. They are

comrades who want a ﬁghting Commu-
nist Party, not a conservative party,

but one capable of inﬂuencing masses T

of people, of developing a mass line.

I think that is at the heart of some
of the questions here. But I, don’t think
it is possible to understand that if we
just classify these comrades as dogma-
tists and sectarians. We have to see
that our comrades have come through a
period marked by the revisionist line of
people like Gates, Clark, Starobin,
Stein, Charney and many more. Hence,
if we made the slightest concession in
the direction of change, many among
our Negro comrades in particular, but
also among our white comrades, felt
that we were giving up the whole thing,
the whole base and cutting edge of our
Party. And that is the thing our com-
rades want to maintain.

‘I think that once we realize how this
question has been downgraded in the
Party in the last period, how our Negro
cadre have failed to receive considera-
tion in many respects (and here I am
talking not about personal relations but
about how Negro cadre is connected
with the whole downgrading of this
question) and how this came about at
the time when our Party was strug-
gling to throw off the harmful and capi-
iulatory Gates theory current in our
ranks, thenwe. can begin to understand
some of the strong resistance of the
Negro comrades. '

This can be answered not by Polly-
anna statements, but only by replacing
the wrong, sectarian aspects of our old
position with a correct one. I think this
isthe direction of the resolution.

To me this question has three funda-
mental aspects: the national character
of the Negro question, the racial char-
acter of the Negro question, and the
class character of the Negro question.
To me the national character of the
Negro question is not suﬁiciently em-
phasized in this document, that is, the
movement of Negroes as a people in
this country. I think that one of the big
weaknesses of the Negro movement,
headed by’ many outstanding leaders, is
that they don't see fully this very im-
portant aspect of the question. I think
it is true that the Negro people has
moved as a people and is moving as a
people on a very high and rising level.

I

M;-, -_ v;,..;;; ._'—»_;v.:; ....i.....' m-.,;.-............

 

 

We have to point out and explain
patiently and persuasively, over and over
again, just how the national character
of the Negro question expresses itself
now under new conditions. ,

Secondly, as to the racial. character of
this question, here again, as Comrade
Jackson said, we have to retrieve what
has been good in our old position and
discard what has been bad in it. We
must make a clean breast of certain past
mistakes and weaknesses because we
want to influence people on a principled
basis. It seems to me that that the one
thing the re-establishment of our posi-
tion in 1946 accomplished, though it had
certain sectarian weaknesses, is that
for the first time (and Comrade Foster
made a signal contribution on this ques-
tion) we began to consider the racial
aspect of the Negro question.

Up to that time we considered it
heresy for any comrade to speak of the
Negro race. So this is something new
and we have to deal with it. It has
to do with a certain solidarity of the
Negro people as a people, and with the
peculiar and vicious type of oppression
which is imposed upon the Negroes in
the deep South and in other parts of the
country————an oppression which is differ-
ent from any other type of oppression
imposed upon and other minority group-
ing in the country. . l

The third thing is the class aspect of
the question. This expresses itself more
and more in the character of the Negro-
labor alliance. Obviously we cannot take
the same position in respect to the
Negro question which we took 20 years

ago because something has come into

being in the meantime-—the Negro-labor
alliance. It has its weaknesses, some of
them most serious. Some of them con-
found us as we try to develop the alli-
ance. But still it exists and it is some-

thing which we have been ﬁghting for ‘V W b

all these years.

We must consider this, in my judg-
ment, along with the national character
of the Negro question, because of the
growing power and potential of the Ne-
gro worker in the Negro movement-—
and the workers form a greater propor-
tion of the Negro people than perhaps
of . any other small people in‘ the world.

I would like to add to one thing that '
Comrade Paul said: thatcwe can make a ’

very serious mistake if we go-out of
here saying that the main thing wrong
with the Negro leadership is just their

anti-Communist attitude. This would

 transform the whole character of our
 role. It would be to make agreement

with or understanding of the role of the
Party or of the Soviet Union a sort of
test. This is not in my judgment the
issue. Now Comrade Jackson is ab-

. solutely correct in saying that we have

to ﬁnd ways and means of handling this

. V question and pointing out its diiiiculties,
but the way we have to place red-bait-.

ing today, as it is in the Negro move-
ment, is that red-baiting is inconsistent
with the mass unity and mass action of

. the Negro people. We must see that

shaping up in the movement today is a
division, at cleavage, and this cleavage

T is not around the Communist issue, but

is on the question of whether we shall
have pure legalism as the only method
of handling the Negro struggle, or
whether we shall have mass action. And
we have to find ways and means of
deﬁning within states as well as na-
tionally, how we can base ourselves on
those people’s forces which are seeking
mass action, while working with all
other forces. If you consider those
forces, you will ﬁnd that Randolph,

‘King and others, whatever their incor-

rect views on the Party, are more and
more the forces today identiﬁed with
mass action. Once we get that kind of
mass action among the Negro people
and their allies, red-baiting becomes a
diiﬁcult thing. For such action based on
unity and mass struggle leads to vic-
tories for Negro and_ civil rights.

Negro-White Unity in the South
(L, Virginia) '

I will not attempt to discuss the theo-
retical propositions themselves. I con-
sider them correct and sound. Rather, I
want to raise certain other ‘questions
which I think are important for the

South as well as other areas. i

‘First, even with migration of the
Negro people out of the South as well
as to urban areas within it, and even

a with the shifting balance of population,‘

the South still remains the main center
of the Negro freedom struggle within
our country. This has to be recognized
for it is so today and will be so for
quite some ‘time to come.

The second proposition that I would
like to state is that no matter- how well
organized, no matter ‘how militant
the Negro people are, they will not win
this ﬁght for freedom in our country by
themselves. They will have to join with
other democratic forces that exist with-

in theSouth and throughout the nation.

-An example of this is the elections in

in “   of Virginia over a number of

 

years. During the New Deal period,
when the labor movement in Virginia
and other southern states had relatively
close relations with the Negro people,

_we were able to elect a Negro City

Councilman in Richmond. This was done
by the combined vote of the labor move-
ment and the Negro people. Since that
time, however, Negro candidates have
run for oﬁice but have gotten only small
votes, even though they run year after
year, -election after election, for the
Negro vote alone is not enough to elect
them.

Therefore, the ‘question of forces and
allies becomes a paramount thing. And
these exist in the South, as well as
throughout the country. The southern
liberals, the labor forces, the church and
the ministers, the Jewish organizations
and others, constitute the democratic
forces of the Negro freedom movement.
These forces enter the battle against
white chauvinism with varying degrees
of understanding, and they ﬁght against
white supremacy from their own posi-
tions. I think it would be foolish to ex-
pect these democratic allies, who are at
times very unstable and at times will

do nothing, but who are potential allies -

who have a higher degree of understand-
ing at this point, to take an all-out
stand on segration as such.

The labor movement in the South is
not yet ready to ﬁght against all aspects
of segregation, but it is ready to ﬁght
against white supremacy. This is true of
the Jewish organizations and of many
liberals in the church, although the
church-is ahead of many of these groups
and is already ﬁghting against segrega-

tion. But whatever their understanding,’

we in the Party should strive to bring
them into the struggle against white
supremacy in one way or the other.

I think that the forces in the rest of
the nation who are engaged in the fight
against the Dixiecratsi cannot liberate
the South from the outside. Until the
forces in the South are strengthened
and developed, the fight cannot be fully
won. Therefore the big job of the Party
and of the democratic forces through-
out the nation is to help strengthen and
develop the internal democratic forces
within the South along the lines that I
have just mentioned.

Many national organizations have
components in the South. The labor
movement has many southern locals.
The National Council of Jewish Women,
the Anti-Defamation League, and so on,
all have strong chapters in Virginia
and other southern states.

To give an example of what needs to
be done, when the schools were closed
in Warren County, the town of Front

Royal was one place aifected. This town, I i

would certainly not be considered part
of the Black Belt, and the liberals
thought it would be easy to get people
there on the side of re-opening the
schools. However, the textile local,
which is large and insﬂuenti-al, took the
lead in the private school schemes of its
white supremacists. It adopted a weekly
check-oﬂ’ of its union members, which
was the main ﬁnancial support of the
s-egregationists’ private school move-
ment. It allowed its headquarters to be
used by the private school set-up, which
became known throughout the state and
‘the nation.

Now, do not we here in the Party
have airesponsibility to. develop a move-
ment within the Textile Workers Union

to ﬁght against such policies of its com— _

ponents in the South? The labor move-
ment itself, :a hundred and forty years
ago, fought and struggled for the public
school system, yet here we have a situa-
tion deeloping where union locals play a
reactionary role. Certainly, we in the
rest of the movement have to bring this
to the attention of the national forces
of this union.

Likewise, in the Jewish community,
the order has come from the national

oﬁice of the National Council of Jewish C

Women to go easy on controversial
questions and not to stir up the anti-
Semites by speaking out. This is like-
wise true of .the Anti-Defamation
League. It appears that these southern
organizations are the tails wagging
their national oﬂices. This situation also
requires the aid of our people in the
North and other parts of the country.

One thing that has to be done is for l

the labor movement and these other
organizations to adopt a concentration
policy for the South-—-to look upon the
South as an area where they will throw
in their main forces, their major funds,
and the bulk of their time. They must
not only adopt the South as their major
concentration, but within the South they
must single out a number of key states,
where they will make their biggest bat-
tle. In this connection, I agree with the
proposal of Comrade Charles that the
labor movement and others begin to sin-
gle out certain candidates in the South
for defeat, much as they do in other
areas. '

Considering the different degrees of
understanding among the democratic
forces in the South, we have to be very
skillful in ﬁnding those issues which
unite these. elements and bring them
into battle against the Tahnadges, the
Byrneses, and the-rest of that-. crowd.
One example, I think, will be «instruct-

ive of how this can be done. Several-r

 movement, particularly the Negro trade ,

years ago ‘ ha‘ a Negro Iran for the state
of Virginia.‘ The labor

unionists, formed a labor committee to

l , help in hiselection. As weak as we were,
0 A we were able to raise with this labor

campaign committee the importance of
ﬁghting for a minimum wage for Negro
and white workers as part of the can-
-didates, program.

The candidate responded by develop-
ing a program of struggle not only
around integration but around the mini-
mum wage. The question came up be-
fore astate conference of the AFL-CIO,
and the white trade unionists urged
that the labor movement support him.
He got 9,000 votes, the biggest vote for
a Negro candidate for this oﬂice so far
as I know, and he came within a breath
of winning the election. Since then the
votes have been much smaller, primarily
because the Negro candidates have

s adopted the same tone as the petty-

bourgeois white candidates. This, to me,
reveals that a Negro candidate appeal-
ing to the white masses on their inter-
ests can develop the forms that will

I unite and bring into struggle the labor

movement and other democratic forces
in the South. -

Now I would like to indicate brieﬂy
a few other areas of struggle. One is
school integration. The town of Arling-
ton has 3300 members in a “save the
school” movement. Norfolk has gotten
6,000 signatures of white families on
petitions to the Governor to re-open the
schools. The state PTA convention de-
feated ‘ the reactionary forces in what
was a tremendous effort on the part of
the Byrd machine to capture it. As a
result, the governor accused the teach-
ers of Virginia of being unpatriotic and
disloyal. This is the way the white
forces of Virginia are learning to strug-
gle against the Byrds, the Almonds and
the . Dixiectats generally.

A further question is the bombings,
to which I feel we must pay closer
attention. It will be diﬂicult to develop
a- program of struggle in the South
without grappling with this wave of
terror. People are afraid. There used to
be many letters to the newspapers but
because of fear, letters are becoming
scarcer and scarcer. The people have no
conﬁdence in the power of the southern
police forces, and it is therefore up to
the rest of the movement to ﬁght for a
federal law with stiffer penalties and
end the baloney about state responsi-
bility. 'llhe bombers can be found and
jailed, and some stiff penalties would

s, have a very good effect. Also we should
f smoke out the Demorcatic Party and

put allcandidates on record on this vital

issue. Withoutthis the movement in the
South will be weakened.

Then there is the question of the
unorganized. I remember from the past
a real democratic upsurge in the South,
with Negro women and trade unionists
marching with picket signs in the
streets and singing “Up with the
unions.” As a result of the campaign,
in towns like Farmville and South Bos-
ton hundreds of new workers were regis-
tered and voted, and it is no accident
that most of the new voters in Rich-
mond «and many other towns were Negro
trade unionists who by their compact
organization were more easily brought
into the voting strength of the Negro
liberation movement. A

As for the question of organizing the
unorganized, I’ve heard it thousands of
times in our movement. But it seems to
me that we have to become skillful in
applying it. We have to get down to the
business of how -to develop a movement
to accomplish it. Let us learn how it
was done in the thirties and apply some
of the skill they used. There will be no
organization of unorganized until the
labor movement forces the issue.

Last, on the Negro vote movement,
we have to tie this up with the issues
and with the development of strong
Negro and trade union candidates for
all types of office in the 1959 elections.

I think the Party needs to issue its
own material and raise the question of
cheap ' white labor as well as cheap
Negro labor. The Party has to develop
and distribute its own printed program,
leaﬂets, and so forth on a scale here-
tofore unknown in the South.

The Self-Determination Slogan
(T. D.. Mich.)

I just want to comment on one ideo-
logical aspect of the question. The thing
that bothers me about the material on
the changing of our theoretical ap-
proach is that it seems to hang in mid-
air, in that it is not tied to our previous
position in any way, from the point of

. view of reviewing it and pointing out

what was wrong or what was right
about it, and so developing from that
the present position which at this point,
at least, I agree with.

It seems to me that the -mistake that
was made on the question of the Negro
nation is that we failed to see it as a
developing process and took the position
that it was an already accomplished
fact, even to the full extent. Now it is
my opinion that had we seen the devel-
opment of Negro nationhood as a proc-
ess still in operation, we would have

been more ‘ prepared or would more

quickly have recognized that the ob-

jective conditions were changing and 
therefore ‘arresting this process of de- y
velopment, this trend toward nation- ‘A

hood.

In other words, it seems to me that in A 
the period since slavery-(even in slavery, L
you had the beginning of the various -  '

aspects of nationhood), the objective

conditions were propelling the Negro

people more and more in the direction
of nationhood. However, I think that in-
the period since World War II, prob.
ably before that, but particularly since
then—-this process has been arrested. I
think that this whole idea is developed
in the thesis. Therefore I agree with
the thesis on this basis. .
Now, on the question of self-deter-
mination. This is again in hindsight be-

-cause I, like a number of other com-_

rades, came into the Party on the basis

of this position, but also was probably

its foremost proponent. Yet on looking
back it seems to me that we might have
been a little more creative in the ap-
plication of this principle. ~

At least, as I understand it, it is pos- . A

sible to adhere to the right of self-dc»
termination and yet, if the objective
conditions under which a nation is de-
veloping do not permit, say, carrying
through to the extent of separation,
that it is still possible to be for . self-
determination and to exclude that pos-
sibility. A

My understanding is that this is the
situation of some of the nations in the
Soviet Union, which do not have the
right of separation unless they have
exterior borders. I think V that even at
the time that our policy was adopted
and applied, the objective conditions in
the U. S. made at least improbable this
possibility of secession. Even at that

time it could have been possible, had we . .

examined things a little closer—and I
understand the objective pressure that

the Party was faced with, and so on-—- p
to see that the objective conditions did .
exist that could lead one to that con '

clusion.

Therefore I am not so sure that it is
correct to drop the slogan of ‘self-deter»

mination as such, because it seems to

me that objective conditions are propel-
ling..the Negro people into a different
solution. And this does not appear to
me to be a conscious selection. Rather,
it is a result of developments that are

propelling in this direction. I think that

if we presented it in this way, but more

rounded and more precisely formulated, _ I
we would be much closer to being con-V, L V ,

_ . urbanization,
T claiming that this was one of the things

i  done this way.

 A number of comrades have dealt

{with the question of urbanization. I did
not get the impression from the docu-

ment that, in presenting the problem of
Comrade Jackson was

which caused the Negro people to cease
being a nation. My understanding is
that the urbanization question had to do
with the character and class composi-
tion of the Negro people themselves, and
that because of the change from~ a ma-
jority of small farmers to a working
classmajority, the program of the Party
should not place the Negro question as
an agrarian question, because it would
not be in accordance with reality.

_ This is the way I understood it. I did
not understand it as being the ingredi-
ent which prevented the Negro people

ifromv being a nation. Now, on the ques-

tion "of, Proposition IV, I don’t think it

is enough to assert that allof the exist-
ing rights maintained for the rest of

the population should. also be enjoyed by
the Negro people. I think more is in-
volved.

It reminds me of a situation where
you have two runners. On the back of
one is a 200 pound sack, then "after they
run awhile you remove the sack. Sure,
theyare equal, but unless you do some-
thing to bring him up even with the

T other guy you have not ‘completed the

process. Similarly, when we speak of
equality we have to regard it as includ-
ing the extra necessary ingredients to
bring the Negro people up--in other
words, to overcome the effects of the
oppression that has existed, and not just
to remove that oppression.

it Negro Liberation and lrnperiailism

(Homer Chase, New England)

‘The “Theoretical Aspects” should be
based on three main factors in. the ob-
jective situation: the strength of the
socialist camp; the surge of the national

liberation movements; and the rapid rise’

of American imperialism in relation to
the rest of the capitalist world. It is the
task of the Marxist-Leninists in the

TU. S. to help unite the liberation move-

ment with similar movements in South
America, Africa, Asia. They have .a
common enemy, headed by American im-
perialism, andneed common action for
success. H

Inmy opinion, the last paragraph of
“Program re Black Belt” should be

-rewritten to express this more clearly

and should be the base for the “Theo-
retical Aspects.” Historical development
in the U. S. by itself does not explain
the present status of Negro people.
The historical development which led
to American imperialism and its pres-
ent savage oppression of the Negro
people is the key to the other questions,
including status, forms of struggle,
main enemy, main immediate issues, etc.

Propositions VI and VII are com-
pletely unsatisfactory on white chau-
vinism. The Marxist approach on the
self-interest of the white worker in the
ﬁght against white chauvinism is simply
absent as it is in the labor document.
If we can’t do better, let us include
Marx’s “Labor in the white skin.”

The document should recognize, and
identify as revisionist, arguments that
the Negro question is not a national
question. It should tie in the struggle to
re-establish and develop our program on
the Negro question with the present
struggle to save our Party from the
revisionists’ line.

I voted for the document as a line
for discussion despite the above. It
seemed to me of first importance that
we get away from the “self-determina-
tion?’ approach. This sectarian phrase-
ology is the other side of thecoin from
an opportunist failure to consistently
lead struggles as a part of the world-
wide battle against American imperial-
ism.

The National Character of the Negro V’
People's Movement (Charles. South) 

In my view the document is a sound
one.- Notwithstanding the various points

that have been brought out in the dis-.

cussion which could strengthen it, many
of my observations would represent an
elaboration of the basic propositions
already stated.

I want to address my remarks to

some of the significant points of view V‘

which have come out of the discussion.
One comrade mentioned that, in his
view, the deﬁnition set forward in
Proposition I was in error-—that the
Negro people were not a historically
determined part of the American na-
tion. In my opinion, the Negro people's

development is a historical factor. ..D'.ia-_

lectical and. historical materialism de-
clare that all phenomena are historically
determined, and that would include the
Negro people.

We should view each thing within its
historical context. A man exists in
dialectical unity with his environment.
He is a product of his environment and
he acts upon his environment. This is no
less true of the Negro people. Are the
Negro people part of the A‘merican na-
tion? What is the American nation?

Marx-ism says that nations are his-.

torically evolved, stable communities

having a common language, economic

life and psychological make-up, -mani-

fested in a community of culture. This
goes for the American nation or any
other nation. This isthe general ‘deﬁni-
tion of a nation. Well, were the Negro

people a -part of this development?

When the American nation estab-
lished its state power in the struggle
against British colonialism, the Negro
people were 20% of the population.
They had already been here 160 years
then, and they had the beginnings of a
literature in the writings of Phylis

W-heatley and Benjamin Banneker. Cer-V‘

tainly the Negro people have been part
of this development of the amalgam of
people who have ma-de up the American
nation. '

Are they racially distinct? The major
stock of the American nation is Can.-
casian, coming from Europe-—the Brit-
ish Isles, Eastern Europe and so forth.
The Negmpeople were the main racial
stock that was different. They came
from Africa, so that made them a
racially distinct part of the American
nation.

They are a racially distinct, historic-
ally determined people, a component
part of the U.S. In my view, that is a

‘sound definition oflthe Negro people.

One comrade pointed out that he

‘ thought that the special national char-

acter of the Negro people's movement
had been de-emphasized instead of being
properly placed. Well, Proposition I
quotes from the 16th Convention Reso-
lution and says in part: “The struggles
of the Negro people and the resultant
signiﬁcant advance inspired Negro
Americans with a new quality of self-
conﬁdence. A profound spirit of na-
tional consciousness and pride in their

racial identiﬁcation permeates the Ne-

gro people in the U.S today. It ﬁres
their determination to buildiever closer
their unity in order to wage the strug-
gle even more militantly to break down
all -barriersto their exercise of any and
all political, economic and social rights
enjoyed by any other citizens.”

The Negro people’s national charac-
ter has been described as a movement
of a people in their struggle for emanci-
pation. In my opinion, that is precisely
what the proposition puts forward. Now
certainly this could be elaborated on
and deepened, and I am all for that.
But I think it has been established, and
this is not de-emphasis.

Then it is said by some comrades that
this national character, as it expresses
itself, is something new. But it is not
new. The Negro people have been mov-
ing as -a people for a long time. What

was the Negro people’s convention move-
ment in 1830, in the struggle against
slavery, if _it was not the movement of
a people? Likewise the Garvey move-
ment was a high point of the Negro
people moving as a people at the end
of World War_ I, when this movement
began to cultivate an intelligentsia that
expressed a certain national character.
Or consider the foundations of certain
national organizations of the Negro
people such as the Association for the
Study of Negro Life’ and History, and
the works of Drs. DuBois and Woodson
and Alain Locke. This was an expres-
sion of a people who were moving as
a people. And now we have Montgomery
and Tallahassee, a continuation of this
expression of movement as a people——of
their special national character.

But what is new in this? It is not
the movement of the Negro people for
struggle that is new. It is rather the
imprint of the Negro proletariat in this
Negro movement that is new. In other
words, Montgomery and Tallahassee
represent the impact and the imprint
of the Negro proletariat ‘bringing its
trade union experience into the Negro
community in the struggle for freedom.

‘These two cities represent, historically
significant ﬂashes, illuminating the im-
print of the Negro proletariat -on
the strategy and tactics of the Negro
liberation struggle in the South. But
the basis of this is urbanization, and
that is the point which the document
makes. The proletarianization of the
Negro people takes place within the
framework of its urbanization.

First they are urbanized, they are
torn from the soil, they ﬁnd their place
in the urban communities all over the

country, and then within this they are

taken into industrylas proletarians. In
my view, the proposition does not de-
emphasize that, though certainly it
could be elaborated. The section in
which we deal with the role of Negro
Marxists in ﬁghting for workin-g-class
ascendancy in the Negro people’s move-
ment as a means of unifying that move-
ment further certainly points up that
correct outlook in the resolution.

I think Comrade Savis made a signi-
ﬁcant contribution in singling out the
factors which make for the special
oppression of the Negro people, which
explain why the Negro people is the
most oppressed. He outlines this as a
special oppression‘ which is racial and
national and class in character; I be-
l.ieve that is correct. But those are sub-
jective factors. The main objective fac-
tor in Negro oppression is American

imperialism. This is the oppressor.

I feel that the resolution treats of
this adequately. We see in Proposition
V the statement; “The fact that the
scene of the American Negro people's
struggle unfolds within the bosom of
American imperialism,‘ and in direct
and intimate association with the _work-
ing class and popular struggles and is
directed against the common class op-
pressor, feeds into the general stream
of the historic working class cause of
our time a powerful current which
raises the torrential power of the whole.
cause of social advance for the people

of our‘ country.” That expresses what

makes it special--that and the descrip-
tive treatment *of the institutionalized
forms of white chauvinism in the form
of American imperialism’s jim-crow
system, which I believe further high-
lights the special -character of the op-
pression of the Negro people.

Now, how did our Party arrive at the
conclusion that self-determination was
the solution? I think we have to ex-
amine the period in which Marxist
theory was first applied to the Negro
question in the U.S., the period of
about 1920-1928. The presentation of
self-determination as a solution arose in
relation to the theory of the general

crisis of capitalism and the effect of

this general crisis on the tendency of
capitalist stabilization.

Well, what would this mean? It
would mean‘ precisely that the Negro
people as a land-based peasantry in the
Black Belt, faced with economic crisis,
who had developed many of the features
of nationhood, would be faced with in-
tense poverty. But it also suggested
that capitalism would no longer tear
away at this Black Belt region, that
what was there would more or less stay
there, that the tendency of capitalist
stabilization would guarantee that this
existing social formation would not un-
dergo any fundamental changes in this
coming period.
outlook for the

Consequently, the

land—bound Negro. people in the Black M

Belt, given a long-continued’ land occu-
pancy, a common territory, the possi-
bility for developing a common economic
life in the Black Belt (and this was the
weakest feature of Negro nation-like
development) would therefore be to de-
velop all the organized basis for libera-
tion movements upon the soil of the
Black Belt and stabilize its common ter-
ritory. Therefore, the solution for its
oppression would be to guarantee that
this community would have the right to
self-determination.

of the criticism and certain of the dis-

Lenin and Stalin on the national ques-

That, in fact, explains why there is
no discrepancy between word and
deed in the activities of this group,
and why the teachings of Marx com-
pletely retain their living, revolution-
ary force. . . .” (Works, Vol. 4,«pp.
' 317-318) -

Let me repeat a -passage from my
remarks. in opening .this discussion:
“Let us be mindful of the function and
role of theory. Theory is not for the
purpose of ' shielding or denying reality,
or of arresting the development of
phenomena. ‘Phenomena are richer than
any law,’ said Lenin. Theory explains
and illuminates the forces at work in a
given phenomenon, and reveals its re-
lationship to surrounding phenomena.
It distinguishes the new and vital from
the old and dying. It provides a guide
to action. Correct theory is the midwife
of the possible and reveals the most
favorable course for its -development.

“The question is not how to compress
the phenomena of the Negro people’s
movement in the United States into the
conﬁnes of a given Marxist category,
but how to effectively use the science of
Marxism-Leninism to serve the cause of
Negro equality and freedom.”

I am for the fullest, most unencum-
bered discussion of these documents
throughout our Party to enrich, improve
and deepen them, to put them in greater
balance, and above all to stimulate the
membership of our Party to create a
literature around what I submit is their
basically correct thesis, to equip us to
unfold our full role in the service and
leadership of the Negro people's move-
ment. I am for the commencement of a
vigorous, creative discussion within the
Party on these documents, I am for a
productive discussion in which leader-
ship takes the full responsibility "in pro-
viding a lead. and line,

that We are not at the b

sideration, of these questions.‘ They have ,

been under thoughtful consideration I fo" 1‘

a number of years. Many comrades have
contributed importantly to the summa-”
tion of some of this discussion, thought .;

and study -as reflected in these docu-

ments. To cite only a few such land- “
marsk I recall a report by comrade Ben» ‘V V

Davis, Negro People on the March,
which‘ was published as a pamphlet in
1956. I recall articles “in Political Af-
fairs under the pen names of Braddock,
Hastings, Swift, Frazier, Mann and
others. There were the articles by Com-
rades Foster and A Claude Lightfoot
There was our Southern People's Com-
mon Program in 1953. I recall an im-
portant statistical and analytical study
of the 1950 ‘census by Comrade James

Allen in, 91954 and the conclusions and s

questions from it that he already pro-
jected then. Numerous documents were
produced in the pre-convention discus-
sion. In fact, a special committee had
been composed in the course of the pre-
convention‘. discussion to conduct a pro-
found study into this question. ‘

I recall a resolution adopted at theft

16th National Convention dealing with
the Negro question. Incidentally, this
resolution, which was designed for
broad popular consumption andwnot
merely. to set the basis and the guide
line for -discussion in the Party, did pre-
cisely what one speaker here urged
upon the resolution-—-that is, to start
with a dramatic presentation of the
status of the Negro people's movement
today. I am certainly in favor, in any
public presentation growing -out of
these documents, of prefacing it with
such a presentation of the role which
the ‘Negro people are playing in the
present life of our country. The main
thing, however, is the substance and

essence of the propositions being un-I

folded. The form and presentation in
the ﬁnal resolution has to serve that
context, and in no way should‘ divert
from it.

Comrades, there have been many im-
portant questions posed in this discus-
sion which should serve as topics for
subsequent elaboration by all of us for
the development of " a body of all-sided

literature on this question. But let- us.

hear in mind what a resolution is. As
distinct from a book, or from a large
study and analysis of the total prob-
lem, a resolution is a brief presentation
of the highlights of the question and a
guide for dealing with it. This is what
we sought to present in this resolution.

by JAMES S. ALLEN

(‘The following is a memorandum sub-
mitted to the National Committee by

Comrade Allen in September 1954. We‘

print it now because of the basic data
it provides for the present discussion.——
Ed.) ‘
The attached summary tables show
the historic trends in the population
movement and land tenure in the Black

(Belt. For purposes of historical com-

parison, the 1930 continuous area of
Negro majority (Black Belt), as deﬁned
in J. S. Allen, The Negro Question in
the United States (1936), and further

elaborated in his discussion articles in

Political Affairs (1946), is projected to
1950. Thus, the -population movement
can be traced over the period 1860-1950.
Unfortunately, no similar continuous
movement can be traced for land tenure
in the Census -statistics. But the com-
parisons over the period 1930-1950 are
signiﬁcant. (Refer to the maps in
Allen’s book for the boundaries of Black
Belt and ‘Border Territory.)

Population

As shown in Table 1, the Black Belt
has tended to contract since 1900. The
greatest contractions have occurred dur-
ing the war periods=-—-the decade of
1910-1920 and the -decade of 1940-1950,
when Negro migrations from the South
into the industrial centers of the North
were the greatest. On the basis of the
statistics in Tables 1 and 2, it can be
reliably estimated that there was a net
movement of one million Negroes from
the Black Belt to the North and West
during the decade 1940-1950. Table 1
also shows that in the Border Territory
(the area on the periphery of the Black
Belt), the decline in proportion of Ne-‘
groes to the total population parallels
the decline in the Black Belt, although
no similar net outward migration is in-
dicated. Even during the crisis decade
of 1930-1940, the Black Belt continued
to contract, although at a slower pace
than during the war decades.

The general historic tendencypis for
the contraction of the Black Belt, which
was accelerated -during the two recent

  Appendix

 

periods of great industrial expansion in
the -country as a whole, and was some-
what slowed down (although not re-
versed) during the period of great eco-
nomic crisis.

In fact, by 1950 this tendency had
already led to the disappearance of a
single, continuous area of Negro major-
ity in the South. This is shown in Table
3, which presents a new attempt, on the
basis of the 1950 population statistics,
to differentiate three separate areas. In
each case, the -core of the area is the
counties in which Negroes form a ma-
jority of the population. It will be seen
that in these separate majority counties
taken as a whole the Negroes are 61%
of the total population. But to form
these separate counties into continuous
areas it is necessary to add connecting
counties, in which the Negroes comprise
less than half the population, and also
the metropolitan areas (often located in
the midst of the majority counties),
where the Negroes are only 33% of the
population. Even then, the results as
given in the table show that in each of
these three areas Negroes form less
than half the population. It is, of course,
possible to recalculate the areas anew so
that _each one will have a majority of
Negroes, but only by reducing the size
of the areas considerably, and possibly
by increasing the number of separate
areas.

Therefore, it is now no longer pos-
sible to speak of a continuous area of
Negro majority in the South, but only
of Negro majority areas.

At the same time it should be noted
that while the proportion of Negroes in
the populationhas -decreased in the tra-
ditional Black Belt area, the total Negro
population in this area remained more
or less static at 4.5 to 5 million during
the same period, although, for -some
decades, much below the natural in-
crease of population for the Negro
people in the U.S. as a whole. In other
words, while the traditional area of
Negro majority has contracted and is
no longer continuous, it still remains
the area most densely populated by
Negroes in the United States, especially
significant because of its speciﬁc char-
acteristics of semi-feudal reinnants.

changes in the Black Belt

Table 2 summarizes still another im-
portant aspect of the Negro population
movement. Since 1860, the proportion of
the total Negro U.S. population living
in the Black Belt has declined steadily,
while the proportion living in the non-
South (all states outside the 12 states

through which the Black Belt runs) has .

increased steadily. The Border Territory
during this entire period becomes only
slightly more important, .-"while other
Southern areas decline. in importance.
This tendency for the redistribution of
the Negro population as between the
Black Belt and the North was greatly
accelerated during the decade 1940-1950,
when the most extensive shift took
place. By 1950, for the ﬁrst time, the
number of Negroes living in areas out-
side the 12 Black Belt state-s exceeded
the Negro population of the Black Belt
(by 1,000,000); 38% of the U.S. Negro
population now lived in the non-uSo»uth,
while only 32% lived in the Black Belt.
The remaining 30% were scattered
throughout the Border Territory and
other sections of the non-plantation
South.

Land Tenure

Between 1930 and 1950, the number of
Negro farm operators in the Black Belt
declined by one-third (as compared with
a decline of 4% for whites). Landown-
ership among Negroes
13% (as compared with 33% for
whites), with the result‘ that Negro
tenants and -croppers -decrease-d by" 44%,
or from 494,000 to 279,000. As can be
calculated from ‘Tenure Table 2, the
decline among Negro tenants was about
the sa.me asthe decline for Negro crop-
pers. While the decline for White ten-
ants and croppers was also high (39%),
they play less of a role in the Black
Belt economy, and, furthermore, this
decline was almost met by the increase
in white landownership. On the other
hand, the in-crease in Negro landowner-
ship offsets only a small part of the
decrease of Negro tenancy and share-.
cropping. Nor do the figures on farm
wage-labor (not given in table) indicate
any shift from tenancy and cropping to
farm wage-labor. (According to the

General

Of course, it is necessary to study
these data further, and particularly the
underlying causes of the population
movements and the tenure changes. It
is also necessary to consider basically
the extent and nature of Southern in-
dustrialization, the composition of the
Southern working class, and the extent
of urbanization among the Negro people
in the Black Belt and in the South as a
whole. Social, labor and political devel-
opments during recent years also affect
program. Keeping these factors in mind,
an-d on the basis of the data here sub-
mitted, it would seem necessary to re-
consider fundamentally the program-
matic slogan of self-determination. In
my opinion, it is no longerpossible to
speak of the "right of self-.determina-
tion for the Negro nation in the Black
Belt.” The long-range, historic tendency
is for the dissipation of the Black Belt,
and the wider distribution of the Negro
population. ‘This, and the other factors
mentioned, make for integration rather
than separate development, and the
slogan of self-determination emphasizes
the latter than the former.

A program must be developed in ac-
cordance with the continuing historic
trend, in which the national character
of the Negro question must remain
basic, and which must take into account
the special situation which persists in

the South. The slogan of complete Negro ,

representation (not self-government,
which presupposes a national state, al-
though on a local scale Negro represen-
tation would in eﬁect mean self-gov-
ernment in many Black Belt localities)

would be particularly suitable to the

South, as well as pertaining nationally. _

Other special programs and demands, as
raised in the Program for the South,
should be developed further to meet the
special requirements there. The entire
question needs to be reexamined theo-
retically, to deﬁne the «characteristics of
the Negro question as a national ques-
tion, -in the light of historic trends and
current development.
(September 10, 1954)

Between 1940 and 1950 some 608,000
Negro men and 125,000 Negro women
left farm employment. This represents
a decline of slightly more than 50% in

the number of Negroes engaged in

farming or working on farms within a
decade, and constitutes by far the big-
gest occupational shift in the recent
history of the Negro people. It has re-
sulted in a basic alteration in the class
structure of the Negro nationality. It

"emphasizes the fundamental alteration

in the class base of the Negro people
from “peasant” to ,“proletarian.”
Today, the largest strata of employed
Negro men and women combined are
found in the class of industrial workers,

. the census category of “operatives and

kindred Workers.” ‘They represent a
ratio to the total Negro population con-
siderably higher than that held by white
industrial workers to the total number
of employed white men and women.

There are 1,032,000 Negro men and
387,000 Negro women -semi-skilled in-
dustrial workers (i.e., operatives and
kindred workers). That is 25.2% of the
total of employed Negro men and 15.1%
of the total of employed Negro women.
The corresponding percentage for
white men is 19.5 and for white women
16.6%.

As important as the rapid growth of
the Negro industrial workers category
is for the class composition of the
Negro people and the international com-
position of ‘the working class, it does
not begin to counterbalance the massive
economic discrimination manifested in
the occupational differential, the im-
balance in distribution of jobs as be-

-tween Negroes and whites. Note well

the following imbalance between Negro
and white in therhierarchy of the em-
ployment categories:

In the middle class occupation groups,
the census categories of “professional,
technical, and kindred workers: man-
agers, officials and proprietors except
farm,” the percentage distribution of
employed persons by color and sex is as
follows:

Negro men 4.0 % White men 24.2 %
Negro women . 6.9 % White women 1 8.2 
In the ’LUlLtt€ collar, skzlled and serm-

I . skilled occupational groups, the census

categories of “clerical and kindred
workers,‘ sales workers, craftsmen, fore-
men, and kindred workers,” the per-

centages of the total of employed Negro

and white in this stratum is as follows:

54.2%
45.0%
The bottom rungs of the occupational
ladder still remain the special reserva-
tion of the Negro toilers.
In the classiﬁcations of “private
household workers” plus “service work-

4

White men
White women

Negro men 1 4.8 %
Nfegro women 1 0.2 %

ers, except private household” the job
distribution between Negro and white in
terms of percentages of their respective
employment totals are as follows:

Negro men 14.8 % White men 5.6 %
Negro women 61.7% White women 17.9%

In the unskilled employment category
of “Laborers, except farm and mine,”
the percentages of the total of the em-

ployed are :
Negro men 25.5 % White men 6.3 %
Negro women 1 .2 % White women 0.3 %

In the total labor force there are pro-
portionately more Negroes than whites.
Among whites, 57.1% of all persons 14
years of age and over are in the labor
force (82.8% male and 33.7% female).
The comparable ﬁgures for Negroes are
61.9% (81.8% male and 44.4% female.)

Negroes who fall in the occupational
and income category of small capitalists
constitute less than a percentage point
of the Negro population. They are the
heads of some 226 (relatively small) in-
surance companies with combined assets
of about $162 million, and an income of
less than $70 million a year. (See E. M.
Lancaster, U. S. Department of Com-
merce, Irtsurance Compames Owned by
Negroes.)

In July of 1957, 58 Negro insurance
companies employed 9200 Negroes.
Their total assets amounted to about
$200 million. These Negro companies

have $1.3 billion of insurance  force.
Total insurance in force held by Ne-
groes is approximately $15 billion.

Negroes own and operate some 14 .

small banks whose combined assets do
not exceed $37 million. They operate
other business enterprises in the ser-
vices category — newspapers, funeral
parlors, hotels, restaurants, beauty
products companies. A few are home
builders and real estate dealers.

They too are victimized by big busi-
ness and race discrimination and
limited to the bare fringe of the capi-
talist market. Their signiﬁcance is
small in terms of depicting the economic
status of the Negroes, although they
are of considerable political and theo-
retical interest. We will not now deal
further with this tiny economic cate-
gory. v

B. Income Status

The income of the average employed
Negro reﬂects the fact that he is largely
limited in the type of work he can get
to do. He is confined primarily to the
four lowest-paid occupational groups,
i.e., laborer, farmer, private household
and service worker, and factory “opera-
tive.” On to-p of this occupational caste
system of discrimination is imposed a
racist pattern of wage and job classi-
ﬁcation differentials within each occu-
pational category. This economic rob-
bery of the Negro working people is
summarized in the following comparison
(“Average (Median) Annual Wage or
Salary Income of Year-Round Full-
Time Workers by Color and Sex ‘for
1955,” Economic Forces in the U.S.A.
U.S. Government Printing Oﬁice, 1957,

p. 61) _:

1955 '

White men $4,458 White women $2,870
Negro men 2.8?) 1 Negro women 1 ,637

In 1956, Negro men and women com-
bined had a median income of only
$1,830 as compared to $3,506 for white
men and women. (Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, May 1958.)

The average income for Negro work-
ers by 1956 was only 52% of the aver-
age for white workers. (It was less
than 40% in 1939). Over the past
decade the gap has narrowed at a rate
of less than 1% a year!

—One half of the families with incomes
under $3,000 were headed by farmers,
laborers, and private household work-

ployed Negro men and 66.5% of the
working Negro women are to be found
in these three lowest occupational
groups. These are the background data

for. the fact that the median income of
Negro families for the country as a
whole (for 1956)‘ was $2,600 or about
48% below that of’ medianwhite family

income.

Among Negro families, 81% have a
net income of less than $4,000 as

"against 48% of white families. In 1950,
54.3% of Negro persons had incomes
under $2,000, 23.5% were in the $2-3,000
bracket, and 17.8% were in the $3-5,000
bracket. Only 5.4% had incomes of
$5,000 or more. ’

Out of a" national total of 3,994,000
Negro families approximately 545,000
rural farm families had a median
money income in 1956 of only $1,104.
An,‘ additional 730,000 rural non-fa/rm
Negro families had an average income
of $2,200. Urban Negro family income
was almost a thousand dollars higher,
i.e. $3,250. The Negro farm family is
1% times worse off than the White
farm familygand the white city family is
5 times better off than the Negro farm
family. (2,719,00‘0 out of the total of
3,994,000 Negro families in the U.S.,
or approximately 65%, live in the
cities.)

Discrimination against Negroes in
educational and job-training opportuni-
ties bears a close relationship to eco-
nomic discrimination and contributes
to deriving Negroes of their just share
of the national income. There is a pro-
gressively increasing relatilonshipv be-
tween education and earnings. This is
seen in the fact that in 1956 the aver-
age income for families headed by an
elementary school graduate was $4,200,
by a high school graduate $5,500, and
by a college graduate $7,600. Further-
more, 25-30% of all families in income

brackets over $3,000 were headed by ,

high school graduates. One half of all

persons in the $10,000 bracket were col-

lege graduates and 77% of those in the ‘

$25,000 bracket,

Whereas it is apparent from the
above that education and training is
importantly a prerequisite for securing
employment in the higher income occu-
pational brackets, the possession of the
requisite educational background is not
of itself a passport away from the pale
of discrimination. On the contrary, “the
income differential between whites and
Negroes tends to ‘be greater for persons
with more, rather thanless education.”
(Current Population Reports, Series
P60, No. 27, P. 10)

Economic dis-crimination holds fast on
all educational levels. For example, in
1956, income among urban White men
who ﬁnished‘ high school was 19%
higher than among those who only com-
pleted elementary school. Among urban

Negro men, on the other hand, income
was only 7% higher than among those
who did not enter high school. Note
Table 3. . ,

“In the South income of white per-
sons exceeded that of Negroes by 48%
for grammar school graduates, 73 per
cent for high school graduates, and 85,
percent for college graduates.” (Se-)
lected Materials on the Economy of the
South, Senate Report No. 2830, 84th
Congress, 2d Session, 12. 32.)

C. Housing Status

As the Negro people are doubly ex-
ploited as working ‘people conﬁned to
the meanest jobs at the lowest pay, just
so they are robbed as consumers, home
buyers and tenants. No sector of capital
enriches. itself more handsomely from,
and contributes more ruthlessly to, the
maintenance of the all-sided national
oppression of the Negro people than do

the real estate magnates and their land-

lord leeches. They seize the lion's share

of the Negro consumers’ meager in-
come, exacting a high racist premium
as a condition for permitting the Negro
to satisfy his basic human need for
shelter. What is the extent of discrimini-
nation in housing?

“It is estimated that some 40 million
dwelling units in the U.S. are currently
‘out of bounds’ for purchase, rental or
occupancy by non-whites [94.5% of
whom are Negroes] by virtue of segre-

gation in housing. . . . Of the 3,293,406

dwelling units for non—whites, 1,082,128
needed major repairs and nearly
2,000,000 had no running water.” (The
Housing S2‘t.zmtz'on——-1950, p. 40, as cited
by Leo J. L-inder in Lawyers Guild Re-
viezcv, Vol. XVIII, No. 1, 1958, p. 2).

Twenty-four percent of urban Ne-
gro homes had no running water,
private toilet or bath as compared to
10% for all units. The proportion of
Negroes living in dilapidated housing is
ﬁve times that of whites. In rural non-
farm areas 3/4 of all Negro housing
was without running water as against
1/4 for whites.

Further, in 1950 the U.S. Housing &
Home Finance Agency reported that
better than 27% of the housing occupied
by Negroes was sub-standard and dilapi-
dated. This was 6 times the sub-stand-
ard housing occupied by whites.

Overcrowding of land and buildings
characterizes the areas demarcated for
Negro occupancy. For example, a single ‘
block in Harlem held a population of‘-5

   

   

3,871. persons. In an area of »Chicago’s
South Side, Negroes lived 90,000 to the
square mile as compared with the most
crowded white neighborhood of 20,000
to the square mile. (“Non-White Hous-
ing,” House & Home, April, 1953, p.
44). i

In the area of housing discrimination
and segregation, the situation continues
to worsen. Charles Abrams (Forbidden
Nei,z7h.bors, 1955, p. 243) has estimated
that of the 9,000,000 new homes built
between 1935 and 1950 less than 1%
were open to Negroes and other non-
whites and that only 50,000 out of some
3 million dwellings insured by FHA
were available to non-whites. [Yet in
the 14 largest metropolitan areas where
3/3 of the total population lives, the
Negro population increased 16 times as
fast as the white over the past 15
years] ‘

As a consequence of the systematic
exclusion of Negroes from access to’
“good" housing and their enforced re-
striction to the areas of substandard
housing, there is continuing to develop
within the larger cities of the country
hard segregated residential areas of
“white” suburban zones and “Negro” in-
city zones. For example, “in Chicago,
79% of all Negroes in 1950 lived in
areas in which at least 75% of the
residents were Negroes; on the other

hand, 84% of the non-Negroes resided’

in areas in which fewer than 1% of the
residents were Negro.” (See M. Grod-
zines. Sc-.iw'ati.fic Anzc-ricam. October,
1957, p. 40).

 
 

The real estate interests “tithe proﬁt
from overcrowding’ of Negroes on. the
one hand and the saleability of ‘exclu-
siveness’ to whites on the other

staunchly support segregated housing.‘

“Weakness in any part of the system
of segregation tends to be felt through-
out the system; but it is equally true
that one ﬁrm segment re-enforces all
the others. Thus continued segregation
in housing affects the whole patterns . . .
it affects the whole framework of atti-
tudes that inﬂuence the interaction of
white and Negro people.” (Yinger
and Simpson, “Can Segregation Sur--
vive in an Industrial Society?”, The
Antioclz Review, Spring‘ 1953, P. 23.)

THE CLASS FORCES IN THE
NEGRO PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT

I. Sitting Class Relations

U.S. capitalism’s more “efficient” and
thoroughgoing super—exploitation of its
“internal colonial caste” of Negro masses
has transformed the Negro people from
primarily an exploited peasantry into a
most productive base of super-profit——
into basically an exploited and oppressed
working people. It is this working class
stratum of the Negro people—dominant
for the people as a whole and constantly
increasing in the South as well-which
will progressively stamp the Negro peo-
ple's freedom movement with its own
image. The high proportion of the Ne-
gro people who are working people
means that the Negro freedom move-

 

  

  

 

 

i~iment”will increasingly reflect in its pro-

gram, ‘policies, leadership, alliances, im-
mediate and long-range goals the inﬂu-
ence and will of the working class. This
is a feature in the prospects for de-
velopment of the Negro liberation move-
ment which is quite different from that

,usually associated with national move-

ments of colonial economies wherein the
weight of the petty bourgeois peasant
class groupings is very heavy if not
decisive. The proportionate numerical
strength of the class forces within the
Negro movement is decisively on the
side of the workers. This circumstance
favors that ultimate dominance of the
policies of the working class and the
leadership of the working class in the
Negro people’s movement which is indis-
pensable for the triumph‘ of the cause
of Negro liberation over all manner of
oppression.

, As Lenin observed: “The world—wide_

experience of bourgeois and landlord gov-
ernments has developed two methods of
keeping the people in subjection. The
first is violence. . . . But there is an-
other method. . . . That is the method
of deception, ﬂattery, ﬁne phrases, num-
berless promises, petty sops, and con-
cessions of the unessential while retain-
ing the essential. . . . But from day to
day trustful naivete and naive t1'ustful-
ness will diminish, especially among the
proletarians and poor peasants, who are
being taught by experience (by their
social and economic position) to distrust
the capitalists.” (Selected Work-s, Vol.
VI, pp. 51-52.)

This key fact, in the pﬁnal analysis,
will determine the basic orientation and
ultimate character of the Negro peo-
ple’s movement for equal rights and
national liberation. It will propel that
movement in the direction of conscious
anti-imperialist, anti-monopoly, anti- cap-
italist struggle in combination with and
under the leadership of the working class.

At the present stage of its develop-
ment, the Negro people’s movement puts
forth a program of elementary demo-
cratic demands for equality of citizen-
ship rights, economic opportunities, and
social justice. It struggles against all
forms of racial segregation and dis-
crimination, and demands full political,
economic, and social equality for Ne-
groes as individual citizens and as a
people. It seeks to organize the united
strength of the whole Negro people of
all classes in active struggle for these
immediate common demands. Likewise,
it strives to enroll the active participa-
tion and support of the broadest strata
of white people in the struggle for
these equal rights demands of the Ne-
gro people.

The cdmmon bondage of racial and

 

national oppression to which the whole
of the Negro people are subjected makes
possible the coalition of the diverse class
strata of the“ Negro people in struggle
for their freedom.

H. The Working Class —

The lwovrkmg class stratum of the Ne-
gro population is the first and the most
important of the social forces which
make up the Negro people’s movement.

0 The workers are the most numerous
stratum of the Negro people which is
constantly increasing its proportion in
the total Negro population as the petty
bourgeois class stratum of the rural
masses suifers decline.

a The social action of the Negro
workers is the most potent force in the
Negro people’s movement because the
Negro workers, like their white class
brothers, are strategically positioned at
the very Vitals of,the oppressing capi-
talist production system--in the mines,
mills, and factories.

o The Negro workers are an integral
part of the U.S. working class——~broth-
ers wth the white workers in toil and
struggle against capitalist exploitation.
Not only do the Negro workers seek the
support of the working class for the
struggle of the Negro people for equal
rights and freedom from national and
racial oppression, but they are an im-
portant integral part of the working

class, ‘being 11 per cent of all industrial
workers-25 per cent of the miners, 30
per cent of the packinghouse workers, 15
per cent of the steel and auto workers,
45 per cent of the lumber workers, etc.

A—~and consequently are able to help in-

sure the participation of large sections
of the working class in the Negro peo-
ple’s freedom struggles.

Because of their dual identity--with
the struggles and aspirations of the Ne-
gro people for freedom from national
and racial oppression, on the one hand,
and with the struggles and aspirations
of the working class for freedom from
capitalist exploitation and political domi-
nation, on the other, the Negro workers
represent that numerically dominant
force within the Negro people’s move-

ment which insures the correlation, the.

partnership, the development of ever
more profound relations of alliance and
solidarity between the Negro people’s
movement and the working class move-
ment, presently on issues of immediate
interest and ultimately on questions of
strategic objectives. ,

There is no greater task for the Com-
munists and advanced workers to fulﬁll
in connection with the working class
than that of furthering the bonds of class
unity and brotherhood between Negro

and white workers. At all times Commu- *

nists must stand in the forefront of the
struggle to smash every remaining color

 

 

bar and anti-Negro prejudice, practice,
‘ ormanifestation of racial prejudices in

thetrade union and other working-class
organizations. «Communists must always
stand forth as tireless /ﬁghters for the
integration of Negro workers on the ba-
sis of full equality in the life and affairs
of the trade unions. Communists must
ceaselessly work to inﬂuence the trade

unions to struggle for full equality in -

job rights in all branches of industry

for the Negro workers—in‘- terms of

employment, equal pay for equal work,
job classiﬁcation, upgrading, training
and promotion; to put an end to all ra-
cial exclusiveness in the employment and
job classiﬁcation practices in the indus-
triesland enterprises. Communists mus-t
be outstanding in inﬂuencing and shar-
ing in the completion of the urgent work
of the labor movement ‘to organize the
millions of unorganized Negro and white
workers-—tparticularly in the South---into
the trade unions.

Communists must be tireless in organ-
izing and stimulating the labor movement
to champion the freedom demands of the
Negro people, and to render every ma-
terial and moral support to the concrete
struggles of the Negro people for politi-
cal, economic and social equality and
freedom from national oppression, segre-
gation, disfranchisement and discrimi-
nation.

Ill. The Rural Masses

The second most important class

stratum of the Negro people is the toil-

ing farmers and fawn. toilers-that
grouping of class forces who make up
the Negro peasantry, the toiling masses
of agrarians. More than ﬁve million, a
fourth of these rural masses of the na-
tion as a whole, live and toil in the
throes of the semi-feudal plantation sys-
tem of agrarian economy under the bar-
barous yoke of its slavery-like labor re-
lations, cultural and social degradation
and political oppression, as impoverished
-sharecroppers, tenant farmers and farm
lalborers. '

The organized struggles of these rural
Negro masses in united and parallel ac-
tions with the toiling white farmers, for
land, livelihood, and liberty from the op-
pressive yoke of the plantation system,
are a powerful force of the Negro peo-
ple’s movement. The speciﬁc gravity
of the role of the farm toilers in the
people’s movement of struggle for Ne-
gro equality and freedom is next in im-
portance only to that of the workers.
The further development and fullest un-
folding of this agrarian front of struggle
for democratic land reform is a basic
task and i.ndispensab1e condition for ma-
jor advancement on the road to victory

 the Negro people’s movement.
. 8 .

 

IV. The Urban lMic|d‘le Class

That stratum of the Negro popula-
tion which is of the urban middle class
is indeed a small percentage of the
total Negro people. Yet, individuals
from this stratum play an uncommonly
important role in the democratic national
front of the Negro people’s movement.
The professionals and small business
people--by virtue of their greater articu-
lateness and technical proﬁ»ciency——large-
ly dominate the leadership of the various
organizations which constitute the Ne-
gro people’s movement at the present
time. This segment of Negro people in
the main live in much more favorable
material circumstances than the masses
of the Negro workers and farm toilers.
However, when compared with the status
of the urban middle class strata of white
people-in every categoryé-the Negroes
are bound down in an inferior and un-
equal status by .a ﬁerce pattern of dis-
crimination, segregation, and racial and
national oppression. Ill-ustrative of this
conditon of the Negro -middle-class
strata is the situation which Negro
physicians confront. They are admitted
to only a few medical schools and can
practice or use the facilities of a neg-
ligible number of the tax-supported hos-
pitals; they are ‘barred from membership
in most medical societies where knowledge
of a scientiﬁc nature is exchanged. Con-
sequently, their median income is less

than one-half that of white physicians

and their numbers are -but a token of
the need. For example, in all of
Mississippi. where a million Negroes
live, there are only 62 Negro doctors or
one for every 15,900 Negroes. (In the
country as a whole there is only one
Negro doctor to every 3,500 Negroes.)

The positive and valuable role which
the Negro stratum of the urban middle
class plays in the cause of the struggle
for Negro rights ﬂows from the dis-
crimination visited upon Negroes in this
stratum. However, their role within the
Negro people’s movement is neither uni-
formly progressive not consistent, for
they also represent the propertied and
higher income strata of .-the Negro people
and, ‘ hence, all the conservative and
compromising inﬂuences that are asso-
ciated with the protection of vested prop-
erty interest which are vulnerable to
the pressures of the banks and big
business dictation.

The middle class stratum of the Negro
people will remain a very signiﬁcant
associated component of the social base
of the Negro liberation movement.
However, the present dominance of its
policies and leadership in the Negro
people’s movement is a temporary phe-
nomenon; eventually it must give way
to the leadership and policies of the mass

 

classes which make up the Negro 
ple, that is, the workers and farmer toil-
ers, and especially the workers.

V. The Negro Capitalists

That segment of the ‘ Negro popu1a- '

tion which is in the status of capital-
ists number only several thousands. They
are found in the category of small capi-
talists largely limited to the service
ﬁelds of enterprise-—that is, insurance,
small loan companies, undertaking estab-
lishments, tonsorial enterprises, news-
papers and magazines. There are no
Negro industrial capitalists engaged in
manufacturing of commodities on a large
scale. Only a fraction of oneper cent
(20,000) of the total number of Negro
working people are exploited as wage
earners in the enterprises of sizeasble
Negro capitalists.

In addition to all the general problems '

besetting small capitalists in an economy
geared to the interests of and dominated
by the big monopolists, the Negro capi-
talists also fall under the yoke of na-
tional and racial discrimination. Their
investment‘ opportunities are largely
limited to that segment of the Negro
consumer and service market which the
white monopolists have not elected to
seize. In matters of securing bank
credits, marketing of their products or
services, securing licenses and franchises
to do business, acquiring necessary types
of insurance for their enterprises, etc.,
the Negro capitalists confront barriers
of national exclusion and race discrimi-
nation on every hand. Although there
are a token number of “mixed-capital”
enterprises (that is, Negro and white
investors) operated by Negro capital-I
ists, generally speaking, no Negro com-
pradore bourgeoisie exists; the Negro
market is exploited directly by the big

«white merchants and capitalists, and not

through the agency of Negro “compre-
dores” as is often the case in colonial
countries.

, All of these circumstances-—plus the
basic one, that Negro capitalists and
wealthy individuals enjoy no favored
social amenities or freedom from Jim-
Crow oppression which is the common
lot of all Negroes in the United States,
regardless of class status—-—-sustain the
antagonisms and contradictions -between
the Negro capitalist and the dominant
sector of the monopoly capitalist class.
These factors are what motivate the Ne-
gro capitalists to enter into the strug-
gle for Negro rights, in company with

_ the Negro workers and peasants against

the white monopolist ruling class. Un-
der the leadership of the Negro workers,
the Negro people’s movement can enroll
the larger part of the Negro capitalist
stratum into some measure of support

in the coalition of the Negro peoples’
L movement, it is necessary for the'work-
E . ers to oppose and ﬁght against the con-
servative, compromising and reactionary
capitalist narrow-mindedness of the
Negro capitalist inﬂuence within and
upon that movement.
Such is the broad class spread, the

 

social base of the Negro people's move-
ment.

The content of the inner struggle with-
in the Negro people’s movement is re-
ﬂected in the strivin-gs of the representa-
tives of the working class on the other,
to establish the dominance of the lead-
ership and policies of its respective class
viewpoint.

ON THE THEORY OF THE
NEGRO QUESTION IN THE
UNITED STATES

I. National Status of the Negro People

The Negro people are the most
severely oppressed and all-sidedly ex-
ploited of all the peoples who make
up the American nation of the United

 

  A States.

 — _ The Negroes in the United States are

 ‘A , not constituted as a separate nation.

 V Rather, they have the characteristics of
;  a racially distinctive people or nation-

ality who are a historically determined
component part of the American nation
of the United States. The American
nation (of the U.S., that is) is a his-
torically ‘derived national formation, an
amalgam of more or less well differen-
_ tiated nationalities. 1

Though deprived of their just and

equal rights and freedom to fully par-

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

the. nation, the Negro people nonethe-
less have contributed to and have an
inseparable stake in (no less than its

\

 

ticipate in all aspects of the affairs of

other national components) the Ameri-
can nation’s common territory, economic
life, language, culture, and psychologi-
cal make-up.

At the same time, compounded out of
their singular historic experiences——
from yesterday’s slavery to today’s as-
pirations and struggles for complete
freedom—the Negro people retain spe-
cial national features and nation-like
characteristics which manifest them-
selves (among other ways) in a uni-
versal conception and consciousness of
their identity as a distinctive “people”
with a national will to attain a status
in the life of the American nation free
of all manner of oppression, social
cstracism, economic discrimination, poli-
tical inequality, enforced racial. segre-
gation, or cultural retardation.

To conclude that the Negro people in
the U. S. are not a nation is not to say
that the Negro question in the U. S. is
not a national question. It is indeed a
national question. The question is, how-
ever, a national question of what type,
with what distinguishing characteris-
tics, ; calling for what strategic concept
for its solution?

“An abstract presentation of the
question of nationalism is of no use at
all.” These words from Lenin’s famous
letter of December 1922 on the “Ques-
tion of Nationalities” represent the
key to the Leninist approach to the
national question. In establishing the
theoretical representation of the Negro
question in the United States from the
Marxist standpoint, it is necessary to
appreciate the scope of the national
question in Marxist thought. Marxism
on the national question is concerned
with the question of the liberation of
the oppressed nation and the relation-
ship of that cause to the liberation of
the working class from the yoke of capi-
talism in a given country and on a
world scale. But this does not yet ex-
haust the scope of the national question.
The national question exists in an in-
ﬁnite variety of forms and Marxist
science provides guide lines for the
theoretical representation and solution
of each particular manifestation and
formation of the national question.
Within the scope of the national ques-
tion, there is included not merely the
question of the nation, but the question
of national minorities, national and
ethnic groups, national-ethnic minority
questions and national-communal (re-
ligious) group questions, etc. Marxism
provides a guide to the characterization
and developmental outlook for each of
these -manifestations of the ‘ national
.questi'on._ ’ ' ' »   '1
7 It is first necessary to" determine pre-

   

cisely the particular, variety-or  of
national question one is confronted with.‘

It is obligatory to examine the dis- "

tinctive features of that question inits
development (not in static terms) and
in its actual and A potential’ relationship
to dominant historical development of a
given time. In reference to the national
question one must above all be guided
by Lenin’s admonition that no problem,
can be presented for practical solution

if represented in isolation. The particu-_ '

lar national question must be viewed
and represented at all times in the con-
text of its total relationships to the
historical primary social forces. That is
to say, it would be -a -feckless exercise
to present the Negro question in the
United States divorced from the his-'
torical and social national and world
inﬂuences and relationships which bear
upon and in large measure decide the
frame in which it can achieve resolu-

We were in error to limit our frame
of reference in Marxist writings on the
national question to that of the nation
in seeking scientiﬁc guide lines to an
analysis and representation of the Ne-
gro question in the United States. We
incorrectly selected the universally
valid Marxist principle of “self-deteiu
mination for oppressed nations” as the
primary category into which we sought
to compress the Negro question in the
United States. By selecting -a Marxist
principle which has unimpeachable
validity in reference to the rights -and
logical course for development of op-
pressed nations, we logically were led
to focus upon the distinctive nation-like
features and characteristics of the Ne-
gro people as the thing of almost ex-_.
clusive importance in the Negro
question in the United States. But of
no less importance in the life as well

as history of the Negro people in the '
United States are the integral features .

and experiences, common history and
aspirations-of this people to secure their
unfettered identification with, and in-
clusion in, the full rights and privileges
of ‘ the American nation. (The Negro
people are the most deprived and de-
nied component part of that nation.)

It is not at all necessary to deny the
fact that the Negro people in the area
of their majority in the Deep ‘South
exhibit to one degree or another char-
acteristics common to distinctive na-
tions in order to establish the fact that
such nation-like attributes are not
determinative for either the solution or
representation of the Negro question in
the United States. Such characteristics
cannot of themselves mark‘ out _the
course of development and pathway to
