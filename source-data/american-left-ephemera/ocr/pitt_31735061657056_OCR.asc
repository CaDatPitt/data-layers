THE COURT’S OPINION as written by Mr. Justice Murphy is very
important today. The government in most political denaturaliza-
tion proceedings, counting upon the hysteria of the times, repeats
the performance in the Schneldennun case, with a few variations.
It relies upon paid informers to establish membership, and in-
formers who are also “experts” in Marxism and Leninism, to
establish addiction by defendants to “violent overthrow of the
U.S. government” and therefore “prove” their inability to be “at-
tached to the U.S. Constitution.”

After setting forth the Court's examination of the documents
in evidence, the Schneidennun majority opinion declares:

A tenable conclusion from the foregoing is that the (Com-
munist) Party in 1927 desired to achieve its purpose hy
peaceful and democratic means, and, as a theoretical matter
justified the use of force and violence only as a method
of preventing an attem ted forcible counter-overthrow, once
the Party had obtaine control, in a peaceful manner, or
as a method of last resort to enforce the majority will, if
at some future time, because of the peculiar circumstances,
constitutional or peaceful channels were no longer open
. . . (Emphasis added.)

Mr. Justice Murphy also said: “The naturalized citizen has as
much right as the native-bom citizen to exercise the cherished
freedoms of speech, press, and religion.”

In a concurring opinion, Mr, Justice Rutledge wrote a condemn-
ation of such denaturalization proceedings. He was appalled at
the possibility of nullifying citizenship “seventeen years after a
federal court adjudged” Schneiderman entitled to be a citizen; ‘It
implies no limit in time for such “insecurities of citizenship”
(and this is now incorporated in the Walter-McCarran Law, which
has no statute of limitations in such cases). He also warned that
this is not a matter concerning only one man, for its outcome
“could affect thousands or tens of thousands” of citizens.

He also said:

. . . No citizen with such a threat hanging over his head
could he free. If he helon ed to ‘off-color’ organization:
or held too radical or, perhaps, too reactionary views, for
some segment of the judicial palate, when his admission
took place, he could not open his mouth without fear his
words would be held against him.

. . . Such a citizen would not be admitted to liberty. His
best course would be silence or hypocrisy. This is not citizen-
ship.

(Emphasis added.)

 

 

Congressional and State “un-American” investigating commit-
tees have used the threat of denaturalization on “uncooperative
witnesses” such as Martin Hall and Hugh Hardyman, who are
foreign-born citizens. -

There can be no doubt that foreign-born citizenship has been
deliberately made “second-class” to provide weapons of in-
tirnidation for purposes of thought control.

POLITICAL DENATURALIZATIONS are approaching the one hun-
dred mark. They involve many editors and reporters for the
foreign-language and labor-progressive press; leaders of in-
dependent trade unions; and a former Michigan State Senator,
Stanley Novak, a veteran of 25 years in the labor movement who
is appealing to higher courts against a denaturalization order.

There are nine such victims in Los Angeles. Two of them have
already been ordered denaturalized, by federal district courts. One
is Sam Title, who came here in 1924 and was naturalized in
1941. The other is Eulogia de la Cruz, whose case has just reached
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Mr. de la Cruz was born in the Philippines, and came here
several decades ago as a national of the United States by virtue
of its overlordship of the Philippines. He was for many years an
official of the cannery workers local of the International Long-
shoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union, headed by Harry Bridges.

In later years he moved to Wilmington. In 1947 he was granted
naturalization.‘ In 1953 the government petitioned to denaturalize
him on grounds of former membership in_the Communist Party.

Witnesses against him were renegade union members. Two of
them were in the U.S. Army, under the control of superior officers.
All three witnesses used are naturalized citizens, who run the
risk of losing their own citizenship for failure to “cooperate” with
the government. They swore that Mr. de la Cruz had attended
“closed Communist Party meetings” when he was a union official.

Similar testimony in the Bridges denaturalization proceedings
was thrown out by the judge, on grounds that the government
witnesses were untrustworthy. He finally dismissed the govern-
ment’s petition, saying that citizenship is too solemn and weighty
a matter to be taken away for less than “c1ear, unequivocal and
convincing evidence” as stated in many high court decisions.

The judge in the Bridges case also pointed out that after numer-
ous investigations prior to deportation proceedings, and due in-
vestigation before granting citizenship, as it did in 1945 (with
F.B.I. reports available by the truckload), it was still unable to
prove lack of attachment to the Constitution by virtue of Com-

munist Party membership. Now in 1955 it was trying to accom-
plish through the political climate (of cold war hysteria) what
it couldn't achieve previously.

IN ROSE CHERN IN ’S denaturalization case there are other extra-
ordinary facts to consider.

Since 1950, when the deportation terror mounted in Los An-
geles as it did throughout the nation, Rose Chernin has been a
deeply frustrating person to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service locally.

As executive director of the Los Angeles Committee for Pro-
tection of Foreign Born, she organized and sparked the fight
against deportations, denaturalizations, and for release on bail,
and against the harrassment of foreign-born communities by
employees of the Department of Justice, including the especially
intense persecution of the Mexican-American population and the
mass deportation of Mexican nationals who work the crops.

In 1951 she was arrested together with 14 other California work-
ing class leaders, charged with “conspiracy” to “at some future
time” use violence to overthrow the U.S. government. Her arrest
was calculated to remove her from her leadership of the fight for
the rights of the foreign-born.

In 1952, after a six-month-long trial, she was sentenced to five
years in jail for violation of the Smith Act. The case was appealed,
and is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Being free on bail pending appeal, she resumed her executive
direction of the Committee's work. With good reason, for all her
life she had fought for the oppressed, was herself foreign-born,
and had become a naturalized citizen back in 1928, one year after
her marriage to an American citizen.

Twenty-five years after becoming a citizen, she was visited by
a U.S. Marshal and served with a complaint petitioning the federal
court to cancel her naturalization on grounds that in 1928 she
was “not attached to the U.S. Constitution” by virtue of alleged
membership in certain Communist organizations.

This is “concealment of a material fact” in the jargon of the
Walter-McCarran Law, “justifying” loss of citizenship.

This was “piling on” the agony of persecution, indeed. The
Department of Justice overlooked nothing in its attempt to in-
capacitate her for the work which she holds is the best possible
practice of American citizenship-—the fight for the constitutional
rights of all, regardless of race, color or creed, political belief, or
place of birth.

_1o_

 

 

Rose Chernin’s case illustrates the unfairness of the Law, espe-
cially with regard to the lack of any “statute of limitations" for
revoking citizenship by naturalization.

It is now 27 years since Rose Chemin became a citizen.

The fact that she comes to’ trial next June 6th indicates the
vital need for repealing the Law as rapidly as possible. It is the
government that is committing a crime in this proceeeding.

PETER CHAUNT, Hungarian-bom victim, came here in 1921 and
was naturalized in 1940. He was for many years an active cultural
and educational worker in the International Workers Order, a
fraternal and insurance organization that was dissolved by court
order a few years ago, on grounds that it was a “Communist-
front" group.

Peter Chaunt is married to an American citizen and has a
native-bom daughter. Bitterly resentful of the attack on his
right to citizenship, he declares his own concept of the meaning

' of citizenship:

I have :een the geople’: love of our great land in their
pichet line:. In t eir :trihe:. In bitter :truggle: to put an
end to ]im Crow. In the marche: o the hungry and home-
le:: durin the depreuion. In t e :ad eye: 0 evicted
farmer:, t e tear: of their wive: and children. he:e very
battle: for better American living were our training ground
for good citizemhip . . .

If law: like the Walter-McCarran Law, and the public
official: who ap ly it, would :ubvert citizemhip into
worthle:: Jpirituaf :lavery whereby an American may not
read, advocate or a::ociate accordin to hi: free choice, then
:uch law: and ruch public offic'a : mu:t be removed and
replaced by truly democratic oner.

TWO MARRIED COUPLES are also among the victims of de-
naturalization, with “evidence” being supplied against them by
government witnesses for pay.

David and Freda Diamond came here in 1910, worked hard all
their lives, and for decades have been devoted to trade union
work in the garment industry, and to the needs of the people in
the communities in which they have lived. They have also a long
history of activity in Jewish cultural and fraternal groups.

In 1943 they won citizenship. In 1956 the government is trying
to reduce their “second-class” citizenship to non-citizenship, an
ordeal that is profoundly disturbing—and disgusts and horrifies
their friends and neighbors.

_11_

 

   

They have already undergone court proceedings and govem-
ment “witnesses" and so-called “experts” whose antics are con-
temptible were presented. Yet through the distorted testimony
shines the essence of the citizenship practiced by Mr. and Mrs.
Diamond: devotion to the best interests of their fellow man, de-
votion to the fight for democratic rights for all people without
exception.

MR. AND MRS. WACHER are another couple who are being given
the Walter-McCarran “second-class” citizen treatment. They have
been here since 1914, and because of language difficulties, con-
stant moving in search of work, and other handicaps that beset
so many immigrants, they were unable to get citizenship until
fairly late in life.

“I am forever grateful for the freedom I found here after spend-
ing an oppressed childhood under the Czar, suffering pogroms and
political persecution,” said Mrs. Sarah Wacher. “I was brought
here by a family seeking freedom, and I think I know what
freedom really is. The fight I have made for freedom here is no
crime, no matter how much they may call it ‘subversive’ to pro-
vide an excuse for robbing me of hard-won citizenship.”

Her husband is also emphatic. “In all my years I have com-
mitted no crime, broken no law, no matter how the government
uses informers to attack my right to citizenship,” he says. “No
crime, that is, unless helping to organize labor unions, fighting
for unemployment relief and social security, and other progres-
sive achievements, are crimes.”

There is additional irony in the fact that Sarah Wacher is
prominent in Jewish cultural circles, particularly the Emma Laz-
arus clubs, named after the famous Jewish poet whose poetic
inscription on the Statue of Liberty symbolizes the one-time mean-
ing of America as haven of the oppressed, the “golden gate"
which Governor Mennon Williams recently described as now being
“tamished brass” because of the Walter-McCarran Law.

A VETERAN of the second world war is the ninth Southern Cali-
fornia victim of the Law's denaturalization provisions. James E.
Toback was awarded his citizenship for patriotic service in the
U.S. Army, in a ceremony performed by an officer. By his deeds
he was already a citizen: So war-time admission to citizenship
was described.

Eleven years later he was informed that he was guilty of fraud
when he took the oath of citizenship, because he had “concealed
a material fact" as to his political views.

_12_

 

 

 

“There was no concealment of political views, before, during,
or after I became a citizen,” declares James E. Toback. “The officer
who administered the oath was fully aware of my ideas and
views. But it has become convenient in these days to consider
‘ideas’ illegal, and reactionaries who would tell us how to think
have a strong weapon in the Walter-McCarran Law. Charging
that my ideas of many years ago are now ‘subversive,’ they are
trying to take away my citizenship. Can American citizenship
be such a temporary loan? I never thought so, and don't think
so now. We must fight to save the quality of citizenship from
those who would destroy it in their reactionary rage.”

James E. Toback was brought here fifty years ago, when a child
of five. He too has a long history of fighting for the jobless, and
for the social security that is now the law of the land, although
many people are unaware of the way others fought and suffered
to get the law enacted.

Under the Walter-McCarran Law he can not only be denatural-
ized, but like all other such victims may be further persecuted
through deportation.

Would it not be a bitter comment on America's transformation
from a liberty-loving to an oppressive country, for the foreign-
born, if this man, who has lived here most of his childhood and
all his adult life and is typically an American product, should be
exiled from these shores after fifty years of sinking roots here
—including honorable service in the U. S. Army!

THIS CRYING SHAME of political denaturalization is an opening
wedge in reduction of the rights of all Americans. It must be
halted.

Protests must be directed to the Attorney General, Washington,
D.C., asking that all these un-American proceedings be dropped
forthwith.

Every Congressman must receive continuous urgings to work
for repeal or drastic revision of the Walter-McCarran Law—now,
in the present session of the 84th Congress.

We particularly urge you to include in your protests the need
for at least revising the Law to provide that there shall be no
denaturalization of foreign-born citizens for any reason after
citizenship has been in effect ten years or more (as stated in the
Lehman Bill to replace the present Law.)

Funds for the defense are urgently needed. Please make checks
payable to the Los Angeles Committee for Protection of Foreign
Born.

* GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION OF CITIZENSHIP

NATURALIZATION may be denied; or, regardless of how long
citizenship has been held, it may revoked through Section 340 and
sub-sections of the Walter McCarran Law, for many reasons, in-
cluding:

Concealment of a material fact, or willful misrepresentation
(which is so general and undefined as to make for entrapment, if
the government wishes to petition for revocation).

Conviction for contempt, for refusal to inform for a con-
gressional committee (which is a denial of the Fifth Amendment
privilege).

Membership in or affiliation with a “proscribed" organiza-
tion before, during, or after naturalization (a “proscribed-" organi-
zation being one of literally hundreds which the Attorney General
has arbitrarily placed on his “subversive" list).

0 C I

DERIVATIVE CITIZENSHIP of minor or spouse may be revoked in
certain cases of denaturalization as stated above (involving punish-
ment for “the sins of the parents").

I 3 *

DUAL CITIZENSHIP, in which one is both a native-born U.S. citizen,
and derives the nationality of a non-citizen parent (as do, for
example, Americans of Mexican heritage), may lead to expatriation
(loss of citizenship rights) because of dishonorable discharge from
U. S. armed forces, employment by a foreign government, and many
other reasons. This is now being tested in the courts.

U.S. SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN MARSHALL
wrote in 1824:

A naturalized citizen becomes a member of society,
possessing all the rights of a native citizen, and
standing, in the view of the Constitution, on the
footing of a native. The Constitution does not author-
ize Congress to enlarge or abridge these rights.

THE COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION
appointed by President Truman after the Walter-McCarran
Law was passed over his veto, held nation-wide public hearings
on the provisions of the new Law, and in its official REPORT
in 1953 stated: '

American citizenship is one of the most valuable
rights in the world today. The manner in which it
can he acquired or lost is a matter for deep concern
to all Americans . , .

Many witnesses hefore the Commission were critical
of what they characterized as ‘second-class’ citizen-
ship . . . which gives naturalized citizens an inferior
status to native-horn citizens . . . I

Denaturalization should not be used as an additional
penalty for discrimination between native and natu-
ralized citizens.

Citizens Without Rights

The Story of How the
Walter-McCarran Law of 1952
Penalize: Foreign-Born Citizen:
Through "Second-Cla::” Citizenship

By HARRY CARLISLB

CI'I'IZENS WITHOUT rights are those who because of their foreign
birth are discriminated against and may be denaturalized for
reasons which do not affect native-born citizens. They are citizens
reduced to “second class” status.

This is the result of passage of the Walter-McCarran Law in
1952. The law violates the basic American democratic precept
that “all men are created equal.”

In the Declaration of Independence itself the King of England
is charged with “injuries and usurpations” as follows:

He ha: endeavored to prevent the population of the:e
State:; for that purpo:e oh:tructing the Law: for Naturali-
zation of Foreigner:; refu:ing to pa:: other: to encourage
their immigration hither.

It was for these and other considerations, lengthily debated and
well thought out, that “equality of rights” for all persons resident
in the United States was written into the Constitution.

After the Revolutionary War ended and the Constitution was
adopted, George Washington wrote a letter to the Hebrew con-
gregation in New Port, Rhode Island, saying:

The citizen: of the United State: of America have a right
to a plaud them:elve: for havin given to mankind ex-
amp e: of an enlarged and liher policy, a policy worthy
of imitation. All po::e:: alike liberty of con:cience and
immunitie: of citizen:hip. It i: now no more that toleration
i: :pohen of, a: if it 104: by the indulgence of one cla::
of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent
9. rights.
(Emphasis added. Cited in New York TIMES, 2/22/44.) »

THE HISTORIC nature of the rights of citizenship is stated in con-
temporary terms by Ralph Perry in “The Citizen Decides” (U. of
Indiana, 1951) as follows:

. . . freedom to think for oneself and communicate one’s
thoughts to others, freedom to criticize the ouernment in
power, freedom to vote at the polls, and t e freedom of
such agencies as the press, radio, private organization: and
assemblies, through which opinions are aired, exchanged
and discussed . . . These freedoms form the core of the
so-called 'cioil liberties’ and ‘bills of rights.’

Such “civil liberties” and ‘‘bills of rights” were abolished for
the foreign-born when Congress in 1952, swayed by cold war
hysteria that had been mounting for many years, passed the
Walter-McCarran Law.

Among the many immigration, deportation, and other inequities
contained in its hundreds of clauses, it limited fourteen million
foreign-bom Americans to “second-class” citizenship.

So blatant is the racist philosophy underlying the Law's major
sections that six hundred spokesmen for leading national organ-
izations of every sort—religious, labor, civic, professional, legal,
nationality and others — registered vehement protest with the
President's Commission. This protest has mounted ever since,
voiced and recorded at conventions, conclaves, and public gather-
ings of every description. An increasing volume of demand for
repeal has reached members of Congress.

As summarized by the Commission in its published REPORT, it
recommends that the Law

. . . should be reconsidered and revised from beginning
to end (because it) applies discriminations against human
beings on account of national origin, race, creed and color.

The Department of Justice, however, which won control of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1940 (when it was re-
moved from the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor), is using
to the full these “racist and discriminatory” provisions of the Law,
as a weapon against the entire foreign-bom population.

This policy was announced by Attorney General Brownell soon
after his appointment, when he pledged his department to deport
twelve thousand and denaturalize ten thousand foreign-bom
Americans.

Many “political” denaturalization proceedings are being fought
in the federal courts throughout the nation today; nine of these
“Citizens Without Rights” cases are in Los Angeles, They repre-
sent a shameful demeaning of American citizenship.

DISCRIMINATION against the foreign-born is an old practice in
the United States.

It arose from the very first, because of the historic need to en-
slave, persuade, cajole, and place under labor-contract millions
of immigrants from every country, speaking many languages and
using different customs. .

This contrasted with the “Anglo-Saxon" speech, thought,
scholarship and customs historically dominant since the founding
of the colonies.

There developed a conflict, as well as a mutual interweaving of
cultures. It expressed itself in the first phase in Negro slavery
as against the “natural rights of man”; vigorous discrimination
against persons of a different color, creed, race, place of birth, or
political opinion, counteracted to some degree by the concept of
freedom and equality taught as the American credo.

Discrimination has also poisoned legislation and inﬂuenced
judicial opinion. It has permeated immigration and naturalization
policy. It has placed limits on the rights of peoples to citizenship.

This is related in part by Edward Corsi, in the pamphlet “Paths
to a New World,” as follows:

From early colonial times not all of the persons who were
admitted to the United States were permitted to become
citizens. The First Congress limited naturalization to ‘any
alien, being a free white person’ . . .

In 1870, naturalization was extended to "aliens of African
nativity and to persons of African descent’ (But first-class
citizenship for the Negro people in reality has not yet heen
won.)

It was 1940 (hefore) American Indians and Eskimos could
hecome naturalized. In 1943 Chinese were made eligible
for naturalization, and three years later this right was ex-
tended to Filipinos and to natives of India.

Not until 1952 did Congress, under pressure of severe world
criticism of the United States for its discriminatory treatment of
the peoples of other lands, remove racial barriers to citizenship.
Even so, it vastly increased discrimination in all other areas, by
passage of the Walter-McCarran Law.

WITH EACH CRISIS since the “anti-Jacobin" hysteria during the
administration of President Adams, the foreign-born citizen and
non-citizen has been made the scapegoat of official wrath and
bigoted attack, as a diversionary and divisive tactic.

When the Allen and Sedition Laws were passed in 1798, Thomas

__3_

 

   

Jefferson warned that they would breed tyranny because, as he
wrote:

The alien ha: already been :elected a: the firrt experiment,
but the Act has already marked the citizen a: it: prey.

Anti-alien hysteria spread by the bigoted “Know Nothings,”
brought from Abraham Lincoln an eloquent defence of im-
migrants, who numbered at least one-half of the workers whose

sweat and toil was enriching the nation and expanding its
economy.

THIRTY MILLION IMMIGRANTS who came to the United States
during the 19th century, had to fight for even the most primitive
rights in social and economic life.

Many of them came here as refugees from feudal tyranny, and
they brought with them a deep love of freedom. While this was
deepened by the democratic heritage they found here, they also
enriched this heritage of democratic rights and freedoms by their
tenacious fight for equal rights and dignity for all people.

The struggle of immigrants was often bitter. They were hated,
scorned, treated as “inferiors” by American reactionaries. But it
was not until late in the 19th century that repressive immigration
and naturalization policies came to be reflected in legislation.

This was prompted as a weapon to counter the rise of the labor
movement, with its hard and bitter fight against the over-long
working day and pitifully low wages; and because the coming of
crises, spreading unemployment and starvation, spurred the or-
ganization of populist, labor, and socialist political movements
in which immigrants took part.

Because of this, as a by-product of the vicious “anti-a1ien" dog-
mas spread by movements such as the “Know Nothings," the
foreign-born were now also attacked on grounds of “foreign
radicalism” and immigration curbs and deportation powers were
demanded.

In 1896, Henry Cabot Lodge addressed the Senate as follows:

The injury of unrestricted immi ration to American wage:
and standard: of living i: Juf iciently plain and i: had
enough, but the danger which thi: immigration threaten:
to our citizenship is far worre.

He proposed that Congress pass a “literacy test” for immigrants,
on the frankly expressed ground that it would “bear most heavily
on ‘inferior’ Italians, Russians, Hungarians, Greeks, Asiatics” and
would “favor ‘superior’ Anglo-Saxon peoples.”

_4_

 

 

Such ideas were given wide currency in the pseudo-scientific
works of certain “scholars” of the period, such as Madison Grant,
Stoddard, William McDougal; and were even taught in the public
schools. ’

They also expressed themselves in the “villains” and other con-
tempt-breeding stereotypes of the foreign born, in newspapers
and magazines and in the mass entertainment media.

According to this concept, none but the “purest” Anglo-Saxon
(ironically, a mixture of many tribal and national strains) is fit
for American citizenship.

After World War One arose the “anti-Bo1shevik” hysteria, The
Palmer Raids took place, resulting in summary arrests without
warrants, and deportations without hearings, of thousands of
members of fraternal and nationality organizations and persons
suspected of either being Communists or “left” Socialists, or sym-
pathizers with revolutionary events in Europe.

This frightened many non-citizens from making final applica-
tion for citizenship; and even though this “political prohibition"
was not yet written into naturalization law, it was nevertheless
effective and should be considered for what it was—an aspect of
“second-class" citizenship in practice.

This was advanced still further during the days of the great
depression, when deportations were inflicted on non-citizens who
took part in the struggles for unemployment relief, for social
security, and organization of trade unions, because they were
sometimes arrested during demonstrations for relief or on picket
lines during strikes.

All of this militant mass activity was frowned upon as “radical”
or “Communist-inspired”, and on these grounds citizenship was
denied. Today it is termed “subversive” and has become the basis
for not only widespread deportations but denial of citizenship
and denaturalizatlon proceedings.

Since the Second World War ended and the “cold war” began,
the attack on the rights of the foreign-bom has been intensified,
leading to the most shameful climax of all—passag'e of the ex-
tremely oppressive, racist and discriminatory Walter-McCarran
Law of 1952.

Never before has the Department of Justice so influenced the
immigration service along political-police lines; never have the
victims been so ﬂagrantly discriminated against; never has Amer-
ican citizenship been so shamefully debased.

ABUSE OF CITIZENS of native-birth because of discrimination
by public officials, has been a more or less permanent factor in
Mexican-American communities of the Southwest. This is of
course combined with expatriation of citizens of Mexican descent,
termed “dual” citizens.

Hence Bernardo Diaz, native-bom citizen with native-born wife
and children, having visited Mexico (of which country he was a
“dual" citizen) was halted at the border and denied re-entry as an
“expatriate," because during World War Two he went A.W.O.L.,
and after being punished was given a dishonorable discharge.

Abuse on a mass scale was resorted to in 1941, right after the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, when 130,000 Japanese including
30,000 children on the West Coast were uprooted by military
force, dragged out of their homes and expelled from their farms,
and interned in Tule Lake concentration camps. Some 70,000 were
Nisei, that is, American-born citizens of Japanese descent. (But
in this case Japan in 1925 had abolished the “dual” citizenship
of nationals born abroad.)

The callous disregard of Constitutional personal and property
rights raised issues which are, fifteen years later, still being
fought in the federal courts. A judge recently declared that the
entire “concentration camp” scheme was “unnecessarily cruel
and inhuman.”

THE SAGA OF HERMAN BO’I'l‘CHER is related by the late Louis
Adamic in “Nation of Nations.” This German-bom American
citizen fought in Spain for democracy against Franco's fascists,
in 1936-1937, as a major in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade of
American Volunteers.

For this he was denaturalized on his return to the United States
in 1938. He was probably one of the first political victims of
denaturalization. He was called, with fellow “Spanish Vets”, a
“premature anti-fascist.”

Right after “Pearl Harbor” he enlisted as a private in the U.S.
Army, to continue the fight against fascism. He was sent to the
South Pacific, and was made a sergeant in 1942. In New Guinea
he became known as “the one-man army of Buna” because when
his commanding officers were killed or wounded, he took com-
mand of his company and led an attack that split the Japanese
lines and smashed through to the coast between Buna and Buna
Mission.

He was awarded a battlefield commission and the Distinguished
Service Cross, and his American citizenship was restored by a
special Act of Congress.

Louis Adamic writes: “By 1943 Captain Bottcher was a legend.’’

Had he lived today, the odds are that he would be undergoing
denaturalization proceedings because his self-sacrificing anti-
fascism of Spain and World War Two would be termed “sub-
versive”—such is the evil temper of the “cold war” and the dismal
state of our rights of citizenship.

MR. JUSTICE MURPHY of the U.S. Supreme Court made some
good civil rights decisions in years gone by, before the “cold
war” poisoned our national life and infected even the courts.

He once named Bridges as “perhaps the most persecuted” man,
because of the repeated attempts to deport him—and that was
before Harry Bridges underwent a “perjury” trial and denatural-
ization proceedings, and was exonerated on both counts.

Mr. Justice Murphy's most famous written opinion was the
majority decision of the Court in the Schneiderman denaturaliza-
tion case.

In 1943, in what marked the beginning of the systematic attack
on naturalized citizens on political grounds, (it would come to
full maturity with the cold war), William Schneiderrnan was
charged with “not being attached to the U.S. Constitution” in 1927,
when he took the oath of citizenship; because he was then a
member of the Young Communist League and was per se com-
mitted through that membership to “the overthrow of the U.S.
government by force and violence."

The federal district court granted the petition to denaturalize,
and the case was appealed. In 1944 it reached the U.S. Supreme
Court, and Wendell Willkie agreed to plead for the defendant
without fee, because, as he publicly stated, here was an issue the
outcome of which was tremendously important to every American.

The central issue concerned the Communist Party’s use of
Marxist and Leninist classic documents and pamphlets, some
written over a century ago, describing various historic conflicts
involving civil war and violent overthrow of feudal and non-
democratic governments. Passages “taken out of context” had
been freely cited by the government, labelled as “tenets” of
strategy and tactics necessitating “violent overthrow” of govem-
ments, to which members of “Communist” organizations are com-
mitted.

The defense contended otherwise, citing other passages to show
that these “tenets” differ in different historical conditions; that
under certain circumstances “peaceful” development of Socialism
is possible; that “Marxism is not a dogma, but a living, changing
philosophy”; and that guilt is individual, not by association.
