The close ties between Charles E.
Wilson, ‘Defense Production Adminis-
trator, and keyfofficials in the mining
industry were exposed last week by the
‘Mine-Mill research department. i

Wilson was president of General
Electric Corp. when President ‘Truman

. appointed him czar over the entire U. S.
’economy. He still has close ties with
GE, and is in line to get $222,000 this
year as his-share of extra profits from
GE op_erations.

- In addition to his $22,500 salary from
the government,’ Wilson also draws a
lifetime pension from GE of $66,000 a

_year. His personal fortune, invested in

. GE stocks, earns him $25,000 a year in

dividends and this year the increase in

value of GE stocksswill net him another '

$100,000‘. In other ‘words, Wilson is

scheduled to be paid.$_413,0_00 by GE

in. 1951. , ~ ~
A STUDY of the list of GE directors

shows at least ‘three who are directly‘

or indirectly involved in. running the
non-ferrous metals industry. In his
position as Defense Production Czar,
Wilson has the final say-so on all wage
settlements made in our industry. In
view of his close ties with the men who
run our industry, how can we expect an
, even break? '

Oneof the GE directors is Charles

D. Dickey of New York. Dickey also
sits on the board of directorsiof Kenne-
cott Copper Co., and is a "vice president
of the J’. P. Morgan firm.
' J. P. Morgan, in turn, holds a dom-
inant control over Phelps—Dodge, New-
mont Mining Co. and St. Joseph Lead
Co. They share control over the Ana-
conda Copper Co., Amegican Smelting
& Refining Co. and New Jersey Zinc.
Another GE director and pal of

Charles E. Wilson is Charles F. Adams 

of Boston, who holds adirectorship in
the U. S. Smelting, Mining & Refining
Co. A v A - '

Still ,a third GE director is H. S.

Morgan of the Morgan-Stanley banking
firm, one of the control keys in the

, giant Morgan empire which has such
.far-reaching influence in the non—fer-

rous metals. industry, in the’ United
States and abroad; ‘

- Until his death recently, president
Robert C. Stanley of the International
Nickel Co, was a director of GE and 5f
the Chase Natidpal -Bank. _ Inco has
bgn the target of a blistering attack
by, the Senate preparedness subcommit-
tee for exerting av stranglehold on the

WALL ST.'s WORRY

f/weafen zlu/oer /oroifzl.

.By_ Federated Press

Fear of peace is increasingly dis-
cussed in publications catering to busi-
nessmen and financiers. The Magazine
Of Wall Street lifts the. veil from the
war scares that the Truman adminis-
tration has been cooking up month af-
ter month, saying: (_

“More and more it looks as though
fear of scwrcities has been mainly
based on exaggerated ideas, encour-
aged rathler than discouraged so as to
win political support for stiffer taxes,
controls, restrictions, etc.”

Business Week commented without
gloves March 10:

“Wall Street has be?n buzzing with
‘peace scores” for days. . . . Wall
Street’s ‘scare’ un_fortundtely lcould
hzwhe some very scary results. . '
Consumers, well stocked, would stop
buying__. Business, also well stocked,
would start working off ivzventory.
Prices would dip. . . . Possi llity of
peace panic -has Wall Street worried.”

After the first horror had abated,
some of the shrewder commentators
began tp administer soothing syrup to
their business readers’.

David Lawrence’s U.S. News '&
World Report analyzed the threat of
in the March 30 issue. The
conclusion is reassuring to the pro.-
fit system at. ‘least in the imme-
diate future. “Peace, in other words,”
the lead article ‘says, “is not to be

synonymous with deflation or depres-

sion.”

Business Week, in a similaranalysis
March 24, declared:"‘The end of the
fighting in Koreg. would take steam

out of mobilization and bring on a

softening up. But it won’t be enough
to alter the prospect that the arms.-
ment load peak won’-t be passed for an-
other two years, even if Russia. does
behcwe.” --

' In an article in Look magazine, vice
president Ernest Breech of Ford Mo-
tor Co., recounting U.S. miracles of
production, predicts: '

“In the coming months, if a. global '

war has not began. to burn up the
produce of our factories, we will turn
out so‘ many hundreds of thousands
of machines for war there literally
will be no place to store them.”

It may be well to note Breech’s
guileless phrase, “if a global war has

   
 
 

   Ejq1ose Wilsori  wi th nletal industry I

"One of Wilson’s first appointments
after he was given the government’s
top economic post put Fred Searls Jr.
in charge of all production and alloca-
tion of non—ferrous metals. Searls is
president of Newmont Mining Co., and
has been described by the Federal Trade
Commission as “one of six men who
decide the policies on world production
and prices of copper.”

That is the weak spot in American ‘

productivity. Unless a world war con-
sumes the country's output, what is

to be done with it, since not all of it

can be sold at a profit?

[The Truman giveaway’ programs are
doing their part abroad in getting rid
of surpluses dangerous to profitable
pricing at home. Citizens sometimes
ask why the giveaways can’t be set up
at home as well, especially for the
needy. ‘

THE ANSWER is that‘ they could,
except for one thing. Where will the
line be drawn between the needy, who
would ‘benefit from such ‘a program,
and fthe near-needy, who would still
have to pay American prices for the

same goods? Once the price system.

  only union in Connecticut which
  . has a uniform contract expiration
date and a uniform wage policy is the
"International Union of Mine, Mill &

contracts expire on June 30 of this year.
Our wage policy, like our contract
‘Qexpiration date, is uniform not only
‘for the bass industry, but for the en-
V tire mining, smelting and refining in-
._-‘dustry. As a result, brass workers in
ine-Mill can not only present a united
demand for a wage increase, but can
havethe sure knowledge that the work-
_'ers of the entire industry are behind
fthem. '

., The most pressing need of Connecti-
~ cut brass workers is for a substantial
._wage increase. Ever since the Korean
War and the declaration of a State of
Emergency by the President, Connecti-
cut brass workers have been looking
{the wolf in the face.

_f VPrices have gone sky high, just as
they have throughout the rest of the
~j'c_o1'1ntry. But instead of getting a wage
ncrease to make up for the‘ higher
prices,'the ‘brass workers have in ef-
-:Ee_ct.been given a wage cut. With a
‘hortage ofcopper caused by stgck-
piling and a limitation placed on pro-
duction of civilian goods, a majority
-of‘ the "brass workers have been on four,
"three and two day a week work sched-
jiles.’ 1

- .Instead of being in a position to face
the employers with a united wage in-
crease demand, the Connecticut brass

ree major organizations, with three
otally different contracts.

The Chase Brass Workers are tied to
;UAW-type escalator clause without
“dwage re-opener; the‘ Bridgeport
Bjrassiworkers (AFL) cannot re-open
onlfwages until October, 1951; and the
American_ Brass workers in Waterbury
(U-AW) have an agreement which does
no expire until 1952.

, ere, it not for the fact that brass
kers ‘have been divided and dis-
pi; ed" through raiding activities, 50,-
00 rganized workers would now be

 at real wage increase. Only. a few

Savannah ﬁrm
defies NLRB

SAVANNAH, Ga.—Mine-Mill Local

870 has won another round in" the
long" battle for a contract at Reynolds
& Manley Lumber Co. here.

An NLRB trial examiner held hear-
ings ‘in January on charges that the
company had refused to bargain with
the union after Mine-Mill had won a
representation election.

The examiner, Peter, Ward, has now
issued a report ordering the company
to cease and desist from coercion, in-"
timidation and interference with its
employees in the exercise of their
rights to form, join and assist a labor
organization of their own choosing.

The ruling also orders the company
to bargain with Local 870 on wages,
hours and other eonditions of ‘employ-
mentand to enter intoa written agree-
ment. And it orders the coinpany to
reinstate Joe Brown, a striker who was
refused employment at the end of_ the
three-month strike last fall, with seni-
ority and compensation for all lost;

time.

* "The union immediately tried to open

negotiations with the company. How-

ever, the company again refused to

meet and said it was not going to abide

by the trial .examiner’s order. The.

NLRB will now be forced to take the _
case into cgurt. ' e x

 

tivities which pllay. into the hands of
the ‘employers. V
Such unity would guarantee ‘ much

.more substantial wage ‘increases than ~_.

any brass worker under PMC-UAW or

AFL can now envision. It would bring ,

not only the Mine-Mill brass locals
throughout the East‘ but the strength

A NEW YORK 'CITY——The“'position’"of, -  
the Ansonia,'Mine-Mill’ Brass‘ confer-‘S 

-ence on the government’s.. wage freeze

was expressedfin a letter to President V -H " if

Truman, signed by boardmember Al-
bert Pezzati. A ' l j  ~ 
The letter "informed the ‘President
that these representatives of more than
5,000 Connecticut and New ..York brass-
workers have adopted a program “call-
ing for the rescinding of the govern-
ment’s wage freeze order and the res-
toration of free collective bzﬁigainingl’
“Organizedlabor. is well aware of the
complete injustice of the so-called con-

trols so far ..irnposed,” it said. “There .'

is the merest ‘pretense\\of price control,
and profits are encouraged toicareen
to fantastic heights. To freeze wages in
this framework of accelerating living
costs and corporate gluttony works in-
calculable injury on the workers of the
nation and the American people as a
whole. '

“The brass workers want a genuine
roll-back and control of"-prices, genu-
ine taxation on corporations to take
the profits out of war, and adequate
wages arrived at by free and direct
collective bargaining.” - .

Copies of the letter went to mobiliza-
tion director Charles E. Wilson and

Rally to save Willie McGee ‘
  from framed-upiexecution

NEW YORK (FP)—An appeal for
executive ‘clemency for Willie McGee,
Negro ,worker who lost out in his
fourth attempt to win a U. S. Supreme
Court ‘review of his frame-up convic-
tion, has been made by Walter White
of the National Association for Ad-
vancement -of Colored" People.

In a wire to Gov. Fielding Wright
of Mississippi, White "said: “In view
of the uncertainties surrounding the
conviction of Willie McGee, the
NAACP urges you to grant executive
clemency as an act of mercy. In the
minds of millions in this country and
abroad,’ McGee’s guilt has not been
established.” "

Meantime, the New York Furriers
Joint Council §ent..a wire to President
Truman expressing “deep alarm at the
thrgtiened execution of Willie McGee.”
The Council represents 15,000 workers.

An emergency conference held here
by the Trade Union Committee to Save
Willie McGee adopted an intensive 30-
day program including a mass rally

April 16 and a delegation to Washing-‘

ton the following week. The commit-
tee said appeals for clemency should
be sent to the White ‘House.

, The United Electrical Workers Union
wired the President asking his inter-
cession with Governor Wright to stop
the execution. “If Willie McGe/e is put
to death,” said the UE message,
“Negro and white workers throughout

the country will have more reason, to

believe that the guarantee of equal
justice to all is being -sacrificed in

order to preserve a system of discrim- e

{nation and segregation.”

(Continued from Page 1)
this year to extend to all sections of
the industry a provision for the 8-hour

9 day, including paid lunch time, and

called for two additional paid holidays
to make’ a total of 8 paid holidays
throughout the-_ industry.

They; also proposed vacation clauses
providing for one week after one year’s
service, two weeks after two years, and
one additional day for each year of
service after 10 years. Cumulative paid
sickileave clauses providing for two
weeks a year will also be demanded.

It was agreed that all locals should
seek FEPC clauses in their contracts,
in line with a standard three—point
Mine-Mill clause, and that the union

shop be negotiated by all locals. The
conferees also agreed that “no contract
shall be signed for more than one year
and all contracts shall have at least
one wage reopener during the life of
the contract.”

A SERIES of improvements in griev-
ance procedures throughout the indus-
try was also drawn‘ up and approved
by both conferences.

The bargaining program was adopted

, after the Mining, Smelting & Refining

Conference had heard detailed reports
from each of the Mine-Mill bargaining
councils. Reporters included: .

The delegates heard Int’l vice presi-
dent Orville Larson, national bargain-
ing coordinator, declare  that “our

union is going to have to take a ‘fight-

ing position on collective bargaining
this year. The ranlc—and-file are de-
termined to break the wage freeze.
The bargaining situation is, in fact,
very bright because the entire labor
movement is becoming aroused to
where we are headed-—and they are
starting to do something about it.”
At the same time, the policy-making
conferences hammered out a mobiliza-
tion program, to make sure that bar-
gaining is handled in a coordinated
fashion. and that the union is ready for

_ strike action wherever it may become

necessary.

Conference delegates

DENVER, Colo.~—Delegates to the
Mining, Smelting and Refining confer-
ence here adopted a series of fighting
resolutions on wages, prices, taxes, civil
liberties, the copper “shortage,” and
peace.

They bitterly attacked the govern-
ment’s wage freeze “as part of an over-
all program to reduce the living stand-
ards of working people.” Calling atten-
tion to the fact that “millions of Amer-

ican workers are engaged in wage

struggles this year‘-—packing, railroad,
textile and other workers,” they said,
“They are fighting to regain lost stand-

ards of living, and they reject the argu-
ment that iii doing so they are in con-
flict with the interests of the American
people as a “whole.”

“Unlike wage stabilization in ,World
War II, which permitted many gains
to workers and even a_ slight increase
in living standards, the present policy,
conceived and executed by Big Busi-
ness, is deliberately planned to reduce
workers’ purchasing power. The order
asrissued, even if modified as suggest-
ed by the misleaders of the big federa-
tions of labor, only adds more ice to
the freeze. Our union already has won
higher increases than this figure.”

THEY AGREED that “a fight for
the Welfare of American and Canadian
working people is a patriotic duty of
v.-'orl«:ers’ organizations. The standard
of living of our Working people should
be the concern of every American who
is not hell-bent for profiteering.”

They declared that the government’s“

January price control order is “recog-
nized as a fraud by almost everyone
except those assignedto administer it.”

“An average member of our union
has to pay $15.12 today for a food has-
ket he could buy in 1946 for $9.13. In
other terms, he has to work one and
one-half hours longer now to buy that
basket of food.”

THE RESOLUTION compared the
reduced buying power of copper work-
ers’ wages with the situation of the 15

. largest non-ferrous corporations, which

made the staggering profit in 1950 of

* seek security and peace

$6.63 for every $1 they made in 1949.
The..<:onferees, all local and Interna-
tional union leaders, charged that the
1950 income ta}: increases were “shock-
ingly unfair, hitting the worker earn-
ing $57 weekly with a 20 per cent in-
crease, while the corpdration executive
earning $5,700 weekly saw his taxes go
up only 11.9 per cent.” "

They demanded revision of federal
tax laws “to require that those who
profit from the war program pay for it
through taxation. Any further increase
in individual income tax rates,” they
said, “should be confined to those with
incomes of $5,000 or more a year.”

THE CONFERENCE pledged “a
continuation of our union’s lbng traili-
tion of fighting for the rights of Ne-
groes, Mexican-Americans and other
minorities.” It demanded suspension of
the government’s copper stockpiling
program as one of a series of proposals
to end the layoffs and short work-
weeks in the Connecticut brass in-
dustry.

In a plea for peace, the delegates
said “we know the shadow of war hangs
over our conference and threatens ful-
fillment of our just and patriotic bar-
gaining demands. Just as we are con-
vinced that great gains can be made by
our members through free collective
bargaining, so we believe that peace
can be assured if the five great nations
of the world sit down to resolve their
differences in the give-and-take spirit
of genuine collective bargaining.”

Empire Zinc fails in

back-to-work move

BAYARD, N. M.——The strike against
Empire Zinc has now entered its sixth
month here, with the company buying
full-page advertisements in the local
newspaper in an attempt to start a
back-to-work movement.

However, the company is wasting its
money, since the strike lines continue

'to hold firm. Not a single scab has

entered the E-Z operation since the
start of the strike. ' -

, ‘ -Powers That’Be, bill‘. this Korean _busi-
 - ness. from start to finish—and the fin-

vish'~is "not" yet—-is an all-time low.
Everything about this undeclared war,

 the war itself, the fake “controls” and

"mobilization” business growing out of

-- it is a colossal fraud and hoax inflicted‘

upon the American people.

The big financial interests control-.

ling the State Department and,the Ad-
niinistratioir maneuvered to_ get this
.Korean “war _going for several reasons:
One," they needed a" war in order‘ to
staveioff a depression they feared they
7-might not survive. Two, any \var is
good -business for Big Business, and
the astounding profits which have al-
ready come to Big Businesson the basis
of thisiwar are sufficient proof of that.
Three, a war provides an excellent op-
portunity to demand more taxes and
many other sacrifices fronr the com-
mon people. And four, and to union
'men perhaps most important, a war
provides an excuse to regiment labor,
to get laws enacted which will prevent
free collective bargaining, destroy the
effectiveness of unions, and make Big
Business and the government a part-
nership against union» people and the
common people, generally. . ‘

There‘ is one more reason, of course,

"but least important of all——the reason
that the financiers are scared silly at
the very idea of communism, and hope
to suppress this idea by military‘ force
all over the world. However, they lie
when they say that they expect mili-
tary aggression by any communist
force—they know there is no danger
of that.

Whatvshould any "decent worker and
union man think of the utter devasta-
tion our troops have wrought in Korea-
——the civilian population slaughtered—
women, children "and old people bombed
out of their homes -and forced out into
the open country in the dead of winter
to die of cold and privation ?t -I ask any
decent_ union brother——do you approve
of ' such horrible atrocities? Do you

\ think the whole thing necessary?

5 Finally, there is the question—should ii

"We pull our troops out of. Korea? Of
_ course we should. It is, the only decent
act left for us to do. ‘The human mis-
ery they have caused—the wrongs they
have already done can never be paid
for. _ ‘ —. '

Here, is a copyiof a letter*I,am writ-

ing today to Hon. Carl.‘Vins,on, chair-

I feel that every.:American'soldier

in Korea should be‘ brought home at ‘T

i once, and that America should get out
of Korea entirely and allow the people
of_Korea to attend to their own inter-_
nal affairs. _ I - ’

I am’ also‘ iunalterably opposed to
sending any troops to Europe for any
purpose. I also feel the President of
the United ‘States’ should, not have the
power to send ‘any troops any place,

. wit-hout rthe consent of Congress.‘ Our
Constitution says Congress, and only

~‘ Congress, has the ‘right to make policy,
and I think. it is high time that Con-
gress take over anddo just this. .

‘ Yes, I am ‘opposed to higher taxes
and I, think price control’, with a roll-
fback’ of ‘prices to a pre-Korea level, is

day similar to former Adolf? Who is
. comrade Joe Stalin.

What Lenin and Stalin wrote in their
writing. I was a young communist and
I had to study their writings. They
said: “There shall.not be peace as long

" as we are surrounded by capitalistic
world.” “Either Capitalism or Commu-
nism will survive and triumph upon

'one’s defeat.” ' _

When Soviet ruler Vb seeking for
that, how can we repulse and prevent
it, by disarming? by pulling out
troops from ‘Europe? That would mean
real suicide to our Continent and our
Freedom. We should not leave Europe
against Soviet threat. If we do it we
would have to fight a war later, pos-
sibly on this continent, and alone. That
would mean a slavery to Western Eu- ’

ard war for us. -’

No, brothers, we can not prevent a
war with Soviet Russia by disarma-
ment and pulling out our troops from
Europe. .

I was born in Eastern Europe. I had

‘ enough of that war—-I lost my parents,
sisters, brothers and home. I know the
meaning of a war. I have no illusions

about it. I have seen mass graves
opened for investigation of the victims
of Soviet rule, after I saw prisoners of
war dying in German captivity, also I
saw those consentration camps. And I
heard the fearceful ratling machine’
guns of Ger’man SS fire Squads aimed

‘at Jewishwomen, children and men. It
was awful. I do not want to see that
any more.

“All the ‘peace Conferences’ have
failed and will fail as long as’ Soviets‘
seek for Conquest of free world. And
the only solution is to prepare foryany

/eventuality-—that is armaming-

To\.he Editor:

_ How an peace be won? This is the
paramo nt question‘ today. A very
proper question» to pose to the members
of our Union. Because it is the work-
ers ’finally who paythe frightful price
of war. - - «*-

I modestly submit the following an-
swers:

First, by the immediate unconditional
withdrawal of all foreign troops from
Korea and Europe. ' _

Second, by‘ according to China the

 

same treatment and respect we demand
for ourselves———that implies recognition
of her sovereign"rights including a seat
in the Council of the United Nations.

Third, by convening a conference of
the Five Big Powers—U.S.A., U.S.S.R.,
China, Great Britain and’France.

Fourth, by taxing to the hilt every
damn cent of war profits.

Fifth, by changing our economic set-

up from one of a “war economy” to

that of a “peace economy” To trans-
fer the billions allocated for murderous

' armament production to the production

of civilian goods for Americans to use
and enjoy—dece'nt homes and enot
of them; more schools and better ones;
hospitals, sufficient for all who need
them without having to. bankrupt our-
selves, and so on. And finally, wage in-
creases on a _scale enabling the workers
to buy back their full share of this
production.

_ To the Editor:

I am writing you my opinion about
the economic situation in this country.
It seems that we are moving further
down the road to fascism each day.
With the abandonment of the fight for
civil rights and with the right of free
speech being taken away to _be re-
placed by thought controls it is almost
complete. While we engage in a so-
called war for freedom our own is be-_
ing taken away. With a phony price
control bill a wage cutting wage freeze
and even" higher ‘taxes on the workers’
while profits go higher and higher en-
dangering further our living standards.

The fight for freedom is one that
should begin at home where fifteen mil-
lion Negroes are far from being free.
As I am a Negro this means every-
thing to me.

We suffer from lack of housing, in-
effuality in educational facilities and).
lower living standard. This is where
the administration should begin, not
thousands of miles away.

DURING the 1946 strike against .the Elizabeth, N. J ., plant of Phelps
Dodge, gangsters employed by the company killed a UE picket
named Mario Russo. Other strikers carry scars inflicted by goons who
were paid $250 a day for this service to PD. The man. in charge of
clubbing and murdering was paid $1,000 a day.

These gangsters, with their guns, clubs and blackjacks, were
ferried to their “work” regularly by New York harbor police.

The $1,000-a-day director of finks was Anthony Anastasia, one of
of the two most notorious gangst , brothers in New York. When he
failed to break the strikers’ moral Anastasia was authorized by Wiley
Brown, PD president, to negotiate a settlement. ‘

_ THESE SHOCKING and outrageous facts were known to many
Mine-Mill members befofe the Kefauver committee, revealed them. We

deal with Phelps Dodge, too.

But the important thing brought out by this committee was not
what Phelp Dodge did, or Ford, or any other corporation. The impor-
tant r‘evelation was a pattern of corruption—-use of gangsters to fight
unions, and use of politicians to subvert all branches of goverpment to

their own ends.

The Kefauver committee has hardly scratched the surface. Yet
their most significant findings have been ignored or played down by
the commercial press. For this reason‘ we present on this page a few

and corruption of government.

DETROIT, Mich.—New evidence has
been revealed here that auto manufac-

_turers spend fortunes in subsidizing‘

gangsters whom they use to fight
unions. ~
Briggs Mfg. Co. has used the Perrone
brothers—Santo, Gaspar and Matthew
.-—-for years, according to -an article in
Ammunition, published by the United
Auto Workers. Thugs recruited by
these brothersvhave given brutal lead-

members.

When the Perrone brothers were
picked up by the Treasury Dept. for
their part in an alcohol racket and sent

Stove Co. sent their wives regular

ONE METHOD of paying off gang-

..the story of Carl Renda, son-in-law of
‘Santo Perrone. Renda, who knew noth-

ing of the scrap metal business; sud-
denly was given the $2 million a year

_"" “‘For a.time, Renda was permitted

 over the highest. The firms which had

worth perhaps $2 million a year, can-
tinwed without interruption to haul

self as a.‘ broker, forcing the old

$1,000-A-DAY STRI-KEBREAK—.

ER. Senate crime probers in
New York heard testimony of
Waterfront racketeer Anthony
Anastasia, whom unionists ac-
cused of receiving $1,000 a day
as / strikebreaker during 1946
Phelps-Dodge strike of UE.

Resolution on use of gangsters“ by
‘Phelps-Dodge Copper‘ Products Corp.

In,the recent hearings before the
Kefauver Crime Committee, Anthony_
Anastasia testified that he had a con-
tract with the Phelps-Dodge Copper
Products Corp. for trucking and haul-
age between the company’s plants in
Yonkers, New York, and Elizabeth,
New Jersey.

' Anthony Anastasia and his brothers

have been notorious gangsters in New 7

York, especially on the waterfront, for
many years. It has been charged that
they have been responsible for many

- murders and that they have not been

brought to justice because of their po-
litical connections.

It was also sworn before the we Ke-
fauver Committee that Anastasia and
his goons were used to break the strike
of the UE in Elizabeth in 1946, that
they- made many violent attacks on
peaceful picketing, and that they were
responsible forthe shooting and killing
of one of these pickets. Anastasia also

on direct authority from Wiley Brown,
President of the Phelps-Dodge Copper
Products Corp. at that time.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:

1. We believe that the tie-up between
big business and big gangsterdom vio-
[ates all decency and puts big business
itself in the position of subsidizing
gangsterism in American life.

2. We denounce particularly the use
of notorious gangsters by the Phelps-
Dodge Copper, Products Corp- for
strike-breaking purposes and to kill and
maim American workerse seeking to
improve their standards of living.

3. We call upon the Phelps-Dodge
Copper Products Corp. to abrogate any
contracts it may have with Anastasia or
with any other such characters, and not
to use such means for subsidizing anti-
labor racketeers and murderers.

Wu-I-erfronf rackets

NEW YORK (FP) —— The “-S e n a t e
crime investigating c o m m i t t e e ad-
journed its New York hearings without

Ryan of the Intl. Longshoremen’s Assn.
(AFL) or digging into charges that
dock-workers are the, victims of water-
front rackets and terror tha flou1_'_ish
under the protection of city 0 cials.

The committee heard frequent allu-
sions to. mob control of the waterfront
and -explored briefly why ex-mayor
William O’Dwyer (D.) during his reign
as Brooklyn district attorney failed to
prosecute the murderers of Peter Panto,
rank-and-file ILA leader.

Ryan,_who sat through the commit-
tee’s last three sessions without being
called, complained that nothing had
been said about ‘his administration’s
fight against the “worst kind of crime”
—“the danger of Communist control.”

THE COMMITTEE questioned
O’Dwyer on the failure to act on the
murder of Panto, whose body was dis-
covered in 1941 after his mysterious
disappearance " in 1939. The ex-mayor
said the case became inadequate after
the‘ mysterious death of key witness
Abe Reles, who fell or was pushed from
a hotel window while under police
guard. ‘ ‘

  $1.ooo.a day,
for murder

NEW YORK (FP)—How the Phelps-‘

Dodge Co. used a notorious waterfront
racketeer to round up scabs and thugs
in an’ attempt to break .-a strike in‘
1946, during which one union __member
was murdered," and then authorized the
racketeer ‘to settle it, was revealed to
the Kefauver Senate crime investigat-
ing committee March 19. ,

The story of the $1,000-a-day strike-
breaker, Anthony Anastasia, was given
to the committee at the end of a long
day of testimony during most of which
former Mayor William O’Dwy'er (D)
occupied the hot seat. Among the ques-
tions put to O’Dwye'r, now ambassador
to Mexico, wasgwhy nothing was ever
done to prosecute Anthony’s brother,
Albert, “chief high executioner” of
Murder Inc., who was involved in the
slaying of Peter Panto, rank-and-file
leader of the Intl. Longshoremen’s
Assn. (AFL). ‘ '

(Chief witness againt Anthony Anas-
ta‘sia: was Theodore Narushef, former
officer of the Phelps-Dodge local of the
United Electrical Radio & Machine
Workers. He described the niurder of
UE member Mario Russo during the
strike, which lasted eight months and
was finally won by the union.

THE STRIKE was at the company’s
Bayw’ay plant in Elizabeth, N. J., lo-.
cated on New York harbor, and much
of the picketing was done by boat.
Narushef told how the picket boat was
pursued by a motor launch load_ed with
Anastasia and “about 25 thugs and
goons” armed with baseball bats.

“So, from then on,” Narushef testi-
fied, “it was really a continuous chase.
We would 1. go-alongside the pier, and
this Anastlisia and his boats come in
with gangsters and goons and strike-
bneakers from New York, from Brook-
lyn, and they would always start throw-
ing missiles at us; and on numerous
occasions they fired at the pickets.”

The unionist-said the strikers made

‘ nume'rous complaints tb the police, but
nothing was done.
the thugs used the harbor police boat
as a ferry service to New York.

IT WAS DURING one of the shoot-
ing attacks that Russo was slain. No-
body was ever prosecuted for the mur-
der despite the evidence of the UE

strikers and their complaints against-~

Anastasia. Narushef said the gangster
was arrested on a charge of assaulting
striker Bertram Eckstein, but a Capt.
Winkelman of the Elizabeth police
force supplied Anastasia with an alibi.

Anastasia was then called to the
stand. ‘He admitted being arrested once
“in connection with . . . some work in
Jersey, Elizabeth, N. J.’.’ Asked What

it Was about, Anastasiareplied: “Some -

labor They accused me, some Com.
munists, They accused me; a guy hurt
somebody over there." He admitted
the charge was a ' “felonious assault
with an iron pipe,” but added: “I come
out free from the grand jury.”

Mohtana locals gain
in '5l state legislature *

BUTTE, Mont.-—Men1bers of Mine-
Mill locals in Montana last week were
studying the overall results of the 32nd
state legislature, in which ‘our’ union
campaigned for its program n10revig-

' orously than ever before.

 _. Mine-Mill program

:-

Shortly before the assembly con_-
vened, the 11 Montana MMSW locals

' held a legislative conference in Helena,

at which ‘a full-scale - program ‘was
adopted,land a continuations comniittee
set up, I

The‘ continuations committee, as-
sisted;by board member William Mason
and other International union staff
members, pressed for adoption of. the

Legislature‘ convened. ' . /
HOWEVER, the Mine‘-Mill lobbyists
met with powerful opposition, with the
Republican majority in both houses and
the many “corporation Democrats”
gauging up to kill or cripple most of
the Mine-Mill sponsored bills.
Mine-Mill did succeed in scoring some
gains, though. Biggest gain was in
passageof thebill to cut the discount
on lump_ sum payments to disabled
workers. This can mean’ morla than—'$1,-
300 to every permanently disabled

worker. Compensation payments -were ‘

hiked _$1.50.a week; we obtained a
“second injury” law with a reserve

- . fund of $20,000 to -pay benefits to par-

tially disabled workers who may re-
ceive further injuries on the job; we

won,.a1ithorization for a commission to
draft indhstrial safety codes; and we -

obtained a
of Labor.

’ These were the gains. Probably our

A

separate State Departmbnt

..

after the Montana ’

most serious defeats were our failure
to get. any increase in payments to

victims of silicosis, and our failure to ‘

get increased payments to the aged
and other needy people. Of course,
blame for these failures rests squarely
on the reactionary members of the.leg-
islature.
Probably our greatest gain was not
social legislation, but political experi-
u once. Our members who were active in
pressing for our legislative proggam
learned to find their way around in the
state political scene. They learned
where help can be obtained; where po-
/litical allies can be found; they learned
to distinguish friends from enemies.

And fLna1ly, and by no means least
important, they built something of a
united front with other sections of la-
bor—the AFL, the.UMW, the railroad
men and the Montana Farmers’ Union
—a united front which can be further
cemented in futurelegislative sessions.

Pruitt is victim
of press hysteria

Kl~‘.Ll‘.OGG-, Idaho——Fred Pruitt, fi-
nzmcial secretary of Mine-Mill Local 18,
was recently the innocent victim of a
deliberate attempt on the part of the

.« «- Shoshone Tribune to
whip up war hysteria
among its readers in
this area.

The Tribune printed
a fantasy-story with
big bold headlines as-
serting that the Red3
Army had invaded the .
U. S. west coast. The
fantasy, patterned,
'  after Orson Welles’
ill-fated “Man from Mars" broadcast,
was clearly intended to create an at-
mosphere that would make it possible
for vigilante activities to be explained
as “patriotism.”

The first violence to follow publica-
tion of the Tribune story occurred after
a dance sponsored by Local 18 here.
Pruitt was assaulted from behind and’
almost blinded by fragments of his
glasses which were smashed.

_ Only a few hours later an explosion
rocked Kellogg when the house trailer
owned by Fred Marchant, also an active
union member, was dynamited. Fortu-
nately Marchant was not in his trailer
at the time. But there is every evidence
that the" dynamiter intended to kill.

The printers union local here classi-
fies the Shoshone Tribune as a scab
paper because of its anti—union activ-
ities. It is.now running a serial called
“The Silver Strike,” a book published “
nearly 20 years ago to glamorize "the
Pinkertons as heroes for killing early-
day union miners. A
