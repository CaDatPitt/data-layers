filled with thousands of unionists, environmentalists, students, women, men,
vchildrena-in short, people from all walks of life will be marching and demon—
strating together to demand "KEEP THREE MILE ISLAND SHUT DOWN!" The character
of this demonstration, sponsored by the Greater Harrisburg Labor Committee
.fpr,Safe Energy and Full Employment and ten international unions, is one of
La peaceful, legal action. To ensure the safety of the participants and the
smooth flow of the march and rally, a large number of volunteers will-be re-
cruited from the_march participants, both from the Harrisburg area and those
coming from other places. -

iEach bus should designate a Bus Captain, and this Captain should recrui
at least ten other persons to participate in the marshalling tasks. - A
There will be continous orientation sessions at the march assembly site where
this will be organized on the morning of the demonstration. There will be ad-
,vance training sessions the week prior to the march for the Harrisburg area
volunteers. These volunteers would be helping to: 1) greet the incoming
busses; 2) maintain a steady flow of people along the march route; 3) provide
direction 3 4) protect the rally and assembly site facilities; 5) prevent
any incidents from developing, through persuasion and large numbers, that could
mar the peaceful character of this demonstration. ‘

To avoid unnecessary problems there will be no alcoholic beverages.
drugs or weapons allowed at the assembly site, along the march route,
or at the rally site. ’

- FUNDRAISING I . . ’

Due to the enormous costs of organizing and publicity, the Labor Committee
for Safe Energy and Full Employment will be organizing sales of commemorative
T—shirts and buttons, designed by cartoonist Jules Feiffer. We welcome any ’
