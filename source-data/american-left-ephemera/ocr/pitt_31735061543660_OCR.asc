because scores of men and women in Russia, besides those
executed following the criminal assassination of Kirov, faced
new rigors of imprisonment or surveillance. The things that
disturb us sorely arise in part from the very nature of
bureaucratic dictatorship. We are disturbed by the terrible
costliness of the process of agricultural collectivization. You
cannot, our Communist friends, come before America, and
tell American workers, in the country or in the city, that
the price of a desirable agricultural collectivization is a loss
of perhaps one to ﬁve million lives—an unnecessary loss of
life, it seems to me, in view of all the facts.

These things trouble us, and it is because of these ten-
dencies that we have observed in Communism, that we cry
out, “The Socialist way is the way for American workers to
follow at the present time.”

And We are disturbed, too, at the record that Commun-
ism has made outside of Russia. Oh, by no means is it all
bad. I want nowto express what I have expressed a score
of times before, namely, my admiration for the courage, the
gallantry, the devotion with which Communists have pushed
their cause. It is something from which all of us can learn
(applause) but at the same time, that cause has been pushed
in a Way to bring disruption into labor’s ranks. —

Suppose the line that Comrade Browder is going to
advocate tonight had been advocated in Germany ﬁve years
ago, six years ago, seven years ago, might not history have
been different»? Suppose that the present Communist posi-

tion about a united people's front had been taken earlier? .

I think then there would have been no time when Commu-
nists and Nazis made common cause, as they did in one or
two strikes and elections in Germany, notably in the famous
Prussian plebiscite or referendum. History might have-been
different if this new line had been adopted earlier there. I
do not acquit the German Social Democrats, from all the
responsibility for the tragic failure, when I say that the
primary cause of the bitter division in labor ranks was the
sectarian line, the insistence that it was not Fascism, but
the Social Fascists, that is to say, the Social Democrats, who
were the peril. And something of the same sort has been
true here. Reaction in the American Trade Union movement
has been intensiﬁed by Communist disruptive tactics in
unions. We have had altogether too much of an anything-
to-win attitude. Lies and slander were holy if they were in

-10-

 

a good cause. As for myself, I don’t recognize myself any
more when I read the “Daily Worker.” (Laughter and ap-
plause) Either I have changed so that my wife would
scarcely know me, or something has changed.

Now, you will think perhaps that I am exaggerating.
Let me therefore refer to Communist sources. ‘The question
is what to quote out of the innumerable Communiststate—
ments about Socialists, about united fronts, about trade
unions, and the rest. Here, for instance, I am quoting from
“The Communist," January, 1933. (It is a good paper, Com-
rade Browder, honest, frank, and it tells you everything.)
(Laughter) It says—mind you, this is in January, 1933,
remember the date: “Therefore, to beat the enemy, the
bourgeoisie, we must direct the main blow against its chief
social bulwark, against the chief enemy of Communism in
the working class, against Social Democracy, against Social
Fascism.” There is more of it, but that will do, I am in a
hurry.

Here, in August of 1933, I read: “The Workers Ticket
is not a form of labor party. We must be very careful to

closely examine every one of these applications of the idea .

of a Workers Ticket and make sure that the comrades are
not using it as a way of stopping the ﬁght against the Labor
Party idea. We want no peace with the Labor Party idea.”
August, 1933.

And here a few words about the united front: “The
United Front is not the peace pact with reformists. The
United Front is a message of struggle against the reform-
ists, against the Social Fascists for the‘ possession of the
masses,” and so on. Then they talk a little about the Mus-
teites, and they say (have you forgotten them ?), “Precisely
why we refuse the united front with them is because we
must take their followers away from them.”

And here, in February, 1934, after Hitler was in power,
after his tyranny was well begun, I read, “Social Democrats
continue to play the role of the main social prop of the bour-
geoisie also in the countries of open fascist dictatorship.”
That was in 1934. .

And here in Comrade Browder’s excellent report to the
Communist Party at its eighth convention, I read something
that interests me: “A united front with Norman Thomas
and his leaders to develop strike struggles with the workers
would be immediately wrecked by the statement of Norman

_.1]_‘_..

Thomas, ‘Now is not the time to strike, etc.’ That means that
unity must be built up not with these leaders, but against
them.” That is at the eighth convention, which was held
April 2nd to 8th, 1934, long after Hitler was in power.
Molotoff in 1930 said that the “essence of the tactics of
class against class consists in the rejection of all alliances
with Social Democracy.”

Why do I read this? Simply because we shall not make
progress in the future unless we realize that the past cannot
be simply ignored. We cannot declare a complete mora-
torium upon it. (Applause.)

I have here also a copy of Comrade Browder’s good
book, and again I recommend it to you as thoroughly worth
studying. It is, I am convinced, an honest and careful at-
tempt to work out the problems before us, but in it I am a
little confused. On page 120 the New Deal is well under
way and is described as essentially fascist, yet when Com-
rade Browder came back from Russia, he advised Roosevelt
that his enemies were the Fascists!

Just a few lines further on, I read, “Here we have the
sharpest example -of the role of the Socialist Party in Trade
Union bureaucracy, the role of Social Fascists who paved
the way for the establishment of Fascist control over the
masses.” Now, Comrade Browder, I hope I get better year
by year, but I have not gotten so much better in so short a
time. When did I stop being a social fascist?

But on page 124, I read that “hundreds of our lower
organizations still take a certain pride in the fact that they
have no contact whatever with the workers of the Socialist
Party.” This attitude the author rebukes. Anyway, he
wanted to do missionary work even at that time to redeem
us, and that, I suppose, is hopeful.

I repeat, my friends, it is necessary to understand this
past in order to understand the present. But after these
quotations were written there came a change of line. Those
of you who have followed the ‘enormously important pro-
ceedings of the last Communist International will probably
remember the candor with which the change to a new line
was stated. Here, in the proceedings I ﬁnd—and I shall not
take time to read it,—a frank statement that does credit to
any party acknowledging certain mistakes, mistakes in Ger-
many, mistakes in other countries. We rejoice that that
statement has been made, but we want to know now just

—12—

 

what the new line is. Here we are confused. We are con-
fused by the nature and magnitude of the change, by the
far point in the arc to which the pendulum has swung. Much
of the change, the change in favor of cooperation, in favor
of fair discussion of difficulties—is all to the good. It may
mean the difference between life and death for some of us
in this hall. Other changes are less praiseworthy.

When Atheists or Protestants turn Catholic, they be-
come more Catholic than the Pope himself. I don't know
whether that is what happened to my Communist friends,
or whether it is just a maneuver as some of my Socialist
friends would have me believe, but, anyhow, there is cer-
tainly a change. It appears that Communists now go in for
democracy in a big way, all over the country. They are all
for democracy now, they are for the united front with every-
body they can get. (I quote, for instance, from the New
York platform of the Communist Party.) “The hour de-
mands the building of the broadest people’s front, uniting
workers, farmers, unemployed, professionals, small business-
men, Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Socialists, Communists,
Democrats, Republicans, a people’s front, ﬁghting in the

interests of the common people, the working people, and the '

poor farmers.” (Applause.) Yes, it's good to have a peo-
ple’s front. But at what price? Can We afford to encourage
the illusion that if you only go out and ﬁght against some-
thing a miscellaneous crowd dislikes you win something!
Wasn’t that just the mistake with which we Socialists were
charged: that we were too concerned with class collabora-
tion in defending what we had and not enough concerned
with winning something new and vital?

Are your peop1e’s“fronts to be so inclusive as the invita-
tion I’ve read? Can you stay a Republican and be in there?
How can you have a people’s front that will serve the great
cause of the emancipation of the workers if it is to include
Democrats and Republicans? That interesting Labor Party
experiment in the recent San Francisco municipal election
did include Democratic clubs and it wrote down its platform,
leaving out certain planks so as not to offend possible Dem-
ocratic supporters. The result was not a striking success.

Here is a leaﬂet from Pittsburgh, new style Communist
propaganda. It has a picture of Joe Louis and I need not
describe him to anybody, Warnecke, the baseball player, and
in the middle the very attractive picture of Carolyn Hart,

...13_..

 

twenty-three year old candidate on the Communist ticket
for City Councillor of Pittsburgh, “who packs a mighty wal-
lop.” It is interesting, but I wonder what Joe Louis and
Warnecke think about this sort of pictorial united front. I
know what Communists would have said a little while ago if
Socialists had issued such a leaflet.

Is it possible to build so inclusive, so democratic a united
front you now propose and still get the results we want in
face of the failures we have had? Why not go in the Demo-
cratic Party of New York, which is pretty much of a Peo-
ple's Front anyhow, and be done with it?

Oh, there is some answer to what I have said which
Comrade Browder may give but not a convincing answer.
I have expressed my belief in democracy, a greater belief in
the power of democracy, probably than in the last
analysis Earl Browder holds, but I don't believe that
democracy, certainly not bourgeois democracy, is even
temporarily a satisfactory alternative to Fascism or
a satisfactory defense against it. We have got to
attack, and the alternative is Socialism or Fascism,
not democracy or Fascism, as would seem to be the
case in the new Communist line. Now We turn to’ a very
important matter near to my heart. Itis the matter of war.
One of the things I have admired, although I have not al-
ways agreed with it in toto, about the Communist Party,
ever since the days before it was a deﬁnite party, ever since
the‘Zimmerwa1d Congress, was its opposition to war and its
clear insight .into the capitalist nature of war. But now,
what do I ﬁnd? Well, let's see the present stand of Russia
about Italy. Russia is in the League of Nations. And
will I ever forget What the “Daily Worker” used to say about
any Socialist who had a good word to say about the League
of Nations! Russia, like some of the other League nations,
is selling oil, and other of its raw materials, to Mussolini
for war.

Clarence Streit, in a dispatch from Geneva, says: “The
movement against extending the raw materials embargo
against Italy to include oil, coal and steel, gained force today
in the weight of mounting United States responsibility in
the matter, urged by Russia and Roumania, who are Italy's

, chief suppliers of oil. They led in informing Geneva this

afternoon that they were ready to make this extension
whenever all the other producers, League of Nations mem-

—-.14-—

 

 

bers and non-members, did the same.” Is that the stand of
a Socialist State in the making, that they have to wait for
the rest of the capitalist countries to do something good,
and they will follow? That it is all right to make money
out of the slaughter of men as long as other nations do the
same? That is not the way I learned Socialism and opposi-
tion to war.

I know the dangers that beset Communist Russia, and
I know why Stalin has to take advantage of capitalist im-
perialist strife between nations. But when the Soviet Repub-
lic made a military pact with that dishonest broker, Laval
of France, something happened which seriously compro-
mised the old Communist position. Worse followed. Stalin
gave out a statement which says: “M. Stalin understands
and fully approves the national defense policy of France in

’ keeping her armed forces on a level required for security.”

In other words, we have an endorsement of an army which
in bourgeois France is still a probable source of Fascist
trouble, an endorsement of an army under a Premier who
even now is probably double-crossing Russia! That is the
kind of thing that troubles Socialists, that attitude on Italy,
that attitude of the endorsement of military preparations
in bourgeois countries. 4

We are told that the reason for it is that it is all im-
portant to defend the Soviet Republic. For instance, Harry
Pollitt, writing in the English “Labor Monthly,” says,
“When the war situation arises again, then the defense of
the Soviet Union will become the chief permanent considera-

tion of every working man and woman in a capitalist coun-

try. (App1ause.) I don’t want to be misunderstood. I want
thedefense of Russia, but I say as solemnly as I know how,
when the. defense of Russia is the chief consideration of
workers in every country, you are not going to defend Rus-
sia, or the best in Russia. You are too much on the defen-
sive. The chief consideration is to organize the workers
against capitalism, against Fascism, against war, for world
wide socialism.

I know that there are some distinctions that Comrade
Browder will probably want to make. In 1914 there was no
Soviet country, but British Socialists thought they had to
defend something precious against imperialism, and German
Socialists thought they had to defend something precious
against Czarism. We have tried the way of war to make

--15-

the world safe for democracy as against imperialism. Must
we try it again with slightly different verbal dressings to
make the world safe against Fascism? Since when have
Marxists learned the doctrine of the State so as to believe
that workers in minority parties can turn capitalistic armies
into red armies before those armies have been defeated as
in Czarist Russia? That is what must be considered very
carefully. It imperils the great contribution which the Com-
munists have made in the understanding of the fundamental
nature of war as the evil product not simply of fascism but
of capitalist-nationalism.

The time allotted me is nearly up and I have not by any
means said all the things I should like to say, nor for that
matter, quoted all I might want to quote, but it would not
be fair to sit down unless I spoke speciﬁcally on the question
that so concerns so many of us, namely, the question of the
united front. (Applause.) Any man who is not a fool wants
the maximum of joint action, not only for Socialists and
Communists, but for everyone. We want the maximum of
joint action, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Republicans, Dem-
ocrats, Socialists, Communists, to see to it that we bring
home to the German people the lesson we ought to bring
home, by stopping the Olympic Games in Berlin. That is a
united front we can agree on. (Applause)

We have had a fairly successful united front lately in
the matter of Angelo Herndon, condemned to the living hell
(applause) of a chain gang in Georgia for no offense except
for daring to organize the unemployed. Who of us is free
while he faces that fate ? ‘

If we cannot get a new committee under a new arrange-
ment for the defense of the Scottsboro boys, I don't think
it will be the Socialists who will block it. I am afraid that
the trouble will lie elsewhere, and it won't lie in the Com-
munist Party either.

These are practical things. It may sometime be prac-
tical here to negotiate a general united front. It has been
practical in France. (Applause.) It has been practicable
in France because there Socialists and Communists com-
bined are powerful enough almost by themselves to stop
fascism. It has been practicable in France because Stalin
needed such a front if he were going to risk a military alli-
ance of any sort with capitalist France.

I would like more freedom of fair minded criticism in
the people’s front, and it troubles me a little to see our Com-
munist friends make more love to Herriot than to Leon
Blum. They are jumping a little too far to the right when
they prefer progressives to Socialists.

Our situation is different. Our task is to win the
workers. Can we do it better if we spend our time trying to
negotiate a hypothetical united front agreement? Should
we not see ﬁrst just what kind of a united front is wanted
by our Communist friends, whether it is the version of
November 1935, or the version of November 1933? And
there is a large difference between them. We are warranted
in asking that those of you who are realists, who want not
a formal thing, who want not some victory to talk about, but
who want real achievement in America, will prove good faith
by speciﬁc agreements on speciﬁc and vital issues. There
are differences between us, differences in our estimate of
some values, differences in the road that we would take.
There are important differences now upon the terms on
which a Labor Party ought to be built and how far we can
go in a general inclusiveness.

I for one like to see you Communists reach out hands -

to the masses who follow Father Divine, but you have not
convinced, me that when you who are foes of religion, you,
who most of you are convinced atheists, make common
cause with God for that is what Father Divine says he is
—that you advance that understanding with colored work-
ers, which you must have, if they are not to be taken away
from you by some demagogue or some incipient fascist.
There are differences, and important differences, for us
to thresh out by discussion and experience carried on in good
faith. There are important things for us to learn, which, as
yet neither of us, Communists or Socialists, have learned,
namely, the way to persuade men who now think they are
of the middle class, that their hope is the hope of a reward
as workers; to teach the farmers of America that the way
out, the way of abundance, is the way of Socialism. I don’t
think we will do it best if we spend too much time talking
about formulas and too little time working at the job that
cries out to be done. Let’s work at that job, differing where
we must, stating our differences frankly and fairly, avoid-
ing scurrilous abuse of one another. Let’s work at the job
as men who haven't many years at hand. Let’s work at the‘

_.17_

 

job of making America Socialist, before war or some new
clash will give rise to that new American fascism which I
fear will be more brutal even than Europe knows.

It is a man-sized. job. I rejoice that after tonight we
ought not have to divert so much energy into bitter war
with each other, but I don’t think that the time has come
for a formal united front, and I know that all differences

' have not been erased between us. Let’s go ahead and make

the party win which will best bring to earth plenty and free-
dom and peace to men. Let’s go ahead and make the
party win which best knows how to bring a fellowship of
free‘ men, a society not of weak, though possibly well fed
serfs, under a bureaucracy but a society of men who know
how to settle with each other their difficulties, who know
how to be tolerant of differences of opinion, provided we
can get cooperation in harnessing machinery for life and
abundance, and not for destruction and death. (Applause
and cheering). ’

Chairman Krzycki: You have just heard Norman

Thomas who is generally accepted as the spokesman for the _

Socialist Party of the United States.

The Communists likewise, in looking over their ﬁeld of
spokesmen, men who are well informed on this subject be-
fore us, saw ﬁt to draft for this occasion their outstanding
ﬁgure, Comrade Earl Browder, the General Secretary of the
Communist Party. (Applause and cheering).

The audience arose and applauded.

OPENING SPEECH OF EARL BROWDER_

EARL BROWDER: Comrade Chairman, Comrades and

’ Friends, Comrade Thomas is indeed correct when he
says it is a big step forward-that this debate could be held,
but it is a big step only from the point of view of the past.
It is a small. step from the point of View of what we need,
that is, in spite of all disagreements, to establish a real
united front between the Socialists and the Communists.
(Applause). This is what the American working class needs.
This is what we are ﬁghting for. This is what we will con.-
tinue to ﬁght for, despite all points of disagreement which
still remain. -

Comrade Thomas spoke about sincerity and good; faith.
Well, we are sure that fascism sincerely wants to crush the
working class in the United States. We can discuss for ten
years about sincerity and not progress so far as we would in
six months of serious united front work. (Applause). A
few weeks of united effort to save Angelo Herndon has done
more to prove sincerity than years of argument could have
done. That is what the experience of the Italian Communist
Party and Socialist Party and French Socialists and Com-
munists was. Joint work will quickly remove anything that
is personal, prejudiced and a hang-over of the past political
ﬁght between the two parties. -

We have tonight already been given enough ground to
prove the possibility to build now such a united front. Com-
rade Thomas declares that we have a common enemy. Well,
against that common enemy, a common ﬁght. That means
united front. Comrade Thomas declares that we have the
common task of winning the American working class to
Socialism. From this follows the united front to win the
American working class for Socialism. He opposes the red-

baiters in the American Federation of Labor and in the I

Socialist Party, because he believes it is damaging to the
American working class. Very well, let's ﬁght together
against this fascist poison, which, if it succeeds will hang
all the Reds, among whom will be not only Foster and Brow-
der, but also Norman Thomas, whether he calls himself a
Red or not. (Applause). And we are afraid they wouldn't
even spare Jim Oneal. (Laughter). '
Why is the United Front the central, all-dominating
question today in the United States and throughout the
world? Because of the danger of fascism and war. Com-
rades, I must say that I missed in the presentation of the
spokesman for the Socialist Party a deep feeling of the
urgency of the situation. He seems to feel that we have
plenty of time. But this is not true, comrades. Time presses”.
Comrades, fascism is coming in America if we do not unite
to prevent its coming. Reaction is making headway. The
Liberty League, backed by the Morgan-duPont interests, are
doing their utmost to bring fascism into this country. Even
today, under the Roosevelt administration, striking miners
and sharecroppers are murdered in the South, longshoremen
are slugged and killed wherever they attempt to strike for
the improvement of their conditions. The open-shoppers are

mobilizing all their forces to prevent the organization of
the unorganized and the functioning of the trade unions as
organs of collective bargaining. Civil liberties are being
denied even today to the workers and toiling masses gener-
ally wherever these are making an attempt to utilize their
rights for the improvement of their conditions. This is
under Roosevelt. But Roosevelt's right opponents, the Lib-
erty League, the Hearsts, the Coughlins, etc., want to make
this the system of capitalist rule—a system of murder, de-
struction of all workers’ organizations, Hitler concentration
camps, for anyone who raises his voice against oppression.
They want the system of fascism.

Is the danger real? No one here will dare to deny it.
And yet there is still great division in the camp of those
who must ﬁght against this menace. Why don’t we unite
our forces to combat these dangers? Are we going to wait
until fascism is actually victorious in the United States?

Yes, there are serious differences between Socialists
and Communists. These differences are the differences be-
tween revolutionary Socialism, that is, Communism, and
reformist Socialism, which is based on class collaboration.
I am going to discuss these differences with the View of
showing that despite differences, we can unite our forces.

In the past, we Communists have directed against Com-
rade Thomasmuch of the ﬁre of our criticism of reformist
policies. That was inevitable. We are pleased to be able to
say, however, that the situation is changing. Comrade
Thomas has said, as reported in the New York Times of
November 18th, that he will no longer act as a “show win-
dow” for the Old Guard who betray Socialism. (Applause).

What is our fundamental point of agreement? It is
that we both want to abolish capitalism, we both seek to
establish Socialism.

Wedisagree on the question of the road to Socialism.
The traditional Socialist Party conception is that Socialism
will be reached through bourgeois democracy; that it will
come painlessly without upheaval, step by step. As against
this reformist conception, there is the conception of the
Communist Party, which says that Socialism can come only
through the dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power
(applause), the political form of transition from capitalism
to Socialism, which alone gives democracy to the overwhelm-
ing majority of the toilers, and is a dictatorship against the

_...20__

 

monopolies, bankers and other capitalist racketeers. (Ap-
plause).

What is the basic thing to be said of this fundamental
difference between revolutionary Socialism—that is, Com-
munism—-and reformism? It is this: Learn from experi-
ence. The working class of Germany, in its majority had
followed the road of reformism. German Social-Democracy
was the party of the majority of the German working class;
what was the result? The defeat of the working class revo-
lution in 1918, and then the victory of fascism. That is an
indisputable fact. »

The working class and the toilers of Russia, the former
empire of the Czars and bulwark of world reaction, have
followed the Bolsheviks. What was the result? The victory
of the Socialist Revolution, the establishment of Soviet
power, the building of Socialism, and—the ﬁnal and irrevoc-
able victory of Socialism on one-sixth of the earth, the crea-
tion of a bulwark of progress, a fortress of peace, a fortress
of Socialism.

Comrades, these two historic facts give the answer to

the question as to who is right on the fundamental? issue of I

revolutionary Socialism—that is Communism—or reform-
ism. -

I must answer the accusation made here that the Ger-
man Communists were responsible for the victory of fasc-
ism. The chief fault‘ of the German Communists was
precisely that they had not won the majority of the workers.
If "the German working class had followed the policies of
the German Communists in 1918 and the Austrian working

« class had not followed Otto Bauer and Friedrich Adler,

Europe and the whole world would have another face today.
Not fascism would be triumphant in Germany and Austria,
but Socialism. If anyone wants to speak about history, it is
German and Austrian reformism that is responsible for the
defeat of the revolution in Europe. It is exactly because the
Russian working class did not follow the Russian reformists
that today it is a Socialist -country, as our militant Socialist
friends admit, an-d not a fascist Russia. ,

Permit me to cite one example closer home. Imagine
for one moment the Old Guard in the United States about
whom Comrade Thomas is quoted in the New York Times
as saying that they are behaving like Hitler, imagine them
in command of police, of guns, of the powerful apparatus

_.21__

of the capitalist state. How they would crush the revolu-
tionary workers, including militant Socialists! With whom
would they unite? Would they unite with the Communists
and the militant Socialists to ﬁght against the capitalists?
Or with the Hearsts, with all the red-baiters against the
militant working class? If you want to understand the de-
feat of the German working class, study the politics of the
Old Guard in New York City. (Applause). The fact that
these leaders of German Socialism who followed this course
themselves by their own deeds, became the victims of~the
bloody Hitler regime does not in the least remove their re-
sponsibility, and should be a lesson to every honest Socialist
and also to the Old Guard. German Social-Democracy dis-
tinguished itself in 1933, not by fighting to preserve bour-
geois democratic liberties, but by betraying them and sur-
rendering to Hitler. But, aside from these lessons, there are
burning questions of the day: The need for all decent people
to‘ unite for American withdrawal from the Olympic Games
until they are transferred from Germany; (applause) fur-
ther, to ﬁght for the freedom of Thaelmann, Ossietzky, and
the thousands of prisoners of Hitler fascism, these thou-
sands of Socialists, Communists, liberals, churchmen who
need our help. Why not a united front now on these imme-
diate issues? (Applause)

Even on this most fundamental question of division be-
tween us, however, many militants seem to stand no longer
uncompromisingly on the reformist theory. My opponent
has some-doubts, in common with many Socialists. We
might add,.the more serious the Socialists, the bigger —.the
doubts. (Laughter) These doubts are growing stronger, in
view‘ of. events in‘Europe and the rise of the fascist menace
in the United States. I quote Comrade Thomas: “But to
press this principle into the demand that Socialists must
swear that they can never conceive of any circumstances
that will justify armed insurrection, or to compel Socialists
to affirm a blind belief in a romantic parliamentarism, is
complete and un-Socialist folly. What we have to do in the
future will be determined far more by events than by a ﬁne-
spun theoretical speculation or dogmatic affirmation.” (Ap-

furnished for this debate by the fear of my respected op-
ponent that the Seventh World Congress has swung too far
to the right. He is himself only making his ﬁrst excursions
in revolutionary Socialist policy. Like all beginners in this
field, he falls under the inﬂuence of high-sounding phrases,
in the style of ‘Trotsky, which only cover the remnants of
reformist ideas. It is certainly something new in the world
when Socialists ﬁnd obstacles to the united front in a sup-
posed move to the right by Communists. But if our Socialist
friends are afraid we will not join them in a future taking
over of power when the situation "is ripe, let them be at
‘peace on this question. (Laughter) The Seventh World Con-
gress brought forward new tactics and methods of work to
meet the changed world situation; it maintained unchanged
the principles of the program of Communism. (Applause)

We see that even in the most fundamental difference
which still remains, we are not faced any more with an un-
changing unbridgeable chasm. Comrade Thomas himself

t narrowed down this gulf when he abandoned the dogmatic
affirmation that never, under any circumstances can the
Communist answer to this question be accepted. From our V

side, we have also narrowed this gulf. We are ‘removing
most determinedly all remnants of sectarian attitudes on
the question of ﬁghting for the preservation of all bourgeois
democratic liberties. Applying the Marxist-Leninist posi-
:tion on the question of bourgeois democracy, the Seventh

»World "Congress of’ the Communist International, speaking
Ithrough Comrade Dimitroif, said: “We are adherents of

Soviet "democracy, the democracy of the toilers, the most
consistent democracy in the world. But in the—_ capitalist
countries ‘we -defend and shall continue to defend. every inch
of bourgeois democratic liberties which‘ are ‘being -attacked
by fascism‘ and bourgeois reaction, because the interests of
the class struggle of the proletariat so dictate.” (Applause)

The great mass of American workers are not convinced
as yet of the necessity of Socialism about which sincere So-
cialists and Communists do agree. Especially do the masses
tend to remain skeptical about Socialism when they see its
adherents sharply divided into Socialist and Communist
Parties, unable even to act together for the things they
agree on, in the unions, in the daily burning immediate needs
of life. They see in New York, for example, where the move-
ment is strongest, the Communist Party advancing only

_23-_

slowly in elections, while the Socialist Party even falls back
to about the level of the Communist Party this year, and
the total vote of the two parties is even declining. Of course,
we are very glad that the Communist vote is rising. This
requires all Socialists to think more seriously about the
united front. Nevertheless, we must say that the decline
of the total vote of the two working class parties is alarm-
ing. Is it not clear that a united front would multiply the
attractive power of the Socialist and Communist Parties
over the large masses? And is it not clear also that both
parties and the cause of Socialism would gain immeasurably
among the working classes by a clear decision to establish
a united front of the two parties? (Applause)

Yes, we differ on the question of bourgeois democracy
or proletarian dictatorship as the road to Socialism. Yet it
is clear that for the American working class to face the
question of power as an immediate issue in any form, there
must be the organization of the millions of unorganized into
powerful industrial unions; there must be a radical strength-
ening of the organized power of the working class, of the
working class on the economic ﬁeld. On this I believe we
agree. Why don’t we join hands to help the movement for
the organization of the unorganized into industrial unions,
a movement which is rising today as never before?

It will also be admitted that to hasten the coming of
Socialism, it is necessary that the American working class
establish its political independence from the capitalist par-
ties. For that there is required today a workers’ political
party much broader than the Communist or Socialist
Parties, but which would necessarily have to include both
parties. That is why we propose a Farmer-Labor Party,

based on the immediate needs and demands of the toilers, a A

party which wouldn’t be either Socialist or Communist, but
which must be neither anti-Socialist nor anti-Communist.

It will have to be a party embracing all those who are ready . ’ A i

to break with the capitalist parties.

Comrades, let me put the question sharply: Between to-
day and a future victory of fascism in the United States
there stands historically only one thing-—a powerful peo-
ple’s anti-fascist front, a Farmer-Labor Party. (Applause)

The presidential elections of 1936 are already in full

swing. The forces of reaction—the Liberty League, Hearst, V

Coughlin, et cetera, are working daily with the most power-
-24- A

 

ful resources at their command to bring about the victory
of unrestrained reaction, the victory of civil war methods
of rule against the masses, in the coming presidential elec-
tions. Surely the militant Socialists do not take the posi-
tion that Roosevelt will save us from the danger of fascism.
Surely they do not take the position that the present forces

’ of the Socialist and Communist Parties alone are able to

save this country from the menace of fascism. Then how
can we delay united action for a Farmer-Labor Party?

Why can't we unite on a wide campaign in the trade
unions, in the farmers organizations in the middle class or-
ganizations, in favor of a Farmer-Labor Party? Why can't
we work jointly in these mass organizations to secure their
endorsement of organizing a Farmer-Labor Party? Why
can't we unite forces to begin building local united commit-
tees for the promotion of a Farmer-Labor Party -movement?
Furthermore, in a large number of localities, and even in
some states, the situation is mature for the actual organiza-
tion of local and state labor parties which from the very
outset would rest upon and receive the support of widest
masses of toilers. Why don’t we do it?

Yes, it is true that the only solid foundation for such a ’

Farmer-Labor Party must have, as its key-stone, a strong
trade union movement. On this we agree. Why can we not
also agree on joint measures to build such a powerful trade
union movement? It is true that the Old Guard of the So-
cialist Party supports the Green-Woll reactionary leadership,
which is an organic part of the capitalist parties. But it is
also true that the militant Socialists in the trade unions
found it possible and necessary to work with the Commu-
nists against the splitting policies of the reactionaries in
the trade unions (the Teachers Union, for example), against
the reactionaries and ra-cketeers (Nemser) whom the Old
Guard is supporting and against red-baiting generally. It
is also true that the militant Socialists have found it possi-
ble in the Atlantic City Convention to ﬁnd a common plat-
form with the Communists on all important issues, and
through this united action, to play a big part in strengthen-
ing the forces of the industrial union bloc, led by Lewis, and
in rallying a Labor Party group of over ﬁve thousand votes
out of 30,000. That historic action of the Socialists and
Communists at the A. F. of L. convention, with which Com-
rade Thomas agrees, demonstrates beyond doubt the possi-

_._25_.

bilities of a united front. It shows that Communists and
Socialists were able to ﬁnd a common understanding in
practical trade union work. If such informal beginnings al-
ready can give such splendid results, is it not time to bring
the united front more systematically in a more organized
.way into every trade union, to all Socialists and Commu-
nists, and through them to the whole working class by for-
mal agreement between the two parties ? ' I

Again there is raised theold canard of Communist dual-
unionism. Was Comrade Thomas a dual-unionist, as the
Old Guard said, when he helped to organize the Progressive
Miners of America? Was John L. Lewis a dual-unionist
when he helped to organize the Camden ship-building indus-
try? Is William Green correct when he claims that John L.
Lewis is disrupting the American labor movement by fur-
thering the cause of industrial unionism? If these things
are true, then our friend is correct when he charges us
with dual-unionism. But we are sure that he will ﬁnally have
to admit that all of these accusations are untrue.

I come now to the important question of the struggle
for peace and against imperialist war. We agree on the need
of ﬁghting for peace. We are in fundamental agreement that
the very foundation of the struggle for peace must bethe
independent action of the workers themselves, drawing with
them other sections of the toiling population. From this a
large ﬁeld of practical united front action is opened up.

We agree that we must do all in our power to defeat
Mussolini’s war against Ethiopia. We agree that we must
exert ourselves in order to stop the shipment‘ of all supplies
to Italian fascism. Why don't we ﬁght jointly for that?
Why do we permit the question of League sanctions, which
is a- subsidiary and secondary proposition, to interfere with
joint actions for aims on which we do agree?

In this struggle collaboration with the Soviet Union is
a basic proposition. But We are sorry to say that the latest
resolution on war adopted by the National Executive Com-
mittee of the Socialist Party under the leadership of Com-
rade Thomas, completely overlooked the Soviet Union. The
resolution as a whole was undoubtedly a step to the left of
the Old Guard position, and contained some basic points with
which we agree. But today in a resolution on peace, to
leave out the Soviet Union when only in collaboration with

-26-

,,_Jv<-+01-—»;g.

 

P‘;g,

it can peace forces in every country become effective, is to

‘cut the heart out of that resolution.

We knowthe position of" the Old Guard. The Old Guard
slanders the Soviet Unionpeace policy ‘as. “nationalistic,”
and in this way hopes to be able to incite the masses against
the.‘Soviet "Union. Clearly, this works for the war mongers
and fascists. But what about you, militant Socialists? You
certainly want to ﬁght for peace. You certainly want to see
the Soviet Union succeed in its building of Socialism.‘ You
certainly cannot deny its consistent peace policy. Yet, how
can you permit yourself to echo thisview of the Old Guard,
even though in a different form?

This is the basic question.‘ One cannot ﬁght effectively
for peace, who does not" align himself with the peace policies
of the Soviet Union, and who refuses to utilize the tremen-
dous power for peace of that Socialist country among the
masses and in international diplomacy. The National Exec-
utive Committee of the Socialist Party has officially rec-
ognized that the Soviet Union is successfully constructing
a Socialist society. Comrade Thomas has agreed to that to-
night. That is very good, even though today very short-

sighted eyes could not overlook this any longer. That brings '

us closer to one another. But he who says “A,” must say
“B.” A Socialist country, which needs no colonies, and is
against allﬂimperialist oppression, a country that supports
all oppressed nationalities, such a country can have no other
policy but a peace policy, andﬂits peace policy is a Socialist
one. We should rejoice that this_policy dominates one of the
most powerful countries in the world. -

If our opponent attacks bureaucracy in the Soviet
Union, there would be nothing wrong. In that respect he
could- learn a great deal from the leaders of the Soviet
Union who really ‘know how to fight bureaucracy. He
could even learn something for the ﬁght against the Old
Guard. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, under
the leadership of Stalin, ﬁghts successfully against this relic
of rotten bourgeois society. But our opponent ﬁghts more
than bureaucracy when he speaks about “Party dictator-
ship and bureaucratic government from the top.” He evi-
dently doesn’t like the dictatorship of the proletariat. He
calls it, in the style of the Old Guard, “bureaucratic govern-
ment from the top.” He opposes the leading‘ role of_ the
workers in the Soviet Union, through their Party, as “party

..27._.

 

dictatorship.” But, without the Soviets, and without the
leadership of the Communist Party, the Russian working
class would not have been able to build, in spite of a world
of enemies and untold difficultes, a Socialist state. If one
approves of this Socialism which our opponent also recog-
nizes is growing in the Soviet Union, then he cannot logi-
cally repudiate the only policy by which this Socialism could
be built. And this necessary policy includes the ruthless
suppression of the exploiters, the ruthless suppression of
the Kirov assassins, and the counter-revolutionaries, the
liquidation of the kulaks as a class, the industrialization of
the country, the collectivization of agriculture (applause) *
—all of which is the economic basis for the future wither-
ing away of the State, which Comrade Thomas is in such
a hurry to see. Our opponent likes Socialism, which he can- . it’
not but see, but he complains about the proletarian dictator-
ship by which this gigantic historic task was fulﬁlled. It is
a bureaucratic idea that this great task could be brought
about without the broadest development of proletarian de-
mocracy, involving the broadest masses of workers and peas-
ants as active, conscious builders and ﬁghters for Socialism.
To be sure, in the United States many things will be easier
than in Russia once we have power, to gain which is harder.
That is because we already have a heavy industry; we al-
ready have the largest, most highly skilled working class
the world has ever seen; we already have a literate working
class and a high level of culture; we already have an enor-
mous accumulation of wealth and productive forces, equal
to all the -rest of the world combined, and we already have
thevrich-experience of the Soviet,Union, which will be a
powerful ally for us. In such favorable circumstances," we
should be able to avoid the long and painful road that the
Russian workers had to travel after the revolution, and pass
almost overnight to complete Socialism.

But this should only increase the admiration of our
Socialist friends and all workers for the Russian working
class and their great leaders, Lenin and Stalin, who raised
the most backward country from the ruins of war and fam-
ine to the heights of Socialism. (Applause). And we may add
the politics of the Old Guard, and even the advice of our
Socialist friends did not assist very much up to this time.

..28-—

It is. time, I think, that the leaders of the militant so;
cialists should take a clear position on the question of the
defense of the Soviet Union. A situation can develop to-
morrow when German and Japanese fascism will proceed
to attack the Soviet Union. The longer the united front is
delayed, the more acute this danger will become. Will the
militant Socialists adopt a position of neutrality? Will they
advocate the slogan “Keep America Out of War”? Impossi-
ble! Because it is precisely behind these slogans that the
reactionaries in America will support the war of Germany
and Japan against the Soviet Union with munitions, money,
moral support, and everything else. Certainly, the Old
Guard, who work with Hearst, have their answer ready:
“To hell with the Soviet Union, it doesn't concern us,” but
certainly the militant Socialists cannot have such an answer.
They cannot merely shout “neutrality.” They must have a
pro1etaria.n answer, a Socialist one, the defense of the Soviet
Union. (Applause and cheering). Yes, we must be patriots,
patriots of the cause of the working class, patriots of Social-
ism, patriots of the only country of Socialism today. (Ap-
plause).

This question of sanctions was placed all out of focus _

by some people in our past discussions. Some would make
it appear as though, like the British Labor Party, we pro-
pose to depend on League of Nations sanctions. That is
ridiculous. Our main line was again demonstrated the other
day by the appeal of the Communist International to the
Labor and Socialist International in which we demand inde-
pendent working class action as against reliance on the
League of Nations. But we also say that to refuse, as the
National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party has
done, to demand the League of Nations carry out sanctions
is to abandon one of the weapons, even though subsidiary,
in the struggle for peace. Our Socialist friends are out of
step with the left Socialists of Europe on this question. Our
opponent says that only on single narrow issues can we
have a united front, until we have brought the two Interna-
tionals together. But the Second International ‘throws the
issue back and says that a general united front must be
decided separately in each country. Out in Kansas we call
that “passing the buck.” (Laughter). We are again told

FOREWORD

The thousands who jammed Madison Square Garden on the night of
November 27th, 1935, came to hear two outstanding exponents of conflicting
proletarian thought defend and attack. But it was not merely‘an evening
of entertainment for the audience; it was an occasion for clarification in a
timeof much doubt and groping, when revolutionary changes are taking
place, if not visibly in the body of society at least in the minds of thinking
men and women. The radical movement in. general is swept today by many
winds of confusion. New sects are springing up to take their places in the
scrimmage of the old groups; committees and leagues for the formation of
new parties and new internationals are sowing their leaflets over a soil
that is believed fertile. And all speak with authority as the keepers of the
true M arxian faith.

The debate between Norman Thomas, the national leader of the
Socialist Party, and Earl Browder, general secretary of the Communist
Party, reported in these covers, was a historic one—-but not merely, as some
have alleged, because it was run on so gigantic a scaleibefore an audience

of 25,000 people, nor as others have mistakenly claimed becauseit was the

 

first appearance of Socialist and Communist leaders on the same platform.
Debates before large audiences and between such speakers have been held
any number of times. What made the debate historic was the fact that it
was the first verbal bout between two schools of thought that had not been
brought to the platform before, namely, Socialism as against the “new line"
Communism of the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International.

The Socialist Call, the Socialist weekly, which arranged the debate
and is now publishing the stenographic record as a permanent contribu-
tion to revolutionary thinking, has naturally diﬁered vigorously with the
Communist program and also with the philosophy of the Seventh World
Congress and its approach to the problem of war which looms so darkly
on the horizon at this moment. The debate was intended to help in the
clarification of such issues, and judging from the discussion it has aroused
even in non—radical circles, it has done m-uch in that direction.

Beyond this, it is hardly proper for a mere foreword to make comment,
either on the subject matter of the debate or on the personalities of the
protagonists. The reader will form his own judgment.

Tm: Socmusr CALL.

 

 <21” ".&<::.v.-e W... {x

that we are dominated _too much by Moscow. But Moscow
does not hold us back from the united front, like Brussels
still holds back Comrade Thomas. The situation becomes
even more absurd when we remember that the majority of
the Socialist International favors the united front but dares
not make a decision for it for fear of the veto power of only
ﬁve parties. .

Our opponent in this debate stands at the head of the
overwhelming majority of the Socialists in the United
States. They are engaged in a sharp battle with the reac-
tionaries of their own party. This ﬁght is now out in the
open and we are not talking about secrets. This can have
one of two possible results. If the Old Guard reactionaries
can continue to m_ake it appear to the masses as merely an-
other factional ﬁght and another split in an already weak-
ened and divided Socialist movement, then there is grave
danger of disintegration and decline of the Socialist Party.
We Communists do not want that, because that would mean
only more confusion and disunity among the workers. But
the militant Socialists have it in their power to bring the
second possible result. If they will come forth boldly and
energetically with the struggle for the united front, then
their party will rally around them with an enthusiasm which
will multiply its strength manifold. They will dissipate all
pessimism and passivity in their party. They will tap the
great reservoir of hope, enthusiasm and energy which I
myself have seen among the many Socialists who have been
attending my meetings all over the country. This reservoir
is -awaiting the word of united actionto spring forth. in a

1 great stream, a stream that will carry us far into the united

front, and will strengthen the working class immeasurably.
We will be taking a decisive step in. preparing the working
class to struggle for Socialism. (Applause).

This is the road that will lead toward organic unity be-
tween the Communist and Socialist Parties, to the creation
of one political party of revolutionary Socialism. (Applause).

We must make at once the ﬁrst steps on this road, and
this is the united front between Socialists and Communists
in every union, in the unemployed organizations, in the Con-

‘ gress Against War and Fascism, in‘ the youth movement,

among the farmers, among the Negroes, in the uniﬁcation
of the International Workers Order with the Workmen's
Circle and the Krankenkasse,.among the Labor Defense or-

—30—

 

ganizations-‘——in one word, an organized United Front be-

tween Socialists and Communists on all economic, political
and cultural fronts in the ﬁght against fascism and war.
This is the burning question of the moment. We must not
delay any longer. We cannot afford to procrastinate. We
must act, because the enemy is acting. We must join hands
to rally the workers and their mass organizations and all
other toilers for the Farmer-Labor Party, for the people’s
front against fascism and War. ,

Everything I have said in this debate I say not as an
individual. I speak in the name of my party, with the unani-
mous and enthusiastic approval of the entire body of
membership as expressed in a series of great meetings, and
of the entire Central Committee, which has just concluded
a meeting attended by 300 leading Party workers from all
over the country. Our entire Party is fired by the burning
desire to do everything possible, by word and deed, to bring

about the united front—such a great united front as has

existed for over a year in France, and to build around it
an even greater people’s front—the Farmer-Labor Party
against fascism and war. Reaction and fascism in the United
States are mobilizing for attack. Roosevelt is no obstacle
against it. The Farmer-Labor Party will be. Let us unite
to build it. We are driving toward this goal, and we will
reach it.

The united front is possible. It is a life and death nec-
essity of the working class and the toiling masses.

Therefore, my sincere desire, the desire of the Commu-
nist Party in this discussion, is not for defeat of Comrade
Thomas and the Socialist Party, nor for the victory of my-

self and the Communist Party. No, we want the victory«

of the united front, the victory of the joint struggle against
fascism and war, and victory of the mass movement for a
Farmer-Labor Party in the United States. This is the road
that will help all of us to ward off reaction and fascism in
this country, to shift the burden of the crisis "from the
masses to the monopolists, to frustrate the criminal designs
of the fascist war makers here and abroad, to prepare the
transition to Socialism in the_United States. (Applause).

REBUTTAL BY NORMAN THOMAS

NORMAN THOMAS: Comrade Chairman and Comrades,
I happen to know that there are a good many worthy
appeals which have been left out tonight, one from the Mor-
rell Packing House strikers, for instance, and a lot of others.
It is a serious business when we gather twenty thousand
people together and don’t have time even to list infringe-
ment on civil liberties and other causes in America. Let’s
remember it and act accordingly.

I am very glad to hear Heywood Broun on the united
front. Nobody has worked harder than he for a united front
between his own Newspaper Guild and the A. F. of L., and
nobody ought to know better than Heywood Broun, that
simply wanting a united front won’t get it. You have got
to get some education about how to go about getting it and
Heywood Broun ought to get a united front between the
Newspaper Guild and the American Federation of Labor,
which I know he has been directing his efforts toward se-
curing, but it requires a certain preliminary of education,
and so do some other plans for joint action.

I want very brieﬂy now to attend to a few immediate

4 matters. Earl Browder ha-s had a good deal to say about the

Old Guard, and he has rested a little too much on a some-
what extreme interpretation of not too accurate quotations.
I honestly do not think our Communist friends can help us
very much in this matter. They have lost two wings already.
Maybe the wings were small. I don’t know, but some of them
1r)nake quite a noise yet flapping around outside the main
ody. ‘

It scarcely seems to me they have learned all the secrets

of holding together. We Socialists haven't lost as yet so

I many factional groups. Moreover, I remember it was not so

long ago that we were advised in the Daily Worker that
“these groups, militant and so forth, though they express a
desire for militant struggle in the rank and ﬁle, don’t differ
from the Old Guard on fundamental principles, but merely
on the best method of keeping workers from accepting the
revolutionary way out of the crisis.” That keeps me from
thinking that Comrade Browder is the best adviser on the
subject of unity within the Socialist Party at the present
time (applause); let me call attention to another matter.
I don’t deserve either credit or discredit for organizing or
helping to organize the Progressive Miners. I had nothing
to do with it, except that I was in Illinois at one stage of
their history and I was sympathetic with certain things

__32_

 

they were then trying to do, things which, I am sorry to
say, some of them later forgot themselves. There is a vast
difference, I may point out, between the kind of support
Lewis, and I also, in my way, gave to the Camden Shipyard
strikers, and the kind of support the Communist Party used
to give to dual unions. If the A. F. of L. unions are some-
what slow to be interested in a united front, it is not sur-
prising when one remembers some of the disruptive tactics
of Communists. I don't want to dwell on the past, but you
cannot, no matter how many of you here want it, win the
labor unions of America until you have overcome your past.

Thus, at the seventh convention of the Communist
Party I ﬁnd in the proceedings this statement: “The Ameri-
can Federation of Labor is an outright fascist organization."
I ﬁnd in the Communist for February 1932 this statement:
“We want to break up the reformist unions, we want
to weaken them. We want to disrupt their discipline.
We want to wrest the workers from them. We want
to break up and destroy the trade union apparatus. Of that
there cannot be the slightest doubt.” And in the Communist
of June 1930: “The task of the Trade Union Unity League
is to mobilize the masses, win them to our side and embrace
them organizationally within the field and destroy the
American Federation of Labor, the most reliable support of
American capitalists.” You cannot indulge in that kind of
talk and change over night, and if you are sincere in want-
ing the united front of labor, it reasonably requires some
outward demonstration of that desire. for a longer time than
we have had. (Applause).

Something has been said, and well said in the main,
about the Negro problem. Let me express my sympathy and
admiration for Communist work among Negroes, but when
Communists support self-determination in the Black Belt,
that isno expression, or ground for, a United Front. That
is a thing equally contrary to common sense in America and
Socialism. You cannot train people in solidarity of workers
and teach self-determination in the Black Belt. It is an at-
tempt to copy a Russian situation that does not exist in
America. Here we want an equality of justice, and not
segregation in a Black Belt.

I have been told tonight that it was the German Social-
Democrats who brought all the woe upon Germany by not
following the Communist road, and that the Austrians made
a similar mistake. But I would rather be on the side of the
Austrian Social-Democrats in their heroic struggle than on
the side of some Communists in Germany who yielded with-
out a struggle, having ﬁrst tried to ﬁsh in the muddy waters

.35..

of confusion which they stirred up. Alas, the Fascists
proved better ﬁshermen.

Even at the Seventh World Congress of the Communist
International, there was a somewhat more realistic account
given of what happened in Germany than there was given
here tonight. “In Germany it was with still greater delay,
even. Only after the advent of Hitler to power was it that
the Communists issued the clear slogan of defending the
free trade unions, followed by the slogan of restoring the
free trade unions. It took a long time, before the importance
of work in the trade unions was granted by the Communists
in other countries." I am quoting an official document on
this point. This thing we must remember, if we would un-
derstand labor hesitations about a united front.

Now, I turn to matters of a. greater importance. It is
a little odd to be accused of class collaboration by a‘ repre-
sentative of a cause which has seen Russia in the League of
Nations selling oil regularly to Mussolini. If words mean
anything, that is class collaboration, and no talk about in-
ternational law or League of Nations or what other capital-
ists do can wipe out the fact that, here, to our profound
sorrow, we have Russia doing systematically the thing we
thought was not going to be done. Is that class collabora-
tion? ’

Marching with Father Divine-—is that by chance class
collaboration ?

The inclusion of Democratic Clubs-—-is that class collab-
oration by chance? . ‘ '

I am afraid, Comrade Browder, that what is class collab-
oration for Socialists is great statesmanship for Commun-
is . .

Now, let me appeal to you Communists, who make up
so large a part of this audience (laughter). By the way, the
“Socialist Call” would be less than grateful if it did not
thank you for turning out so well, you are doing well by it.
But, anyhow, I appeal to you to think a little of something
that is happening tonight. You have heard almost in so
many words an appeal to the American people that goes
like this: “All of you, Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Demo-
crats, Republicans, little businessmen, farmers, come with
us, let's have a people’s front against the oppressor, against
the capitalist.” All right, well and good. (Applause.) [Wait
a minute.] But, then, what? Then you say, “Of course, after
we have got the United Front, and we have got power and
office, what you have got to expect is what happened in
Russia.” And what was it that happened in Russia? Well,
I am not exaggerating religious persecution nor am I cham-

...34_

 

pioning the cause of the orthodox church that deserved some
bitterness of criticism, when I say that there is a little less
freedom for the church in Russia than there is in Germany

V at the present time. (Hisses.) How do you expect to get your

Catholics on that basis? All right, hissing proves nothing.
I hope I am wrong. Suppose I put it this way: that Catho-
lics think there is a little less freedom of religion for them
in Germany than Russia. How are you going to get your
Catholics under those circumstances ? Do you expect to keep
them in ignorance of the matter? How do you expect to get
your farmers when all you say is this: “We must have agri-
cultural collectivization, and if our dictator makes it cost
a million lives and perhaps more, we nevertheless have ruth-
lessly to press towards our goal.” How will that help your
people’s front? How will it help your people’s front to say,
“Yes, when Kirov was assassinated, we had to answer terror
by greater terror.?’ Is that justice, is that the justice we
held up as the socialist ideal as against capitalistic injus-
tice? Was Russia so weak that Russia could not afford to try

men on the basis of their own guilt on specific charges ? (Ap-

plause.) What kind of security for any future is there if We
are to hold that the dictatorial bureaucracy of a party has a
right to decide what justice we shall get? Is it true that the
dictatorship of the proletariat means workers’ democracy
when there are scores, hundreds, perhaps thousands of Rus-
sian workers guilty of no offense except criticism, who have
been put in jail and sent to exile? Is that the dictatorship
that we have to have in America? Is that the desirable
thing? Are you sure that that is the same thing as the
democracy of workers? I am not, and the American people

won't be, and if you talk that long enough and loud enough .

you will give the Fascists their chance in America which will
be a very serious thing for all of us. (Applause.)

Was it all false, the story that the Tchernavins told,
the story of brutal and senseless persecution of themselves
and others? You have to convince the American people
either that it is all false or else that you are not going to
follow that way. You tell us, Comrade Browder, that you
want this united front on the basis of conserving democratic
rights. Is Russia still so Weak that Russia cannot extend
civil liberty now within her own borders, as proof of sin-
cerity to the world? (Applause.) ._

Asking these questions, I am trying to bring out real
and deep differences between Communism and Socialism.
Let me see what I would tell the people of America. I would
tell them: “We are not romantic parliamentarians. We don't
guarantee that you can vote in socialism, but if. you will

__35._

vote more intelligently, you will be a lot nearer your goal,
and the rest will be easier, when your party is backed up
by your labor organizations, backed up with your own con-
sumers’ organizations. If the time comes when the ruling
class forces violence upon us, let us have with us the workers
who heretofore have been the tools and the fools of the
masters and fought the battle of the masters; then we can
make that violence very short indeed.” It is not we who em-
phasize violence or dictatorship, even temporary dictator-
ship; it is we who emphasize the ideals and the possibility
of achieving that ideal. When workers generally unite for a
battle with the upper class, the upper class is not very
strong nowadays except as they fool the worker, and we
want to keep them from fooling the workers that way.

I turn now to the matter of war, which is very im-
portant. Comrade Browder says we Socialists didn’t refer to
the Soviet peace policy in our declaration. Much of that
Soviet peace policy has been ﬁne and admirable, and I have
praised it, but if we had written a resolution on the troubles
in Africa, we should have had to mention Russia's selling
of oil and coal and wheat to Mussolini. Better not mention
Russia at all in our statement than to bring that in now.
(Applause.)

May I say another thing and say it very solemnly? The
protection we owe to the great ideals and achievements of
Soviet Russia will not be advanced by giving power to the
Russian dictatorship, no matter how sincere, to draw us all
into war, because it has decided at a given moment that
there is nothing else but war. And you can’t win your Amer-
ican people, or workers to that way of makini peace and
democracy safe from harm. What we have to now is the
best way to defeat capitalism. What we have to organize
is the strength of the workers to impose their own sanctions,
and you don't, Comrade Browder, make a very effective ap-
peal for workers’ sanctions, when you have trailed along
with the League of Nations, with British imperialism, with
Britain's navy in the Mediterranean, and with the sale of
oil to Mussolini, at the same time. I think our young folks
want a nobler challenge than that. I am not arguing the
whole question of sanctions tonight. There is no time. Work-
ers’ sanctions, we both believe in. We both believe in stop-
ping the sale of oil from America to Italy. We both believe
in stopping anybody in America from coining others’ blood
into their gold, but if you want the secret of the war against
war, it is not to be found in defense, not even a defense of
Soviet Russia. Do you suppose that automatically, just be-
cause Russia is on one side, it will not be imperialism in capi-

.36..

 

 

talist America which will put it in on that side-—if it goes in
at all? Do you think that we, while we are still weak, will be
strong enough to manipulate our armies so that they are
equivalent to the Red Armies? I don’t. And I think that hold-
ing up that hope obscures the vision of the workers that
the road to peace is a steady and relentless struggle against
the capitalist system which nourishes war. It is a steady and
relentless struggle against imperialism in our land. What I
fear is the effect of the sort of thing, which I ﬁnd in certain
quotations, like this, from the “Daily Worker”: “We now
emphasize our demand that the American government de-
clare itself for the support and mutual assistance pact signed
by France, Czecho-Slovakia, and the Soviet Union, open
to all powers really desiring and working for peace.” (May
20th, I think, was the date.) I don’t believe that is the prin-
ciple on which to win workers to a genuine united front. I
am not necessarily condemning in every respect the Franco-
Russian pact. I am saying that a very terrible responsibility
was taken by Stalin when he speciﬁcally told Communists to
stop their agitation within the French Army, for that, and
that only, was the meaning of his endorsement of French
military preparation. It is because this question is so seri-
ous, because we don’t want to be bound by iron chains to one
course, a course determined not by the interest of the work-
ers, not by our knowledge of the meaning of world war,
not by our knowledge of capitalism, but solely by a consid-
eration of what the rulers of Soviet Russia demand, that we
don't want to go blindfold here in America out of our rela-
tive position of freedom into the kind of an agreement that
has been proposed. In the long run the course I now urge is
better adapted for the defense of that soul of Russian revo-
lution for which Lenin and Stalin stood—yes, and Trotzky,
too, whose name has been omitted tonight, than by the
course that has been taken by the last Communist Congress.
I heard a boo, didn’t I, for Trotzky? A united front!
And we have to boo Trotzky in spite of whaﬂ he did
in the world. (Applause.) This I say, who am no Trotzkyite,
but who believe that if the workers are going to get to-
gether into a united front, they must have freedom to ad-
mire men who have greatly served their cause, even if at
all points they have not agreed with them. Unless we get
that kind of tolerance, I don’t see that any formal united
front will mean much. »

There has to be a unity of action to be effective in crisis.
In time of emergency there has to be leadership, but leader-
ship is not dictatorship. Dictatorship in a crisis becomes 1m-
perative as leadership fails. The more you emphasize dicta-

-37-

 

torship, the greater is the difficulty and the danger, lest men

coveting power hang on to power. If in emergencies we have
to give virtual dictatorial powers, let it be with the under-
standing that the workers, not just one part of them, work-
ers with hand and brain, are the real authority. Workers’
democracy and ultimately true social democracy is the
hope for mankind, that is our hope now and our only
hope in America, for to talk up dictatorship and great vio-
lence is to invite the Fascists to begin with them first in
this country. The 20,000 workers here tonight are not
enough to stop Fascist tyranny if we once get the idea of
necessary tyranny abroad in the land.

And one last word about this united front. Communist
friends, I think you are sincere in your new line. (Applause.)
I think it tonight more than ever, but it is a new line, a very
new line. When once I opposedthe self-determination in the
Black Belt, I was accused, I think in the “Daily Worker”
as an advocate of lynching, and all over America that was
thrown up to me. Once, at a government hearing, I said that
although I was opposed to the LaGuardia amendment for
confiscation of property in the event of war, because I
wanted to socialize property now for peace-—nevertheless,
I said, in the event of war, I should be for it, that is, for the

. LaGuardia amendment. What was my surprise to hear all

over America-—and I have heard it within the last few
months—“Mr. Thomas, you said that in the event of war,
‘I am for it’.” And the people who started that story knew
I didn’t say it. I have to tell you that you must wipe out this
memory in our minds. It does not matter to us so much, but
it does matter in winning the conﬁdence of the American
labor movement. I hope you will wipe it out by what you
have begun to do, by criticizing fairly, by standing shoulder
to shoulder wherever you can honestly, in defense of a Hern-
don, in defense of the liberties and rights of workers. Let
us begin that way, and then I will trust to the working of
time to bring us to a far surer joint action of all the workers
than if we put our pressure now upon a paper agreement
first and action afterwards. (Applause.)

REBUTTAL BY EARL BROWDER

EARL BROWDER: Comrades and friends, I think that

Comrade Thomas is sincere in his new line. I think so
more than ever, after tonight. (Laughter.) However, per-
haps he still has a few hang,-overs from his past- also like
he thinks we Communists have. But We don't say that this
is in any way an obstacle in developing a united front. We
are quite prepared to meet Comrade Thomas in the united
front with all the opinions that he has that we think are
wrong, and we are ready to trust to the democratic process
of the free expression of our differences before the masses,
just as we are doing here tonight, to decide the question
as to who finally will solve these problems for the masses,
those who stand for his conception of the course of revolu-
tion, or those who stand for the Communist conception. That
is democratic enough, is it not? Even for such a staunch
champion of democracy as Comrade Thomas.

I will not be able to give a deﬁnite extended answer to
all the questions and criticisms that were raised against the
Communists. Perhaps to go into all of these questions really
would not meet the central line of discussion tonight. For
example, would it be of any great value to discuss: should
we bring Democratic and Republican clubs into the united
front? I am sure that once we really begin the united front,
Socialists and Communists would agree everywhere, that
workers have to be brought together, even if they are in
Republican and Democratic 'clubs, and if we can bring them
into connection with the Farmer-Labor Committees, even
before they are fully ready to break with their old parties,
we will be more able to bring them in fully by the ‘time
election comes around.

Also, perhaps this discussion about the obstacle of the
United Front that has been seen in the collaboration in the
united front efforts of the Church of Father Divine, is not
necessary. Now, we Communists all admit that as between
churches, we don't choose good ones and bad ones. "(Laugh-
ter and applause.) Perhaps in this respect we are a little
more impartial than Comrade Thomas. But we know this‘,

The debate between Norman Thomas, mem-
ber of the National Executive Committee of the
Socialist"Party, and Earl Browder, General Sec-
retary of the Communist Party, was held in
Madison Square Garden, New York City, N ovem-
ber 27th, l93_Q, at 8:30 P.M. Leo Krzycki,
National Chairman of the Socialist Party, was
chairman. C C -

 

 

 

 

that if we are going to work with churches, and we Com-
munists are quite ready to work with churches, we are very
active working with church organizations, if we are going
to do it, we think we should give a little special attention
even to those churches that represent the most exploited
classes who have only this church organization through
which to work. (Applause.) So we have no apologies for
working with the followers of Father Divine, working with
his church organization. We wish there were a lot more
churches that would fight for the workers unemployment
insurance bill like that church did.

Now, Comrade Thomas, perhaps unintentionally, has
given a false impression here about one of the features of
our discussion. He gave the impression that the Commun-
ists advocate and idealize violence. That is absolutely wrong.
(Applause.) Communists do not advocate violence. Commun-
ists do not idealize violence. But we say that a responsible
leader of the working class must not teach the workers that
the capitalists are going to stop voluntarily some day
from using violence. (Applause.) The capitalists are
not going to hand over their power without a strug-
gle, and the workers must prepare for it. We Com-
munists are not giving forth a new doctrine of the role
of force in history. We are merely adapting to modern times
the same realistic facing of problems that made the found-
ers of America what they were, men capable of carrying
through a revolution. (Applause.) We are good Americans,
we are not pacifists, we are not going to try to re-write
in the spirit of pacifism the national anthem, the “Star-
Spangled Banner,” which tells us that the only Way to gain
and protect liberty may require us to listen to the “bombs
bursting in air, that gave proof through the night that the
ﬂag is still there.” (Applause) Of course, that good Ameri-
can doctrine is a little antiquated when it speaks of “bombs
bursting in air,” but the spirit of the thing is just as good.
(Applause.) And in saying that let me repeat again, we do
not idealize violence. We would avoid violence, and especially,
we want the united front to stop the violence of the capital-

-40-

ist class being used against the workers in the United States.
(Applause and cheering.)

Comrade Thomas is very much concerned that the Soviet
Union did not independently and long ago, by unilateral ac-
tion, stop the shipments of Soviet oil to Italy, and he places
against this the efforts which we are making, and on which
we all agree, to stop shipments of oil from the United States
to Italy. There is a little difference there. In the United
States the only way in which we can do anything to influ-
ence practically the international situation with regard to
oil and the shipment of all kinds‘ of material, is to organize
in-dependent action of the workers, arouse a growing mass
movement to bring pressure on our government to force it
to take effective action. In the Soviet Union it is not neces-
sary to force the government totake action because that
government has no special imperialistic interests of any
kind. It is taking on its own initiative all those steps which
will’ most effectively help Ethiopia against Italian Fascism.
Let me ask you, are you concerned with practical help or
are‘ you merely concerned with face-saving? The Soviet
Union could, if it considered ‘face-saving important, protect

‘ itself against all such accusations, _by just stopping the ship-

ment of oil to Italy and nothing else, but would that be a
practical help to Ethiopia, when Italy could get all the oil
it wants elsewhere? In contrast with such a face-saving
but ineffective action, the Soviet Union took a really helpful
course. It found it could do something else. It could use its
international position, its‘ growing international power in
diplomacy, in the relation between the powers, to force a
general cutting oﬁ of all oil to Italy. The Soviet Union
weighed very carefully the advantages of these two courses;
isolation and purity and safety from attack by Comrade
Thomas, or to expose themselves to the attacks of Comrade
Thomas, but to do something practical for a real embargo,
world-wide, against Italy. (App1au_se.) I think that every
serious worker’ will agree that the Soviet Union is doing the
best, and Ethiopia agrees, and they should know. A
—-41-

There are a whole series of other questions that were
raised, but I must come to a conclusion, because I went
over my time in the first place by six minutes.

One word about the Franco-Soviet Pact. I am sure that
after the experience of the past six months, there is no
longer any need to answer the arguments that were raised
about that pact when it was ﬁrst announced to the world.
You remember we were told then that Stalin had sold the
French working class to Laval, and had instructed the
French working class to stop opposition to Laval, and then,
a few weeks later, came along the municipal elections
throughout France and the Socialists and Communists regis-
tered a tremendously big increase in votes and consolidated
the belt of Red municipalities around Paris. (Applause.)
Since that time the united front of Socialists and Commun-
ists has been extended to the people's front that includes the
Radical-Socialists, the big middle class party of France and
the left has been further consolidated, and Fascist forces in
France have been further blocked. Is there anybody that can
today speak about that Franco-Soviet Pact as having been
against the interests of the French masses, the French work-
ers? You may still be able to say it in New York, but nobody

‘would ever dare say that to a meeting of workers in Paris.

Thelast point. What is happening in the Soviet Union?
I am afraid that Comrade Thomas has read so widely, that
his taste in reading about the Soviet Union has been so
catholic, and his trust in the various “authorities” about the
Soviet Union has been so universal, that his opinions about
that country are really a maze of contradictions that are
hard to unravel. However, I am not hopeless about this;
we had similar cases before that turned out all right after
a more or less prolonged period. I am thinking, for example,
of those founders of Fabian Socialism, Sidney and Beatrice
Webb. They believed all those bad things about the Soviet
Union too until they went over there and studied the situa-
tion for six or eight months and ever since then they have
been writing books to show how in the last years of their
lives they ﬁnally found one country that had learned the real

--42-

 

road to that socialism for which the Webbs had sought in

England unsuccessfully because they took the wrong road
for reaching it.

I remember also the name of Victor Berger used to
represent hostility to the Bolsheviks, to the Soviet revolu-
tion, and I remember that in the past year, although Victor
Berger is dead, Mrs. Victor Berger has studied the situation
in the Soviet Union, has gone over and examined the actual

life there and pronounced it good socialism. Nobody can say

that this good practical Socialist politician (and that is
what she is, in all respect to a ﬁne woman, a good, experi-

, enced Socialist politician) allowed the Communists to fool

her. No, you can't say that. Perhaps some day Comrade
Thomas will follow the path that was blazed already by the
Webbs and by Meta Berger with the same good results. (Ap-
plause.) ‘

Comrades, let me conclude. In the rebuttal on those
questions which I have already touched on, a few typical
questions have been raised. I have tried again to approach
these questions from the point of view with which we ap-
proach the whole debate from the beginning.

Yes, we will face every diﬁerence that is between us
boldly and frankly. We hope to receive from the Socialists
fullest and frankest and most responsible criticism of every-
thing that they conceive to be weaknesses of ours." We will
study these things very- carefully and we will try to learn
from the Socialists just as much as we can. We hope that
the militant Socialists are going to take the same kind of
an attitude towards our criticism of their position, to learn
in discussion. We think that on most of the questions of the
road to socialism we have an enormous advantage. The mili-
tant Socialists are talking from abstract theory, and we are

talking from theory which is being translated into life. '

(Applause.) But we don’t want to exploit that advantage of
ours too much. We are ready t0 D1308 the-39 questions for
just exactly what they are worth before the masses. Above
all, we say these differences that are between .us, which
must be discussed, will only be settled for the masses in the
-43-

 

course of considerable discussion and more experience. But,
in the meantime, under the threat of Fascism and war, the
threat that is immediate and real today, there is demanded
not more long discussions as to whether the united front
is necessary or not, but immediate steps to begin to organize
this united front in action, in every locality and on a na-
tional scale, between responsible leaderships, between the
Socialist Party and theCommunist Party. (Applause.)
SUR-REBUTTAL BY NORMAN THOMAS

NORMAN THOMAS: It was a pleasure, and I hope not al-

together a wholly selfish pleasure to hear Comrade
Browder hoping for a united front by negotiation between
responsible leaders. A while ago Socialist leaders were to
be outsiders looking in.

‘ Comrade Browder congratulates me on my new line.
Well, consistency is not the highest virtue. If it was, I would
not think so well of Comrade Browder as I do at the present
time, but I mightpoint out that it is harder to quote Thomas
against Thomas than Browder against Browder in this de-
bate, and I might point out that I don’t need to follow the
Webbs or Meta Berger ‘in recognition of the excellent
achievements in Russia. I remember when I had a meeting
in my house because there was no public hall we could use
to urge recognition of Russia. But because I believe some
very great. and priceless things have been done, I am not
obliged to be wholly uncritical. Some one told me of a for-
eigner who went from New York to Chicago by way of
Boston and left the country being sure you had to go to
Boston to get from New York to Chicago. I am not sure that
in order to get where Russia has got, you have to go by Way
of Boston. I am not sure we have to repeat all that has hap-
pened there. I would be happier if Comrade Browder would
answer plainly what I said about Kirov and about the past
of agricultural ‘collectivization. I would be happier if Com-
rade Browder had told us frankly what has happened to
Socialists who want a united front in Russia, instead of a
party dictatorship.

But that is not the main thing that is on my mind.
I want to remind Comrade Browder that working with the
—-44-—

.‘ _.._....» »~... ...._,..a.

masses in New York does not mean marching with Tam-
maIlY’Ha11 and W.01'kin2‘ with the masses of colored people
doesn t mean tacit recognition of Father Divine’s divinity

in the march, and that is the effect, if not the purpose of
what happened.

A ‘I know well enough that my friends the Communists,
the intelligent ones, do not advocate an idealized violence. I
suppose it is mere neurosis of some sort or other that makes
some Communists or near Communists ecstatically applaud
whenever great violence is mentioned.

I know very well that in France there has been a growth
in the people’s front, but I am a little surprised that Comrade
Browder should first of all accuse me of thinking too much
of the ballot, and then rejoice that they got so many votes
in France that they 'don’t need to -worry any more about
the army, though it is from the army that any fascism may
arrive. I don't believe that blessing of Stalin's on the French
military establishment was necessary to the pact, not even
such a pact as he signed.

I would have been happier tonight, Comrade Browder,
if I had not heard that eulogy of the Star-Spangled Banner

from you. It was a song written in a wholly unnecessary ‘

war. It was a song occasioned by a war that the workers
should not have allowed to take place. You said or implied
you wanted the bombs to burst where they would do more
good than in the air. I don't want them to burst and you
don't want them to burst anywhere if we can help it. It is
utterly fantastic to talk loosely about violence, now when
the gbvernment has the means of violence. As long as it can
recruit ignorant workers, the less we say now about great
violence, and our admiration of “Oh say can you see by the
dawn’s early light,” the better off we are.

And that leads me to one thing more. I would like to
address if I could, the Ethiopian dead, the dead young men
whom Mussolini dragged out of their homes in Italy to ﬁght
in a piratical war. I should like to say to those dead,
this: “You, the dead, some of you have fallen because
of Italy’s use of tanks driven by oil sold by the Soviet

———45——

 

Republic.” (Hisses). Wait a minute, those of you in favor of
the united front, wait a minute. I say, “You are dead be-
cause Soviet Russia as well as the capitalist nations, sold
oil, but be of good cheer. You may be dead, but Russia has
better purposes in the end. The war will stop. It will stop
by common action between Russia _and England, which has
subverted the League of Nations idealism for its own im-
perialism. It will be stopped in the end, so be of good cheer.
We have made money out of your death, but we have a bet-
ter way to stop the war than by a Soviet embargo on oil.’'
That, my friends, is not the spirit of revolutionary Social-
ism. That is not the spirit with which to appeal to the
colonial peoples of the world. (Applause.) May I ask you
this: do you think that if you cannot meet that argument
by anything but boos, that the time is ripe for that united
front? I have some doubts myself. But I still have hope,
and this is my hope, that beginning tonight, it will be pos-
sible for workers in New York, in their unions, and in the
city, to discuss problems, to differ on problems, to differ
sometimes hotly on problems, but still to differ honestly, to
differ fairly, and wherever they can, work together to build
unions to defend the liberties we have got, to increase those
liberties to win to our cause, which is the cause of freedom,
as well as of peace and abundance and to win to our cause
those who wander in darkness, the darkness of a disintegrat-
ing order, the darkness of the night of approaching fascism.

Let's win them before it is too late. And we can win
them by the honesty that has been exempliﬁed tonight.

(The debate was closed at 11 :45 o'clock p.m., with the
audience singing “The International.")

Which Road for American Workers,
Socialist or Communist?

HAIRMAN Krzycki: Now, Comrades, while the two chief partici-

pants in this all-important discussion are putting the ﬁnal touches
to their memoranda, I am asked to ‘pinch-hit. We saw ﬁt to meet
at a time which marks the sixth anniversary of the crash, called the
depression, and the thirdyear of the New Deal, and while Wall Street
is giving evidence to again start out on a very brief dizzy spree,
there are ten millions, at least, who are still totally out of a job,
and many more millions who receive cold, humiliating charity, in
the richest country in the world. It is also signiﬁcant that we are
meeting shortly after the most important labor convention in the

‘history of the labor movement had its meeting. It is. indeed encourag-

 

ing to us radicals in the political and trade-union movement to wit-
ness at least six outstanding, powerful aggressive unions aﬂ’iliate_d

with the American Federation of Labor coming to the conclusion that. —
the millions of workers in the United States. cannot possibly be-

lifted out of the capitalistic hell if the labor movement clings to the
old cobweb policy of the craft unions. (Applause) And there are
those of us who are indeed cheered by the launching of these power-
ful labor groups of a crusade for the‘ purpose of educating and or-
ganizing the millions of unorganized workers.

However, those of us who are privileged to observe both the
political and the economic movements, we know only too well, from
bitter experience, that unles labor obtains political power, it will not
get very far, even though it does organize on an industrial basis
rather than on a craft basis. As long as the power to issue injunc-
tions and to send out militia to shoot down defenseless, unarmed
workers, as long as the power to declare laws unconstitutional is on
the side of the exploiters, labor will have indeed a hard and rough
road to travel.

And so, in view of these most recent happenings in the labor
movement, it is indeed timely that so many thousands of men and
women turn out to participate in a discussion of a question that is
indeed very much before the mass of the working class.

I take it that you know that the subject that we are presenting
to you is entitled, “Which Road for the American Workers-Com-
munism or Socialism?" Both political groups engaging in this dis-
cussion went out of their way in ﬁnding spokesmen, who, in their
opinion, because of their experience and because of their daily con-
tact with the workers and farmers, are best qualiﬁed to represent
their particular side of the question.

We are first to look upon and hear one who has appeared on this
platform on many previous occasions, one with whom I have been
for many years very closely associated and I have frequently found
myself in a double-harness with him in labor struggles, and I now
present to you Norman Thomas, to present the Socialist’s side. (The
audience arose and applauded.)

OPENING SPEECH OF NORMAN THOMAS

ORMAN THOMAS: Comrade Chairman, Comrades and
friends, this, I trust, will be an occasion worthy of the
magnificent audience that has gathered. It will be a debate,
and a genuine debate, but it will, I trust, not be a debate
like a high school contest for points. It will not be a debate

such as lawyers are familiar with, who must win their case

at all costs, even the cost of truth itself. It will not, I trust,
be a. debate such as old men might indulge in, whose minds
are so turned to the past that they can remember what has
been but never look forward to what ought to be. (Ap-
plause.) -

It is a debate where we shall compare our minds, be-
cause, however great may be the diiferences between us, we
are in the presence of a common danger. We do face a com-
mon enemy. We live in time of__a common crisis, and we have
seen how great tragedies have come to the world, when men
Who, at least, ought to have cooperated to some extent, have
had to learn painfully the arts of cooperation in a concentra-
tion camp maintained by their enemy. (Applause.)

It is, I think, particularly appropriate that this magni-
ﬁcent audience should be gathered here in Madison Square
Garden, because it was not, after all, so very long ago that
Madison Square Garden saw the bitterest expression of lack
of cooperation, saw the Communist attack upon a meeting

the bravery of working class Austrian soldiers and martyrs.
That is a thing which now belongs to the past. (Applause.)

Necessarily, in the limited time that we have, both Earl
Browder and I will have to dwell on some of the points that
are under discussion. Let me, therefore, now, by way of
emphasis, make certain things clear: I reserve the right to
speak of -lessons that to my mind can be-learned from Rus-
sia’s mistakes, as well as from Russia's glorious victories,
but I want to make it as plain as words can make it, that I
regard the achievement in Russia as the one outstanding
achievement, the one bright pillar of hope, in the turbulent,
confused world of the last few years. (Applause and cheer-
ing) [We will have to ask for time out as in a football game

if you keep on like this I] ‘ .

I want to make one more preliminary point———and you
should get this too; it is a statement of enormous import-
ance: With all my heart and soul and mind and strength,
I condemn the policy of red-baiting in or out of the Ameri-
can Federation of Labor, as a policy wholly opposed to So-
cialist Ideals. (Applause.) There is one test and one test
only that can fairly be applied in any movement; there is
one test and one test only that can fairly be applied in any
labor union, and that is a test which must be applied to men
of all beliefs, to Communists, to Socialists, to Catholics, to
Republicans, to Democrats——it is the test of action; it is the
test of loyalty, it is the test of abstention from all that
would betray the standards of labor or would divide its
ranks without excuse. It is by that test and that test only,
by the test of overt act, that men in the labor movement
must be judged. This I say in order to clear the air, and
to make possible a further discussion of the issues before us.

I do not suppose thatmany in this house, certainly not
many Socialists, certainly not many Communists will want
to quarrel with the statement that tonight Earl Browder
and I unite in general on our diagnosis of what is wrong with
America and with the world. It is a diagnosis that as yet
the American masses have not accepted. It is a diagnosis
which our farmers and our workers and our professional
people have not accepted. They are still looking for some
patent medicine, some cough drop to cure , tuberculosis,
some salve to end cancer. At least, we unite on this plat-
form in knowing that the end of the intolerable exploitation,
the end of war, the end of insecurity, the end of poverty, can
only be won by men and women who struggle forward for
plenty and peace and freedom, on the basis of planning,

--7....

planning for abundance, planning which is made possible
because at last collectively workers with hand and brain
own the great natural resources and the great instruments
of production and distribution. Then at last we shall be
conquerors of the predatory society which in one form or
the other has long cursed the earth. We can‘ do it only by
struggle and it is of the terms and the nature of the strug-
gle that we are talking tonight.

I am a Socialist because I want a fellowship of free men
on earth.

I am a Socialist because I believe loyalty to the working
class is better expressed when we do not indulge in a kind
of mass abstraction or mass worship, when we hold, even
in a transition period, such civil and religious liberty as has
been painfully won.

I am a Socialist because I want more liberty than we
ever can have under capitalism, and I do not think we have
to wait for all that individual liberty until at last socialism
is securely established here all over the earth.

I am a Socialist because I believe in the processes of
democracy. There never can be perfect socialism without

perfect democracy, or perfect democracy without perfect _

socialism.

I am a Socialist. because, while we struggle toward that
end, which we have not reached as. yet, we need democracy
within the party. It may stumble and it may fail from time
to time, but I trust the democracy of a party more than I
trust a rule from on top, a centralization so great that orders
are handed down from Moscow as in fact they have been
handed down since the formation of the Third International,
so that some of you have been made rather dizzy changing
your minds to keep up with the correct line. ,

I am a Socialist because I am afraid of the over-central-
ization of bureaucracy, even in a noble cause. I know that
in this time, so great are the powers of destruction which
machinery and power and mechanical energy give to men,
that it is of the utmost importance that we should organize
every force to minimize violence, even in the best service of
the cooperative commonwealth. And for that reason, I want
to put the emphasis upon what we can do in orderly fashion,
and the blame for what violence may come, upon those stub-
born and benighted men who would wreck the world before
they._w_ould yieldtheir power to hurt or destroy.

I am a Socialist because I think it is very poor strategy
to put the kind of emphasis that Communists have put in
America upon the inevitability of great scale violence, and
of a dictatorship, described as a dictatorship of the prole-
tariat, and as equivalent to a working class democracy, but
which is in effect a dictatorship of one party, and not a con-
trol by the working class.

That is why I am a Socialist, not because we have made
our party perfect—far from it-—but because its ideals seem
best to enable us to carry on what is true and vital in Ameri-
can tradition, to fulﬁll the American Declaration of Inde-
pendence, and indeed all worthy traditions of brotherhood
and justice under the demands of this age of power-driven
machinery.

I have made a brief but positive statement. I think it
is now necessary for me to turn to an examination of the

position or the line of the Communists, especially where it

differs from the position I have stated. It is not so easy to
turn to examine the Communist’s line, not so easy now as it
would -have seemed a few months ago, because the line itself
to some of us seems bewilderingly different; in some re-

spects, much better——Witness this meeting. In some respects, '

no better at all.

Very Well, then, what about this Communist line as it
looks to a Socialist? Let us begin by seeing in Russia what
it is that some of us Socialists fear. There have been great
achievements in a country whose rulers are dedicated, pas-
sionately dedicated, to the abolition of the profit system, and
to providing abundance for all. But, what troubles us in
Russia and in the Communist’s statement of the Russian
case, or what has heretofore been the statement of the case,
is the fact that we do not observe the withering away of
dictatorship as fast as some of us had hoped when the orig-
inal revolutionary emergency had passed. We do not observe
that that country which seems to be the securest in all
Europe of the great nations, at least, has yet extended the
civil liberty which we think is part of the heritage that men
ought to struggle for. We were greatly troubled that after
the criminal assassination of Kirov there was an answering
terror so that more than one hundred people on the black-
list of the Soviet were put to death, without trial, which
connected them speciﬁcally with the crime. We want justice
for the individual even in times like this. We are disturbed
