Supervisory Parole and Other Features of the Law

By ART DMYTRYK

ORE THAN twelve thousand

foreign-born Americans who

have received ﬁnal orders of deporta-

tion cannot, at present, be deported

because the countries where they were
born will not take them back.

In Los Angeles there are forty-six
people in this category of so-called
"non-deportables,” whose cases are de-
fended by the L.A. Committee for Pro-
tection of Foreign Born. (See the box
on this page.)

The reaction of the average person
who is sympathetic to the present
plight of the foreign born under the
Walter-McCarran Law is to say light-
ly: "So what are they worried about?
They can’t be deported, can they?”

This is a long way from being the
whole truth. In the first place, while
it is true that as things stand now the
Justice Department is not able to de-
port any of these people because they
are no longer nationals of their coun-
tries of birth, the rituation could
change.

Under the Walter-McCarran Law,
a foreign-born American can be de-
ported to a country other than the
country of hi: hirth.

The Justice Department has already
tried to apply this provision of the
Law in the case of a Jewish deportee
born in Russia, whom they tried to
deport to Israel. It did not succeed
in that instance and might not suc-
ceed in future attempts, but the threat
always remains of a deportee being
sent to any country; and a country like-
ly to do a favor of this kind for the
U.S. is not likely to be a comfortable
place for political dissidents.

In the second place, the Walter-
McCarran Law enables the Justice De-
partment to wrap its tentacles around
the non-deportable in a tight grip for
the rest of his life, in the form of
Su_pervisory-Parole. Section 242D of
the Law creates this supervisory-parole,
which has been called "a reﬁned in-

8

strument of persecution.” It makes the
non-deportable foreign-born American
"subject to supervision under regula-
tions prescribed by the Attorney Gen-
eral.”

These regulations, with some sec-
tional differences, require persons on
supervisory-parole to do the following

things:

Report monthly to the lmmigration
Service.

Remain within a certain restricted
area. lln Los Angeles they are not
allowed to leave the County.l

Submit. it asked. to medical and
psychiatric examination.

Give information under oath as to
associates and activities.

Discontinue membership. if any, in
the Communist Party or its "affili-
ates." as may be arbitrarily deﬁned
by the Attorney General, who has
listed hundreds of such alleged
"front" groups.

End all association with Commu-
nists and with any person or organ-
ization "affiliated with" the Com-
munist Party lwhich as Justice Doug-
las declared, in a famous bail case.
that it could compel husband and
wife to separate on political
groundsl.

Violation of any of there regula-
tion; it punirhahle hy a year in priron
or a fine of One Thousand Dollar:
or hoth.

IT WAS to be expected from the day
the Walter-McCarran Law was passed
that persons who have spent their lives
ﬁghting for greater liberty and a ‘bet-
ter life for all Americans would not
long allow this provision to go un-
challenged. The idea of spending the
rest of their lives under a virtual house
arrest, while the threat of brain wash-
ing or of jail constantly hangs over
their heads, is unthinkable.

Accordingly, a number of court ac-
tions were started. The results of these

 

actions were for a long time discour-
aging in the extreme. The lower
courts held that those on supervisory
parole had no valid complaint unlerr
they were persecuted and jailed for
violating the parole. One court even
suggested that this be done.

On last December 12, however, the
Supreme Court agreed with the attor-
neys for fourteen New York non-citiz-
ens that there were serious constitu-
tional issues involved in the question
of supervisory parole, and ordered
their case to be heard in the lower
courts.

Soon after, on January 3rd, the case
of Mrs. Tonie Sentner was heard in a
Federal Court in St. Louis, Missouri,
and is now awaiting decision.

While decision in both cases is a
long way off and might even go against
the petitioners, the very fact that they
can present their case in court with-
out having to expose themselves to im-
prisonment as a condition of challeng-
ing the Law, constitutes a notable vic-
tory.

THE BOX adjoining sets forth only
a few of the many constitutional is-
sues raised by the New York Fourteen,
but they are enough to show clearly
the un-constitutional character of the
Walter-McCarran Law in general and
Supervisory Parole in particular.

While non-citizens are battling to
invalidate supervisory parole, the gov-
ernment, on its side, is initiating crim-
inal proceedings designed to sharpen
its teeth. Having failed miserably in
its attempt to recruit stool pigeons
among deportees, the Justice Depart-
ment has "brought about the indict-
ment of two Chicago men, James Kel-
ler and George Witkovitch, charging
them with “willfully failing to answer
questions concerning their associations
and activities”. If these men are con-
victed, the way will be opened for
many more such prosecutions.

The hundreds of foreign-born Amer-
icans on supervisory parole the coun-
try over, are anxiously awaiting further
developments in all these cases, for
much of their future depends on them.
In the meantime, while they wait they
fight the McCarran Law, believing that
the American people will see that it
is Repealed. For they have a deep faith
in the American people and in Amer-
ican Democracy.

 

 

THE CHALLENGE TO SUPERVISORY PAROLE

BRIEFLY, here are some of the constitutional issues raised by the fourteen
New York petitioners:

1. Supervisory-parole denies clue proceri as guaranteed in the Fifth
and Sixth Amendments, because a person who violates it has not the right
to have a jury that will pass on every fact required to ﬁnd him guilty. A jury
should also consider the question of his being deportable.

2. The Walter-McCarran Law, as applied, is invalid because it violates
the constitutional ban on ex port facto laws (i.e., laws that punish for some-
thing not punishable when it happened.)

3. Supervisory parole denies due process since the government has

no power to-impose any conditions except those incidental to deportation.

4. People on supervisory-parole are deprived of equal protection of
the laws in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Burdens are placed on them
which are not placed on citizens.

5. The Walter-McCarran Law is invalid because it gives arbitrary and
legislative powers to the Attorney General (so called "discretionary” powers)

:by empowering him to place any restrictions he pleases upon the conduct

of persons on supervisory-parole.

General Provisions of the Law
Which Deny Due Process

EARLY EVERYONE in Amer-

ica knows that the Walter—Mc-
Carran Law is "racist and discriminat-
ory.” President Eisenhower himself

"said it.

Just how racist and discriminatory
it is can be seen from the fact that
from a total yearly quota of 154,000
immigrants, a quota of 110,000 or
over seventy percent is allotted to three
countries, England, Germany and lre-
land. The further away from Northern
and Western Europe we go, the small-
er the quotas become. From the so-
called "Asia-Paciﬁc Triangle” (an area
of many nations, inhabited by ﬁfteen
hundred million people—three ﬁfths of
the world’s population!) only a total
of two lhonrancl are allowed to enter
Ihii country each year.

Other characteristics of the Law

have not received condemnation from
so prominent a source as the Presi-
dent, but they have been roundly de-
nounced by people in all walks of life
and in all parts of the nation.

It has often been said, for instance,
that the Walter-McCarran Law treats
the foreign-born like criminals before
they reach our shores and requires the
ﬁnger printing of even visitors; and
continues and even intensiﬁes this
treatment until they depart or die. This
is not rhetoric. It is a fact.

RECENTLY the Justice Department
tried to prosecute a man for allegedly
making misrepresentations to the Im-
migration Service while he was still
in Canada, and was stopped only by a
Federal Court ruling that one coun-
try cannot try a citizen of another
Country for a crime committed in the

 

other country. Though this is prob-
ably an extreme case, every applicant
for entry into the United States is
subjected to a disheartening tangle of
red tape, and no matter how well he
passes every test, he is always subjected
to an arbitrary denialof his application.

The foreign-born in this country,
whether they are newly arrived immi-
grants, or residents for ﬁfty years, must
carry their registration cards with them
at all times and must report their ad-
dresses to the Attorney General once
each year, or be subject to criminal
prosecution.

Foreign born Americans caught in
the web of deportation are denied the
most elementary forms of due process
of law. They are subject to arrest
without warrant and can be held with-
out bail. They are given hearings in
which the same government agency
acts as policeman, prosecutor and judge.
They can and have been denied the
right to confront witnesses used
against them. As in the Hyun case.
They can be given ten-year prison sent-
ences for failing to make efforts to
deport themselves, as in the Heikkenin
case.

' What makes the denial of due proc-
ess for foreign-born Americans 50
tragically absurd is that it is directed
against persons who have committed
no crimes. It is, in fact, the conten-
tion of the Justice Department that
for the very reason that deportation
proceedings are civil and not criminal
ordinary concepts of due process do

not apply.

These are some of the things that
President Eisenhower has not told the
American people about the Walter-
McCarran Law. They are the things
the American people must learn. When
they do they will see to it that the Law
is wiped off the books.

The Resurrection of Citizenship

NATIONWIDE surge is

sweeping the land to reestab-
lish the dignity and security of Amer-
ican citizenship. It carries in its train
even a promise of a more democratic
existence of the citizen than ever be-
fore in American history.

The trend, the unfolding of the re-
born American, is manifest on seem-
ingly unrelated ﬁelds: Labor, the Ne-
gro and the Citizen. Yet the driving
force is the same desire: unencumbered
citizenship.

The impact of the people’s assertion
of full citizenship is bringing our
slumbering democracy alive; with the
citizen well in the driver's seat. In
desegregation, the citizen is united with
at least one branch of the government,
the Supreme Court. In Labor's rise for
new legislation the citizen is greatly
encouraged by the united ranks of or-
ganized labor. And not the least is the
mushroomlike growth of the people’s
demand for a new humane and demo-
cratic immigration and nationality law.

ALL THE MORE unreasonable is the
continued government resistance to re-
placement of the most shameful blot
in the nation’s legislative history, the
Walter-McCarran Law. President Eis-
enhower condemned it as “a glaring
example of failure of our national lead-
ership to live up to high ideals” and
called for "a better law.”
But that was four years ago.

Since that time, most notably in the
present Congress, the government
failed to pass even such modest re-
visions of the law as called for by the
Lehman-Celler, Anfuso and 43 sundry
bills submitted as a result of public
demand.

AS IF TO DEFY the citizenry, the bi-
partisan abuse of American citizens has
grown worse the past year. The fore-
most advocate of second class citizen-
ship, the avowed rebel against consti-
tuted authority, Sen. James 0. East-
land of Mississippi has been appoint-
ed to head the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. In the meantime the Justice
Department, armed with unlimited dis-
cretionary powers, literally overwhelms
the courts by the mounting number of
denaturalization trials and unceremon-

lO

ious expatriation of native-born Amer-
icans.

Southern California is taking the
brunt of this brutal offense against cit-
izens. At present, seven California nat-
uralized citizens face trials defending
their citizenship through the Commit-
tee and its Legal Panel.

Thirty native-born Americans of
Mexican descent, are being defended
by one Los Angeles attorney alone,
against government attempts to annul
their citizenship and exile them to
Mexico.

Ealogio De La Cruz of Wilmington,
and Sam Title of Los Angeles, respect-
ively, have already lost their citizen-
ship during the past year, victimized
by the drive of the Justice Department.
The others, whose able legal defense is
secured by the Los Angeles Committee
for Protection of Foreign Born are:

Rose Cheriiiiz, Executive Director of
the Commitee;

Peter Cbaamt, worker, educator;

Frieda and David Diamond, business
people;

James E. Tohacié, veteran of World
War II;

Sara/.7 arid Abraham Wacher, needle
trade workers.

LACK OF attachment to the Consti-
tution and the Government of the
United States at the time of natural-
ization, is the chief accusation of the
Attorney General’s oflice in all these
political trials of citizenship. The fact
is that by their very participation in
the heroic efforts of labor, the under-
privileged, and of the segregated, they
have displayed the best virtues of
democratic American citizenship.

THE PRESIDENTS, and most of the
proposed compromise legislation dis-
play even more timidity in the protec-
tion of citizenship than in rendering
immigration more humane. A clear-cut
law, reaffirming unassailable Amer-
ican citizenship is yet to be designed.

But while new legislation is pend-
ing, Justice Department administration
of the worst features of a bad Law
must cease, and trials to annul citizen-
ship be stopped.

 

Protection of citizenship as a result
of righteous demand of the citizenry,
has always been the best remedy for
ill concepts, and injurious indifference
of past American governments toward
it. Through such incidents, in fact,
has it been historically established that
naturalized and native-born Americans,
are equal in the inviolability of their
citizenship. V
WHEN THOMAS JEFFERSON con-
demned the Alien Act of 1798, he but
echoed an outraged citizenry:

The alien has been selected as the

first experiment, but the Act has al-

ready marked fhe citizen as its prey.

In 1835, Secretary of State Wm. L.
Marcy, proclaimed to an expectant,
wondering world:

Whenever an individual becomes

clothed with our national character.

be he native born or naturalized cit-
izen. an exile from his early home by
political oppression. or an emigrant

enticed from if by the hopes of a

better fortune for himself and his

posterity, he can claim the protec-
tion of this Government.

And Morton Koszta, American by
choice, in whose behalf the govern-
ment then so deﬁned the value of cit-
izenship, was not yet a citizen; he
simply declared his intention to be-
come one!

Again, in 1881, Senator D. W. Voor-
hees, voicing the indignation of Cali-
fornia citizenry on behalf of Daniel
McSweeney, and other American nat-
uralized citizens of Irish descent, then
languishing in British dungeons, in-
troduced a resolution in Congress, con-
demning the indifference of the gov-
ernment, and declared:

lf the government abandons the cit-
izen to iniustice and oppression.
turns a deaf ear to his iusf demands
either in his own or foreign coun-
tries, such an example of timidity or
indifference must go far to shake the
respect of the people.

IF THAT was true and worthy for
stern remedy of government neglig-
ence, such redress is much more urgent
in 1956, at a time when the entire
nation is ready to move for resurrec-
tion of democratic American citizen-
ship.

Let this be the year of a decisive

I public measure to enact a new nation-

ality law for these United States.

’Y NAME is David Diamond.

I was born in Russia in Czar-

ist days. I began work as a porcelain

apprentice when I was eleven years

old. I had four brothers and four sis-
ters.

In 1910 my older brothers, who had
some time before come to the United
States to- live, sent for the rest of our
family. We lived in Boston at first,
wherel worked for about two years
in restaurants.

When the family moved to New
York, I found work at my own trade,
porcelain work. Soon afterward I be-
came active in trade union organiza-
tions and struggles for better wages
and conditions.

For «helping to organize my shop-
mates-, I was blacklisted in Greenpoint
in Brooklyn. I got a job ‘in my trade
in Trenton, N. J., but after two weeks
I was also blacklisted there.

IN 1917 I met Freda, who soon be-
came my wife. She too had come here
in 1910. We lived in New York City,
where Freda worked in the needle
trades industry. We struggled togeth-
er for the rights of workers. Freda
was very active in the struggle for
good unions in her trade. In fact, she
was many times union chairman of the
shop in which she worked.

Freda too comes from a family of
nine children. She learned to support
her younger brothers and sisters, just
as I was helping to support my old
father and the younger children who
were living in Boston.

There are so many things to tell
about our life and our dreams in the
new country, the United States. When
I was a child in Russia I dreamed
much about the United States, where
people can live in peace and get to-

gether, and have the freedom to or-
ganize to make life worth living. I
remember how my brothers, who came
here ﬁrst to pave the way for our
family, used to write home telling
about life in the United States, mak-
ing me dream about reading good
books, listen to good music, and en-
joy a free cultural life.

Naturally, when we -came here we
tried to live up to these ideas of free-
dom and progress. Is there any crime
in that?

My wife and I joined many cultural
organizations and fraternal groups,
and when we worked in shops or fac-
tories we always joined the union, or
if there wasn’t a union we tried to or-
ganize one.

WE CAME to Los Angeles in 1922.
I soon acquired a new trade as elec-
trician, and here too I took part in
organizing abunion. After a while,
in 1928, I was blacklisted out of the
electrical trade for my active union
work. I then became a laundry truck
driver, and worked at this for 14
years. Here too I helped in the strug-
gle to build the union.

My wife and I have lived in Los
Angeles for the past 34 years. Here
we raised our children, and here we
have never been strangers in our com-
munity, but have always taken part in
the struggles of the people around us
for a better life. Is that wrong?

We consider ourselves to be good
Americans, and have always lived in
the way we believe all good citizens
should live.

OUR DAUGHTER who was born
here is married and has three children.
Our son served in the U. S. Armed
Forces in the South Paciﬁc in the last

war, is also married and has one child.

In 1938, in Los Angeles, my wife
and I applied for naturalization. We
got our ﬁnal papers in‘ "1943, and were
very proud. When we were asked if
we belonged to any anarchist group
or party, we answered truthfully “No.”
No other questions.were asked about
the organizations or trade unions we
belonged to.

The judge who gave us the oath of
citizenship pointed out that the duties
and rights and responsibilities of cit-
izenship were equal in every way to
those of native-born citizens such as
himself.

YET 12 YEARS later, in November
1954, we were served with a federal
court complaint telling us that the
government intended to take away our
citizenship through a trial, charging
us with being somehow subversive and
not entitled to be citizens any longer.

Is this not unfair? How can we be
as good as native-‘born citizens when
after 15 years of being citizens we are
being robbed of our rights because
the government says we belong to an
organization which it now says is sub-
versive? If it was subversive then,
why were we allowed to become cit-
izens? And why is it that we who are
foreign-born can be tried this way for
no crime at all, if native-born citizens
cannot be treated the same?

Our trial has already begun in the
court of Federal Judge Harrison in the
Los Angeles Federal Building, and the
date for further proceedings will be
arranged soon. We beg everyone in-
terested to be in the courtroom to see
for themselves how shamefully foreign-
born citizens are treated under the
Walter-McCarran Immigration and
Nationality Law.

SECOND CLASS CITIZENS:

The Rose Chernin Denaturalization Case

THE TIME IS FEBRUARY 1929!

PLACE: The Federal District Court in
Bronx County, New York, N.Y. Those
present are Rose C/aernin Knmitz, sev-
eral witnesses, the Court Clerk, and
the Presiding Federal Judge.

(Rose Chernin is on the witness
stand.)

JUDGE: I have before me your ap-
plication for naturalization. It says here
that you were born in Russia on Sep-
tember 14, 1903, and that in 1914,

when you were 11 years old, you came .

to the United States of America with
your family to reside here permanent-
ly. You lived in Waterbury, Connec-
ticut, where you received your grade
school and high school education.

In 1926 you married an American
citizen, and subsequently, in 1927 you
applied for the rights of citizenship.

( A PAUSE: then, to the Court Clerk: )

The Clerk will please read the oath
of allegiance.

CLERK (reads): ". . . swear tlaat I will
rapport and defend the Constitu-
tion and law; of tbe United State;
of America against all enemier,
Foreign and Domertic, and t/oat
I bear trite fait/9 and allegiance to
the Jame.”

ROSE CHERNIN: (Repeating oath)
I do!

JUDGE: I hereby grant Rose Chernin
Kusnitz the rights and privileges of
American citizenship.

SO ROSE CHERNIN became an
American citizen and was told she had
rights and privileges as a native-born
citizen.

There it a considerable lapre of
time . . .

Time for Rose Chernin to raise a
family. Time to live through the great

12

depression, and to struggle with the
masses of the people for relief, and

for social security and unemployment
insurance, because of “mass unemploy-
ment. Time to takea leading part in
the ﬁght for equal rights for all, re-
gardless of race, color, creed, or polit-
ical belief.

Were these not worthy American
ideals? Was this form of active living
not exercise of the rights and priv-
ileges of citizenship?

Time continued to pass. The de-
pression gave way to war. The Great
Anti-Fascist War was fought from
1941 to 1945, and the foreign-born,
most of whom knew from bitter ex-
perience what Hitlerism meant to their
lives, fought with everything they
could command to defeat this vicious
international scourge.

At last the victory came. But with
the peace came the crisis of the "cold
war” and a decade of /oyrteria and re-
actionary attacks on civil rights.

The Smith Act was invoked to jail
Communists in 1949. In 1950 the Mc-
Carran Act was passed, to impose reg-
istration of all political dissenters and
provide concentration camps for all,
in the manner of Hitlerism. In 1952,
with the hysteria still mounting, came
passage of the notoriously "racist”
Walter-McCarran Immigration Law,
stiffening already harsh anti-foreign-
born laws and adding worse ones, with
the obvious intent of terrorizing 14
million foreign-born citizens and non-
citizens into silent compliance with re-
action.

How had Rose Chernin fared dur-
ing this long passage of time?

She had never ceased to ﬁght against
injustice and unconstitutional actions,
for to her this meant the full and free
exercise of citizenship. '

THE SCENE CHANGES AGAIN.

Twenty-six years have passed since
Rose Chernin became an American
citizen in a New York City courtroom.

Now she is once more in a federal
district court, this time in Los Angeles,
with government and defense attor-
neys, court clerk, and Judge Westover.
In the visitors’ seats are many of Roses
relatives, friends and neighbors, shock-
ed by the shameful proceeding they are
witnessing . . .

GOV’T ATTORNEY: . . . we hereby
present an amended petition to the
court for revocation of the naturaliza-
tion of Rose Chernin Kusnitz, on the
grounds that in 1929 the defendant was
not attached to the Constitution when
she became a citizen.

JUDGE: Trial date is set as June 6,
1956, in this court.

Yer, 26 year: after granting /yer
citizen;/.2ij7, t/ae government want; to
cancel it. Is American citizenship some-
thing to be so solemnly granted—and
so lightly taken away? Is it only a
temporary grant to the foreign-born?

Has Rose Chernin in the meanwhile
committed some heinous crime?

No, no crime has been committed
to justify this despicable act.

For over two decades Rose Chernin
has exercised her freedom to think, to
speak, to act against injustice that
violates her concepts of human decen-
cy—citizenship based on American
democratic principles.

WHEN PROCEEDINGS first began
against her, initiated by the Depart-
ment of Justice through the Immigra-
tion Service, she had for three years
been Executive Director of the L.A.
Committee for Protection of Foreign
Born, leading the ﬁght against the de-
portation terror and for the Repeal

. of repressive immigration laws.

In the meanwhile, in 1951, she, with
13 other California working class lead-

 

 

ers, had been arrested under the Smith
Act in an effort to send her to jail, and
thus behead the Committee, which un-
der her leadership was frustrating and
exposing to public view the harsh en-

forcement of “Operation Terror”
against the foreign-born in this area.
The charge was that she “conspired"
to advocate force and violence.

After months in jail and a six-month
ordeal of trial in 1952, she was sent-
enced to ﬁve years imprisonment and
ten thousand dollars ﬁne. Released on
bail pending appeal, she at once re-
turned to her militant defense activi-
ties as head of the Committee in 1953.
Her case was appealed before the Cir-
cuit Court, and is now before the
U. S. Supreme Court.

This delay was too much for the Im-
migration Service. With new repres-
sive weapons, broadened to include
naturalized citizens by provisions of
the Walter-McCarran Law of 1952, in
1955 it ﬁled revocation of citizenship
procee.ding.r against her.

The government was compelled by
argument of pre-trial motions to amend
its complaint twice, to disclose the
names of witnesses, and to observe due
process by agreeing to bring them to
the trial. Finally, the trial was recent-
ly set for June 6th, 1956.

AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP is a most
precious possession. Immigrants have
always dreamed of the day when they
would become eligible for citizenship,
which carries a ﬁne tradition of strug-
gle against feudal tyranny and for
political freedom and self-government.

To win such a glorius status, and
then to have it stolen away, is a bitter
loss, a cruel tragedy.

It is, indeed, doubly a tragedy be-
cause revocation of citizenship means
in turn the opening up of the dread
path to deportation—that is, to EXILE
from family and friends and the roots
grown in the U.S. during decades of
residence and family life here.

Such a “temporary” form of citizen-
ship makes a mockery of the ﬁne prin-

 

ciples for which Washington, Jeffer-
son, Lincoln and others have fought.
It means punishment far beyond that
imposed for a major crime.

The government charges Rose Cher-
nin with misrepresentation when she
became a citizen "because, it alleges,
she was a member of various Commu-
nist organizations or affiliates, and
therefore could not be “attached [0
the Constitution."

This they intend to prove through
professional informers, who for a fee
will testify to what the government
charges. Rose Chernin in a sworn af-
ﬁdavit asserts that to the best of her
knowledge she never knew these "wit-
nesses” in the 1927-1929 period, and
in fact knew of them later only by
reading about them in newspapers.

Furthermore, in today’s distorted
frame of mind with regard to Com-
munists and radicals, nieniherrhip per
re if proven (in the still legal Commu-
nist Party), is presumed to prove ad-
vocacy of force and violence to over-
throw the U.S. government.

This was ruled against in the Schnei-
dernian case decision by the Supreme
Court written by Justice Murphy in
a saner clay, wherein the government
was denied the power to revoke citizen-
ship on grounds of Communist Party
membership.

Justice Wiley Rutledge, concurring,
wrote:

“Immediately we are concerned with
only one man. Actually though in-
directly, the decision affects millions.
If seventeen years after a federal
court adjudged him entitled to be
a citizen, that judgment can be nul-
liﬁed and he can be stripped of his
most precious right . . . no natural-
 petson’s citizenship is or can
jibe secure. If this can be done after
that length of time (17 years) it
can be done after 30 or 40 years

. . . [How propheticl] . . . it can
be done for thousands or tens of
thousands of others.

No citizen with rach a threat hang-
ing over hi: head coitld he free . .

 

 

Such a citizen would not be admitted
to liberty. His best course would be
silence or hypocrisy. Thir ii" not cit-
izenrhip.” [Emphasis added]

In addition, if such revocation of cit-
izenship becomes common practice,
as the Attorney General swears it will
(in at least “ten thousand” cases),
not even the native-born citizen can
feel secure in his rights and privileges.

For, as Jefferson noted in 1798, an
attack on what appears to be a "vul-
nerable minority”—for example, the
foreign-born, or political dissenters—,—-
inevitably leads to suppression of the
rights of native-born citizens automati-
cally.

VICTORY IN THE ROSE CHERNIN
CASE is imperative for every Amer-
ican, every lover of freedom, every
ﬁghter for liberty and equality, every-
one who respects and cherishes the
Constitution and our democratic heri-
tage.

You can help in the fight. Write
to your Congressman to support Re-
peal of the Walter-McCarran Law.
Write to the Attorney General, Wash-
ington, D.C. urging that proceedings
to revoke the citizenship of Rose Cher-
nin Kusnitz be dropped forthwith.

Lastly, you can help hy donating to
the fund which will enable us to pro-
vide the necessary legal defense, and
appeal to the highest court if neces-
sary (Six Thousand Dollars will be
needed to carry the case through the
appelate court). Please make checks

SECOND CLASS CITIZENS:

The Sarah Wacher Story

THE UNITED STATES is my

country by choice, not by birth.
Does this make me a second-class cit-
izen? I feel just the contrary. By
choosing this country and its demo-
cratic freedoms for all, as my own
land,,I cherish it all the more deeply.

Corning here from Czarist Russia,
where my people suffered persecution,
pogroms, and many forms of oppres-
sion, I am forever grateful for this free-
dom and proud to behave and to be
an American citizen.

MANY PEOPLE may ask why then
didn't I become a citizen much sooner
than I did ( I was granted naturaliza-
tion papers in 1942)?

There are manyreasons. Although
immigrants theoretically enjoyed all the
freedom and privileges of this land,
the life of most immigrants was very
hard. There were many hardships to
overcome and adjustments to make,
such as language difﬁculties, poor work-
ing conditions, and the problem of
making a living.

When I arrived here in 1912 as a
young girl, the oldest of six orphaned
children who were left penniless and
compelled to shift for themselves, I
had the problem of not only support-
ing myself but helping support the
younger ones. In a new land with
strange customs and an unfamiliar lan-
guage it was no easy matter.

These early years were ones of con-
stant adjustment, changing jobs, un-
employment, ﬁnding new places to
live.

14

HARD AS this was, I did manage to
declare my intentions of becoming a
citizen, after Congress had passed the
Women’s Suffrage Amendment to the
Constitution. However, by the time
the required two years residence had
passed and I was ready to apply for
my naturalization papers, I found my-
self compelled to live in another town,
looking for work and with no money
and no friends to serve as witnesses.
My first papers therefore lapsed.

When years later I ﬁnally succeeded
in gettingmy-papers, it was my hap-
piest and proudest day. At last I could
fully participate in the life of my
country.

Why is my right to citizenship chal-
lenged now? What crime have I com-
mitted?

WHEN I STARTED to work in the
men’s clothing industry many decades
ago in Buffalo, New York, under
sweatshop conditions, life was almost
unbearable. Like most other workers
laboring under those terrible condi-
tions, I welcomed the appearance of
an organizer sent in by the Amalga-
mated Clothing Workers of America.
I joined the union and became active
in its affairs, going out to visit other
workers at their homes.

This forced me to stop going to
night school, which I loved. My union
activity also meant a risk to my job,
and later on I actually did lose my
job. But I have always been happy
at the thought that in my own small
way I helped toward the building of

the trade unions which have improved
the standard of living of millions of
organized and unorganized workers,
and today are seventeen millions
strong.

* In the course of time I joined and
became active in women's and cultural
organizations, to further advance the
culture which the Jewish people and
manyother peoples brought with them
to this country, where they have been
woven into a pattern enriched ‘by many
cultures.

WHEN IN 1929 and the years immed-
iately following, our country was hit
by the greatest economic crisis in his-
tory, I joined and helped. to build the
Unemployed Council, which put forth
the demands of the jobless workers and
those threatened with unemployment,
for Unemployed Insurance and Social
Security. These eventually became the
law of the land and are today enjoyed
by millions of workers (some of whom
don't even know the simple facts about
the serious struggle that had to be
waged at great sacrifice, to obtain these
much-needed social reforms).

DURING WORLD WAR TWO, I
joined with the others like me to help
the war effort and defeat the Hitler
hordes that in war years destroyed--—
murdered—one-third of my people and
threatened to enslave the entire world.

I stand up against any discrimination
or oppression to the hest of my ability.
I f snch principles and activities are
crimes I plead guilty.

MICHlGAN'S GOV. G. MENNEN

The’ Walter-McCarran Act was

would restore the privileges of place
of birth, of nationality and creed—-
The golden door of which Emma
Lazarus wrote is now plated with tarn-
ished brass.

”The realistic and American Leh-
man Immigration bill should be pass-
ed." .

ABOUT Two YEARS ago I was

served a subpoena by the Justice
Department. Why? What did I do?
What criminal act did I commit? Did
I murder, rob, or defraud anybody?
Did I fail to pay my in-come tax or in
any way violate any law? Nothing
of the kind.

After almost 44 years of residence
in this country which is mine by choice,
devotion, and love, I became an un-
desired, second-class citizen. Why?
Looking back to all these years I’ve
lived here I can’t ﬁnd anything to
feel guilty or ashamed of.

Why rbould my citizembip be re-
1/oléed?

WHEN I CAME to the U.S. (Cleve-
land, Ohio) in 1912 to make my home
here, I was a young man of 18. Com-
ing from a small village I was not
aware or interested in any economic or
political problems. All I was interest-
ed in was learning a trade so that I
could earn a living for myself and
help support my mother.

Before I had a chance to adjust my-
self and enjoy the freedom that my
new country gave me, the First World
War broke out. Having been born
and brought up in Austria (then a
part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
under Hapsburg rule, but even then
a country that offered comparatively
more freedom to Jewish people than

SECOND CLASS CITIZENS:

The Abe Wacher Story

Czarist Russia) I was, as a result of
my early bringing up, sympathetic to
my country of birth.

Thus, when the U.S. entered the war
against the Central Powers, not un-
derstanding enough about the war, I
claimed exemption as an "enemy ali-
en” which I always regretted.

In later years I was denied citizen-
ship papers because of this.

As the First World War went on,
however, the issues became clearer
and I -changed my viewpoint and atti-
tude and tried with all my power to
help win the war against the Kaiser
Germany.

WORKING IN the ladies’ garment
industry under open shop conditions
and for starvation wages I began to
feel the need for a union. When the
I.L.G.W.U. in 1918 carried on an or-
ganization campaign, I was one of the
ﬁrst to join. I have been a member
in good standing ever since and am
very proud of my union record. I was
twice elected delegate of my local to
the National Convention of the union.
I was also elected vice-president of my
local.

During the economic crisis of 1929
and afterwards, I, like millions of oth-
er workers was hard hit and keenly
felt the economic insecurity. At that
time I was a highly skilled worker in

my trade. Novertheless, I lost my job
and was forced to work with pick and
shovel as a laborer on W.P.A. I then
joined the unemployed council which
led the ﬁght for relief and work. Un-
employed Insurance and Social Secur-
ity is taken for granted now and mil-
lions of workers are beneﬁtting by it,
but it wasn’t gotten so easy. It was
a long struggle. It took two Hunger
Marches to Washington to petition
Congress. I went on the first Hunger
March serving as a scout for the West-
ern Division. ’

I also "became conscious of the need
to join and help build fraternal and
cultural organizations.

DURING THE New Deal days, in
1942, I again applied for and was
granted citizenship.

During all my years of residence in
the U.S., my adopted country, I have
never committed any crime or broken
any law. I tried and believe succeeded
to live as an honest, law abiding cit-
izen, a good union man, and good co-
worker with my fellow-workers in the
shop.

But it seems that this is my sole
crime, to struggle to better the condi-
tions for my fellow—workers and my-
self, and I am being punished by be-
ing declared to be an undesired, sec-
ond-class citizen.

SECOND CLASS CITIZENS:

The James E. Toback Story

AMES E. TOBACK, U. S. Army

veteran who served in World

War Two, was awarded his citizenship

for this patriotic service to the nation.
That was in September 1944.

Eleven years later, in September,
1955, he was visited by a U. S. Mar-
shal in his Carslbad, California home
and served with a government com-
plaint launching proceedings in federal
district court to cancel his citizenship,
on alleged grounds that he obtained.
his naturalization certiﬁcate “fraud-
ently” inasmuch is he "concealed” facts
as to his political views when being
honored with oﬂicial grant of citizen-
ship in 1944.

"There was no ‘concealment’ of
views,” Mr. Toback declares. "The nat-
uralization examiner who approved my
application for citizenship was fully
aware of my political views."

THE FACT WAS that there was noth-
ing wrong, nothing illegal, in the views
he held in 1944. '

However, times have changed, and
the fact today is that the government
is perpetrating a fraud on the Amer-
ican people, by singling out citizens
who were born in other lands and per-
secuting them by cancellation of cit-
izenship because the political views of
years ago are now considered to be
"subversive.”

Native-born citizens are not subject
to similar penalties, regardless of their
views or affiliations.

This is what is meant by recond-
clar: citizen;/aip—citizenship that is
merely loaned, that may be cancelled
because of an accident of ‘birth; a
shameful disregard of American demo-
cratic and constitutional principles.

THE FEDERAL COURT action which
thus places James E. Toback, Amer-
ican citizen, in an inferior category
and threatens to strip him of his rights
as citizen, is based upon provisions
of the Walter-McCarran Immigration
and Nationality Law, which has been
widely condemned by both major po-
litical parties and spokesmen of every
important religious and other organ-
ization. ' ' "

16

This persecution and punishment for
beliefs and affiliations is distinctly un-
constitutional, on various grounds: for
the Constitution states explicitly that
no one shall be punished for act: in the
past (let alone beliefs) which were
not punishable at the time commit-
ted; nor shall such an ex port facto
law be passed by the U.S. Congress.

Such procedure violates common
sense and decency.

How shameful too is the fact that
denaturalization automatically opens
the way to deportation—-i.e. exile—-
for a person who has lived in the Unit-
ed States for ﬁfty years!

JAMES E. TOBACK was not quite
ﬁve years old when he was brought to
the United States from the Ukraine.
That was in 1906—nearly ﬁfty years
ago.

His formal schooling began almost
immediately, and his entire education
was carried on and completed in Amer-
ican schools. But for the accident of
his birth in the Ukraine, he is a total
American product.

He grew to youth, then to manhood,
in Eastern cities, working at various
jobs: shirt factory, advertising agency,
silk salesman, until he came to Cali-
fornia.

After his honorable discharge from
the U.S. Army in August, 1943, he ap-
plied for citizenship on the basis of
his services, and after investigation and
questioning duly received his certiﬁ-
cate of naturalization, in September

of 1944.

In the years that followed, he worked
in stores, and eventually became part
owner of a general merchandise store
in Oceanside near San Diego. It was
in the years when the “cold war” de-
veloped, after World War Two had
ended with the defeat of Hitler Ger-
many and Japan, that James E. Toback
was subjected to almost continuous
harassment by Immigration and Nat-
uralization Service agents, who snooped
and questioned neighbors about his
political views and associations, char-
acterizing him as “subversive” and a
"danger to national security.”

IN APRIL, 1954, when he was sub-
poena’d before the House Un-Amer-
ican Activities Committee in San Di-
ego, he refused to testify as to the
political views and activities of former
friends. As a result, his landlord threat-
ened to cancel his lease, forcing him
to go out of business .

"Immigration and Naturalization
Service men hounded me for years,”
Mr. Toback declares angrily. "If I'd
be absent from my house for a few
days, they’d be around intimidating my
neighbors and so trying to intimidate
me. When I refused to become an in-
former, I knew that they wouldn’t rest
until they found some gimmick to get
back at me. So of course they called
me ‘subversive’ too.”

Of course the agents of the Justice
Department found their 'gimmick'—-
a provision conveniently included in
the “racist and discriminatory” Walter-
McCarran Law (as President Eisen-
hower described it). Not content with
driving him out of business, they in-
voked the “second-class citizenship”
provisions of the law, and charged him
with “fraud” for concealing the “fact”
that he once belonged to an organiza-
tion which allegedly advocated "vi-
olent overthrow” of the U. S. govern-
ment.

If this move is successful, and James
E. Toback loses his citizenship, he will
automatically be subjected to deporta-
tion proceedings. Imagine the inhu-
manity of this!—deportation after hav-
ing been educated, reared, nurtured and
conditioned by the facts of ﬁfty years of
life in the United States: Exiled.’

Such is the criminal and cruel effect
of the Walter-McCarran Law.

FOR A PROGRAM OF ACTION:

Repeal the Law—Now, in l956!

By LENNIE LUDEL

Tli-IE PRESIDENTIAL election of
1952 took place at a crucial time,
our nation was engaged in a “Police
Action" in Korea. This unpopular war
was sustained through the passage of
police state legislation. Added to the
battleﬁeld casualties was the toll of
civil liberties for the American peo-
ple. One of the most repressive laws
of this period was the Walter-McCar-
ran Act which went into effect in
December of that year. In addition to
his campaign pledge to bring an early
end to the War, Eisenhower’s promise
of revision of this undemocratic law
contributed to his victory.

This year is also a decisive presi-
dential election year. The elections
take place in a new and optimistic
atmosphere. Two Vital elements lay
the basis for an emergence from the
period of Cold War hysteria.

GOV. AVERlL'L HARRIMAN
OF NEW YORK

”It is a national disgrace that no
effective steps have been taken to
remove the Walter-McC'arran Act.

"This is a sh-ameful business. It
violates our proudest tradition. It can-
not. and must not be allowed to con-
tinue."

 

The talks at Geneva have laid a
‘basis for compromise that are leading
to Economic and Cultural exchange
and the ground for the establishment
of Peace.

The heroic struggles of the Negro
people for ﬁrst-class citizenship is forc-
ing the issue of constitutional guaran-
tees and the nationwide support this
movement is receiving is bringing
about a return to our traditional Amer-
ican freedoms.

IT WOULD be incorrect to say that
the period of hysteria is ended or that
the ability of reaction to maneuver
has been dissipated. The W/alter-Mo
Carran Act Repeal movement has
made tremendous gains and as a result
is confronted with new dangers.

In response to mass pressure the ad-
ministration recently made proposals
for modiﬁcation of the Law.

These proposals are a divisive tactic
granting mild reform, re: minor ad-
justment of the racist immigration
quotas and more leniency on ﬁnger
print requirements on the one hand;
while doing nothing to change the sec-
ond class citizenship imposed on 14,-
000,000 foreign born Americans. They
would limit access to the courts by
granting "discretionary” power to the
Attorney General to determine the
rights of the victim to trial.

Among additional reactionary pro-
posals is the demand that punitive de-
portation procedures be speeded up for
hardened criminals and "subversives.”

THERE IS almost universal opposition
to the racist nature of our present Im-
migration quotas. President Gronchi
of Italy recently in the U.S. felt com-
pelled to refer to this.

 

Flying into the face of the meagre
concessions made on this score by the
Administration was the selection of
Dixiecrat Senator Eastland to head the
powerful Senate Judiciary Subcommit-
tee. This arch racist, product of the
Southern decadence that has stifled
progress through its continued control
in both houses of Congress, is an
avowed opponent of a decent immi-
gration policy.

The Administration cannot evade its
responsibility in Eastland’s appoint-
ment and place the blame on to the
slim Democratic majority in Congress.
Senator Knowland, Republican whip
and his junior partner Kuchel, both
of California, hastened to give the
administration’s stamp of approval to
this reactionary. The only outspoken
objections came from Senator Morse,
and from Senator Lehman who is the
spearhead of the Walter-McCarran
movement in the Senate.

With Senator Eastland bottling up
repeal legislation in the Senate and
Rep. Walter doing likewise in the
House, the need for redoubling our
efforts to achieve action in the pres-
ent session is obvious.

THE CENTER of the repeal cam-
paign in the Capital is the Anfuso dis-
charge petition. The Anfuso Bill ad-
vances the positive features of the
Lehman-Celler Bill and establishes :1
statute of limitations of ﬁve years.
Representative Anfuso in an answer
to the L.A. Committee’s query, indi-
cates his petition to release this Bill
from the House Judiciary Sub-Co;n-
mittee, headed by Walter, has not yet
received the 218 necessary signatures.

THE l.OS ANGELES COMMITTEE FOR PROTECTION OF FOREIGN BORN
is an unaffiliated non-partisan body devoted to the preservation of the democratic rights
of all foreign-bom residents of the United States.

It is not a membership organization. Outside of its officers, staff members, and active
sub-committee workers, it relies upon other organizations and groups, as well as indi-
viduals, for sponsorship, ﬁnancial support, and active aid in carrying out all or part of
its program.

The Committee Program Is:—

To conduct public and legal activity against discrimination, harassment, and perse-
cution directed against the foreign-born because of color, race, national origin, or political
and religious beliefs; in order to perpetuate for the 14 million foreign-born residents of
the United States the basic democratic concepts of equality and freedom.

To prevent the degrading of foreign-born citizens to second-class, inferior status.

To preserve the families of the foreign-born, by preventing the callous lifelong exiling
of victims of deportation from their American-born relatives.

To bring a halt to the lawless mass deportation policy directed against Mexican
workers induced to cross the border to work in our ﬁelds.

To widen the understanding that the native—born and foreign-bom have mutual in-
terests in defending our constitutional rights, which must be preserved for all or be weak-
ened and endangered for all.

To arouse widespread and unceasing public protest against the application of the
hundreds of unfair and inhumane provisions of the Walter-McCarran Law (Immigra-
ti0I1 51 Nationality Act Of 1952); which reduces citizens of foreign birth to second-class
status, applies racist doctrines to our immigration policy, widens grounds for lifetime
exiling of persons from their American families through deportation, regardless of their
length of residence here, establishes un-American practices of fingerprinting and registra-
tion for non-citizens over 14 years of age, and abolishes the constitutional safeguards
for freedom of the individual hitherto applied to all residents of the United States.

To work without halt to effect Repeal of the Walter-McCarran Law and secure en-
actment of a new, humane, democratic immigration code.

The COMMITTEE carries out this program by issuing printed and mimeographed
information; by organizing meetings, conferences, concerts, festivals and other affairs;
and through cooperations with trade unions, community, religious and other organizations
on speciﬁc issues relating to defense of foreign-born rights.

The COMMITTEE offers its services and those of its legal panel attorneys to persons,
families, and organizations facing problems of discrimination, deportation, revocation of
citizenship, naturalization, and harassment.

In turn the COMMITTEE requests your support for its work, ﬁnancially and other-
wise.

GROUNDS FOR REVOCATION OF CITIZENSHIP

NATURALIZATION: Regardless of the length of time citizenship has
been held, it may be revoked through Section, 340 and sub-sections of the
Walter-McCarran Law. Naturalization may be revoked for:

CONCEALMENT OF A MATERIAL FACT OR WILFUL MISREPRESENTA-
TION (which is so general as to make for entrapment, if the government
wishes to proceed against any person.)

CONVICTION FOR CONT'EMPT FOR REFUSAL TO INFORM FOR A
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE (which is a denial of the Fifth Amendment

MEMBERSHIP IN OR AFFILIATION WITH A "PROSCRIBED" ORGAN-
IZATION (i.e. one arbitrarily placed on the Attorney General's list of "sub-

DERIVATIVE CITIZENSHIP of minor or spouse may be revoked in certain
cases of denaturalization as stated above.

DUAL CITIZENSHIP, in which one is a native-born U. S. citizen, and de-
rives the nationality of a non_-citizen parent, (as do Americans of Mexican
heritage, e.g.) may lead to loss of U. S. citizenship for several reasons, in-
cluding dishonorable discharge from U. S. armed forces, service for foreign
government, and other reasons. Important tests now being made in federal

 

us the Bill of Rights and put the au-
thors of the Alien and Sedition Laws
to tour.

During the Civil War period when
the domination of our National life by
the Slavocracy threatened our demo-
cratic development, the people led by
Abraham Lincoln defeated the Copper-
heads and ‘Know Nothings.’

During the Reconstruction which
followed the Civil War, the grip of the
Slavocracy in the Federal Government
was broken. This victory for progress
is attributable to Frederick Douglas,
Negro Abolitionist, and Thaddeus Stev-
ens, Radical Republican Senator from
Pennsylvania. Douglas, spokesman for
his people, recognized the kinship be-
tween the liberation struggles of the
Mexican and Irish people and the Ne-
gro people. He was a foremost cham-
pion of Women’s rights.

In 1876 the Republican President
Hayes sold out the American people,
the Negro people in particular. By
abandoning the mandate of the Civil
War, the way was paved for the re-
entry into American Political Life of
the Southern bourbons. Today, the
Eastlands dominate key congressional
Committees and are the “Albatross
around the neck” of the American
people, as recently stated by Mr. Mitch-
ell of the NAACP.

The new secessionists through their
manifesto defying the Supreme Court
ruling on desegregation, are attempt-
ing to turn back the pages of history
100 years. It is in this context that
the State Government of Alabama is
prepared to consider the "Deportation”
of its entire Negro population! It is
no accident that one of the earliest
victims of the Cold War deportation
hysteria, just prior to the Walter-Mc-
Carran Act was Ferdinand. Smith,
maritime union militant, a Negro.

THE STRUGGLE for the Repeal of
the Walter-McCarran Act is part of
the ﬁght to reinstitute democracy for
all Americans. It is in this sense that
it fuses with the ﬁght for ﬁrst-class
citizenship being waged by the Negro
people. The racist nature of the Act
directly affects the Negro people in
regards to quotas from the West In-
dies and Africa, as well as deporta-
tions of militants such as the afore-
mentioned.

The maneuvers of the Administra-
tion and its Dixiecrat Allies, require
that we broaden the Repeal ﬁght and
participate actively on the Legislative
front in the 1956 election campaign.

In developing our campaign, there
is a need to bring clarity, introduce
new methods and generate the en-
thusiasm that offsets complacency and
spells victory.

 

T'HE A.F.L. AND C.I.O.

THE AFL AND C'lO at their I955
unity conference called for early liber-
alization of the Law so that "It. will
reflect our democratic and humani-
tarian traditions."

THE UNITED AUTOMOBILE
WORKERS’ UNION

"Let's make it clear —— we want
Action NOT WORDS . . . I

"Both the Republican and Demo-
cratic Parties have failed to keep their
I952 pledges to amend the Walter-
McC'arran Immigration and Nationality
Act to remove the national origins
quota system and other unjust and

inhuman provisions."

 

In addition to eliminating the mcirt
and dircriminatory immigmtion poli-
cier in the prerent Law, the L.A. Com-
mitte it nrging the following eirenticzl
minimum changer:

l. Constitutional guarantee of
due process of law must be rein-
stated. In California, the brunt of
the denial of Civil Rights under
the Law is felt in the Mexican-
American community.

2. Establish a statute of limi-
tations prohibiting denaturaliza-
tion or deportation for any rea-
son ,after ﬁve years residence in
the United States.

3. Transfer the Administration
of Immigration and Naturaliza-
tion affairs to a Commission
which operates separate and a-
part from the Department of Jus-
tice, which under the Law now
has jurisdiction.

To implement thir program demand;
an active participation in all pharer
of the coming Legiilcztioe and Elec-

toral hizttler. Here are 107726 of the

immediate reqnirementx

1. Pressure must be put on all
Southern California Congressmen

to Sign the Anfuso discharge peti- A

tion and bring his Bill to the
ﬂoor before the Summer adjourn-
ment of Congress.

2. All State Assemblymen must

be visited during the Recess of
the Legislature, scheduled for ear-

ly April, to urge a Memorializa-
tion of Congress on Repeal or
Revision of the Law.

3. Letters and resolutions
should be sent to Eisenhower de-
manding a more genuine and
comprehensive revision of the
Law.

4. Letters should be sent and
public demands must be made of
our U.S. Senators Knowland and
Kuchel for the removal of the rac-
ist Eastland from the Chairman-
ship of the Judiciary Committee.

5. Congressmen should be visit-
ed by delegations including de-
portees, and requested to submit
Individual Bills around such
cases.

In essence, this is the program and
the basic action to be taken now and
in the foreseeable future if Repeal or
Revision is to be achieved in 1956.
Brieﬂy, some of the methods that can
bring this about are as follows:

1. House meetings for the pur-
pose of letter writing.

2. Polls for door to door work to
acquaint the people with the Law
and the Repeal Campaign.

3. Telephone Polls to neighbors,
an excellent way to establish new
friends and contacts for the Campaign.

4. Petition Campaigns and use of
these petitions in Visitations to Con-
gressmen. Where petitions of other
organizations are available to cooperate
in the campaign.

 

5. Make appointments and visit
Assemblymen, Congressmen and Can-
didates for all offiices.

6. Distribute leaﬂets and literature
at shop gates, meetings and Confer-
ence and in the neighborhoods to en-
gage wide sections of the people in
Repeal actions.

7. Develop demonstrative forms of
action fitting in with the Elections such
as Street Meetings, using Sound Trucks,
Repeal Buttons and Stickers.

8. Participate in all forms of Elec-
tion actions at Political Club meet-
ings, Conventions and Rallies.

9. Lastly, to stimulate as many
broad coalition actions in the areas
as possible with the guarantee that in
each area there will be at least one
public meeting under the Committee’s
auspices in each area to present the
Repeal Program.

THE STORY OF A TREE

This is the story of a tree in our town.

A long time ago a sapling was transplanted in the front
yard of a house, then in the outshirts of the town.

This little tree was hrought down from the mountains.
The loosely levelled dirt of the flat land was strange to it.
But somehow it grew.

It was an ordinary tree. It grew at an ordinary, unspec-
tacular rate. After the first rain, the tree sent out hair-fine
roots into, the ground. With the wonderful sensitivity of all
living things, the roots felt each grain of the fertile earth—
emhraced it, loved it, made each grain its own. And the ground
hecame firm andsafe for man.

The tree shot out tender new leaves, golden green in the
sunshine. Each leaf hreathed the air, sending out fresh air
all around it, and singing a silent song of joy to those who
could hear. _

In the Spring, the tree opened clusters of sweet fragrant
flowers. Bees came to gather honey. People smelled the
fragrance in the night air, and their sleep was somehow made
more peaceful.

. In the Summer, the tree hore a dense foliage. Children
danced around it. A community of hirds nested in it, mahing

all the gay noises of living. The tree grew as naturally as the
children grew into youhtful lovers.

The lovers carved their names upon the tree.

The family ate picnic lunches under the cool shade of its
hranches. _

Old men leaned against its sturdy trunh, resting.

In the Fall, the tree was full of fruit. The hoys climhed
to gather it. The hirds peched at it. The ants and the hugs
made lines to it. The earth drank the succulency of the ripe
fa,llen_,fruit. The fragrance of the fruit was sweeter than that
of thhu flowers, as a young mother is lovelier than a maiden.

In the winter, the tree, now taller than the house, hug-

ging it, guarding it, gave a sense of protection against winds,
rainstorms and unknown fears.

Even from afar, the tree gave a feeling of strength, dig-
nity, and a promise of growth——-not only in itself, hut also
in the self of each who saw it.

The tree was an ordinary tree, hut it grew large, and the
townspeople grew with it, loving it. The town also grew.

One day surveyors came to widen the street. They said
the tree, which would protrude too far into the new street,
must he tahen out.

The people nearhy who loved the tree, protested, hut to
no avail.

A few days later a snarling hulldozer came armed with
heavy chains to uproot the tree.

Dogs yapped at the hulldozer. Children ran around the
tree, yelling, "Stop! Stop!” The hirds chirruped in alarm.

The family of the house sheltered hy the tree sat on the
ground under it, as though they were at a grim picnic, saying,
"No! No!” The hoys who had climhed every hranch now
climhed again on to the tree, shouting, "Never! Never!”
The old man leaned against the tree trunh, declaring, ”You

can’t do" that!” The lovers joined hands to heep the hull-
dozer away from the tree and the heart—shapes that hore their
names.

All said with determination: ”The tree is a part of us,
and no one is going to uproot it!”

Together, they made their voices heard. Together, they
stopped the hulldozer!

"That is the simple story of the little tree that grew to he
a hig tree in our town. The newly widened street now runs
straight through the town, until it comes to the tree, where
it curves ever so slightly, as  to say "Greetings” to the old
tree, and to the ordinary people who saved it from destruction.

Dedicated to my fellow-victims of the
Walter-McCarran Immigration Law, and
to the good people who are fighting for
its repeal.

THE JEWISH PEOPLE 5' THE

WALTER-McCARRAN LAW

IN RECENT DAYS the opposition of the Jewish com-
munity to the Walter-McCarran Law has deepened.
Opposition has moved beyond mere protest at the fascist

features of the law to an awareness that the political repres-
sions in the law are also a major threat to the Jewish people.

This awareness was inevitable; the very fate of a mi-
nority people is inseparably linked with progress in his-
tory. As the attacks on civil liberties deepened in recent
years, Jewish leaders began to see that the ﬁring of Jews
from government posts was not -conincidental. The vig-
ilance of the Jewish community was sharpened by the
parading of Benjamin Gitlow before the House Un-Amer-
ican Activities Committee to testify that the late Rabbi
Stephen Wise and Judah Magnes were Communist col-
laborators; and by the ﬁrings of Abraham Chasanow and
Wolf Ladejinsky.

For over three hundred years the Jewish people have
looked to America as an asylum of liberty.

THE FIRST TWENTY-THREE Jews reaching New Am-
sterdam, in ﬂight from the Inquisition in 1654, were un-
welcome to Governor Peter Stuyvesant, who said: “Giv-
ing them liberty, we cannot refuse Luthers and Papists.”
Stuyvesant’s words foreshadowed the unity of Luther-
ans, Papists, Jews and all other faiths against intolerance,
and to struggle for separation of church and state in the
Federal Constitution.

THE LARGE VOLUME of immigration from the 1880s
on, and the subsequent fanning of the myth of Anglo-

 

Saxon supremacy, leading to the racist "quota-system" in
the 1920 and 1924 immigration law, had a profound bear-
ing on the vast Jewish immigrant population. Anti-Semi-
tism blossomed forth not only in job discrimination and
social exclusion, but also in the form of literary, philo-
sophical and scientiﬁc propaganda, in Henry Ford's Dear-
horn Independent in the 1920's, and by the Coughlinites and
Bundists in the 30’s and early ’40’s; and is continued by
hate-groups today.

When President Truman’s Commission on Immigra-
tion & Naturalization recommended elimination of the
racist features of the Walter-McCarran Law, Dorothy
Thompson in her column stated:

"But can any nation rucceufully ahrorh indefinite num-
herr of person: of very different racial Jtoch and cultural
hachground? . . . Since immigration mutt be selective,
should not the relection conrider experience in regard to
national character and euge.nic.r.9 . . . Do we, or do we not,
with to remain predominantly a Christian country . . .
predominantly a white country?”

HERE RACISM’S ESSENTIAL fascist purpose is made
manifest. America is no longer a "nation of nations,”
of "immigrants all, American all.” It is to racists and fas-
cists a white Christian country.

Little wonder that the Jewish people are aroused, and
that they are pressing for a return to early principles of

hospitality to all peoples, and therefore seek repeal of the
Walter-McCarran Law.

THE LAW 6' THE MEXICAN-AMERlCA.NS

I N LOS ANGELES where over 450,000 Mexican people live and work, the harsh
effects of the McCarran-Walter Law have been gravely felt.

Although the Los Angeles Committee has defended many cases in one aspect or
another, the community has experienced through thousands of cases a shocking blow
in the break-up of families through individual deportation as well as in the mass round-
ups that we have witnessed. .

It would take an overwhelming amount of research to unearth the thousands of
instances of hardship and suffering caused by the bitter punishment of exile that the
McCarran-Walter Law is meting out. In this community it is not only the short-lived and
long-lived resident that is affected, but the native-born Mexican-American as Well.

A case in point is the now celebrated Bernardo Diaz case, that of a veteran who
was refused entry after a brief visit to Tijuana, on the grounds that he had lost his citizen-
ship rights when he was discharged dishonorably from the "Army. The case is still
pending.

This was one case, but what of the existing hundreds of others that are not before
the public eye?

If this attempt to denaturalize and deport native-born U.S. citizens is successful
in the Mexican community this will surely lay the groundwork for the “easy snatching
away’ of citizenship of any other national group, and the concept of 2nd class citizen-
ship is ﬁrmly established.

9

Hence our concern for the guarantee of full due process for the Mexican people
and for the best possible defense of the Mexican deportees.

THE EASTSIDE BRANCH (a Committee comprising the Mexican deportees and their
friends) extend their greetings to the many friends and supporters of the Los Angeles
Committee for Protection of Foreign Born at its 1956 Conference, and request the
continued support for the program of the Committee in its defense of the rights of
foreign born peoples and in its campaigns to REPEAL the anti-democratic McCarran-
Walter Law.

The following is a list of the 13 active Mexican cases the L.A. Committee is de-
fending:

BY THE NEEDLE TRADES COMMITTEE
FOR PROTECTION OF FOREIGN BORN

T IS OFTEN said: “Heroes are made not born.” What is it that makes us look up
to certain people with reverence and deep respect? The answer is rather simple.
There is a knock on the” door. A piece of paper is presented which says:
A; of zfbir nzonzent er/erytbing i; going to cbunge for you. You will be burcmezl, bound-
 etl, rnoleytetl, fired from your job, torn from your family, rent go 4 deportation
center, and to jail; you will be ilenuzfurczlizecl and ileporzfecl.
Ten needle trades workers of Los Angeles have heard that knock because tradition-
ally they are among the front-rank ﬁghters for a decent and democratic America.

:THE KNOCK on the door and the piece of paper meant a SHARP AND AWFUL

BLOW FOR THEM. The thing they believed in, sacrificed and fought for, they were
told, they must not believe in any longer. They must think as they are told, and act

= as they are told.

But in unison they shouted NO! This will never happen! We will raise money
and stay out on bail. We will go to the people and tell them what that knock means
for all America.

We will expose the Walter—McCarran Law and all other reactionary attacks—so
loudly, so consistently and wisely, that together with others we will wipe them off the
books of our land, and we will re-establish our adopted country as truly the ‘home
of the free."

The ten needle trade workers who labor and sweat in the shops like millions of

other citizens, did not bend on their knees, did not abandon their work and dreams
for a better life and a peaceful world.
WITH THE LA. Committee for Protection of Foreign Born, and together with many
others, they helped awaken the rest of the people to the threat that faced our land.
They grew taller and bolder in their fight for themselves and their country. They suffered
much, but they fought back even more.

THEY ARE THE HEROES WHO AROSE IN OUR MIDSTI

WE SALUTE THEM!

Courage is contagious.

They inspired the rest of us, and with pride they now say:
'1Ve are. on tbe brink of purbing tbe W/czlzfer-McCzzrrmz Law over to oblivion. You
neetlle ’ll/0’l":é€1’.l' will write tbe next cbczpter for American clernocrczcy.’

We of the Needle Trades Committee for Protection of Foreign Born know that
you will answer our call and join with us in the ﬁght to Repeal the fascist Walter-

. McCarran Law in 1956!

The Eostside Committee of Los Angeles, and
Their Activities on Behalf of the Foreign Born

WITH THE enactment of the Walter-McCarran Law a wave of persecution against
the foreign-born spread over the country. -

It was quite natural that the East Side of Los Angeles populated by a great number
of foreign-born Mexican, Jewish, Negro and other nationali-ties, did not escape this
terror. '

Fourteen old-time respected residents of the East Side, were arrested and held for
deportation. It was at that time that a group of devoted friends in the East Side got
together to help these 14 deportees.

Ever since this group, known as the East Side Committee for the Protection of the
Foreign Born, has been carrying on their work arranging meetings, concerts, and all
kinds of affairs to raise necessary funds for legal defense, and publishing literature about
the Walter-McCarran law. ‘

THE COMMITTEE cooperates with all groups and organizations to defend the rights

of all Americans of foreign birth regardless of race, color and creed.

The response of the East Side community to the efforts of our committee was very
good, as proven "by the successful meetings and affairs which we carried through, and
the East Side Committee takes this opportunity to thank all our friends for their gen-
erous contributions both of time and money, and thereby helping the overall activities
of the Los Angeles Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born.

WITHIN THE last year a new phase of the Walter-McCarran Law began to operate
—‘and that is the denaturalization of citizens. A number of citizens are being threat-
ened with revocation of their citizenship, and the East Side Community is represented
there too.

We of the East Side Committee realize the danger and therefore resolved to work
all the harder to see that this infamous Walter-McCarran Law be repealed.

WE GREET the delegates and many friends assembled at the 6th Annual Conference
in session Saturday, April 7, 1956, and extend our best wishes for a successful confer-
ence.

We hope that when we meet again next year, it will be to celebrate the repeal
of the vicious Walter-McCarran Law, and the end of the persecution of the Foreign Born.

KOREANS IN THE UNITED STATES

BEGINNING WITH the year 1903, Korean immigrants, mostly single men, set
their feet in the territory of Hawaii. During the ensuing decade the number of
Korean settlers increased to over 7,000.

Immediately after their arrival, they were engaged in toiling for the development
of pineapple and sugar industry in Hawaiian Islands. None of them could understand
the ‘boss’ or foreman’s language; nor did they understand the nature of industry. They
just followed the sign language of the employer from sunrise to sunset, under the fore-
man’s whip, receiving only sixty cents a day.

During years of back-breaking labor, some picked up the language, learned to
read and write, and came over to the mainland of United States with new hope and
curiosity. A large number of them was immediately absorbed in the trans-continental
railways construction in and around the Rocky Mountains area, the last stage of construc-
tion of Union Paciﬁc. After the completion of the railway, they settled mostly in Cali-
fornia; some working in orange and other fruit orchards and some engaging in their own
small scale truck gardens.

SOON AFTER news of Japanese annexation of Korea reached here, they organized
political parties with a single aim: to help restore a democratic and independent Korea.
They started publishing newspapers in Korean language both in Hawaii and'on the
mainland. Today they are more or less resisting Syngman Rhee’s government and are
critical of U.S. policy on Korea.

The most outstanding anti-Rhee group is the one publishing KOREAN INDE-
PENDENCE, a newspaper in English and Korean languages, started in 1943.

KOREAN INDEPENDENCE stands for a single, uniﬁed, democratic Korea with
planned economy. It further stands for the broad application of democratic principle
in industry here in the U.S. It preaches that U.S. security is not in the military bases
all over the world, but entirely in the economic security and political liberty of each
individual in the U.S., irrespective of racial origin, birthplace or ideological and relig-
ious faith.

Herein lies the incompatibility between the KOREAN INDEPENDENCE and
the U.S. policy. This is the reason why the staff and supporters of Korean Independence

are under deportation. With the experience gained during the ten years of “cold war”
the KOREAN INDEPENDENCE group faces the future with unshakable conﬁdence:

THE WALTER-MCCARRAN LAW — THE UN-AMERICAN LAW MUST
BE REPEALED!

DAVID HYUN’S CASE AWAITS
SUPREME COURT DECISION

A FTER SIX AND ONE HALF years of continuous
and persistent support in the defense of David Hyun
by friends, neighbors and professional colleagues, and with
the encouragement and guidance of the Los Angeles Com-
mittee which provides the basic defense, a number of na-
tionwide and international campaigns were successfully un-
dertaken.
The culmination of these campaigns was the Amici Curiae
Brief submitted to the Supreme Court of the United States
in February of this year on the issue of denial of due process.

The brief was ﬁled by Robert W. Kenny, Esquire, for-
mer Attorney General for California. Key signatories to the
brief are Bishop James C. Baker, retired, Methodist Church,
San Marino, California; Dr. J. Stuart Innerst, Minister, First
Friends Church, Pasadena, California; and Dr. George A.
Warner, retired, Former District Superintendent Methodist
Church, Altadena, California.

THE BRIEF STATES that the nearly 400 co-signers "are
Americans who believe that citizen and non-citizen alike
are entitled to the protection of the elemental concepts of
fair play . .  (page 1 of ‘Brief for Amici Curiae’), and
continues“;

"WE BELIEVE the simple requirements that all who reside
in this country be treated fairly is embodied in the command
of the Fifth Amendment, ‘No person . . . shall be deprived
of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.’

“It is our concern with basic fairness which prompts us
to petition for leave to file this brief. It is not true that we
are solely concerned with the welfare of David Hyun, but

26

 

rather that we feel that the manner in which he has been
deprived of due process must of necessity aﬂfect the public
welfare and interest.”

“WE ARE CONCERNED more for the millions of foreign
born residents in our country than David Hyun as an in-
dividual. If one individual can be deported without any
of the safeguards of a fair hearing, no non-citizen is safe
from arbitrary expulsion by the Immigration Service.

"IT IS EARNESTLY urged that David Hyun has been de-
prived of liberty, and perhaps life, without due process of
law. If the Constitution is to have meaning for non-citizens,
David Hyun may not be torn from his friends, his family and
all that he has known as an adult through a procedure so
lacking in respect for the most basic rights of man.”
AMONG THE nearly 400 co-signers of the Amici Curiae
brief petition, representing many professions throughout the
nation ,are:

Mr. Gregory Ain. architect; Mr. Robert E. Alexander,
architect; Mrs. Helen Marston Beardsley; Rabbi Ben-
jamin Ben Zion; Dr. A. M. Butler; Mr. Witter Bynner;

Bishop Ralph S. Cushman; Katherine Dodd, M.D.; Rabbi
Ephraim F. Einhorn; Prof. D. F. Fleming; Clemens 

France, Esq_.; Dr. Hans Freistadt, Ph.D.; Prof.  McV.
Hunt; Mr. Bruno Lasker; Prof. Kirtl-ey Mather; Rt. Rev.

Walter Mitchell; Dr. Linus Pauling; H. Randolph Pyle;
Bishop Charles S. Selecman; Dr. William Lindsay Young.

The Southern California American Civil Liberties
Union earlier had submitted an AMICI CURIAE Brief
also opposing the denial of due process of law.

 

 

Bill Esterman's Courage

Was Contagious, Devotion Boundless

By DON WHEELDIN

A WHILE BACK, Atty. William B. Esterman was pre-
' A sented with a "brief case by those he defended before
the House un-American Committee. It bore the legend:

“To William B. Esterman, whose courage is contagious,

from the men and women who fought the un-American

in 1953.” ‘

Today, at 51, Bill Esterman is dead. He died on March
5, 1956, following a heart seizure and stroke.

The contagion of Esterman’s courage spread to thousands
throughout this state who well remember his fearless advo-
cacy in behalf of working people generally, trade unions in
particular.

High on his preferred list for defense were Negroes and
Mexican-Americans, and the numberless victims of cold war
hysteria, hauled before Congressional and state withchhunt-
ing committee.

IN 1953 Esterman undertook the defense of Joseph White,
San Bernardino Negro aircraft worker who faced “rape"
charges.

Characteristic of his passion to protect his clients’ rights,
was the manner in which Esterman virtually closed his office
—at great personal expense—and moved to San Bernardino
for the long trial.

Although White was convicted, Esterman’s handling of

the case resulted in a complete overhauling of the system of
Jury selection in San Bernardino county.
THE ESTERMAN courage was to be seen and felt time and
again during his frequent clashes with the House un-Amer-
ican Committee, before a Witchhunting Los Angeles Board
of Education, and the state senate Un-American Committee
under Sen. Hugh Burns and his predecessor ex-Sen. Jack
Tenney.

Esterman refused to be bullied by Tenney's arbitrary rul-
ings. He firmly insisted the Committee members had no
right to draw publicly stated inferences because his clients
exercised constitutional right not to answer questions about
policies or religion.

“Throw him out,” Tenney shouted as two burly cops
grabbed Esterman, pinned his arms behind his back, and led
him out of the hearing room.

As Esterman was being taken out, he turned and warned
his clients not to answer any questions put by the Tenney
committee without prior -consultation. He said:

"My office will be in the corridor and I invite any in need
of legal counsel to consult with me there.”

ESTERMAN’S GREATEST TRIUMPH came in 1946 when,
in association with Atty. Frank Pestana, he won a smashing
victory in negotiating a strike settlement for more than 12,000
AFL workers in the motion picture industry.

A year earlier, Esterman held a secure position as a hear-
ing officer for the National Labor Relations Board.

When the strike broke out in February, 1945, Esterman
‘became impressed with the reasonableness of the demands for
wage increases by the workers from various crafts who formed
themselves into the Conference of Studio Unions. He elected
to join in their defense.

Finally, in 1946, after many assaults on the pickets marked

by brutality and mass arrests, Esterman and Pestana success-
fully negotiated a settlement that won a 25 cent minimum
hourly wage increase for all studio workers in nearly a dozen
crafts.
NEIGHBORS and friends recall the intense humanity and
desire to help others held by this man and his wife, Priscilla,
which led them into acceptance of social responsibilities
beyond the conﬁnes of his law practice.

Members of Esterman’s profession demonstrated their
pride in his leadership by electing him three times president
of the local chapter of the National Lawyers Guild. Later, he
was elevated to the national executive board.

An inveterate letter writer, he wrote to editors, radio and
television commentators, churchmen and government oﬂicials
on a range of subjects dealing with politics, religion, law
and history.

Introduction

N THE PAGES that follow we
relate brieﬂy some of the many
stories and facts illustrating the tor-
ment and loss of basic liberties which
the Walter-McCarran Immigration and
Nationality Law of 1952 has inﬂicted
onifourteen million foreign-born cit-
izens and non-citizen residents.

This infamous Law has been de-
nounced and its Repeal urged by more
organizations and individuals—relig-
ious, labor, civic, professional, nation-
ality, and many others——than any law
in our_'nation’s, history. Very few in-
dividuals and almost no organizations
of any repute, are on public record for
its retention as it stands.

The text that follows explains why
this Lawis condemned here and abroad
as "racist and discriminatory’ ’and "a
disgrace to a democratic country.” Our
purpose is to inform and rally all
Americans to protest against the cruel
abuses -which immigration officials, em-
ployees of the Department of Justice,
practise in the name of the American
people because of the harsh undemo-
cratic Provisions of the Law.

SENATOR LEHMAN is one of the
many members of Congress who are
opposed to this Law. In a recent pub-
lic speech he Once aga_in,.went on rec-
ord for‘Repeal '('a Senate Bill to this
effect bears his name), saying:

those already here.

We are part of that "aroused” citiz-
enry, very much concerned with achiev-
ing abolition of the national origins
quota system and the racist philosophy
that provides its basis. At the same
time we stress the domestic aspects
and effects of the Law, the abuse of
our traditional democratic principles
through imposition of “second-class”
citizenship and denaturalizations for
political reasons, the medieval punish-
ment of Exile imposed on non-citizens
through deportation, and many other
evils.

THE COMMITTEE through its Legal
Panel attorneys is currently defending
nearly one hundred active cases, either
in administrative hearings or in the
federal courts.

These involve nine persons who
many years after becoming citizens are
being subjected to denaturalization,
opening the way to possible deporta-
tion.

They include also dozens of depor-
tation cases, threatening men and wom-
en (mostly of advanced age) who after
four and ﬁve decades of life here,
face exile for life from their Amer-
ican-born families they have raised.

They involve also many persons who
though ordered deported are stateless
and no country will accept them, hence
they are humiliated with worse parole
and supervision conditions than are
the worst criminal offenders.

However, this is by no means a story
of merely passive suffering. It is a
modern saga of how the victims of the
Law, aided by relatives, friends and
fellow-workers, have banded together
as supporters of the Committee, ﬁght-
ing this persecution and seeking Re-
peal of the Law.

This is a story that goes far beyond
the confines of the foreign-born, to
their native-born descendants and
through them to all the people, rally-
ing support for this struggle to restore
democratic treatment for all.

IN THIS presidential election year,
coinciding as it does with the partial
relaxation of the cold war hysteria,
there is little doubt that civil liberties
and rights will be important election
issues.

We expect that a Program of Action
will result from this 1956 Conference
and will ‘be made effective immediate-
ly so as to produce the best possible
results between now and the adjourn-
ment of the 84th Congress in mid-
summer.

Our basic aim is replacement of the
present Law with a new, democratic
and humane immigration and nation-
ality code—NOU’/, IN 1956/

PETER OHAUNT

To Be American

T 0 BE AMERICAN is more than be-

ing an American. California citizens of
Hungarian descent and other friends of
the protection of Peter Chaunt’s citizenship
know this well. To them the case does not
merely concern the writer, teacher, tool-
maker, who joined his family in the Unit-
ed States in 1921, became a citizen in
1940 (while director of schools of Inter-
national Workers Order) and who now
faces a denaturalization trial. To them
Chaunt is an example of how to be an
American even before one becomes an
American citizen.

Perhaps more fortunately than others,
through childhood correspondence with
grandparents and other relatives in Amer-
ica, he was early indoctrinated with the
spirit of American democracy, the very
substance of the life and conduct of citizens
of our republic. He lived and performed
his immigrant years accordingly. With
thought and effort, he joined the great
domestic crusade to be a live part of our
thriving democracy.

The genius of American self-government
inspired him in meeting his cultural, labor,
moral and political obligations to the com-
munity and to our country as a whole. Im-
provement not so much of his own lot as
that of his fellow man, that strongest urge
of American way of life ﬁred his thoughts
in all his activities. To protest, to peti-
tion, to appeal to reason, to uphold the
blessings of our land for all to have and

behold, were the guiding American prin-
ciples throughout his years of apprentice-
ship for citizenship.

"I’ll feel proud to he your character wit-
ness in your application for citizenship—
wrote his mother in 1939,—not just be-
cause you are my son, hut hecause as I
followed your years of Odyssea I have seen
the making of a good American. As you
know I often reprimanded you for wor-
rying too much, perhaps, ahout the wel-
fare of others while neglecting your own,
hut even in so doing you acted more Amer-
ican than many others who are citizens hy
accident. I know the Good Lord gave
you happiness in your activities, and, after
all is said, what more compensation can
one ask for . . .

"I rememher, too, -the early signs of
this in you: the day when you came home
without your jacket, you were hut 12 or
13 then, and said that another hoy needed
it more; when you wished to he a fireman
and later a doctor to help those in distress
and in pain. Your other concerns, years
later, about unions. Negroes, sweat-shops,
jobless and others were much of the same
care for the happiness of all. Would a
mother’s heart he angry for this?”

Chaunt’s apprenticeship years as an Amer-
ican were well spent. To revoke his citizen-
ship would be as much as if to say: to be
a citizen you must be a conformist, not
American.

WHY THE WALTER-McCARRAN LAW MUST BE REPEALED:

Deportation Means Exile, A Medieval Punishment!

By HARRY CARLISLE

 

STOP PRESS! TWO NEW DEPORTATION ARRESTS!

On March 23, I956 JOSE GA‘STELUM was arrested. Mex-
ican-born, he has lived in the U.S. since l920. He has a native-
born wife and two children. He was released on bail of $1,000.

On March 26, I956, ETHEL SHAPIRO was arrested, also
on a deportation warrant. She was released the same day on
$2,000 bail. She came here from the Ukraine in I922, and is
well-known in garment industry and union circles.

DAVID HYUN'S petition to the U.S. Supreme Court on
March 26th was denied in a 4 to 4. split decision which in effect
sustains the lower courts and upholds the deportation order!

NDER THE LAW residents of

the United States who have lived
here for more than ﬁfty years, may be
‘banished because of their ideas and
for dozens of other reasons. Even nat-
ive-born citizens, especially in the
Mexican-American community, are in
danger of exclusion from the United
States.

Does this seem. possible in a demo-
cratic country? Certainly to fair-mind-
ed persons it is unreasonable, brutally
harsh, and violates our democratic tra-
ditions.

Yet such a fate confronts the hun-
dreds of foreign-born Americans, long
resident here, who are ﬁghting de-
portation in the very wintertime of
their lives; for the Law would exile
them for life, forcibly separating them
from their American descendants, in-
flicting unnecessary and cruel punish-
ment on innocent persons.

THE CASE of Werner and Emma
Grondahl illustrates this plight. Over
two years ago they celebrated their
ﬁftieth year of life in the United
States: ﬁfty hard-working, home-build-
ing, family-rearing years, sinking deep
roots into American life. This should
have been a most joyful occasion, but
it was overshadowed by impending

2

tragedy, for the Grondahls, husband
and wife, were writhing in a grim trap
sprung on them by the Department
of Justice through the immigration
services, whose agents acting as inves-
tigators, arresting oﬂicers, jailors, judge
and jury, were processing deportation
proceedings.

Why? Because this ﬁne, aged cou-
ple had devoted their entire adult lives
to honest labor and to public welfare
in the United States, and now, as po-
litical dissidents, face the grim pros-
pect of being banished for life to sep-
arate countries, Werner to Sweden and
Emma to Finland, where they were
respectively born 70 and 67 years ago.

This case can be duplicated several
hundred times, in terms of general
harshness, throughout the country. In
Los Angeles alone, the Committee has
during six years had on its roster of
defense some 130 cases, embracing 18
different national minorities. The vast
majority of these cases involve the
civil liberties now virtually abolished
for 14 million foreign-born citizens
and non-citizens by the Law.

MOST OF the victims are still in the
United States and ﬁghting, thanks to
the Committee, despite the emotional

and economic strain of prolonged ad-
ministrative and federal court proceed-
ings; although there have been deporta-
tions——with tragic results for the vic-
tim and for relatives who suffer in
every way from the enforced exile of
bread-winners.

Some have died, their hearts giving
way under the terrible strain. A few
suffering illness and acute disturbance,
have departed voluntarily, leaving be-
hind them families with whom they
hope some day to be re-united, either
by these native Americans surrender-
ing their United States heritage and
exiling themselves, or by the exiles be-
ing able to return here in a better day,
when the Walter-McCarran Law no
longer torments and punishes foreign-
born Americans.

BESIDES THE large number of Mex-
ican workers expelled across the bor-
der each year without due process of
law, when the seasonal crops are har-
vested (expelled in an “operation”
of a semi-secret, semi-military mass
deportation program whose worst feat-
ures are concealed from the public
gaze——see "Due Process” article in this
Journal); there are many thousands
of deportations for technical, criminal,
and moral reasons, many of them quite

trivial. They .were enormously in-
creased by passage of the Law in 1952.

But those who suffer the most and
are outrageously treated are the so-
called political deportees, whose long
residence and deep roots in the United
States makes of deportation actual ban-
ishment or EXILE, the cruelest of pun-
ishments.

IT IS a.crying shame that in depor-
tation matters, the Law provides no
statute of limitations such as apply in
ordinary criminal matters.

How long must a person reside here
and raise native-born children, as well
as take from and contribute to Amer-
ican life with labor and social living,
before t/ae cruelty of EXILE .r/aall be
pro/aibited? It is after three years of
residence in a country like Belgium,
for instance, or those more civilized
countries -where marriage to a citizen
spouse or indication of a wish to live
in the land of adoption, prohibits de-
portation (although of course, a non-
citizen committing a crime is punished
in the same way as a citizen).

The bitter truth is that in the Unit-
ed States EXILE is practised wit/oouzt
execution of a crime, but merely for
exercising the right to freedom of
thought and speech.

Consider the following examples of
what this signiﬁes:

Thomas Dutton, who came here
from England as an infant and is un-
able to recall his arrival, worked for
45 years in Detroit industries. Now
nearly 70 years old and retired on a
small pension, he was recently ordered
to surrender with 40 pounds of lug-
gage for airborne travel, to be deport-
ed to England. His American-born
wife, similarly aged, was to be left
behind. It was akin to a death sent-
ence at his age.

"How much of my nearly 70 years
of life in America can I carry in 40
pounds of luggage?” he tremulously
asked reporters at the airport.

It ii 4 pertinent, t/oougbt-peat/oéing
queiztion.’ 4-’

The tfade unions which he had
helped to build came to his defense,
and just before he boarded the plane
an attorney produced a court order

restraining the immigration service’

from deporting Mr. Dutton. He is still
here, free on bond and through his de-
fense committee ﬁightingfor cancel-
lation of the deportation order.

 

IN OTHER RESPECTS, deportation
provisions of the Law inﬂict punish-
ment indeed, though it has been ruled
many times as "not being punishment,”
by the U. S. Supreme Court.

In the case of Knut Heikkenin,
writer for a foreign-language news-
paper he was twice tried in Federal
Court for "failure to deport himself"
after a deportation order was issued
against him. On the first occasion he
was sentenced on two counts, to a
total of 20_years imprisonment. This
savage punitive sentence was nulliﬁed
by a court of appeals, and he was re-
tried, whereupon the sentence has
been reduced to 10 year: in jail.’ (sic!)

Here too a defense committee as-
sumes ‘the burden of further appeal,
expensive as it is, for all similar de-
portees throughout the country have
an interest in the ﬁnal test that will
be made of the constitutionality of the
Law’s "self-deportation” provisions_

This is true for example of the two
dozen or so deportees in Los Angeles
Who are awaiting or undergoing de-
portation proceedings, which are con-
ducted by immigration ofﬁcials w'1o
are quick-change performers and play
many roles, and by the aid of "witness-
es who as government employed stool-
pigeons and informers are very ac-
commodating, making the issuance of
deportation orders a foregone conclu-
sion.

_ Many of these deportees are Mex-
ican-Americans who have lived and
worked in the U. S .for many decades
and have native-born families.

The case of Jose Ocon has been
fought through every administrative
and federal court process and recently
it was argued before the Ninth Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals, which is be-
ing asked to review the evidence in
his case on grounds of denial of due
process of law and unconstitutionality
of the basis on which deportation was
ordered. Jose Ocon has lived here
since 1919. He is ill, and deportation
in his case is tantamount to a death
sentence.

THE CASE OF David Hyun is world
famous. For six years a many sided
battle has been waged by the Commit-
tee, and by his own Friends and Neigh-
bors defense committee and a group
of his fellow architects; ﬁrst of all to
free him on bail when it was denied
and he was detained on Terminal Isl-
and in 1950, and then to prevent him

 

Werner and Emma Gvrondahl

being deported after a hearing in which
he was denied the elementary right to
confront the witnesses against him.

The fact that depositions were tak-
en from government witnesses in Ha-
waii, while David Hyun was a pris-
oner on Terminal Island, is the basis
for an appeal to the U. S. Supreme
Court, argued by Attorney William
Murrish a few weeks ago and now
awaiting decision.

(A 4 to 4 decision, March 26, 1956
upholds the deportation order! )

In addition, David Hyun was saved
from deportation to South Korea by
determined public protest action, and
a special hearing was won to determ-
ine if he would be subject to physical
punishment there. Voluminous evi-
dence, and a large number of protests
from professional persons nationwide,
brought a temporary stay of deporta-
tion to South Korea by order of the
Attorney General.

However, the immigration service
never rests, insofar as constant attempts
to inflict punishment is concerned, for
it unwillingly granted special hearings
to John Juhn and Diamond Kimm,
both Korean-born, in which evidence
as to the danger of physical persecu-
tion, similar to that in the David
Hyun case, has been presented. The
outcome is pending.

Similar proceedings are under way
to stop deportation of Petros Lezos to
Greece.

Yes, ‘besides the cruelty of EXILE
itself, the law provides many sharp
teeth for many different reasons, to
facilitate the program followed by the

NATURALIZED cmzms — NON-CITIZENS —— KNOW YOUR RIGHTS I

AGENTS OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE ARE
using all kinds of tricks and threats to deprive non-citizens, naturalized citizens and even
native.-born citizens of their rights. ’

Americans of foreign birth should be aware of their rights under the laws of the
4 , ‘United States. Only in this way can unscrupulous agents be prevented from trapping in-
' nocent people into violation of their legal and constitutional rights. Only by exercising
our freedoms can we preserve them, and defeat those who are systematically undermin-
ing and seeking to destroy the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution. '

It has long been a principle of democratic rights that all residents of the United
States, whether native-born or not, are protected by the Constitution. A

Naturalized American citizens have the same rights as native-born American citizens.
They need not answer any questions put to them by anyone, including government oili-
cials, until they have had an opportunity to consult with an attorney or organization.

Non-citizens also have the right to consult an attorney or organization before an-
swering any questions put to them by anyone, including agents of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service or the F. B. I. ’

Immigration oflicers placing a person under arrest should be asked to produce a
warrant of arrest. If there is no warrant of arrest, consult an attorney before answering
any question or accompanying the arresting officer.

A warrant of arrest is not a search warrrant. An oflicer making an arrest on a depor-
tation warrant has no right to search your home, or any private premises; for such a
search a special search warrant must be issued by the courts. Do not permit arresting
officers to take any books or documents or papers belonging to you. Unless you are shown
a speciﬁc warrant, insist that they refrain from any search orseizure, and telephone your
lawyer immediately. '

Anyonereceiving a letter requesting an appearance at Immigration Service oﬁices,
for any reason whatsoever, should immediately consult an attorney and follow his advice.

Anyone being served with a subpoena must accept it, but it is your right to make no
statement and to answer no question. See your attorney at once and follow his advice.
A subpoena is not an arrest warrant. Do not go with an officer serving a subpoena on
you. ~

Do not be intimidated. Do not believe any promises of preferred treatment or im-
munity if you make statements and answer questions. Do not be frightened if an officer
tells you that your silence will make matters bad for you. You have the absolute right to
silence, until you have been given t.he right to consult with your lawyer.

On request, the Los Angeles Committeeufor Protection of Foreign Born will provide,
through its panel of attorney, advice and assistance in matters of arrest, subpoena, re-'
quests to appear for interviews, and all matters of naturalization, citizenship status, de-
portation or harassment.

the
WALTER McCARRAN LAW

must be repealed!

President Truman’s Commission on Immigration
it Naturalization stated, in its official report:
The "Walter-McCarran” Law embod-
ies policies and principles that are un-
wise and injurious to the notion . . .

It applies discriminations against hu-
man beings on account of national
origin, race, creed and color . . .

it contains unnecessary and unreason-
able restrictions and penalties against
individuals . . .

H should be reconsidered and revised
from beginning to end!

 

 

VICTIMS OF DEPORTATION

CASES IN THE HEARINGS STAGE:

A. Anderson, Druscilla Anderson, Pedro Benitez, Mary Baumert, Maria
Cruz, Nina Firestone, Sonia Greenspoon, Ruby Hynes, Milo Jovetich, Sarah
Karson, John Kobler, Charles Kotanjan, Ana Martinez, Shuji Matsui, Esther
Mavros, J. Noreiga, Dora Polland, Morris Polland, Miriam Simons, Chaim
Schwartz, Angel Vasquez-Martinez, K. Yamashiro.

FIGHTING THE DANGER OF PHYSICAL PERSECUTION:

John Juhn and Diamond Kimm, faced with deportation to South Korea; and
are currently being given special hearings.
Petros Lezos, facing deportation to Greece.

David Hyun, whose deportation to South Korea was temporarily suspended
after a special administrative hearing, is now appealing to the U. S. Supreme
Court to reverse the lower court which upheld the deportation order, on
grounds of denial of due process of law.

CASES IN FEDERAL DISTRICT OR APPELLATE COURTS:

The case of Jose Ocon_ awaits decision by the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court.
Cases now being appealed to the Washington, D.C. Appellate Court are:
Frank Bonetti, Philip Cherner, Tomas Estrada-Salazar, Emma Grondahl,
Werner Grondahl, Alick Smith Hedge, Adolph Larsen, Domingo Martinez,
Jose Ramirez.

Now before the federal district court in Washington, D.C. for review of
evidence are the deportation cases of Justo Cruz, Harry Carlisle, Agapito
Gomez, Paul Kochi, Edo Mita, Emilio Lopez, Michael Ortiz, and Raoul Peyro.
Several of these have been denied r-e-opening before the Board of Immigra-
tion Appeals and will eventually be argued in federal court. The Carlisle

case was due to be argued as this was written.

Department of Justice and the Immi-
gration Service. This is to effect de-
portation of 12,000 non-citizens for
political reasons, as well as to denatur-
alize 10,000 citizens, as Attorney Gen-
eral Brownell boasted soon after he
took oﬂice. And, short of deportation
itself, to harass, punish, exhaust as
many victims of the Law as posisble.
This program is still being pushed.
IT IS TRUE that in the past year po-
litical deportation arrests have drop-
ped to almost zero. But denaturaliza-
tion cases are mounting, while many
deportation cases are in ﬁnal stages
in courts for review.

Reports to our office indicate that
immigration snoopers and ferrets are
still systematically combing foreign-
born communities, harassing potential
victims, seeking for a display of weak-
ness in the face of questioning that
would indicate fear and provide an
opening for subverting human de-
cency into the degeneration of inform-
ing on friends and fellow-workers.

These pushing, prying, cajoling
agents invade homes with their sly
attempts to incite self-entrapment.
Name a name, answer a question, and

4

they press for more, evermore. They
are under orders to ﬁnd more victims
for persecution under the Law by de-
portations or denaturalizations. They
are living testimony to the fact that
since the Immigration Service was re-
moved from control by the Labor De-
partment in 1940, and placed under
the control of the Department of Jus-
tice, it ha; been med 4.!‘ an instrument
of police control of t/aong/at — 4
political police weap0n—against the
foreign-born. The Law of 1952 was
specifically intended for this end.

The Firrt Amendment rights of free
speech and press have been eliminated
for the foreign-born. The labor, prog-
ressive, foreign-language press in par-
ticular has suffered heavily under the
Law.

Fifth and Sixth Amendment guar-
antees of due process are ignored in
deportation hearings, which are not
only facilitated by the Laws ex port
fczcto nature (that is, permitting pun-
ishment for beliefs held long ago, be-
liefs not then punishable), also by
the use of informers as witnesses on
such a basis that would not be per-
missible in a court of law.

 

The guarantee against "cruel and
unusual punishment” of the Eig/at/9
Amendment is wiped out by provi-
sions of the Law with regard to de-
nial of bail, and deportability for po-
litical beliefs or associations, without
regard to length of residence.

The “discretionary power” granted
to the Attoreny General is a blatant
violation of constitutional prohibition
of such individual powers being grant-
ed to any government oﬂicial. Yet he
has asked Congress to increase these,
in his recent proposals for amending
the Law.

Deportation, to put it bluntly, is
used to punish political dissenters who
by accident are of foreign birth. De-
portees, unless they are stateless per-
sons and cannot be deported for that
reason, are haunted throughout the
process of hearings by the knowledge
that the “deportable” deportee’s chances
of winning a permanent stay or can-
cellation of the order, is about two
per cent. '

In short, deportation proceedings
end in one of three possible ways:
EXILE from one’s family and friends
for life; supervisory-parole for life
under undigniﬁed, punishing circum-
stances; or death.

CURRENT INJUSTICE for the for-
eign-born, intensiﬁed by the cold W11‘,
is possible because our immigration
and naturalization policy is "a strange
intermingling of prejudice and logic,
of extravagant hopes and extravagant
fears.” (Edward Corsi, former Com-
missioner of Immigration, in a Free-
dom pamphlet; — "Paths to a New
World.’’)

It is well to remind ourselves, no
matter how many generations of nat-
ive-born forbears we may claim, that
as Franklin D. Roosevelt said in a
famous speech celebrating the gift of
the Statue of Liberty to the United
States, all but the original Indians are
immigrants or descendants of immi-
grants. We must also recall history's
axiom that the rights permitted or de-
nied to the foreign-born is an accurate
barometer of how the lawmakers are
sapping away the constitutional rights
of all Americans.

Thomas Jefferson stated this plain-
ly, when he condemned the Alien and
Sedition Laws of 1798, terming them
an attempt "to forge chains for the
people” and "a first experiment on
the American mind to see how far it

 

will bear an avowed violation of the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.”
And he described the lawmakers of the
day, and courts that sustained the de-
portation laws, as:
 . . subtle sappers and miners con-
stantly working underground . . .
. an irresponsible body . . . advancing
its noiseless steps like a thief over
the ﬁeld of jurisdiction.”

James Madison joined this con-
demnation, denouncing the Alien Law
as being "likely to establish a tyranny.”
Opposing the deportation of Irish and
French political dissenters in 1798,
he said:

 . . if a banishment of this sort be
not a punishment, and among the
severest punishments, it will be dif-
ﬁcult to imagine a doom to which
the name can be applied.”

History offers many such ﬁne com-
ments, which the most ethical of our
scholars, legislators, and jurists have
kept alive even through the most reac-

tionary interludes in our national life.

DURING OUR rapid industrial
growth and expansion of trade more
than a century ago, United States agents
went abroad to contract for immigrant
labor from any and all lands. In less
than 100 years some 50 millions had
come here to live and labor, building
cities and shipyards, harbors and rail-

But the vast majority left these

ON IMMIGRATION

 . . to aliens who have lived in the

United States for many years, who
have become integrated into the

their mother country may become
remote and purely technical, a de-
portation order becomes the most
severe and cruel penalty imagin-
able.”

the U. S. is over 30 years.

They were more often than not dis-
criminated against, hounded into ghet-
toes, persecuted by “Know Nothings”
like the K.K.K., the Southern Bour-
bons, and the McCarthys, McCarrans
and Walters of today. Abraham Lin-
coln in his debate with Douglas was
scornful of the "Know Nothings” then
active, pointing out that immigrants
made up more than half of our labor,
and were enriching our lives.

Our history with regard to immigra-
tion is quite special. Immigrants from
our earliest days were often driven here
for refuge from tyrants, or were snatch-
ed into slavery, or came with fine hopes
for liberty under the Constitution and
Bill of Rights. Many states passed laws
to encourage immigrant settlers, and
in some states even non-citizen im-
migrants held the right to vote in
elections.

On the other hand, they were de-
nounced as "radicals” because they took
literally the right to speak freely, and
even the right to organize unions and
political parties. However, it is notable
that from the time of the nulliﬁcation
of the Alien and SecZz'2fi0'n Law: in

_1800, to 1893, not a single foreign-

born resident was deported from the
United States for political reasons.

.- 1'  :-.»;r v,;;‘v,,-.. 5::-‘_» 3, -

 

IN 1893 the U. S. Supreme Court made
a decision in an "illegal entry” deporta-
tion case, Fang Yne Ting, which in-
volved deportability of a Chinese here
in spite of the Oriental Exclusion Law,
and declaring that a non-citizen in de-
portation proceedings is not entitled
to the protection of the Constitution,
on grounds that deportation, being a
"civil” and not a "criminal” proceed-
ing is not punishment. Since then,
deportation statutes have grown worse
with each crisis.

This decision has also been used
repeatedly, as a “precedent" justify-
ing “political" deportations. It was, be
it noted, a 5 to 4 decision, carrying
with it a famous dissenting opinion
by Justice Brewer, who quoted Thomas
Jefferson to the effect that our nation’s
founders, being wise as to the course
of history, "gave to this government
no inherent right to banish” anyone
from this country; for these enlight-
ened devotees of freedom had care-
fully weighed and debated each prin-
ciple that went into the Constitution
and Bill of Rights.

IN 1944 Justice Murphy, in a Su-
preme Court decision in the case of
Bridge; 1/. Wixon, in effect commented
on and disagreed with the Court’s
repeated denial of constitutional rights
to non—citizens in deportation matters.
He said:

"But once an alien lawfully enters
and resides in this country he be-
comes invested with the rights guar-
anteed by the Constitution to all
people within our borders. Such
rights include those protected by the
First and Fifth Amendments and by
the due process clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment.”

Yet today, because of the existence
of the Walter-McCarran law, a mon-

5

-a.»-- van:

 

 

    

strous by-product of cold war hysteria,
victims of the Justice Department’s
deportation terror are denied the ele-
mentary rights referred to by Justice
Murphy. Furthermore, they are sub-
jected to a most uncivilized practise-
deportation despite decades of life here
and the rearing of native-born fami-
lies.

This practise, which is far removed
from the expulsion for law violation of
someone recently arrived, was aptly
characterized by a famous jurist, Judge
Learned Hand, in a deportation case
some years back. He wrote in part:

 . . deportation under the circum-
stances (residence in the United
States since childhood) would be de-
plorable.
"Whether the relator came here in
arms or at the age of ten he is as
much our product as though his
mother had borne him on American
soil.
"He knows no‘ other language, no
other habits, than ours. He will be
as much a stranger in another land
as anyone born of ancestors who
immigrated here in the seventeenth
century.

,"Hou/ever /aeinonr bi: crinzer, de-

 

pomztio-n is to /aim EXILE, d dread-
ful pnnir/anzent abandoned by tbe
common content of civilized peo-

pier.”

Is’ it not high time that this “un-
civilized” practice of EXILE, the law
that makes it possible, and the "prece-
dent” with which the U. S. Supreme
Court “justiﬁes” and “legally” upholds
the theft of constitutional rights from
the foreign-born, are abolished?

It is true that there is always dis-
sent in the Court on these matters,
even expressions of regret that the
"precedent” exists to clutter up the
slate. Justice Frankfurter said so in the
1954 Galvan decision, which repeated
the old "precedent” and once again
denied constitutional rights and per-
mitted deportation of a long-resident
non—citizen with an American born
family. Yet only one week before the
Galvan decision was made, the Court
reversed a much older “precedent”
which had for some ninety years le-
galized barriers to integrated schooling
for Negro and white pupils.

Certainly a thoughtful analysis of
the effects of deportation today, in
numerous political cases at least, in-
volving a vast preponderance of long-

resident heads of families, makes it
plain that rociologically such depor-
tees as those whose cases have been
cited here-rbonld not be deportable
forany reason, because the deep roots
they have sunk through long life, mar-
riage, and the raising of families here,
give them human rights that should
carry with them the full protection of
the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

WHILE CAMPAIGNING for repeal
or Drastic Revision of the Law, we
intend also cooperating with other for-
eign-born defense committees through-
out the nation in preparation of a so-
ciological "Brandeis”-type brief, set-
ting forth the full scope of “dreadful”
punishment inﬂicted through political
deportations today on innocent Amer-
icans unrestrained by a rmtnte of limi-
tationr. Ultimately we hope to present
such a brief, carefully prepared with
statistical evidence and the full scope
of the tragic effect on families that
is involved, to the U. S. Supreme Court.

It will state the truth that deporta-
tion means EXILE, a “cruel and un-
usual punishment” that violates the
Eighth Amendment of the Bill of
Rights, and is unworthy of a civilized
nation.

Denial of Due Process to Mexican-Americans

PPRESSION OF Mexican-Amer-
icans was not introduced by the
Walter-McCarran Law. It appeared al-
most as soon as the ink on the Treaty
of Guadalupe-Hidalgo was dry. The
provisions of that treaty guaranteeing
the inhabitants of the huge territory
torn from Mexico by conquest were
ignored and those inhabitants treated
as a conquered people.

Constituting the basic labor force
of the Southwest, the Mexican people
have had to ﬁght throughout the years
against "being made economic, political
and social outcasts. They have been
allowed to come into the United States
when their labor—always, the hardest,
dirtiest and lowest paid—was needed.
They have been ruthlessly thrown out
when it was not.

In 1918 the U.S. bureau of Immi-
gration deported all Mexican copper
miners who were participating in a

6

By ART DMYTRYK

strike, breaking their union and re-
tarding union organization in the
Southwest for more than twenty years.

In the early thirties, half of the
million Mexicans who had been ab-
sorbed during the more prosperous
twenties were starved into returning
to Mexico by being thrown off relief.

During the second World War, they
were again induced to come to the
United States in great numbers to re-
place other workers who went into the
armed forces and the more highly paid
war industries.

Once the war was over, they again
became a "problem,” a problem the
government proposes to solve by sup-
pression of their rights under the Con-
stitution.

THE WALTER-MCCARRAN LAW
has given a tremendous impetus to this
suppression. With virtually unlimited
discretionary power, with modern tech-

 

niques and machinery and—since the
appointment of a military man, Gen-
eral Joseph M. Swing to the post of
Commissioner of Immigration——with
military tactics, the government in-
augurated an unprecedented campaign
of terror against the Mexican-Amer-
ican population.

An expression of this attitude of
discrimination is seen in a release in
the Los Angeles Metropolitan press
of February 3, 1956, that states: "a
canine corps of blood-thirsty hounds
has been secretly proposed for the
Mexican Border Patrol," by Commis-
sioner Swing.

Is this an extension of the “good-
neighbor” policy that the State Depart-
ment professes?

The human indignities to which
the Mexican workers have been sub-
jected are legion in this past period
of living under the Walter-McCarran
Law, and the above proposal only com-
pounds the inhuman treatment they
have received.

No one in the Mexican-Commu-
nity——citizen or non-citizen, native
born or foreign born—is safe from the

 

 

inherent threat of the Walter-McCar-
ran Law. The homes have been ‘broken
into in the dead of night. Stores and
factories have been invaded and cus-
tomers and employees dragged away.
Street cars and busses have been stop-
ped and their riders questioned. Planes
have swooped low over ﬁelds to spot
workers who have been picked up
later by U.S. deputies.

Hundreds of thousands have been
picked up and herded over the border
without warrants, without hearings,
without even the opportunity to get in
touch with their attorneys. Attorneys
called by frantic relatives have been
told that their clients were across the
border.

FOR A TIME the terror was accom-
panied by a blatant publicity cam-
paign, beginning with Attorney Gen-
eral Brownell’s announcement of .“The
Government’s biggest offensive against
Mexican ‘illegals’ in history.” Public
protest caused the Government to real-
ize its mistake, and soon the publicity
ceased.

But if the Government no longer
boasts of its terror campaign against
the Mexican-American community, it
continues to wage it nevertheless. It
has even increased its efficiency. Last
year an airlift to exile was begun. More
than 15,000 people were ﬂown by
plane to Brownesville, Texas, from
where they were shipped by boat to
Mexican ports.

While the total ﬁgure for those de-
ported is not available, it is known
that in ﬁve Southwestern Federal Court
Districts, there were 9,921 cases involv-
ing the deportation of Mexican-Amer-
icans. Since only an inﬁnitesmal num-
ber of deportations to Mexico reach
even the stage of administrative hear-
ings, the conclusion is obvious that the
number runs into the hundred thous-
ands.

THE OFFICIAL REASON given by
government ofﬁcials for the terror
against the Mexican community is that
"illegals” must be caught and expelled.
Nothing is said of the practice by
agents of growers of encouraging
Mexican workers to enter the country
illegally in order to depress wages and
impose sub-human working conditions.
The threat of mass deportation is used
to perpetuate these conditions. \When

the harvest is over the deportation
drive begins. Many are deported be-
fore they can collect the wages due
them.

That Mexican workers, through no
fault of their own, are used to lower
the standards of all American workers
is widely recognized by-trade unions.
The Fair Employment Practices Corn-
mittee of Chrysler local 230, UAW,
CIO, puts it this way:

"Enemies of labor always take ad-
vantage of labor disunify for their
own ends. Let's gain a new friend
by defending our Mexican brothers’
right to a decent life."

The Committee urges all unions to
make this demand:

"That Mexican labor be covered by
laws guaranteeing equal wages and
conditions with U.S. workers; giving
them the right to organize info union,
and doing away with the deporta-
tion terror."

Giving the lie to its own conten-
tion that the terror against Mexican-
Americans is directed solely against
“illegals,” the Government has begun
a deliberately calculated attack on nat-
ive born Americans of Mexican des-
cent.

Early last year Bernardo Diaz, who
was born here, was stopped at the bor-
der after a ‘brief visit to Tijuana, and
denied re-entry into this country. He
was forced to remain in Tijuana for

almost a year, while his wife and ﬁve
children, deprived of his support, faced
starvation on this side of the border.

Since then many cases, both of ex-
clusion and of deportation of native
born citizens of Mexican descent, have
come to light. Many technicalities are
advanced by the Government in justi-
ﬁcation of its actions against native
born citizens, but in several cases it
has simply refused to recognize birth
certiﬁcates as proof that their holders
were born in this country. Such ref-
usal, if it is allowed to become a pre-
cedent, will put the Justice Depart-
ment in a position to challenge the
citizenship of any American it chooses
to attack.

SELF INTEREST, as well as common
decency,‘ should command support
among all sections of the population
for the following point in the Los An-
geles Committee's minimum program
for revision of the \Walter—McCarran
I.aw:

Full due process of law for all
Mexican people regardless of
status, in order to abolish the
flagrant discrimination and ab-
use suffered by Mexican-Amer-
ican citizens, long-time resi-
dents, non-citizens, and Mexican
nationals who come here to work
and are subjected to summary
mass deportation under the ex-
isting immigration law.
