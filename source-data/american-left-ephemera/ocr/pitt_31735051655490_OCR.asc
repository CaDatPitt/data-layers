Refusal to Grant Needed Increase Will Cripple Important Library Services

Although newspaper headlines ‘reiterate that "Congress is economyaminded," there

appears

to be some basis for believing that our elected representatives across

the street will prefer to make democracy work by retaining and extending essen~
tial governmental services. .rather than driving our economy more and more toward
a militaristic basis with enormous appropriations for arms and munitions.

The position of the Library of Congress
that by refusing to grant a needed increase

sentially the same, namely,

in'this alleged "economy" drive is es~
in

funds, "the Library will continue to be handicapped in serving both the Congress

and the nation,

while LC ‘employees will continue

to enjoy the dubious distinc-

tion of being the lowestspaid group of government workers.

LC SQUAD STILL LEADS THE LEAGUE

Continuing its march toward a success-
ful defense of its championship, the
powerful LC basketball team has-an im~
pressive record of seven straight league
victories.

In a close, hardafought game, the Liw
brary team defeated Rural Electrifican
tion Administration in the last game be-
fore the Christmas holidays.’ I

On New Year's Day LC was invited to
play the formidable YMCA team at the an»
nual open house at the Y. Playing, a
fast, aggressive game, the team extended
the Y quintet to the utmost before their
reserve strength prevailed. The final
score of the game was 30~26.

Resuming league play after the holiday
interim, the team had little trouble de~
feating the Bureau of Foreign and Domes~
tic Commerce 86~l3. '

.In the most exciting game of the sear
son to date, the LC basketeers defeated
Patent Office 33~32. The contest was the
kind you read about, the lead changing
hands numerous times before LC team—work
prevailed.

January 18 the team had little diffi~
culty in downing Interstate Commerce
Commission 34a24.

Yeoman work has been done in all game
by the entire squad. Special credit
goes to John Eaton, Jim Cooper, Brooks,

oxo Lnoxsumvn PROGRAM son .1941) A

Declaring that the American rroties   
Number One remains the nine to ten mil~l '
lion gemployable men and women who'are,

without Jobs in private industry, the
Congress of Industrial Organizations has
launched its 1940 legislative program
with, the opening of the present session
of Congress.‘ i ' " ,

Briefly, ‘the CIO urges for serious
consideration’ a’ program based on the
following fundamental objectives:

(1) The United States must keep. out
of any involvement in foreign wars.
.(2) The attention of this country
and the energies of our government,

industry and labor must be directed ’

toward the immediate solving of the,
problem of unemployment. -
”(3) "The democratic rights and insti-
tutions of this country must be prea
.served. ”,V
(4) Labor's 'right,to organize ' and,
,bergain collectively must be continued‘
as ‘the ‘cornerstone for theipreservae
tion and extension of any economic and.
social program. V ;
.In urging‘ its program of jobs, se~
curity and peace, the CIO made clear
that Congress must devote its attention
to the interests and needs of the Ameriw
can people at home, rather than allow
foreign ‘affairs to divert its attention
from these pressing domestic problems.«
To meet such conditions, the expan~
sion of the‘ progrm of legislation for
social security and the relief of unar-
ployment as well as the continued assur~
ance of labor's right toorganize, are
recommendations carefully outlined ‘in
the 010's program. i’ ' ' V
