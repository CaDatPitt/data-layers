than it now does, but with this lesser amount create more
jobs. -

There is, of course, also the fact that the money saved
from the military could provide many things our people
urgently need—better education, adequate health care, ad-
ditional housing and hospitals, the building-up of the mass
transit necessary to meet the energy crisis, etc.

Our country cannot afford the military budget we have
been saddled with, much less the increased military ex-
penditures the Democratic and Republican politicians are
now projecting for the future. Failure to slash these expen-
ditures will make it impossible to break out of the high
inﬂation-high unemployment trap.

Even worse—it will guarantee a major economic explo-

sion. Sooner or later, the inﬂation will burst through the 18
percent mark, already reached into levels like 30, 40, 50
percent, or more, such as Israel, Turkey, and many Latin
American countries have to contend with. Sooner or later,
the government’s attempt to contain the inﬂation through
economic slowdown and enemployment, will trigger a
major depression.
' Our two major parties have gotten us into this mess. No
one from these parties—whether posing as independent or
not—can point to a way out. Only independent political
action by the people can force a change in our country's
priorities and enable us to work our way out. The time is
now ripe for such action.

THE TRAP AND HOW WE GOT IN IT

For ten years our economy has been suffering from a
combination of high inﬂation and high unemployment
occurring simultaneously. In “good” times, the unem-
ployment has gone down a little while the inﬂation has
ﬂared up. During recessions, the inﬂation has abated a
little while the unemployment has soared. But from one
cycle to the next, both problems have been getting worse.
This year, with an explosion of the inﬂation to an annual
rate of 18 percent during the first quarter, and with a record
increase in unemployment in the months that followed, the
process has moved to a new high level.

Three administrations——Nixon’s, Ford’s, and Carter’s——
have tried to deal with the problem. Each showed itself to
be bankrupt.

Edward Boorstein was born in New York City and received an MA in
economics from Columbia University. His earliest jobs as an economist
were with the Federal Reserve and War Production Board in Washing-
ton. He was an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Trade of Cuba during
the early years of the revolution, and Assistant to President Allende’s
Economic Advisor during the Popular Unity government in Chile. Mr.
Boorstein has written two books, the latest being, Allende’s Chile, An
Inside View (International Publishers). Mr. Boorstein now works for the
Communist Party, USA and is a frequent contributor to the Daily World
and Political Affairs.

clouds of rhetoric about our economy. But none gave a
simple, clear, and credible explanation of how we got into
the pickle we‘re in and how we can get out.

We must get out—and as soon as possible. Inflation and
unemployment are inflicting great suffering on our
people—on all workers, male and female, especially on
Afro-Americans, Spanish-speaking and other racially and
nationally oppressed minorities, on youth and the elderly,

and‘ on millions of others. In addition, if we don’t get out, 4

the problem will keep getting worse and worse, and we
will be facing a festering crisis for years ahead.

We have to make our government take meaningful action
to break out of the inﬂation-unemployment trap. This
means action to eliminate both inflation and unemploy-
ment. We have a right to demand that we be freed of both
evils. Our governments have been telling us that we can’t
fight both evils simultaneously—that it has to be one orthe
other. But why should we take seriously what the govern-
ment says? It hasn’t been able to fight either evil effectively.

The government is wrong. Not only can both evils be
fought simultaneously—they have to be, if either is to be
fought effectively. To see why this is so, we have to under-
stand what lies behind the mess we’re in, what is the main
cause of inflation, what is the relation between inflation
and recession and unemployment.

INFLATION: ITS MAIN CAUSE

The monopoly-dominated government and media make
great efforts to steer us away from the main cause of our
inflation—-the enormous military expenditures.

What is the basis for saying that military expenditures
are the main cause of inﬂation? It is the facts of history. Ask
yourself at what times in American history inflations have

gotten started. All the major inﬂations have gotten started
in times of war—the Civil War, World War I. World War 11.

1

the Korean War, the Vietnam War. The tidal wave of inﬂa-
tion from which we are now suffering got under way dur-
ing the Vietnam War.

It might be asked why the inﬂations started by World
War II and the Korean War subsided after these wars ended,
while the one started by the Vietnam War is still with us.
The answer lies in what happened to military expenditures
after these wars ended._ After World War II, military expen-
ditures were slashed by 88 percent. After the Korean War,
they went down by 21 percent. But after the Vietnam War,
they not only did not go down—they went up by 30 percent
in three years and they are still rising sharply.

How do military expenditures cause inﬂation?

By causing deficits in the federal budget which are cov-
ered by printed money. The federal government borrows
the money to cover the deficit from the banks. The banks
don’t have this kind of money lying around loose so they in
turn have to borrow—and do so from the Federal Reserve
Banks.

Where does the Federal Reserve System get the money’?
It prints it. And the injection of printed money into the
economy swells the money supply, causing the phenome-
mon known as “too many dollars chasing too few goods”
which results in inflation

The idea spread by the government and media that wage
increases are responsible for inflation is a myth. If wage
increases cause inﬂation, how is it that they didn’t do so in
the periods 1948-1950 and 1953-1965 when there were no
wars? How is it that inﬂations have arisen only during
periods of heavy military expenditures?

It is true that wage increases tend to get bigger during
inﬂation. But this doesn’t prove anything. The military
expenditures start and feed an inﬂation, and then workers
have no choice except to fight for higher wage increases to
try to keep up with the relentlessly rising prices.

2

It isn't workers’ real wages that have been rising, but only
their nominal wages. They get more money, but this money
buys less. Last year the government’s wage guidelines
called for increases of 7-8 percent. The increase in prices
was over 13 percent. According to the Economic Report of
the President, real wages—wages adjusted for price
increases—dropped last year by over 4 percent. By April
this year, real wages were lower than they have been since
1962.

Workers are the class that is hardest hit by inflation. Not '

only does the real value of their wages go down, but the
inﬂation pushes them into ever higher tax brackets so that
they have to pay a higher and higher proportion of their
reduced real income in taxes. In addition, the inﬂation eats
away at the value of the pensions they pay for with many
years of work and sweat. To blame workers’ wage increases
for inflation is to add insult to injury.

RECESSIONS MADE TO ORDER

Capitalism periodically produces recessions whether
the government wants them or not. Recessions ﬂow from
the nature of capitalism. But, in addition, the government
often deliberately induces a recession as its preferred
method of fighting inﬂation. The government figures that
recession helps against inﬂation because rising unem-
ployment reduces purchasing power and the demand for
goods and also makes employed workers more willing to
settle for wage increases that are much lower than the
inﬂation. It induces recession by hiking interest rates and
tightening credit, which cuts down the ﬂow of money for
housing, autos, etc.

Even if it could succeed, to deliberately induce a reces-
sion and rising unemployment is a heartless, monstrous
way of fighting inﬂation. But it has not succeeded. Instead
it has gotten us into a deeper and deeper mess.

Nixon used recession as a medicine against inflation in
1969-1970. The inﬂation was running at what then seemed
the unacceptably high rate of six percent. Unemployment
was less than four percent. Then with the recession, un-
employment jumped to over six percent. The inflation was
reduced a little, but far from eliminated, and with the
recovery that followed the recession, it too leaped upward.

When Ford’s turn came to tighten the credit screws, both
inﬂation and unemployment were much higher than when
Nixon did it. The inﬂation had reached twelve percent,
while unemployment was over five percent. The recession
that Ford initiated was the worst of the postwar period.
Unemployment shot up to over nine percent.

But even with this severe recession the inflation was far
from eliminated. It abated to six percent, and then with the
subsequent recovery again flared up.

The upward ratcheting of inflation and unemployment
continued under Carter. In the first quarter of this year, the
inflation surged to eighteen percent. At no point under
Carter did unemployment fall significantly below six per-
cent. T ‘

And here we are with still another deliberately induced
recession. The Carter administration started working to
slow down what it called the “overheated economy” back

 

in November 1978. But its measures were only half-

hearted, and although most economists predicted a reces-
sion in 1979, it did not come. Then the eighteen percent
inflation early this year caused panic in the administration.
In February and March, it decided to really lower the boom
on credit. It raised interest rates to unprecedented levels
and restricted the flow of credit in other ways. The eco-
nomy began to sink into a deep recession and unemploy-
ment began to shoot upward again.

Besides deliberately helping to bring on the recession
and rise in unemployment, the government followed a

4

policy of doing nothing about them. It wanted enough
recession and unemployment to make some dent on the
inﬂation—and making a dent would not be easy since the
inﬂation had become very strong.

Secretary of Treasury Miller announced the day the un-
employment figures for May came out: “We will not
flinch.” What he meant was that the rising unemployment
figures would not panic the government into changing its
policy-——it would keep pushing the recession and unem-
ployment as a weapon against the inflation.

But this policy won't work. The current recession will no
more eliminate the inflation than the earlier recessions
under Nixon and Ford did. The inflation will abate a little
and then ﬂare up again. Even the government recognizes
that its policy won't get rid of the inﬂation—it projects a
continuation of a high level of inﬂation for years ahead.

This situation is made all the worse by the government’s
decision to hike military expenditures over the next five
years to a level $100 million per year higher than they
already are. This means feeding the inﬂation with military
expenditures, while at the same time trying to control it
with recession and unemployment. This lunatic policy can
only lead to a deeper recession, still higher inﬂation, or
both—probably both.

A Experience of the last ten years shows clearly that the
government’s way of trying to solve the problem of inﬂa-
tion cannot do the job. The government can initiate an
economic downturn, but it can’t maintain the financial
screws tight enough. and long enough to get rid of the
inﬂation.

Long before the inﬂation is gone, people are compelled
to rebel about mounting unemployment and force a change
in policy. They did this in the last two recessions and will
do it again this time. There is no reason why they should
accept having the burden of fighting inﬂation placed on

5

 

  

their backs—and in such a terrible way.

The govemment’s policy is not only not getting us out of
the high inﬂation—high unemployment trap, it is getting
us stuck in it ever more deeply.

WHY THE BANKRUPTCY OF IDEAS?

Not only have three administrations—Democratic as
well as Republican—been unable to prevent our sinking
deeper into the trap, but the economists and politicians of
the two main parties can't even present an explanation of
how to get out of it. Because they represent the monopolies,
they are prevented from even understanding the problem,
much less being able to do anything about it.

The basic line of the two-party economists and politi-
cians is that fighting against inﬂation is incompatible with
fighting against unemployment and vice versa. We can,
they say, only fight against inﬂation by increasing unem-
ployment, and if we try to lower the rate of unemployment
this will only make the inﬂation worse. It is this theory that
lies behind Carter’s saying/that “inﬂation is the No. 1
enemy.” He told us this to try to get us to accept the high
unemployment to which his policies lead.

But even just as an idea, the method of fighting inﬂation
with unemployment cannot be followed through to a suc-
cessful, logical conclusion. To get rid—by this method—of
an inﬂation as strong as the one we are suffering from
would require a major, prolonged depression. Moreover, it
is far from certain that even a major depression would do
the job. Nobody from the two major parties has been able to
point to any way out of this dead end.

Some establishment politicians and economists have
taken to offering quack solutions to the problem, which
they dress up under the fancy name of “supply side eco-
nomics.” They recommend a big cut in the taxes paid by
the large corporations. This is supposed to provide an

6

 

  

incentive for higher investment and cause an increase in
productivity—which will solve the problem of inﬂation.

But what such a tax would do is increase profits, and if
high profits were the key to increased productivity, we
would be enjoying the most rapid rise in productivity in
our history. Besides, even a good rate of annual increase in
productivity might amount to three percent. How can a
productivity increase of this size stop an inﬂation running
at 10 to 20 percent?

The only way to fight inﬂation is to get at its root cause-
to slash the bloated military budget. Only in this way can
the inﬂation be effectively eliminated, not just temporarily
reduced. Only in this way can inﬂation and unemployment
be fought simultaneously.

THE DOLLARS-‘AND-CENTS WAY OUT

The reason slashing military expenditures is the way out
of the high inﬂation-high unemployment trap is that not
only are they the root cause of inﬂation, but they create
relatively few jobs. Dollar for dollar, military expenditures
create far fewer jobs than the same amount of money spent
for civilian purposes. Here are some figures from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics:

Every billion dollars spent on the military creates 76
thousand jobs.

Every billion dollars spent on education creates 187
thousand, on health care 139 thousand, on construction
100 thousand jobs. t

With a big slash in the military budget, part of the money
obtained could be saved, not spent, thus balancing the
federal budget and eliminating the root cause of inﬂation,
while the rest could be used to create many more jobs than
are now created by the military expenditures. In other
words,the federal government could spend less money
