Dear Friend :

I am twenty-four years old. I want to’ live. I ask you to help save
me from a lynch death, which is in store fcr me if I am sent back to Ale.-
bann. Monday, June 16, my trial is coming up for the last time before
Judge (hney at the Federal Court House, 9th and Market, 10 Add.

        
  
  
   
     
   
   
    
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
 

When I was eighteen years old I sharecropped on 9. small farm near
Tuscaloosa, Alabenn. The man I was share cropping for was named Terry. One
day when I asked him to fix his fence to keep his cows from trampling my
corn crop, he started clubbing me over the head with an axe handle. when
I was dazed from the blows on the head, I asked myself the question, “Why
should I stand up here and let this nan kill me. He has no right to kill
me»; I have no right to die." The only thing I had was a pen knife in my
pocket so I stuck him with it.

Terry organized a mob of Klu Kluxers to lynch me. I saw them in
time and escaped to Detroit. I have been up North for the past seven years.
My boss and fellow workers vouch for the fact that I am a. steady worker and
have been living a law--abiding cit have life.

But in Alabanr. a Colored mm is not supposed to defend himself
when attacked by 9. white man. Terry swore cut a warrant for my arrest
and the Government nm wants to send me back to Alabenn--that's Where
twenty-eight Negroes were murdered by police and sheriffs in the last two
years. I don't want to be the twenty-ninth to be murdered because I an
a Negro.

I lave comitted no crime. I ran away to escape a lynching. I
ask you--is it a. crime to flee from a lynching--to save your life?

You can help, but ya: must do it now. There are only two days
left. Wire Governor Gordon Per sons, Montgomery, Alabama, and ask him
't'6"2l'rep the warrant. Sunday, please ask those who can make it to attend
my trial Monday morning, 10 Adi. before Jadge Ganey at the Federal Court
House, 9th and Market.

Sincerely yours,

Fletcher Mills

lord whom he had requested to repair his fence to keep his cows from
trampling Mills cornt A lynch mob proceeded to organize against
Mills, who fled the state to save his life.

FOR SEVEN YEARS MILLS HAS BEEN FIGHTING THROUGH ALL THE STATE AND‘ ‘
FEDERAL COURTS TO KEEP FROM BEING EKTRADICTED AND RETURNED TO ALABAMA.

In the next few days he will be sent back, unless the District

of the injustice of the case against Mills and persuaded not to sign
his release order. ‘ A ‘
