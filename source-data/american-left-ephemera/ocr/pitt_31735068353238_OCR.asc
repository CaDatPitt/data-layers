Open Letter From Pres. Clark

.- United Steelworkers of America :

 --,tion, many local unions have.

A and of the entire_labor movement.

To USWA Pres. ,McDona1d

David J. McDonald, President

1500 Commonwealth Building A
Pittsburgh 22, Pa. 

Dear Brother McDonald:

I am writing to" you about a matter which is of the most serious con-
cern not only to your organization and mine but to the labor movement
as a whole. This has to do with the methods being employed by certain of
your staff people and supporters in trying to raid and undermine the
International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers.

As you know, we resent the efforts your organization has made since
1949 to raid Mine-Mill. We think raiding is a disgrace to the labor move-
ment, a disservice to the rank and file, and that it plays into the hands
of the employers and the enemies of labor.

Your own union has first-hand experience with this insidious practice
in your current strike against the Carrier Corp. in Syracuse, N. Y., where,
after more than a year on the picket line, you are being raided by the
Sheet Metal Workers.

We doubt that your membership approves the expenditure of the mil-
lions of dollars you have already wasted in your futile attempt to take
over the jurisdiction which Mine-Mill has had in the non-ferrous metals
industry for almost 70 years. '

Your time and money should be devoted to trying to solve the prob-
lem of unemployment and the other serious problems your members face

in the steel industry. Furthermore, many of your oldest members recall,‘

I am sure, that Mine-Mill was one of the unions which contributed sub-
stantial amounts of money to help your union get off the ground and to
organize the steel industry in the 1930’s. T ‘’

But I am writing you now about an especially serious aspect of the
attack by your organization on mine. This is the use of special financial
inducements which, we understand, some of your staff people and support-
ers have been holding out to Mine-Mill staff members, and to Mine-Mill
local union leaders and rank-and-file members, in order to seduce them
away from Mine-Mill to the United Steelworkers of" America.

These included the offer of salaries higher than your regular staff
members receive and extremely generous expense, mileage, and per diem
allowances. These offers amount to indirect bribes, especially since the
idea is that some of these payments need not be reported as income.

In fact, there is some evidence -that tends to show that your agents
and employees have made direct payments of cash and offers of such pay-
ments for the following purposes:

1) toget Mine-Mill staff members and local union leaders to leave
Mine-Mill for your union and to convince their friends and supporters in
Mine-Mill to do likewise; 

» — 2) to obtain, surreptitiously, Mine-Mill membership and mailing lists;

3) to influence Mine-Mill people to take certain actions within Mine-
Mill which would injure Mine-Mill and help your union.

There are even rumors——and some evidence to support them—that in
N.L.R.B. election campaigns involving our two’ organizations, your staff
members have bought and have offered to buy votes of the workers.

‘It is hard for me to believe that you do not recognize that such dis-
graceful methods are not only profoundly immoral but also that they are
a terrible danger to the labor movement as a whole. It is also hard for me
to believe that the AFL-CIO Ethical Practices Committee would condone
such methods. '

I doubt that anything I could say at this late date would convince

you to cease and desist from the raids you havebeen conducting against A.
iMine-Mill for the last 12 .years., All I can say in that regard is thatitlie  '

loyalty and devotion of the Mine-Mill membership will continue to be our
answer to you until your own membership compels you to stop wasting
their money and to devote yourself to the solution of their own difficult
problems.

But I do have some hope that you and your agents will realize before.

it is too late that the tactics I have referred to in this letter can only re-
sult in sapping the moral strength of the United Steelworkers of America
Fraternally,

_ JOHN CLARK, President

ning Goals

TUCSON, Ariz.——-Trade union democracy breathed

v_ _ .life in every word spoken and every action taken here
by some 250 delegates at Mine-Mill’s 56th convention

- O . D which set goals for the union’s work in the coming year.
’ A In five solid days of deliberations carried "on in the

‘traditional Mine-Mill way of conventions where every

‘ — . ' delegate has the right to express his views no matter how
’ - dissenting, the gathering took a thorough look at prob-

. _ ' 4 lems as they exist in the non-ferrous metals industry,

the nation and the World community, and adopted an all-
encompassing unit’ of programs for solving them.

The only break inthe hard-core work of the con-

May.- 1961 vention came on its last day, Good Friday afternoon,

when a special recess was
taken for the benefit of
those wishing to participate
in the Three-Hour Devotion in
the church of their choice.

It was a united convention
and a productive one, with all
issues fully debated in resolu-
tions brought to thefloor by
the various committees which

considered some 125 submit —

ted resolutions altogether.
An excellent tone of. mutual
respect for all views dominat-
ed the discussion which was
concerned from start to fin-
ish with the welfare of the
membership both as workers
and citizens, and with the fu-
ture stability and growth of
Mine-Mill.

STATED in a few w-o-rds,
the convention actions could
be summarized as having

‘launched an all-out attack ‘on

unemployment, both through
legislative action and at the
bargaining table, and as hav-
ing strongly reaffirmed the
union’s stand for world peace
and for civil rights and liber-
ties. These and other actions

are reported in separate‘

stories throughout this issue
of the paper.

Of main immediate concern
to the delegates was the con-

Formulated
On Industry

TUCSON, Ariz.—Special in-

‘dustry proposals to meet the

present crisis in non-ferrous
metals and promote the in-
dustry’s full recovery. were
formulated by the 56th conven-
tion as part of its comprehen-
sive legislative program for
halting the U. S. economic
slump.

The proposals, recommended
by the Executive Board and
adopted by the delegates, were
based on the union’s experi-
ence with existing programs
and reflected an awareness of
the suddenly acute crisis that
has arisen in all branches of
the industry in early 1961.

They were projected both
for the industry as a whole as
well as for the specific prob-
lems of copper, lead, zinc and

brass. _

For the whole industry, the -

convention proposed:
- Establishment of a United
Nations metals bank to ac-

. quire surplus refined metals
and use them in development

programs in underdeveloped
countries, a means of expand-
ing world-wide -utilization of
metals. '

0 International c o In m o d i t y

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

Buffalo Bafs 1000
On Pension Cases

A clean sweep on all cases
handled by Mine-Mill involving
disqualification of American
Brass pensioners for jobless
benefits has been scored by
Buffalo ABC Local 593.

The latest case reported to
the Mine-Mill Union was that
of Joe Sorce who was dis-
qualified, as were the others,
on the two counts of unavail-
ability for work and leaving
his job without good cause.
This one again, like some nine
others, was won on appeal by
the union before the referee
and the‘ N. Y. State Appeals
Board in New York City.

Sorce, who retired last
August, received a lump sum
back benefits check of $1,300,

. representing $50 weekly pay-

ments for 26 weeks. He got
the check March 25.
In a letter addressed to the
Mine-Mill Union, Sorce said:
“I want to congratulate the
union for the wonderful repre-
sentatives you have. I am re-
ferring to Int’l Rep. Joe Scioli
and Casey Adamczyk of Local

593, the way they represented‘

the union at my hearing for
unemployment. . . . I want to
thank the union and Mr. Scioli
and Mr. Adamczyk. The credit
of this victory goes to the
union. The way these fine gen-
tlemen handled my case was
amazing.” -

PD Locals Back

Per Cap lncrease

Four locals of the Phelps
Dodge Council sent delegates
to the Mine-Mill convention in
Tucson concurring in resolu-
tions which called for a 75—cent
per capita increase to the In-
ternational Union.

They included Locals 551
and 616 in Bisbee and Morenci,

Arizona, 700 in Los Angeles,
and 501 in El Paso, Texas.

The 75-cent per c a p it a

amendment resolution s u p -
ported by the locals also in-
cluded the «provision that 25
cents of the increase go into
the International Strike Fund,
as was approved by the con-
vention.

The increase to put the union
on a sound financial basis was
previously endorsed by the
delegates to the Arizona Mine-
Mill Council, which represents
all ten Mine-Mill locals in the
state.

Local 117 Wins in
UC Case Appeal

Anaconda, Mont., Mill &
Smeltermen’s Local 117 ap-
pealed a decision of the state
Unemployment Compensation
Commission when the Com-
mission denied jobless benefits
of a week to Mine-Mill member
Floyd Tidwell because he re-
ceived his 1960 vacation pay
upon being laid off by the
Anaconda company. The case
was won by the union.

J. Robe1'tlChilton, Chief of
Appeals, found for the union.
His decision said that the evi-

dence disclosed that the em-
ployer - employee relationship
between Tidwell and the com-
pany was terminated on the
date of layoff and that pay-
ment received by Tidwell for
his vacation was a fringe bene-
fit earned under the contract
for past services rendered
(earned in 1960) and cannot be
construed to cover any period
beyond the date of termination
of employment. Vacation pay-
ment,‘ he said, received by Tid-
well does not constitute a wage
in lieu of notice or a separa-
tion or termination allowance.

The case was handled for
the union by Local 117 Busi-

Butte and Anaconda Win
2 Important Arbitrations

The arbitrability clause, a so-called “non-economic” '

improvement won by the Montana Mine-Mill Joint Nego-
tiating Committee in the February 1960 strike settlement
with the Anaconda company, paid off cash-wise recently
in two important arbitration victories Won by Locals 1

and 117 in Butte and Ana-
conda.

Buffe

In Butte, the company at-
tempted to avoid payment of
overtime by requiring men re-
quested to work on Sunday to
take a day _off during their
regular work week.

The stipulated issue for arbi-
tration was: “Are the employ-
ees, who have been on a‘ 5-day
work schedule, seven days a.
week at the Kelley Mine since
Aug. 7, 1960, who are in the
following classifications, en-
titled to a sixth day work
schedule under the provisions
of Exhibit ‘B’, Par. 9, of the
Agreement of Feb. 15, 1960:
Slushermen, Swampers,
Spreadermen, Motormen,
Crushermen, Loaders.”

The arbitrator, u p h 01 d in g
Butte Miners Union No. 1,
ruled that the men who
worked in those classifications
on Sundays between Aug. 7
and Nov. '24, 1960, are entitled
to the‘ sixth day of work for
that period under the provi-
sions of the February 1960
agreement.

The award means about
$19,000 for about 40 miners.

This grievance arose when
the company eliminated the
lumber yard at the smelter
and changed lumber deliveries
to its own Interstate Lumber
company, using Inters ta te
truck drivers and taking away
jobs from the smeltermen.

The issues before ‘the arbi-

trator were: 1) Whether the
grievance is arbitrable under
the provisions of the collective
bargaining agreement; and 2)
If so, “should the Anaconda
Company truck drivers and
helpers who have delivered
lumber continue to do so to
the extent that they have done
in the past?”

Anaconda

The company claimed union
infringement on “manage-
ment’s rights,” said the issue
was not arbitrable and main-
tained it had the right to con-
tract out the work.

Contending the issue was ar-
bitrable under the contract, the
union maintained that it was
not a matter of contracting
out of work since Anaconda
controls Interstate, and argued
that the sole controversy was
Whether the lumber should be
delivered by employees who
are members of Local 117 or
by Interstate employees.

Arbitrator Thomas H.
Tongue ruled for ‘Anaconda
Mill & Smeltermen’s Local 117,
declaring the grievance was
arbitrable under the agree-
ment and that “Anaconda
truck drivers and helpers who
have delivered lumber should
continue to do so to the e:-zent
they have done in the past.”

This case was handled for
the union by Int’l Rep. Tom
McGuire and Local 117 Busi-
ness Agent Heber Briggs, with
Mine-Mill General C o u n s e 1
Nathan Witt writing the brief.

ness Agent Heber Briggs and
Int’l Rep. Tom McGuire.

Chilton’s decision is one of
several cases now on appeal.

_ TUCSON, Ariz.——Mine—Mill’s 1961 national legisla-
I tive program as adopted by the 56th convention not only
listed the issues of main concern to the delegates as citi-
 zens, but of itself represented a springboard for political

 action by the entire union.
 All the resolutions on the

 ﬁsubject approved by the.

- ---convention boiled down to a
.,_..single call to the new Admin-
istration and Congress for im-
*.‘mediate measures to halt the
_  present U. S. economic slump
.-«-and " further ' legislation to
.~~“Lstrengthen the nation's basic
‘economic structure against re-
current recessions.
The over-all program in-
’ ’cl_ude_d a major section speci-
- ‘fically detailing special indus-
‘ 5" proposals to promote full
"recovery and safeguard jobs
' ‘in non-ferrous metals. (See

. ' - THE ' many-sided resolution
1’ reported out by the legislative
7*“"7and political action committee
, noted that manycf the non-

ANSONIA, Conn. —— In a
quickie move which shocked
the rank-and-file membership,
the Executive Board of An-
sonia Brass Workers Local 445
switched allegiance from Mine-
Mill to Steel and urged the
membership to do likewise.
The "Local Board’s action was
taken without consultation or
approval by the membership

* or the stewards

Since the switch, it has be-
come known that some of the

_ Local Union leaders have been

in consultation with Steel or-
ganizers and Orville Larson
for ‘many months past and _a
“deal” was made. The rank-
and-file were totally unaware

- of.these discussions. -

The very day that the Loca
Board announced’ its action,
the International Union moved
in to protect the interests of
the Ansonia membership. The

Local officers were removed,

and International Secretary-
Treasurer Irving Dichter was

appointed Administrator of the
Local.

THE BOARD issued the fol-
lowing statement to the An-

vsonia Workers upon appointing

the Administrator:

Unanimous condemnation of the Steel raid in Ansonia was
voiced last month by the Western Mine-Mill Anaconda. Joint Ne-
gotiating Committee, representing five Anaconda locals in Mon-
tana and Utah, and by meetings of the Anaconda American
Brass locals in Buffalo, N. Y., and Torrington, Conn.

The Anaconda joint committee, meeting in the Butte Miners
Union Hall April 19, blasted Steel's raid -at the Ansonia ABC
plant and called on the Ansonia membership to support Mine-
Mill and reject this attempt to divide the Ansonia Brass Workers
from the other Anaconda Council local unions.

Represented at the meeting, chaired by District 1 Board
Member Ernest Salvas, were Locals 1, 16, 72 and 117 in Butte.
Great Falls, East Helena and Anaconda, Montana, and Local 55

in Tooele, Utah.

New Look

-At Foreign
Policy Urged

TUCSON, Ariz.—A new look
at the foreign policies and pro-
gram of the previous adminis-
tration was called for in a
major peace statement adopt-
ed by the Mine-Mill conven-
tion.

Noting that the change in
administration 1 a s 17. January
and shift in top level State
Department personnel “pro-
vides a timely opportunity”
for the new look, the resolu-
tion said the march of events
in the rest of the world as
well as rapidly changing inter-
national developments makes
such a fresh and appraisal “a
matter of‘ imperative national
importance.”

The global events teferred
to included “the tumultuous
emergence of the new nations
of Africa, the discovery that
we have been losing’ friends in
the Latin American lands to
the south of us, our seeming
unpreparedness. for develop-
ments in Asia, the overwhelm-
ing and growing need for prog-
ress in achieving genuine nu-
clear disarmament and relaxa-
tion of tensions with the Sovi-
et bloc.”

>i< >3 :36

WHILE it pointed out that
the Eisenhower administration
“left the country with a bank-
rupt foreign policy,” the reso-
lution charged that the Demo-
cratic bi-partisanship “must
bear its share of the blame
with the Republicans.”

“What may well be a new
departure from the negativism
and sterile brinkmanship of
the previous administration”
was welcomed by the state-
ment in its appraisal of the
expressed policies of the new

administration as it took of-

fice this year.

Hopeful signs of such a new
departure, the resolution said,
were President Kennedy’s dec-
laration against the U-2 photo-
reconnaissance flights over the
Soviet Union and a more posi-
tive policy in Kennedy’s. ap-
pointment of men like Adlai
Stevenson, Chester Bowles and
G. Memmen Williams. to high
posts in the conduct of foreign
affairs.

* BE =l<

RECALLING Kennedy’s in-
augural address. and its refer-
ences to peace, the statement
expressed the hope that this
‘-‘may come to prevail as the
guiding philosophy of his ad-
ministration.”

“The sincerity of these senti-
ments,” the resolution said,
“will ultimately have to be
tested in action; more than
just the appearance of change
is required.”

It drew this conclusion:

“What is now required is a
positive program that moves,
in specific and concrete ways,
to the ending of nuclear test-
ing a.nd to ultimate disarma-
ment, to support the demo-
cratic peoples’ movements and
an end to colonialism in all
parts of the world, to the eco-
nomic development of under-
developed countries, and to a
halt to the wasteful squander-
ing of money a.nd resources on
armaments expenditures that
offer no real security.”

While acknowledging that
“such a program will meet
with powerful opposition from
some elements in Congress, in
business and in public office,”
the resolution declared that “it
will rally wide~sup.port from

TUCSON, Ari,z.,—~If a delegate at the l\»line-Mill con-
vention happened to miss any session, he had no difficulty
finding out what he’d missed. All he had to do was look
at a daily paper or tune in on the radio or TV news.

The consensus of old convention hands was that no-

where has a Mine-Mill con-
vention r e cc i ve d better
news coverage than this one
did in Tucson.

‘Even before
opened, reporters from the
two local newspapers, the
Tucson Daily Citizen and the
Arizona Daily Star, as well as
the statewide daily published
in Phoenix, the Arizona Re-
public, were intouch with the
convention press office for in-
terviews and information.

Arizona press, plus radio and «

TV, and the wire services of
the Associated Press and Uni-

ally carried full coverage of
the convention.

The Tucson morning and af-

a - couple of different stories
in each issue, all straight
news, often with pictures, and
sometimes adding newer stor-

New Emphasis Points Up Job,
Income Security in Bargaining

, TUCSON, Ariz-.—“ ‘Efficiency’ and ‘cost reduction’-have become the slogans un-

A der which companies justify their pursuit of profitsat the expense of labor,” a major
a statement on bargaining adopted, by Mine-Mill’s 56th convention declared.

 A new emphasis on job and income security in bargaining was pointed up in the
the conventions wage and contract policy com-

security proposals “that need
to be projected by the entire
American labor movement as
well as by this union,” the res-
olution said, “is the demand
for a shorter work week with-
out loss in take-home pay.”
In adopting it, the conven-
tion Went on record “in sup-
port of the 32-hour work week
for 40 hours pay. in our indus-
try,” and pledged lVIine~Mill to
“work for this goal in Con-
gress, in the next negotiations,
and anywhere a gain can be
made for the shorter work

week.” ‘

OTHER measures listed to-
gether to provide some eco-
nomic cushion against the
shock of unemployment were
severance pay and supplemen-
tal unemployment benefits.

Stating that higher wages
will of course continue to be a
major bargaining demand, the
report pointed to the extension
of additional main elements
of the bargaining‘ program on
which Mine-Mill has already
made some notable progress.

These include:
Developmentof a more equi-
table industry - wide wage

structure to eliminate all ex- ,

isting inequities; and further

development of a common per- ~

spective on pensions to elimi-
nate variations in both bene-
fit provisions -and expiration
dates, as —-well as additional
improvements covering vest-
ing rights, early retirement,
eligibility rules and life insur-
ance for retired employees.

-GOALS enumerated-for bar-
gaining on health and wel-
fare included: -

Continued improvements of
benefits, reduction of em-
ployee contributions, improve-
ment in quality of medical
care, extension of outpatient
prescription benefits, dental
care, coverage for retired em-
ployees, and joint administra-
tion of insurance plans.

Another bargaining objec-
tive is the removal of all re-
strictions on eligibility and
qualifications for holiday and
vacation benefits. M

Kcnnecott Council’s
Demands Presented

SALT LAKE CITY—Mine-Mil1’s Kennecott Council,
last month, presented the company with a full set or
1961 bargaining demands on behalf of all Mine-Mill locals
in Western division operations. The Council, through an
April 12 letter from its Coordinator, District 2 Board

Member Verne Curtis, pro-
posed that negotiations
start early in May.

The Couucil’s contract pro-
posals, adopted during its pro-
convention meeting at Tucson,
included all items contained in
the convention-adopted bar-
gaining program plus several
additional proposals of partic-
ular significance to Kennecotl:
workers.

The bargaining package in-
cluded proposals on job secur-
ity issues, wage demands,
health and welfare, pensions,
vacations and several non-eco-
nomic contractual issues.

=‘.= =i= *

HIGH on the list was the
Council's demand for a 32-
hours normal work week with

' no cut in present take-home

pay. Other “job security” pro-
posals called for: a company-
financed supplemental unem-
ployment benefit plan, im-
provement of the existing sev-
erance pay plan, job transfer
rights to other company oper-
ations for workers laid off in
a shutdown of all or part of
an operation, and prohibition
"of contracting-out of work
customarily p e r f or In e d by

workers represented by Mine- ‘

Mill locals.
~On wages, the Council asked
for . “a substantial general-

wage increase” plus elimina-

tion of remaining differentials ' -

in the -company’s Southwest
operations in Arizona, and
New Mexico. Within the past
two years, as the result of the
1959 settlement, pre-existing
differentials between the
Southwest and Utah-Nevada

' operations have been cut in

half.

Health and welfare demands
call for increases in weekly
sickness and accident benefits
( to $65 per week for 78 weeks
duration), in allowances for
medical office visits, and in
dependents major medical ben-
efits; payment of out-patient

zation of eligibility rules. The
company is also asked to con-
tinue the eligibility of retired
workers and their dependents
for all benefits.

PENSION proposals call for

increases in benefits to $2.50 a
month per year of service,
normal retirement at age 62,
early‘ retirement at age .55;
after 10 years service, in-
creased disability benefits of
$100 per month, and other im-
provements. Employees laid
off after age 55 because of
technological changes, the
Council asks, should be per-
mitted to draw their full‘ pen-
sions at that time.

Other proposals include:

Increased vacation benefits‘
with pro-rata. vacation pay for
men separated from the pay-
roll; supplemental workmen’-s
compensation benefits; higher
rate for overtime on holidays
with all overtime work option-
al with employees; improve-
ments in job evaluation pro-
cedures; elimination of the no-
strike clause; amendment of
“rules and regulations” clause
to make all rules negotiable;
and a 40-hour pay guarantee
for workers whose normal
work week is reduced during
any pay period.

Steelworkers Get Taste of Own Medicine

The United Steelworkers are
now getting a bitter taste of
their own medicine—.and they
don't like it.

The Steelworkers have prob-

ably '‘c o n d up to d more raids ~
against -other unions than any =

single American’ union. Now
they’re being raided by an-
other AFL-CIO affiliate, the
Sheet Metal "Workers Union.

The USW—local at Syracuse,
N. Y. plant of the Carrier
Corp., on strike since March
2, 1960 for a‘_ first contract, is
now being challenged by the
Sheet Metal Workers for the

 

right to represent the 400 odd
workers at the plant. The
Sheet, Metal Workers have

filed a petition with the NLRB_

requesting an electionto de-
termine the bargaining agent.

IN a front page story head-

ed “Major Split Threatening
AFL-CIO” the American Metal
Market of April 6 reported
that U.S.W. officials com-
plained to George Meany,
AFL-CIO president, at an un-
publicized meeting in Wash-
ington and “made it clear

that consequences would -be »

grave if the AFL-CIO failed
to take satisfactory action.”

“The Steelworkers are ready ~

to consider disaffiliation, it
was learned, if the principles

for which they’re fighting in ‘

the Carrier -dispute are not
settled to their satisfaction,”
the news story said.

Later stories reported that

Meany was meeting‘ with
Sheet Metal Workers leaders-

in an effort to resolve the dis-
pute.

MINE-MILL officials, while
deploring the use of raiding
“as destructive of the most

fundamental principles of the
trade union movement,” also
noted that the Steelworkers of-
ficialdom cannot escape re-
sponsibility for the present
plight of their striking Car-
rier members in Syracuse,

-N. Y.

The Steelworkers, it was ob-
served, by their own frequent
raids against this and other
unions, had greatly contribut-
ed to discrediting the entire
labor movement. “They can't
spread the germs as much as
they have without eventually
being bitten themselves," the
union's officers said.

Asbury Howard

I Unopposed for
Eastern Vice-Presidenﬂ

I would like to express my
thanks and appreciation for
the nomination again without
opposition to the office of
Eastern Vice-President of the
International Union of Mine,
Mill and Smelter Workers, one
of the finest and most demo-
cratic unions in the nation.

It is indeeda great pleasure
to serve you in this capacity.
I am proud and honored to be
an officer of this Union. It is
an honor just to be a member
of this great union. I love this
union because of the very prin-
ciples that it stands for: The
fatherhood of God and the
brotherhood of man.

Always remembering that
“An injury to one is an injury
to all,” Mine-Mill Works for
the upgrading and equal oppor-
tunities for all workers regard-
less of race, creed, color or na-
tional origin. Our union must
do even more and Work harder
to assure more representation
of minorities at the top level of
our union.

I wish to thank the member-
ship in the States and in Can-
ada for the support that I have
received as an officer of this
great union. I solicit your con-
tinued support.

I pledge to give the kind of
leadership that is expected of
a leader. I accept all the re-
sponsibilities that go with the
office.

I further pledge to support
the program adopted by the
Convention 100 per cent and
work as closely with whoever
is elected to office by the mem-
bership as I have in the past.

I also pledge to work as a
team with the Executive Board.
To my fellow officers——you
have my full and complete sup-
port. I have enjoyed working
with the present team of offi-
cers; I honestly feel they will
continue to be a heads-up team.

In the past year, we have
had better unity and coordina-
tion than any time that I can
recall. With such a team I
know the program of the union
will be carried out to the full-
est extent possible.

I urge each and every mem-
ber to support the entire pro-
gram adopted by the conven-
tion. I put special emphasis
on the dues and per capita in-
crease.

Please don’t look upon this
proposed increase as a dona-
tion or a gift, but rather as an
investment. Count up the cost
and see how much your invest-
ment has brought in wages, va-
cations, health & welfare, hos-
pital and doctor benefits, etc.

I am also urging every mem-
ber to vote in the May 16th
Referendum. ,

May God keepyou and bless

   

 

AI Skinner

(Western Vice-President)

It has been a long standing
tradition in Mine-Mill that can-
didates submit statements for
publication in our union paper

prior to the referendum vote -

every two years. This creates
a real problem for any candi-
date and it certainly does for
me. — - « . - . »

What am I supposed to say?
Am I supposed to tell. our
members in the United States
and Canada how all our prob-
lems will be solved if I am
elected? Am I supposed to
make a lot of promises?
That's the usual lin-e of a poli-
tician running for office in the
general elections.’ I don't, be-
lieve we need or ,want that
kind of election campaign in

"a trade union like Mine-Mill.

I believe that the thousands
of local leaders, stewards and
members who have been ac-
tive participants in the affairs
and operations of Mine-Mill
are very capable of judging a
candidate in our union on his
record in Mine-Mill, his prov-en
devotion to the Union and his
ability as a lea.der. That's all
I ask in this election.

If I don’t measure up then
I shouldn’t be elected. If you
believe my record, my ability
and my devotion to the prin-
ciples of Mine-Mill can pass
the critical test as a union

leader, then I would appreci- .-

ate your active support.

This process of examination
and judgment of our leader-
ship goes on- continuously in
Mine-Mill—at the bargaining
table, in conferences, conven-
tions, and at the ballot box.
It is a wonderful quality of
this most democratic union in
North America. The members,
stewards, officers and staff
members who have Worked
with me during my 22 years
of activity in this union will
have to be the judge of
whether I deserve to continue
as International Vice-Presi-
dent or not.

I welcome this opportunity
to have my record assessed
and judged at the ballot box
by our entire membership in
the United States and Canada.
So what I say in this state-
ment is really not very im-
portant. The membership will
do the talking at the ballot
box on May 16th.

The program of future ac-
tivity for our union, adopted
at the Tucson convention, is
reported in this paper. I sup-
port that program to the hilt.
It is a positive program. It
is a program to put our union
on the offensive—to expand
and extend the influence of
Mine-Mill throughout Canada
and the United States. It de-

serves your unqualified sup- I
‘V port, and let me assure you it
.will”ha‘Ve mine‘.

 

  

Ernest Sdvns

(Candidate for ,
Western Vice-President}

1 I am a‘ candidate, for West-

. ern Vice-President in the hope

that my candidacy and elec-
tion will contribute to the
greater unity, strength ’ and
growth of our organization.
We ‘have problems. in our
Union. I knowthey can be
solved. But to do so, we must

have unity, Unity so all sec-

tions of our membership are
represented in the Interna-
tional leadership—all sections,
including all nationalities and,
most especially, the basic min-
ing and smelting sections.

Unity means all points of
view found among our mem-
bers must be reflected in the
International
so long as those views include
loyalty to the principles of
democratic t r a d e unionism
upon which our Union is
founded.

International leadership ded-
icated to rank and file unity
and representation is absolute-
ly essential if we are to main-
tain and strengthen our Union.

Our bargaining must be con-
ducted in a vigorous and re-
sponsible manner. We ‘must
take full advantage of the
militancy of our members
without exposing them to
needless risks. If elected, I
will devote my fullest capabil-
ities towards this end.

We, also, must have vigor-
ous activity in Washington,
D. C., and in State legislatures
towards the enactment of our
progressive program. Espe-
cially so in the fields of health,
safety, compensation and
early retirement. Here, too, I
hope, my experience will con-
tribute materially.

We must re-establish our
Union as the most advanced
trade union in the fight for
civil rights.

We must preserve our inde-
pendence and the democratic
character of our Union by de-
feating all subversive efforts
of the Steel Workers or any
other organization; We must
fight to prevent any further
fragmentation of the workers
in this industry.

We are going to need money
to expand our activities.
I hope for the success of the
per capita and dues referen-
dum.

If our Union is to be
strengthened we, all of us,
must fight for the complete
acquittal and vindication of all
the defendants in the so-called
conspiracy case. All of us will
suffer if we don't win their
acquittal.

Finally, a b o v e everything
else, it is to the best interest

of our Union that the hopes’

and aspirations of our mem-
bers are realized. To do this,
we must b uild our internal
strength by uniting our broad
membership. . . . They are th

.strength of Mine’-l\_/Iill. . 

  

   

   

leadership,

Irving Dichfer
- lﬂnopposed for
_‘ Secretary-Treasurer) _.

A I For the past year and a half, I

I have worked to place our In-
ternational Union on a sound

, financial footing. Our Tucson,
— C o n ve n t i o n overwhelmingly

voted to increase our per cap-
ita. I urge every member of

our Union‘ to Vote YES on the 

per capita‘ referendum.
Increased operating income
will give us the opportunity,

for the first time in many .

years, to develop a long-range
organizational program. Now-
adays, a scatter-gun approach
to organization brings little re-
sults. One of our key organi-
zational objectives must be a
win-back campaign at Bunker
Hill. I
. I shall of course devote my
energy to bring to life the pro-
gram our delegates developed
at the Convention. It is a
sound program encompassing
the needs of our membership.
Key in that program is the de-
velopment and fight for job
security.

"No worker in our industry
today is certain of tomorroW’s
paycheck. This insecurity must
come to an end. The compa-
nies in our industry have made
enormous profits over the
years and accumulated huge
financial reserves. It is time
they were forced to meet their
responsibility to the workers
whose labor has so enriched
them. '

I have always supported and
fought for a national leader-
ship which would be represent-
ative of all sections and groups
within our Union. It is this
kind of leadership which has
been our strength. This is
Mine-Mill unity. When our
election is over, we must heal
whatever breaches an election
may bring about and work to-
gether in the interest of our
membership.

I am writing this statement
in Ansonia where we are fight-
ing a Steel raid. Nothing has
been more destructive to the

life and spirit of the trade un- '

ion movement than this busi-
ness of one Union attempting
to destroy another by raiding.
The victims are always the
rank-and-file Workers. There
is only one way to defeat raid-
ing, and that is by smashing it.
I want to salute our Cana-
dian Mine-Mill Union. Cana-
dian autonomy has proved a
contributing factor towards
strengthening our Union in
Canada and thereby strength-
ening us. Now we must de-
velop an ever closer relation-
ship with our Canadian broth-
ers. We must also begin a
movement to develop closer
ties with all the miners and
smeltermen in North and
South America. We must fight
to break our separation from
these Workers who have so_
much.,in'common with us.

with‘ Ernie S.alvas,- my ..p'rede-.

PM - cessor -and a candidate - for
. Western Vice-President.

Ernie .and'I are both work-
ers from our industry. I be-
lieve that Ernie’s success as a

, Board member was because he

understood the problems of
the membership in Montana.

In Montana, the Interna-

tional Union of Mine, Mill and _

Smelter Workers is the most
important part of the labor
movement. Under E r n-i e’s
leadership, we are recognized
on every level from the bar-
gaining table to the national
capital.

We in Montana are justly
proud of Ernie, and it is with
great pride that I support him

' as candidate for the office of

Western Vice-President of the
International Union of Mine,
Mill and Smelter Workers.

The ‘office of Board Mem-
ber for District 1 is not an
easy job. We in District 1 face
the same problems that our
union and all the labor move-
ment faces, and we must all
work together to help solve
these problems.

I believe my experience as a
miner and union leader quali-
fies me for this position.

I hope that under my leader-
ship District No. 1 will con-
tinue to play a leading role
within the labor movement,
the community and within the
International Union of Mine,
Mill and Smelter Workers.

Repeal of "Wreck"

they neither guarantee you a
job nor protect you from lay-
off or discharge,” the resolu-

of these “wreck” laws through A

No. 1. Per Capita Increase,‘
and ‘

"The per capita increase is

.mu c h more important than

the selection of a Board Mem-
ber in District #2.

In order for our Union to
take the offensive, increase
our legislative activity, broad-
en our Research Departments
and Educational Program, to

participate in all phases of ‘

trade union activity, to indulge
in greater community under-
takings and to build a formi-
dable strike fund, we must in-
crease our per capita.

I specifically urge each and
every member to work for and
vote for the per capita tax in-
crease.

In District #2 we are now
faced with raids and negotia-
tions in ‘Kennecott——negotia-
tions in Inspiration at Miami,

when the Kennecott Council
can play such an important

industry. ‘

,9 I am 34 yearsold. I was
born in the -mining town of
Superior, Arizona. I first went
to work in the mining indus-
try at the age of 15 at the
Magma _ smelter in Superior,
Arizona and at the age of 17

I went to work underground.

After discharge. from the
army I started working at the

San Xavier mine in 1947 which

was organized into Mine Mill
in 1950. I became President
of my local union in San

Xavier ino1951 and in June of

1952 I was appointed an In-

In January of 1958 I was as-

was assigned as Regional Di-
rector for the same area. I
am a member of El Paso Cop-

I strongly support the poli-

tion, etc. But to do all this our

union needs additional reve-

nue. We must also build an
adequate strike fund.

Consequently, I stand strong-
ly in favor of increasing the
per capita to our International
Union. ’

I also wish to express my
support for the present top,
four officers of our union. We
have a fine team in these men
and it is my opinion that their
leadership should be con-
tinued. ’ -

I. go ~on,-lrecord in complete
support of that program and

- reiterate my support of the,

constitutional amendment
which the ‘membership will
vote on in the May 16 ref-
erndum. The 75-cent increase
in per capita is vitally neces-

sary if we are to put into ef-

fect the magnifioent program
adopted by the —Convention. I
again urge thatlocal union of-
ficers and stewards take every
means to be sure that the rank
and fileeare fully informed on
the financial needs of‘ the In-
ternational and their local un-
ions, that a drive is madein
each local to get out the maxi-
mum votes in support of the
amendment.

Our Union continues to move
forward on all fronts in its
efforts. on behalf of its mem-
bership and no small credit for
that progress and increased
strength goes to the union’s
leadership headed by the four
Internatio-nal officers. I fully
endorse Western Vice Presi-
dent Albert Skinner for re-
election. He is a great trade
unionist of outstanding ability.

His service as an organizer for -

bothCIO and this Union goes
back to the late 1930’s.

He is not only a top-notch
organizer but a very able
executive officer as well, and
has made many valuable con-
tributions to the success and
growth of our Union. Before
being appointed by the Execu-
tive Board to fill the vacancy
of Western Vice President
created by the resignation of
Orville Larson, Brother Skin-
ner led manylof the organiza-
tional campaigns that brought
into CIO and our Union many
shops in the Midwest states.
He is known;by thousands of
our members as a result of
his leadership ‘in "combating
raids from the East Coast to
the Rocky Mountain States.
Certainly a man of su ch
loyalty, ability, and accom-
plishment in behalf of the Un-
ion deserves the overwhelming
support of our membership.

.— I also support the other
three officers who are running
without opposition, President-
John Clark, Eastern Vice
President Asbury Howard and

Secretary-Treasurer I r v in g .

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Alfred
Petit-Clair i

I Unoppo-sed for Board _
Member. Districtaél

The Tuscon Convention has

established the ‘program of‘

our Union for the-next-year.

‘ . This program, adopted after 5 A
- days of discussion anddebate-.
. 1 -by the full Convention -and-in I
~ the traditional d e m;o c r a ti c"
 manner ‘_ofg”Mi—ne_§-‘Mill’, is the’
 r.esp‘on'sibi;lity’" ‘of ‘every me'm- 

ber. -

- In accepting the nomination

for Board- -Member ’of_ District

No. 6, I accept my responsibil-
B ity for -the carrying out. of this

. program .-to V the best of my

ability. - -

The main points of this pro-.

gram call for the: A — -
— 1. Continued defenseof our
‘ Union and its leaders against

anti-Union elements. »

2. The strengthening of our
Union’s finances by ‘ passage

 of the per capita amendment.

3. Continued struggle in
the field of Civil Rights until
all discrimination ceases. ‘

.4. Concluding our- bargain-
ing program this year success-
fully. '

5. Extension of our legisla-
tive and community work.

To a greater or lesser de-
gree all of us have the re-
sponsibility of seeing that this
program is a success. I know
that the rank and file of Dis-
trict #6 will give their support
to the Union and its program.

There is another responsi-
bility which we all share in
this democratic Union, and

, that is seeing to it that all dif-

ferences of opinion are re-
solved in the best interest of
the membership.

Such a difference has arisen
as to who shall be the next
Western Vice-President of our
Union. Here two -- brothers,
both with excellent records of
support to our Union and both
devoted to it, are contesting
for the post.

Most of our Locals in ~Dis-
trict #6 have endorsed the
candidacy of Ernest Salvas,
feeling that his election will
strengthen this Union. I share
this opinion. It is my feeling
that the election of Brother
Salvas will unify all sections
of this Union and improve our
work in many vital areas. For
that reason I support him.

At the same time, I am sure
that regardless of the out-
come, the Mine-Mill member-
ship will stand united behind

' . the Union and its elected offi-

cers. Our Union has always
been able to resolve differ-
ences democratically.

‘ . One final thought, I would
like to thank the members of
District #6 for their expres-
sion of confidence in nominat-
‘ing me. I.accept the nomina-

tion confident that they will -

continue to give me their full

 ‘_:support"in carrying out the
 "f ‘program. of this Union,-and I
 v. 1 pledge «them my best efforts.

Union Executive Board

C. J. (Powers

(Board-Member. District 7!. .

Iwould like to express my
deep appreciation to then dele-
gates -of District '7 for‘ again

,placing.-my name in nomina-
' tion forBoard Member of ‘Dis- <

trict 7.. , . v .
- I am fully aware thatl have

- not been‘able_ to visit your»lo- 
»cal and‘ .to-assistvyou in any."-
- way that I could. I know you
~ appreciate ,t—he~=.-fact: that -the V
" s't_r'u-ggle“ in -the Coeur ’.d’A:lene'ss ._
: was one? of the major _t_"ightsf
_.of this 1‘ union x;ca_rried on
' ‘against ‘every conceivable com-

pany .attack. _ _ __
To avoid thestrike, we..I,.1'i.e-is

-s~gotiated— for almost 9a solid‘
7 year beforegoing -on the s-ev-_
en and one-half” month strike.

I felt duty bound to stay with

this situation and give them,

-every assistance that I could.

We have come out of a con-
vention with a uniform, for-
ward-looking program, a pro-
gram that envisages a strug-
gle against the problems that
confront labor. and how these
problems are to be met. 1
, Automation is today threat-
ening every man’s' job. This is
a problem that cannot be en-
tirely solved across the bar-
gaining table——it requires re-
search, political action and
new approaches. By and large,

- this burden is going to fall

upon the independent unions.

Labor today cannot depend
upon the do-nothing policies
and the internal bickering that
now seems to be the only pro-
gram that the “so-called”
House of Labor has to offer.

In the light of this, I be-
lieve through» coordinated ac-
tions, the independent unions

can and must bring forth a .

constructive pro gram. If
elected, I will bend every ef-
fort in this direction. '

This program will require
a sound financial basis on
which to meet andwork with

the other independent unions. -

The program adopted by the
Convention is designed to
meet this requirement.

I also believe that my past
experience is an asset to this
district and the International
Union on any program. I fur-
ther believe that the ‘present
International Officers should
be returned to office, they are
working now with several in-
dependent unions to coordi-
nate programs and should be
permitted to carry this out.

I am in wholehearted sup-
port of the program adopted
at the Tucson Coonvention
and if elected will do all I can
to put it into effect.

Women Live Longer

Women usually live longer
than men in this country, and
the relative difference has in-
creased steadily since 1900.
The average girl born in 1958
could expect to live 72.7 years,
or 6.3 years longer than the
66.4 life expectancy for boys.

Resolutions Stress
Civil Rights Issues

TUCSON, A.riz.—Several steps to advance the strug-
gle for civil rights and guarantee first-class citizenship
status for all Americans were urged— by the convention
delegates in a major resolution which termed this issue
one of the most important and vital of our times.

Passage of adequate civil
rights legislation was called
f_or. “The granting of civil
rights to all American citizens
regardless of creed, color, re-
ligion or national origin will
determine our position before
all other nations of the world,”
the resolution declared.

It commended the new ad-
ministration for its good start
in the civil rights field by
means of President Kennedy’s
executive order to cancel gov-
ernment contracts with com-
panies practicing job discrimi-
nation, and further called on
the Chief Executive “to assert
the moral and legal authority
of his office to end segrega-
tion in our country.”

All Mine-Mill locals were
urged to strengthen their ef-
forts to bring full job rights
for all minorities, including
the elimination of bias in hir-
ing and upgrading, and of all
discriminatory wage rates.

=l= >l< >l~'

THE LOCALS were also
called upon to support and
take joint action in their own
communities, as well as on
state and national levels, with
all patriotic organizations
fighting for citizenship rights
such as the Southern Chris-
tian Movement, the Southern
Educational Fund, the South-
ern Leadership Conference
and the NAACP.

To carry out the intent of
the resolution, the delegates
instructed the International
Executive Board to establish
a civil rights committee of
-leading union members, both
from the districts and the
Board, which would be respon-

CIVIL LIBERTIES

In another resolution on

L Hartley,

civil liberties, the convention
went on record memorializing
Congress ‘_‘to repeal those pro-
visions of the immigration and
naturalization laws which pen-
alize aliens for their political
beliefs and affiliations.”
Asked, too, were the repeal
of provisions of the Walter-
McCarran act which discrimi-

nate against persons of cer-

tain national origins, and the
liberalization of other provi-
sions of such laws.

The convention also ex-
pressed regret at failure of
the House of Representatives
in this session of Congress to
modify its rules so as to abol-
ish the Un-American Activities
committee. This resolution
said that “the committee still
can and should be prevented
from further abuse of its man-
date through close control and
supervision of its activities

a and particularly of its expendi-

tures.”

THE Landrum-Griffin act
and other so-called “labor re-
form” laws were hit as re-
strictive and “.inter.fering with
the rights of unions and union
members to barg-ain effective-
ly’ in another convention ac-
tion on labor’s civil liberties.

“Restrictive legislation, lim-
iting the right to speak, think,
write, travel, organize, meet
and engage in political action,
weakens the fight of labor to
Win a fuller and better life
through the democratic proc-
ess,” the resolution declared.

It also stated the union’s
stand “for unity with all la-
bor for the repeal of all re-
strictive labor legislation in-
cluding repressive acts such
as Landrum-‘Griffith, Taft-
Walter-1VlcCarran,
Smith and Brovvnell-Butler.”

Justice Must Begin at Home,
Rev. Abernathy Tells Delegates

TUCSON, Ariz.——A leader in the struggle for integration in the South told the

Mine-Mill convention that the nations of the world are asking America to “put up or

ism for some.”

He was the Rev. Dr. Ralph D. Abern

First Baptist Church and

successor to the Rev. Dr.

Martin Luther King as Presi-
dent of the Montgomery Im-
provement Association. His
moving speech was one of the
most warmly received of the
entire convention.

“We of this generation must

THE MINE-MILL UNION

-Montoya Scores Eisenhower
 --Era for Blocking Social Laws

TUCSON, Ariz.—Hist0ry will record the last eight years “as the conservative era

,  of do-nothing complacency,” U. S. Rep. Joseph M. Montoya (D., N.M.) said here March
 -' 27 at the opening session of the Mine-Mill convention.
- Addressing the delegates as the convention’s first guest speaker, Montoya said
, “the term ‘fiscal responsibility’ was. the concoction of a national administration which

3 used it to block legislation
beneficial to working peo-

 _ ple and productive of greater

goals in our social structure

such as education, unemploy-
ment compensation, housing
 and.a better deal for our elder-

 - ly citizens.”

’ - He said the record showed
that. during the 157 years
from President Washington to
President Truman total na-
tional tax receipts were $570,-
786,5(il,814, while during the

.. eight years of the Eisenhow-
or administration the tax re-
eeipts, were $624,488,272,231, or
a total of nearly $54 billion
more in revenue than the

 Washington to Truman period.

  

Montoya emphasized that
despite “this exorbitant eight
years’ expenditure” by Mr.

-Eisenhower, “not one solitary
"recommendation came from
the White House for depressed
area legislation, for relief of
the mining industry, for food
and clothing for the children
of unemployed miners, for
7 Classroom construction in
I areas where local tax payers.
were not financially able to
provide for these needed fa-
cilities ‘. . . for elderly citizens.”
>l= ::< >2<
_, , ‘ TURNING to the US. min-
 ing industry, he said its eco-
nomic decline during the last
few years was due to “unre-
__ alistic policy on foreign im-
 ~ ports.”
- "“lE’roduction of lead in 1959,”
.“-line said, “was the lowest on
record since 1899, while U. S.
, mine output of zinc both in
1958 and’1959 was lower than
in any earlier year since the
great depression of the early
, I930’s.” All ’ this, he added,
 - while mine production of both
lead and zinc in foreign coun-
tries was increasing.
_ , “We must do something to
“ revitalize a fading part of our
0 mining economy,” he said;
>l< =l= =l=
_ DISCUSSING the Kennedy
administrations anti-recession
 ‘program, the Congressman

pointed to the proposal for
economic development under
depressed a r e. a. s legislation.

Only last Saturday in Con-
gress, Montoya said, “I saw
the flag of the. Republican par-
ty-’ waving its opposition to
constructive legislation deal-
ing‘ with minimum wages for
millions of our f ellow citi-
zens." He said the “wagon
train of the new frontier” for
a higher‘ living wage “got
stalled in the. muddy» waters of
Republican opposition.”

He stressed the need of fed-
eral aid to education, particu-
larly in view of a shortage of

142,000 classrooms and more

than 100,000 teachers, with ex-
isting classes overcrowded and

"teachers badly underpaid. in

many areas. “The federal gov-
ernment, as the guardian of
the national interest,,has the
responsibility to insure an

equal educational opportunity
for all children, no matter
where they live,” he said.

THE liberal congressman re-
jected the theory that union
wage demands cause inflation,
pointing out that the public
must be convinced that the de-
mands are premised on the di-
rect relationship b e t W e e n
wages and net profits of man-
agement.

“High prices,” he said, “are
not sired, as some people
think, in the union halls. Look

around you and you will find
many other breeding places in
the swamps of industrial con-

-\/spiracy.”

On this point, Montoya re-
marked: “We do not hear too
much about the sins of big in-
dustry when it conspires to rig
prices for consumers’ goods
beyond the sphere of reason-
able return for its investment.
The anti-trust suits to which
big industry’pleads guilty of
over-charging the consumer
are relegated to lesser public
notice.” .

Udall Calls for Top
level Metals Parley

_ TUCSON, Ariz.—A national conference “on the
highest level” to chart a sound program for the nation’s
non-ferrous. metals industry was urged here by Morris K.
Udall. _“It should be held soon and perhaps the blessing
of President Kennedy should be sought to give the meet-

ing impetus,” the Demo-
cratic congressional candi-
date declared.

Udall made his proposal in

a speech to Mine-Mill’s 56th —

convention. He is a candidate
for Congress from Arizona’s
second district in a special
election May 2.‘to. fill the seat
left vacant by the appoint-
ment of his brother, Stuart

Secretary of the Interior.

“D0 we have problems?”

The non-ferrous picture is
“a tremendously c o In p 1 e x
one,” Udall told the union del-

egates. He noted there is wide j

disagreement about what ac-
tions should be taken.
=l= =’s -*

“EVEN managements of dif-
ferent copper companies dis-
agree as to what is the best
way to cure industry ills,”
Udall observed.‘

let’s have a meeting of the
minds by all groups directly
involved in the industry. If
the experts can’t agree, how
can We expect congressmen
to agree when they are asked
to ‘do something.’ ”

Leading to reduced produc-
tion and employment, Udall
said, are competition from low
wage mines overseas; compe-
tition from other products,
and a general lack of vigor in
parts of the nation’s economy,
lessening demand for non-for
1-ous products.

The copper picture is com-
plicated by such factors as the
ownership of foreign mines by
American copper producers,
said Udall.

THE industry turned to sci-
ence to find ways to produce
copper from low-grade ores,
the candidate said. Now the
industry is again turning to

science to find new uses for

copper to match the vast pro-
duction now possible, he added.

The federal government
ought. to encourage. manage-
ment and labor to work out a
program for re-training aml
re-locating people permanent-
ly displaced by machines,
Udall said.

Udall also promised to study
carefully Mine—lVlill’s proposal
for letting miners become eli-
gible for social securityat age
60 instead of age 65. '

Variety of
Resolutions
Submitted

‘ TUCSON, Ariz.—Some 125
resolutions on a wide variety
of subjects were submitted to I
the convention for committee
and delegate action. The ma-
jor actions are reported in
separate stories in this paper.
Among other subjects

covered were resolutions on

hydroelectric power, federal
regulation of hospitals, federal

tax liens, ladies auxiliaries and

routine constitutional changes.

The convention went on rec-
ord asking that some of the
funds now being spent on for-
eign aid to underdeveloped
countries be earmarked for
construction of hydro-' and
other electrical energy , plants
which would-stimulate the use
and production of copper in
this country, and thus serve to
save jobs in this industry.

ANOTHER resolution urged
the regulation ‘of hospitals as ‘
public utilities and asked for
a government investigation of
profiteering by the medical
profession reflected in rising
increased
insurance premiums. It point-
ed» out rising costs have caused
health and welfare programs‘
toshow losses resulting in the

-boost of premiums which, if

allowed to go unchecked, will
wreck union insurance plans.

A resolution, based on the
experience of Local 632 iniIn-
dianapolis, Ind., was approved.
It called on Congress to estab-
lish legislation to prevent the
federal government from tak-
ing 100 percent of a working-
man’s paycheck for delin-
quent federal taxes.

Recommendations by the
Executive B 0 a r (1 regarding
the chartering of ladies auxil-
iaries were also approved in a
resolution which a c k n 0 w l-
edged a number of requests
for such charters. Rights and
duties of the auxiliaries under
the International constitution
were enumerated in the reso-
lution.

Approval was also voted by
the convention on changes in
the union’s constitution pursu-
ant to -the requirements of.-the
Landrum ‘Griffin. act -. regard-
.ing -local union‘ elections and
by-laws.

Delegates Urge I 

Labor Unity, Hit

.Wasteful Raids";

TUCSON, Ariz.—Raids by ,

any union on another’s juris-
diction were condemned by
the delegates here in a reso-

lution which termed inter-"y " ' "

union raiding “destructive of

the most fundamental princi-“

pals of the trade union move-

ment.”_ _
The convention called on all

of labor to denounce raiding"

‘ as an anti-union practice. It
urged that “the energies and _

resources now being wasted
on destructive 1-aids be divert-
ed into constructive and united
effort to resolve the major
problems of unemployment,
job security and beneficial la-
bor legislation now facing the
membership of every union
in North America.”

In this connection, anotner~_

resolution was approved “to
advance labor unity as th-eone

basis upon which a militant V‘ S

and effective labor movement
can be reestablished.”

 

May. 19517

“We intend,” the resolution ‘

declared, “to develop our rela- ,1

tions with all unions on every
possible level . . . and to do so
formally, informally, on a lo-

cal, company-wide or national _

basis.”

the general economic reces-
sion in the country.
Their conclusions on this

were spelled out in major res-
olutions projecting programs
for non-ferrous metals and
both immediate and future
bargaining.
alt 26 *
REFLECTING intimate
awareness of the acute crisis
which has arisen in all
branches of the industry in
recent months, the convention
formulated s p e c i a 1 industry

-. ‘ proposals to meet the present

crisis and promote full recov-

ery in relation to world-wide

and domestic conditions.
These proposals were speci-

A fied both for the industry as

a whole as well as for the
particular problems of copper,
lead, zinc and brass.

VA new emphasis on job and
income security was pointed
up by the delegates in an over-
all resolution adopted on bar-
gaining which declared that
“efficiency and ‘cost reduction’
have become the slogans un-
der which companies justify
their pursuit of profits at the
expense of labor.”

While Mine-Mill bargaining
this year will be mainly
limited to Kennecott, U. S.
Metals and companies in the

‘Miami, Ariz., area, the resolu-

tion included a program look-
ing beyond immediate de-
mands and listing proposals
for future negotiations. The

. Kennecott Council, meeting at

the convention as did the
other major bargaining coun-

- cils, outlined its own immedi-

ate program of demands for.
presentation to the company.
* >k ik ‘

BOTH actions on the indus-
try and bargaining were
coupled with another compre-
hensive resolution which
spelled out gbals in a national
legislative and political action
program calling on the new
Administration and Congress
for immediate measures to
halt the present U. S. eco-
nomic slump, and further leg-
islation to strengthen the na-
tion’s basic economic struc-
ture.

_ Another major action of the

delegates was their over-
whelming support of the res-
olution to put the union on a
more sound financial footing
by raising the per capita to

$2.50 per month, an increase -

of 75 cents, 25 cents of which
is to go into the Interna.tional
Union Strike Fund.

The convention-backed per
capita proposal will be sub-
mitted for membership vote in
the Mine-Mill referendum on
May 16 when the election of
International Officers and
Executive Board members

nominated at the convention »

will also be held.

ALTHOUGH one top Inter-

nationalioffice and two posts
of district Board Member are
being contested in the May 16
referendum, it was obvious at
the convention that all the
candidates are united on the
future of Mine-Mill and its
convention-adopted program.
A tribute to the union’s
position as dominant in the
industry was contained not
only in the actions of the dele-

gates, but in the convention
speeches by distinguished
leaders in the political, labor
and civil‘rights field, as’ well
as in the many greetings re-
ceived from prominent Ameri-
cans.

The big social event of the
convention was a cocktail
party and sumptuous Western
Chuckwagon dinner and dance
for the delegates, wives and
guests.

Before adjourning, the dele-
gates chose Great Falls, Mont.,
as the 1963 convention site.

 

Labor Sees Threat to Jobs in
Administration Tax Program

WASHINGTON, D. C.——President Kennedy’s tax message went to Congress late
last month. Labor has been solidly opposed to the program since the outlines first be-
came known. Key point in his program was a proposal to reduce taxes, by a compli-
cated formula, for virtually all types of business which stepped up investment’ in new
plant and equipment. This would mean a tax cut of about $1,700,000,000 per year for

these companies, according
to government estimates.
Behind the proposal is the
desi_re‘of the president and his
policy advisers to ,“modernize”
American industry. The presi-
dent’s message even goes so far
as to say that “great benefits

result and are distributed Wide-_ '

ly”. from “automation,” which
he calls another word for mod-
ernization; ' E i

THE MESSAGE estimates
that about 500,000 new jobs
would be created under his pro-
gram, mainly in the construc-
tion, machinery and building

materials industries, w h i c h .

would build and install thenew
plants. The message also ad-
mits that Workers would lose
jobs as the new labor-saving,
automated equipment is in-
stalled. No estimate of jobless-
ness due to this cause is given
in the president's message.
Labor leaders are frankly
skeptical about the effects of
the tax program on jobless-
ness. With unemployment at
high levels’ now and for the

foreseeable -?¥;tu1'e,_ labor lead-
ers feel the chances of dis-
placed workers finding other
employment are slim. And
most experts figure the new

machines will displace ‘more’

workers than are required to
build and install them. ‘

' Hearings on the proposal be-
fore the House Ways and
Means Committee begin May
3, with many labor spokesmen
expected to testify against it.

MEANWHILE, as a result of
stepped-up legislative activity,
Congress now has completed
action on two priority Admin-
istration anti-recession - bills:
the aid to distressed areas pro-
gram and the measure to make
public assistance available to
dependent children of unem-
ployed parents.

Additionally, the Senate ap-
proved the Administration ver-
sion of minimum wage legis-
lation and the House passed a
modest Social Security bill.
Other measures showing prog-
ress were housing, higher tax-

A Senate - House "conference

TO BE resolved, as the major
issue, is how far coverage will
be extended. The House bill, a
conservative coalition substi-

tute, is practically a dead-end‘

on expanded coverage. The
Senate bill would raise the

minimum wage in steps to‘

$1.25 for those“ presently cov-
ered and bring some 4.1 mil-
lion workers, mostly service
employees, under the Act. It
appears that the final outcome
will serve as another test of
the Administration’s perform-
ance..

the House April 20, now shifts

- Removal of unrealistic re.-
strictions on U.S. exports of
metals and metal products.

NOTING that copper, lead,
zinc and brass face special
problems because they operate
in the context of international
markets and trade flows
s t r o n g l y affecting domestic

production and employment, 

the resolution emphasized that

special industry ' programs are ‘
required to stimulate recovery.

in these metals. -
In a new dual approach to

copper, ‘lead andzinc, the pro- — -0

gram called for:

1. Abolition of the lead-zinc
import quotas which have
been in effect since 1958. This
quota system “has been a fail-
ure,” the resolution declared.

The quotas were assailed 2 ~
- for not having been sufficient-’ 
ly restrictive of heavy im- ‘
ports from low-wage areas, for] .
failing to bring about any “j
significant revival of domestic -
mining, for having served to’

curtail production at many

smelters unable to fill their ,

ore requirements from domes-‘
tic sources, and for failing to
give preferential treatment, as
proposed by Mine-Mill, to im-
ports from countrieswith ade-

V quate wage standards. L L
2. Federal subsidies for new-' 0

ly mined domestic copper, lead
and zinc.

These subsidies would oper- '
-ate to guarantee to mine pro-
ducers a return equivalent to

27% cents per pound on one

million tons of copper per
year, 15 cents per pound‘ on ’

350,000 tons of lead, and 14
cents per pound on 550,000 tons
of zinc. The amount of subsidy
available to any one company

would be limited, based on re-T,’

cent production.
The union maintains that
this dual approach should in-

crease domestic, mine produc-

tion of lead and zinc by about

100,000 tons per year above re- j
cent levels, and further, in- :
crease output at smelters by 
- -removing quota limi-tations on
imports. It would also avert
I a disastrous curtailment of.
‘production and employment in -
‘copper mining such as oc- . ,
curred in 1958. V 4
