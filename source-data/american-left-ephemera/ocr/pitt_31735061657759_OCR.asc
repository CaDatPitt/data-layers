GIL GREEN

I——THE CAUSE OF ‘COMMUNISM IS THE
CAUSE OF ALL HUMANITY

HE enthusiasm and attendance at this meeting tonight

only express to a small degree the tremendous interest
shown throughout the world in the deliberations of the Sixth
World Congress of the Young Communist International. For
this Congress has signiﬁcance not alone for every young Com-
munist, not alone for every member of our world youth move-
ment, but for every young man and young woman seriously
disturbed with the present state of world aifairs—for every

young person who wants peace and guarantees for future A

security and happiness.

As an example of this sympathetic interest, let me refer to
the speech delivered a few weeks ago by Dr. Samuel Trexler,
President of the Lutheran Ministers’ Association of New
York, to the Third World Lutheran Congress in Paris. Dr.
Trexler, addressing the representatives of eighty million Luth-
erans, stated:

“The Young Communist International at its Sixth World
Congress in Moscow has just called on the youth of the world
to unite against war.

“This youthful organization, which claims to represent
3,600,000 young Communists throughout the world, has voiced
an appeal which every Christian knows he should not only echo
but should proclaim even more loudly. . . .

“What could be more.C'hristian than a call to end this traﬂic
in death—even when the ca-ll is uttered by those who style
themselves atheists.”

These remarks are of great importance. They indicate that
the policies of the Young Communist International have a
direct inﬂuence upon the deliberations and actions of the most
inﬂuential organizations in the world today. They indicate that
the policies of the Young Communist International have a
power of attraction for millions and the leaders of millions.
They indicate that the policies of the Young Communist In-
ternational correspond not only to the interests of the Com-
munist youth, not only to the interests of the working class
youth, but to the best interests of the young people of all sec-
tions of society. They indicate that the policy of the Young
Communist International is truly a people’s policy, universal
in scope, irresistible in strength. ‘

Unite for the Sake of Humanity!

Dr. Trexler is certainly not a Communist or a Communist
sympathizer. But he is ready to unite with the Communists
because he understands the tremendous danger of war and
fascism confronting the young generation and all of human-
ity. We can assure Dr. Trexler that our Sixth World Con-
gress spoke for the unity of the young generation not out of
narrow, sectional interests. It realized that what is at stake is
the very existence of humanity, the preservation and continua-
tion of human culture and the further progress of the human
race.

And from this platform we heartily greet the position of
Dr. Trexler. We say to him: Yes, Doctor, we are more than
prepared to cooperate with you and all other progressive indi-
viduals and organizations to defeat reaction, fascism and war.

And if many individuals and groups. are beginning to think
in the same vein as this Lutheran minister, it is due to two

10

 

 

important reasons. First, because it is becoming increasingly

‘clear that the main bulwark in the world today supporting

peace, culture and progress is the Sdviet Union. No longer
can anyone convince intelligent people that Communists stand
for chaos and destruction. On the contrary, they see that it is
capitalism which in its decaying stage is trying to destroy the
last vestiges of the democratic rights won by the people in
centuries of struggle, is instituting the open, brutal, and bar-
baric; dictatorship of the most reactionary sections of ﬁnance
capital—fascism. Fascism is destroying with ﬁre the accumu-
lated culture of the ages and is plunging the world into
another gigantic blood-fest.

More and more, the people begin to see that it is capitalism
which stands for chaos and destruction, that it is capitalism
which cannot exist without continual orgies of destruction and
chaos such as the last World War and the new world war
which is even now being prepared.

It is the Soviet Union, under Communist leadership, which
is the most consistent force for peace. It is the Soviet Union
with its socialist economy which is developing the productive
forces of the country at unprecedented speed; is raising the
material and cultural level of the people; and is creating a
real, true democracy for all the toilets of hand and brain. It
is because of the tremendous object lesson of the Soviet Union
that the closing speaker at the Illinois “Christian Youth Build-
ing a New World” Conference, held the other day in Spring-
ﬁeld, uttered the following signiﬁcant words:

“Communists are people who have a beautiful vision of what
this world should really ‘be, of making this world what our
7 forefathers intended it to be.”
i The second reason for such developments as I have outlined

1'1

is that ever larger masses of toilets see in the Communist Inter-
national and the Young Communist International the only
stubborn and consistent forces ﬁghting in defense of their
daily needs, for proletarian internationalism, for peace and
socialism.

Heroes and Leaders of the People

In 1914, when the world was thrown into the mire of
imperialist slaughter, when the majority of the Socialist Par-
ties betrayed the working class and the people, widespread
pessimism and confusion reigned in the ranks of the workers.
It was then that the voice of one man electrified the world,
gave renewed courage and conﬁdence to the war-ridden masses.
That man was Karl Liebknec/7t.

In 1933, the world was shocked by the temporary victory
of fascism in Germany. A spirit of pessimism and hopelessness
penetrated certain sections of the masses, especially those who
under Socialist leadership had believed in the peaceful transi-
tion of capitalism to socialism. In this situation the voice of
another man was heard, the clear Bols/nevi/Q voice of our own
dear Georgi Dimitroff.

From the dock of the hangmen’s court in Leipzig, Dimitrolf
tore the veil of demagogy from fascism and exposed it in all
its ugly nakedness. Fascism itself was placed in the dock and
was found guilty in the eyes of the masses of the world!
Dimitroff created new spirit and conﬁdence among the masses
of toilers, gave new hope and courage to the thousands of
victims of fascist terror, and an unshaken conviction that the
day of reckoning could not be far away, that Communism
would triumph the world over. ‘

In 1914, there was still another man. A man who foresaw

12

 

 

the course of history, who had created a Party with an iron
will, a Party of tried and true revolutionists, a Party which led
the masses of one-sixth of the world to victory. That man was
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the founder of the world party of
Communism. _

Today, there is also a man to be compared with the great
Lenin. This man embodies in his own life the struggles of the
masses against terror and oppression, who himself spent years
of his life in tsarist dungeons and exile. This man is none
other than our beloved leader Joseph Stalin.

For twelve years now since the death of Lenin, Comrade
Stalin has stood at the head of those who guided our socialist
fatherland from success to success, from weakness to strength,
from the temporary retreat of the New Economic Policy to
the ﬁnal irrevocable victory of socialism. For twelve years now,
since the death of Lenin, Comrade Stalin has stood at the head
of those who have guided the embattled legions of the prole-
tariat of all countries in their relentless march forward to the
socialist revolution.

Stalin and Dimitroﬁ‘. These two names symbolize the aspira-
tions and strivings of the masses the world over and point the
way to the bright sun of a socialist tomorrow.

Fight for Peace

This spirit of sacrifice, of devotion to the greatest ideals of
mankind, permeated the Sixth Congress of the Young Com-
munist International. Every one of us present felt deeply the
great responsibilities resting upon our shoulders, the great
tasks confronting us. During the very sessions of the Congress
the shot of a new war was echoed throughout the world. Ital-
ian fascism had begun its war of aggression against the people
of Ethiopia.

13

War still rages in Ethiopia. The words of our Congress on
this situation thus assume today even greater significance.

Our congress emphasized the need for unifying every pos-
sible force, for utilizing every possible factor, in order to hin-
der and stop the war. First, it emphasized the need for the
uniﬁed actions of the peace loving masses and above all of
labor. If the workers guaranteed that not a single ship, not a
single train, should move with material for fascist Italy, would
this not stop the robber hordes of Mussolini? And in turn,
would this not become an effective brake on fascist Germany
and ]apan—the two other main instigators of war in the world
today?

Second, through the united actions of the masses it is neces-
sary to compel the various capitalist governments to apply
effective embargoes on all trade and loans to Italy.

Some people declare that such government sanctions mean
world war. They say the workers should not support sanctions
as this means supporting the policy of Great Britain and its
imperialist interests. We say no! If the masses compel their
governments to apply collective sanctions, it is not to support
the interests of Great Britain or any other imperialist power,
but to maintain peace. Only such pressure from the masses can
keep Great Britain and the other imperialist powers from arriv-
ing at a robbers’ agreement with Mussolini at the expense of
the Ethiopian people and the people of the world.

Can we support the Roosevelt policy of so-called neutrality?
To do so means to permit the unhindered continuation of the
war against the Ethiopian people. Neutrality will not keep
America out of the war. Let us remember what happened in
1917. It was this same slogan that brought us into the last war.
For neutrality in the present world situation is an illusion. Is
not oil, cotton and steel being shipped daily to Mussolini from

14

 

 

 

 

American ports? Are not loans being negotiated in Wall
Street? Is it not true that Wall Street has already more than
$400,000,000 in private loans alone, tied up in Italy?

What does this mean? It means that we have neutrality only
in words. It means that unless the masses insist on an effective
embargo on all loans and trade to Italy, the American capitalist
class if only to protect its existing investments, will continue
to give economic and ﬁnancial aid to the Italian war machine.

Unity of the Young Generation

Basing itself on the ﬁndings of the Seventh Congress of the
Communist International, the Young Communist Interna-
tional Congress realized that only the uniﬁcation of the ranks
of youth behind the working class could defeat growing reac-
tion and the danger of world war. It is for this reason that
the main question discussed at the Sixth Congress was the
problem of the uniﬁcation of the vast majority of the young
generation and all progressive forces to beat back the fascist
monster and its twin brother, war.

The imperative need for unity was expressed by the dele-
gates coming from every section of the world on the basis of
their own experiences. At our Congress there were present
approximately three hundred delegates representing ﬁfty-three
countries. For most of these delegates the problem of attending
the Congress was quite a different story than for those of us
who came from the United States. Most of the delegates
came from lands in which their youth organizations were ille-
gal, where fascist or colonial terror raged. A few delegates
never arrived at the Congress, even paying with their lives
for their desire to participate in this historic gathering. The
majority of the delegates had served long prison terms in

15

dungeons and concentrations camps. On their own bodies they
bore evidence of their loyalty and devotion to the cause of
toiling humanity.

It was the delegates from the countries of fascist terror who
elaborated on the words of Comrade Dimitroﬁ at the Seventh
Congress of the Comintern. They pointed out that in the
countries of bourgeois democracy we must not underestimate
the danger of fascism. They made clear as a result of their
own experiences the fact that fascist rule was not merely the
change of government parties in a bourgeois cabinet. It was
a different form of bourgeois rule. It meant the brutal sup-
pression of every limited right previously won by the toilets,
their right to free speech, their right of assembly and the
press. It meant the physical destruction of the best sons of
the working class and the people. In short it meant the open
terrorist dictatorship of ﬁnance capital.

Socialist Delegation at Congress

For the first time in the history of the Young Communist
International, a Socialist delegation was present at the Con-
gress. The Young Sociatlist League of Spain sent ﬁve frater-
nal delegates. They greeted the Congress, expressed their
agreement with the resolutions before it and their conviction
that before many months were over the Socialist and Commu-
nist youth in Spain would merge into one uniﬁed class struggle
youth organization.

The delegations from a number of countries spoke of their
practical experiences in establishing united action. In France,
in Spain, in Austria, in Latvia, and in other countries, unity
had been established with the Socialist youth and this in turn
had proved of great aid for the struggle against fascism and

16

 

 

war. In France the unity between the young Socialists and
young Communists proved to be the beginning of the crea-
tion of, as broad front of _t_he.__.young~generation, part of the
mighty‘people’s front of the French masses. C

' It became the task of the Young Communist International
Congress to assimilate these experiences in the struggle for
unity, and to work out the means by which to hasten this
process. The slogan of the Congress became: Everything to
save the youth from fascism and the danger of imperialist
war.’ Everything to win a free and happy life for the youth!

II—-UNITE THE YOUNG GENERATION

ITH this introduction, let us go over to an examination

‘of the decisions of the Congress, why they were made,
and how they can be fulﬁlled. In my report, because of time
limitation, I cannot possibly go into all of the questions dis-
cussed at the Congress and their concrete implications for
the youth of the United States. I shall concentrate on only the
most important decisions——the links which must be grasped in
order to understand the main line of the Congress. '

These are in essence two:

First, the question of establishing the collaboration and co-
operation of all non-fascist youth organizations, of all pro-
gressive youth, in behalf of a common minimum program.
This was referred to as the “front of the young generation”.

Second, the reconstruction of our Young Communist
League and its uniﬁcation with all other youth who stand on
a working class program for socialism, into one united youth
organization. This was referred to as the task of building a
broad “non-party youth league”.

Let us take the first of these questions.

The Congress made a thorough analysis of the situation of
the youth in the capitalist world. It found that as a result of
the general decline of capitalism and the recent years of eco-
nomic crisis and depression, the vast majority of the younger
generation are growing to manhood and womanhood without
prospect for future security and happiness. Capitalism can no
longer offer even the limited opportunities of the past, not
alone to the working class youth, but to increasingly larger

18

 

sections of youth from the ranks of the farming population
and the city middle classes. a

The Plight‘ of the Young Generation

Is this not the case in the United States? Is it not true that
in this country approximately seven million youth are jobless
and that a large portion of these have never had the oppor-
tunity to work?" For the young generation of the United
States, a generation which entered conscious life in the period
since 1929, the old American dream of opportunity and equal-
ity is shattered. It grows to manhood and womanhood an
unwanted generation, a‘ surplus generation.

At the beginning of the crisis, the Hoover regime told the
youth to continue their studies and enter the professions. But
in recent years this was no longer seriously considered as a
remedy by anyone. Government economy closes more and more
schools, and hundreds of thousands of graduate professionals
of every variety pour out of the higher institutions of learn-
ing to find themselves unwanted.

As for the Negro youth who at all times faced worse con-
ditions, were discriminated against in every walk of life, faced
lynch terror and oppression, the last four years have meant
the closing of even those few opportunities for decent liveli-
hood which existed in the past. The farm youth are being
crushed by the burden of debts of their parents, by the gov-
ernment crop reduction program and by the arbitrary price
rates established by the monopolies and banks.

‘ The sharp contrast between the old expectations built up in
the minds of American youth by past progress, by the tremen-
dous derelopment of productive forces, and present reality,
places the question of the young" generation of the United
States in greater magnitude than in any other country.

19

 

The young generation knows that America is the wealthiest
land in the world; it knows that its industries and natural
resources can provide abundantly for all; it knows that Amer-
ica is not a subject nation drained of its wealth by some foreign
foe; it knows that there is no sane reason why factories should
stand idle, why wheat, fruit and cattle should be destroyed
while people are denied the necessaries of life.

Thus old values are being destroyed. Youth are dazed by
the contrast between aspirations and reality. They are groping
for a solution, they are losing conﬁdence in old institutions,
old morals and old teachings. They do not yet understand the
need for overthrowing the existing social order, but have in-
creasing doubts as to whether capitalism can solve their plight,
can overcome the crisis. T

For All the Rights of the Young Generation!
For Peace and Freedom!

It is for this reason that the Young Communist Interna-
tional Congress called upon the youth of the world to build
a front of the young generation in defense of their democratic,
economic and cultural rights, for peace and freedom.

Such a front of the young generation is necessary for two
reasons.

First, because the problems of the masses of youth are
inter-related, in fact, inseparable, and for that reason can only
be solved through common united action.

Second, because the fascists are attempting to utilize the
discontent of the youth, their disillusionment in old institu-
tions and ideals and their lack of experience, for their own
reactionary ends. In Germany and in other European coun-
tries, the fascists by demagogically utilizing the plight of

20

 

 

youth, by shamefully appealing. to their .vanity,r by distorting
their natural love for the land of their birth into a reactionary
national and ‘racial hatred, have won large sections of the

young generation for fascism and war.

. The fascists speak in the name of the young generation in
order to blur the class divisions in society, in order to place
the younger generation in opposition to the older generation.
We speak in the name of the young generation in order to
win the youth for common united action in behalf of their
most burning needs, in order to make them more conscious of
the main division in'society—the division between the wealthy
and the exploited, the rich and the poor, the haves and the
have-nots. We wish to make the youth conscious of the fact
that at the head of all the toilers stands the working’ class to
which all progressive forces must ally themselves in the inter-
ests not alone of the working class but of all toiling humanity.

In the United States the beginning of such a front of the
young generation is to be seen in the existence for the past
year and a half of the American Youth Congress. The
American Youth Congress unites in its ranks not only the
organizations of working class youth, but also those of the
youth of the middle classes. It attempts to unite the vast
majority of the young generation in defense of peace, against
reaction, and for all of their most urgent needs. The Young
Communist League will continue to support and help extend
and broaden the American Youth Congress. It will help to
make this movement the medium through which all non-
fascist youth organizations and youth can collaborate in behalf
_of a progressive minimum program.

21

 

Collaboration of N on-Fascist Organizations

Why is it so important to establish the collaboration of all
the non-fascist youth organizations of the United States? Be-
cause the experiences of Europe teach us that as the fascist
menace spreads, it attempts to coordinate and convert the
existing mass organizations of youth from non-fascist into
fascist organizations. This happened in Germany and Italy.
We must be fully aware of this danger and learn how to com-
bat it from the very beginning in order to make impossible
this same development in the United States.

First, let us become clear as to what we mean by non-
fascist youth organizations. In the United States this term
refers to nearly all of the large youth organizations. These
organizations (the Y’s, Settlement Houses and church youth
organizations) although under bourgeois inﬂuence, cannot
certainly be called fascist.

These organizations, for generations, have been most reli-
able instruments of the ruling class in inﬂuencing the growing
generation. In the period of rising capitalism, it was possible
for the capitalist class to maintain its inﬂuence over the youth
in these organizations without directly tying them to its politi-
cal parties or to the state. These organizations, each in its own
way, worked to imbue the youth with the illusion of Ameri-
can exceptionalism, of American opportunity and equality.

In past years these illusions were of the greatest value to
the capitalists in maintaining the continued allegiance of the
youth to the old order of things. Today, however, these illu-
sions are not helpful to the capitalists. They are dangerous.
The youth of America were taught well the lessons of equal-
ity, of opportunity, the chance to get ahead, to make way in
the world, to rise from oflice boy to President. Today they

22

 

 

 

insist on the right to these things; they insist on the trans-
formation of these carefully fostered dreams and illusions into
reality.

The impossibility of satisfying these demands of the youth
by the capitalists has brought about the desire for change, for
struggle. This desire has penetrated deeply into these organ-
izations.

In many instances these organizations have become the cen-
ters of the discontent and ferment of the youth. The youth
demand more basic explanations to their questions, organize
conferences and discussions, adopt militant resolutions and
programs, and, as in the case of the Methodist Youth Con-
vention, adopt an open progressive platform.

Reactionaries Threaten Organizations With Destruction

It thus becomes necessary for the capitalists to bring these
organizations once more into line, to endeavor to centralize
them under one uniﬁed leadership, to replace old worn-out
slogans with new ones corresponding to the new conditions.
These new slogans aim to reconcile youth to a declining capi-
talism—to lower standards of living and mass poverty. It is
expressed in the formation of the C.C.C. camps with their
short but meaningful phrase: “We can take it.”

It was expressed by attempts of Viola Ilma to centralize the
organizations of youth behind a reactionary program. It was
expressed by the attempts of the National Youth Adminis-
tration to tie all large youth organizations directly to the
Washington administration.

This is especially the meaning of the latest attack opened
by Hearst and other reactionaries against the Methodist youth
and the Y’s for their participation in the student peace actions

23

 

of November 8. Mr. Hearst in a. screaming eight-column edi-
torial warns these organizations in the following words:

"These two great organizations are accustomed to appeal to
the American public for aid in carrying on their religious and
social welfare work.

“The American people have responded generously and gen-
uinely to these appeals.

“But Americans will not continue to give their support to any
groups who give aid and comfort to the enemies of religion and
to the subverters of the republic.”

These are surely the words of a man driven to desperation!

Mr. Hearst thinks he can buy oil the conscience and the
ideals of the members of these organizations in the same way
that he buys off the conscience and the ideals of his prostitute
editors. Unable to convince the young people in these organ-
izations why they should not collaborate with the Communists
in the ﬁght for peace, Mr. Hearst tries to blackjack them
into submission.

The Youth of America Will Answer Fascists

We are sure that the young people in the Methodist and
Y organizations will give a ﬁtting reply to this fascist and
warmonger:

“You threaten our organizations with destruction unless we do
as you say. Don’t try to fool us, Mr. Hearst! We know that
-the exact opposite is true. To do as you say is the surest road to
destruction. It is not the Communists who are our enemies-
but war and fascism! By following you we will guarantee our
destruction. By collaborating with the Communists we will de-
fend ourselves and our organizations.”

24

 

 

This is how the youth of America will answer this despic-
able threat of the fascist Hearst. '

At the same time a drive is being conducted for the removal
of all liberal and progressive elements from the leadership of
these organizations. Everyone who speaks for labor, who
speaks against fascism and war, is branded as a Communist

and is threatened with removal. As the members and leaders

of these large youth organizations resist this attempt to intimi-
date them, the reactionaries will endeavor to liquidate whole
organizations or sections of organizations. This is how it was
done in Europe. This is how they will attempt to do it in
the United States.

It is for this reason that collaboration with these organiza-
tions becomes absolutely necessary in order to keep them as
non-fascist organizations and in order to help them become
true democratic, progressive organizations of youth,» led by the
youth. It is for this reason that we stand unequivocally for
the complete independence of these organizations from the
state or separate political parties.

A We declare openly that we will defend the right of these
organizations to govern themselves. and will struggle against
any attempt on the part of the reactionaries to infringe in the
slightest manner on the democratic rights of these organiza-
tions and their members.

At this moment an issue of great importance around which
it is possible to rally all non-fascist youth and their organiza-
tions is the question of the 1936 Olympics. The people of the
United States stand unalterably opposed to the holding of
these games in fascist Germany. Their will must be fulﬁlled!
The games must not be held in Hitler’ Germany, but must be
transferredto some non-fascist land.

25

 

III-—UNITED NON-PARTY YOUTH
LEAGUES

NOW let us come to the second question.

Our world congress called for the establishment in all
capitalist countries of broad non-party working class youth or-
ganizations uniting in their ranks Communist, Socialist and
non-party youth standing on a program for socialism. Such
leagues, stated the congress, should construct their work so as
to answer the desires and requirements of the youth them-
selves. They should, in the course of organizing, ﬁghting and
studying for the vital interests of the working class and toiling
youth, educate themselves on the basis of Marxism-Leninism
—in the spirit of intemationalism and revolutionary socialism.

Why are such leagues necessary? Because in the past years
of economic crisis and depression, tens of thousands of new
youth have begun to understand the class nature of present-
day society and the need for a fundamental reconstruction of
the entire social framework—the abolition of capitalism and its
replacement by a society in which production will be for use
and not for proﬁt-—a socialist society.

However, these youth are not yet convinced as to how such
a society is to be established. And in their endeavor to answer
this question, they become confused by the division in the
ranks of the working class. They see two political parties
which claim to stand for socialism. They see other movements
and groups speaking in the name of the masses. They do not
know which camp to join, whom to support, whom to believe.

26

 

 

They often become discouraged at this state of affairs, lose
conﬁdence in the ability of the working. class to unite and
ﬁnally in the very possibility of working class victory over
capitalism. 4

Our Young Communist League, as it has been constituted,
has found it diﬂicult to attract the largest numbers of these
youth to its ranks. Our League in the United States has
grown consistently in past years. It has today some ten thou-
sand members in its ranks. It has far greater inﬂuence among
the youth. But notwithstanding this headway, our League is
still at best little more than a ‘Communist Party of the youth.

It is an open secret, that during the past years we have con-
stantly spoken of the need for broadening and enlarging our
League, for making it a larger organization than the Commu-
nist Party. Some progress can be recorded in this respect. Yet,
because we were based on the same structure and program as
the Party, we attracted to our ranks only those youth who to
one degree or another were already convinced that the Com-
munist Party was their party—was the party with the correct
program.

‘Why Change Is Proposed Now

Why do we propose to change the character of the Youth
League now? Was it possible to decide to build a non-party
youth organization in 1928 at the time of the Fifth Congress
of the Young Communist International? If we study the situa-
tion now and then, we will understand why it was impossible in
that period but absolutely necessary in this one.. Let us take
the situation in the United States. .

Were the wide masses of youth moving to the Left in 1928?
Were the youth in large numbers turning towards the working-

class movement, recognizing the need for the fundamental
reconstruction of society? No!

In 1928, the ranks of the youth and even the working class
as such were saturated with petty-bourgeois illusions. Youth
still had confidence in American capitalism, believed its
"prosperity” would be permanent, still believed in the old
fable about American opportunity and equality.

These views found their reflection in the ideology and poli-
cies of the trade unions, in the position of the Socialist Party,
and to a certain extent even in our own Party and League.
Those were the days of open class collaboration on the part of
the trade unions, of open reformist views on the part of the
Socialists.

To have talked of a non-party league in those days would
have been sheer nonsense. A non-party youth organization
then, because of objective conditions, would have been forced
to base itself on the youth with petty-bourgeois and reformist
illusions. Such an organization would have been in time satu-
rated with these illusions, and thus have become anti-worl<ing-
class in character.

How different is the set-up today! The youth are moving to
the Left; the years of economic crisis, the lessons of Germany
and Austria, and the danger of war and fascism, are driving
the Socialist masses and youth to an understanding of revolu-
tionary Marxism; and last but not least, we have today a
strongly developed corp of thousands of young Communists
who are a guarantee that the broader league will not become
victim to reformist or demagogic leadership, but will, on the
contrary, educate a new generation of revolutionary fighters.

When we speak of a non-party youth organization, we do
not, however, imply that this league will have no connections
or relations with the Communist Party. On the contrary, we,

28

 

 

 

the young Communists, will work constantly to establish the a
closest fraternal relations between the league and the Commu-
nist Party. We shall endeavor to convince the members of the
correctness ofthe program of our Party, but this, on the other
hand, does not mean that the league will be a youth section of
the Communist Party or under its control.

  

 

 

 

 

IV—ORGANIC UNITY WITH THE
SOCIALI.ST YOUTH

T would be folly to believe that we could have the non-Party

youth organization desired, without the Socialist youth.
This was recognized as a key question, and the Congress of
the Young Communist International went on record for the
amalgamation of the various sections of -the Socialist and
‘Communist youth organizations, and favored the creation of
one united youth international.

In the past period, we in the Young Communist League of
the United States have energetically striven to establish com-
radely relations with the Socialist youth and their organiza-
tion. These efforts have not been without success. At the
Second American Youth Congress, the Socialist and Com-
munist youth were united on nearly all questions and worked
together in close harmony. Furthermore, on the student ﬁeld
we have worked closely together and are on the eve of the
amalgamation of the two radical student organizations.

However, the national leadership of the Young Peoples
Socialist League has not accepted our many offers for unity
on the basis of a common agreement or pact. How can we
explain this, when we know by experience that the Socialist
youth understand the need for, and want to achieve, unity
with the Communist youth? The primary cause for this is
to be found in the sharp struggle raging inside the Socialist
Party. The "Old Guard” of that Party, reactionary to the
core, is the most hitter opponent of class struggle policies and
of the united front. ‘

30

 

- —-——?——-———~———-—~—~—-—————-*- —~ - — -v—\ 4"‘r -

The vast bulk of the leadership and membership of the
Socialist youth basically opposes the “Old Guard”, but the
organization as a whole has not had the courage to make
a decisive break with these open Right elements. It tends in-
stead to vacillate and to give in to the Right wing on im-
portant questions of principle such as the united front.

This situation has resulted in demoralization within the
ranks of the Socialist youth and a continuous decline in mem-
bership for the past two years. We ask the Socialist youth:
how can such a decline be explained in a period,when new

masses of youth are entering the struggle, are becoming class '

conscious, and when the Young Communist League is grow-
ing? This in the main can be explained because the Young
Peoples Socialist League does not stand on a ﬁrm class policy,
based on the united front. ’

While criticising this basic error of our Socialist comrades,
we must also say a few words about our own errors which
have made more diﬂicult the uniﬁcation of the Socialist and
Communist youth forces. Often, our comrades transfer their
justiﬁed hatred of the Oneals and Cahans, in an unjustiﬁed
manner, to the Socialist youth and their leadership. They do
not see the fact that in the United States the Socialist youth
organization does not have a bureaucracy in the sense of the
one that exists in the Socialist Party. There may be reactionary
individuals, but, as a whole, the members and cadres of the
Socialist youth entered the movement in the last years of
economic crisis, and to a certain extent reﬂect the growing
militancy and class consciousness of the youth.

Were this understood by all sections of our League, we are
quite confident that much greater headway could have been
made in establishing unity between our two organizations.

31

  

 

 

 

 

 

This is especially true of New York where the members of
the Y.P.S.L. are greatly embittered against the “Old Guard”.

Organic Unity Necessary and Possible

The question of establishing organic unity between our two
leagues becomes a question of practical signiﬁcance for us in
the United States, precisely because the Socialist youth are
breaking from the inﬂuence of the Right wing, are accepting
the principles of class struggle.

We ask: Why cannot our two organizations amalgamate
—merge into one uniﬁed organization? Would not such a
merger create tremendous enthusiasm among tens of thousands
of youth who want to struggle for socialism, but who feel
discouraged because of the split which exists in the ranks of
the class conscious youth? We are conﬁdent that it would.

Is it necessary for our youth organizations to remain sepa-
rated until organic unity is established between the Socialist
and Communist Party? We think not, because a youth organ-
ization is not a political party. It should be a broader organ-
ization. Such an organization should be independent of either
the Communist or Socialist Parties, although within its ranks
there could and undoubtedly would be individual» supporters
of both parties. We Communist youth would continue to sup-
port our Party. The Socialist youth could continue to support
their party. At the same time, the organization as such could
democratically work out its oﬂicial relations with both Parties.

Such an organization would be greatly different from either
of our present leagues. Both of our organizations are in
essence small and sectarian despite the fact that the Y.C.L.
is considerably larger and stronger than the Y.P.S.L. Organic
unity could mean the broadening out of all our forms and

32

 

 

 

methods of work, so as to apply to the growing needs of the
moment, to the growing desire of the youth for unity and
struggle.

To those youth who remain skeptical as to the possibility
of organic unity, we answer -that we shall in the course of
daily work prove not only its feasibility, but its necessity. We
shall energetically work for the completion of the amalgama-
tion in the student ﬁeld. When that is accomplished, we shall
tirelessly work to help build this united student organization,
to work harmoniously with the Socialist youth within it and
thus give a decisive answer to those who doubt our sincerity.

Furthermore, we state that even without a written pact
between our two leagues, we shall work to develop comradely
relations with the Socialist youth and their organization in
every ﬁeld of work. We shall support every demand or pro-
posal put forth by the Socialist youth, which corresponds with
the interests of ‘the masses. We shall decisively prove that our
desire for unity ﬂows from our deep understanding that only
the healing of thebreak in the ranks of the working class
can defeat fascism, can lead to the ﬁnal victory of the social
revolution.

33

  

 

 

V. IMMEDIATE STEPS IN BROADENING
‘ THE LEAGUE

HILE we shall work patiently and consistently to estab-

lish organic unity, we shall not wait until this is accom-
plished before we take practical measures to broaden our
"League and change its character.

This task cannot wait and should be begun at once. How
are we to proceed along this line?

First, we should gradually broaden the structure and life of
our present units so that they correspond more to the needs of
the youth. Instead of small units of ﬁve and’ ten members,
these should be broadened wherever possible into branches or
units consisting of as many as ﬁfty or more youth. For only in
such larger groups can youth develop the necessary educa-
tional, cultural and social life. Youth like to mingle with
other youth and we should not endeavor to restrict them to
small isolated groups.

Our League should admit into its ranks any youth who
want to learn and work for a socialist society, who sincerely
show their desire to build the organization. These should be
admitted even if they are not Communists or have certain
disagreements with Communism.

This, of course, means that we should further develop the
democratic character of our League. The membership should
have the right to determine the nature and character of the
work of their branch and of the organization as a whole. The
education of the membership should be‘carried out by methods

34

 

of conviction and example-—not by compulsion. The demands
on the individual members of the organization, and particu-
larly on new members, should correspond to the mass character
of the youth organization and not be the same as those applied
to Party members.

Of course, in the period of the last years we have trained
thousands of our League members in the spirit of loyalty and
devotion to the Communist Party. They are ready to work as
disciplined Communists. Is this bad? Do we intend to ask
them to give this up? Of course not! It is precisely these con-
vinced Communists who must work among the non-party
youth in such a way as to educate them and raise high the
authority of our Party. From these youth we shall not ask less,
but more, discipline. But it shall not be the discipline of the
youth league, but the higher discipline of the Communist

Party.

Three Channels to United League

We know, however, that there will be many youth who will
say: the idea of a non-party youth organization is good. We
would gladly join and build such an organization. But what
guarantees have we that you really mean what you say—that
this is not some trick to get us into a Communist organization
under false pretenses?

To these youth we answer: we understand your fears. For
that reason if you are not ready to join the branches or units
of the Young Communist League, we encourage you to get
your friends together and organize a club of your own. Build
your club on a working class program, utilize it to educate and
train the youth in_ the class struggle, and we shall encourage
and support you. ll

35

 

In neighborhoods and shops where youth are not ready to
join the Y.C.L., we should help them build clubs and organiza-
tions in accordance with their own desires -on a working class
program. Where such clubs can immediately assume mass pro-
portions, the Y.C.L. unit can work within it to build it up, to
educate its membership, and gradually to make the club into
the organizational expression of the new form of youth league
in that territory or factory.

If throughout the country we can broaden and enlarge our
Y.C.L., if around our Y.C.L. we can build hundreds of youth
clubs and organizations of a non-party character, if at the
same time we can improve our relations with the young Social-
ists and gradually convince them of the need for organic unity,
then, in the near future, these three channels will merge into
one mighty stream. We will then in each locality and later on
a regional and national scale proceed to bring these working
class youth organizations together into one organization based
on a program for socialism.

This is how we conceive of the establishment of this non-
party youth league.

A Warning

I want to take this opportunity to strongly warn against any
attempts to work out a blue-print for this process of transfor-
mation. First, because these changes will be impossible without
the collective help of thousands of youth. This means first of
all your help. We want every member and sympathizer of our
League to become an active worker for this line. This means
we do not want a formal acceptance of what has been said
here. That will never do. We want a real live discussion to
penetrate our League and the ranks of youth around it.

36 ‘

 

 

 

We want every doubt, every question, to be aired in the
open. We do not want any members to accept the proposals as
a matter of duty. Their first duty is to understand the pro-
posals, otherwise they will never be able to apply them. So.
conﬁdent are we of the strength of our position, that we do not
fear criticism and know that through it our line will emerge
all the stronger.

In order to help develop this discussion, the meeting tonight
is only a beginning. We are opening the columns of the Young
Worker to any youth, regardless of whether he is a Young
Communist Leaguer or not, who cares to make a serious con-
tribution on the Sixth World Congress decisions. We promise
to print all articles if they are serious, short and concise. Of
course, we also take for ourselves the right to criticize any
points we may disagree with.

I was lucky enough to be present in the Soviet Union during
the rise of a new popular movement called the Stakhanov
movement. Stakhanov is a miner in the Don Basin who so
mastered the technique of using the pneumatic drill, that by a
redivision in the process of labor in his section of the mine, was
able to increase his production by ﬁve and six times. His story
was told throughout the length and breadth of the land. The
movement spread like wildﬁre and today there are thousands
of Stakhanovs who often over the heads of their old-fashioned
engineers and officials carry through Stalin’s slogan “master
technique”.

We Need American Stakbanovs

Why am I telling you about the Stakhanov movement?
Because, it seems to me that this is what we need. in our
League. We need initiative from below, we need new ideas,

new forms of work, new types of organizers and leaders. In
other words, we need Stakhanovs in our youth movement who
will begin to build as we have never built before. I have conﬁ-
dence that through the widest discussion, through the utiliza-
tion of all sorts of new forms, thousands of young organizers
and leaders we have not seen before will spring forward. These
are the people around whom the change must be made. Are
you going to be one of them?

And because we propose to broaden our League, there are
some people who are afraid this means liquidation. Allay your
fears, comrades. We are going to liquidate nothing——but our
shortcomings. And who can have reasonable objection to that?
We propose to work so well that by January, 1937, we want
a youth league in this country with a minimum of 50,000
members. It can and will be done!

Calamity-Ianes

There are others who are typical calamity-janes. All they see
are the dangers in trying something new. They remind me of
the girl who was afraidto get married because she’d never
been married before. Of course, there are diﬂiculties. But we
cannot fear difficulties, we must overcome them——that is why
we are revolutionists. There are dangers in everything, but the
greatest danger at the moment is to keep our League a small
narrow organization, to continue to keep the ranks of the class-
conscious youth divided, and to fail to take the opportunity
of drawing tens of thousands of new youth into the class
struggle.

Then there are some people outside our ranks who fear for
our Communist purity. For years they have fought out Party
and League. For years they have fought Leninism. Now sud-

denly they become its so-called defenders. Thank you, kind
sirs, we need not your defense. Leninism has become too much
a part of our ﬂesh and blood to be given up. No! The trouble
is that you never understood Leninism and don’t understand it
now. Lenin never taught us to remain sects. He always taught
us to find the path to the masses, not fearing to utilize new
tactics under new conditions. He never tired repeating that
Marxism is not a dogma, but a guide to action.

Leadership of Struggles and Work Among Factory,
‘ Union and Negro Youth

Some people have already asked the question: does this
change imply the weakening of our work in the shops, trade
unions, among the unemployed youth, the Negro youth and
mass organizations? Not at all. First of all, because those of
us who are Communists shall continue to work as Com-
munists, shall improve our work in these places and further-
more shall constantly work in the youth league to educate the
other youth as to the need for following our example. How-
ever, this basic work will improve not by using methods of
compulsion, but through our ability to educate and convince
the membership of its importance.

Improved work in the shops and trade unions is absolutely
necessary if we are to unite the working youth in the elemen-
tary organizations of their class——the trade unio-ns. We shall
encourage a wide campaign for the organization of the unor-
ganized young workers, and shall give active support to those
unions which attempt this. We shall conduct mass education
among the youth as to the importance of trade union organ-
ization and help them formulate their own economic demands

as well as train them for leadership of the economic struggles
and in the trade unions.

This line also implies a further development and extension
of our struggle for Negro rights. The broadening of our
League will not mean the toleration of white chauvinism in
our ranks. On the contrary, this very broadening of the
League makes necessary an improvement in our struggle for
Negro rights, and the development of extensive education
among our own members and the masses of youth on the
Negro question. It is of great importance at the moment to
intensify the movement for the defense of the nine Scottsboro
boys, and for that young American hero and member of the
National Committee of the Young Communist League, An-
gelo Herndon. We shall not rest a single day until our Angelo
Herndon is free again.

Some comrades also ask the question: does this mean that
we shall no longer take part in struggle? Of course, we shall
and to a far greater extent than to-day. It is inconceivable that
we should attempt to go about the task of educating the youth
in a Marxist-Leninist spirit without struggle. The League will
engage actively in all the struggles of the working class. The
only modiﬁcation we are introducing in this respect is that the
League shall not be an organization which lives by bare pol-
itics, by pure struggle. It must also react to the educational,
social and cultural requirements of the youth in o-rder all the
better to draw them into the struggle.

VI—-GENERATION OF SOCIALIST YOUTH

T is impossible to discuss the questions of policy for the

youth of America without describing the remarkable ad-
vances made by the youth of the Soviet Union in the construc-
tion of socialism. It is these changes, these advances which
hearten us and steel us for the mighty work that confronts us
in the United States.

Only a few days ago all the newspapers were «full of ac-
counts of how the department stores of Moscow were literally
beseiged by workers buying food, clothes, books and other
articles. The factories are beginning to pour out a steady
supply of everything that the Soviet workers and farmers need.
Wages are rising, hours are being shortened. Life is beautiful
and joyous to the Soviet worker!

What a contrast with newspaper stories which appeared a
few days later to the effect that thousands of workers had
their clothes torn and bodies bruised and trampled as they
stormed the W.P.A. offices in New York to get their relief
and food orders.

Life in the Soviet Union is joyous and beautiful! Advances
are being made in every ﬁeld. In the last few years, the Soviet
government built more schools than all the eighteen tsars and
tsaristas were able to establish in three centuries of the Rom-
anov dynasty. Today, it occupies first place in the entire world
for the development of higher and secondary education! And
what is even more outstanding is the fact that every student
who leaves school ﬁnds work! There are jobs waiting for all of
them in industry, agriculture and the professions. And still

43

 

 

 

more remarkable is the fact that on all these jobs wages are
steadily rising so that the young worker can really taste to the
full the fruits of socialist construction.

A New Type of Man

A new generation is growing up in the Soviet Union, a
generation which has never known capitalism, never known
exploitation, never known a boss or a strikebreaker or a scab
or a picket line. This new generation is already the advance
scout of a new type of a man, a socialist man!

It is impossible here to go into a detailed account of the
changes which have taken place among the youth of the So-
viet Union, especially in the last period of the ﬁnal and
irrevocable victory of socialism. I would merely like to read a
section of the remarkable report made by Comrade Chemo-
danov to the Sixth World Congress of the Young Communist
International:

And what a splendid generation of really new people is
arising from our children. You need but talk to them and
you see that they think, live and create in a new manner. The
so-called “eternal truths” of bourgeois morals seem incompre-
hensible and savage to their minds. Many of the things which
seem to be the most splendid dream for a child growing up in
a capitalist country are alien to them. i

I will illustrate this by two interesting exam-ples. Our well
known children’s writer, Comrade Marshak, had a talk with the
children in_the Pioneer Camps near Leningrad on the question
of the future, and among many other things, he recounts the
following:

“I asked the children, what do you want to become when
you grow up? ' t

s

44

 

 

«N» xﬁsv-r« ,~r.«~

 

I Poland would be only for the Poles.” «

“ ‘An airman!’ ‘An engineer!’ ‘An agricultural specialist like
Michurin! I want to grow apples on birch trees!’

“And which of you would like to be, let us say,-a factory
owner or landlord? I asked to draw them out.

“The children were astonished.

“ ‘But that is not interesting!’ said one.

“ ‘A ﬁne occupation that—to exploit people!’ said another.

“ ‘And -on top of that, the workers would rebel against you!’
said a third.

“No one took the question seriously. The talk went further
about the future and socialism, conceptions which are equivalent
for our children.”

The Story of the Invisible Mart

Most of you have probably read H. G. Well’s book The
Invisible Man. Not long ago there was a ﬁlm shown in America
with the same name taken from this book. It was shown in
nearly every country in Europe.

In a school in the Polish town of Vilna, one of the teachers,
under the fresh impression of this ﬁlm, sent round a question-
naire among the scholars, to which -they need not- sign their
names, containing the question, “What would you do if you
were. invisible?” He sent an article to the teachers’ magazine
Sprov Nauchtelska giving the results.

Here are some characteristic replies from the Polish children.

“I would go into a bakery where there are many pastries,
biscuits and other daintiesf? .

“I would get into a bank and break open the safe.”

“I would steal a certiﬁcate from the director and get a job
as an ofﬁcial.”

"Send out all the Jews, Russians and Ukrania-ns so that

And among the mass of such replies from the  and
.45

 

 

 

 

despairing children, there were individual ‘passionate voices
which said: "I would slice up all the bourgeoisie.” "I would
give out money to the unemployed.”

The Soviet writer, Tatiana Tess, decided to send around
a similar questionnaire among our children in the Soviet Union.
She chose the Pioneer camp of the Elelctrazovod factory of
Moscow for her experiment.

Soviet Children Reply

She obtained one hundred replies. The replies were most
varied but they were characterized in the main by the desire to
utilize “this possibility, for acting and creating. There was not
a word about riches, about money, about dainties.

Twenty of them wrote:

“If I were invisible I would set Comrade Thaelmann free.”

Ten of them wanted to get secretly into Levanevsl<y’«s airplane
and ﬂy across the North Pole to San Francisco. I

Here are other replies:

“I would go through all the prisons and tell the political
prisoners what is happening in their country and in the Soviet
Union.”

“I would help -the German Pioneers.”

“I would go into the Chinese Red Army.”

“I would get on the biggest steamer and travel around the
whole world.”

“If I were invisible, the challenge banner would undoubtedly
be in our detachment.”

“I would travel through all countries and study the life of
various nations and animals.”

. And only -three wanted to use this possibility -to go into the
pictures or the skating rink without paying.

This is only one little hit, one drop of the many-sided creative

life which our children, this wonderful growth of October, are

living. v ‘

46

 

 

Mighty and invincible is the country which has brought up
such children. Happy are the children who grow up in our
splendid country!

There is very little that I can add to this picture of the
world-shaking change which has taken place in the new gen-
eration of Socialist children now growing up in the Soviet
Union, the land where the workers and farmers rule, under
the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Comrade
Stalin. .

Revolutionary and Democratic Traditions of
American Youth

Our young generation in the United States faces profound
problems, problems such as confronted no generation of the
past. And in the solution of these problems, in our struggle
against the tyranny and oppression of this new age, we draw
upon the rich revolutionary and democratic traditions of the
people of our country.

Have not the youth of America a right to be proud of the
honorable place which their people hold in the forward move-
ment of mankind? Who else can lay claim to the heritage
of those great revolutionaries of 1776? Upon whose shoulders
should the mantle fall of Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock,
Crispus Attucks, Thomas Paine and Samuel Adams?

The spirit of ’76 which braved the harrowing misery of
Valley Forge, which stood unmoved at Bunker Hill, at Con-
cord and Lexington——this is the spirit of the American youth!
No one else can claim it!

When the American people in 1860 stood at the threshold
of a new era, they did not fail to produce the new giants of
the day, the new heroic exploits which will be remembered for

all time. To whom else does that great man of the common
people—Abraham Lincoln—belong? To whom else belong
those undaunted ﬁghters for Negro liberation—Nat Turner,
John Brown, Lloyd Garrison? To whom else was that sea of
blood at Gettysburg consecrated? Not to the Hearsts, not to
the Rockefellers, not to the Morgans, but to the youth of
America!

To them also belong the heritage of 1886; the heritage of
the Molly Maguires and of the great steel strike; the heritage
of all those martyrs for labor’s cause-—the Parsons, the Spies,
the Eugene Debs, the Saccos and Vanzettisl ‘

It is with a genuine and honest love for everything that is
progressive that the American youth have a right to be proud
of their American ingenuity, their American practicality, their
American inventiveness—those traits of our people which
reared the tallest buildings, which spanned the deepest rivers,
which tilled the wildest soil, achievements which are spoiled
and destroyed by decaying capitalism.

No one can destroy or take from us the age-long dream
of our people for a country of freedom and equality, of peace
and prosperity. This dream, brutally trampled upon by the
modern bourbons, the tories of the twentieth century, be-
comes our dream. We pledge to realize it!

Inspired by the Russian revolution and the mighty achieve-
ments of socialist construction, guided by the Communist
International, basing ourselves on the resolutions of the Sixth
World Congress of the Young Communist International, we
pledge to work to unite the young generation in the struggle
against war and fascism, against the exploitation of man by
man, for a new social order—-a socialist society.

THE TASKS OF THE UNITED FRONT OF THE
YOUTH

Resolution Adopted byithe Sixth World Congress of the Young Com-
munist International on the Report of Wolf Michal.

HE life of the young generation of toilets in the capitalist
countries has lately deteriorated to an unheard of degree,

and it still continues to worsen. The overwhelming majority.

of youth are now a ruthlessly oppressed and exploited gen-
eration. V

What characterizes at the present time the life of the large
sections of the toiling youth? '

Mass unemployment, an ever growing number of youth who
have never worked, and who generally have never had an
opportunity to learn a trade, ﬁerce exploitation of those
employed in industry, impoverishment of the rural youth,
denial of the political rights to the youth, and their right to
a cultured life, sharply curtailed possibilities of securing a
general or a special education, loss of any prospects, destruc-
tion of the normal healthy life of the youth, spreading
vagrancy, prostitution and begging.

The fascist system of forced labor and‘ militarization is
being ever more widely applied in the capitalist countries.
Fascism is brutally annihilating the best elements of the revo-
lutionary youth, and at the same time trying to utilize for its
own reactionary ends the profoundly growing dissatisfaction
of the toiling youth with the present conditions of life, and
their growing urge for militant action. I Inciting the youth

49

 

 

of one nationality against those of another, fascism fans chau-
vinism and is trying to inculcate its mad “race theory” into
the minds of the youth.

Relying on the fascists and other reactionary parties, the
big bourgeoisie are seeking to convert the young generation
into an obedient tool of their class, imperialist policies.

Fascism means war. It menaces the independence of the
weak nations (the war of Italian fascism against Ethiopia),
intensiﬁes imperialist oppression in the colonial and semi-
colonial countries, and directs its military provocations (Ger-
man fascism) especially against the Soviet Union. Fascism
is preparing another monstrous catastrophe, which brings death
to millions of the youth.

At the same time, however, there is a growing youth move-
ment against fascism, imperialist war, and capitalist exploita-
tion. Ever larger sections of the youth belonging to the
various organizations, regardless of nationality or religious
belief, are anxiously seeking a way to improve their life, are
beginning to defend their rights, and are entering the strug-
gle for their interests—for freedom and for peace.

The forces of the youth, however, are scattered, and con-
sequently their ﬁght does not lead to decisive success.’ All
experience shows that the youth cannot successfully defend
their interests without uniting their forces on the side of the
working class and the entire toiling population to fight the
common enemy, fascism and imperialism.

I. The Necessity for a Change in the Character of the
Youth Leagues

1. The cause of the toiling youth imperatively demands
their uniﬁcation in genuine class, non-party youth organiza-

50

 

 

 

tions, consisting not only of Communist, but also Socialist,
and non-party, national revolutionary, pacifist, religious, and
other sections of the youth, organizations which would,
through their daily attention towards economic, political and
cultural interests and rights of the toiling youth, educate their
members in the spirit of the class struggle, proletarian inter-
nationalism, Marxism-Leninism.

The creation of such genuine mass youth organizations of

a new type requires a radical reorganization of the Young .

Communist Leagues, and a complete abandonment of any
form of sectarian copying of the Parties.

All the vital interests of the younger generation of toilets,
the most diversiﬁed, healthy requirements of the youth, and
not abstract politics, should determine the substance and the
life of the youth organizations. The work of these organ-
izations should be adapted entirely to the desires and require-
ments of the youth themselves, so that while learning, organiz-
ing and ﬁghting for the vital interests of the toiling classes, the
youth would become educated in the spirit of the ﬁght for
freedom, for socialism, against reaction, against fascism,
against imperialist war.

2. The doors of these youth organizations must be wide
open for the entire working class youth, for the young peas-
ants, the students and other youth who sincerely and loyally
wish to participate in their work.

All the work of these organizations should be built on the
basis of wide democracy. The members of the organizations
should have full power to decide in a democratic way the

tasks-, the forms of work, and the character of their organ-

izations; they should be given guidance by means of example
and conviction, and not by orders from above. The demands
advanced by the leaders to the rank-and-ﬁle members, espe-

51



 

cially to new ones, both as regards work and discipline, should
be adapted to the mass character of the youth organizations,
and should not be the same as the demands advanced to
members of some sect. The high demands which are usually
put to Party members should not be exacted from the mem-
bers of a youth organization.

Independence and the non-party character of the youth or-
ganizations do not exclude the establishment of permanent
contact of these organizations with the revolutionary van-
guard of the proletariat, the Communist Parties. On the con-
trary, it is in the interests of the toilets that this be done.
The Congress deems it an exceedingly important task to con-
vince all members of that, and also of the necessity of the
youth international being associated with the Communist
International.

3. The organizational forms of the Youth Leagues cannot
be the same for all countries, all regions or cities. \ They must
always coincide with the concrete conditions and speciﬁc tasks
of the youth movement. The most essential form of organ-
ization of the youth leagues are all kinds of clubs and circles
satisfying the cultural, economic, professional and political
interests of the youth, and also local societies, courses, residen-
tial groups, groups of unemployed, rural youth, girls, stu-
dents, etc.

II. For Unity of the Working Class Youth.

1. In seeking to rally all the toiling youth, the Congress
considers eﬁdrts to bring about organic unity with the Young
Socialist League: to be the primary task of the Young Com-
munist Leagues. ’

This unity is justified by the fact that the Socialist youth

52 ~

 

 

 

 

also occupy an anti-fascist position and are equally interested
in improving the life of the youth, in freedom, in peace, and
in striving towards socialism.

There is not the slightest justification for a continuation of

the division in the ranks of the working class youth. The unit-
ing of these two Leagues, which at the present time are, in
most countries, small organizations, isolated from the masses,
will not only double their membership, but will render them an
extremely powerful force of attraction for the broad masses of
the toiling youth. ’

2. The chief hindrance to the direct unity of the organ-
izations of the Communist and Socialist youth comes from the
leaders of most parties of the Socialist International who act
as guardians to the Socialist youth movement, and who, bas-
ing themselves on a certain section of the leading function-
aries of the Socialist youth, try to fetter any free initiative of
their members in the matter of unity.

In order to clear the path to this unity, the Y.C.L. organ-
izations must exert every effort to establish fraternal relations
with the organizations of the Socialist youth and work espe-
cially for bringing about the united front of the youth in
practice.

The Young Communist Leagues and the Young Socialist
organizations of France, Spain and Austria showed by their
joint activity that the united front is not only necessary, but
possible. They have smashed forever the slanderous charges
made by the enemies of the united front to the effect that
unity of action is a "maneuver” directed against the Socialist
organizations. The united front is the chief weapon for
repulsing the fascist oﬁensive.

The Congress recommends all organizations affiliated to the
Y.C.I. to seek united front agreements with the Socialist youth

53

 

 

in defense of the interests of the toiling youth, working out
jointly with their organizations the basis and plan of joint
action on a local and national scale, on separate questions as
well as on the basis of common platforms. This is the best
‘method of hastening and ensuring the unification of the
youth.

In all cases it is necessary to make a ‘most careful study
and to take stock of the concrete conditions and practical
occasions for joint struggle, and also the sentiments of the
members of the Socialist organizations. In places where the
Socialist Youth Leagues put forward demands or organize
activity corresponding to the interests of the toiling youth,
the members of our organizations must give them active sup-
port and do everything to secure the granting of their
demands.

It is also necessary together with the Socialist youth to
appeal to the Socialist and Communist members of Parlia-
ment and to present demands to Social-Democratic ministers
(wherever such are in oﬂice) for the passing of laws and
decrees to improve the situation of the youth.

3. While widely developing the united front movement, it
is necessary, in the interests of the common ﬁghting, to- bring
about constant cooperation between the two Leagues through
the creation of joint associations. Taking as a starting point

the experience of the “coordination committees” in France,

and the "alliance committees” in Spain, it is necessary to set
up various anti-fascist associations of the Communist and
"Socialist Youth Leagues.

When such associations are formed, the Leagues remain
independent and may maintain their connections with their
respective parties and Internationals.

4. In a number of countries, such as France, Spain, Aus-

54

 

 

tria, Latvia, and some others, the practical prerequisites for
uniting the two Leagues into a single organization already
exist.

A necessary condition for the formation and development
of united organizations is the full democratic right of the
members themselves to settle the question of the basis of unity
(the platform of further struggle against capitalist exploita-
tion, fascism, imperialist war, for the vital interests of the
youth) as well as the connections of the united Leagues with
the parties and the question of adherence to an International.

The Young Communist International will give the most
practical help to bring about the formation of united Leagues
of the toiling youth in any country. At the same time the
Young Communist International announces its ﬁrm deter-
mination to ﬁght for the uniﬁcation of the revolutionary youth
throughout the world, for the formation of a single Youth
International.

III. Unity of the Force of the Entire Generation of
Young Toilers

1. The distressed situation of the vast majority of the
young generation and the increasing urge to struggle for
their interests raise as an urgent task the uniting of the forces
of all the noun-fascist youth organizations in a joint struggle
for freedom, peace, and the rights of the younger generation.

The Sections of the Young Communist International in
France and the U.S.A. have understood the tremendous im-
portance of this task. This is shown by their active participa-

tion in the wide united front movement of the youth which is _

taking place in these countries. The success of the movement
in these countries only became possible thanks to the fact that

55

 

. '=»“.“‘“‘,

the youth from the most varied mass organizations were drawn
into the discussion and elaboration of a common platform of
cooperation. _

There is no doubt that there exist also in many other coun-
tries extensive possibilities for the development of such a move-
ment of the younger generation. However, in some countries
(Canada, Great Britain and Switzerland), the Sections of
the Young Communist International have taken only the
first steps in this direction, while in the majority of countries
even this has not yet been done. In many countries, the
members of our Leagues do not understand the problems
arising before the younger generation and have in general
adopted a narrowly sectarian approach to the young people
in the youth organizations formed by the bourgeoisie, simply
regarding these organizations and their members as opponents.
In some cases, our Leagues have tried to force upon the
broad masses of the youth and their organizations a stereo-
typed, ready-made platform, prepared without consultation
with the youth of other organizations.

2. “The Young Communist League must strive in every
way to unite the forces of all the non-fascist mass youth or-
ganizations to the point of forming various kinds of joint
organizations for the ﬁght against fascism, against the un-
paralleled oppression and militarization of the youth, for the
economic and cultural rights of the young generation, for
drawing these young workers to the side of the anti-fascist
front, no matter where they are to be found—in the factories,
the forced labor camps, the labor exchanges, the barracks,
the navy, in schools, various sport, cultural and other organ-
izations.” (Dimitroff.)

While working with all energy and initiative to carry out
this extremely important task, it should be ﬁrmly remembered

56 ‘

 

V ,,.,,‘..,,,,,.m_-.. ,  .~.  V , .  ‘  ::.

 

 

that the platform and also the forms and methods of cooper-
ation must be worked out in the most democratic manner,
taking into consideration the cultural and political level, es-
pecially the questions of the youth of the given country, and
the burning questions which interest various sections of the
youth. Special attention should be paid in this connection to
work among the peasant youth and the students.

In the ﬁght for the uniting of the youth against reaction
and fascism, it is essential for all members of the Leagues to
eliminate completely sectarian methods of approach to the
broad sections of the youth. It is undoubtedly necessary
that they should learn to speak in the vivid language of youth,
and once and for all to give up repeating stock phrases.

It is particularly important in the ideological ﬁght against
fascism to take into account the revolutionary and demo-
cratic traditions of one’s own people, not in the slightest de-
gree adopting a contemptuous attitude to the national feel-
ings of the youth, but at the same time ﬁghting tirelessly

against chauvinism, and working to educate the youth in the

spirit of proletarian internationalism. Having in View the
democratic traditions, it is essential to protect all democratic
rights against fascism, and to ﬁght against any oppressive
measures against the youth, and for their economic, cultural
and democratic rights.

In every place where fascist demagogues put forward slo-
gans and promises which correspond to the feelings and de-
mands of the toiling youth, we must propose without hesitation
that the youth should insist on these promises being immedi-
ately carried out and must begin an independent mass strug-
gle to bring them into practice.

4. The Congress states that the Young Communist Inter-
national will give every possible support to the youth move-

ment against fascism and war in any country. The Y.C.I.
will also give active support to the movement directed towards
the organization of a world meet and the establishment of
constant international collaboration among progressive youth.

IV. The Tasks of the Mass Youth Movement in
Fascist Countries

1. The Congress sets before all the revolutionary organ-
izations of the youth which are ﬁghting in fascist countries
the task of passing from the system of small circles and gen-
eral agitation to direct legal and semi-legal mass activity. It
is not correct to imagine that there are no legal possibilities in
countries with a fascist dictatorship for the development of a
mass movement of struggle for the vital interests of the youth.

Vast numbers of the youth in-these countries have volun-
tarily or by compulsion been brought into the ‘fascist mass
youth organizations. It is possible and necessary within these
organizations to develop the wide independent activity of the
youth. A signiﬁcant part of these youth still believe in the
false ideals given them by fascism and in the fascist leaders.
But on the other hand, the bitter reality of their lives and
the fact that their needs and demands are not being satisﬁed
give rise to discontent and activity which is not yet directed
against the fascist regime, but is primarily in defense of their
direct interests and requirements.

Our task is not to issue abstract appeals for the overthrow
of the fascist dictatorship, but to be able to defend the day-
to-day demands and needs of the youth, to support and unite
them on this basis, utilizing all legal and semi-legal possibilities
and subordinating the work of the illegal organizations to
this task. It is essential for the youth themselves to be roused

s

58

 

 

 

to stubbornly demand the fulﬁlment of the promises which
fascism gave them so that they will in this way be led to a real
ﬁght against fascism.

2. All the mass forms and measures of fascist work among
the youth must be made use of with the aim of rallying the
forces of the youth to the struggle for their interests, and
this makes it necessary to begin suitable form: of work in all
the fascist youth mass organization: and also in the trade
unidns, in every way supporting and encouraging opposition
sentiment among the members of these organizations, seeking
to isolate the conscious agents of fascism.

Wherever there is oppositional sentiment in democratic, lib-
eral and radical youth circles and groups, as in Poland, _]ugo-
slavia, Bulgaria, Austria, etc., it is necessary to work for the
establishment of youth organizations absolutely independent
of fascism, and for united action with them.

Wherever fascism prohibits and suppresses the non-fascist
youth organizations, our first task is to give friendly support
to their struggle, for the freedom and independence of their
organizations. It is at the same time necessary to work to-
gether with them for the amalgamation of all forces of the
youth.

V. The Task: of the Youth in the Trade Union Movement

The Congress of the Young Communist International notes
with alarm that only an insigniﬁcant section of the working
youth are organized in trade unions and that the rising
young generation of toilers is not being educated and steeled
in the ranks of the trade union movement, in the spirit of
militant class solidarity and devotion to the cause of the work-
ing class.

59

Yet the ﬁght for the economic and cultural interests of
the youth, and also the ﬁght against the spreading of fascist
inﬂuence among the youth, cannot be successful without the
aid of the trade unions. This is precisely why it is necessary
to work for the organization of all young workers in the trade
unions, and the arrangement of diverse forms of work among
the large sections of the youth inside the trade unions.

The Congress calls upon all young workers who support
the Young Communist I nterndtional to join the unions, to
take active part in the work and to ﬁght for trade union unity,
to win by their good work the respect of their fellow trade

union members. Considering the fact to be important that in

some countries, as in Austria and Belgium, for example, some
unions have begun to organize the young workers, the Con-
gress urgently recommends to all Sections of _the Young Com-
munist International actively to support any propaganda and
organizational steps not only of the Red, but also of the
Amsterdam and other unions, to recruit the young workers.
It is exceedingly important to work with the trade unions
for gaining work, and for social insurance, for the young un-
employed. It is essential to work for concrete aid for the un-
employed youth and especially for the girls, by organizing all
kinds of vocational courses, lodgings, night shelters, special

workshops, and clubs for girls. Work among the youth in’

thevarious kinds of labor camps is of particular importance
at the present time.

VI. The Tasks of the United‘ Front in the Sport Movement

The Congress emphasizes the importance of developing a
sport movement of the youth, independent of the bourgeois
state, and calls upon the Sections of the Young Communist

60 .

 

 ‘.2-r.-arse.»-ye:-wan-I: 2  «, rs I T:

 

 

 

International to cooperate actively in the uniﬁcation of the
worker sports organizations in every country, and in bringing
about international unity of the workers’ sport movement.
However, it should be bo-rne in mind that the workers’ sport
movement in most countries, even the united organizations,
have in their ranks only a minority of the young toiling
sportsmen. It is therefore necessary to take active part’ in
bringing about cooperation and even an amalgamation of all
sports organizations in which large numbers of young toilets
are to be found. ' a

While participating in the mass sports organizations in
fascist countries it is necessary to ﬁght against chauvinist and
military propaganda of the fascists among the athletes. The
ﬁght of the masses of sportsmen for their immediate demands
should be assisted and given leadership. -

One of the most important immediate tasks in cooperating
with the large masses of young athletes is to carry on a joint
ﬁght against carrying out the Olympic games in fascist
Germany.

VII. Participation of the Youth in the Anti-Imperiulist
People’: Front

A most important and immediate task in the colonial and
semi-colonial countries is the formation of a powerful youth
movement on the basis of combating illiteracy among the
younger generation, for the freedom of national culture, for
healthier and better conditions of life and work, for demo-
cratic rights and liberties against oppression, slavery and
exploitation.

With this in view the organizations aﬂiliated to the Y.C.I.
must establish closer relations with all mass youth organiza-'

61

 

,,.,s.«.~._.M-,:««:- . , 4; rr<‘A<‘ _« <‘\«ﬂ,<1;r4_\

 

tions, especially with the national revolutionary and national
reformist organizations. Cooperating with these and other
mass youth organizations, allowing for the dillerences exist-
ing between the diverse 'strata of the youth in the various
districts of one and the same country, it is necessary to create
various types of rural, Indian, Negro, student, women’s,
cultural, athletic and other youth organizations for the sake
of an amalgamation of the forces of the younger generation
on the basis of a wide platform of struggle in the interests of
the toiling youth, and also to broaden and unite such organ-
izations wherever they are to be found.

The task of drawing the youth into the anti-imperialist
people’s front demands that work be commenced on the estab-
lishment of a new type of mass youth organization of a na-
tional liberation character which would include the widest pos-
sible strata of the youth and the national revolutionary and
national reformist organizations, in place of the narrow political
groups isolated from the basic masses. These organizations
should carry on activity not only in the cities, but where the
basic masses of the rural youth are. They must organize
their work so as to satisfy all the essential requirements and
demands of the youth and educate them in the spirit of revolu-
tionary hatred for the imperialist oppressors, in the spirit of
devotion to the cause of emancipation of their own people
from any form of exploitation and slavery.

The most important task in China is to create a mass move-
ment of the entire youth and their organizations to ﬁght for
better living conditions for the toi.ling youth, for a higher
cultural level, for democratic freedom, and in order to secure
greater active participation of the youth in the ﬁght of the
people to save the country from the imperialist invaders.

VIII. Against Fascism, for Socialism, for a Free and Happy
Life of the Toiling Youth

The Congress of the Young Communist International greets
with pride and joy the ﬁnal and irrevocable victory of social-
ism in the Land of the Soviets. A happy socialist future is
wide open before the youth of the Soviet Union. At the bot-
tom of their education lies Stalin’s great solicitude for the
human being.

Under the wise leadership of Stalin, the great teacher and
best friend of the young toilers of the world, under the leader-
ship of the Bolshevik Party, the youth of the Soviet Union are
marching from victory to victory in the struggle for the
building of a classless, socialist society, which knows no ex-
ploitation of man by man.

The Land of Soviets, carrying into life the revolutionary
tenets of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, has become an invinci-
ble stronghold of the international proletariat in the ﬁght for
freedom and peace.

It is the task of the youth Leagues widely to popularize the
achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and
to rally the youth to the support of the peace policy of the
U.S.S.R., and to its defense against world imperialism.

Fascism is preparing an attack on the land of peace and
labor, and brings the greatest menace to the toilets of all
countries. However, notwithstanding the painful difficulties
and hard living conditions in the fascist countries, as in all
capitalist countries, the forces are growing which shatter the
domination of the bourgeoisie. "The relation of class forces
on a world scale is steadily changing in favor of the growing
forces of the revolution.” (From the Resolution of the
Seventh Congress of the Communist International.)

63

 

The following words uttered by the fearless ﬁghter of fast
cism, Comrade Dimitroff, should guide the struggle of the
whole revolutionary youth: a 2

‘iWe want to ﬁnd a common language with the broad masses
in order to ﬁght against the class enemy, to ﬁnd the path by
which was can ﬁnally end the isolation of the revolutionary
vanguard“ from the masses of the proletariat and all the toilets,
and by which we can put an end to the fatal isolation of the
working class itself from its natu-ral allies in the ﬁght -against
the bourgeoisie, against fascism.”

Our path was shown us by Lenin and Stalin.

.Our path was pointed out by the helmsman of the Com-
munist International, Dimitroﬁ. It is a path of consolidation
and organization on the basis of a wide united front of all
forces of the young generation of toilets. \

We comsecrate all our forces to the salvation of the youth
from fascism and the danger of imperialist war, and to the
ﬁght for a free, joyful, and happy life of the youth.

A World-wide interest was aroused by the proceedings of the
Sixth World Congress of the Young Communist Interna-
tional, which, in September, 1935, in Moscow, brought to-
gether hundreds of representatives from Young Communist
Leagues of some 57 different countries.

More than five thousand young people crowded the St.

Nicholas Arena in New York on November 15, 1935, to hear

the first ofﬁcial report delivered in the country on the work of

the Sixth World Congress of the Y.C.L. Among them were
not only Young Communists, but numerous Young Socialists,

members of trade unions, church youth organizations and un-
aﬂiliated youth. . r

This pamphlet is based on the speech delivered at that
meeting. Its appearance meets the need, widely felt, for a
written exposition of the decisions of the World Communist
Youth Congress, and their meaning for the youth of the coun-
try, faced as it is with the problem of a future, of advancing
reaction and war.

Gil Green, National Secretary of the Young Communist
League of the U .S.A., headed the delegation from this country
to the Congress. A member of the Executive Committee of
the Communist International, he was also elected to the Secre-
tariat of the Young Communist International at the Sixth
World Congress. I I
