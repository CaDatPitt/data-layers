AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT KENNEDY

November 16, 1961 _
Mr. President:

You have repeatedly expressed your opposition to poverty, colo-.
nialism, disease and hunger.

The people of Cuba are attempting to solve these problems and
are making amazing progress---despite obstacles created by the policy
of the U.S. government (trade embargo, encouragement of sabotage and‘
invasion forces). But for the first time in Cuba, the hungry are
being fed, the unemployed are working, the diseased are getting medi-
cal care, the illiterate are being educated, the poor are getting new
homes and their children are clothed.

In sponsoring the recent abortive invasion of Cuba-- an invasion
representing a small minority of Cubans who had lost their property,
position and power to oppress-- the U.S. Stood condemned before out-
raged world opinion. whether we like it or not, Cuba today repres-
ents the vast majority of the Cuban People-

As a result of your policy of military and economic aggression
against Cuba, the U.S. stands before the people of the world as a
liar and hypocrite who talks much about democracy and the freedom of
nations while at the same time trying to crush Cuba by force and
violence. If our government respects in fact as it does in theory
the rights of national self determination then we must respect this
right in Cuba as well as in Hungary.

Mr. President, today in Panama, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic
as well as in Florida and Louisiana, forces are being trained to in-
vade Cuba. There is ample evidence (e.g.,N.Y. Times, Oct. 22) that,
as before the April invasion, the U.S. government is financing, in-
spiring and helping to train these forces and intends to give the in-
vaders direct military support .

Mr. President, as students she are concerned with the peace of
the world as well as with human freedom and dignity, we demand that
you intervene to halt these preparations for another invasion!
Rather, we ask that you accept the offer of the Cuban government to
negotiate, on an equal basis. Rather,_let us reopen diplomatic re-
lations and trade with Cuba. Let us allow U.S. citizens to visit
Cuba and wee the reality of the Cuban revolution for themselves--
LIFT THE TRAVEL BANL N

In a world whose nerves are on edge with fear of war, in a world
facing atomic suicide, let us stive for peaceful relations between
nations. Let us not embark on a brutal and bloody war against the
Cuban people ‘
