more artful deceivers of the Social-Democratic stamp, and the turn-
coat deserters of Communism or the Left-wing, get primary pre-
ference as misleaders of labor these days. This explains why busi-
ness publications like the Wall Street Iournal and Buxinert Week
and big circulation magazines, notably of the Luce chain, give
leaders like Reuther and bubinsky tremendous buildups. It ex-
plains why our State Department gives the Social-Democrats an
A-1 rating. The Murray-Green-Meaney type of labor leaders, who
have never even pretended to be anything but pro-capitalist sys-
tem, are increasingly talking like the Dubinsky-Reuther-Rieve type.
The Vatican’s inﬂuence is largely bent on an effort to exploit

the authority and discipline of the Catholic Church to swing the

millions of Catholic workers to the support of reaction, and parti-
cularly the cold war policy. As in the case of the Social-Democrats,
the primary consideration with the Vatican State is its desire for a
war upon the Soviet Union. Also, as in the case of the Social-
Democrats, the Vatican’s economic program is based on the theory
of labor-management cooperation, for a company-union like rela-
tionship through “industry councils.” The A.C.T.U. organ, the
Lahor Leader (Feb. 21), came out vigorously against the demands
of the miners.

While the A.C.T.U. and kindred groups take the Catholic Church
for a cover, their objectives have no relation to religion. They are
clearly political. It is simply an effort to exploit the Church as a
vehicle for a reactionary inﬂuence among ‘those workers whom
American-style Social—Democracy has not been able to inﬂuence.

The intruxion of churchmen into the aﬂair: of the lahor 7720113-
ment i.r resented hy most Catholicy, including the most devout
among them. The drawing of religious line: in any inxtitution,
especially lahor, is ahhorrent to rnort American: 4.!‘ a violation of
our traditional reparation of Church and Itate.

A coalition of the A.C.T.U.-Social-Democratic forces, helped by
the Trotskyites and other renegades from Communism, has for a
decade been gnawing at the unity of the C.I.O. from inside.

They were particularly gnawing at the alliance which included
the Left and the middle-of-the-roaders, who in the past were cen-

10

 

 

tered mainly around Philip Murray. That was the alliance that led
the C.I.O. in its best days. Recognizing the valuable splitting service
of this A.C.T.U.-Socialist-renegade coalition, the above-mentioned
Chamber of Commerce “handbook” already in 1947 urged the
"loyal” employees to build the same united front in the shops:

"As t/aeir allies tbey may bave some proletarian groaps sncb as
Socialists and Social-Democrats and non-Stalinist C ommanist
groups . . . in anion straggles sacb experienced leaders contribute
organizing ability and generalsbip, altboagb tbeir diverse ideologies
may add confasion. Tbose wbo bave patriotic or religious motiva-
tion, bat lack experience, at ﬁrst can oﬁer only zeal and nambers,
tbe wbile acqairing experience.”

As late as the ﬁrst half of 1946, Murray and his associates still
held out against Red—baiting and the splitters inside the C.I.O. His
own steel union’s convention in 1946 approved unanimously a
statement he introduced, rejecting constitutional changes aimed at
the Communists. It said:

"As a democratic institation we engage in no purges, no
witcb-/aunts. We do not dictate a man’s tboagbts or beliefs. Most
important of all we do not permit oarselves to be sta/mpeded into
coarser of action wbicb create division among our members and
saw tbe disitnity wbic/9 is song/at by tbose false propbets and bypa-
critical advisers from ivitboat wbo mean as no good.”

WHAT CAUSED THE BREAK

Soon after, however, came the break in the coalition that the
reactionaries sought for a decade. Murray announced his unequivocal
support of the Truman Doctrine. He scrapped the Roosevelt doc-
trine of a durable peace based on “Big Three” unity, which the
C.I.O. endorsed through the war and as late as 1947. The C.I.O.’s
unity chain snapped. From then on, Murray yielded rapidly to the
A.C.T.U.-Social Democratic forces. The monopoly interests were
happy as they saw the rise of a pro—war Red—baiting coalition in
place of the old.

g It soon became apparent that the leaders cannot "have a united
front with the pro-war forces and those who proﬁt by the cold war
11

and at the same time serve the interests of their members. So

rapidly did the C.I.O.’s leaders fall in line with the cold war, that T

recently some among them took the ﬁnal logical step to call for an
alliance with fascism in a war on the Soviet Union. This was
declared openly and brazenly by secretary-treasurer James B. Carey
of the C.I.O., as its official representative in an American Legion-
sponsored “anti-Communist” conference. Carey, as quoted in the
New York Herald Tribune of Jan. 29, 1950, said:

"In the last war we joined with the C ommimirt: to ﬁght the
fct.rci.rt:,' in another war we will join the fctrcirts to defeat the
C ommimirtr.” ‘

When Murray, Reuther, Carey & Co. embarked on the Marshall
Plan course, they did so in the name of the “middle course" of
"neither to the Right nor to the Left.” Carey’s statement may not
yet be the voice of the majority of the C.I.O.’s top leaders. But it
does show where that course is leading.

A foreign policy that leads to an alliance with fascism inevitably
reaps the appropriate harvest for the workers. The first fruit of
the split caused by Murray's plunge for the Truman Doctrine were
the spiritless 1946 political campaign which gave America the
Eightieth Congress and the Taft-Hartley Law. Then came the rapid
Taft-Hartleyization of labor. This came not only through applica-
tion of the law’s union-busting provisions, but especially through
its inﬂuence as a bludgeon over the internal life and control of
unions, and as a stimulant of cannibalistic union raiding.

Many union leaders actually turned policemen in the application
of the law in their unions and became more zealous for it than
the government's administrators. The aﬁidavit was a convenient
weapon for them to get rid of opposition. They often seek to apply
it even to executive board members and others not required to
comply with section 9( h), the anti-Communist afﬁdavit. The law
was also used as an excuse in some instances for turning unions into
tight dictatorships with unprecedented authority in the hands of
oﬂicers on the claim that such was needed to safeguard the union
from Taft-Hartley dangers. . '

Shop action on grievances is often stiﬂed or curtailed, with the

J

authority of shop -stewards often reduced to nothing. This speeds
the vicious circle. As the union loses effectiveness, and dissatisfac-
tion mounts among the workers, the leaders resort even more to the
time-worn ‘.'remedy” of labeling everyone with militancy as 

THE BIG CHANGE IN THE C.I.O.

It took ten years of a united C.I.O. to build up to a high point
of membership strength (about 6,000,000) and a political vigor
in the labor movement that drew the supreme wrath of America’s
tories. But it took less than three years, since the shift to the cold
war and capitulation‘ to Taft-Hartley began, to pull it down to the
low of less than four millions registered at Cleveland.

Instead of “one union, one industry” as the form of organization,
it is now a chaotic cut-throat system of any union in any industry,
and more jurisdictional strife than was ever known in the A. F. of L.

In place of organization of the unorganized, the lifeblood of the
C.I.O., its funds and strength now go mainly for raiding of "non-
conforming” unions and disorganization of the organized.

Its political action is not the promised independent expression of
the workers, but labor fronting for the Democratic Party and stoog-
ing against real independent political action.

The autonomous rights of affiliates were wiped out. Conformance
to the political endorsements of the top leaders and the foreign
policy of the Truman Administration is now the basic condition for
aﬂiliation with the C.I.O.

The earlier progressive role of the C.I.O. in the organization and
advancement of the Negro workers is now giving way to an “un-
winding” process. The mass elimination of Negro workers through
discriminatory layoff and hiring policies is not challenged. Within
most unions very little opportunity for leadership is given Ne-
gro members and there are many cases of discrimination.

The democracy and tolerance for which the early C.I.O. was
noted, have now been replaced by the "Cleveland formula”—the in-
corporation of the Taft-Hartley aﬂidavit into the C.I.O.’s own
constitution and authority for the executive board to accuse, pro-
secute, try and punish for violations of that formula.

13

 

 

The traditional C.I.O. stand for peace and against fascism is now
replaced by a subservience to the war plans of the State Department
and to clerical forces, and even anti-Semitic cartoons.

Once proud of their role as a founder of the World Federation of
Trade Unions, the greatest movement of international labor in
history, the C.I.O.’s leaders now welcome the plaudits of the most
reactionary forces for their part in splitting the W.F.T.U. and
forming the Marshall Plan labor front misnamed the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

In contrast to the time of its birth when it sparked the start of a
wage drive that steadily brought new progress for more than 12
years, the C.I.O.’s leaders now set a wage-freezing pattern by their
acceptance of the new "steel formula.”

Here is how the Boston Globe’s ﬁnancial columnist put it during
the C.I.O.’s convention:

"There have been seven separate wage increases won by the
unions since 1937. . . . In other words for 12 y-ears——-the war
years excluded——the ranks of labor have witnessed their unions
win success after success, each of which put an added number
of dollars in their weekly pay envelopes.

"The next battle of responsible labor leaders may well be an
internal one, the education of its own union membership away
from the often necessary militancy of the past. Indeed, that
battle may alreachx be in process of being joined in the conven-
tion ball at Cleveland.”

Iron Age, organ of the steel industry, said the following editorially
when the convention opened and the steel strike was still on:

"Eﬂorts are now being made to settle the steel strike without
ruining the prestige of Philip Murray as president of the steel
workers. . . . Steel men see trouble ahead if Mr. Murray is
badly beat . ‘

"There are other capable executives in the union but industry
leaders fear they lack the power to hold the membership in
line. Aside from the present dispute the steel industry’s rela-
tions with labor have been remarkably good for many years;
employers have generally been able to override the reds and

14

 

 

radicals in local anions hy direct appeal to Phil Marray. Once

this ﬁght is settled they’d like to keep things that way.”

The Cleveland convention marked only the ﬁnal phase of the
capitulation of the C.I.O.. top leaders to the pressure of V/all Street
and the Truman administration. But the unanimous applause they
received from big business did them no good among the workers.
Workers naturally become suspicious of leaders so lauded by the
enemies of labor.

This caused the C.I.O.’s leaders to make public claims that the
C.I.O. is still “Left” and some even claimed that those expelled
were really the “Right-wing.” One headline across the editorial
column of C.I.O. News said “Don’t Let that ‘Right~Wing’ Tag Fool
You. C.I.O. Program is, Frankly, Left of Center and Leadership is
not Heading in the Direction of Reaction.”

In the same week Textile Lahor, organ of Rieve’s union, said:

"Let’s not permit any misunderstanding to arise about the
C.I.O. because the C ommnnists have heen hiched oat. We can’t
accept——-in the spirit in which they are meant—-all the congra-
tulations of newspapers, radio commentator: and certain em-
players.

"C.I.O. anions are not going to hecome ‘respectable’ in the
eyes of the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association
of Manufacturers or their spohesmen in the press. Any em-
ployer who thinks he can get away cheap hy dealing with anti-

C ommanist anions is in for a horrid shock . . . the real radicals,

the real “Left-wing’ is still in the same place in the ranks of

the C.I.O.”

But on the very day Rieve delivered a speech in Boston along
the lines of the above editorial, he also announced that his union
will pass up a wage increase for the third successive year. Even a
pension demand was dropped. For this Rieve was lauded in a Wall
Street Journal editorial for "labor statesmanship.”

Some weeks before he proclaimed himself so “Left” the Daily
News Record, a textile trade publication, reported the results of its
survey in the New England area as follows: i

"The failure of worhers to accept heavier worhloads has

15

 

 

reached the crisis stage, according to some New England mills.
Management says the matter has reached the ‘impossible’ stage
because the workers fail to accept the cost-reducing measure
despite the pleas of their union leaders.

“ ‘It looks like we will have to show the workers the hard
way. . . . We present facts, the nnion leaders often support
ns, and still no soap,’ is the way one mill oﬂicial pnt it. . . .

“Many of the nnion ofﬁcials admit that selling the workers
new and heavier workloads is no easy task. According to one
anion ofﬁcial workers often throw back this: ‘We have to do
the job not you, so we should have a right to decide.’ ‘Who are
you working for, its or the management?’ ‘Management is
hlnfﬁng and if we yield on this point they will want more/”
The attempts of the Right-wingers to “look Left” is a crude

yswindle. But why are they doing it? Because they feel a different
sentiment among the workers; because the "Right-wing tag” doesn't ’

help them win inﬂuence among the workers. The designation "Left-
wing” means something to the average unionist in America. It
means the more miiltant and advanced section of labor.

It would have been in order for the C.I.O. convention to seriously
examine the reasons for its decline in the recent period.

Why has the membership dropped to considerably below 4,-
000,000 members, according to the C.I.O.’s own ﬁnancial statement
on per capita (and that was before the expulsions began)?

Why is the Taft-Hartley Law still on the books after labor did
so much to re-elect Truman and the majority of the 81st Congress?

What will the workers do in face of a developing crisis with
6,000,000 already unemployed? How can they meet the growing
war threat? _

The C.I.O.’s leaders had neither the will not the program to meet
such questions. That’s why they made "Communism” the issue.
Red-baiting is the inevitable refuge of a leadership that tries to
cover up mis-leadership.

This brings us to the key questions:

1. Is it true, as the reactionary camp claims,» that the present trend
 labor is entirely with the Right wing?

16

 

 

2. Did the C.I.O.’s leaders embark on their dictatorship and ex-
pulsion policy because they feel stronger or weaker?

3. Is there a basis for a counterattack by labor and a new pro-
gressive rise?

On Question 1, about the present trend in the labor movement,
the most serious mistake that could be made by trade unionists is
to see only the reactionary part of the show at Cleveland.

It is true that the C.I.O. convention gave impetus to the reac-
tionary drive on labor. But it is also true that despite the C.I.O.
convention decisions and the hysterical campaign of Murray’s forces:

—The membership of the National Maritime Union rose in a
revolt against the Curran clique, especially in the port of New York.
Only the aid of the New York police department and goons im-
ported from other areas, and a complete scrapping of the union’s
democracy has enabled Curran to control the union’s machinery.

——-The members of a large New York local of the Transport
Workers Union cast 4,600 ballots—28 percent—for a rank-and-ﬁle
ticket in opposition to Quill’s forces, in an election that came
immediately after the convention. These workers are predominantly
Irish-Catholic.

—-—In the United Automobile Workers there is widespread discon-
tent and mounting opposition to Reuther in sections of the union
where he previously had unchallenged support. He has met vigor-
ous opposition to his Ford-type pension plan in the General Motors
and Chrysler divisions.

——-Textile workers, given the slightest rank-and-ﬁle leadership,
revealed a strong revulsion to their Right-wing leaders, especially
in the political elections. In New Bedford and Lawrence, Mass.,
candidates backed by the rank-and-ﬁle forces of the union snowed
under those supported by Rieve’s forces. '

—In the American Newspaper Guild of New York, despite all
that the Right-wing leadership and the publishers did to wipe out
progressive inﬂuence, the rank-and-ﬁle slate drew 36 percent of
the vote.

—In Murray’s own union, there is seething discontent over
neglect of grievances and abandonment of a wage raise.

17

  

—-The Left-progressive unions expelled or marked for expulsion,
far from yielding, showed a stiff front against the C.I.O.’s leaders.
Three months after the convention, they were still holding their

 

own. The planned “blitz” against the U.E. turned into a crawl at an a

early stage of the splitting operation, and the initiative shifted soon
to the U.E.

The above are only a few of the indicators of the "ﬁght-back”
trend that is gathering force down in the ranks. They should effec-
tively destroy claims of the Right wing that their frenzied perform-
ance in Cleveland reﬂected the sentiment of the members. By their
votes and acts in the shops and locals, the workers do not necessarily
express a direct opposition to the Cleveland decisions. But they are
showing opposition against the economic results that ﬂow from
the policies approved in Cleveland.

There are two trends that stem from the Cleveland convention—
the line of the Right wing, which the employers greeted, and the
line of the convention minority, of resistance to the attacks of
the employers. The real decision is still to he made by the men and
women in the shops and locals.

Regarding Question 2, on whether expulsions reﬂect strength or
weakness, it was the magazine New Repnhlic, an ardent supporter
of the C.I.O.’s Right wing, that said editorially of the convention:

"The expulsion of the C ommanist leadership from the C .I.0. at
its convention was an admission of weakness rather than an asser-
tion of strength.” i

The New Republic was right. Leaders who could rally the support
of the membership don’t need dictatorial powers. But there is a
more basic explanation. _

Why were the C.I.O.’s leaders so anxious to be seen by their
members as “Left” or "Left of center”? Because they know that the
real sentiment of the workers is not to the Right; that the pressure
from below is for resistance to employer attacks and against aban-
donment of wage demands; that such pressure will increase and
grow more militant. A

The Right-wing leaders are fearful of the Left-progressives not
only because of the strength they represent now hut also because of

18

 

the far greater potential strength they could influence as the pres-
sure_ from helow for militant leadership increases. Thus, the very
trend of events that gives ground for fear and weakness in the camp
of the Right-wingers provides the hase for new strength and hold-
ness for the Left-progressives.

Regarding Question 5, on the prospects for a new upurge of
labor, it must be remembered that the Right wing has for some
time been resting on its seeming ability to get some concessions
for the workers in exchange for support of a pro-war foreign policy.
The Right-wingers exploited especially the belief among some
workers that an annual budget of more than $20 billion for cold war
purposes will “perpetuate prosperity.” .

A marked change has occurred, especially since the end of 1948.

The monopolists, as James McGraw (quoted earlier) noted, have
decided that the period of concessions is over. The huge cold war
expenditures must come from somewhere. The monopolists are out
to take it out of the workers in the form of speedup, frozen or
lower wages and the continuance of inﬂation prices. Thus the in-
evitable returns for labor’s support of the cold war are not better
but worse conditions. , _
_ The Truman Administration’s effort to appease the labor voters
with big talk of “welfare” legislation is only designed to cover up
the cold war budget. It is -impossible to have a real advance in the
welfare of the people and at the same time dish out as much as
70 percent of the budget for past, present and future wars. The
trend of events, therefore, is to narrow the base for the Right
wing but to broaden the hase for the kind of militant rank-and-ﬁle
leadership the progressive forces in the trade unions should he
ready to give. '

LEFT-PROGRESSIVE STRUGGLE ENTERS NEW STAGE

From the foregoing, it should be evident that the struggle of
progressive unionism is entering a new and higher stage. The ﬁght
is no more over than it was in the twenties when the A. F. of L.’s
top leaders expelled the then very much weaker Left groups and

proclaimed the “end” of the Left wing in the American labor move-
ment. When the new upsurge came it was a hundred times stronger
and broader in scope.

It is idle to speculate now in what form the next stage of labor
advance will emerge. We do know, however, that lahor advance

 

will not explode automatically—not even if conditions economically

and politically cry out for it. A foundation has to he laid for it. That
could come only hy the development of militant progressive rank-
and-ﬁle leadership through struggles from helow—in the plants
and industrial communities——a/round the problems and needs of the
workers.

We have shown earlier in this pamphlet that the attacks upon
the Left inside the labor movement is a reﬂection of——in fact, part
and parcel of—the general anti-labor and cold war drive of the
trusts and of the Truman Administration. So in reverse, to the
degree that the workers develop pressure for a counterattack against
the trusts and for a peace policy, to that degree will the Right-wing
labor leaders too become exposed and isolated from the workers.

That is why the key to everything today is the united front among
the rank and ﬁle in the shops, locals and communities of all forces,
irrespective of ideological, political or religious differences, in the
ﬁght for the elementary immediate needs of the workers. It is
extremely unlikely that at this stage any top leaders hut those of the
progressive-led unions would support such a united front. Most of
the trade-union officialdom, particularly those among them inspired
by the Social-Democrats and A.C.T.U., are strongly tied to united
fronts with the enemies of labor on foreign policy and on such
domestic issues as flow from that foreign program.

The policy of the united front, therefore, is actually the lifeblood
of the working-class movement today. It is the means of arousing
the workers to action on every conceivable level or basis. It is the
means of livening up much of our dormant labor movement, mil-
lions of whose members have no closer relations to their organiza-
tion than the knowledge that their dues are checked off monthly.
In effect it becomes the means of arousing a rank-and-ﬁle interest
in the organizations that to a large measure are today run bureau-

20

 

cratically by paid staffs with very little regard for the rights and
sentiments of the men and women in the shops.

Let us now develop the progressive perspective in the unions
further and do so by posing some of the common questions asked
by workers today.

1. Do THE LEFT-PROGRESSIVES WANT A “THIRD FEDERATION"?

They do not. Their entire line of policy and action, despite provo-
cation, raiding and outright expulsion, has been to ﬁght to stay in
and maintain the unity of the C.I.O. The Right-wing leaders appar-
ently hoped that their raiding and provocations would force the
Left-progressives to secede and relieve the majority of the Cleveland
convention of the blame for the split and expulsions. To the credit
of the Left-led unions, all but the U.E., which was expelled on the
third day of the convention, stuck through to the end. By their
continuing struggle against the “Kangaroo trials” to expel them,

V the whole country could see that the responsibility for the split is

squarely on the shoulders of the Murray-Reuther forces.

But those unions are ﬁghting and are not yielding on their basic
principle-—the right to affiliation as autonomous and democratic
unions; If expelled they will obviously not set themselves up as
targets to be picked off by C.I.O. raiders. They will undoubtedly
coordinate their defense through some common body and cooperate
vigorously in organization of the unorganized, wage and other
struggles.

The Left-progressives today are more cognizant than ever of the
basic principle long established in Left-wing history—-that progres-
sives rnast ﬁght with all strength to stay in the mainstream of labor
and preserve the unity of the working class. They never leave
organizations of their own choice hecaase they have no desire to
leave the workers to the anchallenged rnisleadership of Right-
wingers.

2. WHERE SHOULD THE PROGRESSIVES’ MAIN EMPHASIS BE?
As we have already stressed, it must be mainly among the workers
in the shops and locals. That should be especially underscored be-
21 ’

 

  

to the Right-wing leaders of many unions.

That being the case, it would be a very serious mistake for the
active militants of labor to concentrate their energy in the unions
led by progressives, whose membership embraces only about a mil-
lion of the 14 million in the trade unions. Moreover, the unions

led by the Right wing cover most of the basic and large mass-

 

production industries. The great majority of the progressive-minded
workers are in the unions led by the Right-wingers.

It is important to remember the several forms and levels of
development through which Left progressivism expresses itself in
C.I.0., A. F. of L. or independent unions. It could he through
national Left, or Left-influenced leadership supported hy the rank
and ﬁle militants,’ through local Left-led or Left-influenced forces;
through a coalition with middle-of-the-road forces in some unions
nationally or locally; and through the most prevalent form, rank-
and-ﬁle movements in the shops and locals. V

3. CAN TRUMAN AND MURRAY HAVE A UNITED FRONT WITH
WALL STREET ON FOREIGN POLICY YET PURSUE A PROGRESSIVE
DOMESTIC POLICY?

 

cause of the mounting evidence of the rising hostility from below,

They cannot. They are able to keep many workers under illu— -

sions because they know that most workers see their class interests
more readily on the economic “pork chop” problems and on such
issues as Taft-Hartley, with a direct inﬂuence on their lives, than
they do on political affairs and policies affecting peace or war.
That's why many still think that it is possible to have the Marshall
Plan and a cold war budget of twenty billions and a Wall Street
expansionist policy, and still get higher wages, expanded social
security, rapid housing development, civil rights and the rest of
the “fair deal.” ‘

The recent period gave clear evidence that the two policies are
diametrically opposed to each other. C.I.O.-A. F. of L: commitments
on foreign policy are actual support of a program that calls for a
downward trend in real wages and a shelving of the “welfare” bills.

The workers are beginning to realize this fact in terms of their
22

  

pay envelopes. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows, average
weekly earnings in terms of 1939 dollars dropped from $36.72 in
1944 to $32.32 in the first nine months of 1949. The cold war
economy means keeping up prices.

In the light of the real facts it should be apparent that Truman’s
seeming interest in “welfare” measures and repeated statements for
repeal of the Taft-Hartley law are Worse than false promises. It is
deliberately sowing false illusions among the workers to maintain
:support for his cold war program. Hence the double-dealing that
is so characteristic of the Administration: much talk of civil rights
while its‘ own congressional leaders scuttle civil rights bills and its
own justice department prosecutes the leaders of the Communist
Party and others for their thoughts; big talk for repeal of Taft-
Hartley, while the President and his own appointee, Robert N.
Denham, the boss of the National Labor Relations Board, ask the
courts for the most drastic injunctions against the coal miners ever
tried against unions; big talk for increased purchasing power for
the workers, while a Presidential fact-ﬁnding committee recom-
mends a wage freeze. ‘

The worher: of America will never achieve real economic gain:
as long it! they support a foreign policy that leads to war and pat:
the country’; economy on a military and war pro ﬁt: harir. Until the
worker: realize that the ﬁght for a genuine peace policy mnrt he
waged side hy ride with the daily economic Jtrnggler, they will
neither win immediate improvements nor long range recnrity

and peace.

4. WHY DID THE C.I.O.’s LEADERS TAKE THE BXPULSION LINE?
Because of government pressure for a stepped-up drive to elimi-
nate the progressive minority leadership within the C.I.O. The last
executive board meeting before the C.I.O. convention decided only
to deprive unions of representation on the executive board if they
do not name representatives who “conform” to the policies of the
top Right wing. There was no recommendation for a ban on “Com-
munism.”
Once the C.I.O. leaders decided to expel the opposition, they had
25

1.
l
l

  

to find other than trade-union grounds upon which to do so. For
service to the members and contract conditions, the unions marked
for the purge topped the list. Hence the constitutional provision
jammed through the convention, barring unions with policies that
“are consistently directed toward the achievement of the program
or the purpose of the Communist Party.” The very day after its
adoption that clause was invoked to expell the 500,000-member U.E.

Ignored entirely was even the elementary fact that the U.S. Con-
stitution and Anglo-American law and traditions speciﬁcally pro-
hibit enactment of legislation to be applied retroactively. The ex-
pulsion of the U.E. was carried out on the basis of a rule that didn't
exist at the time the alleged violations occurred.

The length; to which the C.I.O.’: leader: went to conform to
Adminixtrattion preuure, even though they hnew the harm that would
come of it for the worker: und the resentment that would develop,
show: how important the struggle for free unioni.rm—free from
government dictution——i.r today.

5. How DOES THE LATEST‘ TURN IN C.I.O. POLICY AFFECT THE
PROBLEMS OF THE NEGRO WORKERS? ‘

Race supremacists and other reactionary inﬂuences thrive in the
midst of an hysterical intolerance such as rules in the C.I.O. today.
A number of Negro papers, notably the conservative Pittsburgh
Courier were apprehensive in their reports on the Cleveland con-
vention of what may happen to Negro rights in the atmosphere
they sensed.

A deterioration of C.I.O. policy toward the Negroes was evident T

along with the C.I.O.’s general decline in the recent period. Those
delegates at the convention who pointed to the do-nothing policy
of the. C.I.O.’s “Anti-Discrimination Committee” on Jim Crow in
government departments, or to the textile union’s, convention policy
of ducking Negro rights issues for fear of offending Klansmen
delegates, drew the supreme oratorical wrath of Murray and the
other leaders. But the actual criticism remains unanswered because
it was valid. .

More and more instances come to light like the Jim-Crow wash-

room in the C.I. .’s hall in Nashville, Tenn., notices.in convention
calls that names of Negro delegates be_ noted so that arrangements
could be made for their hotel accommodations on a Jim-Crow basis
as the Maryland C.I.O. and the lumber and steel unions did.

Mass layoffs have eliminated Negroes in greatly disproportionate
numbers in many industries. But not much was done about it. This
is becoming reﬂected in a lesser inﬂuence of Negroes in some
unions and a declining number of Negroes in union leadership.
The situation is even worse on hiring rights for Negroes and their
right to be upgraded to better-paid categories.

But the Right-wing leaders still have the same reply to demands
for Jpecial measures to combat discrimination. They shout that
such measures would be “Jim Crow in reverse.” Their answer is a
policy of status quo——doing nothing about them.

One of the most shameful aspects of the attitude of the C.I.O.

leaders to the Negro is their recourse to extreme demagogy on civil
rights. They also have close relations with the top leaders of such
Negro rights organizations as the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. But in actual. practice such public
display of concern for Negro rights only helps cover up their own
do-nothingism within the C.I.O. and it helps them to tie the Negro
vote to the Democrats. Also part of the Right-wing pattern is their
practice of cultivating and subsidizing a small group of Negro trade-
union leaders who help them in a servile manner to cover up the
ugly spots and carry Red-baiting into the Negro communities.

of the Negro people and real action to meet them if one of the
major tarh: of progressive: in the trade unions. Anal in the first
place, the progrerrives should give a living example of what conlcl
he done in the organizations where they have influence.

6. WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE STEEL FACT-FINDING REPORT?
It is a government-directed freeze of wages, projected much as
the “Little Steel Formula” was during the war. The steel interests
immediately hailed the freeze with j_oy. They provoked the strike
for other concessions. Murray’s "wholehearted” acceptance of the
25

 

 

report halted an uninterrupted trend in wage raises that began with
the great 1937 victories of the C.I.O. It is the first big victory for
the employers in their drive to shift the burden of the developing
crisis and cold war expenditures to the shoulders of the workers.

The loss of the "fourth round” prone: conclarinely that the Left
way right at the Portland convention when it called for a joint
strategy of the C.I.O. anions in wage negotiation: to set a maximum
porrihle wage pattern.

7. WHY was THE U.E. CHOSEN AS TARGET No. 1?

It is the largest of the progressive-led unions. It most directly
put to shame the leadership of the major Right-wing unions and
made it difficult for them to capitulate to the employers.

The refusal by the U.E.’s convention last September to accept for
its “pattern” the report of President Truman’s Fact-Finding Board
freezing wages, threw the Right-wing into a ﬁt of fury. Murray
singled out this action of the U.E. for special treatment in his
report to the convention and referred to the U.E.’s insistence on a
wage raise as “strikebreaking.” Murray considers it as a matter of
course that any settlement he makes must become the “pattern”
for all-—even if he settled for a song and agreed to freeze wages.

By its refusal to be guided by Murray’s “pattern” the U.E., like
other Left unions, won cash raises in hundreds of independent shops.
Another especially notable example was the 21-cent hourly raise
which the Hawaii longshoremen, members of the union led by
Harry Bridges, won in the very week that Murray agreed to take a
wage freeze. The miners, too, won 18-20 cents an hour.

The rtraggle to Jane the U.E. and defeat the new C.I.O. creation
is errentially a rtraggle for anionirm that ii free and unfettered by
government dictation or company inflnence.

8. CAN POLITICAL SUBMISSION BE MADE THE BASIS OF UNITY?
It must not if the trade unions are to stay united in the present
period. The elementary basis of a trade union is the bread and
butter ﬁght that unites all those of an industry or trade. Political
discipline imposed on a membership that is today of different

26

 

 

political trends, and in the absence of labor’s own party, is suicide
for a union, and especially a federative body like the C.I.O.
Right-wing emphasis on politics today is far from a sign of prog-
ress on their part. It is rather an indication that their interest in
their» type of political action——pro-employer and pro-old party-

~ takes precedence even over the needs of the union.

Progrerriver certainly rtreu political action hy labor. But they
want action independent of the old political parties, independent of
the Administration and they want it aimed toward the interest: of
the people, not for the cold war proﬁteerr. N or do progressive:

« believe in hlndgeoning a anion nzeinherrhip into political action.

The worker: mart he won for it.

9. How SIGNIFICANT ARE THE PENSION GAINS?

Philip Murray boasts that the pension and insurance plans are a
worth-while exchange for the wage freeze. Pensions are unques-
tionably urgent. The pressure for them in labor ranks is evidence
of the insecurity felt by the workers and the inadequacy of a Social
Insurance system that pays an average of $26 monthly to the aged.
The movement for pensions was especially stimulated when the
miners broke through with a plan of $100 at 60 for one who worked
20 years anywhere in the coal industry.

.There must, however, be a sharp distinction between a real pen-
sion and mockeries like those agreed to by Murray in steel and
Reuther in Ford. The Ford plan adds to social security an amount
to make up $100 a month if an employee reaches the age of 65
and has put in at least 30 years of service with the Jame company.
A year is set as an average of 1,800 hours, which means that most
who qualify must have really put in 35 or more years of continnom
employment with the same company. The workers have no protec-
tion against physical examinations or any other grounds that could
result in discharges even on the eve of the pension deadline.

It is ridiculous to think that many workers, if any, could survive
the speedup and annual layoffs and live to be 65 and collect any-
thing from Ford.

Murray's steel plan is slightly better but it too ties a worker to,

27

  

the same employer for 25 years to qualify at 65 for the difference
between social security and $100. The pension plan is entirely
controlled by the companies.

Murray’s early boast that he won “10 or 12” cents an hour in the
pension deal was effectively deﬂated by Chairman Eugene Grace of
Bethlehem when he informed his stockholders that the added cost
to the company’s old plan will run $2,000,000 to $2,500,000 annu-
ally which he noted is a very small amount on an annual payroll of
$490,000,000. This ﬁgures out to considerably less than one cent
an hour. Grace also said that the entire cost of the plan would run
from $7,500,000 to $10,000,000 a year. This is calculated to run
about three cents an hour. Surely, the cost of the same plan to other
companies is not far from that ﬁgure. This compares to an average
of over 25 cents hourly the coal operators give into the miners’
welfare fund. 0

Progressive unionists certainly stress pensions. But not the three-
cent kind. N at the kind that encourage the speedup of workers and

the squeezing out of the aged hefore they are pensionable ( as Grace"

concedes is the actual practice); not the kind that ties a worker like
a serf to a plant for his working lifetime; not the kind that lifts
the burden oﬁ‘ the employers with every improvement in Federal
social security.

10. How DOES THE SPEEDUP PROBLEM FIT INTO THIS PICTURE?

The speedup of labor has become one of the serious problems for
the labor movement. It is the primary form today through which the
employers pass the burden on to the workers.

The Right wing ignores the speedup issue. Many of its leaders,
like those of the C.I.O.’s textile union, are openly cooperating with
false company-union theory that higher wages can only come out
of increased productivity. Some C.I.O. leaders, like George Baldanzi
of the textile union, are even cooperating with employers in a
movement to revive proﬁt-sharing as an incentive to speedup.

The ﬁght against speedup, which the early C .1 .0. considered one of
its primary objectives, depends today mainly on the initiative and
leadership of progressive rank-and-ﬁle forces in locals and shops.

28

 

 

11. WHY DID DID THE C.I.O. LEAVE THE W.F.T.U.?

Because the State Department wants its leaders, together with
those in the A. F. of L., to be the instruments of its cold war policy
abroad. As Justice William Douglas expressed it at the C.I.O.’s
Portland convention, "Labor is peculiarly qualiﬁed to bridge a gap
that has been growing between the United States and Europe” and
that it “carries good credentials” so "doors tightly closed to all
others may open at its knock.”

On the other hand, the W.F.T.U., uniting 70,000,000 workers of L

the world is an instrument of peace. This was acknowledged in the
C.I.O.’s own convention resolutions of 1946 and earlier in which
the harmony between the workers of many nations in the W.F.T.U.
was contrasted to the strife in the United Nations.

In serving with the A. F. of L.’s leaders as the principal splitters
of the W.F.T.U. and as the initiators of the International Con-
federation of Free Trade Unions, the C.I.O.’s leaders switched from
a policy of solidarity with the workers of the world for peace, to
one of mobilizing, bludgeoning or bribing labor leaders abroad for
a Marshall Plan labor front. On their return from the London
I.C.F.T.U. conference, the A. F. of L.-C.I.O. delegates won the praise
of employer organs like Business Week for defeating the “Socialists”
of Europe and putting the organization on a “free enterprise” basis.
The reactionary and anti-Semitic Vatican organ, the Brooklyn Tablet,
hailed them for favoring “Christian rather than Socialist trade
unions." The two who were singled out for special praise by both
of these organs because of their role in the delicate situation, were
the Social-Democrats, Reuther and Dubinsky.

The I.C.F.T.U. does not express the international aspirations of
America’s workers. It is a false front designed to make the workers
think they are aﬂiliated internationally. True progressives have the
task of arousing the genuine sentiments of internationalism through
movements for peace, for trade relations with the new China, the
Soviet Union and the new democracies, and common action with
workers ahroad on economic or other problems aﬂecting the mutual
interests of the workers.

THE C~.I.O. TODAY
By GEORGE MORRIS A

The American trade unions are today under the most serious
attack since the open-shop drive of the twenties.

The “fourth round” wage demand was lost for the overwhelming
majority of the workers. For the first time since 1957 an upward
wage-trend was broken. The Bureau of Labor Statistics wage index
even shows a small dip in average wage earnings compared to a
year ago. Prices of consumer goods did not show the promised
decline.

Most ominous, however, of the plans of the anti-labor strategists,
is. the concentration of their artillery against the powerful United
Mine Workers and United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers.
After eight months of sparring, with the miners without a contract,
the operators obtained their wish—the full force of the National
Labor Relations Board and the Taft-Hartley club. But the miners,
after a five-month struggle, won the ﬁght and turned the tide of
defeats for labor.

Open, police-protected strikebreaking and clubbing of pickets
are again a frequent occurrence. Strikes for modest demands stretch
for six months and as long as a year as in the cases of American
Zinc, Singer Sewing, Hawaii Longshoremen, San Francisco ware-
housemen,.Bell Aircraft and the Chicago publishers.

Organization of the unorganized is virtually at »a standstill. Re;
porting to the 1949" C120. convention, Philip Murray wrote~:«_

"I‘n~ 4~ country where lather orgttrzizoztionr; only include one.
third’ of‘ those eligible for memherrhip, orgzmizattiori of new--
memherr hm‘ Jlowed down to at rate where it rcarcely equal;
the lot; of member: due to death and retirement from in-.
dmtry.”

The Taft-Hartley Law continues on the books after three years,
eating into the Vitals of the labor movement. Its poison seeps into,

‘ 12. CAN THE C.I.O.’s LEADERSHIP PROLONG ITS DICTATORSHIP?

That is extremely unlikely because many factors in the C.I.O.’s‘
situation diﬂer sharply from those that helped to entrench a bureau-
cracy over the A. F. of L. The A. F. of L., until the C.I.O.’s rise, was
primarily of craft organizations of skilled workers. It developed
slowly over a period of some 60 years, most of it during a compara-
tively tranquil period in the world. Working-class political con-
sciousness was at a very elementary stage during most of that period.
This condition enabled leaders to entrench their machines.

The C.I.O. is primarily built on the more dynamic base of mass

production, basic industry and assembly-line workers. Young in t

the labor movement, these workers have been introduced to union-
ism through a Leftward wave of militant struggles unequalled in
American history. Their union education, until comparatively re-
cently, was generally progressive. The C.I.O.’s ﬁghting tradition is
still strong in the ranks, despite all that the Right-wingers have done
to wipe it out. The great majority of the C.I.O. workers are em-
ployed by the big monopolists of American economy and are
therefore at the point where the interests of the people and the trusts
clash most sharply. These workers, brought together in thousands
in one plant and subject to speedup and other of the most ruthless
forms of exploitation, are naturally the most militant and
politically the more active workers. C.I.O. leaders may temporarily
inﬂuence some workers through skillful demagogy, and they may
operate union ofﬁces through machines of paid staffmen, and they
may for some time live on the sunshine of government aid, but
they will not have the opportunity the A. F. of L.’s leaders of pre-
C.I.O. days had. Their labor-management cooperation schemes and
programs will never get a "stable” base among the type of mem-
bers they have. ~

The world in perpetual" economic or war’ crisis. we live in will not
permit the consolidation of" the kind of‘"a base the Right wingers plan
upon. The Left-progressives, much stronger today than ‘ever, and
the widespread militancy in the working class that provides an even

greater base for them, will press the struggle more vigorously than.

ever..
30.

 

 

The A. F. of L.-C.I.O. top leaders have no program to meet either
the immediate or longer range problems of the workers. As the
weight of the developing depression and cold war economy bears
heavier upon the workers, so also will the unﬁtness of Right-wing
leaders become more apparent to the workers; so also will grow the

trend for the united front of the workers in the shops, locals and_

communities under the leadership of those who do have a program
to meet the situation and the will and vigor to ﬁght forpit.

This pamphlet was no sooner ﬁnished than the cheering news
came of the great victory of the coal miners. They held out until
many of their families were at the starvation point; thousands of
miners’ families depended on the hundreds of tons of foodstuffs
collected for them in a campaign sparked by the Left-progressive
unions and other organizations. They set a new high wage raise
mark—18 to 20 cents an hour. The union retained virtual control
of the $155,000,000-a-year welfare fund. Even more signiﬁcant is
the effect of the victory for all labor. It showed that the wage freeze

- could be broken; that the road to progress is militancy and soli-

darity, not surrender and crawling before employers, courts and
politicians. Above everything, the miners spurred all labor to set
higher sights and it has become much more difficult for the Mur-
rays and Reuthers to surrender.

It is not an accident that at such a moment the enemies of labor
once more trotted out the Mundt-Nixon bill, ostensibly aimed at
“subversives” and the Communist Party, but actually designed as a
weapon against all progressives in the labor movement. The reac-
tionaries know well that the Left-progressives are the real source
of the militancy, program and leadership to which the workers will
inevitably rally. But just as sure as a new tide of militancy is de-
veloping so will all honest elements in the labor movement rally
against this follow-up of the discredited Taft-Hartley Law. The
"Red-scare” did not stop the C.I.O. in its early, progressive, days.
It will not stop the new rise of working-class militancy.

the unions through numerous channels, weakening their resistance
power as ruling after ruling by the N.L.R.B. ties more strings around
them. ' ’

Large numbers of Negro workers, whose organization marked a
great advance for American labor, are being eliminated from many
industries through discriminatory layoﬁs and hiring policies and
practices. ‘

The Gestapo-like political supervision over unions by the govern-
ment that began with- Taft-Hartley affidavits and “loyalty oaths”
for government workers, advanced another step. Now there is an
attempt to extend the practice of “loyalty oaths” to private industry
on the ground that they are working on government orders.

 

This deteriorating process is creeping up in the unions like a"

paralysis sapping their power to ﬁght back and leaving them ex-
posed to the inevitable frontal challenge to labor that is bound to
come. Lest anyone doubt that such is the plan of the trusts, here is

what James McGraw of McGraw-Hill Publishers, a leading voice ,

of big business, said in a full-page ad when the steel industry
forced the recent strike:

"An influential group of employer: have raised right: be-
yond the immediate economic interest and have taken on a
hattle of principle important to every hariness in the land.
They have decided the time has come—-right now—to xtop
appearing labor leaderr.”

The above is only the domestic reﬂection of the bi-partisan
foreign policy of aggressive war preparation to achieve world
domination by America's monopolists. Everything is being chained
to their war chariot. The Right-wing olﬁcialdom of most unions

is the principal instrument of the Administration and the trusts in

their effort to tie the labor unions to their war chariot and to wipe
out the most elementary rights of the workers in the process.

Such was the background for the 1949 conventions of the C.I.O.
and A. F. of L. Few expected the A. F. of L.’s leaders to come out
with a program to meet the situation. But there was still some hope
that the C.I.O. might initiate a ﬁght-back movement.

The Cleveland convention provided the final proof, if such was

4

 

still needed, that the margin of difference between the top leaders
of the A. F. of L. and C.I.O. is almost at the vanishing point.‘ The
C.I.O. convention was a hysterical Red-baiting show. Its majority
voted for a policy that soon brought expulsion proceedings against
unions led by progressives with a total membership of nearly a mil-
lion. Conformance to top political decisions and political endorse-
ments was made a condition for continued membership in the
C.I.O. The organization became fully tied to the cold-war program
of the Truman Administration. The real problems of the workers,
especially their economic needs and the developing depression, re-
ceived no more attention in the C.I.O. convention than was given
them at the A. F. of L.’s.

The Cleveland Convention of the C.I.O. was more than a Red-
baiting show. It actually mazréed at new situation for t/ye Americzm
labor movement. Because the C.I.O. is no longer the pace-setter and
a spur to the ATP. of L, the “pattern setting” basic ‘industries or-
ganized by the C.I.O., like steel and auto, no longer set new marks
for labor. They move the clock back with long-term wage-freezing
agreements and they compromise labor’s pension struggle by agree-
ing to pie-in-the-sky type plans. Most serious of all, the C.I.O.’s
leaders initiated a splitting campaign in the labor movement that
turned energy and resources to internal strife when it is so sorely
needed against the union-busting tide. This was new encourage-
ment to the monopolists to step up their attacks upon labor. The
employers certainly have capitalized upon the opportunity since the
C.I.O. convention. The developing gangup against the coal miners
and the U.E. is some measure of what happened in the short period.

While the C.I.O.’s top leaders were the chief performers at the
Cleveland convention, they really danced to the tune of the Truman
Administration's wirepullers. Apparently the Washington policy-
setters decided that even a minority is no longer permissible in the
C.I.O. because it still served as a center of resistance to the Ad-
ministration’s foreign policy of aggressive imperialist expansion
abroad and wage freezing at home. The mere existence of that
minority retarded the top offrcialdom of the C.I.O. from going the
whole hog for the the cold war. Thus the Cleveland convention

5 V .

  

marked a complete official break with the glorious C.I.O. that
sparked the historic rise of American labor in the middle thirties——
the C.I.O. that still showed some of those sparks as late as 1946.

There were, however, two sides on Cleveland's convention floor.
The clash there also ushered in a new and higher stage of the strug-
gle for progressive unionism. The issues around which this struggle
will shape and develop were also indicated on the ﬂoor of that con-
vention. Hardly had it adjourned than evidence began to appear on
all sides in the form of movements of thousands of workers in
opposition to the surrender policies of the C.I.O.’s top bureaucracy.

It is important, therefore, to see not only the negative and pes-
simistic side of the present labor picture but, above all, we must
stress the elements for a new rise that are developing. Before, how-
ever, we deal with the latter, let us see what led to the present decline
of the C.I.O.

HOW THE UNION-BUSTING PATTERN DEVELOPED

The attack upon the Left-progressives inside labor is part and
parcel of the general pattern of attack of reaction upon the labor
movement as a whole. That’s how it was in the open-shop twenties.
The enemies of labor then, too, accompanied their drive on the
unions with a frenzied campaign against the “Red menace.” The
aim was to split labor’s organizations by encouraging a belief among
conservative union leaders that if they expel or remove from office
the militant, honest elements, the employers would have a more
kindly attitude toward them and the workers in their unions.

This formula was made to order for reactionaries inside labor.
Racketeers and assorted crooks needed no encouragement to use
it against all their opponents and as a means of perpetuating them-
selves in oﬂice. The formula worked wonders for the employers in
the twenties. The net result was the smashing of many unions and a
drop of union membership to about half of what it was when
World War I ended. Labor leaders who thought they’d save them-
selves and their organizations from attack, by Red-baiting, met with
sad disappointment. The open shoppers and wage cutters, on a

 

 

rampage, knew no limits. A labor movement strife-torn by Red-
baiting, its most militant elements victimized, its leaders offering
surrender, showed little or no real resistance.

The counterattack did not really develop until the middle thirties
with the rise of the C.I.O.——a movement in which the Communists
and all other Left forces had an active and prominent part. Since
the day the C.I.O. was born labor’s enemies counted on the Red-bait-
ing formula that worked so well for them in the twenties. For more
than a decade even the conservative leaders of the C.I.O. resisted
the Red-baiting formula. But today, fourteen years after the C.I.O.’s
rise, the top Right-wing leaders are lending themselves to reaction
just as the A. F. of L.’s leaders had done in the twenties. Neverthe-
less, history does not repeat itself exactly, and the ﬁnal decision is
yet to be made.

This time, nearly ﬁve years after the war, the employers have not
yet dared to launch a frontal attack upon a labor movement of
14,000,000——thrice what it was when World War I ended. The
Left progressives, on the other hand, are far stronger than they
were in the twenties, both as a minority inﬂuence in the Right-
wing-run unions and as leaders of a substantial bloc of progressive-
led organizations.

The monopolists have adjusted their line of attack to ﬁt the new
conditions and the greater strength of labor. Those who feel “safe”
because they don’t yet see the open brutality and fury and the ﬂat-
footed opposition to unions, such as took place in the twenties, fail
to see the more “up-to-date” form of union-busting. Hence they are
likely to miss the real signiﬁcance of what happened in Cleveland.

The line of reaction—-at least in its present phase-—is to em-
phasize not the smashing of unions, but their paralysis and weaken-
ing so they would not be effective. This is in contrast to the policies
of the twenties when the employers felt strong enough to wipe out
even Right-wing unions and replace them with company unions.

The attempt to Red-bait a division between the A. F. of L. and
the C.I.O., and develop a Left-Right rift inside the C.I.O., began
the day the latter was launched. Even the late Sidney Hillman and
John L. Lewis were painted as "Communists.”

7

    

  

The Dies-Thomas Un-American Activities Committee of the
House was formed in 1938 with the major object of fanning a
divisive line in the labor movement. The Dies-Thomas technique
was built on the big lie that certain unions, invariably the most pro-
gressive and vigorous, are led by “foreign agents.” From this fol-
lowed the advice that if the Right-wing labor leaders and the em-
ployers could cooperate in a joint drive against "Reds” in the unions,

 

the labor movement would be better off. This technique evolved ’

into quite a system. The United States Chamber of Commerce even
issued a special “handbook” for -business executives, foremen and
company stooges on how to combat “Communism" in the unions
and in the plants (C ommumltts in the Labor Movement, issued by
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Committee on Communism and
Socialism). Numerous other employer outﬁts issued similar “anti-
Communist guides” and the whole profession of “labor relations”
became slanted with the Red-baiting “approach.”

The technique developed the following:

1. The ancient blacklist was revived as a “Red list.” The applica-
tion of the “loyalty” oath in private industry under Army-Navy
supervision is its latest form.

2. The old industrial spy services and union-busting agencies,
illegalized or greatly undermined by the Wagner Labor Act and
the investigations of the Senate's La Follette Committee, are now
reappearing on a much broader base and with the legal sanction
of the Taft-Hartley law to expel “Communists.”

3. While frontal attacks upon unions to wipe them out is by
no means abandoned, and company unions are still favored in place
of even Right-wing unions, the main emphasis at this stage is the
less direct form of attack. It is on the injection of poison and
paralysis into union ranks to make the legitimate organizations
ineﬁective. It aims to encourage those leaders who play ball with
employers and‘ expel or victimize the active militant unionists as
"Communists,” and wipe out union democracy.

4. The “raiding" of a union, or the invasion of another union’s
jurisdiction, even strikebreaking, is now "justiﬁed” on the ground
that the attacked union is run by “foreign agents."

5. One of the most essential elements of the Red-baiting anti-
labor formula is the exploitation of foreign policy and the general
anti-Soviet hysteria that constantly pollutes the air, as a weapon
against militant unionism. A very convenient weapon, because the
bi-partisan foreign policy is built on anti-Communism, it is readily
seized upon -by scoundrelly and disreputable people in the labor
movement as a ladder to power or as a means of beating down
opposition and perpetuating themselves in power. The very same
conservative forces who until not very long ago ruled out or howled
down every attempt by progressives to discuss problems of foreign
policy in a union, on a claim that it is a problem for the “experts”
or "military authorities,” have suddenly become very much “foreign
policy conscious.”

6. The entire pattern of union-busting through application of
the Red-baiting formula as outlined above, was givena “legal” pat-
tern in the Taft-Hartley Law. That is the real meaning of Section
9(h), the anti-Communist aﬂidavit. It is designed to entrench the
most reactionary forces of labor in power.

SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY AND THE A.C.T.U.

The effect of this entire policy of government interference (and
often control) in unions to steer them in a reactionary direction,
has given new prominence and inﬂuence to two groups inside labor
—-Social-Democracy and the agents of the Vatican State among
which are the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists. Those groups
express the inﬂuence of reaction in labor ranks in the most vicious,
aggressive and demagogic forms.

The labor leaders with a "socialist” background like David
Dubinsky, Walter Reuther and Emil Rieve——more nearly like the
European type of Social-Democrat—were not a very strong inﬂuence
until several years ago. But with the substantial development of
political action by labor in recent years and a rise in political
consciousness among the organized workers generally, many of the
old-line labor leaders who support capitalism as bluntly as do busi-
ness executives, lost their effectiveness among the workers. The
