make outrageous profits. The,French workers,
on the‘ other hand, are suffering more and more
each year. No wonder they call for international
solidarity between French and American work-
ers to mutually improve our conditions.

¥ ITALY

We metwith active workers and trade unioi1- :0
ists in Rome, as well as with the leaders of the
LCGIL (General Confederation of Italian Labor)

and its General Secretary, DiVittorio. A
We discussed the _problems of American labor
with them and answered their questions. Simi-

larly, we heard from the Italian workers about ,
I I their problems. Here, as in France, the workers

pointed out the need for greater labor solidarity

‘ as an aid to increasing the strength of Italian
labor in its struggle for better conditions.'We . .
learned that the CGIL, like the CGTiin France, ‘
has a great majority of the workers in its ranks. s
_ It hasia membership of 5,000,000, while the

Christian Democratic Union has 500,000 mem-

bers and the Social Democratic Union 150,000 g
0 members. i

The leaders of the CGIL, including many who

‘are Catholics and Socialists, pointed out to us I

‘ that when labor struggles take place, all workers,

regardless “of their political “ affiliation or re.

ligious. belief, participate in them, but that the .

kc: &2.m§... .232 6.3.3 35. 3.2 .....a::. .: 8 .0 4%

only guarantee of greater progress of labor is 

consistent unity within one federation.

Unemployment in Itally,

One of the most serious problems faced by 3;
Italian workers is unemployment, which has 
increased greatly. Unfortunately, the Marshall L
Pl-an has stimulated rather than reduced unem- “
ployment. Here’s an example that was cited: 
Previously, Italy had produced a great deal of 
machinery which she had then exchanged for 
wheat from the United States, thus providing §
employment for many workers in the machine }
industry. Under the Marshall Plan, however, 1
the United States gave a great deal of grain to 
Italy. Since there is no longer an exchange of 
l machinery for this grain, many machine fac- ,-
tories have had to close down and the workers 
have been thrown out of work. To make matters I:
worse, Italian industrialists were loaned 200 :1
million dollars under the Marshall Plan to buy 
machinery from the U.S. Thus, while tremendous j
I profits were made out of the transaction, it 
hurts the Italian workers by causing greater 
unemployment. Not only that, but the work- ;
ers, through taxes, are forced to pay the interest '
A on this “gift,” thereby taking an additional cut 

in their standard of living.

We found that there are 2,000,000 unemployed
workers and another 2 million workers work-

, ing part-time. This is confirmed by UN figures,
which indicate 4- million unemployed in Italy.

When one considers that the total labor force
in Italy is only 9 million workers, we can get
an" idea of the terrific rate of unemployment.

As an example of how difficult it is for the
workers to live in Italy, we were informed that
a worker needs about 60,000 lire a month in
order to make ends meet. The average pay is
30,000 lire a month—or about $50. This is $50
a month, not $50 a week! How can these workers
be expected to make a living, one may well
ask. ‘

But in Italy, like in France, the story is not
complete without indicating the tremendous
struggles that the CGIL is conducting and the
many gains it is winning for the workers. In
September, 1950, the workers, through their
union, won a wage increase. They have had to
conduct many strikes. They have - run into a
great deal of interference from the employers,
the government and from those who are trying
to disunite their organization. But in spite of
these obstacles, they were able to win an addi-
tional 8% wage increase this past April.

As for conditions, we found’ that many Italian
workers put in a 48-hour week (8 hours a day,

13

 

no

‘ -7  6 days a week)‘; others work ‘longer * hoursf The . i ‘’

union has been able to win a 20% bonus. for »

" overtime work in some industries and a 50% ;

bonus in other industries. Most ' holidays are

paid for, workers receiving double-time for ~
i holidays. Only a small percentage get paid vaca-i
tions. The union has succeeded in eliminating p

discrimination of any kind in industry.

BERLIN, VIENNA; u, s. zoN£s

In goingwtuo and comingpfromi Eastern Europe,»

 we were able to stop in the U.S.-occupied zones

of Berlin and Vienna. Unfortunately, we. did not

have opportunities to visitifactories and discuss A
, problems with workers. However, we did notice A

one thing which we feel should be reported. 3

Here was the dividing line‘ of Europe. Here we ' I

saw American soldiers serving . as occupational

troops of sections of Germany and Austria.

Here we -began to see that the world is divided A

into. two parts and that if there is to bepeace, p

these two parts must learn to live together. It L
is our conviction that this process is not». being ,

,' helped by the presence of occupation armies
anywhere—whether they be American or B,us- '

sian or any other.

in Prague, waiting for an airplane, interested
the delegation very much. Throughout the city,
we saw many signs of American traditions, in-
fluences and backgrounds in the housing, archi-
tecture and many other aspects of life. We‘ saw
clean streets, prosperous people and stores
jammed with products. If one were to take his
eyes off the signs in the Czech language, he
would think he was in a particularly clean, pros-
perous American city. These people, too, con-
tinually proclaim their friendship for the
American people and asked only to live in peace
with the rest of the world.

POLAND

In Warsaw, we met with both trade union

I leaders and workers. What impressed us most

here was the terrible destruction caused by the
war. We saw whole areas that had been levelled
to the ground. Even though most of the devasta-
tion has been repaired, there is still a great deal
of construction going on in the city. On every
street, for as far as the eye could see, in every
direction, scaffolding is still up in front of every
house. .

We learned that one out of every 25 workers
in Poland is a building worker, engaged in con-
structing new homes; that the most important

15

task of the country is rebuilding Poland; that

there is no unemployment; that the standard of .

living is constantly improving; that the work-
ers pay only up to 5% of their wages for rent;
that the workers do not pay for social insurance
or for the many social services, including nurs-
eries for their children.

Labor Conditions

As to conditions of work, there is generally
a 46-hour week (5 days at 8 hours per day and
6 hours on Saturday.) Workers are paid time-
and-a-half and in some cases double-time for
overtime work. In certain industries, such as the
metal, chemical and mining, the workers have
a 34-hour week. All workers receive 70% of
their wages when they are sick, in addition to
free medical treatment. Workers who are em-
ployed for a year receive two weeks’ vacation
with pay; after; three years, three weeks, and
after 10 years, one month’s vacation.

We were able to see at a glance why these

people constantly told us of their hatred for the .

Nazi fascists who caused this terrible destruc-
tion by systematically mining every house and
every street and blowing them up with dynamite.
We could see why these people hate war with
all their hearts and appeal to us so earnestly

i for peace between our two countries. We saw

that this reconstruction of their country was
the most important thing to them-—that all
their energy is devoted to the rebuilding of
their homes and factories and the winning of a
better life. We were able to understand their
desire that nothing should stand in the way of
this tremendous task.

RUSSIA

Fortunately, we were able to spend a good
deal more time in the Soviet Union. During our
three weeks there, we travelled by «bus, auto,
railroad, planes, motor boat and motor launch.

We covered over 5,000 miles. We_ saw the cities

of Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Zaporozhye,
Simferopol and Yalta. In these cities and in
their suburbs, we saw steel, auto, tractor, ma-
chine and printing plants, a shoe factory, a
bakery, an electrical power station, a collective
farm, the subways, department and food stores,
a winery, apartment houses, churches, theater,
movies, museums, parks, rest homes, sanitoria,

‘ thotels, children’s camps, a hospital and the

botanical gardens. We were in barber shops,
beauty parlors, and libraries. We saw and spoke
to thousands of workers.

the greatest difference that exists in the world
today is that between the United States and the
Soviet Union, and that unless a greater under-
standing develops between our two peoples,
these differences can only widen, through the
efforts of those who exploit these differences
for their own selfish gain, until they would
finally explode into a world war—a terrible
holocaust that would destroy both our peoples
and the world. Therefore, we had to find out
what this country and its people are like.

We truly saw what they are like. They are
ordinary people, like people all over the world
—like the American people. They, too, want
friendship and peace.

Here are the answers to the questions we
asked:

The workers in the Soviet Union make a
good living. They are well-fed, well-clothed and
well-housed. We did not see any hungry or starv-
ing people. The rents they pay average from
three to six per cent of their total wages. This
may sound incredible to Americans, but we
personally checked in every factory we visited,
spoke to thousands of workers and found this
to be the absolute truth. The workers receive
from 14 to 30 days’ vacation every year, depend-
ing upon their skill, length of service and pro-
ductive ability. Their vacations are paid for by

20

 

government funds administered by the trade
unions. Workers’ are paid when sick. Working
women get ‘21/2 months’ paid leave for maternity
care. .

know it on the assembly lines of factories in
America. We did seegood equipment, modern
‘ machinery and safe, healthful working condi-
tions. The factories had plenty of air and ample
windows and light. There is a comfortable work-
ing space between the machines and generally
speaking, the factories and streets are kept
as clean as the homes. \ y  ‘Q
In spite of the desire of the whole country and
the people for increased productivity, which is
reflected in the payment of special bonuses for
-improved technique and extra effort, real “safe-
guards are taken against accidents." We found
1. the worker’s health, age and physical condition
to be the prime consideration, regardless of and
above all else. , - _ _

Slave Laboraa  «

‘During our tour, we did not see one worker
, who could be characterized as a “slave laborer.”
I sWorkers spontaneously stopped at their ma-—

visiting their plant, and freely answered’ 

Nowhere did we see any speed-up as we

chines when they heard that our delegation wag?»  

 _ gquestions. Likewise, they asked us questions.

if r A the social insurance systemd they operate,

about our life in the United States. Without any
doubt, not one ‘worker, by word, manner or
glance, indicated any fear for his own safety
‘or that of his family; ’ _ t  ‘
This question of slave labor became as much
a joke to the American delegates as it is to the
Soviet people. So much so, that on "several
occasions when we saw workers relaxing or sleep-
ing in the sun, we shouted,» “Wake up slave
laborer—=you’re not. allowed to do that!”e——or
we kiddingly remarked, “That poor fellow must
have been worked to death.” .’
Our delegation——‘-on the basis of its own obsers
vations——agrees with the report of the CIO
delegation to the Soviet Union in‘1945, which
included ames B‘. Carey, Allan Haywood,
Joseph Curran and Emil Rieve, and which
said: »  = p ‘ , A
“We were impressed with the character
_ of the Soviet trade unions, and with their
t pmany excellent, activities in promoting the 3
' interest of the workers, in the economic,
- social welfare and cultural fields'——as well
 as with the most far-reaching character of

which is designed to protect working peo-.
ple_ and, their families against all con-
tingencies, from the cradle to the grave.”

v ‘ S 23 k

  
  

 

our delegation saw, on a much expanded scale,
in 1951. We are therefore unable to understand
how it is possible for these same trade unionists

today, without having revisited the Soviet

Union, to repudiate everything they said before,
and to suddenly unveil Hearst-like stories of
“slave labor” in the Soviet Union—stories which
are nothing more than figments of their imagina-
tions.

It is interesting to observe that, contrary to
the horror stories of the so-called “iron curtain”
as depicted in many sections of the American
press, this delegation had complete freedom
of movement in the Soviet Union. there were
no secret police following us around. Instead,
in every city, we left our hotels when we pleased
and we walked through the streets without
guides or interpreters, day or night, whenever
we chose to do so. We walked through and
around Red Square in Moscow on many occa-
sions. The delegation feels compelled to contrast
this freedom of movement with conditions in
our own country. There were several other

elected representatives of workers who were-

scheduled to come on this delegation. Some were
refusedtpassports, others had their passports
revoked, and still others were given restricted
time limited passports. One of the delegates was

24

.E:u=__:3 .333 «$3.35 m:..EuaE

 
 

refused his passport and only after considerable
protests were exerted did he receive permission
from our government to travel abroad. We call
the attention of the American people to the need

,_ for a ehanged attitude on the part of our gov-

ernment . on this vital question of ‘freedom of

movement.

Religious Freedom

\ We saw complete’ freedom of religion in the
Soviet Union. In every city we visited, we saw
both churches and people attending them; In
Moscow, several of our delegates who are Roman
Catholics went to the Roman Catholic Church
of St. Louis on two separate. Sundays. They
found, the same people there the second time

V that they had seen previously. These people

said that they had been going to church in Mos-

 

cow all their lives, that they attended church-

regularly, and that no one interfered with their

- L right to attend. They said that while their chil-
‘ dren ‘did not receive any religious training in

"26

 

school, they likewise. did not‘ receive any anti-
religious training. They pointed out that after
the war, since their church had been destroyed,
the parishioners petitioned the government for

a church and were given one free. Annual taxes

paid by their church to the government ‘amounts

\ .

  

to only $200 a year. The priest" is paid  the
congregation and engages in no other activities
outsidehis religious functions. -

With regard to the Jewish people, weleamed

that under the Soviet Constitution, anti-Semit-

‘v ism is a crime against ‘the state, with heavy

penalties prescribed. We found out that most

of the Jews in the areas of Western Russia ~

occupied. by the Germans had -been murdered
by them. Jewish people play a prominent part
in every aspect of the political, economic and

cultural life of the country, and many of them \

have received the Stalin Prize for their contri-

hutions in these fields. Jewish synagogues func-’
tion freely all over the country, in addition to

the ‘Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic and other

L churches. We learned that the place where J ew¢

ish culture and religion is most extensively de-
veloped is the Jewish National State of Biro-

Bidjan, where the Jewish people have their own

newspapers and schools and where the Jewish

language is taught to the children.

While touring the plants and factories,/we

. learned that workers who are sick are sent ‘home

or are taken care of by the hospital attached

‘to the factory or plant, without any loss in pay. V

Absenteeism is very low. Where it exists, it is
taken- care of by the workers and the trade
union‘ organization through many discussions.

“ 27

Where it becomes incurably chronic} workers
are helped to find jobs in other plants. /

No Unemployment

There is no unemployment.‘ Everywhere we

went, we saw “Help Wanted” signs. Due to the ‘
V tremendous amount of reconstruction and the

peaceful expansion of industry, more and more
labor is needed. We saw great numbers of women
working in all jobs, in all categories and skills,
including drivers of railroad trains. T.

Workers explained to us that they do no
have strikesvin the Soviet Union because their

— country belongs" to them. They added that they

were working for themselves and not for profits
for employers. Their production is turned back
to them in the form of better and more abundant»
goods, making for a higher standard of living.
They also pointed out that they haye an ef-

_fective trade- union organization and strong

collective bargaining agreements through which
their complaints," grievances’ and problems are’

'quickly, and satisfactorily adjusted with ~manage-

 28

ment. ~ The unions are in a position to deal;
effectively with management, upto and includ- ‘
ing the removal of . ‘directors ' who violate: the
rights of the workers.  . .

_ .We do not want to give the impression in this

/

report, despite the many wonderful and ad-

. vancéd things we saw during our visit there, -that
everything is wonderful in the Soviet Union. A

There are some respects in which the Soviet
Union would do well to emulate what exists
in the United States.‘ Perhaps most important
of all, we found the plumbing facilities. inade-
quate. In the ‘United States, such facilities are

also inadequate in certain sections of the co'un- _ ,

try, particularly in communities where working

people, Negroes, Puerto-Ricans and Mexican-.

Americans live. Yet the facilities there are not
quite up to our standards. A ~
Generally speaking, this is also true of the
railroads. We realize that, because of the devas-
tating destruction of the war, the immediate

needs of the Russian people were to rebuild I

both industry and homes.-Nevertheless, we wish

u to point out that our railroad facilities are more‘

advanced and much «better than those in the
Soviet Union. ‘ ’ ' S

No Guided Tour _
This was no guided tour. We were not given

‘ any pre-arranged program by our hosts. We were

Presented here is the unanimous statement 0
the delegation which we believe is of interest
to the entire labor movement of our country.

« r We hope that it will help to clear up the mass

of misinformation which -has been passed on to
our hrother trade unionists’ regarding conditions
of labor and the status of the trade union move-
ment ‘in Europe. ” A

European unionists are anxious and willing

to meet American trade unionists from alllevels

tions of Labor. Our group was composed of the '_

and what factories we wanted to see. hey took
us .to those places. When we visited factories,

 we selected the workers we talked to at random.

In addition, we spoke freely to many people in
the streets, in A the subways, in the churches,
in the parks and in the museums.-

By speaking to hundreds of workers in fac-
tories, we checked the stories of one another and
against our notes so that the translators could

not misinterpret what we were being told. In t
. every"factory we visited, we found one or two
workerswho could speak English and who con-»

versed at length with the delegation. In the
parks and theaters, many. students who are
learning English came up to- talk to us. So we
had many ways of ‘ getting the exact and correct
information that we wanted and not that which

A might have been prepared for us.

Everywhere we went we found a tremendous
desire for friendship with the American people.

Any idea spread by the press that the Soviet A A
people hate us is simply ridiculous. Any idea '

spread in certain quarters of our country that

the Soviet people want our friendship awhile L
the Soviet government hates us, is equally y,ri_dic- V

ulous. There is such a love and support bythe

a people for their leaders that if this were the
case‘ then there would be no question butthat»

any-hatred of America by the government would
30 E    "

influence the people to likewise hate America. '
This is true in our country where large num-,
bers of people are influenced by the policies

of«our- government. In -all truthfulness, there is
a -burning hatred there for those in America
who call for war with the Soviet Union, for those
who advocate the dropping of atom bombs and

for» those who‘ are in favor of continuing and?

spreading the Korean war. But for the Ameri-

can people, there is only the greatest respect

and friendship. As a matter of fact, Russian
trade unionists in Leningrad celebrated our
Independence Day, July 4th, with the American
delegation with the wish that America be free,
independent and at peace with the world.

The Plea of the Children \

Perhaps the greatest» proof of the truth of all V

this is the overwhelming reception accorded to

the delegation by the children. In every instance, ~
» in the children’s camps, in -the theaters where

they were performing, in the parks, in the
streets and,‘ in all the cities we were in-, ,,the
children rushed forward with a great outpour-

‘ing of love.

They “kept telling‘ us over 'and_over to send
their love to the children of America. There are

 those in America who say that \the Russian

.31 A if

‘ ?\

‘ children‘ are indoctrinated by the socialist ‘so-

govemment of the ‘Soviet Union feels that
Americans are their enemies, surely then it
would be reflected in the children of this coun-
try. . » s s ‘ _

On the other hand, while it may be said that
the ‘people we saw in the factories we visited
were all prepared to falsely represent‘ their
opinions and conditions to us, still no one can
say that ‘children can conceal their real feeling.
Children cannot be taught to falsely represent
‘love for hatred. And these many experiences
convinced us on this point.‘

’one’\has been trying to pull the wool over the
eyes of the American people. As to the prepara-
tions for war, the stories in our ‘country have

‘ been’ completely .misle’ading; We have seen only
a peaceful economy with no reconversion for
war production. -‘The auto plants we saw con-
tinued to produce passenger cars. There were
no reconversions in order to produce tanks.and
airplane engines. The tractor plants continued

didn’t see the construction of one air-raid shelter

and in Moscow. we lived in a hotel across the T

street from the Kremlin.

No Racial Barriers

i  One question was sharply pointed up for this

delegation and that is the absolute equality of
all peoples, all nationalities, all races, regardless
of sex, in a country that has very many national-

ities. This was shown. in the special attention

paid by the people wherever we went to the

Negro members of our delegation. There is,

no Jim Crow, no discrimination against colored
peoples in their housing, in their work, in their
play or culture orin any respect. There are no

. jailings of minorities or lynchings of people be-

cause of their color. Colored people and minor-f
ities eat in‘ the same restaurants, sleep in the
same hotels, go to the same beauty parlors and
barber shops. This 6ccurs V, not on the basis of
their passing for in white, but‘ ‘because of the
conscious policy that there is no discrimination
against any human being. , , ‘ ‘
' Even though some members of our delegation

A‘ ,

United States in the last war at battlefronts and
saw what damage war can do, this dqlegation
was shocked by. the extent‘ of the destruction
caused by the last war in the Soviet Union. In
Stalingrad, for example, not one single building
had been left standing. We learned, therefore,
why these people hate war. Ten million people
were killed. In almost every_ family -bitter mem-

ories havepremained. We began to appreciate

why the most burning desire of. everyone in the
Soviet Union is for peace. Every greeting, every
farewell, every Soviet worker _we talked to cried
out for peace. In Leningrad, an old woman texg

tile worker told us what misery the war caused,
V in her personal family and begged us to convey‘
her feelings, the feelings of the workers inher

. a plant and the feelings of the ‘people in her city. '

for a peaceful_world. ! v '
In the "bread-making factory .' in Moscow, the

workers told us that they wanted to continue a

to make moreand better bread for their people
in a world of peace. The workers in a tractor

I . plant’ in_Stalingrad. told us that to them war
L meant the death of oneethird of their city’s

34

population and the destruction of their entire

city. How could they possibly want war? In

Zaporozhye the ‘children in a camp, ‘some . o
whoseparents were killed in the last war, mov-
ingly expressed their e_.arnest‘wish for a peaceful

2

"world in which their future to grow up would
be secure. ‘ '
g ”Let’s Be Friends” '

-. In Yalt-a, where workers were resting in sani-
toria, getting well or vacationing, they‘ flocked

around the American delegates asking why any
disagreements arising out of differences in our

social systems could not be negotiated through/

peaceful means.
We were asked why our government was ring-
ing the world with military and aviation bases.

. We were asked’ why a military alliance aimed

at the Soviet Union-——the North Atlantic Pact-
was concluded. We were asked why billions of
dollarsof our economy are ;being spent for war
preparations. We were asked why, in the very
halls of our Congress, government officials

’ called for war against the Soviet ‘Union. Wewere -

‘ asked why hoodlurns were permitted to attack

understand. and nor can the members of this A
delegation understand,“ those few madmen who
‘ keep calling for war. How ‘can anyone under-
stand a man who stand up in the halls of Con-
gress and shrieks that we should drop an atom
bomb in Moscow? No one; can/Aunderstand. how,
in this day‘ and age, a civilized country can ins V
 crease armaments, make military alliances, and
instruct its generals to. chart out new wars.

Peace is Keynote

We told the Russian people—as we tell, the 
v American people—that we want universal» dis-~
armament. We want the Russian army to be
‘ disarmed .and demobilized,  as we want the -
. American army disarmed and demobilized. We
exchanged greetings with the Russians on the
occasionof America’s national holiday on July
4th;‘ honoring the American people, at which R
t_im\e: we called. for the independence _of all ‘na-' ,
ltions andthe freedom of ‘all people. In_Yalta, .‘
where the’ historic conference of wartime allies)
fighting fascism« took place—where our late ‘
President Roosevelt enunciated his principles-
of world peace" and freedom—we " called upon .

.r 36W

the Russian "people, as we now call upon the

American people, for universal, everlasting‘

friendship. The only pacts we ask for are peace

pacts, not military ones.,The only bonds we ask '
"for are those of friendship, not those created

by money or -by selfish alliances.

We hope that this message will be distributed
as widely through America as the message we

R delivered to the Russian workers and the Russian

people was distributed through the Soviet Union.
We spoke‘ on the radio there and said these

same things. Not once were we told what to ,

say, even by suggestion, Not once were we asked
what we were going to say. Never did we have

to submit a prepared text in advance, nor was
anything we said censored. Our articles and

interviews were printed in the Russian papers.

A This freedom of press and radio is such that

while a tremendous number of newspapers and

,magazines are printed and read by’ practically

everyone and, while almost all the people have
and listen to radios, there is still a demand for

We bring thisreport to you as a public service, /

our most fervent hopes for "a greater America

REPORT OF THE AMERICAN TRADE
UNION DELEGATION THAT VISITED »
EUROPE DURING JULY, 1951 .

Let us _introduce ourselves: \ /
We were members of an American, trade

1951. Our delegation was composed of repre-
ssentatives of workers in AFL, -CIO and inde-
pendent unions from coast to coast. We are

employed in the following industries: automo- A

bile, mines, shoe, sheet metal, fur and leather,

electrical and machine, distributive trades, de-A

partment stores and hotel. and restaurant. ~A'
wide variety of political opinions was reflected
in our delegation. A

/, _ We spent five weeks in Europe and visited? .
France, Italy, Poland and the Soviet Union.
; We- also spent some time in Germany, Austria

and Czechoslovakia. , 
The delegation went to Europe at the invita-
tion of European trade unions. In each country,

unionists as well as officials. V ‘
1 Desire For Peace

In every country we visited we found a deep

/ .

desire on the part of the people ‘for. friendship I

ly,

'66“

with the American people. Wherever we went,
the workers expressed this sentiment. In some
countries, the degree of unity of the workers,

2‘ in their own interest, was greater than in others,
V  but in all countries we were made aware of
’ this desire on the part of all workers for friend-
a ship. The message we were asked to bring back

was that of peace.

Moreover, even though labor conditions
varied in the respective countries we visited, we
found that everywhere the working people have
much to gain from the friendship of the Ameri-
can people, just as we have much to gain from
the things our delegation saw‘ in the course of
our visit. ' V

Here are some of the observations we made
of labor conditions in the countries visited:'

FRANCE

Here we met many trade union leaders, repre- .

sentatives of various kinds of trade unions, in
addition to visiting workers on the job. We met
with leaders of the electrical workers union,
metal workers, miners, paper box workers, fur
and leather and shoe workers, as well as with
the General Secretary of the General Confedera-
tion of Labor (CGT), Brother F ranchon. From
all of them, we heard this message of friendship,
international solidarity of labor and peace.

The delegation visited the Hispano-Suisse W
airplane engine plant outside Paris. We met .

workers and leaders of all three major unions
in F rance—the CGT (which has the overwhelm-
ing majority of workers unified in its ranks),

the Force Ouvriere and the Christian Demo- ’

cratic Union. In this plant, out of 3,400 workers,
1,860 were members of the CGT, 269 of the
Force Ouvriere, 299 of the Christian Democratic
Union, and 380 of an independent union of
engineers.

We learned that the division of workers into
many federations, within the same factory, in-

evitably weakens the workers’ strength and ,

therefore their conditions. For one thing, a
very large percentage of the workers were not
members of any union. This was reflected in
their pay and working conditions, for they earn
an average of 371/; cents an hour. Without
exception, the workers told us that they were
unable to meet the constantly rising cost of
living on their wages. Prices have skyrocketed
in F rance, as they have in our own country.
Workers told us that the employers are making
exhorbitant profits, while those, doing the work,
are unable to make ends meet. The delegation
had an opportunity to observe the housing con-
ditions of the workers and saw the most miser-
able hovels and shacks that it is possible to

Unity Advances

However, this report would be incomplete if
it did not make clear that the workers of France
are uniting more and more and are fighting for
better wages and working conditions. The ma-
jority of the workers have a strong labor organi-
zation in the CGT. In the Renault auto plant,
which has about 35,000 workers, CGT 28,000
members, Force Ouvriere 1,700 and the Chris-
tian Democratic Union 2,800. The CGT func-
tions very effectively as a powerful organization
of labor, with regular meetings, conferences,
conventions and many struggles conducted for
better working conditions. Its concern for the
workers goes beyond the actual factory. We were
fortunate to be able to visit a camp owned and
operated by the metal workers union, where we
saw how the union makes efforts to improve the
life of its members.

The French workers asked for the support of
the American trade unions in their struggles
against their employers for a decent living wage.
They pointed out that the employers of America
are giving every kind of assistance to the French
employers with grants of money and machinery
through the Marshall Plan, enabling them to
