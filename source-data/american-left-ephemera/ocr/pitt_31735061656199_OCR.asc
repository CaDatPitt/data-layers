The Monday evening following the discoveryof the ‘bodies, a white resi;  1
dent of a middle class Oakland neighborhood remarked to his wife: ‘"1 ',

wond—er.what’s happening in W’ est Oakland tonight?” I-Ietheorized correctly

’ that the police would assume from the location of the drug store that the g 
lmurderer (or murderers) was a Negro. He theorized also (and correctly)

that the search for the murderer (or murderers) would be a brutal one. If

this was the reaction of one or two white persons, imagine the reaction of"

the Negro community. A

At 9:30 a. m. on Friday, November 4, a coroner’s jury of ninemen
assembled at 4880 Fourthstreet in Oakland. A police inspector named Leo. , L
Haynes testified that Inspectors Bertoglio and Longnecker were still working _. y ‘

on the case. He said they were satisfied "that Robert Savage and Marjorie

. Ruth Wilson were killed by a party or parties unknown.” , .
And that’s the verdict the jury returned-——"felonious homicide . .‘ . by in

person or persons unknown."
To this day it is not known who killed‘Robe.rt Savage and Marjorie Ruth

I i Wilson. er

But a man-—-or rather a _vouth——si.ts today in death row at San Quentin
prison scheduled to die for their murders. _ ’ T
The story of how he came to be there starts back in Louisiana. _

i . Jerry Newson

On June 3, 1931, somewhere on the outskirts of Monroe, Louisiana, 21
baby boy christened Jerry Newson, was born to Gus and Gazalla Newsom.
(The difference in spelling originated apparently with Jerry.) 

Gus, who was very fond of music and is reported to have spent most oflhis 

children by previous "marriages.” ' .

Gazalla, like many of ‘her girl playmates who grew up in this Southern

time directing church choirs without pay, was also the father of 13 other

' town of 3000 population, became a mother before she was grown, and the siic _'

children that she and Gus had gave Jerry 19 brothers and -sisters.

‘ Moreover, Gus and Gazalla weren’t really legally married" in the full

meaning of the word. As a Southern expression has. it, they‘"justfsort of got
together.”- This “getting together” business is not at alloddin Dixie. Despite
long campaigns waged against such unions by both Negro and white churches-,

_ p and the law enforcement officials, many still exist.

 ‘Typical, argument ‘presented by "get together” couples is, "If we had

‘ waited until we had the money, we never would have married.” It’s well

-3; , known, however; that Southern marriage license fees are unusually high,
 ranging Afrotn $3 to $5,a.nc.l when the preacher or the justice of the peace is

~ . ” paid the same amount for performing his sacred duty, many low income and
is  unemployed couples ' perish the thought of “legality" and “just sort of. get
  together.” \

 J V Gus found it absolutely impossible to support his family’: growing needs
 with what little he earned from his music. He considered himself‘ lucky
indeed,‘ if he averaged $5 per week for leading the Mt. McR.ie Baptist church

choir of which he was a member. ,

i . At the age of six months, Jerry was adopted by James and Sarah New-

; som. James and Gus, had "married” two sisters. They say Gus and Gaialla

W _l _Unlike Gus and Gazalla, James and Sarah were dirt farmers. They share-

_ 5 children of their own, but still they found’ the going rather tough, trying to
J  eke out 1' living growing cotton and corn. As Sarah recalls the situation,

 A before he sat in a school room.” '

’ ‘miles away up the Ouachita river.". » ' i .

determined he would. become a part of that migration. Therewere jobs, he
heard, in California. A » _ ,

But the Newsoms were tied to the land. How could James get train fare ‘I 
for thethree of them? Where would they live once they got to California? ‘ ’
Would there be a job waiting for James? ' I

By now Jerry was 12 years old. He wasaware of what was happening. He
felt that somehow he too had a stake in this thing. Seeing that Uncle James

  

» was finding it rather difficult to make up his mind to leave, it was Jerry who’

said, "Look Uncle James, you go to California any way you can getthere.
Aunt Sarah and I will keep the farm going until you can get a job and send
for us.” i V -I .

Arriving in Oakland in the summer of 1943, James immediately found. '
work in the shipyards. One year later, Sarah} and Jerry arrived.

Oakland like most war—boom cities was faced withpa severe housing
shortage. The Harbor Homes temporary housing project was hardly com-
plete. James considered himself fortunate when he landed a small two room.
apartment in this project, overlooking the Estuary. ' ‘ ‘ .' _

Sarah, like James, had no difficulty finding work. The difference was she E _' i
worked as a domestic servant while he worked in industry. Nevertheless, ‘the
thing they had hoped for for so long was now a reality. That wasthe chance A
for Jerry to get some decent schooling. He enrolled in the fifth grade at ’_
Prescott Junior High school and began receiving A’s and B's. a

He was quick to get .over his farm-boy backwardness. He made up three
full grades in the short period of two years. Upon graduationjfrom Prescott, ‘ l
he continued his studies at McClymonds High, where his report card showed
marks of “excellent,” "good" and "fair." In the meantime, Jerry had been
earning as much as $8 per day working part-time for one of the drivers of ~ , 
the»Union Ice Company. : _ .. I A  st _ 7 .

Jerry had taken this money he earned delivering ice to buy several suits, »  _ .
a $50 wrist watch, and a half dozen pairs of shoes.~He bought presents for .  ‘J . 
his mother, father, brother's and sisters back ‘home, and he had given his. ‘ 
Uncle James and Aunt Sarah large sums of money to help with the family

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

By now the war was over. Hundreds of thousands were fast becoming  J . ‘
unemployed. Jerry no longer worked for the Union Ice driver. The politi-  g  
cians were wondering what to do with all these people who ha.d“come here I  ” 
to work. The newspapers had begun magnifying every little incident into a
major crime wave. The daily news columns were filled with stories about , .
"punks,” “hoodlums” and "gangs.” Negro citizens in a score of cities through-_._ J "

James Newsom wasn't working regularly now. He left the shipyard   "I,

  

 

 
 

 
   

-on a part-time basis. It was quite a difference between $6‘ per week for
, busting suds and the $48-he had received for delivering ice. Soon he gave up
_ A the dish-washing job to take one ‘shining shoes. He could average about $2
is providing" he worked _all day. This, however, meant quitting school. Jerry
“was nowin the eleventh grade. The classes were getting dull and, for the
,» second time in his young life, there was very little to’ look forward to. So he
' quit school.‘ a A

He soon discovered the owner of the shine stand got most of the’ money

and the boys got the short end. So he struck out ‘for himself. He leased a’
shine stand at the corner of 11th and Broadway. It didn't take him long to

learn hereeither, that shoe shine boys don’t have_much take-home dough»
even when they are running the show. The overhead was too heavy, the rent

’ * too much. A .
This was the Jerry Newson who found himself—-one day in the fall of.
Q1949-“——in the headlines of the San Francisco and Oakland newspapers. .

CHAPTER III  

Harbor Homes

Oakland has the second largest Negro community in the state of Califora 1‘

nia and the third largest west of the Mississippi river. Official estimates place
the number of Negroes in this fast growing community atj_60,000.

' The Harbor Homes Housing Project is a part of West Oakland,,but it's
isolated from the rest of the community. It comes very close to being a settle-

Hi ment within itself. Although it was-designed during the war years to be
temporary in structure, today it "still houses some 2000 men, women -and
children, who. have no other place to live.’And about 40 percent of its resif

dents areunemployed. . , .. i - _ .
There is onlyxone narrow route.that leads in and out of the project.’ It is

‘ ~ surrounded on‘-the south and west sides by the Oakland _Estuary, a narrow
waterway-lying between Oakland and the island of Alameda. On the east, p
“ ‘the scenery is blanked-our by a large shipyard. And, to "the north, there are

the freight yards of the Western Pacific and the Southern Pacific railroads,

plus a large number of warehouses and freight docks. . A _ '
Residents complain that all through the night they are disturbed by switch

engines slamming freight cars together with thunderous repercussions, and in

 the day, low-flying airplanes from the Naval Air Station, right across the .
‘ f  narrow Estuary, keep the occupants’, nerves on edge. ‘ .

thisplace, not to mention a lawn.” All of. the dwellings have electricity and

plumbing, but heating and cooking is done by kerosene.
One person, who was among the first to move in the project seven years
ago, said, "This place smells just like an oil refinery when the people are

' . cooking their meals in the evenings.” The several streets that run through the

project are so narrow, that two cars passing have to go extremelyvslow. A $5
fine is the penalty for anybody caught parking on the cross screets by the po-
lice forever on the prowl there. ‘ . « . j T

Despite the fact the project is separated from the main Negro districé

by a mile and a half, most of its people can be found sharing in the central
'. life of West Oakland. Oldtirners of the project point with significance to the
fact that today only five white families live in the project whereas five years

ago5O percent of the project was white.
_This was where Jerry Newson lived in the fall of 1949. This was the

community that was destined to be shaken by the Newson ‘case. The drug

store murders were to have a profound effect on Harbor Homes.

CHAPTER iv

‘Police Baffled

The veryifirst newspaper stories telling about the brutal drug store slay-i

» ings also quoted the police_as being "baffled.” The police admitted they were

at aloss. They had no clues. Their best judgment waswthat two persons com-

mitted the crimes. One paper said one of the two fatal .45 slugs found-at

the scene was flattened beyond recognition. , -
"This made it impossible,” said the paper, "for police to determine

whether the two slugs were fired from the same gun, or whether two guns ‘ ,

were used.”

_ In a later edition the same paper said, " . . ._because of the identical’

positions in which the guns must have been held (at the time of firing),

police believed two people did the shooting.”

In still another paper, the headlines read," "Police Ask Citizens to Help

Solve Drug Store Execution.” The same paper said, '-' . . .the wanton drug‘

store slayers left no fingerprints.”
This brutal murder had taken place in the heart of the Negro community,

at a time when the Civil Rights Congress and other organizations were -re- 

questing that a committeeof the state legislature be sent to Oakland and
investigate a police department that had committed countless acts of brutality
against Negro and other minority citizens. V . .
More than that, each edition of the newspapers carried. news of ‘a new
murder, "Taxi Driver Kills Girl Friend in Alameda,” "Berkeley Man Kills

' Wifeein Jealous Rage," "East Oakland Girl, 15, Kills Mother With Butcher-

knife." .
While this was going on, there was little doubt in the minds of West

Oaklanders that the newspapers and the police would single the drug store ‘

murders out for special attention. One paper had already begun to infer that
the slayers were Negroes. Not one of the paperstold its readers that one of

T the slain victims was a Negro. As tension mounted, rumors spread that
-roundups and arrests were on the way.

Two days following the -murders, the police threw out their dragnet.‘

Restaurants, beer parlors, -pool hallsiand every conceivable place where people

might gather within the immediate vicinity of the drugstore were searched.

Hundreds -of people were questioned, many of them taken to jail and booked

for investigation. Every Negro who could not prove where he was on that
fatalsaturday night had suddenly become a murder suspect. ,
‘ People in the area had become silent about the whole thing. No, longer

‘a

C r was there poolroom speculation ‘as to how the murders were committed. The

slightest little peep. could easily land one in ‘jail. Even those wholhad been A‘
 arrested and released were not willing to talk about the murders or how they

were treated in jail. ~ ~ . l . _
But the terror dragnet that swept West Oakland did not yield the Oak-

W ' land police department a single suspect worthy of the name.
A‘ West Oakland remembered Andrew Hines,‘ a Negro cannery worker shot V
and killed by a patrolman named Spencer Amundsen on Easter Sunday, 1949.

West‘ Oakland remembered Melvin Cunningham,: a Negro beaten by police
untilhe was near death from a ruptured bladder. W’ est Oakland remembered
George V, McDaniels, a Negro gardener arrested and beaten for a burglary

A even the police admit now he had nothing to. do with.

The dragnet yielded nothing. But from another source came a chance for
the police to pin the murders onlsomeone. _ ,

Nine days before the murders, on October 13, there had been a ‘hold-up
in the office of the Harbor Homes project. The cops were working on it at
the time of the drugstore murders. They kept on working, ‘andon October

V 25, three days after the murders, they made an arrest.

‘The -arrestwas Jerry Newson, and ‘they had the -right man—for the Har-

"CHAPTER v

   .,;Stickup

At‘ 9 a. m. on October 25, 1949, three days after the drugstore murders,

two police inspectors, J’. J. Murphy. and John H. Strum, walked into a Broad- ‘_

way poolhall anditapped Jerry Newson on the shoulder.
"Come,with us. We want to ask you some questions?’-

The questions weren’t to be about the drugstore murders, however. Not
inthe beginning. . «T. '
The Harbor Homes holdup trail had led to Jerry Newson, and it was a

rather obvious trail. a

. The holdup had‘ taken place on October 13, nine days before the murder.
The holdup man had gotten away with $1275. ' J ' ,

During this period, Newson, whose only known source of income was his
shoeshine stand, paid $375 cash for a '58 Pontiac. He bought shoes, shirts
and several suits. Paid cash. He sold his 3550‘ wartime ‘watch for $20 and
bought another for $150. He bet large sums on pool. He, spent freely on
dates. His friends found it easy to borrow large amounts from him.

 , Such activities do not go unnoticed in West Oakland. There areithose  _

West Oakland who make their living passing just such information ‘along
to police. _ s - i
I ‘ i ‘So the cops tapped Jerry on the shoul'der——just 12 days after'the.sti'ckup a
o ' - Harbor Homes; Jerry admitted alrnostat on'ce‘Ih»’e haddone it. .1‘ ‘ L _
The cops weren't particularly interested" iniwhy. They had nefver: tried to , ‘
_ make a living shining shoes, but they did know they‘weren’_t dealingiwith ha  L ‘
1 A hardened criminal. Jerry couldn't have left *a’ more obviousitrail if he’d drawn f: 
arrows on_the ,si,deWalk._i ‘ " ‘ V ' ‘i. V‘ T ‘ " ‘ A’ .
 _ _ A Jerry had entered the rentoffice on October 13' in broad daylight wearing 
V‘; a loud colored shirt. Once in the office, hebrandished. an empty .45 auto- ’
V matic, belonging to his Uncle James, and ordered the money turned over to
him. He told polic'en_nen«later, ‘»‘I "forgot to? put th.e'.car.tri’dges in.”
\ He left‘ fingerprints, a. full hand print,':~-in fact‘,7on‘ the counter andseveral
other places. He then ordered threeof the ‘persons in the office to be bound
" with rope he hadbroughtfalong for the occasion, including a mailman, whb

  
 
   
 
   
  

happenedin while the stickup was inviprocess.  V ’ _

Then Jerry tied up the fourth person, Earl Beattie, i the manager, and
spent the next 10 minutes trying to escape through the rear of the "building
with his loot. After going into several different rooms and closets that led 

’ nowhere‘, he finally came back tothe office and asked" the manager, “Say, A 
how do you get out of ihis dang place?” ‘ ' I —  

When Jerry was first picked uptherdenied he useda -real‘ gun. Two days ,1.
later, when he confessed this too, he told 'the‘inspector_s, "I didn’tiwant_ to get

. my folks in trouble.” ‘ ‘ _ H V - -.
Then, during the course of questiontingfthe inspectors ‘discovered Jerry
was acquainted with the murdered Robert Savage and Marjorie Ruth Wilsoh.
ah i More than that, Jerry told his captors he had gone on "several", occasions and
 . _ “bought barbecue for Marjorie,” and had "shined Doc Savage’s shoesf’ ‘when
ii _ _ i he worked at a shine stand down the street from the drugstore. . ii
 ’ That did it. Things started happening, things that were to take Jerry 
 Newson to the death row at San Quentin. , t i
Jerry has never had a chance to explain to any of his friends just exactly . .‘
why he committed the Harbor Homes robbery. They can only guess at what  ‘L
motivated him from what they know of. his life. I g
, Jerry hasn’t denied the Harbor Homes robbery,‘ but he has denied’a'ny~ 
knowledge of the murders. He ‘has denied such knowledge constantly and  ' A
steadfastly. The record of his denial was to make interesting listening for ‘ii; ,
spectators jammed into a number of courtrooms. » ‘
Jerry Newson. was about to become a headline figure.

CHAPTER VI

Enter the Civil Rights Congress

"West Oakland Boothlack Linked to Execution," screamed a headline.
"Shoeshine Boy Held As Suspect in Twin Killings,” said another.
On October 27, they became more positive.
“Shoeshine Boy Confesses, ‘I Killed ’ern'.” "Lie Expeirt Draws Confes—
sion, ‘I Killed the Two of Them'.'’ .
The newspaper reading public, with a few notable exceptions, was ready
to write finis to the case»——and to Jerry Newson, wlrm up to this point and for
‘a while after was still referred to in the papers as Newso1n-—~~after_p the way
his uncle spells the family name. i " A '
17

 

 

,“Didn’t Kill Them. WV as Only Kidding’-."

 

   

On October 428, the papers carried a different story, a fresh angle, as the A _
city editors would say. "Bootblack Denies Killing Pair, ‘Was Only Kidding.” 
D i -‘; i.

As the newspaper headlines became more and more confusing, Hursel 5 C
Alexander, ‘then director of the East Bay Chapter of the Civil RightsiCong'ress,
said to a field representative, ‘Harry Avington, "You know Harry, something . e
is fishy about these headlines.” , , S A

"I. thought so too,” replied Harry. "I hate to think of the going over that ' ‘
kid's been getting." . V - ‘

'.‘You know,” said Alexander, "if the kid is guilty, we don't want to ff -
touch this case,.but I think we should check around where he lives" and see if
what we can learn about him." ’ , ’ 

A few minutes later, Harry was off to Harbor Homes. He found neigh- i
bors more than willing to tell what’ they knew. about Jerry Newson. "They u; —
all spoke well of him,” he reported. He learned that police had ransacked
nearly a dozen homes without even having ‘a search warrant, and many per-
sons had been hauled off to jail without the arresting officers telling them
what for. Among them were Newson’s aunt andikuncle. Then he struck hope-
ful news. Several teenagers told him they were with Jerry on the night of the 9 _
drug store murders, and that he (Jerry) was not near the place -at the time. 3
The police had fixed the time of the murder between 9 and 9:15 p. In. _ "H ”

On October'50, a Sunday, they let Sarah Newsom out of jail. She phoned
Robert Treuhaft, a Civil Rights Congress attorney. “Meet me at the city hall
in half an hour,”.Treuhaft told her. — S

For the first time since he had been arrested five days before, Jerry New— C.
son saw an attorney. - —  

His first words_ to Treuhaft were, "I don’t know whether I need a lawyer;
I-told them all about the Harbor Homes robbery the day they arrested me,.
and I didn’t'do the murders. So. what, do I need a lawyer for?”  _ 

Treuhaft looked at the smilit1gvNegro youth in amazement. "Haven’t j
you seen the newspapers? Don't you know you're the chief suspect in the 

 

 
 
 
  

 

 

murder case?” Newson didn’t know. _ .. v

Then he told Treuhaft how he had been placed in solitary‘ confinement,  , i

C _ from which he was removed only for purposes of questioning. He told how.  

he had been grilled "continuously for 18 hours and how he had been given ’}, r
only,onC tasteless bowl of mush during the entire period. ,  7 t

, _ When Jerry grew tired during the grilling and let his head nod "they hit   -
me under the chin with their knuckles and knocked my head against the wall.” j  - _

’, Jerry told about the so-called "lie detector” tests too, just as he wasto “ i

‘tell about them later at the trial. \

 _ ThelTribune quoted‘ District Attorney  Frank Coakley as saying, "I
believe my office and the police areas clean as a hound’s tooth in the way
we’ve handled this boy.” ' . ~ I A
 5 p Meanwhile, police criminologists were busy making ballis-tics checks be-
tween the Newson gun and the two fatal slugs. \ v V
 What they found and didn’t find was to be very important later.

j The First Round

, ' . The heat was on. Everyone who had been associated with Jerry Newson
; .was'under police suspicion. ., , .~ . _ 
'  On Thursday afternoon,Octotber 27, two plain clothesmen appeared at
 the personnel office of the Oakland airport and asked to’ see Lee Garrett
’ Evans, a teenage acquaintance of Newson’s. Evans workedlat the airport as a
maintenance man. The cops said Evans would be back in a couple of _ hours.
He was taken to jail and held for three days before he was even questioned.
 When'his mother came to ask if he was there, she was told, he wasn't.

A

_ $25 hat, threw it on the floor in front of him and stamped on ‘it, declaring,
1 ‘,'_It’s too good for you.” W/hen he went back to the airport he found he-didrft
have a job anymore. 7 . l _ O i ‘ _ ’. ~

apartment in order. _ , ,
Harris, a 21 year old orderly at the Oakland Veterans hospital, was- under

V suspicion as Newson’s accomplice.

This was the atmosphere of terror that CRC had uncovered.

And Chief of Police Lester  Divine boreno love for CRC. It had been a
thorn in his side in the Hines ‘case, the Cunningham case and the McDaniels
case. Somehow the “honor” ofhis department was now involved. Police
efforts to pin the murder on Newson redoubled. ‘ ' 

.But they werentdoing too well. Harris was released. They found twelx‘/lie

. .45 caliber cartridges in the trunk of Newson’s Uncleljames, but they weren't

of the same manufacture as the fatal slugs. Newson ‘was arraigned for the

Harbor Homes robbery on November 2. Policejudge Chris B. Fox set bail . if

at $5,000, but still there was no charge in the murder case.
- Then, on November 14, Treuhaft issued a public. challenge. He called on

‘Chief Divine to “charge Newson with murder or admit the police are simply ‘
. using him as a convenient scapegoat to cover up their own incoinpetencef ,
Divine said, ‘Tm not mad at Mr. Treuhaft. I don’t think I have to answer... .

any of his .challenges in the public press.” .
Treuhaft issued the challenge just two days after discovery of a dictaphone

placed in the attorney’s interview room at the jail by the police for the ads

mitted purpose of eavesdropping on Newson’s conversations.
Treuhaft added, “The district attorney does not recognize the fact that

the city jail is not police property. Innocent as well as guilty persons are held-

there, often dayswithout charges.
' "The right to be brought before a magistrate immediately after arrest is
an elementary legal requirement. Newson has been held three weeks- Yet

 he’s never been charged withthe drug store murder. This further demonstrates 3

the need for an investigation of the police department by the state legislature."

The next day, November 15, police announced they had "no evidence” to

hold Newson for the drugstore. murders. He was still in jail, unable to make
-$5,000 bailfor the Harbor Homes robbery, ‘but his, friends rejoiced. The
threat of amurder charge had apparently been removed. » T _

There was rejoicing, too, in Harbor Homes where things had begun to
ha en because of the Newson case.

Treuhaft said,""This‘iprovesthat the so—called confession they sweated.

out of Newson three. weeks ago was a monstrous fraud.”

"The big break in the ‘execution slayings on October _’22, of i an Oakland ,
druggist and his clerk came today,” the Tribune said, “as Assistant District _
Attorney Laurence Dayton disclosed that murder complaints would be signed. ‘-
against Jerry Newson and one of his West Oakland companions, ' Willie 

Harris, 21.

"The surprise move was taken on the basis of testimony of a mystery W

witness, an unidentified 17 year old girl. '
"The officers (Homicide Inspectors Joseph Bertoglio and Merle Long-

necker) said they found a girl who, fearful and reluctant, admitted she had A
seen Newson in the drug store and Harris just outside of the store, five
‘ minutes past nine on the night of the killing. '

‘ "The girl, shortly after noon today, picked Harris out of a special police
lineup _at the court house. Because of her fears, she was kept out of sight
during the identification.” . .

‘Then came another article in The Post-Enquirer right on the heels of the

Tribune’s. It said, “A giant electromagnet is sweeping the bottom of the

Oakland Estuary today as police‘ attempt to find the pistol they believe may
have been used in the ‘execution murder’ of two Oakland drug store em-.
ployees." . ‘ T

The article went on to say, “Search for the gun centers in the Estuary

T at the foot of Tangier Street near the Harbor Homes Housing Project.”
Meanwhile, a number of persons wondered what happened to the murder V

today to ascertain if 28 dollar bills changed for bills of higher denomina-
-tion at a West Oakland lunch counter mayhave been part of the loot taken
from the drug store in which a pharmacist and hisclerk were slain Oct. 22. .

"Twelve of the bills,” said the Chronicle, "were in a consecutive serial '-

Assistant District Attorney Laurence Dayton opened the prosecution’s case
by placing on the witness stand several policemen, the coroner -and the owner 1 
. of the drug store. ' — - ‘ " 1 
Then came the dramatic moment. Dayton called 17 year old Barbara’ 
Cruikshank to the stand.’ The cops had successfully kept Barbara a mystery  
alright. Asthe four-footnine-inch Negro girl strode into the court room, you l 
could hear a pin fall. _ _ V ‘ 
. i She testified that on the night of the murder she attempted to go in- the
 ,  drug store about 9:05 p. m., but the door was locked. She umped hen head
 1 against the door“ glass trying to enter. It was then she saw Jerry Newson
.   standing behind the prescription counter. A   B
7  _  ' Up untilnow, Dayton was all smiles. Barbara was telling her story just a  
"V B perfect. "Now, Barbara,” said Dayton, ‘_'I’ll ask you, when _was it, the first’ ,  
time you saw Willie Harris?” ‘ V l" '
"The Monday after (two days later)," replied Barbara. ’
"No,” Dayton informed her,  e are now speaking with regard-'to’7the
night of the murders, Barbara.” . 4 g  W «

¢

At this point the... defense interceded, "Your Honor, Miss Cruikshank does . e

not need her memory refreshed. She said very definitely that she didn’t see
defendant Harris that night.” Dayton finally gave up trying to persuade Bar-
bara to say she saw Harris, and Treuhaft began to cross-examine her.

Barbara had testified that she knew the time because ‘she “looked at their
clock” when she left home. She lives next door to the drug store. Treuhaft
began by asking her: _ ‘

"Does that clock keep ‘accurate time or does it run fast or slow?” .

"I couldn't say, but I know one thing. We had to put it in the shop a few
days later because it stopped running completely.” .

"So you can’t be sure what time it was, can you?"

"No.” '

"You said you saw a person when you bumped your head on the door
glass. How much of that person did you see?”

"I could see from the shoulders up.”«

"Can you describe thekind of clothing that person wore?”

"I do not know the kind or the color of the person's clothing.”

"Did the person wear a hat, a’ cap, or was he bare-headed?”

"I don't remember.” ’  . V

"You said when you bumped your head the person looked at you and you
saw his face. What kind of expression was on the person’s face when he
looked at you?” i i

"I don’t remember.”

Then Treuhaft asked the $64 question. "Barbara, on your oath before
God, could you truthfully and positively say that the person you saw in the
drug store that night was Jerry Newson?" ' ‘

"I can’t say.”

"You are unable to say?"

"That’s right.” .

"In other words, you did not make a close examination. You just took
a momentary look and walked on. Is that correct?” ‘ i

“That is correct.” ‘

The mystery witness, a high school student and ward of the juvenile

court, had blown up in the prosecution's face. The witness the prosecution

hoped would send Jerry Newson and Willie Harris to the gas’ chamber in

San Quentin had proven to be far from the star the district attorney had.

hoped for. V -
_ Dayton asked hurriedly for a continuance for another week to give the
prosecution a chance to get hold of some witnesses who were "out of town.”
. The continuance was granted. ‘
The next week Dayton "placed Albert E. Riedel on the witness stand.

Riedel is a police inspector for the city of Berkeley. He is the one who admin-

istered.the so-called "lie detector” test to Newson, and to whom Newson
was said to have‘"confessed” the killings. .

Riedel is a professional witness. He’s testified in hundreds of cases. He’s
been on.Berke1ey’s police force for 20 years, and it isn’t easy for a defense
counsel to tear holes in his story. e

In a fatherly manner, Riedel testified howl Newson was brought to his

office in Berkeley by Oakland inspectors and how he administered the test.
It was during the course of the test, said Riedel, that Newson confessed.

‘ "Yes, you’re right,” Riedel quoted Newson, "I killed him, I killed those

people.” 7 ,
The defense didnot succeed in shaking Riedel’s story at the preliminary
examination. But many wondered why the district attorney was using Riedel’s
story now when he had thrown it out two months before when police an-
nounced they had “no evidence" to hold Newson. ’
There were those also who remembered newspaper stories about how

~Riedel’s "lie detector” device had failed when demonstrated to students at

the University of California.
The preliminary examination came to an end. In California, only a bare

indication of possible guilt is necessary for a lower court judge to hold a.

defendant to answer for trial. in superior court.‘ ,

Judge Fox ordered that Jerry Newson be held to answer in superior court
on the charge of murder. ~

But, in the case of Willie Harris, there wasn’t even a bare indication of

association with the crime on the basis of the testimony at the preliminary -

examination.’

Judge Fox granted a defense motion dismissing the murder charge against
Harris. He was a free man, and the crowd in ‘the courtroom took some conso-
lation from the fact. i . .

But when Harris was released he found he’d lost his job as an orderly at
the Veterans Hospital. The official reason given by F.  Newhall, acting
personnel‘ officer, was, "Conduct unbecoming a government employee, im-
plication in a major crime.” , ' V

When it was brought to Newha’ll’s attention that Harris had been exon-
erated of any connection with the crime, the personnel officer replied:

'-‘Since . . .‘Mr. Harris . . . has been completely exonerated . . . therefore i

the cause of removal is incorrect. We wereon the verge of separating .Mr.
Harris for inefficiency» theisecond time he was put in jail."
Harris’ high efficiency record was produced, but it was to no avail. He
was through at the hospital. ’
The case was entering‘ a new-——and tough—phase.

' ,, g ; ‘The word about the.Newson case was spreading. ‘

A Newson-Harris Defense Committee had been ‘established.’ Its secretary
was Mrs. Vera Smith, aclose friendof the Harris family. Early in the pro-
ceedings it collected $}25———mostly in dimes and quarters—to help meet trial
«expense. j. V .  i _ ~ . ,

TCRC hada weekly-radio program over Station KTIM. The story of the
Newson casewas told over and over. The word came that in dozens of Negro A
churches throughout the Oakland area, ministers were mentioning the New- T
son-Harris case. ' ,5 _ V j

The case was no longer the subject of lurid headlines in the commercial
, press, but it was the subject of discussion-and work in-Oak1and’s Negro and
progressive community. A . 1 V»

During the first week .of January, 1950, almost at the moment» when
Judge Fox Qrdered'Newson held to answer, the state assembly interim com-
mittee on crime and correction was drawing .its long-promised‘ Oakland ‘hear-
ings on police brutality to a close. _ , ' A . ‘ A l e ‘

The Hines,‘ the Cunninghamland the McDaniels cases, and many others,
had been placed in‘ the record intdetail. Chief Divine rushed scores of cops
to the witness stand in. an effort to refutethe things being said abouthis
department. ‘ p I V j T _

The committee’s report was cautious, but it couldn’t_duck entirelythe
weight of evidence placed before it. It found "some degree of truth exists"

\ in the complaints of citizens made before the committee and called "prejudice 7
«--against minority racial groups” by police "regrettable.” _
 More “ and more persons began to view the Newson case as part of the t
. «pattern of the Oakland police department"s brutal treatment of the city’s
 V * l,N,egro population. The fact the district attorney’s office was going to con-

’ " tinue with the prosecution despite the failure of its key witness to place
Newson at the scene of the crime was regarded as significant confirmation of
this fact; ' ‘ e T. ‘ _ - s
In this atmosphere preparations for the trial of Jerry Newson were com-

ipleted.

A The Trial Opens

On the morning of April 24, in department. seven of the Alameda county

' court house, overlooking beautiful Lake Merritt, Jerry Newson’s trial opened

before Judge Donald K. Quayle. —  I

It . had been a hectic three and a. half months since’ the preliminary
examination. The defense tried to anticipate the strategy of the prosecution.
Rumorwas the district attorney was going to move heaven and earth to get
a conviction. It was election year. ‘ T

' There were 600 men and women, mostly Negroes, waiting in the fifth .
V floor. cprridor to get into the courtroom that April morning. Listening to

their conversation at random, one could easily .conclude that few of the

spectators believed a jury would convict Jerry on the kind of evidence the

D.A. had presented before Judge Fox. - _ r f
Inside the courtroom, however, there was an atmosphere that boded any-

i thing but a fair trialfor a Negro. The Negro spectators, who during the.

trial occupied most of the 64 seats in Judge Quayle’s court, were herded and

e shoved around summarily by bailiffs from Sheriff H. P. Gleason’s office. One

bailiff, named Plotz, was part-icularly zealous in his policing of the Negro
spectators. ‘ i 

And he became more zealous as the trial wenthon. One morning he de- ’

manded of several Negro women, “Why aren’t you home feeding your

babies?" or, "I bet you 'haven’t washed your dishes this morning.”

Once he addressed himself to the whole crowd. "Why don't you people
stay home? This boy is going to get a fair trial.” ‘ _
Atthe prosecution table‘ that morning sat Dayton, the same deputy that
had‘ handled the preliminary examination. With him was another deputy,
John S. Cooper. With Treuhaft was his law partner, Bertram Edises, who

was also a candidate for district attorney on a civil rights platform, directed"

against the brutality record of the Oakland police department.

' ». The business of picking a jury that was to decide the fate of Jerry Newson i
 began.'The class composition‘ of the jury panel was not encouraging. The&

were business executives, middle class housewives, and no one from West

Oakland. ’ .
It took two and one-half days to pick a jury of .four men, eight women

and two alternates, of which only one, a woman, was a Negro.  panel,

of 52 was exhausted. Of the three Negro women on the panel, two were

excluded for_"notrbelieving in the death penalty.”

Cooper opened the prosecution’s case by telling the court the prosecution
would "prove, to amoral certainty and beyond all reasonable doubt that

Jerry Newson killed Robert Savage and Marjorie Wilson.” Cooper promised

to produce "eyewitness testimony” during the course of the trial.

Now, just as before, the D. A; began his case by putting on the stand
minor witnesses. Only this time he brought the slain woman’s brother, a
Reverend Mitchell, to the stand. Rev.’ Mitchell testified his sister was alive

' in _"good health”. theplast time he saw her, which was about a week before

vi her death.

The trial was several days old now. Dayton and Cooper had handled the:

~ case, so far, very confidently. They acted as though a surprise would cinch

their case most any minute. Newspapers were still billing Barbara for the

,"atar” role. But.everyone was certain that something was in the air,

 C CHAPTER xn
. IX Stoolpigeoii

On May l, the eighth day of trial, Dayton and Cooper strolled in court,

greeted the judge and ‘smiled at the jury, just asthey had done frornthe out-

set. When the judge declared» court. in session, Dayton, in a soft tone of voice,
told a.- court attache, . . .‘ "Bring in the next witness.”

,' In walked a Negro, about 30, whose face bore several long knife scars.
He swore that he would ‘.'tell the truth and nothing but the truth,” and
gave his name-as Herlin-»]. C. Jackson.’

ye Dayton lost no time in '‘qualifying’’ Jackson as witness. -
A “Mi: Jackson, you are at present a prisoner‘ in the State Prison at San »

Quentin, is that right?"
"Correct." C - 1 i

"Serving a term for forgery and a prior conviction of auto theft, is that

right?” 7 - '
“Correct.”

‘  - Jaclrson went on to  that, when Newsoh twas/transferred.‘ t0 the

other prisoners. Jackson said Newson "confessed" to him that he (Newson)
phad'{"beat the lie detector,” was sure. that nobody could find‘ the (murder)
gun,‘ and the girl (Barbara) that was with him knew how to"*'keep her-
mouth shut.” — .  , ; - I ‘

Then Dayton offered to enter into the court record a note which he
termed a "memorandum” providedby Jackson. ]ackson decla‘red”that°be’fore

he was sent to San Quentin, he had written down on paper, in :Newson’s -

presence, their conversation. ’ V

Despite the fact that prosecution had argued Newson was —a "clever" and
"cold-blooded” killer, and that he was aware that he was soon jto,st"and. trial

' for his own life, Dayton now pleaded with theijury to believe Jerry would,

and did, glibly “conf_ess"’ while Jackson wrote down every word.

D'id_ Jackson have a motive’ for this? " . . .“0h, .1. just thought it was a
"very bad case.‘ So I just wanted to help solve it. That’s all.” But, un'der'cross-
examination, Treuhaft brought out ]ackson’s real motive: , ' '- ‘
d “Did you talk to anybody about your testimony before coming hereto-
ay_>"_ ‘ ~ . _ . . . , . V

'.‘No, I didn't.” _ . «

' “When you were brought here from San Quentin,‘ you didn’t know where
you were going or what for. Is that right?” - ’ ~
“I most certainly did not.”

"Cor_rec_t.” . _ I _. :
"How many of these statements do you have of other prisoners?’f F _ A.
"About{15,000 of them." V L ‘ .

"Now, isn’t it trueyou are collecting these statements becauseyou are a
stoolpigeon?’:- A murmer ran through the audience. The (bailiff had‘ to ‘rap
for order. “ L ‘ I p  . i _ .

"Just-a minute,” _interceded Dayton. "I ‘object to that ks incompetent,

irrelevantand immaterial, and not proper cross examination."

“Sustained,” said Judge Quayle.
Treuhaft didn’t give up. ,_ I - . v
, “But you do think these statements you have on other priseners will help
you at a later date,,is that right?" - . . . _ i_ i t_ , _ ‘ -
"Maybe they will.” ' p I 5 ’ _ , ’_ ,
Jackson admitted he had been in jail more times thanhe could recall~a_t
the moment. He listed his crimes as severalcounts of grand theft, and carry-

’ ,';ing a "co,nc'ealed weapon, plus, violation of probation. Also several charges-

Over a storm of protest from defense attorneys, Judge ‘Quayle legalized

die prosecution’: new tactics. Ihe jury “was ushered‘  again, ' and Dayton ’ ‘

began. _
. By now, jerry had been tried and convicted for the Harbor Homes rob-
bery, and was awaiting the five to fourteen year mandatory sentence that

. went. with it. But this made’ no difference with the judge. He permitted the

Show to go on.’ i j V V - p , .
Dayton re-enacted the Harbor Homes robbery and the trial that followed.

- He brought into a court a middle-aged blonde who _said she was .a bookkeeper

in the rent office and was present on the day of the stickup.

" . . . is this the gun he used?”

‘Dayton waved the big ugly gun before the jury and asked his witness,‘

"Yes, that looks like it alright,” sh'esaid.‘Then she mumbled, ‘PI-Ie point- I .

ed the gun at me and snapped the trigger twice.” This was calculated to

‘create the impression for the jury that Newson was trigger-happy, and to
him, taking ' a, life meant very little. Or, how- else could the prosecution
; ."prove” that Jerry was “capable.” . L. , «

‘  Meanwhile, the mass campaign, to» save Newson was continuing. Collec-
tionilists were passed around the courtroom daily. Almost $100,was collected

this way; ,

But Mrs. Pauline Jordan, mother of Willie Harris, havingllistened to the

proceedings of the trial for several days, felt that still more could be done.

She ‘sat down and wrote a letter which CRC mailed to nearly all the
churches" and organizations in the East Bay. The letter read in part, " . . /. As
1 mother please allow me to tell you my experience in regard to the attempt

to frame my son and ask your -help for another youngpman facing the same

kind of frame-up.” '

Having explained the trial, Mrs. Jordan concluded, "You can help by
setting aside a prayer for Jerry Newson and attend this trial and see and

hear for yourself the truth about what is happening to this poor child.” *  L

, But little did ‘this affect courtroom atmosphere. Dayton was still whack-
ing away with his new set of theories. He drew the jury’s attentionto the fact
that a ‘.45 was used in both crimes, u that the "most convenient time was
chosen” for both stickups, and likewise the “motive was money” and in his
opinion, Jerry “entered and escaped the same way at both_places.” .

Dayton told the jury Jerry was not making enough money shining shoes \

 to "meet his extravagant needs.” And, he said, tlieﬁdefendant was “fa‘rni1iar"»

with both the Harbor Homes rent office and the .Rose-Waterman drug store

 at 77th and Adeline. After all, he said, these two places are in "the ".'same 4 ,‘
’v-ici ”7  ' " A ' W  L 

nriyr‘    g I

at  

and every night of the week he was out some place on the streets.

Then it occured to the prosecution Jerry Newson did not lead ‘the  D

. of community life familiar to members of the middle class jury. qW'hy,( he  ii

frequented poolrooms and gambling places and not the more ‘wholesome

places of recreation in the community. . .
As proof of this, Dayton read 86 legal-size typewritten pages of ques-

tions and answers put to Jerry whenhe was undergoing; the third degree by

-Coakley and others. They asked Jerry every conceivable question abouthis; ’

background. They discovered that Jerryhdid not eat regular meals at times,

Moreover, the jury learned through Dayton, Jerry had no fixed habits
about what time he went to bed at night and of all things, he often went

around with as many as three girl friends at a time, and to boot, he had no -

hobbies. . .

This phase of the prosecution's case continued for two days.’ When they‘  ‘D

had finished, even experienced newspapermen, were confused as to whether

Jerry was being retried for the Harbor Homes robbery or.the drug store

murders.

Riedel, who was to make a total of three trips to the stand for the prose- it

cution, was brought in again. His act wasthe same as before.

All the material the prosecution was now using, was in their possession  V
when they first dropped the charges against Newson. ‘Defense attorneys 

arguedthat this kind of "evidence” was not "-permissable in a court of law.”
. . . It was "prejudicing the case,” and “the damage done to the mind of the
jury would be.irrepar,able.” But the judge casually dismissed the ‘matter de-

claring, he would order the jury to "strike from their minds’-’ any and all ,
~"non-permissable” stuff when thejcase was handed them. i r _

Jerry, who had sat quietly at the defense table through’ the early days‘ '
of the trial, was finding out how wrong he had been when he thought he ”

had only the Harbor Homes robbery to worry about.

It

The defense was -to strike body blows at the prosecution’s common]

scheme and design”theory, but to many observers the damage was done the
day the judge allowed‘ the jury to hear anything about Harbor Homes.

fireworks left. i '

flipped a coin at the last minute to determine whetherhe should testify."

' Not that the doctor was not one of their star Witnesses, butthe suddeness
with which they rushed him into court-‘indicated a hasty decision. Kirk
made his entrance like a traveling salesman, carrying 3.; suitcasein one hand,
and, charts andgphotographs in the other. e , « '

Kirk is a short man, "around five feet tall and ‘looks to be about 45*.‘ He

“gave his occupation as a teacher of criminology at the University of Califor-

nia. He is saidto be one of the highest paid technical witnesses in these parts.
Dayton spent the better part of an hour qualifying Kirk as a firearms
"expert.” The doctor-took full advantage of every opportunity to wave before

. the jury another, and still another, university degree. a

The prosecution and the judge went out of their way to accord Kixlt the
greatest; courtesy. Kirk could interrupt judge and prosecution in the middle

l of. sentences, only to be greeted with a« polite “-pardon'me doctor, go ahead

please.” 3 . . I .

CHAPTER XVI

A The Defense Takes Over.

The defense began its side of the case without fanfare, and there was _

little in the first day of methodical. assault upon the carefully constructed
case of the prosecution that indicated the sensational later developments that
were in the making. ., ' ‘ .

A Calmly and carefully Defense Attorneys Treuhaft and Edises began the
job of refuting every major point of the prosecution, of presenting the case
upon which the fight for Jerry Newson’s life rests today.

The first witnesses called were Reba Fuller and Hattie Louise Johnson,

twoeteenage acquaintances of Newson’s. They testified thatgaround 9:05 on O

the night of the murder," Jerry and Lee Garrett Evans picked them up in
Newson’s car at Harbor Homes while they were waiting for a bus and drove
them to the drug store corner at Seventh and Adeline Streets. i
“We got out at the corner,” said Reba, “and Jerry and Evans drove off
toward town in the opposite direction‘ of the drug store.” Although the
prosecution had theorized Jerry entered the store "right at closing time

' (9 p.. m.),” Dayton practically ignored Miss Fuller's testimony _on .cross- .
A . examination. \

Lee Garrett Evans was called next. He gave his age as_ 20, and also
listed a,'Harbor Homes address. Perhaps better than all .others,«Evans knew_
what hell Newson was put through, because he too, 'was arrested and_ held

 

 

for the same crime when the copsthrew out their dragnet. Not only did they -

keep him in iail for five days but he suffered the loss of his civil service
job at the Oakland airport. His attitude on the stand reflected his resent:
ment at the treatment he had received. K - A
Evans "told the jury that the was with Newson on the night of the
murders “continually from around 8:20 p, in. until about mid-night.”
“Newson was never out of my sight,” said Evans, "and we never went in
or stopped near_ the drug store.” Evans listed the places they visited that
night, gave the names of people present, and the time he and Jerry were there.

 

Despitethe fundamental importance of Evans’ testimony, the prosecufion -

practically ignored him when it came their turn to cross-examine. . _
Evans testified in support of Newson despite an earlier warning by police
that ‘he was “sticking his neck in a noose” by corroborating Newson’s conten-

A tioni-he c1idp’t go to the drug store on the night of October 22.

    

Then came a Mrs. Owens, a landlady of Evans’ aunt, who told how Lee
and Jerry came to her house between 8:45 and 9:15 lookingfor the aunt.

. Next,.Wil1ie Harris took the stand.sThis World War II veteran withi-8 if

V He told the jury that he met Newson and'Evans about 9:30 that night‘ '
.“and stayed with them until they retired around midnight." Just like
Evans, Harris-declared they "never stopped at or near the drug store that
night.” Again, the prosecution had no questions for Harris.
The basic framework of Newson’s time alibi had been established, but
there was much more to come.

CHAPTER _><V!l

Major Break

In most murder trials the testimony of the defendant is a high point. Not
so in the case of Jerry Newson. The testimony of other witnesses was to
overshadow that of Jerry himself. I
Not that ]erry’s testimony wasn’t dramatic, During his 50 minutes on the
witness stand hemet head on the prosecution charge he had "confessed” the
murders. It was simply that later developments eclipsed ]erry’s‘ own quiet,
confident performance on the stand. I I
A Jerry told the jury he never “confessed” to Riedel, that he was merely
telling Riedel where to "get off.” “He fastened me in the chair (lie dectector ‘
chair). Then he started asking me questionsabout my family background. I
answered his questions. Pretty soon he asked if I killed them (drug store
victims)‘. I told him ‘No’." _ 7 i «’ ‘
"Then he kept on asking me and I kept saying ‘No.’ Then he stopped
asking me and started tellingeme I did. I just sat there and looked at him.
Then he got close up_ in my face and shaking his finger, and shouting, ‘You
killed them.’ I guess he said that about -20 times. So I got mad and shouted’ ’
back, ‘alright so you want me to burn, don’t you?’ — I i j
_ _"Then he got real mad. He stood back from me, and walked tojthe door
. and ‘let newspapermen in. «They -took pictures and he walked over to me and
’ asked,‘ ‘Would you like to tell me more about it?’ I told him I ‘didn't know

anything about who killed those people. Then. he let me out of the chair.”

Riedel had‘ testified that no one was present when Jerry was .supposed _to\

V have “confessed” to, him. No recording of any kind was made. The jury
had only Riedel’s word as against }erry’s. I 
jelerry also scoffed at“the “confession” reported by Jackson. He said jack-

son was known widely as a stoolpigeon and that no prisoner in his rightvrnind
would "confess” to him. . -

This was pretty much the situation on May 10. The defense had account-
ed for Jerry's whereabouts on the night of the murder. It had challenged the
prosecution’s “confession.” claims; Only one major part of the prosecutiotfs
case stood uncontrad.icted——the all-important ballistics testimony of Dr. Kirk.

During the noon -recess on May 10, with the prosecution about to take
over for the summing up, word reached the defense lawyers that the Oakland
police department's own criminologists———outraged at the pat certainty of Dr.
Kirk's testimony~———were willing to testify on. the ballistics aspects of the case,
even though their findings might prejudice the case of their own. department.

Judge Quayle allowed a recess until the next day, and the defense lawyers
rushed into night long preparation for this new, and unexpected phase of
the case“

CHAPTER xv: H

Body Blow

On May 11, a slender man stepped in the witness stand. He looked to be
around 30. He gave his name as Patrick W’. Fuller. He said he had worked
i as a_ criminologist in the Oakland police laboratory since 1945. A ’

.Having been qualified as. a firearms identification expert, Fuller told
the jury how he and his associate, john D. Davis had spent nearly 100
hours examining the Newson gun, and how they had been unable to deter-
mine this was the gun used in the drug store murders.

He told the jury that a “bullet fireda from'any gun of the same manu-
facture would have some of the same characteristic markings. After firing 15
test shots and comparing them with the fatal bullets,” he said, “not a single
one matched.” l

The. jury was to learn from_.F‘uller that not only did he and his associate
spend long hours examiningthe gun, but Francis X. Latulipe, criminologist
for the police department of San Francisco, also examined the gun for three
days. Latulipe is recognized in thegfield by experts as one of the world’s best.

“Latulipe,” said. Fuller, "expressed no opinion.” Apparently the prosecu-

A ‘ tion did a lot of shopping around before they found the _willing Dr. Kirk.

: Moreover, Fuller declared, “I visited Dr. Kirk’s laboratory when’ be e_x-,

‘ pressed a positive opinion. ‘

"1 asked him then, is this the best you can show me? I told him- we had
made better matches than that but they had all proven false under further

' examination." » V D ’ - ‘ ~.” ‘A

Edises directed Fuller’s attention to the ink markings on Kirk's photo-
graphic display. _“Is this standard practice," Edises asked.

' . With a side arm gesture without even bothering to look at the display,
Fuller wryly smiled,- “It is unheard of. We never would have brought -those .
into court." , ‘ '" i ll 9 ‘ A 

Edises called Davis to thestand. Davis has been in charge of p the police
laboratory since 1944. He also felt pretty bitter about the way his superiors
were handling things. v ' 1 H _ t ' V A ‘

Cautious not to step on toes, Davis hinted that attempts "had been made,
to pressure him into bringing in a “positive opinion of the gun” even though,

,__'in fact, ‘the tests didn't show it. just as Fuller,’ Davis" too hadvisited Kirk’:

__ laboratory and_ observed the doctor’s best matches of fatal and test slugs.
it 7 T  “X/‘hat did you think of what you saw there,”-asked] Edises? s
 4   told‘ him.” declared, Davis, "that his conclusion was only ou‘r~,be- . L

    
 

   

ginning. And, I was not convinced at whatl saw." ' a _-
Despite die fact Fuller had testified for the prosecution as a firearms‘

. expert in important cases, and Davis has prepared evidence that placed many
a man behind bars, Dayton now tried to play down their testimonyas being
inferior to that of Kirk’s. ‘ ' .— ._ . j

Having opened a major breach inthe prosecution’: a1l—important ballistics
Case, the defense now expected the prosecution would have to return‘ Dr.
Kirk to the stand to try and close the gap. ‘ ' .

Eagerly, Edises prepared‘: list of questions toask the doctor. . .

V Why hadnft theﬂdoctor looked -at the tests conducted by the others? Why
was there a three month lapse between the time the doctor claimed he decided
there was a match and the time he made his photographs? Why didrft he
warn. the jury hot to attempt to draw conclusions from -the phoitggraphs? .
What did the doctor mean by the ink lineson his photographs? i

But Edises never‘ got a chance to ask Dr. Kirk these quest.ions—-or any
others. The prosecution didn't recall him to the stand. Edises was to exploit
this point in his final argument before the jury. ~

CHAPTER xix

' The Summation

Now the time had come for the summation, the drawing together and
adding up of the evidence presented by both sides. -
Cooper was opening for the prosecution. He was on his feet telling ‘
the jury that Newson-—-.-the quiet, teenage youth at the defense table-was is
"calm, cool killer.” - ' '
:He told how Jerry needed money. "You have to understand how he
thinks. You have to imagine what goes on in this man’s.pmind.” He called.
for the death penalty andtold the jury it was its duty to find Newson. guilty.
Tlreuhaft was leadoff man for the defense. He told the jurythat the
prosecu'tion’s,case had been reduced to mere "circumstantial evidence." Hi
reminded the jury that when a case is built on circumstantial evidence, the ~. /-
uw: requires that -every link in that chain of circumstantial evidence must be _
proven to a moral certainty’ and beyond all reasonable doubt. "And your
decision,’ -he concluded, "must carry with it an abiding conviction.” ' _' ’  — 
And then Edises, an attorney who had argued orally before the. United  ,
States Supreme Court, arose to. conclude the defense surmnation. ’» .  »  , 
__VHe declared the drug store murders were "shocking and iriidefensiblef i ' V

but he reminded the j

and demanded‘"noth_ing less than the extreme‘ penalty” for the guilty party, ' H‘

o

and convicted at any cost and by any means.” . . .

He called to the minds of the jurorsuthe rule that a person is presumed
to be. innocent until proven guilty . . i. "the great- presumption‘ of innocence
thatsits with thedefendant.” ‘ - . . '

He reminded the jurors ‘it is better that 10 guilty persons should escape
rather than one innocent person should be condemned. , 1

.'‘If I were to try and imagine any crime greater than murder," Edises
continued, "it would be the reckless or careless handling, or the destruction of

those great guarantees of our personal security which stand between us, be-

tween. all oflus, and ‘arbitrary arrest, conviction and punishment. And no

-higherwresponsibility rests upon the court, upon ‘the jury, upon the prosecu-
‘ tion, and upon the defense than to guard well and carefully’ those fundamen-

A the, prosecution had withheld evidence. That was to come later.

tal guarantees. ,They are the very things, ladies and gentlemen, that dis-
tinguish. civilized human existence from savagery.” _ “ ii
He charged there had come a time in the police handling of the drug
store murders “where the matter ceased to be investigation, ceased to be that
at all, and where all search for the two criminals ceased.” V
It then became’ "an attempt to build a case to prove the guilt of a par-
ticular suspect .and to suppress all evidence which would not point inthc
direction of the guilt of this one suspect.” L .
When Edises said this to the jury, ‘he ‘didn't know the extent to whic
A Carefully,- and in detail, Edises reminded the jury of_ the testimony prov-
ing the innocence of Jerry Newson. ‘ _ '
Lee Garrett Evans had testified he was in Newson’s company from 8:30
p. m. to midnight and they at no time went to the drug store.

ury this did not mean “a victim must be found, tried,»

He emphasized "the fact that not a-single reliable witness” placed New-i

son in the drugstore on the night of the murders. . ,
He pointed that the defense "found it necessary to resort to . . . testi-

vs .

imony about a prior robbery"_ in its effort to prove guilt by "a common plan

if ‘ . way constructed by the prosecution. ’

or scheme."

«All they _.were able to show, he said, "were elements which would. have
' -[been present in any armed robberies, absolutely any armed robberies———unless
they were‘ committed by a person who had succeeded in makinghis escape
from Napa without proper release.” ~ i * -’
' He called ‘attention to the "utter unreliability of their key wit_nesses”-
~ Barbara Cruikshank and J. C. Jackson. He reminded the jury of "the multi- ,
tude of other possible ways” the crime could have been committed than’ the

 s.     if ' "T41

Hexernphasized the "incredible -lack of a shred of reliable. physical ipevi-ii‘ _.   T.

dence, including fingerprints” linking Newson with the ‘crime. '

He reminded the jurors of the "strange matter” of calling witnesses "with 

thegleast familiarity with certain facts” and of. not calling witnesses "who

were best qualified to testify about certain things that they (the prosecution): H
regard, as‘irnportant.” This was an obvious reference to the calling of. 

Kirkin the place of the Oakland police department’s own criminologists. He

commented on the prosecution’s failure ‘to bring Dr. Kirk back to the stand g

andjlisted the questions he would have asked him. _ .

A "And don’t forget their extraordinary attempt‘ to take an oral statement,
an alleged oral statement of the defendant, and to pass it off as a_ genuine
confession——particularly in ‘view of the consistent denials before and after the
alleged confession.A.'. . " V. ’ V 3 .- _ ~ .  i 

.gHe reminded the jurors that -"the penalty here is sornething that cannot
be undone”‘and told them, "if you make a mistakefyour mistake will be
unforgivable.’," ’ A

Then he concluded: T j _ V _ T

_ "So with this, I now placethe life of Jerry Newson in your hands, in the
absolute confidence, ladies and gentlemen that you will treat his life with
the. same dignity and with the same seriousness thatjyou would treat the life
of the most. important person in the world, or that yhu would treat your own
life, for the life of some one dear to you——if they were the ones who were
here involved." '. g . T . ' V

. Newson was jubilant. He embraced Edises, but his confidence in the
jury: was to prove misplaced.»

We Cannot Rest

Jerry Newson went to.death.row.in San Quentiniwhere’ he is‘ today,‘ but
the f_ight,to_save ‘his life is more vigorous than it ever. was. '4

It wasa shocked N_egro community that heard the Newson verdicrfl

‘Every Neoro in Oakland knew that if Jerry Newson’s skin had been

‘white, he never would have been convicted. .
“I have‘ tried many criminal cases,” Edises said later, "and I have never
seenfa case where there was more ‘reasonable doubt.’ If Jerry had been white
~. they never would. have convicted him in a million years. ii‘ A L i e
 'n{‘é verdict was the greatest single‘ topic of conversation in W/est’ Oak-
land-. Hundreds of. persons,: especially Negro women, flocked to the Civil W i
Rights Congressoffices to see what they could do. ' t
l" The Newson case was mentioned more and more frequently in Negros
. churches. lMost of these circulated officially a petition. to ]udge’Quayle de—

l manding it new trial. Harry Avington, Negro warehouse worker, s"penr..the
entire two ‘weeks’ of his vacation working full time organizing the petition
campaign. i .r v ' * ] ‘ 4 ‘

Meanwhile, the legal campaign was’ not being neglected. V _  _
:Five days after the’jury’s verdict, a petition was on file before Judge 
Quayle asking that a new trial be granted. A _ , H  ,‘
_ _The petition pointed out that (a) Judge Quayle had misinstructed t_he77
jury on points of law, b) new evidence had been‘ discovered by the defense
that‘ pointed to ]erry’s innocence and (C) one of the jurors had taken infor;
inationpbtained outside the courtroom into the jury room during delibera- “
txions. ‘ v » a  A e’ ,. A’ _ ' ’ if V’
The two -latter grounds -were on the sensational side, although the news-
r ,papers~didn’tget too excited about/them. i r

The new -evidence fitted’ into what Ed‘ es. was talking about when hetold

thee  in his closing argument‘ that the prosecution had withheld. evidence.
.y~favo§lable to Newson /in order to buildca ‘case against him‘. i .

it speculation in the Negro community-——Mrs. Logwood, the lone Negro mem-
ber. ’ . . a .
It cameto light after she expressed doubts about the justice of the verdict“ e .
to a newspaper reporter. V , ‘ i N 0 “ .
T The reporter described_Mrs. Logwood as "haggard and dazed” ‘when I
he visited her a few days after thetrial. The young housewife admitted» _
she had been physically ill from worry over the outcome of the case. ' T
The interview disclosed that Mrs. Logwood was the only reason the jury
remained out 12 hours. She was the holdout, and the only holdout. The jury
was, in fact, on the verge of beinglockedu up for the night when Mrs. Log-0' _
wood capitulated——_on assurances of the other jurors that "if we make ya miss-t  _
take, Judge Quayle will grant a new trial.” ' A A if .«
‘ This, however, was not the basis of the defense motion for a new atrial.
_ Mrs. Logwood admitted she read newspaper ,acc‘ounts‘of the ‘case nightly,
indirect violation of the judges instructions. Furthermore, sheadmittedi dis-
cussing the case nightly with her husband, also-in violation of the judge’:
instructions. ’ V ’ ' ‘ ’
In fact, since the affidavits of jurors are not generally
cases, it was an affidavit by her husband,’ Harold,
a formed the basis of the defense challenge.
He admitted he had discussed the case with his wife each night and had;
in fact, contributed in at least two instances to her ultimate decision to vote.‘ '
for conviction. T . ' ' V 7 '  T '  "
\ She admitted frankly that her opinions, as the only Negro on’ the j_ury',.‘W

Support" for Newson, however, was coming not only from the Negro
community and labor unions..A group of women living in the wealthy section
of Berkeley staged a barbecue and fair, and raised $260 for Newson’s defense. »
All white audiences endorsed the contention this was a threat tothem. also.
The petitions and other pressure on judge Quayle were to no immediate r
avail, however. On Friday, June 2, he denied the defense motion for anew ‘ ’
trial, thus placing the case before the state ‘supreme court on appeal.  _
,CRC pointed out that the nine Scottsboro Boys would have died longv
ago if people fighting for their freedom had quit because of the judge's
“contempt” ruling. Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram and her two sons now in a Georgia a a
‘prison would have also died if people had followed the judge's Wishes, said

calling in this land of Lincoln? Need any active trade unionist—-Negro, G

white, Chines_e~American, Filipino, Mexican-American—-be told about name-
calling in this land of Jefferson? ‘

The Reverend Joseph Johnson of St. John's Church in Vallejo, Calif.,
in closing one of his meetings asked the blessing of God‘ for the CRC. "Long
may it live and grow. . . . " he .prayed. The good Reverend told his audience:

"Support CRC, and don’t run whensomebody shouts ‘Communist!’ Any- _
thing you get you’ll have to fight for it. If Christ were living today, he too _  -
. would be called a Communist!" ‘

This little book contains many_evidences of the work of the Civil Rights
Congress. ‘ '

Can you afford to hold back from this work? Can you afford to for your-
self? For your children? For their future? Can you afford to build your house,
as Apostle Luke wrote, "without a foundation?" G

_ OF COURSE NOT!
’ A country is its people. We areits people. Fifteen million Negroes areits
people. Fifty million workers are its people. a A

AND WE THE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR OUR RIGHTS——FOR
OUR COUNTRY-—FOR OUR LIYES! , .'

If I may paraphrase Gideon: Let he who is faint in heart take courage L
from the strength of many and of the life-giving nature of our appointed task. i

, Jerry Newson will be saved if we, the people, speak!

\Vith the hope that my signature may serve to discourage the idea that
the relation between the National Association for the Advancement ‘of
Colored People and the Civil Rights Congress should be antagonistic rather
than cooperative, ‘I am glad to sign the Postscript to this splendid little book
written by my friends, Buddy Green and Steve Murdock. Fascist influences
will supply social problems sufficiently strong and numerous to tax the

activities of both organizations indefinitely in their efforts to make democ-"

racy work.

As a member of both organizations, the NAACP, since 1912 and the
CRC, since its local beginning, I know loyalty to one does not necessarily
make for disloyalty to the other. Since they have a common goal, if we
cannot hold membership in both, we can be sympathetic enough to speak
kindly of what the other is doing and applaud its victories.

Yours for freedom and prosperity, democratically applied.

 ,upon picking up_a morning newspaper on Monday, October 24, 1948, “Look,

Just howi“intensive” were the activities of the Oakland policedepartment

although bothrwould havea ‘bearing on later developments in the case. ‘  I 
The Chronicle story, which quoted two Oakland police inspectors, ‘Joseph; 1‘,  A
Bertoglio and Merle Longnecker, did, however, provide ‘a motive for the ‘ 7 
slaying. - ‘ “ - I . ‘ I A .y - 1.
"A check of the register’s receipt tape and cash receipts in the safe indi-V 
cated at least $612 was stolen." , ’ S 
Furthermore, the Chronicle "reconstructed” thecrime through the eyesof 
the two police inspectors as follows: V “‘ »- ’ I 
“Savage had closed the drugstore at the usual hour of 9 p. m.»Then he"?,
was checking the receipts on the till’s roll tape (that compartrnent wasstill 
open) when there was a knockon the front door. ‘ S ' ° 
‘"EitheriSavage or his clerk, Mrs. pWilson,_ recognized the spurious cus-‘i 
tomers; otherwise, police theorized, they would not have been let in. Further-e

tell no tales. _ _ , — 
“The front door was relocked with the key left in the lock. Then the f
robbers herded Savage and the clerk into the prescription quartersin the rear.
“They forced Savage to open the safe there, then to-kneel before it, a hand V  .
shielding his eyes. Mrs. Wilson knelt beside him in this similar attitude of ad" 
Chinese execution. a I _ M v  _
"Their bodies were discovered. in front of the safe. Savage was lying fare  ’
down on the floor, Mrs. Wilson sprawled across him. , ' 
"Each one ha_d been killed instantly by a .45 caliber slug that entered the’ 
back of the head and came out on the forehead. One slug ‘tore into the floor, j
_the other ricocheted off the floor and shattered a bottle on the lower shelffr 

2

"That their eyes were covered at the moment of death was clearly shown jg ;
by telltake nicks on Savage’s right hand and Mrs. Wilson’s left hand. The‘; 
bullets, Crashing out oftheir foreheads, had grazed their fingers. 9     I

"Identical positions,of the bullet holes at the‘ back of each victim's head
offered evidence,” police said, "of more than one slayer. Either victim would,’ ..
have jumped or cringed had the other been shot first. Instead, the inspectoi.r.s"’
‘reasoned, two killers probably fired at both simultaneously." 4 f 

The theory of two killers, of which the police were so proud in the begin4'
