SOLVING CLUB PROBIEMS IN mes WORK

whatever the correct road to the united front in your neighborhood, it can

. be done now. But, there are some that say: "We should build our Party club

first. We have a problem of poor attendance, lagging dues payments, poor mobi-
lization for the sale of the Daily worker and Thg_worker; our educational work
needs to be strengthened. First we have to cut down on the membership fluctua-
tion in our club, improve the sale of literature, and then we'll be ready to
tackle the question of building the united front."

But what does low attendance, poor dues payments, and weak mobilization re-
flect? Exactly that we have not yet undertaken in life, in practice, to organize
the people for struggle. Lenin stated that a Party is invincible if it is able
"to link itself with, to keep in close touch with, and, to a certain extent if
you like, to merge with the broadest masses of toilers - primarily with the pro-
letariat, but also with the non-proletarian toiling masses." (Quoted in History

of CPSU, p. 362.)

We have tried to give some examples of the first steps which clubs can take

‘ in building the united front in their areas. But these are just limited examples.

The united front can be developed around a whole gamut of problems. Around a
single issue, or several. In some areas it will take the form of bringing or-
ganizations together. In others, bringing individuals together. But always its
aim is to unite people for actiont

TI-IE VANGUARD ROLE OF THE PARTY CLUB

.In approaching the building of the united front we must clearly understand
the "key question of defining exactly the role of the Party in relation to the
mass movement. This question is sometimes posed incorrectly as the ‘independent
role of the Party vs. coalition.‘ Unclarity on this problem creates debates and
confusion that make it impossible to move our comrades, as they should be moved,
to build the Party in this period. "

"In this connection, it seems to me that the basic question that should be
posed is: What kind of leadership are we giving to the mass movement? For, when
we talk about the independent role of the Party, we do not mean thereby a role
that isolates us from the masses, that causes us to move ahead of them too quick-
ly, or to lag behind them. By the independent role of the Party, we mean that
ours is a vanguard party, i.e., one that is integrally linked with the masses,
not separated from them,helping them to move forward, and leading them in their
forward movement. We have the task of ourselves understanding, and making clear
to the masses, the oneness of our Party with the masses, and of showing that
within this unity the Party is the most advanced sector. We must bring to the
people the increasing understanding that we are the advanced sector, not just by
saying so, but by helping to increase the fighting capacity of the people at all
levels of struggle. And this we can do precisely by increasing our own fighting
capacity, and by improving the quality of the leadership we give to the mass
movement on the basis of our scientific_understanding. That is what we must
grasp, and the sooner we end all talk about ‘independent role of the Party vs.
coalition,‘ the better it will be.

"The leadership of the Party is ofttimes blunted, and its work is developed
unevenly, because of the failure of many of our comrades to see clearly what is
meant by the independent role of the Party. Too often it is reduced merely to a
question of holding a mass meeting, of issuing a leaflet, of the sale of our
press, etc. The building of the mass movement, of the Party, becomes something
other than the expression of the vanguard role of our Party. But this is unnec-
essary, mechanical division; it is not an 'eithor-or‘ process. We must learn to
see the oneness in our Party work -- developing our line and activity among the
masses, and-in this way, and at the same time, building our Party.

"why is this question so important today? Because it is directly tied up
with how our Party can spur on the general anti-fascist struggle; work with or-
ganized masses; lead those masses, and at the sae time abide by democratic de-
cisions; and, at all stages, maintain and extend the mass influence of our Party,
and build it in that process. This, it seems to me is the way in which the ques-
tion of the independent role of our Party should be posed. It is this approach
that should be applied by our community clubs, the general approach to apply to
every phase of Party activity.“ (Henry Winston, Aug. 1947, p. 4, pp. 737-8)

A lot of thought must be given by the Party to the question of "helping to
increase the fighting capacity of the people at all levels of struggle." "What
does this mean in practice? How do we go about it?

I. .On many concrete issues the position of the Party is more advanced than
that which the united front movement is prepared to take at a given moment. For
example, within a united front for peace in your neighborhood there may be many
elements, including those that think the Soviet Union is equally responsible with
the United States for the fact that no stable peace develops. We should maintain
unity with such forces so long as they are ready and willing to fight on one or
another issue that will advance the struggle for peace. The Party as part of the
united front would continue to help build, broaden and strengthen it, and at the
same time work to convince those inside this movement that the real danger of war
stems from the fact that wall Street and not the Soviet Union or the Peoples‘
Democracies is striving to dominate the world.

2. However, the Party in its own name could issue leaflets pointing out
that the Soviet Union has repeatedly called for peace negotiations, what an
atomic war would mean, and demand that the Truman administration negotiate with
the Soviet Union for peace, disarmament and outlawing of the Hell Bomb. A clear
recognition of the fact that the war-mongers sit in wall Street, that Truman is
following their dictates and thereby endangering the lives of the American peo-
ple, will give the democratic, anti-war forces, far greater fighting capacity.

Bringing the position of the Party on many key questions and in varied form
to the people will win prestige for the Party and build its organization and mem-
bership. This can be accomplished as a result of the Party's work among the peo-
ple through the initiation of, and in the course of, the united front struggles.

The position of the Party can be brought both to members of the united front
movement and the neighborhood at large not only by means of leaflets, but also
with forums, sale of and canvassing with The_Worker. We should make known the
position of the Communist Party on such community issues as peace, relief, aid
to strikers and many others.

BUILDING THE PARTY

In building the united front we must not make the error of neglecting the
Party organization. For there are those who say: "We're all for it, it should
be done. The united front should be built. To do it, means we cannot pay too
much attention to the Party organization." But one cannot tackle the united
front and neglect the Communist Party. We would wind up with neither - the
united front nor a strong Party.

In the course of such struggles, many workers come to respect the work of
our Party, its sincerity, consistency and ability - through the individual Party
members they work with. Our Party members must work closely with the most mili-
tant workers in the united front. In discussions with such people we should give
them literature (like George Marion's book on the Communist trial) and copies of
the Daily worker and Thg_Worker. Also pamphlets on Socialism. Such people can
be brought into well-organized New Members Classes. Many can be recruited during
the course of such a class.

Steady attention to the most advanced and militant workers, drawing them in-
to discussions and classes, aids these workers in getting the most important les-
sons from their united front struggles. In the development of clearer fighters
who have a better understanding of the class forces involved, we help to strengﬂr-
en the united front. Attention therefore, to the consistent growth of some of

  

 

the best forces in the united front, to the building of the Party, aids in the
consolidation of the united front, its advance and further development.

Correct work by the club in building the united front can mean an opportu-
nity for a big advance in building leadership. In our initial approach to the
united front in each club, we must get to know our membership better, what or-
ganizations they belong to and what kind of assistance we can give them in im-
proving their leadership in united front work. In some cases we may be surprised
how rich are the mass connections of our club members.

. All the campaigns of our Party must be geared to strengthen our work in the
» united front. There will be instances when a section can make a leading contri-
bution in building the united front. For there are some issues that can best be
organized, and the broadest forces brought into motion, on a section level.

This does not mean that a club should hold back, or be held back, in build-
ing the united front because it is waiting for the section to tackle it. where
the section does not have something under way the initiative of the club should
be exercised and encouraged. "Then later, if it will strengthen the united front,
perhaps the club can help to influence the united front in its neighborhood into
a still broader stream developing on.a section-wide basis.

However, the basic fact remains -- and this is what determines our main ap-
proach. The ability to keep the U.S. out of world war III, and to stop the
growth of fascism in the United States will be decided in each neighporhood and
in each sho . And the way our Party clubs help to build the unity of their
NEIGHBOHHOODS will determine how widespread and successful will be the PEOPLE'S
RESISTANCE MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.

Set our stylzts on the November, I950 £/ectians /Vow!

Every club has a job to do. There is not a single club that cannot contrib-
ute to the united front in its particular way. "A Party perishes if it shuts it-
self up in its narrow shell, if it severs itself from the masses." (History of
CPSU, p. 562) The best form'and the best method - that is a problem your club,
-535? decide.

Through this type of united front activity your small club can help to guar-
antee the defeat of those Wall Street forces that want to drag the U.S. into
World War III.

Helping to stop the fascist forces in the U.S. means working now, to lay the
basis for a broad coalition that can elect progressive congressmen in the 1950
elections. Our Party can be a decisive force in breathing life into such a broad
coalition.

Each club of the Communist Party in the United States must give immediate
attention to building the united front in the form.must suited to it. Build the
united front now. Give this work consistent attention and leadership in April,
May, June, July, August, September and October, and your club will be making a
contribution in its own way toward the formation of a broad coalition for the
election of a progressive congress in November, 1950.

"... the American working class, and especially its Communist
vanguard, must show itself in action as the champion of the nation's
interests and of peace, as the best fighter for the social welfare
and progress of the immense majority of the American people. It
must unite its own ranks in militant struggle and gather around it-
self all patriotic and democratic elements. It must reinforce the
democratic anti-monopoly and anti-war coalition now emerging, and
give it fighting working-class leadership.

"This is the path of unity of action, of class struggle."

(Eugene Dennis, report to the l4th National Convention,

C.P.U.S.A., Political Affairs, September, l948, pp 791-792.)

INTRODUCTION
THIS IS A FACT, COMRADES:

THE GUARANTEE that the Big Money Boys will not be able to es-
tablish fascism --

THE GUARANTEE that they will not be able to carry our country
into World War III, an imperialist Hell4Bomb war, whose destruction
it is difficult to contemplate --

THAT GUARANTEE lies in the way your club of the Communist Party
brings to the workers in the neighborhood and in the shop a clearer
grasp of how to fight the war danger and how to stop fascism.

How will your small club, with all its weaknesses, be able to do
such a job? I

The key lies in a clear, down-to-earth understanding of what the
united front means to your club.

This is what the National Committee of our Party wants to dis-
cuss with you in this pamphlet: How the Party club can build the
united front in its area during this year, 1950.

This manual is for the community clubs. It does not deal with
the role and specific problems of the shop clubs. However, many
ideas contained herein can be of use to all clubs.

 

 

The forces of democracy and peace are the most powerful ones in the United States,
What is necessary is to or-a

-- more powerful than those that are for war and fascism. _
ganize the democratic forces. The cornerstone of the work of every Communist Party
club for 1950, shop or community, is helping to build the united front of the working

class and all democratic forces.

What do we mean by the united front? What does the united front mean to a Party
Club? How do we go about building it in our neighborhood? ‘

First questions first. What do we mean by the united front?

Gus Hall states it clearly in his article on the United Front, the Key to Victory:

"In the final analysis, the united front is the welding together of human
beings, of individuals from general political groupings, representinglmany trends
in American life. . . it takes people to agree to unite for action." -

(Political Affairs, December, 1949.)

Building the Unﬂzd Front in the Neigﬁborllood

Many of our Party clubs are not rooted in their neighborhoods, and face the ques-
tion of how and where to start in their work. The heart of the answer is: what are
the main problems facing the workers in your neighborhood.

The major question facing the people of the United States in the year l950 is:
WILL WE BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN PEACE, OR WILL THE BIG MONEY BOYS OF WALL STREET SUCCEED
IN STARTING WORLD WAR III, an imperialist war, which will bring devastation to the
United States and major areas of the rest of the world.

There are powerful currents for peace in the ranks of labor and the people of the
United States. Even some of the world's leading imperialists--who are trying to help
start World War III find themselves compelled to make big speeches for renewed US—USSR
negotiations on outlawing the H-bomb.

On Thursday, February l6, Millard E. Tydings (D., Md.) spoke from the floor of
the Senate and called on Secretary Acheson to "try another roadway" to agreement with
Russia. On.Friday, February l7, Tom Connally (D, Tex.) suggested a Big Three Confer-
ence of Foreign Ministers on atomic controls. In England, on Tuesday, February l4,
Winston Churchill, campaigning for election, called for a "top level" attempt to reach
agreement—with Soviet Russia on atomic control and an end to the cold war. Says the
New York Times (February 19), "In Britain, as elsewhere, the dread of the A and H bomb

underlies all other worries."

The mass desire for peace is clearly shown when even the New York Times is forced
to acknowledge in an editorial on February l6, "Mr. Churchill's talk of a truce in the
cold war will appeal to an electorate yearning, like people in this country, like peo-
ple all over the globe, for some assurance of peace."

Undoubtedly,_this is the problem facing the people in YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD around
which the greatest unity can be achieved.

I. HOW CAN YOUR CLUB HELP ESTABLISH UNITY OF THE PEOPLE FOR PEACE?

What kind of steps can be taken in your neighborhood to give expression to the
mass sentiment for peace? ‘

Can your club_help to get together a limited number of people or organizations
to sponsor a neighborhood

PEACE BALLOT

. Calling upon President Truman ‘ .
. . To outlaw the H-bomb. .
. . To negotiate NOW with the Soviet Union. _

. To outlaw atomic warfare-and halt the cold war. ~.

 

 

  

   

_ Or, would these sponsors be willing to call a neighborhood rally against the
‘H-bomb? Or, perhaps a mass Peace Ballot would help lay the base for, and popularize

a united Neighborhood geace Rally.

Would it be possible at such a Neighborhood Rally to launch a still bigger and
"broader petition to President.Truman calling_upon him to undertake negotiations be-
tween the United States and the Soviet Union for atomic disarmament and an end to
the cold war? ’ , ‘

In other words, what we wish to indicate here are:

FI§§T, the decisive place where the ability to hold the Wall Street war mongers
in check will be decided at the GRASS ROOTS, in your neighborhood. This is not Just
a question of national politics or state politics, but rather, and most important, it
is a question of local politics. ~ ,

PEACE IS A COMMUNITY PROBLEM. The fight for peace is neighborhood politics.

SECOND, your club should use its own initiative and go to work now on this ques-
tion. ctions should not be limited to ballots, petitions and rallies. We must re-
member that people express their determination for-peace in their own way: Church
groups conduct mass_prayers. Some organizations "send delegations to various polit-
ical representatives. Some organizations lay wreaths commemorating those who have
given their lives in war and pledge themselves to work for peace. These and other
forms of expression help swell the demand that we shall not face the holocaust of
atomic destruction.

THIRD; In building the united front, a Conference, a Peace Ballot, etc., should
not be an end in itself. One step should lead to a second. What we must develop is
a sustained fight for peace; develop joint or parallel actions of all kinds; establish
peace committees in every neighborhood. In the final analysis, our objective is to
ghite.the broadest sections of people, in the first place the workers and the Negro
.gg9p;e,_to make.impossible World war III and the rise of fascism in the United States.

we are just indicating here some limited forms that the united front for peace
may take. Our Party can play a vanguard role in welding together that mass sentiment
against the horror of the H-bomb in each community.

FOURTH: The very right to fight for peace is itself endangered at this moment.
The Mundt-Ferguson bill is designed precisely for the purpose of attempting to stop
such unity of the people as is spreading throughout the country in the growing peace
movement. The right of all people opposed to a war of atomic destruction to unite
their forces and voice their ideas, must be defended by fighting against the Mundt—
Ferguson bill.

In the Parent-Teachers Associations, in organizations of the Negro people, in
lodges, in churches, in youth groups, in women's organizations, in various neighbor-
hood groups, the overwhelming number of people, like the Communists, have a common de-
sire for peace. Communists who are members of such organizations, should give a lot
of thought to how they can make the best contribution in the struggle for peace.

The form of-united action for peace and the best road to it, will vary from com-
munity to community.

The problem that each club must tackle now and USE INITIATIVE ON, is how best to
help its community get on the road towards establishing such united action.

But peace is just one problem around which large masses of people in your neigh-
borhood can be united. ‘

Let us examine some others.

II. A VITAL UNITED FRONT-LESSON FROM THE MINERS' STRIKE

The miners have just won a great victory. They have dealt a real blow to the
strike-breaking Taft-Hartley Law. Their victory was won in the face of the combined
assault of the mine owners, the Truman administration, the courts, the press and
radio. Victory, in the face of such powerful forces, was due to the heroic solidarity
of the miners throughout their nine months of battle and the united front support that
was rallied behind this decisive strike. Trade unionists in Chicago, Cleveland, Los
Angeles and other cities, the farmers of New Jersey, the people from church groups and
fraternal lodges, the neighborhood folks in Brooklyn rallied by the A.L.P., the read-
ers of the Daily worker -- all united behind this key struggle. Tens of tons of food
were sent to the miners. And as the strike ended, this united movement was spreading
to union locals and to neighborhoods throughout the country. *

In this fight of the miners we have an outstanding example of how the united
front can be built. Our Party played an important role and made a major contribution
in helping to develop this united movement. The Party clubs made house-to-house and
store-to-store collections for food, explaining the issues and obtaining participation
of many new people in solidarity with the miners. Our Party members raised the issue
of the miners‘ strike in unions, shops and mass organizations.

People once reached -- responded. They gave food. They spoke out in support of
the strike. They demanded a stop to Taft-Hartley injunctions. A powerful united
movement of solidarity arose. Vast sections of the people were rallied in support of
this working class struggle. . .

The lesson that the miners‘ strike teaches us -- the lesson we must not forget is:

The most important form of the united front in the communities is building the unity
of all progressive forces behind the struggles of the workers in industry.

III. BUILDING THE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNEMPLOYED

 

"There is not a worker in America who.does not fear the economic crisis like
a plague. This fear hangs over the industrial valley and cities of Ohio like a
heavy fog." (Gus Hall, December, 1949 Political Affairs.)

The economic crisis is assuming increasingly grave proportions all over the coun-
try. In the ranks of the Negro people mass unemployment constitutes a burning problem.
Among the youth, the women, unemployment is mounting. There is not a single working
class community in the country where unemployment is not a key problem right now.

What can your section or club do to unite the unemployed, to organize the fight
for increased unemployment insurance, increased relief benefits, and to defeat any
proposed relief cuts?

Wherever there is mass unemployment, a most important form of the united front is
that of organizing the unemployed. One of the most devastating crises in our history
is shaping up. As it develops the bourgeoisie will try desperately, through dema-
gogues, to divert the discontent of the unemployed masses into reactionary channels.

Now is the time when the progressive forces should turn major attention to the
organization of the unemployed. Meetings of unemployed on a neighborhood level.

,Delegations to relief agencies. Stopping evictions of unemployed workers. Estab-

lishing block or area unemployed councils. Securing the support of the employed
workers, the whole community, for the needs of the unemployed. In the course of such
organization we must build the unity of Negro and white. It was through such powerful
unity along exactly such lines, that we were able to defeat cuts in relief, to win in-
creased relief and eventually unemployment insurance, in the last crisis.

  

     

This is how a successful community action was carried through in Chicago. (From
the Du Sable Edition of The Worker, March l9, 1950):

Win Relief Aid For Aged Diabetic

Here's the story of how one Chicago community dealt with the inhuman treat-
ment of a neighbor on relief, and Won for him the assurance of continued
aid.

The West Side Committee for Adequate Relief went into action in the case of
Ned King, 1957 W. Warren Ave., a 61-year-old Negro worker disabled by heart
disease and diabetes. He received $54.59 per month from the welfare depart-
ment for food, rent, etc. Nothing was allowed for personal needs, or car-
fare.

Suddenly the welfare department threatened to cut off $8.50, the,extra
amount allowed for his diabetic diet. They said that the doctor had not
sent in the "forms" to prove his need.

The committee's secretary, Ulene Southall, told how they first organized a
delegation to the relief office to see what could be done -- but they got
no satisfaction there.

A leaflet was addressed to Gov. Stevenson calling the case of Ned King to
his attention. They pointed out that this case was typical of the plight
of other relief clients and that immediate steps had to be taken.

The leaflet called for (l) a special session of the State Legislature to
consider additional appropriations for relief, (2) all state representauwes
and senators to speak out against this inhuman treatment-of clients, (5)
all civic—minded individuals and organizations to protest the relief cuts
which were being made.

The entire neighborhood was canvassed with leaflets. .Churches and other
groups were talked to about the case. An additional delegation went to
Alderman George D. Kells of the 28th ward, State Chairman of the Democratic
Party.

Returningpto the relief office, they now got a'different reception. Assur-
ances were given that Kingfs budget would not be cut. He was given carfare
topgo to the doctor when necessary. And every effort was promised to get
him placed in a convalescent home. ' '

The Administration that is spending 20 billions on war preparations, that is
sending additional billions abroad to prop up every reactionary administration in the
world, and now wants to ship billions to fascist Franco, cannot claim to have no money
available for its unemployed workers at home.

IV. THE UNITED FRONT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR NEGRO RIGHTS E

The Truman Administration has betrayed the EEPC fight, Lynchings and mob vio-
lence are increasing. In the face of increased attacks on the Negro people, the Ad-
ministration has not brought one single lyncher to justice. City, state and federal
agencies have failed to defend the right of the Negro people to live in non-ghettoed
areas. Police brutality is increasing throughout the country.

The growth of the Negro people's liberation movement since the end of world war
II underscores the power and.breadth of the unity that can be developed in fighting
against these vicious attacks on the Negro people.- A good example is the more than
5,000 Negro and white delegates who gathered in the civil rights mobilization in Wash-
ington, January l950. This demonstration showed that the Administration's broken
promises in relation to civil rights for the Negro people is meeting resistance not
only in the ranks of the Negro masses but also among increasing sections_of the —_-
labor-progressive forces. -

 

 

   

There is growing_recognition in the ranks of the progressive white workers that
these attacks on'the Negro people are part of the growth of the fascist danger in the
United States and that attacks on the civil liberties of the Negro people threaten the
civil rights of the working class as a.whole.

While the Comunist Party has made important contributions in developing the
united front struggle for Negro rights, they are only beginnings. Clubs must take the
initiative in every community in the fight against anti-Negro violence, discrimination
and segregation. We have excellent examples of significant victories in areas where
this fight has been seriously undertaken.

On New York's lower East Side the Party and a number of other progressive organ-
izations were instrumental in initiating a capaign for jobs in woolworth's for Negro
workers. Mass picket lines were maintained in front of Woolworth's every Saturday for
months. The importance of Negro-Jewish unity was explained to the Jewish people who
constitute the majority of the community. At the same time a united front was built
with a large number of neighborhood organizations and leading individuals. After nine
months, Woolworth's was forced to capitulate and jobs were won for Negro salesclerks.

‘Such struggles have been developed in hundreds of communities throughout the country.

* * * * * *

The struggle for Negro rights must be organized in each comunity. In one area
the fight may be for a local or federal EEPC with teeth in it. In other areas it may
be to eliminate restrictive covenants and for non-segregated housing projects. It may
be to force the punishment of lynchers and "legal" murderers of Negroes. It may be to
stop increased police vtolence. It may be to free Mrs. Ingram, the Trenton Six, or
other victims of Jim Crow justice.

The united front for the election of Negro candidates in 1950 is already begin-
ning to shape up in many places. By linking the struggles that are developed around ‘
issues with the right of the Negro people to represent themselves in government our
Party clubs can make an.important contribution to the Negro people's liberation move-
ment.

Often, powerful movements can be built around local issues.

The callous discrimination against the Negro people in various city and county
governments expresses itself in the scandalous conditions prevailing in the Public
Schools and the hospitals (or lack of them) in ghetto areas. Classrooms, originally
built for 25-50 children, crowd in 50 or more. Buildings are often fire hazards.
Some of them more than 50 years old. What mother will not join her neighbors to help
eliminate such conditions? Many teachers, as well as the Teachers Unions, will want
to be part of a campaign to improve conditions prevailing in these schools. '

Here is a problem around which the broadest unity of the neighborhood, and of
Negro and white, can be built.

-How do we go about helping to build the united front for improved school condi-
tions? Let's start with the club itself. How many conrades have children of their
own attending the school? Secondly, how many of the comrades know parents of children
going to this school -- a neighbor in the house, etc. ,Third, how can we best go to
the neighborhood on the question of improved school conditions. Can we help to get a
small group of parents to issue a petition to the neighborhood? Or a leaflet? Is it
possible to call a conference of parents, teachers, representatives frcm.the teachers
union, and neighbors who would help get improved school conditions for the children.
And we must not let our work lapse after such a conference. Such a conference is not
the end of the united front. It's just the beginning.

, Or take another problem, which is pressing in many communities, especially in
Negro communities -— that of the inadequate, poorly equipped hospitals. A united
struggle on the broadest basis can succeed in winning improved conditions and appro-
priations. In many cases there are already organizations and individuals deeply con-
cerned over the government's callous disregard for-the health of the Negro people.
Doctors and nurses organizations. People who as patients have faced intolerable over-
crowding. To bring these forces together; to introduce new organizations and individ-
uals in the fight for decent hospital conditions, can be a major contribution of a
Party club. '

  

   
 

Imagine what twenty billion dollars can do in terms of saving life, building
schools, better health for the people -- especially the most oppressed sections of
our population.

But when twenty billion dollars is being spent to fashion death -- there is
nothing left with which to build life.

Today, when more than 20 billions are being spent on war preparations, the con-
ditions of the hospitals and schools in many communities in the United States are
disgraceful. Look around. what is the situation in your community?

V. UNITING THE NEIGHBORHOOD AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM

The drive towards fascism whips up increased anti-Semitism. How can a small
Party club, that does not have too many connections with the neighborhood, help to
unite the people in their neighborhood against the growth of anti-Semitism?

On January 29th, at the Hotel Astor in New York, a Hearst—inspired conference
initiated by the leadership of the American Legion was attended by most fascist groups
in the United States. (See Daily Worker, January 31, l950.) Present were brazen antr
Semites, open fascists of the Merwin K. Hart variety, who use the claim of fighting
Communism as the smokescreen behind which to spread anti-Semitism, anti-Negro and
union-busting ideas. To their shame, some leaders,of the B'nai B'rith, the American
Jewish Committee and the Jewish War Veterans shared the platform with these open anti-
Semites.

Is your club in a position to do either or both of the following? 1) Help to
rally the people against this would-be fascist center, before it can really get under
way; 2) Get members of B'nai B'rith, the American Jewish Committee and the Jewish War
Veterans, or leading members of Jewish organizations to urge strongly that no Jewish
leader should associate with such fascist cabal. Already many such letters are pour-
ing into the national headquarters of these organizations and are having an effect.
Let's discuss the first question in greater detail. How can a club help to rally
and unite people against this fascist center?

1. In what organizations are your club members? Can they, or some invited
speaker, discuss what the formation of such a center will mean to America, at one of
the organization's meetings?

2. How can you reach the Jewish organizations in your community, the Progressive
Party clubs, organizations of the Negro people, unions, lodges, churches, civic groups,
etc. Is there a Community youth center? Can the formation of this fascist outfit be
raised at the local Demcratic club meeting, at the fraternal organization in your
neighborhood?

3. Is it possible to set up a provisional committee sponsored by some community
organizations to call a conference of neighborhood organizations? This conference
could discuss what steps can be taken in the face of such an attempt by anti-Semitic,
anti-Negro, anti-labor forces to set up a fascist center in the United States.

Or let us take the question of such anti-Semitic acts as the smashing of windows
in stores owned by Jewish shopkeepers, the painting of swastikas on synagogues, etc.
Is it not possible for our Party to go to work and help unite the neighborhood store
owners, various neighborhood clubs and prominent individuals to speak out against, and
demand adequate protection of local, state and federal agencies against such outrages?

VI. BUILDING THE UNITED FRONT OF INDIVIDUALS

In building the united front in the community, there should not be any mechanical
approaches. Sometimes the united front takes the form of bringing together the organ-
izations in the community. But, the united front can be organized also thru bringing

"together individuals of varying views.

Some clubs say there are no organizations or clubs in their territory, therefore
they cannot contribute towards'building the united front. But "the welding together
of human beings, of individuals from general political groupings" also constitutes the
building of the united front. Peace Committees of individuals; Unemployed Councils
uniting individual.unemployed workers; Tenants organizations; all are forms of the

united front.
 Points to keep in mind

E Some of the points to keep in mind, which will help to guide our clubs in build-
ing the united front are:

"we must be ready to join movements and actions initiated by others. One of
the most successful coalitions, the American Youth Congress, was not initiated by
the Communists.

v "we must not attempt to include our full program on every issue in every
I united movement. Movements are built around a minimum number of specific issues.

‘ "we must not try to hand over to a united coalition a tailor-made program or
5 organization. All these detailed questions must be worked out together with
i other forces in the coalition.

"We must not hog the leadership. A united coalition needs a coalition also
in leadership.

"We must not join united movements with preconceived ideas of complete unity
A coalition, a united front, presupposes differences - differences on program, on
form and methods.

"We must be ready at all times to be flexible on these details. We must be
ready at all times to learn from the other forces in the united front. There is
much we can learn and profit from the experiences of others.

"We must never be the 'We told you so‘ wiseacres. we must never give the
wrong impression of gloating over setbacks and difficulties in our efforts to
expose the misleaders who are responsible for these setbacks.

"The essence of our leadership in a united front must be mass political edu-
_cation in the process of the struggle itself."

(Gus Hall, Dec. l949 PA, p. 31)
SOME DANGERS TO.THE UNITED FRONT

The worst enemies of the united front are the Social Democratic and labor
misleaders. They will often oppose the united front or, if they enter it, they
will try to sabotage it, or try to turn it away from its purpose and destroy it.

1 Communists must therefore work to build the united front from below. That means
to establish close contacts with the members of fraternal, social or political
organizations including those headed by labor misleaders. It means also to ap-

. preach the local bodies of these organizations.

Where labor misleaders enter united fronts, Comunists must_work in such a
way as to prevent them from harming the struggle. This can be done by exposing
them effectively, skilfully, so as to isolate them. This can be done not by
name—calling, but by showing up their actions in relation to the issues and the
concrete struggles organized to win the workers‘ demands.

We must always bear in mind that what the Communists see or understand in
the conduct of the misleaders, is not at once clear to others. Therefore, Com-
munists must work in such a way that the rank and file people will support their
proposals and accept criticism of the Social Democratic misleaders, if such crit-
icism is necessary, as correct and just and in the interests of the united strug-
