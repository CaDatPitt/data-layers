THE HISTORIC FIGHT T0 ABOLISH SCHOOL
SEGREGATION IN THE U.S.

By Doxey A. Wilkerson

The school segregation cases re-argued before the United States

Supreme Court during the week of December 7th, l953, pose a direct challenge
to the Jim Crow system as a whole, and open up the possibility of a major
break-through on this front. The broad campaign being waged around these
cases, led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
reflects the advanced stage and power of the Negro peopleis liberation move-
ment; and, at the same time, it exposes the self-defeating contradictions
which inhere in U. S. imperialism. The failure of the labor-progressive
movement thus far to play any substantial role in this struggle is a political
scandal which should be corrected at once.

Negro School Struggles of the Past

Faith in the liberating powers of education has always run deep
and the fight for educational opportunities has been
the prime issue - more consistently even than suffrage or lynching or Jobs -
which has moved the Negro masses into direct struggle against their oppressors,
especially in the urban and rural South.

It was the Negro freedmen, fresh from slave-era prohibitions
against teaching any Negro to read and write, who sparked the post-Civil war
fight to have the”E3alition Reconstruction governments establish the first
state systems of free public schools the South had ever known - an historic
achievement which Byrnes and Talmadge and their ilk now threaten to destroy.

Ever since the defeat of Reconstruction, and especially since

World war I, Negroes throughout the South - and in many northern states too -
have fought in various ways to overcome the handicap of educational inequali-
ties stemming from segregated schools. They have presented countless petitions
to white school authorities, carried on widespread campaigns of protest and
publicity, contributed many millions of dollars to supplement meager public
funds allocated to Negro schools, exerted political pressure where they were
able to vote, lobbied in Congress for federal equalization legislation. and
appealed to the courts for enforcement of their democratic right to equality

of educational opportunity.

In this latter connection, during the 70 years immediately f011°W'
ing the Civil war, at least 113 cases challenging educational d1scr1m1nat10nS
in the Negro separate schools of 29 states were tried in courts of last re-
sort. Favorable decisions were won in all 24 suits to ban segregation in
northern states where it was not required by law, in 15 out of 16 cases to
outlaw the former practice of certain southern states to tax Negroes and whites
separately for their respective systems of schools, and in one case involving
the exercise of arbitrary power by school officials. But Negro petitioners won
only 9 out of 28 suits which sought to compel equal facilities in segregated
schools; and they were defeated in all 44 cases challenging the constitution-
ality of segregated schools. (The Jburnal Of Negro EdU3&t10n. July. 1935-)

During the past two decades, the fight for equal educational op-
portunity has been stepped-up on all fronts; and Negro petitioners have won

-1-

some notable victories in the courts. one important group of cases, involving
several county and city systems in Maryland and Virginia in the late thirties,
resulted in U.S. Supreme Court decisions requiring equal salary scales for
white and Negro teachers. These decisions have exerted substantial influence
in improving Negro teachers! salaries in all of the southern states.

Another important group of cases centered around applications of
Negro students for admission to the lily-white graduate and professional
schools of state-supported southern universities - the most notable being that
of Lloyd Gaines against the University of Missouri, which the U.S. Supreme
Court decided in favor of the petitioner in 1938. As a result of this and
related decisions, well over a thousand Negro students are now attending south-
ern graduate and professional schools from which all Negroes were barred less
than twenty years ago.

All of these cases were intiated and financed by organized mass
movements of the Negro people; and in recent decades the N.A.A.C.P. has served
as the chief legal spearhead of these mass movements. Thus, the five cases
now before the U.S. Supreme Court- challenging school segregation, as such,
in South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, Kansas and District of Columbia - re-
flect a new high level in the long and continuing struggle of the Negro people
for equality of educational opportunity.

THE CONSTITUTION SAYS:

"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of
the United States."

From the 14th Amendment, the basis of
School Segregation cases in Virginia,
South Carolina, Delaware and Kansas.
(The District of Columbia case is
based on the 5th Amendment.)

New Challenge from the Black Belt

The concerted drive to abolish the system of segregation in public
elementary and secondary schools of the South is largely a development of the
period since world war II. It poses a much more fundamental threat to the
entire Jim Crow system than most previous struggles, which centered chiefly
around the goal of "separate but equal" schools for Negro children. And it is
highly significant that this new and radical demand to abolish school segre-
gation first arose among the Negro masses in Black Belt counties of the South.

It has not been long since any proposal to abolish public school
segregation through court action would have been considered utopian. Illus-
trative is the previously cited 1935 survey of the legal status of the Negro
separate school, which concluded that Negroes are "doomed to obtain unfavor-
able decisions from the courts if they contest" the principle that "the separ-
ate school which provides equal educational opportunity is constituional."
Yet, this is precisely the principle that has a good chance of being repudiat-
ed in the cases now before the Supreme Court. Indeed, stipulations were en-
tered by opposing counsel "admitting" for purposes of these proceedings, that
school facilities for white and Negro children are "equal," thus clearing the

-2-

way for a direct challenge to the famous "Separate but Equal" principle estab-
lished in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896.

The initiative for this basic challenge to the system of school
segregation did not arise from the nationally recognized leaders of the Negro
people; it came from below —- among the masses of Negro working people and
their children in predominantly Negro counties of the Old South.

It is no accident that this new challenge to public school segrega-
tion grew out of local struggles for "equality" in separate Negro schools in
Black Belt communities -- Clarendon County, S.C., where Negroes constitute

' nearly four-fifths of the population, and Prince Edward County, va., where

Negroes are more than half the total. It is precisely in such predominantly
Negro areas of the agrarian south that Negro-white inequalities in education
are most glaring, and give rise to the deepest resentment among the Negro

masses.

Incidentally, this development illustrates a process which future
struggles for Negro freedom will repeat over and over again. Fights for limit-
ed reforms, initiated from below -- among working people in local communities
-- will develop into widespread struggles for much mere radical demands, and
will win the active support of the entire Negro people. In time, the Negro
movement as a whole, its reformist demands thwarted by the outright opposition
or the demagogic maneuvers of U.S. imperialism, will take on the revolutionary
character which inheres in the nature of its national liberation goals.

Politics and the Court - 1896 and 1951+

If the Negro people stand a good chance of winning an anti-segrega-
tion decision from the Supreme Court in the school cases now pending - and they
do -- it is because of the new political realities which have arisen to con-
found American imperialism since the Plessy v. Ferguson decision nearly 60 years

880-

By the mid-l890|s, Reconstruction Democracy had been pretty thor-
oughly defeated; and Bourbon reaction -- now wedded to rising U.S. imperialism
centered in the north -- was triumphant all over the South. There was still
some “mopping-up" to do; but by and large the democratic coalition of poor
white and Negro people had been effectively routed, and the promise of politi-
cal democracy submerged for a long period ahead.

It was in this setting that the New Orleans Citizens Comittee for
Annulment of Act III of the Louisiana egislature of 1890 backed Homer Adolphe
»Plessy in his deliberate violation of "The Separate Car Laws". Following
arrest and conviction in the state courts, Plessy appealed to the Supreme
Court of the United States. The case was argued on April 13, 1896; and on the
following May 18, the Court affirmed Plessyls conviction by a 7 to 1 vote -
the only dissent coming from the southern-born Justice John Marshall Harlan.

The white chauvinist arrogance of the then ascendant U.S. imperial-
ism -- Just two years before its colonizing ventures in the Caribbean and the
Pacific -— is reflected in the Supreme Courtfs pronouncement that:

"Legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts

or to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences,
and the attempt to do so can only result in accentuating the
difficulties of the present situation. If the civil and

political rights of both races be equal, one cannot be
inferior to the other civilly or politically. If one

race be inferior to the other socially, the Constitution

of the United States cannot put them upon the same plane..."

This reactionary decision, clearly reflecting the political
climate of the 1890's, has remained to thwart all legal assaults against any
form of intra-state segregation for two generations. In 1927, when the
validity of statutes making segregated schools compulsory was brought before
the Supreme Court for the first time, Chief Justice Taft, speaking for the
Court, refused even to consider the matter an open question. Plessy v.
Ferguson still defines what the Supreme Court says the Constitution says
about state laws requiring the segregation of Negroes in schools and else-
where.

THE COURT AND CIVIL RIGHTS

"The Supreme Court of the United States, in the
exercise of its high and vast power, has suddenly and
unexpectedly decided that the law intended to secure
to colored people the civil rights guaranteed to them
by the ..... Constitution of the United States is un-
constitutional and void....."

"This decision of the Supreme Court admits that
the Fourteenth Amendment is a prohibition on the
states. It admits that a State shall not abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States, but commits the seeming absurdity of allowing
the people of a State to do what it prohibits the State
itself from doing."

Frederick Douglass, on the
Courtis decision invalidating
the Civil Rights Law of 1875.

But the situation and outlook today are quite different from that
of 1896, when a confident Supreme Court required only about one month to hear
arguments and hand down its decision. The school cases now before the Supreme
Court were first argued on December 9, 1952. Six months later, on June 8,
they were restored to the dockets for legal briefs and re-argument on four
special questions posed by the Court. This re-argument was heard by the Court
in early December, 1953; and none can predict when a decision will be reached.

It is obvious that a real struggle on this issue is going on with-

in the Supreme Court, and that the democratic forces of our country have a
very good opportunity to win reversal of Plessy v. Ferguson. The decision of
the Court in these cases -- Just as in all such cases -- will be dictated

by political considerations; and it is the much changed political situation
that now opens up this possibility of a major breach in the entire system of
segregation in the United States.

The most fundamental change in the political situation is the fact
that U.S. imperialism today -- despite its bellicose posture -- is no longer
on the way up, as it was 60 years ago, but is desperately trying to hold on
in the face of a formidable and growing challenge from the forces of peace and

-4-

democracy throughout the world. Its weakening international political position
is further undermined by a number of developments on the domestic scene -- the g
instability of our countryis militarized economy, the spread of Mccarthyite Q
aggression against the democratic liberties of the whole American people, Q
growing unrest and struggle on the part of the U.S. labor movement, and espec- ﬂ
ially the continuing disgraceful oppression of the Negro people in all areas E
of American life. In this latter connection, as even the notoriously anti-

Negro Vice President Nixon was forced to admit at the conclusion of his recent
world tour, the Negro question constitutes one of the most vulnerable flaws W
in the international armor of U.S. imperialism. ﬁg

 

Flowing largely from these international and domestic developments, by
- and contributing substantially to their further maturation, is the marked up- .§
surge of Negro liberation struggles during and after world war II. Stimulated fﬁ
, by the progressive currents unleashed during the anti-fascist war, encouraged §
‘ by the powerful peoplels liberation struggles under way in Asia and Africa, ”
and revolted by the cynicism of a Government that preaches “human rights" and
"democratic freedom" all over the world while callously practicing virulent
white chauvinist oppression here at home, the Negro people are challenging Jim
Crow barriers all along the line. Moreover, they are making limited but
important advances -- in breaking down segregation in travel and other public
accommodations, in pushing outward from the housing ghetto, in voting and win-
ning election to public office, in cracking some bars to employment, and in
bettering educational opportunities on all levels.

In now challenging the basic structure of segregation in public
elementary and secondary schools, the Negro people are consciously seeking to
destroy a major prop of all other forms of anti-Negro segregation. As express-
ed in a special article by editors of the Pittsburgh Courier (Dec. 19, 1953):
"Segregation in our schools is the most vicious and harmful form of segrega-
tion....If the decision of the Supreme Court abolishes racial segregation in
the public schools, it will be but a short time before all forms of segrega-

tion will disappear."

Herein lies the motive power of the united drive of the Negro
people behind N.A.A.C.P.'s legal assault on school segregation -- a unity re-
flected in organized support by business and professional associations, frater-
nal societies, church groups and the whole Negro press -- and by tens of

° thousands of small contributions to fulfill the emergency fund drive of $#0,000.
Negroes sense that the underlying issue here debated is the total abolition of _h
legal segregation in the United States; and they are pressing this fight to the :3
' hilt . 
of

Monopoly capital -- which profits enormously from the Jim Crow .3
system -- also understands the far—reaching implications of these school seg- *
regation cases; but it is forced by political necessities to have the Attor-
ney Generals of two administrations file amicus curae briefs squarely challen-
ging the constitutionality of state segregated school laws. The Dixiecrat
allies of wall Street are crying out in alarm -- even threatening to abolish
all public schools if the Supreme Court outlaws segregation; but they know
it will not be easy to carry out that threat. As is reflected in the defeat
of proposed enabling legislation in Mississippi, the white as well as the
Negro masses of the South may be counted on to wage -- indeed, are now waging--
a big political struggle against abolition of all free public schools.

Thus it is that the Supreme Court of today moves more cautiously §
than that of 1896. It hesitates, stalls for time. The Court has an important §
political decision to render; but the political foundations of U.S. imperia1— g

lib} .


ism, at this advanced stage of the general crisis of capitalism, are much less
secure than at the time of Plessy v. Ferguson.

Victory By No Means Certain

Although the cases now pending offer a very real possibility of
winning a Supreme Court opinion invalidating school segregation, such a deci-
sion is by no means assured. Moreover, a favorable decision might well be
saddled with seriously.compromising conditions; and even a clear-cut court
order to abolish segregated schools would encounter very serious obstacles to
implementation.

In the first place, it would be dangerous to rule out the possibi-
lity that the Supreme Court will decide against petitioners. Such a decision
would outrage world opinion and go a long way toward destroying the Negro
peopleis illusions in "the democratic.processes of-our government." It would
be a stupid political blunder for the high court of U.S. imperialism; but so
were the legal lynchings of willie McGee and the "Martinsville Seven," and
the foul murders of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. A fully negative decision
must be reckoned as a distinct possibility.

Second, the Court might render clear-cut decisions against school
segregation in Kansas and District of Columbia, and possibly Delaware - where
local public opinion and school authorities are already largely favorable to
the abolition of Jim Crow schools, while temporizing with school segregation
in South Carolina and Virginia. This would leave intact the basic pattern
of segregation where it matters most to the ruling class, and at the same time
make a gesture which the Big Business press and radio would try to interpret
as “a progressive step in the right direction." No such decision could satis-
fy the Negro people or world opinion; but it might possibly be resorted to as
imperialismis "best way out" of an uncomfortable dilemma.

Third, the Court might seek to find some compromise formula which
would outlaw school segregation "in principle," but provide for its "gradual"
implementation over a long period of time, especially in the states of the
Deep South. Some of the questions posed by the Court for re-argument last
December, together with several quarries in the course of the argument, point
in this direction.

OMINOUS QUERY

"If it is decided that public school segregation
violates the lﬂth Amendment, (a) would a decree neces-
sarily follow that colored children must be admitted
immediately to whatever public school they choose with-
in their own districts, or (b) could the court exercise
its equity powers to effect the change gradually?"

One of four questions on which the
Supreme Court requested briefs and
reargument.

PROPER RETORT

"The 14th Amendment requires that a decree be
entered directing that the children involved in these
cases be admitted lforthwith! to public schools without
racial distinction. There is no equitable Justification
for delaying their enjoyment of their rights."

From the brief of the N.A.A.C.P.

-6-

Herein lies the main danger. A weasel-worded, compromising opinion
by the Supreme Court would be fully in accord with the traditional practice of
bourgeois democracy -- to affirm liberty in words while negating it in deeds. g
The net effect of such a decision would be to extend the fight against Jim Crow %
schools over many more years, if not decades. g

Finally, even an unequivocal court directive to integrate white and
Negro schools "forthwith" would by no means settle the question: because it
would not create the material base necessary to achieve real integration. Negro
citizens would still be segregated in ghetto neighborhoods, which the Dixiecrats
would surely try to use as a basis_for maintaining school segregation "in fact." up
such a court order would not touch lily-white composition of public school 3
boards and top administrative staffs throughout the South; nor would it give “
any assurance of equal employment opportunities for Negro teachers.

Highly relevant in this connection are the experiences of Negroes
in large urban communities of northern states which prohibit school segregation
by law. Jim Crow practices of various kinds still abound in the school systems
of Chicago,New York, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Los
Angeles and many other such communities with large Negro populations —- despite
favorable laws and years of continual struggle by the Negro people.

There is also the area of education in segregated private schools,
which are now quite extensive in some southern states -— notably South Carolina,
Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana. This would be ignored by a
completely favorable decision in the cases now pending before the Court.

Further, it is generally recognized that public education during f
th1S PeP10d 18 3eP1°uS1V deteriorating for all children throughout the country_ -
-- as regards physical plant and equipment and personnel. This is especially
true in working class and Negro neighborhoods, reflecting the class bias which
controls the administration of public schools. This general class problem,
which a favorable Court decision would leave untouched, represents a further
obstacle to the achievement of real equality of education for Negroes.

In short, despite the very good likelihood of some kind of favor-
able decision on the school segregation cases now before the Supreme Court,
nothing can be taken for granted at this point. Regardless of the outcome in
the Court, much struggle still lies ahead before equality of educational

.Left-progressives can share fully the enthusiasm and hopes of the
whole Negro people over prospects that the Court may be impelled now to deliver
a major blow at the whole Jim Crow system of segregation in the United States.
we also have the responsibility to warn against the highly dangerous assumption
that “all is over but the shouting."

Role of Labor and the Left

whatever opinion the Supreme Court hands down in the school segre-
gation cases now pending will be determined, in the last analysis, by U.S.
imperialismls appraisal of its impact on the political situation here and
abroad -~ with full weight being given to the relation of forces within the
United States. It is the urgent responsibility of the whole labor-progressive
movement now to raise so powerful a demand for outlawing public school segre-
gation "forthwith" that the Court will not dare to come forward with a negative

or indecisive opinion.

This is no time for such dangerous passivity as the Pittsburgh
Courier (Dec. 19) advised editorially for the Negro people:

"Now there is nothing to do but wait and hope and
pray that the deliberations of the learned Judges will
result to our advantage, with a willingness to abide
by whatever decision is handed down."

He who does nothing but "wait and hope and pray" for blessings from the state
machinery of U.S. imperialism is doomed to perpetual oppression.

This is the time for every democratic peopleis organization in the
country to speak out in support of the historic struggle being led by the
N.A.A.C.P. This is the time for mass financial contributions to the Associa-
tionis legal defense fund, and for resolutions and letters and public pro-
nouncements from progressive organizations and individuals the nation over.

It is especially important for the labor movement and the progress-
ive white masses of our country now to come forward in demanding the abolition
of Jim Crow education. Trade union and other peopleis forces in the South
should challenge the Dixiecrat threat to abolish all public education if the
Supreme Court outlaws segregated schools. Candidates for public office in
the 1954 elections, in both the North and South, should be asked for state-
ments in support of the Negro peoplels fight against Jim Crow schools. The
National Committee of the Democratic and Republican Parties should be pressur-
ed for pronouncements on this issue.

By far the most serious weakness of the mass campaign around this
segregated schools question has been the failure of the labor and Left-pro-
gressive forces to rally white working class support. It is a weakness which
reflects serious underestimation of the importance of this fight for the work-
ing class as a whole. And the problem is greatly aggravated by the persistent
sectarian isolation of the Left from the mainstream of Negro life.

Let us be clear that the current struggle to abolish segregation

. in public schools is a political struggle of prime importance for our whole

country, and especially for the working class. It opens up as an attainable
objective the making of a major break-through in the entire structure of anti-
Negro segregation. It represents a vital threat to the Jim Crow mainstay of
that all-pervading white chauvinism that operates to divide and weaken the
ranks of the working class. It is a crucial struggle in the fight for demo-
cracy and peace.

The labor—progressive forces of our country, and especially the
Left, should intervene in this historic struggle with all the power they
command.
