l\lGELA DAVIS

Some of us, white and black, know how great a price has already been paid to bring into
existence a new consciousness, a new people, an unprecedented nation. If we know, and do
nothing, we are worse than the murderers hired in our name.

If we know, then we must fight for your life as though it were our own — which it is —— and
render impassable with our bodies the corridor to the gas chamber. For, if they take you
in the morning, they will be coming for us that night. ‘ JAMES BALDWIN

A Powerful and Definitive book on Political Prisoners,
Prisons and Black Liberation

Edited and prepared for publication by Angela Y. Davis, Bettina Aptheker and
other members of the National United Committee to Free Angela Davis and
All Political Prisoners.

“The writings which appear in this book were prepared under the auspices of
the Committee in direct response to a life and death struggle — for the life and
freedom of Angela Davis and all other political prisoners. This, however, repre-
sents a struggle of such magnitude and consequence that it goes beyond the
limited perspective to free a single individual or even to free several central
personages. When an answer is sought to the question as to what ‘terrible
forces’ drove a seventeen-year-old to take over a courtroom from armed deputy
sheriffs and for three prisoners to join him, the broad social forces at play in
the fight for the freedom of all political prisoners come immediately into focus.
These writings are statements about those forces, their causes, their import
upon individuals and upon society. This is part of the history of the power of a
people who have resisted so longthat resistance is a way of life . .
