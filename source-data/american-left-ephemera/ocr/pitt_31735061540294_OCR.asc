(h) Military bases sometimes introduced as scientific research stations or training schools, introduced
either before independence oras a condition for independence.

This description supports two broad generalizations. First, modern imperialism requires the active participation of the _
state in international economic relationships; imperialist nations can not singly or collectively implement a neo-coloni-
alist policy - via agencies such as the European Common Market, for example - without state capitalism. Secondly,
neo-colonialist policy is first and foremost designed to prevent the newly independent countries from consolidating their
political independence and thus to keep them economically dependent and securely in the world capitalist system. In
the pure case of neo-colonialism, the allocation of economic resources, investment effort, legal and ideological struc-
tures, and other features of the old society remain unchanged -- with the single exception of the substitution of 'internal
co.lonialism' for formal colonialism, that is, the transfer of power to the domestic ruling classes by their former colonial
masters.32 Independence has thus been achieved on conditions which are irrelevant to the basic needs of the society,
and represents a part—denial of real sovereignty, and a part-continuation of disunity within the society. The most im-
portant branch of the theory of neo-colonialism is therefore the theory of economic imperialism.

The definition of economic imperialism which we employ is the economic domination of one region or country over an-
other -- specifically, the formal or informal control over local economic resources in a manner advantageous to the
metropolitan power, and at the expense of the local economy. Economic control assumes different forms and is exer-
cised in a number of ways. The main form of economic domination has always been control by the advanced capitalist
countries over the liquid and real economic resources of economically backward areas. The main liquid resources are
foreign exchange and public and private savings, and real resources consist of agricultural, mineral, transportation,
communication, manufacturing, and commercial facilities and other assets. The most characteristic modes of domina-
tion today can be illuminated by way of contrast with examples drawn from the colonial period.

Control over Money

Examples of control over foreign exchange assets are numerous. In the colonial era the metropolitan powers established
currency boards to issue and redeem local circulating medium against sterling and other metropolitan currencies. In its
purest form, the currency board system required I00 per cent backing of sterling for local currency. The East African
Currency Board, for example, was established in I919, staffed by British civil servants appointed by the Colonial Of-
fice, and at one time exercised financial domination over Ethiopia, British and Italian Somaliland, and Aden, as well
as the East African countries.33 The Board did not have the authority to expand or contract local credit, and therefore
expenditures on local projects which required imported materials or machinery were limited to current export earnings,
less outlays for essential consumer goods, debt service and other fixed expenses. Measures to expand exports were thus
necessary pre-conditions of local initiatives toward economic progress. In this way, ‘British imperialism indirectly con-
trolled the allocation of real resources.

This mode of control still survives in modified form in the Commonwealth Caribbean economies and elsewhere.34 The
Jamaican central bank, for example, has limited power to influence the domestic money supply, but sterling and local
currency are automatically convertible in unlimited amounts at fixed rates of exchange. The local government is thus
prohibited from financing investment projects by inflation, or forced savings, nor are exchange controls and related fi-
nancial instruments of national economic policy permitted. The structure and organization of the commercial banking
system aggravates the situation. Local banks are branches of foreign-owned banks whose headquarters are located in
the overseas financial centers and are more responsive to economic and monetary changes abroad than in the local
economy; specifically, local banks have contracted credit at times when foreign exchange assets have been accumulat-
ing. This combination of monetary and financial dependence has caused artificial shortages of funds and prevented the
Jamaican government from allocating local financial resources in a rational manner.

A more characteristic form of control over foreign exchange today is private direct investment. In the I9th and early_
20th centuries, backward countries were often able to attract portfolio investments and local governments and capital-
ists were thus able to exercise some control over the use of foreign exchange made available by long-term foreign in-
vestment. Today direct investment constitutes the great mass of long-term capital exported on private account by the
metropolitan countries. Foreign exchange receipts typically take the form of branch plants and other facilities of the
multinational corporations -- facilities which are difficult or impossible to integrate into the structure of the local
economy. What is more,sateIIite countries which depend on direct investment ordinarily provide free currency con-
vertibility and hence foreign-owned enterprises which produce for local markets have privileged access to foreign ex-
change earned in other sectors of the economy.

 

  

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. I0)

Another feature of economic domination is the control of local savings, which assumes two forms. First, economic rule
means that local government revenues, or ublic savings, are mortgaged to loans received from the metropolitan powers.
An extreme example is Liberia - a country with an open door polic with regard to foreign capital - which in I963 ex-
pended 94 per cent of its annual revenues to repay foreign loans.3 In the l9th century, persuasion, coercion, and out-
right conquest often insured that tariffs and other taxes were turned over to foreign bondholders. In the absence of di-
rect colonial rule, however, foreign lending was frequently a precarious undertaking. Latin American countries, for
example, had an uneven history of bond payments. Foreign loans today are secured in more peaceful and more effec-
tive ways. The international capital market is highly centralized and dominated by the agencies of the main imperialist
powers -- the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund, and other fi-
nancial institutions. No longer is it possible for borrowing countries to play one lending country off against another, V
or to default on their obligations or unilaterally scale down their debt without shutting the door on future loans. That
no country has ever defaulted on a World Bank loan, or failed to amortize a loan on schedule, is eloquent testimony to
the ability of the advanced capitalist countries to mortgage local tax receipts to foreign loans.

Secondly, private savings are mobilized by foreign corporations and governments in order to advance the interests of
foreign capital. Foreign companies float local bond issues, raise equity capital, and generally attempt to monopolize
available liquid resources in order to extend their field of operations and maximize profits. World Bank affiliates fi-
nance local Development Banks which scour the country for small and medium size savings to funnel into local and for-
eign enterprise. The United States government acquires a significant portion of the money supply of India and other
countries through its policy of selling surplus foodstuffs for local currencies which it makes available to United States
corporations. In these and other ways foreign interests today exercise control of local private savings.

A final feature of economic domination is the control of mineral, agricultural, manufacturing, and other real assets,
and the organization and management of trade by. foreign corporations. In Africa, for example, French bulk-buying‘
companies in the ex-colonies monopolize the purchase and sale of coffee, peanuts, palm-oil products, and other com-
modities produced by small and medium-sized growers. In Mexico, one foreign corporation organizes the great part of
cotton production and exportation. Frequently control of commerce necessitates financial domination. The United
States, for example, has penetrated Mexico's financial structure with the aim of restricting Mexican-Latin American
trade in order to insure control of Latin American markets for itself.37A Control of iron, copper, tin, oil, bauxite, and
other mineral resources is in the hands of a handful of giant corporations. In some countries, foreign interests dominate
the commanding heights of the economy -- transportation, power, communication, and the leading manufacturing in-
dustries. These examples should suffice to show that foreign control of real, as well as of liquid, assets extends into

. all branches of local economies and penetrates every economically backward region in the world capitalist system.

The Main Featuresof Contemporary Imperialism

These examples of specific kinds of economic domination illustrate most of the main features of contemporary imperial-
ism which can be summarized as follows:

First, the further concentration and centralization of capital, and the integration of the world capitalist economy into
the structures of the giant United States-based multi-national corporations, or integrated conglomerate monopolistic
enterprises; and the acceleration of technological change under the auspices of these corporations.

Second, the abandonment of the ‘free’ international market, and the substitution of administered prices in commodity
~trade _and investment; and the determination of profit margins through adjustments in the internal accounting schemes of

the multi-national corporations.

Third, the active participation of state capital in international investment; subsidies and guarantees to privateinvest-
ment; and a global foreign policy which corresponds to the global interests and perspective of the multi-national corpo-
ration.

Fourth, the consolidation of an international ruling class constituted on the basis of ownership and control of the multi-

national corporations, and the concomitant decline of national rivalries initiated by the national power elites in the ad-
vanced capitalist countries; and the internationalization of the world capital market by the World Bank and other agen-
cies of the international ruling class.

Fifth, the intensification of all of these tendencies arising from the threat of world socialism to the world capitalist
system.

WHY IMPERIALISM ?

The general features of contemporary imperialism are much better understood than the sources of economic expansion,
the specific contradictions in the metropolitan economies which drive the multi—national corporations to extend their
scale of operations over the entire globe. As we have seen, Hobson explained l9th century British imperialism by way
of reference to inequalities in the distribution of income, while Lenin rested his case on the declining rate of profit in
the home economy. Neither of these explanations are very useful today, at least in the form which they have come
down to us. In the first place, the advanced capitalist economies have become mass consumption societies; secondly,
savings have become concentrated in the hands of the government, financial intermediaries, and trust funds, as well
as a relatively few giant corporations; thirdly, the concept of ‘the’ rate of profit is out-of-date. In the overcrowded
competitive sector of the advanced capitalist economies the profit rate remains a datum, a given, but in the oligopo-
listic sector profit margins are themselves determined by corporate price, output, and investment policies.

‘ECONOMIC SURPLUS

Some contemporary Marxist economists have proposed an alternative approach to the problem of identifying the impor-
tant economic contradictions in advanced capitalist societies. These approaches are based on the elementary concept _
of economic surplus, which Baran and Sweezy define as the difference between total national product and socially ne-
cessary costs of production.38 Total product is the aggregate value of all commodities and services produced in a given
period of time, or, alternatively, total business, worker, and government expenditures. Nowhere in the literature is
there a satisfactory discussion of the meaning of socially necessary costs. A working definition is the outlays which are
required to maintain the labor force and society's productive capacity in their present state of productivity or efficiency.

Economic surplus consists of outlays which either augment productive capacity and increase labor skills and efficiency,
or are used for economically wasteful or destructive ends. Any specific expenditure item which can be reallocated from
one use to another without affecting total ‘production (e.g. military expenditures to foreign gifts) falls into the general
category of economic surplus. An expenditure item which can not be reallocated from one employment to another (e.g.
wages of workers in basic food industries to military expenditures) without reducing total production can be defined as a
necessary cost. Unlike total output, neither necessary costs nor surplus is easily quantifiable, particularly since many
outlays, highway expenditures for example, comprise both costs and surplus. Hence it is not possible to calculate with
any great precision the proportion of total product which is constituted by surplus, nor can the relation between total
product and surplus over a span of time be known with absolute certainty. Nevertheless, there is powerful indirect evi-
dence that the surplus in relation to total product in the advanced capitalist countries tends to increase historically.

Provisionally identifying surplus with corporate profits, sales expenditures, and taxes, Baran and Sweezy demonstrate
easily that corporate price and cost policies result in an absolute and relative increase in the surplus. In a nutshell,
the corporations stabilize prices around an upward secular trend, while constantly seeking to increase efficiency by
reducing production costs. Cost reduction are not transmitted to consumers in the form of lower prices, but rather are
channeled into new investment, sales expenditures, and taxes.

The questions thus arise: What are the various ways available to advanced capitalist countries to absorb the increasing 
economic surplus, or raise the level of demand? and, What are the limits on their absorptive capacity? These are ob-
viously large and complex questions the answers to which we can do no more than suggest here.

Within the metropolitan economy the economic surplus is absorbed in three distinctive ways.39 Expenditures on produc- 
tive investment in both physical and human capital are the first, and historically most important, mode of surplus utiliza-
tion. lnvestment outlays are made on both private and government account. In the private sector of the economy, in-
vestment opportunities are available in two distinct spheres, oligopolistic industries, dominated by the giant conglomer-
ate corporation, and competitive industries, characterized by relatively inefficient, small-scale enterprise. ln the for-
mer, technological change, which was at one time the most important outlet for investment-seeking funds, no longer

can be relied upon to absorb more than a tiny fraction of the surplus. In the first place, in the few older, stabilized
industries where competition between firms for larger shares of the market is at a minimum, there is a tendency to sup-
press new technologies in order to preserve the value of the existing productive capacity. There is, in Dobb's words,

‘an increasing danger of the ossification of an existing industrial structure owing to the reluctance or inability of entre-
preneurs to face the cost and the risks attendant upon such large-scale change. '40

 

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. 12)

Secondly, Baron and Sweezy have shown that in industries in which firms struggle to increase their share of the market
and hence are under considerable pressure to lower costs, the rate of introduction of new technology is reduced, thus
limiting the amount of investment.—seeking funds which can be profitably absorbed during any given period.‘ Lastly, as
Gillman and others have demonstrated, there has been a historic rise in fixed capital stock per employed worker, and a
decline in business fixed investment and producer durable equipment expenditures in relation to total national product.
Thus technological change - independent of the rate at which it is introduced into the production processes - tends in-
creasingly to be capital-saving.4 To put it another way, oligopolistic enterprises favor input-saving, rather than out-
put-increasing innovations when (and if) the industrial structure becomes relatively stabilized and a provisional market-"
sharing plan has been agreed upon. For their part, competitive industries are overcrowded, the turnover rate is high,
profit margins are minimal, and they offer few incentives to corporations with investment-seeking funds.

Productive investment outlays are also made on government, or state account, but most of these are merely special forms
of private investment and hence are determined by the rhythm of capital accumulation in the private sector. The costs

of these complementary investments - water investments in agricultural districts, for example - are borne by the taxpayer,
while the benefits are appropriated by private capitalists. The state also finances investments which aim to create fu-
ture profitable opportunities for private capital - examples are industrial development parks - but these discretionary
investments are limited by the need on the part of the state bureaucracy to iustify the extra tax burden (due to the ab-

sence of long-term investment horizons generally sharedby capitalist class and state officials), as well as by the lack

of new markets for final commodities.
Consumption-related Use of Surplus

Expenditures on private and social consumption over and above economic needs, or inexcess of outlays on necessary
costs, constitute the second mode of surplus utilization. These expenditures, like all economically wasteful outlays,
are limited to the degree that they can be rationalized within the logic of capitalist economy —- that is tosay, in so
far as they lead to greater profits. The proportion of current earnings which the corporation can channel into advertis-
ing expenditures, product differentiation, forced obsolescence, and other selling expenses, as well as other socially

S wasteful uses of the surplus, is limited to the- extent to which these outlays increase commodity demand, sales, and pro-

fits. There are also limits on the absorption of the surplus via borrowing private consumption demand from the future - _
that is, by the expansion of consumer credit - which are determined by the relation of current consumer income to loan
repayments. * '

Consumption outlays are also made by local, state, and Federal government bodies. A greater or lesser portion of edu-
cation, transportation, recreational, and cultural expenditures - in general, spending on social amenities - constitutes
social consumption, a special form of private consumption. Socially necessary costs make up a large part of social con-
sumption. Socially necessary costs make up a large part of social consumption, while much of the remainder comprises
economic waste. Again, government expenditures are limited by the ability of the political authority to rationalize
waste within the framework of private profit—making.- In addition, there are political limits onrthe expansion of spend-
ing destined for public housing, health, and other socio—economic activities which are inconsistent with the hierarchy

’ of rank and privileges in a capitalist society, or which competelwith private capital. The same conclusion can be drawn
‘in connection with the possibilities of redistributing income with the aim of raising the wage and salary share ‘of total

product - and hence private consumption expenditures - at the expense of private ‘profits. The only major type of dis-
cretionary state expenditure consistent with private ownership of the means of production, social and economic inequali-
ty, and other central features of a capitalist society is military spending. ’

IMPERIALISM AS A USE OF SURPLUS

The preceding sketch in no sense substitutes for a full-dress analysis of the surplus absorption capacity of the advanced
capitalist countries, in particular the United States, but rather provides ageneral background for the detailed explora-
tion of the possibilities of utilizing the economic surplus in the backward capitalist countries and the other advanced
capitalist societies. Our general conclusions are two—fold: First, the multi-national corporations are under unceasing
pressure to extend their field of operations outside the United States. Economic prosperity in the United States during

.the two decades since World War II has increasingly depended on military expenditures and overseas expansion. Be-

* In general, a consumer will not be able to borrow in order to finance new consumption when economically necessary
outlays (or costs), together with loan repayments, equal current income.

tween 1950 and i964, United States commodity exports, including the sales of overseas facilities of United States cor-
porations, rose nearly 270 per cent, while commodity sales at home increased only l26 per cent. Expectedly, earnings
on foreign investments make up a rising portion of after-tax corporate profits -- l0 per cent in 1950, and 22 per cent in
l964. In the strategic capital goods sector of the United States economy, ‘military and foreign purchases account for a
surprisingly large share of total output -- between 20 and 50 percent in twenty-orie of twenty-five industries, and over
80 per cent in two industries. Our second general conclusion is that overseas expansion since World War II has not
weakened, but intensified the antagonism between the generation and absorption of the economic surplus.

Close examination of the two modes of surplus utilization overseas is required to substantiate these claims. Foreign
commodity trade is the first, and, until the era of monopoly capitalism, the only important way of absorbing the sur-
plus abroad. Contemporary state policies which seek to promote commodity trade encounter a number of crippling »
handicaps. For one thing, low-cost supplier credits and other forms of export subsidies provided by state agencies such
as the lmport-Export Bank merely export the surplus absorption problem abroadiand hence meet with resistance from
other advanced capitalist countries. A comprehensive system of export subsidies is almost guaranteed to result in re-
taliation in kind. The widely adopted 'most favored nation‘ clause in international trade agreements was an expression
of the willingness to ‘give and take‘ on the part of the advanced capitalist countries in the immediate post-war period.
Second, in recent decades United States commodity exports have run consistently ahead of imports, limiting the ability
of the United States to wring tariff concessions from other countries without‘ offering even greater reductions in return.
Third, United States penetration of Europe, regions in the sphere of influence of the European imperialist powers, and
the semi-independent backward capitalist countries which employ tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls to can-
serve foreign exchange by reducing imports is increasingly restricted by a revival of economic nationalism, as well as
by the birth of a new economic regionalism -- that is, by what Joan Robinson has termed The New Mercantilism.

Private foreign investments and state loans and grants constitute the second/and today far and away the most important,
mode of surplus absorption. Capital exports may increase demand in one of two ways: first, by borrowing demand from
the future and directly expanding the market for capital goods; second, by raisingproduction and income abroad and l
therefore indirectly ‘increasing imports in the recipient country or in third countries.

ln recent years there have been three new tendencies in capital exporting which support the conclusion that it will be.-
come increasingly difficult to find outlets abroad for the investment-seeking surplus generated by the multi-national"
corporations. These tendencies are: first, increased collaboration between foreign and local capital; second, the shift
in the composition of foreign investments against primary commodity sectors and in favor of manufacturing and related
activities; and third, the shift in the composition of capital exports against private investment and in favor of state loans
and grants. All three tendencies are related to the development of anti-colonial and national independence movements
in the backward capitalist countries. A brief review of the general implications of national independence for foreign
investment opportunities is therefore in order.

Political lndependence and Foreign Capital

Gillman and others have put forward two arguments which support the view that national independence reduces opportuni-
ties for the penetration of foreign capital._ In the first place, it is asserted that public ownership of the means of produc-

» tion in the ex-colonies encroaches on the traditional territory of private capital’ and limits investment opportunities .

available to the international monopolies. This line of reasoning is not only at odds with the facts: - inthe backward
capitalist countries joint state-private ventures are more characteristic than state enterprise - but.—also pushes aside the
critical question of the control of capital. In a number of countries, including many European capitalist nations, the
state is the nominal owner of many heavy industrial and infra-stfucture facilities, but control rests with an autonomous
bureaucracy which is highly responsive’ to the needs of private capital. The vast» majority of state and joint enterprises
in the backward countries are market-oriented, integrated into the structure of the private market. Far from discourag-
ing foreign investors, one task of state enterprise in many countries is to attract new private investment. ’

Secondly, there is the argument that anti-colonial sentiment and the urge for an independent field of economic action
lead to exchange controls, restrictions on profit remittances,” higher business taxes, more costly social legislation‘, and
other policies which are‘repugnant to foreign capital. Against this view it should be stressed that the economic autono-l
my of politically independent countries is itselfga question for analysis. Military coups in Brazil, Indonesia,’ and Gha-
na, to cite only three recent counter-revolutionary movements, provide dramatic evidence for the view that political
autonomy must be insured by economic autonomy. Again, "seven" long-independent Latin American countries with such
disparate attitudes toward foreign capital as Chile and Peru - historically the former has been less permissive than the
latter - collectively signed the Treaty of Montevideo (i960) which favored foreign investment, and recognized the need

  

(The Meaning of Economic imperialism, p. M)

for foreigr: capital in economic development.43 On the other side, China, Cuba, and other countries which have
abandoned the world capitalist system obviously hold little promise for foreign capital. _

In reality, there are a number of reasons to believe that politically independent, economically under-exploited coun-

tries will continue to welcome private foreign capital. First, and perhaps most important, local financiers and indus-

trialists are eager to participate in profitable economic activities initiated by the multi-national corporations based in

the advanced countries. Joint ventures and other partnership arrangements are looked upon with great favor by local '
business interests.44 Tariff policy is designed to encourage assembly, packaging, and other final manufacturing invest-

ments not only to promote the development of national industry but also to increase the flow of foreign capital and open

up profit opportunities for the local bourgeoisie. V '

Secondly, the Latin American countries, as well as the ex-colonies in Asia and Africa, are under great pressure from

the masses to initiate and promote economic and social development. ln these non-socialist countries local sources of
capital are dissipated in luxury consumption and other wasteful expenditures, or cannot be mobilized in the absence of
fundamental agrarian and other economic reforms, and hence local governments increasingly depend on foreign capital,
privateias well as public. Most ex-colonial governments are desperately searching for ways to conserve foreign exchange
and actively seek foreign investments and loans. Third, British and French foreign investments are welcome in back-
ward countries which belong to one or the other of these metropoles' currency blocs - where exchange controls are
minimal or entirely absent - because there are few if any ways to acquire‘ private foreign capital from other advanced
capitalist countries. British investments, for example, are more and more oriented to Sterling Area countries.45 Fourth,
backward countries which have no ambition beyond expanding exports of primary commodities require active foreign
participation in the export sector because of the difficulties of independently acquiring and maintaining distribution
channels and marketing outlets. After Bolivia nationalized the tin mines, for example, planning of production and

sales was partly thwarted because the government ‘remained beholden to the some big companies for processing and
sale'.

On the other side, there are at least two reasons for believing that political independence has discouraged some for-
eign investment, although it is difficult to even guess how much. In the first place, foreign corporations hesitate to
invest in the absence of political controls which prevent local firms from using unpatented production processes to in-
vade third—country markets or to pass on to competitors.47 Second, the ex-colonies have eliminated or reduced in many
spheres of the economy the special privileges and exclusive rights which corporations based in the colonial power once
took for granted. The increased risk and uncertainty which face foreign capital has discouraged investments by small-
scale enterprises which are unable to finance multi-plant, multi-country operations.

The Reduction of Surplus Absorption Capacity: Use of Local Savings. . .

Anti-colonialism, political independence, and the elimination of the colonial powers from many formal economic com-

mand posts have contributed to three new tendencies in foreign investment which reduce the surplus absorption capacity

of the backward capitalist countries. There is overwhelming evidence of the first tendency, the growing mobilization of

local savings and capital by foreign corporations which diminishes the need for capital exports from the advanced coun-

tries. In Latin America, local capital is the most important source of financing for wholly-owned subsidiaries of United »
States corporations. One-half of American and Foreign Power Company's $400 million post-war expansion program in
eleven countries was financed from local savings, the other half from retained earnings.50 A $72 million investment in
Argentina by five oil companies illustrates the character of modern overseas finance; the corporations’ investment amountj '
ed to only’$l8 million; debentures raised $30 million in Argentina; and the United States government and local invest-

ment corporations supplied the remainder.5l In the capitalist world as a whole, roughly one-third of total US corporate
financing overseas in l964 comprised foreign borrowing or equity financing, and foreign supplies of capital made up

two-thirds of the increase in financing over l963 levels.5 _

The multi-national corporations mobilize local savings and capital in a variety of ways: bonds and equities are sold in
local capital markets; joint ventures and mixed enterprises mobilize private and state capital, respectively; local de-
velopment and investment banks acquire local savings directly, and indirectly via local governments; foreign and do-
mestic banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries have access to pools of local savings. To cite one
example, Morgan Guarantee Trust Company's l6 correspondent banks in Venezuela hold 55 per cent of privately-owned
commercial bank resources, and help foreign firms raise local funds. Morgan is also part-owngr of a large Spanish in-
vestment bank which in a two-year period raised $40 million for local and foreign companies. 4 The World Bank pio-

neered in the organization and contributes to the financing of local development banks, develops and integrates capital
markets in countries where monetary institutions are weak, and acts as a wedge for private foreign capital into estab-

 

 

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. I5)

Iished capital markets.*

The growing demand by the international monopolies for local capital is prompted by both political and economic factors.
First, and probably most important, both the multi-national corporations and local bourgeoisies are eager to form partner-
ship arrangements, the former to exercise indirect control over, and politically neutralize, the latter, the latter in order
to share in the profits of the former.56 In Nigeria, for example, ‘foreign investors are beginning to realize that their
presence constitutes a political problem and that it is in their interest to encourage Negerian participation in the struc-
ture of their firms to enhance acceptability. '57 Joint ventures and partnerships are up-to-date versions of the colonial
policy of creating a dependent, passive local bourgeoisie; British capital, to cite perhaps the most important instance,
allied itself with the largest and best organized Indian monopolies, such as those dominated by the Tatas and Birlas, as

a hedge against possible discrininatory action by the Indian government.

Second, the alliance between foreign and local capital inhibits potential economic competition and paves the way for
the diversification of the foreign ogerations of the international monopolies, and extends their control over reIated.pro-
duct fields in the local economy.5 Even in countries such as Mexico, where the government refuses to extend its co-
operation to foreign corporations which compete with local business or displace local capital, foreigners often have ‘de-
cisive influence' over company policy because domestic equity owngbship is dispersed and minority stock ownership is
concentrated in the hands of one or two United States corporations. Extending the sphere of corporate operations
opens up opportunities for increased profits in the form of royalties and fees for technical services, patents, and brand
names. What is more, the use of local capital reduces the risk of conducting operations in foreign countries; local capi-
tal is smaller and less diversified than foreign capital and therefore is more vulnerable and assumes a disproportionate
risk. In addition, local businessmen are valuable for their knowledge of domestic product and labor markets, govern-
ment contacts, and other information which insures secure and profitable operations overseas. Finally, the international
monopolies profit by spreading their capital thin in branches of production characterized by economies of large-scale
production.

. . . Growth of Investment in Manufacturing. . .

The growth of private foreign investment in manufacturing industries, and the relative decline of agricultural and min-
ing investments, is the second new tendency in capital exporting. The development of synthetic fibers, the rise in ag-1‘
ricultural productivity in the advanced countries, the inelastic demand for foodstuffs, the reduction in the mineral com-
ponent in production (e.g. non-ferrous metals), and tariff walls erected by the advanced capitalist countries against .
imports of primary commodities have reduced the demand for investment funds abroad in mining and agriculture. Tariffs,
quotas, and other measures to protect manufacturing industries in the backward countries and regional marketing arrange-
ments in Europe and elsewhere have compelled the large corporations in the United States to construct or purchase manu-
facturing facilities abroad to retain traditional markets. In turn, the expansive impulses of the multi-national corpora-
tion have affected world-wide capital ‘flows and the production and distribution of commodities.

Accurate comparable statistics covering long spans of time are not available, but the benchmark data shown in Table I
below suggest the general order of magnitude of change.

cent of US manufacturing investments in all backward regions) increased from $2I0 million to $2,340 million, or from

I0 per cent to 25 per cent of total Latin American holdings. In the some period, agricultural investments remained un-

changed, mining investments doubled, and the value of petroleum holdings rose from $572 million to $3, I42 million.

A similar trend is visible in connection with British investments in India. In I9I I, about three-quarters of all direct

private investments were in extractive industries, utilities and transportation accounted for roughly one-fifth, and the

remainder was divided between commerce and manufacturing. In I956, manufacturing investments made up over one- ,
third of the total, commerce another one-fourth, and plantation investments only one-fifth. As Hamza Alavi has writ-

ten, ‘this is a complete contrast from the old pattern' of investment holdings.“ Of all British direct foreign invest-

ments (excluding oil) in I965, Kemp has estimated that manufacturing investments constituted about one-half, the =
great part located in other advanced capitalist countries.

Turning again to the United States, Table II below summarizes the distribution of direct investments by region and in-
dustry in I964.

Most United States manufacturing investments in backward countries are concentrated in consumer goods fabrication,
assembly and packaging, and light chemicals. The pattern is roughly the same in the advanced capitalist economies,
with the single exception that investments in industrial equipment facilities are more common. During I958—I959,

of I64 US investments in new or expanded manufacturing enterprises in Latin America, I06 were located in the chemi-
cal and consumer good sectors; in other backward regions, the number of facilities were 34 and 24, respectiveIy._63

In connection with opportunities for capital exporting, and the significance of capital exports for absorbing the eco-
nomic surplus, I9th century and mid-20th century imperialism differ in a number of profound respects. In the earlier
period, foreign investments were concentrated in raw material and mineral production, and the economic satellites
were no more than extensions of the metropolitan economies. Overseas capital expenditures opened up cheap sources
of productive inputs, and lowered the costs of production in manufacturing industries in the metropoles. In turn, home
and foreign demand for manufactured goods increased, prompting an expansion of output and fresh rounds of foreign in-
vestment. To the degree that capital exports were channeled into railroad and other transportation facilities, there were
favorable indirect effects on the availability of raw materials, and hence manufacturing costs in the metropoles. For
I9th century Great Britain, this cumulative, expansive system worked to perfection. Income generated in the satellites
by the inflow of capital was expended on British manufactured exports. During periods of rising foreign investment,
British exports rose faster than imports, and a consistently favorable balance of payments was maintained.

To be sure, contemporary imperialist powers continue to import many raw materials, and petroleum needs expand at a
rapid pace. The economic relationships between the metropolitan economies and their satellites, however, differ in
important respects. Petroleum production is concentrated in the hands of a few oligopolists which maintain rigid price

political independence to promote and direct new ventures and to participate in existing enterprises by subscribing to
equity capital issues. ‘Development Finance Corporations‘, in which British and German capital are deeply involved,
were est blished more recently, specialize in loans and grants, and promote partnerships between African and European
capital. 6

structures and fail to pass on reductions in exploration, drilling, and production costs to consumers. The same conclusion
can be drawn with regard to other raw materials (iron and copper, for example) for which the ratio of imports to US pro-
duction is higher than in the pre-war era. Moreover, in comparison with other regions, imports have increased more
rapidly from Latin American countries, which have met the expansion of demandfor copper, tin, manganese, cocoa,

and other commodities largely by diverting sales from other markets, rather than by expanding supplies. The basic rea-
son is that Latin American raw material production is today highly monopolized, and, in addition, operates, under
conditions of decreasing returns to large-scale P"oduction. Thus neither new capital outlays nor modernization invest-
ments have significantly reduced the costs of production of primary commodities, and, unlike investments in the earlier
period, are not self-perpetuating. What is more , international commodity agreements and regional marketing arrange-
ments reduce competition between raw material producing countries, and tend to maintain prices at relatively high levels.

Manufacturing investments in backward countries fall into one of two categories. Tariff-hopping investments, quanti-
tatively most significant, are defensive moves which enable the international corporations to retain established export
markets, and merely change the locale of investment from the metropole to the satellite. These outlays fail to expand
commodity demand, and hence do not provide growing outlets for the economic surplus. Opportunities for other manu-
facturing investments in backward countries are also generally limited to import-substitute activities because domestic
markets are typically oriented toward middle and upper class consumption patterns which are imitative of those in the
advanced countries. Export markets for satellite manufactured goods are weak because national and regional monopolies
operate behind high tariff walls, and, in addition, monopoly controls which the multi-national corporations exercise
over international distribution systems and marketing outlets place insurmountable barriers to large-scale satellite manu-
facturing exports. For these reasons, the United States has shown a growing interest in new regional marketing groupings
such as the Latin American Free Trade Area and the Central American Common Market. One of the chief objectives of
the Common Market during its formative period (l958—l962) was to attract fresh supplies of foreign capital. There are
two important barriers, however, to flourishing regional marketing arrangements in economically backward areas. First,
less productive, entrenched local monopolies put up a tenacious struggle to retain their privileged market positions --

in comparison with the giant, integrated European cartels and monopolies which promoted the European Common Market.
Secondly, the new preferential trading areas in backward regions are too small to compete effectively with Britain's
Sterling Area or the European Economic Community. In sharp contrast to the upsurge of United States investment in
Canada after the expansion of the Imperial Preference System in I932, to cite one example, dollar flows of fresh in-
vestment to the new trading areas will be limited.65 r

We have finally to consider opportunities for manufacturing investments in other advanced economies. As we have seen,
in recent years the great mass of United States manufacturing investments have been in Europe and‘ Canada. Most of
these investments have been tariff-shopping operations, or have been channeled into the purchas of existing facilities.
Moreover, United States corporations have increasingly been compelled to penetrate lines of projuction which are com-
petitive with United States exports. Similar to the effect of British reconstruction investments in Europe following World
War I, United States capital flows to other advanced capitalist countries tend to be self-defeating in the long run. An
excellent illustration is provided by one study of the impact of H2 British subsidiary companies in Europe on British ex-
ports; only 5.6 per cent of the subsidiaries' capital outlays was expended on British capital goods. Only investments
in distribution facilities, specifically motivated to expand foreign sales, can be expected to significantly increase com-
modity exports. ’

These lines of analysis suggest that the surplus absorption capacity of both the advanced and backward countries - in
both traditional and newer branches of the economy - will in the future be limited to replacement demand, together

- with the modest flow of new investments necessary to keep pace with expanding incomes abroad. Reflecting the mar-

ginal impact of foreign investments on United States commodity exports is the continuing, although muted, crisis in the
United States’ balance of payments.

. . . State Loans Replace Private

Roughly the same conclusion can be drawn in connection with public and international loans. The third, and perhaps
most striking, tendency in capital exporting is the substitution of state loans for private capital outflows. About two-
thirds of all capital exports are on state or international (public) account. As Table III shows, nearly three-quarters
of all loans and investments destined for backward capitalist countries originate in the public or international sector.
In I964, the net outflow of resources to satellite countries and multi-national agencies (which in turn loans funds to
the satellites) amounted to nearly $8 billion, of which less than $2 billion was private.

The relationship between private and public capital flows is highly complex, and a brief analysis inevitably runs the
risk of over-simplification. Reduced to essentials, however, state loans serve two mainpurposes. First, public funds
which build up the infra-structure of backward countries frequently complement private’ capital flows and represent
merely a special form of private investment, the costs of which are borne by taxpayers in the lending country. With
regard to surplus absorption capacity within the infra-structure sectors of backward countries, the same conclusion
reached in our discussion of private investment can be applied a fortiori.

Second, the character of United States 'aid' programs underlines their growing importance as projected points of entry
for private capital . Many Export—lmport Bank loans are made with the purpose of encouraging the flow of private in-
vestment -- since i960 the Bank has offered long-term loans of up to five years. Provisions of Public Law 480, the
‘Food for Peace"program, are ‘designed almost entirely for the purpose of stimulating the flow of US private investment
to the less-developed countries'.68 Under this program, the United States government loans local currencies acquired
from the sale of surplus agricultural commodities to American corporations in order to finance thelocal costs of invest-
ment proiects. The greatest portion of both the interest and principal is reloaned either to private investors or local
governments. ‘How useful to our own foreign aid and foreign development programs could it be,‘ the president of one
multi-national corporation has written, ‘if these funds, in local currencies, were to be loaned on an increasing scale
to competitive private borrowers - either Americans or others - for local investment. . . '69 Finally, the United States‘
Agency for International Development grants survey loans to American corporations, paying one—half of the cost of
feasibility studies in the event it is decided not to proceed with the investment.

The international agencies, in particular, the World Bank, are also beacon lights for private investment. Originally
regarded by the leading imperialist nations as a way to restore‘private international capital movements by guaranteeing

private loans, the World Bank has been compelled to centralize and rationalize the world capital market. The Bank

has eliminated many of the anarchic features of international capital movements, supervises vast amounts of capital
which penetrate the backward countries, and acts as a funnel for private capital in search of safe, profitable returns --
banks and investment houses participate in World Bank loans, and the Bank frequently floats bond issues in United States
and European money markets. ln part dependent on private money market conditions, most Bank activities are financed
by subscribed or borrowed government funds. The Bank is thus relatively autonomous, and allocates vast amounts of
capital for large-scale infra-structure proiects in order to clear the way for private investment flows.

MODERN lMPER|ALlSM'S FOREIGN POLICY

Whether or not private capital responds to the incentives held out by national governments and international agencies
depends on a host of factors, chief among which are the investment 'climate' in the satellite economies and the charac-
ter of other state political-economic policies. Both themes run through much of the discussion insubsequent chapters
(of the book of which this work forms a part--publisher's note). Suffice it for now to note some of the maior differences
between imperialist foreign policy in the l9th and mid-20th centuries.

THE MEANING OF ‘ECONOMIC IMPERIALISM
by James O'Connor

THEORIES OF IMPERIALISM

There is Sfill much controversy, and more confusion, about the meaning of economic imperialism. Monopolistic privi-
leges and preferences, plunder of raw materials, seizure of territory, enslavement of local peoples, nationalism, racism,
militarism -- all of these phenomena have been closely identified with imperialism. Only on the association of imperial-
ism with expansion - economic, political, cultural and territorial expansion - has there been any general agreement. But
if imperialism means ‘the extension of political power by one state over another, (then) all through the sixty centuries

of more or less recorded history‘ it has been a principle feature in human relations. Beneath the undergrowth of over
half a century of historical, theoretical, and polemical writings, however, three general doctrines can be distinguished.
Two of these reflect the period of European expansion which began during the T8805 and ended in l9l4. The third is

an interpretation of contemporary world capitalism, and, in particular, United States expansionism. T

IMPERIALISM: A POLITICAL PHENOMENON

The first doctrine disassociates capitalism from imperialism. For Joseph Schumpeter, the leading exponent of this view,
imperialism is ‘a heritage of the autocratic state. . . the outcome of precapitalist forces which the autocratic state has
reorganized. . . (and) would never have been evolved by the "inner logic" of capitalism itself. '2 The ‘inner logic‘ of
capitalism consists of nothing more or less than free trade and ‘where free trade prevails no class has an interest in forci-
ble expansion as such. . . citizens and goods of every nation can move in foreign countries-as freely as though those
countries were politically their own.‘ Only the ‘export monopolist interests‘ - in particular, monopolies in the metro-
politan countries which dump surplus commodities abroad behind high tariff walls - profit from imperialism. Schumpeter
was confident that these interests would not survive capitalism's ‘inner logic‘. His confidence was, of course, mis-
placed; as we will see, the national and regional economic policies of the advanced capitalist countries today rightly
merit Mrs. Joan Robinson's label -- the New Mercantilism. The reason is not hard to find: Schumpter selected one
characteristic of capitalism, ‘rationality’, which he considered central, to the exclusion of other features.

The vast majority of bourgeois economists in the past and present adopt a position similar to Schumpeter's, even though
few today would share his optimism in connection with the revival of free trade. The generally accepted ‘comparative
advantage‘ theory of Ricardo and Mill holds that all parties in international commodity trade under competitive condi-
tions benefit in accordance with the strength of the demand for their respective commodities. Nationalist economic _
policy and monopoly restricted free trade and inhibited the growth of income and economic well-being, but these bar-
riers have been lowered by the breakup of the European empires. The trademark of this doctrine is that exploitive eco-
nomic relations between the advanced and backward capitalist countries cannot survive in a world of politically inde-
pendent countries. According to this line of thinking, the real problems of world capitalism today spring from the mis-
placed faith of the ex-colonies that nationalist economic policies which have created new and higher barriers to inter-
national investment and trade can put the backward countries on the path of self-sustained economic growth.

Schumpeter and other bourgeois writers uncritically disassociate' capitalism from imperialism for three reasons: first,
because their criteria for distinguishing and identifying imperial and colonial relationships are ordinarily political and
not economic (for example, Hans Kohn has developed the most sophisticated typology of imperialism, which he under-
stands in terms of the distribution of political power) ; second, because they do not consider capitalism as such to be
an exploitive system; third, because imperialism historically has contained certain features identified with the theme of
expansionism which have not been uniquely associated with any given economic and social system. Thus bourgeois
writers have concluded not only that imperialism pre-dates capitalism but also that imperialism is essentially an ana-
chronistic system. For this reason, there have been few investigations of the specific features of capitalist imperialism.

In connection with economic expansionism, pre-capitalist and capitalist societies differ in five general ways: First, in
pre-capitalist societies, economic expansion was irregular, unsystematic, not integral to normal economic activity.

In capitalist societies, foreign trade and investment are rightly considered to be the ‘engines of growth‘. Expansion is
necessary to maintain the rhythm of economic activity in the home, or metropolitan economy, and has an orderly, me-
thodical, permanent character. Second, in pre-capitalist societies, the economic gains from expansion were windfall
gains, frequently taking the form of sporadic plunder. In capitalist societies, profits from overseas trade and invest-
ment are an integral part of national income, and considered in a marter-of—fact manner.

Third, in pre-capitalist societies, plunder acquired in the course of expansion was often consumed in the field by the

 

  

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. i9)

tries in the backwash of world capitalism. The methods of establishing political control are varied. The use of old eco-
nomic and political ties is practiced whenever possible; these include the relationships formed within the British Common-
wealth and the French Community, closed currency zones, preferential trading systems, military alliances, and political-
military pacts. Economic, political, and cultural missions, labor union delegations, ioint military training programs,
military grants, bribes to local ruling classes in the form of economic 'aid', substitute for direct colonial rule. Only
when indirect policies fail are the older instruments of coercion and force brought into play, and the principle of con-
tinuity in change applies. An excellent example is the United States-instigated and supported coua}ter-revolution in
Guatemala in 1954, the accomplishments of which the State Department listed under four headings: 0

1. ‘The conclusion of an agreement with a United Fruit Company subsidiary providing for the return of property
expropriated by the Arbenz Government.‘ ’
2. ‘The repeal of the law affecting remittances and taxation of earnings from foreign capital.’
3. ‘The signing of an Investment Guarantee Agreement with the United States.'
4. ‘The promulgation of a new and more favorable petroleum law.'

Within Guatemala, the Armas regime in the post-i954 period was maintained in office via contracts with United Fruit, _
Bond and Share, and other monopolies.

Secondly, contemporary imperialist states enioy relatively more financial, and hence political, autonomy. ln the l9th
century, imperialist countries regarded themselves as dependent on the private capital market for raising funds for dis-
cretionary state expenditures and were compelled to pursue economic and fiscal policies designed to make it possible for
their colonies to meet their private debt service. The dominant state capitalist countries today are financially indepen-
dent and can follow a more flexible policy toward their satellites. The reason is that both the potential and actual eco-
nomic surplus are comparatively large. The potential surplus is large because the normal tendency of monopoly capital-
ist economies is stagnation and unemployment of labor and capital, attributable to a deficiency of aggregate demand.
State expenditures - including military expenditures and foreign loans and grants - normally increase not only aggre-
gate demand but also real income and output, and hence the tax base. A rise in expenditures thus increases revenues,
even if tax rates remain unchanged. State expenditures are partly self-financing and virtually costless in terms of the
real resources utilized. The actual economic surplus constitutes a relatively large portion of national product because
of technological and productivity advances. For these reasons, taxes (and state expenditures) make up a large share of
national product with few serious adverse effects on economic incentives, and thus on total production itself.

The significance of the financial independence of the contemporary imperialist state for foreign policy lies in its
ability to export capital - or absorb the surplus overseas - without a quid pro quo. The Marshall Plan, the extensive
program of military aid and grants, and the low-cost loans extended to backward countries by AID are the main exam-
ples of this mode of surplus absorption. The surplus absorption capacity of satellite countries which are closely tied to
the United States political-military blox is for practical purposes unlimited. Two factors, however, circumscribe state
grants without a quid pro quo. First, low-cost state loans and grants—in—aid, or capital exports which are not extended
on normal commercial principles, compete ‘unfairly’ with private loans are are reslsfecl by private capitalist interests
in the metropolitan economy. Second, metropolitan governments are unable io discipline their satellites effectively
unless there are economic strings attached to international loans. Moreover, state bilateral and multilateral loans fi-
nanced in private capital markets in the advanced countries must earn a return sufficient to cover the cost of borrowing
and administration. Opportunities for capital exports extended on commercial principles are limited by the availability
of profitable investment projects.

l9th century and mid-20th century imperialism depart in a third important respect. In the l9th century there were few
important antagonisms between Great Britain's role as the leading national capitalist power on the one hand, and as the
dominant imperialist power on the other. Policies designed to expand Britain's home economy extended capitalist modes
o_f~production and organization to the three under-exploited continents, directly and indirectly strengthening the grow-
irig British imperial system.* For this reason, foreign policy ordinarily served private foreign investors and other private
foreign investors and other private interests oriented to overseas activity. Only occasionally - as in the case of Disraeli's

(*‘ The argument that Britain's home economy suffered because it was deprived of capital which was absorbed abroad is
fallacious_. On the one hand, given the prvailing distribution of income and industrial organization, there were few
‘profitable opportunities to absorb the surplus at home; on the other hand, the return flow on foreign investments more
than offset the original capital exports.

 

  

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. 20)

decision to purchase Suez Canal shares in I875 72 - was foreign investment employed as a 'weapon' of British foreign
policy. Even less frequently did Britain promote private foreign investments with the purpose of aiding global foreign
policy objectives. *

By way of contrast, the national and international ambitions of the United States in the mid-20th century are continually

in conflict. In the context of the limited absorption capacity of the backward capitalist world and international compe-

tition from other advanced capitalist economies and the socialist countries, the United States is compelled to employ a _ a
wide range of policies to expand trade and investment. To further national ends, a 'partnership' between ‘public lending
institutions‘ and ‘private lenders‘ - with the former ‘leading the way‘ for the latter - has been formed.74 Underlining

the role of the state in the service of the multi-national corporations, in I962 Secretary of State Rusk described the ‘
newer government policies which extend beyond state loan programs -- investment guarantee programs in 46 backward

capitalist countries which cover currency inconvertibility, exproporiation, war, revolution, and insurrection; instruc-

tions to local embassies to support business interests by making ‘necessary representations to the host governments. . . ';

the creation of a new Special Assistant for International Business in the State Department in order to insure that private

business interests receive ‘prompt representation‘ in the government. Especially when public loans are disguised or

special forms of private loans (see above), the commitment of the United States government to national capitalist inter-

ests inhibits state policies which seek to strengthen the industrial bourgeoisie and ruling classes in other advanced coun-

tries and the national bourgeoisie in the backward nations. Perhaps this is the most important limit on capital exports

on public account.

As the leading international power, the United States is under constant and growing pressure to strengthen world capi-
talism as a system, including each of its specific parts. Policies which aim to recruit new members for local comprador
groups, stimulate the development of capitalist agriculture and the middle farmers, reinforce the dominance of local
financial and commercial classes, and reinvigorate local manufacturing activities -- these general policies pose a po-
tential or real threat to the interests of United States national capital. Alliance for Progress funds destined for the mid-
dle sectors of Latin American agriculture, Export-lmport bank loans to foreign commercialists, loans and grants to for-
eign governments dominated by the urban bourgeoisie, loans and subsidies to the Indian iron and steel industry, Mexican
industry and agriculture, and other branches of production in countries which are slowly industrializing -- these and
other stop-gap and long-range measures help to keep the backward countries in the imperialist camp in the short run,
but directly or indirectly create local capitalist interests which may demand their independence from United States

7 capital in the long run.

United States private capital increasingly requires the aid of the state, and the state enlists more and more private and
public capital in its crusade to maintain world capitalism intact. Specific and general capitalist interests serve each
other, finally merging. into one phenomenon, a certain one-ness emerges between them. This must have, finally, its
institutional reflection. The multi-national corporation has become the instrument for the creation and consolidation
of an international ruling class, the only hope for reconciling the antagonism {betw5een~I national and international in-
terests. ’

SURPLUS ABSORPTION OR SURPLUS CREATION?

The preceding analysis supports the conclusion that the surplus absorption capacity of the backward countries, and, prob-
ably to a lesser degree, the other advanced economies, and hence opportunities for utilizing investment-seeking funds in
overseas, are circumscribed in a variety of ways. Opportunities for ‘enterprise’, or profit-making, however, show few
signs of weakening. We have touched on some of the reasons: First, the multi-national corporations increasingly mo-
bilize and utilize local and state savings and capital, undertake more ambitious investment proiects, and profit from
economies of large-scale production and more efficient intra-corporate planning. Second, a larger share of the re-
tained earnings of corporation branch plants and subsidiaries is absorbed by modernization investments, which reduce
costs and raise profits. Third, the multi-national corporations monopolize patents, brand names, and production'pro-
cesses in the greatest demand, and are able to establish control over national and international markets via licensing

and similar agreements which require relatively small capital outlays. Fourth, the giant international corporations are
more and more integrated and diversified, and production and sales are subject to less risk and uncertainty. Lastly, the

* It has been suggested by one expert, however, that private investments were made to serve specific foreign
policy obiectives more frequently than it is ordinarily believed.7

 

  

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. 2l)

international monopolies can count on the active participation and aid of the state.

For these reasons, the multi-national corporations command growing profit margins on their overseas operations. Small
amounts of capital are sufficient to penetrate, control, and dominate the weaker, less productive national economies.
The price of disposing of a given amount of economic surplus this year is the creation of even more surplus next year --
hardly a high price for the individual corporation to pay, but from the standpoint of the metropolitan economy as a
whole, the problem of surplus absorption becomes increasingly severe.

The United States government, the European powers, and the United States-dominated international agencies are thus
under growing pressure by the international monopolies to formulate and implement political-economic policies which
will create an ‘attractive’ investment climate abroad, in particular in the under—exploited countries. Looked at from
another angle, the imperialist powers are increasi-ngly compelled to ‘promote economic development‘ overseas or, to
put it differently, to integrate the backward areas even more closely into the structure of world capitalism. In effect,
the advanced countries are desperately seeking to expand outlets for the economic surplus. To be sure, the imperialist
powers view the problem as one of surplus creation.(or profit-realization), rather than of surplus absorption -- their

line of vision generally corresponds in this respect with the perspective of the corporations themselves. These are merely
different sides to the same coin: by promoting profitable opportunities abroad for private capital , the state lays the ba-
sis for the absorption of a portion of this year's surplus, and, simultaneously, for the creation of additional surplus next
year.

For United States economic, political and foreign policy this line of analysis has a number of important consequences.
In the first place, national economic development programs in the backward countries which seek the participation of
the socialist countries and other advanced capitalist countries have been and will continue to be opposed by the United‘
States. Secondly, investments in lines of industry which are non-competitive with United States products, especially
those which increase demand for United States products, have been and will continue to be encouraged.

Thirdly, the participation of United States capital in the European economy (as well as the participation of European
capital in.,the backward countries) will increasingly be discouraged because these investments will eventually compete
with United States commodity exports.’ Fourth, the United States.will continue to initiate anti-socialist, anti-communist
military and political pacts and alliances with both backward and advanced capitalist countries -- for the international
monopolies the basic importance of state loans and aid lies in the long-run impact on the demand for arms, capital
equipment, and consumer goods in those satellites which have developed intimate political and military bonds with the

United States.

More generally, because the expansion of commodity exports, as well as capital exports, generate even more surplus in
the "future - because the process of surplus creation and absorption is a cumulative one - the United States is increasingly
compelled to followthe policies of a militant, expansive imperialist power, all in the name of economic development
for the underdeveloped countries. The task facing the United States in relation to the backward countries is truly Her-
culean. '

At one and the same time, the United States must convince the backward countries that the growing penetration of

United States capital, and the growing control of the multi-national companies over local economies, are useful and
necessary for their economic growth and development, at a time when politically oppressive policies which aim to cre-
ate more favorable conditions for private investment are followed. Thus eco°n°omic‘d'evelopment is oriented by the multi-
national companies, and where there are national development plans which on paper assign a certain limited role. to pri-
vate investment, in fact private investment assigns a role to the plan. The underdeveloped world becomes bound up even
more closely in a new imperialist system in which investments in consumer goods industries replace investments in raw ma-
terials and minerals; in which the backward countries are compelled to deal with a unified private capital-state capital
axis; in which political control by the World Bank and the other international agencies, together with the political arm
of the official labor movement, the giant foundations, and other quasi-private political agencies, replace colonial rule;
andgin which the national middle classes in the underdeveloped countries are slowly but surely transformed into a new
class of clients and compradors, in every important respect equivalent to the old class of traders, bankers, and landlords
which for centuries bowed and scraped before their imperial rulers inr_China’, India, Latin America and elsewhere. A new
era of imperialism is iust beginning, an era which holds out’-“contradictory promises to the imperial powers and their
clusters of satellites. Whether or not the advanﬁgd capitalist countries can deal with this crisis of their own making de-
pends on two basic factors: first, the power of.peop|‘es=ein the under—exploited continents to resist; and, secondly, the
flexibility of the structure of the imperialist systems.

pression, especially relief from tariff increases by Germany in I879 and France in I892. As we have seen, the final ‘reason’

conquering armies, leaving the home economy relatively unaffected. In capitalist societies, exploited territories are
fragmented and integrated into the structure of the metropolitan economy. Imperialism in effect potentially emanci-

pated space-bound and time-bound man. Fourth, in pre-capitalist societies debates within the ruling class ordinarily
revolved around the question whether or not to expand. In capitalist societies, ruling-class debates normally turn on
the issue, what is the best way to expand.

Last, in relation to colonialism, pre-capitalist and capitalist societies also differ in a fundamental way. In the former,
colonialism (land seizure, colonist settlement, or bath) was the only mode of control which the metropolitan power could
effectively exercise over the satellite region. As we will see later in detail, capitalist societies have developed alter-

native, indirect, and more complex forms of control. .

Mercantile vs. Industrial Capitalism

Not only do pre-capitalist and capitalist expansion depart in significant ways, but also the character of expansion (es-
pecially the nature of trade and colonialism) in mercantile capitalist societies differs from that in industrial capitalist
societies. To be sure, the definition of colonialism adopted by some writers - monopolistically regulated trade and in-
vestment at higher rates of profit than those obtaining in the home economy - applies with equal force to both the mer-
cantilist and industrial capitalist eras. In fact, the term 'neo-mercantilism' has frequently been used to describe I9th
century imperialism, and, as we have mentioned, mid-20th century nationalist economic policy has been labeled the
'new mercantilism'. In addition, throughout the history of capitalism, businessmen and traders have followed the same

V rule -— extract capital from areas where the cost is lowest, invest where anticipated returns are highest.

The differences between mercantilism and I9th century imperialism, however, outweigh the similarities.4 First, the
resemblance between monopolistic commercial organization in the two political-economic systems is only superficial.
Mercantilist monopoly trading companies did not spring from the prevailing modes of production. They were formed to
minimize physical and commercial risks along uncertain and distant trade routes. As 'normal' patterns of trade were
established, risk and uncertainty were reduced, and the great monopoly companies met increasing competition from

I other nationals and foreign companies. The East India Company, the last of the great monopolies, was dissolved early

in the I9th century. From then until the last quarter of the I9th century, British manufacturers and merchants adopted
free trade on principle because their control over advanced methods of production gave them a decisive competitive
advantage. But Britain's foreign investments in Europe and the United States and the diffusion of industrial technology
eliminated this advantage. And further advances in technology which were not consistent with small-scale enterprise
led to the cartelization and monopolization of industry. Latter-day monopolies, unlike their forerunners, have proven
not to be transitory.

A second important difference between mercantilism and imperialism is related to the character of trade. Early mer-
cantilism was commercial capitalism in its purest essence, middlemen exchanged goods for goods in a lively entrepot
trade, and mercantilist wars were mainly trade wars -- the Anglo-Dutch wars of the 17th century were the purest com-
mercial wars in history. It is true that as early as the first decades of the I7th century the East India Company pur-
chased raw materials in exchange for British manufactured goods. But this was not typical. It was only in the late
mercantile and early industrial capitalist periods that Britain increasingly exported manufactured commodities for agri-
cultural raw materials and minerals. As late as I800, for example, British ships took woolens and hardware to India
and returned with cotton and silk products. Then, as the I9th century wore on, a new dimension was added to trade:
capital goods financed by foreign loans and investments, as well as consumer manufacturers, exchanged for foodstuffs

and industrial raw materials.

Finally, there are superficial similarities between mercantilism and imperialism in the sphere of state economic policy.
Both systems of political economy relied on active state participation in the direction, organization, and character of
trade or investment. But the nature of state policy was fundamentally different. In England, after theprohibition on

the export of bullion was abolished in I663, the State employed commodity import and export controlswith the aim of

‘maintaining a favorable balance of trade, or export surplus, with each of Britain's trading partners, colonies and non-

colonies alike. Gradually, a system of multilateral trade replaced the more primitive bilateral trade patterns. It was
this system of multilateral trade which the imperialist states of the late I9th century inherited. Imperialist state policy ‘
revived the older technique of export promotion and import restriction (and invented new techniques, as well) with the
aim of maintaining a favorable balance of trade with the world as a whole, not with any specific trading partner.

 

  

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. 3)

These contrasts between mercantilism and imperialism give rise to important differences with respect to colonization.

In the first place, it is certainly true that the leading late"mercantilist and imperialist powers discouraged both subsis-
tence production and the manufacture of commodities in the colonies. But mercantilist industry was technologically
primitive, small-scale, and, most important, not vertically integrated. Thus the exploitation of raw materials under
mercantile impulses, and colonization itself, were of necessity national policies, and generated fierce national rival-
ries. From the Iate l9th century down to the present, however, national rivalries have increasingly given way to strug-
gles between fully-integrated corporations based in the metropolitan countries. These struggles have typically been re-
solved in compromise. The sharing out of oil resources between the great oil monopolies in the Middle Eastis an ex-
cellent example of cooperation between integrated corporations (and, by extension, imperialist nations). To make the
point slightly differently, in the mercantilist era it was impossible to conceive of an international ruling class; in the r
contemporary imperialist period, an international ruling class is an accomplished fact. *

Secondly, colonial conquest in the léth and l7th centuries had as its chief purpose the mitigation of the hazards of
trade and the preservation of monopoly control. The mercantilist powers established factories, trading bases, and forts
where regional trade was already established. ** By contrast, the seizure of territories in the late l9th century was mo-
tivated less to preserve commercial positions which had already been won by peaceful methods than to open up possi-
bilities for trade and investment where none had existed before. Colonialism under mercantilism was therefore defen-
sive in nature and required a passive state presence, while latter-day imperialism in comparison exhibited an aggressive
character which stood in need of active state participation.

Mercantil ism and imperialism departed in still another important respect. The doctrine used to support rigid trade re-
strictions, and an important element of the theory which the mercantile colonial system was based on was that the maxi-
mum inflow of bullion required a favorable balance of trade with each colony. This doctrine limited the scope of terri-
torial conquest and seizure, as well as the development of commercial relations with other colonial powers. In the late
mercantile era,‘ however, the state gradually realized that an expansion of output was the key to maximum trade and
therefore the nursing of home industry and creation of employment became central goals of state policy. Thus were cre-
ated the pre-conditions for the growth of complex, multilateral trade patterns, which in turn awakened the interests

of the imperial powers in any and all under-exploited regions.

In sum, industrial‘ capitalist expansionism distinguished itself in the following important respects: it exhibited a more
aggressive attitude toward the underexploited lands; it was less particular, and more universal, in character; it more
fully integrated underexploited economic regions into the structure of the metropolitan country; it required the active

.participation of the state; and, finally, internecine warfare between the economic monopolies tended to be less actue.

Imperialism thus contained the important contradiction which has afflicted the advanced capitalist countries down to
the present day. On the one hand, the national power elites seek to advance the economic interests of their respec-
tive countries; on the other hand, the integrated, multi-national corporations, or the international ruling class, extend
their sway irrespective of the interests of the countries in which they are based. This contradiction is heightened by
the aggressive, universal character of modern imperialist expansion.

(In our comparison of mercantilism and imperialism we have neither surveyed the differences between the early, middle,
and late mercantilism era, nor reviewed satisfactorily the relation of the free trade period to either mercantilism or im-
perialism. One school of thought sees a great deal of continuity between mercantilism and early industrial capitalism.
M. Barratt-Brown, for example, argues that the decades after l8l5 saw the expansion and consolidation of -the British
Empire based on the need to conquer and secure markets and keep trade routes open in the face of rivalries from develop-

_ ing European and United States capitalism and the first outbreaks of nationalism and anti- imperialism in the colonies.

D. Fieldhouse, on the other hand, asserts that Britain's industrial supremacy after l8l5 meant that the colonies and
monopolisticprivileges involved few benefits and. large costs. He claims that the acquisition and defense of colonies
were motivated chiefly for reasons of military security and administrative efficiency.)

* This is not meant to imply that there are no important conflicts between international-minded capitalists and national-
minded power elites.

** This of course does not exhaust the motives for colonial conquest. In the conquest of Mexico and Peru, ‘the search
for precious metals was of foremost importance. The east coast of Africa was at first seized for strategic reasons. But
the characteristic sequence was followed in India and West Africa. In the latter region, Portugal had acquired a mo-
nopoly over trade based on coastal fortifications. Cloth, metal, andglass were exchanged on favorable terms for gold,
ivory, and, above all, slaves. In the middle of the l7th century Portugal's monopoly was broken by the Dutch, and
then by the British and French. ‘ I

IMPERIALISM: AN ASPECT OF MONOPOLY CAPITALISM

Against the ‘view that dissociates capitalism and imperialism, Marxist economists have put forward many variations on
fundamentally the same argument. The second doctrine of imperialism, also inspired by European expansionism in the
late l9th and early 20th centuries, holds that monopoly capitalism, imperialism, andcolonialism are basically the same
phenomena. Perhaps it is more accurate to call this view 'neo-Marxist‘ because those who hold it have inherited fei/v A
clear theoretical guidelines from Marx himself. In the three volumes of Ca ital, apart from the brief concluding chap-
ter in Volume I, there are only two or three references to the economics of colonialism, the gist of which is that com-
modities produced under conditions of high labor productivity and sold in countries where labor productivity is low will
command an abnormally high rate of profit.7 Marx's relative silence on the economics of imperialism may have handi-
capped the development of Marxist theory, or it may have been a blessing in disguise. The absence of any theoretical
precedent has forced (and continues to force) Marxists back on their own experiences and intellectual resources. Thus
older interpretations of imperialism as far apart as those of Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, and modern theories as disparate
as those of Paul Baron and Joseph Gillman have arisen from basically the same critical tradition.

Nothing succeeds like success, however, and Lenin's ideas have dominated the field. Yet Lenin owed much to John A.
Hobson's lm erialism, published in 1902, a book which is frequently (and legitimately) read as the precursor of Lenin's
study. Thus we will begin by sketching out the main ideas of Hobson and Lenin, later subiecting them to analysis on
the basis of theoretical and historical studies published in recent years.

Hobson and Lenin wrote about imperialism during the heyday of colonialism (T885-l9l4), which naturally enough ap-
peared to be the most significant economic-political phenomenon of the time. By making colonialism their focal point,
however, bot'h—7nen equated imperialism and colonialism and thus failed to understand the significance of the ‘imperial-
ism of free trade‘ — an expression coined to describe British economic expansion from the l840s to the 18805. Moreover,
they barely acknowledged United States expansion and could not anticipate future modes of imperialist controls which
have proved to be even more effective than formal colonial rule. I

The distinctive feature of Hobson's theory is his conception of colonialism as the reflection of the unfulfilled promise

of liberal democracy. As Hobson saw it, inequalities in the distribution of wealth and income in Britain dampened

the consumptionpower of the British working classes, which in turn made it unprofitable for capitalists to utilize fully
their industrial capacity. Unable to find profitable investment outlets at home, British capitalists subsequently sought
them abroad in the economically underexploited continents. Britain therefore acquired colonies as a dumping ground
for surplus capital. The end of imperialist conquest and de-colonization would come about only when the British work-
ing classes acquired more economic and political power through trade unionism and parliamentary representation, which
would set the stage for a thoroughgoing redistribution of income and hence the development of a home economy in which
the volume of consumption corresponded more closely to the volume of production.

Hobson supported his thesis not only by his faith in the promise of liberal democracy, but. also by reference to changes

in Britain's trade and investments. He tried to show that the expansion of empire during the last two decades of the

l9th century,when most of the world not already independent or under European rule was carved up among the European
powers, resulted in a decline in British trade with her colonies in relation to trade with non-colonies. He also under-

lined the obvious fact that the new colonies in Africa and Asia failed to attract British settlers in significant numbers. "
Through a process of elimination Hobson thus hit on what he considered to be the crucial element in British imperialism
-- foreign investments. He linked the vast outflow of capital from,Britain during this period — British overseas invest-
ments rose from 785 million pounds in 1871 to 3500 million pounds in WM and annual net foreign investments were
frequently greater than gross domestic fixed investments - with the frantic struggle by the European powers for colonies,

and inferred that the former caused the latter. The political struggles between the major European powers were thus

dissolved into struggles for profitable investment outlets, and the explorers, missionaries, traders, and soldiers of the
period were seen as the puppets of London's financial magnates.

Lenin's views

Lenin agreed with Hobson that the prime‘ cause of capital exports was the ‘vast increase in the supply of capital in the
metropolitan countries, especially Britain, and played down the role of the demand for capital in the underdeveloped
regions. He also, like Hobson, causally linked foreign investments with the acquisition of colonies. The distinctive
element in Lenin's theory related to the cause of the surplus of capital.

 

 

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. 5)

Lenin understood that imperialism is a stage of capitalist development, and not merely one possible set of foreign policy
options among many. In particular, imperialism is the monopoly capitalist stage, and exhibits five basic features:

1. The concentration of production and capital, developed so highly that it creates monopolies which

play a decisive role in economic life. 2. The fusion of banking capital with industrial capital and the
creation, on the basis of this financial capital, of a financial oligarchy. 3. The export of capital, which
has become extremely important, as distinguished from the export of commodities. 4. The formation of the
international capitalist monopolies which share out the world among themselves. 5. The territorial division
of the whole earth completed by the great capitalist powers.9

The key element is the formation of local and international monopolies behind high tariff barriers in the metropolitan
countries. Monopolistic organization develops ‘precisely out of free competition‘ in essentially four ways. First, the
concentration (growth in absolute size) of capital leads to the centralization (growth in relative size) of capital. Se-
cond, monopoly capital extends and strengthens itself by the seizure of key raw materials. Third, financial capital,

or the investment banks, ‘impose an infinite number of financial ties of dependence upon all the economic and political
institutions of contemporary capitalist society‘, including non-financial capital. Fourth, ‘monopoly has grown out of
colonial policy. To the numerous "old" motives of colonial policy the capitalist financier has added the struggle for
the sources of raw materials, for the exportation of capital, for "spheres of influence , i.e. , for spheres of good busi-
ness, concessions, monopolist profits, and so on; in fine, for economic territory in general.‘ In short, the new coloni-
alism opposes itself to the older colonial policy of the ‘free grabbing‘ of territories.

The cause of the surplus of capital and capital exportation, and monopolistic industry is the tendency of the rate of
profit to fall . Two underlying forces drive down the rate of profit in the metropolitan country: first, the rise of
trade unions and social democracy, together with the exhaustion of opportunities to recruit labor from the countryside
at the going real wage, rule out possibilities for increasing significantly the rate of exploitation; second, labor saving
innovations increase the organic composition of capital. Monopoly is thus in part formed in order to protect profit
margins. At the same time, economies of large-scale production (internal expansion) and mergers during periods of
economic crises (external expansion) strengthen pre—existing tendencies toward monopolistic organization.

Meanwhile, in the economically underexploited regions of the world, capital yields a substantially higher rate of re-
turn. For one thing, the composition of capital is lower; for another, labor "is plentiful in supply and cheap; and, fi-
nally, colonial rule establishes the pre-conditions for monopolistic privileges. Rich in minerals and raw materials re-
quired by the development of metals, automotive, andother heavy industries in the metropolitan powers, the .under-
exploited regions naturally attract large amounts of capital. Consequently, foreign investment counteracts the tendency
for the rate of profit to fall in the metropolitan economy. On the one hand, high profit margins in the colonies pull up
the average return on capital; on the other hand, the retardation of capital accumulation in the home economy recreates
the reserve army of the unemployed, raises the rate of exploitation, and, finally, increases the rate of profit.

Pushing this thesis one step forward, the precondition for a truly 'favorable‘ investment climate is indirect or direct con-
trol of internal politics in the backward regions. Economic penetration therefore leads to the establishment of spheres

of influence, protectorates, and annexation. Strachey suggests that the backward regions assumed a dependency status
(the last step before outright control) in relation to the metropolitan powers chiefly because the former were in debt to
the latter. What was significant about the shift from consumer goods to capital goods in world trade was that the~colony-A
to-be needed long-term credits or loans to pay for the capital goods, and that, finally, the relationship between the
backward country and the metropolitan country became one of debtor and creditor. And from this it was butitasmall ‘

step to dependence and domination. ’

Whatever the exact sequence of events which led to colonialism, Lenin's economic definition of colonialism (and im-
perialism) is monopolistically regulated trade and/or investment abroad at higher rates of profit than those obtaining in
the metropolitan country. ‘As soon as political control arrives as handmaid to investment,‘ Dobb writes, ‘the opportunity
for monopolistic and preferential practices exists.‘ The essential ingredient of colonialism therefore is ‘privileged in-
vestment: namely, investment in proiects which carry with them some differential advantage, preference, or actual

monopoly, in the form of concession-rights or some grant of privileged status. "

 

Criticisms of Hobson and Lenin W

 

The criticisms of Hobson ancl Lenin's theories, and the alternative views which have been 

a new theory so much as a catalogue of historical facts which are not fully consistent with the older These

criticisms bear on three key aspects of Lenin's theory, two of which also figured importantly in Hobson's thought.

One line of criticism is that Lenin ignored the theme of continuity in European expansionism and was too eager to in-
terpret the partition of Africa and the Pacific as a qualitatively different phenomenon. Alexander Kemp has shown
that throughout the entire I9th century British net capital exports in relation to national income amounted to iust over
one per cent during recession periods and about six to seven per cent during boom years. 2 Pointing to a similar con-
clusion is Richard Koebner's iudgment that British ‘imperial responsibilities were enlarged step by step by a hesitant
government. "3 Gallagher and Robinson also reiect the idea that there were important qualitative differences between
British expansionism in the first and second parts of the 19th century. In both periods the formula was ‘trade with in-
formal control if possible; trade with the rule if necessary‘. In Egypt and South Africa, for example, they maintain
that Britain was only responding to internal upheaval and that traditional controls could no longer be relied upon.

Lenin was aware of the continuity in European expansionism but maintained that the development of monopoly capital-
ism led to a break in this continuity. In principle Lenin had solid earth under his feet because the generation of busi-
ness savings and their absorption by new investments are governed by different laws in a competitive capitalist society

than under monopoly capitalism. But in practice it is by no means certain that Lenin was right when he asserted that
‘at the beginning of the 20th century, monopolies have acquired complete supremacy in the advanced countries.’

In the most powerful imperialist country, Great Britain, there were few trusts or cartels of any consequence in I900. '6
One highly qualified economic historian maintains that the British economy failed to enter the monopoly stage until the
early 1930s. 7 Lenin was aware that British capitalism was far from a model of monopoly domination, but slurred over
the problem by referring to a 'monopoly' of a few dozen companies and by interpreting Chamberlain's Imperial Prefer-
ence System as Britain's reply to the European cartels. The German economy was not thoroughly trustified until after
I900, even though bank control of industry was established at a much earlier date. As for the United States economy,
recent research has thrown doubt on the received idea that the great merger movement around the turn of the century
resulted in the cartelization and trustification of heavy industry, and has substituted the thesis that the economy was
more competitive in the first decade of the 20th century than in the last decade of the I9th. '8

The same line of criticism developed from a different perspective also casts doubt on Lenin's maior thesis. The truth is
that British capital exports to Africa were mobilized by small-scale speculators, not mainly by the big London banking
houses. For the former, although not the latter, foreign lending was a precarious undertaking. One of the first of the
African companies, The Royal Niger Company, ‘had to. . . enlist subscribers in order to make certain that the Company
would be equal to its administrative undertaking. 'l9 Similarly, subscribers to the Imperial British East Africa Company
and Cecil Rhodes’ South African Company were mainly small-scale savers, such as pensioners and retired military offi-
cers. If monopoly capitalism is essentially a post- Lenin phenomenon, it is readily understandable why the African com-
panies were financed by small capital. The interesting point in this connection is that capital exports to the underde-
veloped regions today conform closely to the Leninist vision. It is not the small investor attracted to an empire builder
like Rhodes who‘provides the savings for foreign investment, but the giant multinational corporations such as Standard
Oil, General Motors, and General Electric.

The second line of criticism challenges directly the thesis of Hobson and Lenin that the vast amounts of capital from

Britain flowed into the new colonies. As Cairncross has shown in his definitive study, the great mass of British foreign
investments penetrated India and what Ragnar Nurkse has termed the regions of recent settlement -- the United States,
Canada, Australia, Argentina, and South Africa.20 These areas contained primary commodities, chiefly agricultural
goods, which Britain required and which in turn needed a steady flow of foreign capital, mainly to finance railroad
construction, to exploit. This analysis lays great stress on the increase in the demand for capital (and is sometimes
called the capital-pull thesis) and plays down the significance of the capital surplus which Hobson and Lenin saw pil-
ing up in the metropolitan countries.

Maurice Dobb has countered this reasoning with the observation that Britain's need for foodstuffs and raw materials was
specific to Britain and in no sense characteristic of the other imperial powers. Thus while the demand for British capi-
tal mayhave increased more rapidly than the supply, the same conclusions cannot be applied to France or Germany.
What is more, repatriated interest and dividend payments on investments 'pulled' from Britain in the early years of the
colonial epoch may have been during later decades 'pushed' out into both the old and new colonies. Fieldhouse has
pointed out that there were no important differentials between home and foreign interest rates during the pre-World
War I colonial era, concluding that capital could hardly have been attracted by colonial super-profits.2 Taken at

 

é Britain to occupy that country in I882 in order to protect Suez and the routes to the east.

face value, this conclusion supports the Nurkse-Cairncross ‘capital pull‘ thesis. But the conclusion is fallacious be-
cause it was precisely the vast outflow of capital which depressed interest rates abroad and kept them firm at home.

The new colonies did fail to attract many investments during the period directly before and after their conquest.
Egypt's indebtedness to Britain was a factor, to be sure, but it was the collapse of the Egyftian government which led .

2 As for the rest of Africa,
British enterprise in the l9th century was restricted mainly to the palm oil trade on the West Coast, and moderate in-
vestment activity in the Transvaal and Rhodesia. As Robinson and Gallagher have shown, Africa provided little trade,
less revenue, and few local collaborators, and Britain supplied little capital and few settlers. Certainly, until the 20th
century, British ruling class opinion held widely that there was no real economic reason for the partition of Africa.23
In the Pacific, large-scale investments in Malayan tin and rubber were made considerably after the annexation of that
country, and other late I9th century conquests in Asia and the Pacific failed to attract new investments in any signifi-
cant quantity. This of course does not prove that these acquisitions were not economically motivated, but only that
investors may have had overoptimistic expectations.

Lenin's description of the chief characteristics of the new colonial era - foreign investments, seizure of territories, mo-
nopolistic preferences - was therefore largely accurate. A single, or simple, theoretical pattern, however, cannot be
imposed on the complex sequence of events which revolutionized the world capitalist system between the I880s and
World War I. More often than not, in Robinson and Gallagher's words, the ‘extension of territorial claims. . . required
commercial expansion.’ Certainly the attitudes expressed by the German Colonial Congress in I902 suggests that in
point of time investment and trade followed the flag, rather than vice versa: ‘The Congress thinks that, in the interests
of the fatherland, it is necessary to render it independent of the foreigner for the importation of raw materials and to
create markets as safe as possible for manufactured German goods. The German colonies of the future must play this
double role, even if the natives are forced to labor on public works and agricultural pursuits.‘ Similar sentiments were
expressed in one form or another by Joseph Chamberlain, Theodore Roosevelt, and a host of lesser leaders and ideolo-
gists of imperialism.

We have finally to discuss a criticism of Lenin's thesis which arises from the experiences of Britain in the period directly
after World War II. Although domestic investment has been considerably in excess of foreign investment (thus reversing
the pre-I9I4 ratio of home to foreign investment),24 capital exports did not come to a complete halt with the political
independence of Britain's colonies. It has been inferred from this that formal colonial rule was really not necessary to
provide profitable investment outlets. In defense of Lenin, the argument has been raised that British economic stagna-
tion in the immediate post-war era can be attributed to the decline in repatriated earnings from foreign investments, and
therefore a decrease in the rate of profit, in turn due to the removal of British economic interests from their monopoly
over trade, banking, agriculture, and other branches of politically independent ex-coIonies.25 The empirical work
published by Michael Barratt-Brown tends to confirm this line of reasoning: Brown estimates that after deducting pay-
ments to foreign owners of property, net earnings from overseas investments in the post-war period amounted to only

one per cent of Britain's national income.

These estimates, and the conclusion implicit in them, have been questioned by Hamza Alavi, who argues that informal
economic control exercised by the advanced capitalist countries can be as effective, and as profitable, as formal po-
litical rule.27 In our subsequent interpretation of contemporary imperialism we lay great stress, and develop in detail,
this idea. Alavi challenges the estimates on three grounds. First, he maintains that the gross return, not net return,
on capital invested abroad is the relevant figure on the grounds that Britain incurred her liabilities independently. Se-
cond, he rightly stresses that profit remittances represent but a portion of the return flow on foreign investments. Al-
though it proved impossible to arrive at any accurate estimates, income remitted in the form of monopolistic prices,
'services' such as commission royalties, and head office charges, should be included in the return flow. Lastly, Alavi
states that income remissions in relation to the domestic economic surplus (and not relative to national income) is the
relevant comparison for measuring the impact of foreign investments on the metropolitan economy. Alavi calculates
that gross income from overseas investments in the postwar period (excluding the disguised income remissions listed
above) amounted to 3.3 -4 percent of the national income and 40-55 per cent of domestic net investment. Clearly,

if Britain financed perhaps one-half of her home investments from overseas profits, foreign asset holdings must have
been a decisive element in the maintenance of the rate of profit at home.

NEO-IMPERIALISM: CONTROL WITHOUT COLONIALISM

A brief sketch cannot even begin to resolve the many theoretical and historical questions which run through the two

 

 
 

(The Meaning of Economic Imperialism, p. 8)

major contending doctrines of l9th century imperialism. It is clear, however, that two features of imperialism are not
in dispute. The first concerns the general description of economic organization and economic policy. As we have seen,
Dobb considers the essential ingredient of imperialism to be ‘privileged investment. . . investment in proiects which carry
with them some differential advantage‘. This feature must be placed in a wider frame of reference, as in Paul Sweezy's
description of imperialism as ‘severe rivalry (between advanced capitalist countries) in the world market leading alter-
natively to cutthroat competition and international monopoly combines‘ .28 Schumpeter's view of imperialism is very
similar. Cutthroat competition and international monopoly combines are seen as ‘protective tariffs, cartels, monopoly
prices, forced exports (dumping), an aggressive economic policy, and aggressive foreign policy generally. . .' A se-
cond general area of agreement (generally implicit in the writings of both Marxists and non-Marxists) is that modern
imperialism, whatever its causes, depends on colonial rule as the main form of economic and political control of the

«economically backward regions and that political independence would significantly reduce, or eliminate entirely, ex-
._ploitive imperialist relations. A i

Opposed to these doctrines is what may be called the neo-Leninist, or modern Marxist theory of imperialism. The in-
creasing economic domination exercised by the United States in the world capitalist economy and the failure of the ex-
colonies to embark on sustained economic and social development have caused older Marxist economists to re-work
original doctrines and have given rise to a new theory. of neo-colonialism. Many of its outlines are still indistinct, but
there is broad agreement that a sharp distinction should be made between colonialism and imperialism, while the original
Leninist identity between monopoly capitalism and imperialism should be retained. In this view, which we adopt through-
out this study, monopoly capitalism remains an aggressively expansionist political-economic system, but colonialism is
seen as merely one f_<3_r_rr_i of imperialist domination, and frequently an ineffective one at that.

The phrase ‘neo-colonialism’ was first used in the early l950s. Anti-colonial leaders in Asia and Africa focus on the
element of control -- in the words of Sukarno, ‘economic control, intellectual control, and actual physical control by
a small but alien community, within a nation‘ .30 To cite a specific illustration of economic neo-colonialism, Nkru-
mah denounced as ‘neo-colonialism’ the economic association of France's African colonies with the European Common
Market. An example in which the political element was in the fore was France's claim to the right to suppress the re-
volt against the puppet ruler of Gabon in February I964 in order to defend French economic interests in that country.
A comprehensive summary of the chief manifestations of neo-colonialism was made at the Third All-African People's
Conference held in Cairo in 1961. ’

This Conference considers that Neo-Colonialism, which is the survival of the colonial system in spite of
formal recognition of political independence in emerging countries, which become the victims of an indirect
and subtle form of domination by political, economic, social, military or technical (forces), is the greatest
threat to African countries that have newly won their independence or those approaching this status. . .

This Conference denounces the following manifestations'of Neo-Colonialism in Africa:

(a) Puppet governments represented by stooges, and based on some chiefs, reactionary elements, anti-popu-
lar politicians, big bourgeois compradors or corrupted civil or military functionaries.

(b) Regrouping of states, before or after independence, by an imperial power in federation or communities
linked to that imperial power.

(c) Balkanization as a deliberate political fragmentation of states by creation of artificial entities, such as,
for example, the case of Katanga, Mauritania, Buganda, etc. i

(cl) The economic entrenchment of the colonial power before independence and the continuity of economic
dependence after formal recognition of national sovereignty.

(e) Integration into colonial economic blocs which maintain the under-developed character of African
economy.

(f) Economic infiltration by a foreign power after independence, through capital investments, loans and
monetary aids or technical experts, of unequal Eoncessions, particularly those extending for long periods.

(g) Direct monetary dependence, as in those emergent independent states whose finances remain in the
hands of and directly controlled by colonial powers.
