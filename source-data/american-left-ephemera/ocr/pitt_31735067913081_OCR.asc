Goes to Local 711  

FAIRVIEW, Pa.—-Richard S. Miller, a union stew-

’ are for Local 711, was reinstated on his job at the

Parker White Metal Company with all his rights and
seniority and received $967.02 in back pay as the result
of an arbitration decision handed down on Dec. 22 by
David R.» Kochery, a professor at the University of Buf-

falo Law School.

The arbitrator ruled that the company had totally »

failed to prove its charge that Miller had “attempted to
incite a work stoppage”—its stated reasonfor discharg-

liing himon Nov. 2, 1964—and said that “. . . the burden
of proof in disciplinary cases is on the _employer . . .

7!

The back pay awarded covered the period from

day that Miller’s wife, who had
been in the hospital, was re-
leased.

Not only did the Miller fam- -

ily spend a happier Christmas
than anticipated, but the arbi-
tration award added to the holi-
day pleasure of the union offi-

. cers and membership.

Miller, a furnace operator in

.the powdered metal depart-

ment, had refused to work over-
time on Sat., Oct. 31 because
he had planned to go hunting on

_that day—the opening day of

the season. Although the com-
pany, at a hearing in Erie on

-'_D,ec’;’~‘ 4, claimed that Miller had
not done his part in working

overtime over an extended pe-

riod, it conceded that this was
‘not an issue in the arbitration.

A Company. Charge Refu'l'_el:l

The charge that he had urged
two other workers not to work

overtime wasrefuted by sworn
statements from the two men

which were introduced as part

Iof the union’s testimony.

The union contended that an

-.“attempt” to incite a work stop-
-page does not violate the “no

strike” clause of the contract,
that no work stoppage took

.place, and finally that Miller

had made‘ no attempt to cause
such a stoppage.

“Surely,” said Kochery in his
award, “it can be expected that
management will conduct more
investigation, preferably hold a
hearing, and confront the em-
ployee, before utilizing the ex-
treme disciplinary penalty of
discharge. . . .”

Mine-Mill Internatio-nal Rep-

resentative Joseph Scioli pre-

sented the case for the union.
Miller and Local 711 President
William Smith testified at the

-Nov. 2 to Dec. 23, the day on which Miller returned to
_ .,_- work, only hours after the arbitration decision was re-
.  ceived. It was based on his average weekly earnings in

-the month prior to his being fired. Dec. 23 wasalso the

hearing, which was also attend-
ed by Jerry Firch, plant-chief
steward. Smith said he had
asked Miller to call the other
workers in his department on

"Oct. 31 to explain to them that

he-(Miller) might be given a
warning slip for his refusal to
work overtime and that they too
might get such slips if they did
not show up to work.

John E. Britton and Robert
Parker, vice-president of Park-
er White, represented the com-
pany at the hearing-. Thomas
Welsh, the personnel manager
who had fired Miller, and Wil-
bur Hahn, the department su-
pervisor, testified—the latter
saying that the two phone calls
Miller made were an attempt
to cause a work stoppage.

Trial LExaminer Asks Back .

Pay for 2 1 Iron King Workers

HUMBOLDT, _Ariz.—Louis S. Penfield, ‘a trial examiner for the National Labor
Relations Board, has recommended full reinstatement with back pay plus six percent

interest for 21 workers at Shattuck-Denn’s Iron King Mine. Reinstatement of the em- _

ployees would include seniority and all other rights.

Although the company has filed exceptions which will force the 28th regional
board to" go over the facts in the case, Penfield concluded that Shattuck-Denn had
engaged in “unfair labor practices” in an attempt to weaken the union, Mine-Mill
Local 942, which only last March became bargaining agent for the 225 workers at

the underground mine.

If the NLRB upholds the trial examiner's recommendations, the men will receive
back pay dating back to May 14, 1964. A few of them had returned to work late in
September, as part of the contract agreement that was overwhelmingly ratified that

month. Others also have been
working ‘under terms‘ of a tem-
but have
been considered new hires with-

-out seniority.

One man, Nick Olvera, whose
discharge touched off a strike
against the company, should re-
ceive pay dating back to April

29, Penfield said. The Vice-

president of the local union,
Olvera was fired after filing a
grievance whichcharged a fore-

ing language. ‘

New Property for Union
. Mine-Mill, won bargaining
rights at the property on March
25, defeating the United Steel-
workers of America who had
represented the Iron Kinglwork-
ers for six years. Complaints
against the Steelworkers had in-
cluded violations of seniority,
inability to -process grievances,
and failure to eliminate the nu-
merous safety hazards at the
mine.

When Mine-Mill took_ over,
grievances began to‘ be filed and
processed. “It is clear,” said
Penfield in his report, “that the
newly certified union undertook
to pursue its recently acquired
bargaining rights with vigor.”
“. . .. the discharge of one of the
more forcible union adherents
would serve as a warning to the
union to take it easy,” said Pen-
field, in suggesting a possible
company motivation to fire
0lvera—a firing, he says, that
was “discriminatory.” V

When the company refused to
allow a union grievance over
the discharge to go to arbitra-
tion, the workers struck on May
5. Most returned to wo-rk on
May 14, after unfair labor
charges were filed against
Shattuck-Denn, but the company
refused to allow 19 employees
to return, saying that they had
been permanently replaced
Another man, Lupe Jaime, was
fired for alleged “unlawful con-
duct” during the strike—also a
discharge — that Penfield found
to be unjustified.

Workers Listed

In addition. to Olv era and
Jaime, Penfield recommended
that the following workers be
reinstated with back pay: E. G.

Contract Settlement

In the three-year contract
settlement signed in September
——the first under Mine-Mill——the
sliding wage scale which de-
pended on the price of metals

was eliminated, and the maxi- ;
mum premium of eight cents

per hour was permanently in-
corporated into the contract.
Wage rates were also increased
an additional 16 cents through
the agreement, and job reclassi-
fications worth 3% cents an

hour were granted. The pact"

provided health and welfare
gains, an additional holiday‘,
and increased shift differentials.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

February. 1950

ary.

Topping the list of items that the union hopes Congress will
pass this session is federal mine safety legislation. The Johnson
administration will have a poposal in this area and the Mine—Mill-
backed Metcalf—Montoya bill, introduced in the last session, will
again be put in the hopper. A measure calling for early retire-
ment for miners and others in hazardous occupations will again be
introduced this year, and will have the full backing of the union.

The board at a November meeting resolved support for sev-
including the administration’s medicare

bill, repeal of Section 14b of the Taft-Hartley Act, an increase in
.the minimum wage, reduction in

eral other measures,

the work week, and many other
legislative proposals.

One specific item on the Mine-
Mill agenda, in so_mewhat modi-
fied. form, already received fa-

‘vorable action in the House of

RepresentatiVes——a rule change
which prevents the Rules Com-
mittee from bottling up legisla-
tion for more than 21 days. The
union said that such legislation

-should include any that was

favorably reported by another
standing committee. The rule
change allows the Speaker of

I the House to bring out Whatever

proposals he wishes to for a vote
on the floor after the 21 days
have elapsed.

The Jan. 29 to 31 board meet-
ing is expected to deal more
with the union’s strategy for
for

as supporting.

State legislative proposals and
various organizational questions
will be discussed at the district
conferences, most of which were

"postponed from 1964 because
‘key personnel were involved in

either negotiations or the "politi-
cal campaign. When, in 1963,
union members voted by refer-
endum to hold an international
convention only every two
years, it was decided that dis-
trict conferences should be

‘scheduled for the even years.

District 4, however, was_ the
only one to hold a conference in
1964, On Oct. 10 and 11, 73 dele-
gates representing 11 locals in
seven states attended the meet-
ing in Chicago, Ill.

The international officers and
board members are urging that
locals make plans immediately
in order that they be well rep-

-- resented at the February meet-

The Mine-Mill international executive board will hold a three-

THE MINE-MILL UNION

 

Driver's Death Prompts State of the Union Message

Blast by Bureau of Mines

RUTH, Nev.——Merritt T. Paice, a member of Mine-
Mill Local 124, was killed on the morning of Dec. 28 at
the Kennecott open pit mine when the 65-ton haulpak

‘truck he was driving went over the edge of an unlit
- waste dump. There were no witnesses to the accident,

which occurred at about 4:30 a.m.
The Nevada State Inspector of Mines and the U. S.

’ Bureau of Mines investigated the accident, with the latter

issuing a hard-hitting report which pinpointed the cause
as “inadequate means of preventing trucks traveling
beyond a _safe place for dumping.”

Paice was alive in front of his truck when he was
discovered by D. McKenzie, but died en route to the

hospital of multiple head and
internal in j u r i e s. McKenzie,
whose truck was following

1 Paice’s- in rotation, investigated

when he did not meet the other
truck. He found it at the bot-
tom of the 175-foot slope with
its back-up lights on.
Leaves Six Children
Paice, 38, is survived by his

.widow and six children. Mine-

Mill President A. C. Skinner
sent a telegram to Mrs. Paice
expressing the shock of the
officers at the tragic news and
conveying their heartfelt sym-
pathy.

The U. S. Bureau of Mines’
report put the average height

of the berm at the dump at two-

feet, although other sources
have reported it to be no higher
than 18 inches at some places.
Authorities state that a berm
of only 18 inches, especially if
composed of fine or soft mate-
rial, can easily go unnoticed by
drivers when wheels of a vehi-
cle as heavy as 65-tons capacity
pass over it.

Three Recommendations

The report made three signi-
ficant recommendations‘ aimed
at preventing similar accidents
in the future. They were:

0 “The height and width of
berms should be increased to
the maximum over which trucks

6 can dump.”

10 “Consideration should be
given to the installationof pneu-
matic, electrical, or other type
devices that will automatically
give alarm—either visual, audi-
ble, or both-—-when trucks ap-
proaching dumping points are
within a safe stopping distance
of the berm.” -

0 “Consideration should be
given also to providing adequate
illumination at dumping points.”

The report on the accident by
the Nevada State Inspector of
Mines did not pinpoint the cause
of the accident, nor did it con-
tain any recommendations
aimed at avoiding similar acci-
dents.

Previous Accidents

Paice’s death is the second in
little more than two years re-
sulting from equipment going
over the bank at Kennecott’s
Nevada property. On November
3, 1962, Isidro Sandoval was
killed when his front end loader
climbed a 20-inch berm and
went over. While the accident
was’ believed to have been
caused by malfunctioning of the
steering and brake mechanisms,
the low height of the berm was
regarded at the time as a con-
tributing factor.

On that occasion the Nevada

State Mine Inspector did recom- A

mend that the berms in the area
of the accident be built higher.

In the last few years, a num-
ber of other trucks have gone

Emphasizes Domestic Plans

WASHINGTON, D. C.——In his State of the Union Message on the evening of Jan.
4, President Lyndon Johnson indicated that the major concentration of his adminis-
tration may well be on domestic affairs. While he did invite the new leaders of the

Soviet Union to Visit this country,

foreign affairs.

he spoke, for the most part, in generalities about

He outlined, on the other hand, many specific legislative proposals that he will
push to build a “Great Society” within the United States.

Although not specifically calling for the repeal of Section 14b of the Taft-Hartley
Act, which allows states to have “right-to-work” laws, the President said he would

propose changes in the Act and
specifically that section of it.
The Democratic party platform
pledges repeal. This proposal

' brought one of the loudest bursts

of applause during the Presi-
dent’s message.

In the area of education,
President Johnson said he would
recommend agnew program for
schools and students which
would require a first-year au-
thorization of one billion, 500
million dollars. Much of his pro-
gram, be indicated, would be
geared to serve those most in
need.

Right to Vote
He spoke of the necessity of
opening opportunity to, all Amer-
icans, and twice during the
speech referred to the ’ “barri-
ers to the right to vote,” pledg-

Other items on the Johnson
legislative agenda include:

0 Medical care for the aged;

0 Extension of the $1.25 mini-
mum wage to over 2 million
unprotected workers;

0 A step-up in the “War on
Poverty;’’

0 Changes in immigration pol-
icy to eliminate the national
origin quota system;

0 Establishment of a new De-
partment of Housing and Ur-

0 Air and water pollution legis-
lation;

O A national foundation of the
arts.

Although the battle to curtail
the filibuster rule in the Senate
hasbeen delayed for probably

‘another month, some changes

were made in the rules of the
House of Representatives. The
changes, two of which substan-
tially weaken the power of the
Rules Committee to bottle up
legislation, are expected to help
the President win approval of
his legislative program.

One change allows the Speak-
er of the House to bring out for
a ﬂoor vote any legislative pro-
posal which has been in Rules
for more than 21 days. Another
would permit a bill to be sent
to, conference committee by a
majority vote.

Seniority Stripped

In other significant House ac-
tion during the opening’ days of
the session, Reps. John Bell
Williams (D-Miss.) and Albert
W. Watson (D-S.C.) were
stripped of their seniority by the
Democratic caucus. The two
Congressmen had openly sup-
ported Sen. Goldwater for the
presidency.

On Jan. 4, 149 members of the
House voted against the seating

of Mississippi’s five Congress-
men on the grounds that their
election was illegal because Ne-
groes in the state had been ex-
cluded from voting. Although
the Mississippi representatives
were seated by a 276 to 149
vote, William Fitts Ryan (I)-
N.Y.), who led the fight against
seating, said that the size of the
“No” vote marked “the begin-
ning of the end of disenfran-
chisement.” ‘

The formal inauguration for. -

President Johnson and Vice-
President Hubert H. Humphrey
was held on Jan. 20. Mine-Mill
International Vice-President As-
bury Howard attended the for-
mal ceremonies, a reception,
and the inaugural ball as a rep-
resentative of the union.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

February. 1965  

 Restfctionson Gamishments

A DENVER, C0lo.——A package of proposals which would set limits on the gar-

nishment of an employee’s wages and insure that the worker was informed of those
limits has been introduced in the legislature here by Gerald Kopel (D-Denver).

One of the five bills was passed by the House, 43 to 20, late in January, and

now heads for the Senate, where it is expected to have more trouble. It provides

that no wages, fees, or commissions earned by a worker can be garnished until after

a court hearing and judgment.

Unike many states which forbid garnishment at any time or at least require

that notice‘ be given the employee several days before garnishment proceedings

begin, Colorado law presently
allows garnishment of wages
simply on the basis of an affi-
davit filed by the creditor. An
employee can later request a
court hearing. '

The Kopel bill also would in-
crease the minimum sum which
can be involved in garnishment
proceedings ‘from the present
$20 to $100.

His other bills, which also
have bipartisan co-sponsorship,
are presently being studied by
the Business Affairs Committee
of the Colorado House, chaired
by another Denver Democrat,
Joseph Calabrese.

V Additional Proposals

They would, if approved, pro-
hibit an employer from firing,
demoting, or refusing to pro-
mote a worker because his
wages are being garnished‘; pro-
hibit the use of a telephone to
threaten garnishment or at-
_tachment of any third person’s
wages; require collection agen-
cies to include in any form let-
ter sent to debtors an adequate
statement of the exemptions,
relief, and remedies available
under the laws of the state;
and exempt certain percentages
of‘ a worker’s paycheck from
‘garnishment or attachment.

Under the terms of the latter
proposal, any head of a family
would have exempted from gar-
nishment his first $40 of earn-

ings, 70 percent of the next $100, -

and '50 percent of the remainder
of his paycheck. Seventy per-
cent. of any pension. or retire-
ment benefits, or payments
from health, accident, or dis-
ability insurance would also be
exempt. Exempted for a single
worker would be his first $40 of
wages, 35 percent of the next
$100, and 35 percent of there-
mainder. Thirty-five ‘percent of
any insurance or retirement

benefits would also be exempted C

~_ from garnishment. .—

, "Debt Adjusting"

 l---Another bill, introduced by

Reps. Gol1ob,"Yost, Carroll, and
Moore, would outlaw the busi-

ness of “debt adjusting”—act—.

ing as an intermediary between

 .a debtor and his creditors, for
, some payment, in order to set-
. .-tle,,:Jcompoun,d,. or, in any way
 alter theterms of payment of
.~ ,deb.ts..~.?Vio1ators would be sub-

ject»-to a fine of up to $1,000 or
" * up to 30 days in jail. This bill,
too’; is in the Business Affairs

 

Committee of the House of Rep-
resentatives.

Ten Republicans joined with
33 Democrats in passing the
first Kopel measure in the
House, controlled by the Demo-
crats 42 to 23. Six Democrats,
including Rules Committee
chairman and former speaker
Charles Conklin, opposed the

bill, along with 14 GOP rep-
resentatives.

Republicans control‘ the state
senate and Governor John A.
Love is also a member of the
GOP.

Kopel, although not overly op-
timistic, says that his bills
should receive some support in
the upper chamber.

Workers’ Union, Local 50 -was celebrated at the annual
Christmas party held on Dec. 12. Founded in 1934, the
local now has about 150 members, a large percentage of

whom brought their families to the affair, which featured ‘

a buffet luncheon and music for dancing and listening.
George Brozovich, who played Santa Claus, distributed
fruit and candy to the children" .and their parents. Financial
Secretary Henry Johnson heads the entertainment commit-
tee which handled the arrangements for the Christmas-

Colorado Legislature Debates Progress Made

To “Chileanize"
Copper Industry

Chilean President Eduardo
Frei, just prior to Christmas
and only seven weeks after his
inauguration, announced that he
had concluded agreements with
major U. S. copper producers
in Chile implementing his cam-
paign pledge to “Chileanize”
that country’s copper industry.

The agreements provide for
Chilean government participa-
tion in copper operations of
three U. S. producers——Anacon-
da, Cerro Corporation, and Ken-
necott.

A total of $450 million innew
investment in copper mining
and refining is planned over the
next five years, tofinance an
expansion of copper mine pro-
duction from the present level
of 617,000 tons per year to 1,200,-
000 tons by 1970. Refined copper
output wouldbe increased from
about 275,000 tons now to 700,000
tons per year by 1970. Present
income tax rates on the copper
operations would be reduced and
stabilized for 20 years.

-Anaconda will retain owner-
ship of its present producing fa-
cilities in Chile, but is to form
a new company with 25 percent,
participation by the Chilean
government to develop a new
property, the La Exotica mine.
Anaconda will increase its elec-
trolytic refining capacity by 140
percent. '

Controlling Interest

Kennecott is to sell a 51 per-
cent interest in its Braden Cop-
p-er Company to Chile for $80.
million. Kennecott will lend this
amount to the new, Chilean-con-
trolled company, and additional
loans for expansion totaling $120
million will be forthcoming in
part from the Chilean govern-
ment and, hopefully, from inter- -
national lending‘ agencies. Ken-
necott will’ continue to operate _

-the properties.

As previously announced,

V Chile will take a 25-percent in-

terest in a corporation it will
organize with Cerro Corpora-'

. tion to develop the Rio Blanco _

mine..

anization, program depends upon 4

THE‘ MINE-MILL umon

Golden Age of ‘Mutual Trusteeship’
Still in Future; Strike Fund Needed

by Irving Dichter
International Secretary-Treasurer

NE of the interesting by-products of the present election cam-
paign in the Steelworkers union is the discussion of “tuxedo

trade unionism.” I. W. Abel, Dave McDonald’s opponent, in ex-"V

plaining his candidacy, said, “We have an obligation and responsi-
bility to correct the trend towards tuxedo trade unionism and to
get back on the track of solid trade unionism.”

What essentially is the “tuxedo trade unionism” of the Steel-
workers? It is trade unionism removed from the rank-and—file—
removed from the sweat, the problems, and also from the inspira-
tion and fighting strength of the rank-and-file. It is trade unionism
of the fairy tale that men of good will repre-
senting industry and labor can sit down at the
bargaining table and resolve their differences

‘The very words “mutual trusteeship” are
themselves a mockery of a worker’s day-to-day
life on the job. He is an employee, a worker,
a hired hand. He does as he is told on the job.
The only thing that stands between him and
the gate is his union and his contract. “Mu-
tual trusteeship” didn’t bring the union into
existence and doesn’t sustain it today. If one
looks at his union from the bottom up. rather
than from the top down, he sees it in its right
perspective, and down below there are no
tuxedos, nor is there “mutual trusteeship.”

‘k-**k

RE TIMES changing? Are we living in a golden era of mu-

-tual understanding? If so, it has bypassed our industry. Who
can forget the insolence of the employers in ’59 and ’60 when they
literally refused to bargain until we struck the entire industry?
The ’59 and ’60 strikes were rough on the union and rough on our
membership. But withoutthose strikes -we wouldn’t have achieved
the contract gains we have since secured. And in ’64, with the best

Dichter

metal market and thehighest prices in years in a booming econo-. _

my, we had to strike at Kennecott and threaten strike in every
major chain before we achieved our objectives.,.»“

1967 is but a short time away. The officers of our international
are preparing today to strengthen our union to face that round of
bargaining. But more thanthat, we move to strengthen ourselves
now so that we may fight today's battle on the job. Every griev-
ance filed is a little battle to protect our contract terms. Every
grievance filed means a man’s job, or his right to a proper wage,
or his right to appropriate hours, or his safety on the job, or his
right to retire. . -

V * * ‘k

HENV AND IF the golden age comes to our industry, we shall
be ready for it. Until then, we shall have to depend upon
our own’ strength to continue to improve our wages and working

conditions. As secretary-treasurer, I can’t escape the knowledge,

that our muscle must include a sizable strike fund. It always stands
as atoken of our ability to take care of our members and their
families if we are forced to fight.‘ .

‘The only? way to build a ‘strike fund is to put money into it.
There is -no easy way. We’ve got to set ourselves a goal of $1,000,000
strike fund and start building it now.

 

Standard Metals to Develop  

First Imperial Smelter in U.S.w

A boost to domestic lead-zinc production is anticipated as the result of the an-
nouncement earlier this month by Standard Metals Corporation that it will build an
Imperial" process lead-zinc smelter in the United States—the first of its kind in this
country. The site of the smelter, however, has not yet been determined, nor is any

time schedule available.

Boris -Gresov, chairman of Standard Metals, reports that a number of other com-
panies may be involved in financing the smelter. The estimated cost of construction.

is $25 million. ’

The Imperial process utilizes a blast furnace which permits simultaneous recov-
ery of the lead, copper, gold, silver, cadmium, and other metals found in complex ores,
and permits a saving of as much as $2.50 on each ton of high-grade ore. The technol-

ogy was developed by Imperial

-Smelting Processes, Ltd. of Lon-

don which has granted a ‘license
to Standard Metals for use of the
process. -

Three such smelters are now
in operation in England, one
each in Australia, Rhodesia and
France, and one each are in
construction in Poland and Ru-
mania. -

ARA Report

Standard M e t a Is’ announce-

ment came a. week’ after the‘

Area Redevelopment Adminis-
tration released a 246-page re-
port, “A Study of Non-Ferrous
Metal Refining Opportunities in
the Four-Corner States” (Colo-
rado, Utah, Arizona, and New
Mexico), which suggested the
feasibility of establishing an Im-

perial smelting-refining complex
in that area.

The ARA study estimated the
following possible metals recov-
ery from Colorado concentrates
alone: 57,400 tons of special high-
grade zinc; 20,335 tons of refined
lead; 2,947 tons of lead matte;
4,461 tons of copper matte; 200
tons of refined cadmium; over
2 million ounces of refined sil-
ver; 14,500 ounces of refined
gold; and 85,200 tons of sulphur
(recoverable in the form of gas
to be combined with other min-
erals to make a fertilizer).

The study said that such a
unit would call for a work force
of some 300 skilled production
workers. A spokesman for the
agency said that possible sites

Farmer said, “I applaud you and salute you. I come as your guest and will lend whatever support I possibly can

Leadville Situation

Leadville for some time has
been interested in the possibility
of revitalizing the mining opera-
tions of the district, but has so
far been unable to work out
means of financing the extensive
dewatering of mines which would
be necessary. Sizable reserves
of lead-zinc ores exist in the dis-
trict, unworked for many years. ‘

The Leadville-Lake C o u n t y
Economic Development Council
quotes a U.S. Interior Depart-
ment report as saying that three,
million tons of lead-zinc ore,.av-
eraging more than 15 percent
metal, are available in the dis-
trict. The Council itself has pro-
posed construction of an Imperi-
al smelter there. .

The American Metal Market,
trade journal of the industry, _

‘notes that since the Imperial

process is aimed at recovery-of
complex ores which cannot be

. economically handled by older

methods, the new Standard oper-

- ation would not be competing

  

for already ‘ scarce ores, but

would be entering a new field. .
This might result in consider~.

able stimulation to the whole

lead-zinc industry, both mining

and traditional smelting and re-

fining.

THE MINE-MILI. UNIONS

February. 1965' 9.

Medicareﬂopes Soar; Leﬂers Can Help

A hospital insurance program for the aged—the so-called medicare bill——was the first measure introduced in the Senate and ‘House of
Representatives after "the 89th Congress convened on Jan. 4. S-1, introduced by Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D-N.M.) and 41 co-sponsors, and
HR-1, thrown into the hopper by Rep. Cecil R. King (D-Calif.), would have the program administered by the Social Security system, but
would ﬁnance it by a payroll tax that would establish a trust fund separate from that which now pays the present retirement and disability

benefits.

In his campaign, President Johnson said that he would make medicare a top priority, and, on Jan. 7,
to Congress, he called for enactment of a medicare program for persons 65 years and older. _
. -Friends and opponents of the proposal alike are now admitting that some sort of medical care program is virtually assured of Congressional

in his first of several special messages

approval this session; Even the heretofore intractable American Medical Association, while certainly not endorsing the bill, is putting forth
alternative proposals rather than continuing its stance of pure and simple opposition.

The optimism of the bill’s backers is due only partly to the gain of 38 Democratic seats in the House, giving the President’s party a 295
to 140 edge. The Democratic-Republican ratio on the House Ways and Means Committee, which blocked action on the medicare proposal

last year, has been changed from 15-10 to 17-8. The powerful chairman of the committee, Rep. Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.), who has fought the -

measure in the past, also
has been indicating that he

"will support this year’s bill.

Moreover, three committee
members who had opposed
medicare in the past were
defeated in their bids for
re-election.

The National Council of
Senior Citizens, a lobbyist
for the bill, says that of 40
key Congressional races in-
volving incumbents opposed
to medicare, supporters of
the administration’s pro-
posal won 30. In total,
medicare backers picked up
44 new seats in the House.‘

Of 14 medical doctors
who sought Congressional
seats in November, all but
three were defeated, most
of them by large margins.
One doctor friendly to med-
icare won re-election over
another doctor who op-
posed the plan and had the
support of the political ac-
tion arm of the AMA.

A Popular Proposal

The medicare issue, in
other words, proved itself
to be a politically potent
one-——an‘d' even many Re-
publicans, who in the past

opposed‘ increased health!

insurance ‘benefits, are be-
ginning to realize this. The

GOP, in fact, is expected to ,

come up with several alter-
native proposals to the
President’s package, some
of which may go beyond it
in certain areas. Three Re-
publicans — assistant GOP
Senate leader Thomas H.
Kuchel of California, Jacob
K. Javits of New York, and
Clifford P. Case of New
Jersey —- are co-sponsoring
the administration’s bill
S 1.

There can be little ques-
tion but that medicare is
now a popular proposal
with the American people.
A recent Gallup poll showed
63 percent in favor, with
only 28 percent opposed.
The ‘labor movement, in-
cluding Mine-Mill, has been
pushing for years for its
enactment. And, while the
outlook for the bill is
brighter now than ever be-
fore, letters on the subject
to Senators and Congress-
men are still needed.

The fact, too, that medi-
care’s popularity has vacil-‘
lated over the years, de-
pending in part on the de-
gree to which the AMA has

its huge propaganda _-ma-,

chine in operation, indi-

_ cates -that there still exists

some public misconceptions

‘ regarding the proposal.‘

Many citizens, says Gallup,
think it will include more
benefits than may actually
bethe case._ 9 ‘

gress passes the bill, as ex-
pected?

First, although most la-
bor organizations feel that
an eventual goal should. be
a national health care pro-
gram which would cover all
U. S. citizens, the benefits
from the present King-An-
derson bill would go only
to Americans who are -65
years or more of age. This
figure is now about 18 mil-
lion—only about half of

' whom now have any kind

of private health insurance.

The Needs of the Aged

Coverage of this group,
however, would be a good
beginning. In addition to
helping 18 million persons
directly, it would take" a
financial burden or worry
about the possibility of
such a burden from the

backs of the older person’s . ;

children or other relatives.
Persons of all ages in our
society would be the bene-
ficiaries.

The need for medical
care help for the aged is
simple: their average in-
come after retirement is
drastically reduced at a
time when their average
hospital and medical bills
are increasing. 6

Two-thirds of this coun-
try’s aged—12 million per-
sons——are suffering from

who have not reached re-
tirement age.

In only half of the cases
where a retiree has private
health insurance does that
insurance offer adequate
coverage. In other words,
75 percent of all elderly
couples have either no pro-
tection or inadequate pro-
tection through private
means.

10 Percent of Population

Then too, the number of
elderly persons in Ameri-
can society has been in-
creasing at a rapid rate, as
has the proportion of those
over 65 to the total popu-
lation. Only 35 years ago,
there were 6.6 million peo-
ple over 65 in the United
States-—-5.3 percent of the
country’s population. Today

that group represents close
to 10 percent of the popu-
lation. In 35 more years,
this country will have an
estimated 35 million per-
sons age 65 or older.

Until about 1935, over
half of American men con-
tinued to work after age
65. Except for the years of
World War II, that per-
centage has been steadily
going down.

The group then which is
trying to live on pensions,
retirement benefits, Social
Security payments, and
perhaps public = assistance
is the ‘same group whose
average medical expenses
are the highest in the soci-
ety. .
President Truman, back
in 1949, called for the first

_medical -care bill which
would cover all citizens.-

Neither the Forand bill,
which was later introduced
but never passed, nor the
present King-Anderson bill
attempts to do that. Cover-
age will be strictly limited
to the elderly. _
The present bill, too, has
other limitations. It will not
pay regular doctor bills,
surgical expenses, or for
drugs, unless prescribed in
a hospital or nursing home.
But in providing financial
protection against the ma-
jor costs of hospital care,
some nursing home ex-
penses, and home nursing
services, it would be a step
in the right direction from

the chaotic situation which,

now exists in the health
care area.

Kerr-Mills

The Kerr-Mills bill, passed
by Congress in October,
1960, has been called un-
workable by the Senate

subcommittee on Health of

the Elderly. I
That program, which was

opposed by organized labor

from its inception, offered .: .0
the states the opportunity ’

to receive federal funds on
a matching basis to help
pay for medical expenses
of older citizens not other-
wise eligible for public as-
sistance. At the end of Aug-
ust, 1963 after three years
of -operation, the Senate
subcommittee pointed out,
only 28 states had imple-
mented the program.

In addition to restricting
benefits to residents -of the
wealthier states, Kerr-Mills

incorporates the hated-

“means test” to determine.
eligibility. In other words,

an older person must pro- -

vide information on his in-
come and savings and, in
some states, the . . resources
of hischildren before being
allowed to participate- If
his financial resources ex-
ceed a certain amounte-
and generally. the figure
isn’t. very high at all—he
gets no help. -. , ‘

Another criticism has
been the high administra- »

tive costs of Kerr-Mills,
which, in some states, have
exceeded the amount paid
out in benefits. In addi-
tion, several states have
simply transferred those

‘persons who were already

on other welfare programs,
mainly old age assistance,
to the Kerr-Mills program,
allowing the federal gov-
ernment to pick up a big
chunk of the tab which had
previously been the state's
responsibility.

In August, 1963, only
148,000 persons—-less than '

one percent of the nation’s
elderly—received any help

from the Kerr-Mills pro-

gram.

This low figure should
not be surprising in View

King-Anderson.
The Current Proposal

Under the King-Ander-
son . proposal all persons
over 65 years will be eligi-
ble for benefits, including
those who have not partici-
pated in Social Security.
Those persons will be fi-
nanced by general reve-
nues, although the financ-
ing for most of the pro-
gram will come from in-
creased Social Security pay-

v roll deductions, which will

eventually rise to 5.2 per-
cent of the first $5600
earned each year by‘ 1971.

The present payroll de-
duction is 3.6 percent of the
first $4800 " earned by a
worker—about $174. Only
about $25 of the increase
in ‘payroll deduction, which
by 1971 will reach a maxi-
mum of $291.20 per year,
will go’ for medical’ insur-

. ance. The remainder will fi-

nance an increase ‘of seven
percent in retirement bene-
fits underv Social Security-
which is also part of the
medicare bill. Employers,
of course, will continue to
match each worker’s pay-

' roll deduction.

The health care program
would provide 60 days of
hospital care per illness,
with the patient paying for
one day (about $40) by
himself. Also covered would
be up to 60 days in “ex-
tended-care facilities,” such
as a nursing home, if the
patient ;were transferred
from a hospital.

Up to 240 visits annually
by a nurse to a patient’s
home would be paid for, as
would part of the cost of
diagnostic checkups at hos-

pitals. Drugs prescribed in
the hospital or nursing
home would also come un-
der the plan, but not those
prescribed outside. ‘

If enacted, the program’s
hospital and home-care ben-
efits would begin on July
1, 1966, with nursing home
benefits starting the follow-
ing Jan. 1.

The cost to the self-em-
ployed, who already pay
higher Social Security tax-
es, would reach a maxi-
mum of $436.80 by 1971——
with about $37.80 to go for
medical insurance.

Social Security
Administration

Although the medicare
program would be adminis-
tered by the Social Security
system to avoid setting up
a costly new structure, the
funds for it-will be kept in
a fund separate from that
which pays retirement and
disability benefits. This dis-
tinction was made as a con-

cession to Rep. Mills, in or-_

der to insure his support
for the new bill, and in
practice is expected to have
virtually no effect.
‘Another provision of the
bill authorizes private in-
surance carriers to pool
their resources to offer low-
cost health insurance to the
elderly which would supple-
ment the Social Security

medical care. This was pat-

terned after an amendment
by Sen. Javits, which was
adopted along with the
medicare package by the
Senate last year.

On Sept. 2, 1964, the Sen-
ate voted 49 to 44 to add
health care for the aged to
the Social Security system,
but medicare died when the
House refused to go along.
There was no floor vote in
the House, however, be-
cause the bill never got out
of Ways and Means.

Johnson Message
In his Jan. 7 message to

Congress this year, Presi-
dent Johnson not only
called for quick enactment
of the medicare bill, but
said that he would also rec-
ommend legislation which
would:

0 Increase the authoriza-
tions -for maternal and
child health and crippled
children’s services;

0 Extend the grant pro-
grams for family health
services, clinics for do-
mestic migrant workers,
and community vaccina-
tion assistance;

0 Authorize a five-year pro-
gram of grants for the

initial costs of personnel

to man community men-
tal health centers;

0 Authorize construction
and- modernization of

- States.

workshops and rehabili-

tation centers;

'0 Develop a five-year pro-
gram of project grants to
establish multi—purpose
regional medical com-
plexes for an all out at-
tack on heart disease,
cancer, stroke, and other
major diseases;

0 Authorize scholarships
for medical and dental
students who would not
otherwise be able to enter
or complete their train-
ing in these fields.

The President’s interest
in the area of health, the
apparent popularity of the
current bill, and other fac-
tors make many people be-
lieve that the present battle
is only the beginning of a
long-term campaign to pro-
vide better health care for
all citizens of the United
It is undoubtedly
true that, if the system
works well for the aged,
there will be pressure to ex-
tend its coverage in terms
of increasing benefits and
in protecting a larger seg-
ment of the population.

Many other countries,
after all, protect all of their
citizens from the financial
disaster of ill health.

Are Sleeping Pills Safe?

Those highly touted sleeping pills may seem harmless in -the
TV commercials—but some, at least, are not safe enough. CON-
SUMER REPORTS in its January issue cites a medical journal
report on six patients who, within a six-month period, had at-
tempted suicide with overdoses of Sominex. They didn’tidie, but
each became critically ill and required several, days of hospital-
ization. Their symptoms included coma, convulsions, hallucinations,
incoordination, rapid pulse, dilation of the pupils, dry and flushed-
skin, and fever. A

Sominex and at least one other brand, Sleep-Eze, contain small
amounts of scopolamine, and the would-be suicides suffered severe
scopolamine poisoning. _. . _.

There is an added risk from scopolamine. In susceptible indivi-
duals—especial1y older people—-it can precipitate an attack of acute
glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. ~ ‘ 9

Many other non-prescription sleeping pills do not contain-scopo- —

lamine but depend solely on the drowsiness that can be induced
by antihistimines. But these pills too should be handled cautiously,’
for they have been known to produce side effects ranging from
dizziness, incoordination, and blurred vision to nervousness,-loss
of appetite, frequent urination, skin rashes, and ocasionally even
blood changes. 3

The pills are hardly worth the risk since, as Consumers Union
points out, over-the-counter sleeping pills are unlikely to help any
but the mildest forms of wakefulness—and then only for some peo- .
ple. Persistent insomnia usually requires medical treatment.

FHA: New. But Limitecl.,Protection

For Home Buyers .
As most people have notrealized, up to recently the mortgage‘

insurance program of the Federal Housfng Administration gave ‘

home buyers no direct‘ protection against structural defects that
escaped FHA inspection. With passage of the Gruening amendment

to the National Housing Act last year, some protection has been
provided. But, according to an article in the January issue" of CON~‘ -

SUMER REPORTS, the protection is sharply limited. .
' Previously, the FHA*~ held that it could not use its funds to‘
repair even the most serious structural defects in a house, unless -
and until the homeowner defaulted on his mortgage payments and -
surrendered the house. This meant, of course, that he lost every-
thing he had invested, but in some cases the repair would have .-
been so expensive that the homeowner felt he could not afford it;
Now, the Housing Commissioner has discretionary authority to pay
for certain repairs before the homeowner defaults. ,

But there are some strings attached. First, the structural de-

' fect corrected must be serious enough to “affect the livability of

the property”——and Housing Commissioner Philip Brownstein has
indicated that he will put a very narrow interpretation on livability.

Second, the program is limited to houses begun under FHA or VA?

financing after September 2, 1964; it is not retroactive. -
Furthermore, the ‘protection covers the first four years after,-_
the first owner takes title. And the Commissioner’s.decision on any
complaint is final--there is no recourse to law. _ ,
Therefore Consumers Union repeats its advice of long standing:.
Before you buy or put down money on any house, new or used, with
or without Government mortagage insurance, have the house in-

spected by a competent builder, engineer, or architect who is not '

otherwise involved in the sale.

Fallout Levels Still High

Although atomic bomb testing by the major powers was sus-

pended in 1962, radioactive fallout from the huge detonations of
1961 and 1962 still continues.

In its January issue, CONSUMER REPORTS compares test re-
sults on the average levels of radioactive fallout found in typical

teen-agers’ diets in nine cities in February, April, May, and June, -

1964 with the average level for the corresponding months in 1963.
The studies were financed in part by the U. S. Public Health Service.‘
The 1964 levels of strontium-90 were about the same overall (higher
in some cities, lower in others), as the combined strontium-90 and-89'
had been in 1963. But the amount of cesium-137 was higher in every
city. (Strontium lodges in bone and may therefore cause leukemia
or bone cancer in some people. Cesium-137 does not gravitateto

any one organ of the body, nor is it retained more than a few ‘

months; but our suppply is constantly being replenished by the food
we eat, and it can affect the reproductive cells and through them
our progeny.) .

During the first half of 1964, the strontium-90 level in the foods ’

Consumers Union tested in 10 cities (only 9 of these were included

in the 1963 tests and are therefore included in the table) averaged 1
around 14% of the Federal Radiation Council’s maximum accept- :

able level under “normal peacetime conditions.” The levels of

- cesium-137 averaged around 8% of the maximum acceptable level,"

The highest single-city average for stronium units was that of Bis-
marck, North Dakota-—22% of the guidance level. Portland, Oregon,
had the highest average cesium-137—level———15% of the guidance.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

February. 1965

Sabotage by Growers Possible in Attempt

To Revivethe Expired Bracero Program

Public Law 78, under which thousands of Mexican laborers had been brought into this country as temporary farm hands during each of
the past 14 years, expired on Dec. 31, 1964. With the corpse barely cold, the Senate Agriculture Committee held hearings in the middle of last
month on the new regulations covering migrant farm workers amidst screams from many large growers and- growers’ associations that a
revival of the bracero program in some form is the only thing which can save them from bankruptcy. ,

U.S. Labor Sec. W. Willard Wirtz, who has said that he is “firmly opposed” to a renewal of the expired law, also told the committee that
there is no labor shortage anywhere in the country which would require the importation of foreign help. . _

The bracero program has been strenuously opposed by Mine-Mill, particularly by its locals in the Southwest, an area which has seen a
high concentration of foreign labor over the years. Not only does the importation program cut down on job opportunities for domestic

workers, the union argues, but
it also operates to depress the
wage scale of the entire region.

Many workers who have at-
tempted to supplement their in-
comes by working in the fields
during periods of shutdown or
strike have had direct , ex-
perience with the atrociously
low wages paid for farm work.

New Regulations

On Dec. 19, Wirtz announced
strict regulations and terms
governing the importation of
foreign laborers. Basically, his
order set up minimum wage
rates and working conditions
which growers would have to
offer to domestic workers be-
fore they could ask for workers
The minimum
rates, which range fromaa low
of 90 cents per hour in New
Mexico and Texas to $1.25 in
California and other states for
the first three months of this
year, will be upped to $1.15 to
$1.40 per hour on April 1.

The new regulations scotched
hopes of the big growers for
continuing the importation of
workers under terms of the Im-
migration and Nationality Act.
There is already much specu-
lation, however, that the re-
sponse of the growers may be
to sabotage the government’s
effort to develop a program
which would give first crack at
the farm jobs to U. S. workers
at rates” higher than those

which have prevailed in agri-‘

business for years.

Thomas L. -Pitts, a California
AFL-CIO leader, for example,
charges the. growers with
“cynical maneuvers” to create
the appearance of a harvest la-
bor shortage, saying that they
may “let crops rot in the field
as a publicity stunt.”

Upset with the prospect of '

having to pay higher wages to
domestic farm hands, many
growers may this year refuse to
hire the necessary American
workers, accept a loss, and
blame the poor harvest on a
labor shortage — in effect, a
high-powered propaganda cam-
paign aimed at a revival of the
bracero program. In crops
which are already suffering
from, price declines, the loss
would be minimized.

Congressional
Battle Lines

The battle lines in Congress

are once. again being drawn on.

the subject. In a statement re-
leased on Jan. 13, Republican
representatives from Washing-
ton, Oregon, California, Idaho,
Montana, Utah, and Arizona
said that the entire employment
and economic situations in the
Western states were threatened
by the new regulations govern-
mg importation of labor. Wirtz’
action, they said, would result
in the “denial of work oppor-
tunities to thousands of par-
tially handicapped people, in-
cluding the elderly, younger
children who work with their
parents picking fruit, and those
with minor physical handi-
caps.”

The GOP Congressmen also
contended that the new mini-
mum wage rates would place
Western states in “a totally un-
realistic competitive position”
with some other states and with
Mexico, where the average pay
for a harvest worker was said
tobe $1 a day.

It is because of the low wage
scale in -‘Mexico, of course, that
so many braceros, literally

“81‘l1§18.." the Hispanic equivalent.

of the English term “hands,”

 

have been eager to work in the
United States.

Although they were receiving
wages higher’ than ’ they could
make in their own country,
their presence on U. S. farms
produced a labor surplus which
depressed the wage scale for
the entire ‘industry — and for
others as well.

Guarantees for Braceros

Under Public Law 78, in fact,
which was an agreement be-
tween the governments of the
two countries, braceros were
guaranteed a minimum hourly
wage of 95 cents and at least
three hours of work a day. They
also received such fringe bene-
fits as housing, transportation,
medical and occupational insur-

ance, and assurances of ade-

quate food-—benefits many of
which were not offered to do-
mestic workers.

American workers, in fact,
have been making as little. as 60
cents an hour as migrant farm-
ers. .

The new Labor Department
regulations do not set up a
minimum Wage for all workers
involved in picking fruits and
vegetables. They do, however,
insure that lower rates are not
caused by a labor abundance
due to importation of foreign
help. Growers simply won’t be
able to hire braceros unless they
have tried and failed to get do-

mestic labor at the stated rates. .

Recruitment of Workers

The Department of Labor
through state employment of-
fices and other agencies will
help in the recruitment of do-
mestic workers. Although most
of these agencies have reported
that ‘thus far they have“beenl
able to find far more workers
than they have _had requests
for, there has been some criti-
cism too that they have been
dragging their feet in recruit-
ment.

In California, for ' example,
spokesmen for six Mexican-
American organizations charged
the State Farm Placement Ser-
vice with “delay and procras-
tination,” pro-grower policies,
and bypassing Mexican-Ameri
cans with farm skills.

Stating that vigorous recruit-

szeaaeeos wo

ing plans were activated‘ only
one week prior to the expiration
of the bracero program, the
groups’ statement said that the
stage was now set for “an
audacious reversal” of the will
of Congress.

1963 Vote

Although the U. S. Senate
had, in 1963, votedto extend the
bmcero law for two more years,
it had gone along with the
House of Representatives, which
approved a one-year extension
only. Many Congressmen indi-
cated that this would be their
last vote to continue the pro-
gram, when the House voted 173
to 158 in late October for the
one-year extension.

Most of the big growers re-
luctantly watched the -program
quietly lapse on Dec. 31, 1964,
realizing that any attempt to
get Congress to grant another
extension of PL 78 was prob-
ably doomed to failure at that
time. Now, however, it is be-
coming clear that their hopes to
continue the program under
other immigration laws may
not work either, and, the propa-
ganda campaign is underway
again. -

Request Cancellation

Many growers are saying that
local workers are unfit for stoop
labor, which undoubtedly is
arduous and tiring work. The

Imperial Valley Farmers’ As- .

sociation, the largest hiring
group for winter -lettuce grow-
ers in California, for example,
canceled a request for 1800 do-
mestic workers, claiming that
the first men sent" by the state
employment ‘office were not
able to do the work.

The association later back-
tracked and said it would hire
500 domestic workers. Part of
the indifference as to whether-
or not the winterharvest is
picked could be due, of course,
to the current price—down from
a usual $2 to 90 cents a box.
Agriculture is highly. profitable
when the price is right, and let-
tuce occasionally rises to $3 or
$4 per box.

The Labor Department regula-
tions also state that domestic
workers must be offered, as a
minimum, all the terms and

conditions of employment that
were offered to the Mexican
workers, including a written
contract, before a grower can
request foreign help. “Family
housing,” the rules now say,
“must be provided where feas-
ible and necessary.”

Faced with the loss of labor
by braceros, whom the Jan. 16
Business Week magazine de-
scribes as “skilled, highly moti-
vated workers who obey orders,
work quickly, and don’t com-
plain,” growers are also begin-
ning to talk about increased me-
chanization.

Labor representatives, testi-
fying before Congressional com-
mittees against the extension of

PL .78 back in 1963, pointed out

that automation had already
taken a fearful toll of farm la-
bor ,jobs. And mechanization
may have some limits. Unlike
such crops as cotton and grains,
many farm products such as
berries today cannot be picked
through any means other than
human hands.

Last Year's Figures

In 1964, some 180,000 Mexican
workers were brought into the
United States for average stays
of about three months. The
largest number of them, some
70,000 in the peak month of

   

September, were used in Cali- ~
fornia. Most of the others went A

to Arizona, New Mexico, Ar-

kansas, Colorado, and Texas, al-A 
though the bmcero program '

also played a minor role in the
economies of some 20 other
states.

Although Mexican migrants
drifted in and out of the United
States in ﬂuctuating numbers
and erratic ways from the be-
ginning of the 20th century, it"
was not until 1942, with the
crisis of World War II, that the
bracero program became at all
formalized and regulated by the
government.

Between 1942 and 1951,.-

braceros were imported to meet
the pressing need for manpower
on the farms through a series
of agreements between the gov-
ernments of the two countries.
By then used to a large and
handy source of cheap labor,
the powerful growers were able,
in that latter year, to secure
Congressional approval of Pub-
lic Law 78, which has been ex-
tended again and again.

The outcry against the pro-
gram, however, has grown to

large proportions in recent , I

years. “. . . the working con-
ditions maintained by. some of
the growers,” said Wirtz in his
Dec. 19 announcement of new
regulations, “have been so b.ad

that church and civic groups . -

and labor organizations have
protested bitterly.” ,

Program Exposed .- _ ._

A couple of years ago, a na-.
tionwide television network. re-
ported on the migrant farm
work situation in a program on-
titled “Harvest of Shame.” And
only last year, Dr.
Galarza, who himself once had
worked as a farm hand, authored
an attack on the bracero pro-
gram in a book 'called—“Mer-
chants of Labor.” ' 

A prominent labor organizer

in the West, who now heads "

the Agricultural Workers Or-
ganizing Committee with
branches throughout California-

and an indeterminate member- "

ship, Al Green has been push-
ing for the elimination of the
bracero program. “There’s
never any shortage of labor in
America,” he says, “only a
shortage in pay.” .

By April 1, according to the
new standards set up by the De-
partment of Labor, domestic
farm workers in California, Con-
necticut, Montana, Minnesota,’-,

Nebraska, South Dakota, and  
Utah should be getting a mini-.

mum of $1.40 an hour. In other
states, such as Colorado, the
minimum has been set at $1.30.
In Arizona, it will be $1.25,
while in several states, includ-
ing Arkansas, New Mexico, and
Texas, the minimum rate is set
at $1.15 per hour.

The bracero story, however,
may not be over. The coming
months may see desperate and
drastic attempts made on be-
half of its revival.

oral Arguments
 “Conspracy”

 
  

tpeal

DENVER, Colo.—Telford Taylor and Nathan Witt, in oral argument before the

10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Jan. 7,

said that insufficiency of evidence

and legal errors during their 1963 trial should result in the reversal of the convic-
tion of six‘ past and present lVline—Mill officers on the charge of conspiracy to
defraud the U.S. government by filing false non-Communist affadavits.

The court’s decision could be handed down at any time during the next several

months.

Chief Judge Alfred P. Murrah, Judge John C. Pickett, and Judge Delrnas C.

I-lill heard the arguments of the defense attorneys and Asst. U.S. Attorney Donald .

P. MacDonald, who represented
the government. This was the
same panel that reversed the
union officials’ conviction in
their first 1 trial in 1959. '

Briefs Filed

Written briefs had been sub-
mitted on behalf of the six men
and the government prior to
the oral arguments.

Taylor, who was chief prose-
cutor at the Nurenberg war
crime trials in 1945, said that
90 to 95 percent of the govern-
ment's case was based on vi-
carious admissions——admissions
made by someone other than
the defendants. He said that the
trial judge, U. S. Dist. Judge
Alfred A. Arraj, had erred in
his final instructions to the j7lI‘y

‘ by failing to point out that aide-

fendent had to concur in or
adopt policies dmentioned at a
meeting in order for the state-
ments at the meeting to be used
against him.

Judge Arraj was mistaken,
too, he said, in allowing the jury
to decide certain questions of
law in its consideration of what
evidence was relevant to the al-
leged conspiracy. Taylor argued
that these legal questions should
have been decided by the trial
judge, not determined by the
jury.

Maintaining that many of the
statements introduced by the
government should not have
been admissible as evidence,
Taylor said that the govern-
ment had not proved its charge
even if no inadmissible evidence
had been introduced. He also
pointed out several discrepan-
cies between testimony by gov-
ernment witnesses at the first
and second trials.

Taylor stated that he felt the .

court should have admitted as

evidence union expense vouch- '

ers which would have ‘cleared.

THE MINE-MILL ‘UNION

February. med 

HUAC Challenge Frustrated

WASHINGTON, D. C.—As Congress considered rules changes directly after convening on Jan.
4, the hope to challenge the House Un-American Activities Committee was thwarted by Speaker
John Mccormack, who refused to recognize Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.).

Edwards, one of 20 Congressmen who voted against HUAC’s appropriations in the last session,
says he believes that the committee violates constitutional rights in its “exposure investigations.”
He had planned to ask Congress to change its rules by eliminating HUAC as apstanding committee-—
a proposal that would have forced an immediate vote on the issue at the beginning of the session.

He later introduced a resolution calling for the abolition of HUAC and the enlargement of the Ju-

diciary Committee, but that
resolution, and eight others that
are similar, will be referred to
the Rules Committee, where
they are expected to die.
McCormack, who also two
years ago refused to recognize
a representative who wished to
propose a rule change eliminat-
ing HUAC, voted against the
motion to first make it a stand-
ing committee back in 1945.

Other Resolutions

Leonard Farbstein (D-N.Y.),
Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Calif.),
John V. Lindsay (R-N.Y.),
James Roo-sevelt (D-Calif.),
Charles C. Diggs, Jr. (D-Mich.),
Joseph Y. Resnick (D-N.Y.),
and Benjamin S. Rosenthal (D-
N.Y.) introduced resolutions
calling for the abolition of
HUAC and an expanded Judici-
ary Committee, while Phillip
Burton (D-Calif.) put in a reso-
lution calling only for abolition
pure and simple.

Meanwhile, for refusing to
testify at closed hearings of
HUAC, three persons have been
charged with contempt of Con-
gress and will go to trial in
March. Mrs. Dagmar Wilson
and Mrs. Donna Allen of the
Women’s Strike for Peace and
Russell Nixon of the weekly
NATIONAL GUARDIAN had in-
dicated that they would be will-
ing to testify on the condition

Savannah Workers
Achieve Retirement
Plan in New Pact

SAVANNAH, Ga.——Emp1oyees
of the Atlantic Creosoting Com-
pany at Port Wentworth in
Savannah, who have long been
fighting for a company-paid re-
tirement and disability pro-
gram, scored avbreakthrough in
this area in negotiations con-
cluded in December.

The new three-year contract
calls for the company to put two

' centsper hour into the retire-

ment plan during the first year,
five cents per hour in the sec-
ond year, and seven cents per
hour in the third year. The
United Benefit Insurance Com-
pany of Omaha, Neb. will ad-
minister the regular retirement
plan, with the Aetna Insurance
Company handling the disability
plan.

Under the latter program, any
worker who is disabled through
any cause will receive 60 per-
cent of his wages for the rest
of his life.

In addition, the agreement
provides across-the-board wage
increases of three cents per
hour for the first year and a
half of its term and another
three cents an hour hike during
its second half.

The 85 workers, members of

the 400-member Savannah Fer-
tilizer, Chemical, and Manu-
facturing Local No. 870, over-
whelmingly ratified the settle-
ment, noting that the new re-
tirement program is another in
a long series of gains from the
time when workers were re-
ceiving 35 cents an hour and no
paid vacation. The present va-
cation schedule calls for one
week after one year, two after
five years, and three after 10
years of service.

union’s bargaining committee,

Mine-Mill Telegrams

Mine-Mill has year after year
passed anti—HUAC resolutions.
Last month, Local 593 and 537
in Buffalo, N.Y. sent telegrams
to Reps. Thaddeus J. Dulski
(D-41st District), Richard D.
McCarthy (D-°9th District), and
Henry P. Smith (R-40th Dis-
trict), urging thgr support for
any move for a’ olition. Local
711 in Erie, Pa. also wired Rep.
Joseph Vigorito (D-Erie Co.).

The telegrams said that the
committee serves no useful pur-
pose, wastes taxpayers’ money,
and harms the nation by violat-

ing due process clauses of the
U. S. Constitution and Bill of

, Rights.

Edward J. Michalski, chair-
man of the political action
committee, Pat Pacile, presi-
dent, and Joseph Scioli, interna-
tional representative, signed the
Local 593 wire. President Walter
Sikora signed the Local 537 tele-
gram. The Local 711 communi-

cation went out over the names,

of William Smith, president, and
Jules Nagy, financial secretary.’

The next vote on HUAC, how-
evergmay well be on the meas-
ure asking appropriations for
the committee. That will be
sometime in the future.

Hubert Ill. |lumphrey——
Best Man to Spur Equality Drive

by Asbury Howard
International Vice-President

YNDON JOHNSON, in his energetic pursuit of equal oppor-
tunity for all, has appointed Vice-President Hubert H. Hum-
phrey as coordinator of the civil rights aspects of the program to
create the “Great Society.” The Vice-President will oversee the

activities of the following agencies: The civil rights division of‘

the Department of Justice, the Civil Rights Commission, the
President’s Committee on Equal Opportunity in Housing, the
Community Relations Service created under the terms of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, the President’s Committee on Equal
Employment Opportunity, and the Equal Employment Commis-
sion, which will be established this year to further implement
the new Civil Rights Act. .
Noting that “Each of these groups has a distinct and im-

portant mission,” the President also pointed out that _duplication””“ S

of effort can be lessened through the selection of a single man t,-
guide the activities of the many groups involved in this area

Why Humphrey? Because he has the qualifications and be- 

cause his record on civil rights legislation is the best of any

man who ever served in the U.S. Senate.

*3»): e 

LECTED to that body for the first time in 1948, his career

there, from that year until he resigned to become- vice-presi- -

dent, pointed up his willingness to back
up his beliefs with action. One of his
first acts in Congress was to advocate the
creation of a permanent bipartisan inter-‘
racial commission on civil rights equipped
with investigatory and subpoena powers.
Also during that first year, he sponsored
legislation to create ‘a joint Congressional
committee on civil rights.

Other legislative proposals offered by
the Minnesota Senator included‘ bills to
create a division on civil rights in the
Department of Justice, to outlaw the poll
tax as a condition for voting in any
primary or general election for national
office, to protect the rights of all citizens to political participation,
including the right to vote, by providing criminal penalties for
anyone who infringes on those rights. He sponsored legislation
to prohibit discrimination in employment because of race, color,
religion, or national origin, and advocated the withholding of

 

Howard

federal funds from states and school districts which failed to '
abide voluntarily by the Supreme Court’s school desegregation

decision of 1954. * * *

UMPHREY attempted all this and more. Many citizens
remember him as majority whip, the smiling Senator from
Minnesota who steered the 1964 Civil Rights Act through the
Senate——with passagecoming only after 83 days of filibuster.
Others recall the unconcealed joy with which he greeted his_
selection as President Johnson’s running mate——a man who then
went on to earn_his nickname of Happy Warrior as he campaigned
across the country. A -- .
Yet I still remember the Vice-President best for the forth-
right speech on civil rights that he delivered at the Democratic
national convention in Philadelphia in 1948—a speech that caused
Eugene (Bull) Conner, then police commissioner of Birmingham,
Ala., and other Southern delegates to walk out of the convention
to form the Dixiecrats (States Rights) party. - ' — « J
“There are those who say to you we are rushing the issue

of civil rights.” Humphrey told the convention delegates in that
year which saw Harry Truman re-elected despite the bolt of the
South. “I say,” Humphrey continued, “we are 172 years late.
There are those who say this issue of civil rights is an infringe-
ment of states rights. The time has arrived for the Democratic
party to get out of the shadow of states rights and walk forth-
rightly into the bright sunshine of human rights.”

smelters, for the first time in history, turned out over one million
tons in 1964. The output of 1,030,614 tons is more than 8 percent
higher than 1963 and 4.5 percent above the previous all-time high
set in 1957. .
Consumption for the last three months of 1964 is expected to

- produce another all-time annual high of 1,180,000 metric tons of

slab zinc, up 60,0000 tons over 1955, the year of the previous record.
The United Nations International Lead and Zinc Study Group esti-
mates, however, that production fell short of consumption, world-
wide, by some 250,000 tons in 1964.

Copper Also Setting Records

Copper production was also at an al1~time high in 1964. Charles

‘ M. Brinckerhoff, chief executive officer of Anaconda Company,
estimates in an American Metal Market report that “Free world

production should reach '. . . 3,950,000 tons, or about 4.5 percent
more than output in 1963.” Brinckerhoff estimated shipments also
would set a record of about 4.1 million tons—8 percent more than

1963—whi1e producers’ stocks should be around 340,000 tons, down,

from about 470,000 at the end of'1963. . .
Anaco-_nda’s own 1964 output is-/3 percent higher than it was
in 1963, and the company has resumed normal shipments to its
customers. For the three months from October through December,
the company had curtained its shipments to customers by 25 per-
cent.
“ The company" announced at the end of December that it would
supply its domestic copper to customers at the U. S. producers’

price of 34 cents, turning over to its own subsidiaries its Chilean- '

produced copper, priced for U. S. consumers at 35 cents a pound.
, ‘Meanwhile, world market prices for copper are dropping. The

'0 London Metal Exchange price is now 431/2 cents, down from the

November peak of 663/3. Part of the explanation for the drop could

The the bill introduced by Senator Mike Mansfield (D., Mont.) to

lend copper producers 100,000 tons of copper from the U. S. gov-
ernment stockpile. In addition, there was an earlier authorization

, for release of 20,000 to-ns from the stockpile to be used for mint-

ing of coins, and this tonnage is about ready for distribution.

Jump in Cerro's Earnings
In spite of the elimination of favorable tax treatment on its

'Peruvian operations and the probable increase of social benefits
« to Peruvian workers under consideration by the Peruvian Con-

gress, Cerro Corporation reports an increase in its 1964 earnings
to $4.50 per share, compared with $2.38 in 1963. The Peruvian
Congress increased the tax on foreign mining companies by 7.45
percent, thus placing taxable mining income on the same basis as
that of other industries in Peru. The terms of the new employee
social benefits being considered are not yet known.

UN Study in Zambia

The copper industry of Zambia came under scrutiny by a

. United Nations Mission last month, at the request of the Zambian

government. In its report, the UN group recommended that the
Zambian government be granted shares in the industry in exchange

"for ‘an ‘agreement that it would refrain from nationalizing the
V copper companies and would limit copper taxes.

The report also urged that, for its part, the industry under-

 take expansion of production, guarantee Africanizing of the labor

r’

 

 

force, and make ‘technical information available. It is proposed
that the Zambian government receive equity shares in the com-
panies in lieu of royalties and taxes.

Push Towards Underwater Mining

Ocean floor mining continues to attract attention. A new
corporation, Ocean Systems, Inc., 65 percent owned by Union Car-
bide and 25 percent by General Precision, has been set up to de-
vise techniques to enable men to withstand underwater pressure
while working and to provide suitable tools and equipment for
underwater work. Capt. R. M. Pitts, general manager of opera-
tions, reported that commercial dives to depths of over 400 feet
are being made routinely and that duration of dives range from
40 minutes to over one hour. The firm may undertake mineral de-
tection and mining. * *‘ * v

Australian Labor Dispute Continues

600 Australian Workers Union members, employed at Mt. Isa
mines, big lead-zinc-copper subsidiary of American Smelting and
Refining in Queensland, shouted. down a meeting January 18 called
by the Queensland Industrial Commission to mediate their five-
month strike. 4,000 workers are involved in the grievance which
began on August 24 over contract mining vs. hourly rates. The
company closed down entirely on November 14, cutting Australia’s
copper supply by two-thirds. ' '

Underground miners had demanded a wage increase of $9
a week and were turned down by the Queensland Industrial Com-
mission. The union refused to accept the turndown and the men
went back to hourly rates. Production dropped by 20 percent, and
the Queensland government issued an order in early December,
following the company shutdown,- directing the miners to resume
working at contract rates. The Commission’s order was denounced
by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which called it indus-
trial conscription, and demanded the withdrawal of the order and
adjustment of the union’s claim for wage increases.

Late in December, the Commission held a rehearing, reversed
its earlier denial, and ordered an increase in wages of $6.75 per
week——s.omewhat less than the union’s demand.

Industrial Commissioner H. J. Harvey chaired a formal con-
ference between the company and the union which opened January
6. . '

The-dispute now goes before the Queensland cabinet. Mean-
while, some -1,200 Mt. Isa employees have left the district.

Case Against Chase Brass Dropped

Excerpts" from a Justice Department motion asking that the
case against Chase Brass, one of 11 corporations indicted in 1962
on charges of price-fixing conspiracy, be dropped:

“The Government’s evidence as to . . . participation in the con-
spiracy relates principally to attendance . . . at meetings . . . in
the years 1956 and 1957 and to telephone communications . . . con-
cerning meetings occurring in subsequent years . . .

“There being no documentary evidence of these meetings and
communications which might serve to refresh the recollection of
witnesses, the Government’s proof as to . . . participation in the
conspiracy . . . would necessarily be dependent upon the unaided
recollection of witnesses whose testimony, from present indica-
tions, can be expected to lack requisite specificity for admissibility
in a criminal prosecution. 1 '

“The Government believes that its evidence . . . has become,
with the passage of time, insufficient to satisfy the criminal law
standard of guilt beyond a resonable doubt.”

Big Year Forseen
For Brass Mills

U. S. brass mills wound up a
big year in 1964 and look for-
ward to even better business in
1965, according to the U.S. De-
partment of Commerce. Ship-
ments of brass mill products in
1964 were up 9.5 percent by
weight over 1963, and up 20
percent in value, reflecting high-
er prices charged for brass mill
production. The profits of big
integrated c o p p e r producers
subsidiaries
were the highest since 1956.
Over 36,000 production workers
were employed in U.S. brass
mills in 1964 compared with 31,-
756 in 1960, and the Commerce
Department s ays production
and jobs at brass mills will
show further increases this year.

Zinc Market

The ’zinc market, already
tight, got even. tighter late last
month with the shutdown for
an indefinite period of the big
Spanish mine, the Riocin in the
Asturias district, which has a
production ranging up to 100,000
tons per year. The shutdown
was caused by collapse of the

Treasury Studying

"Silver Crisis"

Rep. Compton 1. White
(D-Idaho) reported to Congress
that 1942 and 19431 silver-bearing
nickels are being melted down
in Canada for silver solder, a
process cheaper than buying
silver and copper separately
and alloying them. House hear-
ings last year revealed that the
nickels, with silver content
worth 7 cents, were being con-
verted by some U. S. refiners
into miniature bars sold at $2
to $3 an ounce, compared to the
U. S. Treasury Dept.’s value of
$1.29 per ounce. The Depart-
ment is now studying the “sil-
ver crisis” and there is specu-
lation that its report may rec-
ommend a desilvered dime,
with quarters and half-dollars
of a reduced silver content.

(

Marling J. Ankeny, long—time director of the U." S. Bureau of"Mines aiiid a recognized ‘authority in

the field of mine safety, retired at the end of.1964. He had spoken to Mine-Mill's 70th anniversary

convention in Denver in 1963 on the subject ofmine safety. Named as ‘acting director by Interior
Secretary Stewart Udall was Frank C. Memmott, formerly deputy director of the bureau. Memmott,
a former state senator and representative from Carbon County, Utah, has had a varied career in

mining, having worked in the coal, uranium, and op

in New Mexico, andin Arizona
copper mines.

Canadian Union
Testifies
From the testimony submit-
ted to the Mining Committee of

the Ontario le.gislatu»r'e by

IUMMSW (Canada), December

- 10, 1964:

“We propose the establish- _
ment of legislation within the.
"Act (Mining Act of Ontario)

that will compel the setting up

3 of joint safety committees in

which the workers represented

.through their trade unions will

participate. We propose that
such committees shall be em-
powered to make regular safety

V .inspections in all areas working
A _ and concerning all facets of the

industry . . . that such inspec-
tions must lead to vigorous ac-

tion to correct all safety haz-

ards. . These committees
must be empowered to investi-
gate and report upon the causes
of all fatal’ accidents and the
correction of all unsafe prac-
tices and conditions.

“. . . Legislation -for such

-committees does exist in other

provinces and we believe it is
shameful that such has not been
the case in Ontario for many
years. . . . ,

“It has long been our conten-
tion, and we have on numerous
occasions pointed out in one
way or another to the mines
inspection branch or its officers
or to the government itself, that
the practice of men working
alone, particularly underground,
but indeed in any part of this
industry, is both dangerous and
indefensible.
man should be permitted to
work outside of sight and sound
of a fellow workman. We do not
accept management’s argument
that visits to the work place
by supervision once or even
twice a shift is sufficient to
overcome the dangers inherent
in men working alone. ° ' .

“. . .Because of" the hazards
attendant to underground min-
ing, and because of- the unnatu-
ral surroundings of which every-
one is aware, although not
everyone has experienced it,
the question of early retirement
is an immediate one for the en-
tire work force. We propose
that the provincial government
give leadership to the entire
country by enacting a special
agreement with the Federal
Pension Plan calling for retire-
ment at age 60.”

Resolution on Safety

in Great Britain

The British Trades Union
Congress at its last annual meet-
ing adopted a rank and file
resolution calling for establish-
ment by law of factory and
plant safety committees with
delegates
armed with power of inspection.

from the official report of the
Congress: “As the T.U.C. pres-
ident said at the opening Con-
gress: ‘Taking one year with

another, it is fair to say that

for every day’s work lost in
strikes, flVe are lost as a conse-

- quence of accidents.’

“His arithmetic has not been

‘questioned; ‘indeed, one of the

unfortunate factors in the situa-
tion is that nobody is quite sure
of the full extent of industrial
accidents. Last year the Minis-

that many accidents that should

have been notified to factory‘

inspectors by employers had
not, in fact, been notified. Tlye

Award for Lung Damage
‘$110,000 in d a m a ge s was

lung poisoning from beryllium
fumes emitted by the Beryllium

The award was regarded as

Emphysema Increasing

Emphysema, a lung disease,
is increasing sharply. It was
listed as the primary cause of
death in 12,350 death certificates
issued in 1962—up from 1,914
in 1952. The disease was ex-

-ceeded only by heart disease

and schizophrenia, a mental
disorder, as the most frequent
single cause of disability claims
allowed by the Social Security
Administration in 1962.

Causes of emphysemia are not

fully understood as yet by medi-

cal -scientists." It is marked by
difficulty in breathing, with air
sacs in the lungs becoming dis-
tended and the flow of air _to
the lungs becoming obstructed.
Employment in dusty work like
mining, and inhalation of indus-
trial fumes and gases are be-
lieved to be the chief industrial
hazards leading to emphysema.

-ASHINGTON—This column was first to reveal in 1954 the-sf

details of the test‘ fleet’ case in Flint, Mich., for which

Jimmy Hoffa was tried in Nashville, Tenn., in 1963. That trial 

resulted in a hung jury. '

Since then Hoffa has been convictedin Chattanooga (in March "
1964? of obstructing justice at his earlier Nashville trial. This ,-
conviction is now on appeal. The records in the case were filed‘:;;j
this weekbefore the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and-they rea . 5 F‘

  

like a crime thriller.

The records make it appear that the personal vendetta between . 
Bobby ‘Kennedy and Jimmy Hoffa’ went far beyond the realm of 1]
normal- court procedure. Here‘ are some of the sensational facts

these new recordscontain: 1‘

O The government used a dope addict, Edward G. ‘Partin, as" if

its No. 1 witness against Hoffa.

9 Bobby Kennedy’s boys used a double agent, Robert D. A’
Vick, an investigator for one of Hoffa’-s attorneys, who also was

employed by Walter Sheridan, assistant‘ to Bobby Kennedy,-to spy

on --Hoffa’s attorneys. The courts hitherto: have found such espi- -so 

onage illegal.’

O The Justice Department paid money to itslNo. 1 witness. and _i

alimony to his ex-wife. Section 201 of Title 18- of the U. S. Code
states that whoever “.
accepts, receives or agrees to receive anything of value for him-
self for or because of testimony-under oath . . .. shall be ﬁned not

more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years.”--‘"

. -NE affidavit filed in court this-week was signed Sept. 17,: 1964;’, 

six months after the trial and is in the form, of new evidence. w
,-Authorof the affidavit, Sidney Simpson of Baton‘Rouge, was 'hid- 
den from Hoffa’s attorneys at the time of the Chattanooga trial. ;- .

.Simpson~ stated in this new - affidavit that after a? shooting
incident in Baton -Rouge, La., in 1961: Partin asked me to. go to

_his apartment and get the dope out of the apartment. It .Was.; 
strappedunder a table. There were two needles and two bottles. 
One of theobottles, was half full of liquid. I threw the bottles inthei — _j
lake at Our Lady of the Lake Hospital. I put the needles under the 0

back. seat of my mother-‘in-law’s,car, Mrs. Rena Mae Booth. “-
“I went back to the hospital the same day and told Partin’ what

‘I had done with the needles, and Partin told me to get rid of the ' D B
needles, and I called my mother-in-law, Mrs. Booth, and told her.

to get rid of them.”

“Some time in September, 1962,” Simpson stated, “I‘was 1

transferred from the Donaldsville Parish jail to the Baton Rouge

_‘ Parish jail. I was placed in a cell with Partin. For the first few . -.
days Partin acted sort of brave. Then when it was clear that he. 

was not going to get out in a hurry, he became more excited and
nervous. After I had been in the same cell with Partin for about
three days, Partin said, ‘I know a way to get out of here. They
want Hoffa’ more than they want me.’ ”

Simpson then stated that Partin had been released from jail
for daily intervals to confer with a deputy.

“On one occasion I asked Partin if he knew enough about _

Hoffa to be of any help to . . . the FBI, and Partin said, ‘It
doesn’t make any difference. If I don’t ‘know it, I can fix it up.’ ”

. ‘Ar ‘A’ ‘k «
NE sensational development during the Chattanooga trial was

. the shooting up of a house in Baton Rouge owned by .Donice
Bennett, another witness’ at Chattanooga. The incident put Hoffa
in the position of retaliating against a witness.

Regarding this, Simpson stated in his affidavit:

“During ‘the course of the Chattanooga trial, Partin called

from Chattanooga and talked to Lloyd Kinchen. This call came

directly to the union hall. Kinchen told me that Partin had ordered
Kinchen to have me and another boy shoot up Donice Bennett’s

house and tear it up pretty well and shoot up Partin’s father’s. '
