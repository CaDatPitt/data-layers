often were cruel, the cost in human life‘ and happiness
terrible, but the cost was necessary in order to make it
possible for man to emerge out of‘ the near-animal stage,
and rise above the level of brute existence. But the
Roman slave system naturally ceased to serve a useful
purpose in the measure it achieved its mission—and
only a few, of course, were even dimly conscious of the
nature of this mission, however well its ends were
served. In due time corruption set in, and, though
noble and well-meaning men arose to reform the R0-

iman system" (notably the famous Gracchi brothers who

perished in the attempt), it was all in vain, and eventu-
ally the empire fell into utter decay and collapsed.

Out of the ruins and chaos emerged the feudal sys-
tem. Its mission was to bring order out of chaos, to
safeguard what cultural conquests had been made
against the threatening barbaric hordes of the east and
the north, and generally to raise the standards of life
and to introduce greater security, greater stability to
the end of insuring a continued upward development—
a steady progress in education, in the arts, and general
culture, all of which rested on a growing and steadily
expanding commerce, with its accompaniments of set-
tled communities, and the opening up of the rest of th_e
Worldl '

Feudalism, too, went through the successive stages
of lusty youth, maturity, corruption and ﬁnal and utter
decay and collapse. The process of decay was slow,
and, as in the case of the Roman empire, those who
benefited bythe social system—the princes, the nobles
and the ruling class generally——resisted any attempt to
change things socially for the better, with the ‘result that

‘corruption increased, and matters grew from bad-to

worse. The typical example of this process is found in
8

 

 

the case of France. There were men in 18th Century‘
France who realized that an explosion was due unless
something were done. They did not realize, however,
that Feudalism—speciﬁcally the monarchy———was done
for, and that the way of progress inescapably lay over
the ruins of the monarchy, and the feudal structure gen-
erally. And so these would-be reformers of feudalism,
through their attempts to maintain the monarchy—that
is, by their attempted reforms of the feudal system—
merely postponed the inevitable, thereby ‘aggravating
the situation; and, far from preventing the foreshad-
owed revolution, they merely rendered inevitable that
this revolution should become bloody and violent. We
know this violent and bloody revolution now.by the des-
ignation of the Great French Revolution. The American
Revolution of 1776, and the British Revolution of
1.688, were essentially of the same character as the
French Revolution, but quite different in form and
manifestation. vThe reasons for this lie beyond the
scope of this article. But the things to remember are
these:_ The system had reached the end of its normal
development. It could not continue to grow within the
existing legal restrictions and property relations, and
the ruling class that had become useless refused to yield
to, or share power with, the new important class in so-
ciety, the bourgeoisie, or, as we say today, the capital-
ist class. Conciliation was attempted, as were compro-
mises, and special “reforms’.’ were agitated. But in the
end revolution was called in to cut.the Gordian knot.-
And so, eventually, a new system was born, the system
we call capitalism, or, as its current beneficiaries and
apologists like to call it, “the system of free enterprise."
How free it is today, we shall soon discover.

The capitalist system, like its predecessors, _went

9

  

through the familiar stages of growth——lusty youth,
maturity and ripe age, and is now in the last stages of
decay and corruption. The speciﬁc mission‘ of capital-
ism (successfully carried out) has been twofold: To or-
ganize and coordinate production on a basis and scale
insuring forever the elimination of want, and the fear of
want, in society; and, further, to train, to organize co-
operatively, and to coordinate functionally, the working
class, the class destined to supplant all other classes, by
so doing bringing into existence the free, classless So-
cialist society wherein, to paraphrase the old Greek
philosopher, there will be_need for neither servantsnor
slaves, nor room for masters and “bosses.” Scarcity,
inability to produce things in quantities, rendered slav-
ery and poverty necessary for the many, lest all society
remain in the rut of universal poverty, ignorance and
social stagnation. Capitalism’s gift to mankind has been
to make possible mass production, insuring a basis for

universal well-being and prosperity, with freedom for
all.

‘The use of the word ‘’mission’’ is, as already indicated, not to be
construed as implying the foreordrained or predestined. .

Every reform granted by capitalism in C
concealed measure of rcaction.—Da1u'cl
De Leon.

“By their fruits ye shall know them.” So sayeth

St. Matthew. And the fruit which capitalism is _vield--

ing now demonstrates it to be an intolerable evil, a men-
ace to man and all that he has achieved through his
age-long climb out of the abyss of the past.’ Do not tell
us what great things have been accomplished by capi-
talism,.how marvelously it has wrought for us; nor ask
us where we would be but for capitalism. We grant all
the things claimed for capitalism in the past; we know
it has wrought wonders, and we know that but for capi-
talism we should still be grovelling in the dust before
idle aristocrats and insolent feudal autocrats. But the
capitalism which we witness now is no more capitalism
the creator, capitalism the organizer, than a senile,
decrepit and feeble-minded octogenarian is the same
man he was at youth and maturity. Capitalism has long
since reached the stage where it should be utterly de-
stroyed, to' make room for its successor, Socialism. Its
persistent lingering on the stage of history is producing
all the familiar symptoms of decay and corruption.
First, starvation in the midst of plenty; unemployment
and idle machinery, men and machines forcibly kept
apart, yet with a great and tragic need confronting us
of the good and useful thingsthat could be produced by
bringing idle men and idle machines together. Further,
crime, corruption and all the social’ vices known to man

in the past, and many he (lucky fellow!) never knew;

, and ﬁnally the mad slaughter called war—the insane,

purposeless, cruel destruction of millions of human
lives, the systematized destruction of wealth, the Wan-
ton waste of the fruits of man’s ingenuity and painful
lab.or. All this, and more, are the convulsions of a body

stricken with incurable diseases and racked with con-

suming fevers. And yet, there are those who would re-
form, this social system in the expectationof saving and
pireserving it, Among the outstanding reformers of

capitalism in this country stands Franklin D. Roosevelt,-
, President of these United States—united, that is, in

theory, but divided in fact. Divided into classes——the
capitalist class, and the working class; divided in inter-
ests, _socially and economically; divided functionally,
the capitalists merely owning wealth, and the means of
producing wealth, the working class (the overwhelming
majority) producing all the social wealth, yet owning
nothing, or nothing really worth owning. -

r And this is the society which its comparatively few
beneﬁciaries wish to reform—to reform so that it
might, as after a ‘short time it surely would, once again
plunge mankind into the same nameless horror—-—this is
the ‘social system (or, rather anti-social system!) V to

_whose beneﬁciaries Mr. Roosevelt said a few years

ago: “Reformif you would preserve [capitalism]”l
One asks: How much additional proof must be submit-
ted to satisfy these gentlemen that neither capitalism
nor its parasitical beneﬁciaries are capable of being re-
formed, even if it were desirable to reform them? We

know now that not only will efforts prove vain, but they

will prove disastrous. We know now that reforms

c_an.resu«lt only in aggravating the evils besetting us.

Reforms which fail of their object-——as fail they fatedly
must—create disillusionment, ﬁrst in those whom they
are supposed to benefit, and secondly in those who dis-
pense reforms. Wherever reforms of a generally anti-
plutocratic nature have been effected, theiblackest reac-
tion reigns; An outstanding example today is the state
of Wisconsin, reform-ridden by the elder La Follette
and the bogus “Socialist party.” Wisconsin, and par-
ticularly the city of Milwaukee, rank foremost today as
reactionary, labor-hating communities, with an ignor-

_ ant, dull-witted obscurantist for governor. And hand

in hand with disillusionment of the mass, and the rise
of the “man on horseback,” go violence——sometimes vi-
olence by the disillusioned and bitterly disappointed
mass, but more often by the ruthless dictator——petty
or otherwise——-who usually is himself a disillusioned re-

former, a disappointed Stalinist or Social Democrat, or’

a bankrupt Liberal. And We may Well say thatvjust as
reforms in our day are concealed measures of reaction,
so reformers are potential reactionary despots, dealing
out violence to those for whose welfare their hearts
once bled so profusely! From reform to bayonets, that
is the formula, the latter the nearly always inescapable
result of the former. \

\Proof of this abounds on every hand at this period
of extreme capitalist reaction. One of the recent, and

.most‘ convincing and impressive, proofs is that supplied

through the crushing, by federal troops, of the strike
at the North American Aviation Company at Ingle-
Wood, California. The facts concerning the strike-and
the questions involved are now generally known. The
men demanded that the minimum wage of 50 cents per
hour be increased to 75 cents per hour, and that all em-
ployees receive a blanket increase of IO cents an hour.

The company had been given defense orders amounting
to $200,000,000, hence huge profits were assured. Un-
der any circumstances the demands of the workers were
modest——_alm—ost humiliatingly so. Yet, a howl was set
up by the jackal press, obviously inspired by the corpo-
ration.whose president, Jas. H. Kindelberger, sneering-
ly said (according to a report by the New York news-
paper PM, June I0, 1941) that “he felt 50 cents was
enough for those young punks who W-ould only buy gas
to run around in their jalopies and take their girl
friends out over the weekend.” -

The insolence of this labor-exploiter places ‘the dis-
pute in proper perspective. The parasite Kindelberger
thinks 50 cents per hour sufficient for competent work-
ers, and he reviles these useful workers by calling them
“young punks.” President Roosevelt and his adminis-

, tration has been praised for its alleged “pro-labor”

stand. Here, then, would seem to be presented a glo-
rious opportunity for that great Democrat, the labor-
loving Mr. Roosevelt, to step in and say something like
this: “Here, that will do, Kindelberger. You are in
America, and not in Nazi Germany. A minimum wage
of 75 cents per hour is low enough in all conscience.
Grant the demands of your workers, or else.” But did
the Great Reformer, the “most pro-labor President in
American history” (to quote Mr. Arthur Krock of the
New York Times, June I I, I941)---did the Great Hu-
manitarian do this? He did not. But his Secretary of
War, Mr. Stimson, issued a statement in which the plu-
tocratic exploiter, Kindelberger, was warmly praised
(PM editorial, June I0, 1941 ). And when the workers
stood ﬁrm, refusing to toil for less than 75 cents per
hour, labor’s great friend in the White House sent his
strong-arm squad, the United States Army, to compel

I4

 

 

thesworkers to accept the terms of their exploiters.
Logic,.and that great love forlabor, should naturally
have prompted Mr. Roosevelt to have removed Kindel-
berger and his gang from their posts of authority, per-
haps jailed them, or possibly used them for bayonet-
drilling purposes. But no, the Great Reformer sent the
army, of which he is commander-in-chief, which arrived
at the scene of conflict, the troops being, wrote the New
York Times reporter, “in full marching equipment,
steel helmets in place, riﬂes loaded and bayonets ﬁxed.”
The Times reporter adds that the troops “were not
smiling.” No, the tr-oops “were not smiling”——they
were there on grim and possibly bloody business. War
had been declared—violent class war had broken out
between the plutocratic exploiters and their wage slaves,
with the army, the governmentand the jackal press
lined up on the side of the exploiters of the aviation
corporation. And there was bloody business. A picket
captain with quaint notions about the right of freemen
to strike, to take all legitimate steps to insure a success-
ful strike—this naive citizen whose vote is said to count
as much as the President’s—did not move fast enough
to suit one of Mr. Roosevelt’s storm troopers, who
therefore bayoneted this striking worker. And all this
by order of the Great Humanitarian, the incomparable
reformer, the labor'-loving occupant of the White
House. “From reform to bayonets”——there we have it.

Arthur Krock wrote in the New York Times that
“It is ironical that the most pro-labor President in
American history should have been forced to such mea-
sures. . . .” (New York Times, June I 1, 1941.) Mr.
Krock errs—it is not ironical, it is logical that Mr.
Roosevelt should have done what he did. For, once
again, reforms in a revolutionary period inescapably

rs

   
 
  
  
 
 
 
    

breed reaction, and the reformer under ruling class
pressure, or in rushing to the defense of the capitalist
system, discards the velvet gl-ove of benevolence, re-
vealing underneath the mailed list of despotism—eco-
nomic despotism. In a’ grave crisis produced byV'cap'i-
talism, there is no room for half measures or compro-
mises. There is no choice presented——-it is either all

f-or the capitalist class, or all for the working class. And‘

since the chief aim and objective of the reformer is to
reform capitalism in order to preserve it, it is natural

that he should ﬂy to the support of the human embodi-

ment of the capitalist system, namely, the capitalist ex-
ploiter.

From “Reform to Bayonetsl’—qu.od emf demon-
strandum. The proof is established!

There are a. thousand hacking at the
branches of evil to one who is striking at
the root.—Hem-y D. Thoreau.

The Inglewood strike is, of course, neither the ‘first
of its kind, nor is it likely to remain the last. Allover
the country strikes are taking place, and with few ex-
ceptions the cause has been the same——the natural de-
sire, as well as the desperate need, on the part of the
workers to secure a larger share of the immense wealth
produced by labor alone. Prodded, on the one hand,
by rising living costs, and, on the other, by the spectacle
of huge proﬁts being pocketed by the parasitical ex-
ploiters, and with vivid memories of the many lean
years that preceded the present “boom,” nothing could
be more natural than that strikes should take place. The
attitude of the exploiters, of their spokesmen, of the
government and allies, including the contemptible labor
fakers, reduces to mockery the boast that this is truly a
democracy. Yet, facts have been published proving the
complete justification for the demands of the workers
even from the viewpoint of the capitalist reformer.
The President himself (weeks after the bayoneting of
the Inglewood workers) made this signiﬁcant admis-
sion in his message of July 30, 1941, on price control
plans:

“Increases in the workers’ cost of living, on the
one hand, and excessive proﬁts for the manufacturer,
on the other, lead to spiraling demands for higher
Wages. This means friction between employer and em-
ployed.” (Italics mine.) - I ’ »  '

From Reform to Bayonet:
By Arnold Petersen’

The New Deal hegira from Reform to
Bayonets shocked, but did not surprise, the
S.L.P. It was not “ironiical” that a re-
form President should employ the mailed I
ﬁst to break lalbor’s, resistance; it 'was‘ logi-
cal. This is a. revolutionary era and ‘re-

for the working class. ‘And’ since the chief

form capitalism in order topreserve it, it
is natural that he should ﬂy to the support
of the human embodiment of the capitalist
system, namely, the capitalist exploiter.”

How‘ the “great Humanitarian” follows
the well-«worn path of other reformers be-'
fore him is related in this document. It
is more than an indictment of the New
Deal; it is an indictment of a social sys-
«tem which can no longer maintain toler-
a'ble conditions for the slave within his
slavery.

And yet,-in that same message, the President lec-
tures the workers on the need of exercising restraint in
demanding wage increases. “Labor,” he said, “has
far more to gain from price stability than from abnor-
mal wage increases.” (ll) And again he said in that
message: “But labor as a whole will fare best from a
labor policy [l] which recognizes that wages in the de-
fense industries should not substantially exceed the
prevailing wage rates in comparable non-defense in-
dustries where fair  labor policies have been main-
tained.” One wonders what that labor policy may be.
With his annual salary of $75,000, it is scarcely likely
that Mr. Roosevelt has had to operate under a “labor
policy” which presumably regulates wages! Nor is it
to be assumed that the President’s personal experi-
ence supplies him with a guide, or a proper norm! Re-
ﬂecting on the President’s salary, and the lecturing he
so thoughtfully and unctuously administers to the
workers, one irresistibly is reminded of an observation
by his immortal predecessor, Abraham Lincoln. ' Said

Lincoln :

“An honest laborer digs coal at about seventy
cents a day, while the President digs abstractions at
about seventy dollars a day. The coal is clearly worth
more than the abstractions, and yet what a monstrous
inequality in the prices.”

Well said, honest old Abe—but will your successor ,

see the point?

Throughout all the contentions, pleadings and the
cajoleries of the politicians and the editorial apologists
for capitalist interests, there are sounded two distinct
notes: One says that, although the supply and demand
give labor the upper hand (temporarily, and so long

18

 

 

as bayonets are not jabbed into the quivering ﬂesh of
the worker), the workers must not take advantage of
the favorable “labor market.” (Note that—thel“labor
market,” where labor is bought and sold, as cattle are
bought and sold in the cattle market.) Yet, in ‘hard
times, when the worker is a drug in the market, he is
told that it is just too bad, but—the “law of supply
and demand,” you know! Indeed, it was no less a
Prince of Finance than the late John Pierpont Morgan
who gave classical expression to this typical attitude of
exploiterdom. When asked in I914 by a government

_ committee—-

“Do you consider ten dollars a week enough for a
longshoreman with a family to support?”—John P.
(“Corsair”) Morgan answered:

“If that’s all he can get, and he takes it, I should
say it’s enough.”!!

The other note says that, since increased wages
mean higher prices (which in fact they do not), it is
really foolish for the workers to ask for higher wages.
Just a case of biting off your nose to spite your face,
you see! The President himself leads off with the false
claim that high wages cause high prices, although this
crude notion has been exploded again and again. In
his message on inflation Mr. Roosevelt said:

“Of course there cannot be price stability if labor
costs rise abnormally.”

The ‘New York Times (May 17, 1941) editorially
whines about “the spiral of wages,” concluding on
this note:

“Where will this process [wage demands] _lcad
to? Will it lead to a spiral of wage" advances that

19

  
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
  

either bring about an upward spiral in the cost of liv-
ing, or reduce private margins to the point where pri-
vate industry cannot function?” i

let us console ourselves with the thought that the lat-
ter may be the answer!

As said, the theory that increased wages cause in-
creased prices has been exploded again and again. It
is absurdly false, as an investigation of the history of
prices and wages abundantly reveals. And when the
capitalist apologist does not happen to be howling
- -against strikes, and denouncing the workers’ demands
for higher wages, he (the capitalist spokesman)
frankly states the facts and tells the truth. In view
of the claim of the New York Times, just quoted, it is
of interest to recall that that plutocratic paper, during
the two or three years that preceded thestarting of
the first world war, devoted columns upon columns to
lengthy and detailed articles establishing conclusively
that high wages did not result in high prices. But let
us ‘take a couple of recent capitalist depositions to that
effect. In the July issue of the’ monthly bulletin pub-
lished by the huge National City Bank of New York
"(surely not a pro-labor journal!) we find the follow-
ing: '

“. . . .In every industry we see signs of vigorous
competition which has steadily reduced prices and
raised the quality of the products——and all in the face
of the great advances in wages paid to workers and
reduction in working hours.” ' '

if ‘ , Could anything be more specific or to the point?

Let us now turn to the New York Times of Au-
‘ . 20

 

As in the nature of things it cannot be the former,

 

gust 3, 194.1. In the ﬁnancial section one of the ﬁnan-
cial experts writes:

“Earnings of the steel industry before providing
Federal income‘ and excess-proﬁt taxes and reserves
for other contingencies in the second quarter of I941
were 18.7 per cent higher than in the ﬁrst quarter,
despite an increase of IO cents -an hour in wages on
April I, which lifted the average pay about II per
cent over the first quarter.”

This last proof should particularly console the
Times in its grave concern for‘ the poor’ “private en-e
terpriser,” allegedly being ‘driven into bankruptcy as a
result of having to pay higher wages! The simple fact
is that the increased productivity of labor enables the
capitalist to pay higher wages (if he must do so, and
he will assuredly not do so unless compelled), at the
same time stimulating the tendency toward lower prices
which, normally, result fromsthe lower value of com-
modities brought about by the increased productivity
of labor. a

The law of’ capitalism decrees, and all the politi-
cians, editorial writers, and their capitalist masters
agree, that the workers should be paid merely ’a living
wage. It was the Great Reformer himself, Mr.
Roosevelt, who phrased this ideal in.alluring terms
when, at Block Island, R.I., on September 4, 1937, he
said:

“There has been’, and continues to be, urgent need
to insure all able-bodied working men and women a
living wage for a fair day’s work. I repeat what I

said in my message to the workers of the United

States last year: ‘The wage-earners of America do

.not ask for more. They will not be satisﬁed with less.’ ”

21

  

In other words, the worker is to receive just enough
food, shelter and clothing———no more and no less——to
maintain himself and to reproduce his kind. That is
the grand endeavor and noble ideal of the labor-loving
reformer—that is the very crown! of labor’s emancipa-
tion! A living wage? Why, the horse gets a “living
wage,” no more and no less! Come to think of it. a
living wage is the slave’s “wage”! It was another of
Mr. Roosevelt’s predecessors in the White House who

’ correctly deﬁned a “living wage” as the slave’s pittance.

    

John Adams, second President of the United States
(happily ignorant of thefact that the thing he con-
demned would be warmly praised by the thirty-second
President of the United States), said:

“When the workers are paid in return for their la-
bor only as much money as will buy the necessaries of
life, their condition is identical with that of the slave.”

Thus we see that the prospect held up before the
worker is the prospect of a contented slaVe’s existence.
This is what the reformers promise the worker——this is
the happy lot they award him! From reform to bay-
onets—-—-from reform to stark reaction, to intensiﬁed
slavery! And when we look across the sea to Nazi Ger-
many we witness, in a mirror, as it were, the picture of
the stage toward which the reaction is straining. For
Nazi Germany (which is capitalism gone to seed) pre-
sents the picture of a working class in economic serf-
dom, in a feudo-industrial state, resting on bayonets.
And it is well to recall that no country in the world was
one-half so reform-ridden as was pre-Nazi Germany.
The German Social Democrats experimented with re-
forms on the German workers, as a scientist experi-
ments with rats and guinea pigs in his laboratory! On

22

 

their reform planks they rose to power—and instant-
ly turned bayonets against the German workers as the
Roosevelt-commanded army turned bayonets . against
the workers in California on June 9, 1941. But for the
Social Democratic reform madness, a Hitler might
never have arisen in Germany. Or, if he had arisen, a
thoroughly informed working class, organized on cor-
rect lines, with the Socialist revolution as its clearly out-
lined goal, and means and methods adopted in keeping
with that goal—such a working class would have dis-
posed of the mountebank and madman in short order,

‘together with the reactionary interests behind him. In

a stronger, in a more terribly real sense, Nazi Germany
today stands as the living proof that reform in a revo-

‘ luti-onary age inescapably leads to the rule of the bay-

onet. For—- '

“Where a social revolution is pending, and, for
whatever reason, is not accomplished, reaction is the al-

ternative.’’
an

The great lesson to be learned by the working class
is that reforms are the steps which fatedly lead to abso-
lute serfdom. Hence, that the reformer—whether pol-
itician, “labor leader,” or cleric———must be shunned by
labor, as one would shun the very pestilence! .The
workers, accordingly, must discard the banner of re-
form which on one side bears the legend “A fair day’s
wage,”-while the other side portrays a working class,
reform-doped, dragooned, and held in complete sub-
jection by bayonets. Instead, the workers should, and
surely will, in the words of Karl Marx, “inscribe on
their banner the revolutionary watchword, ‘Abolition
of the wage system.’ ” Socialist Industrial Unionism,

23

   

"and civilized, political action, based ‘on the principles

and program of the Socialist Labor Party, proclaim at
once» the goal and the means to reach the goal. Re-
membering that reform eventually must lead to bay-
o'n‘ets, let our motto be: '

Away with reforms and reformers! Away with
bayonets and the rule of bayonets and machine guns!

. ‘Forward, now and forever, the Socialist Industrial
Republic of Enlightened, Affluent and Free Labor!

(The End.)

FROM REFORM To GALLOWS.

Revolutions triumphed, whenever they
did triumph, by asserting thermelves and
marching straight upon their goal. On the
other -hand, the fate of Wat Tyler ever is
the fate of reform. The rebels, in this in-
stance, were weak enough to. allow them-
selves to .be wheedled into placing their

movement into the hands of Richard II, -

who promised “relief"—and brought it by
marching the men to the gallows.
—Dam'el De Leon.

[.?This brilliant editorial by Daniel De Leon, the great
American Socialist scholar, published ﬁrst in the Daily
People, August 2, 19-13, deﬁnitely and authoritatively lays
down t-he position of the revolutionary Socialist movement
with respect to reforms and so-called immediate demands.
A careful distinction is made «by De Leon between imme-
diate demands of a political party, and the demands for
increased wages, etc., instinctively and naturally made on
- the economic ﬁeld by the workers, through their unions]

A correspondent argues that——- , . ‘

Whereas, the true political party of the workers
must come through the workers, organized on the in-
dustrial field; and

Whereas, a political party so organized will reflect
in its political platform the demands made on the indus-
trial ﬁeld; and . i ’

Whereas, before the ﬁnal -overthrow of capitalism,
which is the constant demand, there will be more imme-
diate demands——shorter hours, higher wages, better
.conditions, etc., etc.——

Does it not follow that this political party will and
must have an immediate demand platform? No, it
does n-ot follow.

The reasoning that, until the “constant” demand of
labor, the overthrow of capitalism, is attained, “imme-
diate” demands are bound to appear on the platform
of the true political party of labor proceeds from a con-
fusion of the term “demand” as used in the two in-
stances.

Theoverthrow of capitalism——that is a DEMAND
——-it is THE demand—it belongsin the platform of a
true political party of labor. ‘

Shorter hours—Io instead of 12, or 8 instead of
Io——when really and ultimately the hours will be nearer
to 3 than to 8; higher wages, which mean less exploita-
tion, when really and ultimately wageism is to be abol-
ished; a minimum of sanitary Ventilation in factories,
when really and ultimately the factory is to cease being
a hole and is to become a parlor; these and the like are
not “demands.” T They are intermediary stepping

stones, to be discarded as soon as possible in the onward

march. They have no place in the platform.

This is not an instance of a “distinction without a
difference,” or of “splitting of hairs,” or of “substitut-
ing a different word for the same thing,” a process
which, in fact, changes nothing. It is a difference that
goes to the root of things. '

The test between “demands” and “non.-demands,”
however desirable the latter may be, is that the latter
are included in the former, as a matter of course. This
feature of desirable, but temporary, steps places them
under the category, in point of principle and of tactics,
distinct from the categoryiof “demands.”

An army that takes the ﬁeld against a city has that‘

city for its “demand.” The setting up of tents, digging
of trenches, providing for sanitation, etc., etc.——these
are not “demands.” These are means toward the “de-
mand”; and these means will vary according to circum-
stances, hence, need not be enumerated.

The “demand” is.ONE——-it is the proclamation of
the goal. The so-called “immediate” demandsare le-
gion. The speciﬁcation of them, or of any of them, is
superﬂuous.

28

 

 

The importance -of the distinction lies in its practical
bearing. ~
' The moment things that are not in the nature of a
“demand,” because they are not the goal, are raised to
the dignity of a “demand,” they are apt to be, and gen-
erally are, confused with the goal itself. A political

‘party that sets up “immediate” demands by so much

blurs its “constant” demand, or goal. The presence of
“immediate” demands in a, Socialist platform reveals
pure and simple politicianism——corruption, or the invi-
tation to corruption. - ‘

Only the economic organization may and must reach
out after crumbs——“improved conditions”-—on its way
to emancipation. The very nature of the organization
preserves it from the danger of “resting satisfied,” of
accepting “improvement” for “goal.” The economic or-
ganization is forced by economic laws to realize it can
preserve no “improvement” unless it marches onward
to. emancipation. _

Otherwise with the political organization. It must
be “whole hog or none.” The very nature of its exis-
tence—itself only a path-clearer for the economic or-
ganization, and only a temporary means———renders the
political organization prone to “rest satisfied" with in-
cidentals and'“impr»ovements.”

There is‘ no danger of the true political party of
Socialism, that is, the party that ﬂows from classcon-
scious unions, dragging behind it the navel-string of
“immediate demands”———as well imagine a Declaration
‘if Independence with “immediate demands.”

Revolution means transmu-tation, and a revolution is,
accordingly, accomplished whenever. . ..an entirely new
principle is substituted for what is already in effect. A
reform, on the other hand, is effected in case the exist-
ing situation is maintained in point of principle, but
with a [supposedly] more humane....working out of
this principle.—Ferdin.and Lassalle.

A great deal of useless oratory has been emitted on
the supposed eﬁicacy and virtue of reform as a means
of righting the wrongs of our age, and more volumi-
nous still has been the chorus of indignation and horror
directed at those who have suggested that revolution
alone can bring peace, order and equity into this
troubled world, with “redress to all mankind.” Back
of this oratory and these denunciations lies the notion
that in the last analysis there is a free and independent
choice left us. Nothing could be more fallacious. Whiie
man certainly can, and does, inﬂuence the course of
events, and while he is far from being an utterly help-
less creature who mechanically carries on toward sup-
posed predestined ends, the fact remains that in the
long run, and, at the last, he is a creature of circum-
stance. Within certain limits he can move more or less
at will, but, given a particular social set-up, he has no
choice as to the general direction. He may retard or
accelerate tendencies and social trends, but he cannot
decree the removal of these tendencies at his pleasure.
The reason is obvious: Man makes his own history, but
the material» of which he makes it is that which he finds
immediately at hand. Whatever man dreams or plans

3

  

must have its roots in existing reality. The past may
inspire him and guide him, but itcan do no more; and
he can borrow nothing from the future, for to the fu-
ture everything is contributed. Man, in his greed or ig-
norance, may even succeed temporarily in putting the
social motor in reverse.——to strike the road back to the
dead, evil past. But once an economic or material fact
or factor is established, the ideas born of it can never be
destroyed. Destroy every machine invented by man,
destroy every outward manifestation of man’s prog-
ress, yet it would be impossible to destroy the knowl-
edge, the images, of these machines and of the progress
attained. It is as much beyond the power of man to do
this, as it is beyond his power to project social and eco-
nomic facts and forces arbitrarily. .
Reforms natura11y_imply belief»in the usefulness, or

iindispensability, of the thing to be reformed. A gar-

 

ment may be renovated or repaired over and over
again, but the point is eventually reached when the ef-
fort and cost of repair exceed the replacement cost of
the garment. To continue to repair must eventually,
and inevitably, lead to the direct opposite result of that
at which the process of repairing was aimed. It ceases
to be economical to do so, and the garment is discarded.
However, to continue to repair a worn-out garment is
no more foolish and wasteful than would be the dis-
carding of the garment while it is still serviceable and
worth repairing. To repeat: To continue to “reform”
thegarment when the stage of “reform” has passed is
as’ fatuous and destructive as would be the premature
“revolutionary” act of throwing away a perfectly ser-
viceable and useful garment.

As with a garment; so with social systems and social
organizations, except, of course, that the latter involve

4-

 

 

questions far more complex, and, as said, inﬁnitely fur-
ther removed from the arbitrary will and whims of
man. Social systems in the past served useful purposes,
or they could not have endured so long, assuming, that
is, that they could have appeared at all. And, as with
earlier social systems, so with the present capitalist sys-
tem. As in the case of a garment, a social system may
develop defects which demand “repairs,” i.e., reforms.
If the social system, however imperfect, is serving the
needs of man better than any other which is possible or
conceivable at the time, common sense dictates that its
curable defects be reformed. Necessity and enlight-
ened self-interest generally operate toward effecting the
indicated reforms, though there may be some who
(through ignorance or unenlightened selﬁshness) would
oppose reforms. But when experience, and the obvious
facts in the case, prove that reforms no longer operate
to produce the desired results, the advocacy of reforms,
and the attempts made to keep alive artiﬁcially that
which should be allowed to die a natural death, become
foolish and eventually socially criminal. Those who
seek to prevent the inevitable, or at any rate the social-
ly needed change, constitute the undesirable and reac-
tionary element in society, whereas those who seek to,
further the revolution—i.e., the substitution of a new
and sound principle for the diametrically opposed pre-
vailing unsound principle—represent the useful, the de-
sirable element. At least, a truly sane, a genuinely ra-
tional society, would so appraise them. _But in a society
where private property interests dominate, and where
classes contend for supremacy, the verdict is quite dif-
ferent. In such a society (the present capitalist society,
for instance) those who would retain the worn-out so-
cial “garment,” at a tremendous cost to humanity, be-

5

 
 

 

come the “pillars of society," the patriots; and those
who would cast away the worn-out “rags” (to use Mark
Twain’s phrase‘) are denounced as" enemies of society,
as “subversive elements,” and with similar false non-
sense. Those who consciously, and out of selﬁsh class
interests, oppose the change which so greatly would
benefit society as ‘a whole are generally rewarded as if
they were really the benefactors of mankind, seeing that
they enjoy prestige and wealth, whereas the real bene-
factors of society and the true friends of mankind, are
reviled and generally suffer penury and persecution.

1“My kind of loyalty was loyalty to one’s country, not to its institu-
tions or its office-holders. The country is the real thing, the substantial
thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch over, and care for, and
be loyal =to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing and
clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to
protect the body from winter, disease, and death. To be loyal to rags, to
shout for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags-—that is a loyalty of un-
reason, it is pure a-nimal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented by man-
archy; let monarchy keep it "-Mark Twain.

Where a social revolution is pending and, for whatever
reason, is not accomplished, reaction is the alterna-
tive.—Dam'el De Leon.

Someone may say: Granted that all this is true,
how do we know that this is the hour of revolution?
How do we know that reforms are no longer possible
or desirable? VVe know this, first, because it is capable
of scientific demonstration. We also know it for the
same reason that a tree is known by its fruit. Society
is an organism, and it reacts to artiﬁcial promptings, or
artiﬁcial restraints, as do all organisms. Human so-
ciety is a living thing, a growing thing. Its roots are_in
the sub-soil of the past, its topmost branches straining
toward the sky of the future. Social systems are born,
grow and mature, and eventually decay. During the
ethnic period when class has contended against class;
when private property rights for the few at the expense
of the many have prevailed; and where slavery in one
form or another has existed, social systems have come
and gone. The system typiﬁed in the ancient Roman em-
pire came into existence out of the dim past. As it grew
in size and power, it scattered its seeds over the then
known world. Its mission had been to pull society out
of the morass of equality in poverty and ignorance. A
‘vast slave class was the basis of this society—a slave
class which made it possible for the few to enjoy the
leisure and freedom of action which enabled them to
acquire learning, to develop culture, and to insure the
spreading ofthis civilization far and wide. The means
