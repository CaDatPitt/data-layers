but the great capitalists. Nazi fascism, in its government as
well as in its economic system, constitutes the rulership of the
most reactionary sections of monopoly capital. What the Nazis
have done is not to place the middle class in political power,
but to strengthen enormously the grip of the great capitalists
on the state by smashing the trade unions, cooperatives, and
workers’ and liberal parties, and by eliminating the toilers’
representatives from all sections of the government. Under the
Nazi regime, as never before, the big bankers, industrialists
and landlords have a free hand in ruling the country. They
have greatly centralized the state and tightened their grip
upon it. Their system is state capitalism raised to the maxi-
mum. In person or through their agents, the great capitalists
occupy all the key positions in the Nazi party, the state, the
army, the industries, the press, the state trade unions, the
schools, and every other important social institution, and they
make full use of their control to advance their own interests.
The exiling of the big capitalist Fritz Thyssen by Hitler, an
event upon which Roosevelt and others base their assertions
that the capitalists have been expropriated and displaced by
the Nazis, was simply the result of a gang quarrel among the
great capitalists themselves over the advisability of the Soviet-
German non-aggression pact.

The Nazi Party is the party of the big businessmen, on the
same principle, if not in the exact form, that the Democratic

 

and Republican Parties are the parties of big business in the _

United States. Hitler is the instrument of the great capitalists,

‘ not their master. The big monopolists ﬁnanced the rise of the

Nazis to power and they are now in full control of the Nazi
regime. The Nazi leaders who were not capitalists at the out-
set have since enriched themselves on a large scale (as their
fascist friends have also done in Italy). Many of the Nazi
moguls have grabbed vast properties, Goering now being one
of the biggest capitalists in Germany. What wealth Hitler him-
self has amassed is being kept a state secret. Undoubtedly

10

anticipating the eventual collapse of Nazi Germany, the

Nazi leaders have also made huge investments abroad. The
weekly magazine Friday (April 18, 1941) gives the following
ﬁgures regarding these people’s ﬁnancial holdings in the
United States and Latin America: Joseph Goebbels, $4,635,000;
Rudolph Hess, $473,000 (plus $1,000,000 in Switzerland);
Heinrich Himmler, $2,000,000; Joachim Von Ribbentrop,
$3,165,000; Hermann Goering, $2,oo0,0oo.”“

Diﬁerent Modes of Production

just as the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany differ funda-

—mentally in the vital matters of which social classes own the

industries and control the government, so also they differ in
their respective basic modes of production. The Soviet Union
operates upon the socialist principle of production for use:
that is to say, production is carefully planned, carried out and
distributed upon the basis of the needs of the people. Whereas
Nazi Germany operates itsiindustries and agriculture upon the
familiar capitalist principle of production for proﬁt, as we
have in this country; that is, goods are produced only if they
can be sold proﬁtably, regardless of the masses’ real wants. The

Soviet production for use creates a sound national economy,

but the "Nazi production for proﬁt results in a rotten“ eco-
nomic system, essentially like that of the United States and
England.

In the Soviet Union, with no proﬁt grabbers to rob them,
the toilers receive the full value of what they produce, minus
only what is necessary to operate the government, to develop
industry and to maintain the social insurances. Consequently,
there being a balance between the producing and consuming
powers of the workers and other toilers, there are no unsalable
surpluses, no problem of securing markets. Production and

consumption stimulate each other and both rapidly increase.
In the U.S.S.R., there can be no starvation in the midst of
plenty, such as we see in all capitalist countries. Under the
Soviets the question of_unemployment has been permanently
solved, and likewise the disaster of recurring industrial crises.
During the whole period of the recent great world economic
crisis which paralyzed every capitalist country the. Soviet
economy went steadily and rapidly ahead without any de-
pressionu Because of its fundamental soundness, based upon
the socialization of the means of production, the abolition of
human exploitation, production upon the basis of the people’s
needs and its planned character—Soviet economy has made the
fastest progress in the whole history of man. Capitalism, even
in its best days, cannot compare with the U.S.S.R. in the speed
and scientiﬁc character of its industrial development. Thus, in
the period from 1917 to 1936, while industrial production in
the capitalist world increased at the rate of only 11/2 per cent
yearly, that of the U.S.S.R. leaped ahead at the rapid speed of

‘ 28 per cent annually.*

In contrast with the healthy, growing Soviet industrial
system, the economy of Nazi Germany displays the basic weak-
nesses and sicknesses characteristic of capitalist countries gen-
erally (including the United States) and in aggravated forms.
Its system of production for proﬁt operates even more dis-
astrously than the same system does in other capitalist coun-
tries, because of the lack of organization and democratic rights
by the workers, with resultant greater exploitation of those
masses. With the increase of German industrial eﬁiciency the
fatal gap between the producing power and consuming power
of the masses constantly widens. The inevitable results are the
characteristic clogging of markets, industrial shut—downs, mass
unemployment and industrial stagnation inseparable from all
capitalist economies. Fascist apologists brazenly lie when they
say that Hitler (or Mussolini) has abolished mass unemploy-

G ment and industrial crises. The fascists have only temporarily

obscured these incurable diseases of capitalism by their present
wholesale production of munitions and the gearing of the
nation’s whole economy to the waging of war. Only by carry-
ing on the horrible trade of organized massslaughter can the
Nazis keep their industries going, even for the time being. This
is true also of American and British capitalism. When the
present war is over Nazi German economy, like the capitalist
economy in other countries, will experience the most devastat-
ing industrial crisis and mass unemployment in its history.
The Soviet system creates an economy of abundance. Auto-
matically, the more the workers produce the higher the real
wages they receive for their labor. Their consumption of com-
modities keeps pace with their increased producing power.
Consequently, as Soviet economy makes its unparalleled ad-
vance, so do the living standards of the masses. No other coun-
try can or does systematically plan the material welfare of its
people. In all capitalist countries, prior to this war, the num-
ber of employed workers had been stagnant or declining,
whereas in the Soviet Union their number increased from
11,600,000 in 1928 to 30,400,000 in 1940. The U.S.S.R. also is

the only country in the world where the living standards of the 6

people are rising, and at a rate never equaled anywhere under
capitalist conditions. The average wages of Soviet workers
jumped up from 1,566 rubles in 1933 to 3,467 in 1938; the
national payroll increased from 56,0o0,000,o00 rubles in 1935
to 175,000,0o0,000 in 1941; retail sales increased from 15,000,-
000,0o0 rubles in 1929 to 174,000,000 in 1940, and government

appropriations for the Soviet system of social security increased '

from 10,0o0,000,o00 rubles in 1937 to 16,oo0,000,000 in 1941.
The tempo of this improvement of the people’s material con-
ditions constantly speeds up as industry expands and develops.

In Nazi Germany, on the other hand, the prevailing proﬁt
system creates the economy of scarcity characteristic of capital-
ism in all countries. While the German capitalists continue to

13

pile up their ill—gotten wealth, the living standards of the con-
stantly more exploited toiling masses rapidly fall. The Ger—
man toilets (and the Italians, too) have suffered a deterioration
of at least 25 per cent in their real wages since fascism came to
power. Their work week has been increased from 48 to 60 and
70 hours and their shop conditions have been greatly worsened.
Their old age, sick and unemployment insurances have been
slashed. Restriction of useful production is the policy of the
Nazi regime, as it is that of Roosevelt and of monopoly capital
in the United States. Fascist spokesmen attempt to glorify the
spreading mass pauperization. “Cannons, not butter,” cried
Goering, the Nazi industrial overlord. “We are against the
easy life,’’ says Mussolini. In the United States the fascist
Lawrence Dennis, in his book The Dynamics of War and Revo-
lution, says “An economy of easy abundance would create no
spiritual values to give life dignity and meaning.” Lewis
Mumford, in his Faith for Living (pp. 311-13), demands “a
transfer of loyalty from an economics of comfort to an eco-
nomics of sacriﬁce.” And now we hear the same gospel of
sacriﬁces and hardships being preached by Roosevelt, Wallace,
Hoover, Willkie, et al.

Socialism Is for Peace; Fascism for War

In no sphere does the fundamental difference between social-
ism and fascism stand out clearer than in the vital matter of
peace and war. In Nazi Germany the monopoly capitalists, the
organizers of imperialist war, reign supreme. Their economic
system, plagued with “overproduction,” industrial crisis and
mass unemployment, can only be kept going upon the basis
of a war economy. Their greed for proﬁts, prosecuted vigor-
ously in all corners of the earth, brings them into violent
collisions with other imperialist states. They seek the solution
of all their problems—economic breakdown, mass discontent
and international rivalries——through war. Fascism is war.

14‘

 

Recognizing the logic of this situation, the fascists every-
where systematically glorify imperialism and war. They pic-
ture human mass slaughter as the greatest aim of mankind, the
measure of all social progress. Mussolini says (Doctrine of
Fascism, pp. 43-44): “Fascism sees in the imperialistic spirit-
z'.e., in the tendency for nations to expand——a manifestation of
their vitality. . . . War alone brings to their maximum tension
all human energies and stamps the seal of nobility on-those
people who have the virtue to face it.” Hitler said (Dec. 9,
1930), “In the long run the sword will decide everything.”
Fascist youth are taught that their greatest ambition should be
to die in imperialistic war. Fascist countries and fascist groups
everywhere are distinguished by their ultra-chauvinistic na-
tionalism and warlike character. Hitler’s so—called new world
order, could he set it up, would be only a jangling collection
of mutually hostile and antagonistic states, kept together by
armed force and holding before the world an endless prospect
of ever more brutal and devastating war.

Since the ﬁrst days of his seizure of power in Germany Hitler
has proceeded upon a policy of war. With the help of the
British tories, who hoped that he would turn his growing
power against the Soviet Union, Hitler militarized the whole
German nation. In building up his tremendous armed force,
he has reorganized the entire economy of Germany upon a war
basis. No less important to his war policy, Hitler broke up
the organizations of the peace-loving, democratic masses of the
people, thereby giving the big capitalist imperialists a free
hand to prosecute their warlike program. Hitler’s policy of
aggression and war ﬁnds its logical culmination in Germany's
present violent clash with the militant imperialist Anglo-
American alliance and in his bid for world conquest. His whole
policy is basically akin to that of the so-called “democratic”
capitalist’ states—-England, France and the United States-
whose Versailles and Munich policies led to the outbreak of
the present war.

15

   
 

In total contrast to the warlike character of Nazis fascism
and of world capitalism generally stands the peace policy of
Soviet socialism. The Soviet economic system does not require
the violent stimulant of war in order to keep going. On the
contrary, with production and distribution balanced and with
no unsalable surpluses clamoring for outlets in foreign mar-
kets, the Soviet economy imperatively needs a regime of peace
for its development. The peace policy of socialism is rooted
in its economic system. This peace policy is further fortiﬁed
by the fact that the great capitalists, the makers of modern war,
have been long since totally defeated in the U.S.S.R. and the
full political power resides in the hands of the democratic and
peace-loving toiling masses. Socialist workers and farmers, who
hold the power in the U.S.S.R., have no interest in exploiting
the peoples of foreign lands; hence they have no urge to war.
Whereas fascism is impelled along a policy of war, as are Eng-
land and the United States, by the very nature of its funda-
mental economic and political structure, the whole make-up
of socialism. commits the latter irresistibly to a policy of peace.
While Nazism has no other perspective than war, Soviet so-
cialism seeks to live in harmonious economic and political
relations with all other countries. Socialism is the bearer of
world peace. Mankind will ﬁnd in an eventual world federa-
tion of socialist countries the ﬁnal end of war.

In accordance with the nature of its socialist economic and
political system, the Soviet Union, ever since its foundation,
has: conducted a ceaseless struggle for world peace. Born in the
ﬁght of the Russian masses against World War I, one of the
ﬁrst oﬂicial acts of the newly-born Soviet Government was a
call to the people of the world to put an end to that suicidal
imperialist war. Soviet inﬂuence ever afterward has also been
constantly exerted on the side of peace. Repeatedly the
U.S.S.R. proposed the complete or partial disarmament of all
countries; it also followed the policy of making non-aggression
pacts with the capitalist states; and it was the world leader of

16~

 

 

 

 

the “collective security” plan to restrain the war aggressor
states by an international peace front of all the democratic
peoples. In the present imperialist World War II the Soviet
Government, true to its basic peace policy, maintains an atti-
tude of neutrality, and of preventing the spread of the war,
despite constant efforts by both sides to involve it in the ruin-
ous struggle. American newspaper talk about the Soviet’s for-
eign policy being an “enigma” is sheer nonsense. On the con-
trary, it is quite clear and always has been ‘so. Desiring peace
ardently, the Soviet Government fought resolutely to keep
peace in the world; and then, when this effort failed and the
imperialist wolves went to war, .the Soviet Government
adopted a determined policy of keeping itself out of the
slaughter that it had worked so hard to prevent. There is
nothing enigmatic about such a consistent policy of peace.

The U.S.S.R. has built up powerful armed forces, but these
are for defense, not for preying upon other peoples. There is
no such thing as “red imperialism,” nor can there be, because
in the Soviet Union there is no monopoly capitalism, the foun-
tainhead of imperialism. It is absurd to characterize as impe-
rialism the active assistance given by the U.S.S.R. to the at-
tacked peoples of Spain and China, or to condemn as impe-
rialism the peaceful joining to the U.S.S.R. of the peoples of
Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Eastern Poland and Bessarabia,
a federation which was carried out with their overwhelming
consent. And as for Finland, the Soviet Government would
have been able peacefully to settle with the Finnish people
the boundary changes necessary forthe safety of Leningrad,
had it not been that British, French and American imperialists
interfered with the negotiations, in the hope that their
machinations would result in the long-planned general capital-
ist war against the U.S.S.R. '

Germany, England, France, Japan, Italy, the United States
—all the leading capitalist powers—are following imperialist
war policies, and for basically identical reasons. They are

17

   
 

seeking to redivide the world among themselves for the beneﬁt
of their ruling capitalist classes. The only major state pursuing
a peace policy is the socialist Soviet Union. The charge that
the U.S.S.R. is an ally of the Axis powers has long since been
exploded as a deliberate lie of the Anglo-American imperial-
ists and their Social-Democratic agents, who want the U.S.S.R.
to pull chestnuts out of the ﬁre for them. The Soviet peace
policy harmonizes profoundly not only with the most basic
interests of the Soviet people, but also with those of the toiling
masses of all countries. To the U.S.S.R. therefore, the peoples
of the world are looking increasingly for leadership in their
efforts to establish a just, -democratic and lasting peace at the
end of this criminal war. I

Soviet Democracy vs. Fascist Dictatorship

As in all other respects, Soviet socialism and Nazi fascism
diﬂ"er fundamentally on the question of democracy, both in
theory and practice.

“Proletarian democracy,” said Lenin in 1918, ”is a million
times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy; the
Soviet Government is a million times ‘more democratic than
the most democratic bourgeois republic.” *

Stalin, speaking on the new Soviet Constitution, at the time
it was being adopted, said:

(

‘. . . Democracy in capitalist countries where there are an-
tagonistic classes is in the last analysis the democracy for the
strong, democracy for the propertied minority. Democracy in
the U.S.S.R., on the contrary, is democracy for. all.” ”“*

In his famous pamphlet Mastering Bolshevism Stalin, in the
spirit of Soviet democracy, said:

"“ The Proletarian Revolution and Renegade Kautsky, International
Publishers, New York, p. 30.
“Stalin on the New Soviet Constitution, International Publishers,
New York, 1937, p. 23.
18

 

 

“We must pay careful attention to the voice of the masses,
to the voice of the rank-and-ﬁle members of the Party, to the
voice of the so-called ‘small men,’ to the voice of the people.”""

These democratic principles are fully realized in the life of
the Soviet state, The people are guaranteed incomparably the
most. extensive rights of any nation in the world, _including
the rights of suffrage, speech, organization and conscience, the
right to work, of recreation, of full education, of social security,
of racial equality, of sex equality, etc. The Stalin Constitution
is by far the most democratic in the world. Contradicting the
current anti-Soviet slanders, an impartial witness, Professor
john McMurray of the University of London,‘ says in his book
Creative Society:

“Communis1n is both in theory, and in the substantial, eco-
nomic side in practice, democratic. . . . In the real sense, Soviet
Russia is already far more democratic a society than any other
has ever been.”

As against the profoundly democratic character of Soviet
society, the Nazi regime is altogether autocratic. Nazi propa-
ganda is saturated with contempt for the masses and adulation
for their so-called natural rulers of the people, the “elite,” or
“leaders.” This fascist “elite” is in reality nothing more than
the organized gang of agents of the most reactionary sections
of ﬁnance capital, who, at the moment, ﬁnd themselves in
power. The Nazi program calls for all power to the “leader.”
Hitler declared at the 1935 Nazi Congress that “The fuehrer
is the party and the party is the fuehrer”; and in his book
Mein Kampf (p. 520), he stated also that the National-Socialist
Party “must not be the servant of the mass, but its master.”
Mussolini’s writings are crowded with similar autocratic senti-

ments, and in this country the Nazi echo, Lawrence Dennis,
states in his/Dynamics of War and Revolution (p. viii), “let
me say categorically that I do not believe in democracy or the
intelligence of the masses.” The Nazi regime is organized from
top to bottom around such anti-democratic principles, and the
masses of the people are utterly deprived of all democratic
rights. '

Contrary to those who try to lump fascism and socialism
together, the fascist dictatorship of Nazi Germany has nothing
in common with the proletarian dictatorship of the U.S.S.R.

At the Seventh World Congress of the Communist Interna-
tional Georgi Dimitroff said correctly, “fascism in power is the
open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chau-
vinistic and imperialistic elements of ﬁnance capital.” It is
naked, autocratic domination by the biggest capitalists over
the toiling masses, who have been robbed of all parliamentary
democracy, and who have had their trade unions, political
parties, cooperatives and other democratic mass organizations
ruthlessly broken up. In the United States we can see the same
autocratic trend developing in the reactionary policies of the
big capitalists and their political agents. The Nazi one-party
system represents the suppression, of all the political organiza-
tions of the working class and petty bourgeoisie by the domi-
nant big capitalists. A

The proletarian dictatorship, so named by Karl Marx almost
100 years ago, on the contrary, is the rule of the toiling masses.
In the U.S.S.R. dictatorship of the proletariat constitutes a
temporary form of the socialist society adopted for that period
in which it is still necessary for the victorious workers and
farmers to hold in check the remnants of the former ruling
classesand also to defend themselves from the external capital-
ist enemy states. The Soviet regime, however, is heading to-

ward a stateless society. The one-party system of the U.S.S.R.,

opposite to the situation in Nazi Germany, signiﬁes and ex-

 

presses the victory of the toiling classes. On this point, in the

20

 

pamphlet Stalin on the New Soviet Constitution (pp. 22-23),
Stalin says:

 . . several parties and consequently freedom of parties can
only exist in a society where antagonistic classes exist whose
interests are hostile and irreconcilable, where there are capital-
ists and workers, landlords and peasants, kulaks and poor
peasants. '

“But in the U.S.S.R. there are no longer such classes as
capitalists, landlords, kulaks, etc. In the U.S.S.R. there are
only two classes, workers and peasants, whose interests not only
are not antagonistic but, on the contrary, amicable. Conse-
quently, there are no grounds for the existence of several par-
ties, and therefore for the existence of freedom for such parties
in the U.S.S.R. There are grounds for only one party, the
Communist Party, in the U.S.S.R. Only one party can exist,
the Communist Party, which boldly defends the interests of the
workers and peasants to the very end.”

The anti—democratic character of Nazi fascism, originating
in the reactionary nature of monopoly capitalism and impe-
rialism, is further demonstrated by its monstrous racial
theories. With its ' ridiculously unscientiﬁc contention of
Nordic superiority, it seeks to make all other peoples slaves
to the German capitalist class. Fruits of this barbarous racial-
ism are the ferocious and distorted fascist nationalism, its sav-
age anti-Semitism, its sneers at neighboring nations and its
blazing contempt for Negroes and all colonial peoples. Similar
tendencies are also evidenced in American and British impe-
rialism. Contrary to all such uncivilized racial doctrines of
superiority and God-chosen master peoples, the Soviet Union
is based upon the democratic, internationalist, scientiﬁc Marx-
ist principles of the equality and solidarity of a1l~the races and
nations of the earth. Within the Soviet Union's own borders
its many constituent peoples live together in harmony and
equality. It is the one great country in which anti-Semitism is

21

 

punishable as a crime. The Soviet Constitution (Article 123)
says (and this clause is strictly applied):

“Equality of rights of citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of
their nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state,
cultural, social and political life, is an indefeasible law.

“Any direct or indirect restriction of the rights of, or, con-
versely, any establishment of direct or indirect privileges for,
citizens on account of their race or nationality, as well as any
advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness or hatred and con-
tempt, is punishable by law.”

In industry, as in politics and other spheres, the Nazis apply
their “leadership” principle, to the exclusion of all democracy.
The employers are the autocratic “leaders” in the shops and
factories and the workers have nothing to say about setting
their wages and workingconditionsf It is the open shop carried
to the maximum. The so-called German Labor Front is only a
monster company union, but more degenerated and employer-
controlled than anything we have ever had in the United
States. Hitler tries to justify this monstrous tyranny thus:
(cited by R. Palme Dutt in Fascism and Social Revolution,

p. 214).

“The employers have worked their way up to the top by
their industry and their elﬁciency. And by virtue of this
selection, which shows that they belong to a higher type, they
have the right to lead. Every leader of industry will forbid

any interference,” from the workers.

In contrast with this system of Nazi industrial slavery the
workers in the U.S.S.R. enjoy an industrial freedom utterly
unknown in any other country. Their great trade unions, now
numbering 25,500,000 members, not only actively look after
questions of hours, wages, working conditions, etc., but they
also have charge of the gigantic social security system, they
play, furthermore,'a vital rolein organizing production, and

22

\

 

from their ranks come the tens of thousands of managers of
industry and political leaders. The great democratic trade
unions are the massfoundation of Soviet democracy. Com-'
pared with them, the Nazi Labor Front is a ghastly mockery,
and such unions as our A. F. of L. and C.I.O. are but skeleton
organizations, both in size and function. V

The working class and peasant woman is especially a victim
of the brutal Nazi dictatorship. She has no democratic rights
and is reduced to an inferior status, economically, politically
and socially. The Nazi aim is to make her into just a breeder
of industrial slaves and soldiers for the capitalist ruling class.
She is excluded from political life and is denied a higher edu~
cation. Long ago Spengler, from whom the Nazis have copied
much, said (Years of Decision): “Woman is to be neither com-
rade, nor beloved, but only mother.” In this thoroughly re-
actionary spirit Hitler, at the 1934 Nazi Congress, outlined the
status of women under German fascism, as follows:

“The world of man is the state, the world of man is his
struggle, his self-dedication to the community, and thus we
may say that the world of woman is a smaller one. For her
world is her husband, her family, her children and her house.
. . . We do not believe it to be right for woman to penetrate
into the world of man, into his special sphere; on the‘ con-
trary, we feel that it is natural for "these worlds to remain
separated.”

The Soviet woman, contrary to all this fascist reactionism,
enjoys the fullest equality. One of the greatest achievements of
the Russian revolution was to strike the shackles from doubly
enslaved womankind. The Soviet Constitution (Article 122)
provides that: “Women in the U.S.S.R. are accorded equal
rights with men in all spheres of economic, state, cultural,
social and political life.” Accordingly, Soviet women are to the
forefront in all activities. In the Supreme Soviet, of 1,090 dele-
gates 187 are women, as against no women in the German

23

 

 

Reichstag, and only half a dozen in the United States Congress.
In Soviet industry the 11,000,000 employed women get the
same wages as men doing similar jobs; they work in all occu-
pations, many of them being factory and farm managers,
locomotive drivers, ship captains, surgeons, scientists, etc.;
there are 100,000 women industrial engineers in the U.S.S.R.,
as against 10,000 in the rest of‘ the world. In 1938, women
numbered 43 per cent of the students in the universities of the
Soviet Union and 66,000 physicians, or 60 per cent of the grand
total in the U.S.S.R., were women. In her home life the Soviet
woman is also surrounded by protections and freedoms, quite
unknown in any other country. Small wonder that the birth
rate in the U.S.S.R. is more than double that of either Ger-
many, England, or the United States.

Nazis and other fascists shout a great deal about the youth
and about what fascism has to offer the new generation. But
this is all a monstrous lie. The reality is that in Nazi Ger-
many, as in all other capitalist countries, the way is barred to
a real life for young people. The German industries, the gov-
ernment, the educational system and all other vital social in-
stitutions, based on human exploitation and saturated with
crisis and rottenness, are ﬁrmly in the grip of thebig capitalists
and their agents. The only real opportunity open before the
great masses of proletarian and farmer youth in Nazi Germany
is to perish on the ﬁeld of battle, and this is now opened also
as a future for the youth of the United States. The Soviet

- Union, on the other hand, is truly the land of the youth. Every

line of social endeavor—industrial, political, cultural—is wide
open and clamoring for the youth. In the Supreme Soviet, of
the 1,090 delegates 596 are under 35 years of age. This situation
is typical of every phase of Soviet life. In no country in world
history has the youth blossomed as now in the U.S.S.R. Fascism
teaches young people to die and drives them into mass
slaughter; socialism shows them the way to live and provides
them the means for so doing.

Soviet Culture; Nazi Barbarism

As the world capitalist system, caught in the meshes of its
own incurable crisis, strangles and smothers, so also its culture
withers and dies. Under fascist regimes, which arose where the
capitalist crisis reached a very acute stage, the decay of capital-
ist culture is the most pronounced. In fascist Germany educa-
tion is decadent, science is in decline, and the arts are stultiﬁed.
The whole educational apparatus-—universities, colleges,
schools, etc.—has been drastically curtailed. The only science
the fascists are interested in is that which advances their war
technique, and the same tendency is growing in all other
capitalist states. The Nazis have a supreme contempt for
the popular mind. All they seek is the most effective means to
deceive the people into obeying their autocratic commands.
Hitler says in Mein Kampf (p. 198), “The receptivity of the

masses is very limited; their ability to understand small.” Only ‘

the restricted, so-called elite (the ruling capitalist clique) can
appreciate or absorb culture. As for the masses, says Hitler,

“the primitive simplicity of their minds renders them a more b

easy prey to.a big lie than a small one.” On this basis he feeds
them the most outrageous demagogy. In the conquered coun-
tries Nazi “culture” reaches its lowest depths of degradation.

The burning of the books, the persecution of such outstand-
ing scientists as Einstein, the resurrection of astrology, Nordic
heathen god worship and other forms of medieval obscuran-
tism, are typical indicators of the cultural barbarism that the
Nazis are trying to inﬂict upon the world. This barbarism is
fully in harmony with their ruthless exploitation of the work-
ers inindustry, their suppression of every trace of democracy,
and their brutal slaughter of the people as cannon fodder in
imperialist military adventures. It is all part of the decaying
capitalist system, including that of the United States. Goering’s
famous slogan should be extended to read: “Cannons, not
butter or education.”

At the other extreme, the Soviet Union represents the pro-
gressive cultural tendency. In that country, in full harmony
with its socialization of industry, its abolition of human ex-
ploitation and its development of the broadest democracy,
there also exists the most intense promotion of culture in all
its forms. The economic and political structure of the U.S.S.R.
is healthy and progressive and so, too, naturally, is its culture.
The whole country is involved in a mass cultural advance such
as the world has never before witnessed. Science, literature,
art——every form of culture—is expanding at an unheard-of rate.
Superstition and ignorance of all sorts are being systematically
combatted. And this culture is not being restricted to a small
ruling, exploiting “elite,” but is extended to the broadest
masses of the people, regardless of their national background.

One of the most striking aspects of the great Soviet cultural
renaissance is the tremendous development of mass education.

' The illiteracy of tsarist times, embracing nearly 75 per cent of

the people, has now been almost wiped out. In 1913 Russia
had but 859 newspapers, which printed only 2,700,000 copies;
the U.S.S.R. in 1940, however, had 8,500 newspapers, with a
total circulation of 38,000,000 copies. Today in the U.S.S.R.
there are some 40,000,000 pupils in the primary and secondary
school grades, as against only about 8,000,000 before the revo-
lution. The Soviet universities and technical schools contain
650,000 students, or about as many as all the rest of Europe
put together. InForez'gn Affairs for January, 1941 (pp.‘433-
4?i4)1, Walter Kaempflfert, a hostile critic of Soviet life, says that
w 1 e

“The Germans have closed most of their universities; . . .
For 1942 the [Soviet] plans call for thirty—four times as many
students in various Russian [higher] schools as there were
before the revolution.”

The Soviet state has set for itself the unparalleled taskof
raising the educational level of the workers to that - of the
intellectuals. Says Stalin regarding this revolutionary program:

 . . The elimination of the distinction between mental
labor and manual labor can be brought about only by raising
the cultural and technical level of the working class to the
level of engineers and technical workers. It would be absurd
to think that this is unfeasible. It is entirely feasible under
the Soviet system, where the productive forces of the country
have been freed from the fetters of capitalism, where labor has
been freed from the yoke of exploitation, where the working
class is in power, and where the younger generation of the
working class has every opportunity of obtaining an adequate
technical education.” (Speech at the First All-Union Confer-
ence of Stakhanovites, Nov. 17, 193 5.)

Another tremendous task now being gradually accomplished
by the vast Soviet cultural renaissance is to raise the cultural
level of the country population up to that of the cities. Ernst
Fischer says in his pamphlet What Is Socz'alz'sm* (p. 54),

“But it is not only the borderline between the worker and
the intellectual, between manual and mental labor that so-
cialism removes and obliterates; it sets out to efface the age-old
distinction betweenitown and country, to overcome the im-
memorial backwardness of the countryside.”

To this end mighty educational work is now going on among
the millions of collective farmers. Every Soviet village is surg-
ing with the new intellectual life brought to it by the growing
educational system, by the expanding industrialization, and by
the never sleeping care of the Soviet state.

Under Nazi fascism, as under capitalism generally, the in-
dividual worker and farmer -is reduced to a mere cog in the
great capitalist machine which operates to make wealth for
the ruling class and to wage war against other nations. His
personality is warped and stunted, and he passes through life
robbed of its potential beauties and richness. In the Soviet
Union, on the other hand, where there is no ruling, exploiting

class, the whole aim of the regime is to develop and expand

‘the toilers’ freedom and personality. Capitalism, especially in

its fascist aspects, corrodes and destroys human personality;
socialism develops personality to its utmost. In the Soviet

. Union there is literally a new type of man in the making, not

only in the economic and political sense, but also with regard
to his physical, mental and individual characteristics.

Fascism and Socialism ‘in the United States

The foregoing analysis of Nazi fascism and Soviet socialism
shows deﬁnitely that they constitute two basically different
types of society. Fascism, with its private ownership of indus-
try, monopolist dominated government, production for proﬁt,
imperialist war-making, anti-democracy, and cultural barbar-
ism, is capitalism in its most ruthless form. Whereas Soviet so-
cialism, with its collective ownership of the industries and the
land, worker-farmer government, production for use, broad
democracy and cultural progress, represents a new and higher
order of society. The former is obsolete, moribund capitalism,
and the latter is the developing higher world system that hu-
manity is entering, socialism. Nor can all the pen pushers and
paid liars of capitalism, in their eagerness to discredit social-
ism and to defend capitalism, obscure this profound opposite-
ness of the social systems of Nazi Germany and the Soviet
Union.

The wide gulf between fascism and socialism is clearly seen
when we consider these movements in terms of the American
situation. Let us indicate brieﬂy the opposite origins, goals
and trends of fascist-minded reaction in this country on one
hand and of the Communist Party on the other. In the United
States, as in Germany, the fascist danger originates among the
great capitalists. Wall Street is the breeding place of Ameri-
can fascism, and the Hearsts, Coughlins, Lindberghs, Peglers,
McFaddens, etc., are the mouthpieces of big capital. The great

g8

 

monopolists, Morgans, du Ponts, Fords, Girdlers, Weirs, etc,,
are now dominating the Roosevelt Administration and shap-
ing its policies, but they at least are partially restrained by the
resistance of the organized workers, farmers and city middle
class. If the monopolists could break this opposition they
would then proceed systematically to destroy what we have left
of parliamentary democracy, nationally and in the states, and
would set up a dictator on the Hitler model; they would
smash the A. F. of L., the C.I.O. and all other democratic
organizations of the people and enormously increase the ex-
ploitation of the workers and farmers; they would create a
powerful Gestapo with some Martin Dies at the head of it;

they would strew the country with concentration camps and ‘

jam them with anti—fascist elements; they would increase even
the present gigantic militarization of the country and would
embark upon an endless perspective of imperialist war. In
short, as we can see clearly from their present-day activities, if
the Wall Street moguls, fountainheads of American fascism,
were able to overcome popular resistance and to have their
complete way they would create a terroristic fascist regime in
this country similar in all essentials to that now prevailing in
Nazi Germany. The Fords, Girdlers, du Ponts and Weirs of
the United States are the blood brothers of the Hitlers, Goer-
ings and Schachts of Germany. I

On the other hand, the present program and daily activities
of the Communist,Party prove that it aims at creating a totally
different kind of an America. While striving now to raise the
workers’ wages and unemployed relief under capitalism, it is
eventually aiming at the socialization of the industries and the
land and the abolition of human exploitation altogether. Every
worker would have a job as his constitutional right. Today
the Communist Party defends the democratic rights of the
people and urges the formation of a great Farmer-Labor Party
in order better to carry on this defense, and it at the same time
looks forward eventually-toward securing a government com~

COMM UNISM VERSUS
FASCISM r

A Reply to Those VVho Lump Together the
Social Systems of the Soviet Union
and Nazi Germany

BY WILLIAM Z. FOSTER

The Confusing Together of Communism and Fascism '

IN APPROACHIN G this general question it is necessary to
make two deﬁnitions. First, the present social order in the
U.S.S.R. is not communism, but socialism, which is only the
ﬁrst stage of communism. Hence, instead of the word commu-
nism, as applying to the present system in the Soviet Union
we will hereinafter use the correct term, socialism. Second, we
have to bear deﬁnitely in mind that the fascist regime now in
effect in Nazi Germany is not a new social order, but capital-
ism. The real issue, therefore, as presented by the Soviet and
Nazi regimes is socialism versus capitalism, and it is in this
sense that it is dealt with throughout this pamphlet.

The different social systems of the Soviet Union and Nazi
Germany represent the opposite poles of modern society in
their economic structure, their forms of political government,
their class composition, their foreign policies, their culture and

pletely in the hands of the workers and farmers. The Commu-
nists also strive to strengthen the trade unions and other mass
organizations, and would eventually build them into the basic
organizations of the new social order. The Communists are
opposed to imperialist militarization and war, and they would
ﬁnally put an end to these monstrosities and establish a world
at peace. This program realized, in broad outline, would be
socialism. It would be no mere replica of Soviet socialism, but
would be adapted to speciﬁc American conditions. Its fruits
would be peace, freedom, prosperity and cultural development
for the people; instead of the war, slavery, hunger and bar-
barism that are the inevitable results of fascism. Socialism and
fascism constitute two different worlds. '

The lumping together of Nazi fascism and Soviet socialism
by the capitalists and their lickspittle agents in the press, on
the radio, among the trade union leadership, etc., is triply
dangerous to the American people. In the ﬁrst place, it tends
to prevent the workers and other toilers in this country from
understanding the tremendous progressive signiﬁcance to them
of the socialist development that is now taking place in the
Soviet Union, in relation to the basic solution of their own
problems of unemployment, poverty, oppression and war. Sec-
ond, it tends to drive a wedge between the peoples of the
Soviet Union and those of the United States and to prevent
the vital peace collaboration between those two peace-loving
nations. Third, the confusing together of fascism and social-
ism tends to blind the American people to their main enemies,
the capitalists of this country. These reactionaries, by direct-
ingtheir campaign against the Soviet Union and "the Com-
munist Party, thus divert attention from their own schemes to
enslave the workers and other toilers of the United States.

Red-baiting is the tactic of the capitalist reactionaries,
whether it is practiced by labor leaders, “liberals,” or what not.
It is the method by which Hitler and Mussolini came to power
and it is the one whereby American'reactionaries are step by

step seeking to wipe out democracy and to’ setup their own
brand of fascism in this country. Their dangerous success in
this direction is seen in the reactionary course of the Roosevelt
Administration. Under cover of an attack upon the Soviet
Union and the Communist Party the red baiters assault. every-
thing genuinely progressive and feed the ﬂames of war hysteria.
Should they be able to break up the Communist Party; which
stands in the front line of every battle for the people’s rights,
it would not be long before the trade unions, the farmers’
organizations, and all other democratic movements of the
masses would confront a life and death struggle. -That’s the
way fascism seized power in Germany, Italy, France and other
fascist countries and that’s how "the reactionaries want it to
“happen” here. _

To possess a clear picture of what is actually taking place
now in the Soviet Union, so as not to be fooled by the lie
that “Nazi fascism and Soviet socialism are the same,” is of
the most fundamental importance to the American workers
and other toilers. Only if they have such an understanding
can they fight effectively for American and world peace, defend
their vital economic and political standards, and eventually
ﬁnd in socialism the ﬁnal solution of the increasing menace
of fascism, hunger and war that is being bred by the obsolete

and rotting capitalist system.

their outlook upon life generally. The socialism of the U.S.S.R.
is the beginning of a new world system, whereas Nazi fascism
is the most reactionary expression of the dying capitalist world
order.

The fundamental difference between socialism and fascism
(which is capitalism) is the most signiﬁcant political fact of
our times. This oppositeness in the make-up and policies of
the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany (also of fascist Italy),
would seem to be so obvious as to be unmistakable. Yet there
is now to be seen on all sides the fantastic spectacle of a de-
termined attempt to convince the toiling masses in the United
States and other capitalist countries that “Soviet socialism and
Nazi fascism are essentially the same.” Some capitalistic writers
even insolently assert that Soviet socialism gave birth to
fascism. All of which constitutes the most brazen political
distortion in history.

The systematic lumping together of Soviet socialism and
Nazi fascism as “totalitarian dictatorships” originates in capi-
talist circles and is ‘assiduously propagated by their innumer-
able mouthpieces and agents. Semi-literate “poll—tax Congress-
men,” wise-cracking radio commentators, slippery newspaper
columnists, and other spokesmen for capitalism glibly spout
forth this grotesque identiﬁcation of socialism and fascism and
with an air of ﬁnality as though it were “revealed Bible truth.”
Conservative trade union leaders sing the same song of con-
fusion; similarly various liberal (sic!) scribblers assert that
“the Soviet Union is a fascist state,” and the several brands of
Social-Democrats-—Thomasites, Waldmanites, Trotskyites, etc.
——blather about “Communazis.”

This remarkable ideological campaign to confuse socialism
and fascism together under one head has its roots in the capi-
talists’ fear for the safety of their world capitalist system, which
obviously is in deep crisis. The ﬁrst and major objective the
capitalists and their mouthpieces are aiming at by this cam-
paign is to discredit socialism, which they fear as the nemesis

s

 

of their own outworn system. Realizing that the masses have a
deep hatred of fascism, they try to direct this hatred against
the socialist system of the Soviet Union by ,-alleging it to be
“the same” as the fascism of Nazi Germany. The second aim
of the capitalists’ campaign of confusing socialism with fascism
is to free their own social system from the stench of -fascism.
They would have the people believethat Nazism is a reaction-
ary growth independent of capitalism. They argue that Hitler’s
fascism, so hated by the American people, originated because
the capitalist system in Germany was overthrown by a middle
class revolution. By this means the capitalists in the United
States and other countries hope to hide from the workers and

_ the farmers the fact that the big bankers and industrialists

are striving to transform what is left of bourgeois “democracy”
into open reactionary dictatorship according to the Hitler
pattern. ,

The present World War II has given a sharp stimulus to the
campaign to tar the Soviet Union with the fascist brush. The
Hearsts, Peglers, Dennises, Greens, Coughlins, Hillmans,
Thomases, Waldmans, Utleys, Coreys, Lovestones, Burnhams
and similar elements, who draw their ideology from capitalist
sources, are now insisting more stridently than ever that the
U.S.S.R., like Nazi Germany, is a fascist, totalitarian state. The
reason for this intensiﬁed falsiﬁcation at present is that, as the
warring imperialist powers shoot each other to pieces and the
already deadly sick capitalist system becomes still further
weakened, the capitalists and their agents become more and
more alarmed, especially so when they observe the Soviet
Union, intelligently standing apart from the war and daily in-
creasing its strength and prestige. The worse the position of
world capitalism and the stronger that of the Soviet Union,
the more desperately the capitalists try to discredit the U.S.S.R.
among the masses by smearing it with charges of fascism and
totalitarianism.

These detractors of socialism and defenders of capitalism

5

follow the Hitlerian formula that they can make people be-
lieve any lie, provided it is big enough and they keep hammer-
ing away at it. For the most part they conﬁne themselves to
generalities, reiterating ceaselessly their central theme that
Nazi fascism and Soviet socialism are identical. In this pam-
phlet, therefore, it will be the aim to look beneath these gen-
eralities; to make clear to open-minded workers that Nazi
fascism is capitalism, rotten and reactionary; and that Soviet
socialism is a totally different type of society, healthy and
progressive.

Who Owns the Industries?

The foundation difference between socialism and fascism
(capitalism) is the fact that in a socialist system the industries
and the land are owned collectively by the people; whereas
under fascism these social means of production and distribu-
tion are owned privately. The widely differing political and
cultural superstructures of the two forrﬁs of society, as well as
their contrary political directions, develop out of their basical-
ly different systems of ownership of the industries and the land.

In the Soviet Union, which is a socialist country, the indus-
tries and the land are the property of the people, and are
operated solely with the objective of improving the people’s
condition. There are no private capitalists or landowners what-
soever to exploit the toiling masses. There are neither rich nor
destitute in the U.S.S.R. The very essence of the Russian Revo-
lution of 1917 was the transfer of the ownership of the social
means of production and distribution from a private to a col-
lective basis by the revolutionary action of the masses, carrying
with it the abolition of human exploitation. Section 1, Article
4, of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. states the economic basis
of the country as follows:

“The socialist system of economy and the socialist ownership
of the means and instruments of production ﬁrmly established
as a result of the abolition of the capitalist system of economy,

a

 

the abrogation of private ownership of the means and instru-
ments of production and the abolition of the exploitation of
man by man, constitute the economic foundation of the
U.S.S.R."

Nazi Germany, on the contrary, has a capitalist economy,

the same in all fundamentals as that of the United States,’

England, France and other capitalist countries. The bulk of
the wealth of the country is in the hands of a few people. The
industries, as before the Hitler regime, remain privately
owned. A small clique hold as their personal property the great
banks, factories, mines, etc., and systematically use this owner-
ship to rob the German people. In the New Masses, Feb. 11,
1941, G. S. Jackson showed that in the year 1938 the proﬁts
of the ﬁfteen largest industrial concerns in Germany aver-
aged 7.7 per cent, as against 5.6 per cent for the ﬁfteen biggest
American corporations. *

The only important change Hitler brought about regarding
the ownership of the industries was to strengthen enormously
the position of the great monopolists by more active govern-
ment intervention in their interest in the shape of state sub-
sidies, favorable taxation, repression of the workers, etc. Now,
after the advent of Hitler, the German monopolists far more
completely dominate the industries at the-expense of the work-
ing class, the peasantry, and the small merchants and manu-
facturers. The land, too, in Nazi Germany is privately owned,
with the big landlords steadily increasing their holdings and
power. The same general situation exists in Italy. Under the
Nazi fascist regime in Germany the big business elements in
industry (and also in agriculture) -are eating up the smaller
ones and are securing complete control of the nation's
economy. Thus the situation in Germany is just the reverse of

what it is in the U.S.S.R. There has been no revolution in
Germany (or in Italy). Despite all the current allegations of
capitalist-minded American politicians, hack newspaper
writers, phoney political economists of the Burnham, Thomas,
Corey type, and conservative labor leaders to the contrary not-
withstanding, Hitler has not collectivized the industries or the
Iand. He has only strengthened the big monopolists. His so-
called national socialism is only a demagogic lie, designed to
deceive the German working class, which has long since lost
faith in capitalism and is socialist-minded. The whollyicapital-
ist character of the economy of Nazi Germany was made clear
by G. S. Jackson in his above-cited article, from which the
following is an excerpt: -

“The same complex ﬁnancial set-up is. present under German
fascism as under American capitalism. The industrial plant of
the country is owned and operated by private individuals.
There are partnerships, limited liability companies, corpora-
tions, joint stock companies, trusts, monopolies, cartels and
syndicates. There are stocks, bonds, debentures, treasury notes
and mortgages. Money is borrowed from private persons, cor-
porations, banks, credit companies and the government, and
interest is paid on these loans.” .

Who Controls the Government?

The U.S.S.R. and Nazi Germany differ no less fundamen-
tally in their government make-up and policies than they do
in their systems of industrial ownership. In the Soviet Union
the political power is in the hands of the ‘workers, farmers
and working intellectuals—who comprise almost the entire
nation—and it is consistently used by them to advance their
interests. This fact is evidenced by the Soviet Government’s
class composition, as well as by its policies‘. Thus, in the two
chambers of the Supreme Soviet, of the 1,090 delegates 465
are workers, 310 are farmers, 315 are ofﬁce workers and pro-
fessionals. There are no capitalists or landlords, or their agents

8 .

 

in the Soviet parliament. The many thousands of local, state

and district Soviets are similarly constituted, and the army,
courts and all other government organs are also fully in the
hands of the people.

In Nazi Germany, however (as in fascist Italy), the govern-
ment is entirely dominated by the big bankers, industrialists
and landlords, personally and through their agents. This is
true also in the United States, although the forms of capitalist
state domination are not precisely the same as in Germany.
The central purpose of the Nazi Government is to further the
interests of the capitalist exploiters at the expense of the over-

whelming mass of the German people. This patent fact is

denied, however, by those who are trying to smear the Soviet
Union with charges of totalitarianism, and at the same time to

shield capitalism from the ill repute of fascism. Such people _

seek to make it appear that the capitalists are no longer in
power in Germany; that they have been overthrown by a
middle class revolution.

This is the argument of Corey, Burnham and Eastman. In
the same sense President Roosevelt, in his Jackson Day speech,
said: “We have seen what has happened to the great capitalists
of Germany who supported the Nazi movement, and then re-
ceived their reward in Nazi concentration camps or in death.”
Norman Thomas, who reﬂects every capitalist demagogy,
similarly says in his book, Socialism. on the Defensive, “The
German industrialists who helped Hitler to power miscalcu-
1ated.” Labor, the conservative railroad union weekly, likewise
misinforms us that Hitler has “enslaved the industrialists and
ﬁnanciers.” James Burnham’s recent book, The Managerial
Revolution, is based upon the same idea, and ‘innumerable
similar assertions could be cited. .

Such statements, which now ﬁll the press and the radio, are
utter falsiﬁcations. Not the capitalists, but the Communists and
other militant workers, populate Hitler’s concentration camps
and face his executioners. Not the middle class; rules Germany,
