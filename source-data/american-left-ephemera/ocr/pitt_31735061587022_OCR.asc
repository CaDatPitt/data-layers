short and quite heavy, greeted Mary at the door and then H
stepped back to admire the suit she was wearing. “That’s a
handsome suit. Why, it looks custom made.”

Mary said, "Yes, my father is a custom tailor. He
makes all my clothes.” 2

"You’re a lucky girl,” Mrs.‘sBraden said.,"I couldn’t
afford a custom suit until the agency was a success. Come,
you can use the desk near the window. Here’s a model script
you can follow. If you have any questions, e see me.”

"'I‘hanks. I will," Mary said. She took off her jacket
and with more respect than she'd ever shown for that jacket
before, carefully draped it over the back of the chair.

Mary typed from an Italian long-hand original that ’
was not too difficult to read. Before she brought the completed
typed script to Mrs. Braden, she proofed it as she'd been
taught to do. She read it aloud to herself, a line at a time. Mrs.
Braden scanned the pages and said, “Good work. You
followed the model well. LaRosa is a new account. I need
someone who knows Italian.”

"Italian is my second language. Speak it at home all
the time. Papa gets the Italian newspaper every Sunday.”
Mary gloated a little. To think knowing Italian was going to
land her a job. No pay. It didn’t matter. She'd get sotne
experience and that's what mattered. -

"I'll call the school about having you work here
mornings.” Mrs. Braden stood up, walked Mary to the door.

"Is nine o’clock O.K.?’ ’

"Fine. I’ll expect you.” ,

Over her shoulder Mary said, Good-bye,” and walked
slowly to the elevator, reluctant to leave. Her first success. She
had a lot to tell Papa.

Mary listened for Papa’s key in the door. Twenty-
third Street was everything he said it would be. She shivered
at the thought. But today she proved she could take care of
herself and he could stop worrying.

When she heard his key turn the lock, instead of
running to him, she sat in the kitchen chair and waited. He
came into the kitchen and made no move to take off his had or
his jacket as he usually did. She watched the lines in his face
deepen and he said hoarsely, “What happened?”

 

Softly and calmly she said, “I got a job. No pay. But

I’ll have experience.”

“What are you talking about?” His voice was thin.
high pitched, now. “Twenty-third Street? No pay?”-

“Not on Twenty-third Street,” she said. And slowly
she let it spill from the tongue, “Riverside Drive.”

"How fancy! Riverside Drive? What's on Riverside
Drive?” He put his hands on his hips and one by one the boys
catne into the kitchen and gathered around him.

Like someone on a soapbox, she talked loud and long
about the disappointment on Twenty Third Street, Mr.
Prossner’s encouragement, the free Miller Business School,
and Mrs. Braden’s Italian LaRosa
script. As she talked she watched Papa’s face relax. He took
off his grey-felt hat and wiped his forehead with his hand.
Turning to the boys he said, “Mary was too busy to cook. Go
get a pizza for dinner.” He put his hat and jacket on the chair
nearest him,\sat down and reached over to pat Mary's hand. “I
worried all day. You were all right in the city?”

“Sure. I can take care of myself,” she reassured

hirn.”(.)h, Papa. Mrs. Braden loved my suit. She had a lot of
nicethings to say about it."

~~ ~ ~ - WIIVIFN
Sure. Talk IS cheap. Why 1Sl'1 t she paying you for 1 J ’
your work?" he said and shook his head. "A fancy street and T 
no pay. Twenty-third Street, not fancy but..."   ‘Q L
» "Papa, we're missing Buck Rogers." ,“ ‘ f
L «Yeah. He's in that new space ship." He got up and  I 
went to the kitchen cabinet to snap on the radio and there was ‘L '
no more talk. She heard a space ship zapping by with a
staccato sound like gun fire. After a while, she didn't hear it.

She just heard the hum of success in the air. ‘  R éI}w@ORKAN9i?1‘\'$BURGvW

GRANDPA  

Sesshu Foster
Alhambra CA

Across the street from the cemetery where Grandpa
planted bodies and grass one dark Thanksgiving night the
bartender offered the regulars (Grandpa one of them) choice
of an ouzo or a Bushmill’s. Grandpa took the Bushmill’s.
Then he told me this story of the workers. They were a V ,
bunch of bad-mouthed misﬁts, bigots and losers doing all ,
the graveyard labor for $4 an hour. '
, One rainy day they were assigned to plant '3 pauper for
the county, an indigent old lady who paid no money to die,
running out of both cash and breath without permission. The
paupers were buried on the unmarked hillside behind the
cemetery proper, so the crew loaded the pine box onto the
truck and drove up to where the lane ended in the mud. In
the pouring rain those middle-aged men, beaten racists, .
malcontents, boozers all, with their whining put-downs of
everything and everybody, which Grandpa said he hated I , ,
worst of all, lifted the coffin between them, two on each end
and started uphill. ~ ‘ ’

They were in mud to.their ankles and the rain was '
beating on them, soaking them to the skin in minutes. One
of the guys, call him Eddie, was the butt of half their jokes
because he was not all there, he was retarded, and he
showed them up by doing just as good a job as allthe rest.’
Maybe it was Eddie, but somebody slipped and the coffin
went down in that mess of splattering clay. It was heavy and
they had to let it go or go with it themselves. The pine box
went down on its side and the lid came off; the old woman’s .
black leg fell out, perfectly naked in the rain. Eddie looked
down at it and said, “I don’t recognize her.” Andthey I
looked at the leg and looked at Eddie and stood around
laughing in the rain. And I laughed too over my gin and
tome.

Why is Grandpa’s face so red, Marina? Did he forget
his hat while planting orange trees in Death Valley and get
sunburnt all the way back? Why can’t he sit still, Marina,
does he carry a live wire in his pocket full of holes? Are his
shoes so thin from hitting the street that he can’t bear to wait
on eternity for even a few minutes?

The way the distance rings in off the land makes him T
squint, and when he grits the teeth he has left you can tell he 0
doesn’t like it at all. Tell Umeko his name is Foster, too,
because he’s her Grandpa, too. In spite of the missing teeth
the grin is still what was called radiant, and he does have
new artifical teeth. You were three when you first met him
in San Jose, where he slept in a car in a garage and got
drunk with the Indians, and Dolores gave him a haircut in
the garden where he was working.

If you’re lucky you’ll have Grandpa’s hands; hands
that almost helplessly make things grow, hands happier and
stronger than the man. Grandpa can tell you these stories
better than I—-the trouble with his stories is that they are

12

true. I’ll write this here now in the hot rain in L.A. in July
1986 because something may happen to Grandpa before you

are old enough to understand, because something is always &
happening to Grandpa.

Grandpa grew up on the Barbary Coast but it was
gone when he got back from the war, where the fresh sea
breeze blows across that hilly town where his father like so
many others worked away his days in the shipyard, and
Grandpa used the war to run off to string telephone wires
across North Africa and returned to America on top of the
world with an Italian girl who wanted to marry a rich
American; and boy, when she picked Grandpa did she "make
a mistake. He wanted to be a painter, to make it the supreme
single act that set him ﬂee. He studied painting in Italy at
the Academia de Belle Arte di Napoli where no riratter how
many times they changed models he painted the same
painting on the same canvas so they made him paint out in
the hall.

He painted lots of paintings but never kept any of
them, like your other Grandpa did in Mexico with a camera
now big and black and dusty like a strange accordion or one-
eyed alligator in the closet never to make music again. So
you know now who to blame when you get those feelings,
terrible funny feelings of wanting to be “further boundless
everywhichway” free while everybody else thinks you are
impractical if not completely irresponsible when the charm
wears off.

Grandpa did everything from picking fruit, security
guard, driving an ambulance, making fish sticks, ﬁxing
railroad bridges, gardening, foreman of landscaping crews,
groundskeeper, and may remember his days too well in the
Merchant Marine as dishwasher going around the world
once or twice and that’s why he walks like a boxer and has a
face like the Rocky Mountains. ‘ ‘

He spent days and weeks in unemployment offices
and on the streets running down want ads and he’d end up
handing out advertisements flyers for enough to pay rent and
beer yet never would know what the word “proletarian”
meant. Wife #1 took Baby Alberta back to Italy and later did
marry an American millionaire and tried to get Grandpa to
take back his name for $3,000, but when the messenger

‘ came to the door Grandpa told him no, so now you know

about how much your name is worth to the rich not to have
and that has to be worth something. Grandpa married
Grandma in a Zen chapel in Santa Barbara full of irises and
lillies cut from the estate he gardened and the whole caravan
of friends headed up into the hills afterwards for a barbeque.
He was always good at things that were real nice for one
day.

When the kids came Grandpa did all kinds of little
jobs in little towns all over California (signing a different
occupation on all our birth certificates) and we lived in
mountains and foothills, in the orchards and towns; we never
had too much to eat in those little towns where Grandma
went looking for him in the bars on payday and he was
always thinking up other good reasons for heading down the
long highway where the sound of the horns of semis at night
on the edge of town became the song of my childhood.

Your great grandmother Umeko Agawa told
Grandma, “He’s an alcoholic—you’re going to have touble

 

..A4—nn u.4unr\,QaI\$4!

 

 

 

with him” and she was right, but Grandma married him
anyway. He was always prone to superlatives in his speech
on everything from her leg of lamb to quotidian wonders
and chains to tomorrow's plans and the doctors told him his
drinking was going to kill him in ten years but he’d never
stop in this world and he’s still here (and you can see for
yourself what kind of world it is).

‘me last time I lived with him was when I was eight
and Grandma  the blood off her face and put the six of
us in the car (she was pregnant with your Uncle Sabby) and
we looked out of the back window as she drove off and the
cops were putting the handcuffs on him and he looked up,
saw us looking at him, so he ‘grinned.

Grandpa still drinks some ugly shit like green Hungar-
ian wine and cheap sour California red wine and beer after
beer  beer (first thing in the morning) and that’s why
when all of his wives one after the other said give up the
bottle or me, that was that, they never had a chance. After
the divorce Grandma raised your seven aunts and uncles
alone working in the day and going to school at night and
Grandpa would only send a‘ few hundred dollars now and
then. He’d show up drunk when I was with my friends and
they'd get quiet and he’d be grinning and I'd get mad but
they knew better than to say anything. Know this, Marina:
when someone smug that you're with makes fun of the poor
bastards digging ditches in the noonday sun or weaving
through the crowd aimless or brushing off some old man
they are making fun of men like your Grandfather.

When I was in Junior High School he bought me a
typewriter front Peru, sent me Japanese money, and wrote
me a letter from Vietnam; life was always like a merry-go-
round broken loose, he was always trying to ride his high
horse "free and in this your Aunt Naomi and your Uncle Paul
and me have something in common, though we can deny it
asGrandpacantoo,butifhethinksmeunnecessaryand
mean for writing you this he might do well to ask himself
why. I'll forever be looking through those dimly lit bars for
that old man, where the sunlight falls yellow through a crack
in the plateglass and it takes a moment for your eyes to
adjust to the ray of swirling dust behind the beer sign and
the other smashed men pause before he laughs and claps me
on the shoulder and makes a round of introductions.

Grandpa got shot in Watts about the time of the riots
by a Black kid with a high-powered riﬂe as he drove a
tractor in an L.A. city schools science center, and the kid
shot at everybody else on the street, too. The bullet broke
both legs and he spent nine months in a cast from chest to
toes, with his girlfriend Bunny smuggling him bottles and
delivering us for visits, there he told us how the tractor went
off by itself across the ﬁeld and he could hear his co-
workers chasing it down as he lay there on the ground.

After they took the pins out of his legs and taught him
how to walk again he went to Nicaragua with an outfit
calling itself Expeditions Unlimited Inc. to study Indian
ruins in the jungle (he thought) and sample bromeliads but
the story goes that they took everyone’s money and left
them suanded, so after he saw the rest back to the States
Grandpa spent a year there in the streets of Somaza’s
Managua (before the earthquake, before the triumph) and he
brought back wife #3 ‘owing everybody more money than

 

13

ever.

Aunt Carmen was born in California and for a while
they were a happy family with his new job, a new suit and a
new car, but it couldn’t last; Tina gave him the ultimatum
and he threw it all away. When I asked him what happened
to the car he said he drove it into a ﬁeld one night and
walked away and never went back for it, and the suit ended
up in boxes somewhere which never got forwarded when he
moved on. ,

It was 1977 and the insurrectional war in Nicaragua by
the Sandinistas against the Somoza dictatorship was heating
up, so the INS found out they were no longer together and
uied to deport Tina and Carmen back to Nicaragua (though
of course Carmen had never been there) and I rode Grey-
hound back and forth through Oakland, Vallejo, Fairfield
and Vacaville carrying messages between Grandpa and his
family, trying to get him to help Tina get the government off
her back but the person who did the most was eight year-old
Carmen who translated for her mother and took care of them
and her new-bom sister Veronica.

And where is Cannen now, Grandpa? He worked as a
shit-grinder in a fertilizer factory, dug holes in the grave-
yard, landscaped tract homes, read Zen manuals and poetry,
novels and other books and never got any politics, remained
always confused, always enthusiastic, drank with his
Mexican crews at home and inthe bars, eyed their dark

pretty daughters, but Grandpa was no longer that collegiate -

boxer in Chico on the G.I. Bill, no longer the charismatic
bohemian artist type, his hair turned completely white and
more teeth fell out so that no two touched each other any
longer, a gang of black kids in the dying alleys of downtown
Vallejo tried to beat him to death but he kept his head down
and staggered away with only his nose broken for third or
fourth time, when I visited him in the rented room above the
Chinese restaurant I saw he could no longer live through
more beatings, he was past sixty when he stayed with Paul
in San Jose and when Paul left he was back in the streets
again; he could no longer make ends meet on day-labor for
$4 an hour, sometimes his knees and ankles would swell up
from gout and he could no longer walk, without teeth he
could no longer eat Italian delicacies and meat and other
things, and as the life of the street was what was killing him
the Veterans Hospital in Palo Alto sent Grandpa to the Old
Soldier's Home in Yountville in the heart of the wine .
country where he might finally (as final as anything was for
him) make himself at home (as much as he was ever at home
anywhere, of his own making) and he could remain and
drink, readying himself for whatever luckless sojourn he
might make anew along the forever increasing frontiers of
his own human limitations as he was always unwilling to
acknowledge even in his many letters to me (I've boxed if .
you want to read them) showing his attention to sunlight and
the weather, people and acquaintances, plants and coinci-
dences and art, idealist spiritual aspirations, as well as a
certain hard-won poetic based on lived experience we shared
in towns like Santa Rosa and Sebastopol, Oakhurst and Los
Banos, his road through life he recounts in his vernacular
from the forties and ﬁfties as when duringthe sixties we
moved through another town, across a bridge above a river
rushing down through looks into the open sea smelling of

PEDDLER MEN

Paul Weinman
Albany, NY

Peddler men would come up into these hills looking
like the back yard dumps of some city towns. Why, they'd be
but two feet with a bundle of every shape and whatnot tied
crisscross sticking up and about like stacks of hay. Even me,
who’d sesh us from making fun of anyone, would crack a lip .
in smile.

But the stuff they walked in was something we’d
squeel with delight in seeing untied. Set out with dramatic

- talk to our sight for selling. We’d no stores and to see new

type gadgets for peeling apples, catching fish, curling
hair. . .saying nothing of course for buttons and boots, pills for
ills none had suffered from - at least not ‘til after we’d heard
what cured them. _

Each peddler man had his quirk  some with card

‘ tricks and juggling three balls  telling tales while we set at

night - sure our eyes bulged in fright. One we knew a while
would dress so tidy despite the mess of box and bottle he'd
stagger beneath. Talked sort of feminine and everything had
to be each in its special way.

‘Cept when he ate. Why, it be like a half-starved
hog let loose in fresh-picked corn doused to deer drippings.
He’d be invited at table more for watching him eat than in the
nicety of politness ways. Why, we had to hold him back
before our prayers of thanksgiving be said. Then look out we
did. For his knife ﬂashed for food with his hands not far
behind that quick trip to mouth. I'd never seen anyone
balance so many peas to blade as he did in swift stroke.

Now him being so particular in selling each item
separate and no bartering of what sum, my brother and me
were going to fool him by slipping extra weight in tags that
he’d pay to take. ii

We bundled out bits and strips up tight, but slipped
in a some heavy pieces of copper pipe. And sure we got skin-
quick when he picked it up and hefted this as if something
wasn’t quite right.

He poked at it and stuck his arm and fingers’
within. . .of course we were about to split in giggle. All right,
he says, and pays us in pennies hot for our hands.

We’d tricked him good and were fast to‘ run ahead
and open the gate that led from the farm. He thanked us as he
left, saying  If you’re interested in making more money
than that from rags, keep your eyes wide for old bits of
copper. I pay five times over per pound than that for part of
pants and stuff.

He winked and told us to keep at prayer.

In Pursuit of the Nickel

Genny Davis
Coalton, WV

“You’re here,” the young woman told us. ‘Her house
was set below the bank of a steep hill. Since I was in my car,
all that I could see of her was from the waist up.

“You’re on Grab a Nickel Hill,” she added, smiling.

I inquired if there were any coal mines in the area.
She pointed in the direction of Philippi, but she was vague.
Then she waved her hand to the west, saying that the mines
were closed.

We thanked the woman, and we continued around the

turn. Going back, we noticed three men with the woman now. ‘

We waved to them and they returned the greeting.

My friend Pauline laughed, “So, there is Grab a
Nickel. I thought you said pumpemickel. That's what I asked
the man down there. I bet a nickel was hard to come by so
that's how it got its name.”

“Tell me about it,” I wanted to say but I thought it
was too nice of a day to talk about my obsession with the
nickel. It might be downright depressing.

Certainly I can’t talk to my granddaughter
Lisa about money, either. When she wails that “a ﬁve” isn’t
enough spending money, she isn’t talking about the ﬁve cent
coin. She wouldn’t understand that I grew up in the thirties
and forties without having a nickel to spend.

One evening when I came home, Lisa told me that I
had received a call from a Carmella Mascilli Bonnelli. Lisa
said that Carmella asked all sorts of questions, and she wanted
to know why I hadn’t looked up people in all the three years I
had been back to the old home place.

“I’ll call her, but not tonight,’ ’ I told her.

“Well, you don’t sound anxious?”

“After forty years, why does it matter. You can’t
make up for all that time.”

“Have it your way,” Lisa added.

About six months later Lisa asked if I ever visited my
school friend.

“I heard that her husband is a retired New York City
cop,” she added. "Carmella wouldn’t live there any longer
after he retir .”

I thought of Carmella’s mother selling wine to my
father during those depression years. That was one reason I
disliked her in those days.

The other reason had to do with Baby Ruth candy
bars and my lack of a nickel to buy one. Every day at noon
I'd watch Carmella munch on one of those chewy morsels.
She would lean her big frame against a steam heater by the
window. Beyond the window, across the street, was Dino
George’s store; After so many years I can still see Carmella’s
widely-spaced white teeth as she crunched into the candy bar.
I must have savored every bite she took, but she never offered
any to me. '

Dino stood over his candy counter. As the students
put a coin down he'd reach a pudgy hand among the boxes
and retrieve the pieces. I do not recall how often I went there.

16

All I can remember is that my self-esteem crumbled each time
to the warped wooden ﬂoor.

At times, Dino’s dark-haired wife Mamie would
appear from behind the curtain divider by the meat counter.
Then she would smile, and that made my deprivation worse. I
do not recall if either Dino or Mamie ever spoke to me.
Perhaps they were too occupied to notice a gangling girl who
bought nothing in their store.

Now when I go to the Catholic cemetery to visit the
family graves, I must pass Dino's imposing headstone to the
left. I think, just as he guarded that candy counter now he
guards my entrance to the cemetery.

Mamie joined Dino this year. She'll share the
imposing headstone with her husband. She was eighty, and
during the intervening years she had become part of our
family through marriage. Her granddaughter had married my
husband’s cousin. ‘

When I got to the church for the funeral mass, it was
full. As the priest drank the wine and performed the burial
rites I remembered the store. During prayer, I asked Mamie to
forgive me for thinking about candy bars at such a time.

_ In time I will visit Carmella and I'll try not to laugh
about school days or candy bars. I wonder if her brothers are
still living, the ones who picked berries at our place. Once we
did get revenge on the “Dago Red,” a small victory for us. '

My father obligingly invited Carmella’s father to pick
blackberries for wine. He brought along sons Niki and Tony,
and they picked gallons of blackberries. They put their first
load of benies on the ledge of the well where they’d stay cool.

“Quick,” I called to sister Helen. “Bring the wash
tub. I’ll get some leaves from the apple tree and some stones.
We’ll ﬁx those wine makers!”

We dumped the berries from the containers into the
tub. Then carefully we alternated leaves and stones into the
buckets, and the one small tub of theirs held a nice amount of .
berries. We filled the containers the rest of the way with about
a fourth of the berries, and we returned them to their original
place.

A few hours later the berry pickers returned. They
were loaded up and ready to go home.

“This one is light,” Niki said as he hoisted the tub to
his shoulders. We said nothing as they went out the gate and
down the road. This was the last of the berry pickers. .

However, this was not the last of our reminder of the
infamous wine which took a sizeable part of our money during
the Great Depression and the pre-World War 11 years. I
learned after I had returned from working in New York during
the great war that Mr. Mascilli had died and Mrs. Mascilli
wanted to move away from “the hill.” She had a local
carpenter to build her a new home.

When my two sisters and I would come in to visit my
father, we came via Morgantown because Helen lived there
now. Mrs. Mascilli’s house was on our route home.

Helen pointed out, “'Ihere’s ‘Daddy’s house.’ He
helped build it.” She noticed our puzilement and then she
explained, "I'hat’s the house Mrs. Mascilli built.”

_“It's well-built,” I noted. “Truly neat with just
enough stone to set it off and look at the landscaping.”

“Did you ever mention the house to Daddy when you
went by?” I asked.

She replied, “Yes, I did once, for the meanness of it.
And he just laughed when I told him that was the house he
lwhndbmﬂdf

‘-‘Oh, he was thinking of all of that good wine and
smacking his lips, no doubt,” I said sadly. “But I wonder if
that wine was any good. Just cheap?”

Helen went on with a touch of anger, “They didn't
care, as long as the fools bought it. They went to making that
“Dago Red” with pills. That's when Jimmie Clark went crazy
fhnndﬁnhmgﬂesndf”

Then I went to Ohio, raised a family and I forgot
about the Mascilli house. When I returned to the home-place,
I began to do my shopping in Woodland. Then I passed
‘Daddy’s house.’ I noticed it was vacant, though there were no
broken windows or any kind of vandalism. Only the shrub-
bery seemed to be taking over.

I made an inquiry when I talked to my neighbor. She
told me that “the state owns all of that land.” The Mascilli
house stands on the proposed Corridor H, the interstate
highway system which some believe will deliver West
Virginia frotn its third world country status.

I’ve played with the idea of collecting nickel memo-
rabilia, perhaps posters or wrappers. Right off, a cup of coffee
comes to mind, a telephone call, a hamburger, a candy bar and
a ride on the New York City Subway, to name a few.

Why just the other day, being the couch potato I am
for morning programs, I heard Jane Pauley say in her syrupy
voice that she drank ﬁve cent cokes in college. I have thought
of writing to Andy Rooney on Sixty Minutes. I’m certain he
could expound on the merits of a nickel, both past and present.

Or perhaps I'll invite Carmella to lunch.

“At the Factory Gate”
(For my Father)

Michael Yates
Johnstown, PA

If I had some money, I would walk down the steep
path to town, landing on Seventh Avenue, and past the row
houses and small neat homes, make my way to Petroleum
Sales. My eyes gleamed in anticipation for this was a store
filled with a child’s delights: gumballs, exotic stamps,
airplane kits, baseball cards, and fake cigarettes which smoked
when you blew into them. These cigarettes were a special
favorite of mine. With one of them dangling out of the comer
of my mouth, I could pretend that I was a tough guy hanging
around my uncle’s dairy store looking cool and hard in jeans
hung low on my hips, held up with a thin pink belt. Once in
the alley behind the school yard, “Scoop” Folta, dazzling in
his sunglasses and d.a. haircut, actually asked me for a
cigarette. “Got a weed?” he said. I felt for a moment that
maybe we could be friends, but then I shamefully remembered
that my cigarette wasn’t real.

Bald old Mr. Reitler kept a sharp eye out for youthful
thieves, but they didn’t have trick mirrors and store dicks in
that poor town, so you could pocket a treasure or two if you
were careful. Mean-faced Mr. Reitler! I never minded stealing
his trinkets. He wore a suit and he looked like my dad's
bosses. He was rich and probably a Jew. Surely he would
never miss a set of uiangle stamps from Monaco or a baseball
or a pack of those cigarettes.

Petroleum Sales was in the middle of a block on Fifth
Avenue, between 7th and 8th streets. On leaving, I always
turned left toward the stores downtown. I might be a little
apprehensive because my pal Joe’s mother could come
stumbling drunk and disheveled out of the side door of the bar
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. I

Slobbering, toothless, and in a ﬂimsy housecoat, she
would babble out some wild tale, trying all the while to grab
and kiss you. More than once Joe and I witnessed this to-
gether. He would swear and tell her to get the hell home. I
would pretend not to notice, and we never talked about it. Joe
liked me, and I was glad for that. I knew he liked me because
he invited me home even when his mother was there. Oh, I
saw some terrible scenes. At eighth grade graduation, our
parents were invited to a communion breakfast after morning
mass. J oe’s mother came, in a pretty dress and wearing
makeup, trying hard to make small talk and mingle among the
parents unnoticed. But no one except my mother would speak
to her. Poor woman. She was like an old and broken plate,
shoddily glued together and with all of the cracks showing.
We waited for her to break, the meaner among us snickering
as her voice rose and her speech thickened. The nuns shared
knowing glances with the parents, secretly blaming Joe for the
sins of his mother. Funny how those angels of mercy had so
little compassion for those who needed it and how easily they
were impressed by all of the material things which they had
forsaken. Finally, she announced, almost in a shout, that she
had to go home to turn off the stove. We watched her leave in

silence and then returned to our eggs and toast, basking in the
glow of our parent’s pride. All but J oe. He had no appetite.
Tonight there would be a violent argument. His mother would
screech at his bookkeeper father. J oe’s dad could add faster
than a calculator, but he didn’t have speed enough to avoid the
ﬂying shoes and the screams of “Willi, you bastard;” “Willi,
you cocksucker.”

' When I think of J oe’s mother, I remember something
she told my grandmother. Grandma was working at
Greenbaum’s department store, and one day she was accosted ‘
by Joe’s two aunts who tried to sell her some pies which they
had just bought on sale at the supennarket. J oe’s mother sidled
up to my grandmother and said, sotto voce, “you have to
watch out for my sisters. They're crazy.”

The Fifth Avenue Hotel was a three-story gray
tenement, buttressed by fire escapes. It was home to an
assortment of derelicts, old bachelors, and shady deals.
Through the side door oozed the cool, sickening smells of dirt
and stale beer. Ceiling fans muted the sodden chatter of the
barﬂies and petty racketeers who drank away the afternoons
there. I longed to walk in there and order a coke or ask for
change for the pinball machine. Maybe Ruben or Shannon or
Jumbo Lawrence would say, “how’s it going kid?” On the
other hand, crazy Jimmy Lazaroff might goose me, or the
gangster bartender, Pete DiComo might tell me to get the fuck
out of there. So, I never did go in. Instead, I turned left on
ninth street and headed for the park. If it was early, I might
cross the street to look longingly at the gobs in the window of

Kunst’s bakery. Later when I learned that “kunst” means “art”

in German, I had fantasies about that bakery: a banner with
huge, sensuous letters cut out of construction paper which
said,”Cakes decorated by Matisse;” or fancy breads shaped
and ornamented to look like Picasso's harlequins. Mr. Kunst
could have made a fortune, except that he wasn’t German.

. The park took up a whole block, between ninth and
eighth streets and fourth and third avenues, a pretty park and

large too for a small town, with a bandstand in the middle, just“

right for patriotic speeches on Memorial Day and the Fourth
of July. Near the bandstand was the ﬂag-bedecked statue of
John Ford, the town's founder. On a summer day, women
would watch over their children from the park benches
conveniently located along the walkways and under the tall
trees. At one comer of the park, across the street from the
factory gate, pensioners would play checkers and talk, some
smiling because their days as working stiffs were over and
some wistful because they were‘ locked out of their second
home. In 1957 the park was a peaceful place. But a dozen
years later, when my classmates trooped back from Vietnam,
time bombs, bearded and wearing peace signs on their olive-
drab fatigues, the park became a war zone. We desecrated the
flag,‘ smoked dope, painted our faces, and fought with the pigs.
The park was ours, and who could blame the matrons and
retirees for seeking shelter elsewhere.

I have always been obsessed with being on time, sol
usually arrived at the park twenty or thirty minutes before shift
change. I had come to town to meet my father at the factory
gate. To kill time, I would walk around and through the park,
chewing on a toothpick and daydreaming. If no one were
looking, I would practice my pitching motion, kicking my
right leg high like Warren Spahn, but quickly shifting into a

calling the play-by-play. If you can picture this, you’ll
understand why the neighbors said that they could always pick
me out at a distance

by the way I walked.

At about five minutes to four, I would try to get a seat
on one of the benches near the Works 6 gate, which was
located across from the northwest comer of the park, and wait
for the whistle to blow. Strung out along the river, from the
bridge at the lower end of town to 13th street, over a mile in
all, the factory was divided into three units: Works 4, Shop 2,
and Works 6. Works 4, the largest, was one long assembly
line, starting at the Batch House where sand, cullet, chemicals,
and the other ingredients used to make glass were mixed and
cooked, to G & P where the finished plates of glass were
ground and polished. From Shop 2, came the journeymen who
did all of the factory’s carpentry, painting, electrical repair,
and general maintenance; it was here too that apprentices
learned the various trades. Finally, at the northern end of the
factory, was Works 6, where my father worked. Works 6 was
special because the glass was still made in small batches, by
skilled workers. Huge kettles of molten glass were cooked and
poured by hand, and then the plates were cut into basketball
bank boards or aircraft windshields so thin that they could be
bent. The men who cooked the glass worked irregular stints,
sometimes doing a double shift, sometimes coming out in the
middle of the night, and sometimes just sitting around waiting
for the spectacular pouring of the glass. They had a kitchen
outfitted with stove and refrigerator, and they weren’t very
friendly to strangers. My father was an examiner then,
although he had had many different jobs, from lowly packer to
skilled cutter. He checked the plates for ﬂaws in front of a
high intensity lamp in a dark room; rejecting those pieces with
more than a certain number. He told me that the company
didn’t like to ship had glass, but the foremen weren’t happy
when he rejected too many plates either. That was a company
for you.

My father was a precise man, but not as precise as his
father, who also worked at Number 6. Well, grandfather
wasn’t actually a worker. The truth is, he was a time-study
engineer, a regular Frederick Taylor who could tell time
without a watch. I admired my grandfather, mostly because he
was such a good bowler, but I didn’t quite trust him. He wore
a suit and tie, always, like Mr. Reitler. My father never wore a
suit and tie, and he never went to church on Sunday. Grandfa-
ther tithed at the Baptist Church and supported Temperance
and the Republican Party. He voted against Roosevelt four
times. But my distrust was small by comparison to that of my
father’s work mates. They hated grandpa’s stopwatch and
always slowed down when he made his rounds. I wonder if his
son did too.

I got excited when the whistle blew. The gate faced
3rd Avenue, but it was at the end of a long tunnel under the
railroad tracks, so it would be a couple of minutes before
anyone came out. Maybe J oe’s aunts, who spent eight hours
sitting in a dimly-lit room checking thick pieces of optical
glass and who that morning could have been seen ﬂying down
the street to punch in at 7:59, would be the first to surface. Or
more likely it would be the slackers like Fred Wain, who
always got to the time clock first. Then small groups of three
or four, some smoking and backslapping, others sullen and

 

pensive, would stream steadily up the steps and onto the street.
A human machine, breaking into its component parts, and
then, as if by magic, decomposing into solitary faces. I looked
for people I knew. Roy, with a plate in his head. Moe, the
union vice president. Dom, a premature greaser with a Harley
and an armful of tattoos. Nick, my dad’s best friend, a solid,
heavy set Russian with a sly sense of humor. I liked those
men, but my father was the main attraction. He would be in
the middle of a row of buddies, smoking a Lucky Strike. So
handsome with his jet black hair, perfectly parted and always
in place, his shirt smartly tucked into his creased trousers.
Many of the men had potbellies and wore old-fashioned caps,
but he was slim and bareheaded. He never had a five o—clock
shadow, and his shoes were always bright and shiny. And
while Dom might smell so strongly of sweat that it was hard to
breathe, dad always smelled as if his clothes had just come off
the drying line. He was sharper, ﬁner, and I was proud that he
was my father.

Wen I saw him, I would wave to catch his attention,
and then walk over to join the exodus. His buddies might pat
me on the head and say, “Bud, is that your boy,?”or “Hi,
Mike,” or “Boy, he's getting big.” When we got to his black
’5 1 Chevy, we’d say goodby to his friends. Someone would
surely say, “See you at work.” We’d get into the car. I’d show
him my booty, but I wouldn’t tell him how I got it. He'd offer
me a stick of Beechnut gum, and we’d drive home.

One Emigrant’s Story -
An Eyewitness Account
of History

By«Sally Jones
Colliers, WV

A casualty is deﬁned as a loss in war by death or
wounds. This interpretation can be very misleading, for the
casualty count of WW 1 did not include the thousands of
people displaced by treaties. These treaties forced many
young, unmarried men of military induction age, to join
another nation's quest for victory or ﬂee to a country which
openly accepted such casualties.

This story had its beginnings in Europe, on the small
Island of Crete. On a late summer day in 1894, the vigorous
cries of a newborn child echo through a stone farmhouse. The
child was the third and last son born to a family of landown-
ers. His birth brought great joy to his parents, for theirs was a
society which looked preferably upon male offspring. As a
child, he spent carefree days under the watchful eye of a
loving mother. She taught him the history of the land, owned
for centuries by their ancestors. She instilled a pride of his
lineage, which could be traced to the Fourteenth Century. He
was a descendent of warriors, who had won claim to the land
by the might of the sword.

From his father and two older brothers he would
learn the skills of farming and fishing along with the teach-
ings of the Islamic Faith. The multi-acre farm of productive
earth and the surrounding sea provided an abundant life. The
climate was warm year round; constant breezes from the sea,
served as a natural cooling sytem during the excessively hot
days of summer. He spent several hours of each day playing
on the sandy beaches with the other young boys of his village.
They swam in the warm, salty waters of the sea. Life was
good and bountiful.

The signs of unrest started in Europe in 1912, but the
hardships of war never reached the isolated island until 1915.
The soldiers of another country came by boat to the island.
They ordered the young men of military induction age to
emigrate to America. By 1916, over three hundred had
emigrated to a country which accepted such refugees with
open arms. The horrors of war had not touched most island
families except for several young men who had departed for
the mainland to fight “Thewar to end all wars.” They had not
been heard from for over a year. Their destiny was unknown
and they were presumed dead.

My father was one of fifty to sixty young men
remaining on the island. He had inherited the land, two years
earlier, with the deaths of his father and brothers. They had
died of a fever before the soldiers had invaded Crete. The
ancient culture’s beliefs made him sole owner of this land.

20

 

Women, considered a possession in this culture, had no rights
of ownership. By remaining, he could retain claim to the land
and raise future generations of his sons and grandsons.

Those who had chosen to stay were now brutally
beaten by the invaders who claimed the land was theirs by
treaty. The islanders were farmers and understood nothing of
politics and treaties. Their lives had been hard manual farm
work, and although the blood of ancient warriors ﬂowed in
their veins, they were peaceful men. .

When told they must swear allegiance to a foreign
sovereignity and join its army, they refused. The pride of the
once great Ottoman Empire, and the history of an empire
once greater than the Roman Empire, had been deeply
instilled in their early teachings. Their departure and absence
in caring for the land would mean the forfeiture of a way of
life over five centuries old. They turned to prayer to Allah,
asking for an end to “the madness” which engulfed most of
Europe. ,

The invaders had now set up barracks in the center
of the village. Each day the young men of the village were
herded at gunpoint, to the center of town. They were told “the
sheep and goat herds are to be confiscated and the farm crops
will now feed us.” These demands caused negative responses
to erupt from the farmers. Two, considered leaders of the
dissenters, were seized, stood against the stone barracks and
shot down in cold blood. This type of violence the islanders
eyes had never before witnessed. The brutal executions left
no other choice but to comply with the demands which left
very little food to feed their families.

The islander’s culture was one which dealt very
harshly with theft. When a farmer was accused of withhold-
ing crops, they realized it was another attempt to intimidate
and hasten the departure of the remaining young men. The
accused was first beaten unconscious with riﬂe butts, then
taken to the center of the village. All the villagers were
summoned to watch the consequences of “stealing”. The
“thief” was aroused by a bucket of cold water, thrown in his
face. Upon awakening, he found that his hands were bound
behind his back, legs were lashed in a kneeling position and

 

 

 

his mouth was gagged. To the right and left sides of the
accused “thief” stood an invader, each holding a large club.

The first bone shattering blow struck the right upper
arm, near the shoulder. The second blow was administered to
the same part of the anatomy, by the club holder on the left.
Alternately, blows were administered to thighs, ribs and pelvic
bones. Before the merciful death blow was administered to the
base of the skullxthe right hand was unbound, placed on a
block of wood and amputated with a sword. It was held for all
horriﬁed onlookers to view then thrown to the village dogs,
who fought over its consumption. The act of amputation and
the manner of disposal of the severed hand meant the accused
would never enter the Gates of Allah, as the gestures branded
him a “thief.”

This atrocity against cultural and religious beliefs
prompted a thre'e-day boat trip to the mainland by the village
elders to obtain passage to America for the island’s legacy, its
young men. The elders had “been convinced” the land, once
confiscated would be of no consequence if there were no one
to farm it. Days later, as the persecuted young Turks departed
their homeland by mwboats, black clouds shrouded the moon
and aided an escape. In later years, my father would refer to
this exodus as having “to sneak away, like a thief in the
night.” ‘

The persecuted ﬁfty-seven quietly waited for the
outgoing tide to move them out of riﬂe range. Once assured of
this area of safety they started to row for the mainland of
Turkey, but not before tearful eyes squinted to commit a
cherished homeland to memory. The war could not last
forever, and each intended to retum and reclaim the land.

They arrived safely to the shores of the mainland,
after rowing all night, with passage tickets and money donated
by the village elders, to start a new life in America. Their
search for a “New World” bound ship was immediately
successful, and their journey was underway in a few hours.
But war often shows a side of man not seen in peacetime.
Unscrupulous dockworkers demand their money before they
can board ship, explaining “In America wealth is everywhere;

' you only stoop to scratch it from the streets.” Their plight was
a serious one: they could not return home, certain their
absence had been noticed by the invaders. If they chose to
return they would be shot as saboteurs. The dockworkers
demands were reluctantly met.

Each boarded the ship penniless carrying a suitcase
which held photographs of loved ones, changes of clothing,
and food consisting of black olives, goat cheese, and stale '
bread to last the thirty day voyage to America. Once under
way, the ship made a stop in Italy. They were surprised to see
women board the ship and even more surprised to see their
faces were not veiled. Their journey continued and later that
day they were horrified as they watched these Italians cook
and eat white worms with what appeared to be blood poured
on top...spaghetti.

Each evening, during the crossing, the Italians played
the “squeeze box” and danced to toe-tapping music. The
islanders of Crete were now shocked as they watched women
passengers openly dance, ﬂirt and fratemize with male
passengers. In their secular society, these types of overt
ﬂirtations were never tolerated. They refused requests to join
in the gaiety, and only observed from a huddled group.

Aside from the evening entertainment, the trip across
the Atlantic Ocean was terrifying and miserable. Passengers in
steerage, as they were, took turns at watch for German U-
boats, which were indiscriminate of their targets. Tlw rolling
of the vessel, through choppy waters, caused the stench of
vomit, and excretions of the seasick to be unavoidable whether
topside, or below deck in cramped quarters. My father and
“uncles” as sixteen to twenty-two year old immigrants, now
had uncertainty as a constant companion.

Finally, they arrived in New York Harbor, emanci-
pated and exhilarated. The sight of Ellis Island, through a
hovering fog, brought a loud cheer from the ship’s passengers.
At the sight of the Statue of Liberty,‘ the men removed their
hats, placed them across their chests and gave a silent, tearful
salute to the “Grand Lady” whose torch sparked new hope in
their lives. Many women fell to their knees and cried openly, .
while others fainted in disbelief at their safe arrival.

Once the ship dropped anchor, they were “herded like
sheep” into smaller boats and taken to the Grand Hall of Ellis
Island. As they ascended the Grand Stairway, doctors, holding
a piece of chalk in their hand, closely watched them. A quick
medical check was given hands and bone structure for any
signs of rickets. Their heads were checked for lice, eyes
examined for any signs of trachoma, which could lead to
eventual blindness, and the doctor's watched closely for any
signs of lameness or feeblemindedness. The examiners
listened to their chests to detect heart problems and especially
checked any suspicious cough which could signify turbercu-
losis. This would lead to isolation or deportation back to the
country from whence they came. Thus their futures depended
on the pieces of chalk the doctors held.

Once these critical tests were passed, they were sent
to the Immigration Inspector where names were checked
against the ship’s manifest of passengers. It was at this time
many surnames were changed. Some were spelled phoneti-
cally, others shortened by interviewers to make proper
pronounciations. Once assured they were physically and
mentally fit and could support themselves and get employ-
ment, they were permitted to pass through the doors marked to
New York. Few immigrants could read the English writing on
the “doors to freedom", but instinctively knew of their
importance.

A short ferry ride to Manhattan started their life in
America. In Manhattan they were immediately hired by a
representative of a Colorado Mining Company, who offered to
pay their train fare to the mine fields. 4

The summer climate of Colorado was agreeable and
much like their island home. It was the bone-chilling winters
of the Rocky Mountains they were unprepared to endure. The
temperature of their island home never got below forty
degrees, and now the subzero weather chilled them to the
bone.

As “miners of coal”, they worked sixteen to eighteen
hour days. It was backbreaking work, or to use my father’s
terminology, “We sweata blood!”, but they were used to hard
work as previous farmers. The meager wages they were paid,
with deductions for travel expenses and purchases from the
company store, could not match the rapidly compounding
debts to the mining company. Each payday, instead of wages,
they received “a snake.” It was a piece of paper, a cnrdely

scribbled line gave its name, and meant their expenses had
exceeded wages
C After three years of slave labor, the immigrants

threatened to strike. They had been continually cheated by
foreman who reported falsely low productivity, and effectively
decreased their incentive ages. Although the workers claims of
inaccurate counts of mulepulled mine carts were legitimate,
the mining company responded with: “No Work! No Credit!”

Violence errupted in the Colorado Mine Fields, as
again these immigrants faced the forces of authori y. The mine
owners use of severe beatings, indiscriminate ki mgs, and
starvation, did not achieve its intended purpose. They had
emmigrated to America to avoid such things, yet instead of a
land of promise and plenty, they had found only disillusion-
ment and extreme poverty. The promises of prosperity and
freedom had not materialized and perhaps, worst of all, they
could not overcome the language barrier. These conditions
caused many to plan an escape by jumping a freight train,
which passed nearby the coal ﬁelds. The dark of night, again,
aided an escape. This train would take them further west to
Arizona, where the climate was much like their homeland and
more to their liking.

The war was over in Europe, but they were poverty
stricken, unable to afford passage back to Europe. The
immigrant band as a cohesive unit began employment in the
copper mines. This job offered better working conditions and‘
closer to honest cart counts, but cave-ins were a daily threat.
The casualties and death count were very high.

They were able to save money, for the first time since
they had arrived in America. For several years, all went well,
but fate had not eluded them. They became trapped, near the
entrance, in a mine cave-in. They vowed if rescued never to
re-enter a mineshaft. As they watched, in shock and disbelief,
the limp, lifeless bodies of many of their fellow workers
carried to the surface, plans were made to go to New York and
return to Europe. The year was 1929...

While enroute by train, the news of the Stock Mraket
Crash reached the travelers. This inﬂuenced a decision to
leave the train in Ohio, before it reached New York. Returning
to Europe, which was now in worse political and domestic
situations. than America, would have to wait. The hard earned
money intended for their return was now used to survive. ‘As
America plummeted into some of its darkest days, jobs
became impossible to find and savings were quickly ex-
hausted. With savings depleted, they were thrust into the
streets.

The government set up “Soup Kitchens” in an effort
to stop the masses from starving. Heavily watered soups,
bread and hot coffee helped ease the pangs of almost constant
hunger. My father and “uncles” accepted the bread and coffee
but refused the hot soups fearing to consume “unclean” pork
products. They made their home between the steel pillars of a
bridge. Beds became the sands of the river bank, and newspa-
pers, which only told of the harsh conditions; served as sheets
and blankets. It was a shanty town without the shanties.

Days, once spent working, were now spent ﬁshing
from the banks of the Ohio River, panhandling and digging in
the city dump for unbroken glass milk bottles. Once returned
to a grocery store for a one or two cent deposit, the “earnings”
of each man were put together to purchase cheese, bread and

black olives.

The election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took the pre-
sidental office in 1932, started a country mending its severe
wounds of poverty. Prosperity returned slowly, the black pages
of American History started to turn grey, as jobs became avail-
able. However, the Great Depression was never to be forgotten.

The steel mills, in their infant growing stages, de-
pended heavily on immigrant workers. In one of these mills in
the Ohio Valley, my father and “uncles” found hard, manual
labor. Once hired they were told they must purchase their jobs
and each payday their foreman must be paid for the privilege of
working. The foreman’s coat was hung near the door of his
office and each worker knew the expected amount to retain his
job. The foreman could see the contributors and mentally listed
his workers. Not only were they blackmailed to keep their jobs,
but expected to purchase other whims of their foreman, outside
the confines of the mill. Failure to comply with the rules of a
“bloodsucker” meant a pennanent exclusion from the work list.

. After several years of working sixteen hour days under
unfair conditions, the steelworkers went on strike.-As they had
witnessed the strikes in the coal ﬁelds and its aftermath, they
now became eyewitness to the violence of strikebreakers. Once
again, their savings were used to survive.

By the mid-thirties, the steel companies agreed to
admit the union. This formed the foundations of eight hour
work days, avoided payola, provided job security and pensions.

My father never returned to Europe but remained a
productive steelworker. He benefitted from the union, won
“rights of a working man” ,retiring in 1962 with a pension.
Although his religious and cultural beliefs remained intact, his
patriotism, to America was as strong as the steel products
forged in her steel mills. His memory remained extremely
vivid, of his first turbulent, eighteen years in America.

In 1934, at age forty, he married to extend “his
bloodlines.” I am one of six of his bloodline. A proud, first
generation American acknowledging, not only the courage
shown by my father, but, of all America’s immigrants. They
were the oppressed, poor, and homeless who humbly passed
through “the doors to freedom” at Ellis Island. Although, most
have passed into American History, their descendants, Ameri-
can now, also offer a salute to the “Grand Lady of Freedom.”
May your torch continue to light the way forever.

In Carnegie, Pennsylvania, on the Weekend

He would open his heart like the coke oven doors
and the pride would flow hot through his pockets
and come out in coin. Drinks for his fellow workers.
Every Friday at the Main Hotel, a twenty dollar bill
laid at either end of the bar.

“Drink up boys, I don't like no change saggin’

my pockets." And they drank to cut the coal dust.
They drank to love,

to Irish women with curly red hair

and steel-blue eyes, to hard work and plenty

of it to go around, to hard fists and honest hearts, to the best
crew boss at Superior Steel, to “Sox" O'Connor.

ln Carnegie, Pennsylvania

the house on Red Row,

his wife Elnor would scrub the kitchen floor

the front porch, the steps, and wait.

Fridays the neighbors would point and call to her
up the street, “He's on his way, drunk again."
And he would come. Up the streets of Carnegie
past the mill, past the bars, pockets hanging out
from pants like deflated stories, empty souls.
The oldest son Fred would steal

what was left of the paycheck, give it to his mother
without looking into her eyes.

Sunday was mass at Saint Philips Roman Catholic Church.
Before services, Sox at the confessional pouring out his sorrow
like good Irish whiskey down the parched throat of Fr. McCashin.
Walking home, Sox would hold his wife's hand not caring

that he might be too old for this open affection.

Later, bean soup at the dining room table,

promises that some day soon, there would be enough

money to fix and mend, to stop the cold through

the dining room: wall slats, maybe enough left over.

In the afternoon sun,

he would shade his eyes with a broad palm,
look across to the mill.

On the front steps,

Sox would sip Iron City from bottles,

turn slowly each thought over in his mind
like a new coin, still shiny with promise.
Monday is a new day.

along cobblestones;
footholds in a sloping

in the names of families
blocks long

& as many languages alive:

Old man in flannel shirts

turns a crumbling corner,

cinder sculpted like stone
confluences & crests

counted as a schoolboy's game,
or as he, with finger stretched,

the monuments of historic dreams
upon which varigated houses rest:

The renaissed industrial lords

(whose diskettes depolarize

of harmonized ethnic purity)
nodded at sixty megahertz
on brick-turned-tarmac, as he
oxidized, not osmosized,
cried in the noon day street,
“Steel supports!”

his embittered consorts

of smelt-smudged, brown
beer bottle glass

swept aside by an

in-training oomputer class;

sons flayed, sons fled,

he clings to his daughter,

a child again at its mother's skirts,
stutters in a language slaugtered

by tears & years of union arguments
of bridges reflecting night

into the water.

SWEET SINGING DREAMS

Ginny Frazier
Cincinnati, OH

I was born and raised in Cincinnati with at least nine gen-
erations before me who lived and are living in this area. Even
with the bones of my many ancestors buried here, I still don’t
know much about my people. I’ve been strugglin’ to find out
about my roots. Mom has told me what she knows, but I still
have more questions than answers about who I am and where
my"people come from. I’ve been talkin’ with my relatives and
friends, lookin' at old ‘pictures, goin’ to my ancestors’ graves,
readin’ books and articles, and even askin’ my dreams and
spirit guides for help. ‘ ,

The story I’m gonna tell you shows how my ancestors
speak to me in my dreams. This dream is just one of many that
has awakened me to the power of our ancestors. This dream
helped to connect many parts of my life. It brought together
part of my ancestors’ life and struggles with my" own. It
showed me how our present and-future lives are connected to
our past. It also inspired me to‘ seek out more of the history of
the common people of Cincinnati. It helped confirm my vision
of building a movement in Cincinnati based on everyday
people taking control of our lives within our neighborhoods
and our city. The dream helped to give me some pride in the
German and Irish people ‘of Cincinnati (of which I am -part of).
It also has encouraged me to understand the forces which
disrupted the communities they had built in Cincinnati and
howthose same forces are at work today.The dream also has
shown me again, the power and strength of women that keeps
us all goin’. p .

Two weeks after the Cincinnati Community Women’s
Choir "Muse” began (of which I am an original member), I
had a dream‘... I dreamt that my Aunt Betty (my Mom’s sister)
was visitin’ my mom. She had a book she had kept for many
years, which belonged to my Grandma Wuestefeld (my
Mom’s Mother who passed on in 1974). The book was about
some women Grandma knew. The book had a picture of these
women. I had gotten the feeling that Grandma was real propud
of these women. .

When I woke up from the dream, I rolled over and fumbled
for my pen and dream Journal. I.wrote the dream down and
rolled back asleep. A few days later, I called my Mom just to
bullshit and I just happened to tell her about the dream. She
thought it was "funny” that I had the dream because my
Uncle Don (who is Aunt Betty's husband) came over a few
days before and gave my Mom an old box that had belonged
to Grandma. Excited about finding out more roots, I went to
my Mom’s\a few days later. Pickin’ through the box, I found a
small book entitled, “Mothersingers of Cincinnati". With the
book was a little pamphlet with a picture of the Mothersingers

‘ saying that they were a community women’s choir.

I have since found out that some of my Mom’s friends and
former P.T.A. buddies were members of the ‘.’Mothersin-
gers”. (Sue Schneider, Lil Erhardt, and Peg Steiling). I also
discovered that Betsy Lippett’s mother conducted the “moth-
ersingers’ ’ in Dayton, Ohio who changed their name to the
"Mamatones”. (Betsy Lippett is an original member of Muse

and a very fine musician who has lived in Cincinnati for many
years). . e

The community group that formed the ‘ ’Mothersingers’’ ,
was called the "Federation of Mothers Clubs”. My Grandma
Wuestefeld‘ was an active member in the Mothers Club of the
twenty-ﬁfth district school in Fairmount. The “Federation "of
Mothers Clubs” began in 1890 and was the beginning of
P.T.A.s in Cincinnati. ' - '

In my community organizing work, I have found that
Mothers Clubs stillexist, one in the neighborhood where I live
and where the choir, "Muse” rehearses. »

The "Mothersingers of Cincinnati” began in 1925 and they
sang mostly folk music from European countries. In the book
that tells about the choir, this is written; “There is Power in

Music that draw Folk together”. Here is th theme song -written f

by one of the founding members;

“Mothersingers”

When Mother sings,

At eventide

Beneath a lamp’s soft gleams-
Her lullaby is baby’s boat
Into the land of dreams.

When Mother sings,

A childhood task

Is made to seem like play- - 
And childish quarrels, hurts,’ and woes»
Depart in Magic way.

When Mother sings

The doubts and fears

That Life ofttimes imparts
Are‘banished,.for her cheerfulness
Puts song into our hearts.

Show me a hofne of happiness,

With strife and discord rare

And I will wager half my life

There’s a singing Mother there.
-Vera King Clark

This “choir” was the incentive for the formation of similar
groups in many cities in Ohio, and in every state, approxi- -
mately 400 similar groups. The “Mothersingers of Cincinnati”
survived for almost 60‘ years, breaking up a few years ago. The
name comes from "Minnesingers',. (“Minne” means "love”
in old 13th century German). i

As mentioned earlier, the "Federation of Mothers Clubs”
started the “Mothersingers”. The Federation was also
involved in the formation of the “Social Unit Organization".
This wasa powerful community‘ group in the Mohawk and
Brighton neighborhoods and parts of Clifton Heights neigh-
borhood where I live and have since found out that many of
my ancestors have lived.

The "Social Unit Organization” began in 1917 and was
made up of mostly German and Irish families. It was fonned
“to bring government close to the lives of people by develop-
ing the local community and by translating the problems of the
city, state, and nation into community terms which the masses

 

of people could understand and toward the solution of which
they can contribute”.~

The S.U.O. began as a demonstration of Wilbur Phillips’
ideas about democratic organization of city neighborhoods.
The initial project of the organization was a child health
program providing pure milk for infants, giving regular
checkups for infants and children, and instructing parents on
proper hygiene and nutrition for children. During the 1918 ﬂu
epidemic, the S.U.O.’s visiting nurse program reduced the
mortality rate for the Mohawk-Brighton area to less than one-

half of other neighborhoods.

The organization was unique in that neighborhood women

were paid block representatives who reported to an organized
group of doctors, nurses, and social workers what the health
"needs of their block were. This group of health professionals
;would then give of their services. Over 4,000 neighborhood

people were involved with the S.U.O., learning to take care of
their families’ health care. The organization was so successful
that Cincinnati Mayor Galvin was threatened by these com-
'-mon folk taking control of their health care. (What else would
they take control of ???). He began red-baiting the organiza-
tion calling the people Bolsheviks! (Many attacks were made
in 1920 on labor and other People's organizations during the
Red Scare). After only three short years, the S.U.O. was
destroyed.

This story of myself and my people is a story of self-discov-
ery. But not a self-discovery in a vacuum. It is a discovery of

who I am and where I stand in the struggle for all people to be

able to take control of their lives and destinies.

My ancestors, family, and friends, and Alice Walker have
given me confidence to believe in myself and my people.
After reading The Color Purple by Alice Walker, and learning
about the self-discovery that Celie goes through with her
people, it helped to confirm that it is in knowing ourselves and
our people that helps us to begin to control our lives and
futures. .

Tears came to my eyes when I read that after Alice Walker
finished The Color Purple, she had many dream visits from
people she knew before they died and from people who died

was POUR MAnsomLt.s or ‘+Ht:

270

c o-nt.bRt:~‘s PARADE

before she was born. How at her most troubled time after
writing the book, she started to dream of people she had never
heard of and never knew anything about, except in general
ways and how they gave her advice and encouragement.
“Once a dark, heavy-set woman who worked in the fields and
had somehow lost the two middle fingers of her right hand
took hold of my hand lovingly, called me ‘daughter’, com-
mented supportively on my work. She was only one of a long
line of ancestors who came to visit and take my hand that

night, all apparently slaves, field workers, and domestics, who ‘

seemed to care about and wanted to assure me. I remembered
the woman who lost her two middle fingers because the next
morning I could still feel her plump hand with its missing
ﬁngers gently, but firmly holding my own.” The morning
after her dream she wrote this poem;

The old ones

visit me

in dreams

to thank me for
The Color Purple.

They tell me
“Daughter, it’s
the best

you’ve ever done.’

I can’t tell you
how many rough
old hands

I shook.

My Mother, my close friend Steve, and Alice Walker’s
writings have all helped me to be myself and know myself.
They have helped me to not feel ashamed to use the language
that I grew up with. (I decided to tell this story in as natural
way as possible. I decided to do this after reading an article by
Alice Walker in the December 1985 issue of Ms. magazine).

 A ~.-r-'-:::"'_  , =: A -

The oppression I have felt (and still feel) because of the way I
talk (when I talk naturally) is a whole other paper (or book) I
have yet to write. I thank Alice Walker for bringing to light
that our folk language is the sound of our ancestors; and that
by using our language that was passed on to us from our
families, we help the ancestors in ourselves and others to
continue to exist.

All these connections in this story have been a big inspira-
tion for me and my organizing work to help myself and all
people to gain control of our lives.

Learning this history of my people has inspired me to
continue to express and to organize to change the many forces
in our lives that destroy our communities. (Capitalism,
racism, classism, and sexism).

Tellingyou this story helps to relieve some of the deep
anger (RAGE) inside of me, the anger towards a system that
has denied me this history of my people, that was never taught
to me in my schools or community. '

I thank my ancestors for speaking to me in my dreams (and
waking life). I thank my ancestors for giving me strength in a
system that tries to make the common people invisible, not
only in the present, but also in the past, no only to ‘’others’’,
but also to ourselves.

This story is an unfolding of my life and my people into the
web of which we are all a part of. I hope this is an inspiration
for you to search for who you are and where your people come
from.

Angel of Mercy

by David Borland
Pittsburgh, PA

(This excerpt is from a three act play about Mrs. Fannie
Sellins who, on August 26, 1919, was attacked and killed by
company deputies. Mrs. Sellins, a grandmother, was the most
successful union organizer in the Allegheny Valley near
Pittsburgh. She became a marked woman.

This play is a fictional account of her life's motivations and
her cruel and unpunished murder.)

ACT ONE
Scene 1
Time: Early on a Saturday morning.

P1ace:_A sparse kitchen of 1919. A cupboard, old fashioned
refrigerator, an old wood—burning stove, an exposed sink; in
front of a window is an old metal table with an oil-cloth type
bright red and white cover.

At the table sits a short, rather stout woman in her late 40's
with her hair pulled back in a bun. She sits to the right of the
table. Shepis staring straight ahead and sipping slowly on a
coffee cup. 9

Another woman, in her 2()’s is standing at the sink washing
dishes. She is a bit narrower than the other woman. Her
clothes are brighter, and she is obviously more aware of
appearance by her attire.

As the curtain opens, there is no talk. They are frozen as if in
a painting.

At Rise: EMMA CALDWELL is offering coffee to her mother
FANNIE SELLINS, who is sitting at a kitchen table.

EMMA: Want more coffee, Maw?
FANNIE: Yes,lwould.

EMMA: One second while I dump this grease. (She walks
over to the door. Opens the door and goes outside for just a
second. She returns and closes the door.) Damn cat’s been
here already. Get. that coffee, Maw.

FANNIE: No rush. I ain’t got much to do for a while‘. Gotta
stop at McGregors and get the Pittsburgh paper. Take your
time, Emma.

EMMA (walking to the table with a big, old pot in her hand):
Here you go, Maw. This stuff will straighten you this mom-
ing. Sure nice of yuh coming over. It’s nice havin’ you here.
Fact is, I wish you’d change your mind about staying at that

boarding house. I know what happened. I feel bad about what
happened, but Arthur feels as strong about this town as you
do about your union.

FANNIE: Emma, I’m just fine at the boarding house. This
way is much better. Besides, I can come see you like this
when Arthur is gone. We can talk. We never really get a
chance to talk. ’ '

EMMA: Maw, we never got a chance to talk. You were...
Nope, I’m not going to start that again. Let’s just talk about
other things. Soon as we start that, boom, you get mad. I get
mad, and then we stop talkin’. It’s too nice a morning.

(She comes over and sits down at the other chair, sliding her
hand along the top of her mother's shoulders as she passes
her by. Fannie grabs her hand as she passes and sits down.
She continues to hold the hand as Emma sits. Fannie pats the
it, and turns it over.)

FANNIE: Ever since you were a little girl I always thought
you had the most beautiful hands, even the slendemess of your
fingers. Couldn’t figure it out. Mine are likepegs, and your

father's hands were big, but very wide. I mean, not delicate.
Your hands are so delicate, like an ad for Ivory Soap.

EMMA: Oh, come on, Maw. Hands are hands.

FANNIE: Not these. (she takes the other hand) These are the
hands of an artisan. You should have taken that art course.
You could draw so good, Emma.

EMMA: I like to draw, Maw, but I got my life now. I mean
Arthur and the little ones. I mean that's enough for me, Maw,
really.

FANNIE: I’m sure, dear. I’m sure it is. But...Oh, I don’t
know. Everybody’s got a right to what makes them happy,

except you, I really had such high hopes for you. I know we , .

would have got you into the state university. Somehow. _
Someway. I mean I do have some money saved up. Fact is I
still got money for Charlie Junior, you and your sister. Paw
and me was hopin’ that Charlie, for sure, and both of you

might go on to the state university. Course everythings gone

haywire since your father was killed. Charlie Junior, no more
talk of him. You just live your damn life the way you want to.
I said enough of that too many times before.

(She stands up and looks out the window)

EMMA: You're not going already. You haven’t seen your
grandchildren. How come you always leave before they get
up?

FANNIE: I ain’t leaving yet and I don’t “always leave” before
they get up. I just got things to do all the time.

EMMA: Maw, could you sit down for a second. I gotta ask '
you something. -

 (she sits down again and looks right at Emma):
Somethin’ bothering you, Emma?

EMMA: Well, yes there is. Since you moved into that
boarding house, I ain’t really had much time with you. I’m
busy myself, you know. Church and stuff, you know, Maw.

Fact they got me working on the parade coming next Saturday.

You know the big parade with all the soldier boys from our

local companies. Supposed to be the biggest parade in these
parts. Almost as big as the one they had in Pittsburgh on the
4th of July. You went to that one, didn't you, Maw?

FANNIE: I was in Pittsburgh that day talkin’ to some of my
union friends and just happened on the parade. The place was
really wild. Ain't never seen such a celebration. People sure
seemed happy about that war being over. Funny part was I
kept thinking about the poor bohunk coming out the first shift
up here in this valley. No holiday for them, Emma. ‘Just more
coal dust to swallow. Oh, I'm sorry, Emma, I really am.
What’s your question?

EMMA: 'I'hat’s just it, Maw! That’s just it!

‘ FANNIE: ’I‘hat’s just what?

EMMA: Your union friends. Friends was the word you used.
You know, Maw, they really are your friends. Your only
friends. Listen to me carefully. You never really talk about
my father, and you never speak of Charlie, Jr. You always
clam up. Every time we start talkin’ about them, you just
clam up. Why Maw? Why? I’m your daughter. Your oldest;
‘fact the only one you got left. Sarah doesn’t care. You know
that. She is just a different bird. But I do! I love you, Maw.
(She is up on her feet and standing behind Fannie, and she is
hugging her) But there is something between us and I know
what it is. It’s that damn union. Iknow what you're going to
say; but Maw, I’m your daughter. Can’t I be your friend?
(She is now sobbing hysterically)

FANNIE: Oh darling, darling, Emma. You are my friend. But,
Emma, you said it earlier. You got your life. I got my life. I
had hopes for you and now you got hopes for me. Don’t you
understand? In this world you got to have something to hold
on to. Something that makes life ...makes life...alive. I
mean...Something that just makes you want to get up and do-
everyday of your life. Most people just get up each day and
work and then go home and go to bed to wait until the next
day.

I can’t wait to live, Emma. Each day is a new day. A day to
do something to help a few people in this world have a chance
for a little time to breathe fresh air spend time with their
families like I never could. Don’t you see, Emma. I: just want
them to have a little bit of living before they wrinkle up and
die before 40. (She is up again and she and Emma are now
standing toe to toe)

 

 

EMMA: But what about me, Maw? What about your ﬂesh
and blood? Don't we have a right to live, too?

FANNIE: That's my whole point, Emma. You do. You
chose this life. You met a man who you wanted to better your
life. You had a choice. These people have no choice.

EMMA: Maw, that just ain't so. They came here. Ask if their
life ain’t better than the one they left. Ask if they eat as well»
or...or have as good a house over their heads. Ask them,

Maw. Christ, you think you have to guide these people around\

by their noses. They ain't horses you gotta lead to the water.
If they don't like their life here, let ‘em go back where they
came from. That’s a choice they have—not to mess up this
little town.

FANNIE ( turning away and walking over towards the door as
if to leave): Dear Emma. Just because these people came here
like your grandparents did almost 50 years ago does not mean
they have to live as horrible a life as your grandparents did.
Do you know how Grandpa Mooney lived his life, sweet little
housewife? Do you know, goddamn it? (She grabs her and
begins toshake a bit, mildly) Do you remember any of their
stories of eating the garbage from behind the restaurants of
Bourbon Street. A French town for Irish potato farmers. Do
you know what that was like? It was awful. It killed our
grandmother eventually. Tuberculosis. We scrapped for food.
It isn’t until I met your father that I began to realize that there
might be a better or at least another way to live. These people
are here—- they mine the coal that heats this very house.
Meanwhile they don’t have coal to heat their own houses.
Does that make sense to you, Emma?

EMMA: No, Maw, no, but that doesn't mean they have to
close down the same mines so nobody has heat...I mean, can't
they do it some other way. Do you know what they call you in
town? I mean...I...I can’t even repeat some of the things they
say about you. My own mother?

FANNIE: I've heard it all before. A thousand times. Emma,
all I care about is what you think about me. Not really what
you think, but what you feel about me? Do you still care for 7
me? No...no...bad question. Look. (She goes back to Emma
and takes her.hand in hers)

» You just ask me if they could...If I could get them what they

deserve some other way. If I could do this without striking." I
think that is what you meant. I’ll tell you. If I knew it, I would
be the genius I really wish I could. Emma...Listen. (She holds
her close to her) ‘

Emma, there are two things workin' here. One is just (pause)
fairness, and two is my need...yes...my need. I said before that
life can dull you...Can just like a cake of ice...freeze into a
block so that you’re locked into the same ways until you die.
Emma, I am a free person, a free woman. (At arms

length. )...and you know something else I got...I had...(pause) I
got three children that are free too...free to live their lives as
best they see fit.

31

Emma, I love you; I love my grandchildren. (She holds a
crying Emma, speaking slowly) I love myself too, honey. I
love what your father gave to me.‘ He gave me a spirit of life;
and you got it, too, or else you wouldn't be leading your life
different than I'd hope for. Do you understand...a little?

EMMA (backing away): Maw, don't talk to me like ‘that. You
know you read to me a lot whenever you were around. I got
through school. Did real well. 1 do have a mit't(,l/Maw. . I
know exactly what you're saying. It's just not right that I'm
almost on the other side. I mean, you're union and miners
versus the town and the Company people. I don’t know
anyone from the union or‘ any of the miners. I do know
everyone in town and most of the people, at least the wives of
the Company men. You see whatl mean, Maw? We're
ﬁghtin’ each other. I don’t like that, don’t you see?

FANNIE :I see that...I know that...but you know, Emma, it
can't change. I don’t expect you to give up what you got here,
and I ain’t going to give up my fight for what I think.

(At that moment little voice are heard coming from off stage)

Sounds like your day is about to really start. Listen, I'm going
to run down to McGregors and get my morning paper. It was
a good talk, Emma. Something we couldn't do when I was
living with you and Arthur. It's better sometimes to be apart.
Sometimes people can be too close to really speak your mind.
Now listen here, just live your life. I'm fine living mine the
way I am.

(The noises get louder of stage)

EMMA: Maw, I'm working on the parade committee for
Saturday.

FANNIE: You told me.

EMMA: Well, we're meeting tonight about the music and all
that.

FANNIE (suspicious): is o?

EMMA: Well, another reason is to‘ talk about the one thing
that might mess up the parade.

FANNIE: What's that? .

EMMA: All this strike business and the fact that there might
be-a lot of trouble with the Company this week. I mean, we
got people from Pittsburgh; the Governor's sending somebody
over from Harrisburg. This is real important to this town. I
mean can't you...

FANNIE (rising anger): Can't I what? Call off the strike?
Tell my miners to forget the twelve hours for six days for
what? A goddamn parade? Christ, girl, your brother got
blown up in one week fightin’ with these boys coming
parading down your goddamn street. My little Charlie... (She

. is screaming at this point. The voices in the rear are now

crying. Emma turns to them and Fannie goes to the door.) 1'
Jesus, child. How much more ca.n be taken from me!

 

(Fannie is in tears, standing erect as
her stout figure, but she is weeping uncontrollably)

No more, Daughter, no more. You go to your goddamn
meetin’, -and-I’l1 go to my goddamn meetin’... (she opens the
door) You just don’t understand...You just don’t understand...

(She is through the door and shecloses the door as Emma
rushes Up Right to the screaming criesvof her children.)

An Excerpt from Valley of Fire: A Brief Survey
of Women in the Labor Movements in Western
Pennsylvania

by John G. Burt
Pittsburgh, PA

In July of 1 892, steel workers struck the mill of Mr. Andrew
Carnegie in Homestead. Carnegie was in Europe on vacation;
Henry Clay Frick was in charge of dealing with the striking
workers. Frick decided to utilize Pinkerton detectives,
ostensibly to protect company property in Homestead but, in
reality, to allow the plant to reopen with scab labor. A reporter
who covered the strike for Pittsburgh papers left a first-hand
account of what happened.

Arthur G. Burgoyne Sr. immigrated to the United States
from Ireland. He worked for Pittsburgh papers for over thirty
years. In addition to being a journalist, he was a poet, educator
and musician who often hosted groups of area intellectuals and
artists in his home. . '

He opened his book, published just months after the failed
ending of the strike, with the declaration that “the demand
voiced by representative workingmen in the Pittsburgh
district, not only on their own account but on that of their
brethren the world over, for a correct and impartial history of
the Homestead trouble, sufficiently explains the appearance of
this volume.” .

On the morning of July 6, under the cover of light fog, two
barges ﬁlled with Pinkerton men and weapons moved up the
Monongahela River from Pittsburgh to Homestead. Women
and men from Glenwood up to Braddock and Homestead were
keeping watch for the invaders.

In Homestead, thousands of women waited with the men,
outside Carnegie company property. Strikers were armed,
many with thirty-year old guns of Civil War vintage. Women
in the crowd carried pistols, clubs and stones. Only when the"
detectives refused to withdraw and attempted to land did the
crowd move onto mill land and the gunfire began. Hugh
O'Donnell, one of the strike organizers, directed the women
back from the frontline of fire.

_ During the day-long battle, the women cared for the injured,
removed the dead, supplied the fighting men with ammunition
and food and howled, moaned, sang and wept in all the ,
tongues represented by the immigrant mill workers.

By evening, the beleaguered Pinkertons had sustained
enough casualties to surrender. They were disarmed and -
marched in a single column to a building in the town. The
prisoners had to struggle through a gauntlet of angry women
who kicked and spat at them and hit them with clubs and
stones. Only those already injured by gunfire were left alone.

The strike committee had to provide armed workers to
protect the prisoners; the guards vowed to “shoot the next man
or woman that raises a hand against them.” The strikers won
the first battle with important aid from the women of their
families and the town.

The final battles were won by the Carnegie Steel Company.
The strike was broken with the aid of state militia. Strike

' leaders were arrested or fled. Many of the strikers were

   

blacklisted and never worked in any part of the steel industry
again. ' «

The winter holidays looked quite glum for hundreds of ,
Homestead families. Pittsburgh newspapers raised money for ' jﬁ
these families to obtain food and clothes. Notable individuals
extended help. Burgoyne wrote, “Among the most liberal
contributors was Mrs. J.M. Gusky, head of the great clothing
firm of J .M. Gusky & Company, a lady noted for her charities
and always foremost to respond in emergencies such as that
occuring at Homestead.” ' A

Esther DeWo1f Gusky was the widow of the Pittsburgh
retailer who pioneered newspaper retail advertising. Jacob
Gusky was so well known for his charitable work that at his
death in 1886, Catholic nuns, Presbyterian ministers and two
rabbis held memorial services for him. Esther DeWolf Gusky it
was a greaterlphilanthropist than her husband._ In his memory, 
she established an orphanage (now the Jewish Family and
Children Services of Pittsburgh) and a city public park
(Riverview Park). . ,

She ran the business after his death, belonged to every
Jewish organization in the city and served on the boards of
more than a dozen charities. While Mr. Carnegie was endow-
ing libraries, she saw to it that the workers who had been
blacklisted at his plant had enough food and clothes to have a
good Christmas. Although her charitable contributions totaled
hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time of her death in
1914, most of the local papers failed to run an obituary on her.

She died the same day as George Westinghouse and the
papers were filled with articles about the late inventor’ and
businessman. Her sex and her religion may have made her
unsuitable for much media attention. ' — ‘

Burgoyne claimed an additional victory for the people of
Homestead. The strike prompted Representative John Keams
of Pittsburgh to introduce into the next session of the state
legislature a bill to limit the use of agencies like the Pinker-
tons. Burgoyne noted with great satisfaction that it was passed
and signed into law by the governor. It symbolized a victory
for working people, women and men.

Another observer of the Homestead steel strike was Mary
Harris “Mother” Jones. Mary Harris Jones was an Irish
immigrant who lost her husband and four children to yellow

fever. She spent over ﬁfty years working for the rights of
laborers and was called “Mother” with great affection by the
thousands of workers whom she led in campaigns for better
wages and conditions in dozens of industries.

When asked by a Congressional committee where she
resided, she replied, “Wherever a fight is on against wrong, I
am always there. It is my pleasure to be in the fray.”

She must have felt that the fray against wrong was waged
quite frequently in Western Pennsylvania because she spent

, much time in Pittsburgh. She was present during the railroad

strike of 1877. In her Autobiography, she charged that the
arson and rioting were started by toughs employed by the
Allegheny County sheriff and local businessmen who had
grievances against the Pennsylvania Railroad rather than by
the strikers. '
She was at Homestead during the steel strike of 1892.

During part of 1895, she was in Pittsburgh, selling the socialist
paper Appeal to Reason. While making one of these trips to

34

the region, a characteristic incident occurred which was later
related by folksinger John Farrance.

While she was driving her buggy into the town of Mononga-
hela, two gunmen employed by a local company grabbed her
horse and warned her to leave town. She calmly reached
under her apron and drew a .38 caliber pistol. She told the
thugs to leave her and the horse alone. They promptly did as
she said.

Farrance said, “She wasn’t afraid of the devil.”

When the coal miners began to shut down mines throughout
the tri-state region in 1897, Mother Jones came to southwest-
ern Pennsylvania with Eugene V. Debs.

Debs was the “blue denim socialist” who wanted to integrate
black people into American society, give women the right to
vote and organize workers of every race, sex and creed. He
was a friend of miners. When the strike of 1897 started in
West Virginia and then spread to Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana
and Illinois, Debs came to Wheeling, W.V. to be at the center
of the action.

He was followed everywhere by coal company detectives
and the Coal and Iron Police. The owners persuaded a court to
level an injunction against Debs that prohibited him from
speaking on coal company property and any roadway that led
to company property.

Mother Jones and Debs had worked together before this
strike. They decided to tight the injunction and spread the
strike. Together they headed for Pittsburgh and the surround-
ing mines.

As early as Sunday, August 1, the New York Times
reported,”Much interest is being manifested in the big labor
demonstration that is to be held in Pittsburg Thursday eve-
nrng.” ‘ .

The miners had organized strike camps; some of these base
of operation were short of food. Miners and their families felt
that Mother Jones and Mr. Debs would have some answers.
They did. »

On Thursday, August 5, Jones and Debs spoke to 20,000
people at the Duquesne Wharf» They encouraged the miners
to endure, asked other workers to support the miners and
challenged the injunction as a violation of the right of free
speech and the right to peaceful assembly. They announced
their plans to move through the Turtle Creek Valley from
Pittsburgh.

On Friday night, thousands more folks heard Mother Jones
and Debs speak at Plum Creek, one of the sites of a strike
camp. A parade with bands, miners with picket signs and
groups of workers representing other industries preceded the
rally.

A reporter noted, “Handsomely dressed women stood
shoulder to shoulder with the patched and thread-bare miners.”

The next night Mother Jones spoke in Turtle Creek. She
warned that the continued use of court injunctions against
workers would lead to more trouble. \

“After a little while the American people, I mean the
laboring people, will have no rights at all,” she said. “Then
they will rise up in their might and string up half a dozen or
perhaps ten of them injunction machines....I tell you the
American people will not stand for it.”

The strike involved black miners. Their strike camps were
separated from those of whites, but Jones and Debs sought to

 

involve the blacks fully in strike activities. On Sunday night
Mother Jones spoke to a rally for women. The rally opened
with a prayer service and gospel music by a choir of black
people.

As one observer noted, “Mrs. Mary Jones, the Chicago
agitator, spoke for almost an hour, putting the case very
plainly to her women auditors. She placed the responsibility
for the success or failure of the strike on the wives and made a
decidedly favorable impression.”

For the next three months, Mother Jones moved through the
mining regions of southwestern Pennsylvania. She encour-
aged the expansion of the strike, persuaded farmers to donate
food to strike camps, held “pound parties” for women in
which each participant gave a pound of food to the families of
strikers, organized demonstrations by women and children and
exhorted more miners’ wives to compel their husbands to join
the strike.

By mid—September, it was evident that she had succeeded in
having local women emulate her example. In Plum Creek on
September 13 twenty-five women staged a demonstration and

,1

35

attempted to block the road leading to the mines in order to
prevent scabbing. Four of them were arrested.

They included Emma Has, “the Joan of Arc of the strikers,”
Bertha Haas and Annie Isha, who was dragged 200 yards by
the arresting deputies. A crowd of women, armed with clubs,
followed the deputies to Turtle Creek where the four were
held. Their obvious intent was to see that nothing happened to
the four while in detention. The next day, out on bail, they
again led women, carrying babies and clubs. The deputies left
them alone and only twelve scabs entered the mine.

Among the black strikers, Mamie Curry was working and
planning with her arm in a bandage. She had been shot in the
arm by a scab but came right back to her post. She told a local
reporter that it amazed her that the man who had shot her
received more attention in the papers than the just demands of
the miners.

A federal court in West Virginia uphheld the injunction
against Debs and other strike leaders as a legitimate protection
of the right of property. However, the miners in western
Pennsylvania did win wages, thanks to the efforts of Mother
Jones and the women who provided an unbreakable backbone
for the strike.

My brothers-—.one named for the great Venetian traveler,

The great hall at Ellis Island in 1907 with the name
“Umberto” pinned to his chest—‘-work in a chemical plant

My older brother tried to organize back in '68 but lost
Bgeight votes. That means they now work in an open shop;
That they have the right to work, the right to spit blood, »
The right to have nose bleeds and wheeze when they cough.

Brothers, do you remember the smell of our tather’s breath

When he would come home after the 3-11 shift at the conveyor
Factory, come to our rooms where we were sleeping and bend
Down to kiss us goodnight: blend of ﬂesh, grease, blue J. C.
Penney Big Mac chambray workshirt, Pall Mall smoke, exhaustion’?
Was this his blessing bestowed upon us for the life to come?

Brothers. I -pray thatyour lungs gush red; that your bones
Rattle clean and white, strong as piano keys; that you cough

‘Hearty and loud into your eighties; that you know the way

It is duringmy once a year visit is the way it always
Was for me and is the way I'll always remember it.

‘ Brothers, I pray that your houses are quiet at night;

That the only sound is the sound of your children's chests. ’
Rising and falling in the darkness of their sleep;

and that you remember to give them the father's blessing:
tleshy, greasy, smokey. . - ’

And even it we spit blood and our noses bleed,

i it we get only a little happiness from this life,

It's ok because a little grief goes along way; ,,
But a little happiness stays with us a lifetime.

The Writing’s on the Wall or Before
They Shaved the Lady

JimMWalsh
Munhall, PA

“ “...,from their ships of iron they looked upon the promised

land where surely life was sweet..." Steely Dan
I saw her first from the harbor as others must have

seen her, colossal, majestic, welcoming. Gloriously draped in
ever ﬂowing copper robes, she stood elegantly upon her
enormous pedestal and beckoned me through the morning mist
with her dazzling torch of freedom.

As I drew nearer the mist lifted and I noticed that she ’

was surrounded by a forboding concrete wall, broken only by
the endless, redwood door that lay directly before me. I cast
ashore, timidly approached and knocked lightly. While
awaiting my reception I turned and gazed wistfully at the quiet
harbor, across my gently pitching craft, and further on to the
sea. A noise interrupted me and I turned just in time to spy a
panel in the door slowly begin to rise, disclosing behind it a
large television screen. The screen radiated and green words,
illuminated by a dark background,'suddenly appeared. The
words were of another language, confused, I knocked again.
As if answering, the green words changed. Again I knocked,
again the green words changed. I continued knocking until at
last, I understood. I put some money into the slot beside the
door, it opened.instantly.

The chilly, damp fall morning hung heavily in the
neatly pruned trees that dotted the Island, and bracing myself
against the unexpected cold, I zipped my jacket to the neck
and humbly entered. Lulled songs of barkers unseen, vending
their wares-greeted me, “get your ‘God bless America’
balloons and your ‘home of the free’ tee shirts here”, they
sang. I moved toward the Lady of a million dreams along a
freshly paved asphalt walkway. Broken whiskey bottles, rusty
cans and crushed cigarette butts littered the way.

Up close, I saw her as an impressively large statue,
covered from her broken chains to the top of her unlit torch

three lines so that the sonnet now read:

“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled

masses yearning to breath free,
A unless they are niggers, spics,  micks,

Stunned, I entered into her hollow foundation.

I rode the elevator to the top of her pedestal and then
slowly began my climb up the spiral stairway that wound
distantly to the windowed crown. Graffiti stained her inner
walls and as I climbed upward I read the scattered offerings.

on the chain announced that the torch of freedom was closed

red eyes. The windows were rendered almost useless by the
thick coating of soot on the outside and the smudged finger

The Man Who Longed for Rainy Weather

Bill Pyda
Imperial, PA

It was seven-thirty in the morning and Cab Brodka
was out on his porch sharpening his scythe with a whetstone.
Some kids walked along the road in front of Cab’s house.
They were on their way to the honor roll to wait for the school
bus. The kids waved to Cab, even though he was disappoint-
ing them. They wished he’d have already started scything the
grass around his house because if he had, they’d have stopped
to watch.

Old Cab often gathered an audience when he picked
up his scythe and went to work. He took such smooth, even
strokes, and when he finished the top of the grass would be
perfectly level. Seeing this amazed people. Lawn mowers did
just as nice of a job, but they made a lot of irritating noise.
Cab’s scythe didn’t make a sound.

Cab was in his eighties; and though his work still
looked good, hewas getting real slow. It took him three hours
to scythe the grass in his yard, and this was just a small piece.
He also cut the grass in front of the honor roll; and when he
felt up to it, he walked up

. the hill and scythed the grass in front of the cemetery. Rainy

days always made Cab cheerful because wet grass scythed
much nicer.

Like most of the old timers in Ludlow, Cab was a
Slovak originally from Central Europe. Over fifty years ago,
Cab came to this Western Pennsylvania town to work in the
coal mines. The mines were booming back then, and he had no
trouble getting hired.

Young Cab Brodka was a short, thick muscled
“Hunky,” with an exceptionally strong back. He couldn’t
speak much English. but he could sure swing a pick. Cab went
down into the coal mines and dug at least a half ton of soft
coal each day. And he hated every minute of it. He couldn’t
stand breathing coal dust all day long; and then when he came
out after putting in a twelve hour shift, he had to walk home
with his face pitch black and his clothes wet from the damp-
ness inside the mine. No, this just wasn't right. After a few
months of it, Cab decided that he’d dug enough coal, and he
quit.

None of the other miners could understand this. Sure,
coal mining was hard work and dangerous too, but it paid
better wages than any of the other jobs available. They figured
it wouldn't take long for Cab to get hungry; he’d soon be
coming around trying to get his job back.

But they werewrong. Cab’s coal mining days had
ended. He’d made up his mind and he planned to stick to his
decision. From now on his work would be done outside, not
down in some dark pit.

Cab walked out to the Pennsylvania & Lake Erie
Railroad yard and asked about a job. The man who did the
hiring looked at Cab’s thick arms and said, “We could sure
use a guy like you on our labor gang. You'd swing that thirty

pound sledge with no trouble.” The man stopped talking and
shook his head. “But you see, we don’t need another gan-
dydancer, at least not right now.”

“That's too bad,” said Cab.

“I know it is. Damn it anyway.” Again the man
stopped talking. An idea came to him, and he smiled. “Listen
friend, I've got a job for you, but it’s not with the labor gang.
We need a man to scythe grass along the railroad tracks. It’s
piece work, but once you catch on you'll make out all right.
Why don’t you take. this job, and when there's an opening, I'll
put you onthe labor gang.”

Cab took the grass cutting job; and though he had
many opportunities, he never gave it up to join the labor gang.
It took some practice, but in time he learned the proper way to
use a scythe. He found that if he picked up on the blade when
he pulled the handle back to take another stroke, he chopped at
the grass and it turned out very uneven. But if he kept the
blade level, instead of picking up on it, the grass ended up
smooth and straight.

There were some steep banks along the railroad
tracks. Cab always started at the bottom, scythed the grass
above him and worked his way up the hill. At the end of the
day he’d be cutting grass up top where the bank leveled off.
He had a real« good view of the sunset from up there.

Most of the trains nrnning along the tracks were open
top cars loaded down with coal. After it was taken into town,
run down the chute and cleaned, the coal was hauled into
Pittsburgh, for use in the steel mills. The miners often climbed
up onto the coal cars for a ride back to town. Some days
they’d be sitting up there, all black faced and worn out front
another shift in the mines and they’d look back towards West
Virginia and they’d see Cab, standing high on the railroad
bank, swinging his scythe while the sun set behind him. The
miners were making more money than Cab, but they spent a
good portion of their wages on strong lye soap.

Cab didn’t have a wife, and he didn’t own a house.
He rented one of the bachelor shanties on the edge of town.
Cab courted women whenever he got lonesome, but he never
got lonesome enough to consider marriage. He was deter-
mined to stay unattached. '

Some of the women he courted felt differently.
They’d make nice suppers for him, and while he was eating
they’d sit down beside him and tell him how much they liked
children.

But first they needed a good man. Cab could always
tell when a woman had marriage on her mind, and he never
wasted any time getting out of that particular relationship.
Then he’d want to forget, and the best way for him to do that
was through the work he liked to do so very much. These
marriage-crazy women were responsible for Cab getting a lot
of extra grass cut.

The township supervisor noticed what a nice job Cab
did with the grass along the railroad tracks. He asked Cab to
come to work for the township, cutting grass along the streets
in town and up at the cemetary. Cab took the additional work,

 

 

The Woman with the
Honda Civic

Ruth Latta
Ottawa, Ontario

Tom didn’t like thelook of her. Gazing out the
kitchen window of his parents’ home, watching Tommy Jr.
and another kid throwing the basketball into the hoop over the
garage, he saw her pull into the driveway, bringing the Honda
Civic up close, a fraction of an inch away from his Buick
wagon and Dad’s Chevy, as if she owned the place.

She reminded him of Eva, with her bold stride, and
the way her cotton pants outﬁt billowed around her. Eva had
the other two kids for the weekend. The woman went ‘round

the house into the backyard to the party. ' 

Tom carried the ice-ﬁlled tub of beer out to the picnic ?
table. His parents were having their annual garden party/
barbecue. Mom called it the first, Dad the second. Mom was
at the far end of the yard showing the roses to some of her
friends from the church. With a beer in his hand, Dad stood
with one foot up on the picnic table seat, talking to the
newcomer, laughing expansively.

“Tom!” he said. “Come and meet Amy. Amy, meet
my son Tom.” His huge arms thrust out as if to bring the three
of them together in an embrace. “Tom, you remember I told
you about Amy. She’s the one from the union office who
thinks this old geezer’s memories are worth recording.”

“Well actually I'm from the university, but the union
is making a generous contribution to the research.” The
woman extended her hand, cool on a muggy July day. Tom
squeezed her fingers harder than necessary, but she didn’t
ﬂinch. He was glad he had worn his new shirt.

“Memoirs of people in organized labor, right?”
Amy's eyebrows shot up. Predictably she did not let Tom's
statement stand, but enlarged upon it.

“You tell him, Amy!” Dad exclaimed grinning. “He
thinks it’s all archaic.”

The old man continued to beam at her references to
skinnishes on picket lines of the past, events he dimly
remembered from his childhood. He could remember Mom up
in the night crying, cleaning up the cuts on Dad’s face, and
how broke they were the week before the big strike was finally
settled. Dad’s war medals were his cauliﬂower ear and broken
nose, for which he steadfastly refused plastic surgery, even
under Medicare.

A couple of retirees from the plant came up to greet
Dad. Turning to them, he left Tom with Amy, who continued
describing the project.

“Old labour battles make colourful reading, I
suppose,” he interrupted. “Of course in this day and age we're
in a whole new ball game. The service sector predominates.
There has to be cooperation from labour if industry is to
compete in world markets.”

..4..;a..u: ..... ......,... ..u....._ ....,,..t. .._

cf'F/ '~‘'*/ ’‘“'I‘‘’

When Amy frowned she bore a striking resemblance
to Eva. “I disagree,” she said ﬂatly. “Withdrawal of services
is a vital tactic to use as a last resort, if ordinary people are to
have any control at all over their working lives. Your father
sees that.”

Tom shruggea. “He’s sixty seven years old. What
more need I say?”

“Well, perhaps we should change the subject.” She
spoke challengingly. .

“What business did you say you're in? Computers?"

“I’m a systems analyst.”

He was planning to excuse himself when an elderly
couple joined them. It turned out that Amy belonged to the
same political riding association as they, and soon the three
were deep in conversation.

Tom liked the old couple, friends of his parents, even
though he thought they were out of date politically. He
listened, waiting for an opening. wondering if Amy aspired to
public office. She looked the type, talking, gesturing, passing
opinions, running every show, though some of them, like Eva,
couldn't even run a household properly. Though the tradi-
tional family was dead. Why fight it?

People likethese old folks, like Dad and Mom,
married for forty years, were a near-extinct species. Inertia
kept them together, not any positive motivation. His parents
led parallel lives, Mom with her United Church Women and
volunteer work; Dad at work, or, now that he was retired,
engaged in this latest project, the trade union history book.
Not much in common any more. -

He wondered if Amy was married. No ring. Probably

not. That air of self-absorption would rule out intimacy with
another person. Eva's look. Roseanne had that look too, come
to think of it. The memory of their telephone conversation the
previous evening ﬂashed to mind, causing a sudden ache
behind his eyes.
Sitting out on the apartment balcony watching the

city‘ skyline after Tommy was asleep, he had dialed her
number. It had been a great opportunity to have her over or go

to her place, with two of the kids with Eva. Tommy could stay a

with his grandparents and go to their party. He waited for her
eager acceptance.

There had been a pause. “I don’t think we’re ready to
get closer,” she said. “I get the feeling you’re not over the
breakup with your wife. I get enough punishment in life
without taking what's aimed at someone else. You~need to go
through a few more women before you come to me.”

When had he ever criticized her, he asked? Roseanne
cited a few instances. Tom said if she couldn’t take a joke
maybe it was better if they took a break from each other.
Though he kept his dignity, she had been cool and resolute,
and the memory stung. Now, in his parents’ crowded back-
yard, he realized he was scowling and changed his expression.

Glancing around, he noticed several women Mom
had invited for his appraisal. She considered them ‘nice girls,’
eligibles. Tom wasn't interested. They were egocentric types
like Amy, or refugees from a marriage with a couple of kids in
tow.

Dad was back in the group; they were talking about
the trade union history project. “I got out some of those old
photos and clippings you wanted,” his father said. “Why
don’tI get them now before I forget.” Smiling, greeting
people, he edged his burly ﬁgure through the crowd and
disappeared into the house.

Tom watched Amy's eyes follow his father. What

' was her game? The old fellow’s life hadn’t been that interest-

ing. He couldn't figure her out. Perhaps it had to do with the
local riding association. Dad was a member at large or
something; maybe she needed his support in her quest for
candidacy. When a shift in the crowd left them more or less
alone, he confronted her. .

“What's your motivation?” He felt gratiﬁed as her
smile ebbed away. “You can’t enjoy listening to old men
ramble on about their lives.”

“I’m a historian...”

“Don't give me that. There’s something more,
something in it for you. Right?"

. Her eyes were stone grey. “You’re right, Tom. I
confess. The truth is, I have the hots for your father.” Tom was
stunned. His outrage grew as she continued. “In a minute I’m
going to follow him into the house and we'll slip out the back
door, go for a drive, park, and make mad, passionate love in
the back seat of my Honda Civic. Now, if you'll excuse me...”
She wheeled and strode toward the house.

“I think everything’s going well, don’t you?” Tom’s
mother said, suddenly by his side.

“Yes. Fine.”

“Son, I want you to meet Dorothy’s niece Caroline.”

41

 

As soon as he decently could, Tom eased away from
his mother's circle and went into the house. The downstairs
bathroom was occupied so he headed upstairs. He had washed
his hands and stepped into the hall, when he heard voices from
his sister’s old room, now a utility room with a sewing
machine and a filing cabinet.

His father was speaking. “You’d be disappointed.”

“No, I wouldn’t!” Amy spoke, passionately, insis-
tently.

A pause. “We can’t. I’m ﬂattered. I wish I could but
there are too many reasons against. And you’d be disap-
pointed. You want a younger man.”

A laugh, then a sob. “It’s this history project. Back
then was a better time, with better—people. I guess I want to
share in it.”

Tom went down the stairs quietly for a man in his
prime.

Dear Mill Hunks:

I'm interested in contributing a traditional ‘A
or two to the Mill Hunk Herald. It seems
appropriate that you might want to compli-
ment new writings by workers with previous
forms -- tale, legend, anecdote, yarn, ballad,
ritual, etc.

Here's an anecdote which I have carried in
memory for many years, "How the Union
Came to A1iquippa." I would hope that some
reader in your region might have heard
something similar, or might comment on
it.C1ear1y this story takes different forms as
it moves across trade, gender, and ethnic
boundaries. '

How The Union Came To
Aliquippa

(Told to Archie Green by Emory Bacon,
Stee1worker's Union staff member, at
Madison, Wisconsin, during a 1959 labor
education. conference.) '

During the Blue Eagle period (1934-1935),
the old Amalgamated (Association of Iron,
Steel & Tin Workers) came to life in West-
ern Pennsylvania. Formermembers rejoined
their AA lodges and new members began to
sign up. However the Aliquippa plant was
very tough. The bosses scared most of the
workers by threatening them if they joined
the union. .

One day, Pete, an Italian puddler, felt '
rough and went home early. When he got to
his house and opened the door, he found it
very quiet. Looking around, he found the
mill boss in the bedroom humping his wife.
This enraged Pete; he beat up the boss,
tossed him out of the house; walked down to

A The next day, he organized his gang. These
men soon spread the good word through the

    

whole plant. And that's how the union came
to Aliquippa!

FLASH-BACKS

the 30's in West Virginia I was sent to investigate a letter
that the office’ had received. Our outﬁt had wired the whole
area for the first time and this mountaineer, in his crudely
written letter, was complaining about “burning his hands”.
Right away, I ﬁgured a faulty “back-ﬂash” switch or box
socket. The cabin had only three rooms, I opened up the
wall switch and it was wired perfectly, I couldn't have done
a better job." I then went to the next room and snapped on
the light but no light came on. However the man was right
behind me. He had unscrewed the light bulb in the kitchen
and began screwing it in the living room socket. The living
room switch and socket was also an A-1 wiring job. I then R
went into the bedroom and he was behind me with a light
bulb to screw into the bedroom socket - then it dawned on
me - this poor mountain man had only one light bulb and
screwed it in and out as he went from room to room. Well,
have you ever tried unscrewing a light bulb that has been
burning for hours? I gave him a pack containing four light
bulbs. Case solved

Homestead’s Historic
Landmarks: Are They
History?

Randolph Harris
Homestead, PA

There’s a statue in front of the National Archives in
DC. Perched there is sotne character doing a great impression
of a Roman god. But it’s the line inscribed on the pedestal
that applies here:

“The heritage of the past is the seed that brings forth
the harvest of the future.” ‘

A major threat grips the industrial wasteland of
Homestead, PA, and it bears directly on the display at the

v Archives. The once proud cradle of the American steel

industry may be on its way to oblivion. If the town’s labor
history is ignored or forgotten, what’s left of the town may

well be. . .history.

There are two historical buildings in Homestead
endangered in a large part because the two groups which
should be ﬁghting to save tliem—-groups which have the

. money to do it and are strong representatives of labor and

capital—are readying the hammer blows for what could be the
final nails in Homestead’s coffin.

Last known as the Original Hot Dog and a state
lottery outlet and closed in 1983, the Bost Building is the only
known existing structure directly related to the infamous
Homestead lock-out and strike of 1892 and the steelworkers’
fatal battle with the ‘union-busting Pinkerton Agency.

Standing on Homestead’s once bustling East Eighth
Avenue and eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places, the Bost Building was used as strike headquarters by
the union that tragic summer of ’92.

The Tri-boro Credit Union—what most viably
remains of the steelworkers union at the Homestead Works,
the for'rner employees’ credit union——is ignoring this building
in its plans to develop new office space in the town. The
Credit Union’s present office is bursting at the seams, but the
organization must remain in Homestead as their federal
charter restricts them, for the most part, to pull members from

V certain Mon Valley towns.

Sitting on assets of about $40 milion, most of which .
was acumulated by their brother (and later sister) steelworkers
since the formation of the Credit Union in 1935, the boys who
run the organization don't seem to have much interest in their
history.

, Most of the directors are former steelworkers, and all
but one of the nine are middle aged or elderly. Ironically, the
youngest board member (who never worked in the mill) is the
only strong voice of support to invest the Credit Union’s $1.5
million capital development fund into the Bost Building for
use as a main office.

All the other eight will say to anyone, publically at
least, is, “We want a new building.” They choose to press

ahead, in a truly tasteless fashion, to construct a sleek metal
and glass, slope-roof bank building right in the middle of
Homestead’s early 1900s business district.

If they bought and historically restored the Bost
Building, the Credit Union would be housed in a timeless
memorial to the people who struggled and built the town.
Federal tax credits toward a restoration effort as a national
historic landmark would also no doubt be available.

Then there's the old USX employee parking lot
behind the Bost Building, extending about three blocks off
Eighth Avenue to the first set of railroad tracks before the mill
property begins.

If the credit union bought and restored the Bost
Building, there. is little doubt that a deal could be arranged to
lobby USX to unload that land for a song; and local, county,
state or federalgovemment or foundations could be lobbied
with letters and proposals for funding to develop this land as
an outdoor historic park for labor and industry, under the
control of the state or federal government.

There are tons of mill machines and artifacts that will
most likely be scrapped if no one says they want them, which
could be installed on this site. Examples of worker housing
could also be rebuilt as a walk-tlirough lesson of what it was
like to live and work in the dark ages of the industrial revolu-
tion.

The other building at issue is a downright magniﬁ-
cent structure, a monument to Andrew Camegie’s generous
philanthropy, or some say, his soul-wrenching guilt at what he
did to his workers in Homestead who made him the “Steel
King.” -
It is, of course, the Carnegie Free Library of Home-
stead (actually in the adjacent Borough of Munhall), endowed
in supposed perpetuity ‘by “Little Andy” in 1901.

Will Homestead’s library go the route of those
Carnegie Free Libraries in Duquesne and Braddock? All three
were originally operated by the same endowment that remains
today to operate the Homestead facility, what’s left of the
Carnegie/Frick empire, USX.

These three libraries were unique to Camegie’s
philanthropic enterprises because the industrialist not only
catne up with the cash for the bricks and mortar (not to
mention tons of marble, wrought iron, oak, ceramics, pianos
and organs), but he also set up an endowed operating fund.
Only the Homestead Library remains intact of the three he set
up under these tenns.

 

 

 

 

The libraries in Duquesne and Braddock were cut
loose by USX over the last two decades. Through a lot of

~ negotiations that never really saw the light of day, the com-

pany foisted the buildings into the hands of the ‘towns’
respective school districts. The results were and continue to
be obscene.

, Bigger than Homestead’s and with equal features,
Duquesne’s library was leveled in 1968 with some vague 0
school district committment to build a new gym for the high
school across the street It was never built. The demolition
company made out like a bandit in salvage rights. Today a
cluster of suburban tract houses sits .on the site of the once
incredible building.

Braddock’s library, the first ever built by Carnegie,
still stands but in sad shape, hanging together with bits of cash
and a lot of sweat by a handful of local folk, the Braddock’s
Field Historical Society. Headed by the building’s last
librarian, the group bought the building from the Braddock
School District for a dollar after that body was not able to
demolish it as they planned to build a high rise for the elderly
with federal funds.

USX wants to unload the responsilbitiy of admini-
stering the endowment which operates the Homestead Library.
The place is not only an architecutral gem, but it has served
generations of Homestead residents as the virtual heart of the
community. It incudes, in addition to a great library, a huge
pool and gym, a finely appointed music hall, a club room and
the intangible, unmearsureable memories of thousands of local
folk. - ‘
On October 14, 1987, some top legal and financial
types from 600 Grant Street got together with representatives
from the towns ravaged by USX’s recent plant closings,
people of municipalities like Homestead, Munhall, West -
Homestead and West Mifﬂin.

Chief USX spokesman William Gregory told the
group his company had neither the time, interest, ability or
money to run Camegie’s ‘free to the people’ library in
Homestead (the endowment now generates $100,000 a year,
according to USX).

The meeting broke up with a plan to form a small
group (6-10 people) of representatives from the larger group
which attended the session to meet directly with USX repre-
sentatives and report back to the community. The company's
plan is to tum over the responibiltiy for administering the
library endowment to a group of community leaders. Sound

 

45

 

familiar to Braddock and Duquesne?

USX has already turned over financial responsilbility
of running the endowment to none other than Mellon Bank ’
and its trust department Haven't we been barraged with
headlines lately about this pillar of the world financial
community and its portfolio of shakey loans all over the
globe? ”

The USX folk say they and their corporate predeces-
sors have been benevolent over the last century since they
have been adminstering the endowment, even though Carnegie

’ did not legally bind his company and its successors to do so.

But what does the endowment document say about this?

At the recent meeting, one former local councilman
noted cryptically that a few years ago he and some colleagues
asked USX representatives if they could see the endowment
document. They were denied access. ‘

The United Steelworkers of America was formed in

- the early '40s after decades of iron-ﬁsted company control

over virtually every aspect of the lives of the people who
worked in the grime and dirt and heat of the mills. Many’ view’
the 1892 struggle in Homestead as bringing about the 40-year
non-union era in the American steel industry. ‘

The victory by the union and the townspeople in the
Battle of Homestead on July 6, 1892, was shortlived. Within
months the union was broken, Union leaders were charged
with murder in the deaths of Pinkerton watchmen. When
those charges didn't stick,they tried them for treason. Same
result.

Many union leaders were blackballed. Some, \
including the burgess (mayor) of Homestead, ﬂed the state and
even the country to avoid further harrassment.

After the clash, it remained bleak for about 40 years
until the mid-’30s, the time when the Steelworkers’ Organiz-
ing Committee took off, about the same time as the Home-
stead Works Employees’ Credit Union appeared to offer
workers a way out of the bondage of company stores and
company held home mortgages and company control.

All during this period and through to today, the
Carnegie Library has stood on the hillside overlooking the
now silent mills, the same hillside where most of the 8,000 PA
militiamen camped throughout the summer of ’92, holding
Homestead hostage to the will of the company at the points of I
bayonets, mortar and cannon.

The Bost Building and the Carnegie Library are
outstanding components of a prosperous future. With insight-
ful planning and heavy consideration of Homestead’s history,
this town could have a bright future based on its close geo-
graphic location to Pittsburgh, a ﬁne stock of mostly intact,
turn of the century commercial and residential architecture and
some great down to earth people.

Add to this the possible reuse of the shutdown mill
property and you have the ingredients that may begin turning
things around.

A healthy realization of where we’ve come from can
be achieved by preserving what physcially remains to tell the
story of the amazing events and the people who shaped them
nearly a centruy ago.

LET’S NOT DESTROY THE SIGNS
OF OUR HERITAGE

By Mike Bilcsik
Pittsburgh,Pa.

lt’s been three years since they shutdown the mill where I,
my father, and his father" had worked. It was the end of an
era that started when my grandfather came to the Mon
Valley straight from Ellis Island.

I remember how my mother used to lecture me as a child.
“Get a decent education so you won’t have to work in the
mill.”

Meanwhile, my public schooling was preparing me for the
life of a steelworker. The electric shop classes I took in high
school were designed around the maintenance of the plant I
could see out the window. The equipment I learned on was
from the mill. Even my shop teacher came from a mill
background.

I did well in electrical work, and went onto get an advanced
education in electronics, good enough that I wouldn’t have
to work in the hard, dirty environment of a steel making
plant.

When it came time to start my work life, I applied at the
mill, telling myself that it would only be for a couple
months.

I remember my first day, walking into my new work
environment just before dawn and seeing the smoke and
unearthly light given off while a blast furnace belched out a
fresh cast of hot molten iron. It was my ritual to manhood. I
finally witnessed and became a part of that hidden life of a
Steelworker. I remember going home that evening, and how
my father couldn't disguise his pride because his son was a
motor inspector in the mill. I never thought much about
leaving the mill after that, because it was part of me. And I
was part of it.

My story can be repeated thousands of times by the many
men who were multi-generation steelworkers. We had our
own culture, made stronger by the similarities in our
individual backgrounds.

There are thousands of people in the Pittsburgh area just like
' me. I've just recently gotten to know people from the

Beaver Valley. The biggest difference between the Mon and
Beaver Valleys, I’ve1eamed, are the company logos painted
on the sides of the mills. The people are quite the same, as
are the churches, the clubs and bars, and even the looks of
the communities.

When I was active in labor negotiations and got to meet
upper management people from the world of corporate

 46, .

headquarters, I discovered that we did share some feelings,
even though we disagreed on how to build a better steel
industry. Some of these people were as culturally and
emotionally involved in the steel industry as we workers
were.

I have occasion to drive past my old workplace every now
and then. When I first catch sight of the smokestacks, it
brings home to me the importance of why we must not let
the memory of our own unique culture perish.

I and many others like me have tried to interest the upper
power structure of our Pittsburgh area community to
preserve some of the more interesting artifacts of our area’s
industrial heritage.

We’ve all learned the same thing. The most inﬂuential of
our community want to tear it all out, and maybe place some
of the more quaint relics in yuppy shopping centers.

Nothing is to be left in the communities where this culture
developed. It's as if removing all signs of our great indus-
trial heritage will help them forget the anguish caused by its
collapse. .

 

 

I have a hard time accepting that.

Many people from different backgrounds are in agreement
that a “grass roots” project should be organized, for the
purpose of preserving an abandoned blast furnace for our
heirs. Twenty years from now, it will be perhaps the only
sign left of the mighty industries of the Mon Valley.

If a project like this was undertaken, it would attract wide
media attention, which would play up its human interest. It
would be a positive reﬂection on our community, for a
refreshing change. It would excite its citizens, and change
the lives of those lucky enough to participate directly in it.

An industrial age blast furnace turned into a museum would
become a tourist attraction, and provide an economic
resource for the host community.

It is very likely it could be made self-sustaining and would
increase employment in the area.

A most beneficial product would be the pride it would bring
to the people of the Mon Valley.

It would be a gift to our heirs. A reminder of the industry
and culture of the Mon Valley that allowed our nation to win
World War 2.

This restoration should use the labor of men who once
worked in these plants to do that rebuilding.

There are untold thousands of displaced industrial workers
in the Mon Valley. Many of these people have valuable
skills, but haven't made the transition back into a productive
work life, for a variety of reasons.

. People who do not quickly move into new employment

 

47

when they lose a long-terrn high-paying job they thought
was secure, feel tremendous amounts of rejection and loss of
self esteem. The resulting apathy is a defense against the
reality of their own personal tragedy, which isoften over-
whelming. «

After they run out of unemployment checks, some go to a
life of welfare and minimum wage jobs. Their self esteem is
pennanentlylost. So are they.

Pilot projects done with hard core unemployed people have
veriﬁed my own personal observations. If these people get
their self esteem back, a majority will go on to ﬁnd long
term employment.

A project was done in Akron, Ohio, with hardcore unem-
ployed people being recruited into volunteer work. This
volunteer program was not designed to turn into jobs. In
spite of this, 64% of these people went into active employ-
ment. It happened through feelings of increased self worth,
which fueled their motivations.

If a public works project was undertaken to preserve some
of our more interesting industrial history, you can be certain
that presently unemployed and retired industrial workers
would want to be a part of it.

You would be able to recruit a lot of volunteer help, in
addition to creating short term esteem-boosting jobs for
people most likely to beneﬁt. s

Project costs could be supplemented by appealing directly to
the community. There are a lot of people who have a high «
degree of emotional attachment to our industrial heritage
and would gladly contribute from their pocketbooks.

A Disappearing Act

Kim Day
Boise, ID

It was on a Saturday that Jack Powers disappeared.

T'helate-night kid had been at the radio station since
midnight and was bored. He’d watched the meters for ﬁve and
a half hours, and now his back was sore and his ears were ‘
ringing from the coffee and the music. There was a half '

"V finished bag of dried fruit next to the phone, and news copy

was scattered with the remains of yesterday’s paper. He turned
and watched Powers. Powers had the computer printout in his

 hands and was turning the tape racks, looking for the numbers

of the songs he’d be playing that day.
“You’ve been in town for a long time, haven't you?”
Jack pulled one of the tape cartridges out of the rack
and looked up. “I guess I have.”
“You used to work at K-TRIP.”
“I was manager there for a couple of years.”
‘‘That’s great. It was a great station. I really miss it.”
“That's nice. I miss it, too.”
“You played off of records there, didn’t you?”
“Uh-huh.” He was pulling all the tapes for a six hour
show, stacking them in a studio window. Eighteen tapes for
each hour, each hour stacked beside the next.
‘ “Boy,” the kid was saying. “The good old days of

radio, huh? I bet there are only a couple stations in the country
3 that still play off disc.”

. “Pretty rare these days.” Powers tried not to sound
tired, but kids like this made him feel ancient. The technology
changed so fast. He was only 31 and had started when he was
this kid’s age, and now talking about the work was like talking
to kids born before JFK, or the Beatles or cigarette commer-
cials. Jack felt it must be the same meeting foreigners, when
all you have in common is ﬂesh and blood, but share no
culture or the things you recognize in yourself as being
human.

‘ The kid was still talking. “It’s sure nice to have you
come in early. Everybody else wanders in after the news starts
on the hour.” '

“Old habit.”

“So what's the story on K-TRIP, anyway?”

“Got sold. New owner put up a satellite dish, ﬁred
everybody except the salesmen and some minimum-wage
grunts to push buttons.”

“That’s a shame. It was a classic.”

“Yeah. It was.” He finished stacking the tapes in a
neat‘ row. He left the studio and went to the coffee room. He
poured a cup and lit a cigarette. He turned off the overhead
light and looked down on the dark city below.

He hated Saturday morning shifts. Two or three pairs
of headlights could be seen on the streets. It would stay that
way for most of the day. He always felt alone in a studio
anyway, talking to himself for the beneﬁt of a hundred or a
thousand people. Or maybe none. Maybe no one bothered that
morning. On weekday shifts there was at least the consolation

48

   

radios were tuned to his station. On weekends there weren't
even cars. ‘

He wandered back to the studio and took the program
log from the night kid. He counted the commercials scheduled
to be run and made sure he had a tape for each one. Some- -
times, like on a Saturday, it was hard to remember ever being
excited about coming to work, or thrilled when he could pry a
story from an old-timer. _

“I was once ﬁred over an ‘r’ .” That was the way Bill
Matlock started stories, with a wide-eyed excitement, as if it
had happened moments ago. “I was hired to read ﬂour
commercials on a coast-to-coast broadcast in the forties. And
this script said, ‘The best cooks in the county use Miller’s
Flour.’ Well I kept looking at this script. This can't be right,
I’m thinking. So I’m standing in front of the microphone,
remember this is live, coast-to-coast. And the engineer points

at me for my cue. So I give it my best: ‘It’s time for the Miller
Flour Hour. Remember. The best cooks in the country use
Miller’s Flour.’

“So I’m off the air maybe 60 seconds when this guy
runs up to me and says, all serious, ‘There‘s a call for you. It’s
NEW YORK.’ The agency guy called and I was ﬁred before
the end of the broadcast.”

The commercials were all there. He went into an
adjoining room and checked the equipment for the other
station the company owned. Tapes and equipment were
clicking and purring. The computer screen told him that
everything was working ‘fine. It always was. Never missed a
cue, never caught a cold, never showed up late, never had an
off day, never had a favorite aunt that died and had to go to the
funeral. I .

The owners loved their automated station. “Cost us
just $84,000,” the CEO would say. “You know what we would
have spent in salaries and benefits in a year? Plenty, that’s
how much.”

The automated station was their pride and joy. Now
that it was getting better ratings than the “live” station where
Jack was working, they puffed and cooed over it like never
before.

He gave the machinery a light kick and walked back
to the studio.

“You ready?” the night kid asked.

“Make it hap’n, Cap’n.”

A song was fading. The studio went silent except for
the headphones. The “mike on” light ﬂashed and the kid gave
the station ID. “... and stay tuned for Jack Powers and more
great mtisic following news.” He touched a couple of buttons
on the console and Jack could hear the network news over the
station monitor. 0 _

Jack grabbed the first hour’s music and set it near the

 

 

 

   

console. He spun the commercial racks and pulled the car-
tridges by number, just as he had the music, and stacked those
carts in the usual place where he could ﬁnd them in his sleep.
He scanned the weather forecast, checked the temperature,
looked for new memos, adjusted his mike level, put on his
headphones and waited 60 seconds. He grabbed two music
carts and plugged them into their players, then ﬂipped a switch
that would let them play one after the other automatically. 30
seconds. No local news this morning. “The research,” said that
people just wanted music on Saturdays.

He cleared his throat, watching the second hand
move. The network announcer gave his cue. Jack turned off
the network and turned on his microphone in a single motion.

“Good morning. It’s six-oh-six at Fabulous 58. I'm
Jack Powers, and the Fabulous Forecast looking for ....” He
read the forecast, gave the temperature and hit the button for
the first song.

He opened the morning paper. The song was playing.
At the end the next song would start automatically.

He pulled out the sandwich that he’d wrapped and
stuffed into his jacket the night before. He ate it slowly,
reading the paper carefully. As each set of songs ended he _
would plug in the commercial carts. They played automati-
cally as well. He would give the time and temperature, the
forecast, then a line that he’d memorized from a sheet in front
of the mike. “It’s 6:25 at your first choice for sports action,
Fabulous 58.” He remembered to emphasize “58” as he said it.

, When he was done with the paper he wandered
around the station. He turned up all the speakers in the offices
to make sure the music was still playing. He looked out
different windows, watching people walk past on the streets
below, looking into empty offices in neighboring buildings.

On these long shifts his brain and body seemed to
ache. People seldom came in and he would find himself
clearing his throat more and more to make up for the long
stretches in which he was silent.

He felt uncomfortable and empty with this kind of

‘ radio. It was so dry. Impersonal. The old guys. They knew.

That’s why they left. He longed for that time. A time when his
business was actually a part of something when it offered

I warmth, and dignity, and responded to people as human

beings rather than dayparts and demographics. Now he was
only part of a talking jukebox.

At the last station he realized he might be wrong for
the business when the new owners arrived. They called him
into the office on the day they took over. He sat at a table with
the two men who ran the corporation. They were both named
Bob. “B-B Broadcasters” was the name they chose.

“Jack,” said one of the Bobs. “Radio is changing
everywhere.”

“Tell me about it, Bob.” He said it to both of them.
“Costs are skyrocketing. Ad revenues are down. And the
previous owners here....Well, it’s a wonder they kept the place
running for as long as they did. A wonder they could keep the
doors open at all.”

“They always treated me well, Bob.”

“The thing is, Jack, we need to make sortie major
changes. Now that we’ve had a chance to crunch the numbers
and look at the bottom line, we're starting to see that we can’t
run this company the way it has been run.”

49

 

 

“We’ve cut expenses everywhere possible, Jack,”
said the.» other Bob. “The only thing left is staff.”

Both Bobs looked at him with sad eyes. He thought
they looked like wounded puppies. He thought that’s what
they wanted him to think. They had this aura which screamed
“Give us your sympathy.”

“Are you telling me I’m ﬁred?”

“Please understand that we don’t want to do this.”

“It really hurts us to the quick,” added Bob.

“Tell me.” A *

“Pardon?” P

“Tell me that I’m tired, Bob.”

“You’re fired, Jack.”

desk.”
“I’ll get it for you, Jack.”

He decided to stay in the city..He’d lived there a long 

time. He had a girlfriend. People knew him. It wasn’t the
town, he decided. It was just radio. Maybe he would think of
something else’ to do. He had thought about it for about four
months when he ran across the manager of “Fab 58” at a
coffee shop.

said.

After his first show Jack went into.the manager's
office. The manager looked up from his paperwork.

“Hey. Heard your show. Have a seat.” The manager
liked to feel like “one of the guys.”

Jack sat across the desk from him.

“Not bad. Not bad.” The manager looked like he was if A

searching for some forgotten name. “I guess if there was a -
problem it was that it was really  talky.” He looked at Jack to’
see if he’d made his point.

“I though you hired me to talk."

“Oh. Sure. But we're a music station.” He held up a
bundle of computer printouts from his desk. “That’s what
people say they want. Keep it short with lots of ‘service
elements’ like time, temperature, weather. You know.”

Jack stared.

“We’re just not a personality station,” the manager
said.

Just another stranger, Jack thought. Like someone
you’d meet in a bus station. Or a salesman at your door. Nice
weather, there’s this stuff I’d like you to buy. The company
had him do lots of commercials. His voice was selling
something in almost every commercial break.

He began turning the racks of commercials, looking

' for the ones with his initials. All the tapeswith his voice he

put in a separate pile. It was a good-sizedpile. He tried to

figure out the amount of money the station had made from the T .7

pile, but the numbers slipped away from him. '

He went to the other room where the automated
station sat.

He did the same thing there, making a stack of the

tapes with his voice. He gathered them up and took them into . 

the other studio. He cradled one of the tapes in his hand and
then eyed a machine on the counter.

He slipped the tape into the machine and pushed a -
button on the from. There was a loud grinding noise and then a
light on the front of the machine flashed. The tape had been

   



but he sure had to put in some long hours to get it all done.

The housewives in town started asking Cab to scythe
the grass in their yards. Cab didn’t say no to any of them. But
still, he had to wonder how he’d ever find the time to do all
this grass cutting. He decided to start swinging his scythe a
little faster. Cab almost always took his shirt off when he went
to work scything grass. Most of the housewives in town went
out of their way to catch glimpses of him.

He always had such a good suntan, which added
something to his well defined muscles. He wasn’t a bad
looking guy either. When Cab walked into a yard and started
scything grass, the neighbor ladies came outside and hung
clothes on the line. And about every ten minutes they came
back out to check on the clothes. A lot of clean windows were
washed whenever Cab came around. One lady even insisted
that Cab come into her kitchen for some lunch. He ate the
sandwiches she made for him; but when she invited him into
her bedroom to look at the new curtains, Cab said no. He
hunied outside, finished with the woman’s yard and left
without getting paid.

A farmer who claimed to be in bad trouble told Cab
that he needed his help. The farmer’s tractor had broken down
and he was left with a whole field of uncut hay. He wanted
Cab to cut the hay with his scythe. Cab asked the farmer why
he didn’t get some other farmer to cut it with their tractor.

“'Ihey’re all too busy with their own hay. The ﬁeld's
pretty big, around seven acres, but I know you can cut it with
your scythe.”

Cab agreed that it could be done, if only he had the
time to do it. The farmer was desperate. He pleaded with Cab.
He offered Cab ﬁfteen dollars and a whole side of beef. This
was a field of timothy: his best crop.

“I’ll try,” Cab finally said, “but I won’t make any
promises.” There was a full moon that week, and Cab took
advantage of it. Each night he worked in the ﬁeld until after
midnight. He was always too tired to make that three mile
walk out to his shanty, so he’d pile up some hay and sleep
right in the field. It took him six nights to cut the entire field.

Lyn Ferlo

The farmer was most grateful. He gave Cab what he’d
promised, plus he threw in two chickens and three extra
dollars. ‘

During the winter months Cab didn’t do much. The
township hired him to shovel snow, but this was only part
time. Cab spent most of his days hunting in the woods around
town or just sitting beside the warm stove in his shanty. He
could have gone back into the mines, for just a few months,
but he never did that. He always had enough money saved up
to get by.

Cab aged better than any of the coal miners. At
seventy he could still put in a full day’s work, and his body
stayed ﬁrm. At this age most of the miners were finished.
They were too worn out to enjoy their retirement. The coal
dust had ruined their lungs, and the damp mines had crippled
their bones with arthritis. The same men who once thought
Cab was foolish for quitting the coal mines now looked upon
him with envy.

The township and the railroad didn’t buy any grass
cutting machines until after Cab retired. Then they had trouble
finding someone to run the machines. Nobody from town
would even consider taking the job. Cab Brodka had always
cut the grass, and he’d cut it with a scythe, not with some
noisy, dangerous contraption. ,

Some guy from out of town took the lawnmower job.
He couldn't understand why people were so unfriendly to him.
The women got angry and yelled if his machine threw stones
in their yards, and the kids were always kicking over his gas
can. Cab still scythed a little bit of grass. He was Ludlow’s
oldest citizen, and he kept this position for a long time.

Cab’s heart finally gave out, and he died in his sleep.
He made a ﬁne looking eighty-ﬁve year old corpse. His face
had hardlyany wrinkles. At the cemetery some of the towns-
people looked at Cab’s freshly dug grave and remembered that
a week earlier he’d scythed grass in the exact same spot. They
wondered what Cab would have thought. He always got mad
if anyone messed up his work.

erased. His voice was gone. ‘

He plugged each of the tapes into the machine. When
he was done he put them all back in their proper places.

He went through the entire station, erasing everything

with his voice: cassettes, reels and cartridges. Then he started

hunting for things with his name on them. He found a bottle of

. white-out in a desk and began blotting out his name where .

ever he found it.

His replacement showed up at a little after noon. Just
like the night kid had said, after the network news had started.
Jack waved and smiled without speaking and walked out the
door. He rode the elevator down and went to a diner nearby.
He ordered lunch and as he was waiting he asked the waitress
to turn the radio to “Fab 58.”

“I work there,” he explained.

She turned on the radio and he listened. The an-
nouncer gave the time, temperature and forecast. Then, in the
background, he could hear a button being pushed.

There was ,a long, silent pause followed with a clatter
of plastic cartridges and another button. Again silence.

_ Jack turned and nudged the man beside him. “Hear
that.” He pointed to the silent, hissing radio. “That's me.”

The man stared for a moment and then moved to the

far end of the counter.

“Le’ me just show you the shrapnel in my leg,”
Steve, the Burns Guard on the late shift at the garage, said.

He rolled up his blue cuff to his knee. Hls leg was
skinnier than l’d have thought.

“Steve, I’d like to read,” I said for the second time
that night.

The downtown stores had closed, and it was pure

reading time at the garage. I’d promised myself no more long

hours listening to Steve.

“Oh, you want me to leave,” he said, his upper lip
actually curling. “Okay.” And he started away. He was a
great kidder, but he looked serious this time.

“Hey, just a second,” I said. “Don't get mad. It’s
just that I want to read—’’ ‘ . ‘

He went trooping off, leaving me feeling so bad I _
could read only at about half steam. Actually, I liked Steve.
Plus, in the past few months, I’d been talking him out of his
Rambo views. He seemed like a loner, but he was always
telling me about gangster friends back in Chicago. And now
he had them in Nonh Beach where he’d worked in a dirty
book store.and then as a barker in front of a topless joint. He
talked about them as though there was a connection between
the mob and Vietnam, where he’d been a green beret.

I imagined Steve now giving me the same obvious
cold shoulder that he gave to another parking attendant who
had insulted him.

He came by my booth again, his toes ﬂying out with
the long, stiff-legged stride he used when he was mad. He
kept walking. I thought how I'd been his buddy. He could
talk to me. I cared. And then I cut him off at the pass.

I tried to concentrate on my reading, gave up on the
book in my hand and reached below for an easier one. He
came by again almost immediately, walked by me ten feet,
made an about-face and looked me right in the eye. He looked
and I looked. Then he broke out into his giant grin and came
over to me.

“I caught you,” he said. “Both times when I walked
by you weren't reading. You feel bad about what you said.
Right? And you're worried I’m mad at you, right? Well, I’m
not. I like to read too. But sometimes I just want to talk, you
know?” .

He regalcd me with more war stories and gangster
stories and pornography stories. And we both felt great.

 LAYING RAIL

, In the chilly light, sharp and clear,

if standing awkward in the trackside grasses

 y where the glittering dew wets their cuffs,

looking silly in their ties and jackets,

5 it was mostly bosses

acting busy with their walkie-talkies.

The morning sparkles. .

Down by the machines, things are humming;

The work train backs and forths,

the crew comes in in dribs and drabs.

They laugh and joke, open faces, open hands, '
grabbing and touching and pushing and hugging,
picking up hammers and claw bars and wrenches,
knocking oft C-clamps and pulling up spikes,

 T spinning oft nuts, poking out bolts,

on hands and knees,

backs bent, backs straight:

the business before business. ' ~
Everybody trusts, everybodyknows what each can do...
As the morning shadows shorten

work spreads out along the shining rails, _

white and blue before the orange hats giving way.
Twelve or thirteen guys '
line up beside a bar, ’

by sight and voice assembled

not by memo.

They work together because there's work to do,
and they know together what it is,

and they know together how to get it done.

The innocence of labor has nothing to do with money:
pay cannot explain their energy, their willingness to get things done.

its ‘ squealing like a new chalk on a fresh blackboard,

A high pitched like panicked mice who know they're going to die,

 and fwham, fwham, fwham they tie it down.

up and down, up and down like picking melons.

They pace themselves, speeding up, slowing down,

behind the wide gauge threader on its double set of wheels,

pushing the wide-gauged older track aside, riding on the narrow new.

The standard gauge threader spreads the new track
out

to the fifty-two inch standard:

at every fourth tie a spiker tacks the rail.

it's a furnace in the cuts:

the_rail heater’s along only for the _ride

in these mercurial eighties. .

The gauger, liner and spiker does a final gauging job:
the spiking crew nails down the rail for good.

The crew's spread out,’ a quarter-mile now.

It rains-rail anchors as the shadows start to lengthen:
the rail anchor renewal machine knocks them into place.
Then the rail greaser and the welding crew-

‘ in the sand—packed molds around the rails,

making perfect welds with molten steel.

In the low sun the members of the crew

stand like gnomons ‘

clustered into chatting groups like homing birds.

. The track bends out of sight without a break,

running west into the sun beneath thebridge.

Crammed like cattle in a truck- ‘

off to their camp of trailer homes.

It cannot be a rich life,

no matter that I want it so...

Most of the men, married, with kids, get home

Others aren’t so lucky.

Six bucks an hour-steady-is all it takes to wrench them from their homes:

MONOLOGUE FOR A WORKER AT THE DEFENSE PLANT

Michael Snyder A
Pittsburgh, PA

Alarm clock rattling. 6:00 A.M., Monday. One more timel ask myself, as I do especially on Mondays,
about the boyhood dreams——Roy Rogers, Prince Valiant, Robin Hood, Honest Abe Lincoln. The good guys never
worried over Monday, off to make a living. Doing my good deed as husband and father, but as a man?...blessed
with eyes, ears and a heart that winces and bristles, stung in the too-clear sight of the mind that imagines: the
world swirling vicious and suicidal, snared in the human fungus, lust for power. What ancient or cartoon hero,
what son or man who wants to be good, whatever that means, gives honest labor to this madness?

I don’t know. I had no choice when my mother gave me life. She fostered my small boy dreams when I
couldn't know they are dreams, splendid, certain to suffer. She gave love which nourishes hope for a better world
when I couldn’t know that love and hope are the only motive not to die gracefully, young and pure. I give the
same to my children. Across the hall I hear them breathing. I want them to have peace. :4 ’

I want them to know life straight and true like oak trees from the acorn to the sky uncompromised, un-
hunched. I spin away the precious days, harvest of my blood and love,‘ in this job that is a job——the awful truth of
it—1ittle worse than any other in this free country.

America, the wages of your love are war.
Oh god, please give me strength to know
your purpose in this fragile hour of our earth.

. CIRCLES AND CYCLES

David Biles
N. Charleroi, PA ,

(The following in excerpted from Screwwheel of a Life on the
Mon, looking for a publisher)

Slowly, gropingly, at times painfully, I became one of them.
I entered the world of towboats. I became a rivennan.

I learned of straight locking, double and triple lockings,
setovers. I used quarter lines, swing lines, jockey lines, breast
lines, lock lines, upriver and downriver lines. I learned the use
of fore and aft wires, the why of breast wires, wing wires,
stern wires, jockey wires, scissor wires and face wires.

After a while, the ones I worked for called me a deckhand.

Then I set about to learn the river, pool at a time, from
Emsworth on the Ohio, the first pool on the Mon, to the last
pool up, Opekiska that contained the head waters, the Tygart
and West Fork Rivers that came together to form the Monon-
gehelaz the River with the Falling Banks.

’ During the days, plying the coal and stone trades, the towns
we passed along those falling banks were quiet signs of
another existence, another way of life. At night their lights
were thrown against the somber hills, each an identiﬁable
constellation glimmering through the darkness.

The boats were a job but more than that, a way of life: two
weeks on, one week off. Circles and cycles.

Slliklk

The two weeks were spent making tow, picking up and
dropping off the coal, stone and cement barges. It was two
weeks of diesel fumes, dust and stack gas, of walking on steel
decks that sizzled in summer and were so cold in the winter
that damp leather soles froze to them, of rain, sleet and

’ shimmering sun.

It was a sobering, monastic life where you were constantly
surrounded by the grumbling roar of the engines and at the
thumping of boat and barges.

Some of the two week hitches were spent riding, the hours
spent at menial tasks: checking and pumping water from

. barges, mopping ﬂoors and scrubbing toilets. There were

lanterns to be cleaned, ratchets to be greased, lines to be
spliced and gunwales to be shoveled.

It was a dull, boring existence whose monotony was broken
only by the sweat of hard work in the landings, digging
through barges to get a specific numbered one, coaxing it into
tow with the others and then tripping the locks because of the
rage of high water.

Off watches were spent watching the towns slip lazily by,
reading anything and everything from Ambush at Torture
Creek to Zen in the Art of Archery. _

The cooks made you steak on Saturday.

It was making up tow at five in the mornings in the cool
spring and the aroma of brewing coffee and frying bacon
drifting across the barges; coffee, hot and steaming, while
riding a long pool through a winter drizzle. In the summer
someone always managed to come up with a few beers in the

long evenings.

The hills seemed to turn to fire in the autumn, and that
always brought an uneasy feeling: winter was close and
closing. A

Winter was the worst. There were times when tearing apart
a tow, in the cold months, when eight pound sledge hammers
and fire axes on four foot switch handles had to be used to ’
crack the ice from the lines while the bitter wind caused the
body to shake and quiver until the muscles ached in the
interminable nights dotted with glaring spot and ﬂood lights,
tempting you to step into a dark shadow that could be a
missing hatch cover or a place where the barges hadn’t come
together. ‘

Up with empties and down with loads. Up on the point and
down in the bend as the white ﬂare of sun stalks across snow
gray skies, its silence broke by the shotgun blast of plastic
lines snapping bones and the popping crack of broken wires

‘slapping into ﬂesh and you carry old men off tows they had

walked too long with sprained muscles that didn't want to

' work anymore, that stared up at you with dulled and dimmed

'56

 

eyes that had squinted for.too long into the hot sun and glaring
lights.

Winters die hard on the river. They bring spring rain to
their wakes. That brings high water and closed locks and a
rust colored river raging between banks that can't hold it, and
barges break loose from their moorings, and landings wash out
and then the rain stops. The water slowly recedes, and the
towns and fields dry out, and the river returns to its eroded
banks and things got back to what could be called normal.

It was dull and monotonous and exciting: clocks forever
ticking and time forever gone. You might wave to a deckhand
on a passing boat in the glow of a summer twilight and see a
certain sadness cross his face.

Rivermen wave a greeting with both arms.

closed negotiations with the sky

and grace poured on my head like

I don't remember smiling or sleeping though I'm certain

I I did both

for they came to me again in blind darkness
and swung me in a spiral to the bending
spread of stars and

rolled me in the vaulted palm of their soft
sister Faith

Unmentioned in the Times

Larry D. Peel
Eighty-four, PA

Dr. Nichols says I have to write down how I feel
about things since I won’t talk to her about my daddy. She’s
supposed to help people who feel bad, but I feel fine. It’s just
that people keep saying my daddy did something wrong, but I
don’t think he did. He just tried to take care of us like he
promised. Anyway, Mommy says I have to keep seeing Dr.
Nichols until she fixes what’s wrong with me.

Dr. Nichols always asks me if I'm mad at Daddy. I
tell her I’m not, but she doesn’t believe me. I used to be mad
at him when he was always working and I wished that he
didn’t have to work so much. When he got laid off, I thought it
was my fault, but Daddy said I had nothing to do with it, it just
happened.

When Daddy was laid off for good, it was real hard
having him around all the time. When he was working, he and
I and Mom and Jennifer used to do things together. But when
he stopped working he said, “I don’t feel like it,” or “We don’t
have the money.” He wouldn’t even take us out on the boat.

We got the boat when I was seven. Daddy said that
since he worked so much overtime, he deserved to use some
of the money for his days off. It was a nice boat. It had chairs,
a gas engine, an electric motor, ice chests, and lots of other
things. Daddy and I never caught many fish, but we sure had a
good time.

When the mill closed for good, not just laying some
people off for a while, Daddy sold the boat. He said we
couldn’t afford it any more and it was either the house or the
boat. After that he sold Mommy's car, too.

Daddy used to talk to me about grown—up things, like
who was going to win the Superbowl, what kind of car we
should buy, and stuff like that. The first time he was laid off, it
was nice because he was home all of the time. But when we
started not having any money for things, Daddy got real mean.
He hit Mommy sometimes, and Jennifer and me too. And he
started swearing a lot, even using the “F” word.

The worst times was when Daddy went to the
unemployment office. He only went to tell them he still didn’t
have any work, but he was gone all day. He said they treated
-everybody like dirt, made him stand in line all day, and acted
like it was his fault that he didn’t have a job. He’d come home
and start drinking whiskey and beer, then he’d get real mad
and break stuff. Mommy took us over to Uncle Ed’s when that
happened.

I think Daddy broke things because he was too old to
cry. One time, right after he sold the boat, he came home and
didn’t drink anything. He just sat at the table and stared at the
wall. Mommy was working; she and Daddy had a real big
iight about that, but we had to get money somewhere. After
Jennifer and I went to bed, I heard funny sounds downstairs. I
pretended I had to go to the bathroom and went down.

When I looked around the comer, Daddy was still
sitting at the table, except his head was down and his hands
were over his head. He was shaking and making sounds like

AT THE CROSSROAD5...

he was laughing, but I don’t think he was. I ran back upstairs
so he wouldn’t see me. I guess he was upset about the boat
and Mommy working and the unemployment office.

I asked Uncle Ed about it, and he said Daddy was
upset because he couldn’t support his family. After the
unemployment ran out, we didn’t have enough money to live
on. That’s when Mommy got the job working with computers
- she did keypunching, and Daddy got even meaner.

He looked for a job all the time, but he couldn’t find
anything. Either it was already gone, or he wasn’t right, or
somebody’s brother got it Daddy said it was because he
worked in the mill for fifteen years and people didn’t think he
knew how to do anything else. .

Daddy said the mill closed because of all the foreign-
ers, and because the people who ran the mill were just out to
make money and didn’t care about anybody else. Uncle Ed
said it was the union’s fault for being greedy. He and Daddy
argued about it a lot. One night they had a big fight, and
Daddy told him to never come back. And Uncle Ed didn’t
come back until Mommy called him a few weeks ago.

When Uncle Ed came over, Mommy gave him all of
Daddy’s guns, even the deer rifle Daddy said I could have
when I was old enough. Uncle Ed said not to worry, he’d save
it for me. After what Daddy did, Mommy won’t allow guns in
the house. So I’ll have to wait for the riﬂe until I leave home.

The day it happened, Mommy told me to keep an

‘ eye on Daddy because he was drinking whiskey again, and she

58

had to go to work. Jennifer and I were left alone with Daddy,
and he just sat at the table again, staring at the wall.

We watched TV for a while, then Jennifer had to go
to bed. Daddy came in the living room and said he wanted to
talk to me; He looked real funny like he might start breaking
things, sol said yes, and we sat at the table.

Daddy talked about how if anything happened to him
I’d be the man of the family and not to worry about money.
Most of the rest didn’t make sense. Then he told me to go to
bed, because he had to go out for a while.

I woke up when he came home. I listened for a while
in case he started breaking things, but he finally came in and
kissed me good night. So I went to sleep and didn’t wake up

until Mommy screamed.

I jumped up and ran down to the bathroom. Mommy
was standing there screaming and pointing at Daddy. He was
in the bathtub kind of slumped down, and his eyes were open.
I went over and looked. The pistol he used for targﬁt practice

"was lying beside him and there was blood and gray stuff all
over the wall. There was a big thick board in back of his head,
.. and later they found a bullet in it. I guess he didn’t want to

crack the tiles. . —

I’m the man of thefarnily now, just like Daddy said.
Mommy got a lot of money from the insurance company, so
he was right about that, too. After the funeral, some people
told Mommy she should send me to a doctor so I wouldn’t
grow up hating Daddy for leaving us. That's why I have to see
Dr. Nichols twicea week. ,

Nobodybelieves me when I tell them what Daddy
did was all right. He took care of us as long as he could, and
when he couldn’t, he left. But he still took care of us. Now we
have new school clothes, Mommy has a new car, and she. says
we might even get a new boat. So Daddy made sure we have
everything we want, and nobody else could have done any
better. '

EXPERIENCED ONLY ‘NEED APPLY

Savina A. Roxas
Pittsburgh, PA

October, 1935 was not the time to look for a job, or ’

so Papa kept telling Mary. But all the Bronx could think of or

talk about was the Recovery— the WPA jobs, thousands of
them, skilled and unskilled, for people on Home Relief. Even
Charles Soloman, the WEVD Socialist commentator, admitted
that unemployment had taken a breather. Retail sales were up,
new cars multiplied on the assembly lines: Mary believed the
radio news. '

Not Papa. “See,” he’d say, spreading the New York
Times across the kitchen table and wetting his ﬁnger on his
tongue to turn the pages. “ ‘Situations Wanted’ by unem-
ployed stenographers, columns of them.” Then he’d count
aloud the number of Help Wanted Female ads. “Nine,” he’d
say. “Experienced only need apply.” Convinced it was no use,
Mary decided to give up trying.

She wore a yellow cotton dimdl skirt, a sleeveless
white blouse, what had once been white sneakers, and no
socks. Much too summery for this time of the year, but what
did it matter? She had no place to go.

None of her friends had stayed home after high
school graduation. They’d gone out to get any kind of job they
could find or they’d gone to business school or college.

Lillian was working as a finisher in a Seventh
Avenue dress factory. Papa didn’t like that. He said it was a
mistake to get a job outside your own field. You'd get side-
tracked, lose your skills. As for college, he said it wasn’t for
girls. But Sylvia and Clara, who lived in the building, were
commuting to Hunter College. Papa didn’t want to hear about
It. - I
Often, Mary sat at the bedroom window that faced
the street and watched the girls all dressed up in plaid skirts
and dark blazers, walk up the street to become a part of a
bigger world that she too wanted to join. Papa’s mind was
made up. She was to stay home, keep house for him and the
boys. Not that he didn't want her to marry. Far from it. In the
old country Italian way, he expected her older brother to bring
home a friend who’d marry her. Angry, the top of her head
ached at the‘thought of living like a recluse, a pawn waiting to
be moved. If she didn,’t get out of the house she’d explode.

At the front door, her white sweater over her shoul-
ders, Mary brushed the cat out of the way and went out into
the street to go through her daily routine of escape. First the
public library, then Nedick’s for a hot dog, and then Arthur
Avenue to shop for dinner—spinach and eggs— cheap and
healthy, she fumed as she walked down the hill on Tremont
Avenue. ,

The library was on the ground ﬂoor of the municipal
building. Life was dull, she sighed. Not the way it was when
she and Clara had roller-skated down this long hill empty-
handed and then struggled back up with armfuls of books.
Clara had no need for the library now.

Mary went to the travel section and took a book by

 -m-e~..,.,... 

Richard Halliburton from the shelf. At her favorite round table
in front of the window that looked out at the fountain in
Crotona Park, she opened Seven League Boots and lost herself
in Afghanistan. After miles of adventure, she raised her face to
feel the warmth of the sun.

Dutifully, she returned the book to the shelf, as the
librarian arranged newspapers on a table. Mary took a copy of
the Times put it under her arm and went back to the round ,
table. From force of habit, she opened to the “Help Wanted
Female” section and saw that "Experienced only need apply”
choked each ad. As usual, she thought, and how unfair. No
chance to show anyone how good her shorthand and typing
were. Instead she’d stay home and wait. For what? she
moaned.

With a jolt, Mary realized there was something
different about the last ad in the column, the seventh one
down: “Clerical and typist; act as relief operator, plug switch-
board, must be tireless worker, good personality. WILL
TRAIN. No experience required. $5.00. Moe Levy & Son, 949
Broadway (23rd Street).” She traced ‘No experience required’
on the palm of her hand as if getting ready to cheat on a test.

She read it aloud, like a poem in front of the class and
self-consciously looked around to be sure the librarian hadn’t
heard her. Then she returned the newspaper to the table in the
shady part of the library and read the ad again to be sure it
wasn’t a mirage. No mistake about it, bold and clear, ‘ ‘No
experience required.” Back at the round table, reality grabbed
her more quickly than the cloud that obscured the overhead
sun at that moment. Papa! He’d find a ﬂaw in it, make her stay
home. Much as she tried to resign herself to defeat, there was
a bubble of hope. It swirled in her, light and delicious as a
chocolate soda.

Taking a piece of scrap paper from the librarian’s
desk, she copied the ad. Evidence for Papa, real evidence that
there was a job waiting. With a chuckle she wished she had
roller skates with her just for the fun of it.

Before leaving the library she checked out a book on
job interviews. Mr. Bruce had talked about that at thesenior
seminar, the importance of the job interview. She left the
library, the book in her hand, and Mr. Levy in her mind telling
her how impressed he was with her skills.

Walking along, she kept glancing at the book.
Walked right past Nedick’s, on Arthur Avenue, shuffled
through the many shoppers and push- carts, forgot why she
was there——should have been on the El going downtown for
an interview. A

The book advised looking directly into the eyes of the
interviewer when answering questions. The man at the
pushcart piled high with leafy spinach asked, "How many
pounds?” Looking directly into his eyes, she answered, “Six”
and at the fruitstand she did the same thing. With the feeling
of perfecting her technique, she went into the comer grocery
store for bread and eggs, paid the man, put them in her
shopping bag, then decided to try out the firm handshake. She
picked up her shopping bag with her left hand, extended her

Part-time, the Pits at Pitt

Jane Flanders

Pittsburgh, PA

The University of Pittsburgh, in line with a nationwide
trend, relies heavily on cheap, part-time, non-tenure-stream
faculty for stafﬁng basic courses, enriching the curriculum,
“ﬂexible” responsiveness to enrollment ﬂuctuations and for
cutting costs. But change could be in the ofﬁng. Part-timers

 at Pitt are in the midst of a bargaining campaign to be repre-

sented by the United Faculty (AAUP/AF'I'), which is promot-
ing their demands for better salaries and working conditions, '
beneﬁts and job security.

Who are these part-timers? Over 1,000 part-time instructors
taught at Pitt during 1987; however, their ranks keep chang-
ing, as tumover is high. While hard statistics are hard to come
by, a larger proportion of PT are female and fewer hold a PhD
than full-time faculty. However, there is no justification for
"paying part-timers with equivalent qualiﬁcations a fraction of

' the full-timers’ salary for equivalent work.

-« -Salaries vary widely among departments, even within de-
partments, ranging from $900 to $2800 per three-credit
course, with a rough average of $1700. Instead of annual
raises, part-timers often receive a ﬂat rate year after year,
which means that their pay actually shrinks with inﬂation.
Beneﬁts are usually nonexistent, except- for partial health
coverage (only while teaching).

Some part-timers have departmental mailboxes and office
space and are invited to department meetings, while many
others do not enjoy such recognition. About 80 percent report
having no voting rights in the departments in which they
serve. ‘

Often part-timers piece together a living wage with a series
of part-time jobs. As academia’s “gypsy scholars,” many
teach at several different institutions simultaneously, while

    
 

 
 
 

never reaching the salary they would receive with a regular,
full-time appointment at any one. Many others have full-time
nonacademic jobs, but take on a course or two as an overload.
This important group covers lawyers, journalists, musicians,
real estate brokers, even executives and administrators, who
enrich Pitt’s curriculum with the expertise gained in their other
work. Still other part-timers have no other paid work.

How did it all start? The part-time ranks began to’ till about
fifteen or twenty years ago, when the baby boom was swelling
enrollments and the large numbers of MAs and PhDs made it
easy tostaff classes with instructors variously and euphemisti-
cally called “adjuncts,” “temporaries” and “visiting lecturers.”
While conditions have changed, the system is well entrenched
today. Across thecountry, an estimated 40 percent of all
college anduniversity faculty are part-time.

A major complaint among part-timers is the lack of job
security. Although Pitt salaries began to improve somewhat
after part-timers began to mobilize and to air their complaints
publicly in the mid-1970s, nothing essential has been done to
change the tenuousness of the part-timer’s “career.” Part-
timers are kept waiting in the wings, “temporary year after
year. They provide a convenient cushion to accommodate
last-minute changes in enrollment (although many depart-

. mentscan estimate rather accurately how many sections they

will need to,,staff).— They may be called to teach within a few
days of the beginning of a term. If scheduled in advance, they
may be bumped if a full-time professor’s course does not fill.
Rather thatirtuming away tuition dollars, the school can turn
away the instructor hired on this condition.
Given the situation, part-time teachers obviously cannot

control their professional development in a given field. They '

have little choice as to what they can teach——they may cover
the same course year after year, or they may never teach the 
same course more than once or twice. This undermines their
career development their sense of professionalism.
The part-timers’ exploitation is bad for morale, and it is easy

to stigmatize anvictimized group. Yet most part-timers are
responsible, good teachers despite the degradation of their

working conditions. Moreover, they perform essential
services to the university by preparing students in basic
reading, writing and math skills without which students cannot
advance to higher-level work.

In fact. regular professors sometimes confess that they
simply do not know how to teach students needing remedial
aid. Remedial training is often performed by specially
equipped, experienced part-timers.

Regularizing part-time faculty, giving them pro-rata salaries,
contracts. better working conditions and some control over
their professional development would vastly improve the
quality of Pitt's faculty morale and Pitt's service to its students
and the community. Pitt has just celebrated its bicentennial
with much pomp and ceremony. It should extend the dignity
usually associated with the teaching profession to all who ﬁll
its faculty‘ranks.

I have a life in motion
As well as otherwise,
My mind is carried away twice a day.

The field at the crest of the hill

From the hills by the Harmar Mine

Plumes of grey mist float in green hollows.
Two tugs wait on the lock’s long wall

While a third maneuvers a covered barge,
A green lozenge pitched at a slight angle
in the dark water of the lower chamber.
The Indian lady at the bus stop

is wearing a new sari, paisley red and blue.

These daily images are linked in my mind

With the thought of your leaving,

Crossing the country in early June.

Surely west of us somewhere you will find

The same farmer's field hillside river valley town.
Think of me then, let your mind carry me

As mine carries you.

ACME ORGANIZED

Rick Peduzi
Pittsburgh. PA

The need to carry forward the labor rnovement’s
historic mission — to organize the unorganized — has never
been more apparent. ...The best organizer is often the rank
and ﬁler who can speak honestly about life as a UE member
and the kind of union we are.

- from “Organize the Unorganized,”
A a resolution adopted at the
52nd UE Convention

“Why did I do it?”

“Because I like doing what I did. I’m a worker and I
think all workers should be organized.”

The workers Freddie Harris talked to desperately
needed a union. To put it mildly their working conditions
were very bad. The company, responding to a strong union
organizing campaign, used all of its usual weapons. Intimi-
dation. Disrespect. Blatant threats. Fear. And a great deal
of arrogance. _ _ .

But when the election was held, the campaignhelped
by rank and ﬁle UE members was more than a match for the
company’s tactics. Support came from shop leaders such as
Harris and Local 1421 Pres. Miguel Canales, who came
front Los Angeles, along with others who shared their
experiences about being members of the union.

“Unorganized workers always like to hear from
workers who have been through the same things,” says

Harris, president of Local 1154. And, according to workers
at.Acme Die Casting, hearing from UE rank and ﬁle
members made a difference. . _
Three times in the past organizing drives had been
held at Acme. Three times they had failed. Yet this is a
shop where workers tell stories of low wages, dismal wage
increases, supervisors “screaming” at them to work harder,
people being laid off and replaced by others, no seniority
and being stuck in jobs with no chance to bid on others.
“Everything those people do is unbelievable,” said one
worker about the company, telling how, in the past, water
had been cut off in the morning before work and in the
afternoon after work. “We couldn't even wash our hands.”
Many workers wanted the protection of a union.
Some were worried about the company's scare mongering,
including a tlueat to do away with their proﬁt sharing plan.
Acme worker Mamico Aguirre says some workers, coming
from mostly small Mexican towns, were afraid of losing
their jobs; that they did not know very much about the union
and some had experienced unions that “did not do anything
for us.” .
About an hour and a half away from the Chicago area
plant where Acme workers toil in sweat shop conditions, is

‘62

mg 505.5, /5 £4 GEEEDO ./as/<0...
1.575 657'‘ OPG4/V/ZED

another die casting plant. Wages are radically higher,
benefits much better and grievance, seniority and recall
rights are in place. Workers have a proﬁt sharing plan. And
the employees at Badger Die Casting in Milwaukee are
members of UE Local 1112.

The two shops are very similar in what they make and
how they make it. Both produce zinc and aluminum
castings and the machines are similar - often the same.

‘Knowing the similarities between the two shops and
the threat Acme had used in the past to do away with the
proﬁtsharing plan if workers voted for a union UE Field
Org. Terry Davis and Intl. Rep. Tim Curtin asked members
from Local 1112 to talk with the Acme workers.

“They were all cars. We couldn't tell them enough.
How we work, what we were making ——- everything from
quality to job classiﬁcations,” said Mike Riedberger,
president of Local 1112. “Just knowing we did the same
work and getting up to eight dollars an hour more — they
were really shocked!”

There were two meetings between workers from
Badger and Acme. The first was on a Saturday in July when
Riedberger and Jeff Toczek, ﬁnancial secretary for Local

B 1112, brought a paycheck stub and assurances that Acme
workers could have a proﬁt sharing plan and a union.

With Local 1154 Steward Orlando Guzman translat-
ing, the workers exchanged information.

“They couldn't believe our wages. A couple of their
guys almost passed out. Their question was ‘how long will
it take for us to get money like you guys got,”’ said Toczek
who, along with Riedberger heard stories of what working at
Acme was like.

“Some people working there for six or seven years
were making less than people working for two to three
years. One guy said if the Acme workers would say
something about safety or unsafe machines they would get
transferred to even less well paying jobs,” said Toczek of
the meeting.

“We told them about our grievance procedure — how
we handle problems in the shop,” responded Toczek when

 

Acme workers told him they “kept their mouths shut.”
It was 6 o'clock on a “perfect Chicago morning -
threatening rain and very cold” about two weeks before the

election when Rick Suchecki, chief steward of Local 1112, ”

first saw the new building housing the Acme plant with its
state of the art equipment.

Amazed that “the owner could have so much money
and be so  ruthlessly opposed to paying wages these guys
could live on,” he and Riedberger stood on the curb, as close
to the plant as management would allow, talking to the
workers on breaks and at lunch time. They were “picking
our brains like crazy.” T e

A story of how the union had backed a worker at
Badger who was fired for what was called a safety violation
hit home with the Acme workers. The case was won in

‘ arbitration.

“We got this guy back with full back pay — about
$22,000.” Suchecki said their reaction was “‘my God! That
would be wages for three of us for a year!”’

“Some weren’t gung ho,” said Riedberger. They
questioned what the union would do for them and told the
UE members “we don’t (necessarily want the things you
have) in your contract.”

“That’s fine. We want you to build your own con-
tract. Set your priorities and build from there,” said
Riedberger. “That had an impact  they figured we would
come in and tell them (how to do things). We're the UE 
we told them the members run this union.”

On October 16 Acme Die Casting workers voted
39 for the_ union. . 

Did the rank and file efforts help the campaign?

“It helped a lot,” said Acme employee Marcial
Canales.

“A lot of people didn’t believe in the union. When
those people arrived they started taking the union more
seriously,” commented Aguirre.

Waking at 4 a.m. for the trip to Chicago Suchecki had
thought “I don’t want to go.” But 14 hours later on their
way home he and Riedberger “felt pretty darned good about
ourselves. When we found out (about the vote) we were
happy as heck. Not just that it was the,UE  that they had
somebody to help.”

“They were shaking our hands and saying thanks. I
felt real good,” said Toczek. “I can’t see companies running
all over peole and taking advantage of people.”

“You make an impact. I could see it,” was
Riedbergers’ comment. For people who ask him why he
went, he answers it “makes us that much stronger (ﬁnding)
any way we can help each other.”

Suchecki, after being at Acme, said “you can see
where you’ve got to do it. So many shops crying for help.
You hear about workers in South Africa and other countries
 but Jesus Christ, people next door are being treated the
same way.  You realize that unless something drastic
happens these guys have no future. Their kids have no
future. They just need some help to help themselves.”

A GROUP or BIRDS DECIDED TO FORM
A UNION

So they called a meeting and the duck stood up and
said, “I think we should require that prospective members
be subjected to an initiation ceremony.”

But the rooster said, “No, we shouldn’t embarrass
prospective members. Some folks don’t like unions
anyway.”

So the argument was on. But the parrot said, “I
don’t think initiation is the important thing — What we
need is a good program.”

Then the mocking bird said, “What about stewards?
We must have a good steward system...and don’t forget
about a political action committee.”

“Oh,” said the thrush, “We don’t really want
stewards. A membership meeting once or twice a year is
quite enough.” I

But the titmouse didn’t want any meetings at all.
And the sparrow said it would be just as well if they
threw out political action altogether.

The goose stood up and said, “What we really need
is a President who is good with our younger workers. If
we don’t attract the young militants the other unions in
town will gobble them up for sure.”

But the starling thought it was more important that
their President be a “good mixer.”

And the bluejay ﬁgured that if the President would
lay off issues like commitment, solidarity and stuff like
that, almost anyone would do...as long as he was popular
with the Chamber of Commerce.

But the real wrangle came over the budget. Some
thought everyone should pay dues...provided they could
affort it. Others thought they should do away with dues
and per capitas and just rely on voluntary contributions.

So finally the owl arose and smoothed his feathers. .
Everyone grew silent for they knew he had great wisdom.

“Brothers and sisters,” he said, “All these things are

4 secondary. I’ll tell you what we need. What we need is

sincerity!” And all the birds applauded and stomped and
whistled.

“Yes Sir,” repeated the owl, quite pleased with
himself. “Above everything, we must all be real
sincere...even if we don’t mean it.”

So they formed a union...

And it was for the
birds.

Remaking A City

By Annemarie Draham
Pittsburgh, Pa.

What is the purpose of “remaking a city”?

Tri-State Conference on Steel believes that the purpose of
revitalizing the Mon Valley should be to keep our communi—
ties alive with the people who made them. For that reason, we
applaud the central theme of the Regional Urban Development
Assistance Team (RUDA'I') and the emphasis by the Prince of
Wales at the Remaking Cities Conference held here in

, Pittsburgh recently:

Residents must have a say in how their communities are
redeveloped. A

But the RUDAT team seemed to ignore its own advice when
it issued its final report. The many area residents who spoke at

I the RUDAT town meeting in Homestead in favor of preserv-

ing good steel facilities were told they were hearkening back
to times gone by. As a way of “improving the image” of
Homestead, the RUDAT team suggested that the still viable
160-inch mill at USX’s Homestead Works be torn down and
replaced with an international garden festival.’ A ﬂea market]
retailcenter was suggested for McKeesport,Pa.

The team also ignored the current predictions of the business
press, which predicts tha the manufacturing sector of the
economy will fuel econ mic growth in the late l980’s and
l990’s. For example, the Jan 11 cover story for Business
Week was entitled “Manufacturing: The Key to Growth.”

We take exception to “redevelopment" schemes based on the
idea that the way to redevelop our communities is to make

them into playgrounds for the rich and that longtime residents
must leave the area to find work. We believe such schemes
mean not “development” but breakdown of communities.

Tri-State does not say that every manufacturing facility
could or should be saved - many are hopelessly antiquated.
We agree with the RUDAT team that there must be room
along the river fronts for many uses: steelmaking and other.
manufacturing facilities, commercial enterprises, industrial
museums, housing and parks. But we must ‘ensure that efforts
to “redevelop” don’t destroy the Mon Valley's potentially
productive manufacturing facilities. Many of those facilities
were shut down because the corporations that owned them
found that they could make higher profits by investing their
money elsewhere. If new technologies and innovative public-
private ownership structures are used, there is a real possibility
some of those facilities can be reopened.

The effort by Tri-State, the Steel Valley Authority and the
United Steelworkers of America to restart LTV’s Southside
electric furnaces is an example of REAL redevelopment.
Three years ago there was a danger that the furnaces would be

, dismantled because LTV did not want to spend the money to

build acontinuous caster. Today, the reopening plan for the
furnaces includes an ownership structure that includes private
investors, worker stockholders and a public equity stake. The
plant will be refurbished with the most modern steelmaking
technologies.
That is an example of how one “remakes a city.”

right hand, and shook hands saying, “Good-bye, Mr.
Colangelli.” He murmured something about her tight grip, an
asked, "What's going on, Mary?” ‘ ‘

Back home. she switched on the radio in the kitchen
to listen to the end of the‘ second game in the World Series
between Detroit and Chicago. Actually, she didn't care about
the game. Neither the Giants nor the Yankees made it to the
series, but crowd noises, cheers, the announcer’s voice
brought some life to the apartment.

~ While washing the sandy spinach in one water after

another to clean it, she read from the interview book propped
up by the soap dish on the shelf above the sink: “Know
everything possible about the company where you are seeking
employment.” Papa could tell her a lot about the ready-made
men’s suit business. Cooking the spinach and poaching the
eggs, she rehearsed: “Mr. Levy, I’ve been a part of the
clothing business all my life. My father had his own business
for years.” ,

She heard Papa's key in the door and quickly turn

» off the radio. Before he even had a foot in the hallway, she

began, “Papa, I'll take your‘ things. Listen to the ad I found in
the Times today.”

He came in and brushed passed her. She followed
him. He said, “Let me catch my breath. Those ﬁve ﬂights are
murder.” Then he gave her his hat and coat and disappeared
into the bathroom. Dropping his things on the chair in the
living room, she went into the kitchen, walked around the
kitchen table until he ﬁnally came in. His eyes avoided hers
and she noticed that his lips were narrow and turned down at
the corners.‘At the stove he raised the lid on the pots and said,
“Looks good. Garlic brings out the taste in spinach.”

Mary held up the copy of the ad, began to recite,

Papa interrupted, "_I’m hungry. Let’s eat.”

"It won't take a minute,” she pleaded.

"Later,” he said, in a tone she knew well and obeyed.
Her brothers came to the table talking about the Chicago win.

Frank suggested betting on tomorrow's game. Papa
turned the radio on to the Buck Rogers’ program, and that
stopped all the talk. To the radio’s blare about adventures in

space in the 21st century, they did a disappearing act with the '

spinach, eggs, bread and milk. By the time Mary cleared off
the dishes and put the apples and coffee out, Amos ‘n’ Andy
‘was on. Mary knew better than to interrupt the Kingﬁsh.

One by one the boys left the kitchen table to start
their homework in the living room. Mary washed the dishes
while Papa ﬁnished a second cup of coffee and listened to
Kate Smith. “What a voice!” he exclaimed.”I could listen to
her sing all night.”

Mary wiped her hands dry on the front of her skirt
and put the copy of the ad on the table in front of him. She sat
down, clenched her hands in her lap. “Papa. Can you believe
it? No experience required.” She watched the frown on his

‘ face deepen as he read. With a hiss in his voice he said, “It’s a

gyp. Look at that salary.”

To the tune of ‘ ’When the moon comes over the

A SHORT ACCOUNT OF A PLANT-g
CLOSURE IN WEST GERMANY

By Christoph Scherrer
Frankfort, West Germany

The Frankfurt-based multinational corporation Met-
allgesellschaft AG, owns through its subsidiary VDM a
casting plant in Frankfurt, employing 1700 workers. For
much the same reasons that United States Steel Corp. had let
its plants in the USA deteriorate, plus perhaps because of the
prospect of a valuable real-estate deal consummating VDM
did not choose to modernize its Frankfurt plant and pre-
ferred to close its gates after the equipment was exhausted.

Promises of modernization plans reassured the workers that
although the plant was old, it would not be shut down. So,
for the majority of its employees the announcement of the
closure came as a complete surprise, especially since they
had expected their representatives on the board of Met-

, allgesellschaft, which is subject to the Co-detennination

Law of 1976,* to inform them in advance or do everything
possible to prevent the shutdown. But those representatives
preferred to stay silent.

Instead, together with the district leadership of the I.G.
Metall and the president of the work council, the workers’
representatives on Metallgesellschaft’s board went ahead
negotiating the compensation payments for the lay-offs, and
no effort was made to save the jobs. The plant’s work force,
divided into foreign laborers and older German skilled
workers, became restless, but waited for the results of the
negotiations.

For many of the older workers, the prospect of going into
early retirement did not appear to be too bad after all. But
the younger less skilled workers were faced with unemploy-
ment; and the foreign workers with a return to their “home”
countries which they had left years before in search of jobs
in Germany. The exodus of the metal fabricating industry
from Frankfurt limited the chances of re-employment
drastically.

While negotiations were still under way, a group of work
councilmen, active union members, members of the local
clergy and community activists got together and formed a
community group in support of jobs at VDM. They organ-
ized marches and invited activists from other cities to
community-wide meetings, where they could share their
experiences with them. But their impact on the majority of
workers remained rather small. Instead, many workers
reasoned that it would be best not to disturb the negotiations.
The prevailing mood changed as the management an-
nounced the definite date of the closure, for six months
hence. Spontaneously a group of workers took over the
factory gates, but after 4 hours were persuaded to go. The
I.G. Metall district vice president told the workers to stay
calm and to wait for the results of the negotiations concem-

 

 

Surqsng
uroourq

ing severance pay (Sozialplan). At the same time he fended
off all demands to stage a one hour work stoppage in all of
Frankfurt’s metal works.

Unimpressed by the statesman-like behavior of the union,
the management refused to negotiate and, instead, made a
provocative offer for severance payments that left the older
workers almost unprovided for. That led the way for unity
between the older and younger workers and, again, the gates
were taken over. But this time the union did not succeed in
calling back the workers and management’s threat to close
down immediately proved equally unsuccessful.

The workers chose their own leadership, consisting of‘some
works councilmen and union activists, to organize the
occupation of the plant. They received much support from
the community group that provided them with food and
entertainment and was able to solicit support from other
union locals, but the goals of the occupation remained
unclear. The workers were split on the question of fighting
for their jobs (mainly foreign workers) or for better sever-
ance pay (older workers).

The union leadership capitalized on this split and once it saw
the fruitlessness of its effort to send the workers back to
work, supported the occupation verbally and, strengthened
by the workers’ action, continued to negotiate purely for
better severance pay. Otherwise it discouraged any suppor-
tive action beyond solidarity speeches and cash collections
from other union locals.

Management found itself unprepared for the occupation.
VDM was the sole supplier of a number of parts for the auto
industry and arrangements for its replacement by another
manufacturer were not yet completed. Thus, management
was pressured by its customers to end the occupation by
giving in to the moderate demands of the union leadership.

Finally an accord was reached that provided for severance
pay comparable to that which workers had received at a VW
subsidiary several months before (60% of the gross wage for
each year of seniority plus special benefits for those over 45
years of age). With this agreement in their hands the
negotiators hurried to the gates of VDM and convinced the
works council to accept it. They told the crowd of their
achievement and that the fight was over. The older workers
were quite pleased and one of them stopped the discussion
over whether one should continue to fight for the jobs or at
least for the back pay for the one week on strike by remov-
ing the chain from the gate. The crowd dispersed.

*'Ihe Co-deterrnination Law of 1976 is a national law
mandating the presence of workers on companies’ Boards of
Directors in some major industries.

 

 

 

National Writers Union Organizes
Freelancers T  

By Tom Johnson
Chicago,Il.

Working as a freelance writer is similar to working in other
sweatshop “cottage industries.” You often work in your
home; you usually are isolated from your co-workers and
paid on a piece-rate (per/word or per/story) basis. Often, you
work long hours on research, background and the writing
itself, putting in great time and expense; and then you
receive no guarantee that your work will be published, or
that you will be paid. Whatever kind of writing you may do,
your art is truly labor. J

FACT: only ﬁve percent of writers who publish books earn
their living from writing.

FACT: only two percent of all writers are able to survive on
writing alone.

Editors and publishers often make changes in the writing or
use a writer's work without his or her knowledge and
without payment. Few publishers provide basic benefits
such as health care and pensions.

The prevailing image among most people is that writing is
an exotic occupation practiced by a privileged few who
spend half their lives in Manhattan penthouses and the other
half in fashionable bars. The image is quite simply a lie. The
vast majority of writers are workers who are underpaid,
unorganized, abused and often not even considered to be
“real” trades people.

The NATIONAL WRITERS UNION (NWU) is organizing

to defeat that particular lie. Founded in 1982, the NWU has
organized about ten percent of freelancers throughout the
country. The Union is open to every writer, regardless of the
kind of writing which he or she may work at. Already, the
Union offers a health plan and other services and benefits.

Some of the more recent organizing drives and successes
include:

* Winning a contract with the LA Weakly which includes
contributions to the Union health plan.

* Supporting writer, Margaret Randall, in her struggle
against the Reagan administration’s deportation efforts.

* Joining the movement to repeal the notorious McCarran-
Walter Act which NWU president Andrea Eagan calls
“...inimical to our system.”

"'Reaching a “Code of Minimum Practice” with Musician
Magazine. ' -

_ * Supporting slaughterhouse workers Local P-98 (UFCW)
‘ in their important struggle against the Hormel Company. 71

 

* Winning grievances for book writers Roberta Ka-
lechofsky and Faith Berry.

* Gaining back payments owed to writers at the Boston-
based Whole Life Magazine amounting to $4,000.

* Organizing numerous other bargaining and grievance
struggles around the country.

Recently, the Union has hired Kim Fellner (formerly of the
Screen Actors’ Guild) as executive director to help coordi-
nate the many existing organizing _activities and initiate new
ones. In a recent issue of . the Union’s paper, American I
Writer, Fellner outlined some of her views on the direction
which the Union should take. "

She writes: “... if we want to thrive, rather than merely
survive, we must spread the commitment andbuild on the
need (for a unionized work force), organizing freelance
writers in every region and every genre to become a part of
the fight to win fair wages and fair treatment.

“There's going to be no business unionism here  Unionism ~

—— the real stuff, not the all too prevalent substitute —-— is the
process of empowering individuals to collectively improve
their circumstances as workers. It's active, not passive;
dynamic, not stagnant; expansionist, not exclusionary: risk-
taking, not safe. I believe in espousing the ideal — and I
believe in winning the reality.”

The kind of dynamic, democratic unionism which Kellner
calls for is being pursued by NWU Local 12 in Chicago.
Local 12, led by Linda Wagner, (who is also the Central
Region vice~president) is presently bargaining with In These
Times for a contract. The bargaining is going well and an
agreement may be reached soon, according to Wagner.

A Business and Technical Group is in formation and
organizing a job bank for business & tech writers. The Local
recently voted by a 3-1 margin to support the strike by the
Tribune workers’ Unity Council (Printers, Pressmen &
Mailhandlers). The Local is actively pursuing grievances
and organizing committees to increase both bargaining
opportunities and service to Union members and other
writers. In the NATIONAL WRITERS UNION, art and

_ labor truly meet.

Of a Sister City V
Sprint,Steelworker Solidarity
and “Soft Targets”

"Miarni is more of a threat to the United States than Nicaragua”

- former Contra "Commander Zero”

By  Evans
Pittsburgh,Pa

’Ihis spring while most of my “Steel City” friends and co-
workers were busy fantasizing a Pirate pennant race or
pondering how the good Prince Chuck would commence “re-
making” a “Garden Party” where working mills used to be the
fancy, I was gingerly treading for the first time onto the”'I‘hird
World” turf of sunny, war-tom Nicaragua on an peace
activist’s dream “vacation”. My mission was to conduct a 5K
footrace in Pittsburgh’s “Sister City”- San Isidro- as part of an
Athletes United for Peace goodwill tour and to do a video
documentary of Pittsburgh steelworkers working side by side
with Nicaraguan steelworkers in a tropical mill just outside of
Mamgua. Last summer, my 5 year old son (Ducky) and I

‘ joined the International Peace Walkin Moscow on a similar

citizen diplomacy mission and I remember telling Ducky that
Russia was,in many ways,like a Third World country ...a land
tar-pitted in tradition (he likes Dinosaur analogies) , suffering
scarcities of basic goods (especially popsickles) and heavily
 (strict policemen). Now I have to report to my kid
that I had gotten my “worlds” all screwed up. The Soviet
Union must at least be promoted to “Second World” status
because I’ve now seen the REAL “Third World”. It’s a place
where I couldn’t bring my kid safely and yet it’s a nation of
children. The average age in Nicaragua is 15. (in the U.S. it’s
30) .It’s a country where it’s teenagers hang on comers with
AK-47s slung over their backs and where the grafrtti doesn’t
read “Mt Lebo-class of’ 88" but rather “A marine will fall
HERE” or “THEY (North American Imperialists)WILL NOT
PASS".In Moscow, we saw a people with tattered yet proudly
polished shoes. In San Isidro, most of the 200 kids entered in
our 5K race ran barefooted. In Russia, housing seemed terribly
drab. In Managua, you're middle class if you have a front
door. The mass transit to Red Square was noticably outdated
and overcrowded but the rickity buses going to “anywhere,
Nicaragua” have people clinging from every conceivable
opening on a wing and barely a prayer. Throughout
Nicaragua,water is rationed to only 3 days a week , power
outages are a daily fact of life and kids Ducky’s age beg for
food at the marketplace and play “baisbol”with pipes and tar-
taped balls in nrbbled lots where buildings stood before either
the last earthquake or insurrection.

"Welcome to FREE Nicaragual”came the spirited greeting
from Nelson, our 25 year old,veteran Nicaraguan guide and
interpretor. (When we arrived in Managua, Nelson, hearing
that I originally hail from Baltimore, wryly surmised that I had
ﬂed south to scout talent so sorely needed by the vanquished
Orioles.) Newspapers-both Sandinista and Contra- carry daily
reports from the “Big Leagues”, mostly charting the successes

Gringos Mike Bilcsik and
Tony Slomkoski with
Nicaraguan Steelworkers

of Dennis Martinez(a former Oriole) or other local products
playing “El Norte”. Baseball consumes Nicaragua and our
Athletes United for Peace delegation would be honored as
guests at their “World Series” and play 5 pick-up games with
various sandlot, town or media teams.We would meet with the
Sports and Cultural Ministries ironically housed in one of the
deposed dictator Somosa’s 15 fonner homes.We presented 90
boxes of sporting goods donated by Pittsburgh merchants and
books on the South African struggle given by Pitt’s Black
Studies Chairman and renoun poet Dennis Brutus.

We asked everyone we met their opinion of the peace talks
(we were staying at the very hotel where the Contras were to
hole up). We heard responses ranging from a hopeful report of
fratinization amongst young Sandinista and Contra grunts on
the Honduran border - many of the conscripted troops are
former farmers who know that if peace doesn’t come soon the
may and june planting season will be lost and the war will
extend into another exhausting year. And we heard grave
doubts‘ that the Nicaraguan people would ever “forgive” the
mercenaries who rarely stood up to the Sandinista army but
rather picked on so called “soft targets”. Schools, teachers,
hospitals, doctors, water purification facilities, power lines,
reﬁneries, coffee collective members, nuns and priests daring
to preach “liberation theology” - to name a few soft, “commu—
nist” targets.'Ihey are the home grown, distinctly Nicaraguan
variety revo1utionary,ideologically scattered throughout 18
legal parties (some far left and far right(the Contras) - refusing
to join the political process fearing that popular democracy
might not cut them a large enough slice). These “soft targets”
are also volunteers from other countries successfully ﬁghting
disease, poverty and illiteracy. Sort of a self motivated and ,
financed, yet unrecognized “Peace Corps” like the blue collar
brigade of Pittsburgh area steelworkers that I would document

 

 

   

using ﬁlmaker friend Tony¢Buba’s camera (or should I say -
what’s left of ﬁlmaker ex-friend Tony Buba’s camera). The
Matasa Steel Works,backdropped by palm trees and inﬁl-
traded by grazing cattle and pecking hens,sported I-beams
marked by the all too familiar USS. It employs 900 and makes
fabricated steel products like sheet metal, bar and tube prod-
ucts from steel imported from the USSR. The mil1’s produc-
tivity is hurting because its American made machinery is

. starved by the US trade embargo.

This is where things get very confusing for me. While we're

if .‘ gleefully trading pizza and pepsi with the “second world”

Super Power Russians, we refuse to sell steel to a “third

 worl ” neighbor about the size of southwestern PA. While

we’re busy scrapping and curatingour own industrial capacity,
Nicaraguans must frantically patch up theirs with spare wire

 and washers, frustrating the living hell out of the North

American volunteers because they’ve identified the parts

I needed -all made in the USA— but would have to resort to
‘I  “smuggling” them in past their own customs, through a mined
,’ harbor and be “targeted” by a US supplied, scab mercenary
I it force. Why “scab”? Well, just as terrorists feast on “soft

targets”, scabs are known to look for the easy way out of
unemployment. There is a difference in measure but not in
method. The scab smells cash and takes your iob. When a

menary gets tlieﬂscent, he t—alEi es it a bit further. Now before
your blood pressure rises too high over my use of the terms
‘sea ’’and “mercenary”,‘consider your opinion of any
“worker” who would answer the ad for Lech Walesa’s job in
the shutdown Gdansk Shipyard and of the “freedom fighter” '
who shot American water works technician, Ben Linder in the
temple. It’s crazier still because the Nicaraguan steelworkersf
we had the privilage to work with over 2 weeks declared more
afﬁnity with us than with the more stiff and somewhat aloof
Russians who didn’t come as volunteers but were “sent”.

I’ll never forget my two weeks in the third world (in fact I’m
still dreaming about it). It dented myconsciousness in much I
the same way as my post college two year tour of duty in
VISTA (the domestic peace corps) in a Florida migrantcamp
back in ’69. Experiences like these provide the necessary
colorization to a world portrayed exclusively in black and
white by leaders lacking in common sense and decency and
seemingly loyal only to the almighty warbuck machine that's
placed heavy bets on your kid and Ducky’s willingness to go,
pound our southern neighbors to submission rather than reach
outa helping hand. We need to rid ourselves of Neanderthal
foreign policies and prepare our youth to run more “Sister City
Sprints”, help our workers show world-wide “Steelworker
Solidarity” and increase our vigilance of terrorist forces
seeking to destroy any society’s peaceful progress. I'll leave
you with a favorite quote from Baltimore pundit H.L.
Menchen -I don’t think he was talking about the Orioles-”If
you see a situation you can’t possibly understand, look for the
financial interest” ’ »

HIGHTAILING IT

By Susan Erem
Waterloo, IA

I hooked up with a contractor natned Jack 'Ihornas, out of
South Dakota, , when I was about 26. Times’d been getting
tougher in southern Iowa. Not too many folks were hiring
women laborers, so I was taking jobs wherever I could get
them.

I met Jack when I was putting up a store in a new mall in
Burlington. He was a strange one I tell you. First time I saw
him he was talking to my boss. I couldn’t help staring at him
while I stacked the lumber that had just come in. He kept
shifting on his feet and chewing on his gum like some little
kid. This “kid” in blue jeans and sneakers had enough
wrinkles and gray hair to pass for my dad! I’d never seen
nothing like it. Later my boss told me this guy just showed
up at the mall the day before and was supposed to be done
by the time the mall opened. Shoot, we had a two-week
jump on him. I just laughed and went back to worlc

Damned if he doesn’t show up at the end of the job and
make me an offer to work for him. He says he’ll pay me
three bucks more an hour if I become a carpenter, but I gotta
be willing to cart myself all over America, going where the
work is. I took the bait. Hell, I ﬁgured at 26 I still had time
to kill before I had to settle down and “make babies” as the
guys say. When I think about it now, I think God thought I
was getting greedy or something. I mean, times were hard,
but they’d’ve probably gotten better, and he was gonna
make me pay for being impatient.

When Jack started teaching me all his woodbutcher know-
how, I think he was kind of surprised at how much I already
knew. Hey, you hang around with them for ten years or so
and it's hard to miss a trick. But as much as I knew, I never
knew carpenters could work with the ruined equipment Jack
had. Notable saw, busted safeties on the saws that did work,
bent drill bits. I tried fixing some of it, but then he'd get on
my case for not working. Sure made it all that much harder.

But it’s a good thing I could keep up, because Jack was a
tough one to keep up with. When he ran a job, he wouldn’t
stop; he didn’t take breaks, and he didn’t take lunch. If he
wasn’t on the phone he was pacing the walls and pulling out
his tape measure at every comer, measuring again. He never

. talked much either. He’d just give me my job for the day

and that would be the last I’d hear from him, unless he
found a mistake. His answers to my questions were always
short and usually obvious. I think I asked him a question
sometimes just to get him to say something to me.

Jack was even harder to keep up with when you considered
the way he ran a job. Things got stranger yet I tell you. In
the first week, or sometimes before we even got there, the
sheetrock was delivered. Two rectangular piles of rock,
eight feet long, five feet wide and four feet high took up

what you might call a little bit of space on the site. And that
was before the framing materials to hang them on had
arrived. The fratners could work around the rock, so that
wasn’t any big deal, but before a week went by, the rest of
the materials arrived: the lumber, light fixtures, electrical
conduit, plumbing and scaffolding. There’d end up being a
three-foot path running along the wa1ls—to-be and between
each load of material. Just enough room for a scaffold to
scrape through. And it didn’t take long for that to get
cluttered over with scraps. Took me a while to figure out
why he did it like that, and I never did like his reasons
much. Must've been the most confusing place I ever did
work.

Every morning the framers, the plumbers, the electricians
and the carpenters, would lay out two or three cords each,
only to let them get all tangled up 10 minutes later. These
cords got plugged into a hot box that usually didn’t carry
enough juice in it to handle half the load. To top it all off,
the box always seemed to get hooked up in the middle of the
main path, so at least two or three times a day all the juice
would get killed when somebody tripped over it. I’ve never
seen nothing like it in my life, but what could we do about
it? Jack was the boss. So the sheetrockers tripped over it, the
framers cussed at it and the electricians threatened to set it
all on fire, but nobody said a work to Jack.

I think it was the sixth job or so when it finally happened. I
mean, I’d been on jobs where there’d been accidents. Shoot,
I'd had a few nasty ones myself, and when “the girl” gets in
an accident she doesn’t live it down for an awful long time.
But it seemed like something went wrong on every one of
Jack's jobs, like he was a jinx or something. I was the only
one who knew that, since we hired local everywhere we
went, and it was making me uneasy. I think it had something
to do with the safety. Jack just wasn’t safe.

We were in Tucson putting up a small restaurant and
working in a mall again. It was just as crowded and cramped
as usual. Jack had hired on two laborers, Jerry and Mike.
Jerry was tall, thin and kind of clumsy. He had this shaggy

 

(D

(U

 

ﬁfteen or so, but he was a smart kid. I admired the way he

, wouldn't give up on anything. Mike was a little older,

maybe 19. Now he looked like something you'd call a grunt,
I mean, laborer. He had these big shoulders, and dark 

like he’d worked outside all summer. Anyway, we affection— ,

ately called them both “Brainless” because they’d never
worked construction before and couldn’t tell a saw from a
drill if you hit ‘em with it. That's O.K. though, because
we’d all been there, so we didn’t give them a hard time.
They were good workers anyway, and there’s something to
be said for that.

Me and Jerry and Mike went out for a few beers that first
night they started with us. Jerry had a story I can’t forget,
and he told it with those sad eyes of his looking right
through me. He told me his dad was out on strike a couple
years before. It was in its 17th week. His dad said it wasn’t
the money, it was the working conditions. But the rest of
town said the union was being greedy. Anyway, the com-
pany started bringing in “replacement workers.” Things got
rough out on the picket line. His dad ended up getting killed.
Run over by some scab in a pickup. It was just before dawn
when one of the guys he worked with banged on the door of
their house to tell them. His mom was sick in a wheelchair.
Some kind of disease that makes you die slow. She was
always telling Jerrry the union killed his dad.

I just sat there and took another gulp of my beer. It was
almost too much to believe, but Mike kept nodding his head
and agreeing. Seems Mike was the son of the guy who came
to let them know that morning. Jerry and him were pretty
good friends and did everything together. Almost every

night we’d end up heading down to the tap to shoot pool and _

talk. .

So here we were only about three weeks into the job. Jack
was out running around to supply stores one day getting
nails and screws because we kept running out. I was up on ’
the scaffold with Mike hanging some two-by-fours for a
soffit. I couldn’t help thinking how each job had moved
along a little bit faster than the one before. Now, one day
seems to kind of melt into the next one when you’re on the
road, and I knew .I’d been on the road awhile. I finally
decided it just seemed faster because I was getting into some
kind of “routine” or something.

So here I was in my routine, drilling three-inch screws into
two-by-fours that might as well have been steel, and feeling
more like a woman than a carpenter because I wasn’t getting
very far, when Jerry yells to me that the phone’s ringing. I
climbed off the scaffold real quick, hopped over the hot box,
and grabbed the phone. Dave Haland from the South Dakota
office was on the other end. I held back a moan. Always
hated talking to him. He talked to me like I was some cute
little thing in a tight dress or something. He told me he’d be
coming down in three days to see the job done, “darlin”’.

I thought the guy was kidding. I told him we couldn’t have it
done by then, that we didn’t even have all the woodwork up
yet, but he just said we’d had enough time. Andanyway, he

tossed in, we had to be in San Diego by Monday. Now like I
said, we were only three weeks or so into the job. There
wasn’t nobody could build a store like that in three weeks.
Most folks can’t get the walls up in three weeks. It couldn’t
be done.

I knew Jack wasn’t going to like it. We still had the ceiling
to drop, and some doors to hang, floor tile and kitchen
equipment. Of course, the freezers and grills were already
there, getting in the way. Then I wondered why I was
getting so upset. He’s the boss. He’d have it all figured out.
Like I said, I never saw nothing like it.

I was thinking like this while I headed back to the scaffold
and damned if I didn’t walk into that damned box and the
power died, lights and all. That was getting routine. Every-
body just stood there in the dark while I fumbled to ﬁnd the
cords. I found the plug and connected it. When the lights
came on I noticed that the main cord had unraveled right up
to the plug. It’d probably been like that for years. Raw wire
was poking through. All you had to do was breathe on the

 

cords. I found the plug and connected it. When the lights

. came on I noticed that the main cord had unraveled right up

to thefplug. It'd probably been like that for years. Raw wire
was poking through. All you had to do was breathe on the
thing and you were sitting in the dark. I got everybody
plugged in, and cussed out Jack and the electricians all the
way back to the scaffold. -

While I wasclimbing back on, Jack walked in and I called
him over. I told him about the phone conversation I had with
Haland, and what I told him, you know, about not being able
to getiit all done and all. He just stared straight ahead and
chewed on his gum while he listened. When I got done he
tinned his head up at me and gave me a dirty look. Then in
this real low and steady voice, he said, “Talk back to him
again, and you're fired,” and walked away. Istill don't
know what I said. I glanced over to Jerry and then at Mike.
They looked nervous. See, I always stuck up for them to
Jack. They didn’t want me ﬁred either. I just shrugged and
went back to work. I didn’t want to worry them. Later I
yelled over to Jack and asked him to get the box ﬁxed. He
took a look at it; that’s all I know.

We worked 14 hours that day, and still had plenty more to
do. Most of the subcontractors were done, except the
painters and a little left for the electricians. The place was a
mess of course. There was scrap pipe, conduit and boxes all
over the place. It was pretty late by the time me and Jerry
and Mike went out for a beer, kind of a farewell drink. I was
going to miss those guys. But we ended up talking about the
job all night, even when we tried not to. Jerry kept asking
me about other jobs. Could he really call himself a laborer
now? Were all jobs like this? On and on. I told him ,”Next
time, Jet, get yourself into a union.” He looked straight
through me again, just like he did that very first night, and
said, “The union killed my dad.” We didn’t talk about it
anymore after that.

Thursday was set for the painters and the ceiling guys. It
was the day before Haland was supposed to show up. Jack
talked the elecltriciansinto working the night shift instead,
coming at 6 p.m. and working until they were done. We got
there at 4 am. to finish the wood before the painters showed
up. Jack told the grunts to get cleaning. He wanted the place
straight so the tile guys could come in that afternoon. He
was pushing his luck and he was pushing ourluck. Every-
body knew it.

They started cleaning the place up. They got a hold of a
dumpster, wheeled it into the store, and started dumping
broken sheetrock and scrap wood into it. I started caulking
seams before the painters showed up. jack had his tape out
again, checking where all the kitchen equipment was going
to ﬁt. When the painters and ceiling people showed up at 7,
the laborers hadn't cleared away enough garbage for them to
set up. Jack was walking around cussing at them for being
slow.

Jerry and Mike moved even faster. Hell, looked like they
had drills in their pants they were so nervous. They kept

F

tripping and stumbling over each other. Now, of course, I
wish I’d told them to slow down. But I didn’t. For a minute,
I just sat down at the place I’d been kneeling to caulk and
watched. Not where Jack could see me, of course. Shoot, I’d
already decided I wasn't going to let that company do it to
me.

Jerry kept missing the dumpster when he aimed to throw
something in it. Mike kept picking up more than he could
walk with, spilling sotne on the way to the dumpster, and the
rest when he tripped over Jerry’s new pile. Sawdust was

' kicked up everywhere. Metal framing banged against the

sides of the dumpster. Jack was pacing, acting busy,
chewing gum. He had one eye on the kids and the other on
the job. Mike struggled with an armful of busted rock. Jerry
tossed two-by-four scraps. I saw Mike’s foot drag a cord. He
tripped and the rock hit the ﬂoor. Everything went black.

“l’ll get the lights,” I heard Jerry yell.

“Don’t move, Jerry,” I shouted, “Mike’ll get the lights.” I
couldn’t ell if he listened to me. I couldn’t see anything.

Nobody moved. All the tools went dead, andthatdull hum
of motors in the background was gone. I could hear the
muzak from the mall playing low and mufﬂed behind the
barricade of the store front. There was a little kid crying in

the hallway. It stayed dark, and we all stood still, waiting. I
tried to remember how the job looked just before the lights
went out. How much clear space. I couldn’t reach the box.
There was too much crap on the ﬂoor. Nobody talked. We
were waiting for Jack to do something, but he wouldn't
move. I couldn't see him.

The painters got impatient and started talking. I could hear
them trying to find the cord to their generator. The slow hum
came back. Then they screwed in some temporary lights and
a dim glow came from the comer they were in. Sometimes
now I wish they'd never turned those damn lights on. I know
it sounds crazy but I wish there was no lights. I wish I'd
never worked for Jack and that I never saw Tucson. See,
Mike was standing there, leaning over Jerry, with this stupid
look on his face. Jerry was lying on the ﬂoor, his hand
holding the raw cord. His eyes were still open.

There was no reason, I kept thinking, no reason for this. No
reason at all. Didn’t make any sense. I knew that was it.
Wasn’t anybody crazy enough to take so many chances. My
dad used to say: “If it’s perfect, there's something wrong
with it.” I should’ve never taken that job. Just then I wanted
to be back in Iowa. I wanted to be a laborer again. I didn't
want to have to think about the job, I just wanted to do it. I
didn’t want to be working for Jack and growing old fast. Not ‘
me. I wanted to forget what I saw when those damned lights
came on. God was talking to me. He was telling me to get
the hell out of there. And when he tells me something, I
listen.

I yelled at Mike to get away from Jerry, but he reached over
to shake him instead. Jack came out of nowhere and shoved
Mike so hard he fell over the pile of lumber behind him.
Everybody just stood real still and stared at the body just
lying there. Mike was just sitting there, mouthing some-
thing, I couldn’t tell what. I got on the phone "to the hospital.
Somebody called an electrician from the mall phone.

I tell you, you ain't seen terror on a face until you've seen a
bunch of folks watch somebody die. I mean, we didn’t see
him die, but it was just like that. And Mike was a mess. His
face looked like he'd just run into a wall. Dumb kid figured

it was all his fault. There's no was he was going to come
back on the job. He left with the ambulance and police, and I
never saw him again. You know, they were like brothers to
me. I'd only known them three weeks, but they were. Three
damned weeks and my brother Jerry was dead and Mike, he '
looked 90 years old. Jack wasn’t looking too good himself.

Dave Haland showed up the next day, not knowing a thing I
guess, because he kept looking at Jack real funny, and
wondering what was up. Haland was about 45, had a real
cheeky face, stinking cologne, and a big belly that hung over
his belt and stuck out of his suit coat. And he was always
wearing that damned suit with these shiny cowboy boots of
his. Walked around the place like he owned it.

The first chance Haland got when Jack stepped off the job
he came over to me and said, “Hey, honey, what’s wrong

77

N W,_,,,,, .;a .._......r ......,.....»«a....a.s»r.w....._.._

   
  

with your boss?” What a chum. Kind of made me sick, you
know. He acts like he owns the world but he can’t even talk
up to his own worker. He's got to come over to “the girl”
with the broom in her and and ask her.

“You're the boss, you ought to know,” I said. Hell, I had
nothing to lose. That was my last job with those crazy folks.
I didn’t tell him nothing. He'd ﬁnd out soon enough. I just
asked him how much time J ack’d have on the job in San
Diego.

He lights up this cigarette of his and throws the match on._the
white tile ﬂoor we’d put down the night before. As arrogant
as he was, I knew he had to admit that we weren't getting
enough time to build these damn stores. I just wanted to hear
it from him.

He looked me square in the face and said, “Eight weeks,
darlin’, just like you always get. Why do you ask?”

I still had the broom in my hand. I shoved it at his fat
paunch, picked up my toolbelt, and walked out. I still
chuckle sometimes when I think how that arrogant look fell
right off his face when the broom hit him. Did him good.

Like I said, I ain't never seen anything like it since. Figure
I'm pretty lucky that way. ’

TWO REPORTS ON LOCAL UNION
BUSTING - FROM LANCASTER TO
LEWISBURG

1. Corporate High Crime

Frank J. Pitz
Lancaster, PA

One hundred years ago in this country, during an
economic chaos and a lame duck President, union busting
was the order of the day.

For the ax makers in Cleveland, Ohio and Lock
Haven, Pa., The Fall River spinners, the Hocking Valley
miners, the Troy molders, the Homestead strikers, the
Philadelphia carpet weavers, the Pullman strikers, the
Indiana miners, from Haymarket Square to Thompkins
Square - all added names to the History of Labor in the
U.S. ‘ '

Today, a similar set of circumstances exists and
union busting is still the order of the day. The following
story is one more example of Corporate high crimes
visited upon workers.

SOLIDARITY; noun; coherence and oneness in
nature, relations, or interests, as of a race, class, etc.

Columbia, Lancaster County, Pennsylania, Satur-
day, October 31, 1987. This is a traditional time in the
country - harvests, fairs, fests and Amish marriages.
There is a .‘bounty’ to be reaped from tourism.

For some 750 workers of the Grinnell Co., here in
neighboring Columbia, Pa., there is little to be thankful
for though. They have reaped a ‘bitter’ bounty from the
new Corporate owners of this gray iron foundry. After
many hours of negotiations, innumerable concessions
from the union, Grinnell workers find themselves ‘locked

- out’, with no -choice except to strike.

Tyco laboratories, Incorporated, (new owners of
Grinnell) have come up against these residents of one of

~ the toughest little river towns on the Susquehanna. Many

of these people are the descendants of the first settlers in
what was known in the early 1700’s as “Shawanah Indian
Town.” Columbians have always worked the ‘grist mills’,
‘silk mills’, canals and railroads. Since the mining of iron
ore in the l800’s, they have labored in the ‘gray iron’
foundries. Here, in 1987, these people are ﬁghting for
survival, they call out to their sisters and brothers
throughout the Great Industrial Belt of the Northeast for a
show of solidarity.

' Over 600 people marched in a recent solidarity
parade. Writers Tim McKeel and Ernest Schreiber of the
Lancaster New Era: called it “the largest display of labor
strength here in decades.” Two tractor-trailers hauled
local Teamster members; a pick-up carried adults and
children, sporting a large sign, “Donegal Teachers
Support Local 376.” Firetrucks paraded representing all
the borough companies. The parade route was lined with
people from the community, shouting support.

There was a rally at Glatfelter Field, where the

 

parade terminated. The twenty-ﬁve hundred or so in ,
attendance jeered loudly in the direction of the nearby
Grinnell plant whenever any of the ‘strike-
breaking’security forces were spotted driving the perime-
ter road. ‘

The next couple of hours were taken up with song,
solidarity speeches from many other union representa-
tives - and most importantly, the raising of money for
those members of Local 376 who have been illegally

V locked out of the Grinnell plant.

A CHRONOLOGY

February lst., 1986 - Grinnell, Columbia, Pa. is one
of 38 warehouse] distributionl manufacturing facilities in
the U.S. and Canada sold by ITT Inc., to Tyco Laborato-
ries, Inc., Exeter, N.H. The Columbia, Pa. plant is the
largest (600,000 sq. ft.) manufacturing facility involved in
the $225 million deal, (at the time Grinnell employed 888
people and had annual sales of some $70 million).
Grinnell general manager George H. Goodman states:
“...foundry has changed hands, but the operation will stay
the same.” A

(On another February, in 1976, this same company
(T yco) purchased a facility known as Simplex Wire and
Cable in Potsmouth, N.H., and proceeded to break the
union in that plant, much the same way they are now
operating at Grinnell in Columbia.) ,

May, 1986 - Grinnell-Columbia receives a $52,000
state grant to train its foundry workers in new quality
control measures. Grinnell controller Paul Suor: “...
should help the foundry’s position in a very competitive
industry.”

January, 1987 - Grinnell management officials
request that the Union, (Local 376 - International Molders
& Allied Workers) open contract negotiations early to
discuss concessions. (The contract is not set to expire
until October, 1987). Wayne D. Murphy, Grinnell’s
Manager of Industrial Relations: “...losses at the foundry
have spurred management to request the early start.”
Murphy further states: “While Grinnell is not promising a
shutdown or layoffs if its request is rejected, we can’t rule
that out.” (In January 1981 the average wage at Grinnell
was $7.00 per hour - through contract negotiations (and
concessions of workers) of 1981 and 1984, the average
wage was brought up to $9.75 per hour, which is where it
stands now.)

The union voted to open early negotiations with the
company beginning February, 1987. These negotiations
continued past the contract expiration date of October 10,
1987. In August of 1987, the company (Grinnell) began
large scale advertising in the local newspapers for ‘scab’
workers. The company erected a chain link fence around
the property, and erected a ‘block house’ around some
outside located compressors etc. In September, the
company presented a ‘Firm and Final Proposal’ which
failed to address any of the 60 issues still open and
unresolved. The union offered to continue to work
(without a contract), the company refused admittance to
those workers who showed up for work on October 11,
1987 - precipitating the present lock-out and subsequent
strike.

 

 

 

{U

 

Tyco Laboratories, Inc., is a ‘Fortune 500’ com-
pany with annual sales at end of ﬁscal year (May-1987),
of one billion, sixty-one million, seven-hundred and
eighty-eight thousand big ones! That, incidentally, is up
from $700 million plus in 1986. TYCO operates at about
13% plus proﬁt margin, that is pretty good in anybody’s
book. Is TYCO a ‘Corporate Raider’? In the twenty-five
years since their incorporation they have bought, sold,
bartered or otherwise traded some thirteen companies -
holding on to some for less than a year. Does TYCO

' ‘union bust’? TYCO’s law firm of Fisher & Phillips, of

Atlanta, GA., has a 55 page manual it prepares for its
clients entitled: “Achieving and Maintaining a Union-
Free Workplace.”

January, 1986, one month before purchase of
Grinnell - Tyco Laboratories signed a ‘revolving credit
agreement with a consortium of five banks. This agree-
ment establishes a $75 million dollar ‘pool’ to be in effect
until December, 1987. These monies have no specific
object other than, ‘general corporate purposes’ - sounds ’
kind of like a nice little petty cash fund for such ‘general
corporate Purposes’ as; guard dogs, chain link fences,
block buildings and scab security persons. Grinnell is not
having very much luck in the hiring of their ‘scabs’ -

‘ entry drug testing and some fear play a part in this. As of

this writing, the plant is operating at about 40% capacity.
Let us see if we cannot shut the damn thing down until
these 750 Columbians are reinstated with a decent and
dignified contract. ,

It is up to us, (all) to stop the continued RAPE of
the American worker. Right here, in Columbia, Pa., we
can turn it around. I look around at this once-great
‘Northeast Industrial Arena’, all I see are the rusting
skeletons of its greatness, and the broken spirits and
bodies of its inhabitants.

It calls for radical measures if we are to prevent our
becoming ‘America’s Graveyard.’ If we allow that to
happen sisters and brothers, you can bet your hard-
working ass that the eulogy read at our demise will come
straight from the pages of the Fortune 500.

It is past-time to become Radical, it is past-time to
take control of our own destinies. It is past-time to tell the
TYCO’s of this world: “You will not starve us; we have
the power to shut down this country, and we will use that
power.” It is time to tell the bought and paid-for politi-
cians: “we will remove you from office, in collusion with
Corporate America, you have violated the ‘Public Trust’,
and made mockery of that which you swore to uphold.”

We are the ‘working class’ - we did indeed build
Columbia, as well as many more Columbia's throughout
this Nation. We are workers - 45, 55, and 60 years of age
who spent twenty, thirty, and forty years in a lung-
destroying Foundry. They have given their sweat,
frustration, blood and lives to the Corporate Structure.

America, you took me and trained me to build your
bridges, mine your coal, pour your steel, and fonn your
iron. I am entombed in your bowels, buried in your
concrete, broken on your highways, and drowned in your
waters. If I can do all of that in the Hallowed name of
Capital and Progress - why cannot I be retrained for the

same purposes? Ifl must retire before my time - why
cannot you allow me to do so with dignity, instead of
facing me with goon squads and dogs. I ,
Our children have assimilated into your ‘techno-
society,’ they will build your twenty-first century. But,
we are the last of our generation. We built your twentieth
century, and you will not cast us out of it. We are your

past, your history, and your POWER! We are the people I

who work, united in SOLIDARITY, we will not be
defeated! -

kind you need.”

“But, Papa,” she hmried to say. “It’s Broadway and
Twenty-thir .”

“So what?” he came back. “Down there it's not the
great white way. The louses of the world hang out there.”

“I knew you'd ﬁnd something wrong,” she said and
stood up to back away from him. “I want to try.” Her chin
came forward. “Papa I’m going to try.” She couldn’t bear to
listen to him exaggerating just to keep her home.

He paced up and down in front of the window, his
eyes raised to the ceiling, ‘_‘Stop. You’re giving me indiges-
tion.”

At 7:30 the next morning, Mary waited for the train
at the 180th Street station of the Third Avenue El. It felt
strange, dressed up in her Sunday clothes; no library, no
Nedicks this morning. She’d get to«Moe Levy’s early, before
anyone else. '

This was her first trip downtown alone and she was
worried about not ﬁnding her way. Papa wamed her not to
talk to suangers, as if she had to be told. She could take care
of herself. -

The station bustled with activity: people of all ages
milled around talking, buying newspapers from the vendor.
The express train whirled to a stop with a shattering noise and
a vibration that set the platform under her feet swaying. The
doors slid open and she was swept along by the crowd into the
train. She lunged for a seat and got it. Standing in high heels
all the way downtown would be hell. ‘

Papa had told her to get off at the Fourteenth Street
station, walk crosstown to Broadway, then uptown to 23rd
Street. Money was short, so he gave her two nickles, one to go
down and one to come home. In the brown leather purse she
clutched on her lap was the return coin, white gloves, a
fountain pen, and the copy of the ad She wore the cocoa-
brown tailored suit Papa had made. She’d worn it all through
her-senior year and hated it and was tired of tailored clothes,
the only kind Papa made for her.’ God willing, she thought,
with her first pay check she’d buy a frilly crepe dress.

While the train tossed people against each other at the
stops, Mary occupied herself with tracing the words of the ad
in her mind. Straining to catch a glimpse of the name of the
station, she saw that it was her station, Fourteenth Street. She
leapt to her feet. She made it out of the door on time and
descended from the sunny platform to the dark street below.
The bulky El structure didn't allow the sun to touch the street.

In full sunlight Mary walked crosstown on Four-
teenth Street. Six lanes of traffic and the elbow-to-elbow
people striding alongside of her soon gave her a feeling of
urgency and excitement. From somewhere behind her she
heard a man’s voice, “Hello baby, whatcha doin' tonight.” A
young man, hatless and bearded, came up so close beside her,
she felt his warm breath on her cheek. Quickly she turned her
head from him, ignored him. Pleased that he disappeared into
the crowd ahead, confidence surged in her, a feeling that she
could handle any wise guy who came along.

Overheating snatches of conversation gave her a
feeling of belonging. Tall buildings outlined Broadway like
spikes holding down the street. Her neighborhood was squat,
narrow and dull in comparison. She’d never get bored working
downtown. Just to walk the streets provided an endless stream

,. _..,_....,. _,.,......_...,....-. . ,_

of adventure. No need for Seven League Boots.

By the time she’d walked to 23rd Street her feet hurt
horribly. Another thing she’d do with her first pay check was
to buy a comfortable pair of dress shoes. She looked around
first at a patch of greenery called Madison Square Park, the
words chiselled into a concrete pillar at the entrance, then,
across the street, a building with the numbers 949 printed in
large gold letters on bevelled glass above the doorway. In
front of the building, she was shocked to see a long double
line of women snaking up the street as though it never ended.
The ad. Oh, God! Could she be mistaken?

Walking to the end of the line on 24th Street, she felt
too embarrassed not to join the rest. More and more women
lined up behind her. Bewildered, she wasn’t sure of what to
do. A blonde woman ahead of her said this was the last time
she’d answer an ad. Employment agencies were better. A
woman behind Mary agreed and left. When the blonde left,
Mary screwed up her courage and left too. For her it was like
letting go of a life preserver in a turbulent sea. Her feet
throbbed with pain so she couldn’t walk back to the station.
Not knowing which way to turn, she went to the the park
across the street.

She sat down on a concrete bench set well back in a
circle of shrubs, took off her shoes and rubbed her feet. The
ground felt marvelously cool and soothing to her stockinged
feet. Closing her eyes, feeling a ﬂick of nausea, she moaned,
“Not even an interview.” -

Papa had proved his point: it was no use job hunting
with or without experience. His ‘ ’stay home” echoed in her
ears as the realization of her failure sank surely and deeply
into her heart. The city wasn’t exciting and she felt like a fool
for not listening to him. What made her think that she had a
chance? The sun warmed her closed eyes and she thought of
the comfort of the library where she belonged. Dozing,
suddenly she felt a hand slide across her shoulders. After a
dark and frightening pause, she screamed and jumped to her
feet. .

A heavy brute of a man with large bloodshot eyes
said, "Don't let me scare you baby.” The tone of his voice
jarred her wider awake than she’d ever been in her life. .

She wanted to run, but he now stood where he
blocked her path. “Keep your hands off me,” she shouted.
The noisy traffic insured she would not be heard no matter
how loud she shouted. Fear gripped her by the throat. Sweat,
hot and wet, trickled down-from her armpits and the back of
her neck, fonned beads on her forehead that eased down to her
eyelids.

In a low gravelly voice, he said, “I know you need a
job. I saw you on that crazy line and followed you.” His
breathing was heavy as if he'd been running.

Mary stooped to pick up her shoes and put them on.
For a second she thought of using the heel of her shoe as a
weapon, but it was useless to think of fighting her way out. He
was too big. Instead she decided to talk to him, maybe put him
off guard long enough to make a run for it. “Yes, I sure need a
job. Do you know where I can get one?”

He sat on the bench, motioned to her to sit next to
him. She continued standing about two feet from him. “I can
get you a job. Good money too,” he said. He took a thin black
cigar from his breast pocket, put it into his moray eel mouth

II. CorporateJGreed

Pam Mabus
Lewisburg, PA

Today’s union members are facing the same
problem that members of past generations faced so many
years ago--corporate greed. And nowhere is‘ that situ-
ation more apparent than with the union members who
work at the many International Paper plants across '
America. a

International Paper is a corporate giant that enjoyed
a $305 million proﬁt in 1986. And during the first quarter
of 1986, that proﬁt was increased by 260% over the first
quarter of 1986. Crying the IP needed concessions from
union workers in order to remain competitive, manage-
ment is demanding that union members give back the
extra premium pay for working 39 Sundays a year.
Ironically, it was management who gave workers the
extra Sunday premium pay over 50 years ago because
they said it was more costly to shut the lines down on ’
Sundays than to give the extra wages. IP also wants the
right to force workers to work every holiday of the year,
and in some cases, for straight time only. I

While union members are being ﬁnancially
strangled, John Georges, IP’s CEO and Chairman of the
Board, and the top 14 executives at International Paper
have all received a 38% increase in their wages. John
Georges alone is now enjoying over $1.1 million in
compensation. And he is lamenting the high wages paid
to union members!

A Studies by the United Paperworkers International
Union show that the bloated management salaries and
inefficient management overhead are the two main causes
of IP’s competitive problems, not union members’ wages.
Even though IP’s labor costs fall well below the average,
the company's overhead costs are 21% higher than
average. A

‘The lockout of UPIU Local 1318 members in
Lewisburg, PA is just one of the many examples of IP’s
tyrannical negotiating process. After two months of trying
to negotiate a fair contract, members found themselves
being escorted out of the plant on Deember 14, 1986.
Members offered to work under the terms of the old
contract in order to keep what they had; they were not
looking for any raise in wages or beneﬁts. Management
refused and told the members they would implement their
“best and ﬁnal offer” at 7:00 a.m. on December 14.
Because union members could not work without a signed
contract, they were escorted out of the plant by salaried
personnel and a chain installed across the road leading
into the plant. And so the lockout began.

Under Pennsylvania law, International Paper's
management was found to be at fault for the labor
dispute. Thus, the union members were entitled to
unemployment compensation. However, many members
had been on layoff for so long (due to IP’s repeated

80

' glorifying the high wages paid to union workers. Then the

 

attempts to consolidate jobs in the plant) that their
beneﬁts were soon to expire. The union workers also
received a $55 a week union defense fund payment.
During the seven week lockout, the union was
bombarded with letters from management. These letters
contained instructions on how to cross their picket line
without being ﬁned by their union, how to resign from the
union, and threats of losing their jobs to the “permanent
replacement employees.” The company also deluged
radio airwaves and all area newspapers with full-page
advertisements lamenting their ﬁnancial problems and

ads for permanent replacement employees started to _
appear in everynewspaper inside and outside the area.
Needless to say, the members’ friends and neighbors (and
sometimes their families) were not very sympathetic with ‘
the stand they were taking.

Even though the company kept crying about the
financial situation, management still had piles of money
to make every attempt to break the union. For two
months, they did the following:

1. Pay at least $10,000 every week to a local motel for
room and board for salaried personnel the company
brought in from out of state to run the plant;

2. Provide free vending machines inside the plant so
company employees would not pay for food eaten in the
plant.

3. Send letter after letter to union members coercing them
to return to work. ’

4. Hire extra guards to patrol the plant;

5. Hire a professional ad agency to construct “ads”’;

6. Buy full-page ads in all newspapers in and out of the
area;

7. Pay unemployment beneﬁts to union workers, while
also hiring “permanent replacement workers” (This is like
paying two people to do the job of one).

8. Run the plant at an excessive productivity loss for two
months. Union members could tell how the plant was
operating by looking at the trash dumpsters coming out of
the plant.

When the ads for permanent replacement employ-
ees came out in newspapers, people came for miles to
take the union members’ jobs. In one week, over 1100
“scabs” applied at the plant. In one day, during one -of the
worst ice storms of the winter, over 600 people showed
up at the plant. Ironically, on that day, a worker inside the
plant was hurt and had to be taken to the hospital.
Another plant in the area, which would shut down later in
the year, gave employees the day off to apply for the jobs
at IP. People on welfare were told to apply at the plant or
be in danger of losing their assistance.

In the end, the threat of “scabs” taking our jobs ,5
became so strong in the minds of some union members, a ‘
revote was demanded. When the vote was taken, 118 
people felt that the unfair contract had to be accepted. But
108 members were still willing to take that chance, to stay
on the picket line.

\ Going back into that mill was probably the hardest
thing many of those union members ever had to do. But

they went back as a union, as a whole. Some of them
went in arm—in-arm, singing “solidfarity Forever” from
the parking lot, through the doors, and into the plant,
where they had to sit through a “Welcome back, no hard
feelings” meeting with company management.

Local 1318 is a local small in number, but large in
spirit. Because of what happened to them, they have
grown closer as a union. They have become more
concerned with the political processes and with becoming
stronger as a group. During the lockout, not one brother
or sister crossed their picket line. That means a lot; it
means that they stood together during the most difficult A
time they had as a union.

Update As of Thanksgiving, International Paper has
four plants either on strike or locked-out They are: Lock
Haven, Pennsylvania; Mobile, Alabama; Jay, Maine; and
Depere, Wisconsin. The disputes center over the same
problems as with Local 1318 in Lewisburg—unfair
concessions.

IP has hired workers from a large, non-union
contracting company to run the equipment and trained
strikebreakers in Maine and Alabama. These scabs are
willing to share trailers with 14-17 other workers, with
ten men [using one shower, with sanitation facilities that
sometimes do not work, and facing work hazards inside A

,, the plants. International Paper is willing to pay these men

$15.50 an hour, but is forcing union members to work
Christmas and other holidays at straight time, a much
lower rate of pay!

Even the town of Jay, Maine is outraged. In an
unprecedented action, 900 of the townspeople voted to
ban all strikebreakers. The people also voted to require
temporary housing to comply with state subdivision laws.
IP will probably go to court if the new ordinances are
passed.

All locals are holding marches, rallys, prayer vigils,
etc., to keep members’ spirits high. They all have food
banks and welfare committees to help with any problems

And spirits are high! Friends of Labor recently
attended a rally in Jay, Maine—-8700 people gave their
support to the striking members. And on August 22,
between 4000-5000 supporters of UPIU Local 1787
attended a rally in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. They
marched for three miles, yelling “Scabs out, Union In! in
front of the three gates of the paper plant.

The members of UPIU Local 1318 in Lewisburg, a
sister local, have each assessed themselves $2.00 a week
to donate to Local 1787's Food Bank. They"will continue
to do so until the strike is settled.

The union members know they are in for a long,
hard battle. But they are ready to do what must be done.
And while John Georges, lP’s Chairman of the Board, is
enjoying his $1.1 million wage, he is doing what he can
to strangle the living standards of those who have long
been proud of their quality work and union membership.

I OPEN LETTER TO ANTI-COMMUNIST

CRUSADERS: "

, I hate to be the one to rub it in, but didn’t it hurt to
see Ronald Reagan playing kissy-face with Mikhail Gor-
bachev? Golly dam, gee whiz, it looks like you’ve been
suckered again.

I bet it was almost as galling as having to watch the
Nixons travel to Red China, smiling and toasting the Red
Menace. How terrible to contribute millions of your hard
earned dollars to the campaign funds of right-wing politicians,
only to watch them turncoat and become commie-lovers right
in front of God and the television cameras. How unsettling to
have the old rug jerked out from under your feet, again and
again. Shoot! Looks like you put all that money on the wrong
horse. Probably makes you want to kick the cat.

. What I want to know is, how long are you going to
keep on making the same mistake?

It’s established by forty years of history that your
favorite candidates are perfectly willing to bomb, kill and
maim brown-.skinned people in small impoverished countries.
The communists there are fair game and they can’t really
strike back. But when it comes to super powers like Russia ‘
and China, well, let’s just say that caution becomes the better
part of valor. At least that is the lily-livered excuse your
leaders give you for becoming spineless jelly-ﬁsh.

Where-oh-where is that 100 percent right-wing
American political leader willing and able to nuke the godless
Kremlin? Maybe Lt.Col. North would do it, but you can't be
sure. His secret meetings in the bathroom with the Persian rug
merchant proved that even a pure-hearted, red-blooded
patriotic boy can be bamboozled. No, rm afraid you have
been prospecting the wrong mountain altogether.

Think for a minute. Who is it that you can truly
intimidate with absolute certainty? Who is it who will always
cave in to your accusations of disloyalty and your labels of
“communist dupe”, “soft—on-communism”, and “giving away
territory to the evil empire?” Think. .-

Who is it who would never in a million years have
gone to Red China, and who would never have dared negotiate
such deep military cuts as Reagan is now doing? Come on,
face up to the reality that must be blowing your mind.

Yes. It was always there--the sure bet. It was
Truman (with the help of Hubert Humphrey) who created the
CIA which gave the right ‘wing a strangle-hold on US foreign
policy for the past forty years. It was Kennedy who continued
and accelerated Eisenhower’s policy of intervening in Viet-
nam. It was Johnson who dropped the bombs and napalm on
commie gooks, and anybody else who happened to be in the
vicinity . And it was Caner who boycotted the Olympics over
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

Pour yourself a drink to steady your nerves and face
the truth. From now on you should be putting your money in
the campaign fund for moderate liberals.

g_Dear Mill Hunk Herald:

I I I lNeed of Your Readers’ Help!-—

I have been collecting information on Employee
Assistance Programs (EAPs) and Wellness Programs (WPs).in

 Industry for about five years. As I organized my piles of data
I p and looked at the scene at hand, I find that today's blue-

collar workers, in general, are not lncluded in these pro-

. I grams any longer. Until about 10 years ago, especially the
e EAPs serviced the blue-collar workers and their health

problems. In fact, these programs started as a way to
helping the addicted (alcohol and drug foremost) worker.

At the same time, as there are fewer than ever
blue-collar workers serviced by these programs (today’s
EAP population is made up foremost of white-collar servlce
employees, managers and executives, ) the health of blue-
collar workers has not improved. To be sure, they still need
the services and they are serviced less with an ever increasing
rate of health problems remaining untreated.

The result of these ﬁndings caused me to contact blue

;; collar workers and unions to find out how responsive corpo-

fjj rate management and unions are in including blue-collar
 workers in EAPs and WPs. I tried to obtain addresses, names
gj’ and information, and I have been going nowhere. Whereverl
 turn I meet a tremendous reluctance to providing any useful
 information concerning blue-collared workers and union

}§ involvements in EAP and WP developments and maintenance.
 I have obtained some good looking, uncontaminated-appear-
 ing pieces of information about EAPs and their implementa-

L tions through corporate-union cooperatives.

But there are conﬂicts. There are problems. There

 areipeople that are not included in these services. And I want
 to know about these problems, conﬂicts and exclusions. I am
 asking every blue-collar worker, union member and leader

 _ reading this letter to send me your information, experience and
 opinions on these issues:

Are there Employee Assistance Programs and

A Wellness Programs (physical activity programs) in your place

of work and do these programs service the blue-collar work-
ers? s 
Is there interest by the union leaership to establish
such programs?

Is there interest by the corporate management to
establish such programs?

What isthe name of your company and your union,
and where are they located?

If there are EAPs and WPs. which persons have
access to their services? And how many blue-collar workers
are there in your company and how many are excluded from
either an EAP or W? or both?

Is your corporate management and/or union con-
cerned about the health problems of blue-collar workers?

I will treat every answer with confidentiality. I will
not reveal your identity except for the corporate name, union
name and location. If you feel comfortable in sending me any

.  infomiatin related to the above questions, I will certainly
a V appreciate it very much.

I don't know it the cause be wrong,

I've had my day and sung my song, .
Andiought the bitter tight.

To tell the truth-. I don't know what
The boys are driving at,

  
 
 
 
 
 

And I'm too old to “rat.”

 

Maybe. at times In those old days,
Remembered now by iew,
We did bite oii in various ways ‘
Much more than we could chew—.
We paid in sodden strikers’ camps
; Upon the blacksoil flat;
we paid in long and hungry tramps-—

The day the opera comp'ny sang
For us the Marseillaise;
The sea of faces, stern and set,
The waiting ‘bitter cup,”

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The storm-clouds rushing up.

  

The lighting, dying Boomerang
Against the daily press;
The infant Worker holding out;
- The families in distress;
The sudden tears of beaten men—
0 you remember thatl-—

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Not worth the while to rat.

 

I've wept with them in strikers’ camps,
Where shivered man and beast;

I've worn since then the badge of men
Of Hell! and London East!

White laces by the ﬂaring torch; I
Wraith wivesl—-the slaves of Fat;

And ragged children in the rain-—
Yes!-—I'm too old to rat

Red Dust Reflections

thanks for the copy of mill hunk herald. i suppose you must
have heard of Time Worm (or maybe Counter Cuolture -
Journal of Diner Appreciation?) thru other magazines...? or
maybe we know some people in common? I’m interested
how you came to send MHH. when i was a kid in canton,
ohio i used to wander around in the steelyards of republic
and us after they shut down and pulled out everything was
hollow and rusting — this great thick chalky layer of rust on
everything it littered the ground and was blown in great
orange clouds by the wind. i scared me — i thought: Is this
what its all for? so THIS is what it is all for? we lived in a
block of old old steelmill factory homes, like dragons’ backs
with peaked roofs all the same tarpaper covered, knowing
that places like pittsburgh were greater steel towns, i had
called canton Steeltown ever since the first day in the
abandoned yards and mill bays. something about it: disillu-
sioned whitrnanesque...i felt like whitman felt in the later
years of his life when he saw how terribly wayward the
american experiment went Mill Hunk brings back my

childhood in an odd way
here’s ‘a poem you may be interested in.

Dayton, OH

was i that image— whose shadow was reﬂected
to me? a shadow of me

i had become enlarged, gripping the Fabric
fabric of this city built up ad-hoc

like me, myself looming over me on a
cantilevered shelf

glass block

city of steel, my skeleton unbending

rotting image of myself on the catwalk grid
aborted city of aborted ancient tools

used today was this a shadow of me?
reﬂected to me?

whose city? whose image?

in a real sense i threatened myself,
unfervently transformed

beamed back to myself to threaten myself
having been absorbed and taken over
(aborted world, mindless traces of

little torn limbs/little torn I—beams)

that they razed and raised

and that the city fed on itself

and that i became the city

and that the city distorted the image i
have of myself and that and this

and no direction,

wound up and let go with no

governor taken over

by which process is this accomplished?
evaporated in a bessemer smelter gone berserk
so my body turned away

and there on the cantilevered shelf of steel
reﬂected distorted in the glass block

i watched myself leaved,

trapped, raped.

FOLKS :

Thanks for the t—shirts. They look great. I’ll wear them with
pride. I was amused by the comment and opinion sheets
attached to the poems you sent back. I guess you can’t please
everyone.

I’m enclosing a"poem I wrote after being taken to labor
relations at work(The Ford Motor Co.) and given a half day
off for “disrespect to a worker’s comp rep”. The fact I never
cursed at her, endured all sorts of insults and threats from her
never fazed them. V

She lied, her hands were clean; I’m hourly, so I’m guilty.
Also, she doesn’t work for Ford’s (they contracted the job
out) and has been in the plant 8 whole weeks. I guess my 23
years,.being off from April to November on comp, and the
fact I was legitimately hurt on the job just doesn’t stack up
against her awesome statistics.

Anyway, keep up the good work. Hope you like the poem.
If not, just send it back with no sheet. The labor reps have
already hurt my feelings enough!

and lit up, never taking his eyes off her. Again he motioned to
her and patted the bench next to him.

“What kind of a job?” she asked, and took a step _
back.

His eyes, watery and faded, rested first on her breast
and then on "her hips. He took the cigar from -his mouth, put his
arm over the back of the bench and said, “Modelling. You're
the only one on that line with the right kind of shape for the

o  o

J Recalling her father's words, she said, “Oh, that's out
of my field. I don't have any experience modelling.” She took
another step back, watched as he returned the cigar to his
mouth, the saliva collecting on his chin as he rolled it in his
mouth.

Then as if rolling the words around in his mouth like I

the cigar, he uttered them wet with saliva, “No experience
needed, baby. Just have to strip for some special photos. Name
your hours. You could make a bundle.’ ’ He dragged on the
cigar hungrily and then started coughing violently. Mary spun
around and ran out of the park; his loud cough and the stench
of his cigar followed her into the street. Uneasily she zig-
zagged through the crowd occasionally looking over her
shoulder. She realized she was running uptown but didn’t care
where to get away from .

It was 34th Street, a safe distance away. She thought
of walking crosstown to the EL and going home, telling Papa
that she failed, like he predicted. She balked. That was worse
than the ugly man's hand on her shoulders. Tortured, she went
through her mind searching for an answer, like a beggar going
through his empty pockets. There was no answer except
Papa's: “Stay home!”

An ad in the window of the Walgreen Drug Store
ﬂaunting that ‘Blondes had more fun,’ reminded her of
employment agencies. The woman in line recommended them.
It was worth a try. Out of breath she entered the store, walked
back to the public telephone, and turned to the yellow pages
for employment agencies. In a listing for the Grand Central
area, one list specialized in clerical placements: Plaza Person-
nel Agency, Fifth and 42nd Street. She decided to try it.

The pale woman sitting at a desk behind the counter
asked if she could be of help. Mary said she was looking for
work as a stenographer. The trim, soft-spoken woman said,
‘‘You’ll have to fill out an application form. They're on the
desk behind you. Do you have a pen?”

“Yes, I have one.” Carefully, Mary filled in every
space on the form including the names and addresses of two
teachers who had agreed to be her references. Then she came
to the old monster "Experience” and left it blank. Mary
handed the completed form to the woman who immediately
lowered her eyes to the experience section, and said, “I see
you've never worked. I’m sorry. We don't take inexperienced
people.” ‘

An involuntary gasp rushed out of Mary’s mouth.
She was drowning and the woman wouldn’t even throw her
one of the many life preservers that littered the counter top. ‘ ’I
do have experience. Plenty of it, if you count school. I take
dictation at 120 words a minute. I was the best typist in the
class. Sixty words a minute and no mistakes.” The woman’s
eyebrows went up and she looked at Mary over the rim of her
eyeglasses. “You certainly have good skills.”

 

 

   

‘I Is that all? Is that all you're going to say? Mary
pressed on, “Give me a chance. I need a job, more than you
can imagine. Please, please give me a break."

"You’re certainly determined. I hate to discourage
young people. Let me see what I can do. I'll talk to Mr.
Prossner.” .

Mary waited at the counter, stranded in a bobbing

sea, sharks everywhere. If she wasn't rescued soon, she’d'give

up, resign herself to the bottom of the sea where things
happened in slow motion and the sun never penetrated, where,
in a shell, her shelter would be assured.

The woman stepping lightly, a smile on her face,
returned, “Can you come in next Wednesday for a test? Mr.
Prossner wants to verify your skills. Then he’ll see what he
can do."

“I’ll be here. A week from today at 9 o'clock.
Thanks. Thanks. I sure appreciate it.”

All the way down in the elevator Mary thought about
the test. She'd have to do it well. It was almost three months
since she'd taken dictation from Mr. Bruce, who stood in front
of the class in a stiff white collar and funny eyeglasses that
pinched the bridge of his nose. Invariably, he held a book in
one hand and a stopwatch in the other. In that class, the

. stopwatch was the god to be appeased.

She'd have to find some way to pracﬁce this week,
find someone with a stopwatch and a typewriter. Remember-
ing the ‘Instruction Female’ section in the Times, she went
into the 42nd Street Public Library. In the periodical room, she
went to the newspaper area, picked up the Times and took it to

an empty spot at a table. From the many ads, she found one on »

Times Square just a short distance away: “Miller Institute of
Shorthand, 1450 Broadway, Refresher shorthand courses in
exchange for morning wor .”

The Institute was noisy. Dozens of women sat at
typewriters in a bam-like room transcribing from shorthand
notebooks. A receptionist, sitting at a desk, motioned her to
the chair nearby. Questioning Mary about her background and
experience, the receptionist then asked about foreign language
facility. Mary told her she had studied Spanish and Italian
from using it at home.

The receptionist said, “I just received a call from the
Braden Advertising Agency. They want someone who knows
enough about Italian to type a LaRosa Macaroni radio script.
Do you think you can do it?”

Mary stood up fast, knocking her chair over, “Sure, I
can do it. Where do I go?”

‘ ’Here’s the address and carfare. We don't pay you
for working but we do supply the carfare. I ‘ll call the agency
and tell them to expect you. Take the local subway to 68th
Street. Then walk down to Riverside Drive.’ ’

Mary picked up the chair and asked, "I’ll come back
tomorrow for my practice?’ ’ '

“Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.”

“Thanks so very -much. See you tomorrow.” At last a
life preserve and the water wasn't choppy anymore. Thank
God, Papa was Italian. What a break. For some reason she
couldn't understand, her feet didn’t hurt. Maybe she was
getting used to high heels, or maybe just the buoyancy of the
water.

At the Braden Advertising Agency, Mrs. Braden,
