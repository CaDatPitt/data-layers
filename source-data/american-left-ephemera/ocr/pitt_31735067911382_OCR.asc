By John Clark

THE MEMBERSHIP of Mine—Mil'l as Well as the rest of this nation's work-
ers must by now have some knowledge of how the national emergency
will affect their existence in the coming years——-who knows how many

‘ years.

The proposals of President Tru-

-man and his economic advisers

reach so far into
the 1 i v e s a n d
destinies of th e
workers and low-

-’ income groups that
‘ one wonders
where an d what
_ will be the end of
’  their sacrifices.

Today, after the fight for a wage
increase to partially equalize the
exorbitant rise of living costs, we
find further jumps in these costs

lowering our living standards and
wiping away any wage gains made
in the past two years. Let ustry
to factualize what these emergen-
cy powers or proposals mean to
the low paid workers.

has

THIS INTENT IS QUITE CLEAR when we quote from the new study C

of President Truman’s Council of Economic Advisers. It states, “If taxes
are to have the desired a\nti-inflationary effect, they must be imposed
where they will reduce spending; the tax program must be adjusted to
the cold fact that longer hours and harder work will swell the volume of

personal income.”

This philosophy seems to sug-
gest much stiffer taxes on individ-

” uals in the lower and‘ middle in-

come brackets and broader excise
levies. Moreover, the Council em-

_phasized that higher taxes must
not be used as the .“excuse for
raising the prices, profits, or wages
of those on Whom the tax is in-
intended to rest.” V

The above is taken from the

"\./ . -

Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, 1951.

Since the start of the Korean
War the workers and their fami-
lies have been forcibly brought to
realize that their income is being
lowered by the soaring costs of
commodities, rents and taxes. The
monopolistic control and the in-
satiable greed for profit-taking on
hiking price costs _has brought no

_criticism from the administrative

forces or their economic advisors.

iritiﬁr

Now the climax is set. The drive is on to force the workers to a still

" Ilo/wer standard of living, longer working hours (with the move undoubted-

ly to wipe out the overtime pay after 40 hours) and harder work, another

way of saying “speed-up.”

The members of this organization, whose work is in one of the most
exacting and hazardous, are now more than 80 per cent working the
longer work week. Their output has been so great that the mining com-
panies, according to one of their official organs, the Wall Street Journal,

that of the same period of 1949.

The Council of Economic Advi-
sors in their approach into wage
increase formulas and taking into

account productivity" and cost-of- '

living adjustments, stated th at
they would have the advantage of

'-«providing the wage earner with

incentive, “but could be‘ danger-

_ous if taxes were not increased

sufficiently tokeep the wage gains
out of the spending stream}?
The employer in our industry,

" made a net profit of 562.8 per cent more i-n the 3rd quarter of 1950 over

through loopholes in the unequal
tax program, can escape his right-
ful share’—-but the worker. must
not be allowed a gain in his pay
envelope to pour into the “spend-
ing_ stream,” which is a way of
providing his family with decent
living standards. ‘

Above all this, a move now is
being considered in Washington to
impose the most hated and dis-
criminatory tax of all--a national
sales tax.

 ' t‘<'*7i‘r

This International through the action of its rank and file delegates
i-n the Denver Convention, September, 1950, adopted a program which is
in line with that of all organized labor. It stated:

No. 1——No wage ormanpower
freeze-—and a federal .minimum
wage of $1.00 per hour.

No. 2——Price and rent controls

“ *5_o-woygi pclleﬁns, wod., Jan." 34‘

——consumer prices and rents rolled
back to Feb. 1, 1950.

No. 3—Corporation taxes free
from loopholes to prevent profi-
teering—-l00% excess profits tax
on corporations. No increase in in-
come tax or any other type of tax
on incomes of families of $5,000
or less. ‘ '

We are still behind such a pro-
gram. .

Lewis hits   

WASHINGTON (Fu“I:’)°—‘“i“["re§,,_, John
L. Lewis of the United Mine Wolf « _.
last week denounced proposed wage
freezes, said price control won't work.
and asked the Wage Stabilization
Board to “memorialize the President,
Congress or whoever should be mem-
orialized for repeal, nulllification and
suspension of the oppressive ‘Taft-
Hartley law.”

  

Those were the high points of his 1
talk to the Wage Stabilization Board, 
which was beginning closed hearings -‘i’
with Lewis as the first of 70 wit—. ' ,
nesses. Representatives of the United/-/’‘:
Labor Policy Committee were also 
scheduled to testify.

“The United Mine Workers did not
feel that the present situation requires
freezing of wages,” Lewis said. “The
war production act establishes the
obligation that everything possible be
done to facilitate free collective bar-
gaining. Stability can be achieved
through the more normal processes
of collective bargaining which have
been developed in America through
the last 100 years. ‘

“This can be achieved without the
issuance of a government restrictive
order and fiat after fiat.”

He declared- it is unbelievable that
the wages of workers should be froz-
en at a time when industry is creat-
ing inflation by this high rate of in-
vestment of dividends.

Lewis pointed out that the terms of -

the production control act make it
impossible to control prices.

California CIO News A dies

The -California edition of the CIO
News has announced that it is “sus-
pending publication,” another way to
say it’s folding.

The reason is that not enough local
CIO unions could be found to support
the paper in California, despite the
fact that National CIO poured many
thousands of dollars into it during the
last 21/2 years.

i The Los Angeles Labor Herald, one
of the papers the California CIO
News tried to destroy, commented
that the passing of the west coast

' edition of CIO News “will be mourn-

ed, if at all, by only a very narrow
circle of big brass and lesser piecards
——and by the bosses and anti-uni 1
politicians.” _

“_From the very first,” the Labor
Herald said, “its columns were loaded
with red-baiting, slanders and sour-
rilities-—and very little else. And that
simply was not enough to win and
hold the majority of the workers in
the shops who wanted guidance on
such matters as the shrinking buying
power of their wages, the growing
threat of war, and the soaring profits
and increasing anti-union arrogance

Local 365 president here following
the resignation of Stanley Grabowski
from the presidency.

approval by the local union member-
ship of a recommendation by the ex-
ecutive board that any local officer
or steward going to the company’s
foremen training school should give
up his position of union leadership.
Berko himself made the motion at
the executive board meeting to recom-
mend this policyvto the local mem-
bership.

Edmund Wallens was elected to
serve as temporary grievance chair-
man, on recommendation of the stew-
ards council. Both Grabowski and

pany's foremen school, as has Stephen

Canadians fight
labor board ruling

TORONTO, Ont.—The entire Cana-

last week against a decision of, the
Canada Labor Relations Board re-

Seamen’s Union. \

All trade unions, regardless of af-
filiations, were in agreement that the
decision could be used as the basis for
wrecking the entire labor movement
in this country.

The revocation was in a unanimous?
board decision, based on the claim that
the CSU participated in an industry-
wide strike nearly ‘two years ago and
on alleged political beliefs and affilia-
tions of leaders of the union. The
Board contended that b e c a u s e the

union has taken a position on politi-' '
cal issues in Canada, it cannot be con- -
. sidered a union, and employers there-

fore do not have to bargain with it.

Trade unionists pointed out tha t
on the basis of such a precedent, any
trade union may be outlawed merely
because a labor board may disagree
with the politicalaction policy of the

union. This could very easily affect‘  1

even the Canadian Congress of Labor
unions, who are committed to support
of the CCF political party.

A ' mounting protest movement,
aimed at full restoration of the Cana-
dian Seamen’s Union bargaining
rights, was developing all over the
country as a result.

L. A. labor called

LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Trade
unionists here have called a county-
wide conference Friday, February 2,

to plan and take action for m -
anti-labor legislation of all-le "

government from county to federal.

The affair is sponsored by the
Trade Union Defense Committee and
will be held at the Case hotel at 7:30
p.m. "

Action will be launched for repeal
of six anti-labor laws: 1) the Magnus-
son act, by which maritime workers
are “screened” off their jobs with
no chance to defend themselves or
even to know who has _accused them,

act, which makes it illegal to think
and speak except in conformity with
those in authority.

4) the Levering act, which requires
so-called “loyalty” oaths from all
state employes, from teachers to
maintainance workers, 5) the McCar-
ran act, ‘and 6) the Los Angeles city
and county registration ordinances,
which have been declared unconstitu-
tional — in two separate decisions of

local judges, but are being invoked -

' individuals to the working force. This
would mean that income, after taxes
for those persons now employed would

be less in 1951 than in 1950.

. The council, under chairmanship of
Leon Keyserling, called for heavy ex-
cess profits taxes as well as greatly
increased personal income taxes and
substantial new excise taxes. But the
tempemof Congress made it apparent

that it would heed the call for heavier -

levies on individuals and perhaps on
objects sold, but would go easy on
any excess profits tax. There was

  Wilson emerges as czar
over whole U. S. economy

WASHINGTON (FP)—~Charles E.
Wilson, former president of General
Electric C0,, has unveiled the new
government setup under which he
becomes the supreme authority, sub-
ject on-ly to President Truman, over
wages, prices, man-power, allocation,

. transport and production.

N o w h e r e in t h e organization,
created by executive order of Truman,
is provision made for any representa-
tives of organized labor.

AFL President William Green re-

‘Scrap overtime
pay’—says Wilson

The big business campaign to
scrap the 40-hour week has now
' been picked up by big business-
men holding down key govern-
ment positions. '

The new Defense Mobilizer,
C. E. Wilson of General Elec-
tric, tays more production must
be found by increasing the work
week from 40 to 44 hours
with no overtime pay.

“Business Week,” a journal for
corporation executives, reports
that the Defense Department
wants the Wage—Hour law
changed or voided for the “na-
tional emergency” period. It
aims to get 48 hours of work at
straight time from U. S. work-
ers. And it wants that rule to
go into effect by spring.

Robert A. Lovett, Deputy
Secretary of ‘Defense, made this '
“explosive proposal” in closed
sessions of ' the" House Armed

,‘'Services -Committee recently,

I according to Business Week. The
magazine comments: ‘,‘The' need
for labor to ,work"longer hours

peatedly had announced assurances
that la-bor would have a voice in the

recently AFL s e c r e t a r y-treasurer.
George Meany complained: .“Up to
the present time the government has
denied labor a voice in making poli-
cy and in making decisions in the
defense program.” .

Wilson was asked if labor would
have representation in the mobiliza-
tion. organization. In an evasive an-
swer, he said that as the program de-
velops the job will become very"
large and the advice of everyone will
be needed. His answer made it clear

_ that no keypost is being held for a

labor man.

Wilson will have a Defense Mobili-

zation Board made up of himself as

chairman, the secretaries of Defen-se,
Treasury, Interior, Commerce, Agri-
culture and Labor, the chairmen of
the Reconstruction Finance Corp_., the
Federal Reserve Board and the Na-
tional Security Resources Board and
“such other officials” as Wilson may
designate. The boar-d’s function will
be merely to advise.

On wages, the Wage Stabilization
Board under Cyrus Ching will merely
have powers of recommendation,
which will go to Economic Stabiliza-
tion Administrator Alan Valentine.
Valentine then can act only with ap-
proval of Wilson. On prices _Valen-
tine also must obtain approval of Wil-

son before action is taken.

Economic Stabilizer Alan "Valen-

B‘g tax h'kes
to h ‘t 0 YOU

. One idea on which t;here’s complete
unity among the Washington big shots
is that the little fellow -— the common
man -— is going to pay, and ’ pay
heavily, for the arms prOg1‘am- P1‘0-
posals for increased taxes are pouring
in thick and fast.

The President says he will ask for
enough taxes to "cover a $20 to $25
. billion increase in arms spending-
%Secretary of the Treasury Snyder

grees with this. Senator Taft says it’s
 ’ ' okay with him, so long as it doesn’t
' hurt the corporations (after all, you
, can't get blood out of a $24 billion
3;. profit turnip, can you?).

And Senator George of Georgia
says it’s fine with him and the rest of
the S e n ate Finance Committee. In
fact, nobody in Washington has a word
against this, including all the Con-
gressmen suported by C10 in the last
elections.

All these leaders are saying that the
big bulk of this new tax money will
be taken out of the people's income, in
one form or another.

Taft says, when asked where the
money will. come from, “From the
people one way or another. Higher
personal income tagres and excise

taxes must come from the people. You

can get little more out of the corpora-
tions.”

- President Truman, in a letter to
2" Senator Byrd, says to “t.a..r until it
hurts,” but he doesn’t mention that it‘s
only intended to hurt the little guy
who is paying most of the taxes
already.

The President's Council of Economic
Advisers has likewise recommended a
big increase in individual income
\ taxes, heavier sales taxes. and “large

absolute reductions in living stand-

ards.” '

 

Where is all this going to leave the
., average guy? He’s now paying about
 $200 per year in direct taxes, plus
«’ about $400 in indirect taxes. He's

"bus ticket he pays a 15 per cent tax.

_ All this could get to sound pretty

dull, except that the little men in

Washington plan a big additional sales

What’s more, there's now a proposal
to lower the personal exemption from

The Douglas plan

‘WASHINGTON ~— Sen. Paul
Douglas (D, Ill.), former Uni-
versity of Chicago political eco-
nomist who was elected with
labor support, ‘proposes paying
war emergency overtime work

‘ in government bonds which ‘can-
not be cashed until the emerg-
ency is over.

That way, he says, payment of
time—and-a-half forrhours over
40 a week will not become in-
flationary.

Douglas ignores the fact that
we have learned the war sav-
ings bond we bought in World
War II were not a sound in-
vestment. We‘ paid $18.75 in
1941 for our $25 bond. We
were told the bond would bring
us $25 after 10 years.

Inflation has made our $’8.75

kinds by the end of 1951.

And when you boil it all down,
these tax proposals are inspired by
two notions: one is to pay for the na-
tion‘s arms program; the other is to
make sure that the common man has
no loose cash to buy- any of the goods
left over after the arms are made.

Mining boss given key arms post ﬁg

The mining and metals industry is
going to have a big-—and profitable——
voice in the national armament pro-
gram. That fact has been driven home
by two recent developments.

First, Defense Mobilizer Charles E.
Wilson announced that he was putting
Fred Searls in charge of all materials
production, which now becomes one
of the most important jobs in the
entire government. And second, the
dying 81st Congress passed a socalled
excess profits tax law that provided,
in effect, that mining companies won't
have to pay any kind of tax at all on
certain kinds of operations.

Fred Searls is president of the New-
mont Mining Co., of which James F.
Byrnes, former U.S. secretary of state,
is also a director. Searls is also a
director of the American Metal Co.

I The key part played by Newmont
Mining Co. in the entire non-ferrous
metals industry ‘can be seen by the
fact it has holdings in the following
corporations: American Metal, Hecla
Mining, Hudson Ba_y Mining & Smelt-
ing, Int’l Nickel Co., Kennecott, Mag-
na Copper, Phelps-Dodge, ,St. Joseph

UE hits Wage Board plane
’for speedup, long hours

NEW YORK (FP)——-Opposition to
the “VVashington administration’s
policy of destroying the wages, work-
ing and living standards of American
workers for the benefit of war
profiteers” was announced here by

the United Electrical Radio & Ma-V

chine Workers.

The economic policy statement,
signed by UE President Fitzgerald,

,Secretary-Treasurer Emspak and Di-

rector of0rganiza»tion Matles, charged:

“The Washington administration,
with the approval and cooperation of
Congress, has embarked upon a deli-
berate program to wreck the Ameri-
can people’s standard of
is doing this under the pretext of a
war emergency. It is doing it in a
period of the most extravagant and
greedy corporation profiteering in the
history of the country and the world.”

MAIN TARGET of the UE was a
statement issued by the Nat] Wage
Stabilization Board ~which outlined
plans for limiting wages and labor’s
“achieving more output per hour,
working more hours a week.”

“Coupled directly with the board’s
announced ambition to ‘minimize’
earnings,” "the UE leaders said, “this
lays the ground work for governmen-
tal attacks on existing contract pro-
tections for labor, to promote speedup
and to break down workweek and
overtime standards.”

Approval of this program by the
board’s labor representatives. they
continued, “marks a new low in the
subservience of C10 and AFL offi-

Lead, Rhodesian Anglo-American, and
Texas Gulf Sulphur. It also has many
holdings in oil companies.

Newmont Mining, along with many
of the companies in which it has an
“interest,” received a great deal of
Marshall Plan money in the last few
years.

The Federal Trade Commission_in
1947 said Searls is one of five key
men heading ‘groups which “are -i.n a
dominant position with reference to
the production and price policies of
more than 60 per Cent of the world’:
production of primary copper."’

WITHOUT QUESTION, the mining
and metal companies will profit by
having men like Searls in key de-‘
fense production jobs. They will also
proﬁt tremendously by the fact that
the newly-passed excess profits tax
law allows a great big loophole for
all these corporations.

This loophole provides that pay-
ments made to minerals producers by
the government to encourage explora-
tion, development or mining of criti-
cal materials are exempt from all cor-
poration taxes including the regulai'

living. It:

cialdom to the interests of employers‘

and the orders of politicians.

The UE said it would fight for: im-
mediate price rollback to pre-Korea
levels, with strict price and rent con-
trol; lifting present heavy taxes on
wage earners and passing a corpora-
tion tax law to eliminate war profi-
teering; higherdwages to compensate
for price-gouging and for any ad-
vances in the cost of living that may
be permitted in the future, .

tax. Operating income derived from
certain strategic materials is to be
exempt from excess profits tax only.

Among the corporations that will
benefit from this huge tax loophole
is Miami Copper Co., which plans to
develop a new large open-pit mine in
the Globe-Miami district with funds
from the Reconstruction Finance
Corp. The" productive capacity of the
new mine is estimated at 45 million
pounds a year.

Similarly, the Copper Range Min-
ing Co., of Houghton, Mich., has asked

for a $100,000,000 loan for a project-

at the White Pine copper property in
the upper’ peninsula. Corporation
heads say the mine could reach a top

, It is worth noting here that Mine-
Mill has been pressing Congress to
adopt its proposal for post-war mar-
ginal mining subsidies ever since 1942.
If those proposals had been adopted,
as Mine-Mill repeatedly demanded,
then mines like the one at White Pine
would already be in production——at
a cost of far less than $100,000,000 to
the taxpayers.

Maritime - .
  Demand right to ,
continue bargaining

 

WASHINGTON (FP) —— Maritime A

.. Administrator E. L. Cochrane last
week was studying the minimum de-
mands of most maritime unions for
participation in the proposed National
Shipping Authority in case of war.

The policy calls for _allocation of all
ships under the authority to private
U.S. firms for operation, limitation of
the Military Sea Transport Service to
operation of troop transports with pri-

  ,_ vate ships carrying all cargoes includ-

” ing munitions and manned by civilian

personnel, representation of unions on

the policy level of the p r o p o s e d

authority and retention of collective

bargaining. ’

Cochrane said the statement of
policy will be submitted to a joint
meeting of representatives of the
maritime administration, shippers and -
unions.

Approving the statement were the
Natl. Maritime Union, Marine Engi-
neers Beneficial Assn., American,
Radio Assn. (all C10), Seafarers Int’l
Union, Sailors Union of the Pacific,
Natl. Organization of Masters Mates
& Pilots (all AFL) and Marine Fire-
men Watertenders Oilers & Wipers
Assn.

The statement included most of the
demands of the Int’l Longshoremen’s
& Warehousemen’s Union and Na-
tional Union of Marine Cooks'&
Stewards though they had also de-
manded an FEPC provision. They
were not included in the caucus which
drew up the statement. ~

MCS Secretary-Treasurer Eddie
Tangen told Cochrane in a separate
statement, the marine cooks’ union
“will oppose with all its strength any
attempt to reconstitute the National
Shipping Authority along the lines of
the U.S. Shipping Board (of World
__ War II) which carried out the ship-
 ~-f re,‘ owners" program of union-busting and
‘ ‘ was manned for and by the shipown-

ers."

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOOOOIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

WASHINGTON (FP)—As the gov-

'_v,, _,,  ernment continued to wrestle with the
 problem of wage and price control,

the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
came up with figures which give a
graphic illustration of how little real
wages have, increased since 1939.
The bureau’s regular industry re-
‘ port on h purs and earnings which
‘ , . covers the period up to and including
"rr . October 1950 shows that production
~workers in manufacturing in October

‘earned an average of $61.99 a week.

This,/was 259.8% of the average gross
 g-Mﬂweekly earnings of that group in
"'”’i " ’ 1939. . -

Butstill talking in terms of current
dollars, a worker‘ with no dependents,
the.’ report sholws, would have only
$52.16 left after paying tax and other

 , deductions where he works. If the ..
-‘ ' dollars are translated into terms of ,

' 1939 dollars by taking into considera- 4
tion the cost-of-living increase, the
worker with. no depend_ents- had only ‘
$29.66 left. This means‘ that hisreal
spendable earnings since 1939 have
increased only $6-.08_,a week. His.net

;_,spendable earnings in 1939- had been

$23.58, which represented practically
all of his gross earnings of $23.86.

, IF THE WORKER had three de-
pendents, his net spendable \income in
terms of 1939 dollars last October was
a little higher, $33.66 a week. But
economists figured this would be of

little help to him since he is faced

with the problem of feeding, clothing
and housing» the three depend-en-ts. The
difference between him and the .man
with no dependents is accounted for
by income tax deductions.

The BLS says the- tables showing
net spendable earnings in terms of
1939 dollars are obtained by ( 1) “ad-
justment for changes in purchasing
power as determined from the con-
sumers’ price index” and (2) deduct-
ing taxes. - ‘

“Since these deductions generally
were not large prior to the extension
of «personal income taxes into the
lower brackets, gross weekly earnings
were satisfactory as a measure‘ of the
trends of weekly earnings available
for spending,”. the BLS ‘says.

From Vol. II, No. 1, Miner's Magazine,
January, 1901. This was the offi-
cial publication of the Western
Federation of Miners, predeces-
sor of Mine-Mill.

\

Papers explain Copper King Mar-
cus Da~ly’s death thus:

“The diseases from which he suf-
fered had been brought on by his con-
stant presence in his mines and
smelters, where he rigidly supervised
the work of his men. Unremitting
labor in high altitudes and in air
permeated with arsenic which is
present in smelting operations, weak-
ened his heart.”

We ask: How about the thousands
of men who did the work that he
‘supervised,’ who had to breathe that
poison laden airrfor 12 hours a day
in order to hold their jobs?

++§

Re-port from Wm. D. Haywood,
General Executive Board Member-—

Returning from Butte, Mont., after
the meeting of the Executive Board,
Brother Williams and I visited the
Coeur d’Alene district. Here the spirit
offraternity and unity pervades the
ranks of organized labor as in no
other locality; every individual seems
to appreciate his responsibility and
all are working for a common cause.

Phoenix-like, t-hese‘ d i s r u p t e d
unions have arisen stronger and bet-

ter for the crucial tests they have un-
dergone. “Unionism never dies.”

Too much praise cannot. be,be-
stowed upon the noble women of the
Coeur d’Alenes. Their patience and
Spartan courage during the many

‘months of trials and troubles are nev-
er to be forgotten. This exemplifies
the good to be derived from a wom-
.en’s auxiliary to the Western Federa-
tion of Miners.’

Railroad brotherhoods reject
Steelman plan, press formore.

ST. LOUIS (FP)——The lineup of
railroad brotherhoods against a pro-
posed wage-hour settlement worked
out by Presidential Assistant John R.
Steelman was complete as the Order
of Railway Conductors voted here to
reject the plan.

The ORC was the last of the four
unions involved to vote on the Steel-
man proposal, which was tentatively
agreed to after the White House forced
a halt to a fast—spreading rank-and-
file rail strike.

The conductors acted two days
after a similar rejection was voted in
Cleveland at a joint conference of 250
general chairmen of the Brotherhoods
of Railroad Trainmen and Locomo-
tive Firemen & Enginemen. First
union to turn down the settlement
was the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, which instructed its ne-
gatiators to return to Washington and
seek a “more favorable” settlement.

Pointing out that the settlement
would make Steelman the final arbi-
ter in any dispute over changes in

rules, spokesmen for the two brother-

hoods said:

“The chairmen refused to entrust
such vital conditions of employment
to settlement by any other means
than by direct conference across the
bargaining table. These‘ issues in-

/

Ad...

 

volve delicate employer-emzploye 

lationships. They should be 5:
by and between the worker at:
employer.” '

SUMMING UP the White 
offer, the trainmen and tiremen"_
“Our men are being asked to an

a settlement inferior to that gram...‘

other rail workers almost two years,’
ago and to accept it at the time when
all workers are seeking still another
wage adjustment to keep pace with
rapidly rising living costs.

“The 3-year moratorium, as pro-
posed, would be clamped on our men
without an adequate (upward adjust-
ment of wages having first been made.

. While workers in other industries are

now getting their fourth'and fifth-

-4}

round increases, our men are 

denied ‘a justifiable and long overdue
third-round increase.”

The union spokesmen saidthe 3-00,-
O00 workers they represent are en-
titled to a 35c hourly increase and an

immediate 40-hour week. They pointed.
out that not only had one million

non—operating railway workers al-

ready received the 40-hour week with.”

48 hours pay, but that they had re-
ceived an additional 7c hourly wage
increase. They also strenuously ob-
jected to the changes in working con-
ditions Steelman accepted from the
operators. . -

This increased tie of Canadian industry to Wall Street means
that the interests of tl1eVyvorki11g people of the two countries he-
come even more closely linked. It means that the historic tie be-

ternational Union takes on an even greater significance.

It means a continued an-d intensified struggle to close, the

Since 1935 the company's profits
have been maintained at between
,$25 million and $39 million a year.

Return on net worth, except in de-_

pression years, has ranged from 10%

has increased the cost of l_iving but
has in effect slashed deep into. arms

U. 5. business wields

big influence in C anad

NEW YORK (FP)—U. S. business-
men invested an estimated $1 billion
in the expanding Canadian economy
in 1950 and now hold 740}. of the
foreign investments there.

The extent of American, economic
domination over Canada was revealed
in the December 23 issue of Business
Week, which ran a 10-page report on
the subject.

Pointing out that this year's $1 bil-
lioninvestment is more than Ameri-
can businessmen sank into Canada
during all four years 1946-49,, Busi-
ness Week said: “Since this is obvi-
ously no act of charity. U. S- busi-
ness men must have their reasons. . .
' “Most U, S. compa_m'es th.in.lc of Ca-
nada as almost a part of the U. S.
Investment there, they feel, is noth-
ing like as risky as the usual foreign
investment. Thus_.,2,200 U. S. com-
panies haive Canadian plants, - and

U. S. capital has helped finance many

a Canadian—controlled company,”

Among the incentives to U. S. in-
vestors are huge newly discovered re-
sources of oil and iron ore, corporate
tax laws that favor business and a
wage scale‘ considerably lower than
in the U. S. ‘Average weekly wage in
Canada’s eight leading industries
stood at $45.26 in August 1950. Latest
3V€1‘age Weekly wage in U. S. manu-
facturing was $62.06. (The Mine-Mill
average is higher than this in both
countries.)
