They are seeking to throw the welfare of: our membership into

the laps of a movement outside of labor whose plans they are now‘ V C

publicly broadcasting and working feverishly to accomplish in Wash-

The payoff for a few of these weakekneed and thin-skinned lead-

’ -.ers is already obvious, and the Montana miners and sm_elter.men- will

judge accordingly now the deal is uncoxiered. It is
‘ ironic and a shame- that the actions of a few must, as
always” in the history of labor, bring losses to the real
g_uy—the miner, the n11ucl«:er,/ the smelterman and his
family. — __ . l - 1 “  .

Of the‘63~panel members',.there were

only 3 Mexican-Americans, in contrast

to a Mexican-American percentage of
60 to '65 -per cent in the county. This
is of major importance, because a ma-
jority of Mine-Mill members in E1 Paso
and in Jenck’s local at Bayard are

. *Mexic=an-Americans. .

There were no farmers or farm
workers, and only two Negroes on the
panel. — v r .

A second motion asked a "change of
