 bringing the membership and

resident (in

By JOHN CLARK

NON FRIDAY, January 28 an astounding de-

velopment came about which has had an effect

not only upon our Union and its membership but also on
every ’honest—minded citizen in the nation.

“ The filing for a new trial in El Paso, Texas, for dis-

missal of the Jencks conviction on the grounds of new

1. ’, evidence by counsel for the International Union should
. ~ create consternation in the minds of those who threw

both civil ethics and civil liberties to the four winds in
order to jail a militant labor leader.

The reformation of the key witness or informer in
this nation-wide case is a revelation in the vagaries of

‘the human mind. Heretofore we have seen the union

renegade turn stoolpigeon or informer, and continue——-
in order to whitewash his filthy s-oul’——to invent and
distort further illusions to pillory those who in his ter-
mitish mind are fulfilling the jobs laid down by \the.mem-
bers of the union. Such are Ken Eckert,’ Paul Crouch and

. dozens of others. ‘

‘To remedy the harm I have ‘done'

 THIS CASE, we see the opposite—that of a man

willingly facing the charge of perjury, willingly facing
a possible jail sentence, willingly facing his former em-
ployers in a sweeping denial of the evidence he had sworn
to, in order “to dowhat I can to remedy the harm I have
done to Clinton Jencks and to the administration of

. justice.”
I It doesn’t take a man to swear and inform against _-
' his fellow workers. Mr. Matusow must have the core of
‘a real human being to take the drastic step he has taken
to try to remove the stigma he has placed upon many of
, his fellow citizens. - c‘ '

‘It will be interesting to follow through with this in

. " l the case of Mine-Mill. Aside from the Jencks case, we

have the McCarran he-arings in Salt Lake City. Blazing
headlines in the papers, built on his evidence, accused
this Union of calling‘ copper strikes to interfere with’ the

7 Koreanwar, accused its officers of subversion, disloyalty

 r and everything in the book. This was part of a scheme to

f  destroy this Union to fit the purpose of the metal -mining
T . industry.

Will the press now break its bondage to the industry
to, the‘ point of playing up Matusow’s affidavit in the

 _same screaming headlines it used for his false testimony?

‘False Witness‘

“  MATUSOW’S book,-False Witness, will be off the

press in a few weeks. It covers not only subjects referred
to above, but also many others concerned with his false

 testimony before congressional investigating committees,
. gr

and juries and other bodies, his work for McCarthy and

J V for the publication Counter-Attack.

, It is a revelation in the back-stage workings of re-
action against those who refuse to conform to one line of

 thinking. It will helppin the fight ‘to bring truth against
’ slander and hysteria.

PHILLIPSBURG l0CAl PLAYS SANTA CLAUS: , last Christmas Phillipsburg Miners Union No. 24 took
charge of sponsorship of the town's Christmas tree proiect, previously handled by the American legion

and the legion Auxiliary.

The local Union made up ‘‘treats'’ for some 500 kiddies In Phillipsburg and Maxvllle, a nearby
community. The treats were given out by Santa at a big party held on Christmas Eve. The Local Union
imported Santa Claus from “Santa Claus Village, Mont.", near Missoula. Santa's sleigh was drawn by
two young elk. After the treats were given out the kids were entertained by a movie.

As part of the holiday season program, the movie “Salt of the Earth" was shown at the town

theatre.

Citizens and‘ businesses of Phillipsburg helped out ot make the program a success.
The committee in charge were Fred Superneay, Pres.; Forrest Stube, Vice Pres., and William "Bill"

  Travis issues Coll ,
e to 50!]! Convention  

DEN VER—A call to the Fiftieth Convention of thelnternational Union was sent
thismonth to every affiliated Local Union by Secretary-Treasurer M. E. Travis. The

Convention will be held in Spokane, Wash., the week of March 14.

As recommended by the 1953 Convention and voted by the membership in a ref-
erendum on November 2, 1953, our convention month now is March instead -of Septem-
ber. Election of officers to be nominated at the Convention will be held Mayv3, and '
those elected will begin their terms of office on July 1. I

One reason for the change was to combine the Convention and the bargaining‘ ,
conferences which have been held in March, so that the whole Conventiorf will b
able to discuss and vote on bargaining policy for the current year. i

“In this, its sixty-second year, the Inter national Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers holds its Convention in the Spring for the first time in several decades,” the
Call states. “This change appropriately occurs in what well may be a year of -decision

for our Union.”

After reviewing the past year’s “events in the United States and Canada, the Call
pdints to some of the issues to be dealt with by our Union’s Fiftieth Convention:

“1955 is a year of promise. ‘Yes, it will also
be a year of struggle for the survival of a
free trade uniqn movement in the United States.

-President Eisenhower’s threat of 50 years‘ of
.._cold war is the big business road to poverty,

insecurity and destruction. The Brownell-But-
ler law will face our Union and, before long
all unions, with the threat of a Hitler-type
labor front. Further raids; indictments of union
officials under the Taft-Hartley law or other
anti-labor statutes, pose continuing burdens for
bur members. ‘

“The struggle will go on against high prices,
high taxes, unemployment and wage-cutting em-
ployers. So will the fight against the brass hats’
attempt to pass Eisenhower’s subterfuge for uni-
versal military training. \ ‘

“But we still say that 1955 is a year of prom-
ise. Indictments will be defeated. The schools will
be desegregated. World tensions will be further
abated. And the cause of labor unity will take
great strides forward.

“At last real possibilities of labor unity have
begun to emerge from the disorder and conflict
which have raged for several years. Labor unity
is the keynote to "preservation of the trade union
movement; labor unity in action in the bargain-
ing, political and civil rights areas. Such unity
can lead to organic merger of labor organizations
which have as their common goal the elimina-
tion of discrimination, protection of the Bill of
Rights and a concerted struggle for a better way
of life for their members. There are many signs
of this kind of unity in our own industry.

“This Convention will draft a program for the
workers in the non—ferrous metals industry of
the United States and Canada. Within the frame-
work of such a program, we will cooperate with
allies among the workers of these two countries
to improve the welfare of all people. Our bar-
gaining objectives will enable the rallying of all
the workers in the industry. By ou_r allied leader-
ship, we must guarantee that political promises
are fulfilled. By our persistent effort, the goals
of peace, of negotiations instead of war, of free-
dom of speech, thought and assembly will be
assured. ‘ ‘

“In connection with this Convention, the var-

ious bargaining councils will meet to enable
the Convention itself to define our overall bar-
gaining program. _ *

“At this Convention, nominations will be made

. for Officers and Board Members to be elected

by referendum, who will serve the International
Union in the years from July 1, to June 30, 1957.

 

Constitutional amendments may be proposed and .

referred to membership referendum. It is of ut-
most importance to thewelfare of every local

union that it be represen_ted, by delegates on V

the Convention floor.

Anaconda ~loc’aI  
remembers’ its
old - timers

ANACONDA, _Mon't.—Last Christmas, Mine-
Mill Local 117 decided that the Old Timers that
helped build Mine-Mill in Anaconda were not for-
gettable. A committee of Shop Stewards‘ was

selected to prepare and deliver a Christmas "

Basket to the homes of all old timers, pensioners
and disabled members still living in the area.

An “Old Timers Party” was held at the Union

‘Hall the night of December 30.‘ All Old Timers

and their wives were invited, which resulted in

an overflow crowd. A variety entertainment pro‘-
gram was arranged, with loca-l talent, consisting
of music, singing, recitals, a magician.

Several old timers made wonderful talks about
their experiences in building the Union-. Dan
McKittrick, former President of Local 117, now
Mayor of Anaconda, was master of ceremonies.

Brother Art Campbell was chairman of the
Christmas basket program‘ and Brother Ed. John-

son was chairman of the old timers party ar-

rangements‘ committee.

The Local Union has received many letters,
cards and phone ‘calls from the old timers ex-

pressing appreciation for the “wonderful time"

they had during the holiday season.

interest running so high that
everyone got to work 15 min-

about how in 1903. the Company
set ‘up a “Blue Card” system,
and when you would come off
shift you would find this “Blue
._ Card” instead of your work
number, which meant that you
were fired and blacklisted. Can-

non got one of these Blue Cards»

in’ 1903, which kept him off the
hill for four years.

He also told about going to

the difference between wages
and working conditions now and
before the Union was organized
inthis area. He said Mine—Mill

had done an unparalleled job on .,
behalf of the miners, millmen ,

and smeltermen “in this section.

In talking to Brother Pramen-
ko we learned that he is one of
the old timers in the struggle
to build Mine-
Mill in Ana-
conda. He be-
came a regu-
lar employee
of the ACM
Company in
190% but
worked off
and on all the '
way back to Mike lframenlto
1903, and continued until he re-
tired in 1951.

Brother Pramenko is a strong
Mine-Mill supporter. He said
that Mine-Mill had done a won-
derful job in improving wages
and working conditions at the
smelter._ '

Acm lolalzyists defeat 3  
collar-to-collurbill   ” ’

HELENA, Mont.—-A campaign of falsehood and
trickery on the part of the Ana‘conda Copper Miningv’ 
Company resulted in the defe.at here of a bill to provide. 1
eight—hour, collar-to-collar day for underground miners. S
The bill, introduced by State Rep. Ray Lee (D. Silver 51*
Bow), a member of Butte Miners Uni-on No. 1, was killed 

on roll-call, vote, 65 to 22.

In a statement in.the Mine-Mill Butte Miner, Lee
d be shocked by the shabbyIIII

said :

,“All Butte miners shoul

treatment of our bill.

“The. defeat of the bill means’

that while other metal miners
throughout the country enjoy
-the eight-hour day, the Butte
miners will continue to donate
more than three weeks of un-
paid time to the ACM company
every year. '

“The company lobbyists are
responsible for the defeat_of the
collar‘-to-collar bill. They mana-
ged tomaneuver the bill into
a ‘position where no advertised
public hearing was held where
the supporters of the bill would
have been able to explain the
provisions of the measure and
the reasons for its introduc-
tion.”

The bill won the votes of
Democratic Majority Leader
Mahoney and Speaker of the
House Graybill. The GOP min-
ority leader voted against the
bill. Lee and Rep. Frank Rear-
don, Democrat, were the only
Butte legislators to vote in
favor of the bill.

it . fall for vagueness. .

Two  Lattimore indictments
  dismissed —‘vague, ton-unless,’
like those in Travis case

/i'lOW ‘DARE YOU CALL
.M‘I.'Hl1ZED _W|TNE$$

 A stool.“-PteEON 1 ~

WASHlNGTON—-U. S. District Judge Luther Youngdahl this month dismissed

two indictments accusing Owen Lattimore of swearing‘ falsely when he denied he
had ever been a supporter of Communist interests, or “follower of the Communist

line.”

In. dismissing‘ the indictments, Judge Youngdahl used language which could well
., apply to the indictment of Mine-Mill Secretai'y-Treasurer Travis on a charge of falsi-
fying his Taft-Hartley non-Communist affidavit. Arguments of Lattimore’s attorneys
—-that the indictments violatedboth the First and Sixth amendments to the Constitu-
- tion—-were simliar to those of Travis’ attorneys in a Denver court proceeding Jan-
“ ‘rfuary 12. ‘ ’ _ g .
. Lattimore is a Johns Hopkins University professor and former advisor to the

State Department. Other indictments against him had been dismissed ‘by Judge

Youngdahl in May, 1953. Five others still are before the court.

‘Too Vague‘ .

    , Iv
Judge Youngdal1l’s opinion dealt with vagueness of the indictments, which he

well as Article II of the Constitution. _
In his opinion, Judge Youngdahl said:
“'l‘o require defendant (Lattimore) to S0 0“
trial for perjury under charges so formless and,
obscure as those before the court would make a
sham of the sixth amendment and the federal
rule requiring specificity of charges.”

‘ ‘Reasonable certainty‘

Youngdahl quoted a standard of definitiveness
from the Circuit Court’s ruling in the prior in-
dictment. It said that criminal statutes “must
have an ascertainable standard of guilt or they
. . An indictment must
charge an offense with such reasonable certainty

‘ L» that the accused can make his defense.”

0
Reviewing the Government charge that Latti-

,more was a “follower of the Communist line,”

Youngdahl first stated that for a jury to con-
clude perjury, it must “determine what the words

it ‘meant to the defendant at the time he offered

them as his testimony, and then conclude that
the defendant did not at that time believe in the-
truth of such testimony according to the meaning
he ascribed to the words and phrases he used.”

Whose.'common knowledge?’
The Government, Youngdahl said, contended

it was a “matter of common knowledge” as to I

what was the “Communist line” and that it was
not a minimal requirement of following the line

 3 “to zig an.d zaig” with it since it did not always

uzigzagpy
D ,
In footnotes Youngdahl commented on the

» contentions:

“Common knowledge of whom? The man in
“the street? A newspaper man? A man of ordi-
naryor of superior. intellect? A member of the
FBI? The Department of Justice? The Internal
Security subcommittee? The State Department?”

9 Government 'zigzags'

On the second point he said: '
“The Government appears to be zigging and

, sagging as to its position and meaning of indict-
: ment terms.” ‘

Youngdahl concluded “follower of the Com-

; munist line is not a phrase with ,a meaning about
.. which men of ordinary intellect could agree . . .

O .

‘ “To ask twelve jurors to agfbe and then de-
cide that the definition of’ the Communist line
found in the indictment is the definition that
defendant had in mind and denied believing in,
is.‘ to ask the jury to aspire to levels of insight

to which the ordinary person is incapable and -
—"'upon which speculation no criminal indictment
 should hinge.”

'Form|ess and indefinite‘

Throwing out the “Communist line” count
and commenting that it could not be “cured by ,a
bill of particulars,” Youngdahl turned in his
opinion to the “promoter of communist interest”

count. ~

0

While the term “promoter” might be definite
enough if tied to specific acts, Youngdahl said, it
had been rendered “formless and indefinite” by
the very definition given by the Government and
the listing of topics which the Government at-
tached to' it. —

"Plagued with vagueness‘

. These included that Lattimore in writing en-
douraged and advanced the political, economic,
military, diplomatic, and social policies of the

Soviet Union, China and any other Communist

countries in certain situations.

I
You-ngdahl noted that the writings were not
alleged to have produced results in a short period
of timeand in isolated instances but over a
fifteen-year period. He said the accusation was

_ “plagued” with “vagueness.”

‘Sweeping. ..vague'

“With so sweeping an indictment‘ with its
many vague charges, and with the existing at-
mosphere and expected loathing for communism,
i would be neither surprising nor unreasonable,

re the jury subconsciously impelled to substi-,
its own understanding for that of defend-

NEW ‘YORK, Jan. 28-—SteWart Alsop, columnist for the New York Herald

Tribune, today revealed in his widely-syndicated column that Harvey Matusow, fin er

man against Clinton J encks and Mine-Mill, has written a book --p a confession t at

ies, congressional hearings .and elsewhere.

After quoting sensational passages from the book, False Witness, Alsop con-
cludes that “Matusow’s revelation simply cannot be ignored, whether by Congress or-

bythe Justice Department,” and that “ . . . this could h

 GAL LYING

Washington, D.C,. —— A

youthful former Communist, ~

former professional witness
and former aide to Senator
Joseph R. McCarthy, is cur-
rently writing a remarkable

A political confession which may

cause major explosions. For
the author of this confession,
Harvey .Matusow, calmly ex-
plains how he made a business
of bearing false witness and
how the American govern-
ment made this business a
profitable one, courtesy of
the American taxpayer. .
An advanced draft of Ma
tusow's book, each page

signed by the aiithor, has_

been obtained by this report-
er. Here is a.n example of the
sort of thing Matusow, who
was a chief witness against

Owen Lattimore, liaﬁs i'e- ‘
_vealed: '

"‘I climaxed my testimony
with the dramatic assertion
that Owen Lattimore’s book
was used as the official Com-

munist Party guide on Asia.‘

“Once again, I told a com-
plete falsehood . . . I didn’t
care what happened to Latti-
more. ‘I cared about what was

' going to happen to me. My

unfounded attacks on Latti-
more just placed me in the
role of expert of the experts.
I had reached the top of the
ladder. Lattimore was later
indicted.”

0

Lattimore is still, of course,
under indictment. Obviously,
M a t u s o w ’ s remarkable de-
cision to tell how he lied and
thus risk going to _']all for
perjury, is likely to make a
lot of extra work for the Jus-
tice Department. _

Matusow has already signed
one affidavit in which he ad-
mits false testimony in a case
in which he was a chief gov-
ernment witness. No doubt,
there willbe more such affi-
davits. _ «

Legal lying by such profes-

sional ex-Communist inform-
ers as Matusow, which has
been tolerated by all three
branches of the American
government, has done irre-
parable harm to the individual
American citizen. But it has
done irreparable harmto the
whole American . political pro-
cess. Consider the following
example of the political status
of the— legal lie. .

Matusow was to testify be-
fore the McCarran Commit-
tee at hearings in Salt Lake
City-—his testimony Was, of
course, privileged, or libel-
proof:

“I had also made up my,

mind how I would place in
the record a statement of the
number of Communists work-
ing for the NEW YORK
TIMES and TIME Magazine.
1 had previously discussed
this with Senator McCarthy
and had his approval. Once
the ‘facts’ were in the record

i McCarthy knew that he could

accuse the TIMES and TIME
Magazine, Inc. of being pro-
Communist.”

Or consider this example,
when McCarthy sent Matusow
into Montana in 1952 to at-
tack the Democratic senator-
ial candidate, Mike Mansfield:

“As I talked I reached in
my briefcase, using the same
gestures I had seen Senator
McCarthy so frequently use
‘now I have here’ in my brief-
case documented proof . . . ’
I pulled out a photostatic copy
of an old copy of the Commu-
nist Party publication NEW
MASSES. The im.pr_ession was
that 'it contained a by-lined
story by Mansfield; that he
had written the story and had
actively, knowingly, support-
ed the Communist Party but
I knew that the story was
merely a re-print of his’re-

,marks in the Congressional

Record.”

There is no space here to

convey the full gamey flavor.

of Matsuow’s revelation but
the example quoted suggests

how incredible it is th.at.Ma— ,

tusow should have continued
to receive taxpayers’ money
for his «services as an “expert
witness.” It may be said, of
course, that Matsuow, having
lied before is lying now when
he admits the lies. It may also
be said that Matsuow, having
swung from Communism to
McCarthyism, has completed

— the circle and the fact that

his publishers have a decided-
ly left-wing coloration will be
cited in support of this charge.

_Certainly on the record
cited by Matusow himself, no
one would be likely to claim
of him exceptiogial trust-
worthiness or political wis-
d_om. Yet he has documenta-
tion forpmost of his amazing
story and the story is also
inherently credible, simply be-
cause Matusow himself is the
chief object of his own accu-
sations. At anyii-ate, Matu-
sow’s, revelation simply can-
not be ignored, whether by
Congress or by the Justice De-
partment.

In this sense, in writing his
astonishing confession, Matu-
sow may more than compen-
sate_for the harm he has done.
Obviously, some ex—Commu-
nist informers h av e per-
formed a useful service. But
in the years since the trial of
Alger Hiss, the cult of the
ex—Communist as the undis-
puted arbitrer of the loyalty
of other citizens has grown
like a cancer.

_ Matusow’s confession is
likely to initiate a, serious in-

vestigation of. this new post-

war profession of the inform-
er, and this could have good

results for the political health '

of the UBiive€tr$t§t?§t-i"1«Wl .

HARVEY  MATUSOW, being duly sworn, de-

‘poses and says:

1. I make this affidavit in support of the motion
by the defendant for a new trial, and to do what I
can to remedy the harm I have done to Clinton E.
Jencks and to the administration of justice. ~

.2. MI appearedlas a witness for the Government

 against the defendant in the course of the ,trial in this

Court in January, 1954, on an indictment charging Mr.

 Jencks with having filed a false non-Communist af-

fidavit with the National Labor Relations Board on
April 28, 1950. My testimony appears in the type-

» written transcript of the record from p. 579 to p. 703.

-\

3. The matters I testified to were either false
or‘not entirelyitrue, and were known by me to be
either false or not entirely true, at the time I so
testified, in that :'

A. I testified that in July and August, 1950, I
visited the San Cristobal‘ Valley Ranch in Northern
New Mexico, and met the defendant there. While

tjfied about a lecture given by the defendant at the
Ranch.

at.

I testified that the first conversation took place
in thepresence of one Marcus. I testified that in the

I course of this conversation, I stated that I had. left

New York permanently and was thinking of" living

I; either in New Mexico or California, in which event I
.- would transfer my Communist Party membership.
’ The defendant’s comment on this, according to my
‘ -tesitiinony, was: f‘It is a good idea, we can use more

active Communists out here” (R. .586).

 It is untrue that on the occasion of this conversa-

  tion, the defendant (said, “It is a good idea, we can

juseinore active Communists out here." Thedefendant

it made no such statement.

,B. I testified that in the second conversation, the

» defendant -again expressed approval of my proposed

-transfer of my Communist Party membership; that
we discussed ways of propagating “the Communist-
sponsored Stockholm Peace Appeal” which the de-
fendant was planning to lecture about at.the Ranch;

. V J thatythe defendant's relations with what I called the
g-“Communist-led” Mexican Miners Union also came

_into this conversation and in this connection the de-

, Ifendant told me that he had had discussions with
, “some of the Mexican Communist organizers” about
. 4. “trying to see that their contracts, both in Mexico and
the United States, ran out at the same time so that

they would be able to end all mining and smelting,
and so forth, in basic metal production in an attempt

to cut off production or slow it down for the Korean -
’ -War effort, which he termed as an unjust and imper-

ialistic war” (R. 588-589). "

Q My testimony relating to the defendant's alleged

discussion with “Mexican Communist organizers" con-

cerning a plot to cut off copper production for the

Korean war was untrue. The defendant made no

such statement.

“spoke about the role of the trade unions in the drive
for peace and the Communist-sponsored Stockholm
Peace Appeal” and “in favor oflthe Soviet Union’s
plan for atomic and other disarmament and putting
an end to the Korean war, being that the United
States was the aggressor nation, We had no business
being in Korea—” R. 589-590). I testified. that in
the library of the Ranch, where the lecture was given,
there were many books published by the Communist
Party and by Communist publishing houses and there
were also copies of a _Communist theoretical magazine
and a Communist newspaper. (R. 590). I testified
that the defendant asked his listeners to read some of
this material .(R. 592). "

It is not true that in his lecture on'August 7 or
8, the defendant, requested the guests of the Ranch
to read Communist Party literature. He did not sin-

gle out any specific literature which was published

by the Communist Party. Nor is it (true that Jencks
in his’ lecture said the other things which I testified
he said. -  ‘ I

D. I testified that in the third conversation be-
tween the defendant and myself, I told the defendant
that I had joined the Taos chapter of ANMA (a, vol-
untary association concerned with the needs and prob-
lems of the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans in
the United States), and the-defendant repliedthat
this was proper. Communist Party concentration:
work; thathe also said he was active in ANMA in
Silver City, thatcit was a key organizationeas far as
Communist activities were concerned in New Mexico,

and that the Communist Party controlled ANMA and A I”

used it as a political sounding board (R._595).

This testimony was untrue. Jencks actually said
that -‘ANMA membership was large in hisunion, the
International\Un‘ion of Mine, Milland Smelter Work-
ers, and that as a union function he took part in
AN MA activities."

4. There was no basis for my stating that Clin-
ton E. Jencks was a member of the Communist Party
at the time I statedso in court.

'.

_5. In addition, my testimony on cross-examina-
tion in the Jencks trial was either false or not en-
tirely true, and was known by _me to be either false
or not entirely’ true at the time I so testified, in the
following respects:

A. My testimony (Rf 613-623), relating to a ‘speech
given by Pettis Perry which referred to testimony I
had given in the trial‘ of the’ United States Govern-
ment vs. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, et al, _in which
Perry was one of the defendants, was untrue in sub-
stance. Mr. Perry did address a meeting which I at-
tended, but I did not testify accurately as to What
he said. At no time during his speech did’ Mr. Perry
advocate the overthrow of the government by setting

' up a Negro Nation or any other way. I also did not

tell the truth about this matter when I was cross-

examined about it in the Jencks trial. _ V V

se:r,1952.,             
Matusow has had a change of heart. He says he wants to “do what I T

can to remedy the harm I have done to Clinton Jencks and‘t_o the adminis-
tration of justice.” So he has sworn out an affidavlt, filed In the court of

U. S. District Judge R. E. Thomason here last Friday. -
The affidavit was attached to a motion for a new J encks trial handed a

the clerk of the court ersonally by Nathan Witt, Mine—MillvGeneral Coun-
sel, and the two other awyers in the J encks defense,.C. B. Elfers, of El Paso

and John T. McTernan of Los Angeles.

Also attached to the motion was a letter which Charles F. Herring,
U. S. Attorney for the western district of Texas, sent to Matusow on Feb-

.‘ ruary 5, 1954--two weeks after the trial.

Herring, who was in charge of the prose-
cution staff, told Matusow frankly that
“your testimony was absolutely essential
to a successful prosecution” in the Jencks
case.

. ’ In I
‘There was no basis
Now, exactly a year later, Matusoxv
swears “There was no basis for my stat-
ing that Clinton E. Jencks was a ineiiiher
of the Communist Party at the time I
stated so in court.” ’ That sworn statement
also appears in his affidavit. ,
M.atusow’s statement, a kind of con-
fession, was expected to open a new chap-..
terin the whole battle against witch hunts.
It was the first time since the so-called
“political trials” began a decade ago that

aﬁkey government witness had recanted

his own sworn testimony. And t_he recan-

tation was sweeplng and sensat1,onal.
Starting early in 1952, Matusow had

been more than an ordinary “professional D

witness.” For almost two and a half
years, he had been one -of the top half-
dozen “pros” in the FBI—Justice Depart-
ment stable——-called upon time after time
to testify in Congressional hearings,
before loyalty boards, in Subversive Activ-
ities Control Board cases, in state witch-
hunts in Ohio and Texas.

‘Copper price junnps
3-: to new 33c level I

/ , -
.1  LONG EXPECTED copper price increase came on Thursday
 January 27, when Anaconda announced a three cents boost to 33

""'“cents a pound. Other producers were expected to follow Anaconda’s
lead shortly.

" This was the first change in the price of copper since April,
1953. The advance followed further increases in London and
 i~Europe where copper 1_ast week was being quoted at around 39

~ cents a pound. _ _ ' .
~  A series of pressures on an already tight supply situation
. brought on the price increase. Chilerecently warned that she would

  
 
  
  
   
 
  
   
 
  
   
   
   
 
  
  
 
  
   
  
   
  
  
     
   
  
  
  
 

paid in the U. 8‘. About 75% of Anaconda’s production and about
,'»,»25% of Kennecott’s is now mined in Chile.

Other pressures stemmed from these developments: «
+1. The Rhodesian copper strike continued into its fourth week;
V 2.’ The A.S.R. El Paso smelter was shut down for repairs and
' 5. is expected to be down for from four to six weeks;

i “ 1 ' 3. The United Kingdom started paying a higher price for
I  Canadian copper——about 32% cents per pound, N. Y. basis;

~ . ‘ ’ , 4. _Copper scrap prices rose to 29 cents a pound for wire scrap,
 which is equivalent to about 331/; cents on a refined basis.

_ . With regard to lead and zinc——the President's proposed budget,
calling for an additional $380 million obligational authority for the
stockpile, indicated that the government will continue to support
" plead and zinc markets for the year beyond June 30.

Other developments in major non—ferrous metalils included:

Corner
0 0 : U. S. copper refinery production in ‘December 1954 was the
 ihighest in the history of the industry. Total refinery output for
'5. the month was /133,523 tons. For the year as a whole,_ 1954 pro-
‘  duction was aboutisix percent less than the previous year—the
" * decline being due both to mid-year strikes and cutbacks by the
 larger producers earlier in the year.
it 7  The greatly increased foreign demand for copper showed up
2 in recently released figures on deliveries. Countries outside the
 ‘ U;‘_.S., in 1954, took 1,247,120 tons of copper, compared with 831,441
" tons in 1953. The 1954 figure on copper deliveries outside the U. S.
.1—-9* isbelieved to be an all-time record._ .

Lead

,  The General Services Administration again asked for offers
I f ' of leadfor the U. S. stockpile. Deliveries of lead to the stockpile
 '- have been averaging between 8,000 and 10,000 tons a month. I
 "Ba-ttery makers——-normally the largest users of lead——'—shipped
.  about 2% fewer batteries in the first 11 months of 1954 than they
5”” didduring the similar period in 1953. ' _

Zine

» ‘Government requests for more’ zinc for the stockpile were ex-
~pec(ted to yield between 15,000 and 20,000 tons from smelter stocks.
 « «Stocks of zinc held by smelters were at 124,077 tons at the end
I poof December, 1954—a‘ 40% drop from their high point of 209,828
,7ﬁ't‘ons’ in May. 1954. The sharp decline was mainly due to the govern-
~’men't’s stepped-up buying program, started last July. -
 Unusually high demand for special high-grade zinc by auto
_, 1 parts makers featured recent zinc markets. The high-grade zinc

-Jlnow‘ sells for one and a half cents above the standard Prime

We had just finished reading
Mine-Mill's so-called silicosis
bill. Neversweat Slim finished
his beer and walked over to
the pinball machine. I followed
him over and watched while he
began to play. With lights
flashing and bells ringing,
Slim seemed intent on getting
the balls into scoring position,
but he had that Will Rogers
look on his face again and I
knew he was thinking about
the bill.

“It’s a strange’ sight to be-

‘ hold, Buster,” he said as he used

some body-English 6n the last

ball. Like a good straight-man,‘

I asked him what’s that.

“How a corporation with its
wealth and well-oiled propa-
ganda machine can arrange
things so that the taxpayers
will pay the corporation’s just
debts and the people are un-
—aware that they're even doin’
it.” I “

I asked Slim was he refer-
ring to silicosis, and he nofl-ad
he was. -« “"

“Take this state,~ for exam-
ple,” he said. “Why, year after

icans hate to yield to force or
compulsion. They know we love
freedom, so they talk about all
this compulsory unionism, try-
ing to turn the workers against
the only true protector they
have against getting a raw ‘deal
on the job.

So this, cry, “The Right to"

Work,” has been coined bybig

business in their anti-union
campaigns and it's just another
big lie, but tell it loud enough
and often enough and long
enough and people will actually
begin to believe it. /

Union shop clauses are agreed

anyone to belong to the union.

nearly a half-million dollars in
$60 a month payments to sili-

cost the Company a dime. The

I asked Slim his opinion of

the new bill to set up an Oc-

said, “one that will not only in-‘

put the expense load where it

IT’S ‘HIGH TIME we/were
waking up to what is happen-
ing and fight back at those who
would use the ridiculous slogan
of “The Right to Work Bill" to
set organized labor back to the
days when they sought to force
each worker to bargain indi-
vidually.

There is no limit to which
they won't go or any depth to
which they won't stoop to gain

the destruction of our American

'11] King reports overseas
unions anxious for contact

.With U. S. labor  move111c-nt

VANCOUVER, B. C.——-“The most frequent question asked me in nine countries
of Europe was, ‘Why doesn’t United States send delegates to us as Canada does?’.’’

So reported Al King, Trail Local 480, to the delegates ofthe 12th Annual Dis-
trict Convention, in telling about his trip to Europe last summer, as a fraternal
delegate to the Metals Unions of France. ,

“I found it difficult to make clear to unionists just what faces U. S. unionis1n,”
he said. “They can’t understand it, even in the light of their superior political under-

standing. And let me tell ‘you,
we may think Mine-Mill Is an
enlightened union, but ‘it’: very
backward in contrast to Euro-
pean unions.” 1 ,

Brother King found the great-
est ease of __movement was pos-
sible throughout all countries.
They went where they pleased
and saw what they wanted to,
took pictures freely wherever
they went, and found customs at
borders wholly perfunctory —_—-
until reaching Canada again on
his return. There he was strip-
ped, searched, and interrogated,
for the first time in a 9-coun-
try journey. “As far as I am
concerned, the Iron Curtain sur-

rounds North America!” he
said.
Problems the some -

At the Metallurgical Trade
Unions convention in Vienna,
,King found the internal prob-
lems of the delegates to be
‘much the same as those of Can-
adian unions, all the mines and
stnelters of Europe carrying
their own dangers of dust and
lead, just as in British Colum-
bia. However, delegates from
some countries, still under co-
lonialism,’ told stories of the in-
tense struggle for their rights
that complicates the problems
common to all unions.

Invited after the convention

the Americas.

to become part of a trade union
delegation to‘ the Soviet Union,
King met them in Moscow, and
spent the following weeks visit-
ing plants, mines, collective

farms, cultural activities and

exhibits, and had an interesting
time in the rest homes and san-

- ltaria of the Crimea.

World I trade,

In the Black Sea port of
Odessa he found ships from all
but North ‘American countries
loading and unloading, a scene

that was of bitter interest to the ’

delegates from shipyard unions,
who have watched Canadian
shipping decline into non—exis-
tence since the war.

Everywhere the delegates
went in Europe they found
peace to be the first preoccupa-
tion of the people. “There is an
almost complete absence of the
type of editorializing and indoc-
trination for war we read in
most American and some Can-
adian publications,” he reported.

Ifeople want no war

“Here an atmosphere prevails

“I left Europe with the posi-

ARE THEY THINKING OF YOU?

TORONTO, Ont.—-—The pala-
tial summer home, at Pugwash,
Nova Scotia, of Cyrus Eaton,
Cleveland industrialist, is being
turned over by the Iron and
Steel magnate to the “great
minds” of Canada, as a sanctu-
ary where they can think in
peace, far from the turmoil of
the everyday world. Here the
leaders of our nation in the
political, industrial, cultural,
educational, scientific and la.-
bour fields will be able to dis-
cuss the world’s problems in se-

O clusion from the world and its

ordinary people.

All, of course, at the expense
of Mr. Cyrus Eaton, who with
his ‘ U. S. business associates

‘ The MINE-MILL UNION

Mr.' Eaton!

have just gobbled up Canada’s
rich iron ore resources in On-
tario and Quebec. This is Mr.
Eaton’s way of expressing his
“gratitude” to the Canadian
people,,for what is considered
the. biggest steal in Canada’s
history.

Some people will probably say
that he will expect the recipi-
ents of his hospitality to look
favorably on the despoiling of
Canada’s resources by U. S.
big business. But surely this
would be doing an injustice to

The motives of Mr. Cyrus
Eaton n twithstanding, we ‘now
have in"Canada a place where
“respectable” labour le a d e rs

may retire to quietly meditate
on what to do about the fact
that their membership are de-
manding wage increases and

better living standards.

A difficult problem indeed,
with unions like Mine Mill re-
fusing to yield to the NO in-
crease line of the boss and set-
ting an example to other work-
ers. Deep thoughts in the cool
majestic rooms of the estate,
and on the lovely spacious
grounds, together with seven
course dinners and cocktails,
should do much to convince a
labour leader that actually the

workers’ wages are not too bad,

No doubt Mr. Mosher, C.C.L.
President, will find it a delight-

B; c. Death Benefit man" ,

 

paid I 7 claims in 1954

VANCOUVER, B. C.——Seven~
teen claims were paid under the
Death Benefit Plan of the B. C.
District Union in 1954, District
Secretary Les Walker reported
at the end of the year.

The plan was inaugurated in
1-948,«-and since then 45 glaims
have been paid, the higher in-
cidence the last two years. be-
ing‘ due to an increased number
of locals participating. In 1948
only two claims were paid, and
in 1951 none.

The plan provides for a death .

benefit of $1,000 for the sur-
vivors of any brothers killed on
the job. Eligibility is adjudi-
cated entirely by the participat-
ing local to which the brother
belongs, and ‘the plan is sup-
ported by an assessment of only
fifteen cents a month, although
this is made elastic on an (ac-
tuarial basis. Total cost of ad-

on Canadian lenders

VANCOUVER, B. G.-——Taft~4
Hartley made its first attack_oi_1'
a B, C. union January 15, when
two international officers from
Washington swept into town
fired the business staff of Loca
213, Int’l Brotherhood of Elec-
trical Workers, and filled tho
dailies here with an odorous rod
gurgitation of red-baiting, ea.-
gerly gulped down by the Van-
couver Sun and The Province.
At the same time they gave
Mine-Mill “orders” to -vacate
their offices in the IBEW buil
ing, because they also are “reds’
according to the papers, al-
though Terry, the hatchetma'
who quite meekly approache3_
Mine-Mill, said they needed the 
space.

Needless to say: this union,
having a lease good for nearly
a year get, is not going to
move at Washington's direc-

_t'lon.

In a meeting which over-
flowed into the street, the mema.

bers of Local 213 ‘did their best -

to have the charges against *
Business Agent George Gee, As-
sistant B. A. Don Wilson, and
others," including 17 rank-and-
file, ‘read out at the meeting,
but that was refused by Terry
and Johnson, the two Washing-

ton hatchetmen. Then they en- -

deavored to get 9. vote on the
issue, but this was also aborted,
and the meeting resolved itself
into a confusion of red-baiting

‘from the platform amt anti-

Americanism from the floor.
Gee is -very popular among
labor personages here, and in

"his local has been elected as

business agent for term after

term. He ts deposed and sus--

pended simply on the chargc
that he “follows the Commu-
-nist line,” as have all the oth-
ers now under charges.

Another meeting will be held
the first week in February, un-
less _vetoed by the International,
but resentment here is shared
by -all unions at this vicious in-
terference with Canadian af-
fairs. "

Immediately following this
display of arrogance, the, IWA
here announced that at the Au-
gust convention the officers will

seek an amendment to the con- »

stitution to permit expulsion of
any member on “suspicion” of
being a communist. fey ex-
press concern over the largeness
of the vote -against the Interna-

tional-supported officers of Lo- -
-cal 217 this year. It must indi-

cate, they said, that the corn-
munists arebent on getting con-
trol.

B. C. Conveniion adopts resolution
for autonomy of Canadian Mine-Mill

VANCTOIIVER, B. C.—The B. C. District Union of
Mine-Mill, meeting in convention here the week of Jan-
nary 117, sparked a move to “partition” Mine-Mill at the
U. S. border, with complete Canadian autonomy on policy
and funds to the Canadian section; and a Canadian con-

stitution.

The resolution to this effect, passed unanimously,
will be forwarded for the consideration of the Canadian
convention and the International convention at Spokane.

“We have been long discussing this issue in a
friendly, understanding way,” said Canadian Vice Presi-
dent Nels Thibault in supporting the motion. “We find
that the Canadian Mine-Mill Council, while valuable in
many ways. does not quite fill the bill when it comes to
the question of relieving Canadians in an international
union from restrictive U. S. labor laws.

“It's a shame and disgrace,” he declared, “to this

country. that the U. S. should be able to enforce

Hartley here."

'l‘at' t -

Thibault, and William Kennedy, ‘board member of

District 8, were obliged, al-
though Canadians living
and working in Canada, to
take out non-communist
affidavits under Taft-Hart
ley, in order to keep Mine-
Mill in compliance under
the Ta‘l't-Hartley law in the
U. S.

“This is a very historic
occasion,” said President
John Clark. “and the move
proposed here has been
forced by events across the
line. But we are going to
avoid any severance so wide
that the mutual interests
of Canadian and U. S. work-
ers in the industry could be
menaced. We must preserve
unity. in bargaining policies
and plans.”

The president also
stressed that thus freeing
Canadian locals from Amer-
ican domination would re-
sult in greater freedom for
the latter as well.

The idea of closer unity
under autonomy was em-
phasized by all speakers.
“As sponsors of the motion
we had no thought of any
rift developing.” declared
Al King. president of Trail
Local 480 which proposed
the resolution. “We'll fight
any future secession moves
as we have fought those of
the past."

“It's likely to be a long
day before the international
officers of a lot of other
unions propose such a step
towards Canadians control-
ling their own affairs.” said
Doug Gold ' of Kimberley
Local in commending Inter-
national cooperation in the
plan.

“We're not running away
from 'I‘ a ft - H a rt le y,” ex-
plained Regional Director
Harvey M_urph_v. “and we
know we're going to have
a fight in Canada to pre-
vent passage of such laws
here.

“Why should our officers
have to sign an affidavit
under a foreign law? I
wouldn’t give a pledge to
any government. other than
my own. We’re ensuring
that in our union this will
no longer have to be done.”

Other resolutions coming
before the convention pro-

vided for changes in setup

of the District Union and
its activities. contingent
upon fulfillment of the
Canadian autonomy meas-
ures.

referred to the case of.
Local 213, IBEW, in this
city, now placed under vir-
tual administratorship by
the International against
the obvious will of the
rank and file. He also, like
others, affirmed that the
move would strengthen,
rather -than weaken, ties
with the American side,
and that this bond should
be extended to unite with
the trade union movement
on this continent the work-
ers of the industry in all
countries, to preserve our
own standard of living.

T-H for carpenters?

VICTORIA, B. C.-—Attempts
to force Taft-Hartley on Can-
nadian locals of the Brother-
hood of Carpenters and Joiners
was seen here when an official
of the Victoria local on Janu-
ary 6 announced that decisions
of the International convention
at Cleveland in November may
be enforced here.

The convention, led by Rob
Hutcheson, amen led the consti-
tution to permit locals to de-
mand affidavits of non-Commu-
nisni from all members, “whose

actions clearly arouse suspi--

cions of communistic leanings,"
failure to comply with such a
demand to be construed “as
clear evidence of guilt.”

So far the report in the Vic-
toria local appears to be the
only recognition accorded the
amendment in this province. ,

B. C. CONVENTION SPEAKERS included: (from left): Board Members Al Pezzati and William Kennedy; William longrldge, Executive Secretary, Con-
