RESISTANCE IS THE LESSON

By Morris U. Schappes

PASSOVER, 1948, will mark the ﬁfth anniversary of the

iunforgettable rising of the Warsaw ghetto. The date
will be the occasion for exercises of commemoration wher-
ever Jews live and wherever heroism in the war against
nazism is still lauded. We who mourn the loss of all our
six million dead‘ pay the special tribute of honor to those
who died fighting._ Boundless pathos and tragedy are
stamped on the death of the unresisting millions who went
down with no hand lifted against the enemy, but inspiration
comes to us from those who took arms and killed Germans
before they died. There is fearful warning but no example
in the millions dead; but the spur to emulation rises like
a light above the unmarked graves of the tens of thousands
of Jews who actively resisted the nazi.

Emulation is still the first order of the day. To do as they
did, is still the first commandment of the ‘Warsaw ghetto
uprising. Those do them little honor who praise them fash-
ionably in words, and fail them dishonorably in deeds.

 

 

 

Speed and timing are essential in battles. As more and
more accounts of the Warsaw ghetto are published, in
Yiddish, Hebrew, English, Polish and other languages, one
great question keeps welling up. Why, in the Warsaw
ghetto that contained all told some 600,000 to 650,000, did
so few ﬁght so late? Why was the real ﬁght begun only
after about a half million Iews had been exterminated,
and there were only some forty or ﬁfty thousand left to
make the last unbending stand? Why did not more ﬁght-
sooner? ’

Perhaps we should ﬁrst inquire: dare we even ask the
question? Dare we Americans,'who did not face the terror
ofnazi occupation at ﬁrst hand, ask why Jews who lived
under that terror in the frightful conditions of the ghetto

 

were so slow to organize resistance? Is there not an irnpious

righteousness and a moral insolence attached to putting the
question? Should we not heed the caution of Marie Syrkin,
that “those who were never subjected to a similar test
should be wary of passing moral judgments” (Blessed I:

the Matclz, The Story of [cu/is}; Resistance, Philadelphia
and New York, 1947, p. 189)?

An Imperative Question

But the matter is not only or even now primarily one of
moral’ judgments given from on high by those who are
on the side—lines of battle. It is urgent for those who wish
to ﬁght fascism and reaction to know whether, from the
point of view of the struggle against the nazi, it was right
or wrong to be passive, to oppose resistance, to die by the
hundreds of thousands with no damage to the enemy, and
to leave it to a remnant at last to take up arms. If it was
wrong, we do not want to repeat that mistake, and therc—
fore we must ask why it was made and analyze the causes.

 

J. Whether we shall have enough intelligence, strength, will

and moral energy to avoid repeating the error, we cannot:
know in advance. But it is an axiom in training for combat,
political as well as physical, that proper judgments on mis-
takes of past campaigns are an aid to victory.

Once the question is placed, the main answers emerge"
without too much diﬂiculty. In general I should say that
resistance in the Warsaw ghetto was so slow in developing‘
because the bulk of the population underestimated the
Germans’ will and capacity for the destruction of the Jews‘-
and overestimated the ultimate strength of the Germans.
Therefore those who told the truth about nazi objectives
were derided as alarmists. Miss Syrkin notes that “despite
the candid declarations ‘of policy by Goebbels and Hitler,
very few believed that these pronouncements [of extermi-V
nation] were more than threats” (Ibia'., p.- 153). ‘

The nazis were cunning in spreading this suspension of
belief in the obvious. They fostered every possible illusion
to prevent that stage of disillusionment that might become
the prelude to an attitude of resistance. They sought to
make the masses feel that their fate depended upon the nazi
will——good-will or caprice-—rather than upon their. own
courage in resisting and thwarting that will.

Ghetto as Escape

In the first place, there were many who accepted the very
idea of segregation in the ghetto, and found “national” and
spiritual comfort in the fact that the nazis had arranged
for a Jewish “administration” (the Iudenrat), Jewish signs
and outward symbols of authority, a Jewish police. While
some Jews tried painfully to organize an underground
resistance, others were soothed by the fact that they could
ride in Jewish-owned street horse-cars painted in blue-and-

o

white, with the Star of David big and clear on the sides.
Thus .Miss Syrkin observes that “to some the ghetto even
appeared as a shelter,” while some who had escaped from
Warsaw to Soviet territory “returned to the Warsaw ghetto
of their own accord. They had heard that an autonomous
I614/is/2 community had ban set up in Warsaw.” (Ibid.,
pp. 153, 157, my emphasis—M. U. S.)

Mary Berg, who escaped from the ghetto after three
years because she was an American citizen, wrote the fol-
lowing in her diary on December 22, 1940, about five weeks
after the ghetto was oﬁicially organized: "The Jewish police
is an accomplished fact. More candidates presented them-
selves than were needed. A special committee chose them,
and ‘pull’ played an important part in -their choice. At the
very end, when only a few posts were available, ‘ money
helped, too. . . .‘ Their uniform consists of a dark blue police
cap and a military belt to which a rubber club is attached.
Over the visor of the cap there is a metal badge bearing the
Star of David and the inscription Iucdischcr 0rdnung:—
dienst (Jewish Order Service). . . . I experience a strange

‘ and utterly illogical feeling of satisfaction when I see a
‘ Jewish policeman at a crossing—-such policemen were con; _
pletely unknown in prewar Poland. . . .” (Warsaw Ghetto,

a Diary, ed. by S. L. Shneiderman, New York,‘ 1945, pp.
40-4.; Those who could see progress and a promise for
the future in such mockeries of Jewish aspirations were of
course not ready to jeopardize these advantages by resistance.

Another factor was the nazi abuse of the Jewish com-
munity’s faith in education. An “oﬂicial” school system
was established and certain types of cultural and artistic
activitieswere encouraged in order to dupe the people. The
idea was nurtured that so long as the Jewish youth could
study the history and culture of their people, learn Yiddish
and Hebrew and so forth, a future of death was incredible.

 

 

This idea had deep popular roots. The nazis depended on
that. Shortly before the official liquidation of the ghetto
began on July 22, 1942 (during the next eight weeks about
300,000 Jews were deported to death), the nazis allowed
the Iudenrat to organize several new elementary classes
and kindergartens, as a blind almost to the very end. Those
who preached self-education as a substitute or a foil for

resistance did not serve our people well.

Nazis Create Palestine Illusion

The Palestine ideal also was exploited by the nazis. Some-
times they were subtle and sometimes they were crude; too
frequently they were successful. On May 20, 1941, Mary

' Berg noted this in her diary: “the German authorities per-

mit a large group of volunteer farm workers to leave the
ghetto every day to cultivate the ﬁelds outside the city. The
work aﬁrordsthe young people of the’ ghetto the opportunity
to breathe a little fresh air. Most members of these groups
are young Zionists who believe that by some miracle they
will succeed in getting to Palestine.4For that reason they

_ are glad to gain experience as farm workers. I look with

a feeling of pride at these ranks of boys and girls who
march along the ghetto streets, returning from work out-
side. All of them are tanned by the sun and refreshed by
the free air they have breathed in the ﬁelds beyond the city.
. . . Every one of them carries a loaf of fresh bread received
from the peasants. Officially it is forbidden to bring bread
in from the outside, but in this case the Germans let it pass
because they need the labor power of these young people.”
(Ibia’., pp. 61-62.) How accommodating of the nazis, to help
train pioneers for Palestine, and even to wink at infractions
of their own regulations to make the Jews strong and
skillful! It took time for the young Zionists, who later

played an important role in the resistance, to turn from"

miracles and illusions to ﬁght against the nazis.

Cruder but even more successful was the nazi ruse by
which they beguiled many Jews who were unregistered in
the ghetto to report their presence. In response to an
announcement calling for registration with the ghetto
authorities of all Iews who wanted to go to Palestine, more
than 150,000 Jews had their names placed on a list that
then made the nazi objective of extermination easier of
attainment, and the warnings of those who exposed the
snare were disregarded. It was not yet seen that Palestine
was attainable, not by the cooperation of, but only over
the dead body of nazism.

Illusions were bred on the basis of wealth and class. The
ghetto was a miserable place, but there were oases, and

money was useful. Mary Berg testiﬁes: “New cafes and

expensive grocery stores have appeared, where everything
can be had. On Sienna and Leszno Streets women are seen
in elegant coats and dresses fashioned by the best dress-
makers. The ghetto even has its own styles. Most women
wear long jackets without collars or lapels, so-called ‘French
blazers,’ and full-skirts. The hats are mostly small . . . high
cork heels . . . stylish colors are gray and dark red . . . good

. dresses of French silk. . . .” (May 20, 1941, p. 60.) And then

health and wealth had their correlations too. Even typhus
did not affect all equally. With hospitals overcrowded,
despair spread. Miss Berg records again: “Setting sick peo—
ple down in front of hospitals has become a daily occur-
rence. Mothers, unable to stand the sight of their ‘children
suffering without medical aid, hope that by this method
they will succeed in getting the patients to a hospital. The
epidemic has assumed a particularly acutevform in the
regions of Gesia, Nalewki, Nowolipki and Nowolipie
Streets. In the Little Ghetto, the situation is somewhat

 

 

better, because it is inhabited by relatively well-to—do people
who can‘ afford private medical care. Recently, antityphus
serum has been imported from Lwow, which fell to the
Germans a month ago. . . . But only wealthy people can
afford to buy it——the price runs as high as several thousand
zlotys a tube.” (July 29, 1941, p. 84.) And so it went, private
medical care, free enterprise, silk dresses, a black market,
and the masses in terrible, dying poverty.

Motive of Self-Presertaation

There. was always a “theory” to explain away the looming-

facts. Mass murders of Jews in other ghettoes could be
reported in Warsaw by eye-witnesses, but they could be

, interpreted as reasons for feeling safer in Warsaw. In

October 1941 the news of mass executions in the Vilna
ghetto arrived and was authenticated, but “an explanation
arose,” states Miss Syrkin, “that the Germans were killing
Jews in former Russian—occupied territories on the charge
that they had supposedly been communists and had sup-
ported the Russian regime. If this reasoning were correct,
the Jews of Warsaw could consider themselves safe, par-
ticularly as large factories had been opened in Warsaw in
which Jews had to work as slave laborers. . . . The slaughter
should be interpreted as an anti-communist rather than as
an anti-Jewish act.” (Pp. 163, 205.) How did this “explana-
tion” arise? Were the nazis the only ones to launch it? Or
were there others already habituated to the idea that it was
safer and better not to be a communist so that the nazi
would regard you as a “good” Jew, and “let” you live? But
those who sighed that communists, even Jewish commu-
nists, might be a scapegoat for them did not fool or divert
the nazi; they made it easier for him to kill Jews according
to his own undisturbed schedule. A

Underlying these and many other phenomena that slowed
up the development of the resistance movement was an
intense individualism that was the product of the basic
social structure of capitalism in which the Iews of the ghetto
had lived. “Save yourself,” “personal survival,” these became
not only ends in themselves, but they were ends that were
considered an adequate justification of any means used.
The ghetto ﬁghters themselves have openly described the
situation. Thus Marek Edelman, active in the Bund1 resist-
ance groups, reports that with the establishment of _the
ghetto, “only the present day really mattered. Only matters
of the most personal nature, the closest circle of friends
were by now the focal point of interest of the average ghetto
inhabitant. The most important thing was simply ‘to be
alive.’ . . . The instinct of self-preservation ﬁnally drove the
people into a state of mind permitting them to disregard
the safety of others in order to save their own necks. . . .”
(The Ghetto Fights, Warsaw, I945, translation into English,
New York, 1946, pp. 5, 18, my emphasis—-—-M. U. S.)

Did this “instinct of self-preservation” lead to self—preser-
vation? On the contrary, it led to mass extermination, and
must be judged as such. In practice, the “cult of self-preser-
vation” was bankrupt and can be no model for new battles.
Tactically, nothing but resistance succeeded; morally,
nothing but resistance was “good.”

There are those who would exculpate, or at least warn
us against harshly judging, not only those who did not
resist but even those who collaborated with the nazi with
the best of intentions. Yet it -is becoming clearer that the
roleof the Iudenrat, for instance, was reprehensible. Miss
Syrkin remarks that the head of the Council, Adam
Czerniakow, “believed that he was tempering the fury of

nazi persecution by his parleys and compromises” (p. 189),
and that when he ﬁnally realized that the Council was
actually administering the orders for the mass deportations
to death that began on July 22, 1942, he immediately com-
mitted suicide the next day. Lest we fall for similar illusions,
however, what should be instructive for us is not what he
believed, but that he was wrong. .
“The condemnation of the Jewish police,” Miss Syrkin
reports, “is more universal” among survivors of the ghetto.
But she asks us, “in justice to them [the Jewish police],” to
believe that the nazis would have been worse had they done
their own policing. Essentially, would the nazis have been
worse? Evidently__ the nazis thought the Jewish police could
do the job better, and they did so good a job for the nazis
that the nazis refrained from killing the Jewish police until
near the very end. On the day the death deportations began,
July 22, 1942, Mary Berg wrote in her diary: “The Jewish
police is charged with the sad task of preserving order
during the deportation and of employing force against those
who refuse to give themselves up. . . . Today the Jewish
police gathered up all the beggars from the streets and
emptied the refugee camps. . . . Today we received a pack-
age of food from Uncle Abie, in which he enclosed a note.

' Fortunately‘ for us, he is on the police force, otherwise he

would not have been admitted to Dzielna Street. His short
note expressed despair. He cannot accept the idea that as
a policeman he will have to help in the deportation, and
is thinking of resigning from his job. But, on the other
hand, his job protects him from deportation. He wants
to know what we think about it. . . . The police must supply
the rest [of the daily quota of deportees] by means of force.
They drag their victims out of their homes or seize them
in the streets.” (Pp. 170-171.)”

2 On September 22, 1942, the nazis ordered the deportation of over

 

Underground Organizes

 

Nevertheless, despite the nazi, terror and the nazi cun-
ning, the Jewish underground began to organize itself. It
was met by a propaganda preaching resistance to the idea
of resistance. In the “safety” of the ghetto, resistance was
denounced as “dangerous,” and the resisters were branded

1 as enemies of the Jews. As Miss Syrkin says very temper-
‘ ately: “there was frequently the active opposition of the
1 Iewish councils and the Jewish police. .  The appeals of the
underground were characterized as the irresponsible propa-
i ganda of young hotheads who were prepared to bring
‘ catastrophe down upon all. Again, it should be remembered
i that this point of view was advanced by people who held
it in good faith. . . .” (Pp. 197-198.) Need it again be asserted
that if ever good faith was a bad justification for ruinous
tactics it was such pre-eminently in this “active opposition”
to the underground? If we have not learned that lesson,
then indeed commemoration of the heroic. uprising becomes
a solemn mockery, serving as an opiate that dulls the sense
of battle, and fathering a code that justifies passivity and

E “the cult of self-preservation.’’
; What was the source, then, of the idea of resistance, which
» ‘spread despite all obstacles? It rose primarily among organ-
ized groups based on class or national consciousness (or
some combination of both), and dedicated to programs of
struggle to achieve their ends. Such groups, before the war
and the institution of the ghetto, had become accustomed,
in their attitudes and conduct, to integrate the aims of the
individual with those of the group and the cause. To the

 

2,000 Jewish policemen and their tamilies, leaving only about 400 of this
police for work still to be done. Uncle Abie, who had decided after all
not to resign, escaped from the nazi round—up, and is last noted in the
diary on October 2, 1943, after the ghetto had been razed, as working
in the Warsaw suburb of Praga.

   

extent that they were dedicated to struggle, these groups
understood that risks were involved, and that victories.were
never won without losses. They realized that they had an

enemy to overcome, and that interfering with the enemy, T

and damaging himiat all costs, was a necessary part of their
program. In one degree or another, their philosophy was
antithetical to that of the “cult of self—preservation."
Therefore it was among the organized labor and Zionist
forc_es——trade unionists, communists, socialists, labor Zion-
ists, socialist-Zionists——-that the resistance took shape. Self-
Lsacriﬁce was not alien to them. Some of them had already
in the past, so it seemed to the self-preservers, “courted”
danger. Thus an Elia Moses, who had been in the Inter-
national Brigade in Loyalist Spain in 1936, was a military
instructor of Warsaw ghetto fighting squads until he was
killed in the summer of 1942. But to be effective, these
separate resistance movements had to be uniﬁed. Unity too
came slowly, but it came. By March and April, 1942, an
anti-fascist bloc had been formed consisting of the Hasho—
met Hatzair, the Left Labor (Poale) Zionists and the
Jewish division of the (Communist) Polish Workers’ Party
(known as P. P. R., the initials of the name in Polish).

- At an all—party conference in March, “Jewish socialists . . .

refused to merge their groups with those of the socialist-
Zionists.” (Marie Syrkin, op. cit., p. 207.) But the anti-
fascist bloc persevered in the campaign for unity, and from
its eﬁorts there emerged the Jewish National Committee,
which added to the three parties already‘ mentioned the
Labor (Poale) Zionists, the Socialist-Zionists, and demo-
cratic militant elements among the General Zionists. By
October 20, 1942, all-party unity was achieved in a ﬁghting
organization when the Socialist Bund adhered to the
organization. Preparations for the active large-scale military
resistance were carried out under the leadership of five

 

commanders, headed by Mordecai Anilewitz of Hashomer
Hatzair, and including Michael Rosenfeld of the Polish
Workers’ Party (P; P. R.). Other leaders came forward:
Adam Berman, the Labor Zionist, Sonia Novograduka of
the Bund, Henoch Kirschbaum, the Zionist. In the ﬁghting
itself, both on January 18, 1943, when the nazis met armed
resistance for the first time, and in the weeks after April 19,
1943, when the final ghetto battle was joined, mass heroism
was forged. The unity that had already been achieved was
further tempered in the heat of battle and the flames of
the Warsaw ghetto. _

Of the 40,000 who were in the ghetto when the rising
took place, most were annihilated. The nazis lost more than
1000 troops, materials, time and prestige. And it was more
than individual Jews that survived. An example survived,
and spurred on resistance in other ghettoes, in death—camps,
and in other partisan movements. Jewish unity against

‘fascism survived, -and has been since the end of the war the

basis of the all-party unity of the Central Committee of
Polish Jews. The democratic unity of Jews _and non-Jews
survived,“ and is now the basis for the fact that the Jews are
an honored and in some respects, because of their great
losses, a favored part of the new democratic Polish govern-
ment.

For us in the United States, and for Jews and other people
all over the world, there have survived lessons and examples,
patterns of what to do and what not to do in the ﬁght

3Much has been written of the inadequate and grudging aid given the
ghetto ﬁghters by the Polish “untlerground" that had its headquarters
in London and that apparently had other more important objectives than
to ﬁght the nazis. Not enough is yet known in this country of the splendid
aid rendered by the Polish Workers‘ Party, , founded in January and
February. 1942, with headquarters in Lublin. Thus Christina Kovolska.

against reaction and fascism. Some had learned these lessons
even then; many_ have been taught only by hindsight. But
it is necessary to guarantee that the hindsight of today
becomes the foresight of tomorrow. .
Everywhere that there is reaction, fascism and imperial-
ism, resistance is the only lesson. It is still easier to resist,
especially in the United States, than it was in the Warsaw
Ghetto. One must resist the propaganda that nourishes the
“cult of self-preservation” by telling us that the attack is
aimed “only” at the communists, or at “greedy” labor, or
at the foreign-born, or at the Negro people, and not at “us.”
The road to fascism is paved with ‘exceptions that lea_d
nowhere except to the extermination centers. The inﬁnite
cunning of nazism was penetrated only too slowly and at
too great cost in the Warsaw ghetto. The American face
of reaction will have its own special features, but we must
learn soon to penetrate the disguises and read the death—
warrants made out for our names. It will be a deluding

comfort that we shall betaking if we lull ourselves into the

“belief” that the Taft-Hartley road, the Truman loyalty-
decree road, the Hoover reconstruction of a powerful reac-
tionary Germany road, the deportation road, the bi—partisan
road of strengthening reaction in Europe, the Near East
and the Far East, are anything but the roads to fascism,
American style.

In order that it be not desecration, commemoration of the
Warsaw ghetto heroes should mean resistance above all;
resistance immediate, continuous and victorious.
