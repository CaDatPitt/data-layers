in the north? Or a coup d’etat in Germany, engineered by Thyssen
and Schacht from exile—both, incidentally, good friends of Monta-
gue Norman too? Or is the cryptic reference to the American Con-
gress, which will have time to meet and act by the end of January?
Britain has a two months’ plan which requires that the Finns tie
the Russians up that long.”

THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

Two twin facts stand out in the history of Finland and
no propaganda smokescreens can erase them. The first is
that after seven hundred years of Swedish domination and
one hundred years of Tsarist Russian domination, without
even an attempt by the Swedo-Finnish ruling class of Finland
to ﬁght for independence, Finnish independence was ﬁnally
achieved through the Russian Revolution, under the oﬂicial
signatures of Lenin and Stalin. The second is that while
General Mannerheim and the rest of his Swedo-Finnish con-
freres were loyally polishing the boots of Nicholas II, the
ﬁght for Finnish freedom was led by the Social-Democratic
Party of Finland which, until most of its militant members
were butchered by General Mannerheim, was as revolutionary
as the party of Lenin. Thus it was the revolutionary workers
of Finland who fought for Finland’s independence and the
revolutionary workers of Russia which bestowed it on them
in line with the Soviet policy toward nationalities, formulated
by Stalin.

The Swedo-Finns and +he Finns

Today the Swedo-Finnish ruling class of Finland, many
of whom cannot speak a word of Finnish, are posing» as the
champions of the Finnish people against the “Russian in-
vaders.” Yet the unerasable historical record is that even
under Tsarist domination this Swedo-Finnish aristocracy, of
which General Mannerheim is a scion, continued to suppress

the Finnish language and culture. Ethnologically and lin-
8

 

    

guistically, the Finnish people, as distinct from their rulers, are
much closer to certain peoples of Northern Russia and Siberia
(hence the mad claims of Finnish imperialists to Russia “as
far as the Urals”) than to their suddenly acquired “Nordic
cousins.” In the Soviet fraternity of nations, where all races
are absolutely equal and it is no disgrace to belong to a "non-
Aryan” race, the true cousins of the Finns—the Karelians, the
Mordvinians, the Ostiaks, the Kalmucks, the Samoyeds, the
Marii and kindred nations—do not have to hide their linquis-
tic aﬂinity to the Mongolian (Uralo-Altaic) family of Ian-
guages.

Until Finland was conquered by Sweden, and Karelia by
the Russian city-state of Novgorod, the scattered Finnish
tribes roamed those regions without territorial or racial co-
hesion. Christianity came to the pagan Finns as it came to
the pagan Teutons—by the sword. In the end the Eastern
Finns in Karelia became Russiﬁed and Greek Orthodox, while
the Western Finns in what is now Finland became subjects of
Sweden, and Roman Catholics and Lutherans in succession.

Finland continued, to be under Swedish domination from
1154 until its annexation by Tsar Alexander I in 1809. The
local autonomy which Finland enjoyed as a Grand Duchy of
the Swedish crown helped to give Finland a territorial unity.
But culturally and linguistically the Finnish nations was in
the process of being obliterated by the culture and language
of the Swedish ruling class. The Swedish army of occupation
intermarried with the Finns and gradually a Swedish-speaking,
Swedo-Finnish colony was developed in Finland holding itself
contemptuously aloof from the Finnish masses like the Anglo-
Irish colony in old Ireland.

The Finnish Naﬁonal Revival

The Finnish peasants did not always meekly submit to the
yoke of their Swedo-Finnish masters. In 1596 they rose
against their oppressors in a savage Jacquerie known as the

Club War. The revolt was drowned in blood.

It is signiﬁcant comment on bourgeois “patriotism” that
it was this same Swedo-Finnish ruling class which initiated
the movement for the separation of Finland from Sweden and
its annexation by Tsarist Russia. This phenomenon becomes
less anomalous when the class motivation is analyzed. In the
heyday of Swedish monarchical power, Finland enjoyed a
high degree of local autonomy. In effect it meant that the

"Swedo-Finnish ruling class of Finland was free to oppress the

Finnish masses without hindrance from Sweden.

In the eighteenth century when the Swedish Diet began to
wrest power from the Crown, a centralized regime on a class,
rather than on a regional, basis was instituted in the Swedish
kingdom. Concurrently trade was increasing in Finland, par-
ticularly with England, stimulating the growth of a local
bourgeoisie that did not like the competition of the Swedish
bourgeoisie. As a result the Swedo-Finnish ruling class began
to ﬂirt with the idea of an autonomous Finland ‘under the
suzerainty of Tsarist Russia. They looked enviously across the

Gulf of Finland to Russian-occupied Courland and Livonia
' and hoped that they too would be allowed to exploit the Fin-

nish peasantry as ruthlessly as the German Baltic barons were
allowed to exploit the Esthonian and Latvian peasants. _

When in 1809 Napoleon invited Alexander I of Russia to
help himself to Finland in return for aid against Britain, the
Russian army was welcomed by the local Swedo-Finnish
aristocracy. In his book Finland, the historian  Hampdon
Jackson writes:

“When the Russian troops entered Turku, the capital, they were
met with a civic reception. Sweden’s cause in Finland had been
betrayed by the Swedo-Finnish gentry.”

Alexander I was very generous-to the Swedo-Finnish aris-
tocracy. He gave them the “Home Rule” that they were
yearning for, the rule of the 10 per cent Swedo-Finns over the
90 per cent Finns. .

The aim of the Swedo-Finnish ruling class to stamp out the
10

 

Finnish language in Finland was gtubbornly resisted and in
the latter half of the nineteenth century a nationalist Finnish

- revival, like the Neo-Gaelic movement in Ireland, took roots
among the Finnish masses and petty bourgeoisie, ﬂowering in ~

a Finnish literary school. Aid came from an unexpected
quarter. Realizing that a Swedish-speaking Finland might
possibly rejoin Sweden, Alexander II became a patron of the
Finnish revival as a political measure.

At the turn of the century, Nicholas II, under the in-
ﬂuence of the fanatical head of the Russian Church, Pobedo-

nostsev, initiated the only Russian attempt to Russify Finland.

The Finnish Socialist Movement

Meanwhile a new power had arisen on the political horizon

of Finland, the Social-Democratic Party of Finland, which -

grew from a membership of 8,300 in 1902, to a party which
won a clear majority in the Finnish Diet in 1916, the first
Socialist Party in the world to get a parliamentary majority.

This may be explained by the social composition of the
rural population of. Finland which in 1901 comprised 88 per
cent of the total. Only 111,000 families or less than a quarter
of the rural population owned any land at all; the rest were
tenant farmers; torpparits or sharecroppers, and landless agri-
cultural laborers. It was this vast reservoir of rural exploita-
tion which enabled the Socialist Party of a dominantly rural
country to win a majority in the Finnish Diet.

In 1905, when the first great revolutionary wave swept
through Russia, the Swedo-Finnish bourgeoisie remained loyal
to Tsarism. But the Finnish Social-Democratic Party rose to
the occasion and struck a blow for a free Finland, a demo-
cratically-elected Diet and for social reforms. A general strike
was so complete that even the local police went on strike.
All the Socialist demands were granted by the Tsarist govern-
ment. The Social-Democrats won 80 out of the 200 seats
in the first democratic Diet of Finland.

In the counter-revolutionary period which followed upon the
' 1 1

 

 

. 4
1905 revolution, the national, social and political gains of‘

1905 were largely lost in Finland as in the rest of the empire.
But the militant Social-Democratic Party of Finland knew
that their time would come again and organized for the
occasion. In the 1916 Diet the Social-Democrats won 103
out of the 200 seats. '

The Bolshevilt Revoluﬁon Brings Finland
H's Independence

When the Tsarist regime was overthrown in March, 1917,
the Provisional Government grudgingly restored to Finland
the autonomy that the Social-Democratic Party won in 1905.
But both the Lvov and Kerensky Governments refused to grant
complete independence to Finland. The only Russian political
party that was in favor of granting complete independence
to Finland was the Bolshevik Party. Lenin always had a great
admiration for the splendidly organized militant Social-Demo-
cratic Party of Finland, then in control of the Finnish Diet,
and knew that a Socialist Russia would have nothing to fear
from an independent Socialist Finland. While he was still
abroad, in his Letters from Afar, he wrote: “The Finnish
workers are better organizers; they will help us in this and, in
their own way, bringnearer the establishment of a Socialist
Republic.”

In his speech on the National Question he attacked the
stand of the Provisional Government. “We stand for giving
the Finns complete independence. That will insure their confi-
dence in Russian democracy and when they are given the right
to secede they will not do so.”

In Finland, meanwhile, the Finnish Social-Democratic Party,
which had been the sole champion of the Finnish people
against Russian Tsarism, foreseeing the inevitable drift of
Russia to a Socialist Revolution, was now becoming opposed
to a complete separation from Russia. For that very reason

the Swedo-Finnish bourgeoisie, which had enthusiastically
12

 

collaborated with a reactionary Russia in the past, was now
becoming rabidly separatist and anti-Russian.

But separation from a potentially Socialist Russia was only
part of the program of the Finnish bourgeoisie. The more
important part of its program was the organization of a
counter-revolutionary putsc/7 to wrest the local government
from the Social-Democratic majority of the Diet and forcibly
suppress the Finnish Socialist movement and the Finnish
trade unions. In this the Finnish bourgeoisie were only emu-
lating the example of the Kerenskys, Miliukovs, Kornilovs
and Kaledins in Russia.

The Finnish Counter-Revolution

White Guard units sprang up throughout Finland disguised
as "fire brigades” and "athletic societies.” The revolutionary
Finnish Social-Democratic Party of 1917 was not caught nap-
ping. On October 20 the leaders of the Finnish Trade Unions
(solidly Bolshevist) announced:

“As the bourgeoisie is now feverishly arming itself against the
laborers in order to stifle their most important endeavors for reform,
the leaders are of the opinion that in self-defense and to provide
against all contingencies, the laborers should immediately raise corps
of Guards up and down the country.” ~

In 1917 the bourgeois leaders vociferously denied that they
were arming, but in 1923 when they were ﬂushed with success
at having suppressed the remnants of the revolutionary move-
ment of Finland, they boastfully confessed the truth. A pam-
phlet (Finland’s Civil Guards) published in English by the
White Guards declared:

"Happily enough at the end of October and the beginning of
November, 1917, the central organization succeeded in importing
one shipload of riﬂes, cartridges, machine guns and pistols, alto-
gether 6,500 riﬂes, 25 machine guns, 2,500,000 cartridges, 800
pistols and 5,500 hand grenades.”

The boat referred to was the John Grafton commanded by
13

a certain John Smith. The arms that were to be used to
massacre the militant workers of Finland came from the same
country which is now supplying arms to the Finnish fascists
to attack the Soviet Union. Yet Britain was at that time an
ally of Russia in the World War and Russia had not yet
signed a separate peace with Germany.

How bourgeois Finland won its “independence”——from
Socialism rather than from Russia—can best be told in the
words of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Not that the Britannica
tells the whole truth about that most fatefulperiod of Finnish
history, but even the‘ half truths admitted in the Britannica
will be startling revelations to an American public which has
been blinded to the truth about Finland by a smokescreen of
lies in the press and on the radio.

“The Diet resolved that it alone was competent to pass laws in
Finland -relating to home aﬁairs and ﬁnance. This law of July 18,
1917, reflected the standpoint of the Social-Democratic majority
which was ready to recognize Russian supremacy in military and
foreign aﬂairs. The advent of the Bolsheviks to power deepened
the pro-Russian sympathies of the Finnish Social-Democrats while
the Swedo-Finnish and Finnish propertied classes sought to cut
adrift from Russia. On December 6, 1917, the Diet and the now
bourgeois Senate drew up a declaration of independence which is
held to mark the birth of Finnish freedom. The Bolsheviks on
January 4, 1918, declared that this -step conformed to their policy.
. . . The Finnish Social-Democrats, almost all Maximalists (Bolshe-
viks), pinned their faith on the Muscovite connection. . . . A hur-
riedly organized White army under Baron Marmerheim proved
insufficient to maintain order. . . . Sweden ‘ refused to help but
Germany did not hesitate. They sent a division initially 12,000
strong under General Rudiger and General von Golz. The German
victory over the Reds contributed to Mannerheim’s decisive victory
at Viborg April 28, 1918, and by June 27, 1918, 73,915 Red rebels,

including 4,600 women, were prisoners of war. But the cruelty of

"the Red insurrectionists led to a White counter-terror. Some 15,000

men, women and children were slaughtered.”

14

To this thread, supplied by the oﬂicial organ of British
imperialism, one needs only string the following comments:

1. That the only democratically-elected government that
Finland ever had,»in declaring itself independent from Russia,
freely and of its own volition recognized special Russian mili-
tary and diplomatic rights exceeding those which the Soviet
Union is now asking from Finland.

2. That the Finnish so-called War of Independence of
1918 was no struggle with Russia but a civil war started by
the Finnish bourgeoisie, with foreign aid and instigation
against the legal Social-Democratic Government of Finland
for the purpose of crushing the dominant revolutionary So-
cialist Party and trade unions.

3. That Swedish money, arms and “volunteers,” in addi-
tion to German armies, intervened on the side of the White
Guards.

4. That the White-Guard putscb of the bourgeois minority

would have been summarily crushed by the Socialist majority ’

had there been no German intervention.

5. That in the heat of the first imperialist war when the
British, French and German armies were slaughtering each
other by the millions on the Western front, British and Ger-
man imperialism were nevertheless willing to collaborate in
crushing Socialism in Finland—Britain by arming the Finnish
White Guard and Germany by sending an expeditionary force
to aid them.

6. That the Britannica figures of the White holocaust in
Finland are grossly underestimated, the ﬁgures reported in
the contemporary British liberal press being about 50,000
killed in the Civil War and about 30,000 executed in cold
blood, a total of 80,000 victims in a population smaller than
that of Chicago. But even accepting the Britannica ﬁgure of
15,000 executions it would be equivalent proportionately to

150,000 executions in Spain and 400,000 in Germany.

Finland Becomes fhe Firs’r Fascisf Sfafe

With the Social-Democratic majority of the Finnish Diet
either killed, or in exile, the fascist rump Diet called for new
elections in which all the workers and peasants who had re-
sisted the White Guards (the Britannica underestimates it as
46 per cent of the electorate) were officially disfranchised.

This illegally-elected Diet is the parent of the present Fin-
nish Government. One of the ﬁrst acts of this fascist Diet,
presided over by the notorious anti-Soviet plotter Svinhufvud,
was to declare Finland a German protectorate and invite a
brother-in-law of the Kaiser, Prince Friedrich Karl of Hesse,
to become King of Finland. Thus the status of Finland for the
rest of the war was that of a willing ally of Germany; in
other words, an “enemy country” so far as Britain, France and
the United States were concerned, whereas Russia, even after
the Treaty of Brest Litovsk, were merely neutral. Yet a British
apologist has this to say of Finland’s pro-German policy in
1918: “In asking for a German monarch the Whites were
putting Finland under the protection of the Power which was
predominant in the Baltic, and this after all was Finland’s
traditional position.”

Mannerheim's Role in fhe Allied Infervenﬁon

With the victory of the Allies it might normally be ex-
pected that the Finnish fascists would be penalized for having
bet on Germany. But Britain’ readily forgave General Man-
nerheim all his pro-German sins for his meritorious service in
massacring the militant working class of Finland. Besides,
the British had fresh work for General Mannerheirn in his
own line—the crushing of the militant Russian working class
—and needed Finland as a base for their anti-Soviet military
and naval intervention.

The role of the Finnish fascists in the Russian Civil War
and Intervention has confused many historians. The Britan-

nica records:
16

 

“When at the end of May, 1919, a British expeditionary force
under General Maynard reach-ed Lake Onega, General Mannerheim
offered cooperation in return for Petrozavodsk [Soviet Karelia].
The offer being declined, a Finnish volunteer force assaulted the
town nevertheless, but without success. Again, at the end of the-
year, when General Yudenich marched on Petrograd, General Man-s
nerheim sounded out the Allies on Finnish intervention.”

The confusion of bourgeois historians over this period di--
rectly reflects the cross-purposes of anti-Soviet diplomacy dur-.
ing the intervention. The Finnish fascists, as the Britannica:
testiﬁes, were more than willing to oiler their expert services.
to help crush the young Socialist Republic. But they nursed.
imperialist dreams (based on the racial and linguistic aﬂinity
of the Finns to some of the Mongolian peoples of Northern
Russia) of a Greater Finland stretching -to the Urals and’.

including Esthonia via Leningrad. The Poles had similar)

dreams of a Greater Poland stretching across Byelo-Russia and.
the Ukraine to the Black Sea. _
On the other hand the White Russian generals, with whom_

the British were chieﬂy cooperating, dreamed of a strong;

Russian imperialist state, including the whole of the old Rus-.
sian empire with all the States that had been severed from/it

4 restored. In this the White Russian leaders had qualiﬁed’.

support from Britain and France and unqualiﬁed support-
from the United States. As late as 1920, when our Govern-
ment was considering de facto recognition of the Baltic States,
(with the exception of Finland, none of the Baltic States were

at that time recognized by the Allies; only the Soviet Union-

against which they were ﬁghting had given them full recog-
nition) our special representative at Riga said in a dispatch,
to the State Department:

“The leading men here (in the Baltic States) are under no illu-.
sion as to the future relation of these States to Russia, and realize
full well that with an orderly well-established Government in Russia.
the Baltic provinces will again become part of what -will probably-
be a -federated Russia.” ’ ‘ - R ‘ ’ » '

Why {he Finnish Rulers Made Peace
Wi’rh fhe Sovief Union Z .

This prospect of being returned to “an orderly well-
established”—i.e., capitalist—Russian government was the
nightmare that haunted the» dreams of the Finnish fascists
while they were participating in the interventionist campaigns
against the ﬁrst Socialist Republic. It is true that Britain
and the United States were liberally paying them for their
services in the “War to Make the World Safe Against So-
cialism” by generous loans which were disguised subsidies.
(The present Finnish “war debt” to the United States, of
which the American public has heard so much, was one of
these “loans.”) But it was a war in which it might be as dan-
gerous for the Finnish fascists to win as to lose. They knew
that no capitalist Russia would permit itself to be cut olf from
the Baltic or tolerate a frontier twenty miles from Petrograd.

Like his disciple Stalin, Lenin was not at all averse to sign-
ing treaties with states which were the prototypes of fascism,
providing Socialism gained by the transaction. He cleverly
played on the suspicion between the White Guard Finns and
the White Guard Russians and broke the anti-Soviet united
front by inducing Finland to sign a treaty of peace with the
Soviets in the fall of 1920. But the Finnish fascists, knowing
Soviet Russia’s desperate need for peace, compelled Russia
to cede to Finland the Pechango district settled by Russians
from Medieval Novgorod and containing Russia’s only ice-
free port on the Arctic. Finland never.had had any frontage
on the Arctic. This province, which was never part of Fin-
land, as any pre-war map of the Grand Duchy of Finland
shows, gave Finland its present outlet on the Arctic. It also
gave the International Nickel Co. one _of the richest nickel
deposits in the world. The Finnish Government is clamoring
that the cession of a few square miles on the Karelian Isthmus
and the Hangoe and Rybachi Peninsulas would violate its

integrity, but it is silent about the fact that its sacred
18

 

territory includes a whole admittedly Russian province.

The Treatyof Dorpat by which Finland gained the Prov-
ince of Pechango only whetted the appetite of the Finnish
fascists. The following year Finnish “volunteers,” initiating
the technique which Mussolini and Hitler were to imitate in
Spain, invaded Soviet Karelia. The attempted putsc/7 failed
and the volunteers were driven back to Finland. But the
Finnish fascists continued to nurse their pipe dream of a
Greater Finland "stretching to the Urals.”

"Democrafic" Finland

In the post-war years Finland, like Poland, went through
the formality of becoming a “democracy.” But behind the
facade of “democracy,” though Finnish cabinets came and
went, there loomed the ﬁgure of General Mannerheim, as
the figure of General Pilsudski loomed behind all Polish
governments during his lifetime. And General Mannerheim’s
power was not based on the mere prestige of being an "elder
statesman” or the “savior of his country.”

Mannerheim’ s power rested on the Civic Guard.

“This body,” says  I-Iampdon Jackson in his Finland, “was a
survival of the White Guard of 1918 which had been given legal
recognition and a State subsidy under the Republic, on the under-
standing that it would act as a territorial militia to guard the coun-
try against foreign invasion and Communist conspiracy. Its numbers
had grown to no less than 100,000 men and its oﬂicers were in
close touch with those of the regular army.” .

The regular Finnish army numbers only 28,000. It is a
signiﬁcant comment on the fascists’ distrust of the Finnish
masses that, instead of relying on a regular army to defend
its borders and maintain order, the Finnish Government has
to maintain an army of 100,000 storm troopers to guard
against a “Communist conspiracy” in a cduntry with one-
twentieth the population of Germany.

The Finnish “democracy” outlawed the Communist Party’
' 19

  

Social-Democratic Party just as the Hungarian dictator

' Horthy permitted it in White Hungary. When the emascu-

lated Social-Democratic Party developed a Communistic Left
wing calling itself the Finnish Labor Party, which won 27
seats in the elections of 1.922, the Finnish fascists dropped
the mask of “democracy,” suppressed the Labor Party as
Communist and threw its 27 deputies into prison.

The militants changed their name and by 1930 there was
another Left party in the political arena with 23 seats in
the Diet. In 1930 the Finnish fascists acted again, forming
the notorious Lappo movement, an organization of Finnish
l<ulal<s from the district of Lappo, to “force” the Govern-
ment to act against the Communists and trade, unions. The
Government of the anti-Soviet plotter Svinhufvud, which had
itself connived at the Lappo putsc/2, pretending to yield to it,
suppressed the new party and arrested its 23 deputies.

But the Finnish fascists never had any reason for suppress-
ing the regular Social-Democratic Party of Finland that had
developed into a party which would have made the butchered
Finnish Social-Democrats of 1918 turn in their graves. Nor
did the fascists do anything to alleviate the land hunger of
the landless Finnish peasantry and the oppression of the
Finnish proletariat that was the chief “Communist propa-
ganda.”

In 1922 a government in which the Social-Democratic Party
participated (headed by Premier Kallio, now President of
Finland) made a pretense at land reform and “expropriation
of the large estates.” The land laws which it passed, the Lex
Kallio, were a. mockery of the needs of the Finnish peasantry.
“In the case of 500 acres and under there could be no expro-
priation; in estates of 1,250 acres the maximum with which
landlords could be forced to part was 621/2 acres; only in
estates of over 1,2'5_0 acres could expropriation reach the legal
limit of 50 per cent of the uncultivated land.” Expropriation,
be it explained, meant that the landlords were to be liberally

20

from the very beginning, but it permitted the existence of ad

 

paid by the State in Government Bonds bearing 7 per cent
interest; and the peasants were to repay that money to the
State at the rate of 7 per cent per annum of the cost price,
the new cottagers (the landless, houseless farmhands) paying
9 per cent.

On such terms it is obvious that only a small percentage of
the impoverished landless peasantry were able to take advan-
tage of the Lex Kallio. More than half of the Finnish peas-

antry is still landless. This is not a disturbing phenomenon

to the Finnish timber barons, lords of Finland’s largest in-
dustry. It means there is a large class of landless agricultural
laborers who lose their means of subsistence during the winter,
insuring a plentiful supply of cheap labor during the lum-
bering season. And the Finnish trade union movement which
has been crushed by the fascists every time it showed signs of
recovering from the massacre of 1918 (in 1923 and again in
1930) , and has since been further weakened by the reaction-
ary leadership of the present Social-Democratic Party, is in no
position to protect these exploited workers.

A special U.S. Department of Commerce bulletin of No-
vember 30, 1939, declares in part:

“Trade unions, although they have played some part in wage
disputes in Finland, have little inﬂuence in comparison with the
trade unions in the Scandinavian countries and the organized labor
movement is not highly developed.”

And this in a country where a so-called Socialist Party

. is by far the largest political party, with 84 out of the 200

seats in the Diet. The much touted Finnish cooperative is an
organization controlled by the Finnish kulaks, a Finnish edi-_
tion of the Associated Farmers of California.

Preparations for a New Infervenﬁon

But the Finnish fascists had other interests. Until Nazi
Germany took their place, Finland, Poland and Rumania

were regarded as the spearheads of the contemplated Anglo-
21

 

French attack on the Soviet Union that was to have been
launched in 1930. Defense against this attack, delayed by the
world depression, was a factor in rushing the completion of
the First Five-Year Plan.

With the emergence of Nazi Germany and the consequent
threat to Poland and Rumania, the participation of these two
countries in the anti-Soviet drive became less certain. But
never that of Finland. The Finnish "democracy” turned to
NaziGermany like a ﬂower to the sun and never wavered in
its loyalty until the rude shock of the Soviet-German Non-
Aggression Pact. Only the other day The New York Times
editorially reproached Hitler for “betraying his Finnish friend
and protege.”

At a meeting in Rominten, East Prussia, in 1935, plans for
an attack on the Soviet Union were discussed. Goering rep-
resented Germany, General Mannerheim represented Finland,
Prince Radziwell represented Poland and Premier Goemboes
represented Hungary. The London Times (October 15,
1935), said of the meeting that not only air armaments had
been discussed but that naval and military ideas had been
exchanged, and “Finland (whose strategical position for naval
operations is talked of) and even Rumania have been drawn
in. Even Japan is suspected of figuring in these dreams of
the future.” During this period Germany took a hand in
fortifying Finland for an eventual anti-Soviet attack. Fin-
land, all told, has an estimated airdrome space ten times her
own requirements and adapted for use by foreign powers.

So long as the post-war status quo was maintained in the
Baltic, the Soviet Union accepted the precarious position of
Leningrad, its chief sea outlet and military key to all of
Northern Russia. The Soviet Union knew that the East
Baltic countries were economic colonies of British imperialism
—its creatures and its tools. But it‘ was reassured by the
distance that separated British imperialism from its danger-
ous tools. With the re-arming of Germany under the Nazis,

a re-arming fostered by Britain for its own purposes, the situ-
22

 

ation in the Baltic was radically altered so far as the Soviet
Union was concerned. -

The Soviet Union was well aware of the fact that
not only its chief sea outlet but the entire Soviet North,

_ which was connected to Leningrad by the great Baltic-White

Sea Canal, was at the mercy of any great power that con-
trolled the Baltic States. And there was no doubt about which
great power was the preference of these States. The Baltic
States themselves made it brazenly clear. As recently as last
summer, during the negotiations for a proposed Anglo-French-
Soviet Alliance to halt Nazi aggression, The New York
Times was full of the iterations of the Governments of Fin-
land, Latvia and Esthonia about preferring Nazi Germany
to Communist Russia in a crisis, just as the Polish landowners
went down in. history as preferring Nazi conquest to permit-
ting the Red Army to pass through their Ukrainian and
Byelo-Russian estates.

The sudden desire of Finland to fortify the Aland Islands
dominating the northern Baltic was a concrete instance of this
preference which the Soviet Union could not ignore. It was
the Anglo-French refusal during the Anglo-French-Soviet
negotiations to accede to Soviet demands for measures to in-
sure against foreign control of the strategic Baltic States
which helped to convince Soviet diplomacy that Chamberlain’s
anti-Nazi protestations were not genuine and that his real
purpose was still the organization of a four-power pact against
the Soviet Union. Finland now announces that the Aland
Islands, which it had pledged itself not to fortify, in accord
with a League of Nations decision, are already partly fortiﬁed.

Through the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact the at-
tempt to organize an anti-Soviet-London-Berlin alliance was
temporarily thwarted. But the position of the Soviet Union
in the Baltic remained precarious. Leningrad, which with
the surrounding regions is one of the vital Soviet industrial
centers, remained exposed. A successful surprise thrust at
Leningrad through the Finnish Gulf, which was controlled

23

F
E

  
  

up to the very gates of Leningrad by States that had already
served as bases for anti-Soviet adventures, might cut the coun-
try in two. In a period of imperialist war, with powerful
belligerents watchful to take advantage of every changing
situation, the Soviet Union could afford no risks.

A warning of what might happen was given in the escape
of an interned Polish submarine, with the connivanceof the
Esthonian Government. A Soviet ship was sunk and revealed
how easily Soviet shipping could be blocked in the narrow
Gulf of Finland.

Bolﬁng the Door on lnfervenﬁon

Then and there the Soviet Union decided to stabilize ﬁnally
the Baltic situation by declaring what amounts to a Soviet
Monroe Doctrine over the Gulf of Finland and its Baltic
approaches. This called for military, naval and aviation
bases; and just as the United States leased Guantanamo Bay
from the sovereign state of Cuba and the Panama Canal
Zone from the sovereign state of Panama, giving all the
Americas security, so the Soviet Union, for the protection of
the entire East Baltic area, leased bases from Esthonia, Latvia
and Lithuania. But there is this difference. The action of the
Soviet Union has nothing in common with the imperialist
exploitation which American business interests have carried on
behind the cloak of the Monroe Doctrine.

These agreements were peacefully negotiated and accepted
by Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania with satisfaction because
of the economic advantages and the security achieved for
them through these pacts. To complete the process the
U.S.S.R. opened similar negotiations with the Finnish Gov-
ernment.

A peaceful agreement was desired not only by the Soviet
people, but by the Finnish people, and the people of Esthonia,
Latvia and Lithuania who did not wish to see their newly-
achieved security menaced by an Achilles heel in Finland.

But the rulers of Finland, acting as they have done before,
24

 

in alliance with foreign interests against the interests of the
Finnish people, preferred the bloody gamble of war to the
course of peaceful negotiation. They preferred to try to keep
Finland as what the London Times had declared it to be in
1919: “The key to Petrograd; and Petrograd is the key to
Moscow.” ALTER BRODY

F|NLAND'S RULERS

Shortly before the outbreak of the war between Germany
and the Allies an illuminating book, called Tory M. P., ap-
peared in England.

The book analyzed the ﬁnancial connection, the social ties,
the club affiliations and the publicly expressed opinions of a
considerable number of the Tory Members of Parliament,
whose party has openly ruled England since the betrayal of
Ramsay MacDonald. What emerged from this study was a
sort of group portrait of the British ruling class which re-

vealed its fascist face and made understandable its readiness

to sacriﬁce the small European peoples and ﬁnally its own
people to its class imperialist interests.

A similar study of the leaders of the Finnish ruling class
would be of equal value here. We have not the space here
for a detailed analysis, but suﬂicient facts are available con-
cerning leading members of the present rulers of Helsinki to
make their class connections clear, and explain their readiness
to sacrifice the Finnish people to their class interests.

Let us begin with the present premier, Risto Ryti. While
the White Terror in Finland was still at its height in 1919
he became a deputy to the Finnish Diet. In 1921 he was
appointed Finance Minister. In 1923 he became the head of
the Bank of Finland and has remained at its head ever since.

United Press dispatches refer to him as an “international

banker connected with leading banking circles in London
t a 25

 

 

and Wall Street and a friend of Montague Norman, head of
. the Bank of England.” At the London Economic Conference
in 1933 this representative of an “independent power” voted‘
loyally for Britain on every issue. He holds a British honor-
ary title, Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.
The New York Evening Post, December 1, 1939, commented:

 

“The British Crown confers such honors only on foreign royalty
or on prominent individuals who have earned the gratitude of the
British Government for being unusually cooperative. Ryti rat-ed his
title because as Governor of the Bank of Finland he worked hand in
hand with the Bank of England. He kept Finnish currency closely
tied to the pound sterling.”

Former Prime Minister Eljas Erkko is a rich man by in- .
heritance who has added to the family fortunes. He is the i
V owner of one of the biggest Finnish newspapers, The Hel- ;
1 sin/ei Sanomat. In 1918 he was an officer of the White Guard,

‘ the Finnish counterpart of the Storm Troopers, which has
kept Finland in a vigilante atmosphere ever since 1918. Al-
though he has always had a pro-British orientation he had no
‘objections to bringing in German soldiers to help crush the
Socialist Republic established in independent Finland.

V The political party to which he belonged—the Progressive
 Party—has had a liberal wing and a reactionary wing. Erkko

g is one of the leaders of the latter. He has been a close co-
 worker of T. M. Kivimaki, Prime Minister in the pro-fascist
I administration of President Svinhufvud, just as he has been
 a bitter opponent of Holsti, who belonged to the liberal wing

l of his party. Holsti, as the first foreign minister in the Ca-
jander cabinet, won the hatred of Erkko by advocating friend-1
? I lier relations with the Soviet Union and admitting, on a visit .
F to Moscow, that Finland owed its independence to the Bol- ’
sheviks. Erkko forced Holsti’s resignation and became For-
eign Minister in his place. ‘

Vaino Tanner, Ryti’s Foreign Minister, is a Social-Demo-
crat. He has followed the compromising policy that has
26

 

  

disgraced the Social-Democrats everywhere. The Social-Demo-
crats have, from the beginning of Finland’s independence,
been the largest party in the country; but after the Manner-
heim butchery of its predominantly Bolshevist membership
in 1919 they offered no resistance to reaction and have made
compromises with Finnish fascism. During the worst period
of the Lappo (Finnish fascist) drives, Tanner placed the re-
sponsibility for the outrages on the chief victims—the Com-
munists. He defended the inaction of the Finnish Government
during the outrages in these terms: “The Social-Democrats
consider that the Government has no other way out, for who
could expect it to dispatch troops to protect Communist print-
ing plants?” At another time he made the statement that
“The Social-Democrats pursue the same aims as the Lappo
movement.” C

The military head of the Government is General Carl Gus-
tave Mannerheim, to whom the Finnish people gave the name,
“The Butcher.” Member of the old Swedish aris'to<':racy that
still strongly tinges the upper class of Finland, he had a high
position at the court of Tsar Nicholas II, and was one of the
two oﬂicers who escorted the ‘Tsar at his coronation. Follow-
ing the bloody suppression of an uprising in Persia Manner-
heim received recognition as a butcher for imperialism by a
gift of a golden sword from the Tsar. Mannerheim served
the Tsar again in the Russo-Japanese and the World War.
When Finland won its independence and a Socialist govern-
ment was established, Mannerheim headed the White counter-
revolution, and with the help of a German army he destroyed
the young democracy of Finland. A German prince was ap-
pointed king but never reigned, the Allied victory making this
unfeasible. Mannerheim acted as regent, until the “republic”
which he has controlled ever since, in Pilsudski style, was
established in 1919.

Mannerheim cooperated with the Russian White Guard
General Yudenich, who was supported by England, in the

attack upon Petrograd and later organized the attack on
Soviet Karelia and was the central ﬁgure in all anti-Soviet
aggression plans.‘ He won his butcher’s title during the White
Terror in 1918-19, when some 30,000 workers were killed and
90,000 were put in concentration camps. The cruelties he
practised shocked even the capitalist world, which now con-
veniently forgets them. In the Mannerheim blood debauch A
even schoolboys were executed at his orders. ‘

When after ten years the Finnish labor movement revived,"
Mannerheim was behind the organization of the Finnish fas-
cist Lappo movement which by lynching and destruction,
winked at by the Government, again destroyed working class
organizations and newspapers.

These four ﬁgures are a representative sampling. It remains
to be noted that in the reactionary Ryti cabinet the Minister
of Labor is the banker, R. von Fiandt. V 1

STATEMENTS BY LEADING ENGLISHMEN i

GEORGE BERNARD SHAW 1

“No power can tolerate a frontier from which a town such
as Leningrad could be shelled when she knows that the power
on the other side of the frontier, however small and weak it
may be, is being made by a foolish government‘ to act in the
interests of other great powers menacing her security.

“Finland would probably not have refused the Russian
offer had she been acting on her own or in her own interests,
but Russia believes that Finland thinks she has the backing
of America and other W/estern powers.”

Asked, “what conceivable defense can you make for this
Soviet attack on Finland?” Shaw replied without hesitation:
“I think the explanation is perfectly simple. Finland had been

misled by a very foolish government. She should have ac-
28 .

 

cepted Russia’s offer for the readjustment of territory. She
should have been a sensible neighbor.”

He said the Finns obviously believed that they had the
support of the United States or they would not have taken
the stand they did against a nation so much stronger.

“It is not at all a question of Russia, a great power, attempt~
ing to subject Finland, which is a small power,” he said. “It
is a question of Russia seeing to her own security. In Russia’s
view Finland can have no defensible objection to the carrying
out of the exchange of territories for which Russia asked-
unless she is allowing herself to be used by America or another
Western Power. ‘ _

“There can be no possibility of Finland planning any at-
tack on Russia by herself, nor would any of the territories
which Russia asked her to transfer enable her alone to defend
herself effectively against Russia.”—London Daily Mail,
Dec. 2.

VERY REVEREND HEWLETT JOHNSON, DEAN OF CANTERBURY

“It would have been wisdom and kindness on our part if
we had urged. Finland to meet Russia’s desire to remove the
possibility of guns placed only twenty‘ miles away from the
heart of the area which possesses a quarter of her industrial
activities. '

"I deplore the situation which might have been wholly
avoided, together with the war itself, had we not spurned
Russian friendship and thwarted her efforts to make the
League of Nations a success.

“Russia feared with reason a united Western attack. We
through many years desired Germany to be the spearhead of

that attack. Many inﬂuential persons still desire and work"

for it. Russia knows that.”
H. G. WELLS

“There is much to be said for the preventive security meas-
ures being taken by the Soviet Government.”

SIR STAFFORD CRIPPS, M.P.

“In the long run, I am convinced, it is of supreme impor-
tance to the workers all over the world that a strong and
powerful Russia should survive. i

“And I, for‘ one, see no reason for blaming Russia, in a
situation into which she has been driven by the capitalist gov-
ernments' of the world, for taking every step to strengthen
her position.

“But for the German Nazi inﬂuence in Finland and the
anti-Soviet feeling stirred up, it is probable that the exchange
of territory would have been accepted and everyone would
have commented on how sensible it was.

"Now, naturally, all of Russia’s enemies talk about the
sacredness of Finnish democracy, not because they love democ-
racy but because they hate Russia.”

CAPTAIN HARRY GRENFELL, M.P.

“This government [England] has already made secret com-
mitments with Esthonia and Finland for the use of the air-
dromes in those countries for British aircraft operating against

the U.S.S.R. . . . The commitments appear to have been in ‘

existence at least ten years.” —Labour Monthly, June, 1939.

JOSHUA WEDGEWOOD, LABOR M.P.

“Mannerheim crushed in blood the revolt of the Finnish
workers and farmers in 1918 against the dictatorship of the
White Guard Finnish generals, bankers and landlords. . . .

“Nonetheless Mannerheim continues to rule Finland.
Neither from a humanitarian viewpoint nor from considera-
tions of liberty can one regret the changes which will lead to
Mannerheim’s removal.”—London News C bronicle, Decem-
bet 9, 1939.

WORLD-WIDE ATTACK ON THE U.S.S.R.

|NTERVENT|.ON—I9I7-I939

ROM the moment the Soviets took power, the forces of
world imperialism lined up to destroy the first Socialist
Republic. Internal divisions among these forces have pre-
vented a united attack, and the inherent powers of growth
and progress in the Soviet Union have strengthened it con-
tinuously as its opponents have grown weaker. Nevertheless,

Fourteen countries participated in armed intervention to
overthrow the Bolsheviks. Counter-revolutionary generals who
found no support within Soviet Russia were supplied by the
Allies with money, material and munitions. But armed inter-
vention and counter-revolution failed. The people’s will pre-
vailed. So new methods were sought to ﬁght the Soviets.

. The anti-Soviet ring used starvation as one of its weapons.
By blockade they sought to prevent the Soviets from build-
ing a stable state. By setting up a cordon sanitaire in the
Baltic they sought to choke Socialism‘ at home and keep it
from spreading abroad. By the organization of terrorism,
assassination, sabotage, they sought to destroy it from within.
By the wildest forgeries they sought to discredit the Soviet‘
Government and to keep it an outlaw in the society of nations.

to blind the world to Socialist progress and achievements.
Turning their attention to the grooming of other powers

for an anti-Soviet drive, British and French imperialism helped

to re-arm Germany, and by their hypocritical “non-interven-

tion” policy encouraged Berlin, Rome and Tokyo to seize Man-

churia and continue the dismemberment of China; and to

destroy the independence of Ethiopia, Austria, Spain, Czecho-

slovakia, Albania, Memel. They expected their fascist Frank-
enstein to turn then against the Soviet Union and engage it
in a mutually destroying combat.

The Soviei-German Non-Aggression Pac’r
Upsefs Infervenﬁon Plans

Meanwhile, however, the Soviet Union struggled valiantly
for the peace it needed to complete the building of Socialism,
and to save the workers of the world from a new blood bath.
But the forces of peace and progress within the imperialist
nations were themselves too weak and divided to prevail over
their reactionary governments. When _it became clear that
the British and French Governments, under the cover of peace
negotiations, were still working to turn fascist aggression
against the land of Socialism, the U.S.S.R. took the only
possible alternative. It concluded a Non-Aggression Pact
with Germany, smashed the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis, and
shattered the whole structure of anti-Soviet strategy.

Great Britain and France then declared war against Ger-
many. The Soviet leaders knew this was not the war for which
Chamberlain and Daladier had planned. The next phase of
Allied strategy soon became apparent—setting up a new
government in Germany which would carry out the role as-
signed to Hitler, and ﬁnding other nations to act as catspaws.
If all else failed, there remained the possibility of turning their
own guns against the Soviet Union.

By another swift and brilliant stroke, the Soviet Union
moved into Eastern Poland when the Polish Government,
lacking support at home and not receiving the support prom-
ised by Britain, collapsed. This move cut oif I-Iitler’s drive
down through Southeastern Europe. It cut off his approach
to the Soviet Union through the Baltic. It liberated 13,000,-

000 oppressed White Russians, Ukrainians and Jews, and;

extended the area of Socialism and peace.
Following this the Soviet Union secured itself against pos-
34 '

 

  

sibility of invasion through the Baltic by the pacts with
Esthonia, Lithuania and Latvia. A similar pact with Finland
would have brought complete security for the Soviet Union
and for the whole East Baltic region. When Finland re-
fused to grant even the minimum Soviet requirements, it be-
came clear that it was not acting alone and that the forces of
world. imperialism were making a ﬁnal desperate effort to
keep open this last avenue for invasion of the Soviet Union.

The Role of Finland in lnfervenﬁon

It was not “little Finland” with its 3,670,000 inhabitants
that menaced the mighty Socialist country of 183,000,000.
It was and is the combined anti-Soviet forces throughout the
worldfdetermined to destroy the workers’ and farmers’ state,
daily increasing in might and inﬂuence.

To understand this it is helpful to examine the special role
assigned to Finland in the succession -of plots to destroy the
Soviet Union. Particularly illuminating are the volumes issued
by the State Department, Foreign_ Relations, 1918, Russia,
Vols. I and II and Foreign Relations, Russia, I 91 9,’from which
the quotations in the following pages are taken.

These volumes reveal that while never assuming as aggres-
sively hostile an attitude as the British, the United States
tailed along after the British throughout the whole interven-
tion period, permitted the slaughter of hundreds of American
and Russian soldiers in a lawless, undeclared war against the
Government which had the support of the people, while sup-
plying arms, food and materials to the counter-revolutionary
forces, repudiated and defeated by the Russian people.

With regard to Finland, the volumes reveal that American
representatives opposed its independence under'the regime of
the Provisional Government and supported its independence
after the establishment of the Soviet regime in Russia—and
then only after the Finnish reactionaries were in the saddle.

Thus, on July 24, 1917, we ﬁnd North Winship, American

vConsul at Petrograd, reporting to the State Department on

35

 

 

  

the results of what he terms a "mutinous rising” of the Bol-
sheviks on July 16, 17, 18:

"A further evil result of the mutiny lies in the excuse it gave the
Social-Democrtic majority of the Finnish Seirn to pass its law declar-
ing Finland’s independence of Russia in all respects except as to
foreign affairs and the military necessities of war.”

Two months later David R. Francis, last American Am-
bassador to Tsarist Russia, cabled to the Secretary of State
that the situation in Finland was bad. The army and ﬂeet
were refusing to obey the orders of the Government to prevent
sessions of the Diet.

While Ambassador Francis had cabled for and secured
prompt ‘recognition of the Provisional Government, when the
Bolsheviks took power he urged the United States Govern-
ment to take no action that could in any way be construed as
recognition of the new regime. He even interfered openly
in the affairs of the Soviet Government, attempting to incite
the people against it: “A powerful enemy is at your gates.
A desperate foe is sowing the seeds of dissension in your
midst. . . . I appeal to you to be watchful of your true inter-
ests, and I make this appeal on behalf of my Government
and my people. . . .” '

On March 3, 1918, the Soviet Republic was forced to sign
the robber peace of Brest-Litovsk with Germany to save the
Revolution.

Germany, in violation of the terms of the treaty, advanced
against the Soviet Republic, in cooperaton with Finland.
During the next few months reports by American repre-
sentatives to the State Department contained repeated rumors
of an impending German-Finnish advance into Murman Pen-
insula. This caused consternation among the Allies chieﬂy
because their own troops had been stationed there, on the
pretext of protecting the Murmansk Railroad. Reporting these
rumors Ambassador Francis added: "Finland is still covetous-
ly endeavoring to secure more Soviet terri_tory.”

36 i n

 

American Armed Infervenﬁon

June of 1918 found the American Ambassador still wish-
fully prophesying the quick collapse of the Soviet Govern-
ment, striving to make his prophecy come true by supporting
anti-Soviet movements and violently agitating against Ameri-
can recognition of the Soviets.

In July, DeWitt C. Poole, United States Consul in Mos-
cow, telegraphed the Secretary of State in Washington urging
“immediate intervention in Siberia for the purpose of support-
ing the Czechoslovaks and the new Siberian Government.’ ’
The sequel was the dispatch in August of the ill-fated Ameri-
can military expedition of 7,000 men to ‘Siberia. The story of
Siberian intervention has been told fully by General William
S. Graves, its commander, in his Americcfs Siberian Adven-
ture. General Graves himself sought valiantly to carry out the
ostensible purposes of the expedition, which were to help
bring the Czechoslovak deserters from the Austrian army to
the western front, and to protect Allied supplies. Actually he
found himself expected to help the Czechs wage war on the
Bolsheviks, to aid Japan in cutting off the Soviet Far East,
and to be a party to the counter-revolutionary attempts of the
notorious scoundrel, Semionov.

The occupation of Archangel by the Allied forces took
place on August 2. The local Soviet was deposed and the
counter-revolutionary “Supreme Government of the North-
ern Region” headed by Tchaikowsky was set up. Ambassador
Francis had already moved his embassy to Archangel in de-
ﬁance of Soviet requests to come to Moscow.

Ambassador Francis cabled to Secretary of State Lansing:

“New Government claims jurisdiction over six provinces, but free-
dom of action limited exclusively to territory occupied by Allied

forces. . . . British military complain because some Russians sus-
picious of British and French intentions and resent foreign domina-
tion. . . . I think new government should be encouraged and

strengthened in every way possible, as its -overthrow would prolong,

civil dissension and greatly strengthen Bolsheviki and perpetuate"

Soviet Government. . . .”
Later Francis reported that this Government “would not
have succeeded if the Allied forces had not landed, neither

would it survive if Allied troops were taken away. . . .”

On September 4, 4,800 American troops on three transports
arrived at Archangel to help this counter-revolutionary “gov-
ernment” of the North in its attempts to overthrow the So-
viets which came to power by the will of the Russian people.

When the local population rose against the “Supreme
Government of the Northern Region,” the Allied Ambassa-
dors themselves stepped in and brought the deposed ministers
back again. American Consul Cole at Archangel, reporting
on the reception of British General Poole and the Allied
troops, remarked “the working class was conspicuously ab-
sent.” Thereafter Allied troops under the British General
Ironside took part in shooting and imprisoning loyal Soviet
workers. The interventionists supported a local White army
under command of General Miller, which was supposed to
join forces with Kolchak. By October 10 Ambassador Francis
was urging that the Allies take Petrograd and Moscow.

En’rer Mannerheim—and the Germans

In considering the role of Finland during this period, it
must be remembered that after Soviet recognition of the in-
dependence of Finland early in 1918, the Finnish bourgeoisie
sought help both from the Allies and Germans in ﬁghting its
own revolutionary workers, offering Finland as a base for anti-
Sovietattacks. At the end of January the Finnish Bolsheviks
were gaining control, and the British Minister to Sweden tele-
graphed his Government to encourage Sweden to send aid to
the Finnish reactionaries.

By February 7 well-armed White Guards, under command

of General Mannerheim, suddenly appeared all over North-
38 ,

  
  

ern Finland. Shortly after, Ira Nelson Morris, American
‘Minister to Sweden, advocated withholding recognition of
Finnish independence since the Reds were in I-Ielsingfors and
urged sending food to the Northern section where the Whites
were in control. -

On February 19, Ambassador Francis cabled approvingly
of Mannerheim: . '

"The White Guards, comprising. an army of -patriots totalling
about 50,000 well-drilled and disciplined men and under command

of Mannerheim, a Russian-Finnish general distinguished in -the

present’ and in the Russo-Japanese war, who is virtually dictator, is
in absolute control of all Finland north of line Bjorneborg-Tarnmer-
fors-Viborg. . . .”

Meantime, however, the Finnish Whites had entered into
relations with Germany. On March 11, Thornwell Haynes,
American Consul at Helsingfors, cabled:

“According to arrangement with White Guards, Germans are
landing at Hangoe to take I-Ielsingfors and drive Reds from Finland
in order to restore order. German airplanes over I-Ielsingfors.”

The Germans captured Helsingfors for the Whites. Six
days later the British recognized the Finnish Government, put
into power with the bayonets of Britain’ s enemy. Mannerheim,
to hold German support, made this extraordinary statement:

“The Germans’ victorious and mighty army landed in Finland
to help against the infamous Bolsheviks, and to help the friendship
the Finnish people have always had for the noble Kaiser and mighty
German people. . . . I greet the brave German troops and hope
that every Finn will realize the great sacriﬁce of the noble German
people who are helping them in an hour when every man is needed
on the Western front.”

But now the Germans had no further use for Mannerheim,
who went to Stockholm to ‘seek Allied support. Wrote Min-
ister Morris from Sweden to Assistant Secretary of State
Polk, on June 14:_

39

 

   

“General Mannerheim has severed his connections with the Fin-
nish Government. . . . He states that with the German situation
in Finland what it is he does not desire personally to live there.
In future it may be well to bear this in mind should some;opportune
time come in which General Mannerheim could be of service to us.”

A few weeks later, Morris telegraphed again:

“I ‘have had several conferences with General Mannerheim. . . .
Re ardin intervention in Russia he felt that this was the correct
3 g

thing to do. . . .”

Mannerheim and the Allies -

But the path of intervention was not entirely smooth.
Haynes noted in alarm the pro-Bolshevik sentiment among
the Finns, and reported that the withdrawal from production
of 75,000 Red prisoners (the work of that great patriot Man-
nerheim) accentuated famine conditions. In November, how-
ever, he was advocating recognition of Mannerheim as Regent
of a new government.

“Notwithstanding the increasing peril of Bolshevism,” he wrote
on November 12, “Finland under the new regime hopes to be able
to defend itself on the eastern frontier if the United States will
help it. . . . It seems advisable that naval and military forces be
ready to come at the earliest opportunity.”

The war between the Allies and Germany came to an end.
The undeclared war on the Soviets went on. On November
16 Haynes reported:

"According to a decision reach-ed yesterday, the Senate and the
Diet have agreed to entrust General Mannerheim with the forming
of a new government. . . . New general elections are ﬁxed by Feb-
ruary or March, ‘by which time it is hoped that the Entente will -be
able to cope with the Bolshevik danger, which has been hitherto
the principal objection to leaving existing mooted questions to the
decision of the people. . . .”

On November 22, Mr. Polk notiﬁed Haynes that although
40

 

 

the Department was not yet ready to recognize Finland’s in-
dependence, 5,000 tons of food were on their way to Manner-
heim. At that very time Mannerheim was involved with a
certain Trepov in a plot to make Grand Duke Alexander
Mikhailovich Tsar of Russia. Morris, Minister to Sweden,
reported on December 16 to the Secretary of State:

“. . . Through Mannerheim’s mediation Trepov received 500,000
marks in advance from the Finnish treasury and it was planned he
would follow Mannerheim’s troops on entering Petrograd. In com-
pensation Finland was to receive Karelia and would be guaranteed
that Aland would not -be ceded to Sweden. . . .”

On October 12, a month before the armistice, Whiteho»use,
the American Charge in Stockholm, indicated how much
greater was Allied hostility to the Bolsheviks, than to their
enemy Germany:

“It is the opinion of those American, English and French ofﬁcials
with whom I have talked that the departure of the German and
Austrian troops from the Baltic provinces and Ukraine would lead
immediately to disturbances and shortly thereafter to Bolshevik
intervention. In the event of an armistice with the Central Powers
it would seem, therefore, advisable not to insist on the immediate
evacuation of these territories until we are in a position to send
Allied troops. There can be no doubt that the Bolshevik ca-use would
be greatly strengthened by the evacuation of these territories and
the task of restoring Russia correspondingly more diﬂicult. . .”

With the signing of the armistice, the pretext of Allied oc-

cupation of Archangel for the purpose of protecting Allied.

supplies from falling into the hands of the Germans was re-
moved, but the Allied troops continued their undeclared war
on the Soviets. By now, according to Poole, American Chargé
at Archangel, there was “an obligation to the inhabitants of
this region who would be exposed if we withdrew to severe
Bolshevik reprisals . . . and an even more important obligation
to all Russia to protect her from economic exploitation by

creditor nations. . . .”

Mannerheim was consolidating his rule by a terror that was
arousing indignant protest throughout the world. But this did
not deter the Allies from continuing to support him. On
February 20, 1919, Grant Smith, the American Chargé in
Copenhagen, reported:

“In interview with naval attache yesterday Genera-l Mannerheim
stated that his army was willing and capable of defeating the B01-
sheviki in Northern Russia. Mannerheim stated his willingness to
commence hostilities immediately if encouraged to do so by the
Allies and assured that the United States would hasten sending food
supplies to Finland.”

Robert W. Imbrie, American Vice Consul at Viborg, also
urged haste. On March 2 he wrote:

“Have had several conferences with heads of Russian Whites.
They have, with the knowledge and consent of the Finnish Govern-
ment, perfected a military organization numbering 10,000 volun-
teers. The object of this organization is the capture of Petrograd,
and afterward Moscow and the overthrow of the Bolsheviks. . . . If
the United States Government thinks favorably of sending food in
support of the Whites, I cannot too strongly urge necessity of imme-
diate action. . . . Even a month’s delay may be fatal to the project.”

In due time Herbert Hoover came to the aid of Manner-
heim and of the counter-revolutionary General Yudenich.
Foodstuffs stored at Reval and Viborg, sent for the relief of

starving Russian children, went to the army of intervention.

"The Way Lies Through ‘the Finnish Army"
On July 11 Imbrie reported: i

“. . . From the Finnish-Russian border Petrograd was menaced

with an advance and in the opening days of the month a volunteer
Finnish army advancing into Karelia took Olonetz and threatened
Petrograd from the north. . . . Early in May the Russian White
detachment which had originated in Pskov . . . advanced in the

direction of Petrograd ﬁnally stopping at Gatchina, 45 v-ersts south-
west of the city. . . . They were, however, without suﬂicient food
42

 

. . . the force therefore ceased its advance, merely taking steps to
protect its ﬂanks. In this latter operation Krasnaya Gorka, on the
Finnish Gulf, was, with the assistance of the British ﬂeet, captured.
. . . There remains, however, one way, -aside from a campaign by
an international expeditionary force in which the capture of Petro-
grad and the consequent overthrow of the Bolsheviks may be accom-
plished. This ‘way lies through the Finnish army.”

Imbrie outlined the plan:

“. . . The Finnish Government is aware that its political salva-
tion is dependent upon the overthrow of the Bolsheviks before its
own country becomes impregnated with the leprosy of Bolshevism.
It is aware that its -economic salvation is contingent upon the open-
ing up of Russia so that what is now the closed door of Finland may
become the open front door... . . From sources so high that they
may almost be considered oﬂicial, I have been informed that the
Finnish Government only awaits the sanction of the Allied Govern-
ments to launch its attack. '

“An agreement has been reached between the Russian Whites,
under which General Yudenich, representing the Kolchak Govern-
ment, and the Finns are willing to attack. What these terms are, I
have been unable to ascertain, but in all probability they embrace
the granting of an open, ice-free port to Finland in the White Sea
and possibly the cession of the west shore of Lake Onega.

“The Finnish army is quite capable of taking Petrograd and no
time seems as propitious as the present. If the Bolsheviks are not
crushed this summer their strength and prestige will be increased

' not only in Russia but in contiguous countries. Certainly it may be

expected that Finland may very well fall under the disease. . . .

“I trust the Department may not consider it presumptuous on
my part to point out, for I feel it my duty to do so, that the con-
summation of this condition may be effected, as I have indicated,
without the loss of a single American life or the expenditure of a
single American dollar, by giving sanction to the advance of the
Finnish forces and that I may be permitted to urge that such sanc-
tion and approval be communicated by our Government to the Fin-
nish Government.” ‘

I Permission to launch the attack here outlined came from
the American Peace Mission at Versailles. On July 16 a cable
43

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
   
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

from the Mission requested the Allied representative at Hel-
singfors “To inform the Government of General Mannerheim
that in case he thought he ought to follow up the request for
action of Admiral Kolchak, the Allied Governments, without
bringing any pressure on the Finnish Government, would have
no objection to raise against this operation. . . .” '
On August 16 Imbrie reported that the British had loaned
£6,000,000 to the Finnish Government on condition that
the Finns should mobilize for an offensive on Petrograd.
Secretary of State Lansing gave his blessing to the whole
affair in a message to the Charge in Russia, on September 4:

“Regard with deep and sympathetic interest efforts now being
made by . . . elements associated with Admiral Kolchak, and is
hopeful that means will develop by which Russia may be assisted
toward a happy outcome of the efforts of her people to regain
control of their own affairs [sic] .”

Armed lnfervenﬁon Fails

Intervention failed in its counter-revolutionary designs.
Mutinies were spreading among Allied troops. White Gen-
erals were everywhere meeting defeat. The bulk of the Amer-
ican forces were withdrawn from Archangel in July, 1919,
and the British forces withdrew during August and Septem-
ber; but the anti-Soviet intrigues went on.

No longer able to rely upon their own war-weary soldiers
the imperialist powers now had to be content with building
up bases in the Baltic states against the time when a more
active intervention could be resumed, with backing the Polish
attack and supporting the counter-revolutionary remnants

- still to be found within Russia. On January 2, 1920, a con-

ference was held in Helsingfors of representatives of the Fin-
nish, Polish, Lithuanian and Esthonian Governments to con-
sider “their mutual interests.” When the Finnish Minister
in Washington inquired of Breckinridge Long, Assistant Sec-
retary of State, what support could be expected from America,
Long reported his reply:
i 44

\

.  .— .._.,..

  

V... ..M......._.4._.-.

“I told him . . . that he might feel that the Government of the
United States viewed sympathetically any action which the Govern-
ment of Finland might take which would react to strengthening
that government, and which might also act as a barrier against the
spread of Bolshevism.”

The role of England and Finland was analyzed by Lenin
in his speech on December 1, 1920, at the Eighth All-Russian

Congress of Soviets:

“Churchill, who is pursuing a policy similar to that pursued by

Nicholas Romanov, wants to ﬁght and is fighting, and is completely-

ignoring Parliament; he boasted that he would mobilize fourteen
states against Russia—-this was in 1919-—he would take Petrograd
in September and Moscow in December. He was a little too loud
in his boastings. He staked everything on the fact that everywhere
in these small states there is a hatred for Russia, but he forgot that
these small states clearly understand who Yudenich, Kolchak and
Denikin are. There was a time when they were a few weeks removed
from complete victory. During Yudenich’s advance, when he was
not far from Petrograd, the Times, the richest English newspaper,
published a leading article—I myself read this leading article—in
which it begged, ordered and demanded of Finland: Help Yudenich,
the eyes of the whole world are turned upon you, you will save
liberty, civilization and culture throughout the world—march against
the Bolsheviks! This was England speaking to Finland—England
who has the whole of Finland in its pocket, England speaking to
Finland who is up to her neck in debt, who does not even dare to
squeak, because without England she has not enough bread to last
her a week. . . .” (Lenin on Britain, page 186.)

Against the time when intervention could be tried again,
a British military mission, headed by General Kirke of the
British Army Staﬂ’, visited the Helsinki Government in 1924-
25. The purpose of the visit was joint supervision, with Gen-

eral Mannerheim, of the construction of the present "Manner-_

heim line” of fortresses and trenches along the coast of Fin-
land and the Isthmus of Karelia, facing the Soviet Union.

The lnfervenﬁon Conspiracies of I927-I930

In the trial of the leaders of the so-called Industrial Party
in 1930 there came to light details of new Franco-British plans
for armed intervention, originally set for 1928, then post-
poned to 1930 and again postponed to 1931. Here, again,
Finland ﬁgures conspicuously.

The Industrial Party consisted of a small group of intel-
lectuals who had never accepted the Revolution. Because of
their technical training, many had been given important posi-
tions in the State Planning Commission and in various indus-
trial commissariats. Here they organized a counter-revolution-
ary group and attempted to lay the groundwork for a counter-
revolutionary attempt, by widespread sabotage and wrecking
activities. Realizing that the Soviet State could not be de-
stroyed from within, they began, in 1927, to make contacts
with the interventionists, through a group of former Russian
industrialists known as the Torgprom, living in France. By
these gentlemen they were put in touch with the British and
French general staffs and British capitalists, among them rep-
resentatives of Vickers, the munitions manufacturers, and
the oil magnate, Deterding. From these sources, the con-
spirators obtained funds to ﬁnance their wrecking activities
and received instructions for the correlation of their. counter-
revolutionary work with the interventionist plans. They also
acted as espionage agents, transmitting military information.

Ramzin, the leader of the Industrial Party, testified that in
1927 “very active communication set in with the White
emigres as to the organization of intervention and its proxim-
ity, in ‘so far as it was set for 1928.” Ramzin testified further:

“At the audiences which Poincaré granted to the members of the
Torgprom, he expressed complete sympathy with the idea of organ-
izing intervention against the U.S.S.R. and stated that this question
had already been turned over to the French General Staff to be
worked out. . . . Further in this report Denisov [one of the Torg-
prom group] stated that a special’ commission of the French General

46

 

Staff, headed by Colonel Joinville, to organize intervention against
the U.S.S.R., already existed. . . . There were also representatives
from the British General Staff. . . .

“It was pointed out that France herself did not propose to inter-
vene with military forces; at the most she would furnish military
instructors, perhaps the help of the naval and air ﬂeets, and that
the real military forces . . . would be those of Poland, Rumania
and the Baltic border states. Further, hope was given of the use of
White emigrant forces, that is, the Wran_gel army which was
maintained abroad.” A

Ramzin further described the nature of the assistance which
was to come from Britain: “England, apart from some ﬁnan-
cial help, . . . was supposed to lend assistance through its ﬂeet

in the Black Sea and in the Gulf of Finland.”

Planning Provocaﬁons

Methods for working up war sentiments against the Soviet

Union and the provocation of an incident which would pro-_

vide the immediate pretext for hostilities were fully worked
out. Yurovsky, one of the conspirators, testified:

“The immediate grounds for the beginning of military operations,
according to their plans, were to be such circumstances as the agita-
tion of the Communist International—-either in European countries
during some labor movement, or in colonial countries, or some
reference to the inacceptability of the commercial policy of the
U.S.S.R. . . . It was stressed that the Soviet Government must bear
the entire responsibility for everything ascribed _to the Communist
International, and of which the, latter was accused.”

Another witness, Osdachy, threw more light on the role in
which the Anglo-French imperialists had cast Finland.

“Of the border states, Finland was deﬁnitely referred to as a coun-
try aggressively inclined against the Soviet Union and which had
apparently great experience in provoking all kinds of frontier inci-
dents. . . . My impression was that it was mainly in Finland that
provocative action was to be taken, such as would supply a pretext
for intervention.”

47

THE U.S.S. R. AND FINLAND

O N SEPTEMBER 29, 1939, the Soviet Union concluded
a mutual assistance pact with Esthonia which was im-
plemented by the leasing of strategic bases on Esthonian
islands dominating the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga.
Thus in the midst of a dangerous war situation the Soviet
Union moved to preserve peace in the Eastern Baltic and
end long standing menaces to the security of its second largest
city and one of its chief industrial areas.

This pact was followed by similar pacts with Latvia and
Lithuania. In the pact with the latter state, which unlike
the other Baltic states had never participated in anti-Soviet
attacks, the Soviet Union ceded the city and district of Vilno,
ancient Lithuanian capital, seized from Lithuania by Poland.

In addition to the security which these pacts brought to
the three Baltic countries, they gained distinct economic
advantages. Not only was their trade with the Soviet Union
increased at a time when the war had cut their trade with other
countries, but by getting access to the Soviet Baltic-White
Sea Canal and the Soviet Railway to Murmansk, they were
able to reach the Atlantic by a route safe from war hazards.

The remaining sections of the ediﬁce of East Baltic security
remained to be completed by a mutual assistance pact with

' Finland. Occupying the entire northern shore of the Gulf

of Finland, and strategic islands in the center, Finland is in a
position to scuttle any plan for ensuring Soviet security. With
a width of forty-ﬁve miles the Gulf is at once too wide to be
commanded by batteries from the newly-acquired ice-free
Soviet bases on the southern shore and not wide enough for
the Soviet ﬂeet to move from Kronstadt to these new bases

without exposure to submarine attacks and mine ﬁelds. A
3

The interventionist plan included not only the restoration of
capitalism but the dismemberment of the Soviet State among
the participants. Yurovsky testiﬁed:

“On the part of Rumania, the oﬂicial recognition -by the future
Government of Russia of the annexation of Bessarabia by Rumania,
as well as a demand to cede Odessa with certain adjoining territories.
Poland demanded part of the Ukraine on the right bank of the
Dnieper, as well as part of White Russia. Esthonia and Latvia ad-
vanced a demand for such a rectification of the frontier as would
materially increase their respective territories. So far as Finland
was mentioned, there was talk of adding to it a part of Karelia.”

The trials of 1936, 1937 and 1938 revealed what other
tools the imperialists were willing to use. Thus with the
coming to power of Hitler in Germany and a fascist-military
clique in Japan, the job of overthrowing the Socialist State
and restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union was taken over
by these powers, with British .and French connivance.

The trials revealed in full detail how Trotsky and the
Bukharinites became the servants of fascism in preparing for
military intervention. Their long list of crimes had a single
objective: to undermine the defensive power of the country
and open the borders to the invader. The plans for interven-
tion not only contemplated the restoration of capitalism but
the dismemberment of the Soviet Union as well. Japan was
to receive the Soviet Maritime Region; Soviet Byelo-Russia
was to go to the Poles; Germany was to get the Ukraine.
Finland, obviously, would come in for her share of the booty.

The exposure of the conspiracy, and the execution of the
traitors robbed the fascist adventurers of the internal support
upon which they had been reckoning. This together with the
growth of Soviet strength to proportions which, as the Jap-

anese learned, spelled certain defeat for an invader, forced the
fascists to abandon their interventionist plans. Hitler turned

from the Soviet Union to easier pickings.

........‘....Q..... ,. ,

Finland as fhe Safeway of Iniervenﬁon .

That world imperialism today, as in 1919, counts on Fin-
land as its gateway to the Soviet Union, is revealed indis-
putably in the authoritative British bulletin The Week of

December 6, which says:

_‘ “It had been supposed not only in London but in Stockholm and
Helsinki that there was time, at least until spring, in which to
‘prepare the position’ for a lar_ge-scale showdown on the Soviet
proposals to Finland. There is no question that in Scandinavia and
London aslil<e——and apparently ‘in Washington too—information
from agents -has been to the elrect that the Communists would ‘play
it slow,’ would be alarmed at the possible ‘repercussions of world
opinion’ and would therefore be unable to take violent action to
close the Gulf of Finland until spring.

“This ‘preparation for position’ is confirmed particularly in Swe-
den: for it was hoped-—and with some reason—-—that by spring it
would be possible to have secured a government in Sweden which
would be willing to act against the Soviet Union and—more impor-
tant still—it was believed that by then, American aid to Sweden in
military action against the Soviet Union would be secured.

“It is important to note, even twenty-four hours before the Soviet
move, that well-informed Conservative circles in London were offer-
ing even money on the proposition that Sweden and the United
States could be militarily and ﬁnancially aligned against the Soviet
Union’s proposals. And these proposals were of a particularly alarm-
ing nature, inasmuch as their success would profoundly change the
world power position by removing the possibility of a direct threat
by the ‘Capitalist World’ to one of the principal industrial regions
of the ‘Communist World.’ . . .

“There was a moment of acute nervousness when Paasikivi, then
the Finnish delegate to Moscow negotiations, was discovered to be
willing to reach an agreement on Soviet terms. . . . The appoint-
ment of M. Tanner . . . was made with the object of ‘stiffening’
the Finnish delegation and reversing the position reached by Paasikivi.

“That having been accomplished, it was thought a long period of
diplomatic and ﬁnancial pressure  the Russians would set in and
last all winter, the Helsinki Government in the meantime receiving

increasing support from the United States.
49

“The suddenness of the Russian move, therefore, dislocated all
plans—diplomatic and otherwise—-based on this assumption. It also
seems probable that it was responsible for the lack of coordination
in Western propaganda on the matter. For instance, while some
British and American newspapers were freely reporting the ‘massacre
of civilians’ in Helsinki, neither the correspondent of the London
Times, the correspondents of Swiss newspapers nor t-he oﬁicial Fin-
nish radio station in Lahti at that time said anything about the
matter at all, though some of them got into line later.”

The An’ri—Sovie1* Drive Today

Add the mad hysteria being whipped up against the Soviet
Unionall over the world. Add copious evidence from Britain
of efforts to patch up peace with Germany and make common
cause against the Soviet Union. Add the American credits to
Finland—that great humanitarian Herbert I-Ioover’s appeals
for food——the eagerness in all quarters to supply arms and
munitions to the Finns. Add the falsification of the news
from Finland, the war-inciting editorials in all the papers,
and especially the New York Herald Tribune»-—“It is idle to
suppose we can save either Finland or civilization from Stalin-
ism with moral indignation and a few pennies’ worth of
credits.” Add the British pawns in the Ryti Cabinet and
“Butcher” Mannerheim, and the picture is complete.

But the Soviet Union has moved to put an end to inter-
vention forever, to erect indestructible safeguards over the
precious structure of its Socialist State, and to keep un-
harmed in the world the pattern of a new society that has
forever ended human exploitation. ‘

DOCUMENTS or THE CRISIS
SOVIET NOTES TO FINLAND

We publish below two notes issued by the Soviet Government in
the days immediately preceding the crisis with Finland, and referred
to in M olotov’s broadcast of November 29.

The text of the November 26 note of V. M. Molotov to the Fin-
nish Government, protesting border provocations, is as follows:

Mr. Minister, according to a report of the General Staff of the
Red Army today, ’November 26, at 3:45. P.M., our troops, stationed
on the Isthmus of Karelia at the Finnish border near the village of
Manila, were suddenly subjected to artillery fire from Finnish terri-
tory. ~ A '

Altogether seven shots were ﬁred as a result of which three Red
Army men and one junior commander were killed and seven Red
Arm-y men and two commander-s wounded. Soviet troops, having
received strict orders not to give way to provocation, refrained from
opening ﬁre in reply. I M

In informing you of this, the Soviet Government deems it neces-

sary to emphasize that already during recent negotiations with
Messrs. Tanner and Paasiki-vi, the Soviet Government pointed out
the danger created by the concentration of large numbers of Finnish
regular troops at the very frontier near Leningrad.
M At present, in connection with provocative artillery fire from
Finnish territory on Soviet troops, the Soviet Government is con-
strained to place on record that concentration of Finnish troops near
Leningrad not only creates a menace for Leningrad, but in actual
fact, represents a hostile act against the U.S.S.R. and has already led
to attack on Soviet troops and to loss of life.

The Soviet Government does not intend to place undue emphasis
upon this provocative act of attack by Finnish army units, who are
perhaps not under proper "discipline. But it would not wish similar
provocative acts to occur in the «future.

In view of this, the Soviet Government, in registering its deter-
mined protest in connection with this occurrence, proposes to the

51

 

 

  

 

Finnish\Government that it immediately withdraw its troops further
from the frontier on the Isthmus of Karelia, for a distance of 25
kilometers and thus avert the possibility of a repetition of these
provocations.

.

The text of the November 28 note of V. M. Molotov to the
Finnish Government denouncing the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression
Pact is as follows:

Mr. Minister, the reply of the Government of Finland to the note
of the Soviet Government is a document reflecting the profound
hostility of the Government of Finland toward the Soviet Union,
and is calculated to carry to extremes the crisis in the relations -be-
tween the two countries.

1. The denial by the Government of Finland of the outrageous
shelling of Soviet troops by Finnish troops which resulted in victims
cannot be explained except by a desire to lead astray -public opinion,
and cast derision upon the victims of the ﬁring. Only the absence of
a sense of responsibility and a contemptuous attitude toward public
opinion could explain this shocking incident as artillery salvos ﬁred
in the course of “training drills” of Soviet troops very near the
frontier line, before the eyes of Finnish troops. ‘

2. The refusal of the Government of Finland to withdraw the troops
responsible for the villainous shelling of Soviet troops, together with
the demand for the simultaneous withdrawal of Finnish and Soviet
troops, formally proceeding from the principle of equality on both
sides, betray the hostile desire of the Government of Finland to keep
Leningrad under threat. In reality we do not here have equality in
positions of Finnish troops and Soviet troops, but, on the contrary,
an advantageous position for the Finnish troops. Soviet troops
menace no vital centers of Finland, -being removed from these centers
for hundreds of kilometers; while Finnish~troops, stationed 32 kilo«
meters [about 20 miles] from Leningrad—a vital center of the
U.S.S.R. with a population of 3,'500,000——constitute an immediate
threat to it. Properly speaking, there is no room for withdrawal of
Soviet troops since their withdrawal would mean stationing them in
the Leningrad suburbs which is obviously absurd from the viewpoint
of the security of Leningrad. The proposal of the Soviet Govern-
ment regarding the withdrawal of the Finnish troops twenty to
52

 

  

 

twenty-ﬁve kilometers constitutes‘ a minimum; since its purpose is not
to eliminate this inequality in the positions of the Finnish and Soviet
troops but only to reduce it to some extent. If the Government of
Finland declines even this minimum proposal that means that it
intends to keep Leningrad directly menaced by its troops.

3. By concentrating large forces of its regular troops and thus
placing under immediate threat a most important vital center of the
U.S.S.R. the Government of Finland has committed a hostile act
against the U.S.S.R. incompatible with the non-aggression -pact con-
cluded between the two countries. Moreover by refusing to withdraw
its troops at least twenty to twenty-ﬁve kilometers, following the
villainous shelling of Soviet troops by Finnish troops, the Govem-
ment of Finland has shown that it continues to maintain a hostile
attitude toward the U.S.S.R. and does not intend to pay regard to the
provisions of the non-aggression pact, and has decided to keep
Leningrad under threat in the future as well. However the Govern-
ment of the U.S.S.R. cannot reconcile itself to a situation where
only one side would undertake to carry out this pact. In View of this
the Soviet Government deems itself compelled to state that from
this date it considers itself free from obligations undertaken under
the non-aggression -pact concluded between the U.S.S.R. and Fin-
land. Accept, Mr. Minister, assurance of my perfect respect.

MOLOTOV'S BROADCAST TO THE SOVIET PEOPLE

At midnight, November 29, Viczcheslav Molotov, Chairman of the
Council of People’: Commissary of the U .S.S.R. and People’: Com-
missar for Foreign Affairs, broadcast the following speech:

Men and women, citizens of the Soviet Union, the hostile ‘policy
pursued by the present Government of Finland towards our country
compels us to take immediate measures to insure the external se-
curity of our State. L

You know that in the course of the -past two months, the Soviet
Government has patiently conducted negotiations with the Govern-
ment of Finland concerning proposals -which, in the present alarming
international situation, it regarded as the minimum essential for
insuring the security of our country and especially for the security of
Leningrad.

.53 .

   

 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

In these negotiations the Government of Finland adopted an atti-
tude of irreconcilable hostility towards our country: Instead of ﬁnd-
ing ground for agreement in a friendly manner, thepresent rulers of
Finland, to please the foreign imperialists who instigate hostility
towards the Soviet Union, took a different course.

Despite all the concessions we made, the negotiations ended with-
out yielding any result. The consequences of this are now known. In
recent days abominable provocations have been initiated by the
Finnish militarists on the frontier between the Soviet Union and
Finland, including even artillery firing on our troops near Leningrad,
which caused grave losses in the Red Army units.

Attempts of our Government to forestall repetition of these provo-
cations by means of practical proposals addressed to the "Government
of Finland, far from ﬁnding any support, again met with the
hostile policy of the ruling circles of Finland. As you know from
yesterday’s note of the Soviet Government, they replied to our pro-
posals by a hostile refusal and a brazen denial of the facts, by a

I derisive attitude toward the victims we have lost and by Aundisguised

striving to continue to keep Leningrad under the immediate threat of
their troops in the future.

All this has deﬁnitely shown that the present Government of Fin-
land, which became entangled in its anti-Soviet ties with the impe-
rialists, does not wish to maintain normal relations with the Soviet
Union. It continues in its hostile attitude towards our country and
has no wish to pay due regard to the provisions of the non-aggression
pact concluded between our countries. It desires to keep our glorious
Leningrad under military threat. From such a Government and from
its thoughtless military clique, we can now expect only fresh, insolent
provocations.

The Soviet Government was therefore compelled yesterday to
declare that henceforth it_considered itself free from the obligations
undertaken under the non-aggression pact concluded between the
U.S.S.R. and Finland, and violated in an irresponsible manner by
the Government of Finland. In view of the fresh attacks of the Fin-
nish military units on Soviet troops at the Soviet-Finnish frontier,
the Government has now been compelled to adopt new decisions.
The Government can no longer tolerate the present situation, respon-
sibility for which fully rests with the Government of Finland. The
Government of the U.S.S.R. has arrived at the conclusion that it

54

 

  

 

p
A
1
I

can no longer maintain normal relations with the Government of
Finland and has therefore found it necessary immediately to recall
its political and economic representatives from Finland. Along with
this, the Government has given orders to the Chief Command of
the Red Army and Navy to be ready for any surprise and imme-
diately to check possible fresh sallies on the part of the Finnish
military clique.

The hostile foreign press asserts that the measures being taken
by us are aimed at the seizure of Finnish territory or its annexation
to the U.S.S.R. This is malicious slander. The Soviet Government
has had no such intentions. More than that, if Finland herself pur-
sued a friendly policy towards the Soviet Union, the Soviet Gov-
ernment, which always strove for friendly relations with Finland,

. would be ready to meet her half-way in regard to territorial conces-

sions on the part of the U.S.S.R. Under this condition the Soviet
Government would be ready to consider favorably even such a ques-»
tion as the question of re-uniting the Karelian people inhabiting the
main districts of present Soviet Karelia with kindred Finnish people
in a single and independent Finnish State. For this, however, it is

necessary that the Government of Finland should maintain not a '

hostile but a friendly attitude toward the U.S.S.R., which would
correspond to the vital interests of both states.

Others assert that measures carried out by us are aimed against
Finland’s independence, or at interference in her internal and exter-
nal affairs. This is equally malicious slander. Irrespective of -the
regime existing in Finland, we consider her an independent and
sovereign state in her external and internal policies. We ﬁrmly hold
that the Finnish people should itself decide its internal and external
affairs in the manner it deems necessary.

At the -proper time the peoples of the Soviet Union did what
was necessary for the creation of an independent Finland. The peo-
ples of our country are ready also in the future to render the Finnish
people assistance in assuring its free and independent development.

The Soviet Union has equally no intention of prejudicing to any
extent the interests of other states in Finland. Questions of the rela-
tions between Finland and other states are the ‘exclusive concern of
Finland herself, and the Soviet Union does not consider itself entitled
to interfere in this matter. The only purpose of our measures is to
insure the security of the Soviet Union and especially of Leningrad

with its population of 3,500,000. In the present international atmos-
phere, heated by war, we cannot make the.solution of this vital and
urgent state problem dependent on the ill-will of the present Fin-
nish rulers.

This problem will have to be solved by the elforts of the Soviet
Union itself in friendly cooperation with the Finnish people. We
have no doubt that a favorable solution of the problem of insuring
the security of Leningrad will provide the foundation for an inde-

structible friendship between the U.S.S.R. and Finland.

DECLARATION OF PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT OF FINLAND

Following is the text, as published by Tass, oﬁicial Russian News
Agency, of the declaration issued , December 1 by the People’: Gov-
ernment of the Democratic Republic of Finland (received in M as-
cow by radio and translated from Finnish).

By the will of the people, indignant at the criminal policy of the
contemptible Government of Cajander, Erl<l<o and Tanner, a new
government of our country--the People’s Provisional Government-
was formed today in Eastern Finland. F

This Government hereby calls the entire Finnish people to a deter-
mined struggle for the overthrow of the tyranny of hangmen and
war provocateurs. The reactionary, avid plutocracy which in 1918,
aided by the troops of foreign imperialists, drowned the democratic
freedom of the Finnish toiling people in a sea of blood, transformed
our country into a White-Guard hell for toilers.

Having sold the interests of the country’s independence, the pluto-
cratic rulers of Finland, jointly with all kinds of imperialist enemies
of the Finnish and Soviet peoples, ceaselessly hatched plans of anti-
Soviet war provocations and finally plunged our country into the
furnace of war against the Socialist Soviet Union—--the great friend
of the Finnish people. ‘

In this critical situation wide masses of the Finnish toiling people,
who always desired and desire to live in peace with the peoples of
the country of the Soviets, consider it their elementary right and
their sacred duty to take the fate of the fatherland into their own
reliable hands. .

The people have already risen in various parts of -the country and
proclaimed the formation of a Democratic People’s Republic. Part

55

 

I
l

of the soldiers of Finland’s army already have sided with the new
Government, backed by the people.

The Soviet Union, which never threatened or disturbed Finland,
which always respected her independence and for some twenty years
tolerated vile war provocations on the part of adventurist rulers of
White Finland, has now been confronted with the necessity of put-
ting an end to these threats to its independence, by the forces of
the Red Army. _ V

This aim also fully corresponds with the vital interests of our
people. That is why the masses of the people of Finland meet and
welcome the valiant and invincible Red Army with tremendous en-
thusiasm, being aware that it is marching to Finland not as a con-
queror ‘but as a friend and liberator of our people. ‘

The People’s Government of Finland, being deeply convinced that
the Soviet Union pursues no aims directed against the independence

of our country, fully approves and supports actions by the Red Army .

on the territory of Finland. It regards them as invaluable assistance
to the Finnish people on the part of the Soviet Union for the pur-
pose of eliminating as soon as possible by joint efforts the most
dangerous seat of war created in Finland by the criminal govern-
ment of war provocateurs.

To accomplish this task as early as possible, the People’s Gov-
ernment of Finland invites the Government of the U.S.S.R. to
render the Democratic Republic of Finland all necessary assistance
by the Red Army forces.

For participation in a joint struggle, hand in hand with the heroic
Red Army of the U.S.S.R., the People’s Government of Finland
already has formed the First Finnish Army Corps, which in the
course of forthcoming battles will receive reinforcements by volun-
teers coming from revolutionary workers and.farmers and must be-
come the strong backbone of the future People’s Army of Finland.
To the First Finnish Army Corps is accorded the honor of bringing

the banner of Finland’s Democratic Republic into the capital and

hoisting it on the roof of the Presidential Palace to the joy of the
working people and to the awe of the enemies of the people.
Our State must be a democratic republic serving the interests of

the people, unlike the plutocratic republic of Cajander and Erl<l<o, ‘A

serving the interests of the capitalists and landlords.
However, our State is not a State ofthe Soviet type because the

'57

  

 

 

  

glance at the map will also show how Kronstadt, the fortress
covering Leningrad, is exposed to attack from the islands in
the eastern end of the Gulf. (See page 32.)

Thus, in the Gulf, Finland was in a position to nullify the
beneﬁts secured by the mutual assistance pacts signed with
the other three Baltic states. On the land borders Finland
was similarly emplaced to threaten the security of Leningrad.
Only a small strip of land on the Karelian Isthmus, well
within range of Finnish batteries, separated Leningrad from
the Finnish border troops.

During the Civil War _and intervention (1917-1920) this
constant threat from Finland prompted the Soviets to move
the capital from Petrograd to safer Moscow. But with its
huge population and its vital industries Leningrad, even with-
out a capital status, is too important to face such risks. As our
own diplomatic representative in Riga noted in 1920, any
Russian state, whatever its form of government, would sooner
or later have to rectify this situation. (See page 17.) And no
other major power would have tolerated it as long as the
Soviet Union did. The outbreak of the second World War,
and the efforts to turn it against the U.S.S.R., gave the prob-
lem of the defense of this vulnerable approach to Leningrad
a new urgency.

Negoﬁaﬁons Wifh Finland

On October 7, 1939, in the spirit of the non-aggression pact
which it had signed with Finland, the Soviet Union invited
the Finnish Government to discuss a peaceful solution of these
problems. The answer of the Finnish Government was to
mobilize first and send a delegation afterwards. Such a gen-
eral mobilization, always construed as an act of war, was a
ﬂagrant breach of the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact.
It was in this spirit that the Finnish Government conducted
the negotiations throughout. The Soviet attitude, on the other
hand, was patient and conciliatory. The Soviet Government

waived its request for a mutual assistance pact such as had
4

 

  

 
  

Soviet regime cannot be established by the eiforts of the government
alone without the consent of the whole people, in particular the
farmers. In conformity with the above, our government is a People’s
Government of the Democratic Republic of Finland. It will rely
for support on the broad people’s front of toilers.

The People’s Government in its present composition regards itself
as a provisional government. Immediately upon its arrival in Hel-
sinki, capital of the country, it will be reorganized and its compo-
sition enlarged by the inclusion of representatives from various par-
ties and groups participating in the people’s front of toilers. The
ﬁnal composition of the people’s government, its powers and actions,
are to be sanctioned by a Diet elected on the basis of universal,
equal and direct suifrage, with the secret ballot.

The People’s Government’ of Finland regards as its primary task
the overthrow of the government of the Finnish White Guards, the
rout of its armed forces, the conclusion of peace and the ensuring
of independence and security to Finland by means of the establish-
ment of lasting and friendly relations with the Soviet Union.

The People’s Government of Finland addresses to the Government
of the U.S.S.R. a proposal to conclude a pact of mutual assistance
between Finland and the Soviet Union and to comply with the age-
old national hope of the Finnish people for a reunion with the
Karelian -people with it in a single and independent State of Fin-
land. The People’s Government of Finland has every ground to hope
that its ﬁrm course of establishing friendly relations with the Soviet
Union will enable the Government of the U.S.S.R. to comply with
this proposal. V

The People’ s Government desires to maintain friendly relations
also with other States: It recognizes the economic and ﬁnancial obli-
gations of Finland toward other States insofar as these obligations
do not contradict Finland’s sovereignty and in so far as any of these
States will not take hostile steps against the Democratic Republic of
Finland and its People’s Government.

In its internal policy the People’s Government sets itself the fol-
lowing tasks:

1

Creation of the People’s Army of Finland.
58

 

 

 

11

The institution of State control over large private banks and

large industrial enterprises and the realization of measures assisting
medium and small enterprises.

m
The realization of measures for the complete elimination of un-
employment. ,

IV .

Reduction of the working day to eight hours, provision for a

two weeks’ summer vacation for workers, and reduction of house
rents for workers and employees.

v

Conﬁscation of lands belonging tobig landowners, without touch-

ing the lands and properties of farmers, and transfer of the con-

ﬁscated land to farmers having no land or possessing small allot-
ments.

VI
-Exemption of farmers from the payment of tax arrears.

VII
State assistance in every form for-the improvement of economies
for the poor farmers, in the first place by allotting to them addi-
tional land, pastures and when possible also- forests for their
domestic needs, from lands conﬁscated from large landowners.

vm
Democratization of State organization, administration and courts.

IX

Increase of State subsidies for cultural needs and reorganization
of schools, to insure the possibility of attendance at schools to
children of workers and other “needy people; also provisions of every
form for the development of public education, science, literature
and the arts in a progressive spirit.

It turns out that the plutocratic government of Cajander and

Erl<l<o was hated by the people, a government which did its utmost
59

   

 

to ruin our country, resigned to having lost all the support of the
people. This hated government was replaced by Tanner’s Govern-
ment, but Tanner is an enemy of our people like Cajander. Tanner’s

« Government is not a single jot better, if not worse, than Cajander’s

Government.

Chase these hangmen as far as possible from Finland; throw off
this entire bankrupted Government gang!

Arise, long-suffering, toiling people of Finland! Rise to the coura-
geous ﬁght against the tyranny of your oppressors and hangmenl
Arise, all citizens to whom the future of our country is dearl, Let

- us throw off the black load of reaction from the shoulders of our

people! Let us clear the road for the progress, welfare and culture

of the people, for the realization of the age-old national aspirations §

of our people! May the cause of the workers, peasants and working
intelligentsia of Finland triumph!

Under the banner of a free and independent democratic republic
of Finland, onward to victories!

NOTES ON MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT

The available biographical data on members of the new Finnish
People’s Government, established in Terioki, shows them to -be men
and women who have worked devotedly at the risk of livelihood
and life, in the interests of the Finnish working class.

Its Premier and Foreign Minister, Otto W. Kuusinen, became
active in the Finnish Social-Democratic Party after the Revolution
of 1905, and at various periods was a member of its Central Com-
mittee. After the October Revolution he was active in the Left

60

wing of the Social-Democratic movement in Finland and later be-
came one of the founders of the Finnish Communist Party. In the
Finnish revolution of 1918, Kuusinen was the People’s Commis-
sar of Education.

Armas Ejkija, Minister of Agriculture, was an active member of
the Young Socialist movement in Finland after the Civil War and
has won prominence in working class activities.

Inkori Lehtinen, Minister of Education, is not only herself a
veteran working class leader, but is a daughter of  K. and Sandra
Lehtinen, well-known leaders in the Finnish working class movement
before the Civil War.

Mauritz Rosenberg, assistant-chairman and Minister of Finance,
was a /locomotive engineer on the Finnish State Railway until 1918
when he was expelled for his political aﬂiliations. Continuing his ac-
tivities in the Left wing of the Finnish Socialist movement after the
Civil War he was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment in 1922. He
was arrested again in 1930, during the fascist Lappo movement, and
was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment at hard labor. He -escaped
after five years and reached the Soviet Union.

TEXT pI= TREATY OF MUTUAL ASSISTANCE AND FRIEND-
SHIP BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND THE
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF FINLAND F

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. on the
one side and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Fin-
land on the other, being convinced that now, when the most danger-
ous seat of war, which had been created near the borders of the
Soviet Union by the former plutocratic power in Finland to please
the imperialist powers, is being eliminated through the heroic struggle
of the Finnish people and through the efforts of the Red Army of
the U.S.S.R., and -when the Finnish people has formed its demo-
cratic republic, the time has come to establish lasting friendly rela-
tions between our countries and ensure by joint efforts the security
and inviolability of our'States; recognizing that the time -has come
for the realization of the age-old aspirations of the Finnish people
for reunion of the Karelian people with its kindred, the Finnish
people, in a single state of Finland, and also with a view to favorable

61

  

and mutual settlement of frontier problems, especially ensuring the
security of Leningrad and the southern coast of Finland; aiming to
strengthen the spirit and fundamental principles of the peace treaty
of October 23, 1920, based on the mutual recognition of State inde-
pendence and ‘non-intervention in the internal affairs of the other
party; found it necessary to conclude the following treaty of mutual
assistance and friendship -between the Soviet Union and the Demo-

cratic Republic of Finland, and appointed for this purpose their

authorized representatives: Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the
U.S.S.R.—-Viacheslav Molotov, ‘Chairman of the Council of Peo-
ple’s Commissars and People’s Commissar of Foreign Affairs of the
U.S.S.R.; for the People’s Government of Finland—Otto Kuusinen,

to the Democratic Republic of Finland the districts of Soviet
Karelia with a predominating Karelian population—amounting alto-
gether to 70,000 square l<ilometers—which territory will be included
into the State territory of the Democratic Republic of Finland.

The frontier line between the U.S.S.R. and the Democratic Re-

NEW YORK. N. Y.

been concluded with the other Baltic States. For every con-
cession it requested, it offered more than balancing territorial
concessions elsewhere. It pared down its terms to the abso-
lute minimum required for the security of Leningrad, of Mur-
mansk and the Baltic-White Sea Cana1—its own Panama
Canal in the North, through which it has access for its ﬂeets
and its commerce to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, and
which is the main artery of the new world, being created in
the North by socialist enterprise and industry.

The negotiations were ‘protracted for a month, with the
Finnish delegation conﬁning itself to saying “no” while the
Soviets made all the concessions. Since all the vital demands
of the Soviets were rejected, the negotiations broke down.
Making the ambiguous statement that “circumstances” would
dictate which country would reopen negotiations, the Finnish
delegation went home.

The implications of this statement and of the Finnish at-
titude throughout were not lost upon the Soviet Government.
General Mannerheim had been unable to crush the revolu-
tionary masses of his own little country without German
bayonets—a whole German army corps. It was not likely that

i the delegates were speaking with only their own military

resources in view. It was clear that oifstage there were
prompters—powerful forces with aims and motives of their
own. And it was because of the presence of these very forces
that the Soviet Union was determined to protect its security
once for all. Two things were made clear by the Finnish
drawing-out of the negotiations—the presence of that very
danger, and the fact that there was a play for time; that gave
notice that time was limited and that a decision must be made.

Caiander Takes the Oiifensive

Finland not onlyretained its unfriendly intransigeance but
had the eilrontery to attack the Soviet mutual assistance pacts
with the other Baltic States. ‘In a public address, former

Premier Cajander, to use The New York Times’ characteriza-
5

 

 

tion of his remarks, “expressed the deepest sympathy for
Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania—‘three prosperous states
which, after being independent nations, have suddenly become
more or less dependent on Soviet Russia. Finland feels espe-
cially concerned for the fate of her dear sister nation Es-

thonia.’ ”
Any politically-minded person reading this speech was

' prepared for startling developments. At the very time that the

Finnish Government was proclaiming its willingness to make
peace with its powerful neighbor it was making suspicious
overtures to Esthonia with whom it had long ago suggested
union, taking in the Leningrad area as the point of fusion.
It was this that precipitated the storm of protest in the Soviet
press, that our press pretended to find so inexplicable. But the
Soviet Union knew what another Finnish premier had said
regarding itself and its “dear sister nation Esthonia.”

What the Cajander speech meant—whether it was to be
taken as the outburst of a diplomatic pyromaniac or as the
first evidence that Cajander had the backing of other nations
in his incendiary intervention in the good relations established
between the Soviet Union and the other smaller Baltic states-
was soon made clear. _

Two days after these verbal ﬁreworks of Premier Cajander,
there was artillery fire which resulted in thirteen casualties of
Red Army men in the suburbs of Leningrad. Then it was
made clear what Cajander’s apparently mad statement meant.
The class interests of the Sweclo-Finnish ruling class were be-
ing placed above the life and liberty of the Finnish people.
This ruling class which had been selling Finland back and
forth throughout its history, from Sweden to Tsarist Russia,
from Tsarist Russia to Hohenzollern Germany, from Hohen-
zollern Germany to Britain, from Britain to Nazi Germany
and now back to Britain—was willing to drag Finland into

war rather than to loosen, even alittle, its exploiting grip on

the Finnish masses.
6Since then, the sudden olfers of English aid, and the aid

 

of other nations, aid that was conspicuously withheld from
Poland, is a signiﬁcant revelation of the sinister situation
against which the Soviet Union has had to act.

When the Soviet Government, exasperated by Finnish
provocations, severed diplomatic relations, the Cajander Gov-
ernment went out of oflice. It was hoped then that the new
Government would be one with which the Soviet Government
could entertain new negotiations for a peaceable and com-
plete settlement of the issues between the two Governments.
It appeared, however, that the rulers of Finland had turned
out the Cajander Government for fear that it would come to
a peaceful’ settlement after all. The change in Government
turned out to be a further provocation. The new Ryti Gov-
ernment was a mobilization of known anti-Soviet politicians.

The Soviet Government then had no recourse but to turn
from that Government and open negotiations with the Finnish
People’s Government established in Terioki. In its declara-
tion to the Finnish people the Terioki Government scored
the readiness of the Finnish bourgeoisie to serve as a tool of
the “imperialist enemies of the Finnish and Soviet peoples.”
It condemned the rulers of Finland for having plunged -the
fatherland into war with “the great friend of the Finnish
people,” the Soviet Union. In the critical situation it pro-
claimed it to be the right and duty of the masses of the

Finnish toiling people to take the fate of the fatherland into .

their own hands. Their first act was to make a complete
and mutually advantageous settlement of all outstanding
issues between Finland and the Soviet Union.

The Helsinki Government in the meanwhile has shown its
dependence upon foreign support. As the December 1, 1939,
release of the McClure Syndicate points out:

, “An ominous phrase ‘two months’ echoes through Finnish dis-
patches. Finland cannot hold out forever against Russia, but be-
lieves she can hold out ‘two months.’ This, it seems, is her function.
What does Britain expect in two months? Possibly a consolidation
of the Balkans through Turl<ey’s good oﬂices, while Moscow is busy
