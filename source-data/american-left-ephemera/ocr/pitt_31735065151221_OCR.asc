GREAT. FALLS, Mont.—A closer work-
among labor, farm and wom-
§ groups in ontana to stop the dangerous
 toward depression was assured at a

K. .

I  sibatewide meeting here April 3.‘

Held at the Montana Farmers Union ‘
~ Building in Great Falls, the meeting was

attended by principal officers and leaders of
-1 major labor and farm groups in the state.
epresenting Mine-Mill were James Curtin of
tte Miners Union No. 1 and Int’l reps. Dar.-

    

iwrn Bayliff and Harlow Wildman. r

T Richard Shipman, president of the Mon- I
tana MVA Association, presided. Other organ-

zations represented by top state ‘officials
were the Montana Farmers Union, Montana
REA Co-op Association, Montanalstate Feder-
ation of , Labor, the Railroad Brotherhoods
and Montana Women.‘
41/ Considerable discussion by the delegates
disclosed a wide concern over growing unem-
ployment and ruinously low farm prices as

V major signs of developing depression. Speaker

after speaker ‘stressed the importance of

- public power projects to provide thousands of
_'jobs immediately, to stimulate production in

the non-ferrous metals industry and to bring

. i Z in more industry as, power becomes available.

It was the unanimous opinion of the meet-

‘Montana M.M   locals I take Pa rt in states
  political action group‘    

lng that political action must be vigorously
pushed by all groups worki_ng together this
year to elect a U. S. Senator, two Congress-
men and legislators who are favor.able . to the

I needs and views of farmers, labor and women.

The delegates condemned the ruinous poli-

cies now being pursued by the Eisenhower

administration in its attack on public power,
and agreed that instead of fostering a whole-
some and expanding prosperity the admini-
stration has inaugurated a vast give-away

'. program for the benefit of big business and
monopoly. - '

Calling for ‘a closer working relationship

. among mutually interested groups, the meet-‘

ingele-cted a temporary coordinating commit-
tee part of whose responsibility it_ will be to
call a general state-wide meeting during. the
latter part of May. At the May meeting a

program of action will be drafted and ma-'

chinery set up to coordinate political. action

among all interested organizations. -
Members of the temporary coordinating

committee are James Curtin, of Mine-Mill;

Don Chapman, president Montana Farmers.

for united action by all (unions _in the

I area in a common bargaining fight

against the potash companies is being

—stressed here by Mine-Mill Carlsbad‘

Potash Workers Local 415. \
The great neéd for such bargaining
~unity became glaringly clear recently

I i when the companies tipped their hands

/'

in letters to the Union regarding com-
'ing negotiations; \ 7 _
The potash companies are proposing

“wage cuts!

In answer to notices from Local 415
to the companies opening the contracts
for ‘ ‘negotiations with International

Minerals & Chemical, Potash Company or

of - America and Duval Sulphur &
Potash,’ each of the companies sug-
gested that “costs” be reduced and that
all economic matters be reopened. The
economic matters on which the ‘com-

’. panies indicate they wantto cut “costs,’?
' of course, are wages, shift premiums,

paid holidays, _,yacations, etc.
. Thisris the first time in the history

‘ J‘ of the. Union in the potash basin that

 

 

the companies haveproposecl wage cuts.

The proposed cuts come at at time
when potash company earnings con-
tinue at record levels in contrast to
declining living standards of workers

1.  ‘_ under rising living costs. _
An editorial in Potash Dust, Local A

415 newspaper, called attention to the

companies’ proposal as it affects all

 unions in the basin, and declared that-
 this year workers in the potash mines,

as everywhere else, have to have wage

4 increases, not wage cuts.

 “The men in the various unions have

come to the conclusion there must be.

i_unity_.among the workers if a wage in-

crease is.~to be gained,” the editorial~

states? “These workers realize through
unitjfythere is strength,‘ and that our
c"oi_nm_onf problems are the _ same re.
rdless ._off;,our union. affiliation.” - "I

 

 
  

A Instead of company-proposed wage
and fringe cuts, the Mine-Mill potash
local is demanding a substantial “wage
increase, a seventh paid holiday, in-
creased vacation benefits, a 30-hour
work week instead of the present 40-
-hour week, increased shift premiums,
adjustment increases on ‘a numberiof

job classifications, improved pension’

plan and other improvements in the
contracts.

.'5""

sentatives were Bernard Redd,
president, and Pete Thompson,

. vice president of Local 625 and

Herman Clott, Washington rep. '

At issue was the recent_.,deci-
sion by the Maryland State ‘un-
employment; board ruling that"

workers laid_ off, with vacation i

pay coming at the time of lay-off,

i . could, not ‘file for "unemployment

benefits until the vacation ‘pay

period expired; which included‘

.the time paid” by the company

joint bargaining action  

for the vacation.

Mine-Mill’s ‘representatives
were invited to the meeting be-.
cause they had in their possession

. a decision by a previous Admini-
l stration of the unemployment

board,’ which in effect ruled just
the reverse. In 1953,. Mine-Mill

received a" decision which stated
.that vacation pay was excluded
. from consideration at the-time of

lay-off, and that unemployment

‘benefits could begin immediately

iDenvelr hospital offers  
free tuberculosis care

DEN V.ER—Free, unlimited hospitalization and treatment for

tuberculosis and chest diseases are available to members of Mine—Mill

and their families at the National Jewish Hospital in Denver, the
‘world's .foremost tuberculosis medical center.‘ The free hospitalization

.. and .tr.eatment, includes surgery if necessary.‘

The famous institution is non—sectarian. For 55 years it has been

‘i a haven of health, and hope for thousandsof workers, their wives and

children, regardless of race, creed or color. It operates under the
code, that “‘none may enter who can pay, none can pay who enter.” a

Admission is based bn only two factors: does the applicant have 

tuberculosis and can ‘he behelped; is he unable to pay for private care?

medically ‘eligible applicationtis spon-

. sored by a trade union. Patients are
eligible for admission and treatment

regardless of where they live.

FACILITIES of the hospital are
housed in fourteen buildings,_ one of

I , the most important of which is a re-

search laboratory- and out of which
have come many new!‘ developments for
care and treatment of tuberculosis and
diseases of the chest. Included in the
hospital’s program are medical, surgi-
cal, nursing, nutnitional, occupational
therapy, vocational ‘ guidance, psychi-
atric social work, and psychiatric and
psychological services.

[ 7 Men and women of all ages and in
‘ every stage of their diseases are elig-'

ible, provided there is -reasonable pros-
pect of improvement with treatment.
Separate pediatric services are also

available for infants and childrenwith A

-tuberculosis of all forms as well as non-
-tuberculosis pulmonary disease.

The hospital imposes no "time limit,
and patients may stay as long as they
can benefit from the hospital’s facili-

_ ties. ' .

«The childrenb department provides

complete schooling facilities from nurs-
_‘ery classes through high school, under
accredited teachers..

‘ . INSTEAD of invalids“ confined to

I bed, as in theold-fashioned sanitoria,

the Hospital is a beehiveof active peo-
ple, and the thoroughness and success
of its rehabilitation of patients is wide-

ly acclaimed. This activity is ‘part of 4

a new concept of tuberculosis therapy
which stresses getting the patient out
of bed in" the shortestipossible time
after. admission, through the extensive
use of the “wonder drugs,” Isoniazid
and -Streptomycin, and gradually in-

«creasing activities until ‘he or she
reaches, a daily tolerance of 4 hours.

SUDBURY, ‘Ont.—-A strong case for,
the unemployed was presented before .

the Sudbury City Council here April 1
by Mine-Mill Int’l Vice President Nels
Thibault. A ~

Thibault’s appearance 1). e f o r e the ,

Council was backed, by a delegation of
more than 100 people. He quoted hard
facts and made a series of proposals to
alleviate the grim unemployment sit-
uation in the area. ~

Pointing to fast growing unemploy-

_ment in Sudbury and across Canada,

Thibault denied the theory that it is

merely seasonal. He‘ made the follow- '

ing ‘points: unemployment in the dis-

’ trial: had grown by more than a thou-

/

sand in a matter ofea few weeks; as
of March 31 there were 5,540 unem-
ployed registered at the local Employ-

ment Office, of whom 2,471 were in,

Sudbury proper; of those unemployed,
697 were registered and received -no
benefits" and approximately 464 lived

in Sudbury and had no jobs or means" of .

livelihood.

The Mine-Mill spokesman declared
that cash relief should be, given by the
city to resident. unemployed who are
drawing no insurance, and that the
Council should demand that the provin-
cial and federal governments assume
their responsibilities in the situation.

. On the question‘ of cash relief, he
quoted the Municipal Act and stated

act revised

to the courts to determine’ the legality '

or otherwise of a strike, and these sec-—

-tions, along with 11, are law. today

simply because of the partisan path
along which the lobby was lured by the
Steering Committee. .
MINE-MILL’S POSITION” is that
with the deletion of these two clauses,

.the bill would be considerably improved '

over the old one. The ,new.act_places

‘ responsibility on the minister of labor,

andleaves him no cushionin the form.
of the Labor‘ Relations Board, which
enabledhim to; pass‘ the buck on any
embarrassing point. ’ _ .
This in itself is a tremendous ad-
vantage- Ken Smith, presiden‘t'of the
District Union," was probably speaking
for many when, he declared, , “That
Board gave me my ulcers 1” “
The _minister' is responsible to the
electorate, as the board wasn’t, and
he hadn't such a majority in the last
election that he can afford to imperil
his seat by getting too tough with labor
in a-lumbering constituency. ~ ’
Incidentally, .this dropping of the

 Labor" Relations Board was also ,_con-;

., >'\w—.«_

,-':

.\.. ,

, possibly in the interests of unity within e
the committee, since one » of them,“

demned by the ‘Steering Committee,

George Home, sits on the Board for the
CCL. 5 ‘ . _
ANOTHER welcome feature to Mine-
-Mill; and other unions, which putvthe
workers, before p rty aims, is that
which‘ speeds up conciliation proced-
ures by giving conciliation officers the

power to make recommendations, Un-

der the olglact they could not do ‘this,
and were to?) often V in consequence

—-treated with. arrogant contempt /by

management. _ -

The bill also specifically provide .

that a worker, can join the union of his
choice, which justifies Mine-Mill’s stand
on many occasions that the Labor Re-

lations Board‘ had no business deter-

mining jurisdictions.‘

After two days of tumult and shout-
ing (Whalen of the IWA which" had
just lost a series of strikes was shrill-

’-ing for the general strike as a solution),

and another futile trip by the Steering = V

Committee the following week, the Bill
became law. Now, in the calmer after-

i math, there's .a, lot of those political

"labor _ “statesmen” who are_ probably

that cities are entitled to grants from
the provincial government forrelief to
“ . . . unemployed and resident poor.”
No 'one“ challenged "his statement, al-
though the Council had maintained so" i
far that the city was no.t_allowed to “
give cash relief under the Municipal  ,.
Act. - ‘ ‘ 
As immediate proposals, Thibault
urged that: ’ V 5

1_.‘,The.Council select a committee to  I i
call on different groups representing

_ Mine-Mill, the industry, the clergy,
businessmen and welfare organizations,

and that a delegation from those groups ;' " 1

I‘ ‘that the provincial ’ government dis- ..

charge its obligations to the‘ unem-
played;

down unemployment, such as public ”
works, new markets for Canadian prod- « 3 V . ..
ucts through extended trade with others ,
countries and a better deal to the un_-. \ ’
employed in improving the unemploy-
ment insurance plan.

 

 

Thibault, however, put the emphasis g
on‘ jobs, because, he said, “the unem-

. ployed don’t'wan,t to get somethingfor .
