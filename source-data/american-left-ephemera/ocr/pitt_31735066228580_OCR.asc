9'1 HUMAN NATURE

 

It is too late in the course of human evolu-
éfj ~ tion to brin_g up the old gag: “You can’t change
human nature.”

As human nature has been changing ever
. since it began, there is no‘point to the objec-
‘«,;_.e’ , tion. It simply isn’t true. -
 It is universally recognized that human na-
ii} _ ture can be changed. "

Q All intelligent efforts at human betterment

L , g are attempts to change human nature—and they
'-if; often succeed.
‘ - ‘When a juvenile court places a “bad boy” ~
 under the kindly control of a probation officer, 
 ’ and the boy ceases to be a gangster and be- i
i comes a good citizen, the human nature of the
; boy hasbeen changed, He has acquired a bet-
;-, ter character. Certain of his qualities have

had been Weak, have become dominant. _
The entire community, in creating a juvenile ,
 court and passing the laws which enable pro- r-S:
,=.V bation officers to take “bad boys” in charge,
' thereby recognizes and bases its action upon
the fact that human nature can be changed: ‘
When a city provides schools, playgrounds, _ 3)
parks, libraries, social centers, night classes, '
etc., in order that youth and adult may have

wholesome recreation and helpful study and in-
struction to absorb their leisure time, thus pre-
serving them from the temptation to become
degenerates and criminals, it recognizes that
human nature can be and is changed.

Every church, every school, every Socialist

-local, and innumerable other organizationsand

 

activities take it for granted that human nature
can be changed, and they go about the effort
to change it. ‘

Sometimes it is changed for the better, some-
times‘for the worse. It can be changed either
way.‘

In spite of the fact that some men, thought-
vlessly railing against Socialism, say, “You can’t
change human nature,” I am quite correct in
my statement that it is universally recognized
that human nature can be changed. The very
men who’. thoughtlessly make this objection

-recognize, in other ways, that human nature

can be changed. They do not realize the in-
congruousness of the objection. They are so
thoroughly surrounded by changing human
nature that they forget its existence, just as
they might momentarilylforget the existence of

- the atmosphere by which they are also sur-
' rounded.

We know more about the human mind than
we used to. We do not know all about either

‘ the mind or the body, but Welareable to ex— S

amine both of them t'o some extent.

In speaking of the human mind.I include
all that is not physical: the intellect, the emo-
tions, the instincts, or What have you. ’ _)

But property which, when privately owned,
is used for the purpose of getting part of the
earnings of others, is social property.

It follows, of course, that it is anti-social
for the great manufacturing, transporting and
mercantile industries to be privately owned.
Social justice demands- that they be owned
collectively, in order that they may not be
used by private owners for the purpose of
diverting‘ the earnings of the masses into their
pockets, but may be operated for the benefit
of all. '

Some say that public utilities should be
owned by the public, but they try to make a
distinction between public utilities and other
industries. ~ , ‘

We are glad to have them go that far with
us — but the distinction they attempt to make
between public utilities and other industries-
has no validity whatever. " ,

By “public utilities” they mean water works, 1 1
gas plants, electric plants, telephone lines, ‘
telegraph lines, street railways, express lines,

: and railroads.

These_are indeed public ‘utilities, but so are
other industries which are used for exploita-
tion; that is, for the purpose of gouging profits
out of workers and consumers.

_A privately owned milk industry takes a
‘'profit from wage earners and consumers, just
as a privately owned water industry does, and
it ought to be owned by the public for the
same reason. ' p

2 0 CERTAIN MISCONCEPTIONS I

The defenders of capitalism, pretend great 
reverence for the constitution, but they violate

‘=3’  plans. This shows that their reverence is a\‘ V

  the people to believe that the constitution is
< sacred, so that they will fanatically oppose
' ‘ * changing it for the better. 4 . ‘

 ff , stitution. . -
' ' The constitution of the United States has its
good points a11d its weak points. It needs to 1
be revised in order to bring it down to date , ,‘.i '
and make it fit modern conditions. ‘ ‘ '
Nevertheless, it has been interpreted to con-
tain implied powers which enable the capitalist,

method of interpretation makes it possible to

: ftution which they think will help.them to hang
onto their graft, such as the constitution, but

they would be just as quick to condemn it if it
did not play into their hands. S
They are deeply attached to capitalism be-
cause it gives them something for nothing.
They love it because it enables them to live off

M 'the labor of others. They revere it because it

enables them tolpass through life with a lordly
strut, acquiring a false importance and ignor-r
ing the rights of others.

The Socialists proudly plead guilty to the

'virtue of assailing the “sacred institution” 0

capitalism. M ‘ h
We assail it at every opportunity. We shall

i. keep on assailing it until we convince the

people that it is unjust. We shall insist upon
changing it‘ into Socialism as fast as possible.
Capitalism has had its proper place in the

evolution of society———a fact which the Socialists

not only admit but assert. Give the devil his

-due. Capitalism has had some good, as Well as .

bad effects, but it is only. a stage of develop-
ment. As such, it is bound to give Way‘ to a

higher and better stage. The good it has done -

has been confined mainly to the development

Lof machinery. It has passed the period of its

usefulness. It works evil and stands in ‘the
way of progress. It is sacred only to social
parasites and their dupes. It is bearable only

because some parts of it have already given '
‘Way to ' socialistic measures.

There are some ‘institutions, however, which
- the Socialists do consider sacred. . ‘ ’
The chief of these, but not necessarily in

Socialists seek to achieve them.

IS OWNERSHIP DIFFUSED?

During the-- World war, when everyone had
to’buy Liberty bonds or be mobbed by hysteri-
cal war fans, the workers acquired a slight

first~hand experience with bonds and the clip"

ping of coupons.

Since then, it has been freely stated, by men
with expansive imaginations, that the workers
are buying so many stocks and bonds that they

are becoming capitalistsxand equal owners of"

the industries.
A few employers virtually compelled their

employes to buy a small‘ amount of stock on‘

the installment plan, but later. this practice

_ virtually ceased.
Some Workers scraped up a few hundred V

dollars and speculated in stocks on the stock '

market, and they were duly wiped off the map. 
As for the bona fide owners of stocks and

bonds———those who buy them for investment
rather than speculation and who have the
actual securities delivered to them—they are
chiefly moneyed men or corporations.
There are multitudes ‘of stockholders, but
they; are largely duplicates. ' . -
If, for instance, you take five big Well-known

corporations~—let us call them A, B, C, D, and E
—and you find th_at A has 5,000 stockholders,
B has 10,000, 0 has 15,000, D has 20,000, and
E has 25,000, you might or might not be so
- illogical as to add these numbers together and
‘conclude that "there are 75,000 separate a'nd
distinct persons owning stock in these five
companies. An investigation would show that,
while a few individuals own securities in only
one company, most of the holders own securi-
ties in several. In many instances the holders .
4 are themselves corporations owning stock in
many other companies. a

 

In the absence of exact statistics, it is safe to . _- .a
say that one-tenth of the people, the rich and
U the Well-to do, own most of the stocks and,
‘ bonds. Many of them own great blocks of_ "E

securities in many concerns,

The rest of the people either do not own any
stocks and bonds, or their holdings are slight. ~

his Most of them do not own any at all.

‘i Ask the millions of wage workers, and most
' of them wou1d.laugh at the very idea of owning

, stocks and bonds. It is preposterous to them.
\, Ask the farmers. Same result.
r.‘ Ask the smaller business and professional
men. Same result. V

Of course there are exceptions. A few do
own securities. '-

It is.

And the masses of" the people must get out
from under the monopoly by owning the in-
dustries themselves. That is, by the collective
ownership and the democratic management of
the industries.

Some additional industries are taken over by

- the collectivity; mainly by the municipalities,
. each year. It is in this way——not by the people
individually purchasing stocks and bonds in ‘

is secured. ' =

for a long time. - ‘

30 CERTAIN MISCONCEPTIONS

Changes, away from capitalism and toward
Socialism, have been taking place for years.
Civilization itself is socialistic. It is an aban-
donment of stark anarchy and a taking on of
some measure of togetherism.

The greatest single industry in the world—
the federal postoffice—is owned and operated
by the public. Likewise the public schools, the
public libraries, and thousands of municipal
water systems, electric plants, fire departments
and_ the like. ,

In some instances these industries, when
taken over from private ownership, are paid
for by means of direct taxation. Sometimes

 

bonds are issued. Sometimes these industries -

are allowed to pay for themselves out of their
own income after they are taken over.

There should be higher income and inherit-
ance taxes, the proceeds to be used in socializ-

V ing industries.

The government should expand the postal
savings banks until they become almost the
sole depositories of money, and use a due pro-
portion of the deposits for the socialization of
industry. - V
- If bonds are issued for socialization purposes
they should be paid directly to those from
whom the industries are purchased, thereby

saving high commissions, instead of selling the‘

bonds first and then paying over the cash.
These are a few suggestions. It is not hard

to find a way to pay for industries when there

is a will to take them over. . .
If other means fail, the public, in taking over

property, uses the law of eminent _domain— -

that is, it condemns the property and, has a
V jury’ appraise it and fix the amount to be paid
 for it. Naturally this method will be contin-

ued, whenever necessary. A
However, there are many instances in which

a contract is made with the owners, agreeing

Also there are instances in

I do not know of-any instance where a water
plant, an electric plant, a gas plant or a street
railway has been given outright to a. city, but

i. in.many instances money, land, parks and

libraries have _been given.

As time goes on, it is my opinion that there
Will be a sort of an epidemic of giving to the
public. Many hard-boiled capitalists will doubt-

’ less hold _out for the last penny, but there are

others who will catch the. spirit of Socialism
and will come across handsomely, donating
stocks and bonds to the public and thereby aid-
ing it to secure a controlling interest in various
industries.

No doubt the public will get some industries

 by the simple process of buying a majority of
the stock in the open market.

As for confiscation, although it Would be

Amorally justifiable, it would not be practicable

under peaceable conditions, asit would disrupt
industry. ' ,

It could happen only if the owning’ class
should use excessively poor judgment. If the
owning class should get the country into a
great war with other countries, ending in revo-
Iution here, there is no telling What might

V happen. Or if the owning class should resort

A FEW CURRENT OBJECTIONS TO
SOCIALISM ANSWERED-

DIVIDING UP

Three men, seated in a hotel dining room,
drifted from one topic-of conversation to
another until they reached the subject of So-
cialism. They disposed of it as follows:

“What do the Socialists want anyhow?”

“They don’t know what they want and
neither does anybody else.”

“Oh yes, they do. Their ultimate object is
.to divide up the property of the country.’.’

. “Th’ hell it is! A
up, it would gravitate right back to them tha
haveit now.” . L '

“Not only that, but they are not sincere.
They only want to divide other people’s prop-
erjty. Mebbe you've heard of the Irishman who
said if he had two farms he would give Mike
one of them,‘ but when Mike said, ‘Pat, if you
‘had two pigs, would you give me one of them?’
he replied, ‘You know I wouldn’t: I've got two
pigslavr» ~ -

That settled the question! The conversation
passed into other‘channe1s. . .

’ derstanding Socialism. Yet, although Socialism

6- CERTAIN MISCONCEPTIONSA  fq ‘

ticability of Socialism, and so sure of its com-'.
ing, that it never occurs to me to use the word
“would”. in connection with it, as my cor-
respondent does. He speaks of what “would”
happen under Socialism. I speak of what
 “will” happen under Socialism, since I have
no doubt that it will come.
To me, the coming of Socialism is not a_.
conjecture. It‘is a certainty. ’
.2: . It is a certainty because Socialism is not
3? -a. mere plan or scheme or invention. On the
contrary, it is the next phase of civilization,
;: , the next stage of industrial and human evolu-
 tion. The evolution of industry and of the
{E race is headed right toward it. .
if ‘ There is only one theory on which Socialism
could fail to- come: the theory‘that the human .
race is degenerating. _
_ If the race is evolving upward, as I believe .
,2; it is, it simply cannot do otherwise than de_- , 
*? velop into a kinder, nobler social order. A, ' -' 1%
grabbing, scrambling, competitive socialorder
.: -would be disgusting and unthinkable to a-
-}; highly -developed people. ' —/ --
' This would insure the coming of Socialism-
even ifpthe evolution of industry were not
bringing it.- ' _ .
Industrial evolution makes it doubly sure.‘   ‘I’
The development of hand tools, used by in- - " '
dividuals, into machinery operated by collec-‘
tions of individuals, has destroyed the old in-_'
dustrial independence of the individual. This
change has ‘made the people interdependent‘
upon each other. It has made them work" to- .
ge_ther. , It has made it impossible for the many"

to secure the full benefit of their earnings
except by the collective ownership and opera-

‘ ‘ ;tion of the industries so that they can be oper-
ated for the benefit of all — and that is
Socialism. " ‘

This industrial evolution has therefore made
the industries_ ripe for collective ownership ——
Socialism — and the province of the Socialists
is to__help the process along by educating and
organizing the people so that they will under-
stand the meaning of it and make the neces-
sary changes sooner than they otherwise would.

_Indeed, the only unripe feature of the whole
situation is’ the popular mind. Mental evolu-
tion has not kept pace withlindustrial evolu-
tion. If it had, we would have Socialism now.
