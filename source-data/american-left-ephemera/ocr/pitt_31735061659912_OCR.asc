* It means, ﬁrst of all, the estab-
ylishm:e’nt or a central economic
plan jointly worked out by

in the light of our whole pro-

duction program, and then the

iienactment of legislation to

guarantee the fulfillment of
manpower needs of industry

7‘ yandifarmingion the basis of a g
e - central economic plan.

It means breaking down all
barriers to ensuring the neces- t t
‘sary manpower for industry in the way ‘of employment and
training of Negro workers ‘and girls.

‘The present confused and inadequate job training system

. must be replaced by an over-all plan for training new work-

ers on a scale to meet the growing demands.

It means helping the trade unions organize the millions oi
new young workers in industry so that their economic condi-
tions can be protected and so that, as part of the labor move-

P ment,they will make their best contribution to production.

That's the production program we stand for. And work for.
But there is one other thing the Young Communist League
is going to help stimulate. Just as the Commando raids throw
terror into Hitler's heart and key up the armed forces for

the coming invasion, so we need Commandos‘ to spark the

production battle. We have set for our members in war in-

dustry the task of becoming Production Commandos who by »
P their personal example will inspire other young workers to

excelin meeting production quotas. By their work, Production

Commando Squads in all plants and departments can key up

war work a hundred fold. l » ’
Responding to the appeal of President Roosevelt for man-

power, we have set ourselves the goal of having 75 per cent.

Keep Fit for Victory

WAR is a tough job. A job
for tough minds and
bodies. To meet the arduous tasks of the days ahead our youth
must be healthy and ﬁt. Fitness in the ﬁrst place must be
based upon adequatewages, hours, working and living condi-
tions. It requires establishment by the government of free
medical centers, clinics and nurseries, the establishment by
cooperation of government, labor and industry of proper rec-

 

L reational and sport facilities for the millions employed in the

war industries. '

Youth organizations and trade unions can themselves make a
big contribution by organizing physical ﬁtness programs for
their members in cooperation with the Hale America move-
ment.

Maybe you have never thought of the Young Communist
League as an organization interested in ﬁtness and sports.
Well, we are. It is our purpose to organize a broad program
of physical ﬁtness activities for our members in the coming
months to make them and keep them ﬁt for their war respon-
sibilities. -

12

 

 

  

Meet the Y.C.L. Now!

THIS is the immediate program, these are the immediate
goals of the Young Communist League.

We aim to make ‘every one of our branches a humming bee-
hive for discussing, planning and carrying out all of these tasks
we have here outlined. For our members and all who are
interested in our activity we want to make these branches
centers where they will ﬁnd recreation and companionship,
enlightenment and education and above all the best possible
way of working for victory over fascism.

We want to accomplish two things:

First: To contribute directly through our own work and
-gactivity to the great effort which our country is now making

to bring about a total mobilization of all its people and re-
sources for offensive action to smash Hitler and the Axis.

Second: By our own example to help stimulate the masses
of youth and their organizations to engage in similar activities
so that the whole generation of American youth may become
fully engaged in the war effort.

We have set ourselves the goal of becoming a model for all
youth and their organizations. Butwe think that no organi-
zation by itself, no matter how enthusiastically it works, can

  

accomplish what must be done to mobilize the youth for sup- J

port of our country in this people's war. V/Vhat is needed above
and beyond this is a great pooling of the fqrces of the youth
and their organizations through the establishment in each city
and on a national scale of powerful united movements of youth
organizations really capable of unleashing the full energy of
the young people of our country. Only then will we really
be able to say that American youth is doing its full share to-
ward winning this people’s war against fascism. The Young
Communist League pledges itself to work for such all-inclusive
national unity of the patriotic youth organizations‘ of the
country.

Only a few weeks ago, the youth of our country were hosts
to a delegation of three young heroes who had come here
representing the magniﬁcent youth of the Soviet Union. _In

13

their own persons these three young heroes——Lieutenant Pavli-
chenko, Lieutenant Pchelintsov, Nikolai Krasavchenko—~typi-
lied the indomitable spirit and the epic bravery and courage
with which the Soviet youth are ﬁghting the Nazi hordes.
There is nothing in all the history of mankind which com-
pares with the glory which the Soviet youth have earned for

\ themselves in the eyes of the youth of America as well as the .

World. By their deeds of valor, the Soviet, youth have torn

. from the eyes of millions of American youth the tissue of lies

and slander broadcast by the defeatists about our great ally,
theSoviet Union.

American youth now sees our Soviet brothers and sisters as
the youth of a great power which is the natural ally of our
country-, from whom we have been kept apart in the past only
by a propaganda campaign of treachery and Hitler-inspired
lies. American youth now sees the young people of the Soviet
Union as the front-line ﬁghters not only for their own country
but the front-line ﬁghters for America as well. It is not only
Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad that the brave Soviet youth
are defending. They are defending New York and Ghicago

g and San Francisco as well.

In the ﬁres of war the youth of America are forging the
bonds of friendship with the youth of the Soviet Union. That
friendship between the youth of our country and the youth

' of the Soviet Union is one of the most precious and powerful

weapons we have in the struggle to smash fascism. It must

. be cultivated in every possible way.

We are inspired and strengthened by the example of the
Soviet youth-—the Soviet youth, who at the front tie hand

. grenades around their belts and fling themselves beneath the

treads of Nazi tanks in order to blow them up; the Soviet
youth from whose ranks came the girl-warrior. Pavlichenko,
whose deadly sniping killed 309 fascist barbarians; the Soviet
youth who make up the guerrilla detachments behind the Nazi

i lines to harass and kill the fascists, to burn theirstores, to cut

their communications; the Soviet youth who perform miracles
behind the lines, increasing war production by 1,000 per cent,

diggingithe fortiﬁcations around Moscow and Stalingrad in7

14

 

  

front of which the fascist hordes were stopped dead in their
tracks.

Much has been said, more must yet be said, about the hero-
ism of the youth of the Soviet Union. But these words must

, r not be a substitute for deeds. For what is needed now are
* deeds by American youth to match the heroism of the Soviet

youth, deeds on the battleﬁelds of Europe, deeds in the war
plants, deeds on the home front, deeds that will raise us to the
heights inspired by the youth of the Soviet Union. It is by
the execution of such deeds that we will cement the friendship
between the youth of our country and the youth of the Soviet
Union.

For international friendship between the youth of the
United States and the youth of the Soviet Union, of Britain,
of China, of Canada, of Latin America, of all the United Na-

. tions is an indispensable factor for victory. Let the youth of
our country join hands with the youth of all lands who are ’

ﬁghting for £reedom—that way lies victory!

These are the things the Young Communist League stands
for. These are the things the Young Communist League works
for. To carry out these objectives, our Young Communist
League needs the militant anti-fascist youth of our country in
its ranks. You who also want to accomplish these tasks-join
the ranks of the Young Communist League and learn how to
become a better anti-fascist ﬁghter for freedom. Take your
place with thousands of other Young Communists and help

a set the pace for young America! .

A C You who want to win the war and want to see a better world

result from victory, join the Young Communist League and
learn how you can conquer your future now!

FIGHT FOR YOUR FUTURE NOW!
s ' By MAX WEISS s A

ANSWERING our country’s call, millions of American

youth have entered the armed forces. They are in the
Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Corps. They are in the
WAACS and the WAVES. They have turned eagerly and will-
ingly away from their homes and friends, from factories, farms,
oﬂices and schools. Their hearts and hands are now set to
doing the single job which confronts the people of America
and all the United Nations—the military defeat of Hitler fas-
cism and the Axis.

Thousands of these young ﬁghters have already had their

names inscribed on America’s immortal scroll of heroes. Colin
Kelly, Lieutenant Bulkeley, Dorie Miller, Meyer Levin-—-these

' are their names. You know them. Bataan, Corregidor, Wake

Island, Luzon, Midway, the Solomons, Dieppe——these are their
monuments. You know them,’too. ‘

Who are they—these ﬁghters and heroes?

Just ordinary young people who worked next to you at the
bench, who went to school with you, who lived in the house
next to yours; just ordinary young Americans. That is, they
were just ordinary young Americans until that supreme mo-
ment came. And then the stuff of which heroes are made came
to the top. Like young Milt Moratz, member of the Garibaldi
Club of the Young Communist League. He enlisted in the Air
Corps and died in action shortly after Pearl Harbor. The
ﬂag which covered his coﬂin was later donated to the Young

Communist League by his parents. lat is now a b-attle ﬂag.
inspiring others to new feats of courage and daring in our war
to rid the world of the fascist monster. '

"Keep ’em Sailing" . ~»

THEN, there are other young
people; their uniiorms are
dungarees instead of khaki or
navy blue. They are young '
Americans who go down to the
sea in ships from every one of
the great ports of our country.
They man the ships of our InC1“?
chant inarine, ships that carry
the stuff which keeps our boys
and our Allies ﬁghting in every
part of theworld. Undauntcd
by fascist submarines which lie
in wait like wolf-packs along
the icy waters of far-ﬂung con-
voy routes, they “keep ’em
. sailing.” 1

Like Sam Funderbuck. He was 18 when he joined the Young
sCommunisteLeagu'e, in February, 1942. He hadcome up from
 the South, son of a Negro sharecropper. When our country
called on men to join the merchant marine to “keep ’em sail-
ing,” Sam signed up». A torpedo missed his ship by a few feet on —
his first trip. Three weeks later, he shipped out again. This
time a torpedo struck home. Sam went down with his crew,
heroes all, who died in action against the fascist barbarians.

9n the home front, millions of young men and young
women work in the war industries of our country turning out
p1anes,_ tanks, guns, ships-whatever is needed to pound and
blast the Axis irom the face of the earth. They are soldiers
too, soldiers in overalls. Among them, too, are heroes, heroes
of the production line. Thousands of them have already won

the highest Army and Navy production awards for setting
new records in turning out the stuff needed for victory on the
battleﬁeld.

You know who these home front battlers are. They’re peo~
ple like Sue, who works in a war plant turning out gun
parts. Sue is the proud wearer of an "E” pin, awarded to the
workers of her plant for outstanding work. At night she at-
tends training school classes in order to become a more skilled
worker. She is a member of the Young Communist League,
giving all she's got for her country. '

But that isn’t all. In every town and neighborhood, on
every Main Street, millions of young Americans are doing
their civilian defense jobs. What do they do in those extra
hours after school and work? You know. They’re air-raid
wardens, salvage collectors, blood donors, collectors of war
relief for our ﬁghting allies. They get in the scrap, they buy
the bonds, they help in the servlcemen's centers and plug for
the Ut.S.O.

This is young America: ﬁghting, working, training, giving
for victory. Yes. ready to make every necessary sacrifice. What
for? Because American youth want swift, sure and complete
victory over the fascist Axis. ,

Youth is battling for its liberty and rights, and for the
future, too! The young people in our ﬁghting forces have not
put aside their thoughts of the future—of the job they ‘will
return to, the girl they hope to marry or the young wife or
husband they want to see again, the  they want to make
for themselves. the normal life they want to live again. It is
impossible for them to do that. They are youth—and youth
lives not only with the present but also in the future. They
are youth-—and to the youth belongs the future.

American youth wants that future to be one of freedom and
liberty. It wants that future to be purged of the brutalized
degeneracy of fascism. It wants ‘to return after this war to a
free world in which it can live and study and work fruitfully
and creatively. It does not want to come back after this war

to a state of affairs to which our fathers before us returned '

4

 

 

 

 

  

row and misery.

But we live at a moment in history when both the present
and the future are tied up in a single bloody knot of war-
war to the death against fascism. The kind of a world Amer-
ican youth will return to after the war depends in the first
place on winning the war! The fascist enemy which threatens
both our present’ existence and our hopes for a free and

after they fought in the last war—-crisis, unemployment, sor-

V happy future holds sway over the continent of Europe. It is

 

there thatlwe must ﬁght to realize our dreams. The future
which belongs to the youth ‘of America tomorrow must be
fought for on the battlefields of Europe today!

The tasks we must carry through today in order to win
victory over fascism are tied up with our dreams for the future
in other ways too. For everything that is done today in order
to help win the war helps ‘lay the basis upon which, after the
war, we must construct our future. There is not a single policy
which is carried out today as a measure to help win the war
which does not in one way or another inﬂuence the kind of
future that awaits us after t-he war.

In the interest of winning the war now, we need policies

that will lead to maximum production in industry. Who can —

doubt that the achievement of such maximum production for
war will also reveal the possibilities of maximum production
and jobs in peace after war? In the interests of winning the
war, we need the full integration of Negro youth into all
phases of our national life. Who can doubt that this will help

set the pattern for our future lives as well? In the interests of /
«winning the war, we need a new approach to assure liberty
, to the colonial and subject peoples of the world. Who can

doubt that this will help set the pattern for a new world to
come after the war? It is not only by what we will do later
but by what we do now, that we help to decide the future.

More than any other youth organization in the United
States, the Young Communist League is stirred by great goals
and great hopes for the future. But it knows that what is
done today to help win the war against fascism is the most
important factor in molding the shape of things to come.

It is in this spirit that it calls upon you to join the Young
Communist League to learn how to: ,

~ Fight For Your Future New

IT IS in this spirit that the Young Communist League hails

with unbounded enthusiasm the brilliant offensive which
our armed forces have unleashed against the Axisdominated
territories of North Africa! The unleashing of this offensive
has let loose an indescribable wave of militant joy among
millions of American young people who have all along given
voice to an insistent desire to get all the way into the war and
to start ﬁghting the fascist beast on his home ground.

The youth of our country must respond to the magniﬁcent
North African offensive of our Army, Navy and Air Corps
with a renewed and heightened determination to strengthen
their every effort for national unity by routing the defeatists
at home, and by increasing a hundred times, over their con-

- tributions to ‘the war effort in order to help carry the North
African offensive through Victoriously and to extend it by in- '

vading the continent ofgEurope to open up a Second Front.
The defeatists and appeasers say that young people should
not speak up on the question of the Second Front. But the
youth of our country don't propose to keep quiet. They agree
completely with President Roosevelt, who recently said:

“Before the ﬁrst’ World War very few people in any coun-
try believed that youth had any right to speak for itself as a
group or to" participate in the councils ofystate. We have
learned much since then. We know that wisdom does not come

necessarily with years; that old men may be foolish, and young

men ma be wise. But in every war it is the younger genera-

tion Whlch bears the burden of combat and inherits all the
p ills that war leaves in its wake.” -

I I I
Yes! The youth of our country have a right to participate in
the councils of state. Let us help our nation to victory by

V_ exercising that right!

Not only do we have a right to participate in the councils
of state by speaking up for the immediate opening of a Second
, l 6

I

 

 

Front; we have an obliga-
tion to do so. For the defeat-
ists are attempting to ex-
ploit the love which our
country has for us, its
youth, to frighten it by
painting a dismal picture of

have to be made by Ameri-

can youth who must do the

_ actual ﬁghting when (the
" Second Front is -opened.

We must not let the de-
featists carry on their treason
to 0-ur country by attempt-
ing to hide behind our skirts.
Loving life as only youth
can love life, we say bluntly

{ that we would rather die in the fire of battle for freedom over
the English Channel and the coasts of France than to live
, 1-ike slaves under the heel of fascism in a Vichy America. A

American youth ﬂings the Munich flag of cowardice back

‘into the faces of the defeatists and appeasers. We say to

those who, under the inﬂuence of the defeatists and appeasers,
hesitate and waver:

To gain—we must risk! To win—we must dare!

President Roosevelt has pledged the opening-of a Second
Front. But his hand is being held back from the execution of
that pledge by the treacherous campaign of the defeatists and
appeasers. Strengthen his hand in the ﬁght against the de-
featists by letting him know that the youth of America are
behind him I00 per oent for a victorious North African offen-
sive and its extension into a Second Front in Europe.

The, Young Communist League—A||-Out foryfhe War

 Young Communist League has pledged its full loyalty,

its entire energy, the lives of its members to the service

of our country in the war against Hitler and the Axis. This

H

I

the huge sacriﬁces that will i

  

is not an idle pledge. For manymonths now, it has been
carrying on the most intense activity in support of all phases
of our country’s war effort.

 

In the next few months the Young Communist League by

will attempt to surpass what it has already done in support of
our country's war effort. In the next few months the Young
Communist League will work toward certain goals in its war
services which it hopes will be anexample to every youth
organization and to every young person.

The Young Communist League believes that our country
needs a maximum strengthening of our armed forces in order
to launch and carry through to victory t-he Second Front
demanded by the people of our country.

We believe that our existing armed forces of over five mil-.
lions have the numbers, the power and drive, right now, to
launch, together with our allies, a great invasion of Europe
to smash at the heart of the Axis. But at the same time we
believe that everything possible must be done to bring about
the maximum strengthening of the ﬁghting ability of these
armed forces. ‘

That's why, months ago, the Young Communist League
became the ﬁrst American youth organization to insist upon
the immediate drafting of the 18 and 19-year-olds. Now Con-
gress has begun to act at the request of President Roosevelt.
The ﬁnest and ﬁttest ﬁghting material of the country  be
mobilized, if legislation is passed for the drafting of these age
groups. We take pride in our record, for we know that to the
degree that the young people spoke their minds in favor of
lowering the draft age, the President's hand was strengthened.

The lengths to which the defeatists were willing to go in
order to prevent our country building up a powerful army
was shown by their attempts to hamstring the army through
the O’Daniel amendment preventing actual service for 18 and
19 year olds for a year. On guard against such defeatist tricks
to hamper the strengthening of our army!

Motivated by the same desire to strengthen our armed forces,
the Young Communists support all proposals that have
been made to eliminate discrimination against Negro youth

8 .

 

 

 
 

 

  

in the armed forces. Our courageous Dorie Millers must not
be jim-crowed or segregated. We cannot and must not permit
Hitler's theories of "race supremacy to divide our youth and
to deprive our country of the full services of the Negro youth
whose qualities are so ably dramatized by such popular ﬁgures

. as Joe Louis and Dorie Miller. Volunteer mixed units of

Negro and white servicemen in the armed forces would be a
ﬁrst step toward the breakdown of segregation. We Young
Communists stand up to be counted for this proposal and give
it our full support. .

This army our country is building up is an army of our
brothers, our sweethearts, our husbands, our neighbors, our
shop-mates and school ehums. Their ﬁghting morale and
strength will be higher if the youth on the home front keep
up their solidarity and friendship with them. That’s one of

our jobs. The Young Communist League, which supports the

splendid servicemen’s welfare work of the U.S.O., also con-
tributes its share. We have already donated money to the
U.S.O.; we have helped it in its Victory Book collections. Now

_we’re going to have public dedications of service ﬂags to “our

boys” in all parts of the country.
The Young Communist League is going to share the holi-

day season with the men in the armed forces by collecting and ’
sending olf thousands of gift packages to the boys——and we’ll »

continue doing this after the holidays, as well.

Producﬁon Commandos for Victory

TOLD you about Sam, who died to “keep ’em sai1ing,”

J “  about Sue, war worker who breaks production records.

They are typical of thousands of Young Communists who
keep "em rolling, sailing, streaming oi} the production lines
to the front lines. They are helping to fulﬁll the responsibility
that the youth of our country have for going over the top in
the battle for production.

Because youth has that responsibility the Young Commu-
nist League ﬁghts for policies which will help guarantee
maximum‘ production. How? Well, in many ways:
