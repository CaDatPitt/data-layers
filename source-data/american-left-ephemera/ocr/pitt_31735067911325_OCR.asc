“'51 bargaining campaign

Mine-Mill’s 1951 bargaining

_ campaign was moving ahead on

all fronts last week, with a large

majority of the union’s far—f1ung 

locals either’ completing discus-
sion of their Wage and contract

demands or actually presenting
the demands to employers. .

All locals were reminded,’ in _

letters which went out from the
International Union office, that
they- must send letters to the
employers 60 days before the ex-
piration of their contracts, noti-

fying the companies of intention‘
to_ negotiate new wage and con- ~

tract terms.

The law also requires that-if a
settlement has not been reached
in negotiations by 30 days before
expiration of _the old contract,
notices of a dispute must be sent
by the_ local union to both federal
and state .conciliation,and media-
tion services. _

Anaconda Copper »Mining Co.
locals in Montana were planning
to send letters. expressing their
intention to renegotiate last
week. The special speed with
which Montana ACM negotiating
committees were moving was
taken as an indication of strong

rank‘-and-file pressure for an out- ‘

standing wage and contract set-
tlement this year.

All American Smelting & Re-
fining Co. locals were planning to
send simultaneous letters to the
various plant managers on April
25, announcing 1951 bargaining

AT THE SAME TIME, the
8-man AS&R national bargaining
committee disclosed that it will

C\hold a final pre’-bargaining meet-

ing in Perth Amboy, N. J., April
29-.— Maurice Travis, International
secretary-treasurer, is ‘chairman
of the committee.

Other members of the AS&R
bargaining group are Tom Saboy

Local 625, Roy Murphy of Local

Roberts of Local 461, John Gett-
man of Local 557, Primo Cabello
of Local 700, and Silverio Alva of

In all locals of Kennecott and

going forward on demands, strat-

egy and timing.

AFL, CIO return
to mobilization

setup without gains

WASHINGTON—Leaders of AFL’
and CIO were back in the mobilization
setup again this month without agree-
ment on a single fundamental question
of prices, rents, the wage freeze, taxa-
tion or credit control.

Three days after the big reconcilia-
tion, a 6-cent wage increase which had
been agreed upon for a million non-
operating railroad workers was ruled
out by Economic Stabilizer Eric John-
ston and Assistant Army Secretary
Karl Benetsen.

Observers here were convinced the.

action against these railroad workers
would not have been taken without the
prior knowledge of labor’s “representa-
tives” on the National Advisory Board
or without their presence on the board:

AFL PRESIDENT Green, CIO Pres-
idegitu r%,FL_§ecé-'Il‘{reaﬁ; Meany
an - resi en eu er were
named to “represent” labor on the
board after Truman promised to meet
with the board personally once a month.

Mobilization Director C. E. Wilson is
chairman of the 17-man board which
has also four men each from bnsiness,
agriculture and the public.

The United Labor Policy Committee,‘

composed of top leaders’ of AFL, CIO
and Brotherhoods, had agreed to accept
Truman’s invitation since “it gives
their representatives an opportunity to
lay their complaints before Truman
personally in the presence of Wilson."

FIRST COMMENT on the ruling

against the railroad workers’ raise .

came from President Jesse Clark of
the AFL Signalmen:

“The decision will have serious reper-
cussions. We signed an agreement at
the White House with the President
looking on. Certainly a contract should
be binding.”

Other railroad labor leaders pointed
out that while the government has used
a nominal “seizure” of the roads to
stop three strikes, there has not been
the slightest interference with man-
agenient’s conduct of its affairs.

What. the railroad unions’ next step

will be hatnot been announced. ‘

 LOS ANGELES, Calif.—Western
Mechanics Local 700 is one of eight
progressive unions here who will throw
their full weight into a campaign
against the wage freeze policies of the
Truman administration.

The eight locals recently formed the

, United Labor Action Committee of Los-
'Angeles. The post of recording secre-

tary in the ULAC will be filled by a
representative named by Local 700.

The Committee has opened a petition
campaign‘ in all the shops covered by
the eight locals, in the form of a list
of “grievances” addressed to President
Trunian.

Meantime, Local 700 has opened its
1951 bargaining campaign by starting
/negotiations with five key die-casting
'companies in Los Angeles. The talks
followed a series of shop meetings in
which the workers mapped theirwage
and contract demands. ’

Does this make sense?

WASHINGTON—One of the lead-
ing anti-rent control lobbyists in this
capital has now’ -been appointed direc-
tor of the advisory board branch of

,' the Office of Housing Expediter.

The new official in Expediter Tighe
Woods’ office is George W. Profitt.
The office is supposed to enforce rent
control. From January, 1948 to May,
1950, Profitt was a paid lobbyist for
the National Apartment Owners’ Asso-
ciation, which opposed extension of
rent control in 1948, 1949 and 1950.
Woods himself is a former propa-
gandist for the Chicago Real Estate
Board, which has been active in the
(fight against rent control.

End lramellp trials

WASHINGTON, D. C.—\-The frame-~

up “trials” of seven officials in the

United Electrical Radio & Machine‘

Workers have ended here with dismis-
sal of charges against Tom Fitzpatrick,
UE Local 601, and Talmadge Raley,
UE Local 766. _

All seven UE leaders had been
charged with “contempt of Congress”
for refusing to help the House un-
American Committee to frame them-
selves and other trade upionists.

Julius Emspak, UE secretary-treas-
urer and Tom Quinn, UE Local 601,

‘were found “guilty” several weeks ago

and Emspak was sentenced to 6 months
in prison and $500 fine, while uinn
was sentenced to 4 to 12 months in
prison and $1,000" fine. -

Angry protests poured into Wash-
ington from trade unionists all over the
country‘following the verdicts. After
the initial sentences, the remaining’ five
UE leaders were" all acquitted. '

The ‘campaign demanding that the
case. against ~i~Emspak and Quinn be
dropped is gathering momentum. Trade
unionists are urged to write their Con-

gressmen asking them to act and speak

out against these frame-ups.

Torrington leaders hit
raiders in ‘open letter’

TORRINGTON, C‘onn.—All eleven of
the officers and all 25 of the stewards.
of the Torrington Brass Workers Local
423 have. signed an open letter con-
demning the current raid by the United
Auto Workers in Connecticut.

The letter points out that only the
American Brass Co. will “benefit by
these union—busting‘ activities.” And it
adds: “We like our Local 423, Mine-
Mill Union because it is run by the
rank and file members wIzo~wo'rk in!
the plant. We have the right to agree
or d2'sag7'ee on any issuue or policy
which may affect the worker. We have
real democracy in M'ine-Mill.”

Connecticut workers are reminded
that the UAW raid, like other raids in
the past, is timed “on the eve of wage
and contract negotiations,” and can
only serve the purpose of disturbing
the solidarity needed for successful
bargaining._ .

Mississippi ‘classes.
JACKSON, Miss.—First of a series

on the subject of Union Building and
Shop Steward training.

classes were so successful that ar-
rangements have been made for month-

. Unemployment to zoom

Wilson control plan
blow to small firms

WASHINGTON,D. C. -— The death
knell has been sounded for thousands
of small businesses by a National Pro-
duction Authority order under which a
“controlled materials plan” will be set
up starting June 1. ‘

In addition to killing off countless
small business firms, the plan will
cause serious mass unemployment
through rccd job transfers, according
to labor conomists.

The plan being clamped by mobiliza-

tion czar Charles E. Wilson, on the _

U. S. economy defines a small business
as one hiring up to 500 persons. With
thousands of these companies being
driven to the wall, unemployment will.
mount during readjustment. ‘'

Wilson's order 'ves first call on
copper, aluminum and steel to the
handful of corporations which .get
prime military production contracts.
What’s leftover the small companies
can scramble -for. 7

The plan is even worse than the
World War II controlled materials
plan. Describing what happened then,
former War Production Board chair-\_
man Donald Nelson said it forced

small business into “a semi-feudal state A

of dependence on big and°medium busi-
ncss.” ‘
Under the WWII plan, Nelson said
big industry told WPB what it wanted.
“What w_e did,” he continues in his book
“Arsenal of Democracy,” “was set up

rules under which the game could be i

played the way industry said it had
to plan it.” ,

The way it worked in World War II,
according to the House small business
committee, small business got only 8
per cent of production through sub-
contracts with the -big boys. '

On February 1, 1951, the Senate
small business committee reported that
the aluminum order alone was sound-
ing the death knell of 14,000 small fab-i
ricators.

pose of.raiding Steel disrupters and
thus clear the way for bargaining, Ta-
rcoma Smeltermen’s Local 25 has asked

' T and been granted an early election at
S‘ the AS&R smelter" here. Date for the
election will be April 30.

The Steel raid has been going on for
many weeks. While it has made no
progress, nevertheless it could be used

, .to disrupt negotiations. Leaders of

7 tion as a means of eliminating this

’last desperate attempt’

GREAT FALLS, Mont.— Mine-Mill
leaders in Montana last week expressed
surprise over the fact that CIO Steel

" union raiders had filed petitions for
irepresentation elections at the ACM
smelters here and in East Helena.

William Mason, Mine-Mill executive
board member for district 1,‘ branded
the petitions the “last desperate at-

r tempt of the Steel raiders to salvage
‘_ ‘something from the long and costly
raid‘ they have conducted in Montana.
_. “Steelknows that its chance of win-
I -iningis "almost zero in both places and
tea these petitions are nothing but a dog-
‘ "in-the-‘manger attempt to disrupt our
. negotiations with the ACM and the
. AS&R.!’

' Mason pointed out that “the fact
thatpetitions were filed only in Great
.5 Falls and East Helena amounts to an
"admission by Steel of final defeat in
—.Montana.

‘ers would rnev 1' vote to separate them-
jselves from Mine-Mill locals in Butte,

WASHINGTON (FP) —_-Despite the ’

zation has failed to act on documented
‘charges, of meat price gouging made
four weeks ago by a leading chain of

Gen. Mgr. Paul Kernan of the Dis-
trict Grocery stores sent his evidence

. to the local price office March 12, com-

plaining the stores were forced to pay
from $2,500 to $5,000 a week more for
wholesale meat than they could charge
at retail. He gave names and addresses
of the wholesale dealers.‘ The local of-

Fredericktown workers

take ‘overdue rest‘

FREDERICKTOWN, Mo.-—-Workers
at the St. Louis Smelting & Refining
Co. here last week were “enjoying a
long overdue rest” to recuperate from
the heavy burdens of speed-up in the
mine in recent months.

The company speed-up has been
growing. steadily worse for a long
time. The workers, and their union-—
Mine-Mill Local .809——have tried re-
peatedly to get the company to sit

_ down and negotiate on the speed-up

issue. But the company refused flatly

even to talk about it, despite the anti- '

speed-up provisions in the contract.

The climax came 10 days ago, when
the company foreman ordered a worker
from the labor crew, with no previous
experience__ operating a drill, to go to
work on the jumbo drill. The order
was made at a time when an extra
drillman was available in the mines.
The workers then decided unanimously
that it was time for them to take their
“long overdue rest.”

CIO leader attacks

Truman's ‘raw denl'
‘The refusal of Mine-Mill to go along
with National CIO’s endorsement of
Harry Truman for _the presidency in_
1948 was one of the main\ reasons.

our union was expelled from CIO.

In recent, weeks, more and more
top CIO officials have been admitting,
in effect, that Mine-Mill-was right——
and they" were wrong—in 1948. For
e x a m p l e, secretary-treasurer Emil
Mazey of the United Auto Workers
said this during a speechin Washing-
ton last month: 7 _ ,

“President Truman was elected in

'1.948 on a Fair Deal platform. I sub-

mit that the President has made only
feeble efforts to put that program into
operation. In stead of a fa_ir.deal~/we

are geting draw deal. The President I

has the responsibility to remove Wil-

son ( Director of Defense Mobilization)

Thecase originated ‘when the com-

job following" his release from a Mary-
land state mental hospital where he
was taken by police‘ while under the
influence of liquor. He was released
from the hospital after two weeks with
a clean bill of health.

"IN SPITE. OF the fact that Savoy

had documents to prove that nothing
was wrong with him, the company~re-
fused to put him back to work.‘ Savoy
has been a militant Mine-Mill steward

‘ Dr. Edward Carter of Philadelphia in‘

February, the union emphasized Sa-
voy’s record as a fighting steward, in
the-plant and’ brought to bear all the
medical recordsand documents in his
defense. -

ONE OF THE MOST telling docu-
ments was a petition signed by the
overwhelming number of fellow work-
ers in his department, addressed to the
arbitrator, stating that they ,wanted
to continue working with him and de-
manding that he be reinstated’ on the
job. ’ . _

Also impressive was the fact that the
entire plant membership showed an
aroused interest in defense of one of

‘their best stewards.

Calgary metal workers

demand 20¢ increase

CALGARY‘, Alberta — Preparations
are under way here by members of
Calgary Metal Workers Local 800 for
negotiationspwith Dominion Bridge Co.,
Riverside .Irbn & Engineering Works,
Westeel Products, Calgary Iron Works,
Northwestern Brass Co., and Canadian
Foundry Co. _ ' .

A policy statement issued by the 10-
cal demanded an hourly wage increase
of 20 cents. It pointed out that the
present price_and tax increases arenot
the responsibility of the membership‘

but are due chiefly to the-iv“proved*

profit position of the companies. And,
in view of these increased profits, the
local said‘ the companies‘ should relieve
the; crisis facing their employees by
granting the wage increase.

I  NAM, Chamberof Commerce and even

I» the Administration have been saying a lot

of things _about taxes recently, such as’:

0 Why worry? Taxes are not high—you can
’ -pay much more.

‘ .0 Low income groups get the bulk -‘of the in-

come.’ If you want to raise .money, you have
to tax the low income groups. ~’ ‘

‘.0 Do not worry about war profits. The excess
profits tax will recapture those for the gov-
ernment. - ‘

.0 Low income groups have excess purchasing
’ power and you have to tax them to. prevent
inflation.

0 Since the rich now pay such heavy taxes-—
we have -to tax the poor.

' .0 Workers get more back in Government serv-

ices than they payin taxes.
Are these statements true_ or false?

Why Worry?
‘Taxes are not so high

I Let’s say’ you are a typical manufacturing

. Worker. You‘ start working your regular 8-hour

day. For the first hour and three-quarters, you
work to pay your tax bills—federal, state and
local, direct and indirect. ’

The next hour. and five minutes you Work in

I

_ order to make what your employer pays in

taxes. This includes profits taxes and state
and local taxes. ~

' Thus, the first 2 hours and 50 minutes of
your work day goes to pay taxes. These ﬁgures
are based on the most authoritative government
information now available.

This is not true. It is the well-to-do who get

Over half (53 per cent) of all families in the 0

United States—those inthe $3,000 and below

-On theother hand, the one-sixth of all fam-

to pay nnore taxes - you are
lnaking good money

You can afford to pay, taxes only after you
meet. the grocery bill, pay your rent and the
other costs of a necessary minimum standard
of living. _ s L

The Treasury Departmentnitself made. a
study in 1948 which indicates what a family
needs before it can afford to pay any taxes:
One person .Needed $1,560
Married couple ......  ................... -.Needed 2,240

Family of 3 Needed 2,860
Family of 4 ‘ Needed 3,400
Family of 5 Needed 3,880
Family of 6 Needed \4,350

These amounts look pretty skimpy to us. The
Heller Budget of health and decency for a wage
earner’s family of four cost $4,111 at that time
—well above the $3,400 budget of the Treasury
Department study. But let’s bend over back-
wards and say if you get more than they indi-
cated perhaps you could afford to pay some
taxes. In 1948, however, according to the same
Treasury, Department study, 21 million families
——46 per cent of all United States families-—
got less than the amounts shown. And this
was in 1948, a year of prosperity.

Although the bulk of low incomefamilies
can’t afford to pay any taxes, the average

working class family pays approximately $70
a year in taxes at the present time.» 
Taxes on people who get less than they nee
to live on can only come at the expense of food
shelter, clothing and the other minimum neces,
sities of life. ' ‘ - _
If the Treasury Department ended all taxe;

‘ which undercut minimum necessary, living

standards——income taxes on the poor and fed‘
eral excise taxes on common consumption'item"
-—it would give up roughly seven billion dollars
ayear in revenue. _ ' - 2, 

This seven billion dollars could _easil' "e

raised from corporation profits alone. ‘~.Ano ...sr’.’<.

$3 billion could easily be raised by closing the
loopholes in the excess profits tax. Thirty-five
billion dollars more could still be taken from in
comes above $5,000 before the top seven million

taxpayers would be reduced to the average in-  ’

     TAXES!

Go easy on the rich. bear down on the workers—tho+'s

the program. There's plenty wrong when Mixes undercut ‘a

living wage.

of income in'1939 under‘ Roosevelt's New Deal
program because the low income groups ' got
more back in federal expenditures for their
benefit than they put in-. Andconversely, the
rich got less. ‘

In 1951 the picture is completely different.

' The low income groups paid $17.7 billion in

these same taxes; they received back only_$5.7
billionin expenditures for “people’s welfare.”

So we have redistribution now-—-only it’s from T

the poor to the rich- r

Oﬁel 770. 6 We have _a

progressive tax systeln

c

The government report cited above. says,
“Who now actually bears the heaviest percent-

. age burden-expressed in terms of taxes to in-

come? The families getting less than $1,000
or those getting over $3,000? The fact is shock-
ing but true that it is those in the lowest in-..
come bracket who already bear a dispropor-
tionate share of the tax burden. -. . . Note that
the total tax structure in this country, includ-
ing state, local and_ federal taxes,_bears most
heavily on those getting under $1,000 a year.
Only the -small number lucky enough to get
$7,500 a year or over bear a larger proportion-
ate share of the total tax burden.”

The same report shows that this will be even
worsened as a result of inflation: “If the theory
that needed sacrifices should be imposed some-
what equitably is the only one that squares
with the American conscience, then'note that

the considerable rise in food prices. has- already

imposed no small amount of belt-tightening
upon tens of millions of families ‘in the low-

’ income brackets becausetheir incomes tend for
g the most part to consist of wages, salaries,

pensions, or other incomes that usually increase
less rapidly and therefore fall behind in ‘the
inﬂation merry-go-‘round. ‘

“On the other hand, what brackets of income
get most of the windfall benefits? Those, of
course, that are ~ effectively organized to in-
crease their incomes or receive direct benefit
from increases in prices; that is, the flexible
incomes derived from profits, from returns on ‘
farm and business operations, from speculation
in the commodity and stock markets, from’
ownership of equities, and from dividends. In
what income brackets do such increasingly’ be-
come more and more important? In those from
$4,000,on up. Clearly, increased taxes should
tap windfall incomes most. Those benefiting
most from inflation are increasingly found in
brackets above $3,000-$4,000.

You know the 1 poor evade
most taxes

A Federated Press article on February 8,
1.951, was entitled, “Big Shots Cheat on Income
Taxes ;- Small Earners More Honest.” In it
Commissioner of Internal Revenue George J.

Schoeneman revealed that seven out of every

ten tax returns onpersonal and corporate in-
come over $25,000 showed “discrepancies” last
year. '  I ‘
“He said there is a lower frequency of ‘errors’
in the lower income brackets. The worst of-

fenders, he said, arebusinesses with a margin

of error of five out of every‘ 10 returns.”

The poor cannot dodge taxes. Just try to
dodge a sales tax", an excise tax, "a withholding
tax, or a property tax paid as part of your
rent. It can’t be done. But the rich do evade
and escape taxes, as the following chart shows.

5 Some $64 questions for President

Truman and your Congressmen

How can you justify not taking additional
taxes from fantastic corporate profits, when

p the alternative means taking food from chil-

ren?

How can you permit wealthy families to split
income between husband and wife and deprive
the Government of $800 million a year, when
the alternative means keeping others in dire
need? 

Last year stockholders failed to report some
one __ billion dollars in dividends." How can you

/ justifyno withholding-tax on dividends while

you wit old taxes on wages?

The ecretary of the Treasury has recom-
mended increases in estate and gift taxes to
yield an additional $500’million a year. How

_ can you justify going easy on theestate and
gift transfers of the well-to-do» when the price-

of that solicitude is heavy taxes on the _ill-clad,
ill-fed and ill-housed? v

The Wealthy oiland ‘mining companies raid .

thepublic till to thetune of $500 million dollars

a year by a tax dodge called “percentage de-
pletionon mineral properties.” How. can you
justify satisfying the lobbyists of these special
interests at the cost of taxes on decent Ameri.
can families living at.or near pgverty condi-

tions? .
How can you justify permitting the war

profiteers to save one billion dollars a year by
' -' means "of “accelerated amortization allowances,”
when it means taking about one billion dollars
from the grocery baskets of American families?

You might ask the President and Your Con-

gressmen these questions.

Here,'clearly .is the source of any additional

revenue which may be needed. No taxes should
be levied, on American families whose income is
not large enough. to maintain‘ living, standards
of health ‘and’ decency‘. .‘

‘No taxes should, undercuta living wage. ; _

I  .I'o the Editor: _.

What do we think? Well, mostly we
think about the high ‘cost of living and
"about the big bite that the taxes take
from the paychecks. But first and fore-
most in _everyone’s mind is the possi-
bility of the Korean “police action”
turning into a real beef, although 60,-
OO0‘American casualties so far seems
pretty real. -

Every guy on the job that 1 have
talked to has nothing but disgust for
the way things are being handled in
Korea. 4 To ‘tell’ you truthfully, most
guys just: can’t tell you why 60,000.
American boys are named on the eas-
ualty lists.

We may be more fortunate in Cali-
fornia than other parts of the country,
because somebody has‘ the foresight
and courage to put forward a program
that people can grab onto and support
for peace. Lester A- McMillan, Assem-
blyman from Los Angeles, has intro-
duced the following resolutions:

Whereas, In this grave hour in its
history, the’.-Xmerican Nation stands in
the perilous zone which marks the

boundary between war _undeclared and '

war declared; ' and

Whereas, There is a real danger that
the war in Korea may precipitate a
third world war, of ,total destruction,
fought with atomic weapons; and

Whereas, The overwhelming senti- “

ment of the American people favors a
cessation of hostilities in Korea and

supports the position that the United P
Nations forces should halt at the 38th .

parallel; and

' Whereas, The American Congress
has never declared waragainst China
/or North Korea and the traditions of
lthe American people condemn the wag-
ingof undeclared war for -undeclared

="- aims and objectives; now, therefore,

be it '

Resolved, By the Assembly and Sen-
ate of, the State of California, jointly,
That the legislature of the State of
California respectfully memorializes
the Congress of the United States, ex-
pressing its hope and expectation that
appropriate measures and directives
will be formulated to the end that the
United Nations forces now fighting in
Korea will halt at the 38th parallel and
that a concerted effort/’ will be made
immediately’ to negotiate _a peaceful
settlement of the tragic conflict» there

_which ‘threatens to" precipitate a third 4

world war; and be it further

Resolved, Thai: the Chief Clerk of the
Assembly be hereby directed to trans-
mit copies, of this resolution to the
President and Vice President of the
United States, to_ the Speaker of the
House of Representatives, and to each
Senator and Representative in the Con-
gress of the United States.

I‘ think that this sort of legislation
should be supported and pressured for,
in order to return to sanity in the world.

our soldiers

     OPE N F o R U M 

 

To the Editor:

In writing this, I share your hope
that We will in some°way serve the
cause of Peace. One of us may even hit
on a basic rule of the universe lacking
which there can be no Peace. It’s
good sign, in a country at war, that
we don't close our minds to the possi-
bility that Peace cannot be won by mili-
tary means, just as at the start of the
Korean adventure we may have won-
dered amid our abundance why we
should find cause for conflict with peo-
ple who owned so little.

Even before the land was devastated,
were oppressed by the
signs of pover_ty. “These people haven’t
anything, not a decent house or a hard-
ware store, and you wouldn’t touch the
junk they try to save!”. How many
times'have such expressions figured in
the. letters home? Yet all of -us have
been oblivious to a greater need among
Koreans——to be a free and independent
people.

_What they wanted was equality and
a country of their own, the same desire
that in recent years produced India and
Pakistan, Israel,’ Indonesia, even China.
Equality plus nationalism along racial

and religious lines—those are the forces .

making for war in the world today.

The time is past when one white man
With a gun in his hand could outvote a

_ thousand Asiatics. From now on, each

person—white, brown, yellow or black
—.-has one vote, and we who owned the
ballots and.-the ballot-box for so long
must learn whatit means to be out-
voted. When that time comes, as it will
for our white minority, we must not
trust. to guns to weigh the balance in
our favor. It may even be a joyful ex-
perience to lea-rn at last what equality
and brotherhood really mean. ‘

. If unequality is a cause of unrest in
the world, then the elimination of it is
a move in the direction of Peace. And
to work toward that end, we don't need‘
to go abroad; there are things to be
done at our own job, in our own town,
in our own street.

The secret for achieving freedom is
that we should strive for others’ free-
dom and in that way free ourselves.
I would like torquote from a letter al-
ready published: “The fight for free-
dom is one that should begin at home
where fifteen million Negroes are far
from being free. As I am a Negro, this
means everything to me."

To that end we should demand a Fair
Employment Practices clause in every
contract, and then give meaning to that
expression of‘ good intention by making
sure that minority groups are repre-
sented on the job. ' For it is true in this
as in all things that faith cannot live
.ﬁi_thout the act that expresses faith.
I have in mind a fair shake for the
people of allrraces, but the one by which
we are measured in the eyes of _the
world is the Negro-—those fifteen mil-
lion Who are still not free. They will

be the rock in the road that tumbles all
our claims for democracy or they will
be the cornerstone of a new world order
proclaiming equality and brotherhood
and meaning every word it says..

Now, after contemplation of so vast
a scheme, to return to a point where
each of us can act our part—it is fun-
damental that we not so much accept
the Negrodnto our unions or encourage
him to‘ njoy our social and economic
rights as\that we should be accepted
and trusteihin his world. Although the
National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People, the NAACP,
was founded mainly by whites, it has
come to be regarded in this country
and throughout the world as a Negro
organization for the protection of
Negro people. ’

If we find-it in our heart to endorse
the things the NAACP stands for—jus-
tice, civil liberties, democracy in fact
as well as in name——then it is a duty to
join with it in the quest for equality
and freedom which alone mean Peace.
Here in California, we have another
organization with a solid record.of
achievement among all racial groups,
the Council for Civic Unity. And we

must learn to walk before we can run,’

so must we learn to achieve Peace
among the people in our locality before
we can win Peace throughout the world.‘

We shall do ourselves no good in this
revolutionary world if our main con-
cern_,is to salvage what is left of the
white man’s self-esteem. Rather, we
must commit everything to the flood,
trusting to the destructive element to
bear us up as it sorts out the real from
the false. ‘If democracy is sound: so
will we in the degree that we want it
for all people either be saved or lost.

We ‘should support the American
Peace Crusade, feeling proud that we

learn of it first from our union paper,

and paying all honor to the men ‘who
promote" it. The Crusade will be a
rallying point-for all of a similar mind
and much good may come of it. But
we need this other crusade to be waged
unnoticed in the background, made up
of the ordinary, unknown men and
women of the working class.

Their cause will not be achieved. to-
morrow or this year, but we can strive
with a good heart, knowing there can
be but one outcome. Opposing the
ranks of force and privilege, we have
all the zeal for democracy, equality,
human brotherhood and understanding
that the whole earth can furnish.’

Senators William Benton and Brien

This is to inform you on the latest
situation in the brass industry. '

Although there was some slight im-
provement a few weeks ago in the em-
ployment situation in brass, we are
once again on the downward path. In
Ansonia, the Sheet Metal Department,
employing,600 people, is now working
two days a week; Casting Shop, em-
ploying 250 people, is on four days a.
week; Coarse Wire Depaftment is on
a 4-day week; Metal Storage, employ-
ing 100 people, is—on 4 days a week.
Similar situation exists in the‘ brass
plants in Torrington and Thomaston.
The companies inform us that.this is
due to a shortage of copper. ‘

We cite these facts to indic-ate that
in some places the situation is getting

When we last met with you, Con-
gressman Morano suggested that the
entire Congressional Delegation accom-
pany a representative Union group to

_of the Canadian Peace Congress:

While I would naturally like to be

as follows: 4 "  V‘ ‘-f

1. The abolition of the atomic bomb. ‘ ‘

2. An end to the Korean war and 7 
peace with China. 

3. Opposition to the rearming of
Germany, Japan and in fact all nations! '

4. Recognition of t People's’ Gov-
he seating of
said government in the U. N.

5. Opposition to universal military‘-
training and extension of the draft.

' 6. An end to racial discrimination’ in
all walks of life. _ «

7. To safeguard and improve the f A
standards of living of the people of «A
Canada. .. l p (f _:---_ »

8. Defense of civil liberties and the "
right and moral obligation to 'advocate‘ '
World peace. ' ‘ 

9. A roll-back of prices to the 'level_ ‘
of June, 1950, and strict control of said”:
prices, including rent controls, and sub- 1
sidization where necessary.- _ b .

A uAw tells
wrong lie!

BUFFALO, N. Y.——Workers at
ABC plants here and in Connec-
ticut were amused recently at a
“poison-pen” letter sent them by
.one Jay Watkins, a UAW—CIO
raiding payroller.

The letter made lots of glamor-
ous promises, and then said that
Local 603 had “voted unanimous-
ly within the last year to leave
Mine-Hill and come over to the
UAW—CIO.”

,- The rest of the letter was filled
;.,- _ ‘ iwith similar lies——but it happened
’ e that ABC workers were able to
check up on this particular one.
Why? Because Local 603 is an
ABC local! It covers the plant
guards at the American Brass
plant here in Buffalo.

are still in Mine-Mill—-and have
expressed no intention of leaving
their union.

Band ﬁrm at-$100,000 a year

James H. Rand, president of
Remington-Rand, Inc., one of the
most notorious anti-labor corpor-
ations in the U. S., made an an-
nouncement last week from his
yacht off the Florida coast. 1

General .. Douglas MacArthur,
he said, “will beelected, to the
board of ‘Remington-Rand and
assume an active» part in its
worldwide affairs within the
next 90 days . . .” According to
the Chicago Daily News, Rand
will pay MacArthur a salary of
$100,000 a year. ,

Judging by their anti-labor records,
MacArthur and Rand will make a love-
ly couple.- Rand is notorious for his
development of the infamous Mohawk
Valley Formula, a strikebreaking tech-
nique widely used in the 1930s. ‘

MacArthur was ousted from all his
many positions in the Far East for
violating U. S. Department policy: for
disobeying orders of the U. S. Presi-
dent, and for trying to smash the
American‘ tradition under which gov-

ernment policy is made by civilians

rather than military men.

The Rem-Rand firm has $17‘/2 mil-
lion invested in foreign countries. Its
overseas plants are in England, Scot-

Last December,R.em-Rand announced
it was forming a new company’ with
the Nippon Typewriter Co., to be
known as Japan Remington-Rand Co.,
which will manufacture English lan-
guage typewriters. .Rem—Rand will
have exclusive distributionv
throughout the far east,
Japan.

The day MacArthur left Tokyo on
his way back to the states, a'*Tokyo
broadcast said all people and vehicles
were banned from the streets on- the

I

except in

route to Haneda airport where his_~'

plane took. off. This, said the an-
nouncer, was the “Japanese way of
showing their love for 3-IacArthur.”‘

Whether this love is shared by Japa-
nese workers Whose strikes have been
broken at MacArthur’s command was
not mentioned. Nor was there mention
of tribute from any of the 10,000 active
unionists who have been fired in the

num and magnesium, assistant to the
president of Matthiessen & Hegeler
Zinc Co.

chinery Division, is from Worthington

- Leland E. Spencer .

Springfield Tire Co., a subsidiary of"

Goodyear. . ;

The list is longer—;but this is long
enough to see who is running Wash-
ington. _All from Big Business are
looking for all they can get for Big
Business behind the smoke-screen on
Directors of Defense.

Now they tell us through big busi-
ness’ so-called public press of April 5
that there is no’ need for price control
"on .consu1ner goods, as the “law of sup-
ply and _demand” is forcing business to-
lower prices. Yet about 90 per cent pf
all taxes are spent for making war.
Facts are, our 10 per cent will no
longer buy food, clothing, etc. Theysay
a buyers’ strike is the cause of the
drop in sales. The workers know the

high-prices, higher and higher. taxes’

forced on the low income group has
deflated our dollar to 33 per cent of
what a dollar was in World War II.

" War is profitable to the Truman-Big
Business Directors of so-called de-
fense. But it is driving the workers in-
to starvation and slavery.

, So’ why are the workers ‘demanding
peace, wage increases and -honest price
control? --

The workers are not interested, as
Murray, Green and the so-called labor
statesmen say, in a partnership with
war-profit hungry big business.

We "must have living wages in.19.51, A

for our families, wages that will edu-
cate dur children, wages that will buy

that we can live without fear of the

If wanting Peace and decent living’

wages makes the lAmerican -workers

ed on the. rolls of J. Edgar I-Ioover..and'
the so-called Un-American Committee.

strike order by the “American Mikado.”

AFL Representative James Killen
resigned in 1948 as chief of the occu-
pation headquarters’ labor division in
Japan. Killencharged that “countless
warrants of arrest" were being circu-
lated under the decree “agains1>\work-
ers who sought to improve their wages
and ‘working conditions.”

The MacArthur decree was issiied in
July, 1948.. It prohibited strikes or col-
lective bargaining ‘ by government
workers, including railroad, ”tobacco,
telephone, telegraph and radio workers.

MacArthur’s financial adviser in Ja-
pan was Joseph M. Dodge, president. of

the Detroit Bank and a director of ‘

Chrysler Corp., which also has hold-
ings in Japan. Dodge was responsible
for an “austerity” program under
which Japanese workers have been the
mai_n saerificers.

Gen. MacArthur’_s— interest in the-

Orient never has been purely military.
He is mvultimillionaire employer and
investor. He is a largestockholder in
Korean investment companies and has
a brewery in the Philippines valuedluzit
between 5 and 10 million dollars. ' He
collected $1,500,000 from the U. S. gov-
ernment for wartime damage to his
Philippine properties, but is not‘ satis-
fied and has put in for $3,000,000.
Hernandez Abaya in “Betrayal in the

Philippines,” reports that before World
War II MacArthur vvas-a~ business as-

‘ sociate of Andres Soriano,.Falangist

landowner and businessman, and still
holds shares in several Soriano mines,
including Acoje Chromite Co. and the
Antamok goldfields.

EXTENT of the'~General’s holdings
in Korea have not been documented,
but it i_s known that his close friend
and advisor-——a man who visited Korea
only a few days before the outbreak of
war last year——is John Foster, Dulles,
who owns a big interest in the New
Korea Co. This former Japanese mo-
nopoly_has assets valued ata billion
and a quarter dollars. ' ~

The New Korean Co. not only owns
most of the industry and half of the
farm lands of South Korea, but has
paper claims to 'rich assets in the
North——assets which become realizable
as United Nations troops move north
of the 38th parallel.

posit in South Korea. Its entire pro-
duction goes to American companies

and gold deposits .in‘Asia. Syngman
Rhee, puppet dictator of South Korea,
has promised rights in all Korean
mines, most of which are in the'North,
to Wall Street’s Oriental Consolidated
Mining Co. The Korean Oil Storage
Co. of New York holds the concession
on all oil going. into Korea, and the
Gilbert Associates ‘of Reading, Penn,

rent from ﬂoating power ships lent by

a [lit Canadian ‘control’ Plan

C‘ Members of a number of Canadian Mine-Mill locals have now
adopted strong resolutions against both a wage freeze and a
price freeze.'Calgary Metal Workers Local 800, at its last mem-
bership meeting, adopted this resolution which follows the pat-
tern of resolutions adopted by other Canadian Mine-Mill locals

A “We "view with great concern the campaign to restrict free
collective bargaining through the institution of wage controls.
7: “A wage freeze, with its resultant loweringof the living
, stahdards of Canadian; ‘workers, is today being insidiously foisted
on theCanadian people under the cloak of price controls. The
headsof the»Congress“ot, Canadian Labor and Trades 6: Labor
Congress,.who today are piously campaigning for controls, do so
knowing full well that the end result would be wage controls, a
loss of L collective bargaining and an impairment of Canadian

“We are aware from our experience of controls in the last
war. and again from the examples of present price and wage
controls in the United States. that our government will not enforce
price controls in the interests of the workers at the expense of
profits. but’ will rigidly. enforce a wage freeze. Price controls today
in the U.$.A. substantiate our position. There. with wages tightly
frozen. prices and profits are still mounting. It is also our experi-
ence and that of every worker that business in the past. with the
full knowledge of our government. has been able to evade price

’“In view of the ‘above, we affirm the following principles:

-1. The leadership of the T.L.C.—C.C;L. who on_ ebruary 20th
assured the government _ of their support for pol1c1es'ot control
_ did so without consulting the membership of organized labor and

2. We warn the workers of Calgary that the campaign of the
C.C.I.. Council to seek support for controls is but a trap to lead
them into wage controls and thereby save face for those C.C.I..

a wage freeze through escalator clauses and two to - five year

MEXICO CITY—-The great hunger
caravan of miners ousted front their
jobs by scab-herding troops is still here
demanding justice from the. govern-
ment.

Two labor leaders who joined the
strikers in demonstrations were jailed.
They-are Augustin Guzman and Lopez-
Malo, both known to leaders and many
members of Mine-Mill for their part in
promoting fraternal relations between
unions in~.the United States and Mex-
ico. '

After ignoring the hunger caravan
for some time, the Mexican government;
appointed a commission to find a for-
mula for ending its demonstrations.
The commission, instead of proposing
restoration of the men’s rightful jobs,
offered to place them on priority lists

This formula, flatly rejecting th
strikers’ basic demand of union recog- -
nition, was turned down by a big ma-
jority in a union meeting. The result-
ing dispute went to a court for investi-"' -
gation. When the strikers held a .dem- .,
onstration before the court-, they were
accused of “insulting'the flag” and-a V
tacked by police. -

THE MINERS defended themselves,

six police were injured, then more po-A N '
lice were called and the crowd dis-'
persed. The strikers then gatheredin A
smaller groups to continue their dem-._ v '
onstrations, and some 20 were arrested
including Guzman and Male. ‘
