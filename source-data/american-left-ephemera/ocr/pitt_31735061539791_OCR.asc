The Southern P

Vol. 16, No 9

The Guilty lines

As the South recoils in horror at
its most recent wave of bombings,
the most timely and appropriate
comment is to quote from an Arkan-
sas Gazette editorial last summer
regarding a previous rash of dyna-
miting:

“We can hope that the h«oo-dlums
who planted the dynamite . . . will be
brought to . . . justice. But what of
those Southern leaders who, while
piously talking of preserving peace,
went on to stir their passions and
incite them to violence?”

Help End Senate Filibusters

Meeting in Nashville in October, the board of the Southern Conference
Educational Fund voted to conduct an intensive campaign to mobilize
Southern support for the amendment of Rule 22 in the U.S. Senate to
limit ﬁlibustering.

This is a part of a nationwide movement to remove this roadblock to
further civil rights legislation.

Several Northern senators are cooperating with the labor movement
T ,,,_

to change Rule 22 when the 85th Congress convenes i uanuary.
SCEF is circulating petitions in support of this move throughout the
South. They will be presented to the Senate in January.
If you would like to help, write for copies of the petition. Address
SCEF, 822 Perdido St., New Orleans, La.

Rule 22 requires a two-thirds vote of the entire Senate to end debate.
It is almost Without precedent in the legislative bodies of the world. Its
purpose is not to protect discussion but to prevent a vote. It defeats the
concept of majority rule.

Because of it, either ﬁlibuster or a threat of a ﬁlibuster has killed
much crucial civil rights legislation in the past. It will do so in the
future. Observers agree that there is little hope for further civil rights
legislation until this rule is changed.

And more civil rights legisla-
tion is urgently needed now. There
is an illusion among many people
of good will that this is not the
case. They say that major prob-
lems will be solved if only the
legislation already on the books is
enforced.

But even disregarding all the

is needed, school desegregation
will ﬂounder unless new laws
are passed.

As was pointed out by Charles

    

Littie in The Na:/wills Termeuean
“Now you listen to me.”

A Who Is Un-American?

Current attacks on the Supreme Court, accompanied by the closing of schools in
Arkansas and Virginia, a.re un.-American and essentially seditious, the SCEF board
said in a resolution adopted at its fall meeting.

The board also voted to “highly commend and vigorously sup~port” the 210
Southern Negro leaders who protested the action of the House Un-American Com-
mittee in harassing white integratio-nists at hearings in Atlanta.

“We regard it as a contradition in terms,” the board said, “to castigate as
un-American people who support the Constitution . . .
differences should be settled peaceably in the cour*t.s.”

Board members voted support to Carl Braden and Frank Wilkinson, who were
cited for contempt following these hearings, and said they would welcome a bona
ﬁde investigation of “such current, widespread. un-American activities as the dyna-
miting of schools, burning of churches and homes and synagogues, restriction of the

Alan Wright, law professor at the

article in Progressive Magazine,
when Title III of the 1957 Civil
Rights Act was discarded, “so too
was any reasonable hope that
school segregation will be ended in
the foreseeable future.”

Title III would have empowered
the U.S. Attorney General to bring

members at the University of Arkansas.

By HOVVARD, CARTER

Faubus was renominated because:

(1) His machine was powerful; most
frequently mentioned are business inter-
ests (one man said that it is to his and
their interests to keep the segregation
issue hot so that no one will notice their
monkey business) and state employees.

(2) The opposition was weak; one
“could only vote against Faubus, not
for the other candidates.

(3) Faubus. was the underdog; many
people believe that Eisenhower really
renominated him.

What is even more disturbing is of
course the package of bills the legisla-
ture handed him after his victory, which
he signed promptly after the Supreme
Court decision. One lobbyist explained it
privately, that they Wanted Faubus to
have all the responsibility.

One who voted for them. also ex-
plained privately that the reason was
a feeling of futility: no one but the
machine has any power. Regrettabuly
too few‘ Negro voters exercise their
franchise. Their votes could make a lot
of diﬁ’erence.

Hopeful signs? The White Citizens
Council ofﬁcial, Amis Guthridge, was
soundly defeated by Brooks Hays (con-
taminated by his conferences with Eisen-
hower). The whole thing is full of para-
doxes. One of my most brilliant students
worked for Faubus this summer, but this
p-erson has been active in pioneering in

”"”‘“‘interracial church work. When they tell
me I just don’t understand, I have to
agree. . .

At the Faculty Christian Fellowship
conference in August I met people from
every Southern state, and I didn’t hear
a kind word about Faubus. . .

Listen, Faubus!

North Ca.rolina Attorney General
Malcolm Seawell recently told an au-
dience in Greensboro: “I intend to
ta.ke my stand on the side of the law
regardless of political consequence . . .
It is unthinkable to me that any peo-
ple possessed of their senses» would
say, in elfect, we will close our schools
and let our children grow up in
ignorance.”

Or were other factors also in operation?

By JOHN MCKENNEY

Why did the opposition to Governor
Faubus’ bid for a third term fail so
miserably?

It must be realized that Arkansas
politics have always been personality
centered.

Faublus stood., and still stands, as a
personal symbol of the beleagured
Arkans~.a.wyer’s attempt to defend his
backward‘ culture against the inroads
of “outside” interference.

The use of federal troops at Little
Rock was a sign of the outside forces
trying to crack the defensive shell of a
people who feel inferior and are quite
sensitive about the actual and ﬁctional
elements involved in the picture of Ark-
ansawyers as hill-folks, without shoes or
book-learning.

Judge Lee Ward’s campaign speech at
Huntsville, the Governor’s hometown,
was directed speciﬁcally towards telling
the people not to feel inferior and
ashamed, but to be proud of the tremen-
dous strides that Arkansas has made in
recent decades. And these are real ad-
vances as any fair observer must admit.

But the fact that Ward aimed his
talk in this direction conﬁrms the fact
that the Governor stood as a symbol
of strength defending the people from
attacks from without. The fact that
some of these external threats were
well warranted made the psychological
mechanism of a protective father-gov-
ernor no less effective in winning votes
for the Governor.

In addition to the above factor, there
were unconﬁrmed reports of vote-‘
throwing on a pretty large scale. One
observer estimated that this probably
added 50,000 to the Governor’s majority.

THE DEFIANT ONES, a United Art-
ists picture which will be playing in a
number of Southern cities this winter.
It’s the gripping story of two convicts,
one Negro and one white (Sidney Potier
and Tony Curtis), who escape from a
Southern chain gang. Hating each other
violently at the outset, they are bound
together by four feet of chain and a
common plight. In the course of their
ﬂight from a posse, they learn the mean-
ing of “brotherhood under the skin.”

able in 16 mm to schools, civic groups,
etc., and in 35 mm to commercial‘ thea-
ters. It is a documentary, telling the
history of the ﬁrst 25 years of the
Tennessee Valley Auth0‘rity’s. resource
development program. For bookings,

Sp-rankle Building, Knoxville, Tenn.

An interesting observation that might
conﬁrm the above comment is that
roughly speaking the Governor won in
the Delta counties of the state by 5 to 7,
to 1 over Judge Ward. Yet in the Su-

, preme Court race held during the second

primary, arch segregationist and Citi-
zens Council friend Jim Johnson won
over his opponent, the incumbent, by
only a majority of 21/2 to 3, to 1.

The gubernatorial election was not
fought solely on a narrowly-deﬁned
segregation issue. If it had been, it
would seem that J ohn-s:on’s vote record
would have outrun Faubus’ vote
against Ward, the latter also an
avowed segregationist, albeit a. man
who promised to respect the law.

Of course, Wagon-load voting in the -

plantation region played its part. Until
the plantation Negroes are free from
pressure and can vote their own tickets,
this evil will continue. But how can they
get free?

The Quiet Violence,

the Unsung Heroes

Bombings of schools and temples are the publicized violence, but no less terrible
are the smaller acts of violence and harassment perpetrated quietly and repeatedly
today in the South against the unsung heroes in the struggle for equality.

Don West, beloved Southern poet, was called to appear in Atlanta last July when
the House Un-American Committee made its attack on Southern integrationists.

Since the publicity surrounding that event, the dam on the ﬁsh lake on West’s
Dou-glasville, Ga., farm has been dynamited out; seven of his registered Blac-k
Angus cows have been poisoned, and all of his registered Yorkshire hogs—-35 all

told—have been stolen.

This all came at a time when personal tragedy also struck West in the form of an
automobile accident that almost took the life of his wife.

The Patriot’s bouquet this month goes
to the Southern church and synagogue
leaders who are braving the ire of
politicians and sometimes their congre-
gations to speak out for human brother-
hood.

As citizens of Virginia and Arkansas
faced the startling reality of communi-
ties without public schools, these reli-
gious voices were among the clearest
in the region.

Churches were far from united on the
issue; some were tragically divided. But
individual religious leaders were playing
a prophetic role.

>l< * * *

Rabbi Emmet Frank, in a Yom Kippur
sermon at Alexandria, Va., severely criti-
cized Senator Harry Byrd and the policy
of “massive resistance” and said the
“madness” of the segregationists was
“Godlessness.”

Immediately, there was a blistering
attack on Rabbi Frank from segregation-
ist groups. Eleven Protestant cle-rgymen
in Alexandria and a Washington Rabbi
came to his defense.

* * * *

In Front Royal, Va., 13 white ministers
issued a statement urging that public
schools be kept open. Referring to the
use of church buildings for private all-
white schools, they said “we could not
countenance the use of the Church of
Jesus Christ as a means of evading
federal law and continuing a pattern of
life which opposes the very nature of
the Church as a Body of Christ.”

* * >l< >l<

The Rev. P'aul Stagg, First Baptist
Church, in Front Royal, Va., publicly
dissociated himself from the action of his
congregation in voting 101 to 43 to
allow its church building to be used for
private segregated classes. He said the
action would “sanction segregation in
the name of God and bless a pattern
of life which the church . . . regards as
contrary to the Bible . . .”

Under the leadership‘ of Presbyterian
Minister William B. Abbot and his wife,
a group of Norfolk citizens obtained
almost 2,000 signatures on a p-ledge com-
mitting signers to “nonviolent means to
insure a peaceable transition to desegre-
gated education” and placed a full-page
ad in the daily newspaper. (See October

The Rev. James C. Brewer, Unitarian
minister, led another group in Norfolk

The Rev. Peter R. Doyle, of Roanoke,
Va., issued a public statement challeng-
ing an Episcopal vestryman who had
said that “integration of theraces is
not a matter of doctrine.” Doyle said:
“The Word -of God is clear on this matter
of race worship. . . To segregate a.nd
degrade a Christian is to segregate and
degrade Christ who dwells in that
Christian.”

A group; of 43 Protestant ministers
and ﬁve Roman Catholic priests repre-
senting all the major churches in the
Falls Church, Va., area issued a state-
ment that “enforced segregation in our
schools on the basis of race is contrary
to the will of God.”

In Knoxville, Tenn., the Presbyterian
Ministers Association called on “respon-
sible Christian citizens” to support
school integration.

Baltimore Sets
Vote Record

A record-breaking voter registration
drive to bring Baltimore’s Negro voters
to 100,000 went over the top, this fall,
with 101,771 registered. Negro voters
now represent 24 per cent of the city’s
total.

The drive started last April. A total
of 16,215 new voters have been added
since December, 1957. The NAACP
sparked the drive, with ministers, a
woman’s volunteer group and other
organizations joining in. On one single
day, 1,582 persons registered.

Commented the Afro-American: “Go-

ing from house to house, ringing d.oor- 

bells . . . hasn’t ever been characterized
heretofore as fun. . . But for voulnteers
with no other goal in mind than to
perform a public service, it was exceed-
ingly pleasant. . .”

both endorsed statements supporting
integration and pledging “to translate
Christian and democratic ideals into
reality.” This grew out of the efforts of
Negro young people to break down dis-
crimination in public eating places. (See
October P‘atriot.)

And as Virginia politicians were pre-
dicting dire results ‘if the races‘ were
mixed in schools, it was reported that
the state’s Catholic parochial schools
were beginning their ﬁfth year of peace-
ful integration with about 27,000 pupils
attending integrated schools.

How Not To Win

 

All Georgia gubernatorial candidates
were segregationists this year, but one
of them, Bill Bodenhamer, built much of

. his campaign on a promise to run Koin-
onia, Georgia’s color-blind farm, out of
the state.

He said the people of Georgia would
go to the polls and “in unmistakable

Ir----*~~  *1-a‘nguagewill tell the world that the likes
of Koinonia have no place in Georgia.”
The people of Georgia went to the
polls and told the world they wanted no
part of Bodenhamer; he carried only
three counties; and Sumter, where Koin-
onia ‘is located, was not one of them.

the Fourteenth Amendment. As it is, such enforcement is left up to in-
dividual citizens and such organizations as the NAACP.

Wright says: “It is virtually unprecedented to leave enforcement of
the law of the land exclusively to private lawsuits . . . These lawsuits are
extremely expensive, and the funds which the NAACP is able to raise
by private contribution are a pittance compared to what Southern legis-
latures are willing to appropriate from otherwise-impoverished state
treasuries for the cause of preserving segregation . . . The Federal Gov-

ernment alone has the money and the legal manpower and the patience

and the power to force recalcitrant states to obey the law . . . .”
Laws alone will never solve the problems that face the South today.
But laws are essential to provide the framework within which they can
be solved. As Harold Berman, a Harvard professor, recently said:
“. . . . the law should help create conditions under which virtue and
brotherhood may ﬂourish.”
We need such law in the United States today. And the ﬁrst step-
the essential step—is a change in U.S. Senate Rule 22.
