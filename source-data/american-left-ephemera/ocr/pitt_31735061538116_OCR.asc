Boss Class Is Active

The boss class knows the value of these laws.
The textile mill owners’ press in North Caro-
lina has opened a propaganda campaign for
the passage of an anti—sedition law by the next
state legislature, based on the “California
model.” This is in addition to its Civil War in-
surrection law under which it placed six tex-
tile strikers on trial at Marion in September,
1929. Fearing this legal lynching would not
operate fast enough deputy sheriffs under the
infamous Slheriff Adkins massacred in cold
blood six strike pickets and wounded more than
a score on the streets. of Marion, October 7,
1929.

Ex-army officers in the DuPont Powder
Trust state of Delaware, organized in the Du-
Pont Chapter, No. 78, National Sojourners, all
members of. the Masonic fraternity, call for
similar legislation against the workers in that
state. These are merely symptoms of the grow-
ing repression, echoed in congress by the plan
to enact a federal criminal syndicalist law, and
thus organize this phase of the war against la-
bor directly under the leadership of the nation- _
al government. '

Face 1,105 Prison Years

One hundred and thirteen workers are today

eleven centuries of time, as a result of the
American employing class effort to halt the
class struggle march of labor in this country
through the persecutions that it develops under
the anti-labor campaign launched with the use
of these laws. '

The increasing attacks of the employers and
their government now deﬁnitely develops into a
vicious nation-wide onslaught with the clearly
intended object of seeking to crush all labor’s
class struggle organizations and thus paralyze
the resistance and gag the discontent of the
Whole Working class. Thus the master class
seeks to outlaw the growing radicalization of
the working class, to stifle the demands of
the jobless, to mask its war preparations and
hostile maneuvers against the Soviet Union.

Labor Faces Big Tasks

This situation confronts the whole working
class with new, tremendous tasks as clearly
outlined in the decisions of the Fourth Na-
tional Convention at Pittsburgh of the Inter-
national‘ Labor Defense. .

The arrest of M. H. Powers and Joseph Carr,
organizers of the Communist Party and the

charge of attempting to incite insurrection,
which carries with it the penalty of death in

~ the electricchair, takes place on the first anni-

versary of Gastonia strikers’ heroic struggle.

New Wave of Lynchings

The issues involved in the Atlanta and Gas-
tonia persecutions, which is the attack on the
workers of the South carried on by the employ-
ing class under the leadership of millionaire
textile mill owners, now face the workers
nationally in an ever-sharper form as a result
of this developing and desperate Wave of the
ruling’ class attack, which is buttressed by
mass deportations, as one phase of the growing

attack on foreign-born Workers; wholesale ar- -

rests on minor charges as the result of the most
elemental activities of Workers (5,905 arrests
in the two-year period, 1928-1929; 3,711 ar-

_rests during the ﬁrst four months of 1930);

murderous police attacks on workers meetings,
picket lines and demonstrations (the shooting
down of Ella May, Steve Katovis, Gino Maz-
zola,. and others, including’ workers in the
strikes of textile workers in Philadelphia, taxi-
cab drivers in Pittsburgh, and street carmen
in New Orleans.) ,
This period Witnesses a rising wave of most
ﬁendish brutality in the lynching of both Ne-
gro and White Workers. Lynching is a class
weapon, , of the capitalist class against the

Working class. This is seen in the Whole list
of recent mob murders of Clarence Hughes,
John H. Wilkins, Chester Fugate, Willie Mc-
Daniels, Joe Boxley, Dave Harris, Allen Green,
Laura Wood, Jimmie Levine, John Hodaz, Ne-
gro and White workers and farmers. Southern
soil is stained red with the life blood of the
Working class.

The Warning of the I. L. D.

The International Labor Defense has con-
tinually pointed out that the victory of the
textile barons in North Carolina’s courts in
securing a guilty verdict and the sentencing of
7 strikers and organizers to 117 years impris-
onment, would be immediately echoed in the
nation-Wide attack of the employing class, es-
pecially in the basic industries.

The sentencing of the seven Gastonia strik-
ers and organizers to 117 years imprisonment
was a major defeat for the whole American
working class. Since these sentences impos-
ing a living death on the convicted textile
Workers were pronounced (October 21, 1929)
in North Carolina the employing class has
advanced on numerous fronts (Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, California, New Jer-
sey, New York) With the criminal syndicalist
laws as the chief Weapon of the attack.

Attack by Steel Profiteers

From the ‘steel area of Woo-dlawn, Pa., a
stronghold of the infamous Jones and Laughlin
Steel Corp., the American Bridge Co. and other
rapacious interests, the three workers, Muselin,
Resetar and Zima have been sent to prison for
ﬁve-year terms. One week after the Gastonia
sentences (October 28, 1929) the United States
Supreme Court presided over by William How-

ard Taft, cynically refused to even consider

their appeal. One month later, November 28,
the same Supreme Court again refused to
review the case and the three workers were
caged away in the worst prison hell-hole of

’ Western Pennsylvania. Brutal and bloody

“Jones and Laugh1in” tyranny still rules at
Woodlawn, profi‘ting by the security that the
Manville-Jenckes Corporation enforces as its
own at Gastonia, North Carolina.

Three days after the Gastonia verdict and
sentence, the trial, conviction and sentence to
as high as ten years’ imprisonment, of the ﬁve
women, including Yetta Stromberg, arrested
at the Yucaipa, California, Chi1dren’s Camp
were rushed through to their inevitable conclu-
sion. “Open Shop” Los Angeles had scored
another “triumph.” The Los Angeles Cham-
ber of Commerce and its poisonous anti-labor
trnouthpiece, The Times, claimed another “vic-

ory.” ‘

  

18 SEDITION---T0 PROTEST AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT

Mass trials not only for criminal syndical-
ism, but also for treason, carrying the death
penalty are threatened bylCalifornia lynch law
justices as the result of arrests of 87 members
of the Agricultural Workers’ Industrial League,
originally held under $40,000 bail each. This
extreme persecution grows out_ of the attacks
on the organization efforts of the agricultural
Workers in the Imperial Valley.

Many Arrests in Chicago

The Gastonia persecution ushered in the
campaign launched against the Communist
Party in Chicago; with the arrest of eight of
its leading officials on sedition charges and
imprisonment on extreme -bail. This eﬁort to
outlaw the Communist Party in the Chicago
District of heavy industry was bulwarked by 26
additional warrants for the arrest of other ac-
tive militant Workers on sedition charges.

The Gastonia verdict Was the signal for the
capitalist state ofﬁcialdom in Michigan to re-
fuse to make any move for the dismissal of _the
seven-year-old sedition cases growing out of
the arrests (August 21, 1922) of numerous
delegates, including Foster, Minor and many
others, attending the Communist Party con-
vention at Bridgeman, resulting in the indict-
ment of 75 individuals. The court still holds
the $7,500 bail provided for C. E. Ruthenberg,
although he has been dead for over three

years. Ruthenberg was under a 10-year pri-
son sentence when he died. Thus the court

"seeks its revenge. These seven-year-old

    

charges may be brought into court for trial at
any moment.

The same anti-sedition law is again being ,

used in Michigan to send Workers to prison
for long terms. It is the Weapon of the auto-
mobile proﬁteers against the rising discontent
of the slaves of their assembly lines as in the
arrest of Fred Beal, Gastonia defendant, in the
General Motors citadel, Pontiac.

“Guilty!” in Five Minutes
One month after the Gastonia verdict the
prosecutors doing the bidding of steel mill and
coal mine owners of Belmont County, Ohio,
were ready to go through the farce of a trial
that resulted in theconviction and sentence to

Andrews, Cleveland District Organizer of the
Young Communist League. The stacked jury
“deliberated” ﬁve minutes before bringing in

this lynch-law verdict. The “crime” - had_

consisted of distributing leaflets and speaking
at the mill gates. Betty Gannett and Zorka
Yoki were sentenced to 10 years prison sen-
tences, also in Ohio. ,

In Newark, New Jersey, nine workers were
arrested when police raided the local head-
quarters of the Communist Party, where an
unemployed meeting was in ’progress. They
are all charged with sedition. One of them is
the Negro worker, Dozier Graham, nominated
as the Communist candidate for United States
Senator. Dominick Flaiani has already been
found guilty of “S-edition” by a businessm-en’s
jury and he may. be sentenced to 17 years in
prison!

, Election Activities Attacked

Sedition cases are pending in Philadelphia
against workers, some of whom are merely
charged with distributing “Vote Communist”
leaﬂets in the election campaign. The worker,
Lazar, the second week after the Gastonia
verdict, was arrested while speaking at an open
air meeting on the eve of the November elec-
tion, and charged with sedition.

poration, that was exposed as leading in the
propaganda campaign for more and larger
battleships, the Workers, Murdoch, Burlak and
Brown, after facing sedition charges for sever-
al months, were finally released after a. most
bitter struggle by Workers massed in protest
under "the militant leadership of the Interna-
tional Labor Defense.

In the -great industrial area centered about
Chester, Pennsylvania, including a Ford Auto
Plant, the Workers, Ray Peltz and Thomas

_ Holmes, charged with sedition for distributing

leaflet to the unemployed at the Viscose Tex-
tile Mills, are rushed through a farcical trial,
convicted and face ten year sentences," being
held in prison Without bail pending appeal.

In the Farrell, Pennsylvania, steel district
sedition charges still stand against the Work-
ers Kovacovich, Radas, Marich and Sarich.

The Italian Worker, G‘-uido Serio, was seized
While speaking at a meeting at »Erie, Pa.,
charged With sedition and held under $25,000

The I. L. D. was successful in temporarily
repelling these attacks in the anthracite coal

vania, and in the copper mining regions of
Northern Michigan.

against the militant unions as the ﬁrst step to-
wards the attempt to entirely outlaw the Com-
munists; in Austria by the fascist constitution
of police chief Schoeber, now prime minister
by the help of the social-democrats; in France
by Tardieu’s court attack against 154 lead-
ers of the Communist Party under the law of
the year 1832 which is used to fix the crime of
conspiracy against the state.

Apply Gag in Parliament

While in Europe the Communist parliament-
ary fractions are being gagged more than ever,
in the United States it becomes increasingly
difficult for revolutionary workers to function
in electoral campaigns (Communist candidates
barred from the ballots, Negro workers dis-
franchised, naturalization of foreign-born
workers made extremely difficult, large num-
bers of native whites in many states facing
property qualifications, used to rob them 0
their ballot right, etc.). '

It is the extra-legal expressions of fascist
suppression of labor (often combining with the
social fascists), such as the American Legion,
the Ku. Klux Klan, etc., etc., which organize
their campaigns for the carrying out of the
sedition‘ (criminal syndicalism) laws to the
limit, aiding in the arrests, raids on workers’
headquarters and their complete destruction,

(Gastonia, Pontiac, California, Chicago, At-
lanta.)

Role of Social Fascists

Exactly in these situations fascists and social
fascists (the American Federation of Labor,
the Socialist Party, and the Musteites, etc.),
appear as the champions of “laW and order,”
especially voicing their opposition to the street
demonstrations of the unemployed (Pontiac,

- Michigan), While in Milwaukke, Wisc., with its

socialist mayor the police are also used to sav-
agely club the demonstration of the jobless. In
California, where the criminal syndicalist law
has been used most extensively against the
workers, the Socialists openly appear with the
Russian counter-revolutionary, Chernov, re-
senting the bitter hatred voiced by the Workers
against this enemy of the First Workers
Republic.

Symptoms of Capitalism’s Weakness

i This alliance of fascist and social-fascist ele-
ments with the employers and their govern-
ment, is a sign of the growing Weakness, not

bor Defense must defend the struggles of revo-
lutionary organizations to continuously func-
tion in this period; to defend the right to_the
continuous publication and Wide distribution
of labor’s militant press under all conditions.
The repeated onslaughts against labor under
cover of these sedition laws has not been con-
sidered seriously enough and as a. result the
forces of the Working class have not been mob-
ilized suﬂiciently and effectively to resist them.

The “Assembling with” Charge

The steel, auto, coal, textile barons, through
their courts and prosecutors in seeking victims
among the militant Workers in the mills, fac-
tories and. mines that they control, are not

, called on to prove that Workers have urged any

    

violation of law. It is not necessary to prove
membershipin any proscribed organization. In
the Michigan case the mere fact that militant
Workers Were “assembling With” each other be-
came sufficient basis for the sedition charges
and the imposition of the ten-year sentence on
Ruthenberg. This case has never been dropped.
It still stands in the court docket at St. Joseph,
Michigan.

Here is a new method of legal oppression,
carrying extreme penalties, that has been de-
clared “constitutional” by the United States
Supreme.Court. The period of the court strug-
gle against these viciously anti-labor laws, seek-
ing to declare them unconstitutional, is defin-
itely ended.

 

SEDITION—T0 PROTEST AGAINST HUNGER 29

Workers Must Mobilize
Mass protest by ever broader sections of the

Working class must be exerted to cripple and

defeat the growing drive to jam the prisons
with the most militant ﬁghters of the working
class doomed to long terms of years in capital-
ism’s bastilles. '
While the International Labor Defense or-'
ganizes the struggle in support of Workers

' seized and dragged into court under these anti-

labor, open shop laws, it greets the national
campaign inaugurated by the Communist Par-
ty for the repeal of the various criminal syn-
dicalist, and Civil War insurrection sedition
laws. It will join the United Front organized
to create mass agitation for the repeal of these

I laws that are not only directed against the ~

Communist Party, but are Weapons of the rul-
ing class oppression directed against the work-
ing class as a Whole.

Organize Mass Pressure

Where these laws exist, but Where there is no
initiative and referendum as a means of ﬁght-
ing them, the mass movement for their repeal
must take other forms, which must be utilized
everywhere, such as mass resolutions, mass
campaigns of working class organizations and
other means. The major aim must be to mobil-
ize the largest possible masses of workers
against the laws.

To Protest and Organize Against Hunger, War
and Unemployment

By J. LOUIS ENGDAHL
General Secretary, International Labor Defense

UNEMPLOYMENT, hunger, slow death by
starvation——this is the lot of the Working

class in the so-called “prosperous.” United

States of America.

No Worker is safe from the misery and ‘agony

o-f “hard times.” The holder of a job may be

” among the jobless tomorrow. The employed

Worker may at any time see his Wages slashed,
his Workday lengthened, While at the same time
the cost of living increases, thus undermining
his standard of living.

To Protest Is “Sedition”!

The capitalists make their hypocritical
claims about “returning prosperity” at the very
moment that the police in many cities are
breaking up with brutal and bloody attacks the
jobless demonstrations before city halls; While
the so-called “War emergency” laws are being
used to rush Workers to long terms of impris-
onment.

New State of Emergency
It is precisely in the present growing radical-
ization of the oppressed masses; the rapidly in-
tensifying mass unemployment and the speed-
ing of war preparations accompanied with the
new aggressions against the Soviet Union that

these “emergency” laws” are again being re- ’

vived.

The struggle against these laws, therefore,
becomes a definite part of the anti-war cam-
paign, the defense of the Soviet Union, the or-
ganization and the support of the jobless and
intensiﬁed activity in the shops and factories
for the organization of the unorganized.

Resist This Attack

Defeat the attack of the employers and their
government carried out under the criminal syn-
dicalist, sedition, and Civil War insurrection
laws! Support the fight of the Communist
Party for the right of its legal existence.

Unite in the movement for the repeal of these
laws! Organize mass protests!

Defeat the ‘efforts to outlaw the class strug-
gle organizations of the American working
class, the Communist Party, the new industrial
unions, the Trade Union Unity League, the In-
ternational Labor Defense, etc., which is the
forerunner of more intensive attacks on the
whole working class.

Defend the workers in their struggles to de-

4 SEDITION—T0 PROTEST AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT

“Sedition !” is the cry raised by the boss class
in reply to the slightest protest voiced by
awakening labor against the policy of the ex-
ploiters to meet the sharpening crisis which
they try to deny in words, but which in deeds

they admit and try to transfer its burdens onto

the shoulders of the toiling masses.

To Outlaw the Struggles of Labor

“Sedition!” has been written into the statute
books of 35 states in so-called criminal syndi-
calism laws enacted in the United States that
saw labor grow". restless during the period of the
world war and the Bolshevik Revolution in
Russia. These laws are being wheeled into ac-
tion today to help bulwark the weakening capi-
talist structure by putting workers in steel
prison cages for many years, by seeking to
outlaw the class struggle organizations of the
militant and revolutionary workers.

In the South many states have insurrection
laws put in the statute books by the Southern
slave-holding aristocracy in the Civil War
period 1861-65, at ﬁrst directed against Negro
slaves but now used to hold both Negro and

\ white workers in the chains of wage slavery.

But these laws do not stand alone. They are
a part of capitalist class justice that mobilizes
tear gas, machine guns, so-called riot wagons,
hordes of mounted and foot police against the
March Sixth fighters for “Work or Wages!”

6 SEDI'r1oN—To PROTEST AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT"

against International May Day demonstrations,
against all labor’s mass protests. "

\ Laws Far-Reaching

These sedition laws can be turned into sharp
weapons of attack against any class activity
of labor, against workers “assembling wit ”
each other; against “spoken or written words
(no matter in What form) or personal conduc ”
which can be interpreted as advocating crim-
inal syndicalism, or sabotage, or “unlawful
methods of terorrism as a means of accomplish-
ing a change in industrial ownership or con-
trol, or affecting any political change.”

Under this law the lumber barons and ship-
ping interests of the Paciﬁc Coast, the steel
mill owners, coal proﬁteers, automobile and
rubber multi-millionaires, in fact, all the kais-
ers of industry everywhere can ﬁnd the basis
for furious Wars of attempted extermination
against militant workers.

It is clear that the ﬁrst master class move, in
its attempt to paralyze the Working class, is
to illegalize the Communist Pa.rty. The Com-
munist Party is the most active and feared sec-
tion of the Working class. All workers must
support it in its ﬁght for the right of its legal
existence. Workers realize that no measure of
persecution will prevent the Communist Party
from doing its duty as the leader and’ the or-
ganizer of the Working class.

SEDITION—TO PROTEST AGAINST HUNGER 7

French Revolution Feared

Workers have waged bitter struggles for
their rights in this country under the present
capitalist government from its very beginning.
Rhode Island and North Carolina refused to
ratify the original federal constitution on any
terms because it did not contain the so-called
civil liberties’ safeguards that were later in-
jected in the bill of rights, butwere never any-
thing more than dead letters in the capitalist
government’s basic law.

Alien and sedition laws were enacted by con-
gress in 1798 in the effort to gag the outbursts
of sympathy with and thus counteract the in-
fluence of the French Revolution. There Were
numerous arrests, convictions and imprison-
ments. So great grew the protest, however,
that when Thomas Jefferson became president
in 1801 all those convicted were pardoned-r and
ﬁnes imposed were remitted. Even damages
in huge sums were collected from the govern-
ment.

New York Led Attack

While numerous methods have been utilized
by the employing class during the intervening
130 years, to strangle every effort of the work-
ing class to rise off its knees, actual laws pen-
alizing utterances were not passed until the
ruling class in New York State exploited the
hysteria_incidental to the shooting of President

 

   
 

    

  

8 SEDITION—-TO PROTEST AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT

McKinley by an anarchist in 1901, to pass the
so-called criminal anarchy law that Was used
in the War years against Workers’ revolution-
ary activities, that was ‘upheld by the United
States Supreme Court and b-ecame the model
for a.nti-sedition laws in the various states.

The federal congress, however, did not open-
ly attack civil liberties until it enacted the
vicious Wartime Espionage Act of June, 1917,
under which- there we-re some 2,000 prosecu-
tions, sentences as high as twenty years’ im-
prisonment being imposed on many workers.
Numerous state governments imitated the fed-
eral tyranny by enacting laws of their own,
some of them even more drastic in the post-
War period, which was the period of the organ-
ization of the Communist International, the
consolidation of the Bolshevik triumph in the
Soviet Union, and the far-reaching economic
crisis in the United States (1920-22), accom-
panied by (hard-fought strikes of steel and rail-
road workers, coal miners, as well as labor fac-

ing deflation in other industries.

1 The extremes to which these laws went were-
clearly seen in the law passed in Connecticut
against the “forbidden doctrine.” '

 

SEDITION—-—T0 PROTEST AGAINST HUNGER. 9

This law declares:

"No person shall in public, or before any as‘-
semblage of ten or more persons, advocate in
any language any measure, doctrine, proposal
or propaganda intended to iniuriously affect the
government of the United States or the State
of Connecticut.”

Under these criminal syndicalism laws it has
become "seditious, according to arrests and
prosecutions in some states, even to read the
bill of rights of the federal constitution at an
open meeting.

First Attack Against Communists

The ﬁrst group of Communist cases under
the criminal syndicalism laws grew out of the
organization of the Communist Partiesin 1919
in California, Illinois and New York. Eleven
were put on trial in California and three con-
victed. Eighteen Were tried and convicted in
Illinois and served part of their terms. Even

the capitalist judge in Illinois, fearing for the’

discontent that would be aroused among the
Workers by the extreme persecutions under
these laws, declared:

“The law (criminal syndicalism) of this
state is so drastic and far-reaching in its pro-
visions that any public utterance of the great
leaders in our past history would have been
punishable under its provisions.”
