Preparations are already being made throughout the EFL in California for the 45th
annual convention of the State Federation of Labor to be held in San Diego this
summer.

It is important to examine issues relating to the convention, not only because the
State Federation is a vital force in California, but also because of two other con-
ventions to be held in San Francisco later on.

These will be the conventions of the Teamsters, to begin August 11, and of the AFL
itself, to be held in September or October.

The California State Federation of Labor is one of the major units of the whole
AFL. Therefore, the tone and policies of the coming state convention will be im-
portant in determining the general line of the national convention.

The movement of thﬂ rank and file now developing throughout the state can, with
correct leadership, crystallize a progressive program at the state convention.

Developments and changes within the State Federation during the last year are
symbolized most clearly in the career of its president, Charles Real of Teamsters
Local 70 in Alameda county. '

The Case of Charles Real

Last year Real was elected president on the crest of a reactionary wave thdzdomn
inatsd the convention. He represented backward forces in the Teamster groups,
which have for many years dominated internal policies of the State Federation in
close alliance with AFL maritime union leaders.

     
  
    
    
   
 

Today, after almost a year of Federation policies put into effect by President
Real and Secretary 0. J. Haggerty, Real has been given a shaking up the like of
which he never before experienced.

He is all but completely isolated in his own Alameda county, where the Central
gabor Counbil and the Building Trades Council have officially labelled his act-
ions as those of a 'strikebreaker and tool of the employers" and have rejected
his policies completely. -‘ ’ ‘-7’ 7

The AFL in.Alameda county is now developing unity with all labor in.a fight against
anti-labor legislation and against the Warren~Knowland machines Whazcan be done
through such unity was demonstrated most clearly this week when the laboruendorsed
Oakland Voters League candidates led the Warrennxncwland machine men in all five
races for the city council, despite everything Real could do. In the runoff
elections May 13, the labor-endorsed ccuncilmen can be swept into office."

Now these same State Federation leaders are hopping around trying to hold back the
flood of anti—labor legislation proposed by these same Republican reactionaries --

the flood the State Federation leaders themselves helped to bring about.

Having sown the seeds of their own destruction, the national and state leadership
of the AFL are now on bended knee before their masters, trying to get off the hooko

They find it hard to conceal any longer the real aim of their masters, reactionary ’ 1%
Republicans and Democrats, who want to behead the labor movement.

SLOGAN FORTTHE STATE AFL: FOLLOW ALAMEDA COUNTY!

At the convention this year, it will be of tremendous value to demand of the State II
Federation leadership a full accounting of their role in helping to bring on the
anti-labor drive. . vi

Last year's convention called for a fight against the CIO. But that fight back— V
fired and went into reverse. e‘W

 

Following the convention, Haggerty and Harry Lundeberg of the Sailors spoke at big
mass meetings to drum up "war against the CIO".

In Los Angeles, the AFL was wuickly confronted with more important problems, the
anti—labor drive of big business, and the "war against the CIO" vanished into vapor.

In Alameda county, the AFL general strike, suported by the CIO, blew the "war
against the CIO" into bits. Today, the AFL in that area works closely with the
CIO against anti-labor legislation and to clean the Warren—Kncwland machine out
of city government.

 

In San Francisco, the infamous "Organizational-Strategy Committee" was organized
to.fight the CIO. It has continued to exist, with the aid of blood transfusions y
and artificial respiration. 9 did

 

Change in Policy

According to‘ the o-s Committee's last report, it has $45,000 in the kitty with 
less than 40 percent of the unions having contributed. ’

Its, director, Joe Roberts, is presently splitting a gut trying to find a spot to
pick a fight with the CIO. But there is so little to do in that regard that the

0~S Committee has changed to a policy of "fighting the Communists." And even thatd
does not provide a decent job of eight hours‘ work for a staff of four at $100 a
week apiece.

Actually, the rank and file in San Francisco has spoken up in many ways on the
0-8 Committee.

Thus, the rank and file has rejected decisively every major policy decision of
last_year's State Federation convention. This is the bais upon which a new policy
of action must be worked out at the coming 1947 convention.

 

Leadership Needed

But unorganized resistance to bad policy will not be enough for the future. What
is needed is leadership and direction. This places on all progressives within
the AFL the task of speaking up and taking leadership.

In the past, this has been made artifically difficult because of a myth built up
around the dominant role of the Teamster leadership.

For years, local union officers have been scared to follow an independent policy
because of the so—called ghreat that the Teamster officialdom would retaliate.

-4. g
This single reason, as much as any other factor, is important in eva1uating:the ‘~
behavior of many local leaders who have ideas different from those of Dave Beck

and his type.

If the Alameda county generﬂ.strike and the Los Angeles Retai1_C1erks strike did
anything at all, they destroyed this myth once and for all. In both cases, Dave
_Beck and his underlings tried to strikebreak.' In both cases, they couldnlt get
~away with it. In both cases, they had their hair curled by the heat from an angry
rank.and file. ‘ '

If local unions and honest and progressive-thinking local leaders will reach the
.oonolusion that the day of Teamster officials‘ domination is over, they will have
climbed over one of the biggest single obstacles in the way of a militant State

{Federation program. ‘ .

Fading Strength

The former position of domination by Teamster officials has been weakened by two
important reasons;

First, because the Teamsters rank and fkle is learning rapidly of the true policies
of Book and Real and others like them, learning that these policies are Just as
dangerous for truck drivers as they are for the rest of labor.

Second, because the rest of the AFL has grown so much that past relationships have
been changed. Even-the Teamster officials recognize this and are busy organizing
another "District 50" with every worker they can bag outside their own Jurisdiction.

During the last year, the groundworb has been laid for a sharp change in AFL po1— »
icieso The coming state convention may well see further evidence of a strong
break in the Lundeberg—Beck—Real axis, which has run the State Federationg

It can ahnost be stated as an aniom that the minute this axis is broken will be
the starting point for a completely new alignment of forces within the State Fed-
‘eration, and the beginning of a progressive, militant program.

The situation in Alameda county is the most direct ccnfirmadon of this point. The
moment Charles Real was isolated marked the beginning of a new progressive trend
in the whole AFL. That can be repeated in other areas and in the State Federation
as a whcleo

In order to lay the basis for such a change at the coming convention, two questions
must be answeredo

The first question is that of leadership. What is required is that all forces that
wish to fight an honest battle for labor must come out fighting at the state con-
ventions To lay aside petty differences, to pass over all the piddling little
triflus within the various councils, to achieve unity on a progressive program -
this is the demand of the hour.

AFL leaders in Alameda county have shown how it can be done.

Fighting Program

, he second question is that of a program that can swing almost every AIL member in—
action. Such a program must include at a minimum the followhg issuesg,

A

_"1 _ ‘_ __r ________v__ r —4--—— .._.... ....-d... -

la. Decent wages and conditions on the_job, a fight against speedup and againsL.«/’/

breaking down of conditions. »_//,
2s Full financial and organizational resources of the State Federation to be used

in the fight against anti—labor legislation, against anti-labor injunctions, agahst

use of the courts as strikebreaking instruments.

3. Unity with all sections of labor and the people against reactionary political
forces, leading to a third party on a state and national scale.

4. An all-out fight for rent control, and for decent housing.

5. A fight against the reactionary drive to whittle down and emasculate education
in the state and nation. - . ‘

6. Support to the policy of Big Three Unity and the United Nations, against the,
reactionary foreign policy of Truman and the Republican majority in Congresso

.and‘councils

$51

75 A fight against red-baiting and stifling of rank and file democracy within
the labor movement.

83 Integration of Negroes and other members of minority groups as full memebers
of all local unions.
9; Full support to veterans‘ demands for housing and legislation.

Such a program must be based on recognition that red-baiting and witch-hunting
will weaken unions, will help only the employers.

Good Examples

The recent example of the San Francisco Labor Council is a case in point. The
men who forced through an "anti-red" resolution were the same people who are

busy sabotaging any work by the council in the fight against anti-labor legis-
lation.

The breaking of the Allis-Chalmers strike in Milwaukee offers a basic lessons
The coporation used the Communist bogy to defeat the strike. This is the pat-
tern that will be applied to the whole labor movement.

Thosawithin the AFL who seek to demobilize and disarm the rank and file by div-
erting_attention from real dangers ought to be isolated and driven out of the
labor movement:

Because of the biolent offensive by American big business, headed by the Truman

Administration, against civil liberties, this will be a difficult issue to make
clear at the convention.

It is of vital importance for all progressives to explain before and during the
convention that witch-hunts and red-baiting within the state Federation must be
OPPOSED, lest the AFL out its own throat by helping Zmerican reaction and fasc-
ism to run wild.

What Lies Ahead

Such a perspective for the coming state convention, will have repercussions in
the Teamsters Convention and in the national AFL Conventions California can blow
fresh air through the musty chambers of national AFL gatherings.

The perspectives before the convention could well be summarized in one slogan:
{FOLLOW ALAMEDA COUNTY!" This slogan embodies the two sides of the battle ahead:
removal of the present State Federation leadership, much as Charles Real was
moved out of.A1ameda county, and then a genuine fighting program based on unity
of labor and the oommunity..

If, in every community and every local union, an effort is made to move immed-
iately into action on antiwlabor legislation, on wages and union security, this
provide the best background for the convention.

Working to move the convention withoiﬁ having a solid foundation in local union*
