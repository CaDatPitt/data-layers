SALT LAKE CITY, Utah—When 1967 negotiations
with the nonferrous metals industry get underway early
next month, Mine-Mill and the United Steelworkers of
America will lay on the table a broad program of bar-
gaining proposals that stresses major wage, pension, in-
come security, and other economic improvements. A cost-
of-living escalator clause, designed to prevent an erosion
of wage gains to be won this year, also will be a high

priority item.

Lawrence Henry, U. S. -attorney for Colorado, and J. Walter Yeagley and Francis X. Worthington, two Justice
, hartment attorneys, asked for dismissal of the indictment which had charged the defendants with a “conspiracy”

to defraud the government
by the filing of false non-
Communist affidavits. Not-
ing the “staleness of the
case generally,” they point-
ed out that “The indictment
is now in its 11th year and
alleges activities that go

“This marks the end of a long
period of legal harassment of

ing, “With nonferrous negotia-

1967 to be an extremely satis-
fying year in all respects.”

On behalf of the union’s entire

Other Unions Represented
Also attending the conference
were over 75 representatives
from 16 other international un-
ions and the Industrial Union
and Metal Trades Departments
of the AFL-CIO. Skinner and
Molony expressed their deep
hope that joint bargaining this
year, involving all unions hold-
ing bargaining rights in the in-
dustry, would become a reality
after the other unions had an
opportunity to evaluate reports
on the conference from their
delegates in attendance,

‘The two conference co-chair-
men declared that prospects are
extremely bright that the 1967
round of negotiations will be the
most successful in the history of
the nonferrous metals industry.
Pointing to the increased bar-
gaining strength that the formal
July I merger of the two unions
will produce, they also cited the
skyrocketing industry profits as
a major factor in the bargaining
picture.

We are telling the industry,
said Molony at the close of the
conference, “Your duty this year

' is to recognize the needs of your

employees. . . . You will disre-
gard those needs at your own
peril.”

Emphasizing the unions’ hope
that a just settlement could be
achieved without work- stop-
pages, he was applauded by the
delegates when he continued,
“But if it takes a’ strike . . . So
be it!”

Goal of Union Mergers Is
More Bargaining Power

The number of mergers and proposed mergers among inter-
national unions in the United States has increased sharply within
the past year. Faced with the task of dealing with companies that
have been consolidating and expanding into huge corporations,
unions representing members working in the same industry, or
related industries, are beginning to view unity as a necessity.

Last year, the ﬂedgling National Farm Workers Association
merged with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AFL-
CIO) to become the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee.
This came on the heels of a series of strikes, and ultimate victories,
in efforts to unionize agricultural workers,

, Printing Trades

Prospects for unity among the
printing trades are becoming in-
creasingly evident. In February,
the International Typographical
Union signed a pact with the
Printing Pressmen’s Union
which could le-a d to eventual
merger of the two organizations.
The ITU,’ too, made an overture
for talks with the International
Stereotypers and Electrotypers
Union proposing cooperation be-
tween and affiliation of the two
unions.

Flight engineers employed by
Trans World Airlines recently
agreed in principle to a merger
with the Air Line Pilots Associ-
ation. In the past seven years,
some 3,000 have joined the pi-
lots’ union, which now repre-
sents ﬂight engineers on 16 air-
lines.

Other unions which recently

‘have discussed merger include

the International Brotherhood
of Pulp, Sulphite and Paper Mill
Workers and the United Paper-
makers and Paperworkers, Sim-
ilar talks have gone on among
the railroad brotherhoods.

make it enforceable.

The council recommended the adoption of the following laborﬁ
legislation: A state minimum wage law in line with federal stand
ards, and including coverage of agricultural workers; unemploy‘
ment benefits at 50 percent of wage, and covering agricultulfa
workers; establishment of a Labor Department to handle wagf;
collection and wage and hour enforcement; a state safety’ cod‘
with enforcement by a Labor Department or the Industrial C
to cover establishments not under the 

mission,
of the state mine inspector;
protection against garnishment
of wages by setting a limit on
the amount to be -taken; and
improvement of Workmen’s
Compensation to provide fairer
hearing procedures, speedier
claims handling, and better cov-
erage for temporary disability
from old injuries.

Mine Safety Proposals

A “statement of position” by
the AMMC listed three points
which need immediate attention
to ensure adequate state mine
safety enforcement. It called for
legislative measures to give the
state mine inspector the power
to promulgate and enforce rules
and regulations on mine safety
(the state attorney general has
held that they are not enforce-
able under present law); estab-
lish a study committee to bring

THE MINE-MILL UNION

{\riADIAN DELEGATES FROM BOTH THE STEELWORICERS AND MINE-MILL sat in on the March bargaining confer-

    

smut

V - fence in Salt Lake City, and discused the bright prospects for future successful bargaining in Canada, where nonferrous
contracts do not come open this year. The recent moves towards labor unity in that country and the prosperity of the
~ companies there, which is even greater than the case in the. U.S.; are major factors in an outlook of optimism.

Canadian Mine-Mill, USWA  

 Launch Unify Discussions

EDMONTON, Alberta—A Mine-Mill Canadian leadership conference on Feb. 17
and 18, attended by some 80 delegates from local unions throughout the country and
national officers and staff, unanimously endorsed the continuation of discussions be-
tween the union’s national executive board and the United Steelworkers of America

' and other unions on the question of labor unity.

The conference resolution was approved after two days of intense discussion of
a no-raiding, mutual assistance pact between Mine-Mill and the Steelworkers in Canada
that was signed on Feb. 2 in Toronto. The pact, which has brought to an end 18 years

of fierce rivalry between the two unions, makes possible the consideration of organic

unity of the two organizations
'...,-.inJ,1anada.
Like the mutual assistance
agreement signed last fall
which covered the United States
, sections of the two unions, the
7'-L’-'pact» pledges cooperation in
‘ bargaining and in legislative

action, as well as an end to
 raiding.

Convention Proposed
_ A The statement of the Edmon-
ton conference, which noted that
a major concern of Mine-Mill

-:5

members in Canada is the
maintenance of Canadian auton-
omy and the rights of the coun-
try’s workers to run their own
affairs, proposed that a Mine-
Mill Canadian convention should
be held following unity talks be-
tween the officers of the two
unions.

Terming the conference “an
example of . . . the devotion to
basic trade union principles that
have been developed by our
people over many long years,”

Mine-Mill Canadian President
Kenneth Smith declared that the
“mining companies must now
realize that they face a com-
pletely new situation, much dif-
ferent than what there has been
for the past 18 years, because
the division has been brought to
an end.”

Labor unity is a necessity,
Smith stated, not only for the
non-ferrous metals industry in
Canada, but for the country’s
entire trade union movement.

Toronto Signing

Following earlier informal
talks, Smith, Mine-Mill Canadian
Vice-President Harvey Murphy,
and Secretary - Treasurer Wil-
liam Longridge met with Cana-
dian USWA leaders William Ma-
honey, national director, and
Larry Sefton, District 6 direc-
tor, on Feb. 1 and 2 in Toronto.

Joining in the discussions
which led to the signing of the
historic mutual assistance pact
were USWA Vice-President Jo-
seph P. Molony and Mine-Mill
International President A. C.
Skinner. Both had taken part in
negotiations between the two
unions in the United States,
where unity is now a reality.

A letter on the pact, signed by
the three USWA spokesmen at
the Toronto meetings, went to
all Canadian locals of the union,
stressing the basic conviction
underlying the unity moves.

“B e n e a th all the bitterness
which has existed between the
Canadian sections of the two un-
ions over recent years,” it stat-
ed, “has been the conviction that
Canadian non-ferrous workers
must_ confront a wealthy and

growing industry with the great-

est possible united bargaining
power and organizational ability.
Lack of bargaining unity, and
division of organizing activity

have prevented maximum re-‘

sults for members of both

groups.”

Merger in U. S.

The mutual aid pact affecting
the U.S. sections of the two un-
ions was signed on Aug. 26, 1966
in Denver, Colorado, In Septem-

her last year, delegates to the

Steelworkers convention enthusi-

astic-ally approved— the idea of. 

merger of the two ‘organizations.
The final step in the merger de-
cision came at Mine-Mill’s spe-
cial convention in January in
Tucson, Ariz., when delegates

unanimously endorsed consoli-
dation.

On Feb. 1, Mine-Mill in the
US, became an affiliate of the
United Steelworkers. The merg-
er itself is effective on July 1
this year.

 Orientation Seminar

PITTSBURGH, Pa.——“The role of the staff representative” was the subject dis-
cussed by-USWA President I. W. Abel at the closing session on March 3 of an orienta-
tion seminar attended by members of the Mine-Mill executive board and staff. And it
was to that topic, in fact, that the entire week-long educational program was devoted.

In the United Steelworkers of America, the job of the staff representative is no
different than it is in Mine-Mill. But the resources of the USWA international office

- here are greater, the personnel more numerous, the departments more specialized.

The major purpose of the orientation seminar was to acquaint the Mine-Vlill

unions approaches, so that they
can continue to play their role
as effectively as possible when
that change-over occurs.

Later, when the press of non-
ferrous negotiations diminishes,
the present Mine-Mill staff rep-
resentatives will go through, a
few at a time, a longer three-
weeks session that eventually
will reach all USWA staff rep-
resentatives. To date, as staff
members have taken this staff
development program, as the
first year of these sessions is
just being completed.

New Emphasis on Education

It was after Abel’s election as
president. of the Steelworkers
that Fred,K. Hoehler, Jr. took
over as head of the union’s Ed-
ucation Department a year and
a half agoj During that brief
period, the union has placed a
new and heavy emphasis on the
functions of that department.
Education conferences for the
officers‘ and district directors of
the union " are now held twice
a year; district education coor-
dinators have been selected;
to a c h e r training programs,
through which local union per-
sonnel learn how to present ef-
fectively material on grievance
handling and local union admin-
istration, have been established
in some of the districts.

It was the Education Depart-
ment, which now maintains the
Clinton S. Golden Conference

‘Center in the Sherwyn Hotel

near the USWA international
union office, that set up the spe-
cial orientation course for the
Mine-Mill staff and board. As-
sisting Hoehler during the Feb.
26 to March 3 session were John
Powderly, Bruce Alexander, and
William Fletcher, members. of
the department staff. V

the role of education in trade
union affairs since assuming
the presidency, emphasized the
staff representative’s role in this

_ effort.

Some 250,000 members of the
United Steelworkers, he said,
became members of the union
because of V union shop provi-
sions and similar requirements,
rather than through contact by
staff members or local union
officers. If the union is to be
strengthened, these members--—
many of them young ones—must
be made aware of the real bene-
fits to be derived -from union
membership and of the strug-
gles that the winning of these
benefits required, Abel said.

'USWA Vice-President Joseph
P. Molony, who dealt with the
subject of organizing, stressed
the importance of helping not
only the union’s own members,
but the unemployed and other
unorganized workers." Pointing
out that the AFL-CIO today rep-
resents fewer workers, as a per-
centage of the total work force,
than it did at the time of merg-
er 12 years ago, Molony stated
that the country’s “working
poor” and its white collar work-
ers are two important groups
that need to be organized,

In discussing the financial af-
fairs of the United Steelworkers,
Secretary-Treasurer Walter J.
Burke noted the vast amounts
that have been required in

strike relief over the years and ’

the present threat of automa-
tion, which could well cause a
serious decline in membership
and thus in per capita income.
He, too, stressed the great need
for effective organization of ad-
ditional workers.

Department Duties
Explained
Otis Brubaker and Bernard
Kleiman, heads of the Rese_arch
and the Legal Departments re-
spectively, explained the func-
tionings of their offices. Klei-
man, who noted that the union

retains district counsel in most
areas of the country, said that
his department is attempting to
focus more on the needs of the
staff representatives. A legal
newsletter will go to all staff

members, he said, and a staff--

man’s legal handbook is now
being developed as well.’

The R e s e a r c h Department

plays a major role in all of‘

the union’s negotiations, prepar-
ing financial a n a l y s e s on at
least 4 0 0 different companies
each year. The USWA, said Bru-
baker, over the years has at-

tempted to purchase’ a share of‘

stock in each of the companies
with which it deals in order to
receive the various reports put
out by those companies. Addi-
tionally, he pointed out, a n y
company pleading poverty in

negotiations must open its in-

come tax and other records to
the union.

Because of the size of the

United Steelworkers, said Bru-
baker, local unions are asked to
funnel requests for assistance
through their staff representa-
tives. , 4
Civil Rights

Alex Fuller, director of the
USWA Civil Rights Committee,

the union’s locals already have

tees of five or more members,

THE MINE-MILL UNION

Skinner Raps Anaeonda’s “Disregard for
Safety,” Citing -Four Recent Butte Fatalities

JSBUTTE, Mont.—Four miners met with accidental death while at work at the Anaconda Company’s
mines here between Jan. 18 and Feb, 28. Mine-Mill President A. C. Skinner, expressing shock at the
:rapid succession of fatalities, said, “If this pace continues for the rest of the year, 1967's fatal acci-
efnt rate will be the worst in the history of the mines at Butte at least as far back as 1930.”

3;-’The union leader placed the blame for the disgraceful and tragic accident record “squarely with

“Safety. posters and fancy charts and tables in the front office,” he said, “are no substitute for

the 4000 level of the Steward
Mine on Jan." 26. He was pinned
against the frame of a locomo-
tive by one rock which slid from
the wall, and then struck by a
second rock which fell fromthe
back. He is survived by his
widow and one dependent child.

James Dunn, Boysza’s part-
ner, was knocked off balance by
the impact of the second falling
rock, but was not injured.

On Feb. 9, Hierholzer was
killed when he was crushed be-
neath the wheels of a haulage
truck at the north end of the
Berkeley open pit mine. Sur-

vived by his widow, he was 62
years old and had worked for
Anaconda for 32 years.

McKinney, 49, who was killed
on Feb, 28 at the 4800 level of
the Mountain Con shaft, is sur-
vived by his widow and four de-
pendent children. A station
tender, he fell down the open
hoisting compartment of the
shaft, and was covered by a
surge of wet muck, sustaining
multiple and fatal injuries.

All four of the recent fatal ac-
cidents were investigated by in-
spectors of the United States Bu-
reau of Mines.

Labor Group to Aid War
On Povertyliffort in NJ.

NEW BRUNSWICK, N. J.—The establishment on Feb. 15 of a
labor advisory committee under the Middlesex County Economic
Opportunities Corporation represents the first attempt in the na-
tion by a local anti-poverty program to mobilize grassroots labor

support in the War 693 Poverty, Milton Zatinsky, executive director,

of MCEOC, told the 100 persons in attendance at the organizational

meeting.

Thomas Cosgrove, the national AFL-CIO’s liaison with the
Office of Economic Opportunities, was another major speaker at
the meeting at Rutgers University Labor Education Center here.
He agreed that -the gathering was the largest group of trade

unionists specifically concerned
on a local level with the involve-
ment of organized labor in the‘
job training, employment, and
other such anti-poverty pro-
grams.

Some 75 local union officers
and business agents, represent-
ing 75,000 organized workers in
the county, will serve on the
advisory committee. Backing
the new role for labor in the
community’s social programs
are officials of the Middlesex
County Central Labor Council,
as well as representatives from
many locals of some 30 inter-
national unions.

Mine-Mill Participation

Among the sponsors of the
organizational meeting, who will
serve on the advisory commit-
tee, were Thomas DeFederico,
president of Mine-Mill Local 837
in Carteret; John Infusino, pres-
ident of Local '365 in Perth

Amboy; ’ and ‘August Nelson, .re_-__ ,

cording secretary of Mine-Mill
Local 679 in Nixon. Joining in
the sponsorship of the organiza-
tion on behalf of the United
Steelworkers in the area were
Benjamin Booker, Carl DeFazio,
Richard Johnson, and Michael
Savoia.

Mine-Mill International Repre-
sentative William Morton will
serve on a dozen-man steering
committee of the larger ad-
visory group.

Zatinsky, who outlined areas
of possible cooperation between
labor and the county’s anti-
poverty agency, declared that
their united effort could achieve
otherwise unattainable or diffi-
cult goals.

Other speakers at the meeting
included Charles Longo, presi-
dent’ of the county’s Central
Labor Council, and Joel Jacob-
son, president of the N. J . State
Industrial "Union ‘Council.

CHICAGO, Ill.—The 135 work-
ers at the Paragon Die-Casting
Company here, members of
Mine_-Mill Local 758, struck on
March 9 in their fight for a just

Major issues in the walkout

to prevent erosion by inflation
of increases eventually won, as
well as substantial improve-
ments in the pension and health

for Local 758, heads the union’s

members are Charlie Ognar,

Drive Underway

To Recapture
Bunker Hill

KELLOGG, Idaho — Those

workers who want to bring genu-
ine trade unionism back to the
Bunker Hill property in the
Coeur d’Alenes will soon have
that opportunity, Mine - Mill
Board Member Barney Rask
and USWA Sub-District Director
Austin Smith told a crowd of
employees and their wives on
Feb. 14 at the kickoff meeting
of the Bunker Hill organizing
campaign.
‘ Only one week later, on Feb.
21, Orville Turnbaugh of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board in
Seattle chaired the hearing into
the petition for a bargaining
representation election at the
mine and smelter, where close
to 1600 workers are employed.
Filed under the banner of the
United Steelworkers of America,
the petition was accompanied by
signed cards far in excess of the
number required.

With several craft unions——the
Boilermakers, Electricians, and
the Machinists—filin-g interven-
tion petitions for smaller units,
it is likely to be some time be-
fore the election is held.

Mounting‘ Dissatisfaction

Mo st of the Steelworkers’
cards that have been signed
were circulated by workers on
the job, rather than by Mine-
Mill and Steelworkers, staff per-
sonnel. Dissatisfaction has been
growing among the workers
there with the Northwest Metal
Workers, an independent union
which gained bargaining rights-
‘in 1961, but since has acted more‘
as a social club than a bargain-
ing representative. — '

, Smith and Rask stressed the.
need for a union that will sup--
port the workers in. a struggle
if Bunker Hill employees are to
win back the conditions and con-
tract language they once en-
joyed and make new .gains,~

Mine-Mill had represented the
Bunker Hill workers until North-
west broke its strike there six
years ago. In 1964, Northwest
barely won a majority vote in
an NLRB election against Mine-
Mill and the United Steelwork-
ers, which at that time were
rivals rather than organizations
cooperating closely on bargain-
ing, political action, and in every
other respect. ‘ ‘ '

THE MINE-MILL UNION

March-April. 

IOHN CLARK, MINE-MILL’S INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT F OR A PERIOD OF 15 YEA

   

$

who was named honorary president upon his retirement in 1963, was laid to rest on
March 1 in Holy Hope Cemetery in Tucson, Arizona. Messages of grief at the news of
his death came from many international union presidents, as well as from Mine-Mill
locals and members throughout the U.S. and Canada.

Clark's Death Loss to Labor

(Continued from Page 1)

Clark became a United States
citizen in 1936, being elected the
same year as secretary of the
Great Falls Mill and Smelter-
men’s Union. He remained an
officer of Local No. 16 until his
appointment by the interna-
tional executive board in 1947 to
fill the vacant post of western
vice-president. He assumed the
duties of the secretary-treasurer
later that year, and was elected
international president in 1948.

That same year, Clark be-
came a member of the execu-
tive board of the Congress of
Industrial Organizations (CIO),
working closely with John L.
Lewis and Philip Murray.

It was during Clark’s 15 years
as international president that
Mine-Mill underwent some of
the most severe political attacks
in its long history. Among these
was an attempt by the Subver-
sive Activities Control Board to
have the union labeled as “Com-
munist-infiltrated”, and the in-
dictment of 14 officers and staff
members in the infamous Taft-
Hartley “conspiracy”' case, a
legal battle which spanned 11
years and involved two trials.

Wholehearied Support-

Although charges were never
leveled against Clark" himself,
those who were persecuted dur-
ing this trying period always re-
ceived his wholehearted support,
and it was a source of great

Savannah Local

Inks Agreement

SAVANNAH, Ga. — Mine-Mill
Local No. 870 recently signed a
three-year contract agreement
with the AGRICO Company
which provides for 30 cents in

across-the-board wage increases.
In addition to the general pay I

hike, the union won a five-cents-
an-hour adjustment for the ﬂuo-

. rine mixers. .
The Friday -following Thanks-I

giving Day was added to the list
of holidays, making a total of

eight each year.

Negotiating for the Savannah
Fertilizer and Chemical Manu-
facturing Local were Herbert
Jinkins, committee chairman,
Ed McKine, and James Reed,
assisted by Jesse Doster, Mine-
Mill international representa-
tive.

The contract is the first signed
at the property since it was
purchased by AGRICO, a divi-
sion of the Continental Oil Com-
pany. The -operation -formerly
was owned by the American
Agricultural Chemical Company.

satisfaction to him that not one
of these accusations or charges
was ever sustained. He was not,
however, to witness the official
conclusion of the government’s
harassment of Mine-Mill. On
Mar. 17, less than three weeks
after Clark’s death, Fed_eral Dis-
trict Judge Alfred A. Arraj
signed an order in Denver dis-
missing the charges against the
six remaining defendants in the
“conspiracy” case. ‘

Despite these attempts to
wreck Mine-Mill, Clark guided
the union through an unprece-
dented period of collective bar-

gaining gains. During his presi-

dency, wages for the workers
in the nonferrous mining indus-
try increased by $1.50 an hour.

Mine-Mill members held Clark
in such high esteem that, upon
his retirement in 1963, he was
named the union’s honorary
president-—the only person so
honored in Mine-Mill’s 74-year
history.

Funeral services for the 78-
year-old unionist were held on

Home, with burial in Holy Hope

Fire Kills Sidney Zagri,
Teamsters’ Top Lobbyist 

...n_........._ . ....o..¢...~,.~.. fr . _... .. <..-1.

MONTGOMERY, Ala.—-Sidney Zagri, legislative and political 

action director for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, died ._7,

on Feb. 7 in a fire at Dale’s Restaurant here that claimed 26 lives.

The blaze, which spread rapidly through the rooftop dining room,
is believed to have been started by a cigarette in a cloakroom.

A
u
l

In a telegram to Teamsters President James R. Hoffa, the
Mine-Mill international officers expressed their shock and sadness
at Zagri’s death and extended their deep sympathy to his family.

“He aided our union in many
of its legislative projects,” the
officers pointed out, “and was
particularly helpful in the fight
for mine safety legislation."

Hoffa said that Zagri, 53, was
“irreplaceable” and “a tireless
worker” for both the Teamsters
Union and for organized labor
generally. He was widely re-
spected in Washington as one of
the most effective and energetic
spokesmen for the trade union
movement.

Senate Eulogy

In a eulogy to Zagri delivered
on the floor of the U.S. Senate
on Feb. 8, Sen. Hiram Fong of
Hawaii said, “Everyone knew
Sid as a warm and compassion-
ate human being, a foremost
champion in the fight to secure
to all Americans all the civil
rights and civil liberties guaran-
teed under the Constitution of
the United States.” V

Zagri was in Montgomery,
when he was trapped in the
tragic fire, attempting to track
down some important evidence
in Hoffa’s ﬁght to win justice in
the courts against such prosecu-

Texas District Conference

Of USWA Hails Merger

HOUSTON, Texas—The militant traditions of Mine-Mill, far
from being submerged or forgotten in the days ahead, “will be-
come part of our common heritage, to be passed on by good union
men to future generations of the United Steelworkers of America,”
states a resolution adopted by delegates to a USWA District 37
~ conference here early last month.

At a March 4 dinner, James E. Ward, USWA director for the
Texas district, presented a scroll bearing a message of solidarity
to fraternal delegates from Mine-Mill in attendance at the gather-
ing—Maclovio R. Barraza, District 2 board member, and Alfredo

Montoya,

international representative.

Barraza addressed the

meeting the following day, stressing the benefits that unit_y of
the two unions will bring this" year and in the future.

—-4--A/.1 \Qne such area, declared USWA Secretary-Treasurer Walter J.

uu/rke, is that of political action. The major speaker at the
conference, Burke said that now is the time to start making
preparations for the elections in 1968.
‘ He also discussed the union’s_new program designed to com-
municate effectively with newly hired workers, who all too often
“do not know much about the roots and aims of trade unions.”
Presented to “Our Valiant Brothers from Mine-Mill,” the scroll
from the ‘District 37 delegates is entitled “One Big Union,” and

bears the following inscription:

Our Union’s martyrs, wise unselfish men, showed I
us the way; uniting years ago in Memory’s hall.

They knew the fees that each had faced, ﬂank or

center, were the same.

They -‘knew that Hunger did‘ not sort by Union name
the children of mining camp and shantytown, but

claimed them all.

They knew Injustice, shameless wench, .would—moc_k
their rightful claims; that courts were brothels shared
by- Lords. of Steel and Copper Kings.

They knew the bullets that killed Joe Hill and tore
the life from Homestead’s men came from a common

-.,~—..»\.,.______

mold; Greed always held the gun.

They knew the blood that soaked the dust at South
Chicago’s steel-mill gates and formed dark pools on
tortured ground at Coeur d’A1enes flowed from the
veins of Union men who struggled for the goals of all.

That paper wall, words that divided us, is down and
gone; we march together now in common cause and
_pay the debt long due to heroes past.

May theyrest in peace, those murdered men, your»
V Union kin and ours; they showed the way.

And as we spend their dreams, we hear again‘ an
echo from those ghostly years:

“Don’t mourn for us;

march on—and organize!”

Nigadoo Strikers Win Contract
Valued at 74 Cents Per Hour

 

‘BAT-HURST, N. B.—A 103-day strike bymembers of -Mine-Mill Local 1043 against
Nigadoo River Mines Ltd. was_ concluded successfully at the -beginning of February,
when workers overwhelmingly ratified a settlement package valued at 74 cents per

hour.

Sixty cents per hour of that total is in wages, which had been the primary issue
in the walkout that began on Oct. 22. Strongly ‘backed by the New Brunswick Feder-
ation of Labor, the 156 strikers waged a solid battle over more than three months to

prevent the rich Beauchemin in-
terests of Quebec from bringing
to the province a pattern of low
wages——from 25 to 60 cents an
hour less than other mine work-
ers in the area.

The Nigadoo men, as a‘ result
of their victorious strike, will be
making the highest wages that
Beauchemin ever has been
forced to pay its employees.

Immediate 35¢: Hike
A 35-cents-per-hour boost in
wages is effective immediately,
to cover a 10-month pre-produc-
.tion period at the Nigadoo prop-
erty. Wage gains of 10 cents an
hour, seven cents, and eight
cents will take effect during the

following three-year period.

In addition, the ‘shift differ-
entials and other fringe benefits
that were recommended in the
conciliation board’s majority re-
port will be part of the new con-
tract. These fringes amount to
about 14 "cents perhour. ‘

The settlement was reached _

with the unprecedented aid of
Premier Louis Robichaud of the
province of New Brunswick, who
on Jan. 17 was presented with
petitions bearing 4,416 signa-

THE OFFICE AND TECHNICAL WORKERS CONFERENCE was chaired by Iohn Sgro

tures asking-his intervention in
the strike. Delivered by a Mine-
Mill delegation, the petitions
represented a broad spectrum of
opinion in the community-haw
ing been signed by persons from
all walks of life . . . profession-
als, businessmen, priests, stu-
dents, doctors, nurses, workers.

In a wire to Fern Doucet,
president of Local 1043, Premier
Robichaud reported the change
in the company’s position that
led to settlement, noting that it
represented a “significant ad-
-Vance on their previous stand
and also an advance on the con-
ciliation board recommenda-
tion.’-’

Mine-Mill was first certified
to bargain for Nigadoo workers
in June, 1965, but the company,

instead of coming to the bar-

gaining table, attempted to get
applications for decertification.
The question of the right to bar-
gainrwas finally determined by

‘ta June, 1966 certification vote,
which was followed by the
‘ lengthy conciliation proceedings.

Broad Importance
In holding out for a substan-

 

from the USWA O&T Dept. at the Pittsburgh headquarters. Delegates to the Nonferrous
Industry Conference approved, cts part of ‘he 1967 bargaining program, (1 section of
demands aimed at the special problems of the office and technical workers of the in-

dustry.

 

tial wage settlement, the Niga-
doo strikers not only gained a
notable Victory for themselves
and their families, but strength-
ened the bargaining possibilities
for other sections of New Bruns-
wick labor facing forthcoming
negotiations.

Among those promoting uni-
fied labor backing for the long
struggle were John Maclllillan,
president of the New Brunswick
Federation of Labor, and Paul
Lepage, _vice-president of the
area federation and an official
of the United Steelworkers in
the province. '

Rock Fall Injeres
Kill Bisbee Mner

BISBEE, Ariz. -— Frank R.
Burgos, 48, died on March 5 of
injuries sustained when he was

struck by a falling rock on Feb.
28- in a stope off the 2700-foot

‘level of the Campbell shaft of

the Phelps Dodge Corporation’s.
Copper Queen Branch, where
Mine-Mill Local 551 holds bar-
gaining rights.

The U.S. Bureau of Mines in-
vestigated the accident, but not
until after Burgos’ death when it
was first notified of the mishap.
Because work had continued in
the stope in the days following
the accident, the investigators
had to reconstruct the scene of
the rock fall through interviews.

F, O. Acuna, Burgos’ partner,
had left the stope to get a sup-
ply of powder when the accident
occurred.

At no time after he was struck
by the rock was Burgos able to
tell what happened. According-
ly, all that is known is that he
sustained multiple injuries from
a fall of ground.

Burgos, who had been em-
ployed as a miner intermittently
by the company since 1937, left
no dependent survivors.

“Conspiracy" Case Dismissed

(Continued from Page 1)
through a long period of adver-
sity. He praised, too, the many
other unions and individuals
who provided moral and finan-
cial aid during the drawn-out
legal battle.

The union’s victory is the final
vindication in a long string of
court proceedings initiated dur-
ing the 1950’s when the cloud
of mccarthyism hung over the
country. From the beginning,
the union’s leaders maintained
that the charges were false and
vindictively inspired.

The six remaining defendants
in the “conspiracy” case, whose
convictions were reversed by
the ,U.S. Supreme Court last
June, were Skinner; Irving
Dichter, international secretary-
treasurer; Raymond Dennis, ex-
ecutive board member; Maurice
E. Travis, -former secretary-
treasurer and president; Harold
Sanderson, assistant to the pres-
ident; and Charles Wilson, inter-
national representative.

Grand Jury Testimony‘
Dismissal of the charges ful-

.fills .-the prediction made . by

Mine-Mill General Counsel Na-
than Witt at the time of the Su-

' preme Court ruling last year.

Because that unanimous deci-
sion would make grand jury
testimony available to the de-
fense, Witt stated, a third trial

A -in the case was extremely un-

likely‘. '

Witt said that such access to
the grand jury minutes in. the
case would; permit the defense

to Show on cross-examination"
: discrepancies in - the informer «

testimony against the defend-
ants.

The indictment against the
original 14 defendants in the
“conspiracy” case was handed
down in 1956, but it was Novem-
ber of 1959—when Mine-Mill was
involved in a nationwide copper
strike — before the. case first
went to trial. Section 9(h) of the
Taft-Hartley Act (the non-Com-
munist affidavit provision), upon
which the entire case -was based,
was repealed by Congress a
month prior to the opening of
that trial.

The entire American labor
«movement, of course, ‘had op-
posed Taft-Hartley, Many
unions, including Mine-Mill, re-
fused for a period to comply
with the law's affidavit provi-
sion, arguing that it violated
fundamental constitutional guar-
antees. But when the Supreme
Court upheld the law, these
unions realized that they would
have to comply or lose the ser-
vices of the National Labor Re-
lations Board.

It was simply for this basic
trade union reason that Mine-
Mill came into compliance with
Taft-Hartley. During the trials,
however, the court would not
permit Mine-Mill to present evi-
dence from the NLRB on the
date of its compliance with the
affidavit section as compared
with other major labor unions.

In 1959, the judge dismissed
charges against two of the 11

defendants -who stood trial. The

Appeals Court later dismissed
charges against two more, or-
dering a second trial for .-the

remaining seven defendants.

One of them — International
Representative Jesse Van Camp
—-was found innocent in the sec-
ond trial in the case, which took
place in Denver in late‘1963. Of
the other six—who now have
been exonerated by Judge Ar-
raj’s dismissal order—-only four
had ever signed affidavits. Skin-
ner and Sanderson, who were
not officers during the period
that affidavits were required,
never signed any.

Unanimous Opinion

Supreme Court Justice Abe
Fortas wrote last year's 9 to 0
opinion reversing the convic-
tions on the. grounds. that the
grand jury testimony should
have been made -available to
the defense. Justices Hugo Black
and William 0. Douglas went
further, sharply criticizing the
court for refusing to allow the
defendants to question the valid-
ity of the indictment and the
constitutionality of the non-Com-
munist provision in the Taft-
Hartley Act.

“I must say with considerable
regret,” declared Black, “that
future historians reporting this
case may justifiably draw an
inference that it is the petition-

  Bargaining Goals Established

"(Continued from Page 1)
of companywide meetings the
previous day. Separate meetings
were held for each of the “Big
Four” of the copper industry-
Kennecott, Anaconda, American
Smelting and Refining, and
Phelps Dodge-for the other in-
“dependent copper companies, for
' the lead and zinc producers, and
for the office and technical
workers.
, Although their contracts do
‘not come open this year, the
.25 Canadian delegates in attend-
_, -ance, from Mine-Mill and the
 1  .,'Steelworkers met together to dis-
cuss the recent moves towards
lab’or unity in that country,

The bargaining program
adopted at the conference points
out that from the continuous rise
in worker productivity, the gen-
erally healthy financial condi-
tion of the companies, the tre-
mendous rise in industry profits,
and the long-range outlook for
continued high demand for cop-

"fper can-come major wage and
benefit improvements without
injury to the economy of either

 the country or the companies

' and without further increases in
' the price of the metal.

‘Substantial’ Wage Gains
" 9 Sought

The delegates put no price ‘tag
on their wage demands, but said
simply that “substantial”, in-
creases, both general and incre-
ment, are needed from all com-
" f _ panies. In calling for the stand-
 a-rdization of wage scales
throughout the industry, they de-
clared. that a 20-cents-per-hour
,’ catch-up is needed “to restore
, .' some degree of parity for Ana-
 conda workers” in Montana,

Utah, and California.
The cost - of - living escalator
clause, which would provide
quarterly adjustments at one-
‘cent in wages for each alternat-
' ing .3 point and .4 point in the
BLS Consumer Price Index, is
necessary to protect wage gains
from inflation such as occurred
in the past few years, the bar-
gaining document states. Since
-"present contracts — most of
which expire this June 30—took
-* A“ effect in 1964, the cost of living

I g has risen 6.4 percent. A

J’ Another high priority need, the

delegates agreed, is extensive
improvement in the pension pro-
grams ofall companies. In ad-
dition to an increase in the
monthly pension to $6 for each
year of service, the document
calls for a special monthly sup-
plement of $130 for early or dis-
ability retirees, payable until
Social Security benefits become
available.

Full pension vesting after 10
years of service and retirement
after 30 years of service regard-
less of age will be asked of the
companies this year.

Income Security Needs
The delegates also stressed
the need for standardization of,

and improvement in, programs .

relating to income and job se-
curity—supplemental unemploy-
ment benefits, severance pay of
$150 per year of service, and
contract language to prevent

layoffs because of automation .

and technological change.

Among the bargaining propos-
als are those calling for com-
plete elmination of employee
contributions to health and wel-
fare programs, as well as im-
proved benefits for workers, de-
pendents, retirees, and unem-
ployed workers.

Included in the program are
demands for improved holidays
and vacations, including extend-
ed vacations for all employees

once every five years of 10.

weeks time off with 13 weeks’
pay, and strengthened safety and
non - discrimination c o n t r a ct
clauses.

Delegates also approved a set
of bargaining proposals relating
specifically to office and techni-
cal employees, stressing that a
“full and satisfactory O&T set-
tlement shall be an integral part
of our collective bargaining pol-
icy” in the industry this year.

Continuations Committee

Although the full Nonferrous
Industry Conference will be re-
convened to pass judgment upon
an industry offer that might con-
stitute a pilot or pattern settle-
ment, the delegates passed a
resolution establishing a Contin-
uations Committee of the Con-
ference, which is empowered to
authorize the holding of mem-
bership strike votes and to carry

out the general settlement policy
set by the Conference.

Sixteen members of the 28-
man Continuations Committee
are local union delegates elected
by members of their respective
bargaining groups — two each
from the “Big Four,” one from
American Metal Climax, one
from Magma Copper, one from
Copper Range, one from Inspi-
ration Consolidated and Miami
Copper jointly, and ‘four from
the lead and zinc industry. Also
on the committee will be Molony
and Skinner, Otis Brubaker and
Arthur Stuart, research direc-
tors for the Steelworkers and
Mine-Mill respectively, and the
two co-chairmen from each of
the “Big Four” bargaining
groupings.

Nonferrous is the first of four
new Industry Conferences cre-
ated by the Steelworkers at the
union’s convention last Septem-
ber, which, according to USWA
President I. W. Abel, represents
a new union effort to bring “our
members closer to the process

of collective bargaining in ma-

jor segments of the union’s juris-
diction.” __
45.000 Workers Involved

Mine-Mill and the Steel-work-__

ers hold contracts _with_ more
than 100 companies in the non-
ferrous metals industry that _are

due to expire this year. Overall, I
the expiring contracts‘ c 0 Ver '

close to 45,000 workers.
While the Salt Lake City con-

ference was geared to coordi-i

nate bargaining for local unions
facing 1967 nonferrous negotia-
tions, all USWA and Mine-Mill
locals in the industry were in-
vited to participate.

Brubaker, in reporting that al-
most all of the companies are in
their best ﬁnancial shape ever,
pointed to the combined total of
over $400,000,000 after taxes
racked up in 1966 proﬁts by the
industry’s “Big Four.” The fig-
ure represents an increase of 36
percent over their 1965 com-
bined proﬁts, he said.

The USWA research director
also stated that productivity per
man-hour in the industry has
continued to rise at a rate which
will allow the companies to meet
substantial demands w i t h o u t
fe ar of exerting inflationary
pressures on the economy or
coming under c o s t’ pressures
themselves, The C o m p a n i e s
Brubaker said, simply haven’t
been sharing adequately with
their employees.

feated by a 40 to 30 vote a
proposal to bring the so-
called “right—to-work” to the
state by outlawing the union

In rejecting the bill, the
House went along with the
recommendation of its Labor
Committee, which earlier had
held public hearings on the
measure. ' 

Among the witnesses ‘op-

-‘THE MINE-MILL UNION

Labor Is Successfulin Urging
Defeat of Montana Sales Tax

HELENA, Mont,—A united labor lobbying effort has produced moderate legisla-
tive gains thus far this year in Montana, where last fall’s election gave Republicans a
wide majority in the state House and cut Democratic control of the Senate to a narrow
30 to 25 margin. At the same time, the proposal for a state sales tax, against which
the labor movement mustered its most solid opposition, went down to defeat on Feb. 25.

Passed in the House by a 57 to 43 margin, the proposed sales tax was killed in the

Senate on a strict party line vote. Public hearings on the measure on Jan. 31 were at-.

tended by hundreds of workers,
who came by the busloads from
all over the state to register
their opposition.

Rusk. Umber Testify

, James S. Umber, executive
secretary of the Montana State
AEL;CIO,_ and Barney R ask,
Mine-Mill executive board mem-
ber, testified at the hearings,
pointing out that the poor are
much harder hit by such a tax
than the wealthy. Pensioners
-particularly, they noted, would
suffer under such a scheme,
since they must live on small,
fixed incomes.

Many Mine - Mill In em b e r s
from the union’s several locals
in the state made the Helena
trip. Although the time for testi-
mony at the hearings was ex-
tremely limited, lists of names
of those in attendance were sub-
mitted to the legislators to indi-
cate the magnitude of the oppo-
sition. Bob Weller of the Lumber
and Sawmill Workers, Mamie
0’Connel1 of the Clerks Union in
Butte, and Eddie Cosad, an in-
ternational representative for

the Machinists, led the delega-
tions of their respective mem-
“bers at the hearings.

The legislative gains to date
have been primarily in the area
of workmen’s compensation—in-
creasing the number of weeks
of compensation for injury caus-

'ing death from 500 to 600 weeks,
more liberally defining “injury”
under workmen’s compensation,
and upping benefits in all cate-
gories from $2 to $4 per week.

A bill, introduced by Sen.
Thomas .Tracy (D-Butte), which
raises payments to silicotics un-
der the State Welfare Act, was
passed with strong backing from
Mine-Mill and the other labor
organizations. The hike in bene-
fits from $90 to $125 per month

is the biggest single raise ever
won.

All of the above legislative
gains become effective on July
1 this year. Sen. Eugene Ma-
honey (D-Dist, 27) sponsored the
bill which adds “unusual strain”
as a cause of “injury” as de-
fined in the workmen’s compen-
sation law. Sen. John “Luke”
McKeon (D-Anaconda) carried
the bills liberalizing the work-
men’s compensation benefits.

Unemployment

Proposal Dies
- A bill to improve the state’s
unemployment compensation
law, initiated in the House, was
strengthened in the Senate. The
measure died, however, when
three different conference com-
mittees could not agree on a sat-
isfactory compromise between

the two versions of the proposal.

Other labor-backed bills that
were killed in committee include
those relating to eight hours col-
lar to collar pay for Butte min-
ers, the designation of hospitals
as a public utility, the election
of the state mine inspector, and
a proposal concerning occupa-
tional deafness.

The bill empowering the Com-
missioner of Labor to recom-
mend changes in laws relating
to safety codes, which had labor
support, was passed and signed
into law by Gov. Tim Babcock
(R).

International Repres e n t a ti v e
George Kalafatich during the
session has spent much of his
time at the state capitol lobby-
ing in behalf of legislative pro-
posals backed by Mine-Mill and
other labor groups.

a rated capacity of one million tons of concentrates per year, it processes material received from the company's Arthur-
’ . ?Magna mills. The workers at Garfield, represented by United Steelworkers Local 4347, will be part of the united USWA
~ ' —Mine—Mill bargaining front that will face Kennecott in 1967 negotiations. Originally owned by AS&R, the Garfield
smelter was purchased by Kennecott in 1959. Extensive changes in smelting technology recently have been introduced
at Garfield. The roasting process has been completely eliminated and a new molybdic oxide recovery plant has been

built.

1 Major PD-Expansion at El Paso

Phelps Dodge announced early in March a major expansion
of its El Paso, Texas copper refinery and construction of a new
rod mill adjacent to the refinery. The two projects will cost about

‘$15 million and are scheduled for completion during 1969. '

The El Paso refinery, already the world’s largest, will be

"expanded by one-third and will have a rated capacity of 400,000
-. - ' tons per year.

The new rod mill will be the third such facility for the
company, the others being at Elizabeth, N.J. and Fort Wayne,

mine at Tyrone, N.M. El Paso will also handle custom copper for

Kennecott’s newest’ refinery, in operation since 1959 near
.Baltimore, Maryland, is also slated for expansion. The company
has let contracts to enlarge the refinery’s capacity by 81,000 tons
per year, to a total rated capacity of almost 280,000 tons annually.
Construction is scheduled to be completed late this year,‘

- Lead and Zinc lmports Up Last Year

Final figures for last year’s lead and zinc imports are in and
show that during 1966,. the first full year since 1958 without import
quotas, U.S. intake of both metals increased sharply. Lead imports
jumped 89,000 tons over 1965 for a total of 432,752 tons, and zinc
imports were up 200,000 tons over 1965 to a total of 798,708 tons.

The big increase in zinc imports came mostly from Canada,
,.,..‘__ . - V which shipped a total of 272,949 tons of ore — 71,000 more than in
 T 1965 — and 116,253 tons of zinc blocks — up 28,000 tons from the

previous year. i '

Trade sources report that the zinc industry is considering
cutbacks‘. The only company to have announced, however, "is St.
V Joseph Lead, which cut back slab zinc production at its Josephtown,

‘ Pa. smelter by 10 percent during the first quarter of this year and

company says, however, that it does not plan any layoffs.

 ' PD’s construction at El Paso is designed to meet the need for

Radiation Laboratory to test a method for deep level, low-grade
copper ore recovery. _ .

The technique being studied involves the use of nuclear
explosion to break up the ore and the passing of a leaching solution
through the broken ore to dissolve the copper. The solution would
then be recovered and processed to separate out the copper. If
the study warrants it, a field experiment may be recommended.

Aside_from the fundamental efficiency of the technique, two
problems facing the investigators are possible radioactive contami-
nation of the copper and the cost of the method itself.

Metals Week, a trade journal, reports that a preliminary site
near Safford, Arizona has been set for the study.

Considerable exploration is going on in Minnesota, north of

part nickel. At least 11 companies have been investigating the area
since 1965.

New adiation Standards Ma ffecl Many Mines

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Paul C. Tompkins, executive director of the Federal Radiation Council,
told the Mine Mill Union that the council’s long-awaited report on radiation standards in uranium
mines would be issued in a very few weeks. Other sources have indicated that the council’s report
would follow the relatively strict standard for permissible radiation resulting from U. S. Public

Health Service studies.

If this indication materializes, it will mean that a substantial number of the uranium miners
working in the Rocky Mountain states have been working under conditions that will be unacceptable

under the Federal Radiation Couneil’s standards.

, Precise information is hard to c_ome by, but according

to a confidential report of the U. S. Public

Health -Service inserted in the recordof the Senate Labor Subcommittee hearings on March 21 and 22,

WASHINGTON, D.C.—The National Traffic S at ety -Agency: ",1 ‘
“didn’t compromise. with the (automobile). industry; they,-,sur’ren_-.-.».1‘i_
dered to it," declared auto safety critic Ralph Nader, after learning _  '.
of the recent changes made in a list of safety standards’ due to 
become mandatory on 1968 model cars. Of theloriginalzs standards 
proposed last fall by the agency, three were-» dropped completely, '
while the other 20 were severely weakened by modifications.“ - , ‘_ 

It is no -scret that the pressure brought to bear by theindustry 1 
for less strict standards was great indeed. ’ "

_ Eliminated from the safety list were standards dea1ing..with~".75

tire strength, tire rim stress, and the use of headrests to reduce ‘
whiplash , injuries in rear-end collisions. Watered-down 'were_,pro'§--,
posed standards dealing with seat belt design’ and installation;  ._,

umns, the location and identifi-
cation of dashboard instruments,
door latch construction, defrost-
ing and defogging equipment,
windshield wiping and washing
systems, brake system perform-
ance, undistorted and unob-
structed rear vision, headlamp
and reﬂector requirements, rup-
ture-proof fuel tanks, and a
standardization of the automatic
transmission shift sequence.

Establishment of required
safety features was authorized
by Congress with the passage of
the Traffic Safety Act of 1966,
following Senate subcommittee
hearings on the subject.

The safety-consciousness of the
nation earlier had been awak-
ened by Nader’s book, “Unsafe
at‘Any Speed,” an expose of the
dangerously unsafe construction
of modern motor vehicles.

' _ Negative Reaction

From the outset of proposed
Congressional action, the auto
industry’s reaction to legislated
safety was a negative one. When
the bill passed, and the ‘stand-
ards were later announced, the

' “Big Four” —- General Motors,

Ford, Chrysler, and American
Motors — maintained that many
of the standards could not be
