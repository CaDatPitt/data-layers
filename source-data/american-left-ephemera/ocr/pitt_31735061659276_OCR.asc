tee, and many of them are only IO years old or even younger.
From one-ﬁfth to one-tenth of these children working outside of
school hours are employed at night, when growing children should
be getting 9 to IO hours sleep. How can a school child get the
play he needs or the chance to keep up with his school work if
he must hurry to work as soon as the three o’clock bell lets him
out of school and again in the morning before school begins?
Why these thousands of children have jobs when grown-up
men and women are pounding the pavements in a vain hunt for
work, is explained; of course, by the lower wages for which chil-
dren are made to work. Even skilled adult workers are now
slaving for the wages formerly paid only to young children, and
the children’s pay is forced down to correspondingly lower levels.

What Children Earn

Reports from different industries and different states ‘indicate

that starvation wages are almost universal. Rosie, eight-year—old 1

girl, shucking oysters in a slimy—ﬂoored shed for I2 hours a day,
beginning at 3.30 A.M., earns only $1.50 a week or less.‘ The air
is foul with the stench of oysters and dampness. This small
girl is one of several thousand children employed in canneries in
the United States. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd anything worse than the
conditions under which these children work. Hours range from
IO to 14 a day, and often include night work. Speed—up is intense,
for the fruit and vegetables are perishable and the employers,
of course, wreck the children’s health rather than lose any money
on the goods. ,

Employers in the needle trades have restored sweat-shop con-
ditions in many states and are using young children for lo-ng hours
at such low wages that even state labor commissioners are admit-
ting “conditions comparable to those existing 50 years ago.” In
Massachusetts the Minimum Wage Commission revealed wage
rates in Fall River and New Bedford as low as ﬁve and ten cents
an ‘hour for girl workers. Hundreds were earning less than 35 5
a week.

In Pennsylvania clothing factories, most of the 14- and I 5-year-
IO

according to the estimates of the National Child Labor Commit- -

    

old children are working 51 hours a week and about half of them
are receiving less than $3 a week, the Pennsylvania Bureau of
Women and Children reported in December, 1932. For boys I4
and 15 years old in Scranton, Pa., the median wage was $4.94
and for girls only $4.20 during the ﬁrst six months of 1932. (The
“median” is a kind of average and means that half the boys
earned more and half earned less than the stated amount.)
Scranton is in the anthracite mining district, where the labor
power of miners’ daughters may be bought at lowest rates for
work in the silk mills. I

‘Wherever there is industrial home work in the tenements there
is child labor and wage rates are at the lowest. Children lose
their playtime and their sleep in the family’s struggle to earn
something by home work, especially during the crisis when there
are no other jobs to be had. In Connecticut, for example, a
group of six children, the youngest ﬁve years old, were separating
long strips of lace and all six together, after an entire day’s work,
had earned only 64 cents.''’

In agriculture, employing twice as many child workers as all
other occupations together, the Work is often even more oppres-
sive and exhausting than factory work. Children must do back-
breaking jobs, usually for more than 10 hours a day at wages
notoriously low. On truck farms in New Jersey and Maryland,
in fruit and hop picking on the Paciﬁc Coast, on cotton planta-
tions in the South, in grain and general farming in Western states,
countless children earn less than a dollar a day, in spite of
working “from sun—up to sun-down” on long summer days.

In the Colo-rado beet ﬁelds where the big sugar companies
have grown rich from the exploitation of child workers, a worker
and his whole family are hired for the season at a speciﬁed rate
per acre. In the spring and summer of 1932, a drastic cutfrom
$23 down to $15 and even $13 in the rate paid per acre, resulted
in a two months’ strike of 18,000 beet workers, including the
children. The Colorado Labor Advocate reported that 95% of
all Colorado beet workers went on strike. This heroic struggle
of miserably paid agricultural workers, many of them Mexicans,
called attention to the conditions under which they live and

II

 

  

work. The beet worker’s child hardly knows what schoolinguis.
From the time he is a little tot he is taken out into the ﬁelds to
begin his slavery. Many of the Spanish—speaking children never
have a chance to learn English, or even to learn to read or write
in their own language. (For further information on long hours
of work and the effect on the health of boys and girls, see Youth
in Industry, International Pamphlets, No-.13.) V
Through decades of struggle, workers’ organizations have forced
the adoption of laws in some states for the protection of child

workers, but even such laws as stand on the books are constantly '

violated. During 1933, the fourth year of crisis, when millions
of grown—up workers were looking for jobs, employers were openly
ignoring the child labor laws or were trying, with the help of the
state governments, to break down existing laws.

The Fight to End Child Labor

Workers’ organizations in their ﬁght for the abolition of child
labor include the demand that all children under I4 now working
shall receive state maintenance in order to prevent their being
drawn back into industry. Working class families, in their bitter
struggle for bread, often depend largely on the slender earnings
of these child workers. Only a subsidy from the state paid to
the family in place of the child’s labor will make it possible for
these children to stay in school. This demand by workers’ organi-
zations for state maintenance of children under 14, to be taken
out of industry, is a basic demand to be pushed in every shop
and center where there is child labor. _

Workers point out the fact that there are thousands of younger
children under 14 now at work,—far more than the 235,000
revealed by the 1930 Census. There are thousands of little chil-
dren in agriculture not included in the enumeration. There are
all those under IO years old not even counted by the Census.
These thousands must be removed from industry and maintained
by the state, so that their earnings are made good to the working
class family.

With the workers’ program of demands for the abolition of
child labor under 14, and for state maintenance of these child

I2

 

 

 

 

 

workers, goes the demand for the 6-hour day, 5-day week, with
no night work, for all young workers under 18. But with these
greatly shortened hours, wages for all young workers under 18
must be on the basis of equal pay for equal work, with no piece

work.

_Other demands of workers’ youth organizations include the fol-
lowing: no work in dangerous occupations; no speed-up; the
establishment of work schools in factories for the training of

‘young workers, these schools to be controlled by the workers and

full wages to be paid during attendance; an annual four weeks’
vacation with pay for all workers under 18.

Negro Workers’ Children

From the time of his birth on, the Negro working class child
has an even harder life than the white working class child.

In every state the death rate for Negro babies is higher than
for white babies, because the Negro fathers’ earnings are lower,
and the family is therefore at an even greater economic disad-
vantage. Thus, where the infant death rate for native white
babies is 93.9 out of every thousand babies born alive, and the
general rate for all babies is 110.0, for Negro babies the rate is
152.3 out of every thousand. And in Negro just as in white
families, the more money the fathers earn, the fewer babies die.

Unemployment, with all its terrible effects on the lives of
Workers and their children, is even worse among Negroes than
among white workers. Starvation among countless Negro children
is the result. Diseases of poverty such as malaria, pellagra and
tuberculosis, developing from lack of food and from other condi-
tions of unemployment, show higher death rates for Negro than
for white workers and their families.“ And growing children
even more than grown-ups suffer from these starvation diseases.

No one knows how many thousands of Negro children have
died either from starvation itself or from the diseases that result
from undernourishment. Often in southern agricultural states a

- Negro child dies because there is no Negro physician within reach

and the white physician will not come to a Negro’s house.
In schooling, Negro childrenin southern states never have an

A Negro unemployed worker’s shack on the banks of the East River in
the heart of New York City '
equal opportunity with white children, and in northern cities also
there is discrimination against the Negro Working class in the
matter of school buildings, teaching staff and the educational
standards required. A recent study by the National Education
Association reveals the difference in school expenditures for Negro
children and for white children in many sections of the country:

In South Carolina, for example, the annual expenditures for educa-
tion is $4.48 per child for Negro children and $45.45 per child for
white children.‘ In Georgia, where the Negro population is 36.8% of
the total, the ﬁgures are $7.44 per year for the Negro child against
$35.34 for the white child. Mississippi spends $9.34 for the Negro
child and $42.17 for the white child, while the ﬁgures for Florida are
respectively $11.41 and $75.07.

Negro boys and girls at work in various kinds of child labor
are paid even less than White boys and girls. The lumber and
furniture industry employs more Negro children than any other
large child—employing manufacturing industry, and their jobs are
always the worst and lowest paid. In “domestic service,” of the

I4

 

 

 

boys and girls under 16 working as servants and waiters, more
than a third are Negro children.

In cotton and tobacco ﬁelds of the South thousands of those
who bend for hours over thenpicking of cotton or the wo_rming
of tobacco are Negro boys and girls. They work longer hours
than white children doing the same kind of work,—a fact revealed
by a special study of child labor in Texas cotton ﬁelds. More
than half‘ of these Negro children missed school to pick cotton.

The average daily hours ranged from 9.3 among the children of

white owners to 11.3 among the children of Negro owners. The Negro
children worked consistently longer hours than the white children.7

When out of work and hunting for jobs, Negro boys are picked
up and arrested for “vagrancy,” and often framed-up, charged
with more serious “crimes” of which they are entirely innocent.
Thus, the nine Scottsboro boys, two of them only I4 years old,
riding a freight train on their way to look for work, were charged
with raping two white girls and sentenced to die in the electric
chair. Seven of them were held for nearly two years in the death

house of Kilby prison, Alabama, and only the International Labor_

Defense, mobilizing workers all over the world in defense of the
boys, has saved them thus far from electrocution. Ruby Bates,
one of the main witnesses against the boys, repudiated her testi-
mony as forced from her by the sheriffs.

In the struggle against such conditions as these and for com- .

plete social, economic and political equality for all Negro workers
and their families, the Communist Party, the Young Communist
League and the Young Pioneers are leading the way. These
working class organizations are demanding that there shall be
no discrimination against Negro Workers or their children in any
ﬁeld of work or of social life. What complete Negro liberation
will mean is explained in two pamphlets by James S. Allen, The
American Negro and Negro ‘Liberation. (International Pamph-
lets, Nos. 18 and 29.)

Child Misery Increases

Thrust out of the capitalist schools to hunt for jobs while
their bodies are still but half grown, these child workers, Negro

I5

   

and white, ﬁnd their homes broken up by the relentless pressure
of capitalism. What was true for many thousands of working
class families even‘ during so-called “normal” times has been in-
tensiﬁed by the crisis until it has involved millions. The effect
of this period on workers’ children is beyond words to describe.

Young bo-ys of I2 and younger have taken to the road and are
“riding the freights”—-looking for jobs that are not to be found,
homeless, hungry, exposed to disease and accidents, always told to
“move on, move on.” These transient boys, from practically
every state in the Union, number from 250,000 to 300,000 and
the numbers are increasing each month. I

Capitalist programs for the “solution” of this homeless youth
problem include herding the boys into camps where they will
be required to do forced labor, and recruiting for the army or the

navy those who are considered physically ﬁt. According to the

Cutting bill, now (March, 1933) under consideration in congres-

sional committees, $15,000,000 wo-uld be provided for the “care”,

of these boys in military camps. General Pelham D. Glassford,
who was chief of police in Washington whenthe bonus marchers
were driven out, is actively pushing the bill for the militarization

‘ of these homeless youths.

Not only these boys who are “riding the rods,” but countless
numbers of younger children have been taken from their homes
because their parents were jobless and penniless. The number of
children placed in institutions throughout the country increased
48% between July, 1930, and October, 1932, according to Dr.
C. C. Carstens of the Child Welfare League of America. In New
Jersey, .an increase of I87% in the number of children accepted
for care by the state between January 1, 1930, and January I,
1932, was reported by J. Prentice Murphy of the same organiza-
tion.

An eviction, putting the worker and his family on the street,
with all their possessions, is often carried out when the children
are ill. And evictions are increasing. In ﬁve industrial cities
of Ohio, for example, evictions increased from 26,900 in 1930,

and 27,600 in 19.31 to about 35,000 in 1932. Similar increases '

were reported in New York City and other centers. In the

record of one year’s evictions in Chicago there were more than
26,000 children in the families evicted.

As a result of strain and anxiety in the families of the jobless,
growing boys and girls only I4 or 15 years old have committed
suicide or attempted to do so. Here is an example of a child
suicide:

Eugene Olsen, 16 years old, a senior at George Washington High
School, standing high in his classes and especially interested in scien-
tiﬁc subjects, committed suicide by hanging himself with a dumbwaiter
cord in the basement of a New York tenement house in June, 1932.
The father, a carpenter, had been out of work for several months.
Unable to pay rent, the family had been evicted and were occupying
a basement storeroom rent-free. The father said the only reason he
could give for the boy’s suicide was worry over their ﬁnancial condi-
tion. (Based on a New York Times news item, June 6, 193,2.)

Starving to Death

In November, 1930, the White House Conference on Child
Health and Protection admitted that out of more than 40,000,000
children in the United States, at least 6,000,000 were improperly
nourished. How these ﬁgures on undernourishment and ill-health
have multiplied during the crisis may be seen from the following
examples:

Since 1930 the number of cases of malnutrition in the New
York City schools has increased more than 33%, rising steadily
from 13.5% in I929 to 20.5% in 1932. More than a ﬁfth of all
school ‘children in the world’s richest city are now suffering from
slow starvation. In Brooklyn the number of undernourished
children has doubled in the past year. 0

In Pennsylvania the increase in undernourishment runs from
10% three years ago to 28% in 1932, according to Mrs. Helen
Glenn Tyson, Assistant Deputy of Welfare in the state. She
stated in January, 193 3 , that 20 to 40% of the school children in
certain districts were reported as malnourished and 75% as suf-
fering from some form of physical defect.

In the mining districts of West Virginia and Kentucky, investi- ,

gators found that “9I% of the children in the most destitute
areas were seriously undernourished.” This fact was revealed in

A an appeal for relief funds in January, 1933, by the Federal Coun-

cil of Churches, quoting the American Friends Service Committee
and other conservative sources.

Eating out of garbage pails has become a daily fact for countless
thousands of workers and\ their children in practically every city
of the United States. And when children eat from garbage
dumps disease and death are the results. Here is a true story of
four children who lived in New York City, in the streets below

- the handsome skyscrapers. It is told in a letter from a municipal

hospital sent to the executive secretary of the Children’s Welfare
Federation in the early autumn of 1932:

We have had for a long time now, people coming in to us asking
for food and stating that they have not eaten for several days, and it
can be seen by their appearance that they aretelling the truth. This
week we have had four children admitted with the diagnosis of starva-
tion. One, who was found eating out of a garbage can, has died since
admission. Another infant of three months is about to die. The
mother was feeding it sugar and water. (Our emphasis. G. H.)

Total lack of unemployment insurance in the United States
means that jobless workers and their children are at the mercy of
relief agencies,'doling out the smallest possible amount each week,
often not enough to keep the children alive. That relief in Penn-
sylvania, usually between $2 and $4 a week for a family, repre-

sents only a “starvation diet” was admitted by Mrs. Helen Glenn

Tyson of the state Department of Welfare in her testimony before
the Senate Committee hearings on the federal relief bill in
January, 1933. Welfare ofﬁcials in New York City have made
similar admissions. . o

How It Might Be

. There is a country without unemployment. A country where
a worker who cannot work because he is ill or growing old is
never afraid of losing the job, is never penniless or forgotten. A
country where a woman can take a few months away from work
to have a baby and receive her regular wages for the job that is
still hers when she returns. A country where the welfare of
children is a ﬁrst consideration. The full name of this country
is the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics.

Since the Revolution of October, 1917, a wide network of
day nurseries, kindergartens and children’s playgrounds has been

established in this land where the workers rule. About IO mil— .

lion children between the ages of three and seven are cared for
in these institutions,—seven times the ﬁgure of two years ‘ago.
No wo-rker fro-m a capitalist country can visit the Soviet Union
without being deeply impressed by the day nurseries for children
in or near each industrial plant. These nurseries are run by
qualiﬁed educational workers, with a nurse in attendance, and
are usually housed in the mansion of the former Czarist factory
owner,—now given over to workers’ children, and always beauti-
fully clean, sunny and attractive. The nursery is so near the
plant that the young babies’ mothers can come over easily for the
half-hour nursing period, always arranged for the women workers.
The mother is relieved from the strain of any double burden,

because her working hours are only -seven a day; the older chil-

dren get their midday meal provided at school; the factory
kitchens and the cooperative restaurant provide the worker’s
meals at low prices; there is a laundry to which her washing is
sent; and housework is reduced to a minimum. She is protected

by a full and complete system of social insurance, including mater-
nity beneﬁts. '

The number of children in the elementary schools of the
U.S.S.R. has grown from 10,000,000 in 1928 to- 19,000,000 in
1932. ,The introduction of compulsory elementary education is
being completed. In the cities, 100% o-f the children are attend-

ing schools and in the villages about 90%, as compared with only .

47% in 1915.

By 1934, it is expected that all illiteracy will have been wiped
out in the Soviet Union. Literacy among the population has
grown from 67% in 1930 to 90% in 1932. Before the Revolution
only 13% of the population were literate.

Results of the general concern for children’s welfare and social
education are seen in the appearance of the children playing on
the streets. The New York Times correspondent, Walter Dur-
anty, writing from Moscow in February, 1933, describes their
health and happiness:

The writer is prepared to state that there is no city of 4,000,000
inhabitants in the world in which the children are healthier and happier
than in the Soviet c_apital. . . . The chief reason is doubtless that
Moscow has no slums like Western cities—no dark, airless courts and
human rabbit warrens. . . .\In the winter which brings gloom to chil-
dren in most European cities, Moscow children play everywhere on
skates and sleds. No family, it seems, is too poor to afford either or
both. . . . No one interferes with the children or prevents them from
playing almost everywhere. . . . Russian children rarely cry and sel-
dom ﬁght. . . . When they sing, which they do continually, they are
invariably in tune. And one may see a dozen Russian‘ children between
6 and I2 taking inﬁnite pains to teach a babe of one or two how
to sing. ‘

Child labor does not exist in the wo-rkers’ republic. The few
young workers, I4 to 16 years old, who are allowed by special
permission of the Soviet Department of Labor to spend four
hours a day in the shop, with four hours in the factory school,
are paid for eight hours’ work. This experience in the shop as
a vocation.al school, carefully regulated to alternate with classroom
hours, is part of the youth’s training for future work. No-t
until he is 18 years of age is a young worker allowed to work
seven hours a day,—the adult working day in most industries.

The Struggle Against Child Misery

In the United States, on the other hand, as We have seen, not
only child labor but child misery and starvation are common in
workers’ families in every part of the country. Homes are un-
heated in Winter and stiﬂing and airless in summer. Malnutrition
increases faster than capitalist statisticians can tabulate it. Babies
die for lack of milk.

In the face of these terriﬁc conditions, workers’ organizations
have to carry on an unceasing struggle -against starvation and the
other conditions of poverty that affect the children of the working
class. Children’s hunger marches during the winter of 1932-33
brought the situation sharply to the attention of the ﬁnancial
rulers and their servants in the state and federal administrations.
Under the initiative of militant working class organizations——the
Unemployed Councils, the Workers International Relief and the
Young Pioneers of America, with the support of the workers’

tional Relief station during a recent coal miners’ strike in Pennsylvania.

political organization, the Communist Party—a campaign is being
carried on to ﬁght against child misery. All workers’ organizations
and sympathetic groups are called upon to support this campaign
and to give attention to organizing the children of their members.

These organizations emphasize the struggle for unemployment
insurance as the most important of all immediate demands for
the protection of working class children. In the Workers’ Unem-
ployment Insurance Bill they propose federal unemployment in-
surance, at full average wages, to be paid for by the employers
and by the government and administered by co-mmittees elected
by the Workers. Other forms of social insurance are included
in the Workers’ bill, which demands that social insurance be paid
to Workers to the amount of full wages to compensate for loss of
wages through sickness, accident, old age or maternity.

This campaign of Working class organizations is in direct op-
position to the plans of capitalist organizations in their continual
propaganda to win the workers’ children for the support of the

ZI

   

capitalist system. Much is said in the general press about concern
for child welfare, and the illusion is created that capitalism itself
is combating child misery. Bourgeois children’s organizations are
increasing in number and in membership. The Girl Scouts, for
example, increased its membership fro-m 262,000 to 300,000, in
the year between 1931 and 1932. The Boy Scouts grew from
625,000 to 870,000 in the sameiperiod. Such organizations as
these are interested in training children to become soldiers of

, capitalism,—ready to shoot down workers in a strike, ready for

imperialist warfare, ready to attack the workers’ state, the Soviet
Union. ‘

The Young Pioneers of America, on the other hand, is a work-
ing class children’s ‘organization which brings ‘workers’ children
together in troops all over the country. ‘Negro and white, foreign-
born and American-born, girls and boys, city children and farm
children, are united in these‘ troops for the common struggle
against child labor, against all the conditions of capitalism that
now close every door to the children of the working class. “A1-
ways ready” is the motto of the Young Pioneers. They publish
an illustrated magazine for the boys and girls of the workers
and farmers, called the New Pioneer, a lively, interesting paper
which should be in the home of every working class family.

Children alone cannot carry on the ﬁght for bread, for milk,
for clothes, for books, for better schools, nor the long ﬁght against
child labor. They are too young, too inexperienced and the con-
ditions under which they suffer are the result of general working
conditions, of wage standards and of poverty affecting the entire
working class. Children of the workers will really come into a
full and joyous life only when the capitalist system is overthrown
and a workers’ government established. But meanwhile, where
determined efforts have been made by all workers acting together,
children and grown-ups, the struggle has brought some immediate
results. ‘

In Chicago, for example, in October, 1932, a mighty demon-
stration of 20,000 workers, men, women and youth, forced the
authorities to withdraw the 50% relief cut. One month after
the cut was announced it was withdrawn.

-At City Hall, New York City, a thousand children, many of
them Young Pioneers, demonstrated with their parents, carrying
empty milk bottles on which were painted in red: “Fill these up.”
As a result of this demonstration free school lunches were con-
tinued in many of the city schools where lunches had been
stopped.

In Cleveland, Ohio, a committee of the workers went to the
dairymen and secured from 800 to 1,000 quarts of milk to be
given out each day, free of charge, for the children in working
class neighborhoods.

These are only a few examples of successful struggles. What
has been done in part in certain localities can be done on a
broader front and with greater success. Every worker and every
worker’s child should be included in the mass movement for the
protection of children. Hunger will not wait. There is no time
to lose.

CHILDREN UNDER CAPITALISM

BY GRACE HUTCHINS

Two C'hildren—Tw0 Classes

I SAW a baby. die of undernourishment. His father is a long-
shoreman, earning 67 cents an hour, but he has only a few

3 hours’ work in the week. The family live in two basement rooms

and the sun never shines into ‘rooms below the city sidewalks.

Milk was what the baby needed, but there wasn’t any. The
older children are thin, undersized, white-faced. But the baby’s’
face took on the expression of a little old man’s, lined, colorless,
withered like a dry leaf. Day by day through the ﬁrst sixmonths,
when a healthy baby would have gained steadily in weight, this
child lost. His ankle was no bigger around than a grown-up
person’s thumb-. His worried mother left the. other children to

look out for themselves, and took the baby outdoors to get what -

sunshine there is in a city street. But it was of no use. He
died. And was buried in a box two feet long.

Lucy Cotton Thomas is 7 years old and lives at 995 Fifth
Ave., New York City. Her father was a wealthy sportsman,
banker and publisher, and her grandfather made millions out of
the labor done by workers on low wage rates. Lucy has a yearly
income of more than $80,000 from a trust fund set up by her
grandfather, and her mother claimed in a petition to the Surrogate
Court that the child needs over $3,000 a month for living ex-
penses. These expenses include $800 a month for rent; $325 for
chauffeur, maid service and incidentals; $600 for food for her-
self, her mother and the servants; $400 for miscellaneous expenses
(French, music and dancing lessons, books, ‘ﬂowers, stationery,
etc.), and other amounts bringing the total up to more than
$3,000. The court granted the little millionaire an allowance of

_ $36,000 for the year or practically $100 a day. (New York

Times, February 8, I93 3.)

Such contrasts between the situation of children in workers’
families and in leisure-class families have long been typical of
capitalism in the United States, as in other countries, but the
contrasts have now been greatly sharpened by the economic
crisis.

Today after four crisis years, in the families of nearly 17,000,-
ooo jobless workers, countless numbers of children are keeping
themselves alive only by what they get fro-m garbage cans. Others
are dying of starvation. A quarter of a million boys in their
teens, I2 to 20 years old, are homeless Wanderers, uncared-for,
moving from town to town, in search of food and a place to
sleep. Over 3,ooo,oco children of school age, 7 to 17, are not in
school. Over 2,000,000 of these boys and girls, deprived of school
advantages, are at work in factories, mines, or in the ﬁelds, pro-
ducing wealth for the rich and their children to enjoy.

Children of the capitalist class are thus literally fattening off
the bodies of workers’ children. Nourishment which should go to
a working class b-oy or girl, goes instead to the child of a parasite,
and more than mere nourishment,——an excess of good things b-e-
yond all the normal needs of a child. What is a parasite? The
dictionary gives this deﬁnition, exactly ﬁtting the capitalist who
feeds and cares for himself and his children out of the wealth
created not by himself but by the workers and their children:

A parasite, one who eats at the table of another. . . . A plant or
animal living in, on, or with some other living organism (called its
host) at whose expense it obtains its food, shelter or the like.

Two classes. Capitalist class children, drinking all the milk
they need, eating fresh vegetables and other good food, sleeping
in quiet, airy rooms, playing in the sunshine, secure, protected
from disease and accidents and anxiety, provided with the best
teachers and the best schools, receiving all that children need for
health and general welfare. ‘

Working class boys and girls, many of them without enough
milk to drink, Without proper clothing, without sunshine, without
a safe place to play, without any of the things doctors and edu-
cational experts advise for the health and welf.are of children.

Children of two classes.‘ And the great majority of the 43,-
000,000 children under 18 in the United States (Census of 1930)
are children of the working class.

Workers’ Children at Home

“Every baby should be born under circumstances which insure
a healthy and vigorous start in life,” state the child health asso-
ciations and the child welfare specialists.

. a room should be given up to the exclusive use of the baby,
since it is hard to give him the quiet he should have in a room that
must be used also by other members of the family. . . . A bright
sunny room should be chosen for the nursery. . . .

A very young baby should sleep from 20 to 22 hours out of the
24. . . . He should always sleep in a bed by himself. . . .

Sunlight is necessary for the proper growth of a baby. . . . If the
baby does not get enough direct sunlight and cod-liver oil, his bones
will not develop normally, his muscles will be ﬂabby, and his skin will
be pale. He will probably have rickets}

How impossible it is to give the child such quiet and such
sunshine, working class p.arents know only too well. The worker’s
child starts his existence already handicapped in the race of life.
His mother is worn down by a great burden of work, not only
housework but often ‘work outside the home also. The home is
dark, overcrowded, and the child cannot possibly have clean sun-
shine, a quiet room or a bed to himself.

Nor can the working class family possibly afford the food that
should be provided for every child. Here is the list of what a
child, between one and six years old, should have to eat and drink:

Milk is an essential part of every child’s diet. The average child
should receive a pint and a half daily. Some children grow best if they
receive a quart a day. . . . Fruit once or twice a day. . . . One or
more fresh vegetables a day. . . . A “starchy vegetable” once a day.
. . . An egg daily. . . . A serving of meat or ﬁsh daily by the time
the child is 18 months old. . . . Cereal once or twice a day. . . .
Bread and butter two or three times a day. . . . Cod-liver oil daily
(for those under two).

For lack of milk and of these other necessary foods, workers’
children are dying by the hundreds in this rich country. The

5

 

  
 

U. S. Children’s Bureau has madestudies of infant deaths under

one year old in many "different cities and states and has revealed

that in low-wage working class families nearly three times as
many babies die as in the families of the well-to-do.’ The more
money the fathers earn, the fewer babies die.

As the child grows out of babyhood he needs constant care
and attention, but what can a working class mother do when
she must go out to work herself and has no relative with whom
to leave the young children?

Some parents are forced to leave their small children in over-
crowded “day nurseries.” However, most of these nurseries,
whether run by so-me settlement house, religious mission, or other
agency, have no full-time trained teacher service, no skilled serv-
ice of any kind, and the food is poor. Even for this kind of a
day nursery, the parents must pay from 5 to 25 or even 50
cents a day? '

Hot, breathless city tenements in the summer breed disease and
death. Workers and their families often spend the nights on
tenement house roofs, only to see the children lie awake through
the night in the heat and noise. Meanwhile the city houses and
spacious apartments of the ruling class stand cool and empty
through the hot months, while the parents take their children to
summer homes by the seashore or in the mountains.

To secure for their children the food and other necessaries of
life that all children need, working class parents are demanding
wage increases and are heroically ﬁghting against the employers’
drive to cut Wages in these crisis years. Those who have jobs
and those who have not are uniting to demand immediate cash
relief for the unemployed and a complete system of unemploy-
ment and social insurance for all workers to protect them and
their families against starvation and the ravages of unemployment.

Millions Not in School

i All children of school age in the United States supposedly have
a right to an education. But the fact is that 3,326,152 children
of school age, fro-m 7 to 17, inclusive, are not in school. (Census
of 1930.) Where are they and what are they doing?

6

 

 

 

These boys and girls who ought to be in school, but are not,
are mostly in the southern states and many of them are already
at work, as we shall see. Do the employers and their state and
city governments, then, increase the expenditures for education
and attempt to absorb into the schools these 3,000,000 and more
who haven’t an opportunity for an education? Far from it.
Instead they are reducing the school budgets in every state,
North as well as South, slashing the expenditures for new school
buildings and other equipment, cutting down teachers’ salaries,
doubling up classes and in many communities closing down all
schools. The U. S. Children’s Bureau sums up the situation, in
a statement issued January I, 1933:

In a steadily increasing number of communities, the public schools
. . . have closed their doors, thus denying children the right toan
education. In many more, school budgets have been so cut that one
after another activity has been abandoned.

The National Survey of School Finance reports that “more
than a third of the school children in the United States are being
deprived of essential instruction.” It estimates that about 9, 500,-
000 pupils are receiving inadequate instruction and the standards
for millions of other children are endangered.

In Arkansas, 26 schools have been entirely abandoned, and in

four out of ﬁve counties the school terms were cut short, it is I

admitted by the Ofﬁce of Education in the U. S. Department
of the Interior. The New York state aid for the common schools
is reduced by about $9,000,000. Similar reductions have been
put through in other states.

This further narrowing down of school facilities, already inade-
quate before the crisis broke, affects not only the children but
also the teachers who are themselves exploited as wage workers
under the capitalist system. (A fuller discussion of the whole
school situation will be found in a forthcoming pamphlet on
schools to be issued in this International Pamphlets series.)

In the face of this general reduction in expendituresfor educa-
tion, workers through their various organizations are demanding
of the state and city governments that additional funds be made

available for new schools to be built in working class neighbor-
hoods. All dangerous ﬁre-trap school buildings should be de-
stroyed. Free books and free school supplies should be furnished
for all workers’ children. Hot school lunches should be provided
free for the children of the unemployed.

What Child Workers Are Doing

I worked beside a child slave in a tobacco factory in New
York City. He was not yet 15 years old, and under the state
law he was supposed to work only eight hours a day, 44 hours
a week. But the law did not worry the big American Tobacco
Co., making its stupendous proﬁts each year. If a state inspector
came around during the day, he chatted with the superintendent,
received a box of the best cigars, and departed without inquiring
about law violations. H H

The boy was undersized and so thin that his clothes hung on
him as if his body was a stick with cross—bars for arms. His
face was colorless, naturally, because he never saw the sunlight
except on Sundays. He came into the plant with the rest of us
at 7 A.M. and left it about 6 P.M., was on his feet all day, carry-
ing bundles of tobacco leaves to feed the machines, and during
the noon three-quarters of an hour, he tried to learn how to
roll cigars in order to earn more money. He was a typical child
laborer. ‘

With thousands of children like this boy, the army of child
workers under 17 in the United States now numbers 2,145,959,
about one-third of whom are girls and two—thirds boys. (Census
of 1930.) Over 660,000 of these children are from IO to I 5
years old, in other words under 16, while more than 235,000 are
under I4. But the census ﬁgure is a serious understatement of
child employment, since it does not include the children under I0
years old. Nor does the census say anything about the great
numbers of children in seasonal agriculture, such.as beet cultiva-
tion, truck-gardening and fruit-picking, whose work does not begin
until after April I, the date on which the census was taken.

Even without including thousands of children in seasonal agri-
culture, the census lists nearly half a million children as farm

laborers. Here are the ﬁgures on the numbers of boys and girls
under 16 at work in the United States:

While much is said in the capitalist press about the decrease in
child labor between 1920 and 1930, the U. S. Children’s Bureau
admits frankly that this decline “cannot be considered as perma-
nent. . . . Children will doubtless be again drawn into industry
in large numbers. . . .” Two states, Georgia and South Carolina,
actually increased the number of children under 16 employed in
manufacturing industries between 1920 and 1930. In Georgia
the increase was over 5% and in South Carolina it was nearly
2 3%.

In some industrial plants, especially in the clothing industries,
more than one-ﬁfth of the operating force are children under 16
years.’

Nothing is said in the census about the great numbers of
children who must work outside of school hours in the late after-
noon, evening and early morning, in most cases forced by neces-
sity to try to add a few cents to the family income. About 10%
or one in every 10 of all school children under 16 are so employed,
