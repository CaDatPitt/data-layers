The Program

|—N EUTRALITY

STRONGER neutrality legislation providing for man-
datory embargoes on munitions, loans, credits and
essential materials of warfare to belligerents when war
breaks out in any area. i

The U. S. can keep out of a prolonged general War
only by preventing its citizens from becoming involved
economically and ﬁnancially. The enormous stake which
American bankers and traders had iii the success of the
Allies was a primary factor in drawing this country
into the World War. From 1912 to 1916 our trade with
the Allies jumped over 300%, in volume, whereas our
trade with the Central Powers fell in the same period to
1/100 of its previous volume. Because of its immense
resources, the U. S. is in a strategic position to furnish
or deny War supplies.

The present neutrality law is inadequate. There is a
general concensus of opinion among peace groups that
far stronger neutrality legislation should be enacted at
once. It is not enough to place embargoes on only
munitions and credits to warring nations. Raw mate-
rials are essential sinews of War. Cotton is a necessity
for the manufacture of high explosives——and oil is as
vital as bullets. Now is the time to establish categories
of embargoes before any substantial war trade has
arisen.

The Emergency Peace Campaign, while recognizing
that there is a difference of opinion at this point, favors
mandatory legislation, because:—-

(1) The present permissive bill gives the President
too much power to control embargoes over
commodities, and vests in him an indirect war-
making power which constitutionally belongs
to Congress.

(2) Mandatory embargoes would relieve the pres-
sure of special sections and interests upon the
President and the State Department in a crisis.

(3) If neutrality legislation is mandatory, the im-
position of embargoes could not be construed
as an unfriendly act to any nation.

l|—M|L|TARY AND NAVAL POLICY

EVISION by the American government of its mili-

tary and naval policy so that it will be restricted
to the protection of continental United States against
invasion as a ﬁrst step toward universal total disarm-
ament.

Authorities list the competitive race in armaments as
one of the primary causes of the World War. Suspi-
cion, fear and hostility are engendered inevitably by a
campaign of armed preparedness. Increases in arm-
aments in one land are viewed with alarm across the
border or across the sea. Every such addition is used
by militarists at home as proof that heavier appropria-
tions for their own army and navy are necessary.

Military and naval appropriations in the United
States for 1937 total more than a billion dollars, not
including provision for the construction of two huge
battleships, already authorized, to cost ﬁfty-two million
dollars each.

The United States has joined the race in armaments.
With nations armed to the teeth, there can be no calm,
peaceful settlement of controversies. The World be-
comes a powder barrel.

We oppose the “fundamental policy” of our navy
department as officially announced of “maintaining a
navy in suﬂicient strength to defend our interests, com-
merce and overseas possessions.” We also oppose such
manifestations of this policy as more battleship con-
struction and provocative naval demonstrations.

American people are opposed to sending American
troops abroad to ﬁght a foreign war again. By de-
manding the right to protect American interests in
every part of the world, the United States will become
automatically involved wherever conﬂict breaks out.

The State Department has announced its Pan-Ameri-
can Goodwill policy, which states that we will not use
armed force to protect our interests in Latin—American
countries. Investments made in those countries must
be made at the investor’s own risk. This policy should
be extended to all the world.

|||—ECONOM|C ADJUSTMENTS

EASING of international tensions through reciprocal
trade agreements including all nations and through
calling international conferences to consider stabiliza-
tion of currencies and the problem of facilitating access
to raw materials and markets for all nations.

(A) The policy underlying reciprocal trade agree-
ments attacks the evils of economic nationalism and
high tariﬁ’ barriers which close trade channels.

Through these agreements the United States offers
one of the largest import markets in the world to na-
tions who will reduce their tariffs in a like manner.

 

 

T_hese trade agreements are made between two
nations on individual items and forbid the raising of
tariffs on large classes of goods.

The gain in tariff reductions made between individual
countries is extended to all nations.

This program has-

(1) Shown _the ﬁrst breakdown of nationalistic
economic policies.

(2) Reduced tariffs after careful study for the ben-
efit of the consumers, workers, farmers, busi-
ness men.

(3) Increased exportation of products we best pro-
duce and increased importation of goods too
costly for us to produce economically.

(4) Assured our buying more goods abroad in
order that we may sell more of our own goods
abroad—a sound economic policy.

(5) Readjusted tariff barriers gradually so that
industries and community employment will be
safeguarded.

(B) Countries must be assured of access to raw ma-
terials and markets to provide for the welfare of their
people. These changes must be made if a general war
is to be avoided.

At an economic conference nations can state publicly
Ehlelir real aims and needs so that adjustments can
0 ow.

The countries controlling the major portion of the
world’s economic resources must take the initiative in
making these adjustments, so that less favored nations
will not feel compelled to seek their necessities through
war.

|V—MUN|T|ONS

TAXING the proﬁts out of war and the preparation
for war, and nationalizing the munitions industry.

Private manufacture of munitions was shown by the
Nye investigating committee to mean constant pressure
on our government for increased armaments. Proﬁts
made were enormous. Almost three million dollars
proﬁt was made on one destroyer in peace time.

Munition makers admitted fostering armament com-
petition in South America to promote sales. Govern-
ment control would eliminate these unfriendly acts of
American citizens.

Government control of munitions would lessen the
incentive for constantly increasing armaments, and thus
relieve the taxpayer.

In case of war, private citizens would not be able to
ship arms and munitions to warring nations and thus
it would be easier for the United States to be neutral.

This is not a new idea. It is rooted in the funda-
mental base of our laW——the Justinian Code issued four-
teen centuries ago. This code forbade the manufacture
or control of weapons by “private persons”. France
has just pointed the way by voting to nationalize her
munition industries.

V—CONSCR|PT|ON

OPPOSITION to the enactment of any universal
draft laws conscripting labor and all other man-
power, as advocated in the Industrial Mobilization Plan.

The Industrial Mobilization Plan, proposed by the
War and Navy Departments, provides—

(1) For automatically drafting all male citizens
between the ages of 18 and 45.

(2) For court martial in case any person “fails or
neglects fully to perform duty required of
him”. (This would make any form of effective
protest impossible.)

(3) That the nature of the emergency may be such
as to require employment of children under 16.

(4) For the recruiting of women for “duty with the
armed forces”.

(5) For establishing strict censorship of the press,
and controlling wages, hours of labor and
working conditions.

This mobilization plan sets up an actively operating
dictatorship under military control—-which is fascism.
There is no assurance that this control will be ended
when the emergency is over.

V|——|NTERNAT|ONAL CO-OPERATION

INTERNATIONAL cooperation for the settlement of
disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the
principles of the Kellogg Pact, including adherence to
the World Court.

International anarchy must be replaced by interna-
tional law. The United States should take an active
part with other nations in developing legal and orderly
procedure for settling international controversies.

This would include support of all peaceable forms of
international cooperation, including the International
Labor Office, the World Court, a reformed League of
Nations, automatic arbitration, conciliation, conference
and meditation.

RELATED ISSUES

In addition to the foregoing immediate Program for
Governmental Action to prevent war the Emergency
Peace Campaign calls upon all those who love freedom
and democracy to work for—

(1) The preservation of all political and civil lib-
erties;

(2) The repeal of the Oriental Exclusion Act and
extension of the quota system to immigrants
without discrimination based on race;

(3) Legislation granting immigration authorities
discretionary power to extend the right of
asylum to aliens within this country and to
political and religious refugees seeking en-
trance;

(4) The elimination of armed force in industrial
disputes, the enforcement of peonage laws and
adequate state and federal anti-lynching leg-
islation; A

(5) The abolition of compulsory military training
in civilian educational institutions.

All of these have an important bearing on the prob-
lem of war and peace.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

WORK diligently in your community to stimulate
serious thinking on these issues. Create and mobil-
ize positive peace opinion. Organize your community
to make it safe for peace. This is a ﬁrst step toward
keeping the nation at peace.

If you and the youth of your community are to be
spared the suffering and the agony of another war and
the destruction of material and moral values it will

bring, YOU MUST DO MORE THAN DISCUSS these “
issues with your friends. You must do something about ,

them. YOU MUST ACT!

Final decisions on these vital issues are made in
Washington by elected representatives of the people.
Visit your candidates for Congress.‘ Arrange delega-
tions to interview them. Question them on these issues.
Get their deﬁnite answers. Vote accordingly.

After the election keep constantly in touch with your
representatives. Give the mobilized opinion in your
community expression in the form of letters and reso-
lutions directed to the President, the Secretary of State,
your Senators and Representatives. i;

Remember——you are one of a sovereign people. You
must make your demands for peace known to those who
represent you—TO THOSE WHO CONTROL YOUR
DESTINY BY THEIR VOTES!

The peace records of Senators and Representatives
and questionnaires for use in interviewing condidates
may be obtained by writing to the
