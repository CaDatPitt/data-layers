noose REVOLUTIONARY umon MOVEMENT-

On Wednesday evening, July 15, James Johnson, Jr. responded to months of harassment and years of
oppression and shot to death two (2) foremen and one (1) job setter at the Eldon Ave. Gear and Axle Plant.
Dead were Hugh M. Jones 44, a black production foremen; Gary L. Hinz 32, a white production foreman;
and Joseph Kowalski, a white job setter.

Bro. James Johnson was a conveyor loader in Dept. 78, the Brake Shoe Dept., and had been so
employed for the past three (3) years.’-“Eldon Ave. Gear and Axle Plant, the home of ELRUM, has some of
the worst working conditions of any plant in existence. The plant is so unsafe that all of its 4,500
employers are risking their lives when they walk through the gates. in Dept 72, there is an inch and a half of
oil covering the floor of the aisles. The oil comes up over the soles of the workers shoes. The entire
ventialition system is inoperative. The jitney trucks have no brakes, lop sided tires, no horns and no lights.
The aisleways are blocked by skid boxes, axles and scrap iron. Drill presses, cutters and grinders do not have
safety guards. The management at Eldon is one of the most backward managements in town and totally
nonresponsive to the just cries of black workers. The plant is the only gear» and axle plant the Chrysler
Corporation has and is key to continued production of the entire Corporation. Unlike assemply plants
where lost production can be made up, overtime or lost time at Eldon means a slow down at assemply
plants. Working conditions are so bad that black foreman have been employed for over 10 years in order to
moderate racial conflict at the point of production. ’ A

All the hourly employees are represented by Local 961 of the U.A.W.—C.l.0. The union President is
Elroy Richardson a former black Vice-President who rode the tide of black consciousness to the presidency
in the spring of 1969. The local executive board consists of a group of loyal flunkeys in the service of every
qualm of the President. Local 961 is a backward local with none of the so-called reforms which some other
locals have. it has no education department and no good and welfare fund and the union hall is locked
more than open. Elroy Richardson is the only Local President out of over 3000 locals to attend the 22nd
Annual Constitutional Convention as a Sergeant-of-Arms in Atlantic City in April of this year.

For over the last six (6) months, the already oppressive conditions worsened with the increase in
layoffs and accompaning speed-ups of gear and axle production. The first open manifestation of these
conditions took place on April 16, 1970, on the midnight shift in Dept. 73,_‘when a white foreman named
Ervin Ashlock threatened to bash Bro. John Scotts head in with a pinnion gear. Scott than informed his

committeemen and the following nrocedure ended in the dischame of Bro. John Scott. Elroy Richardson
the Union President sent his union Stewards into the shop and ordered the workers out on a wildcat strike. The

strike lasted two (2) days and the President got cold feet and ordered the workers. back to work. Two weeks .

later Chrysler Corporation responded by discharging fourteen (14) Union Representatives and once again
the plant went on an unauthorized strike. This strike also lasted two (2) days and the workers were sent
back to work without any Union representation.

No Union Stewards were reinstated until about mid May which means the workers were forced to toil
without any representation what-so-ever. During this period the racist management at Eldon took extreme
advantage of the situation by arbitrarily forcing workers to perform two (2) jobs attempting to provoke
 to the breaking point. The workers had been beaten down and their spirits defeated by two (2)
._.:.;mccessful strikes. They had seen their Stewards discharged in mass and nothing was done about it and if

the Chrysler Corporation was bold enough to discharge fourteen (14) union representatives, it was obvious V

~ -.;ﬂ..,.v ~-r'- . . .  - .  .,-.‘..r‘  

that individual workers jobs meant nothing. Hope was gone and each worker feared arbitrary discharge for
disobeying foremen orders. It was this period of time that witnessed the death of two (2) black workers
raising out of harassment from the Medical Department and unsafe working conditions at Eldon. Sister
Mamiewilliams died in the hospital after being forced back to work by a Chrysler Corporation doctor which
was contrary to the orders of her private physicians who hadordered her to bed. Precisely two (2) weeks
later Gary Thompson, a 22 year old Vietnam war veteran, was crushed to death under a two (2) ton skid
box which fell off of his faulty jitney truck. On June 2, 1970, Gary Thompson was buried and both Local
961 and Chrysler Corporation responded merely by sending representatives’ to his funeral services. In the
weeks since the 1st of June, the Eldon management has continuedfts wanton arbitrary discharges and

9 suspensions while some of the discharged Stewards are still in the stree ‘S.

Needless to say, these are the precise and particular conditions under which Brother James Johnson
had tolled under in his last six months at Eldon Ave. Gear and Axle Plant. The events around his personal
existence as a black employee at Eldon is intricately intertwined with the overall obiective conditions

A 

mentioned above. James Johnson's dept. is Dept. 78 which is brake shoe dept. in which new conveyor belts .

were added in _ February. The new conveyor belt ran at such a rate that it threw brake shoes all over the
floor adding extra work for James Johnson, the conveyor loader on afternoon shift. On the afternoon shift
Dept. 78 is under Steward District 11 which is covered by Clarence Horton who ran unopposed in the last

election for steward. Clarence Horton represents three (33 departments:. 78 (brake shoe), 80 (brake C

assernblvl. and 83 (brake drum). Clarence Horton is a poor union steward who is not even very

knowledgeable of union procedure, he is a very poor spokesman and a loyal supporter of Elroy Richardson

the Union President. Clarence Horton was discharged along with thirteen .113) other stewards on May 1st,
and was not reinstated until the 2nd week in.June. For six=(6) weeks James Johnson was employed at

-Eldon with no union representation. in the éhrly part of Nlay, James Johnson was involved in an

automobile accident which resulted in the destruction of his automobile and him being placed under
doctors care. The medical officials at Eldon Ave. ordered him back to work over and above the
recommendation of his own private physicians. These-were the same officials who ordered Mamie Williams
back to work which lead to her death one week later." James had signed up for his vacation time for mid-
May. After being ordered back to work he left the plant on his two week vacation time which he had
previously been granted. James returned to work in the first week in June and was discharged without"
reason and his vacation pay was denied. At the time ofhis lst discharge his union steward was himself still
discharged. His first discharge was so flagrant that management was forced to reinstate him two (2) days
later on its own initiative. After his reinstatement James Johnson became the object of constant
surveillance and harassment. All of the foreman in Dept. 78 are merely highschool graduates and very
blatant and bold in the manner in whichthey exercise their authority. Management has set out consciously
to attempt to provoke James in committing an act for which they could discharge him.
/

On Wednesday evening, July 15, James Johnsonwas taken off of his job as conveyor loader and

replaced by a worker with two (2) weeks senority. He was then placed on the brake oveh job which consists

of placing brake shoes in bake ovens which bakes the coating on the brake shoes. The entire operationgis ‘i

done in J 120 degree heat. It was at this point that ’_Bro. James Johnson spoke out in protest of being
removed from his job. He was taken to labor relations office with his steward Clarence Horton and his
General Foreman Jim Rhoades at which point he was suspended for insubordination and told by his
steward to go along with their decisions. Management had reached its long awaited obeictive, they had
provoked Bro. James to speak out against his treatment. James Johnson was then escorted out of the plant
by plant protection guards. He returned shortly armed with a 30 caliber carbine in a disparate search for his

General Foreman Jim Rhoades. He supposedly asked all of his fellow workers to stand back for he was not j.
going to hurt them. In route in pursuit of James Rhoades he encountered his foreman, Hugh Jones; a
foreman in an adiacent dept., Gary Hinz; and a iobsetter who tried to disarm him. Johnson then supposedly

threw his weapon down saying, "l'm satisfied", and walked back to the guard shack where he was
apprehended by the Detroit Police Department.

Bro. James Johnson has moved the Black Workers struggle at the point of production to a new and
higher level. As we have stated over and over the oppressive and inhumane working conditions inside of the

auto industry coupled with the sellout and class-collaborationist unions have sparked open rebellions in '

basic industry. Often "times in the past black workers have been driven to the point where they could stand
no more and have lashed out viciously at their tormentors. In February of 1969, Bro. Rushie Forge was
driven to the breaking point and lashed out stabbing a black Labor Relations Representative, William
Young, at Dodge Main. Bro. Chuck Wooten reached his breaking point minutes after Rushie by stomping
Dick Prallie, a white General Foreman, in Dept. 9110 at Dodge  In August of 1969, Bro. Sid Lewis
was likewise driven to that point and lashed out at his foreman, Howard Lewis, in Dept. 9130 at Dodge
Main. in July of 1969, Bro. lke Jernigan, employed at Lockheed Aircraft in Los Angelos, California, lashed
outand shot and killed his foreman, his Union President, and another Union official. In September of 1969.
another black worker in Dept. 9150 at Dodge became outraged and locked his foreman in the trunk of a car
on the assembly line. - individual outrages at the point of production represent only one form in which the
struggle of black workers have taken. There have been individual acts of sabotage against property and all
forms of wildcat strikes and numerous caucases have been formed all in response to the monstrous
oppressive conditions that exist inside basic industry. As black workers rise up we have nothing to lose but
our chains, we have nothing to lose butouir iobs. our homes, our families and our future, our automobiles
and our television sets. The owners and opereters of the means of production owns our jobs, ourhornas.
and our families. We have neither security nor hope for the future. Theycontroi our places of employment,
the schools that our children attend, decide what our wages shail be, and what kind of society our children
wiii live in. They tell us when, where and how long  how hard we shall work. They own everything of
value. Brothers, they even think that_they own us. The owners and operators of the means of production
may cause one brother to lose his job, but they can’ fire one thousano‘. They can take away one 
home, and one rnanfs car; but they can't steai from  hundred thousand. They cant1oti'epos$es3 from one
million. They can wreck one family, but they  wre-sci: the unity of one million families. ‘fh»:=.-'s,.r can
enslave tliousarads, but they cannot ensiai.-re the unity of miliions. And they can defeat one armed 
biaak worker, but they cannot defeat a miliion armed i:si:.sci< workers or the uniiiesi mass of 20 miliion.

The League of Revolutionary Black Woricers represents the highest form of struggle which the
conscious insurgent movement of Black Labor has reached. Being guided by revolutionary principées and
striving to-unite all black workers we will certainly be victorious.

 PRODUCTION BEFORE SAFETY

    
 

On Friday at 1:45 a.m., July 17, there was an explosion in Dept 9110, the Body shop,  03
conditioning section. 10 workers were injured, 4 seriously. 6 were sent to Ford's hospital and 4  -bu
so badly that they were sent directly to Ann Arbor to have special treatment.

Management and Union officials knew that the leak had started on the dayshift on Thursday, but
production kept rolling, the management at Dodge knew that the gas was leaking but the line which was
_-ie_a,k_ing was the gas line which puts the gas in each air conditioning unit on the cars on the assembly line. To
' cutoff the gas main would mean the stopping of the assembly line. The lives and safety of workers 
a secondary consideration with production being at stake. Afternoon shift production stops at 3:00 our»
and management had decided to wait until then to repair the gas line. But between 1:00 am. and 1:45 am»
the explosion occured. One maintainence man was in a lift basket on a truck near the leaking valve

Friday, prior to the holiday, July 4th, strange ‘things developed in the Stock Dept. With the arrival of
Boy Wonder, Gary Roland, the departments over—rated Superintendent a maiorcrack down was announced.
Upon arrival Boy Wonder made it clear that he would break-up the militancy” in the department. But to his
surprise, his ancient plantation tactics did not work, for the dept. ‘did not have a strawboss which is badly
needed to execute'such out dated methods. So with the approval of" Labor Relation heads and Union

‘Officials, he moved to put his plan into operation. First by firing his white General Forman and than

replacing him withga black General Foreman. Next he built up the only black foreman in the dept. (3353)
as being a top notch supervisor (attempt: pitting one black against another) Last he mustered all the needed
information to insure Uncle John Smith's support on his racist acts and proceeded Itoexercise them. (J.
Smith - union plant committee man).  V V ’

On Friday, July 3rd-, the stock dept. asked for 55 volunteers for Sunday,..luly 5. By noon only 45
persons had voluntered. Boy Wonder, feeling the opportunity of success, moved to place a notice on the
boards that all personnel was ordered to show up. The workers became quite angry and began to protest.
Racist Roland still believing he was Hl-llC (head honky in charge} ordered his ioremen to inform the
workers that if they didn't show he would take their holiday pay. The Union was called, Labor Relations
was called, even Local No. 3 was called. The trap had been setnand the conspirators laid in wait for Sunday
morning. ' ‘ '   5"": ' R V

.Sunday, July 5th, out of a possible 150 workers. 28 workers failed to show. Among these workers
were a few militant leaders. The punk kid just could not resist this opportunity. So he called a conspirators
meeting early Sunday morning. After revealing to John Smith about his‘ past history - numbers loan shark,

and open graft, John Smith, Union Plant Committeeman agreed tosanction the Boy Wonders moves. To

show you how eager they were among the twenty eight, 6 were on vacation jand'4 were on sick leave.

Monday, July 6th, Roland signed the orders to hold up on the holiday pay. Wednesday, July..8th. a
list was submitted to a black labor representative for signature of approval. The brother refused not really
knowing what the hell was going on. As the trap tightened, thernore chicken herded this prick Roland
became. He moved for a meeting -Wednesady evening trying desperately to cover-up or shift the blame.
Uncle John Smith at this point was running scared. He knew someone would expose his under the table
dealings. On Thursday, a final move was made, pay everybody but the known DRUM members force a walk
out or shut down, blame the entire issue on trouble makers of"l3.RU.M. Being a open hater of DRUM and
tearing his exposure of crimes against the people John Smith accepted the new racist plan with open arms.
But to everyone's surprise during a closed door meeting on Thur’sday.,-ya Black brother stormed out of the
room and threatened the racist pig Roland and vowed to put a foot in his ass if he did not pay him in full
on Friday. This was a brother who was legally excused. Roland damn near fainted. Sweat, tears and piss
poured from him. After the meeting the Wonder Boy ran to the brother and begged for his forgiveness and
swore to pay the brother out of hispocket if need be. On Friday, July 10th, no one received their holiday
pay but all but three were promised to receive it before quitting time. John Smith still anticipating a‘ DRUM
s.t.rii<e assured the workers that he concurred with management.

Well Brothers and Sisters, the onslaught is on again at Huber Ave., as of Monday, July 5th, 1970, 1st
shift, 9310, Joe Biezaak was again put on the day shift as General Foreman, and he's been everything that
he was in the pass - no damn good racist cracker.

Biezaak made a foreman remove all of the boxes and milk crates that employees were sitting on while
doing their every day slave thing. This particular sister Mattie Hampton had to stand and do her job onvhardg
concrete floors while standing in one spot. ’

Stewards were called to the scene and the matter WES take?! UD$t3il'$- One hour late!’ M555 H3mPt0"
was given the privilege of taking her seat and continuing work. Due chiefly to the alternate steward's
courage to confront Joe Biezaak and tell him that if it was a white woman, he'wouldn't make her stand.
Biezaak told Paul that he had a 8:00 meeting with fat racist pig Oden, Plant Supt. Yes Brothers and Sisters
these two (2) pigs are bold, vicious and try to use their weak psychology on the less fortunate brothers and
sisters in Dept. 9310. Joe Biezaek has gone as far as telling all the black xbrothers thatthere will be no .
overtime as of next week. Since there is no 4 hour over time to help the brothers get over, there will be no
Saturday or Sunday work. Also a little something else for Joe Biezaak; Joe because of your stopping
progress or at least trying, you just made an ASS out of your self and the whole Chrysler Corporation. Yes,
ass hole Joe Biezaak, you have just blew your whole shot, for a Foreman that is hated as much as you, it is
a wonder you ain't dead. What are you trying to prove, knowing that DRUM is watching every move you
and the others are making, we say to you Joe Biezaak, don't be a Bummer, Don't fuck with the
DRUMMER. This is not a warning, but your iast chance.
