the squeal, and they are building. a machine
now to can that for-Fourth of’ July celebra-
tions.” For the utilization of such products,

subsidiary industries grew up, marking another

stage in industrial development. Soap and glue
factories, bone mills, laboratories for meat ex-
tracts, tanneries, fertilizer mills, felt works. and
brush manufactories arose. WVith perfect .con-\

trol of the raw product, exceptional facilities.

for marketing, favorable terms with railroads
and the advertising furnished by already well-
known names, the process of crushing out com-

petitors proves a short one. In many of these, .

lines the packers held a monopoly from the ﬁrst,
in others they soon attained it, ind’/'a few the

struggle is still going on. Only ‘a week ago,

(April, 1899) Armour was able to dictate the

'terms upon which the glue trust should be,

formed, and the other industries named will
soon come beneath his rule.

Leaving now the general survey and coming ‘

back to “Packingtown,” let’ us look for ,a, time
at the conditions immediately surrounding this
gigantic expression of modern commercialism.

The allied industries here located employ be- ’

tween 25,000 and 35,000 men, women and chil-

, dren, supporting a population of between 125,000

and 175,000 people. This makes. it the largest

industrial community in the world, the Krupp, , ‘

gun works at Essen, Germany, coming second,i:£t

    

but far behind, with about 16,000 emp1oyes.; V
Under what conditions do these people live who

prepare the meat for the world? We have seen
how all things work, to the advantage of those
who OWN these mammoth, complex butcher

Jshops and the tools that arevwithin them; how

is it With those who OPERATE them, and who

a produce this mighty mass .of food? Have they
V shared in the economies of production—in the

.1;

.9,

savings of combination, in the beneﬁts of im—.

proved machinery? Where and how do they

live, what manner of‘ homes have they, and
what are the conditions under which they work?

These are questions that the casual visitor_

seldom asks and the answers to which are never
volunteered. Yet the most hurried visitor can-

" not fail to have one of the conditions of life in

the Yards thrust upon him as his nostrils are
assailed at eve.ry.point by the horrible, pene-
trating stench ;tl1'at pervades everything and
lingers, for hours after a return to a more,salu-
brious ‘atmosphere, Occasionally this stench
leaves its accustomed haunts and -wanders away
on the southerngzephyrs to the aristocratic

North Side, and‘-the health commissioner be- ,.
. comes suddenly and deeply interested‘in the
welfare, not of the thousands of laborers who \

, live and eat and drink and sleep in its very‘

midst, but of the few wealthy individuals re- —
siding from three to ten miles away. In all the

discussions that have appeared from time to

time in the public press, I have yet to see one

word of the horrible, continuous sufferings of

» the host of workers who are forced to spend

their entire lives in the very heart of the abuse,

.whiLe:col11mns are written, deploring the tem-

a multitude of arteries of ﬁlth into a branch of

the Chicago'river at one corner of the Yards, ‘

where it rises to the top and spreads out in a
nameless, indescribable cake of festering foul-
ness and disease-breeding stench. On the banks
of this sluiceway of nastiness are several acres
of bristles scraped from the backs of innumera-
ble hogs and spread out to allow the still cling-
ing animal matter to rot away before they are
made up into brushes. Great gangs of laborers
with forks and rakes spend the long summer
days in turning and tossing these into long win-
rows until the whole scene becomes a ghastly,
tantalizing mockery of a mammoth hayﬁeld in

— harvest ﬁme.

As if local conditions could not furnish hor-
rors enough, other neighborhoods and the mu-
nicipality must lend a hand by leaving the

” streets unpaved, unsewered and uncleaned, until

the sides of the highwaysare festering pools of
slime. That language contains no words strong
enough to exaggerate this condition is illustrat-
ed by the fact that on Lincoln street in mid-
summer, a child-of a laborer fell into this awful
mixture and sank’ beneath the surface to a hor:
rible death, and was not discovered until some
hours afterward. It may seem as if the height
had now been reac M d, but the climax is yet to
come. Not content —v ith the negative abuse of

neglect to’ remove evils, capitalism m-ust adds

positive ones of its own devising.» So a city
garbage dump was established in the midst of
this neighborhood. Where the refuse of the
wealthy residents of Michigan avenue, Hyde
Park and Kenwood was taken from their back
doors and dumped by the ..hundreds of wagon
loads each i day at the front" doors of the long
suffering laborers of-.the Stock Yards. When a
protest wasaamade and an injunction_ sought

.r 

11

against the contractors, who were by such ac-
tion guilty of a criminal act, according to the
laws of the state, the city attorney, supposed to
be a paid servant of the people, appeared to de-
fend them, and added insult to injury by plead-
ing the great number of nuisances already exist-
ing in the neighborhood as an excuse for locat-
ing another in the same locality. Is it any won-
der that this particular section of the Stock

Yards community, known as “Back of the '
~Yards,” has the highest death rate of any place

of the city of Chicago—so high that on one street
the death rate of children under six years actu-
ally exceeds the birth rate, and that there were
nineteen deaths in the last three years from
consumption in three blocks?

Complaint after complaint regarding these
conditions have been madepto the health depart-
ment, but all in vain. Who should care? They
are only laborers! The owners live far away
from any danger. When, as a last resort,
Mayor Harrisonwas visited, and he was asked
if he would do anything in this matter, he
summed the whole situation of class rule and
capitalist exploitation up in the one sentence of
his reply: “SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS IN-
TERESTS OF CHICAGO WILL LET ME."
There you have it. So long as “business inter-

ests” rule in this country, a 1aborer’s life or that ,

of his family counts for nothing in the balance
against cent per cent proﬁt.

So far we have spoken only of the condition
outside the bui1dings——of the surroundings of
the laborers’ homes. The question arises as to
the conditions within the buildings. Does the
guide point out all the interesting features with-
in the houses themselves? Does he take his

party, into the damp packing cellars, where from a

three to.ten years ordinarily marks the limits

..

12

of a man’s working life before it breaks him
down with rheumatism and sends his wife and
children into the ﬁerce labor struggle or makes
of him a supplicant for charity? Does he call
attention to the gangs of men in the “ham

houses” working with" bare arms in the semis
poisonous saltpetre that causes great festering l

sores to come out ‘on their hands and arms.
Does he tell about the poisoninfested air and
general surroundings which makes the slightest
scratch a menace to life through blood poison-
ing, as local infection of Wounds is commonly
termed? I know from. personal experience in
numberless cases that a triﬂing prick, a scratch
or a bruise, is enough to lay a man up for
weeks’ and imperil the life of the person injured.

The Visitor’s attention is also carefully div'ert—
ed from any notice of the unguarded and de-

\ fectively dangerous machinery that is on- every
l1and—~death traps for the helpless workers who
dare not complain. In one establishment a long,
line of rendering vats, with their tops just on a .

level with the ﬂoor, yawn wide open in a steam-
laden atmosphere for the unwary victims. No
less ‘than three persons among the acquaint-
ances of the writer have fallen to an awful
death in these vats within the last two years. A
single elevator killed one man and rendered
another a helpless cripple within the space of

six weeks, and from all I could learn to the con-i ,

trary, is still running in its dangerous condition.

So slight is the value placed upon human life

in the Yards that a death is scarcely noticed.
During one period of great heat, when all deaths
by sunstroke were supposedto be investigated
by a ‘coroner’s jury and reported to the health

’ department, a single surgeon,,p1;acticing “back
of the Yards,” told me that he-hgvd attended,
"A three fatal cases of sunstroke in the Yards {in

U... my .. ..--»‘ ' ‘

13

one day, and not one of them had ever been
reported to the coroner or health department,
or even noticed in the press. .

This brings me to a consideration of that in-
evitable accompaniment of modern capitalism
in its most developed form—the “company doc-
tor.” Just as in its mechanical department, the

V packing houses use the very latest machinery;

just as their organization of labor is a little
more perfect than is to be found almost any-
where else on earth, so even the details are

‘worked out with ﬁne touches elsewhere un-

equaled. The scheme of saddling the expense of

p a company doctor on to the employes through

assessments from their wages is an old and
clumsy one. The packers did not need any such
subterfuge as an excuse for reducing wages.
These were already at the subsistence point and
could be reduced no lower. So the packers
“charitably” paid for the company doctor out
of “their” own (2) pocket. They selected a ﬁrst-
class surgeon and saw to it that he did his work
well. BUT THERE ARE ALMOST NO DAM-
AGE SUITS IN THE YARDS, and what there
are are generally lost. The expert witness is
on the right side.

There is still another way of settling the dam-
age suits that cannot be disposed of in this
manner. The family is visited immediately
after the husband or son has been murdered
and they are told, with all the skill of an expert
lawyer, that the company is “so sorry,” and

that they are “anxious to do What they can.” ‘

They are always willing to pay a fair sum for

funeral expenses, and then they come to the '

remaining members of the family and tell them

that those who are wage workers shall never \

lack for work so long as the business runs. To

a a family that has lived for a life-time with the

14

haunting horror of “‘no work” ever before them,
this offer of -perpetual slavery seems like Para-
dise, and they accept the oﬁer. For two years
all goes well. At the expiration of that time the

‘person employed is summarily discharged,

sometimes with, and as often without, any ex-
cuse. The ILLINOIS PERIOD OF LIMITA-
TION FOR, A DAMAGE SUIT IS TWO
YEARS. I have known this to happen, not once
or twice, but again and again, with a monoton-
ous regularity that removed all possibility of
the discharge being due to ineﬂiiciency.

Here, as elsewhere, capitalism has invaded
the home and dragged forth the mother and
child to do its work while the father vainly
walks the streets looking for a master. Not-
withstanding many prosecutions during the past
few years, large numbers of children are con-
stantly-employed.» All statistics regarding these
are valueless, as the dexterity with which chil-
dren are whisked out of sight at the approach
of an inspector, is one of the standing jokes of
the establishments, and any one who has Wan-
dered through the mazes of “Packingtown” will
understand how easy such concealment is. The
state factory inspector, in her report for 1895,
says concerning the conditions under which
these children are employed:

“Some of the boys act as butchers, sticking

sheep, lambs and swine; others cut the hide-

from the quivering ﬂesh of freshly stunned cat-
tle; still others sort entrails, pack meat, and
make the tin cans in which the goods are
shipped. In several places a boy has been found
at work at a dangerous machine, BECAUSE
HIS FATHER HAD BEEN DISABLED BY
IT, and his keeping the place pending recovery

‘ depended upon the boy's doing the work during

the father’s absence.” . .

15

These are the conditions under which the
work is done, and the next question is, what is
the return to the laborers for such work? How
large a share of what he produces is he allowed
to keep? It may be said to begin with, that
any exact statements as to Wages as a,whole
are unattainable. No one who knows anything
as to general conditions dares to talk, and to
gain the information piece-meal from employes
is a well-nigh impossible task. A residence of
over three years “back of the Yards,” with close
observation and conversation with hundreds of
workmen and the examination of a large num-
ber of individual time books, are, however, suf-
ﬁcient for some fairly accurate generalizations.

Several years ago the packers saw that by
maintaining a capacity to their works far be-
yond the actual needs, it was possible to kill
the entire daily shipments ‘each day and thus
save the‘expense of storage and feeding. Thus

it,,comes about that the establishments run each»

day 'only until the receipts for that day_ are
disposed of and then shut down until the next
purchase. The result is that thousands of men
must plod to their-places each morning, utterly
ignorant as to whether they will work one hour,
two hours or sixteen. If one is missing from
his position but a single time when wanted,
some one is called in from the waiting army
always clamoring at the doors for even his poor
chance, and the place is lost. If, on the other
hand, as often happens, he walks a weary dis-
tance only to ﬁnd that the house will not-run
that day, no one compensates him for his time,
or ﬁnds him other employment during his wait-
ing hours. As wages are always by the hour
or piece, a multitude of families exist on from
year to year, paying or dodging rent, buying or
begging clothing, purchasing or picking coal, in

16

a miserable monotonous holding of body and

soul together on the shameful pittance of from.

$2 to $5 a week, prevented from going else-
where, had their life left them with ambition
enough to desire removal, by the impossibility
upon the one hand of paying railroad fare, and
on the ‘other the will-o’-the-wisp hope of better
wages and “fuller time.” How close the mar-
gin of existence always is to the subsistence
point is shown by the fact that over 20 per

' cent of the population are compelled to ask for

charity at some time during each year.

Why, it may be asked at this point, do not the V

men have the courage to unite in trades unions

and ﬁght for‘better conditions? Not infrequent- '

lysome “labor leader” comes among them and

7 urges them to unite with high dues and no poli-

tics and call a strike. But the old employe only
shakes his head. He may know nothing of the,

.process and laws of social evolution,r but hell

has seen the rise and fall of union after union

in the Yards and has marked the failure or

many a strike until he has come to realize that

something-has happened to the particular in-
* dustry in which he is ‘working that makes it

well-nigh hopeless to combine for an economic
ﬁght against the employers. So it has come
about that there are practically no unions in

the Yards. Many reasons for this will doubt- 

less have occurred to the reader before this as
we Went along. Other reasons are not far to
seek. ‘
Trade distinctions have nearly all disappeared
before the machine. Few places could not be
ﬁlled at a moment’s notice from the great army
of unemployed ever present and growing larger
each year. Under these conditions, which the
socialist will at once recognize as the typical

 marks of an advanced stage of industry, the

17

pure and simple trades union is ridiculously '

helpless. One of the strongest trades unions in
Chicago is the carpenters’ union. Through/a
combination of unions, agreements with the em-
ployers’ association, and bourgeois political con-
nection With the building commissioners, they
are enabled to maintain a relatively high scale
of wages. Only a short time ago they carried
through a successful strike, by means of which
their wages were raised to 42% cents an hour,

I , with an eight-hour day. In the Yards every

carpenter Works ten hours a day at 20 cents an

t hour, and never a question is ‘asked as to union

or scab.
Another phase of this question, to which ref-
erence was previously made, and whose signiﬁ-

cance the socialist will also be quick to see, was V
. illustrated a short time ago When there Was. a

strike in a branch establishment in St.-Joe. The
Chicago house simply ran a few more hours
each day; much to the gratiﬁcafion;_,pf stheir em-
ployes, who never dreamed that "”tfl1"ey‘-” “W ‘Le
“scabbing” on their St. Joe brethren. T3 H ' 
The spy system previously ..referreg1ztoV,a. 01
stands in the Way of any organization of the
Workers. So thoroughly and systematically‘ is
this carried into every department that n(fWide--
spread movement among the men is. in any Way
possible without its details being known bythe
employers, Which, with a union, would certainly
mean its instant destruction. So thorougly is
the servitude of the laborers impressed upon
them that they scarcely dare have an opinion.
‘During the last presidential campaign the
owners of the Yards decided that their interest
were more intimately connected with-those of
one of the great capitalistic parties than With
the other, and so When a monster parade was
being organized for that party, the employee

were told to report as if for work and were then
given canes and other marching paraphernalia
and excused (?) to join the parade. When a
petitionlwas circulated asking the health depart-
ment to abolish the smoke nuisance, not an

employe dared to sign it, lest he lose the right _

to call a particular ﬁrm master, and hence lack
the _scanty means hitherto ﬂung to him with
which to keep body and soul together.

Is there, then, no interest in politics in “Pack-
ingtown?” ,If thereader were to go through
there on election day, he would ﬁnd the answer
to this -question. In no portion of the city is
there more “politics.” To see the way in which‘
the workers of the Yards get excited at elec-
tion time, to read of the ﬁerce ﬁghts in the
Twenty-ninth ward, one would think that at
each «recurring election the fate of the laborers

. of the world was at stake. Let us seewhat are

I theissues on which these men divide.

“Back of the Yards” has also another name
It is popularly known in the neighborhood at
“The Reservation’: and its residents are known
as “Ca‘rey’s Indians.” Just how they came to
have the particular name of Indians is too long
to tell here, but suffice to say that they are the
adherents of one Tom , Carey, now alderman of
this ward. For him they work and ﬁght, and
not infrequently bleed and even die. Let us
look a little closer into the things that give him
such a power in this neighborhood. In the ﬁrst

place he owns long rows of some of the most .

unhealthy houses in this deadly neighborhood.
These houses have no connection with the sew-
ers, and under some of them the accumulation

"of years of ﬁlth has gathered in a semi-liquid

19

mass from two to three feet deep. Shabbily
built in the ﬁrst place and then subjected to

,..Vears of neglect, they are veritable death traps.
"A cast iron “pull” with the health department

renders him safe from any prosecution. The
writer of this has been to that department
dozens of times and written them on many more
occasions, begging them, for the sake of the
people who were compelled to spend their lives
here, to make some move, but with never the
shadow of a result beyond lying promises in
abundance. -

In these houses his most faithful henchmen
live. He sees to it that they have work, but
never too much, or they might grow independ-
ent. Always behind in rent, and absolutely de-
pendent on “Tom” for their right to live, they
are as completely slaves as any serfs upon an
ancient baronial estate. Their master is a
stockholder in the Knickerbocker Ice Company
(the ice trust), and secures many places for
faithful slaves there. But all this would not be
sufficient to retain him in power for a moment
were it not for another feature of the matter.
Under ‘the old spoils system the power of the
boss over the wage slaves rested upon the fact
that he could alwayssecure them jobs in the
public service. Civil service reform has de-
stroyed this hold to some extent, but the boss
still ﬂourishes, and by means of the same lever"-
age. And he will last just as long as the uncer-
tainty of employment makes the desire for a.
permanent master. the most urgent desire in
the labo ers’ heart.

The so rce of Tom Carey's power lies in his
ability to get his followers jobs in the Yards.

_ When G. F. Swift was building his new “wool

house,” in the terrible winter of 1896-7, when
the obtaining of a job was a question of life and

20

death with hundreds of poor devils back of the
Yards, every man that went to work upon that

building bore a letter from Tom Carey. Andi “

the poor, starving fellows who voted and work-

‘ ed for Tom that they might have a chance to

coin their life blood into dollars for Swift never
realized that they were but riveting the chains
that galled them so tightly to-day upon their
children and children’s children. Caught in the
grasp of this tricky boodler, whom they had
hoisted into power, dependent upon him for
rent and employment, denied help from the
municipality which he controlled, cut oﬂ from a.
chanceto live at his command, they are ground
between an upper and a nether millstone to a
very ﬁne powder. 7 it

Yet this Swift, who foisted Tom Carey upon

, this long suffering community and keeps him

there to prey on them like a horse leech, whose
wholesale thefts of city water are notorious——
this is the same individual whose muniﬁcence
supports several Methodist churches in this city.
But a few weeks ago-comes the report that
with grim irony he has_made a “princely gift”
to a “little struggling church” in the very heart
of this industrial hell. It may be that the
church has lost its hold upon the masses, but it
would appear as if it had only shifted it one
degree and placing the capitalist between it
and the masses kept a ﬁrm hold upon the capi-
talist, trusting him not to allow the_ masses to

g get away.

But hold! Tom Carey is now a reformer.
Yes. This man who for years was known as
the most dare-devil robber that ever plundered
the city of Chicago, around whom had gath-
ered an almost legendary collection of stories
of his reckless deﬁance of the laws of the so-

i ciety in which he lived, has seen the “handwrit-

21

ing on the Wall” and united with the majority
of Chicago’s “honest council.” As such he still
dispenses patronage in the same free and easy
Way that he did when he Was a member of “de
gang,” but now he has, in addition to the as-
sistance of his helpless slaves from “back of
the Yards,” the “moral supportof our best citi-
zens.”

So far we have studied the life of the laborers
—their Work, their homes, their surroundings.
This is contrary to the usual proceeding which

. begins with the owners and forgets ever to

speak of the laborers at all. Visitors as they
Watch the mechanical perfection with which
everything moves at the' Yards, as they see the
Way in which each man is but a cog in the great
machine that runs on in Wondrous smoothness,
are apt to break out in fulsome praises of the
tremendous intellects and marvelous general-
ship that marshals all these armies of industry
for the service of society. Before We join in
this chorus of admiration let us make sure that
We bestow our praise Where it is due. Let us
examine one of these mammoth institutions and
see if We can locate. the organizing, directing,
controlling force that preserves order and regu-
larity throughout all its complex ramiﬁcations.

At the head We shall ﬁnd a general superin-
tendent, under him two or more division super-
intendents; then department superintendents
and foremen; then overseers of ﬂoors, and ﬁnal-
ly bosses of gangs; Each little potentate is en-
gaged in a ﬁerce struggle to gain the favor of
those above him and thus secure further‘ad-
vancement. Jealousies, intrigues and plots of
all kinds ﬂourish. Bribery, nepotism and diplo-

. macy that would test the resources of an expert

politician are employed ‘to gain one step nearer

\

22

the coveted top. Aside from such methods, the
surest way to rise is to reduce the margin of ex-
penses relative to the product in a department.
If one man can be thrown upon the streets by
forcing the remaining poor wretches to further
exertions, promotion is almost within the grasp
of the little slave driver who has whipped his
fellows on to more rapid death. If he can in-
vent a machine that will send a whole gang of
his brother workmen out to beg, starve, or steal,
while their work is done by the cheaper labog
of their wives and children, his promotion is cer-
tain and sure. All the evil effects of competi-
tion upon the laborer and consumer is present,
and the only person always beneﬁted is the
owner of the plant.

But if the effect is damning upon those who
are in the line of advancement, what is the con-
dition of those who are condemned to remain
forever at the bottom? For it must be remem-
bered that for fully 90 per cent of those who be-
gin work in the Yards there is no hope of ever
becoming anything more than an ordinary la-
borer. Entering the establishment at 14, or if

‘the pressure on the family income is Very hard

(and when is it light?), 3: year or two earlier

~ through the use of easily obtained certiﬁcates,

they have little education or preparation that
would ﬁt them for ‘anything but the simplest
tasks. Robbed of their birth-right to the devel-
opment of the powers that are within them they
are bound over to a terrible monotonous slavery
to some machine before which they will stand
day after day until its rhythmic motions have
burnt themselves into their brain and their
thinking becomes as mechanical as their work.
Or perhaps they stand at some bench and seize
a piece of meat as it falls before them, and with
that same machine,-like regularity that marks

¢

‘ 23

everything in the Yards from its politics to its
"pork-packing, repeat the same motions over and
over until they can perform the Work equally
Well with eyes open or closed and until the mo-
tions of the hand have stamped their impress on
the mind; and they move on in a dreary circle
of common things through the day until very
Weariness at last stops the thinking and they
creep away to a place called home,and drag oil?
the great “Yard boots” that seem to hold mind
as Well as body down to the level of the mirein
which they are steeped and throwing them into
a corner seek the bed too tired to think, only to
go on with the Work ‘in dreams“ uhtil awakened
‘to the reality of another day’s unchanging toil.
‘ The peculiar manner in which much of the
Work is done renders the pressing of the laborer
to an ever higher speed particularly easy. The
‘animal being transformed into meat generally
moves along upon some kind of a mechanical
contrivance, and each laborer performs his par-
ticular task while the carcass is passing him.
All that is needed to force the men to greater
exertions is to move the meat faster. In one of
the meat trimming divisions Where Women are
employed a peculiarly brilliant scheme has been
evolved to force these poor creatures to greater
exertions. The meat to be trimmed comes out
of a chute and passes along a trough .where it is
scrambled for, each one grabbing for the best
pieces to trim. A very dextrous and fearless

Woman Who is able to force her Way to the M

front in the struggle for material, and then
work vvith exceptional» speed upon the best
pieces thus obtained, often earns the muniﬁcent
sum of $1.25 per day. The women who are thus
forced to engage in a hoggish ﬁght for the
chance to live are the mothers and Wives and

6

24

daughters and sisters of the laborers of this

grand and glorious country of the free.

This process of “speeding up” has been regu-
larly and» systematically carried out in every de-
partment, until an employe informed the writer
a short time ago that he was- now ‘doing pre-
cisely twice as much as he was doing ﬁfteen
years ago with exactly the same tools. That
marvelous speed and dexterity so m.uoli;:'adn1ired

owner. Every one has heard the stories of the
long hours that P. D. Armour works, but few
are silly" enough to believe that he does any-
thing that he could not (were he less miserly)
hire some one else to do equally well. No one
supposes that W-*he_n he takes his expected trip
to Europe for his health this summer, while his
laborers are .murdered by the foul atmosphere
of his .pacI':ing houses, that his establishment
will shut down. Indeed, no one who is at all
familiar with the details of the management of

a great packing house dreams that if the own- .

ers were dead, imbeciles or infants, the life of
a- single hog would be saved or a pound of meat
-be missing from the markets of the world. As

a matter of fact some of the largest owners of
the packing houses are members of a European.

their wealth is produced and know less‘ of the
processes by which it is done than the most ig-
norant memb_er of the “cleaning gang.”

What, then, do the owners do ? In the answer,

to this question Will be found the beginning of
the explanation of the Whole hideous mystery of
suﬁering that we have been 10 king upon. We
shall ﬁnd that because they 0 N these build-

ings, machinery,_lan_d, etc., they are able to say‘

to great ‘dies of men, “You either must work
for us 6  'o'u must perish from hunger and lack
of work. But when you do work for us you
must give up all you produce, save enough. to
_keep yourself and family alive, and produce
more Workers for the coming years.” In other
words, OWNERSHIP OF THE TOOLS
WHICH MEN MUST HAVE TO LIVE,
MEANS OWNERSHIP OF THE MEN THEM-
SELVES. But this ownership can only be se-
cured through the instrumentality of the gov-
ernment. Therefore the employers control the
government. This, then, is the function of the
owners-—TO CONSTITUTE A RULING CLASS
WHICH SHALL DETERMINE THE LAWS
THAT MAKE THE WORKERS THEIR
SLAVES.

From beginning to end the industry is organ-
ized, supervised, directed, controlled and operat-
ed by hired laborers. To be sure, Wﬂage differ-
ences still exist, and the. head superintendent
would probably arise in parvenu horror at be-
ing placed in the same economic class with the

" “hog driver” or the tender, of a sausage ma-

chine. But these distinctions, like the earlier
ones between the tradé's_,'are fast fading away.

to the level received by the cheapest day la-
borer, are rapidly settling that phase of the
question. The same remorseless competition

’ that has crushed the humbler worker to the

subsistence point has only been suspended in
its operation upon the higher paid laborer be-

' cause the supply of their labor was still some-

what limited. Even now the position occupied
by these better paid slaves is little better save
in wages. than that of those they so proudly
order hither and thither. Their hours are as
long, their work as wearisome. They are com:
pelled in their turn to fawn and cringe before
those who outrank them and are forced to ‘all
manner of trickery with the fellow workmen of

. similar rank in order to retain their position and

advance. Most important of all, they are care-
fully taught by a “public opinion” created by
the capitalist class whom they serve, that they
are inﬁnitely superior to the poor devils whom
they superintend. In every possible Way this
idea of class differences among the laborers is
prea°ched. The poorer paid laborers are con-
stantly incited to hatred in their turn, of those
whom they look upon as petty tyrants. In this
way each is deprived of its strongest ally. The
cheaper paid laborer loses that leadership and
intellectual guidance in his political efforts that

V he has in «his every day work. The superin-

tendent loses the tremendous numerical support
that is absolutely necessary to make hisefforts
for betterment of any avail, and he becomes but
a puppet in the hands of a class whose every _in~

' — terest is opposed to his own. Why can these

workers never see that the question of voting is
one with the question ogytheir. work and their

' wages—that the same. .organization that makes

the “Yards” the marvel ’,of the world in its’pro-
ductive way Would,=~if used politically, make it

27

the mightiest engine for the freeing of labor
that this century has forged. In its every de-
partment these mammoth institutions are car-
ried on by the workers. Still we are told that
the co-operative commonwealth is impossible of
realization because the proletariat could never
organize industry and there would be no in-
centive to make the “captains of industry” take
the lead and organize labor. a
Let us now once more take a wider outlook.
The packing industry has now become interna-
tional. The meats from these great institutions
we have been studying are to be found in every
country on the globe. The interests of the own-
ers thus at once become wider than the bounds
of “Packingtown.” They become interested in
international politics. They want“new mark,ets.”
They need the national government to accom-
plish their purposes. They became intensely
patriotic. When the captalist class of this coun-
try were arranging the war with Spain and it
was necessary to inﬂame public opinion, in no

place was there more “patriotism” to the square -
inch than in. the Union Stock Yards and Pack- ‘

ing Houses of Chicago. Every day there were
a half dozen “ﬂag raisings” with ﬁerce patriotic

effusions to the laborers, until the smoke-laden V

air was thickly dotted with the stars and
stripes. It was a peculiar fact that over no es-
tablishment did it ﬂoat higher and prouder than
over those whose owners never set foot on
American soil, but whose “patriotism” drew
just as large dividends as .the native product.
But they received their reward. All the world
knows now the story of the infamous part

played in that disgraceful tragedy by the pack- I T

All this mass of misery, outrage, plunder and I

V "APPENDIX.

This pamphlet was ﬁrst written in April, 1899.;
Alterations have been made in succeeding edi-
tions as capitalism has reached new stages in
Packingtown. These changes have now be-
come so numerous that to make the correspond-

~ ing alterations in the text would be diﬂicult, if

not impossible, without entire re-writing. All
these changes, however, have but emphasized
the positions originally taken. A new ﬁrm, that
of Schwartzchild & Sulzberger, has been added
to the former ones, and the other ﬁrms have
grown in size until there are now 60,000 instead
‘of 35,000 employes in this industrial center.
Just as I write this, concentration is taking an-
other step in the almost complete amalgamation
of all the interests concerned in the “Beef

i

30 ‘

Trust” whose exactions are carrying hardships ,«
into millions of homes throughout the capitalist
world. In this beef trust John D. Rockefeller
is a principle stockholder, thus "marking one
more step toward the complete union of the
packing industry with all other capitalist indus-
tries. *

The stench and the smoke grows ever worse,
and as the industry developed, land grew too
valuable for “hair-ﬁelds,” so that the class of
workers who formerly at least had the open
sky above them, now ﬁnd all their former dis-
comforts aggravated by conﬁning walls and
roof. ‘

P. D. Armour has gone the way of all ﬂesh
without his disappearance causing so much as

~a_,ripple in the priceyof packing-house shares,

thus furnishing a complete proof of the useless-
ness of the owners as factors in the production

. of beef. The spy system is much more perfect
' than three years ago, and the visitor is permit-

ted to see far less. The one encouraging fact is
that the revolt of the laborers is growing apace.
Trade unions are pushing their way in. Socialist
party branches in Packingtown are growing.
Tom Carey, however, still rules, and his helpless
political slaves continue to vote themselves into
wage slavery.

PACKINGTOWN.

Perhaps there is no one feature of the “Windy
City” of which its ruling class are so proud as
the Union Stock Yards and Packing Houses.
Perhaps it is because from start to ﬁnish they
are more nearly typical of the system in which
they exist than,anything else in the great city.
From the general air of hoggishness that per-
vades everything from the general managers’
oﬂices down to the pens beneath the buildings
and up to the smoke that hangs over it all, the
Whole thing is purely capitalistic. In fact, it is
safe to say that in the entire World there is not
another. so perfect example of the capitalisti
system in all its purity (or impurity, rather), a
is furnished by this group of industries. i

so it has become one of the “sights of the
toWn,” and no visitor thinks his tour _of the
World’s Fair City complete until he has bee
piloted through the mazes of “PackingtoWn”
and seen the Wondrous machinery that whirls
the animal along in the transforming journey
from pen to barrel. He gazes in amazement at
the contrivances of iron and steel, whose va-
riety, intricacy and humaneness are only equal-
ed in marvelousness by the uniformity, sim-
plicity and mechanicalness of their ﬂesh and
blood competitors. The interest and admiration
of the visitor is divided between the iron and
steel expression of human intelligence that fol-
lows all the curves" of a. hog’s anatomy to re-

'3

move the bristles, and the ﬂesh and blood mech-
anism that removes all the meat from the bone
with a single stroke of the knife. He is led
into the great cooling rooms and gazes on acres
of freezing hogs in course of preparation for
journeys of perhaps half way around the world,

and he is asked to admire the perfect machinery ‘

that carries the carcass along through all these
various processes, with never a break or a slip.
But his attention is never called to the gangs
of workmen with bare arms rushing at head-
long speed from this frigid atmosphere to the
torrid heat of the “killing ﬂoor.” Neither is he
told that from the time he enters the conﬁnes
of the “Yards” until he leaves, his every move-

ment is noted by paid spies who dog his foot-_.t
steps or note his presence as he passes their‘
designated. station. In fact, there are many .

things not on exhibition for the casual visitor, or
pointed out by the affable uniformed guide who
leads the way. It is the purpose of this paper
to take the visitor a little behind the scenes and
point out some of the conditions that attach to
this splendid development of capitalism.

As was stated above, the industry as a whole
is probably the best example of the completed
product of capitalistic evolution to be found in
the world. The ‘process of consolidation has
about run its course. All competing butchers
were long ago destroyed, save in a few out-of-
the-way places, where their competition is un-
felt. The process by which this was carried
out is familiar to “the residentsof almost every
small city or town ‘in this country. At the be-
ginning there are several little competing butch-
ers. Everything is going on lovely, with all the
wastes and weaknesses of competition. Some
ﬁne morning one pf the butchers, generally the

strongest ﬁnancially in the place, is approached .

4

by an affable stranger, who introduces himself
as a representative of Swift’s or Armour’s
packing house and makes a ﬂattering offer to
the proprietor of the shop if he will handle their
meats instead of his own. If he accepts, he is
immediately enabled to undersell all his previ-
ous competitors, and for a time he thinks he
has stumbled upon a Klondike. The consumers

 of the town are also elated, for they now get

better meats at much lower prices, and they are
apt to grow a little bitter toward their fellow
townsmen, who had “been cheating them all
these years.” Finally, one by one these com-
petitors disappear, and the victorious butcher
becomes of much importance in his little circle,
and a great admirer of Armour and Swift.

One day there comes a change. The hitherto

I affable agent suddenly becomes stern. The

wholesale price of meat is raised, the margin
of proﬁt is wiped out, and the independent’ mer-
chant becomes a commission agent for the great
Chicago packing house. The price of meat goes
up again and everything is lovely—for the pack-

er. If the local butchers object, they are help-'

less—their slaughter houses are dismantled and

out of repair and their trade scattered, and be-'

sides there is before them-the certainty that no
matter how successful they might be for a
short time there is nothing before them but ab-
solute ruin as soon as they grow large enough
to again attract the attention of the Chicago
packers. Thousands of men have thus been
robbed of a life-long trade experience and had
the inexorable law, of monopoly, “Thou shalt not
produce,” read to them. so f ‘gag.-here has been
no talk of_“compensation”* -st   whose prop.

»

erty was “conﬁscated.”  s f ‘z-

   

»~..

   

Within the last few mon;ths.‘}a§iother phase of
this movement has been .diéj;:el0ped'. , In revenge

 
 

5 .
for anti-butterine legislation, the packers are

said to ‘have informed the farmers and provi-
sion dealers that they Would be taught a les-

v son. So, just at present, they are involuntarily

attending the school of capitalistic political
economy. The packers have simply gone into
the provision business. One of the ‘ﬂoors of a
great packing house has been ﬁtted up for the
slaughter of chickens, geese, turkeys, etc. The
same wholesale methods with mechanical ap-
pliances that have wiped out competitors in
other lines are being applied here. The markets
are being manipulated and the Whole complex
machinery of subsidiary plants and sub-agencies
are being utilized for the destruction of those
parties who had not yet learned that legisla-
tures are sacred to the use of BIG capitalists.
Butter and eggs are being handled in the provi-
sion depots throughout the country, and it is
but a short step to add a general grocery line,
and then the retail grocery trade (the classical
example in bourgeois political economy of an
industry with “diminishing” or “continuous re-
turns,” and hence incapable of monopoly) will
be brought under uniform and economical con-
trol and a great army of small merchants be
sent to join the proletariat. ‘

In the last few years another feature has been

developed that is of interest to those who are,
Watching the course of social movements. Theg
business, once concentrated for ﬁghting, now 
that the battle is Won, is being dispersed for - '

proﬁt.

The Chicago houses are remaining Well-nigh,

stationary in size, but branch institutions are
being started in great numbers. At St.’ Louis,

Omaha, Kansas City, St. Joe, Duluth, St. Paul T

and several other great transportation centers,
establishments are being erected similar to

those in Chicago. The advantage such a state
of_industry gives in a contest with rebellious
Wage slaves is well known. Should there be a
strike at any one plant, it is only necessary to
transfer the work to another and let the strik-
ers slowly starve into submission while the
business goes on uninterrupted, while a general
organization of all the employes in such widely
scattered plants is well-nigh an impossibility.
But more about organized labor later on.

It .is noticeable that all these branch estab-
lishments are built along the line that separates
the cattle-raising district from the great con-
suming public. Railroad rates are then so ar-
ranged that the cost of bringing LIVE STOCK
to these particular points is very low, but from
there on to the east the rates are practically
prohibitory on live cattle, while the rate on
DRESSED BEEF suddenly drops. Lest this
situation might be taken advantage of by small
ﬁrms located at these points, a heavy rebate is
given on all private cars—a rebate so heavy
that, according to an instance cited by Judge
Schoonmaker in a paper before the third annual
convention of railroad commissioners, the “cars
were paid for and a margin in two years, and
thereafter an income of upward of $100,000 a
year was insured on an investment fully repaid
or in effect on no investment w_l1a'tever.” This
Was on an original investment in rolling stock
of only $156,500, which, of course, is a very
small sum compared with what many of the
great packers have invested in,this way.

There are two separate forms of industry car-
ried on at the Yards, or rather two branches of
the one Work performed by different industrial
organizations. There is the transportation and
yarding business upon the one hand, and the
slaughtering and packing upon the other. The

7

former business is carried on by a corporation
formerly known as the Union Stock Yards and
Transit Company. The stock of this company
‘is owned by the ten largest railroads running
into the Yards. A short time ago this company
was reorganized under the name of the Chicago
Junction Railway Company. Shortly after this
an election was held by the stockholders, and
who .should appear as president but Chauncey
M. Depew. This, of course, indicated that the
Vanderbilt interests were now in control and
marked another stage in the concentration of
wealth, and one more illustration of the close-
ness with which the interests of plutocracy are
united. « -

Now, if there is one point on which the Van-
derbilts are strong, it is on the “economlca1
management” of their industries. So there was.
a great shaking up at the Yards. Old and trust-
ed employes were discharged to give place to
younger men, and the pressure of work on those
retained increased until the services of many of«
the most faithful employes were dispensed with
entirely, and they were forced to take their
places with the army of men who were begging.
for a chance to sweep ﬂoors or shovel dirt. "All
this was in the time of prosperity of March and
April, 1899.

Throughout the entire packing industry, un-
der those conditions, it was not long until “free
competition” had run its course and given way
to monopoly. All the savings of “monopoly
management” appeared. “By products” were
utilized down to the minutest degree. Bones,
teeth, hair, blood, hoofs, horns—al1 were found
to be of value when existing in such large quan-
tities, until it became a standing joke at the
Yards to be told to each new visitor by the
grinning guide that “everything is saved but
