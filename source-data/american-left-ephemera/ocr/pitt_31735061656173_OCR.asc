ing recognition was Chairman  Hardin Peterson (D.-F la.) of
the Public Lands Committee.

“Mr. Speaker! Mr. Speaker!” the two, standing shoulder to
shoulder, shouted in unison.

Ignoring Lesinski (and simultaneously ignoring the pledges of
his party to the Negro people), Speaker Rayburn looked down
augustly from his marble throne and said:

“The chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.”

Peterson called up his committee’s bill to grant statehood to
Alaska (population 115,000 as compared wi-th a Negro population
of 15,000,000 affected by the Powell bill).

gDe.bate on the Peterson bill droned on without spirit, inter-
rupted and prolonged by repeated demands by the Dixiecrats for
time-consuming quorum calls and record votes on routine ques-
tions. At one point Rep. John Rankin (D.-Miss.) made a “point
of order” that the_ two clocks in the chamber did not coincide.
Rayburn. could have denied these quorum calls as “dilatory”-—
that is, designed only to waste time'———but he cooperated with the
Dixiecrats in bogging down the House procedures.

About 4:30 the House concluded debate on the Alaskan bill
and voted to make it “the unﬁnished business of the House.”

Again Lesinski took the ﬂoor. But so did Peterson. .

Through a quirk of his optic nerve, Rayburn could discern
Peterson very clearly, although he was strangely blind to the
equally bulky and equally noticeable Lesinski. Rayburn recognized
Peterson who called up his bill to grant statehood to Hawaii.

It was during debate on the Hawaiian bill that Majority Leader
McCormack revealedthat at the conclusion of this item he would
move to adjourn. There followed this colloquy:

“Mr. Colmer (D.-Miss.): If I understand the distinguished
majority leader correctly he will move that the House adjourn
when this rule is disposed of.

“Mr. Marcantonio: I will be very brief. I simply want to say
this: The duty of every friend of F .E.P.C. is to vote down the
majority leader’s motion to adjourn.

“Mr. McCormack: The gentleman from New York is not
putting me on the spot to call up anything after 5 o’clock? The
gentleman himself knows what the situation is.

10

 

“Mr. Marcantonio: That is because I know the situation!

“Mr. Peterson: Mr. Speaker, I decline -to yield further.

“l\«Ir. Marcantonio: We ought to stay here until F .E.P.C. is
voted out tonight.”

, Assured of McCormack’s support, the Dixiecrats promptly
ceased their ﬁlibustering tactics and the Hawaiian bill was soon
disposed of.

By 5 o’clock, therefore, the decks were cleared and there was
no business before the House.

With Marcantonio and Powell at his either elbow, Lesinski
was again on his feet. “Mr. Speaker,” he shouted waving a sheaf
of papers in his hand.

Speaker Rayburn again scanned the scene from his marble dais.
He looked at Lesinski with unseeing eyes. Then raising his gaze
just over that gentleman’s left shoulder, he espied the. majority
leader standing four rows back.

“Mr. Speaker,.” said McCormack, “I move that the House do
now adjourn.” _.

Marcantonio demanded a record vote, which Rayburn refused.
Rep. Earl Wilson ' (R.-Ind.) called Raybi1rn’s attention to the
fact that many members having learned that a vote was to be
taken were now re—entering the chamber. He added his voice to
the plea of Marcantonio. Rayburn rapped his gavel and again
refused. By a teller vote, the motion to adjourn carried, 167 to
109 but it was thus impossible to say who cast’ their votes for or
against F .E.P.C. in that ballot. s

This was an exciting round in the battle for F .E.P.C. and
when the gong sounded, it had clearly been won ‘by the Dixiecrats
—with the aid of the Truman ﬂdministration force: in the H ouse.

TRUMAN’S PART

Some persons, while condemning Rayburn and McCormack
for this obvious sellout, absolve President Truman of any blame.
But this conclusion doesn’t make sense,‘ despite the P_resident’s
assurances to a Mobilization delegation on January 17 that he
was heart and soul for speedy enactment of F .E.P.C.

On Monday morning, January 23, a couple of hours before
Rayburn gagged Lesinski on the floor, newspapers here were

11

-headlining a report that Truman was in conference with Rayburn

and McCormack, putting the pressure on them to pass the Powell
bill. I rushed to the White House, hoping this was true.

I stood in the lobby with other newspaper reporters when Ray-
burn and McCormack issued from the President’s oﬁice. Im-
mediately the pair were bombarded with question. “What about
F.E.P.C.?” we asked.

Rayburn was climbing into his topcoat. “The President did not
order me what to do,” he observed cooly, “as some folks were
saying he would. What we are going to do in the House today
was not discussed.”

Truman’s failure to demand of Rayburn action to fulﬁll his
party’s campaign pledges was, in my opinion, as shameful as Ray-
burn’s failure to carry out those pledges on the ﬂoor later.

This betrayal only points up the fact that civil rights, like many
other things the people need and want, are being sacriﬁced to
Truman’s own war program. For it is the drive toward war which
makes Truman placate the Dixiecrats and work with the G.O.P.
in the interests of support for the present bi-partisan war program.

THE GRAND OLD PARTY

Lest any one should think, however, that the Republican party
is blameless in the betrayal of F .E.P.C., let us turn again to the
Rules Committee.

This committee met on Tuesday, following F .E.P.C.’s setback
of Monday. F .E.P.C. was on the agenda. Here is the way the
vote went:

For F.E.P.C.—-5

Sabath (D.-Ill.)
Madden (D.-Ind.)
McSweeney (D.-Ind.) Colmer (D.-Miss.)
Delaney (D.-N.Y.) Lyle (D.-Tex.)
Herter (R.-Mass.) Brown (R.-O.)
Absent: Allen (R.-Ill.), Wadsworth (R.-N.Y.)

Against F .E .P.C .—-5

Cox (D.-Ga.)
Smith (D.-Va.)

As can be seen, the Rules Committee consists of four Truman
Democrats, four Dixiecrats and four Republicans. The G.O.P.
12

could fulﬁll its campaign promises any time it wished by having
three of its four Republican members vote with the Truman
Democrats. It has never chosen to do that.

On this day, Rep. Clarence Brown, who claims he is for
F .E.P.C., voted against the measure for the purpose, as he
admitted, of tying it up through a tie vote, giving as his excuse the
absence of his two colleagues.

But on Thursday, January 26, F .E.P.C. was again-on the
committee’s agenda and Allen was present, although Wadsworth
was still absent.

“If you insist on taking a vote,” Brown told Sabbath, as he
later admitted to us newsmen, “I will vote against F .E.P.C.”
With Allen, an opponent of F .E.P.C. and Brown both voting
no, F.E.P.C. would have lost six to five.

“Why didn’t you vote ‘yes’ and force the bill to the ﬂoor?”
a reporter asked Brown.

“Oh, no!” roared Brown, “and take Rayburn off the hook?
Never. I’m not playing that game.”

Which showed that the Republican leadership is equally guilty
with the Democrats in playing partisan politics with F.E.P.C.

ENTER F.D.R., JR.

This selﬁsh partisanship has also complicated, and perhaps
destroyed, chances of bringing F.E.P.C. to the ﬂoor through the
third method, the discharge petition.

On Monday, January 16, Rep. Powell told a mass meeting
of 4,000 civil rights marchers that if the “Discharge Monday”
method failed he would immediately introduce a petition to bring
the bill to the ﬂoor.

But on Monday, January 23, even before the issue of the

21-day rule had been resolved, young Franklin Roosevelt, Jr., '

had introduced his own discharge petition.

This was, as almost all agreed, a breach of House traditions—~
a violation of “the minimum standards of common courtesy,” as
Powell called it—-in that young F.D.R. Jr., had taken this action
without consulting with Powell, author of the bill, or with
Lesinski. Secondly, it was disruptive in that young Roosevelt,
prominently mentioned as the Democratic candidate for governor
of New York, appeared to be using F .E.P.C. as a political football.

13

  

Some Democrats declined to sign his petition on the first
ground. Almost all Republicans declined to sign it on the second.
There was, however, a third and equally base motive animating
young Roosevelt, as revealed by his backer, the New York Post.
“Roosevelt’s quick action,” said the Post, “forestalled a similar
step by either Rep. Powell or Rep. Marcantonio. . . . Non-
communist supporters of civil rights were quick to back Roosevelt’s
action.” « A
’ This is of course untrue. It did not forestall Powell because he
introduced his own resolution at the request of Republicans and
some Democrats. And Powell’s action is apparently backed by as
many “non-Communist supporters of civil rights” as is that of
young Roosevelt. ‘

 

The injection of the “Communist” issue by the Po:t,'which is

to say by the Liberal Party, is signiﬁcant, however. The Po:t,the
Liberal Party and young Roosevelt use the term “Communist”
when they mean the Progressive Party of Henry Wallace or its
New York aﬂiliate, the American Labor Party. '

The Progressive Party and the A.L.P., backed to the hiltby
the Communists, have fought vigorously and consistently for
F .E.P.C. and other civil rights legislation. No one h-as fought
more effectively than the A.L.P. leader, Vito Marcantonio, and
Powell, a Democrat, has frequently received A.L.P. backing be-
cause of his sincere support for F .E.P.C. and similar measures.

Young Roosevelt’s motive, therefore, emerges indecently clear
as designed to steal for the Liberal Party and the Truman Demo-
crats credit for the work done by Powell and Marcantonio. But
in this case, as always when Red-baiting is injected, the people
are the victims. Roosevelt’s quick, slick trick will probably fail
to garner him, a single vote in the gubernatorial race, but it has
already seriously damaged F .E.P.C.’s chances. ‘

I do not have the space to deal in detail with the F.E.P.C.
situation in the Senate. Some believe that the tactics of the ad-
ministration’s leader, Sen. Lucas, will be to bring it up before
House passage, permit it to be ﬁlibustered and then claim there is
no hope for the bill until next term.

Tentatively, Lucas has slated Senate consideration of F.E.P.C.
about March 1. But Lucas and other Administration leaders have

been openly pessimistic as to its chances.
14-

 

Sen. Paul Douglas (D.-Ill.) told an Illinois delegation of civil
rights marchers on January 16 that it would be “virtually impos-
sible” to end a ﬁlibuster on the Powell-McGrath bill. Lucas, who
stood at his shoulder, assented.

The role of leadership is to instill courage and inspiration into
its army. But the defeatism of Lucas and his aides, which does the
contrary, is one of the most serious obstacles which must be over-
come if F .E.P.C. is to be enacted. I am reminded of a verse from

the Scriptures: “If the trumpet sound an uncertain note, who

will prepare himself for battle?” The Lucas trumpet sounds like
the tolling of the knell.

Lucas sought to justify his position with a remark to delegates
that “You have got to remember that civil rights will be a tremen-
dous issue in the campaign.” _ ;

Which brings us back to our starting point, that "all of the
maneuvers, all of the betrayals, all of the slick tricks, are designed
to presvent F .E.P'.C., from becominga lafw,.not only ,..s_o that it
may be retained as an election campaign issue, but ‘because it
interferes with the Truman-Wall Street war  Republicans,
Democrats and President Truman are atone ‘on this aim.

It is a vicious circle but it can be broken, provided the people
realize the true situation. If they will cease believing the alibis of
Truman or the Democrats or the Republicans and speak up
loudly, saying, “Cut out the alibi: and give us‘ F.E.P.C.,” the
Powell ‘bill will be passed. The entire purpose of this pamphlet is
to convince the reader of this simple -point.

WHAT YOU CAN’ DO

Individuals and organizations should wire or write Presi-
dent Truman and William Boyle, Democratic National
Chairman, Washington, D.C., saying that excuses will not .
be accepted; that the people want F .E.P.C. now.

A similar message should be sent to the Republican Na-
tional Committee, as well as to your own Senators and
Representatives.

Washington, I an. 29, I950

IGHTEEN months ‘have passed since the Republican and

Democratic party conventions went on record pledging their

support to fair employment practice legislation. At this Writing the

legislation, known as F .E.P.C., has not been adopted. It has not

been adopted because no bill embodying its guarantees has been
permitted to come before either the Senate or the House.

For that is the peculiar character of F .E.P.C.’s problem. If it
could be brought to a vote, there is. a strong possibility that it
would pass. Not only are the two major parties at least formally
pledged to its enaction, but a majority of both houses of Congress
are committed to vote aye in its favor. Only Southern Democrats
and a few Republicans, scarcely more than 150 out of 435 mem-
bers of the House, and hardly more than 30 out of 96 members
of the Senate, frankly oppose the measure.

Yet its passage by the 8 lst ‘Congress is not by any means assured.

It can be blocked during the remaining months of the 81st
Congress as it has been in the past—-by deals between the Truman
Administration and the Dixiecrats, by deals between the Republi-
cans and the-Dixiecrats. It can be prevented from coming toa
vote through the sort of trickery which Democratic and Republi-
can leaders have used in the past—-to the shame of the nation!

Standing in the Well of the House Chamber last Monday, Rep.
Vito Marcantonio (A.L.P.-N.Y.) summed up the situation with
his usual incisiveness.

“It is obvious to everyone, due to the events of today, that

everybody wants civil rights as an issue but not as a law, and

that goes for Harry Truman, the Democratic Party and the
Republican Party.”

The most conservative journals of opinion admitted that the.

New York Laborite had conveyed a true picture. Arthur Krock
of the New York Times said that “informed observers” agreed
with him. The Baltimore Sun said: “We take special pleasure in
saluting him for his candid summation of the situation on F .E.P.C.
legislation.” V

“The Fair Employment Practices Commission bill apparently
makes a better issue than it would make a law,” wrote Gould
Lincoln in the Washington Evening Star, “judging from the an-
tics of the Trumancrats . . . on .Capitol Hill.”

3

 

  

What all of this means is that the leaders of the Democratic
and Republican parties, facing Congressional elections next fall,
do not intend to adopt an F.E.P.C. law. But they intend to
appear before the voters prior to those elections and argue that
only their party sincerely fought for F.E.P.C.' while leaders of the
other party prevented a vote on this crucial measure.

If they succeed in this tactic, they would hold off F .E.P.C. for
the next two years in preparation for the 1952 Presidential elec-
tions, and again after that, on and on, ad infinitum, with the result
that we would never have an F.E.P.C.

It would appear from the foregoing that the outlook for
F .E.P.C. is exceedingly gloomy, especially during the present 81st
Congress. But that is not the impression I wish to give. On the
contrary, my thesis is that F.E.P.C. can be passed at this session
if it is brought to a vote, and -that it can be brought to a vote if
the people understand what is really happening, are aroused and
act to see that it is passed.

So long as the Republicans can blame the Democrats and get
away with it, and the Democrats can blame the Republicans and
get away with it, and President Truman can blame Congress, and
get away with it, nothing good is going to happen. So long as the
people put complete reliance in Truman, or in the Democratic
leaders or in the Republican leaders, just so long will these poli-
ticians use one trick after another to keep F .E.P.C. pigeonholed.
But when labor and the people get wise, and make the politicians
aware of that situation, F .E.P.C. will be brought to the floor
where it can be voted up with little delay.

WHY AN F .E.P.C. LAW?

The movement for a Federal F .E.P.C. law arose as an effort
to cope with the widespread, rank discrimination practiced in our
country in the hiring and upgrading of workers belonging to
minority groups. The worst sufferers are the 15 million Negroes,
who are, as the old phrase has it, the last to be hired and the first
to be fired. But it is not only in the getting and the holding of
a job that the ‘Negro people are subjected to injustices. They are
relegated to the more menial .jobs and are systematically barred
not only from professional posts, but from white collar positions

4

 

  

and even any kind of skilled job in industry and transportation.

As a result, the median annual wage of white workers in 1947
(U.S. Census ﬁgures) was $1,980 while the median annual wage
of non-white workers was only $863. The median annual income
of families in 1947 was $3,157 for whites, and $1,614 for non-
whites.

Besides the Negro people, some 5,000,000 Jews encounter dis»-
crimination in jobs and professional appointments. For 3,000,000
Americans of Mexican or Spanish origin, the problem is equally
serious. And so it is for 11 million foreign born and, in some
areas, for Catholics and the children of foreign born.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt believed that the “right”
of employers to discriminate against Negroes, Jews, Mexican-
Americans and others wasa “luxury” which a democratic nation
at war could not afford. He issued Executive Order No. 9346
prohibiting job discrimination in war industries or in government
and established the Fair Employment Practice Commission to
enforce it.

In 1946 Congress declined to appropriate funds for the con-
tinuation of the Commission, and President Truman permitted it
to die. But one of the last observations of the expiring Commission
was that all the headway made during the war was being lost and

that a Federal F .E.P.C. law was needed.
THE POWELL BILL

The Powell Bill, known as H.R. 4-453, and sponsored by Rep.
Adam Clayton Powell (D.-N.Y.), was drafted to meet this need.
It is the fruit of some four years of hearings in the House and
Senate and incorporates what Powell believes are the best provi-
sions from various bills introduced’ during that time, as well as the
best features in state anti-discrimination laws.

“The ‘Congress . . . declares that the right to employment
without discrimination because of race, color, religion or national
origin is a right of all persons within the jurisdiction of the
United States,” says the Powell bill, “and that it is the national
policy to protect the right of the individual to be free from such
discrimination.”

The bill prohibits certain “unlawful employment practices. An

  

employer may not refuse to hire, discharge, or practice discrimina-
tion against, an individual because of his race, religion, color,
national origin or ancestry. An employer also is prohibited from
using a recruitment service or employment agency which practices
discrimination. A labor organization may not deny any of the
advantages of trade union organization or collective bargaining to
any individual because of his race, religion or color. Further, an
employer may not discharge or demote a person who has partici-
pated in any action to enforce fair employment practices in his
place of employment.” ‘

The bill provides for a Commission of ﬁve which shall have
the power to investigate, hold hearings and issue orders directing
an employer or a trade union to cease and desist from discrimina-
tory practices. While the bill provides in many ways for conciliation
and mediation, the Commission may, if all other methods fail, go
to a Federal court andsecure an injunction or restraining order.‘
Continued violation of the law then becomes contempt of court
and is punishable by fine or imprisonment. A

Any person who feels he has suffered job discrimination may
ﬁlea written complaint which would serve as the basis of the
Commission’s action. Any ‘employer who feels the Commission’s
decision is unfair may appeal to a Federal court for review.

The Commission may delegate to a state or local government
jurisdiction over any case of job discrimination if the state or
municipal laws against discrimination are consistent with the
Federal law. V

The bill also provides that the President may take whatever
steps are necessary to guarantee that government agencies and
persons or corporations operating on government contracts do not
engage in job discrimination. ,

The Powell bill is not perfect. It might be criticized for exempt-
ing state, city and county governments, as Well as employers With
less than 50 employees. However, it does contain “teeth,” or
genuine measures for enforcement. If adopted it would be a
historic milestone in the continuing struggle for equality of eco-
nomic opportunity in our fair land, regardless of what efforts may
be made later by reactionary employers to violate and sabotage
this law. - »

MONTHS IN A PIGEONHOLE

Despite the pledges of leaders of both major parties, however,
there was no rush to enact the bill. Hearings were held by the
Powell subcommittee in May, 194-9. But it was not until August
2 that the bill was reported out by the full House Labor Com-
mittee. A similar bill introduced in the Senate by Sen.  Howard
McGrath (D.—R.I., now U.S. Attorney General) did not clear
the Senate committee until October 17. Congress adjourned two
days later without considering F .E.P.C.

Ever since May, Senate Majority Leader Scott Lucas (D.—Ill.)
had been insisting there “wouldn’t be time” for civil rights legisla-
tion in the upper chamber. Which was nonsense, but at least the
Senate appeared to be busy. The House, on the other hand, had
not even the shadow of an excuse for its failure to take up F .E.P.C.
On August 25,_ the House voted itself a 26-day recess because it
had “nothing to do.” Returning to Washington September 21,
the Democrats still made no move to deal with the Powell bill.

A roar of resentment went up among the Negro people, and
and among the millions of non-Negroes who recognized that
F legislation was the need of the entire nation. The
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
under pressure of its aroused. membership launched a nationwide

» mobilization beginning November 15 to culminate in a civil rights

conference in Washington on January 15.

“Unless some Congressmen and Senators work and" vote for
this legislation in January,” the N.A.A.C.P. said, “they may never
get a chance to work on any legislation in the 82nd Congress.

a They can call this a threator anything they choose. Negroes have

been patient, but they are through with empty promises, broken

pledges and slick tricks. We want F .E.P.C. or else we will cut

short some political careers.”

Despite eﬁor-ts, particularly of certain C.I.O. leaders, to narrow
down the movement and to split the mobilization by Red-baiting
its militant elements, it achieved immense strength and support.

When the second session of the 81st Congress convened
January 3, the problem before the sincere friends of F .E.P.C.
was the familiar one——how to bring the Powell bill to the floor.

House rules provide four methods to bring a bill. to the ﬂoor.

7

    

  

The first and usual method is for the Rules Committee to
“grant the bill a rule,” which is another way of saying: to schedule
the bill for debate and vote on the House ﬂoor.

The second method is to use “Discharge‘Mondays.” This
method, provided for in the 21-day rule voted by the House a
year ago, makes it possible for the House to act on a bill which
the Rules committee has bottled up for 21 days or more. The
chairman of the legislative committee which sponsored the bill
can take the floor on the second or fourth Monday of each month
and call up the bill directly, provided he is “recognized” by the
House Speaker.

The third method is the “discharge petition.” A bill may be
brought to the floor if 218 members sign a petition.

The fourth method is “Calendar Wednesday.” Each Wednes-
day according to the rules, the clerk must call the roll of commit-
tee chairmen. When his name is called, the committee chairman
may call up any bill previously approved by his committee.

When the leadership of the House, backed by a small but
vigorous minority, opposes a measure, it is extremely diﬂicult to
succeed by any of these methods. Sincere friends of F.E.P.C., led
in the main by Powell and Marcantonio, prepared to try all four.

THE RULES COMMITTEE

Through Chairman John Lesinski (D.-Mich.) of the House
Labor Committee, they succeeded in bringing the Powell bill
before the Rules Committee. But here the coalition of Republicans
and Southern Democrats, with a majority of eight of the 12
members of that committee, took over. On January 17, while
4,000 delegates to the National Emergency Civil Rights Mobiliza-
tion were lobbying for passage of F .E.P.C., the Rules Committee
refused to take action on F .E.P.C. Its chairman, Rep. Adolph
Sabath (D.-Ill.), faced by -the obstructive tactics of the coalition,
adjourned the meeting and rushed angrily from the committee
room. But the coalition stayed on and by a 7 to 2 vote authorized
its leader, Rep. Gene Cox (D.-Ga.), to call up his resolution to
repeal the 21-day rule. \

This was a serious blow to F .E.P.C. Not only did it for the
moment block House consideration of the Powell bill through the
8 .

 

Rules Committee route—it threatened to close up another avenue,
that of “Discharge Mondays.”

There was an immediate and effective drive by progressive and
liberal organizations, especially the organizations of the Negro
people, to save the 21-day rule. Although both Speaker of the
House Sam Rayburn (D.-Tex.) and Minority Leader Joe Martin
(R.-Mass.) denied that this issue in any way involved F .E.P.C.,
everyone knew that it did. Marcantoniolput it bluntly: “A vote
for the Cox resolution repealing the 21-day rule is a vote against
F .E.P.C.’ ’

Reﬂecting the strength of the organized Negro and progressive
groups, and particularly the great breadth of the civil rights mobili-
zation, only 85 Southern Democrats and 98 Republicans, making
a total of 183, voted for the Cox resolution. On the other hand
64 Republicans from urban districts joined with 171 Democrats
and with Marcantonio to defeat Cox’s trick.

This vote took place on Friday, January 20. It left the way
clear for “Discharge Monday” on January 23 when the Truman
Administration and the G.O.P. leadership would have the oppor-
tunity to call up the Powell bill and promptly pass it, thus fulﬁlling
their solemn campaign pledges.

It is now history that the Truman Administration did not take
advantage of that opportunity. On the contrary, Truman’s chief
leader in the House, Speaker Rayburn, and his second-in-command,
Majority leader John McCormack (D.-Mass.) prevented the
Powell bill from coming to a vote.

This is the way it was done.

SHAMEFUL MONDAY

Although Rep. Lesinski had announced that he would take the
ﬂoor on January 23 and seek recognition so that he might call up
the Powell bill, Rayburn let it be known that he would not recog-
nize Lesinski. — '

“I don’t think there is the right atmosphere in the House for
F .E.P.C. after that rules ﬁght on Friday,” Rayburn lamely ex-
plained to us reporters shortly before the House convened on
Monday.

Nevertheless when the House got down to business that day,
