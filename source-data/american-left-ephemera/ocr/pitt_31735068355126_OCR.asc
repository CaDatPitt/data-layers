 lAGE increases for most Mine-Mill members will go into cents per hour__ _

  ORGANIZING

effect July 1 in accordance with contracts negotiated by
‘the Union last June. Increases range from 6 to 12 cents
per hour. _ _

Similar pay hikes went into effect July 1, 1962 ‘along
with substantial improvements in fringe benefits for
almost all Mine-Mill members.

Following is the schedule of wage increases for this
year: .

0 American Smelting & Refining Company operations: .
wage increases ranging from 8 to 111/2 cents.at all plants

except El Paso and Hayden, which will receive 81/2 to 12
cents. Higher rates at El Paso and Hayden are a step
toward‘ elimination of Southwest pay differentials. The
differential in the Kennecott properties between Arizona-
New Mexico and Utah-Nevada was completely eliminated
last year. ‘ , ’

O Anaconda operations: general wage increase of 7_ 1/2
cents. ‘
_' O Kennecott Western Mining Division: general.-in-
crease of 6 cents per hour. ‘
_ 0_Anaconda American Brass: wage increases ranging
from 5 to 9 cents per hour.

0 Phelps-Dodge Southwest operations: 81/2 cents
across the board, plus 1/1.-cent increments between job
grades up to 111/22 cents.

0 San Manuel and Magma: 81/2 cents across the board
plus 1/i-cent increments between job grades up to 11%
cents. \

Pace Setting H&W Program «

A pattern—setting Health and Welfare program was
included in last year’s contracts with Kennecott. Mine-Mill
members and their dependents now are entitled to almost
complete medical, hospital, and surgical care at company
expense. '

The overall program for employees, dependents," and

‘pensioners——developed out of hundreds of hours -of pre-
liminary work, research, and conferences—is considered ..

to be one of the best in this or any other industry.

At Anaconda, employees won increased shift differen-
tials, improved HMS coverage, two weeks vacation after
three years, increased premium pay for holidays, and
many other important benefits.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

June, 1953

World Mourns ‘Pope of Peace’

As The Union goes to press, the whole world mourns
the death of Pope John XXIII. Elected as a “compromise”
interim Pope, his four aand one-half year stewardship of the
Holy See was one of the most significant periods in the 2,000

year history of the Church.

The Holy Father’s greatest achievements were his two
Encyclicals Mater et Magistra (Mother and Teacher) and
Pacem in Terris (Peace on Earth) and his efforts toward
Church unity culminating in the first session of the Ecumeni-

cal Council last year.

In Mater et Magz'stra'Pope John stressed that the condi-
tions of twentieth century industrial life demanded new
social institutions to protect the welfare of the people.

Pacem in Terms pointed out that all institutions and
social systems devised by the peoples of the world for their
own betterment contained something of value, and. called
for mutual respect and understanding to secure world peace.

Pope John’s efforts to heal the breach in the relations
among the world’s religious groups was perhaps epitomized
by his revision of certain Church rituals considered offen-
sive by Jews. His extensive audiences with Protestant lead-
ers were to many a signal that the Church’s attitude toward
“schismatic” groups would soften. '

This humble son of working class parents, elevated to
Prince of the Church, has left the world Prince of Peace.
His last words: Ut unum sunt—Let them be one.

Support Mounts for Union
In ‘Conspiracy’ Defense

Response to Mine-Mill’s appeal to labor leaders for support in fighting the “con-
spiracy” case has made it clear that organized labor is no longer on the defensive in

this matter.

Transport Workers

Michael J . Quill, president of
the Transport Workers Union,
has written to Attorney General
Robert Kennedy that “Ideologi-
cal subversion is not among the
ills of the labor movement today
and I can see no deterrent value
in the harassment of (Mine-
Mill) or any other union on that
score. Our country, however,
urgently needs a wider respect
for the civil rights of all its
citizens, When governmental
prosecution takes on the aspects
of harassment, the cause of civil
rights generally is seriously set
back. ‘

“I believe that when you re-

examine the history and the ‘

M-M Delegation to Washington
Gathers Support for Petition

(Continued from page 1)
Tsumeb, which is 60 percent
American owned, is building its
own smelter in South Africa,
and the South African govern-
ment has asked the United
States to allow substitution of
refined metal in South Africa’s

quota of lead concentrate.

Commission Said No

As reported in the last issue
of The Union, Mine-Mill had sup-
ported AS&R’s application to
the U. S. Tariff Commission for
a revision of the import quotas.
The Commission’s decision, in
effect, said that only the Pres-
ident could alter the quotas,
since they had been established
by presidential executive order
in 1958. AS&R, rather than ap-
peal directly to the President,
opened the negotiations with
Tsumeb. ‘

Mine-Mill officers decided that
“the situation was too serious
for us to sit back to await the
outcome of negotiations . . ."
Research Director Arthur Stuart
was dispatched to Washington
the third week in April to ‘in-
vestigate behind-the-scenes
moves by Tsumeb, the South
African government, and the
U. S. lead mining companies’
Washington lobby.

Letter to Kennedy

On April 30, Secretary-Treas-
urer Irving Dichter wrote Pres-
ident Kennedy appealing, for
“appropriate government action
. . . to avert the threatened loss
of lead concentrate imports and
the widely ramified adverse con-
sequences which would other-
wise ensue.”

- Avreply from the White House
came over the signature of John
B. Rehm, General Counsel for
the Office of the Special Repre-
sentative for Trade Negotia-
tions. Rehm told Dichter that,
since AS&R had not petitioned
the President but was “pursu-
ing an alternative course of ac-
tion which may solve the prob-
lem to which you refer,” the
White-House “would prefer not
to begin consideration of your
proposal under circumstances
which might make such consid-

El Paso Speedup

The management of AS&R’s
El Paso smelter is taking ad-
vantage of the present uncer-
tainty by instituting a speed-
up campaign to show New
York they can keep costs down
and demonstrate that the
smelter ought to be kept in
operation. AS&R Council Co-
ordinator Irving Dichter has
advised the El Paso local and
any other locals which may be
affected to “resist this cold-
blooded attempt to playon the
anxiety of the workers to
break down established work-
ing conditions and standards.”

eration either premature or uns
necessary.” ‘

No Assurance

AS&R officials have informed
Mine-Mill that negotiations with
Tsumeb are ‘‘slow’’ and. that
there is no assurance that they
will be successful.

Mine-Mill Delegation
The Mine-Mill delegation to
Washington, led “by Secretary-

Treasurer Dichter, consisted of

Vice Presidents Asbury Howard
and Al Skinner, President Al-
fredo Ayala and Juan Aranda of
El Paso Local 509; President
John Infusino of Perth Amboy
Local 365; President Raymond
Thompson of Baltimore Local
625; President J. B. Chavez of
El Paso Local 501; Richard
Schill of Omaha Local 461;
Anthony Connell of East Helena
Local 72 and Charles Oberlander
of 625.

Members of the delegation

"met with officials of the State

Department and the Department
of Commerce. Robert L. McNeil,
the Commerce Department-’s
Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Trade Policy, indicated that he
was sympathetic to the Union’s
suggestion for reallocation of
the quotas and that he would so
recommend when the matter
was referred to his Department.

Help from Congressmen
Rep. Ed Foreman of El Paso
turned over his office and secre-

tarial staff to-the delegation and
agreed to serve on a committee
of. congressmen to ‘arrange a
meeting with the President to
present the Union’s position.
Other congressmen "who agreed
to serve on-the committee in-
clude Senator Tower, Rep. Ar-
nold Olsen of Montana, and Rep.
Glenn Cunningham of Nebraska.

The delegation also met with
Rep. Edward J. Patten of New
Jersey, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez
of Texas, and Senator Yarbor-
ough, all of whom pledged full
support.

Rep. Udall Meets
Mine-Mill Group

HAYDEN, Ariz.—A commit-
tee of local union leaders headed
by Int’l Rep. Jacob Mercado
met with Rep. Morris Udall at
the Mine-Mill Union Hall here.

The committee discussed with
Rep. Udall the Mine-Mill “con-
spiracy” case and the Early Re-
tirement bill introduced in Con-
gress by Rep. Joseph Montoya
of New Mexico.

Ask Help for El Paso

‘ The committee also urged
Udall to appeal to President
Kennedy to do something about
the threatened shutdown of the
El Paso AS&R Plant because of
cut-off next September of the
lead concentrates now going to
El Paso. They pointed out that
a petition on this matter filed
with the Tarriff Commission by
our International Union had
been turned down by the Com-
mission. '

Members of Union committee
in addition to Mercado: Robert
L. Ramirez, Vice Pres. Local
939 Hayden; Carlos R. Alvarado,
Local 939 Hayden; Tina Torres,
Local 886 Hayden; Carlos V.
Ortega, Rec. Sec. Local 886

ness Agent, Local 938 Superior;

zales, Fin. Sec. Local 915 Ray.

nature of the indictments in
this case, you will agree with
me that the cause of justice will
best be served by moving for a
dismissal of these indictments.”

Grain Millers

Roy 0. Wellborn, President of
the American Federation of
Grain Millers, has written Mine-
Mill President John Clark in-
dicating that his union agrees
the case should be dropped,
“and let the American Labor
Movement handle its own prob-
lems in its own way. We will be
happy to join with other Inter-
national people in pursuing this
matter.” a

Farmers Union

James G. Patton, president of
the National Farmers Union,
has written the Attorney Gen-
eral associating himself with
the positions taken on the Mine-
Mill case by Norman Thomas
and by the 18th Constitutional
Convention of the United Auto-
mobile Workers. The UAW
resolution stated: “The con-
spiracy prosecution of the. lead-
ers of Mine-Mill . . was a
transparent effort to use this
ancient anti-union device .to
avoid the necessity of proving
the actual filing of . . . false
affidavits. The proceeding be-
fore the Subversive Activities
Control Board is an assault upon
the rights of free speech and
free association of all unions.”

Civil Liberties Union

In a letter to President Ken-
nedy, the Colorado branch of the
American Civil Liberties Union
asked him to intervene with the
Department of Justice for a re-
consideration “of the decision to
re-try the leaders of the Mine,
Mill Union» oncharges of con-
spiracy in connection with the
now repealed, non-communist

affidavit provision of the Taft-
Hartley Act.”

, Trade unions abroad have
come to the defense of Mine-
Mill and its leaders.

All-India TUC

The All-India Trade Union
Congress has written the At-
torney General that “The news
that the seven defendants in
the Mine-Mill Conspiracy Case
are to he retried is causing a
great concern _to the trade
unions in our country. . . . The
trusted leaders of the Inter-
national Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers, one of the
oldest unions in the U.S.A.,e are
being retried . . . to suppress

‘the democratic trade union

movement with the help of anti-
labour legislation. . . . We urge
upon you to consider thepublic
opinion in your country -and
elsewhere and drop the case

‘altogether in the interests of

Trade Unions and the demo-
cratic rights of the workers.”

British Stevedores

W. P. Hegarty of the National
Amalgamated Stevedores and
Dockers in England has written
to President Clark that “Your
fight is the fight for true De-_
mocracy, the freedom of thought
and the right of Civil Liberty.
1 do not profess to understand
the United States law, but it
does seem to me to savour of
Dictatorship by reviving the
charges after they have been
relegated to the dusty files of
the Appeals Court. ‘ A

“. . . We gladly offer our sup-
port, and wish you every suc-
cess in the coming months, and
the sincere hope that your At-
torney General may see the
wisdom and justice in dropping
all charges against your Offi-
cers.”

THE AMINE-MILL UNION

3

Appear Re-elected
In Unofficial Tally

DENVER——Unofficial reports on the International‘

Union referendum of May 21 indicate re-election of all
incumbent officers and board members who were candi-
dates for re-election to the same position. President John
Clark wasnot a candidate; unofficial returns indicate that
his successor will be the present Western Vice President,
Al Skinner. In the newly-created District 3 there was no

incumbent; Int’l Rep. Verne Curtis appears to have won -

this contest.

The convention nominations and referendum had
been conducted under terms of the new officer and district

structure adopted in last year’s
referendum: the number of vice

-presidents was cut to one, and

the districts to 5.

If the unofficial reports are
substantiated by the Canvassing
Committee when it meets the
week of June 17, the new In-
ternational Executive B 0 a r (1

.will be: President, Al Skinner;

Vice President, Asbury Howard;

Secretary - Treasurer, I r v in g ,

Dichter; District 1 Board Mem-
ber, Barney Rask; District 2
Board Member, Maclovio Bar-
raza; District 3 Board Mem-
ber, Verne Curtis; District 4
Board Member, Ray ‘Dennis;
District 5 Board Member, Al-
fred Petit-Clair.

Under terms of the Interna-
tional Union Constitution, no
one is elected to any office un-
til certified as the winner by
the Canvassing Committee. This
body is elected by each Con-
vention. Each district nomi-
nates one of its members to
serve on the Canvassing Com-
mittee; thesevnominees are vot-
ed on by the entire Convention.

When the Committee meets,
it will elect one of its mem-
bers as chairman and another
as secretary. A notary public
will be present at all commit-
tee sessions and will certify
the results.

An interesting letter from a Union olol—timer came recently to
Secretary—Treasurer Irving Dlchter at the International office in
Denver. lt_is trom Brother Art lvlantyla, Financial Secretary ot
Local 203. Juneau, Alaska. Some excerpts tollow.

Just want to let you know how
everything is moving along up
here.

First of all we have had a
very nice winter. Only two snow
falls that gave us any trouble.
We had over 40” drop on us
the first few days of April. It
was a little rough on some of
the people from the lower States.
The last two weeks have been
real nice. Sunshine every day.
I’m on a swing shi-ft so can
catch up on my books, writing,
etc.

We have started our negotia-
tions for 1963 but so far the

company hasn’t answered our
letter. Of course you know how
that goes.

‘The Alaska Light and Power
has installed a large diesel gen-

erator which will cut out some

‘of our power.

The Alaska Juneau Indus-
tries are laying off four of
our men the first of May. We
don’t know how many more
will be laid off later. That kind
of gives the comp.any a club to
hold over our heads (go easy
on the _1963 contract as we may
have to shut down). We will
soon find out.

Speaking of Unions—My Dad
belonged to the Western Federa-
tion of Miners in Butte, Mon-
tana, a good many years ago. I
still have his fancy badge they
wore in parades.

‘We lived in Butte when the
miners blew up their own hall.
I have belonged to Unions» since

1919, that was Local 104 Boiler-
makers. Since then I’ve been
in the Building Trades, Painters,
I. S. U., and several others.

We have to keep up that old
struggle, because we sure as
heck won’t get anything handed
to us on a silver platter.

I hate strikes, but some times
they are necessary. It’s too bad
some people can’t understand
why a working man would like
to chew on a T-bone once in_a
while. When I was a kid (I
believe it was the hard winter

COPE Report on ‘Class of ’58’

Reacfionaries Already Gunning for Progressive
Senators in '64; Strong LaborSupporf Needed

When liberals talk about the Class of ’58 they’re not
referring to the graduates of Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton or Podunk College, but to the men who were elect-
ed to the United States Senate that year. By and large,
the Class of ’58 has produced more progressive, pro-
labor senators than any other group in recent years.

The class of ’58 comes up again in 1964. Its mem-
bers either will get the go-ahead from the voters for
a six-year postgraduate course, or will be uncere-
moniously ﬂunked.

One thing is certain: the manpower of the reaction-
aries and the money of big business will be poured
into an all-out effort to rout Class of ’58 liberals. The
right wingers know -that if they are successful in ’64,
conservatives will hold effective control of the Senate
-for years to come.

Targefs Picked

They are determined to win, and they have picked
out their targets well in advance.

In Wyoming, for example, the John Birchers and
other rightists who have gained a’ stranglehold on the
state are tnaining their big guns on liberal Gale McGee.
In Ohio, the conservatives are out to get Stephen M.
Young; in Maine, Ed Muskie. Other members of the

' Class of ’58 on the rub-’em-out roster of the right wing

are:
- lair Engle of California, Vance Hartke of Indiana,
Phil Hart of Michigan,.Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota,
Howard Cannon of Nevada, Harrison Williams of New
Jersey, Frank Moss of Utah, Robert Byrd of West
Virginia. ‘ _
Other liberals hand-picked for the treatment by
ultra-conservatives next year, non—members of the

Class of ’58, are; Quentin Burdick of North Dakota,
Ralph Yarborough of Texas, William Proxmire of Wis-
consin, Mike Mansfield of Montana and Albert Gore of
Tennessee.

In all, a total of 22 liberals and moderates will be
running for the Senate in 1964, and only 12 conserva-

-tives will be on the block.

Ulfras Already in Action

Small wonder Americans for Constitutional Action,
the John Birch Society, American Farm Bureau Fed-
eration, National Association of Manufacturers, U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and other ultra-conservative
groups have launched their campaigns already. They
hope to bag a big catch for their trophy rooms and to
oust liberal incumbents, replacing them with reaction-
aries.

Typical of their strategy and tactics is the method

now being applied in Wyoming as they try to march .

Gale McGee to the guillotine.

Birchers in 'Wyoming' .

It is no secret in Wyoming that -the John Birch So-
ciety is in the saddle, It seems to control the reins
on a state legislature that has passed‘ a phony “right
to work” law; adopted three right-wing sponsored
resolutions calling for a curb on the U.S. Supreme
Court and altering procedures for amending the'Con-
stitution; put through a reapportionment plan to
strengthen rather than diminish rural control of state
government; urged Congress-to kill foreign aid ‘and to
getthe U.S. out of the UN and vice versa.

There are only 23 radio stations in the state of
Wyoming, and 15 of them are on $1,000 a month re-

tainer of a coalition of rightist groups. Every day.
hours of taped programs produced by extremists Billy

James Hargis, Dan Smoot, and other ultras foul the

airwaves and brainwash the citizenry.

Three John Birch Society organizers have invaded
Wyoming from outside the state to mastermind the
attack against McGee and liberal programs.

For months, the John Birch crowd has swung into
action with midnight phone calls to leaders and mem-
bers of any organization inviting McGee as a speaker.

Matters have reached such a preposterous extreme
that McGee was temporarily denied permission to
speak at the University of Wyoming, the same Univer-
sity at which he taught history and political science
for 12 years before his election to the Senate. -

Meanwhile, McGee’s- office in Washington has been
deluged with hate mail from rightists. So have the of
fices of most congressional liberals. ,—

Seniorify of Sfake
There is more at stake than simply the winning
or losing of a cluster of seats in the Senate. The liber-
als up for election. in ’64 have been building up senior-
ity during the past six years. In the Senate, seniority
is the crucial key to committee leadership and influ-

ence, and it is" the committees and their subcommit- .

tees that shape bills and either boost or bury them.

Presently, most committees ﬂounder under con-
servative leadership of Dixiecrats, who flash the red
light to block good legislation. If liberals can continue
to accumulate seniority, they will eventually take over
as chairmen of important committees, smoothing the
path for progressive laws.

THE NEW NEGBO SAYS
THE TIME IS Now

By ASBURY HOWARD
International Vice President

THE so-called “solid, south” is not

D.
so solid any more.

Events of the recent past and of the present clearly show
that the Negro people of the South are on the march for
freedom now. Their struggles have focused the attention
of the nation and_..of the entire world on their desires and
their demands. This is a new and a historic develop-
ment. The President and the Attorney General of the

United States have been made to recognize

the depth of this struggle.

This is a movement of truly new dimen-
sions. It is destroying old myths and old
concepts. Involved in this new movement is
the New Negro, who has decided that the
. not some other time, but

timeis NOW . .
NOW.

President Kennedy, recognizing the gravi-
ty of the situation, called a group of 100
prominent businessmen to meet with him
at the White House to work out ways and
means of removing some of the roadblocks
to freedom in the South. These business. ex-
ecutives were primarily from the North, but

Howard

they hold the controlling interest in movie houses, restaurants,

stores, hotels and motels in the

THIS is of great importance,
in view of the fact that it is
these northern giants of indus-
try and commerce who are the
real rulers of the so-called “sol-
id south.” Take Birmingham,
for example, where the water
hoses and police dogs were mer-
cilessly turned loose against
men, women and children.
These northern manufacturers,
merchants and bankers are_ the
real rulers. The top industrial
company in Jefferson County
(where Birmingham is located)
is U. S. Steel, father of Tennes-
see Coal & Iron of Birmingham,
Bessemer and Fairfield. Bir-
mingham is also the home of a
power and acid plant owned by
the Dupont Company. Such
huge packing companies as Ar-
mour of Chicago not only have
moved their operations to Bir-
mingham and other southern
cities, but have reimposed the
notorious ‘wage differential with
wage cuts that have affected
many workers, both Negro and
White.

*‘A'*

THE 13th,‘ 14th and 15th
amendments to the United
States Constitution are promis-
sory notes made to the Negro
nearly a century ago. For that
many years the Negro has been
requesting payment of those
notes.

The new movement under the
leadership of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Rev. Ralph D. Aber-

South.

nathy and Rev. F. L. Shuttles-
worth is not requesting but is
demanding that these notes be
paid Il0W\.j10t five years from
now, not one year from now,
not tomorrow, but now.

The Negro has had a yearn-
ing for freedom that has built

up like steam in a boiler. Now '

it has burst out, and all the
snarling, snapping, biting dogs,
high pressure water hoses, po-
lice and state troopers’ brutali-
ty will not stop it. Am_erica is
called “The land of the free and
the home of the brave.” When
I watched the forward march of
the demonstrators in Birming-
ham, I thought: Truly this is
the home of'the brave.

*‘k*k

SOUTHERN Negroes in their
quest for human dignity and
freedom expect to have to fight
segregationists, but unfortunate-
ly we have had to fight the mod-
erates, too, every step of the
way. As Rev. Shuttlesworth
said: “The moderates are.the
greatest force holding back
progress today.”

The segregationist says “No”
and his meaning is clear. The
moderate says “Yes, you should
have your rights, but don’t do
anything about it, or at least
don’t push too fast. Just wait
and we will take care of it.”

If we follow that. counsel we
leave the field open to the seg-
regationists to have their way.
The New Negro has learned this
lesson. He will not wait.

Birmingham Will Never

The Rev. Ralph D. Aberncithy 6': the’ Southern Christian

Convention, has been widely quoted in a Birmingham speech.

“We may not "get all7 of what we want all at once, but
you can rest assured the ;city -of- Birmingham will never be

days of setback ahead in the Negro’s. struggle for first class

aborin Rights Fight  

Recent events in Birmingham will be written in history as the opening skirmish

in a major war against racial intolerance. Across the nation the month of. May

.marked massive demonstrations not only supporting Negro protests in the South but ‘

also demanding an end to Northern discrimination which “hides behind a smile.”
The helping hand of organized labor was in evidence in many of the projects

undertaken in recent weeks to
raise money and public and
political support for integra-
tion efforts.

20.000 March in
San Francisco

By far the largest such
demonstration was a Human
Rights Day parade in San
Francisco, organized by a la-
bor-ministerial‘ committee,
which turned out 20,000 people
—Negroes and whites in ap-
proximately equal numbers—in
a "march up Market Street~‘to
the Civic Plaza.

San Francisco Chronicle re-V

porter J. Campbell Bruce de-
scribed the marchers as “of all
faiths—rabbis, Protestant min-
isters of the San Francisco
Council of Churches, Maryknoll
nuns, Christian brothers, a
Jesuit priest.

“They were of all classes, but
predominantly labor, and the
labor group predominantly long-
shoremen.” I L W U President

Harry Bridges marched at the ,

head of the line with a group of
clergymen and sculptor Benji-
amino Bufano.

Mine-Mill Locals

Mine-Mill Locals 50, 51, and
266 participated in the parade,
led by Regional Director Tom
McGuire and Percy‘Edmonds
of Local 50.

Rev. Bernard Lee, of Martin
Luther King’s Southern Chris-
ti a n Leadership Conference,
spoke at the rally at the Civic
Center and roused the crowd
with an emotion-packed speech:

“They say Negroes are not
ready for their freedom . . .
But we are saying to this Na-

"Stand back everybody! He's

tion: ‘Ready or not, here we
come!”’

Chicago Marchers
Led by Gregory

In Chicago, 3,000 Negroes and
whites, led by comedian Dick
Gregory, marched around City
Hall and proceeded to Congress
Plaza in a demonstration aimed
at job discrimination, police
brutality, housing segregation,
and political monkeying with
relief funds. Gregory,‘ fresh
from Birmingham jail and with
his arm in a sling, told the
rally “the difference between
Northern and Southern discrimi-
nation is simple: in the South,

got a bomb!" .

they don’t care how close the
Negro gets as long as he -doesn’t
get too big. In the North, they
don’t care how big we get, as
long as we don’t get too close.”
The rally had substantial la-
bor support from the, Packing-
house Workers, UAW, and
many other unions. UAW leader
Pat Greathouse told the “crowd
that solidarity- between labor
and the Negro people.-was es-
sential to both movements.

‘I Must Have Been Wrong,’
Saysa Birmingham Judge

One indication of a change in Birmingham is a new kind of reporting in the press.
The Birmingham News, one of the city’s major newspapers, published an Associated
Press story on May 9 titled “Both Sides——And Human-Side.” Perhaps it will help an-
swer the question: Why did the Negro children brave dogs, fire hoses, beatings and
jail? Did they know what they were fighting for?

Here are some excerpts:

Judge Talbot Ellis sits behind
his desk. He has crisp gray
hair, a clean-cut profile. He
speaks in a low, kindly voice.

On the other side of the desk
is a .15-year-old Negro youth,
Grosbeck Preer Parham. He is
big for his age. He was arrested
five days ago for participating
in disturbances that have been
wracking the city.

*‘k‘k

' A small carved sign on the

desk bears the motto, “Prayer .

changes everything.”
Behind Judge Talbot is the

" boy’s mother, Mrs. Aileen Par-

ham. She is tall, nice looking
with an intelligent‘ expression.
She has come to the juvenile
court, where children under 16
are being held, to get her son
released.

This is the dialogue between
the three-—

Judge: “Grosbeck, I’m going
to let you go. Your mother must
have been mighty worriediwhen
she couldn’t find you. Why did
you tell the officer you were
17? That’s why they put you in
jail instead of bringing‘ you
here.” ’ 0

Boy: “I said I was 15.”.

Judge: “Now Grosbeck, you
know violence in the streets is
not the answer to this. Just.the
other day, Attorney General
Kennedy -said, ‘this problem
‘won’t be solved in the streets.’

: And I often think of-whatone

of the founding -fathers’ said,

-“There is no freedom without

restraint.’.Now, I want you to

go home and go back to school.

Will you do that?”

No answer.=The boy stares at
the judge, unbli-nking through
his spectacles. Hisvjaw juts up-
ward. .
Judge: “Are you mad at me,
son?” , _ ‘

0 Boy: “Can I say something?”
Judge: “Anything you like."
Boy: “Well, you can say that

about freedom because you’ve

got your freedom. The Constitu-
tion says we’re all equal but

Negroes aren’t equal.” . ’
Judge: “But your people have

made greatgains and they still‘ '

are. It takes time.” ~

Boy: ' “We’ve been waiting
over 100 years.” ‘

Mother: “May I say some-

thing? I don’t» approve of street

violence either. But after a civil
rights meeting we did try to
get in touch with city officials
and they wouldn’t see us. And
I know this, Judge -—f- these
younger people are not going to
take what we took. I have an-

other son in Oberlin (college, —

Ohio). and he’ll never want to
come back here.” '

‘k'k-it

She- describes her experiences
as a shopper in downtown Bir-
mingham and continues-'

“If I’m going to spend my
money in the stores, I think I
should have the right to sit
down’ and eat a sandwich in

them.”

Judge: . “Mrs. Parham, what

do you think of Booker T.‘

Washington?” . .

' $750. '

Mother: “I think he was 5
fine man. But his day is past.

The younger people won’t take .

what we did.”

Boy: “Does Birmingham have
a health board? Are they ‘con-
cerned about what happens to
Negroes in jail?” .

The judge nods affirmatively.

Boy: “We were picked up at
2:30 and we didn't get anything
to eat all day. The next morn-’

ing we wouldn't ahave; gotten 
anything either "if we .?hadn’t~
gotten together ‘and tdaeatl on the  ’

Harlem in the Rain

A thunder storm burst upon

some 5,000 Harlem Negroes at-
tending a rally at 125th Street
and 7th Avenue in New ‘York
on May 14. Rev. A. D. King,

' younger brother of Martin Lu-

ther King and pastor of the
First Baptist Church in Bir-
mingham, told his wet but high-
spirited audience that “The

At the conclusion of King’s
speech, Retail, Wholesale, and

65 Secretary-Treasurer Cleve-
land Robertson presented King
with the union’s check for
$5,000, representing part of the
collection raised by District 65

speeded up the union’s year-
long Freedom Fund Campaign.

Mike Mann, AFL-CIO regional
representative, said, “We have
come here not to ask, we have
come here to demand action.
All over America and all over
the world there is disgust with
the events‘ in Alabama. We
have seen it in Nazi Germany
and Fascist Italy. Let’s not kid
ourselves; we know the score.”

Building Trades Bias

A sour note in the chorus of
labor support for the integra-
tion movement was sounded in
Philadelphia, where the NAACP
and the Philadelphia Human
Relations Commission attacked
the building trades unions for
discrimination in hiring. Public
works were being built in Phila-
delphia with segregated labor
because of the unions’ refusal
to admit Negroes to member-
ship. V

A massive demonstration at
City Hall, followed by rioting
and battles with police, resulted
eventually in an agreement be-
tween the NAACP and the build-
ing trades unions to integrate
the unions. Several building
projects were integrated im-
mediately. -

Capital Finally Feels
Pressure of Events

WASHINGTOl_\T—Congress is feeling the pressure of events in the hot civil rights
area. Just as Birmingham seems to have marked a new stage in the struggle for equal
rights, so‘ it alsontriggered an _agon_izii_ig reappraisal on._the Hill. Earlier strategy for
another modest Administration bill is being revised and should emerge shortly from
the White House as a special message.

Democratic leaders sense they are on the hot seat;

jserious repercussions next year.
.Sen. Humphrey, the assistant
majority leader, summed up a
“widely held view” (N.Y.
Times) when he said President
Kennedy can get meaningful
legislation this year “if he
works at it and is prepared to

. put up with a 30-day filibuster.”

Time for a showdown

ing. The House Rules Commit-
tee and a determined Senate

-filibuster are not easily over-
come. The times, however, ap-3

pear ripe for just such a show-
down with the Establishment.

Given some effective leader-
ship from the White House, the‘
country might respond suffici-
ently to turn the lackadaisical
88th Congress upside-down.
There might even be such a
thing as some Capitol Hill sit-
ins against the use of undemo-
cratic procedures in the legisla-
tive process. And a militant
demonstration of the people’s
will on civil rights would have
no end of effects on other leg-
islation. ‘

Voting Rights, suit

The three-way tug of war be-
tween state legislatures, Con-
gress, and the Supreme Court,
strained to the breaking point
by the Court’s decision in the
Tennessee reapportionment
case, threatens to get even
rougher if the NAACP is suc-
cessful in its recently-instituted
suit to enforce the Fourteenth
Amendment. The Amendment

Arbitration

Kennecott’s Nevada Mines
Division will have to supply
safety shoes to employees
at its own expense, accord-
ing to a May 27 decision by
Arbitrator Howard Dur-
ham of Redwood City, Cal.

Mine-Mill Locals 124 at Ruth
and 233 at McGill were repre-
sented in the proceedings by
Regional Director Verne Curtis.

On February 1 of thisyear the‘
Company issued a notice to all

employees that they would be

’ required to wear special .hard- .

toedi. safety shoes on the job, to

be purchased at their own ex- .

pense. . .

The Union contended that, ac-
cording to the contract the com-
pany agreed to “continue pres-
ent practice regarding the fur-
nishing of necessary clothing
and gloves to employees whose
duties require them to work in

places in which special attire ’

is necesary for health and
safety.”

The company argued that be-
causethe shoes could be worn,
off the job as well as on, and
had the same appearance as

ordinary work shoes, they were -

not “special attire”- within the

' ..meaning ofthe contract.

Durham found that other
items furnished by the company
were sometimes ‘worn off» the
job, and..that in any ca_se noth-
ing prevented the company
from requiring that the em-

ployees change shoes before and -

after work. -
Durham concluded, “I find

‘Equal pay forwomen

A labor-backed equal pay law
for women now appears set.
Separate bills, differing only in
details, have passed thelsenate
and House, and should easily
in conference.
The basic thrust of the legisla-
tion requires that equal work

be compensated with equal pay, -

regardless of the sex of . the
workers.

Coverage will embrace only
employers subject to the Fair
Labor Standards Act and its
minimum wage provision. Equal
pay will not be required in
hotels, restaurants, laundries,

Aid to education

Mainly because of the deter-'
mination of Rep. Edith Green
and a few other independent
liberals, at least one aid-for-
education bill has a fighting
chance this year. It’s the High-
er Education ‘Facilities
(HR 6143), authorizing a 3-year,
$1,195,000,000 program of fed-
eral help for construction or im-
provement of higher education,
facilities. The bill skips stu-
dent scholarships, the issue that
bogged down a similar measure
last year; Reported by the
House Education and Labor
Committee _May 21, HR 6143
now goes to the Rules Commit-
tee with strong bipartisan sup-
port.
Improved iobless pay plan

Administration proposals to
update the unemployment com-
pensation system have been in-
troduced as bills in both cham-
bers. Rep. King sponsored the
House bill (HR 6339) and Sen.
McCarthy, along with 12 co-
sponsors, the Senate bill (S.
1532). _

President Kennedy urged
Congress to act promptly on
t h i s long-postponed overhaul,
but there’s no indication of re-
sponse so far. The Ways and
Means Committee is the start-
ing place for this legislation,

Women Lobby for Peace

. Capitol Hill got a much need- i S

ed reminder May 8 that peace
is not a dirty word. Some 2,000
determined members of Women
Strike for Peace ’ sw-ar-m ed
through House and Senate office
buildings, lobbying in favor of
-a nuclear test ban treaty. They
button-holed congressmen or
their assistants, guards, clerks,
elevator operators, anyone in
their path.

They held a mass meeting on
the Capitol steps, booed Sen.
J avits when he tried to defend
Sen. Keating and Gov. Rocke-
feller. They got their message
across no matter what—vigor-
ously, forthrightly. Washington
could do -with more of this;
especially the kind of militancy
the womenfolk seem to pack.

_Straw poll on test ban
The. President has a remark-

able sense of history, and he --
must feel very uncomfortable

about the results of a straw poll
conducted by Sen. Clark’s office
on prospects for a test ban treaty.
President Wilson, after ' fight-
ing successfully for the League
of Nations at Versailles, lost his
hopes for world peace when the
Senate refused ratification.
Clark’s poll indicated that, if

the. Russians agreed to every.

detail of the U.S. proposal for
a test ban, the treaty would fail
in the Senate.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

  

June. iota

Canadian District 2
Parley in Sudbury

SUDBURY, Ont.—-The convening here of the Ca-
nadian District 2 convention May 4-5 served to re-empha-
size the growing strength of Mine-Mill in this center of

the nickel-mining industry.

The host local, Sudbury Mine, Mill and Smelters
Local 598, embraces some 2,200 members under contract

at Falconbridge as well as a

swelling membership among
workers at International Nickel
who pay cash dues to Mine-Mill.

Highlights of the convention
were a blistering attack on the
Ontario Labor Relations Board,
and speeches by International
Vice President Asbury Howard
and UE’s Canadian Vice Presi-
dent Jean Pare. Other speakers
included the Canadian National
Officers: President Ken Smith,
Vice Presidents Harvey Mur-
phy and Mike Solski, Secretary-
Treasurer William Longridge,
Board Members Al King and
William Longridge; ‘also Int’l
Vice President Al Skinner and
Int’l Secretary-Treasurer Irv-
ing Dichter.

Attack OLRB

The attack on the OLRB came
in the officers’ report to the
convention. Charging bias by
the OLRB during Mine-Mill’s
fight against the raiders at In-

ternational Nickel, the officers.

To Tax commission

TORONTO, Ont.——Prepara-
tions are underway for a full
scale presentation before the
Federal Royal Commission on
Taxation, it was announced
here today by Secretary William
Longridge of the International
Union of Mine-Mill and Smelter
Workers.

The presentation will lay be-
fore the Commission the full,po—
sition of the Union as it has
been developed over the years
on this vital question, he said.
Included will be the Union’s po-
sition as related to income taxes
paid by the individual taxpayer
and the effects of taxation pol-
icy on the metal mining industry
and the development of the
Canadian economy.

Far North Exemptions
’ In addition the Union will pre-

sent its case for special tax ex- ‘

emptions for workers living in
the far northern reaches of the
country beyond the end of steel
and in areas where climatic
conditions bear strongly on the
cost of living.

The Union has been notified
that the hearings for its presen-
tation will be in August in the
city of Edmonton.

called for a Royal Commission
to investigate the Board. Ac-
cording to the report, “. . .
members of the OLRB have
stated that, despite all the cloud
under which the Inco vote and
Steel certification rests . the
Board will not order another
vote ‘because Mine-Mill would
win.’ ”

v “We say unequivocally,” the
report continued, “that bargain-
ing rights for Local 598 were
stolen and the OLRB was pre-
pared to violate every known
precedent and regulation in or-
der to grant certification to the
United Steelworkers of Ameri-

ca.”
Pare Blasts CCL

Pare slashed into the leader-
ship of the Canadian Congress
of Labour—AFL-CIO. “Unless
Jodoin and his friends in- the
Steel Union start to do the job
they were chosen to do instead
of doing a job for the employers
the workers will soon sweep
them out of office,” he declared.

“The differences and splits in
the Canadian trade union move-
ment arise from the leadership
and not from the rank and file
workers. The interests of all
Canadian workers are the same
whether inmy province of Que-
bec or elsewhere in the coun-
try.”

Turning to his own union,
Brother Pare reported notable
success recently with a large
number of. certifications won
and pending. Most important of
these, he said, was the recent
victory in the Northern Electric
plant at Bramalea, outside To-
ronto. Pare pointed out that this
was the first time that the com-
pany union in Northern Electric
plants had been defeated. UE
already represents the employes
of Canada's two other large
electricals, General Electric and
Westinghouse.

Ovation for Howard‘ V

Vice President Howard re-
ceiveda standing ovation at the
convention when he told the del-
egates that “If the present rate
of integration continues it will
take another 92 years to get the
job done, and we in the deep
South are a little too impatient
for that.” '

Delegates raised more than
$100 on the spot and pledged
to raise more in their locals for
Brother Howard’s District 5
Fighting Fund. ’

Vice President Harvey
Murphy of the Canadian
Section of Mine-Mill led a
three-man Mine-Mill dele-
gation to the Scottish area
conference of the National
Union of Mineworkers as
fraternal delegates.

The delegation was in re-
sponse to an invitation ex-
tended some weeks ago by
President Alex Moffat of the
Scottish area NUM. Besides
Murphy, the delegation included
"P. Etmanski, President of the
Bluebell Sub-Local 651 at Rion-
del, British Columbia, who is
being sent by the Cominco
Council; and Jim Tester, Chair-
man of the Falconbridge Plant
Committee, who is going on be-
half of Falconbridge workers of
Local 598, Sudbury, Ontario.

The conference of the N.U.M.,
which is affiliated with the In-
ternational Confederation of
Free Trade Unions, took place
in Dundee June 3-5.

As an autonomous Canadian
union, Mine-Mill has sought to
maintain fraternal relations
with miners’ unions throughout
the world and this action is in
furtherance of that policy, ac-
cording to Canadian Mine-Mill
President Ken Smith.

Mourn Joseph Mackey
SAVANNAH, Ga. — Jo s eph
Mackey, a longtime member of
Local 870, died May 25. He was
chairman of the board of trus-
tees of the local union for many
years and active in union af-
fairs until he retired in 1960.

Canadian UE Scores
Maior Election Victory ,  i

TORONTO, Ont.—Five hundred workers at North-
ern Electric Co., Bramalea, Ontario‘, have chosen United
Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers (UE) as their bar-
gaining agent. The vote, ordered. by the Ontario Labor

Relations Board, showed 319 voting for UE, 184 for‘

Northern Electric Employee Association and three spoiled

ballots. -

Ross Russell, director of organization, said that-the

vote had taken place on March
12. Counting of ballots, however,
was held up until May 3 when
the Communication Workers of
America (AFL-CIO-CLC), went
to the courts to try to challenge
the authority of the Ontario

Labor Relations Board to order S’

the vote and to certify the union
receiving the majority of votes
cast.

Appeal Dismissed

On April 16, Chief Justice
McRuer dismissed the CWA ap-
peal. The Chief Justice handed
down his decision “with rea-
sons” and in no uncertain terms
made it clear that CWA, which
had submitted no evidence of
membership in the Northern
Electric plant, had no case. The
Chief Justice charged all court
costs to the Communication
Workers Union.

Following the court decision,
Russell said, there was a 13-day
period during which the CWA
could have appealed the ruling
of the Chief Justice. When they
failed to appeal, the Ontario
Labor Relations Board ordered
that the ballots be counted on
May 3. .

SALMO, B. C.—Last ditch ef-

forts by the Union at the Reeves _

MacDonald Mine near here to
avert a strike proved unsuccess-.

ful in moving the Company from '

its hard rock position. These ef-
forts by. the Union included the
setting back of their strike dead-
line from May 1 to May 6.

On that morning -the strike
went into effect and has been
100% effective. Morale among
the strikers and in the commu-
nity is high. .-

On the morning of the strike
the men at Remac were joined
on the picket line by the officers‘
of nearby Local 480 in Trailin
a fine display of solidarity.‘

Issues ,
Issues in the strike revolve

around the adamant refusal of

the Company to implement the
findings of a majorityaward
by a conciliation Board. This
proposed settlement was for a

one-year agreement with ‘71/ac I

per hour wage increase plus a
21/.»c payment by the company
into a severance pay plan and

three weeks vacation after five L,"

years’ service. -

Also involved in the strike, al-

though not as a direct matter of
dispute is the fact that the same

cut. Anaconda American Brass Company, last of the defendants
to change its plea from innocent to no contest, was fined $35,000

AMERICAN SMELTING AND REFINING Company reshuffled
top brass recently. E. McL. Tittmann was named chairman, and
R. D. Bradford was named president, succeeding J. D. MacKenzie-
who had held down both jobs. Charles F. Barber, former general
counsel, was named executive vice-president. Douglas H. Soutar,
former director of industrial relations‘ was named vice-president
in charge of industrial relations. Soutar, well known to AS&R
Council members, for many years has been in charge of company
bargaining with Mine-Mill. The retirement of A. Royce Wolfe,
assistant treasurer, was also announced. Wolfe, long-time pension
and insurance expert for AS&R was also well known to-.AS&R

CADMIUM PRICE shot up last month from $1.85 per pound to
$2.35. A few years ago it was as low as $1.35. American Smelting

CANADIAN exports of ‘copper concentrates (copper content)
tripled between 1958 and 1962, from 30,315 tons to 95,544 tons. In
1958 only 2,208 tons were exported to Japan. Last year 46,167 tons
were shipped to Japan. This reflects the big expansion in copper
mine production in Western Canada, especially British Columbia.
Japan has taken most of this increased production by outbidding
the AS&R smelter at Tacoma. Canadian concentrate exports to all
U. S. points increased from 10,704 tons in 1958 to only 20,654 tons

in 1962.

MINE-MILL LOCAL 598, representing workers at Falconbridge
Nickel Co. near Sudbury, Canada, cites startling figures on in-
creased output per worker. A brief prepared by Local 598 says:
“In 1956 there were 2,210 men in the bargaining unit. By 1961 the
corresponding number was 2,208. In short the number of men was
unchanged. However, the output of nickel was up 51 percent, the
output of copper was up 47 percent, and the output of cobalt was
up 169 percent. This means that each man was producing 50 per-
cent more in 1961 than he was five years before.

Canadian Mine-Mill President K. A. Smith commented, “We
continue to talk about mechanization and automation, but it is
only when we see the figures of this kind that we realize what is
happening to jobs in our industry.”

U. S. LEAD PRICE rose from 101/2. cents to 10% cents June 5-
the third hike since last November. Price on the London Metal
Exchange has increased by more than 3/4 cent in recent weeks and
is the major cause of the latest U. S. price increases. Lead is in
plentiful supply, and the price increases in London are said by
some observers to be the result of market manipulation by large
foreign lead producing companies.

Unemployment

Secretary of Labor W. Willard
Wirtz was asked recently how
he felt about the annual spring
drop in the unemployment rate.
“My feeling is about what it
would be if somebody’s temp-
erature dropped back from 104
to 103 degrees.”

Chile

Bargaining continues right
down to the wire as the June 30
contract expiration date looms
at Kennecott’s Braden mine in
Chile. The Chilean C o p p e r
Worker’s Confederation was pre-
sented demands for wage hikes
of 50 percent to 60 percent for
different categories of workers,
plus increased fringe benefits
and a wage reopener clause in
the event of further price infla-
tion.

Two months ago, after taking
a strike vote, workers at Ana-
conda’s Chuquicamata c o p p e r
mine in Chile settled for a 30
percent wage increase. Last
month wildcat strikes briefly
shut down operations at Ana-
conda’s El Salvador mine, and
at the port of Antofagasta, ship-
ping point for Chuquicamata.
The mine walkout was in pro-
test over the death of two
miners resulting from a delayed
explosion of caps. ’

England

The British Labor Party has
announced a new social welfare
program to be put into effect
if it wins the next national elec-
tion. Under the plan, all re-
tired workers would receive
government pensions equivalent
to one-half regular pay, and
half-pay benefits would be given
to unemployed workers or those
off sick.

Half pay would be figured on
the individual worker’s earn-
ings. Other elements in the plan
are a guaranteed minimum
wage and higher pensions for
widows.

Portable Pensions‘

The Ontario, Canada leg-
islature has passed an. in-
dustrial pension bill which is a
milestone in Canadian labor
legislation. The bill requires all
firms with 15 or more em-
ployees to put into effect pen-
sion plans with benefit stand-
ards set by law, and makes all
pensions “portable”. The port-
ability feature arises out of the
vesting and “locking-in” of
pension credits.

When an employee quits, his
credits are fully vested, and
he cannot withdraw his contri-
butions. His credits may be
used to purchase a deferred
pension or transferred to his
new employer’s.pension plan, or
to a central pension agency set
up under the law.

Canadian labor has many
valid criticisms of the new
plan, among them that pensions

‘do notbegin. until age 70,’ and

have‘a ceiling of $80 permonth.

The $80 ceiling is wholly in-,
adequate, especially since Can- '_

ada has no social security're-
tirement system as in this
country. Observers say that
there will be increasing labor
pressure» over the years to im-
prove the benefits, and to ex-
tend the pension system on a
Canada-wide basis.

Inlerior Secrelary Udall Blames Speedup for Goal Mine
llisasler . . . Bureau of Mines lleporl Kearney Mine

‘Twenty-two lives Were- snuffed out at the Clinchfield Coal Company mine near
Sardis, West Virginia, on April 25 in the second major U. S. coal mine disaster in less
than five months. The earlier disaster at U. S. Steel’s captive coal mine near Car-
michaels, Pennsylvania, last December claimed 37 lives. Cause of both disasters was

methane gas explosion.

Shocked by the news, President John F‘. Kennedy ordered Secretary of the Interior

Stewart Udall to conduct an in-
tensive review of mine safety
practices in an attempt to pre-
vent such mishaps in the‘ fu-
ture.

“I , also request your views
promptly,” Kennedy said to
Udall, “on the need for further
or improved legislation . . . I
know you share my concern
over these disasters. It is im-
perative that we take every

_ necessary step to avoid’ such

accidents in the future.”

President Kennedy added
that he considered the “loss of
life unacceptable” in view of
the accident prevention meas-
ures available to industry and
the inspection and compliance
powers available to state and
federal agencies.

'"Safe'l'y Don"l' Maﬂer"

In commenting on the disas-
ter at Carmichaels, Pennsyl-
vania, United Mine Workers

President W. A. “Tony” Boyle '

said, “This disaster has con-
firmed the belief I have held for
some time that we may be
mechanizing the coal industry
past the point of safety. Con-

cern for production should not
. outweigh the industry’s.protec-
V_ tion of the precious human lives

in its custody.”

"At the hearing on the Clinch-'

field ‘coal company-mine disas-

‘_ ter, a rank and file coal miner‘

said, “Safety don’t matte r.
We're. in there for one thing-
tonnage.”

Secretary of the Interior‘ Stew-A

art Udall’s comments on the

Clinchfield disaster ' were no‘

less pungent: “. . ._.it is very

plain to me that an element’
a of carelessness has crept into‘
the safety program in somebf '
our minesand "that there have;'
_ ,  been sloppy practices that h;‘a?v_ei
j_f been tolerated on m"ana=g e-‘_.
. ment’s side, A perhaps ‘ careless-'
’ mass by individuals . . . i 

Speedup ,_1_
“.Representatives of the four
agencies that participated.“-4 in

 the hearing were in full agree-’

ment as to the causeiofthis

disaster. ‘That through‘ ‘care-ﬂ
lessness, negligence. and deliber-"

ate action to speed up trans-
portation operation the ventila-
tion system in the third panel
section was totally ineffective;
that the deficiencies in gas test-
ing procedures resulted in the
development of a dangerous
gas condition, and that the gas
was ignited by an electric are.

From statements made atthe

close of the hearings by repre-
sentatives of the four agencies
it is obvious thatithey were in
agreement that the conditions
which set the stage for this

‘disaster were the result of hu-

man failure to follow simple
and well-known safety stand-
ards, but that these failures in
turn stemmed from manage-
ment’s unrelenting push for
more and more production with

less and less attention to safety,
the real and basic cause.’ ”

tics compiled by the U. S.

7 Bureau of~Mines add a somber

note to Boyle’s and Udall’s
comments on mechanization
and speedup in the mines. Pre-
liminary figures already in in-
dicate that the accident record
of the U. S. coal mining indus-
try in 1962 was the worst in

many years. Partial figures on
fatal «accidents already. avail-
able indicate 1962 had the high-
est number of deaths per man-
hours worked since 1943, and
more non-fatal, disabling work
injuries per man-hours than in
any year since 1953.

The record for 1963 promises
to be even worse. 109 U. S. coal
miners were killed in the first
four months of this year, com-
pared with 88 for the first four
months of 1962.

Peru'_s Kearney Mine

HE KEARNEY mine operated by American-Peru Mining Com-
pany, Hanover, New Mexico, was resurveyed by the U. S.
Bureau of Mines late last November. The report listed 12 safety
recommendations made in the report on the original survey which

the company had not put into effect. These were: ‘

O A suitable walkway should be provided over the conveyor
belt on top of the ore bins. ,

O The area around the fuel-storage tank for the diesel-powered
air compressor should be ditchedor banked, in order to prevent
oil from flowing to buildings and equipment in case the tank should
become ruptured. '

O Guards should be replaced on equipment as soon as repairs
or belt changes are made. i"

O Explosive magazines should be provided with suitable warn-
ing signs so located that.a bullet, passing through any of the signs
will not strike any of the magazines. .

College Costs '

The biggest stumbling block.

to higher education for the av-

erage person’s child is high

costs. The average cost of a
college education at a private’

out-of-town college is $2,200 an-'4 -

nually. At a state land grant

college, the cost is less but still .

comes to $1,800. - ' . V
