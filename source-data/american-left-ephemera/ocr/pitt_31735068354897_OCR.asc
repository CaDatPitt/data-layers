that dominate the industry last year
made 209 per cent more profits than
they”did in 1945+_a gain nearly double
that of -all U. S.‘ corporations.

Much of these profits come from the
vastly increased output per manhour
that has been brought about both by
increased mechanization and more in-
tensive speed-up of workers.

We know that a frantic effort will
be made to apply the freeze formulas
of the Wage Stabilization Board to our
industry. The declared purpose of the
Board, as expressed in the statement
of policy issued in. December 1950, is
“to, minimize to_, the greatest, practical
degree the volume of money and credit
available for spending . , U .” Their.
avowed aim is to “keep wages down.

date control over the UAW-CIO moved
forward after the two hearings in De-

By ‘action of his board he seized con-
trol of the 60,0’00-member Ford Local
600, keystone of the remaining opposi-
tion to his rule. Elected officers were
made powerless by a 6-man administra-
tive board installed by the internation-.
al in the Dearborn headquarters of the
local. Officers of -subordinate units were

removed and local staff-members, to- 3

taling so far 11 ‘employes, were dis-‘
placed. 2 i . ~

red hearings . or associated -with those“ ‘

named. _ e .

F YOU read the publicity issued by the big
non-ferrous metal companies, if you read the
trade papers and speeches by the big brass in
these companies, you get a picture of their
activities in foreign lands somewhat along the
following lines: 

What the companies say
The company, they say, is bringing the ben-

efits of civilization to backward areas of the

world and is improving the living standards of
the people. At the same time they are building

up this country’s supplies of scarce and critical.

metals. ,

In doing this‘, they say they are in the front
line in.'building‘the defenses of the free nations
fighting for a-free World against the imminent
threat of aggression from Russia and her satel-
lites. ‘ I ’

All in all, we get—from the companies-a
picture of men performing an unselfish job of
humanitarianism and patriotism._-

Is this a true picture?" i t ,

If you could ask this question of a Negr
miner at Nababeep or East O’okiep in New-

V, mont’s big copper mines in the Union of South

Africa,4he' would probably stop you before you
were finished and say: -

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.
I live in a compound, and I am paid 50 cents
a day for back—breaking work in this terrific
heat. If this is freedom I want none of it. If
these are the benefits of civilization, I want
none of it.” I

If we went ddwn to Tsumeb in Southwest
Africa, a miner there would probably say
“amen” and add:

What theiAfrican mner would say

“I am not part of a free nation and I don’t
know what you’re talking about when you say
that the company is helping the free nations
to fight for a free world. V

“My nation, the Hereros, was slaughtered
by the German army at the turn of the century

and we were enslaved in this mine by a Ger-_

man company. .

“Our country is not free today. We are
under the domination of the Malan govern-
ment of the Union of South Africa—which
operates hand in glove with Newmont to en-
slave us in -this mine. ‘

government imported Jim Crow from the

“As for patriotism I_don’t know what

you’re talking about. The copper we produce’

here with our sweat and tail is mostlysoldin

.Eurbpe at black market prices which are far

higher than the prices in. the U. S. It has
nothing to do with the defense of anything-

’ except Newmont’s profits.” ’ . '

,— The Negro brother is right. Copper _V prices
in ,the fall of last year were about 581/2 cents a
pound in Italy, and 37 cents a pound in France,
compared to 24 cents a pound in the United
States,’ according to the U. N..Bulletin of Sta-
tistics, January, 1952. European prices have
dropped considerably, however, in recent
months. . ‘

A Tsumeb miner would probably wind up by
adding: ‘ U « -

“As for aggression from Russia, I don’t ,

know what you’re talking about. The only
aggression I know of is the aggression of the
Newmont Mining Company and the Malan
government.”

A Moroccan miner wouldsay

“N ewmont also sells the lead and zinc from
Zellidja in Europe at blackmarket prices.
There’s no patriotism in that. That’s just
plain profiteering. V

“As for ‘defense of the free world’—take
a look atthe tremendous military air bases the
United States is building in our country at
N ouasseur, Sidi Slimane and M echra bel Ksiri.
These are" not for defense. They are strictly
for offense. 7 _ I

“And we. are afraid that they may be also

used “against us if, for instance, we organize .

and strike for more than the measly 15 cents

an hour Newmont now pays us.” - V
Our Zellidja miner is unquestionably right

about this. These are advertised as some of the

the Chilean workers shown here is no different from the product -‘made by workers of any electrolytic foundry in the
United States. But the wages are lower, hours are longer, conditions are worse. And for the U. S. corporations which
control the foundry in Chile, the profits are much, much higher. ‘

‘ If we askeda miner at_,_Anaconda’s tremen- .-

necott’s tremendous E1 Teniente mine operated

two-thirds in some years, while‘ the share kept
by the Chilean government has varied up to as
muchsais 40 per cent in some years. ' Since 1942
the spread has been roughly fifty-fifty.

Another U.’N. report shows a 10 per cent‘

drop in thereal wages of Chilean miners from

‘ 1945 to 1949. Since the Korean war bégan the

standard of living of the miners in Chile has
undoubtedly declined again very sharply. Since;
the Korean war began, prices in Chilehave in-»
creased about two and one-half times the rise
in the United States. ’ ‘

The jump has been 31 per cent in Chile,
accordingito the U. N. Monthly Bulletin of Sta-
tistics, (December, 1951), compared. to 13 per
cent in the -United States, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since~1937‘ Chilean

We could not print what a Peruvian miner

per for the war program, for example. May-
be it is strategic. The companies certainly
used it for their strategic ‘purpose of trying to

-break_. our last strike. The government cooper-
ated by withdrawing 25,000 tons of copper

from the stockpile. .

“And I suppose this stockpiling should be I‘
-profitable because the companies. are able to '

sell all they -can produce.” V - = — V
_ Here, too, our average rank—and-filershows
heis not given to exaggeration. Actually, the
government ‘stockpiling program “is — a gravy
train for the copper companies.
ladledout in several ways: 1
Government moneyeis ‘loaned to some com-

panies on at-tractivfe terms." Money spent on new
mines, and ,machinery {can be: written‘ ‘off faster‘
for tax purposes-—-ﬁveiyyears instead‘ of the more
'usualC20 to'25 ‘years. Thegovernmentltenters S
into long-term contracts-to buy the ‘output at a
“certain minimum “price. AS&R_; for ‘instance, is

T‘ ’ guaranteed 24'/2 léentsia pound for 88,000 tons-

to be produced at the Silver Bell mine at Pima,.
Arizona. If- the marketprice goes’ up the com-
panygetsthe higher price. .If the price goes
down the government bearsthe loss. If this is
not enough, the Defense Materials Procurement

‘ agency will pay premiums over and above this a

guaranteed minimum to keep high cost mines
in production. 1 V V
Add these all up andvyou can see what is
behind their ardent patriotism to build this
government stockpile. They just lovethat stock-
pile. As Roscoe Fleming, Denve1IPost colum-
nist, reports’ June 15, 1951, 366 million dollars

in government grants is going to copper com- I

panies. Fleming said: ..
“Only the ‘giants in each field are being so
encouraged. ,,E:ram‘ples: Anaconda Copper, $66‘

and struggles. . ' -

We can illustrate how they fight and what  i -V

. of Mine Workers’ Unions of Bolivia o‘n_.June._2Z}_t._,f  :3_'_
1951.‘ This report lies b'uried _in;Uj._N. files. .B_ut T,  

from_ it we get astirring story of the Bolivian 

I _ tin miners fighting to get more than 80 bolivi.-I

anos a day. Since a boliviano is a little less than

a U. S. cent at the current raterof exch‘ange_', _ 
you can.see they have something to ’fight.about,’ 5  ~
These are the “miners who chew coca leaf t‘_‘ ‘
lessen their hunger and fatigue. The F_e_dera.te_
Press on Februaryfzl, 1952, carried the story '

l as follows: ' '

In ‘December,‘1946,'according' to the report _

I to the U.: N., “miners’ leaders from Potosi and .

industrial . workers from La Paz were arrested

~and' imprisoned in the ‘concentration camp on  V "T

Coati in Lake Titicac_a.”' ‘ -

In January, 1947, the report continued,  ‘ V ’ 
V peaceful demonstration of miners -calling for the

liberation of their leaders was brokenup by,

machinegun and mortarfire, causing over 1300

casualties among men,- women and children.”,_
In July, 1947, the government tookanother.

V step against the union. It confiscated union" . "

funds which were on deposit in the (banks. The‘ _
main banks of.Bolivia, of course, are controlled _ 

_ by the same Patino interests which control Bo- ’
  livian tin.   c »  

é _ In September,'—1947,i there was a mass dis-_
missal of 10,000 workers from the Patino ‘mines '
in the Catavi district of Bolivia. "The union"

charged that this move had two purposes: (1)) _

to blacklist union leadersand (2) to permit re-
hiring of other workers under worsened condi-
tions. . . . V
Machine guns were used again on May 1,_
1948, when a May Day demonstration was held. ’
The next day factory workers who went to the

. hospital to look for dead and wounded relatives

were also shot down. According t_o the n1iners'
union, 93 workers were killed in the course or i-
the two days. V I , Z ' I  0' 4
‘In August, 1948, the companies stationed,
armed guards at the mines. And in October,
1948, a new group of union leaders was jailed.
Juan Lechin headed the miners’ union /in‘
1949. He also rerepresented Potosi in the na-_
tional senate. On May 127, 1949, the authorities, .
arrested Lechin and exiled him to ‘Chile. At the A a

Still another outbreak of violence was re-

ng inquiry

  demanded by unionsts

OTTAWA, Canada—-A joint delegation representing 60,000 Cana-

dian members of Mine-Mill and UE

recently spent a day and a half

on Parliament Hill pressing theiriémand for a full-scale public inquiry
of the Dominion “cost-of-living” index.

The 14-member delegation, which called on government officials

to . and Members of Parliament, was following up ona request made earlier

 - - by the two unions for such a study. The index is used widely by em-

ployers and government agencies in wage negotiations and conciliation. V

c Mine-Mill and UE last year jointly authoreclan’ exhaustive study
‘of the cost-of-living index in terms -of its impact on the leco'nom’y,; the ‘

base on which it is erected, as well as
the -manner. and method by which the
index reflects the impact of prices on
Workers’ ‘living, standards. '
Every M.P. was presented acopy of
Aashis book in December,‘ 1951,.together
‘with the request that a public inquiry,
along the sameglines as that held by
the War Labor Board in 1943, be in-
stituted on the index and itsproposed
revision. . p
The Mine-Mill delegation, headed by
District 8 board member Nels Thibault,
included Walter Caesar and David
Shaw of Sudbury Local 598; R<fand
Methot of Port Colburne Local 637;
president Coston Paranuik of Marmora
Local«889 and William Cross of Local
889. ‘ ‘ ~
MINE-MILL LOCALS which were
unable to send delegates supported the
lobby through letters and wires to their
constituency members of the House,
calling on them to meet the joint dele- "

, ' gation and to support the demand for

an inquiry.

The" delegation held a lengthy ses-
sion with Labour Minister Milton
eGregg,,an'd held separate meetings with
the full caucus of the CCF,- the.Social
U Conservative
party. All -parties expressed concern
about the index ‘and promisedto study
the derhand for a public inquiry. ‘

L Steel raiders try
rthird time at Trail v

TRA~IL, B. C.—The latest CIO Steel-
workers raid on Mine-Mill in this area
—-—the third in three years——‘is rapidly
moving toward a climax.

The new trick used by the raiders is
to attempt to split the solidly united
bargaining front of Local 480 here and
Local 651 at Kimberley by applying
for Labour Board. certification here
only. And as usual, the Steel piecards
chose a moment. on the eve of annual
bargaining to try their maneuver. ‘

With negotiations set to begin this
week, Mine-Mill’,s-three CM&S locals——
480 in Trail, 651 in Kimberley and 690

in Calgary—have elected members of’

the joint bargaining committee. CM&S
workers. remembered that their joint
bargaining drive last year paid off with
great results. 9

“It costs nothing for Steel" to file an
application,” a leaflet issued by Local
480 pointed out. “We always said they
would pick bargaining time for such a
stunt._ Why?. Because this is the time
when we are coming“'to grips with the

company for higher wages. ’Steel’s job
