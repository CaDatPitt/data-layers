of policy on the part of those trusted With po-
sition is promptly rejected. There have been
few of the more active and articulate Social-
ists, “leaders” if you will, who have not fos-
tered this attitude. Eugene V. Debs, for in-
stance, who appealed to the imagination of the
American Workers as no other Socialist has,
was fond of repudiating the accepted idea of
leadership. He said, “I am not a labor leader;
I do not want you to follow me or anyone else.
If you are looking for a Moses to lead you
out of the capitalist wilderness. you will stay
right where you are. I would not lead you into
this promised land if I could, because if I could
lead you in, someone else would lead you out.
You must use your heads as Well as your hands,
and get yourselves out of your present condi-
tion; as it is now the capitalists use your heads
and your hands.”

In order that no local presiding officer build
up a “machine” there is a new chairman elect-
ed at each meeting of the branch or local. On
national matters, steps taken by the National
Executive Committee are subject to referen-
dum vote of the membership upon the demand
of a small number of members, as are de-
cisions of the national convention of the party,
held in presidential years. Delegates to con-
ventions are elected by referendum vote.

Sympathetic unions vote funds to help in

Socialist party and some of its allied organiza-
tions have often been more prompt and gen-
erous with strike relief than other unions have.
The Socialists, through helping the unions go
as far as they now Wish to go, are able to get
a more sympathetic hearing for a plea to go
further. They build up respect for themselves

and distributed for the use of the people in-
stead of the profit of an owning class.

_In addition to these basic organizations of
Workers, at various times Socialists, trade
unionists, cooperators, and numerous other
groups of Workers set up organizations to work
for particular measures. At the present time,
for instance, Socialists have set up “Emer-
gency Conferences on Unemployment.” They
aim to get as much publicity as possible for
existing conditions that are too often hidden
by newspapers at the request of the chambers
of commerce, and to present a definite pro-
gram of action to governmental bodies. ‘

Many of them at the present time are work-
ing up popular demand for Unemployment In-
surance. They back a bill drafted by the Na-
tional Executive committee as a model for the
different states. In this Way, the Socialists
exercise influence on the old parties between
elections, at the same time assuming the lead-,
ership of the Working class in getting those
things which it needs immediately. Years be-
fore old age pensions became popular, the So-
cialists Were doing the same thing for that
measure. Now, sixteen states have old age
pension measures.

A special organization for the training of
youth in the ideas and ideals of Socialism is
the Young People’s Socialist League. It has
an organization which parallels that of the
party.

In its educational and propaganda work, So- '

cialist newspapers play a highly important
role. , At the present time there are approxi-

these sources of communication with members,

are about two hundred labor. liberal. and radi-
cal papers that receive and use the weekly
press service from National Headquarters.
Mutual insurance societies, fraternal organi-
zations definitely pro-labor in their outlook,
labor sports groups, singing societies, cultural
and educational organizations committed to a

sources of support, moral and financial. Some
other organizations, such as the League for

CHAPTER IV.
BEGINNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISM

Socialists say that the workers of one country
have more in common with the workers of
another country than they have with the cap-
italist owners of their own country. Workers
quickly discovered that the world was rapidly
decreasing in size, and that the competition of
different national capitalisms was undermin-
ing labor’s status.

Under competitive conditions, for example,
German workers saw German owners of coal
mines reap a harvest when ' their English
brothers were out on strike. After the English
strike was beaten, wages reduced, and hours

14 ORGANIZING ‘ THE WORLD

lengthened, German miners found themselves

faced by demands that they accept wage cuts.

An international miners’ organization was one
of the first strong ones. Outside of the desire
to protect their own standard of living, there
was a desire for mutual aid in these conflicts

that only the most cold-blooded worker could’

resist.

From the first, the question of the preven-
tion of war and the maintenance of peace was
a link binding the Workers. It is the workers

‘that fight the battles. The employers are either

high officers or “dollar-a-year men” at home.
In either case, profits go to one class; casualties
to the other. From the first, this intelligent
View of the debits and credits of war has been
most bitterly fought by the capitalists. Nation-
alistic feelings aroused by their propaganda
are the hardest proble_ms to solve in building an

international organization that will stick to its
— common interests in spite of War. ’

Lastly, a very important stimulus for inter-

national organization has been the Socialist"

ideals of the final emancipation of labor from
its bondage to capitalism, and the building of
a \Vorld State. L

While the factors mentioned had a tendency
to bring Workers’ organizations of various
countries together, there were numerous .in-

fluences that pulled in the opposite ‘direction.

laid by the Carbonari, or charcoal burners,‘

and Spain. French and Belgian revolutionaries,

 

16 ORGANIZING THE WORLD

fighting to establish Republics, received moral A

and financial support from English radicals.

During the 1830’s, Utopian communistic ex-
periments were being carried out in England,
France, and the United States, and a great deal
of correspondence took place between Robert
Owen, Fourier. Saint-Simon, and their disciples.
Channing, Dana, Brisbane. Emerson, Thoreau,
and Hawthorne, among others in this country,
were associated with these communistic ex-
periments.

These movements were held together by
common ideals, but the coming international
working class movement was tolhave something
else — a. sense of the necessity for cooperation
if it was to survive in the daily struggle with
the capitalist class. .

The International Exhibition, held in London
in 1862 offered the right contacts for the'forma-
tion of an international labor association. Over
300 workmen from France. a dozen from Ger-
many. and a sr:att.erin_g of others came to Lon-
don for the event. They talked matters over
with the London Working l\-’len’s Association.
Correspondence continued for almost two years.
During this time. the need for common action
became even greater. English and French
committees met to try to help the textile work-
ers in both countries who were out of work be-
cause of the American civil war.

These joint meetincs led to an address “to
the working men of France from the working
men of'England,” widely circulated in France.

"We find.” it said. “that Whenever we attempt to

better our social condition by reducing the hours of _ V F

toil, or by raising the price of labor, our employers
threaten us with bringing over Frenchmen. Ger-
mans, Belgians, and others to- do our work at a re-
duced rate of wages, and we are sorry to say that
this has been done not from any desire on the part
of our Continental brethren to injure us. but
through a want of regular and systematic com-
munication hetween the industrial classes of all
countries. Our aim is to bring up the wages of
the ill-paid to as near a level as possible with that
of those who are better remunerated. and not to
allow our employers to play us all one against the
other. and to drag us down to the lowest possible
condition, suitable to their avaricious bargaining.”

The reply of the French workers, almost a.
year later. was sent by a delegation of three

sociation with a central committee in London
and branches in all the capitals of Europe.
The plan was adopted. and a provisional com-
mittee was elected to prepare a program and
constitution.

The committee adopted the name, “Inter-
national Working l\’len’s Association.” and Karl
Marx. father of scientific Socialism, prepared
the constitution and rules. Marx also wrote

oly and privilege could not be curbed unless

the machinery provided by the state was used

in the interest of the working class. There-
fore, he said, the conquest of political power
was the “first duty of the working class.”

In the “First International” there was a con-
stant struggle between schools of thought. The
French at first strove to commit the Inter.-
national to “mutualistic.” methods; that is,‘a
solution of the labor problem through co-
operative societies for almost every social
function. They were opposed to strikes. The
Germans, largely under the leadership of'Marx,
finally won‘ over the French delegation, but a
new source of concern to the “collectivists”
arose.

A struggle between the doctrines that later
came to be distinguished as “Socialism” and
“Anarchism”—between Karl Marx and Michael
Bakunin——was a constant source of trouble.
Not until 1872, when an international congress
committed the International strictly to political
action, as distinguished from “direct action,”
was the conflict settled. The anarchists with-

‘ drew, but made so much trouble for the officers
of the International that its headquarters were .

moved to New York City.
This struggle was only a, minor reason for
the decline of the First International. War, the

giant against which all attempts at internation~

al labor organization have thus far struggled,
was successful in causing the first mortal
wound to the International Working Men's As-

 

 

’ sociation.

The Franco-German War in .1870

German workers.

of the International were most active. The
General Council asked Marx to Write an “Ad-
dress” on the Commune. He hailed it as the
first revolution in which the workers had
proved themselves “capable of social initiative.”

Upon the publication of Marx’ work as an
official document of the International, all but
one of the leaders of the British trade unions
on the General Council resigned. The suppres-
sion of the Commune destroyed the groups in
France. Several governments used the fact of
affiliation with the International to suppress
the sections in their countries. The severe in-
dustrial depression of 1873-79 undermined al-
most all the existing trade unions and com-
pleted the.destruction of the First Internation-
al.

Although the accomplishments of the First
International fell far short of the hopes of its
leaders, it'Inarl«:ed a turning point in World
history to which succeeding international or-
ganizations have looked for inspiration. It Was
the pioneer in a field that had been entirely
uncharted. From it have grown the present
day international organizations.

‘20 ORGANIZING THE WORLD

"to 1889, Socialist parties developed in all of the
‘principal industrial countries.

In 1889, two at-
tempts were made to form a new international
The German Socialists issued a
call to all Socialist and labor organizations, to
meet in Paris in July, 1889. The British Trade
Union Congress convened a Conference at the
same time in the same city, but efforts to bring
the two conferences together failed. The Ger-
mans were joined in their attempt by the fol-
lowers of Jules Cuesde, a French leader who

had taken pzrt in the Paris Commune, had’

made great inroads into the new trade union
movement of France, and had organized a
strong Socialist party in 1880. Williani Morris,
Tom Mann, H. M. Hyndman and John Burns
had formed the Social-Democratic Federation
in England and the Fabian Society was or-
ganized in 1883 by Bernard Shaw Sydney
Webb, H. G. Wells and others. '

In 1889, British Socialist leaders successfully
conducted the first widespread strike of un-
skilled labor in the history of capitalism and
the “new unionism” which resulted, was a turn-
ing point to a Socialistic industrial unionism on
the part of British workers. All of these groups
followed the Germans, and the Conference

which they called eventuated in the “Second

International.”

Of particular interest for Americans is the
historical fact that this Congress originated In-
ternational Labor Day which is celebrated on
May the 1st, by all of the internationally
minded Working-class bodies in the world. The

American Federation of Labor, which was car- . I

 

FOR socIALIsM 21

rying on a militant fight for an eight-hour day
in the United States, sent greetings to both
Congresses and called attention to its cam-
paign for an eight-l1our day. An international
celebration was voted by the Congress on May
1st to inaugurate eight-hour day campaigns in
all countries. But it was not until 1900, in
Paris, that a permanent organization Was
set up.

In 1904, at the meeting at Amsterdam, the
International definitely asserted its leadership
of the workers of the world. Four hundred and
forty-four delegates were present, representing

- the first really successful international attempt

to bring the Workers of the chief industrial
countries together.

Almost unanimous agreement was reached
upon the statement that “War” is caused by
the Workings of the capitalist system and is
always injurious to the workers; the abolition
of War is not to be hoped for short of the
abolition of capitalism and the establishment
of the cooperative commonwealth but it is
possible to minimize the ‘danger of War by sub-
stituting national militias for standing armies,
by the limitation of armament, by the propaga-
tion of treaties, by the arbitration of interna-
tional disputes and by making the declaration
of War subject to the referendum of the peo—
ple.” All of the parties in the international
agreed that it was the duty of the Socialists in
all countries to promote these measures, to
protest against specific acts of aggression.-to

refuse to vote credits for war services or for

for the triumph of Socialism.

However, the Stuttgart Congress of 1907 took 

the position that, “Nations, like individuals,
have the right oflegitimate defense against an
attack or an aggression 'which menaces their
independence.” The Weaknesses of this posi-
tion lay in the fact that all Wars are “defen-
sive,” according to the capitalist press which
still reaches the vast" majority of the Working
people. This fact was evident in 1914.

In spite of heroic measures on the part of up

the majority of Socialists in all countries, and

' CHAPTER vi.
TIIE WAR YEARS:-—AND 

In spite of the collapse of the Second Inter-
national, various attempts were made by work-
ers in the allied and central powers to keep
in touch with each other all through the war
years.

Among the more important attempts at again
forming international contacts Were those of
the Italian, Swiss and American Socialistsin

.the early months of the war.

Two conferences Were held but neither had
the desired effect. By the spring of 1915, anti-
war sentimen-t had been whipped up by the

minority Socialist groups in most of the coun-. .
‘ tries, so that when another call was issued by

the Italian and the -Swiss Socialists, forty-two
delegates responded. The conference was held
in the small town of Zimmerwald, Switzerland,
during the Week of September 5th, 1915. Dale-
gates representing eleven countries on both
sides of the War unanimously signed a mani-
festo calling for an end to hostilities as soon as
possible, rebuking the Socialists of all countries
for straying from their promises and prin-

.ciples and demanding “no annexations, no in-

demnities.” They established an International
Socialist Commission and hoped through it to
get all of the Socialists of the various coun-
tries to unite‘ on an anti—War program.

 

. varied success.

' 24 ORGANIZING THE WORLD

When the Zimmerwaldians Went back to
their’ own countries their program met With
The German anti-war Social-
ists finally came out in the open and began
voting against the war budget, starting a split
between the majority and the minority which
eventuatcd in the forming of the Independent
Socialist Party.

In France, Jean Longuet gained the support
of several large departmental federations for
an international Socialist conference to discuss
peace. In Italy the official Socialist position
agreed with the Zimmerwald platform. In Eng-
land, the Independent Labor P‘arty approved it.

Even in those countries which had no direct
contact with the Zimmerwald group, anti-War
feeling began to flame as the burden of the
war settled more and more heavily upon the
masses. By the fall of 1916 vigorous anti-War
‘movements were gaining headway in all of the
allied and central countries. In October of that
year Friedrich Adler, a young Socialist of
Vienna, now secretary of the Labor and Social-
ist International, shot the Austrian Premier,
Count Sturgh, in an attempt to arouse his
countrymen to struggle for peace and consti-
tutional liberty.

The spring of 1917 brought the first Russian
revolution. America’s entry into the War
on April 7th, 1917, increased the strength with
which the American Socialist Party fought the
War.

The idea of a peace conference Was so wide-
spread that four simultaneous -attempts were A

made to bring one into being by the Interna-

-tional Socialist Bureau, by a Dutch-Scandina-

vian committee headed by Branting, leader of

‘the Swedish Socialists, by the American So-

cialists, and by the Petrograd Council of Work-
ers and Soldiers Deputies. Out of negotiations
between these groups came the call for the
famous Stockholm conference, on August 15th,
1917.

“On to Stockholm” was the slogan of all the "
_ anti-War Socialists. The German Socialists.

upon being denied passports for Stockholm,
refused to vote war credits whereupon both
majority and minority Socialists were per-
mitted to attend. The French Socialist Party's
special convention unanimously decided to send

delegates. The Italians, of course, went _in.

The British Labor party’s special conference
approved the recommendation of Arthur Hen-
derson, who was a minister in the War Cabinet,
by 1,840,000 to 550,000 votes. In addition to
these the Russians and the Americans accepted
the invitation

Woodrow Wilson caused the failure of the
Stockholm conference and blocked a negotiated
peace. He refused to grant passports to the
American Socialist“delegatcs, and suggested
that the governments of the allied countries do
the same. His suggestion was followed. The
conference was never held because only dele-
gates from the parties in Russia, the neutral
countries and the central powers arrived. The
collapse of the Stockholm movement was a
bitter disappointment to the anti-war Socialists,

and was an important factor in shifting senti- I

28 ORGANIZING THE WORLD

The lack of realism on the part of the
Communist International, and the lack of mil-
itan'cy='of the remnants of the Second Interna-
tional had led to the formation of a loose body
known as the International Working Union of
Socialist Parties, or more simply, the Vienna
Union. It took an intermediate position and
soon was dubbed by its opponents as -the Second-
and-a-Half International. The American party
participated. The chief figures were the Aus-
trians, the French, the Swiss, and the British

I. L. P. Its main object was the unity of the '

“future international.” Its policy, it said, would
“not restrict the proletariat to using democratic
methods only, as is done by the Second Inter-
national, nor prescribe the mechanical imita-
tion of the methods of the Russian revolution,
as the Communist International tries to do.”'
Negotiations were carried on between the
three groups during 1922 eventuating in united

action to try to force a radical program through '

the Genoa conference called by the League of
Nations. After the failure of the conference,
further attempts at unity fell through.

A Socialist “Unity congress” *:.';:s held i-n
‘Hamburg in May, 1923, at which over 400 dele-
gates, representing 43 parties in 30 countries
merged the Second International and the
Vienna Union. The new organization, called
the Labor and Socialist International, had a

membership at the time of 6,700,000. The I. F; _

'I‘.vU., agreed to cooperate with the L. S._ I.

From the Hamburg congress to the present,

boththe Socialist and the“union internationals
have grown in numbers and influence-.

The L. S. I. now has approximately 18,000,000
members in 36 countries. The Third Inter-
national has 4,000,000, of which 3,500,000 are
in the Russian party. The “Red International
of Labor Unions” has only 700,000 members
outside of Russia compared to 15,000,000
members of the I. F. T. U.

Connected with the L. S. I. are the Socialist
Youth International, the Workers’ Sport In-
ternational, the International Socialist Student
Federation, the Socialist Health International,
the Socialist Education International, a Work-
ers’. Radio International, and several smaller
specialized groups.

CHAPTER VII.
AMERICA——KEY TO WORLD SOCIALISM
Economic necessity is forcing upon the

statesmen of Europe a realization that it is no
longer theories of sovereignty or national dig-

.nity that need to .be consulted as guides to

action. The nations must “cooperate or go
down to disaster.” In less than one hundred

. years,’ the rush of trade and finance, spurred
. on by the machine, has trampled down old

boundaries. Unfortunately, 18th century ideas

1’ of nationalism, fanned by rival imperialistic
-.capitalisms, keep the masses from realizing

their identity of interest. The vast education-

most important, the education and organization

ORGANIZINGVTHE WORLD FOR
SOCIALISM

_ CHA?TER I.
BASIC NEED FOR INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION

Socialists are often accused of being “im-

practical” because of their insistence upon the

necessity of a separate political organization.

‘Every active Socialist has to contend with

arguments about the advisability of Working
through the old parties in order to get elected
quickly. This is a short-sighted policy. There
are both ideal and practical reasons for striv-
ing to build up an independent Socialist or-
ganization.

Through several years of activity in the
municipal government field, the writer came
to know many young men Who were interested
in doing Vvork having social value. One of
these was exceptionally brilliant, and chose to

‘call himself a Socialist even though he would

not join the party. He joined the Republican
group. Soon he won the primary nomination
for city councilman, and was elected.

Just after his election, he Was jubilant about
his method of working through the dominant
capitalist party, rather than through the So-
cialist party, and promised that the working

class of tl1e,city would find in him a.valia_nt _

champion. His first important' fight seemed

working class district came with a petition
that the street car company be made to clean
the cars that ran in their neighborhood. They
were a constant source of disease. It was part
of the franchise that all be cleaned regularly.
The new councilman demanded that the com-
pany fulfill its contract. He Was called to the
office of the Republican boss and told that he
must Withdraw the resolution. Indignantly he
demanded to know Why he was not to be al-
lowed to represent his constituents. The an-
swer of the boss is the real key to the need
for independent working class political action.

“You must withdraw because the president of
the street car company gave $10,000 to the
Republican campaign fund.”

This illustration of the old adage that “He
Who pays the piper, calls the tune,” is not
unusual. The Republican and Democratic
parties get their campaign funds through
enormous gifts from persons who have special
interests to protect through politics. 7

The power trust, which contributed a large
portion of the nine million dollars spent to
elect Hoover in 1928, has ample reason to be
proud of its choice (although it would have
found Al Smith just as satisfactory). Hoover
has revealed himself as an accomplice before
the fact in the alienation of the Flathead
power site in Montana, and in his veto of the
Muscle Shoals bill.

One who has hundreds of such instances in

'mind will understand Why Socialists say that

an old party politician is one “who takes the
money of the rich to protect them-against the

poor, and takes the votes of the poor to protect
them against the rich."

If the Socialist party does not receive large
contributions, how does it finance itself? It
has four sources of income. First, every per-
son who joins the party is given a card, as_ an
identification. He is required to pay dues to
his neighborhood organization, and is given a
stamp to be pasted in his card each time he
pays. This gives a regular income to the party,
and it is a simple way of enabling the member
to show that he is in good standing. '

The dues svstem brings in regular revenue
to the national headquarters, which prints the
stamps and sells them to the state organiza-
tions. The state organizations sell them to
local organizations and keep a small margin
for expenses. The larger local organizations
are divided into branches, either along territo-
rial lines, occupational lines, or language
groups. »

The income from this source is necessarily
small, because 87.9% of the members of the
Socialist party are workers, skilled or un-
skilled. However, the organization is kept at
Work all year ’round by the regular branch
meetings, and the steady income enables educa-
tional Work to be carried on.

Some ‘members can afford to pay a little
more than others, and these contribute to the
“organization funds” of national and local
headquarters. Organizers are sent into unor-
ganized fields with the hope that they will

soon have new territory self-sustaining, and ,
, can move on to other. f‘backward” areas. .

No person ever has any more» to say about
the conduct of the party because of a large
contribution than do others who cannot afford
to pay more than their dues. Persons unable
to pay even their dues are still entitled to vote
and participate in party activities, and are

given “exempt stamps.”

During election campaigns, a special effort
is made to get collections at meetings to help in
the election costs, and a special fund is opened
to which many contribute who do not belong
to the party. Labor unions, working class
fraternal societies, Worker’s singing, sport and

‘cultural organizations, and cooperative organ-

izations contribute to the campaign bec"use
they realize the importance of having Working
class representatives in positions of power.
The fourth Way of raising money is also a
means of keeping up spirit in the organization,
besides reaching the public with educational
material. Every local organization worth ‘any-
thing has public lectures at which admission is
charged to pay hall rent, the expenses of the
speaker and to aid the treasury. Some main-

tain forums Which meet regularly throughout A

the Winter months, and several li'.1.'.*e forums
in public parks or open spaces all summer.

V ‘In addition, almost every local organization‘
-carries on “scan-box” meetings on the more

prominent street corners in the WOl”l(lTl2‘ class

sold. "This not’o1'1ly' keeps members and ‘syﬁipa:

thizers up-to-date in the development of 'Social~

ism in this country and abroad, but it'_ yields a.

small profit for ‘the local treasury.

Even with the multitude of affairs men-
tioned, the financial resources at the command
of the Socialist.s are far less than those that
can be tapped by the old parties. However,

money goes a great deal further. There are.

no elaborate offices, no high salaries to offi-
cers, because the party’s Work is done largely
by volunteers. ' ‘
‘In addition, the party is much more than a
political organization in the common sense.
Each member looks upon himself as partof
a worldwide movement which has aims far
beyond holding office. The Socialist party,
says one of its leaflets, “takes the farmer, the
printer, the laborer, the teacher, and others
and gives them a sense of power, in a World of

change.” Since each member is Working for

an ideal expressed in an organization Wide as
the world in its scope, broad as all human ex-
perience in its vision, he is more likely to
throw himself into voluntary Work for Social-
ism.
