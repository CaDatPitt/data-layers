(to as remote» 31 mm. smear)

our greatest Congress has exerted influence in Washington and throughout the
country to which reports were carried by the Associated and United.Press services.
This influence will be increased many times now that delegates have returned home
and begin to carry out the decisions of the Congress.

The American Congress for Peace and Democracy represented a wide section of the
American people. and there was particular growth in the representation from trade
Unions and youth organizations. The Negro and the Chinese people were represented b3
their outstanding leaders. The Gredantials Committee was extremely conservative in
its account and eliminated the Ndtional.Xegr0 Congress. an affiliate body. and dras~
tically cut the representation fm§i:nﬁn; othnt organisations in an attempt to arrive
39 3 ¢0rreCt1Y conservative tﬁuﬁto Ibo rhprvﬂbntﬁtton from the American League for
lance and Democracy was out iron the figure on the do1egates' credentials to the ao~
teal paid up membership as of Dec. 29th, 1938. However. in the preparation of the
report an error was made in this figure which was actually 19,972. Also a credential
from an international union had been mislaid and actually 16 Internationals were re»
presented. What representation was lost was balanced by a certain amount of overlap»
ping which could not be estimated correctly in the membership of the organizations
which were counted. The final figure of the representation at the Congress through
official delegates is given as 7.469.937.

It should be noted that about 65% of the organizations rdpresented had never be»
fore attended an American League Congress. The political parties referred to in the
Credentials report are local or regional parties and no national political party is
included or was asked to send delegates. Those listed include the'Washington Common»

wealth Federation, the Wisconsin Progressive Darty, the Minnesota Farmer—Labor Party.
etc. '

The number of delegates was about the same as a year ago, inasmuch as an effort
was made in preparing this Congress to have national organizations represented as
mﬂﬁh bysa for delegates rather than to have city and district representation on a
large scale from these organizations.

The principle weaknegs in representation at the congress was from the farm
1 ups. The American Ldhjﬁﬁvuhich is the executive arm or the Congress. recogniaia
i e work which must be demo in the country districts and towns to bring our progrﬂn
to the entire country an§'to enlist its support.

Among the major deoitiona taken by the Congress. aside from the resolutions
adopted, were those to hold 1,000 meetings throughout the country immediately to put
forward our program. to rally the forces opposing fascism and to enlarge these forc-
es. These meetings will be held on issues such as lifting the embargo on th; Spanish
Government. placing an embargo on Germany. Japan and Italy. defending the Wagner Act.
opposing the appropriations of new funds for the Dies Comittee which has become the
rallying point for the Fascist forces in the United States, and providing socially
useful work for all our people. Another decision was to distribute 10,000,000 leafé~
lots on magor issues through house-1o~house canvassing.

This Congress illustrated the strength of the forces of progress in the United
States and laid down a program and a p1an.of action which the country can make its
own. Attached: Report of Er. lard. Chairman of the American League for Peace and Don
