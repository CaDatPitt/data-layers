was part of that package; that Nationalist China at that
time supported the United States proposal; that Mr. Dulles
was at that time an alternate United States delegate; and
that it was the Soviets who at that time blocked the deal.

This time the Soviets agreed and we balked, although the
list contained thirteen countries that we wanted in and only
five that the Soviets wanted in. As Mr. Lippmann put it
" The Soviet Union, swallowing hard over Spain and Japan,
nevertheless swallowed them, "while" Mr. Dulles and
Mr. Lodge gagged at Outer Mongolia. They could swallow
Albania. 'l‘hey could not swallow Outer Mongolia." Mr.
Lippmann said that we were outwitted, because in fact we
didn't want the package deal to fail, and so, in his words,
we were driven to

the humiliating business of working behind the
scenes to persuade other nations that, despite
our own abstention, they should vote for Outer
Mongolia and put the deal through. For men who
are continually proclaiming their devotion to
moral principles, this is a truly dismal perfor-
mance.

Mr . Lippmann concluded that we got into what he called this
" mess"because Mr. Lodge and Mr. Dulles "did not take

the trouble to think out what they were doing. . It was just .

the lack of a reasonable, not very difficult or far-reaching
foresight." But I would go further than Mr. Lippmann. I
would hardly risk my professional reputation as a student
of foreign affairs by praising either Mr. Lodge or Mr.
Dullesfor sturdy common sense and lucid far—sightedness,
but I think that something else is needed to explain their
mumbling and bumbling, and I believe that that something
else is the waning but still deadly power that Formosa has
to raise insurrection and mutiny within the ranks of the
Republican Party.

I should therefore like to leave with you a suggestion that

you may ponder for yourselves. It is obvious that Chiang '

Kai—shek will never return to China in a rowboat. to be

welcomed by cheering crowds who will overthrow the pre-4
sent government and reinstate him. He has only one pros-
pect for return to the mainland, and that is a grim one for

8

 

 

Americans to contemplate: a general war, with an Amer-
ican victory over Russia and reinstatement of Chaing in
China as an American protege, as a by-product of that
victory. Therefore, Chiang's compelling and enduring in-
terestisin hostilitybetween America and Russia, growing
in acerbity from dispute to dispute and keeping open the
prospect of war. He cannot survive politically in a climate
of live -and—let—live agreements between America and Rus-
sia, on United Nations membership or anything else.

My inference from this, and I leave it to you to decide
whether itis also your inference, is that President Eisen-
hower does not represent the America Chiang Kai—shek

wants. He would prefer a Republican Party dominated by '

Senator Knowland to the coalition led by President Eisen-
hower. That is why Chiang twice turned down personal re-
quests from President Eisenhower not to use his veto on
the package deal. After all, it was President Eisenhower
who wound up the Korean war, President Eisenhower who
countermanded the melodramatic "unleashing" of Chiang
in the Formosa Straits, President Eisenhower who con-
vinced the Russians at Geneva that America doesn't want
a hydrogen war. Chiang Kai-shek's cue, therefore, is to
act as if Senator Knowland were the President and the China
Lobby the State Department. And Mr. Dulles, unhappy
man, is the link between the Formosa-First wing of the
Republican Party, and the Eisenhower-Geneva wing —- a
weak link, that stretches in either direction according to
who is tugging at the seat of Mr. Dulles's pants at the

moment.

You will notice that I have made a transition from comment
on the internal demoralization of the State Department to
comment on the public discussion of public affairs, using
for that purpose the most famous and stately of all natural
bridges, Mr. Walter Lippmann. Discussion and debate
are ata low level in America today. There is an arid lack
of originality and of that individualism to which we pay lip
service as one of the essentials of democratic life. We are
bloated with orthodoxy and windy with conformity.

Again, I will give you just one example. The Far Eastern
Association met last year in Washington, D.C. The Far
Eastern Association is the professional body of all the

 

academic specialists, and many govermnent specialists,
dealing with Asia —— specialists inlanguage, history, phil-
osophy, art, religion, as well as politics, economics, in-
ternational relations, military problems, and sociology.
At the time of the meeting, the problem of the Formosa
Straits was at an ugly crisis. A foreign visitor came up
to me -- a man of great learning and wide experience who
wasaRoman Catholic missionary in China for many years.
" Whata strange condition this country is in!" he said "In
Europe it wouldbe impossible. " Iasked him what he meant.
He meant, he said, that many of America's most urgent
problems are in the Far East —— but they weren't being dis-
cussed by the nation's specialists, meeting in the nation's
capital. Whatwasbeing discussedwas history, prehistory,
art. philosophy. -- anything safely "non—controversial. "
"Now I am convinced," said my friend, "that the acad-
emic people in this country really are afraid." In a dem-
ocracy, this is a bad thing. In a democracy, the public
debate of conflicting opinions, including minority opinions,
ought to be considered not only permissible but necessary.
I maintainthat itis axiomatic that in a democratic country
it is not possible to have government political, economic
and military intelligence services that are as good as they
ought to be unless it is possible for the government to re-
cruit from academic and other experts whose training has
been completely free from government influence, who are
not over-awed by the official line of the moment, and who
have a fearless and natural habit of probing into difficult
and controverisal questions with zest and without inhibi-
tions.

At present, we do not have these ideal democratic condi-
tions in our country. For the sake of brevity, I will deal
here with only one aspect of an admittedly complex problem.

Inrecent years there has been an immense growth of gov-
ernment inﬂuence in academic research. A great deal
of research is carried on through university contracts with
government departments and agencies. This is one of the
most important academic trends of the post—war period.
The universities get a percentage on such contracts, and
more and more this source of revenue is becoming indis-
pensable to them because it is big enough to help them pay
for their own work, not done under government contract.

10

 

 

The typical contract is for a project to be completed in a
relatively short time, not for a program that becomes a
permanent part of the university's life. Consequently,
most of the personnel hired. for the project do not become
permanent members of the faculty, with tenure, but de-
velop into academic nomads, moving from campus to cam-
pus and one limited project to another. Since projects of
this kind usually require clearance, these nomads must
acquire aprofessional habit of being able to pass repeated
clearance tests. It seems to me inevitable that men whose
livelihood depends on repeated government grants, accom-
panied by government scrutiny, will develop a willingness
to conform, a willingness to draw out of their material
what they think is wanted rather than what they think the
material really means.

Moreover, bureaucrats in recent years have been under-
standably obsessed by the fear that politicians may take
out on the war-path after them, and so the bureaucratic
disease of over-classification has become rampant. All
kinds of information, including political, economic and
sociological data, gets locked away into government files
instead of being contributed to the general fund of academic
andpublic knowledge where it can be criticized, re-exam-
ined, and competitively re-evaluated. 'lhis abuse is com-
pounded, of course, when commentators and writers who
are considered "safe", but no others, are allowed to draw
on such files "for background information without attri-
bution of source."

Or, if the material is declassified, it must be doctored
enough to make it immune to political attack. One of my
most depressing experiencesin the last two or three years
was when a young man who had been working for the gov-
ernment presented me with a copy of something he had
published. He had had to have it cleared before he printed
it. He knew that I had read some of his work in the same
field, before he took a government job. He hesitated a
moment and then said, " You'll recognize that some of this
is pretty crude stuff -- but we all have to do it, to hold our
jobs."

I submit that in a free society, that kind of thing is fatal.

11

 

Let me give you an example of what happens when the pro-
cess of forming an intelligent public opinion by discussion
and controversy is neglected -- even when there is no factor
of intimidation present -- and for lack of a critical and well
informed public opinion, government policy makers do not
face realtities soon enough. I will take my example from
the experience of Britain, another democratic country,
which Americans can examine without getting their passions
involved.

If there was one country in the world where the British
felt that everything was under control, it was the King-
dom of Jordan. The British created the Kingdom of Jordan,
after the first World War, and installed its ruling family.
They created its army, the famous Arab Legion. A man
named John Glubb; the famous Glubb Pasha, now Sir John
Glubb, was the iron hand in the velvet glove controlling the
Arab Legion and Jordan. He was not just a soldier sent
out from England for a routine tour of duty. He spent
twenty—five years in the country. He was the man who was
supposed to know everything that could possibly happen,
before it happened. Yet all of a sudden the Kingdom of
Jordan threw him out the other day. They took him to the
airport under an escort of tanks and told him to go — and
Britain's position in the Middle East was shattered.

There has been a storm in the British press. Here are
some of the comments:

"Another sickening blow to British power and
prestige."
" Negligence and indecision."
"One of the worst examples of British bungling
. . . since the days of Munich."
And this from the London News Chronicle:
"Once again our Foreign Office has put its trust
inprinces — and paid the penalty. Some strange
reverence for Middle East royalty always impels
our diplomats to shore up a few shaky thrones

’ instead of seeking to come to terms with the
people.

Isn't this the heart of the matter? The unrest of the Middle
East is basically a social unrest. -The twentieth century,

12

 

with its oil wells and tanks and planes is bursting in on that
part of the world; but the society of the Middle East is still
the society of five hundred years ago with its autocratic
princes, its soldier-adventurers, its religious and tribal
fanaticisms, and its poverty, ignorance, and misery for
the mass of the people. That old society is breaking down
under the strain. 'l‘his social instability cannot be brought
under control by the old political maneuvers of offering a
subsidy here and withdrawing a subsidy there. It is this
that the British, including the press that is now so ready
with criticism, failed to realize in time. If you look up
the files of the British papers and journals you will find
plentyof comment on surface political events but not nearly
enough presentation of the facts, and discussion of the
significance, of the strong undercurrentof social pressure.
And the consequence of channelling all discussion toward
the superficial and neglecting the main pressures is that
when the pressure becomes so great that there is an ex-
plosion, everybody is taken unawares, there is panic,
and governments, cabinets, alliances, and policies are
shaken.

I choose this example because we Americans have our own
Kingdom of Jordan, in Formosa. We are worried and dis-
turbed about China, but we are taking Formosa for granted.
Yet we badly need, and we are not getting, a widely publi-
cized, cool, even—tempered but thoroughly tough-‘minded
and realistic discussion of Formosa‘s difficult problems
so that when new and important decisions about Formosa
have to be made the government can act, and the public
can understand what the government is doing, in terms of
an expected new phase of a well-understood problem, in-
stead of both government and people being stampeded into
spasmodic, violent, and very likely dangerous reaction to
an ill-understood emergency. We are not getting the dis-
cussion we need because for all practical purposes -— and
by practical I mean practical, like getting a job, holding
a job, or being free from attack as "subversive", or
"following the Communist line", or "being soft on Com-
munism" -— one of the important current tests of the loyalty
of an American citizen is whether he performs the neces-
sary ceremonial kow-tows in the direction of our most
fractious and petulant foreign underling, Chiang Kai-shek.

13

 

The question of Formosa is closely linked with the question
of China, but the two problems are not identical. First let
us consider China, and then the relationship between the
Formosa problem and the China problem. On the question
of China, several approaches are open, and there is more
than one line along which discussion could be developed
and policy eventually formulated. Among the alternatives,
one sensible point from which we might begin is the point
from which John Foster Dulles was starting to begin in
1950, butfrom which he has long since scuttled away. In

1950 Mr. Dulles said -— I am quoting from his book, War
or Peace, page 190:

Some of the present member nations (of The
United Nations), and others that might become
members, have governments that are not repre-
sentative of the people. But if in fact theyare
"governments" — that is, if they "govern" --
then they have a power which should be repre-
sentedin any organization that purports to mir-
ror world reality.

If the Communist government of China in fact
provesits ability to govern China without serious
domestic resistance, then it, too, should be ad-
mittedtothe United Nations. However, a regime
that claims to have become the government of a
country through civil war should not be recog-
nized until it has been tested over a reasonable
period of time. . . .

. . . . . Communist governments today dominate
more than 30 percent of the population of the
world. We may not like that fact; indeed, we
do not like it at all. But if we want to have a-
world organization (Mr. Dulles's italics), then
it should be representative of the world as it is.

As contrasted with Mr. Dulles's presentation of 1950, the
one line of argument that beyond any doubt whatever leads
into a blind alley is the line to which we are at present
committed: thata government which is not even in China,
and which could not possibly return there without a massive
foreign support that would arouse the most fundamental

14

 

 

nationalistic and patriotic resistance, is the government
that is properly qualified to represent, to vote for, and to
exercise the veto onbehalf of, 500 or more million Chinese
and the vast mainland of China.

Which brings us to Formosa itself. The problem can be
set out in this way: first, how long do we maintain that it
is practical policy to act as if Chiang Kai—shek will be able
to fight his way back to China? Second, at what point is
there a danger that an increasingly impotent Chiang, war-
lord of an increasingly aged army, will become a public
farce ? Some of the nations we need the most in Europe and
Asia already think the whole business is a farce. Third,
if the situation becomes so far out of line with reality that
something has to be done, what does the public expect the
government to do, and is the government thinking in terms
of what the public wants, or in terms of what the public can
be cajoled, or perhaps frightened, into going along with?

The government of Formosa is a rump government. I

have referred to it in the past as "driftwood on the beaches

of Formosa, "but perhaps it couldbe more accurately de-

scribed as a loose collection of mines that drifted ashore
after the civil war in China, some of which are still ex-
plosive while others are already duds. No public classifi-
cation of the explosives and the duds has ever been made.
The rump government is a military dictatorship of several
hundred thousand defeated troops from the mainland, to-
gether with bureaucrats, political hacks, and camp fol-
lowers. It is imposed on a Formosan population which is
of Chinese stock, mainly from the neighboring coastal pro-
vince of Fukien. Though Chinese, the Formosans have as
little in common as Chinese could have with the occupying
forces which come chiefly from North China, the Yangtze
River provinces, and Canton. The Formosans have no

great devotion to Chaing Kai—shek, His troops handled

them very brutally in the first period of liberation from

the Japanese.

Chiang Kai-shek's government isa rump government in its
primary aspect. As all of you have doubtless reflected,
the primary characteristic of a rump is that it is split.
The split in Chiang‘s regime is over the difference between
mainlanders who would like to get back to the mainland,

15

 

and islanders who maybe afraid of the mainland Commun-
ists, but have no enthusiasm for an island crusade of eight
or nine million people against a mainland with a population
of over 500 million. It is also a split over the difference
between being unleashed and tied up on the leash again.
This in turn leads to a split, among Chiang's own officers,
between those who still hope that a new crisis may enable
those Americans who have more gambling spirit than hard
sense to get the upper hand and set off a world war, and
those who are beginning to think that the time is coming to
ditch Chiang and make personal deals with the Communists
to get back home. The reality of this split was revealed
recently when General Sun Li—jen, the darling of the Amer-
ican military advisors but never one of the inside gang of
Chiang's military politicians, was euchered out of office
on the charge that one of his subordinates was plotting
with the Communists. This particular charge may very
well have been a fake, but it points to a situation that is
really there. It is a situation with plenty of danger in it.

Among the refugees on Formosa, as among the Tsarist

efugees after the Russian revolution, the number of offi-
cers is out of all proportion to the number of enlisted men.
Iremember one news story that mentioned, if I remember
rightly, more than 1, 200 generals. Not many of them can
have much of a future if the stay on Formosa is indefinite.
In the meantime the Chinese Communist radio has a pro-
gram of calling officers (and also enlisted men) by name,
telling them news of the old home town or village, how their
relatives are getting on, and who has what job. They also
tell them that when the Communists take Formosa there
will be no political revenge against individuals if they do
the right thing —-- even if they do it only at the very last
moment. This kind of thing is clearly an invitation for a
"colonels' coup" or " generals‘ putsch" by which Formosa
might be taken, or half—taken, from the inside before a
Communist landing. If so, what would be the reaction of
a totally unprepared American public ?

These unlovely aspects of "free world" politics on For-
mosa have occasionally been gone over, very lightly, by
commentators who alternate between being far -sighted and
far—fetched, like the Alsop brothers, but they certainly
have notbecome part of the general field of informed public

16

 

 

discussion. Yet if they are not calmly discussed and as-

- sessed, we are living in a political dream—world, and one

day, when the realities break in and shatter the dreams, we
shall be in danger of another spasm of vengeful panic. In-
stead of admitting that we have been kidding ourselves for
several years, there will be an agonized howl that some-
body must have betrayed us, and another hunt for scape-
goats will be on.

And even if Chiang's own military machine does not blow
up in his face and ours, there is another time-bomb tick-
ing away - that of Formosan nationalism. I do not know
when it will explode, any more than Idid in the case of
Jordan, but I am perfectly sure that it will -- and when it
does, it will very likely take the form of a demand for uni-
fication with the majority group on the mainland, the kins-
men by language, culture, historical tradition, and na-
tional pride. When that time comes, it will be no use tell-
ing the people on Formosa that they are better off in taxes,
land, personal liberty, and everything else under Amer-
ican protection than they would be under Communist rule,
no more use than it is, for example, telling the people of
Cyprus that British colonial rule is less corrupt and more
even-handed than Greek politics.

I do not know what ought to be done about Formosa, right
now or in the way of alternative policies to be got ready in
case things develop in one or the other of several direc-
tions. I am only saying that the kinds of things I have been
talking about are the realities of politics, and that if we
are to have a home life free from sudden surges of panic,
public opinion ought to be allowed to get used to the real-
ities, to hearing them talked about, to considering alter-
natives discussed ina reasonable manner, even if some of
the facts that come to light may be ugly and unwelcome.

I do not see how we can have a stable public opinion, with
a keel on it, able to ride out storms, until the public is
more adequately informed. We need more in the market
place —— more facts, and more ideas. And the only thing
that stops us from getting them is fear —- the fear that,
for dealing in facts and ideas, we may be accused of polit-
ical unreliability and what the Japanese used to call "dan-
gerous thoughts". Ithinkitis worth remembering that the

17

 

 

typical Japanese "dangerous thought" was a democratic
thought, which was dangerous because it could get you
called a Red. As long as this fear lasts, discussion is
bogged down at the savage and childish level of declaiming,
for your own safety, "I hate them more than you do, so
there!" and cannot rise to the civilized and adult level of
suggesting, asa contribution to the- public good, "I think I
may have a better idea for dealing with them than massive
retaliation. "

Fortunately, I think that matters may be taking a better
turn, and I think that the right reason for this turn has
been given by that great scientist and admirable citizen,
Linus Pauling. In an address in Sweden, where he spoke
for the entire group of Nobel Prize winners, he said that
he thought that the question of war and peace had been

solved by the hydrogen bomb -- that the lmowledge of what
world war would mean, will surely lead to permanent peace .

The question here is one of the direction of movement. If
we are edging closer and closer to a final, world—destroy—
ing showdown, then the deep, main undercurrents, in spite

of surface improvements like the "Geneva spirit", or the

new " soft"line in Moscow are in favor of every sudden
incident that could detonate crisis and war. If, on the other
hand, we are, as Ibelieve, edging away from war and to-
ward some kind of competitive co-existence, then the deep
main currents are infavor of "conferences at the summit",
in spite of setbacks, infavor of such astonishing and really
novel developments as Krishna Menon's coming forward,
as an Asian intermediary, to smooth the way for a recon-
ciliation between France and the United Nations; in favor
of the survival and success of countries in the middle (I

prefer that term to "neutralist"), like India, Indonesia,

and Burma, in spite of all tizzies and tantrums —— whether
it is Mr. Khrushchev having a tantrum in Burma or Mr.
David Lawrence having a tizzy in the American press.

I think that a sign of the turn for the better is Mr. Walter
Lippmann coming down on the heads of Mr. Lodge and Mr.
Dulles like a ton of platitudes. But what I should like to
see is not just Mr. Lippmann as a courageous but lonely
and isolated elder statesman of the American public dis-
cussion of public affairs, but a rising young generation of

18

 

new Lippmanns of the future. What we will have to grant
them, if we are ever to get them, is the right of expres-
sion not only after they have attained wisdom, but while
in the process of acquiring wisdom -— the right to take
minority positions, as an essential in testing the soundness

,of the majority position: the right not only to make mistakes

in the course of learning, but to be free of jealous and
vindicitive persecution when they turn out to be right a long
way ahead of other people. I also think that there is some-
thing that all of us can do about it. In the words of that in-
dependent, non-ideological, deeply conservative radical,
Bernard De Voto, whose recent death we all lament but
whose courage and constant readiness for battle we should
all emulate, "the place to stop the erosion of freedom is
right here . "

Ihave said what I have said tonight because Ibelieve in
exercising whatever civil liberties we have. I don't be-
lieve in just bemoaning civil liberties that have been, as
De Voto said, eroded. I have had, in my time, reason to
fear, but I have tried to get over the inhibitions of fear
andto call some of the turns as I see them and to put before
you some of the recently ignored aspects of our China pol-
icy. I have not tried to come to any conclusions, andl
may be off the beam even in my suggestions. If the study
of international relations is to be productive, it has to be
a continuous process of self—education_. and over the past
five years my self-education has been subjected to a cer-
tain amount of interruption. For that reason I have to rely
heavily on experience, on background knowledge. Ifeel
unsure whenever a topic of discussion requires a lot of
recent information. Any opinions Imay express are not
as well informed as they were before 1950. Iam having
to start all over again.

But because I am having to start all over again, I feel that
I have agreat deal in common with much younger men who
are tryingto qualify themselves for the public discussion
of public affairs. Ifeel not only that they, and I, have the
right to express opinions, right or wrong, but that you
have the right to consider them.

19

   

One of the weaknesses of our public life at the present
time is that once a man has been attacked for his opinions,
no matter how irresponsibly or maliciously, he becomes
what the newspapers call "controversial", and no aspect
of the influence of fear in foreign policy is more striking
than the fact that once a man has been called controversial,
it is considered not interesting, but dangerous to listen to
him or to suggest in conversation with strangers that he
might be right. I spent four months in Europe last sum-
mer, and gave a number of lectures in England, Denmark,
Switzerland, and Italy. It was a nostalgic and refreshing
and stimulating experience to find what knowledge I may
have and what ideas I may put forward, accepted and dis-
cussed on their merits, and not refracted and distorted by
the heat of politics.

If any newspapers report this talk, and Idoubt if they do,
the way they play it will be an indication of the extent to
which the tide of fear is turning. For any who, not being
here tonight, will only hear of what I have to say by ex-
cerpt and quotation, there are therefore only two things
that I want to stress. I believe in my right to be wrong,
and still more in my right to be right. It is ironic that
because of the fear which has resulted in so much and such
fantastic re—writing of the recent history of China, and our
relations with China, my righmess has in recent years
received much less consideration than my alleged wrong-
ness. The most fantastic thing of all is that the one thing
on which Iwas really wrong was either never mentioned at
all, or perverted into its exact opposite. I mean my slow-
ness in realizing that Chiang Kai-shek's palace guard and
his own increasing megalomania had pulled him down from
the high place that he had once occupied as the symbol of
China and a great figure of freedom in Asia; that, as the
Chinese put it, he was losing the mandate of heaven. That
is a salutary reminder that there is often more danger of
being stabbed in the back by hired assassins than of hon-
orable wounds inflicted in battle. If that is a fact of life,
take it as a fact of life, and face it. But for you and me
and all of us the rule of honor remains the same: we can
but keep on trying to be right.

FREEDOMS AND FOREIGN POLICY

Owen Lattimore

In the winter of 1939-1940 the Russians invaded Finland
in a preventive war. They were trying to secure their
Leningrad flank against the rapid extension of Nazi power
after the fallcf Poland. The Russians ran into some stun-
ning defeats which did serious damage to their military
prestige. Eventually they turned on enough artillery and
manpower to crush the Finns, but the damage had been
done . Undoubtedly the poor showing of Russia in Finland
was one reason why General Marshall advised President
Roosevelt, when the Nazis invaded Russia in 1941, that
the Russians would collapse . Consequently when President
Roosevelt committed the United States to a policy which
included the survival of Russia as one of its basic assump-
tions, he had to rely chieﬂy on his own political common
sense and courage . I know something of what was involved,
because it was only a few weeks after the Nazi invasion of
Russia that I went out to China as advisor to Chiang Kai-
shek, andakeytopic that President Roosevelt talked to m.e
about before I left was the necessity for impressing on
Chiang Kai-shek that he, Roosevelt, was confident that the
Russians, in spite of early defeats. would hold out.

Now, in the case <1’ Finland, why did the Russians under-
estimate so disastrously the resistance they would meet?
The answer. I think, can only be in terms of the theme I
am talking about tonight - freedoms and foreign policy.
There were at that time quite a few Finnish Fascists, and
they held important Positions in the army. There were
also a few Finnish Communists, but they were not strong
because theywere regarded as subservient to Russia, and
hostility to Russia had long been a main theme of Finnish
nationalism. But it proved that the backbone of the Finnish
resistance was the democratic'homogeneity of the people.
The vast majority of the Finns felt that the kind of economic
and social life they led, and the kind of government they had,
were what they wanted, and they were prepared to defend
these things with desperate courage and se1f—sacrifice.

But, justbecause there were some Fascists in Finland and

1

 

 

a few Communists, the Russians in their own propaganda
to themselves had oversimplified and distorted the real
balance of forces. The Finns were supposed to be groan-
ing under Fascist tyranny, and the loyal party line was to
assume that great numbers of them would swing over to the
Communists, who were depicted as the true popular van-
guard. Inthe tense political climate of Russia,itwas safe
f or anybody who was sending in a political report on Fin-
land to tailor it to this accepted political doctrine, and
dangerous to point out the unpopular facts; and this polit-
ical fear crippled their intelligence service.

Could there ever be a comparable situation in a genuinely
democratic society like that of the United States? There
not only can be, but to a depressing extent there already
is - althoughldo not think the situation is as bad as it was
a while ago.

Itis not a condemnation of our system, but merely a facing
of the realities of the ways in which human beings act, to
point out that even in a genuinely democratic society there
will always be a tendency, affecting a lot of people, to try
to please the powers thatbe . It is, after all, a well-proven
technique for getting ahead in life. I doubt, for instance,

. whether the career of anybody in military intelligence was

retarded severely by sending in an estimate that the Nazi
armies would go through the Soviet armies like a knife
through butter; because, though such an estimate was prov-
ed to be militarily incompetent, it showed that the officer
in question was politically a sound and trustworthy fellow.
Whereas General Faymonville, the one officer of the time
who said flatly that the Soviet forces were a match for the
Nazis, was detoured to jobs of secondary importance for
the rest of his career in the Army.

I have an accidental but personal interest in this question of
estimating Soviet military power . In 1936 I was in Moscow
for a few days. There I met Faymonville , who was then a
colonel and our military attache, and also a British colonel.
There had recently been some fighting between Russians
and Japanese on the border between Manchuria and Mom
golia, and so military speculations were a natural topic of
conversation. Both Colonel Faymonville and the British
colonel said substantially the same thing — that Russian

troops, tactics and strategy should not be judged by West-
ern standards. They were backed by a much weaker in-
dustry, but within their own strategical framework they
were stronger than Western opinion made them out to be.
Remembering these conversations, I was glad to agree
with President Roosevelt when he told me, in 1941, to
assure Chiang Kai—shek that his long—range estimate must
emphatically be based on Russia not collapsing.

Incidentally, I have never since heard of that British colo-
nel. Ihave often wondered whether his career withered
away like that of General Faymonville.

Asfor the effect of fear indeciding how a man does his job,
let me take a couple of minutes to tell you a story. One
Sunday evening several years ago, bored with the football
news, I started fiddling with the shortwave band on the
radio. In a few minutes Igot, quite strong and clear, a
Soviet station broadcasting to North America in English.
It was a lot of nonsense - Wall Street warmongers and all
the rest of it. There probably weren't more than 19 Am-
ericans who caught that program. But if there had been
one thousand, 999 of them would have been solidly con-
firmed in their previous opinion that the Russians are not
only abysmally ignorant about America, but bull-headed
and arrogant in the way they sound off about things they
don't know or under stand.

Well, you know how it is with short-wave radio. There
was another station just on the edge of the same beam, and
occasionally, when the volume swelled, there would be a
word or two that sounded like Russian. So I did some more
fiddling and got the station. It was a Voice of America
station, broadcasting in Russian to Russia - and was the
fellow pouring it on! It was a very unsubtle name—calling,
a kind of mirror-image of what the Russians had just been
saying and just as guaranteed to put most listeners‘ backs
up.

There is a funny side to this business of the pot and the
kettle calling each other black, but I think it is also serious.
That Russian script writer didn't have his mind on planting
little seeds of Marxist thought in American minds. He knew
that acopy of his script would go on file. And just in case

 

I
\

some nosey commissar came poking around, looking for
sabotage, he wanted the scriptto show that he was a 110
percent party-liner. And neither couldthe American con-
centrate on writinga script that might have some chance of
influencing Russians. He wanted to keep his job, and in
case a congressional investigating committee ever got
around to his stack of scripts in the files, he wanted it to
show that he hated them as much as anybody. When men
begin to carry out their jobs not according to the profes-
sional standards and purposes of the job, but according to
the degree of jeopardy from some future investigation, and
when they don't even lmow who the next investigators will
be, or what game theywill be hunting next time, the dangers
radiate all through the fabric of our society.

There are other examples that don't even have a funny side
to them like the kind of fear that caused the State Depart-
ment to fire John Davies and to fire, drop, or ease out
many others. In 1944 Mr. John P. Davies was regarded
as a brilliant and rapidly rising young officer in the For-
eign Service of the State Department. He was at that time
attached asa political liaison officer to General Stilwell's
headquarters in China, and one of his duties was to write
political analyses. In one such analysis he dealt with the
possibilities of civil war in China at the end of the war with
Japan. His thesis was that in such a war the Communists
would win, partly because they already had an effective
army and a strong territorial base, partly because they

were, at that time, going a long way toward meeting the
ordinary wishes of ordinary people. Most important of all,
he diagnosed the Kuomintang, the party of Chiang Kai-

shek, as far gone in corruption, and counting on military

force to suppress popular resistance . But Chiang's troops,
said Mr. Davies, were also far gone. He described them
as "dispirited, shambling legions," and with a sardonic
reference to Chiang Kai—shek's book, China's Destiny, he
predicted that China's destiny lay with the Communists, not
with Chiang.

Another thesis of John Davies (not given in this despatch)
was that American policy should be flexible enough to deal
with the emergence of a Communist China, because the
only way to prevent sucha China from becoming purely an

 

 

‘I

instrument of Russian policy would be to convince the
Chinese that they could deal with America and that it would
be totheir advantage to do so. He was infact talking about
the possibility of policies for dealing with 'I‘itoism, long be-
fore the political phenomenon of 'I‘itoism had startled the
world.

Incidentally, itisa little known fact that a comparable be-
lief was heldbya powerful group in Japanese naval intelli-
gence . It is not entirely clear why these Japanese thought
the way they did, but one possible explanation is that they
fore saw the defeat of Japan and thought that the best way to
deal withpost—war Communist movements in Asia would be
to give them a nationalistic slant, to make them more in-
dependent of Moscow. Or they may have wanted to infil-
trate Communist movements. At any rate, with ruthless
Japanese logic the Naval Intelligence in Indonesia, under
Admiral Mayeda, recruited young Indonesians, gave them a
Marxist training, taught them how to organize and turned
them loose into Indonesian politics.

Itis rather better known that the British were actively in-
terested in Yugoslavia during the war, that Churchill per-
sonally made the decision to support the Communist, Tito,
and drop the anti—Communist, General Mihailovitch, and
that Churchill's liaison officer, Brigadier Maclean, testi-
fied against Mihailovitch after the war. Brigadier Mac-
lean is today a member of Parliament. He is a member
of the Conservative party.

In other words, willingness to do some fresh thinking about
various aspects of Communism and even to experiment
with novel policies was internationally widespread in the
rapidly changing conditions created by the ending of the
war: but only in the United States did it ruin the careers of
men whose professional duty it was to keep abreast of
changing conditions and to keep all possible policy alter-
natives under review.

My point is that one may agree with or disagree with a
particular analysis by a foreign service officer, either at
the time or -later, with the advantage of hindsight. Iwould
not myself agree or disagree with equal certainty to all the
points or suggestions made by Mr. Davies in the various

 

excerpts of his despatches that have been published. But I
think that an officer who has that kind of job should be praised
and encouraged, and not wantonly exposed to "loyalty -
security" attack for ceaselessly investigating and searching
for new clues to old and tangled problems. Note moreover
that in this particular despatch Mr . Davies made an accu -
rate prediction. Defenders of civil liberty often appeal for
tolerance on the ground that a man has "the right to be
wrong." But Mr. Davies was ruined because he had been
right.

The bloodthirsty search for scapegoats that followed the
ignominious collapse of Chiang Kai-shek forced on Mr.
Davies a long, losing battle for his professional life. His
attackers assumed that he must have written the way he did
because he wanted Chiang Kai-shek to lose and the Com-
munists to win. In vain he produced other despatches to
prove that he was anti-Russian. When the witchhunters
are on the prowl, it isa mug's game to try to convince them
that you are not soft on Chinese Communists by proving
that you are tough on Russians. He was suspect for the
same reason that General Faymonville had been suspect in
less hysterical times; he was too accurately right, too
early; therefore, the whisper went, he must have been
"sympathetic". After being heard and cleared eight or nine
times -- Iforget the exactnumber -— Mr. Davis was finally
fired under conditions that cynically advertised that this
was a case of political human sacrifice and not of profes-
sional censure.

Our government thus lost a valuable servant. It had pre-
viously lost a lot of others. Its panel of trained, profes-
sional experts on China has been virtually destroyed. The
effect of this kind of surrender to fear in the handling of
foreign policy goes far beyond the immediate victims. A
letter to the New York Times of December 4 from Mr.
Perry Laukhoff, formerlydirector of the Office of German
Political Affairs (not China Affairs!) of the State Depart-
ment put it very well:

Thoughtful and inspired men whose ideas the
country needs desperately at a time when our
world position is deteriorating have been driven
out of the Foreign Service by scores. 'l‘hose who

 

 

are left. . . .are, and must be, in the mass less
bold, less imaginative, more conformist and
more beaten down spiritually by three years of
clear demonstration that they are at the mercy of
unrestrained and ruthle ss secret political power .

The retreat of the State Department from a professional
defense of the professional standards of its own personnel
has been a bi-partisan disgrace. It was begun in Mr.
Truman's administration by Mr. Acheson, who has since
had the courage to admit that he was partly responsible for
the original Truman loyalty order, and that it was a "grave

mistake". But the practice of throwing State Department

personnel over the tail of the sled to appease the pursuing
wolves has continued under the Republicans. The final pol-
troonery of the bumping off of Mr. Davies was Mr. Du1les's.

As a result we now have, I make bold to say, the weakest
foreign service of any great country in dealing with prob-
lems of Asia, and especially China. I think it can be said
in the most matter-of—fact way possible that today, for a
man to hold a high American position dealing with Asia,
and especially with China, it is of quite secondary impor-
tance whether he knows anything about the Far East,and of
absolutely primary importance that he should be politically
acceptable, not simply to the Republican Party, but to the
extreme right wing, the Formosa-first wing of that party.
And this, if the position is important enough, means that

' he must also be acceptable to a foreign government, that

of Formosa, out of fear that if he is not, he will be sniped
off his perch.

This kind of fear in foreign policy results inevitably in de-
vious maneuvers and fatal hesitations. Let me illustrate.
At the time of the now famous "package deal" for admitting
new members to the United Nations, Mr. Walter Lippmann,
one of the few today who are not afraid to call the turns as
they see them, took the makers of our foreign policy to
task in a very strong article about the mess they had got
into. He called it (New York Herald Tribune, November
29) "a horrible example of how to lose face, of how to lose
influence, of how to make this country look foolish." He
pointed out that the idea of a package deal was first proposed
by the United States itself, in 1946; that Outer Mongolia
