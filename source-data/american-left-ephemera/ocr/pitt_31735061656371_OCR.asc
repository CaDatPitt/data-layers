anti—semitic. John Watson was not anti-semitic. John Watson

was not prosecuted and attempting to be charged for

beating the hell out of a white newsmen, because he was a member of
allegedly beat up Joe Weaver. He was charged because he was a
member of a revolutionary organization and he was making an effi—
cient revolutionary use of an available resource to replace
resources we no longer had. He took over the paper.

Ron March, member of the Central Staff of the League of
Revolutionary Black Workers. One of the founding members of
DRUﬁ (Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement) which went on strike
in lsC8, closed down the Dodge Main plant, which related to
ELDRUM (Eldon Avenue Revolutionary Union Movement) another
member organization that closed down the Eldon Avenue Assembly
plant which makes axel housing, wheel wells and so forth,
which if it had remained closed for another day would have
paralyzed all assembly operations in all Chrysler plants in
the country. Injunctions were gotten, naming members of the
Central Staff. ‘Naming Wooten, naming General Baker who was
already on probation for allegedly carrying a concealed I
weapon during the 1966 so called mini riot, the Kerchevel
Street incident as it is referred to. BmN'sought to bust him
for violating the injunction by demonstrating in opposition .

to Chrysler Corporation. They were unsucessful. Ron March

‘was charged 4 and we just completed his trial last month. he

was charged with assault and battery on a police officer from

the tenth precinct. They contended that Ronald march had

nothing better to do when he got off from work but to get in

a marked scout car. We beat that. Hyself a member of the

of_conduct to pursue, if you're about the business of revo-
lutionary change. And that also deals with the question of
Oppression and Repression, because repression is that which
is to be logically expected by a person who perceives you as
a serious threat to the maintenance of conditions which are

beneficial to him. You are to be honored when you find your-

, self as the object of an act of repression, because he.would

,not,rfor a second, consider expending energy in directing it

.-

toward you if you did not, in some minimal way, at least,
represent some threat to the way things are being done in this
country. But, the primary thing-that can be done to prevent
the occurance of repression is for those of us of the oypressed
classes to take over, to take power, to run every god damn
thing in this country. To run everything in this world and

certainly to start out by running everything in_this city.-

_ _So, we say the first responsibility of revolutionary.organ~

izations is to advance and practice a program that is designed
to produce that one and only thing that can bring about an
end to repression and that is take power. How does_the League

ot_Revolutionary Black Workers relate to that? Just briefly,

isome of the things the League of Revolutionary Black Workers

is indeed involved in is organizing black workers because the
League proceeds from the analysis that it is necessary to
humanize the world,~that racism, monopoly capitalism and
imperialism, the institutional structure that is designed to

maintain those three things, be destroyed.- And, we say that

.the_point.of greatest vulnerability of such a system is the

 

-12-

point of production in the economic infra—structure of this
system; So we say that it makes sense to organize workers

inside of the plants to precipitate the maximum'dis1ocation

ahd the maximum paralysis of the operation of the capitalist,

imperialist machine} And that is why we organize workers;'we
do not simply define workers in the orthodox sense of he who

toils laboriously with his hands'oyer a lathe or on the line,

’or in the trim shop or in the frame plant or in the foundry.

We say that all people who don't own and rule and benefit from_

decisions which are made by those who own and rule are workers.

‘That includes black students who are kicked out of schools-

'for example, because these black students understand very

clearly the fact that the instruction that they get is de-I

signed to produce fodder for,-fuel for, the maintenance and

the on—going operation of this economic machine. we understand

in other words, that the productive relations of this society,

~that the way it's organized in terms of its economy deter4“

mines how the educational structure is going to respond to

' it'and we then understand that Northern High School, for

example, and the Northwestern High School for example, are‘

deliberately structured in such a way as to produce potential

’“unempIoyed men during periods of what are euphemistically

referred to as recessions, and/or in the alternative, bloods

can go'to Saigon and die bravely for this country for which

.we have no reason whatsoever for dying. That's what the edu-

zcational system is designed in such a way as to reflect 34;;

cisely what is ordered and what is required to he done hyithe

economic system. We see that relationship. We say that a11

    
   

-13-

  

persons who are oppressed are workers. Whether they are'per¥

mitted‘t6 participate productively in the operation of this sooity

   

society is determined, not by the fact that they are or are not

   

workers, but by the fact that the men who control the means Bf

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

. hroducticn organize them(the means of production) in such a"way
”as to make them unnucessary. And the way that you solye‘that'
problem is to take oyer the total ownership and conplete can;
itrol of those devices of production, so that you have a society
I ytwhere you do not have production for profit but production for the
‘use 8: thdserwho do the producing. We're committed to the devel-
”bpmenti§r‘that kind of society. And we say that you do not de-
"yelope that rind of society necessarily in the joint.’ But ﬁg
understand that there are instances in which cats w111 get ¢rack—
ed and there ain't nothing they can do about it'- they're going
to get yamped on - they're going to be jammed upi- we understand
that; So we organize workers. ‘We also understand that the only
way that you end onpression is notzby circulating petitions; not
by writing letters to the attorney general, isnot paching gal-
leries in the state legislature, is not by denanding meetings on
the third_iloor of Detroit Police Headquarters with whoever the
“black administrative assistant is to the current police comnis-
sioner night be. we say that the only means whereby you do this
is to run the police department, is to run the city. _s6”w§ say

for a second into suggesting ther's an alternative route to

the -
the destruction of the cppressor short of actually having to

destroy him, We donit deceive ourselves. But we don't engage

in superficial discussions between that cat relating to electoral
politics, that bullshitl We relate to whatever's going to give
us the power we need to create and widen the sphere with in which
we can function to bring about the destruction of this country.
We don't engage in bullshit arguments about, that's reformist-
that's not reformist wm what‘s reformist is that which is counter
revolutionary. What is not reformist or what defines what is
counter-revolutionary is any action that conduces to the greater

creation of a larger predisposition on the part of most people'to

view revolution as the only course of conduct available to the

end of oppression. That's what we relate to — that's what we

understand and see very clearly as being real. One of the means

that we begin to approach that is that there has been a bill
passed that proposes to decentralize the Detroit School Syiem —
to create between l and ll regions; to create local, regional
governing bodies that will relate in certain ways to the communi-
tis in which they find themselves and relate in other ways to what
remains a so—called Central Board whose members will be increased_
and son on. We have no illusions about decentralization and

community control being the solution to the problem. We don't

say that community control will end anything; but we do say.

that if that bill, for example, affords an opportunity to

‘organize people around the concept of taking power; that we

"will relate to the bill on that level. And in order to do that,

the West Central Organization, (which is headed by John Watson

a member of the League) has been relating to; having Decentrali-
iation‘Cenferenees and attempting to éé§éi3p'a mechanism to
organize a political machine so that we can take power via what-

ever means is necessary. we understand the need for a theoreti~

cal organ — for a revolutionary organ — for a newspaper for a

means of communication; so we’re making efforts to develop a
high quality press. Weive had some problems — we've printed

the paper— they're persons who have all kinds of views of the
Inner—City Voice— none~the—1ess we keep pushin' it because we
think it‘s a serious revolutionary document. A part from that
the League runs Journalism schools. The League is training young
people to write. In addition to training young people to write,
the League is in the process of establishing printing presses
and printing shops and printing newspapers in four parts of this
country. That's another progam because we understand the need
for an accurate and truthful dissemination of information. What
we say very simply is this » that, yes we can stand up and raise
our hands and we can deolaim mightily about the existence of Hon—
kies —- that Black is Beautiful and we can hang bullets around
our neck and wear all kinds of daisikies but that's not going to
bring about an end to oppression. What really is going to bring
about an end to oppression is doing very serious and very hard
work over a fairly protracted period of time, that is designed
to increase the liklihood of people taking power. And we say
that theLeague represents that kind of organization and we say
that it's important to talk about the League in that connection,
at what is styled a repression conference because we say that

the only means of ending that repression is to take power over

-16..

that system in which you find yourself and that's how we relate

nto the question of repression. _ _”

If there are eny responses, observation on those brief‘

comments — we'll deal with them anyway you want. I'll lay g-

. - P . ;

‘if not, cooit

This is going to be brief. I live here — don't have to
catch a plane so it wasn't too difficult to wait.-.1 just want
to make a couple of observations, hut hefore we make the ob-
servations and I don't think I till be long, what I was going
to 6o?was first of all, remark upon the fact that the program
has no éirection obviously, whatsoever. And that as a result
of the program not having any direction, persons night be tired
from having sat for a fairly long time. And if people are in-
teresteﬁ in taking a break for a brief time we would be haﬁpy I

to accomodate them. On the other hand what.we've got to say

xwon't probably take too long. So what I'd lide to do is_get

some.indication of what people's attituées are. They might_want
to stand us an& stretch in terms of this marathon_instruction

on the foibles of repression. Evidently, people Gon't want to

fget up so let:me be as brief as I can.

u~First of all, I think it is the obligation of persons,
who are a part of political structures that they regard as
being serious political structures, to engage in oriticisn in
the spirit of fraternity, in the spirit of constructive egnpern
for the aocomplishnent of revolutionary objectives. So_it(is in

that spirit that I would want to mahe some observations about

zthegoourse of the conduct of this meeting. That is to say that

whoever set up the meeting, I'u sure'I can't iéentify the
persons who set up the meeting: Newsreel and perhaps3§gme_other

individuals. It’ seems to me they ought to he the subject of

some criticism here, in terms of not making the maximum efficient

-3-

.utilization of the time and the presence of_peop1e here. Now,

I don*t want to compound that by going into an exﬁenuated rap

on the instances of attempts at incarcerationzthat met with no
N I I ‘:

success on the part-of MAN in relation to members of_organ¢

izations that I,ms associated with; What I do want to say is I

don,t see what this program-is all eboutl —And I don't see.

"what we can accomplish within the=context of these protracted

-raps; And I think that there has been a breach of responsi-

bility on the part of people who set up this meeting, and

I think they ought to be criticized for that and they ought

to accept that criticism the spirit.in which-it was intended.p

But if they don‘t « it‘s ! no consequence either, Now, the

position that the League * Revolutionary Black Workers takes in

‘relation to the question ~ repression» since this is styled

as a repression confetwnce,-is that there is but one means where
by a repression can he ended and that is that the source of the
repression, namely the‘oppressor,*be destroyed».

* we don‘t say that idly « we don‘t say that in the familiar

  sense of the nominal black militant who points his ringer and

roundly denodnces Honkies; threatens to decimate the Ehtire

"whité'populatlon of the globe, and stands astride of what re-

'mains and proclaims the intrinsic'beauty'of-hlackness without

relating to"a concrete political program that‘s going to end

‘oppression for-all people in this worldﬁ We say this in all

' seriousness; that there is bnt one solution, that is the des-

‘traction of the present state mechanism; the dismantling or

the present state mechanism and the process-whereby that

K
t
i

; _3__

mantlihg will beabrought about is that those who are seriously

concerned about bringing about revolutionary change will move

ito seize state_power, and what we suggest is the program the

League of Revolutionary Black Workers is that. We say that

for a very simple reason: we express and we feel complete_and
total solidarity with all organizations which relate in a,
revolutionary way to conditions in this country. ,We are con-
cerned about the extent to which they.appgar to be singled
out to have repression visited upon them‘: and to the extent.
that it is possible{ we do all that we can to support members
of other organizations who find themselves subjected in a
specific way to efforts-at repression; for example. we relate
to and defend members of the Republic of New Africa. members,

of the Welfare Rights Organization and indeed we've represented

» and related to members of the Black Panther Party here locally

(as well as other members). But we feel that the principle,

. ; ,

responsibility of persons who are concerned about doing;po1ie

tical work is that they first of all have an obligation to

conduct themselves in such a way as to avoid incarceration’.
because the primary renponsibility of revolutionaries is to

be about the business of doing revolutionary_work. ‘And that.means
that your first responsibility is to do all that is in your_

power to avoid becoming a defense organization. Now there!s:

--,*.-.3’ 1 .

a very interesting phenomanon that is operating here at this.

.~
.'\1,:l

meeting. .One of the things that I was alluding to.when I was=

engaged in my criticisms. See, the first phenomanon is that a

the M Q or the Master of Ceremonies (he who has thehrespon-ﬂ_.

-4-

sibility far this program) is exhibiting a kind of standard

and fairly predictable psycophantic white response; That is,

there are bloods speaking: I am reluctant to exercise any 3

.control over the meeting because they are bloods. What is it?

Is it the cat's into a psychophantic'thing§ Is the cat just"
afraid that he's a blood? Or is it the position that any ut-
terance that is ever made by any blood, at any time is pro-
foundly revolutionary in content and should not be in any

way stifled, stymied, ordered, directed, or organized? We
regard that as being a wholesale abdication of responsibility
to use time efficiently and to use time of other people effi-
ciently. That's one observation that we would want to make in
connection with what we pick up one’ V

The other thing that we pick up on at the meeting like

’this is that we got, you know, all the people here_are basically

local people, live in the metropolitan area, live in the city
of Detroit. Theyire here to relate to what is called a depres-
sion Conference, and the discussion with the exception of the
discussion with Chairman Rob (who presently resides here and.‘

who is the object of an effort at extradition); the discussion

nufrelates to the Jpolitical prisoners" strung out all over

the country. No discussion whatsoever with regard to whatis
going down in Detroit, what's going down in the metropolitan
area and how you relate to that. What does that say? H in.”

There are people here for example who are so unaware cf

what's going down in terms of serious effort at making revolu-

tionary change in this city that when they see1:enterna1'

 

-5-

objects of admiration in relation to what-they perceive as
being revolutionaries; They are forced to canvas the country
and relate to, let us say, New Haven, Fort Hood, Texas, Fort
Jackson, Fort Dix, Milwaukee Fourteen or whatever. We oould
go on, Texas Southern Five, Fort Jackson Eight and so forth.
What they don't realize is that the wholesale murders going
down right here in the city of Detroit, wholesale murders in-

deed going down wherever you find yourself in this country.

" And that there are persons being killed who are not Panthers,

that there are political organizations which are being sub-

jected to attacks which are not Black Panther orgaﬁizatiens

rand we're not suggesting for a second that we have the remo-

“test interest in having these things recognized so that-persons

‘ can say —- well, there's been a fairly impressive list of "

shal1-we say Panther casualities. It becomes the responsibility
oT'other speakers to attempt to match it or perhaps top it}

We're not relating to that. what we're relating to is the:

-responsibility of politically serious people to recognizeor

what"s going down where they find themselves, because that's
where they've got an obligation to do work. 'The reality is
that you ain't in New Haven; that you oannot do a damn thing
for Bobby Seale and you cannot do a damn thing for the Panther
21. ‘You can't do anything for Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.
You can't do anything for David Hillard, but you can do some-

thing where you find yourself, 'That is, you can be about the

‘business'of doing serious revolutionary work. What do I mean

 

by'this? We say that the League of Revolutionary Black Workers

5 .

is_a serious organization with a serious program that has,

been consistently working over the years and we point proudly,

not to the numbers of persons that we have in jail, not to the
.. _. , _ . ‘.. _ ._ i

numbers of persons that we have under indicment.g We point»

proudly to the fact that we have functioned as a serious re-

volutionary organization for years and we have not one man

in jail: We point proudly to that fact, And, we don't say
that_lightly; and we don't say that because we haven't been
subiected to efforts to place us in jail. The last year for
example; has been replete with instances in which efforts

have been made to place members of the League of Revolutionary

Black Workers Central Staff and member organizations in jail

_and we will briefly canvas them for the information of these

who are present. _Member of Central Staff General Gordon_§aker,

_:Ybu see that, I think it is the respcnsibility of persons

engaged in political work to select from their comrades their
herces} _And while I have profound respect for other men in
other organizations, who are brothers who are relating to the
liberation struggle; my principle respect and my undying love
and affection and my primary responsibility and obligation
goes to my comrades in struggle. iPersons with whom I am as~

sociated — those are my heroes and those are the persons f

whose posters I have on my_wall, my brothers. ,And when we talk

‘about my brothers we understand that people in Detroit have

been subjected to efforts at incarceration and what is styled

repression; But the significantly different factor when ypu

begin to look at bloods who are operating in Detroit in_all‘

the organizations, incidently; is the fact that the MAN dces

“;7_

not have them anywhere in jail. Be he RNA, be he eehther, be he
League} be he whatever. None.of them...none of theu.e.none of
‘them[..are in jail and that says something. What does that say?
'lt says, number one, we've got a highly sophisticated black
"community in the city of Detroit and that we relate in such a
way as to make it inpossible for the Run to frame us on jive
chicken shit charges} What do I mean by this?‘ We nean a number
of things For example, there has been discussion; there has been
discussion of people being charged with various kinds of conspi-
racies. There is one thing that nust be understood; when you talk
about people being charged with conspiracies. A conspiracytunder
law is'defined as an agreement between 2 or more persons to per-
pertrate an unlawful act, or an agreement between 5 or more per-
sons to perpertrate a lawful act in an unlawful nanner.’ what

does this mean? This means that the only way you can be cracked
for conspiracy is for one of the parties to the conspiracy

to testify'against you. That's the only way you can be cracked

in a conspiracy. “that does that mean? That means then that you must
he agnember of a political organization that is structured in such r

a way as to nake it possible for your enemy to be in a position to
sit on.a witness stand and plausibly run to the MAN that you_are

I

ha part of.a conspiracy to do some ridiculous thing. we_say that we

do not relate to an organization that permits that_kind of pene-
tration and that is one of the reasons why we have not been i

subjected to eiiorts at conspiracy although there_has‘been.one

effort, that being the Federal drand Jury that_convened in the

city to inyestigate members of the Le
