DENVER——Mine-Mil1’s. lo-
cal unions and the Supreme
Court of the United»States
teamed up last month to de-
liver two powerful blows to

the Taft-Harleyites who
have been spending several

_ years trying to figure out
‘ how to weaken or break up
~ the most decisive union in

the non-ferrous metals industry.

The authors ‘of the Taft-
I-Iartleyl indictments against 14
past and present Mine-Mill offi-
ers and staff members were a
bit bewildered» at year’s end
from two combination punches:

II Mine-Mill local unions from
coast to coast, in a magnificent
display of trade union solidarity,
sent soaring over the top "a
spontaneous bail bond drive that
passed the necessary $65,000
mark and on New Year’s Day
had reached $81,100, with thou-
sands more anticipated within a

A, few days. The “surplus” loans

wil1,.provide a ‘cushion to meet
emergencies that may occur ‘if
any local union has to recall its

loan because of special circum- -
5 -stances?‘ ‘ ‘

, The locals put up the loans to

-replace Inoney advanced by the

International. Union to ‘guaran-
tee the freedom of 13 of the de-
fendants. One indicted former
officer, M. E. Travis, was not
required to post the $5,000 bond
required of the others.

2! ‘The Supreme Court of the
United States held unanimously
that the National Labor Rela-
tions board had no right to rule

that Mine-Mill was not‘ in com-

pliance with the Taft-Hartley

REVEW    

December, I956

 

In every part of the world last month, mankind was engaged
in a gigantic struggle for more freedom, less war, and a higher

9 standard of living. On every page of every newspaper, Ameri-
‘cans could read the signs and portents of a fierce yearning

for democracy. Clashes, shooting, top-level diplomatic missions,

pompous speeches, ultimatums, riots, night arrests, charges and

counter—charges—“—these were the surface manifestations that all

was not right with the world as 1956 drew to a close.

But these werg only bits o.f

evidence. The crux was the de-

mand of humans everywhere for freedom and this demand was
causing.tr~ouble—for_ other humans who didn’t want to grant more

freedom.,

(Universal Action

Moslems rioted and ‘French
soldiers shot them down. Hun-
garian refugees were seeking
haven around the world. ‘Hun-
garian miners were striking.

Egyptians were still demanding
freedom from foreign interfer-
ence. American Negroes were
being shot at and bombed for
riding unsegregated' buses in

the South. Britons were facing"

a bleak economic year. South
Africa was arresting “traitors,”
or citizens who were fighting
racial s e g r e g a t io n. Unrest
gripped Indonesia. Inner tur-
moil assailed many a political
party. A group of American‘
senators was preparing a deter-
mined ‘fight to smash the fili-

buster, historic -weapon of the-

foes of civil rights.

And through it all was woven
an obvious truth———a free labor
movement is necessary for the
floweringof democracy, no mat-
ter what the nation or system of
government. - ’ ‘

The Polish embassy in Wash-

Democracy's, Road

ington announced that Poland's‘

chief labor federation, the Cen-

tral Council of ,Trade Unions,

demanded an independent role
for unions, “denounced bureau-
cratic methods, and set up a pro-
gramfor labor autonomy and
democracy,- improvement of liv-
ing—s‘tandards, and the righting

‘of grievances which had piled
up under the old regime. Reli-'

gious curbs in Poland were re-

moved and the Roman Catholic‘

church" proclaimed its support
of the country’s’ government, a
Communist administration.

6 In this country, retiring U. S.
Senator Herbert H. Lehman (D.
N.Y.) urged organized labor to
assume national’ leadership of
an America which has been
“lulled into a perilous com-
placency.” He said labor could
propose and work for a new

Marshall Plan for Europe ‘and’

the Middle East. At home, the
achievement for full equality
would ‘cure “the cancer of big-
otry and prejudice which af-
flicts us,” he added.

There were other positive signs that man's quest for an ever-
expanding democracy was bearing -fruit. V "
The government’s prosecution of Harvey O’Connor -on con-

tempt of Congress charges blew up when the U. S. Circuit Court
of Appeals. reversed the author’s. conviction for defiance of a sub-
committee headed by U. S. Senator- Joseph McCarthy (R., Wisc.)
——‘(remember him?-). The court overturned the conviction on the
ground that the O’Connor indictment—based on refusal to re-
spond to questions about “Communist conspiracy” membership

‘ -—was too vague, “imprecise and ambiguous.”

A blind minister became pastor of an interracial church in
New York.’ He liked his advantage of not being able to “see the

color of anyone’s skin.” ~.

New York City's helicopter airline hired its first Negro pas-

senger pilot, Percy H. Young.

A vote recount in Denver sent the first Negro in Colorado
history to the state senate. He was George Brown, a Denver

an intensive investigation of charges of “book burning” at Sta-

dium High school. A book which advocated a

osophy triggered the dispute.

And Negroes DID ride UNSEGREGATED in Southern buses.

would have that much ‘money.

of the war crisis” was the main

and food for the presence of ra-

fallout. .

The United Auto Workers’ pa-

U. S. Senator Clinton Ander-

Three Year Contracts Top Big  
News Stories of Past 12Moni-hs

MINE-MILL’S collective bargaining
victories which resulted in historic three-
year’ contracts with the major operators
-in the non-ferrous metals industry topped
the news for Mine-Mill members in 1956.

Wage increases and other benefits won in-

the pacts. had a cash value of $1,500 per
worker. , _ V
1- G Near the top of the list of newsworthy

' events in the union was Min'e-Mill's’ highly

successful election activity which established
the organization as a key political force in
many areas where it has a concentration of
membership. . ﬂ . A 
IMPORTANT EVENTS‘ —
A Any Mine-Mill review of 1956 must include
the following important events: —

 _ The continued and consistentdefeat of the v

Steelworkers and other raiding unions. Most
noteworthy, of course, were the Mine-Mill ‘vic-

_ tories over Steel in Butte, Anaconda, and
Great’ Falls, Mont.;, and over both Steel and

Auto Workers in Torrington, Conn.——all Ana-
conda company operations.

2.. The launching of a three-year organiza-
tional and consolidation program by the Inter-
national‘ Executive board. High point of the
union’s organizational activity during the year
was the winning of a Labor Board election at
the important Magma-owned properties at San
Manuel, Ariz., where Mine-Mill and the tradi-
tional AFL craft unions administered a shut-
out. defeat to the» Steelworkers.

3. The big, unified and enthusiastic 51st con-
vention’ in Salt Lake City .where delegates
hammered out" a bargaining program destined

for» success, as well as charting a carefully- ~

planned political action campaign, outlining
a labor -unity perspective that fully endorsed

the activities in this field by the International ,

Executive board and erecting a civil and labor

» rights program’. A full-scale, battle against

silicosis also was “mounted. _ -

4. The union’s campaign for improved health
and safety conditions in the industry resulted
in Congressional hearings by a subcommittee
of the House Labor and Education committee.
Headed by Rep. Lee Metcalf (D., Mont.), the
subcommittee held several “field”. hearings,

including those in Butte, Mont, and only last i

month held hearings in Washington, -DC., at
which Mine-Mill leaders advanced a compre-
hensive program to cut down silicosis in the
metal mining industry and to reduce accidents
in‘ the industry. I

5. Labor unity continued to be near the top
of the union’s agenda during 1956, with sig-
nificant exploratory discussions between Mine-
-Mill officers and those of other unions being
held. A mutual assistance pact between, Mine-
Mill and the Western Conference of Teamsters
received broad membership support. Most note-
worthy during the year was a growing unity in
the areas where Mine-Mill has considerable
membership. This unity had its beneficial ef-

Mine-Mill’s biggest strike of the year was in
the 1955 bargaining round. It was against the

“16 operators” in the Coeur d’ Alene district of 9, -

move to revoke Senate Rule 22,
which action would wipe out

In his letter to the two sena-

“We are aware of the need

pate in the movement, spon-
. sored by senators of both po-
litical parties, to revoke Sen-
ate Rule 22.

“With the revocation of Sen-
we believe that
there will. be a fair chance for
the enactment of adequate civil
rights legislation.” .

In a‘ bulletin to District 6
local unions, Brother Coleman
said: '

“Civil rights laws often re-
ceive a favorable vote in the
House of Representatives but,
when they appear before the
Senate for consideration, the
southern senators start fili-
bustering and defeat the pro-,
posals without allowing a vote
‘to be taken.” The filibuster‘,
C 081 e m a. n explains, permits

. any senator to talk as long
as he wants to on any sub-
ject before a vote is taken.”

All local unions were urged
to contacttheir senators to
urge their ‘support to get rid

DENVER — Expressing‘ ,. ‘f 
confidence that Mine-Mill of-  
ficers and staff members, in-
dicted for “eonspiracy”"to 
' comply with existing labor
laws, would be vindicated in-

the courts, International

President John Clark called ‘ 

the accusations a “Taft-

Hartley invasion of our, . 
-rights as a union to _carry on
‘ the crusade for- a better life ,

and security of the American
worker and the citizens in gen-
eral.” . y '

Clark's characterization of the
case was contained in a personal

letter which he sent last week . g ‘3-‘
to 60,000 Mine-Mill members in s 

the U. S.

“It is certainly... inspiring to
me and all the officers.” Clark

said, “to see the unsoliciated _  

' support coming in from our
local unionsand from friends
outside the union. The bonds
of these accused brothers are
being posted without any.

ury. This support is a. telling
answer to some who were

quick to spread rumors about ’ ~C

from.” k ’

PRAISES ASSOCIATES
The union president said the

indictments are “against men  1

who have been in the center of

the fight for betterwages, con- ‘ ‘

ditions and the ..welfare of our

membershipand their families; -

against men who have out in
the front in our organization

drives and in the conclusive vic- . it

tories over the Steelworkers and

some other unions in their un- to

ethical raids against..us.

“This has been their assign-
ment, which has been carried
out in the only, way that good

-trade-unionists relations with __

the industry, promoting the se-
curity of our members and their
families. They have helped to

carry the fight in the political 7 e S

field.  They have fought for

world peace and have opposed 
and criticized aggression, wheth- ‘ -
er it be by the Soviet Union or 
any other - nation, and have ,

frankly and forthriglitly upheld
their right to criticize‘ and the

right to civil liberties for all un-.

der our great Constitution.”
NO OTHER POLICIES

Clark declared “there, is not 
a single member of our Inter-" 

national Union who can come
forward and accuse these men
of preaching or advocating any
other policies or of resorting to

subversion or fraud against our»  
in carrying out ~

‘government

“The present

can only be motivated by rem-
nants of hysteria which have

discounted that all V ‘

true citizens hope and pray it‘ ‘ '

TORONTO, Ont.—Secre-
tary-Treasurer _-William
-‘Longridge of the Mine-Mill
in _Canada has announced
-‘that they had been advised-
bytheir union attorney, J.
Sedgwick, Q. C.,‘ that Steel-
workers union intends to go
to the courts to have Mine-
Mill’s, recent certification at
Consolidated Denison set aside.
In addition," the Steelworkers
union are taking an injunction
out against the - officers of
Mine-Mill, in order to prevent
them carrying on negotiations
with the Consolidated Denison
Mines. M . ' ., "
The action of the, Steel union
has aroused the anger of the
Denison workers who see it as
a desperate measure to prevent
Mine-Mill bargaining and ex-
posing the collusive agreements
that‘Steel has made with the
uranium mining operators at
_‘Algom and Pronto mines in the
Blind River area. ‘
, Nels Thibault, Canadian Mine-
Mill President, announced that
bargaining had already com-
menced with the Consolidated
' Denison Mines Ltd., and that it
was the. intention of the Mine-
Mill membership there to con-
tinue negotiations.

 Reverse Position

TORONTO, Ont. —- The Na-
tional Labour Relations Board
at Ottawa, on Dec. 17 in deal-
ing with the application at Bi-
croft Uranium Mines, by the
Steelworkers union, directed
that a vote be held with the
Steelworkers on the ballot.

The’ Board’s decision was a
~.complete reversal of their
earlier decision at Consoli-
dated Denison Mines where
Steel had been rejected be-
cause of their failure to live
up to Rule 15 of the Board’s
regulations—namely—that. an
amount equal to at least one
, month’s dues be collected. At
both Denison and Bicroft
Steel had collected a nominal
one dollar fee in place of their
regular five dollar dues.

The Board however, in seek-
ing to justify their change in
position, stated that because the
practice of collecting one dollar
fee had existed, it thereby_ be-

came” an established practice
within the constitutional frame-'

an attempt to intimidate the
workers. The Mine-Mill cam-

EL PASO, Tex.—About_ a

‘decade ago, El Paso mem-

bers of Mine-Mill won a
strike and received wage in-
creases of 181/; to 26 cents
an, hour. The daily press

V -greeted this accomplishment
_- withfheadlines to the effect
that a “revolution” was tak-

ing place on the border.
, Last month, the rich and

. fruitful history of Mine-Mill in-
this Texas city on the Rio.

Grande was "recalled in vivid
terms by shop stewards and lo-
cal and international union offi-
cers who spoke at a special
meeting of the El Paso Mine-
Mill council. Originally sched-
uled as a strictly business meet-

problems, the conference was
transformed by rank - and - file
speakers into ‘a tribute to inter-
nati'onal officers and staff mem-
bers now under indictment on
charges of “conspiring” to have
Mine-Mill comply with the Taft-

Two of the indicted leaders,

It was President Juan Arandaz

the theme of the meeting with

9 an outstanding speech which re-

called many decisive accomplish-

who wereattending. “We are
meeting tonight to honor the of-

’ ficers of our great union,”. he

said; V“we must keep our eyes
open and be on guard against

"President L. Franceware of

HEAR -PEZZATI

‘ The main speaker of the eve-
ning was Secretary-Treasurer

Pezzati who reported at length.

on the indictments and the
events which led to them. In
reviewing p’r e V i o u s attacks
against the union,’ he reminded
the members of the Taft-Hart-
ley injunction in the 1951 strike,
the 1952 McCarran. hearings, the
unsuccessful Labor Board at-
tempt in 1955 to wipe out the

.union’s compliance with Taft-

Hartley, and the Brownell-But-
ler petition issued in the midst

of the 1955 strike. Just as all of 
these p r ev i o-u s attempts to i

weaken the union ‘had failed, he
said, so would this newest at-
tempt—the use of the discredit-

ed “conspiracy” charge, resur-

rected from another century. If
District-2 support of the indicted
leaders is any example, he said,
the union will emerge victorious
in this latest fight to preserve
democratic ‘unionism from the

' inroads of the Taft-Hartley law.

' A social followed the meeting.
Council officers agreed to call
more frequent meetings in or-

der to speed up the carrying out -

of the international union pro-
gram laid down by the Execu-
tive Board. Particular emphasis
will be placed on political ac-
tion, Board Member Chavez
said, referring specifically to a
campaign headed by Business
Agent Alfredo Montoya, to in-
crease the registration of voters
under the Texas poll tax law.

lAPAIace to Protect Union

‘_  the union signed agreements for a three-year

period with the major mining corporations, we knew we
were running certain risks. One was that of relaxing to
‘the point of stagnation, and the ‘other was that the com-

panies might seek to takeadvantage of the long, agree-

mentto whittle away our contract guarantees and to soften
us up as a union on the job every day of the year.

5 There never was any real danger of the first thing
happening, even though a few people might have thought
we would lock the union doors and go fishing. If they did, the

’ Department of Justice provided a rude awakening with its recent

l, Taft-I-I-artley “conspiracy” indictment. Then, just to make sure

we would stay awake, the Subversive Activities Control board
scheduled its hearing on the Brownell-Butler petition for _Feb-

V‘ ruary 4. This, as Business Week: put it, is indeed a technique of

“Try, Try Again.” A

The legal actions brought against the Union are part and
-parcel of the second danger mentioned before, that of softening
up_ the Union during the course of the three-year agreements.

No-_'Love Lost

It is no secret that the copper industry has never loved this
Union, and there are nearly seventy years of bloody and violent

history to prove" its lack of love for this organization of miners,.

A millmen and smeltermen. A
If the companies sat down with us last May and June to
negotiate peaceful,» long-term agreements, it was not because‘
they had begunto love this union, it ,was because they had
learned to respect its strength, unity. and determination of
the entire membership, and the ability of its leaders to win
. the union’s objectives in negotiations.   _

A This does not mean that they are reconciled to such a union
as ours, any more than they were in the 1890s or the 19305. The
evidence shows that they would like it very much if we would
just go fishing. . . - - A -

‘After the agreements were signed, the. International Execu-
tivé board announceda program to consolidate the union’s, posi-
tion during the ‘three-year period, Well, two can play-that kind
of game The companies. would also like to consolidate their

50 You Think You Can See! 

Simple Tests Prove High Speeds Cut Downjir

 

Actual Vision of Automobile Drivers

When you are hitting it up
in your car at 60 miles per hour,
how well can you see?

Why, I can see all right, you
say. The road stretches ahead
perfectly clear. You spot the
cars, trucks, curves and bridges
without difficulty.

But what else do you see? It
may surprise you to know that
the narrow strip of road is just
about all that you can see,
traveling at that rate, says the
Better Vision institute. -

The factor of vision has
scarcely been touched in the
mad search for the causes and
prevention of road accidents,
which caused 38,300 deaths and
11/2 million non-fatal" injuries in
1955.

TEST ' ' -

Here is the simplestA kind
of test. At a crossroad is a
post bearing half a dozen
names of towns and villages,
one above the other. How
many of the names can you
read at 60 m.p.h.‘? ‘You. have
remarkably «good eyes if you
can “grab” even the top one.
The others are a mere blur.‘

 

At the next road crossing,
drop down to 40 and you can
probably read at- least two of
the names. At 30 you may take
in three or four. ’

That proves beyond a doubt
that one part of your vision
goes to "pieces at high speeds.
It is» the part which includes
objects flashing past you at the
sides of the road.

Why does this break-down of
vision take place? It may be
because the eye, like a camera
lens, just can’t work fast
enough to capture a speeding
object. Or it ‘may be that the
eye registers the image all
right, but the brain, which
really does our -seeing, can't
recognize or distinguish the
images formed by the eye.

Here is another way of mak-
ing the test. Look straight out
of the side window at the scen-
ery. Well, you seem to see that
all right! Trees, houses, ani-
mals, all are distinct.

But they are only distinct be-
cause unconsciously you let
your eyes travel, backwards
with each flying object for a

 

fraction of a second, as you‘ ,7;
fix on it. That gives time__ior ;

recognition. If you doubt -this_,».

try looking out of the window

WASHINGTON, D. C. — With

thoroughly documented facts and '

figures depicting the tragic con-
tinuance of deaths in‘ America’s
metals mines and smelters from
needless accidents and industrial
diseases such as silicosis, witnesses
for the International Union of
Mine, Mill. and Smelter Workers
went before the House labor sub-
committee investigating mine

safety, Dec. 4, and won high praise '

for the force and. value of their
presentations.

Rep; Lee Metcalf (D., Mont.),
chairman of the subcommittee,.
said _“'I know that all the members
of the subcommittee have gained
a good deal of benefit and informa-
tion. from your testimony (Vice
President Larso-n.’s) and that of Mr.
Stern (Resea:rch Director Bernard
Stern). ‘V‘\‘/'12 thank you for Coming to
us with very well prepared-. and very
well’ documented testimony.”

Metcalf and other members of the
subcommittee inclu.di.ng, particularly,
Rep. Carl Elliott (D. Ala.) and Rep.
John J. Rhodes (R. Ariz.) were equally

__ emphatic in. expressing their appre-

ciation for testimony of the other
l\.fiine-Mill wiiznesses, Secretary-Treas-
urer Albert Pezzati and Board Mem-
bers Chase Powers and Ernest Salva-s.
So ffH’(:(%ff3’-‘fl was the testimony of
the Min-e, ll-’i~%il‘wii:nesses and so well:
was it ieccirvz-‘zilr that there was gen-
eral expo-ctatioan that a ' favorable
Jregport will be issued when the bear-
ings  printed before the end of
t-he year. It was betieved the enthu-
sias.m_ will carry over" to the ‘next’
ssessiion of Congress which begins
Jan. 3, and that action on bills to
impi-ove the inspection and report-
‘ ing service of the Bursa-in of _Mines-
will be taken. ,
. THE rnoeneozt
Details of the testimony by Mine-
Mill witnesses are" printed elsewhere
in this supplement. Each underscored
the union’s. program which calls for
~ (1) passage of a federal inspection act
for metal mines, (2) establishment-of
a Na=1:io'nal Industrial I-Iealth-"institute-
in the Public Health service similar
to the already existing National Cancer

, -‘institute, National Heart institute and

others, (3) a program of joint‘ surveys
of the health and woriringfenvironment
of ‘metal mines, smelters and refin-
eries by the U. S. Public Health serv-
ice, U. S. Bureau of l‘-;’Ii'nes1 and the ap-

 -propriate ‘health agencies in» all the

key metal producing areas ‘in the

United“ States «and, (4) general promo-_

tion of state compensation laws. through
passage of a'- bill such as H. R. 2ﬁ22
in-trod-‘uced by Rep. Metcalf. 

A major point of interest in the
hearings: was: the recent ‘study on- sili-

“Cites Montana Figures  

 To Urge-Metal Mine Law

 Following are e:x:certs' from the testi-
mony of Board‘Me'mber Ernest Salvas
(District 1) before the House subcom-
mittee in field hearings last September

, in Butte, .Mo’nt. They are, printed in
this’ supplement to help complete the 3

picture of Mine-Mill’s program:

.' The series of hearings on which
your committee has embarked offers

- the first opportunity -for a discussion, _
- before a Congressional committee, of

the very serious problem of silicosis
in nearly 20. years. It was just that
long ago when another House Labor
Sub-Committee focused nation-wide at-

I . tention on the frightful toll of human

lives taken by silicosis during the
building of a tunnel in Gauley, West

» Virginia. Those hearings created a

broad public interest in the subject
that ultimately did bring correction of
some of the worst conditions in this
and other industries.

Similarly, so far asvwe have been
able to determine, these hearings are

" the first public examination by any

federal agency into the health con-
ditions of miners -in this area since
1921, when the Bureau of Mines con-
ducted a health survey. We also be-

lieve it is the very first time a Con: 7
' ‘gressional
= concerned itself with the safety prob-

Committee has publicily

lern in non-coal mines. - _.

‘ Our 'industry—’—the non-ferrous’ met-
als industry—is unusually hazardous.
It‘ is - especially so in- underground
mining, but, as later’ testimony will
show, there .are-.also many unusual
hazards for workers engaged in the
smelting andrefining of ores.

Unfortunately, the many thousands
who are incapacitated and are ulti-
mately killed by dust diseases never
make the headlines—which is prob-

ably one reason Why public opinion‘

has not brought about more effective
control and reduction of dust hazards.
The most common dust disease is
silicosis, caused by the inhalation of
excessive amounts" of silica dust.
MONTANA ’ 5

We have had in Montana, since July
1941, a law under which fully disabled
‘silicotics who are unable to engage in
any manual, labor, receive public wel-
fare benefits. These benefits, after
several successive increases, now
amount to $65.00 a month‘. From‘ rec-
ords of the Montana Department of
Public Welfare, we- have prepared a
chart showing the number of persons
-receiving such benefits as of. June 30
in each‘ of the years since the Act has
been in operation.’

-The figures, it should-‘be noted, are

 ‘not exact averages, but furnish a

  

fairly. reliable indication of -the trend

’  silicotic benefit payments. From

June 30th, 1947 until the past June
30th, the number of recipients has
only fallen below 600. The average
number during this period———so far as
we can estimate it’—-has varied be-
tween 600 and 625, despite an annual
turnover (according to the Depart-
ment of Public Welfart) of from 90

to 100 cases. .

.That we'submit——in a state,’ in which

average metal mine employment for-'

this period "has varied between seven

and eight and a half thousand—is, by,_

any standard; a lot of silicosis. .

The number of recipients of bene-
fits is by no means the total picture
on.the amount of silicosis that exists
in Montana. The eligibility require-
ments for receiving benefits,’ which_is
entirely apart from compensation, is

ten years’ residence" and total djsabil-.

ity. There aremany silicotics who can-

not meet the" ten years’ residence re-
' quirement.

We have contended, for many years,
that federal inspection of metal mines
——such as is proposed in~the specific
bills before this —committee—is -one of

the very necessary steps required for

reducing the dust hazard. _

We know that as these bills, are
-not written, there is no requirement
of compulsory .compliance with
either the code or the recommenda-
tions of a federal inspector. We__'be- '
lieve, as experience with coal mine
inspection’ laws has shown——that a
compulsory compliance requirement A
would be far more effective". As con-
trasted with the present situation,
however, we strongly believe the
proposed code would stimulate
greater effort in the elimination of
dust ‘producing practices. 7

’ “ ACCIDENTS

The situation on accidents in Mon-
tana metal mines is far from good.
Its most alarming aspect is the sharp
increase in the rate of fatal accidents
over recent years. “

Available accident figures of the‘
past four years show I that, on the
average in any one year—— -

One out of every seven workers em-
ployed has suffered some injury on
the job. ‘ i ._

One out of every 59 workers em-
ployed has suffered some permanent
injury on the job.

One out of every 386 workers em-
ployed has suffered a fatal injury on
the job. ,

There are some industries . in the
State that show a higher number of
total injuries. Over a long period of

years however, metal mining has con- ‘

sistently ranked first among all in-
dustries ln both the number and

 

ate 1
of permanent injuries and fatalities, , »

‘THE pMm£.Mn.I. union

Board Member. Powers:

Following are eoccerts from the testi-
mony _of' Board M ember" Chase Powers
(D'l8t?‘tQt 7’) before the Metcalf subcom-
mittee in Washington, D. C’. on Dec. 4:

The Idaho mining industry provides
a prime example of the need for fed-
eral legislation to protect thehealth
and safety of those whose toil pro-
duces the metals that are_so essential
to our economy. Idaho, by its long and
sometimes stormy record as a leading

producer of metals," would necessarily
occupy a prominent chapter inany his-
tory of the U. S._. mining industry.
Idaho would also occupy an even more
prominent chapter in any realistic his-
tory concerned with health and safety
in the industry. ' '

,1 We don’t deny that some progress.
‘has been made. There has, for ex-

ample,’ been a steady decline in both
the -frequency and severity of , acci-
dents in Idaho metal mining for the
past ‘several years. After such steady
progress; however, bothpthe frequency
and severity rates are still several
times as high as those for the industry
as a whole. ‘
LEAD POISONING

Lead poisoning, we are told, is at _

thing of the past in American industry.
The experts tell us that lead poisoning
is no longer a serious industrial men-
ace, but in Idaho-—despite the difficul-
ties involved in securing accurate.in—
‘formation —— we know that in recent
years, in the one lead smelter in the
state, there has been a persistent and
-alarming increase in the known cases
of lead poisoning. So far this year,
there have been nearly twice as many
compensation claims for lead poison-
ing as in all of last year. The number
of claims filed in the first ten months
of this year exceeds by nearly 40 per
cent the total of all such claims filed
in the eight-year, period from 1947
through 1954., _

A The persistence of such conditions

‘and the recurrences of industrial dis-
cases that have beenmostly eliminated

in other sections of the industry, clear-
ly demonstrates the need for more ade-

quate inspection and enforcement of ‘

standards. The state agencies alone,
we believe, cannot do the job. We don’t

for a moment question the sincerity of-
"those very few state agents responsi-

ble for the inspection of operations
and enforcement of state standards.
The plain. fact is that‘ they have neither
the staff, facilities, nor powers neces-
sary for the job. A federal _mine inspec-

tion‘ act for non-‘coal mines——such as 

that called for in the five similarbills

presented in‘the last session of Con--

gress (HR 9269, 9294, 9343, 11376 and
11997) —— would enable existing state
agents to receive much needed assist-
ance from. able andexpert federal in-
espctors. 2-Federal aid in this field need

ACCIDENT RECORDS _ ,
The accident records show that there -
has been some reduction in Idaho mm; ff 1'
ing accident rates, but also thatthé 
situation is still very serious.  ’: 9 ‘
Since 1952, the Idaho Miningjnspec-I
tor has used the “American Standard 
Method of Recording and Measuring’. j’_ 
Work Injury’ Experience’ in comput-“  .
ing accident figures. The originalfig-(_ " -2 ».
ures from which the totals are com-_  ~ ]
piled are secured on a voluntarybasis‘ . 2
from cooperating companies. The final  
annual figures for the period fromif :
1952 through 1955' (the latest avail-
able) were secured from the. Idaho“
Mining Inspector's office and are ; 1 ,
shown——for mining operations in our ,.~ 
exhibit. . 1 c __ _ __  .
There has been, it will. be, noted," a 1':  r
consistent drop "in the frequency rate;  -
of accidents (number of accidents ‘per . 
million man-hours) in underground  . 
mines over these years. The rate for ‘
open pit mines, after rising sharply in" 
1953, dropped slig h tl y in ’54, and "_' 
showed 3. much bigger drop in '55.. » ‘ * 7
These figures still give no’ great  i 
cause for rejoicing. The frequency rate "
for underground and open pit mines—— - .
for the lastthree-year period——was still , I I '
nearly five times the national average 9‘ f '_ -
for the industry. ’ . ’ . 7*
Similarly, the severity rates ‘for ~
both types of "mining operations, as
shown in our exhibit, greatiy exceed-
ed the national average. Although -
-there were--as can be seen in our’. 2
exhibit -.- many fewer underground
accidents in 1955 than'i-:1 1952, they
were obviously of a more serious na-: .
ture. The total time lost, from’ all  , " V7
underground injuries, as shown in”  '3
- the severity rate for 1955, was higher 5 A
than in any of the preceding years.

“I don’t think that We can ask _,the - "
workers in this industry in Idaho to be ‘
satisfied with a few less deaths ora 
few lessvkmaimed and crippled lives, 
when, as happened last year, one out
of -every six workers in the industry
suffered some form of injury——with-an
average time loss per injury of over
105 days. ‘ ,

Dec. 4 at which Mine-Mill witnesses were the only ones heard: “I would.
like to make a general statement concerning the quality of the testimony
we have had today. I think it has been excellent and I think we owe_ quite
a debt of gratitude to the Mine, Mill and Smelter people for coming before
us with the facts and figures that they have.”

-REP. LEE METCALF -(D. Mont.), chairman‘ of the subcommittee, at
the conclusion of testimonyby Vice President Orville Earson and’presen-
tation of charts and tables by Research Director Bernard Stern: “I know
that all the members of the subcommittee have gained a good deal of benefit
and information from your testimony and that of Mr. Stern. We thank you
for coming to us with the very well-prepared _and very well-documented.

REP. CARL ‘ELLIOTT (D. Ala.) ' during a discussion of the testimony
Dec. 4, “I would like to say that I appreciate’ the very fine and very well-
developed facts and information" that you. brought to the committee. I
think that your testimony has'been "very helpful.”

Perhaps the most meaningful compliments came the next day when
representatives of the employers had the floor. For instance, Rep. Rhodes
said, “I think that from the testimony of the union yesterday, at_least,

0' (Mine, Mill was the only union which testified on the day to which he re-

ferred) they are certainly willing to go along and cooperate with almost
anybody who is interested in safety."’ 4 . ' .

Rhodes was answering an assertion by the American Mining congress
to the effect that passage of legislation, giving the Bureau of Mines the
right to inspect mines, would endanger the cooperation that already exists
between workers and management. - ‘ V

Chairman Metcalf frequently cited Mine-Mill testimony. The chairman
particularly emphasized the statement by Chase Powers on mining acci-
dents in Idaho and the outbreak of a sudden and terrible flareup of lead
poisoning in an Idaho smelter. V-‘After Schwab, one Idaho employer empha-

sized the decline in mining accidents in Idaho. Metcalf won the admission ,

tell the story.“ Even so,— the absence
of any real information has not de-
terred many so-called experts from is-
suing statements, _of which there ,are
many,;to the effect that silicosis is no
longer the problem that it once was.
Many of these delusions, we believe,
‘can now be set‘at rest by an excellent
study recently completed by the U.S.

Public Health Service. A report of this

study appears in a paper by’Victoria

M. Trasko of. the Occupational Health .

Field Headquarters, U.S. Public Health
Service——“Sorne Facts on the Pre-
valence of Silicosis in the United
States”—in the October 1956.issue of
the A.M.A. Archives of Industrial
Health. A " '

This committee will certainly want
a copy of that paper as part of the
record. If it has not already been of-
fered for the record,’ we should like
now to dose. '

Basing her study mainly on rec-
ords of workmen’s I compensation
agencies, Miss Trasko found 10,362
cases of» silicosis in. a. five-year pe-

. riod, 1950-1954,‘ that have been com-
pensated or reported in one form ‘-

or another--_ln 22 states. ‘As she flier-

‘ self concludes—-“This is ‘a lot. of "
- silicosis’ for these times.” — " 
Without attempting to repeat Miss  5
Trasko’s findings in full, we would 0
like to emphasize certain of her find- :
to beef great ’_.

ings that appear to us
significance: - ~

I  The 10,362 cases on which informa-V 0

tion was gathered “are obviously an

understatement of the real situation.” "

2, The mining industry, —— including

 

 

 

coal, metal, non-metallic and mixed, 

contributed the . 1 a r g e s t number of 7

cases"—'”—“a total of 6,755 cases, or 66.6%

of all cases on which industry infor- ,  .,

mation was available. _
In proportion to size of ‘the’ work

force, the non-coal mining group -had  , 

the largest, relative number of _sili- ~ 5
cotics from non-coal mining industries, V7 ' A

as_ compared with 4,079 from coal:

number working in, these different , g _,

branches. of mining (according to the

Jtuted 1.72% of the total work force, "

whereas the 4,079 coal miners made up
1.13% of that total work force.

3. Silicosis is still developing, the
study found, among “younger men=

with ‘recent and short exposure to
dust,” although most of the cases ap-
peared to be the result of exposure
prior to 1935. .
CONFIRMED . .
We can confirm Miss Trasko’s ob-

servations that these cases ‘‘are‘’ ob?
viously an understatement of the real _‘

situation.” Figures which we secured .. 

from the Arizona Industrial Commis-
sion in my home state, and which are

contained in our exhibit ‘show that in_

this same five-year period covered 0

by her study, 59 silicosis claims were
compensated (the. number reported

for Arizona in her paper). In addition.

We found 38 claims which were not

compensated because, although sili-

cosis was present, the claimantsfailed
to meet the five years exposure in
Arizona requirement. Many .more in
Arizona (the exact number could‘ not

be secured)‘ are disqualified because

they are not considered “totally dis-
abled," and it’ would be reasonable to
assume that many other silicotics, "be-
cause of these many restrictions and

the difficulties encountered in secur- ‘

ing compensation, do not even file
claims. These ‘facts underscore the
fact that any study based» on compen-
sation records can at best be merely
suggestive, and points up the .need for
a more comprehensive and more exact
detailing of the true situation.
The unrealistic character of these
numerous restrictions on payment
of compensation for silicosis ._ has
been proven a thousand times, and,
‘yet they remain in nearly all state-
compensation laws. Their sole» pur-
pose. appears to ‘be to enable com-

Tens Mine-Mill

Health Safety
  Plan -at Capital

Following are eaccerts from the testi-
mony of Secretary-Treasurelr
Peezati before the Metcalf subcom-
mittee on Dec. 1, in Washington, D. 0.:

The means for preventing or con-
trolling the dust which causes silicosis

-have been known for many years, but

as the facts presented by Mr. Larson
demonstrate, they have not been em-

, played to the degree necessary to cur-
‘ ,_ tail the menace. One of the most) im-
portant provision of_ these bills—-in our

view—is the proposal to create an in-
dustry-labor committee of six members

which, among other duties, would be

responsible‘ for promulgating a code of
reasonable standards pertaining‘ to
safety and health conditions. This code
would be used as a guide forqmaking

-recommendations under this Act and

presumably, would also serve. as a
yardstick by which federal inspectors

would evaluate. dust and ventilation-

conditions in all mines.

One of -our major gripes is that
those who work in what has long been

‘ recognized as one of the most danger-
ous industries in the country are de-

nied those significant facts which are
necessary_ if an ‘ adequate corrective

‘program is to be formulated. We’re
- , not assessing responsibility for this_

situation‘ against the U. S. Bureau of
Mines which, as the agency responsible
for collecting assessment facts appears
tobe doing the best that it can within
limits imposed by the funds appropri-

ated by Congress. Perhaps this situa-

tion'is not contrary to the interests of
the American Mining‘ Congress which

. has been consistently opposed to Fed-

eral regulation of Vmine safety.
0 Lest our criticism seem pica-
yune, let me point out t_hat*what
' we are asking, for in the way of
statistical information is precisely
the kind of information we once
got from the Bureau of Mines.

There has been a serious deteri-

oration in the accident information

prepared by this agency.

The Bureau’s reports on coal mining
accidents are far superior to what it
isues on metal ‘mining. The informa-
tion on coal mining is current, compre-
hensive and detailed. Unlike metal min-
ing——where only annual eanvasses are
conducted——coal mine accident reports
are issued on a monthly as well as an-

nual basis. These reports contain data

on cause, agency, frequency of fatali-
ties, non-fatal injury experience and
other pertinent data.

HAZARDS

Passage of a mine inspection act for
metal mining would bring about that

minimum degree of “governmental su- I

ously required. »

edition of Accident Facts, issued by the
National Safety Council. This is a pri-
vate organization which secures its in-
formation from some 9,300 (in 1955)
cooperating companies. Their figures
on the category “Mining, Other than
Underground Coal” are, based on re-
ports from 358 reporting units.

I am presenting this chart of the .

National Safety Council as my first
exhibit. The committee will note that
“Mining, Other than Coal” had the
fourth highest frequency rate and the
second highest severity rate of the 40
different industry categories for which
figures are shown. -

The “Mining, Other than Coal”
group ‘had a frequency rate about
three times that of “all industries”
and a severity rate about 41,/sitimes
the “all-industries” figure. 3
When we examine similar annual

charts preparedby the National Safety
Council for many years back, we find
a similar pattern with only slight vari-
ations in the relative spot occupied by

this-industry. Invariably, according to T

this source, metal‘ mining ranks among
the most hazardous of all industries.

MINE-MILL PROGRAM

This is the program which our union
has been urging for several years. In
brief, it calls for—in addition to the en-
actment of a Federal Mine Inspection
Act——the following federal actions:

II Establishment of a National In-
dustrial Health Institute in the Public
Health Service, similar to the already)
existing" National Cancer Institute, Na-
tional Heart Institute, and others.

2-1 -A program of joint surveys of the
health and working. environment of
metal mines, smelters and refineries
by the U. S. Public Health Service, the
U. S. Bureau of Mines, and the appro-
priate state health agencies in all the
key metal producing areas of the
.United States. What we have in mind
is the kind of study that was last done
in Utah in 1939, the results_of which
appeared in a report, Working En-
vironment and the Health of ‘Workers
in Bituminous Coal Mines, N on-Fer-
rous Metal Mines and Non-Ferrous
Metal Smelters in‘Utah, 1940. C ’

ing the problem. Even where we have
made gains, the effect. is frequently
to give an unfair advantage to opera-
tors in other states, the laws of which
are more lenient and do not require
similar standards. In the meantime,
men are being maimed and are dying

THEV MINE-MILL UNION -

Pligizf of the Agged

..,. Moisl‘ Americans Over 65 Have No
 Pay or $1,000 or Less Yearly      

. TAMERICA is a land of plenty, truly‘—but not
 if you’re over 65 years of age.

Nearly three quarters of Americans beyond

 . 65. either have no income of their own—or earn
 _less than -$1,O0O_V_a year. And you know how
' i ;,_1_,_we1l you can live on less than $20 a week.

_ There are signs of betterment on the hori-
zon. Both political parties advocate higher So-

~ .  , _cial Security benefits and there are indications

fI.;.that adequate care ‘for our older people will -
—,.be less;-and ‘less a burden on our economic
.. system." - ‘ -

 Nevertheless, among our rapidly increas-
ing’ population over 65, 36 per cent have no

income whatever, 38 per cent have less than ’

$1,000, while 11 per cent have an income
between $1,000 and $2,000. In many cases,
these incomes must do not only for the in-
dividual. earning the money—but often sup-
-port a spouse and other members of the
family. Only‘ 15 per cent of theoldsters over
65‘ earn or receive more than $2,000 a year.
0 A ELDERS INCREASING
» .. This is a summary from a comprehensive

report made by John J. Corson, a former di- 

rector of the Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors’

0 Insurance, and John W. McConnell, professor

at Cornell university. The findings have been

 published in a voluminous text of 533 pages
. published by the Twentieth Century fund, a

nonprofit foundationfor research on economic

 and social problems. . A

Older persons in our population ‘(those

’ cover 65) are steadily «increasing not only in

"number, but in proportion to our total popula-

'. non. Since 1900, the number of persons 65 and

over haséincreased four times while the total

 ,5 ‘population has only ‘doubled. The over-65s now
V number over 14 million. .

The report notes that unemployment -is at"

5 - a minimum" from ages, 35 to 44, rising gradu-
~ ally between 45 and 64. At age 65 there is a‘

marked increase in unemployment. And, once

‘ "tinemployed, older workers find it difficult

-to secure’ new jobs. _ .

The report of a special committee, under
the auspices of the Twentieth Century fund,
sets forth a program to meet the problems of
economic security» faced by the older people
today. , "

In addition to increased benefits under the
present federal social security system, the com-

employed persons.
One central finding of the new Twenteth

65s are increasing twice as fast as the general
population and despite the increased benefits
recommended, the study suggests that the bur-
den on the rest of the population will decrease
rather than increase. There are several reasons
for this.

In the first place, older persons are simply
one element in the total nonworking popula-

sons and others are included in the total non-
working segment. And this total nonworking
group is growing proportionately smaller rath-
er than larger. Adding it up, this means that
for the future we can take better"'care of our
older people because we can afford to. 5
(Edz'tor’s Note: Labor unions, such as Mine-
Mill, through negotiation of pension plans,

have made great strides in helping older work- »

ers and their wives live out their remaining

years with some semblance of financial se- ~

curity.) »

On the basis "of the Twentieth Century fund 0‘

study, observers are generally agreed that to
avoid the hazards of a dependent old age, an
individual can set up his own program. They

Vice-President

 

Larson Says Safe!
dﬂearings Point Way

  

Mine-Mill had its day in court last month before
the House Labor subcommittee on Mine Safety and
Health in Washington. We presented a good case——-
judging from the comments of Congressmen on the
committee and of persons in the audience, but we
haven’t yet won that case. We built a record on the
need for federal action in this field——a lot more work

will be required in order to get that action. T
Less than 100,000 workers are employed in metal 0

mining. As industries go, that’s a ‘relatively small

. work force. Let "those 100,000 workers, or any substantial
- . part of them,
.—for any reason—and the industrial life of this ‘country

cease work for any length. of time-
would soon‘ come to a halt. That would sure grab the head-\
lines; these same newspapers, however, don’t regard as
newsworthy the fact that -this same work force of this
same vital industry is being daily menaced by occupational

‘ diseases and accidents that, in the long run, can be more

devastating. than any industry-wide strike or natural "catas-

~ trophe.

This is what we attempted to point out to the commit-
tee. We told th_em—“unless some action is taken to sharply
reduce the hazards, our ability to recruit. the necessary
manpower to ' produce ,essential metals will be severely
limited.”_ 0 -

Public Health Study

A U. S. Public Health Service study—-introduced ‘into '

the record of the hearings——f0und some 10,362 cases of
silicosis in 22‘ states in the five years, 1950-54. Two-thirds
of -these cases came from mining industries, with the larg- 5
est number——in relation to size of work force—from metal
mining. The studyitself makes the point that because of
the" lack of comprehensive records, the 10,362 cases ‘_‘are
obviously an understatement of the real situation.” It
further notes that “This is ‘a lot of silicosis’ for these times.”

These are just some of the grim facts brought out at

_the hearings. Only’ a few newspapers thought them im-

portant enough to even have reporters present. The Scripps-
Howard papers didn’t have a reporter present nor, appar-

ently, did they even bother to find. out what went on at _

the hearings. None of that was necessary for them to dis-
cover another “communist” plot in these proceedings.

" Under a 'Washington dateline, their'El Paso paper car-
ried a “dope” story stating, in effect,.that wewere attempt-
ing to—build _up a silicosis scare inorder to-divert attention
from the indictment of 14 Mine-Mill leaders.‘ In the face
of this U. S. Public Health Service study showing that
silicosis is still a very serious, problem, they quoted some
unnamed official who allegedly claimed that we were de- 0
liberately exaggerating the situation. Anyone, it seems, by
disregarding facts, can prove almost anything.

Silicosis Among Cowboys-

The American Mining congress, as was to be expected,
opposed the proposed federal inspection of metal mines.‘
One of their witnesses—with a straight face——informed the

L committee that Arizona farmers and cowboys “encounter

considerably more hazardous dust conditions than under-
ground miners.” _ ,
Another Mining congress witness, C. E. Schwab of.

-Bunker Hill, while opposing any new federal legislation,

did concede—-under qucstioningby Congressman Metcalf—
that there was no cause for complacency in the accident
andoccupational disease record of the industry. He’ also
urged larger appropriations for both the U. S. Bureau of
Mines and the Public Health Service to enable them to carry
out an expanded program of research_and education.

. _ « That was the one significant point on which we found
ourselves in agreement. While urging the subcommittee to
recommend new legislation, we also stressed the need for
increased activity by both of these federal agencies. We
specifically urged that sufficient money be appropriated to
enable them to undertake joint surveys—together with the
appropriate state agencies—-of the health and working en- -
vironment of metal mines, smelters and refineries in key

V areas of the industry. .

The last such joint survey was made in Utah in 1939.
Similar - studies today—we told the committee—would re-‘
veal valuable information on occupational diseases in this
industry. All of us would then be in a better position to
judge the effectiveness of present control measures, and to

know where further steps should be taken.

Agencies Already Exist-

These surveys don’t require any new legislation. They,

- can be done by existing agencies with only a little more

staff and money. All of us should make that clear to our’
Congressmen. VV2 should also urge .our state legislators
and state health agencies to exert their influence to get
these surveys made."

We’re going to have to use,a many-sided approach to
health and safety ll this industry. We don’t intend to
slacken in our campaign for federal legislation. At the same
time, we should be making maximum use of those agencies
already ‘working in this field. Nor should we, for one mo-

.ment_, relax our efforts in state legislatures to get some
., more adequate compensation and safety lawspassed.

Our campaign‘-for health‘ and safety legislation, as we
told the committee, is a fightto save human 1i'v,es.=-There is

no, more important taskfacing this union.,We'int_end to give _ 

5 to it "the"at_’t_ention,that it des,erves.—?-Orville Larson. ; y

Steelworkers

David McDonald’s- machine in the Steelworkers’ union was
in deep trouble last month as undemocratic procedures on union
finances finally caught up with it. The trouble was far from
localized as McDonalds opponents sought to break through his
tight control over union election machinery and win enough
nominations for Don Rarick, whom many members want, to get
his name on the ballot so that he can run against the handsome,
wavy-‘haired Steel Union president. V

The fight was highlighted last month by an accident in
Mclieesport, Pa., where anangry crowd of Steel union. mem-
bers chased their president, John J. Donahoe, out of the union
hall— at a meeting called to nominate candidates for interna-
tional union office. Donahoe Waschased when he refused to
recognize a nomination for Rarick. Thepuffing local prseident
called the newspapers to tell them that his local had nominated
McDonald “by acclamation.”

Another embarrassing incident ended last month when De-
lores Mann, office secretary for Local 2227 in Pittsburgh, ended
her one-woman strike against the local and announced she had
won what she struck'for—ending a wage differential that had
given her less pay than other union office secretaries in steel.

Reduction of radiation exposure allowed atomic, energy work-

Under a new plan, workers will be exposed to no more than an
average of five roentgens of radiation a year, a two-thirds re-
duction. "

Texas 5 9

Jerry Holleman, AFL executive secretar , told the Texas
CIO council convention in Austin that organized labor in the
state needs to step up and expand its battle for recognition of
the right of all workers to be treated as human beings.
“Recognition means a lot more than just recognition of a union
as a bargaining agent,” he said. “It means acceptance by the
employer and the community" of the workers as," people, as
humans, not just numbers.” — ’ '

The Wisconsin CIO is going to seek a state law to provide
periodic tests of the soil and air. The tests are to check on
radiation—--especially the highly poisonous strotium—90 concen-
tration, released far into the stratosphere during H-bomb’ tests.

‘ Brother Reynolds was one of

taken by the union through the
National Labor Relations board
clear to the Supreme Court of

Reynolds had been working at

When he was reinstated, the
Board also had ordered -the

sweeping victory can be clearly
understood in a comparison
with what Democrats did with
the landslide for President Roo-

was only slightly less than Roo-
sevelt’s. Yet these are the re-
sults in the House and Senate

Property Values

PORTLAND, Ore., (FP)’—
The' introduction of Negroes
into a previously “all white”

This was "the major conclu-

affect Negroes here. -

The housing woes of the city’s "

13,240 non-white citizens (9,529
of them are Negro) is a “mat-
ter for'shame and disgrace,” the
report charged.

 ﬁ\,/pl/hat ls Conspiracy? I I i I p
 Noted Judges and Lawyers
  over Denounced Charge:

 

Fourteen past and present Mine-Mill lead-

7 ers are indicted for “conspiracy.” What does

conspiracy mean under the law? -
-The charge of “conspiracy”. is historically

-1 the first legal weapon used by employers

‘against unions. In ‘the famous Cordwainers
case against a union ‘of shoemakers in Phila-

U; delphia in 1806, the union members were found

guilty of conspiracy and their union disbanded

‘shy a court underthe conspiracy law. ‘The law

,""of the time-said: “Even to do a thing which
islawful iir itself, byconspiracy, is unlawful.”
This same interpretation was used many

. -times against unions in subsequent years.’ It

is no wonder that famous lawyers and judges
'4 have denounced the state of the law. on con-
spiracy. and have warned against its abuse by
prosecutors ‘such as Brownell.
JUDGE LEARNED ‘ HAND
chargeof conspiracy “that darling of
ern-prosecutor’s nursery.” — —
In another famous case, the late SUPREME

called

- COURT. JUSTICE ROBERT - JACKSON said

“it constitutes a- serious threat to fairness in
our administration of justice.’_’ He said “the
modern ‘crime of conspiracy is so vague that
it almostdefies definition.” “. . . the most
odious "of all ,, offenses are t_hose which mask
justice”, ' ' ‘ .
J ustices'Felix.,Frankfurter and Hugo Black
joined in thisopinion. - . _

Another ‘famous U. S. APPEALS COURT
decision declared: . ’

, (“Many prosecutors seek to sweep within

"the dragnet of conspiracy all those who
ha.ve been associated‘ in any degree what-
ever with themain offenders; That there
"are great «opportunities for oppression in
such a doctrine is very plain.”

CLARENCE DARROW once said": “These
conspiracy laws, made by the court, have gone
so far that they can never be changed except
‘through a general protest by liberty-loving

men and women, if any such there be, against

Don't Get Alarmed

WASHINGTON - (PAI)——'-A fire alarm in the
plant,'interrupting an employer’s last-minute
talk to his workers prior to a representation
election, is not sufficient grounds_,for setting
aside a vote won by a union, 'the”National La-
bor Relations Board has unanimously ruled.

‘The fire alarm, a false one, was run at

Teamsters, won the election byone vote. It

was -not learned who had set the alarm. ’
The employer ' argued’ that the results

should be set aside because his interrupted

could not continue his discussion the next day
because of the NLRB’s ban on company-time

election. ' _,

The board said that neither the Taft-Hart
ley Act" nor its own policies required that par-
ties to employe elections be -guaranteed suf-
ficient time to complete last-minute talks to
workers. ‘ ,

The employer said that the fire alarm pre-
vented’ his discussion and that he had been
advised that at least three employes would
have voted against, not for, the union if they
could have heard him. Board investigators
found one_ such employe. '

Said the board, “We regard the evidence in

Board has long held that it will not attempt
to enter the speculative realm of evaluation of
individual employe reactions and attitudes.”
On the other aspects of the case, the board
found that the employer had, and exercised,

the opportunity to talk to employes in small

groups about the union.

AH.-CID Links Jobs,
Shorter Work Week

WASHINGTON—Organized labor’s current campaign

for a shorter workweek is based on economicrather than

social considerations, the current issue of the AFL-CIO
Collective Bargaining Reports says. i — » x

' The long hours that generally meant physicalstrain,
health hazards and inadequate time for family and so-

cial needs sparked the work-
ers’ earlier movetoward a
better life, the -report, a publi-
cation of the AFL-CIO Depart-
ment of Research, explains.

“Today there are still some
situations in which eight .
hours’ work means undue
physical strain,” it adds, ‘V‘but
it is primarily the economic
aspects in the foreground in’
plans for shortening eight-.
hour-day and 40-hour-week
schedules.”

Although sentiment for fur-
ther hours reduction is rooted
in part in a "general desire. for
more leisure time, it is more
widely based on the ground
that shorter hours of work will
help maintain employment op-
portunities, the report said.

ONE IN SIX,
Long-continued increases in
the productivity of the U. S.
worker, the report recalls,
mean that more is produced in
fewer’ hours or with fewer
workers. -“The present heavy
flow of technological improve-
ments and stepped-up expendi-
tures for new plants and equip-
ment,” it adds, “indicates a con-
tinuedhigh and perhaps even
higher rate of productivity ad-
vance-in the years ahead.”

The report cites airecent La-
bor" Department. study which
shows that 17 per cent of
nearly six million workers in
17 major labor market areas
late last year and early in 1956
had standard workweeks of less
than 40 hours——about one work-
er in every six.

The report listed different
ways in which hours can be re-
duced in labor-management ne-
gotiat~ions—shortening of eight-
hour day; cutting the five-day
week to four or four and a
half days, or substantially in-
creasing paid holidays or vaca-
tions. — -

COMPLETE ANSWER

The decision of the court was
held by the union to be “a com-
plete «answer”- to the indict-
ments. Mine-Mill officers said
in a statement: _

“The Supreme Court has said

that there _can_be no ‘fraud’ on

_ the NLRB in filing non-commu-

nist affidavits. How, then, can

_ there be a ‘conspiracy’ to ‘de-

' . fraud’ the board.

“We were confident three

 ‘years ago when the NLRB.

-.-a;,.._.—--

started its case that we would
achieve vindication in the Su-
f-preme court. We are just as

* confident of the innocence of

the persons who have been in-
dicted, and that they, too,‘ will

  —.-be vindicated in whatever they

 

have ‘done to comply with Taft-
Hartley and to protect the
Mine-Mill membership against
raids and in their wages and
working conditions.”

ATTACK INDICTMENTS
‘Meanwhile, ~Mine-Mill attor-

‘ ’ neys, -led by General Counsel

.Nathan Witt, were preparing
(motions attacking the indict-

ments which will be. presented

-to the U. S. District Court in
Denver on Jan. 14.. .Oral argu-

_ ments will be made on Feb. 4.

court and to finish its inter-

House Inadequate

The fact Was, however, that
his house was too much in dis-
repair -for adequate use by a
paralytic. That’s when Nick
Morelos, president of -Mine-Mill
Local 929, and Allen Bowman,
general manager of the ’Banner
Mining company, got together
to"make arrangements for re-
pairing and remodeling-Castro's
home’ to suit his needs.

The company provided its
engineering staff to plan «and-
supervise the "extensive re-
building ‘job. The union called
for volunteer members to do
the work. The union and the‘
company agreed to share the
cost of materials. The loca-l’s
membership voted to pay the
rent at ' another house to
whi‘ch the Castro family was
‘moved -while the repairs were
being made. -  i
