EDITORIAL
COMMENT on
Supreme Court's
June Fifth
Decisions in
McCarran and
Smith Act Cases:

Boston Herald:

". . .The real effect of the Court's
decisions, as the New York Times
points out, has been to weaken a
little more the protections of the
Fifth and First Amendments."

Pittsburgh
Post -Gazette:

". . . There are a number of disturb-
ing aspects of the court's rulings.
They leave unanswered, for exam-
ple, the question of forced self-
incrimination and violation of the
Fifth Amendment. "

Atlanta

C onstitution:

". . .Even with the court's careful
distinction between ‘specific intent‘
and ‘abstract doctrine‘ this ruling
has the effect of outlawing beliefs.
We have never done that before in
America."

New York Post:

". . . We have been slowly returning
to the spirit of the principle that no
man should be punished for what he
says or thinks unless there is a
clear showing that serious revolu-
tionary action is imminent as a con-
sequence of his words. Now we have
taken a big step backward. "

Louisville

C ourie r -Journal:

". . .The Bill of Rights is, as
Justices Black and Douglas intim-
ated in their dissents, _breached by
the very finding that mere advocacy
of belief is a criminal act."

Buffalo

Evening News:

''In probable effect, if not intent, the
U.S. Supreme Court's latest deci-
sions on how to deal with the
Communist conspiracy seem likely
to add up to a kind of grim joke. "

St Louis
Post -Dispatch

". . .to prohibit the expression of cer-
tain words. ideas, and theories is to
betray our own best tradition. "

Minneapolis
Sunday Tribune

". . . Further consideration of this
matter by the Supreme Court, we
think, is indeed in the interests of all
Americans, not just the Communist
Party. . . Has our confidence in our-
selves and in democracy become so
shaky that we must. in effect, outlaw
ideas which challenge our way of life?
. . . Are we ready to start down the
road of believing that only the Republi-
can and Democratic parties are ‘safe’
to belong to, and that some day perhaps
even one of them. . . ?"

Washington
Post:

_". . . the legislation that Congress has
produced is a confused mess in
which many dangers to traditional
concepts of freedom and justice still
lurk. "

New York Times:

". . . The sustaining of the Smith
Act's membership clause, and the
setting in motion of the ponderous
Internal Security Act, can only
serve again to divert public attention
to the virtually non-existent internal
Communist threat. "
