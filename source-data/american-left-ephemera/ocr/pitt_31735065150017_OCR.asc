Clark added: “The defend-

affirms as it has since the in-
dictment, that there was no
conspiracy, there was no fraud
against the government, and
there were no false Taft-Hart

THE CASE went to the jury

Dec. 16 after summaries by de-

fense attorneys Nathan Witt,

.Te1ford_ Taylor. and George.

Francis hit hard at the failure
of the government to prove a
conspiracy. They challenged

and exploded the inconsistent’

and contradictory testimony of
the paid informers, confessed
perjurors and professional wit-
_nesses put on the stand by the
government. In contrast, they
portrayed the democracy of
Mine-Mill as clearly shown by
the evidence of defense wit-

nesses who reflected the de-

cisive voice of the entire mem-

bership as it is exercised in
all of the union’s activities,
policies and decisions.

Earlier in the trial, on Dec.
2, ‘Judge Arraj dismissed
charges against two defend-
ants, Vice-President Asbury
Howard and Regional Director
Jack C. Ma-rcotti, for lack of
evidence. His action came af-
ter the prosecution rested its

case and defense attorneys ar-

gued motions for dismissal of
the charges against all of the

defendants. either together or
individually on grounds that.

no conspiracy had been proved
and that there was insufficient
evidence upon which to present
the case to the jury.

As the defense then opened
its case for acquittal, the re-
maining defendants were: Irv-
ing Dichter, secretary treasur-
er; Al Skinner, Raymond Den-

and a note of support from a

‘former Mine-Mill member now

working in another industry.
Following are some quotes
from the note:

“Here’s, five bucks toward
the copper miners. . . . I am a
shop steward for Teamsters

Among the many Mine-Mill
locals which have been con-
tributing whatever they can to
their brother ‘striking copper
workers, another one of the
most outstanding is Local 18
in Kellogg, Idaho. Since the
strike st»,;:,,rted, relief funds sent
in by Local 18 have so far
amounted‘ to more than $5,100,
including $2,000 sent for
Christmas.

Vice-President Orville Larson has resigned his office, effective

January 1.

In a notice to the local unions sent out with a covering let-
ter from President John Clark, Vice-President Larson said:

“This is to advise the membership that I have tendered my
resignation as Mine-Mill Vice-President, effective January 1,
1960, to President Clark, and that my resignation was accepted
by the International Executive Board at its meeting on No-

vember 15.

“To avoid any misrepresentation or misunderstanding of
the reason for my resignation, I want to make it perfectly clear
that my action is the result of a personal decision which I have
been considering for some time. It is in no way intended to re-
flect upon or jeopardize the interests of this organization with
which I have been constructively associated for many years, the
International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. ,

“Meanwhile, I am still continuing to act as usual in carry-
ing out my duties as Vice-President, participating in contract
bargaining as I have been, and doing all that I can to assist in
negotiations toward settlement of the strike which will he sat-

lively floor discussion on union
defense, strike support, the
Landrum-Griffin law, c i v i 1
rights and political action.

Keynote of the two-day ses-
sion was a fighting speech by
Mine-Mill President John Clark
which brought the delegates to
their feet in a standing ova-
tion as the veteran miners’
leader concluded with a strong
and clear declaration of" con-
fidence in the union’s future.

Clark denounced the forces
which have harrassed and at-
tempted to weaken the union
from the time it was organ-
ized. f‘Since 1893 when this
union was founded to improve
the lot of the copper workers
and others employed in the

membership.”

The scores of members who
showed leadership and gave
their utmost tobring about the

victory are too many to ‘list.

Mine-Mill local leaders from

surrounding areas also assist-.

ing in the campaign prior to
and after Marcotti’s return
from the trial were Winston

“THEIR SCHEMES to di-
Vide the union,” he added, “will

This union, devoted
to the democratic principles of
trade unionism, shall continue
to win gains for its members
and to grow in strength and
influence.”

Following discussion on a
report by Board’ Petit-Clair in
which he stressed’ the need for.

continued strike relief, the
delegates voted unanimously
to intensify fund raising in all
locals not on strike and to con-
tinue these efforts until the
strike is successfully con-
cluded. Petit-Cla.ir’s talk was
supplemented by reports from
President T. Chandler Taylor
and Recording Secretary An-
gelo Destefano on their local’s

strikes at AS&R in Baltimore i
‘ and Perth Amboy.

One entire afternoon was
spent on the Landrum-Griffin

DENVER — Mine-Mill's 1960
International Union conven-
tion, scheduled to be held next
March in Baltimore, Md., has
been postponed to a later place
and date by action of the In-
terna,tiona'1 Executive Board.

' The Board reached its deci-
sion after it became clear last
month that many local unions

had exhausted their treasuri-es
because of the copper. strike
and would consequently be un-
able to afford the financial
expense of sending delegates
so soon afterward.

In a. letter Dec. 18‘ explain-
ing the Board’s -action. Presi-
dent John Clark advised all
locals:

“The major strike involving

  

Board Acts to Postpone Conventio‘

our union against the copper
companies, which is still in
progress in some sections of
the union, has exhausted the
treasuries of‘ many of our 10-
cal unions. Even those who
were not directly involved in
the strike have had their fi-
nances impaired as the result
of the contributions they have
made.

THE MINE-MILL UNION

--.. ...-..-»...- .,—~---

Januury, ‘I960

President's Corner:

’59 Was Tough
Year on Labor

HE YEAR 1959 will be a closed book

in a few days —— but the effects of some
of the happenings will be with us for some
time to come.

Labor particularly was singled out for
an attack and there can be
no denial that this was to a
great degree successful.

é Large unions Whose lead-
ership thought they were
impregnable, and who in
many cases turned away
from the open threat find
themselves in the same trap
as those who have con-

  

conspiracy of large industry A, , 
and their legislative stooges V cm}.
against the entire labor movement.

- Our Union, Mine-Mill-, ‘without question has
been in the forefront of both the attacking and
the receiving end. ‘

 

It is on continued ,_fight for civil rights,
, peace, better wages, conditions and ._legislation

for theadvance and"se’c_urity of the people as

a whole that has’ spurredﬂtheconcentration of ‘

t_he'_attack against our Union."

*   it if

a trial of our Union, and. the conviction of

‘some of its leaders should,‘ ~if9'it;&'is»*possib1é-to

V ments of witnesses 'who,"by' the way,'were all‘-

' ,We have every confidencethat this convic-
tion willbe thrown out bytthe higherycourts.

_ The support for our Union in this case is com-

ing in-. from all over the nation. (See opposite
column on this page). - I ,

‘ , HE ﬁght of our members on the bargain-

 ‘ ing and strike front’"is certainly on its way"

to a conclusion. While we have been successful

‘ i'r‘1'the‘AS&R, Kennecott, and San Manuel opera-

tions-weiare still faced with the adamant and
arrogant positions of Anaconda and ‘Phelps
Dodge —

chiselgand cheapen the package at the expense
ofstheir employees.

 _"Anaconda, with its state control, is showing
its complete disregard for the welfare of Mon-
tanans by its divisive tactics, pitting worker
against worker and undoubtedly using its con-
trol to see that strikers are denied welfare and
promoting back to work moves through busi-
ness, press and other avenues where their
obvious pressure can be used.

’ In this fight support is also coming in from
unions both here and Canada and from Work-

ers in the Hawaiian Islands. Our membership
involved’ in thisstruggle, knowing their fight

to .1361?‘ j'ii§t"”‘one, are determined to ‘bring it to

successful conclusion. The full financial sup-
portof the International is being thrown behind

I . it to. see this end is accomplished. — JOHN

CLARK.

others who participated were
not discharged at all. There-
fore, he said, Tisdale’s dis-

The company attempted to
justify Tisdale’s discharge on
the grounds either that he had
been given warnings prior t_o
the March 13 stop—work meet-
ing, or that his participation in
the stoppage involved “insub-

its professional informers, to

Defense witnesses also tes-

REV. STEWART MEACH-

labor, to testify to labor’s
stand against the Taft-Hartley
act and to show the actions of
other unions in complying or
not complying with the law.

qualifications were: 10 years

copper (shown across the top of the chart) "are. the electrical equipment, light and power, building construc-
tions and industrial equipment industries which together use almost two-thirds of all copper consumed in

Anaconda Company ‘Poverty
Plea’ Denounced by Salvas

. : BUTTE, Mont.—Anaconda’s Montana operations are Very profitable, and the com-
pany is in an excellent position to grant the union’s demands, said Ernest Salvas, Dis-
trict 1 Executive Board Member last month. Commenting on a recent financial report

signed by Clyde. E. Weed, Anaconda board chairman, Salvas characterized it as “an
admission that the current strike against Anaconda has substantially reduced their

which reports after-tax-profits
as follows:

' April-June, 1959 ______ ._$18,400,000

July-Sept, 1959  12,450,000

THESE FIGURES reveal
that a shutdown in .Montana
(and at Tooele, Utah) for ap-

proximately half of the July-

September period, in the words
of Anaconda Chairman Clyde
E. Weed, “substantially re-
duced” third quarter profits.
They give the lie to the com-
pany’s claim to poverty in
Montana; in the first six
months of 1959, the struck
properties in Montana appear
to have contributed less than
15 percent of the company’s
gross revenues, but consider-

WHAT THEY SAY about‘ copper strike effects: “Copper
Prices Jumping Everywhere"—Engineering and Mining Jour-
nal; “WIRE MILLS COPPER STOCK NEAR BOTTOM—Fabri-
cators of electrical conductor—the nation’s biggest copper con-
sumers—are getting into a supply squeeze of increasingly seri-
ous proportions. The end-of-October wire mill reserve of refin-
ery shapes is the lowest since May, 1956, when primary pro-
ducers were commanding a price of 46 cents per pound. And
six weeks after the end of October, the cause of the shortage——
the strike of U. S. mines and refineries——was still going on.”—-
American Metal Market; “BIG COPPER SQUEEZE IMMI-
NENT, SHARPLY HIGHER PRICES POSSIBLE. A big squeeze
on world copper supplies is at hand. And it promises to get
much worse in the next few weeks. Prices could move sharply
higher. Regardless of what happens now in the strike situa-
tion, it seems apparent that there will not be enongh copper

 

available in the U. S. to take care of all consumers’ demands

Mine production losses in the U. S. are of the order of 300,000

PRIMARY REFINED LEAD production in the U.S. dropped

to 14,700 tons last September—lowest production rate since

1890, according to the U. S. Bureau of Mines. Before the strike,
production in 1959 had been averaging over 33,000 tons per

COPPER DISCOVERY announced at the Bor mine in Yugo-

to the United States. I

JOHN MOORE, superintendent of concentration for the Ana-
conda Company, gave voice recently to the callous attitude of
the copper companies toward shrinking job opportunities re-
sulting from ‘mechanization and automation. In a talk on auto-
mation at the Anaconda mill at the recent convention of the
American Mining Congress, he concluded with these remarks:
“The word automation is sometimes interpreted as being cor-
related with unemployment as a capitalistic evil for amassing
huge profits. I would leave the suggestion for your considera-
tion that possibly a more suitable term would be process con-
trol.” s .

RESEARCH moved into the spotlight in December with
announcement of 1960 research programs for lead and zinc by
Lead Industries Association and American Zinc Institute. $750,-

000 will be spent on lead research and market development in --

1960——more than in any previous year. The research budget for
zinc is also larger than in any previous year, and is approxi-
mately double what was spent in 1958.

Sound and vibration control will be one important field of
concentration for lead researchers. Lead is now being used on’
aircraft to reduce the noise of jet engines, and to isolate vibra-
tion in. air-conditioning systems. Investigation will also be made
into useyof lead alloy anodes for corrosion protection, new type
lead pigments, lead powder metallurgy, fibre-reinforced lead
and other applications. Zinc researchers are working on better
finishes for zinc die castings, on better architectural alloys, im-
proved lithographic plates and in many other fields.

Both trade ‘organizations emphasized that important re-
search’ work is being carried on by major lead and zinc pro-
ducing companies in addition to the programs summarized
above. ~

U. S. EMBARGO on trade with China keeps U. S. export
industries out of a potentially big market, while other countries

"get established as suppliers. Despite discoveries of large cop-

per deposits, China still needs to import large quantities from
abroad. Most recent large Chinese order was for 2,000 tons of
copper wire, placed with French cable manufacturers.

POTASH DEPOSIT near Moab, Utah, discovered by Delhi; ‘ T ‘

Taylor Oil company some years ago is the subject of numerous
recent rumors, all unconfirmed at press time. Delays in ‘pro-

duction at new Canadian mines and increased U. S. use of

deposit in the near future; One rumor has it that Delhi-Taylor
will join with Armour and Company’s fertilizer divisions in
marketing the output of the. Utah mine.

BUNKER HILL COMPANY plans immediate expansion-of
output at its electrolytic zinc plant from about 60,000 to 74,000
tons per year. This will mean 40 new jobs. Additional capacity
now being installed can be brought into production in the fu-
ture whenever market conditions warrant. The new capacity

would permit expansion of production to 90,000 tons of slab  

zinc per year. ~

"FOREIGN ZINC producers agreed at U. N. headquarters‘

last May to cut zinc output by more than 100,000 tons per -‘year
in an effort to reduce surplus supplies hanging over the market.

Some producers are now reported to favor rescinding; the cut-“
backs because of improvement in zinc prices. The matteris»

scheduled to b_e discussed at the nextmeeting of the ‘U, N. Lead-

Zinc Committee scheduled for late in January. U. S. producers , _
will strongly oppose rescinding of gcutbacks. No action is_con- ‘ 

templated with respect to lead cutbacks.
