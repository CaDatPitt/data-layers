McCAR

ATTACK ON

Salt Lake City, Utah

The employers’ attack on our
union was opened on a new front
here this month. Senator McCar-
ran’s sub‘-committee on “Inter-
nal Security” held a four-day
hearing that produced screaming
headlines about an “Ex-red” who
-told of a “Communist-in.spired”'
strike——a strike that never oc-
curred.

The stale CIO “trial” report
was dusted off, and a parade of
stoolpigeon witnesses appeared.
Most of these are former officers
of Mine-Mill who have been re-
jected by the membership. They
testified to “Communist domina-
tion” of the union. .

Ironically, their only knowledge
of the union came during a past
period when they were part of a
majority group of the Interna-
tional Executive Board. Other,

“witnesses “friendly” to the com-

mittee were two professional

stoolpigeons and _the A CIO.directo1'. .

of research and education.

IN ADDITION to the Mine-
Mill leaders who had been sub-
poenaed as “unfriendly” wit-
nesses at the time the last issue
of THE UNION went to press,
five more were subpenaed just
prior to or during the hearing.
Three of these ——Vice-President

Orville Larson, Washington Rep-A

resentative Herman Clott and
General Counsel Nathan Witt—-
were served subpaenas when they
appeared as spectators in the
hearing room. .
Other Mine-Mill witnesses were
President John Clark, Secretary-
Treasurer M. E. Travis,‘ Assistant
Editor Rod Holmgren, Regional
Director Al Skinner, Staff Mem-
ber Graham Dolan, Int’1 Reps.

Carran and his attorneys re-

the basis of their religion, place _

have done in other cases. They ’

of the “Have you stopped beating

When Attorney Nat “Witt at-
tempted to ‘protect our witnesses
from unfair questions, he was
threatened repeatedly with being

cited for “contempt of the Sen-

ate.”

On the final day of our hear- A

lng, Senator McCarran announced
that on the following week_ he
would begin an investigation 01
the United Nations. ..

- McCarran_ also indicated that
there might be a delay of months
before material on the Mine-Mill
hearing is made public. This led
to speculation as to whether our,

union's militant defense may have __

thrown the committee’s plans out
of gear‘. ' . ' ’ .

the history of the organized
labor movement of Ainerica as a year dedicatedto the bitterest and
most we1l—organized ‘plan for its destruction. Mine-Mill, because of its

‘outstanding militancy, is one of the first to feel the brunt of this

attack. ~
In the early nineties the same forces, using the cry of anarchist,
mustered. out the troops, builteuptheir ‘concentration camps or “bull
0 pens” andincarcerated ‘those who dared join the union,
and fight the mining industrialists. In the early twen-
ty’s, using the cry of Bolshevik and Wobbly, they in-
stigated the Palmer raids, jail sentences and deporta-
- tionsfor their insidious purpose.
.' Today, after years ofcareful planning, we see a
‘replica of the past attempts, but with a more vicious
: and» definite purpose. This time the cry of Commu-
! nism is used and the inference of espionage, backing
 this up with the passing of legislation that is aimed,
not onlyat‘ the heart of organized labor, but at the.ciVil liberties of
every citizen in the nation. - '
The investigations of the La Follette Civil Libe/rties Committee a
few years ago and its finding on the use of labor spies, renegades,
criminals, and stoolpigeonsto destroy the labor movement, are mild
compared to the activities of the fanatical,investigationsand the use’
of people who put to shame the earlyday conspirator or informer.
MINE-MILL last week went through a typical inquisition ‘formu-
lated for the purpose I have mentioned. It was a sickening attempt to

(Adopted unanimously
October 7-, 1952)

A‘ month ago, the 48th Con-

’; vention of the International Union ‘

 of Mine, Mill & Smelter lWorkers, V
 reaffirmed _our Union's position
» of independientpolitical action.

The resolution onpolitical

 action passed with overwhelming
 ‘support and said:

“The 1952.political campaign
may be the mo_st important in
the history of the American
people. It’s outcome may de-
termine whether free thought
and free speech in America
are to be restored to the peo-
ple, or whether the cold war
goes on and gets worse, and
’ V the American people are to be
, deprived of their basic Con-
stitutional rights and liberties
for a long period of time. '

.“Our position is, and will con- ,

tinue ‘to be that nothing.less
than the end of the cold war
and of‘ the hot Korean war

will satisfyour members and '

‘the ‘ American people. , Our po-
sition is nothing less than a

genuine, 100 per cent FEPC',"

_nothing less than a better
standard of: living for our
members, nothing less than a

cgmplete end to M cCarranism,.

McCarthyism and Smithism
will satisfy us.’.’ _ _ .
TODAY, on theeve of an-attack

 on our Union‘. by .a committee of
Congress,’ we~are acutely aware
_‘of the increasing anti-labor

character of Congress. Proposals

'7_ to outlaw national bargaining are ,
being made with new boldness. 
__ A Congressional speaker at the
_..j recent session of the American
V;_‘,Mining Congress went _so far as
‘  to propose limiting joint bargain-
, ing to unions within a fifty-mile,
' radius of each other.

The next Congress, if this tren

" continues, will enact some such
: union-busting measure, along
 with a tighter wage freeye and 
 law to rob unions of their
 bargaining rights if they‘ insist
I upon using them to fight for the
3 ‘welfare of‘ theirstmembers. _ s ,
 This trend can be reversed if
v  organizations s_uch_ as our Union
 take steps to help makelthe needs

    
 
 
   
     
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
    

and wishes of our membership
felt in terms of votes. Mine-Mill
is in,» a unique position to play‘ a
role in'Congressional races in a
number of Western states. and in
a number of Congressional dis-
tricts in other states.

IN THE SENATE, nine notori-
ous reactionaries are running for
reelection.- Our Union can play a

ll: decisive "part in,‘ five of these-

races. They are Watkins of Utah,

IT GOES without saying that
the real test of ‘Mine-Mill's politi-
cal ‘strength will come in the
coming weeks of the campaign.
Whether we have succeeded in‘
doing a practical, chard-hitting
political job will be measured by
our results in November.

Therefore, between the time of
this conference and the election
-we recommend the following pro-
gram to be carried out by all of-
ficers, representatives and W local
unions to guarantee the greatest
mobilization of our membership.

Upon leaving this conference
arrangements should be made for
local union ‘delegates to visit with
the Congressional and state can-
didateswhom we recommend for
support. We should indicate our

position to them and consult with

them as" to the best ‘means of
strengthening their campaigns.

We must also indicate our posi-

tion on issues as it relates to 'the

Presidential campaign. in‘ this
way, by pressure from state
levels, we can make the Presi-
dential campaign hew m_ore
closely to the issues demanded by
the people.

IN EACH LOCAL UNION time
must be taken by representatives
and local union _‘leadership« to
make a breakdown of member-
ship by ward and precinct where
necessary and‘to» determine the

«extent of registration. ' While it
isquite late, in some icaseslwe yet‘

moéi izafion

Regardless of top leadership, we
are confident we will find the
rank and file of other unions in

a receptive mood for suchgunity. ~ A

Each Board member and each’
local union with the assistance of

f the representatives‘ should get"

outbetween now and election day

several leaﬂets for mass distribu-' '

tion to our local union member-
ship. These leaflets should pre-
sent the issues faced by the

American people and should in-

dicate our stand in support of
candidates.

WHERE IT IS financially pos- .

sible and deemed advisable, we
should seek time on the radio to

indicate the stand‘ of the Mine, "“”

Mill and/Smelter Workers in the
coming elections and to help pre-
sent the issues to..the people. It
goes without saying that such
broadcasts will not be done as
endorsing any political party but
must be presented from the
standpoint of our union’s role of
independent political’ action.

‘As election day approaches,
each local union should hold one
special membership meeting de-
voted to the question of the elec-
tion and the campaign. Of course,

in some -areas, insteadof single

local "union meetings, it may be
better to have areaipolitical rallies.

should be invited, and wecan

I - ‘ One of the guest speakers at the M vine-M ill ../.8th convention in New
‘.1/orlc was the distinguished scholar and historian, Dr. W. E. B. Dubois.
' Our delegates were so impressed with his analysis of the inter-relations

of industry and workers around the world——of why the welfare of

workers on other continents affects us—that many asked for the com-

plete text of thespeech. This was supplied to delegates in mimeo-.

graphed form.

TH E‘ UNION is reprinting Dr- Dubois’ addressso that all mem-
bers may read it. I t/is in three sections, of which this is the second.

 the.100 years between 1817 and
- 1917 there took place in the world 204

wars. The victims of those wars—the

I killed, crippled and insane; the impov-

erished and hopeless, were mainly from

the working classes of the world, and
‘the reasons for the fighting were main-

ly. greed,‘ avarice, cupidity, or ruthless
desire, for private gain at any cost to
public welfare.

The names 3 of the wars show in part
their object. The war for independence
of Greece; the Crimean War to control,
the Balkans; the Civil War over A
slavery in the United States; the
Franco-Prussian War for leadership in
Europe; the Russo-Turkish War for
control of the Near East; the Russo-

‘Japanese War between Europe and ’
Asia;- the First. World War for re-as- '
. sortment of colonies.

These were the greater conflicts,'but
there were others. The 1830 revolution
in "Poland; civil wars in Spain; the
series of British wars in India; the
Opium" War to force China to buy

, British opium; the wide European rev-
olutions ofv1848; the revolt inChina;

wars against Denmark; Kaffir wars in-
Africa, repeated wars‘ against Indians.
in the United States; mutiny inlndia;
the Austrian war against Sardinia; the

A war between France'—""‘and ‘Mexico; the-
, Seven Weeks War of German‘ junkers-

in Europe; the Revolution in Mex-
ico; the Zulu Wars and the Boer
Wars in Africa; the warsyofthe Mahdi
in the Sudan; the Matabele Wars in
South Africa; the Sino-Japanese War,’
the Spanish-American War; the revo-
lution in China; the War between Italy

and Turkey; all these‘ and 100 smaller
” conflicts-which came after the fall of
‘Napoleon andbefore the Russian Revo-
’lution, in an era. which is often called

thehundred years of European peace!
THE OBJECT of these wars was to

. control the labor of mankind;‘to keep

the wages of most men down to the
starvation level; to keep most men
ignorant; to let the massiof men perish
from curable disease. ’

To illustrate what I am_ saying, let
me center your attention on one conti-‘\

nent‘: Africa; and one part of that

continent: The Union of South Africa.
I mention this because today as you

' and the world know, this areafis in in-

creasing upheaval, and this upheaval
is only too natural when youthink of
the past.

Diamonds were discovered in’ South

0 - Africain 1867, and in 1885, gold. This
‘ sealed the fate ‘of the "unfortunate peo-

ples who lived in that land. For most
ofthem it was no blessing but -a curse.

*In- 1899 came war between the Boers

and the English to control the gold and
diamonds, and ten years ' later,’ the
Union of South Africa became a nation.

THEN FOLLOWED an extraordi-
nalry history of. oppression and revolt,

‘ I to‘ achieve wealth out of lheap labor;
,Gold and diamonds characterized» the
—modern capitalistic system-——diamonds ‘
3for show, luxury and .extravagance,~

and more recently for mechanical tech-
niques. Gold has long beena measuring‘
rod for modern wea.lth,Aand a vehicle
of modern trade and‘corn_merce.

’ The organization therefore {of the
gold and diamond mines of ‘South
Africa became a woi'ld—pattern. Black
laborers were brought from all parts of

"Africa by force, fraud and promise.

They were held in the mines, worked
under »force,.whipped, paid 25 cents a
day. Their family life throughout South
Africa and ‘even Central Africa was
broken up.

All efforts to unionize these workers =
were ‘opposed, not simply by the mine

owners but by the white workers, ‘since
 i,” the "white“workers received high wages
'f~;ai1'cliaprivileged position because "the »

H, Utah .

wages of the blacks were so low. Trade
unions not only refused to admit Ne-
groes, but agitated to keep Negro un-
ions from being formed or legally
recognized. '

TIN 1922 thepwhite ‘unions ‘struck to

'prevent*I\leg1'oes from doing skilled

work. They marched in Johannesburg
with banners inscribed: “Workers of
the World fight and unite for white
South Africa.”,_. The result today is a

fantastic wage situation, which a Brit- .

ish bricklayer recently called “a
monopoly of stupidity}? —A White
skilled laborer has four native help-
ers. . ' _ 1

The white man is paid. $56‘ a week
while the four natives each get‘ $10 a
week and dorall the work. The white
Boer farmers hold 2% million Africans
practically in slavery. and pay-them

$2.40 a ‘month’ in -case ‘with scant . ra-_

tions. In the cities Europeans live’ in

. ical vegetation,

_prote'sted._ Twenty-five 4

homes along broad streets with trop-
parks and beaches,
while outside the city squat thousands
of Africans in crowded tin shacks.

ATTHE BEGINNING of the 19th
Century in Cape Colony, one of the
four states 'forming.the Union of South
Africa, all races had the right to vote.
In the other three provinces they had
no vote. In 1926 Hertzog began to at-
tack the right of the natives in Cape
Colony to vote, until in 1936 they were
disfranchised, after having had the
vote for 80 years. Their names, were
transferred to .a separate list where
theycould elect three white members

, to represent them in a legislative body

of 153 members.

Finally in 1950 allpersons of South
Africa were classified as white, native
or colored, and an attempt was made
toseparate them completely’___except in
the case of servants and city workers.

These in order to ‘move to work are
ordered to carry as ‘many as 16 dif-
ferent writ_ten passes. As a result
South Africa has more arreststhan any
civilized nation. Out" of a tot_a’l- popula-

””"tion of 121/2 .. million, the Union of
'Southi_Africa has 11/2 million voters,

of whom 50,000 are colored and none
are native. It is now proposed to dis-
franchise the colored voters‘.

Kadalie formed a trade union which

was called Communist but which strug-_—"
gled bravely for Negro rights until.‘

Kadalie was driven out. A

In 1946 fifty-thousand Negro gold‘
miners struck and were subdued by
machine guns, tear gas and hand ‘gre. 
nades. In 1949 a riot in Johaniiesburg *
drove the police out but they returned 2-

with tear‘ gas and arrested‘ 600 ‘men;

and women. The Negro. South African.

National Congress organized-"in 1921

has repeatedly and‘ carefully organize’d_ 

protests.

_This Congress recently said? “As is I
‘well /~.'nown,“the government,_ through v
 repressive policy of trusteeship and, 
segregation and through ‘legislation
that continues. to insult andréﬂdegradel ‘_
the.African people by depriving gthem‘ ._

of fundamental human rights . .

  

categorically rejected our offer of ..co- . I

operation. The’ consequence has been
the gradual worsening -~of_"the social,

economicand political position, ofTth”e ” 

African people and arising" tide of‘

racial bitterness and tension. The cu- '
‘mulative effect this legislation has -is

to crush the national organizationvof

the oppressed peoples, to destroy. the. 
economic position of the people and to _; 

create a reseixoir of cheap‘ labor for_’
the farmsiand goldmines; to prevent

 

the unity and development of the'Afri- , 9

—Esta ’carta de los oficiales intemacionalcs se envio la semana
pasada a todas las umones locales. Urge dos clases de accion: (1 ) in-

‘forma a nuestros miembros sobre los hechos dela junta McCarran,

para derrotar el esfuerzo de colnfandir a nuestﬁos miembros-,' y (2)-

greso elano proxmzo.
ATODAS UNIONES LOCALES:
Salud:

Las juntas McCarran que se cele-

it braron__.en Salt Lake City la semana

.pr6xima pasada ya terminaron, pero

 

la lucha} contrarel McCa_rrani-smo y o
que este Comité atentaba hacer apenas.

‘ha einpezado.

No. cabe la inenor duda que estas
juntas -fueronpjnstigadas por las com-
paﬁias mas anti-obrera-s en ynuestra in-
dustria. Estas compaﬁias consiguieron
la ayuda voluntaria de McCarran, quien,

ellas ‘esperaban, haria un buen trabajo

contra nuestra union." Intentaron este
método desesperado porque todos los

p demés esfuerzos para destruir a nue-

stra union lfracasaron,

c ji. Una vez mas McCarran produjo "como

te/stifg*<i's principales a los Thismos hom-

“ Tires quienes hand sido las herramientas

mayores de los patrones en las in-
v.asiones y movimientos de separacién

durante los pﬁltimos -pocos aﬁos. ‘ Son >

la misma gente que propagaron men-
tiras. contra nuestra union en toda lo-
pcalidad. donde tenemos miembros—la

_misma gente que testificaron _contra

nuestra union en 1948 cuando e1 CIO
intentaba conquistarnos y contaron el
mismo viejo cuento., ’
.- “‘ “ I

Ni McCarran ni las compaﬁiasil pu-
dieron producir un .solo_ miembro de
Mine-‘Milli durante los filtimos cuatrop
_a_ﬁos.‘_E1- Comité solo produjo a dos nue-

vvos testig,os—J. B. Matthews, ex-di1';ec-

tor de escudriﬁamiento del Viejo Comité

, Dies quien por confesién propia ha

y.»

hecho su Vida durante los flltimos 14
aﬁos por‘-ymedio de dar tal testimonio,
»y un Harvey Matusow, delator _(in-.
formantey espia) confesado, quien, sin
prueba ninguna cargo que"_fla huelga
de cobrerfen 1950” fue ll'anEiada»bajo
las o1‘de;n-es del Partido Comunista; .

‘ Laiabsurdidez de este testimonio esta
visto por} medio del'- record (archivos).
No hu-boisni un'a huelga de t,rabajado1'es
deicobrel llamada por nuestraiinién en
todo__,_el .aﬁo 1950. Sin embargo este
testimbnio ~lo<;o_ fue hecho parte del
acta de la" junta, y Matusow, quien a

V" ylo_visto ha leido muchos cuentos de

 

 

 
 

 

  

caipa-y"-esp'ad’a, no fue exigido que sos‘-3
tuviéra-A ‘sus i cargos fantésticos» con
solo _una prueba.

hecho de que McCarran no‘ pu-
diera encontrar _nI un ‘solo traidor
dentro nuestras filas esevidencia de

la _fuerza.q‘ue Mine~Mill ha logrado en

ln£r_aoN§mlAcIoNp as cosmos: Esta freinendu muchedum

laccion politicaen favor deaqucllos candidates que mejorm-"an cl Con-

el proceso de derrotar los esfuerzos
para destruirla. Las invasiones y los
movirnientos de separacién han sido
derrotados. Huelgas prolongadas que
Se nos han impuesto, tales como la
Empire Zinc y American Zinc, se han
ganado, y niuestra union ha salido mas
grande y mas fuerte que nunca. Esta’.
visto que no pueden destruir a Mine-
Mill de por fuera, por lo tanto' han
acordado en una tactica nueva.

El ‘mismo McCarran lo hizo claro en
las juntas que su motivo actual era
intimidar y dividir a los miembros‘ de'

Mine-Mill para despojar a la union de A

su liderato militante’ y convertirla en
un sindicatd de compaﬁia. En una larga
y apasionada apelacién a los miembros
de Mine—Mill que vinieron a las juntas
para oir y 'ver de por si, McCarran
dijozp “Respondan a la situacién para
que puedan limplarse de esta situacién,
y no esperen que la ley tenga que
lidear con estos individuos.”

“La ley aque McCarran se aludia
aparentemente era la misma que el
introdujo en la ﬁltima sesiénpf del
Senado Nacional. Incluimos una copia
de la misma, y debe ser cuidadosa-
mente-estudiada por los miembros de
Mine-Mill. Si se aprobara, esta ley re-
instituiria la- anlfigua lista negra,
y’debilitaria y destruiria todo contrato
del union existente en los E.E. U.U.

En las juntas, McCarran hizo el
papel de amigodel obrero. Pero los
procedimientos mismos indicanla clase
de “obrero” que McCarran favorece.
A los delatores y. espias se les permitié
hacer uso de la palabra a su gusto,
hechando sus mentiras y calumnias
contra esta union. Nose ‘les pidi6
ninguna prueba, y se les permitio meter
en el procedimiento todos los cargcssin
verificacion que sus mentes enfermas
podian imaginar. Cuando los lideres de
nuestra ‘union’ estaban en la tribuna
otro fue el asunto. '

La Corte Suprema de los iU.U.

ha diého sin equivocacién‘ qu_e.la Quinta A

Enmienda es el escudo de los inocentes.

. Cuando nuestros miembros i11tentaron'
aclarar‘ esto en las juntas, McCarran,_

declaré brtiscamente en dos oca_c_iones:
“No. me importa de la Corte Suprema.”
Esto era evidente a todos los que

asistieron a las juntas, sin embargo,
es Vespantoso cuando sale-de la boca
de un Senador de los E.E. U.U.

Es importante que .todo miembro

entienda porque invocamos la Quinta
Enmienda y rehusamos contestar
inuchas de las preguntas de McCarran.
Si 3. un hombre se le pregunta si es~o
ha sidoemiembrio del Partido Comunista,
y contesta “si”, ‘puede ser_acusado
bajo la Ley Smith. Si. contesta “no” a
esa pregunta, se expone a cargos“de
perjurio (jurar\en falso) si‘ los dela-
Itores (informantes), que no se ’detienen
en ’ mentir, testificaran lo contrario.
Delatores son “testigos'fav'orables” al
Comité McCarran, y por lo tanto son
protegidos contra cargos de periurio.

Los testigos de la union también
rehusaron contestar preguntas qu-e
parecian ser inocentes tales como las
preguntas pertenecientes a. la firma
de “Declaraciones 'No—Comunista”, que

-los oficialesv. de nuestra union han

firmado.’ Hicieron esto porque cuando
una persona contesta tall prequnta, la
ley mantiene que tiene quecontestar
toda pregunta relacionada a primer
pregunta, y no es» muy difici ver a
donde contestar tal preguntas lo
llevaria a uno. 1

En otras palabras, tales aparen»te-
mente inocentes preguntas no son mas

- que anillos en una cadena de preguntas,

y si 10 pescan a uno en esta cadena lo
forzan en,la posicién de informante,

- o si uno rehusa informar lo exponen

9. uno a cargos de' contumacia (diso-

Ibedencia y desprecio) contra el Senado

Nacional.  -

Nuestra union no, ha recibido estos
ataques por parte del Comité McCar-
ran echadai‘ En Salt Lake City acusa-
mos a McCarranee,n/grandes anuncios

turalmente, categorize’) estos anuncios
como “propaganda Comﬁnista", pero

los hechos hablan de por si.

Nuestra union saldra de la lucha
contra el McCarranismo mas fuerte
que nunca, siermpre que haiga un en-
tendimiento ‘claro de lo que sucedio en
Salt Lake City. El buen apoyo de‘lasi
unionefs (locales y sus miembros durante

mos que continuen sus esfuerzos contra

tivo de hacer esto es. por medio del
sufragio. La declaraciones inclusas de

iespectaculo

Una de las ppaginas mas infames en , 9

la historia delsmovimiento obrero en
los E.E. U.U. se acaba de escribir en
Salt Lake City. Nos aludimos a las
audiencias McCarran que se celebraron
los dias 7-8-9 de octubre en dicha ciu-
dad. Todo el mundo sabe que los prin-
oficiales de nuestra union
fueron citados a comparecer ante 1a‘
sub-comisién McCarran del‘ Senado na-
cional.

Cual era el motivo de estas audien-

’cias? Las ordenes de comparendofno

. . \  - . .
indicaban el porque a nuestros oficiales
se les ordenaba que testificaran ante
el comité McCarran. Pero el Sr. Mc-_

Carran yinformé a la prensa que nuestra

union seria investigada sobre los cargos
de ser “dominada por €omp.nistas” y
“anti-Americana.”

De aqui en adelante es importante
saber quien es el va a investigar-»a—
nuestra union y dudar _su Americanis-

mo? Nuestro periédico en ejemplares

anteriores hizo una labor magnif-ica de
exponer a este Sr: McCarran como: uno
de los elementos mas anti-obreros y
mas pro—facistas del pais. ~ ' -

Es uno de los /mejores amigos que
las compaﬁias en nuestra industria°tie-
nen en el Senado nacional. Destacados
miembros de la prensa nacional le han
llamadol el “Senadorde Espaﬁa,” la
Espaﬁa fascita que Hitler. y Mussolini
ayudaron establecerpbajo el dictador
Franco. Este Sr. pﬁblicamente ha
c..mpeonado la ‘industria de gariteros
en Nevada que es controlada por. crim-
inales. Este Sr. ha tratado de castiga1'
a un periodico en su pnopio estadov
porque este le ha criticado; v 1 

Finalrnente a McCarran se le ha_ do
el crédito de ser el padre del control
del pensamiento y de los Campos de.
concentracién que se ban llevado a
cabo por medio de las leyes que el ha
introducido en el Senado .de los 
U.U.‘? — .

V Es ridiculo y absurdo que este Sr.
McCarran investigue una union re-
conocida como una de las mas de-
mocraticas de A_mérica—una union
cuyos’100,000 miembros elijen a sus
lideres locales y nacionales por medio
del sufragio .secreto. A1 contrario, el
que’ debe ser investigado es el y no los
lideres de nuestra union quien nosotros
elejimos porquelvson leales y militantes,
porque los respetamos y los apoyamos.

Entonees cual es el‘ motivo de esta "
invetigacién por parte de McCarran?
Nosotros cargamos que estas investi-
gaciones contra‘ nuestra union ' se. han
la__I1zadoi-para debilitarla y dest-ruirla.

vergonzoso

peraba romper nuestro programa de
negociacion cuando ya estaba en punto
de terminarse con éxito. '

Nuestra union se cuenta entre las
fuerzas mas potentes contra el pro-A,
grama McCarran de controlar el pen-
samiento y establecer Campos de con-
centracién. Esta un-ion desda .1944 ha
pelead'o- por. la derrota de McCarran
porquevle consideramos una enemigo del‘
obrer-o- organizado. Nada seria .mas
ventajoso para el quederrotar a nuestra
union antes de‘ que tenga que‘ lanzar
su candidatura para re’-eleccién‘ en 1955.

(fueron aprobadas) que se pueden luti1- 

iar contra .el pueblo Mexicno, spar-Q A
ticularmente contra aquellos Mexicanos _p

que son lideres de su pueblo en las ‘._un-._  e

En vista de todo esto, una cosa esta. '_
clara: «la ﬁnica manera de derrotar

es usar las mismas tacticas que_usamos

  The letter from the Interna-

 5’ page refers to ‘a new union-
busting bill introduced into Con-
‘gress by Senator McCarran. Here

  I is the final paragraph of that

bill:

_ . "Nothing in this Act or any other statute

GREETINGS: - I V

The McCarran hearings which were held in

Salt Lake Citylast week are over, but the fight
against 'McCarranism and the things this com-
mittee was attempting to accomplish has just
started. -  -

There is little ‘doubt that the hearings were.

instigated by the most anti-union companies in

our industry. These companiesfsecured the will-

ing help'of,McCar’ran, who-they hoped could do a;

job "on our union. They tried this desperate I
method because all other attempts to destroy our V

union have failed. 

Once again McCarran produced as _star wit-_

nesses the samemen. who have beenthe, main
tools of- the _bosses in raids and secession ‘move-
ments during the past‘ few years. They were the
same people who have spread lies against our

union in everylocality in: which we have mem-

bers—the same people who testified against our

union back in 1948,w_hen the C10 was attempting '
. V to takeover, and they used the same old line.

NEITHER McCarran nor the companies were ’

able to produce 'a“sing1e- witness against our union
who could‘ claim’ membership in Mine-Mill within
the past fouryears. The committee was able, to
produce only two new witnesses-'-J. B. Matthews,

former research director for the old Dies Com-_ ‘
mittee who admittedly has made his living by *

givingsuch testimony for over 14 years, and,one

' -arvey Matusow, pself-confesjsed stoolpigeon,‘

who, without offering any proof whatsoever,

. charged that “the copper strike in 1950”, was» ,_ , , ., . . W
' . such innocentsounding questions as those, per-. g;
‘tainingﬁto the signing‘ of n’on-Communist affi- j.

called at the orders of the "Communist Party.

The absurdity of this testimony is evident,

. from the record- There was not :a single strike

of copper workers called by our union in all; of.

e 1950. But this insane_ testimony wasrnade part

» V, therefore protected against perjurrcharges.  V ' '~

of the record, and Matusow, who -has . obviously 7

read too many cloak-and-dagger thrillers, was ‘

not asked to .produce"one ‘iota of proof to‘ back ‘

up his fanltasticgcharges. ‘ ‘

llrIcCarran’s "failure to findsa single traitor
within our ranks is evidence of the: strength,
Mine-Mill has achieved in the process "of de-

feating repeated attempts to destroy it.“Raids

and secession movements have been defé_ated,..
Long, protracted strikes, such as those forced

upon us by Empire Zinc and American Zinc,~have.

been won, and our union has emerged bigger and

stronger than ever. It has become’ clear sthcat. 

Mine-Mill cannotbe destroyed fromythe outside,
and so anew tactic has beenagreed on. r

THE CFFICERS of our union.w_er_e_ 
the right tonread statements—setting forth the 1.

honest seeker for the facts.jN one of our’ people.
were allowed in any case togelaborate on a single _
answer. McCarran demanded -“yes” and ‘,‘no’:’* 
answers, and when our members refused 
testify against themselves under the rights
granted every American- under the Fifth Amends
ment to the Constitution, McCarran painted“'thi’s__;~,
as the act of guilty men, n _  
‘ The Supreme Court offthe United States 
stated without equivocation that - the Fifth ;,f
Amendment is the shield of the innocent. Wheiltf,
our members attempted to make this clear at ‘the; 
hearings, McCarran ‘bluntly stated on at _least I
two occasions: “I don’t care about the Supreme I 
Court.” This was only too evident to all who 3;
attended the hearings, but is shocking, nevertheéj ‘
less, ..when it comes from the mouth of a United
States Senator. ‘ ' ‘A f _ ‘-
IT -IS -IMPORTANT that every member»,
understands why we invoked the _Fifth.Amend-_ 
ment and refused to" answer many of McCarran’s 
questions. If a man is asked whether he is, 0157
