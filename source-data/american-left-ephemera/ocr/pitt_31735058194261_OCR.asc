REIURN T0 FORT DIX MAY 16 - Armed Forces Dal!

 

Brothers, we’ll never be slaves again.’ ‘Pvt. Bill Breakfield , Ft". ‘Dix 38

. Brothers and sisters, May l6 will be the day that the
imperialist Amerikkkan military will make speeches and parade
its weapons of destruction which it is using against the lib-
eration forces fighting Amerikkkan imperialism at home and
all over the world.

While the military parades its repressive might, there are
over 25,000 G1 political prisoners of war in military prisons
all over the world. There are 700 such prisoners in the Fort
wDix concentration camp alone. Most of the prisoners are in jail
for resisting the illegal authority of the pig brass and for
their opposition to the war in Vietnam by going AWOL. \

Also, three members of the civilian staff of the UFO, an
anti-war coffeehouse near Fort Jackson, S.C., have been framed-
up and sentenced to 6 years each. The coffeehouse at Fort 
has been bombed and was forced to close.

On May 16 the government will parade its military might
in an attempt to intimidate and further repress the black lib-
eration struggle that is freeing the-black comunity from the
oppression of racist Amerikkka. The Black Panther Party faces
the brunt of this repression. Bobby Seals faces the electric
chair in New Haven.

But this repression will not work. The people of this_ ~
country do not support the polides of the government. They do
not support the war in Southeast Asia. Nor do the people support
the use of their sons, brothers and husbands as cannonfodder in
an illegal imperialist war.

And Gls are not running from.the repression of their resist~
ance movement by the pig brass. Instead, anti-war Gls are step-
ping up their fight and opposition to the war in Vietnam, to
racism, to military injustice and to the repression. They are
fighting backagainst their class oppressor -- the pig Brass.
