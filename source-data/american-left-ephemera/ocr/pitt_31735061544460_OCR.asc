strikes. On May 14, 1918, the New York Call, the
Socialist party's English language newspaper, reported
a large rent strike in the Brownsville section of _
Brooklyn. Tenants were doubling up and "threatening
to camp in the streets rather than submit to the unjust
demands of the landlord.” The Call's editor praised
the strike as a “forceful illustration of working class
solidarity”:

Entire blocks are being organized. The ousted

tenant is being welcomed with honors. No one

has any use for the woman who is submissive

and pays the rent.3
These first postwar rent strikes, like those in the
1890's were largely spontaneous. In the close-knit
Jewish communities, a landlord who refused to yield to
striking tenants might have to face condemnation by
respected leaders of his synagogue or fraternal or-
ganization, obstracization by his friends, loss of
patronage at his business, and verbal harassment and
even physical violence from his neighbors. In the
columns of the Call, we find the edifying tale of a
landlord named Katz who tried to break a rent strike
in a building he owned by hiring a band of thugs to
beat up the leaders of the tenants‘ committee, but who
was forced to yield to the tenants when they led a
successful boycott of his butcher shop down the
block. ‘ Even in the sacred confines of his synagogue,
the landlord was not safe from harassment by embattled
tenants. During the height of the strikes, 200
tenants stormed a Brownsville synagogue in the midst
of passover services to embarrass a number of landlords
in the congregation. The heroic deed was faithfully
reported in the Call:

 

Most of the pillars of the Ohev Shalom (Pillars
of Peace) congregation are landlords. The head
of the congregation is said to have evicted some

tenants Friday. He was reported to have
suffered some bruises in the excitement yester-
day when the tenants poured into the synagogue
crying, “Down with the services, stop raising
our rent.5

As the year went on, tenants began to develop"
more formal organizations for their protests. While
local action of the type just mentioned had some
success, it was clear that the housing crisis could
not be ended unless the city government and the
state legislature acted to reduce the immense legal
authority of the landlord over the tenant, which
gave him almost unlimited power to set rents, deter-
mine the length of/leases and evict allegedly un-
desirable tenants.0 In 1919, tenant unions and
tenant-protective associations were formed in
Brownsville, Williamsburg, Harlem, the Bronx and the
Lower East Side, to expand the scope of local actions
against landlords and to articulate tenants‘ demands
for government action.

The new tenants‘ associations were closely

.linked to the major progressive organizations in

the immigrant community--the socialist parties and
the labor movement--and their leaders were avowed
socialists who saw in the tenants’ revolts a mani-
festation of the new class consciousness that seemed
to have seized workers all over the world after the
war had ended. Their imaginations, like those of
most American radicals had been stirred by the
proletarian uprisings that the European War had un-
leashed, and every strike, every mass action, seemed
to herald capitalism's imminent fall. The
revolutionary impulse of the tenant leaders found
outlet in periodic attempts to organize mass action

on a citywide level to dramatize the tenants’ grievances.
In May of 1919, the Brooklyn Tenants Union threatened ;, s
to call a "general strike” involving the cooperative ‘
action of tenants leagues and labor unions, to focus
attention on housing problems.7 And in September of~
the same year, "socialist agitators,” according to the
mayor's Committee on Rent Profiteering, attempted to
organize a rent strike involving one million tenants.8
Neither of.these projects, however, were actually im-
plemented. The most “revolutionary” of the tenants
unions’ actions were the local rent strikes, which con-
tinued under their direction to be primarily a defensive
action designed to force landlords to retract rent in-
creases and stop eviction proceedings. The political
demands of the tenants were articulated through
traditional “democratic” means--petitioning, lobbying,
and organizing protest rallies--although the size of A
the-local rent strikes (the Brooklyn Tenants Union had
over 4000 tenants on strike in 1919) with their implied.
threat of massive disorder, added weight to the
petitioners‘ requests.

When the tenants unions were first organized, the
city administration, caught up in the public hysteria
about radicalism which the Bolshevik Revolution seemed
to have engendered in American society, tried to suppress
them. The Mayor's Committee on Rent Profiteering, A
organized to arbitrate disputes between tenants and
landlords, opened an investigation of the tenants’
movement with the warning that:

Bolshevism unrest and anarchy are increasing
rapidly because of the activities of these so-
called anti-rent societies and a stop must be
put to their work,9

and initiated a series of police raids on the local
tenants’ leagues. "Our meetings were broken up, our

members imprisoned, our offices raided, and our
executives given the third degree," declared Harlem
Tenants leader J. Louis Dubros in an interview with
the Ca1l.1O Municipal court judges joined in the
effort to break up the tenants leagues. A typical

‘judicial response to the rent strikes was that of

 

Magistrate Shraub, who closed a Brooklyn rent strike
case by ordering tenants to pay their rents and I
warned them that a second offense would bring them
jail sentences:

This appears to be nothing more than a case

of Bolshevism such as seems to be running

riot over the city at the present. You have
no right to prevent this landlord from running
his houses, or to prevent him from collecting
his rents. He is a taxpayer and through paying
taxes you are afforded police protection and a
good many other things. If I am informed by
him that you interfere with him in the slight-
est degree, I wi11.issue a warrant for you and
put you in jail.

Some judges were known to give pardons to tenants
who would inform on their 'radica1 leaders. A
Manhattan judge offered three members of the Harlem
Tenants League, convicted of conspiracy charges for
obstructing an eviction, lenient treatment if they
told him the names of the organizers of the tenants
leagues to which they be1onged.ll

’f§ilEd_§EE5EEt of the police raids can be found
in the issue of the Call from March 19, 1920,
which includes a speech made by a leader of the

tenants movement at a street rally in Brownsville:

"About a year ago,” he complained, “when tenants
began to offer resistance to profiteering land-
lords, the mayor issued a bill against such or-
ganizations, and threatened to send to jail all
the leaders of the movement. Many were sent to
jail, the municipal judges using their offices to
.smash_every rent strike.

Tm: ’}O\/ERNMENT'S SHIFT ,

The public authorities, however, did not succeed
in breaking the power of the tenants‘ movement. There
was a period of relative quiet after the police raids
in September and October of 1919, but agitation was re-
sumed with even greater energy in the early months of
the next year. The mayor, anxious to appease

.organized labor and prevent the strikes from growing

larger, sent a series of bills to the state legislature

designed to control rent gouging and prevent evictions.

In presenting these bills to the state legislature,
which was then considering the expulsion of its five
socialist members, city officials warned that their

A passage was necessary to prevent disorder from reach-

ing unmanageable proportions. If the legislature
were too doctrinaire to pass the ”socialistic” rent
control laws, Fiorello La Guardia (then a member of
the state legislature) declared, it might find itself
dominated by socialists after the next election:

Unless rapid relief legislation is passed, next
year a radical legislature might be debating
whether to allow five old party-men to sit in-
stead of a Republican and Democratic assembly
suspending five socialists...and when the hot

_ days of August have exhausted the people's
patience, the great body of citizens of New
York will refuse to pay any rent whatsoever.
Then what can you do? You can't disposses
every tenant in New York.

The rechanneling of discontent into a legal
framework seemed to undermine the power of the or-
ganized tenants movement. The local tenants leagues
suffered a rapid loss of membership once‘the rent laws
were passed and the Tenants Defense Union, the city-
wide coalition of Jewish organizations, fell apart
entirely, unable, in the face of widespread tenant
apathy, to develop a workable program for the achieve-
ment of its legislative goals. Tenants‘ leaders who
had expected a permanent organization to be forged in

vthe housing crisis were sorely disappointed. Within

in

was the same neighborhood, the reporter noted, where
2000 people, “chanting revolutionary anthems,” had
tried to stop the eviction of four tenants exactly
one year before. In celebrating one rent strike

victory, the Worker pointed with pride to the courage
that tenants had shown in resisting police attacks:

After a bloody battle with the police and the
eviction of a worker had failed to break the
organization of the rent strikers at Onlinville
Avenue, the landlord was forced to reduce the
rent on 2 room apartments by $2, on a 3-room
apartment by $2.50, and on four-room apartments
by $3...earlier in the day, police and detectives
brutally attacked an open-air meeting of the
tenants which was led by the Upper Bronx Un-
employed Council. Five workers were arrested
and a number injured.1h

The organization of striking tenants appears to
have largely been the work of the Communist Party.
Scornful of the legalistic tactics of the “old-guard
socialists” in the trade-unions and the Socialist
Party, it was willing to sponsor any kind of protest
activity to develop and encourage “class-conscious-
ness“, and it seized upon housing agitation as an
area in which it could assert its leadership in the
class struggle. In developing the rent strike as an
effective weapon for the unemployed to use in dealing
with their housing problems, the Party filled a
vacuum of leadership in the Jewish community, which
the socialists, now hostile to ‘mass action , had
left. In its coverage of the rent strikes, the Daily
Worker proudly reported several instances where party
workers had won over buildings from socialist or-
ganizers who had tried to convince tenants to fight
their landlords in court.l5 Sometimes, the landlords
themselves were socialists. The Worker told of a
rent strike in the building of a Socialist landlord,
"who was a member of the Workman's circle and several
democratic clubs.”13 “This socialist landlord,” the

article declared, “is most rabid in his attacks on
the workers, egging on the police to break up the
meetings of the rent striking tenants and threaten-
ing blood baths against the tenants.”

After 1933, these rent strikes appear to have-
subsided, despite the growth of a powerful tenants

A movement in the city. The liberalization of the

city's eviction policies,17 combined with the
gradual extension of welfare services by the state
and federal governments, made the problems of ten-
ants far less acute and unsettling than they had
been in 1931-32 when the rent strikes were most
common. There was not the same sense of urgency
that there was in the earlier period and the new
tenants organizations which grew up after 1933 con-

rcentrated on the development of a stable tenants

movement capable of being a continuing source of
pressure for enlightened government intervention in
the housing field. The Citywide Tenants Union, an
organization which eventually included twenty-four
affiliated tenant leagues in different sections of
the city, emphasized the use of lobbying and public
demonstration to arouse support for reform legisla;
tion-18 Its local chapters, which tried to develop
a stable network of tenants‘ councils in the1*
neighborhoods where they worked, used the rent strike
to influence landlords only when all other forms of
pressure had failed, and then, only for ends which
could be supported in court. They regarded the rent
strike as an extremely dangerous form of protest, to
be used only when tenant unity was high, and

zations, who were part of the United Front
Committee Against Evictions, the Mayor issued a
directive to CTU marshals ordering them to delay-
eviction until the Emergency House Relief
Bureau could find adequate shelter for the
evicted tenant.

extensive legal aid available. Before a rent strike
could be organized in a particular building, the action
had to be approved by a strike committee of the central
body, presumably to prevent hasty action which might
harm the reputation of the organization. These careful
precautions regarding the rent strike's use prevented
it from ever attaining the status of a protest movement
under the Council's direction. From l9hO to 1933, rent
striaes continued to play a limited role within the

‘ larger freamework of tenants‘ agitation. The tenants’

T organizations became highly specialized during this

; period, both on a local and a city—wide level, with

t a limited array of tactics, and a legalistic, down-
to—earth way of doing things. The massive rent strike
that arose in Harlem in 1953, with its extravagant

aims and messianic rhetoric, caught them entirely by

a; surprise.

Despite the continued decay of the slum areas,
only partially offset by the construction of low-
income public housing, it required the impetus of
the Civil Rights Movement to transform passive re-
sentment into active protest. Inspired by the mood
of growing militancy which the March on Washington
both reflected and negated, several CORE chapters H
had begun, in the summer of 1953, to apply the tac-.
tics of non-violent direct action to the field of C

’ housing. Brooklyn CORE started with a campaign to

pressure the city into enforcing the existing housing
code. It taught tenants how to file forms with the
buildings department to set the code enforcement
machinery into operation, and it picketed the homes
and businesses of landlords who refused to yield to
tenant demands. Two college chapters, NYU CORE and
Columbia CORE, also formed “housing Committees” and
began to organize slum tenants in Harlem and the‘
Lower East Side. The Columbia Chapter, like the

I We repeat for our new readers that RADICAL AMERICA
is an outgrowth of a program in the Radical Education
Project of the Students for a Democratic Society. The
editors hold that the lessons of the American radical
past are critical for the development of the New Left.
We hope to stimulate an intensified study of radical
history by students of the field, and a far greater
interest among SDS rank—and-filers concerning thesev
subjects. We look to cooperation with other genera-
tions of American Leftists and hope that the realiza-
tion of our shared tradition will help bring the best
of the ”Old‘ and “New” Left together.

These rent strikes_won the approval of James
Farmer, the national director of CORE. On November 9,
in a statement to the “Amsterdam News‘ he declared that
“the rent strike had proved an effective weapon,” and
urged that “more of them be employed by tenants having
problems with indifferent slumlords.”2O A week later,
he warned of a “citywide rent strike with up to ten
thousand tenants on strike if slum conditions are not
cleared up,” and predicted that the civil rights drive
in the city would be stepped up on all fronts after
the first of the year.

ENTER JESSE GRAY

Although Farmer's prediction of a citywide rent
strike proved to be accurate, the initiative for it
did not come from CORE but from a 38-year old Harlem
tenants leader named Jesse Gray. For ten years, Gray
had been trying to do what CORE chapters had only now
begun to think about--organize a mass movement in the
ghetto around the issues which mattered most to the ‘
lower class Negro——-poor housing, unemployment, police
brutality. A longtime radical expelled from the
National Maritime Union for his left-wing associations,
he had begun his work in Harlem with a revolutionary
dream. But the response to his agitation was unen-
thusiastic, and instead of a mass movement, he was
able to develop only a small tenants organization on
a few blocks in Central Harlem called the “Community
Council on Housing.“ In October of l953, at the head
of a protest march on city hall which he had organized,
Gray threatened to lead a political rebellion of Harlem
tenants unless the city acted to take over buildings
with longstanding violations and meted out stiffer
punishments to landlords. “The Wagner administration
has proved that it is unable to handle the housing
problem,‘ Gray was quoted as saying, “and we don't
want him to come up to Harlem to ask for votes.”2l’

Immediately after this protest march which drew
2OO tenants, Gray decided to organize a rent strike in

the Central Harlem buildings he had been working in.
The stimulus for this decision, made, apparently,
with little preparation (there had been no mention of
a rent strike at the protest parade), was the growing
militancy that Gray's followers had been showing at
meetings and protest rallies since the end of the
summer. Tenants who had once meekly accepted Gray's
aid with their buildings department forms, were now'
demanding dramatic action to get repairs. “The

’people,” Gray told the Amsterdam News, “are much

more conscious than ever of the slum conditions in
which they are ready to listen to an agitator who
tells them not to be frightened by eviction no-
tices.”22 After one week of organizing, Gray claim-
ed, he was able to place l6 buildings on strike.

The Community Council on Housing, when it began
the strike, was a small, informally run operation
that teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. ‘It depended
for its support on a combination of membership dues,
which were rare in coming, and private contributions
from wealthy radicals. Aside from Gray, who managed
to eke out a meager salary from its treasury, there
were four men who served as organizers, only one of
whom, Major Williams, worked full time. Gray, more-
over, could expect very little help from the tenant
members of the council in organizing the strike.
Most of them were women, who would join a picket
line or give a small contribution to the Council's
treasury, but who were content to leave the forma-
tion of strategy and the organization of buildings
to Gray and his aides. Despite these disadvantages,
Gray was able to almost triple the number of build-
ings on strike during the month of November. In the
few blocks that he had organized before, the re-
sponse to his message was enthusiastic, and the only
limit on the speed of organization seemed to be the
time that was required to explain the mechanics of
the strike. There were buildings in Central Harlem
where the name "Jesse Gray” would open any door. In

the neighborhood where he had lived and worked for ten
years, Gray, by countless hours of unpaid service, had
built up'a remarkable reserve of trust. Like the
Democratic district leaders in the old immigrant
quarters, Gray was the man people called upon when they
were in trouble with the welfare department, the police,
or any of the other huge and confusing bureaucracies
with which they were dependent for their survival.

In early December, at a mass rally held at the
Milbank Community Center near Mount Morris Park, Gray
announced the results of November‘s organizing. Ten-
ants in 34 tenements, he_declared, had joined the
strike, raising the number of buildings participating
to 52. The rent strike, he proclaimed jubilantly, had
become a mass movement, “with almost 3000 persons
ready to participate in the action.*23 It was time
for tenants to “take their case downtown!..and serve
notice to Mayor Wagner and other city officials not to

,come up to Harlem at election time.”

_ The political implications of a mass movement
under Gray's leadership were not lost to Harlem's
established political leaders. Men like Adam Clayton
Powell, Huelan Jack, and Lloyd Dickens, who had never
shown much zeal in demanding housing reform, quickly
announced their support of the rent strike. Rev.
Powell, with characteristic flamboyance, declared at a
rally in the middle of December that he "would dump
the Democratic Party if no action is taken to remove
the blight from the Negro community and called for a
‘march on city hall if.the city failed to take over the
struck buildings.‘2 Fifteen church and civic groups,
represented at the same rally, pledged their support
to the rent strikers and formed a coordinating commit-
tee to help extend the strike to other parts of Harlem.
The voices were angry and the spirits were high. “The
bells toll, the drums roll,” Adam Powell exulted,
“Harlem is on the March again.“ ‘

Gray seemed almost intoxicated by the community

solidarity that had been manifested at the rally. He’

began to see a citywide movement emerging from the
small strike that he had started in Central Harlem.
The great power blocs of the Harlem community, the
ministers and the politicians, were lining up behind
the strike, and CORE groups in Brooklyn and the Lower
East Side were already beginning to organize their
locales. "If our plans materialize,” he told a Times
reporter two days after the rally, "we will have lOOO
buildings on strike by the first of the year. We
hope, by means of a citywide rent strike, to force a
mass rehabilitation of the slums.“2

NEW FACES

In these last frantic days of December, some new
faces appeared in the Community Council's cluttered

‘office. On the morning of December 27, while the

Community Council's staff nervously awaited the re-
sults of the first court case, a well-dressed white
man with a brusque manner walked into Gray's office,
and asked “how he could help the movement.”27 He
had read about the rent strike in the newspapers, he
said, and had come to the conclusion that it was the
first significant radical movement in New York since
the l930's. He was rich, had executive experience
and had many powerful friends in the “liberal

.community“. What could he do? After a long dis-

cussion with this man, who, it turned out, had been
president of one of the largest smelting and refin-
ing companies in the United States, Gray decided to
put him in charge of the rent strike’s public
relations”. He was to take over all of the Council's
dealings with the “white community”, from fund rais-
ing to press relations, leaving Gray free to concen-
trate on extending the strike in Harlem. But he was
to remain completely anonymous, so that no stories

~ about a “white man behind the rent strike‘ would be

publicly circulated.

,Mr. Levin, as we shall call this man, did an extra-
ordinarily effective job of publicizing the strike.
Before he came, the rent strike was known among the
rather exoteric group of people whom it affected
directly---Harlem tenants, and politicians, city hous-
ing officials, civil rights workers, and the landlords.
There had been five articles on the rent strike before
December 28, but they had been hidden away in the back
pages, and had not attracted much public notice. _
After Levin began work, however, articles on the rent
strike began to appear regularly on the front pages of
.every major newspaper in New York except the Daily
News, and stories on it were written in Newsweek, Time,
and the Saturday Evening Post. Appearances were
arranged for Jesse Gray and other rent strike leaders
on local and national television. The rent strike, for
a time, became the all important local political
issue, and the cause celebre of the civil rights move-
ment in the North. ~ . ' a

Mr. Levin had no experience in public relations
work to refer to in his new job. But the self-con-
fidence and ability to deal with people that his
executive training had given him, were sufficient to
make him a success. His method was simple: he would
call up reporters on the various newspapers who
covered civil rights news and invite them down to
Harlem to speak to Jesse_and inspect the buildings
that were on strike. For many of the reporters who
came down, the experience was overwhelming, at'once
frightening and humbling. Even-for men hardened by
years of reporting wars, murders and riots, the sight
of a family shivering in a heatless tenement while the
temperature outside was eight degrees, of a mother
treating the rat—bites on her four-year old child,

- could not be borne calmly. Homer Bigart, the Pulitzer
. Prize winning Times reporter came out of one striking

building quivering with anger. The tenants in the
building had no heat and no water---because the build-
ing had no boiler, and the inspection report from the

‘buildings department listed no violations. “This is
vthe worst thing I've seen in all my years of report-

ing,f he told Levin, “I'll write anything you wantl"

 

 

 

23
Meanwhile, Gray warned,

.The concept that the Negro'is going to explode
in the summer, when it's hot, man you know
that's a farce. ‘Harlem is going to explode
right now in the cold...We have been in touch
with Detroit and Chicago. we hope the impact
of Harlem will spread over the country.2

Gray seemed to articulate the feeling of every poor
Harlemite when he declared: "Nothing is being done
we might as well have a rat mayor.”29

AND THE CITY

»A barrage of criticism came down upon a Wagner
Administration that was quite unnerved by the con-
flicting political pressures that the movement had
.unleashed.3O Since the rent strike had begun, city
officials had desperately sought ways to prevent it
from spreading without spoiling their liberal image
or offending powerful civil rights leaders. The
city's policy began to take form as early as December
1, when the rent strike was still localized on a few
blocks in Central Harlem. A committee of 33 city
officials, chaired by Robert Low, the city councilman
from the district where the rent strike had broken
out met on that day and suggested that the city speed,
inspections in the Harlem area, take more buildings
into receivership and add more personnel to the
buildings department staff.3l The Mayor rapidly
acted on these suggestions.

Finally on January 5, after a hurried consulta-
tion with some of the rent strike's lawyers, Wagner

announced a new housing policy designed to identify him
with the progressive forces demanding housing reform.
In a seven—page statement to the press, he announced
that he was sending a bill to Albany to legalize rent
strike and initiating a “pocket book attack on the
slumlords.” He was going to “step up pressure for
maximum fines and jail sentences for violations affect-
ing health and safety, press the legislature for mini-
mum fines and jail sentences for housing violations,
increase the inspection force of the buildings depart-
ment by 35, and try to close the time between reports
ofta violation and official action to correct it, urge
the creation of special housing courts in Queens and
the Bronx, and ask for a study of the city's housing
and health codes, aimed at the elimination of duplica-
tion both in the codes and in the city's inspection
service."32

This program, impressive as it sounded, was
greeted with profound skepticism by proponents of

‘ housing reform. R. Peter Straus, the president of

WMCA, who had been leading a slum cleanup campaign
known as “Call to Action”, called the Mayor's proposal
a“lot of hot air‘ and pointed out that the city had

'“plenty of authority to make improvements under the

present laws.“33 In a devastating column entitled

“How Not to Fight the Slumlords,' Woody Klein enumerati 2

ed all the occasions that Mayor Wagner, in his various
capacities as a public official had “declared war on
the slumlords” (there were 1H) and asserted that the
new program was nothing more than a warmed over version
of past promises, with the possible exception of legal-
izing rent strikes.3 The Wagner Administration, it

social problems in the city, is beautifully con-
veyed by Klein's column, as the following abstracts
illustrate:

bility for the “safety, comfort and very lives”
of New York Tenants. In l9h8, as chairman of the
City Planning Commission, he called for a bold
:t- program to clean up slums and meet the housing

_- . crisis... _

In 1959, he announced that housing was the

\3 city's No. 1 problem and made public a program,
which, he said, had been ”sweated out for months.”
;e » It called for rent reductions, stiffer court

I fines and more inspections.

In l960, Wagner renewed his pledge to step
.- ‘ up the housing program and boasted: "We are doing
I more, I believe, than the rest of the country
combined.”

In l96l, the Mayor announced a "massive.
attack on slums and a six-point program to help
tenants."

In l962, at a public hearing, he vowed to
. ,_ drive slumlords out of business in a new war on
1 . the real estate villains. He called for more
and tougher weapons and promised to_”press
vigorously” against the tenement speculator.

_ In I963, he predicted that New York would-be
t- p ' a ”slumless” city in 50 years.

Also in 1963, after a meeting with the late
President Kennedy in Washington, Wagner declared:
“I am determined that adequate means shall be
an I7 developed to enable us to mount a new and ever
L- p" more effective attack on slum conditions.”

' And in June of 1963, in an announcement
billed as a major policy shift, he pledged a
seven—point program to “hit the slumlords where
it hurts---in the pocketbook.”

He also called for more vacate orders,
stiffer enforcement of the receivers program and
twice-a-year inspections of all old tenements.

was clear, was not willing to commit itself to the
massive rehabilitation of the slums without a signifi-
cant increase in the pressures on it from the white

. and the Negro community. The fundamental question was
---could the rent strike provide these pressures,
whether through the use of massive civil disobedience,
or the threat of a political revolt of slum tenants?

GMASS MOVEMENP'STUMBLES

VIn early December, when the Community Council was
beginning to make plans to turn the rent strike into a
“mass movement”, it was counting on extensive coopera-
tion from civil rights groups and civic organizations
within the Harlem community. The initial response of
such groups had been enthusiastic; fifteen Harlem or-
ganizations, including block associations, church
groups, Democratic clubs and a labor union (Local ll99
of the Drug and Hospital Workers) had joined a co?
ordinating committee set up by Gray to extend the
strike. Gray's expectations of support, however,
proved to be over-optimistic. /AS December came to a
close, and the rent strike began to make the front
ppages of the daily newspapers, the Community Council's
organizers were struggling to extend the strike in
Harlem almost entirely unaided. The fifteen Harlem
civic groups who supported the strike gave Gray some
money and helped publicize the movement in the com;
munity, but did not provide what the rent strike need-
ed most to become a mass movement---manpower--eto
organize buildings, to run the office, to keep up con-
tact with the striking tenants and advise them on
legal matters. They were content to remain patrons of
the strike rather than full partners. In the begins

‘ ning of January, the bulk of the organization was ,
still being done by the same 7-1O workers from the i
Community Council and the Northern Students Movement. ”
The strike expanded to involve 100 buildings, far K

short of the lOOO which Gray had predicted.

  

The major national offices of the civil rights
groups, moreover, did not reply at all to the Harlem
rent strike's pleas for assistance. James Farmer of

 

 

 

 

27

CORE refused to comment on the tactic as soon as it
became publicly identified with the work of Jesse
Gray,35 and the Community Council received neither
organizational help, nor financial aid from CORE.
The NAACP‘s Central Harlem chapter, under Reverend
Hildebrand, told its members to participate in the
strike, and contributed money to the Community
Council's treasury, but its national office remain-
ed cold to the movement. Roy Wilkins refused to
answer calls from Gray's press agent, and made no
reference to the rent strike in his public state-
ments.

BUT THE ACTIVISTS RESPOND

The hostility of the established civil rights
leaders to the rent strike, however, did not accur-
ately mirror the feeling of the rank and file of the
city's civil rights groups. Jesse Gray's initial
successes in organizing the people of Harlem, exag-
gerated and glorified by a ”muckraking" press, cap-
tured the imagination of young civil rights acti-
vists around the city, activists who were
unacquainted with Gray's radical background. One
after another, local CORE groups in the city dropped’
their other activities and began to organize rent
strikes in their districts. The Brooklyn chapter,
which had been organizing tenants since the summer,-
placed its first buildings on strike on December 1,
and had a number of cases in court before the end
of the month.’ Downtown CORE and Columbia CORE,

35. From the middle of December on, James Farmer
did not make a single statement on the subject
of the rent strike, although he had himself
advocated a citywide rent strike earlier in the
year. In February, moreover, when interviewed
by The Saturday Evening Post about problems of
the civil rights movement, he declared at the
~outset that he would answer no questions re-
lating to the rent strike and to Jesse Gray.

 

    

Studies on the left: R.1.P.

The socialist principle that institutions should
cease to exist when they no longer advance the cause
of the revolution is repeatedly violated by the left
in the United States. All existing parties on the
left, and most radical publications, continue to
function only because they provide jobs or status to
their leaders and the illusion of historical rele-
vance to a small and relatively stable following.
Studies on the Left escaped that fate. It came into
being to help develop theory for a new popular
socialist movement in the United States. It made a
substantial contribution in that direction and helped
create conditions that require something more than a
journal like Studies. Further theoretical develop-
ment now depends on organized involvement in real
politics. But there was no consensus among the
editors on what strategy to pursue. So we ceased
publishing.

THE ROLE OF STUDIES

In the seven years during which Studies was
published a new left came into being in the United
States. It did so in response to several features
of advanced American capitalism -- the continuing
semi—colonial status of Negroes, the emptiness and
boredom of ”affluence,‘ the neo—colonial war in
Vietnam, the commercialization of all aspects of
life, the stream of lies about the purpose and

 

28

which had been operating small housing programs which
worked through city agencies, dropped their reformist
approach and began to organize rent strikes early in
January. And Bronx CORE and East River CORE, which
had been devoting most of their time to “employment”
campaigns, began rent strikes of their own in February.

With the possible exception of the Brooklyn groups,
these CORE chapters entered the rent strike with only
the vaguest notions of what they were trying to
accomplish and the most limited experience with ten-
ants organization and housing law. The young activists
who composed the bulk of these organizations were re-
sponding more to the general sense of excitement which
surrounded the rent strike, than to the appeal of a
well-thought-out strategy of action. The headlines in
the_press, the radio broadcasts, the mass meetings and
the leafleting campaigns, created what those who exper-
ienced it called a “rent strike fever”, an extra-
ordinary sense of exhiliration and even of historic
destiny that drew people to the movement as the in-
itiator of a new stage in the civil rights movement. ‘
The excitement reached its height at a mass meeting
held in Harlem on January ll. A crowd of eight hun-
dred people, composed of Harlem tenants and representa-
tives of almost every civil rights group and tenants
organization in the city heard a group of prominent
speakers, including James Baldwin, William Fitts Ryan,
Jesse Gray and John Lewis tell them to spread the rent
strike to other parts of the city. “At this Meeting,“
one leader of a student CORE group told me, “everyone
caught the fever—-Rent Strike. No one knew about the
legal consequences, or the amount of work involved. It
seemed like the thing to do ..the only way to beat the

landlord.” ‘

In addition, Mobilization for Youth, a federally
sponsored social work project trying to encourage
social action among low—income people on the Lower
East Side saw in the mass movement that Gray seemed to
Abe developing a model well worth imitating. Through-
out December, MFY's directorate worked to devise a way
to sponsor a successful rent strike on the Lower East

 

 

 

29

ySide without offending the political interests upon

which it depended for its funds. To be successful,
they believed, a rent strike on the Lower East Side
would have to be as militant and vocal as the strike
in Harlem, it would have to attack the city govern-
ment as well as the landlords. But if MFY organized
such a rent strike, it might jeopardize its exis-
tence, for the use of government funds to organize
protests against the government was then hardly_an ‘

‘officially sanctioned mode of “community organiza-

tion.” They decided to organize the rent strike be-
hind a ”smokescreen” of small community groups set up
by MFY and provided with paid “organizers”. In late
December and early January, MFY officials organized

groups of tenants, gave them storefronts and opera- '‘

ting expenses and assigned to them paid community

workers---neighborhood people on MFY's payroll who
had experience in the civil rights movement;-éwho

were to do most of the work connected with the

_strike. In addition, they contacted tenants organi-

zations, civil rights groups and social fraternal
organizations (such as the Congress of Puerto Rican
Organizations), which had organized rent strikes or
expressed interest in them and-asked them to join
with the newly formed “tenants” groups in a co- _
ordinated rent strike on the Lower East Side that
would be partially subsidized by MFY's funds. The
invitations were accepted, and on January 11, ll
organizations, representing the most diverse social
and political perspectives one could imagine,3 met

at MFY headquarters and agreed to work together to
create a massive rent strike on the Lower East Side.

GRAY AND COORDINATION

The task of coordinating these local rent strikes
and giving them a unified political impact proved to
be a difficult one. While there was considerable
sharing of information about methods of organization
and an effective coordination of legal services, there
was no successful attempt to define the goals of the
movement on a citywide level and to devise tactics in
which members of the participating organizations could
effectively combine their energies. Much of the move-
ment's potential for coordinated action was debilita-
ted in power struggles between leaders of the various
rent—striking groups. Perhaps the main axis of con-
flict was between Jesse Gray and the Metropolitan
Council on Housing, a federation of housing organiza-
tions formed in the middle fifties to protect rent
control and organize support for the construction of
low—income housing. Early in the strike, the Met
Council, whose leaders regarded themselves as “experts”
on the political dimensions of housing problems, made
tentative efforts to set itself up as a clearinghouse
for rent strike information and to incorporate the
rent strike into its own legislative campaigns. It
invited Jesse Gray to become the leader of a citywide
rent strike coordinating committee, which it proposed
to establish. Gray, however, rejected their offer.

He did not want his leadership of the movement diluted
by what he called a “white middle—class organization.”
After ten years of organizing without recognition, he
was not willing to share his newly won prestige with
an organization that he regarded as being out of touch
with the rising spirit of race consciousness and
nationalism in the black ghettos.

He decided, thus, to coordinate the movement him-
self. He spoke at rallies in behalf of groups organi-
zing rent strikes in all parts of the city, and had
numerous private conferences with rent strike leaders
to discuss with them techniques of tenants

 
 

 

31

organization and related problems of housing law.
And in the press conferences and news broadcasts
which his press agent arranged for him, he drama-
tized the slum conditions which gave rise to the
strike and the movements'immediate aims in a force-
ful and ominous way, setting off a wave of short
term reforms by the city before the strike had even
approached its projected strength. On February 12,
rent strike leaders were invited to_a mass meeting
in Harlem to form a Citywide Committee for Decent
Housing, which would coordinate protest to force the
city and state governments to act against the slums.
At this meeting, Gray put on one of his better per-
formances. In a colorful speech, he called for a
March on Albany to “remind Governor Rockefeller that
Central Harlem and areas like it are part of the

"state of New York and that he should stop trying to‘

avoid his responsibility by blaming others all the
time for the terrible housing conditions.”37 He
angrily assailed city officials, asserting that
Mayor Wagner was “spineless,” and his chief housing
expert, Julius C. Edelstein “was a sorry creature.”
“To get housing code enforcement in the city,” Gray
concluded, "citizens had to plead, pray, beg, and
hold special church services.” Other speakers
joined the orgy of angry rhetoric. Rev. Browne,
leader of the Stryker's Bay Tenants Council, and a
strong supporter of the Harlem rent strike, called
for a long fight against the enemies of public
housing, and declared that Governor Rockefeller
headed “the list og finks because he has no low rent
housing program. 3 But when the speeches ended,
only two proposals for direct action, and rather
mild ones at that, were ratified by the delegates--
to join the March on Albany for a $1.50 minimum wage
with a tenants parade to demand code enforcement and
the construction of more public housing, and to be-
gin a "Rats to Rockefeller Campaign,“ which con-
sisted of.a drive to send rubber rats to the Governor

~37. The New York Times, February l6, l95h, p. 59.

-38. Ibid., p. 59.

32 

along with form letters from tenants urging the
Governor to support legislation to provide emergency
repairs in slum housing.

The hopes voiced by the strike's leaders a few
months before, that the movement would mobilize the
population of the ghettos for mass action to force a
comprehensive rehabilitation of the slums seemed
strangely remote from the debate now taking place--the
proposals ratified were an extension of the “responsible”
methods that tenants organization had engaged in for
years without bringing basic changes in the conditions
‘of the homes. There was no initiative (from Gray or
anyone else) for a drive to force public authorities
to commit themselves to a systematic program of slum
rehabilitation that would make use of the disruptivev
powers of the black masses. Gray was the man everyone
looked to for leadership, but he seemed unable to visualize a
way of maintaining the militancy of the Harlem move-
ment within the context of a coalition of groups. His
rejection of the Metropolitan Council on Housing as
comfortable and middle class seemed ironic indeed, for
the new “militant” coordinating group that he had
formed began by appropriating its methods. The irony
was apparent even to Gray. At future meetings of the
"citywide committee for decent housing,“ Gray himself,
involved in a campaign against the police in Harlem,’
rarely showed up. a

In the last weeks of February, the aura of
cataclysmic power that had surrounded the rent strike
in its early days had largely faded away. The press
seemed to lose interest in the movement. Reporters no
longer anxiously kept track of Gray's predication of
how large the strike was going to get, and muckraking
articles about slum conditions and inefficiencies of
the buildings department seemed to go out of fashion.
From February 11 onward, no article dealing with the“
strike appeared on the front page of the Times. The
city government ceased issuing promises to appease the
mOvements'leaders and the aroused conscience of the
public. The Mayor's last dramatic gesture to the

 

  

33

strike came on February 8, when he announced the be-
ginning of a one million dollar anti-rat campaign to
help rid the slums of pestilence.

While the public authorities resumed their‘
habitual complacence toward slum conditions, the rent
strike leaders found their attention pulled further
and further away from political questions. There was
a clear shift in perspective of the rent strikes from
citywide to a local level in this period, and a
growing concern with legal and technical problems
that had been ignored in the beginning of the strike.
The mass meetings in Harlem which had confirmed and
inspired the high aspirations of the movement, were
now held infrequently and had poor attendence. In
many parts of the city, indeed, the rent strike be-
gan to resemble a social service operation rather
than a militant protest.

THE COURTS AND THE MOVEMENT

The Community Council on Housing had entered
the strike without clearly defining its attitude
toward the legal system. It did not have much con-
fidence in the legal process through which striking‘
tenants could get repairs (section 755 of the
buildings code) but it was unwilling to boycott the
courts entirely, for it had promised tenants that
there would be no evictions. In the early stages of
the strike, the organizers had paid only perfunctory
attention to the legal procedures required to win a
"755"--which included filing forms for inspections
with the buildings department; checking that viola;
tions were actually recorded after inspections} and
subpoenaing records for the court——they were trying
to get buildings on strike quickly to give the move-
ment political leverage. In many cases, observers
noted, organizers simply called a meeting of tenants,
told them to stop paying rent and left, reminding
them to call the Community Council's office when

_they received a disposses.

The confusion of the organizers about the role
court action would play in the movement was increased

by two favorable but conflicting decisions handed down
by lower court magistrates in late December. On
December 30, in the first court decision affecting the
Harlem rent strikes39 Judge Guy Gilbert Ribaudo
ordered 13 striking tenants in two Harlem tenements to
pay rent into court until the landlord repaired out-

. standing violations, asserting that conditions in the

buildings were "shocking, and should be repaired as
soon as possible.” 0 This reaffirmation-of the
applicability of 755 was accompanied by a statement
declaring that the court did not condone rent strikes;
it was illegal for the tenants to withold rent except
in cases involving “real and so called constructive
eviction and where hazardous violations exist.”41 One
week later, however, a decision was handed down in a
Brooklyn court which went far beyond Judge Ribaudo's
dictum and broke down many of the guidelines which the
organizers had set after the earlier decision. Judge
Fred Moritt, after hearing the case of five striking
tenants who argued that their living quarters were not
fit for human habitation ruled that “any act or de-
fault on the part of the landlord which deprives the
tenant of the beneficial enjoyment of his premises,
constitutes, in the eyes of the law, an eviction. A
wrongful eviction, by the landlord, whether partial or
total, has an effect of terminating the tenant's
liability for rent.” 2 This meant, he later explained
that in "extreme cases, the landlord is not entitled
to any rent until the conditions are remedied .

If it takes the landlord two years to make the re-
pairs, he gets no rent for two years. Period.”43
This decision, which was not based upon section 755,
differed from Judge Ribaudo's in two significant re-
spects; it did not require the tenants to pay their i

rent into court, and it did not entitle the landlord
to back rents for the period that the violations were
in existence. '

Both the Ribaudo and Moritt decisions seemed to
suggest that the movement could get repairs for in-
dividual tenants through court action. But neither
decision, as it turned out was representative of the
kind of treatment the strike was to receive in the
housing courts. Once cases began to appear in large
enough numbers to be free of publicity, the housing
court judges, a breed notorious for their subser-
vience to the party machines, showed strong re-
sistance to the use of the court as an agency to
supervise repairs. In some cases, judges made no
attempt to hide their contempt for the tenants and
their opposition to the rent strike, and didn't try
to separate their legal arguments from their personal
biases. But more common was a strict adherance to
legal technicalities on the part of "objective"
judges, which, given the nature of the housing laws
and the peculiar problems_of the low-income person
in a court situation, proved to be a frustrating and
confusing barrier to effective action.

In the housing courts, it was common, for
example, to grant parties in the case adjournments,
when their cases were not sufficiently prepared or

. relevant witnesses such as buildings department in-

spectors were absent. when low-income people were a
party to the case, the seemingly innocent power of
adjournment took on new importance--the power to ad-
journ was the power to destroy. For most of the
striking tenants, living on the edge of subsistence

~burdened by economic and familiar responsibilities,

a court appearance was a major sacrifice which had
to be arranged far in advance by the organizer. If
after extensive planning and preparation, and the
loss of a day's salary on the part of the tenants,
the result was only adjournment, the tenants,
generally anxious and fearful to begin with, might

to arouse popular consciousness of these developments.
‘But it did examine and explain their underlying

T It identified welfare state liberalism as the political

century, and, tﬁéreforéj as the dominant political
ideology in the United States. 2) It began the process
of orienting socialist thought toward the problem of
building a post-industrial socialism.

The development of these two sets of ideas are
central in making possible a serious revolutionary
movement in the United States. The first is the key.
to understanding the American political economy.‘ The
second is essential to‘a strategy of social revolution
in this country, It distinguishes clearly between the

States and in the agrarian countries where successful

The limited acceptance of the ideas about post:_

gains of the strike were worth the price of the dis-
ruption it wrought in their personal lives. Landlords,
fully aware of the subversive effects of adjournments
on the morale of a tenants committee, would often pur-
posely leave their cases unprepared, or demand that
new witnesses be called in, who were not present at
the first hearing. Many judges, insensitive to the
differential impact of the adjournment on landlord and
tenants, would grant the landlord's request and become
an unconscious party to his harassment--others, no
doubt, less innocent in their intentions saw in this an
inconspicuous and “safe” way of frustrating a movement
they despised.

In addition, the civil court judges interpreted
755 in a way that made it difficult_for all but the
most carefully briefed tenants committee to win a case.
Virtually without exception, they rejected the proce-
dures of the Moritt decision; they would only accept
as evidence “violations of record" subpoenaed from the
buildings department. When tenants offered verbal
testimony about conditions in the building or photo-
graphs of violations, they were told that such informa-
tion would not affect the outcome of the case. This
meant, in effect, that the strikers were dependent on
the cumbersome and quite fallible machinery of the

buildings department at every point in the strike; they

had to get an early inspection, make sure that the
inspector took down relevant violations, see-whether

.they were actually recorded at the Hall of Records

(which cost two dollars and required a trip downtown)
and subpoena the inspection sheet from the Hall of
Records on the day of the trial.

The organizations sponsoring the rent strike soon
learned that the only way to get inspections on a
workable basis was to put pressure on high officials
of the buildings department for an arrangement that
entirely bypassed bureaucratic channels. Gray had
done that early in the strike, and was able to get on
the spot inspections in Harlem buildings merely by
making a telephone call. But even so, there were

 

39

problems in arranging the mechanics of an inspection.
At the time of day when the inspector arrived, most
of the tenants in the building could be out, and
only a fraction of the violations would be recorded.
It was necessary to arrange a time for inspection
mutually agreeable to inspector and tenant, but city
laws didn't make room for such an arrangement. The
inspector would often arrive unannounced and find
most of the tenants absent or unwilling to let him
in. Moreover, there was no guarantee that the vio-
lations would be recorded once the inspection was
made. Inspectors were notoriously corrupt and amen-
able to bribes, and would often slant their inspec-
tion reports to favor the landlord. Finally, there
were huge delays in recording the violations once
they were reported by the inspector. At the build-
ings department computer which processed inspection
reports, inﬁﬁrmation was held up for 13 working days
by backlog.

THE FAILURE OF LEGALISM _

‘It was common thus, for striking tenants to

~ appear in court without buildings department records

to back up their cases, or with records which did not
truly reflect the nature of the conditions in their
building. Judges, using a "strict construction” of
the doctrine of constructive eviction, would declare
that the evidence presented was insufficient to

’ warrant issuing a 755, and would order the tenants

to give back rents to the landlords and resume
regular payment. Such a decision, the “final order”

greeted a large number of the striking tenants
whose cases appeared in court. The lower East Side
Rent Strike was losing three-fifths of its cases
during March and April, and improved its performance
only slightly later on. None of the other rent
striking organizations seem to have done much-better.
The one exception was Brooklyn CORE, which found the
Brooklyn courts more responsive to tenants interests
than those in other boroughs.

E5. The New York Times, January 21, 1964, p. l.

 

ho

Even when the judges actually granted a 755, it
was by no means certain that conditions in the building
would be significantly improved. As the law was inter-
preted, the landlord was only required to correct
violations recorded on Buildings Department forms.
Since these records were often incomplete because of-
inefficient or corrupt inspections, some of the worst
.violations in the struck buildings were declared out-
side of the court's jurisdiction. In addition, the
procedures which the court used to enforce its order
were often unreliable. To receive his rent, the land-
lord had to establish to the judges‘satisfaction that
he had removed, or would remove all violations of re-
cord. But most judges were reluctant to assume the
responsibility of acting as a fulltime administrator of
repairs, and tried to get the parties to settle out of’
court as quickly as possible. In cases where a building

.required extensive remodeling to meet the standards of

_the court, they were prone to grant the landlord a
trial period after which he would receive his rent if

he made a reasonable percentage of the repairs. But all
too often, such trial periods served as an excuse to
end jurisdiction, and landlords were able to stop re-
pairs with impunity when they came to a halt.

There were many instances, where a “court victory”
for the rent strike resulted in token repairs. Even if
administered by men with the best of intentions——which
it was not--the court system was poorly designed to
supervise a massive program of repairs in slum housing.
For the rent strike groups, taking a case to court was
like piloting a ship through a minefield: at any
moment, a hidden obstacle could appear and destroy the
whole effort. The organizers, led by the early course
of the movement to expect a “revolutionary” transforma-
tion of the slum environment, found their energies
absorbed in legal preparations which yielded intermit-
tent and unsatisfying results. when they were busy
arranging court appearances,supervising inspections,
filling out buildings department forms, subpoenaing re-
cords and conferring with lawyers, there was little
time for the street rallies, the leafleting and the
building organization which seemed to shake the slum"
population out of its apathy, and which made the rent

strike such an exciting thing to be a part of in its
early stages.

In Central Harlem, where buildings had been
organized most hastily“ and hopes of creating a mass
movement had been highest the emotional let-down
evoked by the advent of litigation was particularly
marked. The Community Council's attempt to
simultaneously perform the functions of a militant
political movement, designed to force major reforms
from the power structure, and of a traditional

_housing clinic, working to improve conditions for

individual tenants, began to falter badly once legal
perspectives and legal problems became prominent.
But even those groups which had committed themselves
to a legal perspective from the start, such as
Brooklyn CORE and Ted Velez‘ East Harlem Tenants
Council, eventually discovered that they could
achieve their aims more effectively by organizing '
tenants to use-the city agencies to achieve repairs.

Regardless of whether court cases were won or lost, _

there was a huge disproportion between the amount of
time and energy which they consumed and the limited
results obtainable. Exhausted by the endless rou-
tine of court appearances, frustrated by the impos-
sibility of actively involving slum tenants in
complex legal procedures, unable to sustain the
militant atmosphere of the early days, one group
after another abandoned the rent strike. While
Jesse Gray became involved in a campaign against
police brutality and corruption, Brooklyn CORE -
which had organized MOO tenant councils and 200
rent strikes - abandoned tenant organization en— .
tirely and applied its energies to the formation o
an independent political movement known as the
Brooklyn Freedom Democratic Party. By the fall of
l96h, little or nothing was left of the rent strike
movement in New York.

small, of "having the book thrown at him ” and being
forced to make major repairs. In areas where the
rent strike attained massive proportions and
attracted the attention of the media, even unorgan-

‘ ized buildings experienced a temporary improvement in

services. -

But though the immediate grievances often were
dealt with, the rent strike, in the vast majority of
cases did not change the basic conditions in the

“buildings which continually created emergencies-—

thin and flimsy walls, archaic plumbing and wiring
systems; lack of adequate building service. What
good did it do to patch up ratholes in a wall that
could be gnawed through in a few hours by the rats
that made their home in the garbage ridden foundation

' of the building? Or to fix a single leak in.a pipe

system that was rusty and decayed? To be made live-
able, these buildings required substantial rehabili-
tation-—at the very minimum, new walls, a new boiler
and new wiring system, and a floor to roof cleaning
and extermination. But the cost of such repairs was
staggering. In five buildings which the city took
into receivership, Real Estate Commissioner Lazarus
told the Times, the total sum required to remove all
violations was $97,139.28._ At an operating profit
of $6,hOl a year which the buildings yielded with
their present level of rents, “it would take about
2h years to amortize the $97,139.28 investment with
h% interest. The city, he concluded, could not deal
with the worst slums unless it was ready to_operate
by a policy in which "humanity comes before
economics.” If the rent strike did not achieve major
political reforms, its effect on slum conditions
would be entirely transitory.

The political achievements of the rent strike,
however, were not substantial. There were three
main formal improvements in housing procedures which

"the rent strike brought about:. (a) the initiation

kof a million dollar rat extermination program; (b)
the addition of 50 inspectors to the buildings
department; (c) and the passage of three new laws

~system of administrating slum properties that was

legalizing rent strikes. These programs were hastily
devised by Mayor Wagner in the early months of the
strike to meet the insistent clamor of the movement's
leaders and the press for "action against the slum-
lords.” .

The first two were slight improvements in a

laws seemed to offer the hope of a dramatic change in ?
the structure of landlord-tenant relations. Drafted
under the supervision of Bruce Gould, the head lawyer
for the Harlem rent strikes, they seemed to define a
procedure through which rent witholding could be madev
a controlled and standardized process for the rehabi-
litation of slum buildings. Among the major improve-
ments made over Section 755 were provisions enabling
the tenant to initiate action in the courts, rather
than waiting for the landlord to sue for eviction;
allowing the court to appoint a third party to ad-
minister repairs, rather than entrusting the job to
the landlord; and enabling tenants to buy fuel with
the rent money three days after the strike had been
initiated. The laws, thus, removed the danger of
eviction from the rent strike procedure, and assured
tenants that repairs would be comprehensive if a
favorable decision were issued. They were regarded by
housing experts as the Mayor's one meaningful conces-
sion to the rent strike, designed to remove the radi-
cal extralegal dimension from the tactic while making
it a sure and effective device for achieving repairs.

Once the bill was passed, however (in the summer
of 1955), tenants‘ organizations discovered that it
was extremely difficult to use--cumbersome, expensive,‘
and far from foolproof. There were far more docu-
ments to serve under the new laws than under 755,
which made the landlord the initiator of the suit.
The minimum cost of a “new law” rent strike for the
tenants was $500, at standard legal rates. Unless
sponsored by a wealthy organization or provided with
free legal aid, no slum building could initiate such
action. The new law, thus, has been used quite

 

 

#5

sparingly, only in fact by groups receiving large
grants from the poverty program or from private
foundations. For the unorganized, unsubsidized poor
who compose the vast majority of the slums‘ inhabi-
tants, the new law did nothing, illustrat ng once

’ again the depths of the chasm separating the poor

from the democratic process.

The greatest gains made by the rent strike were
not in the form of new laws, but in changes in the
administrative procedures of the city housing
agencies. During the rent strike, the organizations
such as the Department of Buildings, the Department

, of Health, and the Rent and Rehabilitation Adminis-

tration, were subjected to extraordinary pressures
to improve the quality of Code enforcement. To pre-
serve their reputation, and perhaps their jobs,
officials of these agencies were forced to make
radical innovations in their procedures, which en-
abled them to meet.the rent strike's demands for
more efficient service. Tenant groups involved in
the rent strike were granted "hot lines” to the
heads of agencies which enabled them to get on the
spot convictions and quick rent reductions--special
phone numbers were set up for tenants who lacked
heat and hot water, and a study was begun by the
city to devise a plan to streamline_and unify city
agencies dealing with housing complaints. Lower
level officials were instructed to keep close con-
tact with militant tenants organizations and to aid
them in every possible way.

The rent strike movement thus had a salutary
effect on slum housing conditions in the short run;
but did not change the basic economic relationships
which made for decay and poor service. The major
changes wrought by the strike were a general
improvement in building code enforcement machinery
and an increased interest in reform and innovation
.in housing in the community at large, but it did not
bring the kind of massive rehabilitation programs
that were needed to give the poor real protection

.from the dangers of tenement existence. This fail-

ure was crucial. The earliest organized tenants—

groups in New York had understood that there could be
no justice for slum tenants as long as low income
housing was operated by the private enterprise system.
But these groups, like the Harlem rent strike, won
improved public regulation of housing rather than
changes in ownership or massive rehabilitation pro-
grams, and did not change the fundamental conditions of
life in the thousands of old law tenaments which stood
then, and stand today as a blight on the face of the
city. '

As regards the strike‘s effect on the level of
social action in the communities where it took place,
its results were even less substantial. The rent
strike did not convert large numbers of slum tenants
to social activism, it did not ”radicalize the ghetto.”
Organizers in all parts of the city were struck by the
extreme difficulty of getting tenants to participate
in any of the movement”s activities outside of the
At rallies, street meetings and demon-
strations, there were usually fewer tenants than organ-
izers and curious students--this was particularly true
of Gray's famed “mass meetings” which drew extra-
ordinary numbers of middle class ‘activists”, but few
tenants. The tenants committees formed by the
organizers to administer the strike in individual
buildings proved to be highly unstable units. Al-
though the strike had raised hopes of developing a
permanent.matrix of tenants committees to keep up the
buildings after the movement had subsided and to
serve as reserve units of organizational strength to
be mobilized for other protests, none of the groups
was able to maintain these committees as functioning
units beyond the duration of the strike. Their fail-,
ure mirrored that of major tenants groups in the past,
who had tried to apply principles of labor organiza-
tions to housing and'unionize" tenants in individual
buildings. Both the Tenants Defense Union of l9l9-
19:0 and the Citywide Tenants Union of the l930's had
declared it their goal to organize into permanent
organization ‘every renter in the city”, but had
fallen absurdly short of this goal. Even among the
most ”organizeable” ethnic and socio-economic groups--

tenants house committees were a most difficult form
of organization to maintain on aastable basis.

' ERRORS OF THE MOVEMENT

Whether or not a different kind of rent strike

’ movement could have produced more stable organiza-

tional forms remains an open question. What is
certain is that, both in terms of organizational
involvement and political impact, the rent strike
movement made a serious error of judgment in attempt-
ing to secure immediate improvement through the
agency of the courts. For the courts, did not, by
and large, deal with the tenants’ grievances. Many
cases were lost entirely and cases that were won
usually resulted in token repairs. But more
importantly, involvement in court action put strains
on the organization of the rent strike movement
which prevented it from attaining the size, flexi-
bility or internal solidarity required to force
government action to rehabilitate slum buildings.
The city, state and federal governments were the
only bodies which had the financial resources to
subsidize comprehensive repairs in slum housing--
they were the ones whom the rent strike had to force
to act, not the slumlord. The rent strike movement
should have given priority to those of its attri-
butes which had the most influence on political
authority.

There were three main qualities of the rent
strike that contributed to its political effective-
ness. First, its size. The larger the rent strike.
grew, the more politicians perceived in it a threat
to the public order, or the danger of a broadly
based radical movement arising to undermine estab-
lished political relationships. Second, militancy.
The more the rent strike broke laws, or massed
large numbers of people together in volatile situa-
tions the more politicians felt the danger of a
contagion of civil disorder to other groups and
other issues-—a breakdown of the peaceful “rules of"

l the game“ in which they were used to operating.

centralized social control, externally imposed
discipline, the subordination of personal fulfil-

.ment to collective economic development.‘ For the

United States, after the revolution, such concerns
will be mostly irrelevant. (Parts of the new left

Valready understand this. Some are trying to live

as if the revolution had already been won.)

We already have the industrial capacity and
technological development to assure affluence. The
‘need here is not to sacrifice to achieve the basis
for a full life, but to change the political economy
so that corporation profits and a favorable climate
of investments are no longer the real principles
around which our social life is organized. To do
that we must-take power from the corporations. That
requires a group of people with the imagination to
create a new way of life and the competence to
organize a society that will be able to function
without the incentives of the market economy.

THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY

The-development of a rigorous program and the~
capacity to run a new society can be achieved only
by an organization of people committed to winning
power and carrying through the revolution. Such a
group will not achieve significant social change
until it becomes involved full—time in convincing
others that a new social order is in their common
self interest. It cannot achieve serious action,
whether intellectual or political, unless it takes
itself seriouslyu Any group that has a long range
goal and a full-time commitment to it must construct

'a comprehensive political stance and program, its

own means of communicating its views (a press), and
a permanent nationwide structure. Such an organiza-
tion is a political party, whether it participates
in elections or not.’

Most of the Studies editors would like to see
such a new socialist party come into being, but there
is no agreement on how that might come about. Some

1&8

Third, rapport between leaders and followers. The more

closely its participants were linked to its leaders,
the more politicians grew afraid that agitation would
be lengthy, and would spread to other issues when the
rent strike ended.

Court action, however, hindered the rent strike
movement severely in each of these areas. It prevented
the rent strike from attaining optimum size because it
absorbed so much of the organizers‘ energy in paper-
work and mechanical problems relating to court appear-
ances such as arranging transportation for tenants and
subpoenaing records. The time spent filling out forms,
conferring with lawyers, and arranging transportation
for the day in court could have been spent on acti-
vities which expanded the strike. In addition, when
the organizers got involved in court action they were
unable to devote as much time to the organization of
demonstration and rallies which had given the rent
strike the aura of mass movement in its early days.
Involvement in court action seemed to impose a non-
militant psychology on the rent strike's leaders and
subtly steered them away from mass action or civil
disobedience. The kind of massive resistance to evic-
tions that characterized the rent strikes of the
twenties and thirties did not take place in the Harlem
rent strike. The most publicized instance of a re-
sisted eviction involved only ten people-—a far cry
from the 4000 people who massed before an Olinville
Avenue Building on rent strike in 1933. Finally, the
technical responsibilities associated with court action
prevented the organizers from using their time with
the tenants for political education or activities
which strengthened tenants’ organization.. Some pre-
liminary surveys by the School of Social Work of
tenants involved in the rent strike, show that there
was very little contact between organizers and tenants
and that very little of the rent strikes‘ meaning was
communicated to the tenants. The organizers, moreover,
had very little success in getting tenants to parti-
cipate in related protest activities, and this was an
important reason why government officials felt they

 

 

.u9

could safely stop making concessions after the first
few months of the strike. ‘

iThe rent strike, thus, by getting involved in

court action severely compromised its strength as a
political protest, but it did so in large part be-
cause it did not have a clear conception of itself
as a political protest. The rent strike began
suddenly and spread haphazardly—-it had an epidemic
quality. Many organizations rushed into it without
knowing anything about housing, or without previous
experience in organizing low-income people. Without
a clear strategy to guide them, and without real
confidence in their ability to stay with the move-
ment, they were pushed into the safe and legitimate
style of organizing, which would not put themselves,
or the tenants, in danger. They did_not know enough
about housing work, or perhaps about American
society in general to realize that major economic
changes could not be effected by the courts. A
certain naive and totally unjustified confidence in
established institutions, characterized the organi-
zers, many of whom were white college students and

.professionals. Unsure of their own commitment, at

once afraid of and patronizing to the people they
were organizing, and subtly beholden to the bourgeois
notion that reason prevails in the chambers of power
--they made of the rent strike an elaborate form of
social work.

Comment

i‘Mr. Naison has written one of the first dccountscf
Jesse Gray's Community Council on Housing. He is
apparently familiar with many of the facts concerning
the rent strike movement after it got off the ground.
There is, however,_an elusive quality to the author's
work which frustrates me. "He discusses the rise and
fall of numerous tenant movements in New York City,
and finally narrates the history of the most current
attempt of radicals to address themselves to the
housing issue. I am confused as to why he bothered to
write this paper in the first place, since he never
explicitly states any significant conclusions. If his
task was merely to record the failures_of the left he
has done so admirably. But if he wanted to draw some
lessons from this history of tenant—city—landlord
struggles, he has failed.

Naison's major criticism of the rent strike is
its lack of definition of goals. He maintains that
the movement would have been relevant, and perhaps
even successful, if it had avoided the courts in pre-
ference for a campaign for government aid to slum
housing. -

I

The Community Council on Housing (CCH) originally‘

 

51

sought to build a tight cohesive politically con-
scious (read: radical socialist) base in a limited
area in Harlem roughly between Fifth and Eighth
Avenues, and lO8th and 125th Streets. The rent
strike was one of many tactics to aid in building
this base. Gray also emphasized discussion ses-
sions with tenants in buildings; court suits when
necessary; mass meetings; and electoral campaigns.
Certainly before October, 1963, Jesse Gray and his
organizers were building that radical base. Naison
apparently sees no significance in this dimension of
the story .

"The rent strike tactic was implemented as the
cold weather set in, in the late fall of l963. Gray
and the Council organizers managed to pull strikes
in buildings where the Council was known and re-
spected. The total was not more than 16. The
second group of tenants to go out on strike was not
as familiar with the ideas of the CCH and Gray, but
nevertheless education programs and building
councils had been implemented. The total in
November was not more than 50.

It was at this point that there was a shift in
emphasis. The decisions of Ribaudo and Moritt,
coupled with gestures of cooperation from state and
city agencies (the "hot line” to the office of Rent
and Rehabilitation Administration, and the decision
of the Department of Welfare not to penalize
“clients” who withheld rent) allowed the rent strike
movement to expand. The courts‘ decisions and
Welfare's permissiveness were strong points around r
which people could be persuaded to withhold rent.

A paradox developed in which, as Naison points out,
the court action diverted the rent strike movement,
but as he fails to note, the strength of the move-
ment depended on it. Down at the block level,
people had to be assured that they wouldn't be out
on the street: Further, all of this took place

_within the context of increased press coverage and

the involvement of many white radicals and liberals.

The rent strike movement became the public domain,

and Gray sacrificed local organizing in buildings

    

52

 

for the creation of a spectacle of thousands of tenants ‘

tying _p,p_ the courts, a the city’: ""adminifst:r,at i,on._,._ and the
Slumlafdskogblor _.H _,«.n Hr.“ .rr,c,_ ..... ..-

.’Pracft'ically, sipe.ak’i;5“g‘, ‘the failure ’o'f,th'e' rent C
strike movement began when_Gray's organization de-
cided to'fg’o ,out‘s‘ide:"_:the bounds‘ of the tiny _loc,ale’ in d
which it built its base.‘ The complication of_pubé
licity, coordination of‘a citywide movement and the
attendant fighting between various leaders for power,
plus the bottleneck of court cases, compromised the
initial vision of the Community Council on Housing.’
For Naison to state that the movement had no goals is
a half-truth. _To be accurate, the Council had an
objective--building a radical base for political
actions-which was unfortunately sacrificed for
expediency and opportunism.

II

Naison suggests a simple alternative for the
rent strike movement: massive federal aid to slum
housing. This suggestion reflects his failure to
draw conclusions from the history of the struggles of
American radicals._ The rent strike, he argues, could
have been an effective strategy designed to pry
monies out of Washington} _Naison seems to assume
that the good society is the great society. Char-
acteristic of many radical movements and organiza-
tions of the 20th century is a tendency to define _
solutions for this nation‘s ills in terms of a strong
national government. 'Naison's answer follows in that
tradition. Radicals, in fact, have been stalwart
supporters of national reform programs which have
accelerated the development of corporate capitalism,
a multitude of complicated detents between the pri- '
vate economic sector and the national hierarchy, and
a centralization of authority and decision—making
which has become oppressive to all citizens.

It would seem that radicals now have to seek
programmatic solutions in another direction. The
growth of strong radical locally—oriented

organizations with demands for self-rule and control,
rather than national and state hegemony, is impera-
tive if the current geeration of American radicals
wishes to seriously challenge and change this

nation. Self-determination, and local ownership

and control over neighborhoods and buildings,

. speak: both to the problems of poor people and to

the larger issue of the kind of governmental
structure radicals would like to see established
in this country. ‘

Naison is a prisoner of his own narrative-style
of history. Thus he can relate the facts and the
outcomes of struggles, but little more. It will be
up to other historians to analyze Naison‘s facts
toward an understanding of 20th century radicalism.

APaperback Approach to the

American Radical Traditiany,|l

Editor's note: The following is the concluding por-
tion of Mr. MacGilvray's two part article.

A brilliant study of what happened to the radi-
cal thrust is presented in James M. McPherson's The
§truggle for Equality: Abolitionists and the_Negro in
the Civil War and the Reconstruction (Princeton, #72,
$3.h5), while the classic radical account is W.E.B.

Du Bois' Black Reconstruction (Meredian, M170, 33.A5).'

The post-Civil War period is further illuminated in
Staughton Lynd, ed., Regonstrugtign (Harper, $2.25).
For the political phase and an earlier Johnson gone
wrong, see Eric L. McKitrick's Andrew Johnson and

Reconstruction (Phoenix, P153, $2.95).

Part of the (painful legacy of the Civil War with
which radicals had to contend may be read about in
Rayford W. Logan, Betrayal of the Negro: From
Rutherford B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson (Collier,
o3uL+9, 151.50); Ralph Ginzberg’s :_Loo Year_s___o_f:
Lynchings: A Shocking Documentary of Race Violence in
America (Lancer, 7h-805, .75¢); and Thomas F.
Gossett's Race: The History of an Idea in America
(Schocken, SBlOo, 32.95). The thoroughly corrupting

‘aspect of racism may be seen in the ruin of a

potentially great Southern radical related by C. Van
Woodward, Tom Watson: Agrarian Rebel (Galaxy, GBlO2,
52.50). But the radical reply to racism was nobly

 

‘P165, $2.95).

 

(55

made in W.E.B. DuBois' The Souls of Black Folk
(Crest, R699, .eo¢).

The rampant exploitation of the period which
absorbed much radical effort is well described by
Matthew Josephson in The Robber Barons (Harvest,
HBh7, $2.25), and his The Politicos (Harvest, HB59,
$2.95). Immigrants were lured with lies and brought
in droves to be exploited. Their part which added
to the radical tradition is beautifully told by John
Higham, Strangers in the Land (Atheneum,
One phase of the radical effort to aid them is set V
forth in Ray Ginger's Altgeld's America: The
Lincoln Ideal Versus Changing Realities (Quadrangle,
QP2l, $2.25).

On the agricultural front a grass roots revolt
flaired. Seef Solon J. Buck, The Granger Movement:
A Study of Agricultural Organization and Its Poli-
tical, Economic, and Social Manifestations (Bison,
BBl6o, $1.00); John D. Hicks, The Populist Revolt:
A History of the Farmers‘-Alliance and the People's
Party (Bison, BBlll, $1.75); George B. Tindall, ed.,
A Populist Reader (Torchbooks, TB3069, $2.25). For
the continuation of America's agrarian struggle,
read Theodore Saloutos and John D. Hicks, Twentieth
Century Populism: Agricultural Discontent in the
Middle West, 1900-1939 (Bison, BBI75, $1.85).

_ INDUSTRIALISM AND SCCIALISM

On the industrial front rebellion also made
itself felt. A key crisis for radicals, growing
out of the 8 hour day fight, is presented by Henry,
David, History of the Haymarket Affair (Collier,
O3l2h, $1195). The Governor who took the radical
side and was crucified for it has his story told in
(Harry Bernard, Eagle Forgotten (Charter, #116,
$2.85). A strike of huge proportions is described
in Almont Lindsay's The Pullman Strike (Phoenix,
During it a significant labor leader
was converted to socialism. He became the radical
leader who captured the imagination of Americans as
no one has been able to do since. His life bears

Revealing also at this time is the radical
political effort. For it see Howard Quint, The
Forging of American Socialism (Bobbs, AHSEM, $1.95);

A David A. Shannon, The Socialist Party of America: A
History (Quadrangle, QP38, $2.h5); the documentary‘

anthology of H. Wayne Morgan, ed., American-
Socialism, 1900-1960 (Spectrum, s85, $1.95); and an
interesting critical reconstruction, Theodore
Draper, The Roots of American Communism (Compass,
C137, $1.95). Anti-radicals were also active as

witness William Preston, Jr.'s Aliens and Dissenters:

Federal Suppression of the Radicals, 1903-1933
(Torchbooks, TBl287, $2.h5), and a superb account
of yet another "witch hunt,” for “Reds” this time,,
Robert K. Murray's Red Scare} A Study in National
Hysteria, 1919-1920 (McGraw-Hill, hhO75, $2.95).

A great strike of the period is examined by David
Brody, Labor in Crisis: the Steel Strike of 1919
(Lippincott, $l.h5). Its Leader was an I.W.W. who
later became a Communist and tells his story in
William Z. Foster, Pages from a Worker's Life
(International, IP1, $2.50). Useful here too is
Richard O. Boyer and Herbert M. Morais, Labor's
Untold Story (Marzani & Munsell, P.10, $2.50),’

which takes in opposition to radical trade unionists.

One of the watersheds of the post World War One
period which rallied intellectuals to a radical
cause is splendidly surveyed in Louis Joughin and
Edmund M. Morgan, The Legacy of Sacco and Vanzetti
(Quadrangle, QP7, $2.85), and may be felt
emotionally in Marion D. Frankfurter and Gardner
Jackson, eds., The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti
(Dutton, D62, $1.85). Also helpful, especially for
students of literature, is Walter B. Rideout‘s The
Radical Novel in the United States l900—l95h (Hill
& Wang, AC8l, $1.95), while Daniel Aaron's Writers

on the Left (Avon, W103, $1.25), is a valuable

study of intellectuals in the 1930's. For a View
through a great pair of intelligent eyes, try
Edmund Wilson, The American Earthquake: A

* and the New Deal (Anchor, A382, $1.95).

believe that a party can come about only more or less
spontaneously —— out of the_experience of the new left.
I do not share that view." I see the creation of a
party as an act of will on the part of those who be-
lieve it to be necessary. I do not think that a party
can be formed immediately, but if one is to be formed
in the next two or three years, some group of people
must take the initiative now.

The possibility of a revolutionary party within
the next few years will be-affirmed or negated only in
the course of making the attempt. The only question
that must be answered now is whether there is a need
for such a party at this time. If so, then those who
understand the need have the responsibility to act.

The experience of recent years should encourage such
action, since those who have acted against the war, in
the ghettoes, and on the campuses have almost uniformly
found more popular support than they expected.

On the need for a party, the main reason is
axiomatic: without a revolutionary party there can be
no revolution. But why a new party and why now? The
first part is easy. A new-party because all the
existing ones have failed to develop a revolutionary
theory relevant to transforming the United States, and
are hopelessly limited by their long-term ideological
dependence on one or.another tendency in the Soviet
Union or China. Further, none of them takes itself
seriously as a revolutionary forze. They have no
strategy of building a mass revolutionary movement

' here. Their thinking and programs are shaped by

events, rather than by themselves as makers of history.
THE TIME IS NOW

The reason for a new party at this time is that
the Movement has created the possibility of rapid
growth and relevance for a revolutionary party, even
though the Movement does not have within it the
potential to transcend its present limitations. ‘In
the last few years the Movement has educated hundreds
of thousands of young people to-a better understanding

RECENT RADICALISM

i For more recent history involving the radical
tradition, the following provide insight: William A.
Williams, The Tragedy of American Diplomacy (Dell,
9002, $1.63); David Horowitz, The Free World
Colossus: A Critique of American Foreign Policy in the
Cold War (Hill & Wang, H33, $2.h5); Martin Luther King,
Jr., Stride Toward Freedom: the Montgomery Story
(Perennial, Plo, »65¢); Malcolm X and Alex Haley,

The Autobiography of Malcolm X (Dell, 5174, .95¢);
Howard Zinn, SNCC: the New Abolitionists (Beacon,
BP2l3, $1.75); Elizabeth Sutherland, ed., Letters

From Mississippi (Signet, T29h3, .75¢); Sally Belfrage,

Freedom Summer (Crest, T908, .75¢); Scott Nearing,

The Conscience of a Radical (Social Science Institute,
$1.00); Hal Draper, Berkeley: The New Student Revolt
(Grove, BCl03, .95¢); Mitchell Cohen and Dennis Hale,
eds., The New Student Left (Beacon, 39240, $1.95);
Jack Newfield, A Prophetic Minority (Signet, T3lh0,
.75¢). Anti-radical activity o:E"most recent variety

_ may be seen in two works of Fred J. Cook, The FBI

Nobody Knows (Pyramid, Nl2lh, .95¢), and Barry’m“
Goldwater: Extremist of the Right (Black Cat, BC8l,
-75¢) - A »

As you can readily perceive, the American

Radical Tradition is quite accessible in paperback
editions. To be sure, good pickings still remain in
hard—cover. Here is the deliberately hidden history
of our country which the Establishment wants forgotten.
Knowledge of it can prevent errors and guide-action.

It can inspire and make converts to the radical cause.
Let's be aware of it. Good reading!

A leaflet: The Genius J  

a American t Politics

Last year Jesse Lemisch was denied renewal of

.his contract as Assistant Professor of History.

Lemisch, a left-wing activist whose scholarship
focusses on the role of the common man in colonial

d hand later American history, was told in explanation:

“Your convictions interfere with your scholarship.”

In 1953, Daniel Boorstin, preeminent colonial
historian_at the University of Chicago, in testimony
before the House Un—American Activities Committee
(HUAC), said the following about convictions and
scholarship:

Mr. (Morgan M.) MOULDER; Can you give us some
statement as to how you expressed your opposition
(to the Communist Party) since that time?... i
(Boorstin had testified to leaving the Party in
1939-) i

Mr; BOORSTIN. Yesy sir.
My opposition has taken two forms: .Firsty the

form of an affirmative participation in religious
activities....

  

  

 1,5. «.  .,. 7

 

 

The second form of my opposition has been an
to discover and explain to my students in my teach-
ing and in my writing, the unique virtues of

attempt

American democracy. I have done this partly
Jefferson book (The Lost World of Thomas
Jefferson, l9h8)...and in a forthcoming book called
The Genius of gmerican Politics, which is on the
presses at the moment.

in my

I do feel that the most effective way to fight
Communism--the one effective way in which I may
have some competence is by helping people to under-
stand the virtues of our institutions and their
special values as these emerged from our history,
and I have tried to do that.

Mr. (Gordon H.) SCHERER. Professor, do you feel
today that an active member of the Communist Party
should be a teacher in our public schools?

Mr.

BOORSTIN. No, sir.

Mr. SCHERER. Do you feel that he should be a
teacher in our colleges?

Mr. BOORSTIN.. In any area where I have any expert
competence, that is, in the area of the humanities
and social sciences, my answer would be no.

(U.S., Congress, Housexof Representatives,
Committee on Un-American Activities, Communist
Methods of Infiltration (Education), Part I, 83rd
Congress, lst Session, 1953, pp. 51-52, 60, 59-60.)

This is not reprinted in an effort at mudslingy
ing. We do not question Boorstin's right to his
scholarly orientations; nor his right to explain his
orientations and motivations to a congressional
committee. (The human and moral appropriateness of
doing so to HUAC in 1953 is another matter.) We
think, though, that four important reflections can be
based on this testimony.

 

   
    
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
     

The scholarship of at least one mainstream
social scientist, by his own testimony, is
written with a political purpose, and this
purpose is to aid the American side in the
Cold War. It is probable that the same is
true of many other mainstream social scien-
tists.

(2) In Boorstin's case the assertion of a poli-
tical perspective through scholarship and
teaching was not at all gentlemanly or toler-
ant. It went so far as to assert the legitim-
acy Of excluding certain alternative
perspectives.i Again, the same was and is true
of many besides Boorstin. '

(3) Scholarship and conviction are not exclusive
values.’ A scholar's choice of subject and
treatment, and his attachment to certain
hypotheses, are inevitably influenced by his
convictions--or lack of conviction. Certainly
these influences must be subjected to criteria
of objectivity and evidence. There will al-
ways exist a certain tension between convic-
tion and scholarship. Probably there are no
universally valid guidelines for resolving it.

(h) Thus, talk of "convictions interfering with

; scholarship” in the case of one scholar is

E ~ hypocritical. What must be noted is that

5 » certain scholarly biases--mainly those which
favor the status quo--are tolerated, even
praised by the profession, while others--
mainly those which question the status quo--
are excluded. Any claim that Lemisch lost his
job at the University of Chicago because his
convictions interfered with his scholarship,
but that Boorstin retains his job because his
convictions do not, is bullshit.

of the true nature of American capitalism. It has
shown that radical actions are possible, and that its
own estrangement from the dominant values of American
society is widely shared." It has exposed the slavish
loyalty to the American business system of our
political structure and our educational institutions.
It has demonstrated the value of spontaneous action
and of local initiative, as well as the personal

and group rewards that come from taking an active
part in social change.

~But the Movement has also demonstrated its own
limitations. The diversity which gives it much of

hits strength prevents the development of a rigorous‘

  

purposefulness. The primarily student makeup of the
Movement makes it unlikely that a permanent core of
members will be created, or that there will be any
continuity in the development of program or strategy.
The chance of the development of a revolutionary
single-mindedness within the Movement is almost non-
existent, since such a purpose does not, never has,
come spontaneously out of dissent or resistence. A
movement led entirely by those under thirty is with-
out benefit of the accumulated experience of other
revolutionaries and other revolutionary movements.
Without that knowledge revolutionary theory is im-
possible. And, of course, without revolutionary
theory there can be no revolutionary party.

Every revolutionary party that has become
relevant, as well as many that haven't, has been
created by the wﬂlful action of a small group of
men and women. If a new party is to be formed in
the United States, the same will be true here no
matter when it happens. In that sense, the forma-
tion of a party is an elitist act. But it is silly
not to act because of a fear of elitism. If an
elitist party is formed, no one will follow it in
any case. The worst that will have happened is
that those who formed it wasted their time.

The Decline of Socialism
in America: 1912-1925

By JAMES WEINSTEIN

Mr. Weinstein has brought together in one volume an
account of all radical organizations during the heyday of
American socialism, and has discovered thatfar from declin-
ing after 1912 as has been generally assumed, the movement
continued to hold broad appeal for masses of Americans for
at least a decade thereafter. He also concludes in this exhaus-
tively researched and carefully documented volume that the
more recent failure of American socialism was at least as
much due to internal troubles as to external barriers. The old
Socialist Party, he points out in support of this thesis, had
inass support at the polls, a powerful and widely read press,
a large trade-union following, and had overcome obstacles of
immigrant us. “old stoc ,” general prosperity, and Bull Moose
competition.

james Weinstein has uncovered information that signi-
ficantly alters the standard account of the socialist movement
in the United States.—-Prof. William Appleman Williams

  The Rant Strikes in New York  

Rent strikes in New York are as old as the slums.

Already in the early l890s, there were “annual rent
strikes led by the Ladies‘ Anti—Beef Trust
Association” which - along with general labor un-

‘rest - “kept the Lower East Side in constant tur-

moil.” After the passage of the Tenement House

Law of l90l, the rent strike movement of the l890s,
subsided; but in 1918, the limited gains won in the
pre-war period were swept away by a growing housing

_shortage which permitted landlords to increase rents

by as much as 200% in a matter of months.

Tenants unable or unwilling to renew short-term
leases at substantially higher rentals faced summary
disposses proceedings, and wholesale evictions fre-
quently took place. In the city‘s working class
districts, hit hard by unemployment during the post
war demobilization, tens of thousands were in danger
of losing their homes.

THE EARLX STRUGGLES

In the Jewish section of the city, the housing
crisis brought with it a new outburst of rent
