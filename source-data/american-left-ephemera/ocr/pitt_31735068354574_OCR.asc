Step up the drive! I

Across the nation last week Mine-Mill members

‘and local unions were engaged in a gigantic effort to

win the approval of the War Stabilization Board for

wage increases and other economic benefits Won in

collective bargaining with employers. /_

Responsible for‘ the intensive activity was the
knowledge that the so-called wage stabilization ,.appa-_ -

ratus in Washington was not created by big business
as a source of wage increases for the workers. Work-
ers have learned that wage “stabilization” was drafted
in the plush board rooms of Wall Street as ‘a master
plan to freeze wages while prices, ‘profits, and divi-
dends keep rising higher’ and higher.

In Montana, Mine-Mill members were being sup-
ported in their campaign to win approval for wage
increases by the governor of the state. . S. Senator
Bennett of Utah intervened with WSB ’on behalf of
Mine-Mill’s request for quick action. Workers in Ari-
zona were calling on their governor. Mayors in several
cities were being contacted by Mine-Mill members.

Telegrams to the WSB, demanding approval of

* Mine-Mill wage increases, were pouring out of mining
towns in the Southwest and in Utah. Brass workers ~

in Connecticut were similarly engaged. Radio pro-
grams Were_sponsored by Mine-Mill locals all over the
West. Post cards, thousands of them, were being signed

, and dispatched to the WSB. V
The general theme of the. campaign to win ap-

proval was that “every member has a job to 'do.”

On pages 4 and 5 is material to help you and your
local union" participate in this great crusade.

Mine-Mill ‘petitions

pour into Wage

DENVER. — Petitions for ap-
proval of Mine-Mill 1951 wage
and contract gains were still
pouring into the Wage Stabiliza-
tion Board offices in Washington

last week, with the last of them ‘

expected to be filed within tlre
next few days.

Already before, the WSB Re-
view and Appeals‘ Committee
were the petitions covering work-
ers at properties of Kennecott

Copper Co., Phelps-Dodge Cor-
poration and American Smelting
.- & Refining Company. The Ap-

peals committee will complete its
“processing” of these petitions
and make its recommendations to

the full Board by the end of this
_, week, it was confidently pre-

dicted.
Also due for early considera-

 

tion by the Appeals Committee
were petitions covering newly-
negotiated contracts at Anaconda
Copper Mining Co., American
Brass Company, American Zine
Co., U. S. Metals, Peru Mining,
as well as 21 operators in the
Coeur d’Alene district in Idaho
and three operators in the Miami,
Arizona, area.» '
Once the Review and Appeals
Committee has acted, its recom-
mendations will then be consid-
ered for final approval by the
full National Wage Stabilization
Board.
Meantime, across the nation,
Mine-Mill members and locals
were pressing for quick action by
the Board in order to make it
possible for workers throughout
/the industry to get “back pay by
Christmas.”

Coeur d’Alene workers win I
national Mine-Mill package

KELLOGG, Idaho. -‘— Workers
at 21 lead and zinc properties in
this Coeur d’Alene area have
voted to accept the “last offers”
of the companies which come to

a total of approximately 20 cents
an hour. .

The agreements, which are be-
ing submitted in petition form to
the Wage Stabilization Board
this week, call for a general wage

‘increase of 8 cents an hour, from

7 to 10 cents in reclassification

increases, and a pension plan.

The settlements are patterned

 

closely after the national Mine-
Mill “package” won in the Big
Four giants of the industry ear-
lier this fall. They cover opera-
tions ranging from the big
Bunker Hill & Sullivan properties
down to the small Hull Lease.
The wage increases are all to
be retroactive to July 1.
Meantime, members of Mine-
Mill Local 14 in Wallaceand Lo-
cal 18 in Kellogg voted by a large

‘ A majority to -merge the two locals

President Joseph Smilek of Local

tried to persuade the National Labor
Relations Board to obtain an injunc-
tion against the union on the phoney
claim of a “secodary boycott.” When
this failed, the Company went into
state superior court asking for an in-
junction against ‘mass picketing. ’

The suit for an immediate‘ injunc-
tion has now been withdrawn, but the
company still is pressing a civil suit

A, victory for peace

Two important American causes were upheld when U. S. Distrl 
Judge Matthew McGuire dismissed the government’s “foreignagent ‘
charge against Dr. W. E. B..DuBois and his four associates in the
former Peace Information Center- C

One was the cause of free speech. The judge dealt a stunning blow:
to those political cops in the U. S. who would stifle all those who spealc"
out honestlyand sincerely in opposition to the war drive and the sup-
pression of civil liberties. ’ »

The other was the cause of peace. As Dr. DuBois himself com-..
mented months ago when the indictment was first hand_ed downi “I. i
must assume that the Justice Dcpdrtmcntﬂs action is d fu7'the1° move; .
by the administration to frighten into silence the voices of peace in
America . . whether in support of the World Peace Appeal, the‘ ~
Intiarnational Red Cross statement calling for banning atomic weapons,-‘
or the teachings of the.Pmncc" of Peace Himsel .”

— The government attorneys, who tried in vain to show that DuBois A ‘ '
had acted as an “agent” of a foreign government, argued that they
did not need to prove thatthere had been any agreement or contract
between DuBois and the “foreign person.”

a

A foreign agent, they said, is -“any person who acts or holds him-
self out to be a disseminatorof information for a foreign person . . .-
not necessarily due to any agreement at all.”

But the judge insisted that DuBois and his associates had a_righ_t
to hold any opinion and distribute any information, even if the pinions
and information happened to coincide\ with the views of a ‘foreign
person.” - "

“Maybe,” said the judge, “Congress has used inept language.
Now Congress has said salt conceivably could be pepper and pepper. .
could conceivably be salt, is that night?” And the Justice Department 7’ ‘
attorney admitted: “That’s exactly what it did.” ‘ 0

‘ With that as background, Judge MbGuire dismissed the 'jury--.-- S
and the case—with the remark: “If I permitted this case to go to the
jury, I should permit them to speculate on ca speculation.” A

The acquittal of. Dr. DuBois was a notable victory for free speech
and for peace. It was a victory which gave fresh .heart,to all those’ 2

be stopped. .

The great importance of the victory is measured by the almost
total blackout of news about it by the ,daily press.

INE-MILL members are awaiting approval by
the Wage Stabilization Board of wage increases

and other economic benefits recently negotiated‘

with the nation’s non-ferrous metal companies. They
are waiting—but knowing the anti-labor character
of the wage freeze, they are taking _noth1ng.for
granted. They are letting the WSB know in no un-

' certain terms that they are fed up with crumbs and ‘

would like to feed their kids beefsteak once in a
while. ’ ‘

In the words of one local union president, An-
thony Lennert of Local 537 in Buffalo, N. Y., the
WSB is being told daily by Mine-Mill members that
“we are not in any sense asking special privileggs
or favors. We are highly indignant over a so-called
stabilization program which stabilizes nothing but
wages.”

In some areas, all-out community efforts are
under way to acquaint other citizens with the need
of Mine-Mill members for additional income to meet
the‘ punishment which workers’ families are suffer-
ing because of war economy inflation.

MANY local unions seeking WSB "approval for

negotiated gains were reflecting in their wires,

of President Harry Bridgesof the~Longshoremen’s "
and Warehousemen’s union at Mine-Mill’s conven-

tion in September at Nogales, Ariz. In his speech to
Mine-Mill delegates, Bridges said:

“We are told because of government policy, the
Defense Production Act, and the necessity for wage
stabilization and equality, of sacrifice that if we
keep that money (negotiated wage increases), it is
bad for our-country’s security, it is bad for -us. If

_ The 1951 "increase comes after profits
went up 75 per cent in 1950 (over 1949)!
Since January, 1950, our average wage in-

’We produced those profits. Between, ,
19.49 and 1950, copper mining production
increased 1.4 per cent, lead and zinc mining
11 per cent, and smelting and refining '10
per cent. Increased productivity comes from
the speedup, the stretch-out.

“If your wives and families get ho°§pitalization'

,-—.it helps the Kremlin. It helps Moscow. If the em-
ployers get the money back—-good for the country.”
Mine-Mill is imarshalling much evidence to sup’-
port its WSB cases.
There are, for example, the figures on the fan-

'_ tastic cost of living. Prices have risen 17 per cent _

in the year and a half that wages have been frozen.
Rents are increased 20 per cent under phoney “rent
control.” Taxes have increased 32 per cent since the
wage freeze went into‘ effect.

This, as an --introduction to as dis-

Local 579 wins recognition,
contract at Bates Company

COLUMBIA, Tenn.—Mine-Mill Lo- ‘
cal 579 has won recognition and signed
a contract with the Bates Construc-
tion Co. here. Union recognition came
without an election or even a card

check.

The contract covers all workers who
are now doing construction work at
the Rockwood operations of the Ten-
nessee Products and Chemical Co., all
of whom have joined Mine-Mill. Bates
is ex ected to put another crew to
work at the Wrigley operations of
TPCC, and the workers there will be
organized into Local 314. —

Thefirst contract calls—for a gen-
eral wage increase of 10 cents across
the board, retroactive to Nov. 1. Five
and 10 cents an hour shift differen-
tial for second and third shift work- _
ers is also provided, as well_ as one
week vacation after six months, and
two weeks after one year or more.

THE KGREEMENT also provides
for six paid holidays, overtime after
eight hours a day, double time for
Sunday work, straight seniority with-
out qualifications, irrevocable check-

" off, and a wage reopener dated March

1, 1952. _

The negotiating committee‘ fof ' the
union included Taylor Hinds, Charles

A’ "Unemployment isa tragic reality for

tens of thousands of American work-.
 ers. Unemployment benefits won’t keep

‘an family alive at today's prices, and
_even the benefits continue only a lim-
‘ited number of weeks.

r At the same time, Congressmen are
; talking of plans to force further cur-
.tailment of civilian production. This
jwould mean unemployment for more

j thousands.

_ To mobilization director Charles E.
if Wilson, there is nothing “tragic” about
_‘ this situation. Replying to labor criti-
ﬂlcism, Wilson said: “I; cannot agree
{that theﬁwaste of manhours and of

’plant capacity has yeét approached ‘

tragic proportions.”

Wilson also announced that strikes
will not be “tolerated.” His reason:
“We cannot permit the strong to
trample on the weak in this emer-
gency.”

Labor economists pointed out “that
Congress already has guaranteed un-
reasonable prices increases to indus-
try, and has set up machinery where-

. by profits of giant corporations have

been swelled through gifts of more

' than $9 billion in tax refunds and

more billions through special pricing
on military supplies, government loans
and gifts of machine tools.
Please don’t permit the _strong to

This is the story of how three lead-

The members didn’t like it either.

it was always in small quantities and

the little they gave went to needy

founders of the “Bingham Plan.” No

given quickly and generously without
any idrf of “building this into a large
fund,” but with the intention of spend-
ing it as fast as it’s collected if there

.. are brothers on strike anywhere in the

International Union.

The dollar-a-man wasn’t to be mixed
up with Local 485’s own strike fund,
they also agreed. That fund, which
now is considerable, is for the relief
of 485 "members, and families when
they are on strike—and only then.

. THE MONEY is to be set aside in a 0
separate checking account, to be han-;

dled by the membership through their
elected officers.

Now we can report that-the first’
“gold shipment” under the Bingham-

Plan has been made! In the check-off
on Nov. 10, members of ‘the Bingham
local cheerfully saw a dollar taken
from their pay envelopes to help swell
the fund.- And when the first‘ collec-

 

'l'lli1e‘lBin9ha miP|an' for winning strikes

tion was over, it was possible for ’I‘om
and Nachi and_ Jess to sit down and
write two good-sized checks.

One‘was for $400 and it went to the _
Bayard Amalgamated Local 890, for T

the relief of Empire Zinc strikers

and their families, looking forwardU

to their second Christmas on the picket
lines. The other was for $200 to West-

striking diecast workers who have

been out on the lines since last sum-

mer. .
The members and leaders of Local
1185 think they have an idea here that
ought to take hold throughout the In-
ternational Union. They believe that
Empire Zinc and all the rest of what
they call the “hoodlum companies”
would quickly give up their dirty fight-
ing tactics and bargain decently ‘and
fairly if they knew that any Mine-
Mill local that went on strike was
backed by $1,000,000 in hard cash. ‘

Yes, they mean it whe“ they say
one million dollars, because that’s what

,. it would conie to if all the Mine-Mill ,.

local unions took over the “Bingham'
Plan”—over a ‘million dollars a. year!

“We want to hear the comments of
other local unions on this plan," say
'I‘om and Nachio and Jess. “Their
ideas for improving the ‘Bingham
Plan’ will be welcomed. We hope to
hear from locals, no matter how large
or small, writing to ‘us and saying:
‘Bingham, we are with you and on
our next check-off we, too, are going
to sock away an extra dollar just in
case some ruthless employer thinks
he can starve our brothers out.’

“If that happens, it will guarantee
that a year from now, close to $1,000,-
000 will be available to help out In
