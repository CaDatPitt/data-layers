PREAMBLE

The Communist Party of the United States
is a political party of the American working
class, basing itself upon the principles of sci-
entiﬁc socialism, Marxism-Leninism. It cham-
pions the immediate and fundamental interests
of the workers, farmers and all who labor by
hand and brain, against capitalist exploitation
and oppression. As the advanced party of the
working class, it stands in the forefront of this
struggle. A

The Communist Party upholds the achieve-
ments of American democracy and defends the
United States Constitution and its Bill of
Rights against its reactionary enemies who
would destroy democracy and popular liber-
ties. It uncompromisingly ﬁghts against im-
perialism and colonial oppression, against ra-
cial, national and religious ‘discrimination,
against Iim-Crowism, anti-Semitism and all
forms of chauvinism.

The Communist Party struggles for the

‘complete destruction of fascism and for a dur-

3

  

able peace. It seeks to safeguard the welfare
of the people and the nation, recognizing that
the working class, through its trade unions and
by its independent political action, is the most
consistent ﬁghter for democracy, national
freedom and social progress.

as 4: 4

The Communist Party holds as a basic prin-
ciple that there is an identity of interest which
serves as a common bond uniting the workers
of all lands. It recognizes further that the true
national interests of our country and the cause
of peace and progress require the solidarityof
all freedom-loving peoples ‘and the continued
and ever closer cooperation of the United Na-

" tions.

 

The Communist Party recognizes that the
ﬁnal abolition of exploitation and oppression,
of economic crises and unemployment, of re-
action and war, will be achieved only by the
socialist reorganization of society——by the com-
mon ownership and operation of the national
economy under a government of the people
led by the working class. :

The Communist Party, therefore, educates
the working class, in the course of its day—to-

4

 

  

..____ . .__. ._..

day struggles, for its historic mission, the es-
tablishment of Socialism. Socialism, the high-
est form of democracy, will guarantee the full
realization of the right to “life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness,” and will turn the

achievements of labor, science and culture to V

the use and enjoyment of all men and women.
as -=I= an

In the struggle for democracy, peace and
social progress, the Communist Party carries
forward the democratic traditions of Iefferson,
Paine, Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, and
the great working-class traditions of Sylvis,
Debs and Ruthenberg. It ﬁghts side by side
with all who join in this cause.

For the advancement of these principles,
the Communist Party of the United States
establishes the basic laws of its organization
in the following Constitution: 1

peace with the ultimate aim of ridding our
country of the scourge of economic crises, un-
employment, insecurity, poverty and war,
through the realization of the historic aim of
the working class——the establishment of So-
cialism by the free choice of the majority of the
American people. i
