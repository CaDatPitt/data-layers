or some island property of American im-
perialism—means that the full force of this
movement has its direct impact and conse-
quences in challenge to the enemy and sup-
port of all forces of social progress.

Furthermore, the purging of white chauvi-
nist and anti-Negro prejudices from the minds
of the White masses is a vital aspect _of the
subjective preparation of the working class
for undertaking the leading role in the strug-
gle for a higher form of social order —— for
socialism. It is the Way the American Working
class is being educated in the spirit of inter-
nationalism.

Thus, this course of development corres-
ponds to the main line of the present-day
reality, namely that the solution of all demo-
cratic tasks is Worked out in conformity with,

 

and on the basis of, the primacy of the‘

working-class struggle to transform modern
society along socialist lines. This is the key
task in the solution of the general problem
of liquidating human oppression and exploi-
tation. p

This places the struggle for the solution of
the Negro question in direct and strategic
relationship to the present-day movement for
‘progress, and its main social force — the
working class.

II

Changes in the Class Structure of the
Negro People

In the theoretical considerations of the

' solution of the Negro question, our Party in

the past laid ﬁrst stress on the land question.
The chief strategic line was projected in terms
of securing land for the landless Negro
farmers at the expense of the planters, farm
trusts and banks. The thesis behind this ap-
proach was that the breaking up of the plan-
tation and the transfer of the land to the
Negro farm Workers will not only secure the
means of economic sustenance and develop-
ment to the Negro people but will also under-
mine the economic might of the U.S. mono-
polies.

This approach had meaning in a situation
where the majority of the Negro people was
exploited by landlord capital and attached to
the land.

‘At present this strategic approach is no

good at .all, for we are compelled to take ‘

into account the changes that have been oc-
curring in the class structure of the Negro
population.

V in 1900, over 77 per cent of the Negro popu-

    

    

12.

lation lived in the countryside. As late as 1940
about 47 per cent of the Negro population was
urban. By July 1956 some 63 per cent of the

Negro people were urban dwellers, which was‘

in comparable ratio to the 64 per cent urban
for the population as a whole.

Between 1940 and 1950 the Negro popula-
tion in such industrial states as Michigan and
California doubled. In the same decade the
Negroes doubled in 45 cities with a popula-
tion of 50,000 or more each (almost all these
45 cities are outside of the South). There are
now about two dozen northern and western
cities in which the Negro population is in
excess of'l00,000. Of the Negro city dwellers
(64 per cent of all Negroes), 74 per cent live
in 50 major cities.

When the Negro population moves from
the country to the city, and from the “job
poor” city to the “_job rich” city, it translates
itself into a movement from the historical
areas of Negro population concentration in
the southern plantation country (the rural
“Black Belt” counties), the southern cities,
and from the South in general to the North
and West. This movement has resulted in
1) a substantial decline in the absolute num-
bers and ratio of Negroes to white in the
traditional areas of Negro majority -— the

13

rural Black Belt area,* 2) a progressive in-
crease in the numbers and proportion of
Negroes in the population of the larger
southern cities** and 3) a huge growth of
the Negro population in the non-Black Belt
and non-southern sectors.

In other words, the aforementioned ten-
dencies of the Negro migration from the sou-
thern states to the northern and western
states testify to the fact that a number of
objective factors have operated against the
development of the Negro people in the South
as a nation. The accepted Marxist-Leninist
deﬁnition of a nation which Stalin forrnulated
is: “A nation is an historically constituted,
stable community of people, formed on the
basis of a common language, territory, eco-
nomic life and psychological make-up mani-
fested in a common culture.” The key word
in this deﬁnition is “stable.” The capitalist
development in the United States generates
forces which assail the stability of the com-
munities in the ‘South. Two factors gave a
certain durability for a time to the Black Belt
area of Negro majority. The ﬁrst was that the

*In 1940 there were 180 counties of absolute Negro majority.
In 1950 there were 170 counties. —

**In Memphis, T.ennessee, the Negro population increased
from 37.2 per cent in 1950 to 51.2 per cent in 1955; in New
Orleans——from 29 per cent to 35 per cent; in Washington,
D.C.—from 35.4 to 42.5 per cent.

    

    

14

bulk of the Negro people were attached to
the land as sharecroppers, tenants, and im-
poverished farmers. The second was the racist

barriers erected against Negro integration in ,

economic, political and social life.

The fact that a large proportion of the
Negro community’s total population was tied
to the land gave that community a certain
stability. But the demands of industrialization
and the development of mechanization and
technology in agriculture combined to drive
the population from the countryside into the
cities, and furthered the distribution of the
Negro population at the expense of a “stable
community on a common territory.” Today
there remain in the old area of Negro ma-
jority some ﬁve million Negroes of whom less
than 40 per cent are economically attached
to the land.

Not only the operation of the elemental
economic forces expelled and drove Negroes
from their ancestral lands, but the improve-
ments in the area of economic and cultural
opportunity (wrested in the long and ﬁerce
struggle on the part of the Negro people and
their allies) opened attractive small doors to
Negroes, especially in the_ North and West
and in the larger northern cities.

15

As for the contemporary social make-up,
the Negro is the most proletarian of the larger
nationalities which make up the American
nation. ‘

Negroes in the labor force are largely
bound to the lowest rungs of the occupational
ladder by a myriad system of racist preju-
dices, racist laws, caste barriers and wide-
spread prejudices. As for the small percen-
tage of Negroes who have overcome the
“caste” barriers ‘to attain an occupational
status at the level of the skilled categories
or professions, they still face economic dis-
crimination which limits their earning oppor-
tunity in comparison with that of white pro-
fessionals‘ or artisans in the same categories.

In April 1958 there were 7,364,000 Negroes
'in the civilian labor force. Of this total 5,582,-
000 Negroes were employed in industry and
only 758,000 in agriculture. Over a million
Negroes were unemployed. One out of seven
Negro male workers was unemployed.

Whereas in 1940 some 41.2 per cent of the
total of employed Negro men and 16 per
cent of the employed Negro women worked
on farms (as farmers, farm managers and
farm laborers), by April 1957 only 14.8 per
cent of the men and 4.8 per cent of the
women were so engaged. Between 1940 and

    

16

1950 some 608,000 Negro men and 125,000
Negro women left farm employment. This
tendency is peculiar to the more recent period.

Over a year, between April 1957 and April “

1958, an additional 72,000 Negroes left agri-
cultural employment. This constitutes by far
the biggest shift in their occupations and in
their migration. ’ ,

All in all, this has resulted in a basic altera-
tion in the class structure of the Negro people.

Today, the largest strata of employed
Negroes, including both men and women, are
found in the class of industrial workers. The
percentage of workers among the Negroes is
considerably higher than among the White
population. There are 1,032,000 Negro men
and 387,000 Negro Women semi-skilled in-
dustrial Workers. That is 25.2 per cent of the
total of employed Negro men and 15.1 per
cent of the total of employed Negro women.
(The corresponding percentage for white
men is 19.5 and 16.6 per cent for white
women.)

In working out its strategic policy, our
Party draws deﬁnite conclusions from the
above-mentioned changes in the social make-
up of the Negro people.

    

17

The vast changes that have taken place in
the class structure and the urbanization of
the Negro people mean that the- strategic
solution of the Negro question has to be
worked out in terms oﬁstruggle primarily of
the urban working people against industrial
monopoly. In a broad sense, this is a strug-
gle for industrial integration of the Negro
people economically and for their social-
political integration.

. The main class force in the solution of
the Negro question, therefore, is the Working
class and the Negro component part thereof.

This is not at all to say that the struggle
of the Negro farmers for land and ‘for a
higher standard of living and democratic
rights and the action of all democratic forces
against the reactionary plantation system and
the farm trusts are not of great -economic
and even greater political importance, both for
the solution of the Negro question and for
the general democratic transformation of the
South. I

It would be a mistake to underestimate the
struggles of the Negroes in the South, particu-
larly in the Black Belt, because of the,migra-
tion of the Negro population from the South
to the North. Approximately two-thirds of

    

18

the Negro population still live in the South.
There are sizable areas where Negroes make
up the majority or, at any rate, a large part

of the population. This is of great importance i

for the political struggle and economic and
cultural development of the Negro people.
These areas are bases where the Negro free-
dom movement can organize and assert the
mass power of their numbers in struggle to
secure political authority in proportion to
their numerical strength in the population.

The large numbers of Negroes in these
areas enable them to organize mutual aid
and .self-help, improve their well-being and
develop what is distinctive in their culture.

In general, such areas become the centers
of the Negro pe0ple’s movement which draws
into it Negroes living elsewhere.

It should be borne in mind, however, that

. even in the South Negroes are primarily urban

    

workers. In this -connection the chief role in
the struggle to solve the Negro question falls
on the Negro working class. The poor people
in the southern countryside with their eco-
nomic demands and the struggle for land re-
main an important part of the forces ﬁghting
to liberate the Negroes. But they no longer
hold the position they held in the past when

19
the bulk of the Negro population was at-

_ tached to the land.

III
The Social Forces in the Negro Movement

The common destiny of the entire Negro
people suffering from racial and national op-
pression makes possible co-operation between
the various strata of the Negro people in the
ﬁght for equality and freedom. —

a) The Working Class

The working-class stratum of the Negro
population is the ﬁrst and the most impor-
tant of the social forces in the Negro people’s
movement. As already pointed out the work-
ers constitute the most numerous stratum,
and their proportion in the total Negro popu-
lation steadily increases.

The action of the Negro workers is most
effective because they, like their white class
brothers, are concentrated in’ vital centers of
the capitalist production system — in the

. mines, mills and factories.

Not only do the Negro workers seek the
support of their white class brothers in the
Negro movement; they are an important inte-
gral part of the American working class,
comprising 11 per cent of all industrial

WORLD MARXIST REVIEW
V01. 2, No. 7, July 1959‘

‘The article is based on the report made by James E.
‘Jackson (Secretary for Southern and Negro Affairs) at the
December 1958 meeting of the National Committee entitled
“New Features of the Negro Question in the United States.”

HE STRUGGLE waged by the Negro
people in the United States for equality
and freedom is growing and playing an ever
bigger part in the general struggle for social
progress both in the United States and in the
anti-imperialist movement of all oppressed

V peoples.

This. struggle, unfolding in the citadelof
world capitalism, in direct and intimate asso-

ciation with the working-class and popular.

movement, is all the more signiﬁcant because
it is directed against the common oppressor-—

    

 

 
    

 

  

20

workers — 25 per cent of the miners; 30 per
cent of the packing house workers; 15 per
cent of the steel and auto workers; 45 per
cent of the lumber workers, etc. They are able
to help ensure the participation of large sec-
tions of the working class in the Negro move-
ment.

The Negro workers share, the aspirations
of their people and participate in their libera-
tion movement. At the same time they share
the aspirations of the entire American work-
ing class and participate in its struggle
against capitalist exploitation.

Because of‘ their dual identity, the Negro
workers ensure the development of ever
more profound relations of alliance and soli-
darity between the Negro people and the

 

working class. At present, this refers to issues ‘

of immediate interest and, ultimately, this
will affect the questions of fundamental ob-
jectives.

The Communists are tireless in organizing
and stimulating the working masses to cham-
pion the demands .of the Negro people. They
render every material and moral support to
the everyday struggle of the Negro people
for political, economic and social equality,
against national oppression, disenfranchise-
ment, segregation and discrimination.

  

21

b) The Rural Masses
The working farmers and agricultural work-

ers are the second important stratum of the‘

Negropeople. They are mainly impoverished
sharecroppers, tenant farmers and farm
laborers. They live and work in conditions
of the semi-feudal plantation system, under

the barbarous yoke of its slavery-like labor‘

relations, culturaland social degradation and
political oppression.

The organized struggles _of, these rural
Negro masses in unity and parallel With the
action of the working white farmers for land,

"livelihood and liberty, from the oppressive

yoke of the plantation system, represent, po-
tentially, a powerful force of the Negro
people’s movement.

The further development of this front of
struggle to democratic land reform is an in-
dispensable condition for major advancement
on the road to victory‘ for the Negro people’s
movement.

c) The Urban Middle Sections .

This stratum, belonging to the urban middle
sections, constitutes a small percentage of
the Negro population. Yet, individuals from
this stratum exert a great inﬂuence in the

democratic national front of the Negro people.

 

  

22

The professionals and small business people
— by virtue of their greater proﬁciency —
largely dominate the leadership of various
Negro organizations.

This stratum lives, in the main, in much
more favorable material conditions than the
masses of the Negro workers and farm work-
ers. But when compared with the status of

' the urban middle sections of white people,

the Negroes are held down in an inferior
and unequal status by a pattern of discrimi-
nation, segregation,.and racial oppression.

This explains the positive and valuable‘
role this stratum plays in the struggle for
Negro rights. However, their action is not al-
ways "consistent, for they represent the
propertied, higher-income stratum of the
Negro people and are inﬂuenced by conserva-
tism and tend to compromise, protect their
vested property interests‘ and yield to -the
bank and big business pressure.

The middle sections of the Negro people

_will remain a component part of the Negro

 

people’s movement. However, the present
leadership of this movement is a temporary
phenomenon. Eventually it must give way to
the leadership of the working masses which
make up the Negro people, andespecially to
the working class. _

  

23

d) The Negro Capitalists-

This segment of the Negro population num-
bers only a few thousands. They are found
in the category of small capitalists largely
limited to the service ﬁelds of enterprise
(insurance, small loan companies, undertak-
er’s oﬂices, barbers’- shops, newspapers and
magazines). There are no Negro industrial
capitalists ‘engaged in manufacturing com-
modities on a large scale. Only a small
fraction (20,000) of the Negro working peo-
ple is exploited as wage-earners at the en-
terprises of more or less sizable Negro capi-
talists.

The Negro capitalists also fall under the
yoke of discrimination. Their investment op-

portunities are usually limited to the Negro .

consumer and service market. In matters
of securing bank credits, marketing of their
products or services, securing licenses and
franchises to do business, they confront bar-
riers of national exclusion and discrimina-
tion. Although there are “mixed capital”
enterprises (that is, Negro and white in-
vestors) operated by Negro capitalists, no
Negro “comprador” bourgeoisie exists. The
Negro market is exploited directly by the
big white merchants and capitalists, and

 

  

24-

not through the agency of Negro “compra-
dors” as is often the case in colonies.

The Negro capitalists enjoy no favored
social amenities or freedom from Jim Crow
oppression, from racial discrimination. This
is the common lot of all Negroes regardless
of their class status.

Hence the antagonisms and contradictions
between the Negro capitalist and dominant
monopoly capital. This motivates the Negro
capitalists to enter into the Negro move-
ment, often. jointly with working people,
against the ruling circles of white monopo-
lists.

While striving to ensure the leadership
of. the workers, we must draw a larger part
of the Negro capitalists into the movement
against discrimination or ally it to the pro-
gressive and peace forces. It is also neces-
sary for the workers to combat the con-
servative inﬂuence of the Negro capitalists
within this movement and the consequences
of their narrow-mindedness.

ti: * >13

Such is the broad class spread, the social
base of the Negro movement within which
there is struggle between the bourgeoisie

 

  

25

and the working class for dominance in the
leadership and policies of the Negro organi-
zations. ’

The working, class will acquire an ever
greater importance in the Negro people's
movement for freedom. The high proportion
of working people among the Negro popula-
tion means that this movement will increas-
ingly reﬂect the inﬂuence and strivings of
the working class in its program, policy,
leadership, alliances, immediate and ﬁnal
goals.

The relation of class forces in the Negro
movement is obviously in favor of the Work-
ing class. This helps to establish its leading
role, without which no success in the libera-
tion of the Negroes is possible.

IV
The Slogans and Tasks of Communists

The reappraisal by our Party of the “self-
determination” slogan required its replace-
ment by a concept and a slogan which ex-
press a more accurate and scientiﬁc solution
to the Negro question in the United States.

Such a slogan must reﬂect an urgent prob-
lem'——governmental power for the oppressed
Negro majority population. This must be ac-

  

26

companied by the struggle for radical agra-
rian reform in the traditional areas with

is referred to as the “Black Belt.”

In the past, the Communist Party program
on the Negro question was expressed as
follows: ,

“The Communist Party stands for the full
economic, political, social and cultural equa-
lity for the Negro people, including the right
to self-determination in the Black Belt.”

The Party's position (as stated in the Na-
tional Committee’s draft resolution to be sub-
mitted to the Party convention in November
1959) is now formulated as follows:

“The Communist Party of the United States
stands for the full equality of the Negro peo-
ple: their inalienable right to a fully integrated
-participation in the political, economic, social,
and cultural life of America, including the
right to the guarantee of genuinely represen-
tative government in the South, with propor-
tionalrepresentation, in the areas of Negro
majority population.”

‘ Our Party takes into account the fact that
in its present stage the Negro people’s move-
ment advances the program demanding ele-
mentary democratic rights and liberties, in-

   
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

most backward agrarian relations, intense _
poverty and brutal landlord rule in what,

  

27

cluding equal civil rights and economic poten;
tialities and social justice. The Negro move-
ment opposes racial segregation and discri-
mination; it demands political, economic and
social equality both for individuals and the
entire Negro people.

It strives to rally all forces of the Negro
people in active struggle for these pressing
common demands. It likewise strives to draw
the vast masses of the white population into
the struggle for equal rights for Negroes.

The common objective of Negroes, where-
ever they may live in the United States, is
to abolish segregation and free themselves
from any discrimination. American Negroes
aspire to legal equality with their white
countrymen in the political, economic and
cultural life of the country. The popular ex-
pression “to ﬁght for Negro rights” is under-
stood by the Negro people as the slogan of
struggle for these general objectives.

To be able to attain these objectives, the
Negro people must secure, in particular, their
full and rightful share of governmental power.
In those urban and rural communities where
they constitute the majority, especially in the
Deep South area—the historic cradle-land of
American Negroes—they must be in the
majority in local government bodies.

 

  

28

In its essence, therefore, the struggle for
Negro rights is‘ not a mere “civil rights”

 

movement. It is a political struggle for a just i

share of representation nationally; a struggle
for the majority rule in the localities where
they are the dominant people in the popula-
tion; a struggle for genuinely democratic re-
presentative government in the country as
a whole and in the southern states in parti-
cular.

At the heart of the political struggle for
Negro rights at the present time is the ﬁght
for suffrage rights. Accompanying this de-
mand is the ﬁght for Negro representation.

To register successes in this respect, cer-
tain things are required in our opinion: mobi-
lizing the Negro people and theirallies in
support of both Negro candidates and’ “unity”
candidates committed to a program of equal
rights for Negroes; mutual assistance pacts for
political action; the strengthening of the alli-
ance between the organized Negro suffrage
movement and the Negro electorate on the
one hand, and the organized labor movement
and popular democratic rights and peace
movement on the other.

The linking of the particular struggle of
the Negro people_ for their rights to the

  

29

general struggle of labor for democratic ad-'
vancement and peace, for the‘ welfare of
the country as a whole, is required for win-
ning both immediate and long range suc-
cesses. As a minority people in the country
as a whole, victory of the Negro people is
unthinkable except on the basis that the
struggle is fought in alliance with the oppress-
ed majority of the whole people, i.e., with
the working class, the poor farmer masses,
and the other strata victimized by the mono-
polists.

In order to unite the Negro people and
forge the alliance between them and organ-
ized labor it is especially important for the
Negro workers to exercise the initiative, and
provide leadership.

The Communists work to ensure the most
concrete leadership of the left, progressive
forces in (1) the trade unions and (2) in the
Negro mass organizations. These are the
primary channels through which the Negro
masses and -labor movement are reached and
rallied into the ﬁght for Negro rights.

There is no greater task for the Commun-
ists and class-conscious workers _~than that
of furthering the bonds of class unity and
brotherhood between Negro and white work-
ers. The Communists strive to stand in the

3

the monopolies. The efforts to cement a
Labor-Negro alliance by mass action for
Negro rights are designed to lay" the corner-
stone for a broad anti-monopoly coalition on
which the progressive future of the country
depends. At the same time the struggle for
Negro rights and equality, taking place
against the background of the upsurge of the
national-liberation movement in Africa, Asia
and Latin America, undoubtedly furthers the
cause of world peace and security.

These points were emphasized in the poli-.

tical resolution adopted at the Communist
Party’s 16th National Convention. In the sec-
tion headed “Rally to the Banner of Struggle
for Negro Freedom——Key to Strengthening
American Democracy” it is stated: “The ques-
tion of Negro freedom, then, is the crucial
domestic issue of the day, and a factor of
growing international consequence.”

The fact that today, almost 100 years after
Lincolnissued the famous proclamation abol-
ishing slavery, the Negro people are meeting
with the ﬁerce‘ resistance of reaction in their
ﬁg-ht for freedom, equality and elementary
rights, reveals the hypocrisy of those "Who
extol the “free world’’ and “American de-
mocracy.”

This article does not cover all the aspects

 

30

forefront of the struggle to smash every re-
maining color bar and anti-Negro prejudice,
or manifestation of racial prejudices- in the

trade union and other working-class organiza-‘

tions. The Communists stand forth as tireless
ﬁghters for the integration of Negro workers
on the basis of full equality in the life and
affairs of the trade unions. ‘They ceaselessly
work to inﬂuence the trade unions to struggle
for full equality in job rights for the Negro
workers, equal pay for equal work, job clas-
siﬁcation, training and promotion; to put an
end to any discrimination in terms of em-
ployment in all branches of industry. The
Communists strive to participate actively in
solving the urgent task of the American
labor movement: to draw millions of un-
organized Negro and white workers, especial-
ly in the South, into the trade unions.

The Communists devote particular atten-
tion to the development of the Negro people’s
movement in the southern states. Our Party
champions the democratic rights of the Negro
people to equality in every sphere of Ameri-
can life. It also supports the right of the
Negro population in the South to develop
freely and fully. The Party works to ensure
that the Negro people, the working class and
all other democratic forces wage a sustained

    

  

31

and concerted struggle for the immediate rea-
lization of measures which would create those
democratic conditions in the South in general,
and in the Black Belt area of Negro majority
in particular, for the Negro people there to
freely exercise their rights to determine the
course of their own development.

The task of the Communists is to
advance the inﬂuence of the policies of the
working class and consolidate the forces of
the left trend within the established organi-
zations of the Negro people, of labor, poor
farmers and their allies among the middle
sections.

So that the Party and the working class
may fulﬁl their responsibility Communists at-
tach particular importance to strengthening
the Communist Party in the -South in general
and among the southern workers in particu-
lar. " C

The Negro peop1e’s struggle for equality is
an organic part of the democratic struggle
of the exploited classes and oppressed peoples
on a national and worldwide scale. It is a
separate sector but an indivisible part of the
struggle of the working people of our coun-

try and the entire capitalist world for se- 4

curity, peace, ‘democracy and genuine free-
dom.

of the present_-day situation and the struggle
of the Negro people in the United States. It
dwells only on some of the theoretical aspects
of the problem.

I
V Presentation of the Question ’

The Negro question in the United States is
a national question; it is one of the many
varieties of the national question embraced
by Marxist-Leninist science. '

Marxism.-Leninism requires a concrete
presentation of similar problems. “An ab-
stract presentation of the question of na-
tionalism is of no use at all,” wrote Lenin in
his letter “On the Question of Nationalities or
on Autonomization” (December 1922). This
point, which expresses the key to the Leninist
approach to the national question, provides
the guiding line for a theoretical analysis of
the Negro problem. The latter should be
treated with due account of the speciﬁc con-
ditions obtaining in the country and of some
peculiarities of the status and the struggle of
the Negroes.

American Negroes constitute some 11 per
cent of the total population. The Negro popu-
lation has doubled since 1900 (from 9,185,000
to 17,922,000 in 1957)-. ‘

The Negro people are the most severely op-
pressed and exploited of all the peoples who

. make up the American nation.

But the Negroes in the United States. are
not constituted as a separate nation. They
rather have the characteristics of a racially
distinctive people or nationality and consti-
tute a historically determined component part
of the whole American nation which, as -is
well known, isitself an historically derived
national formation, an amalgam of more or
less well differentiated nationalities. _ .

Though deprived of equal rights and of the
possibility to participate fully in all aspects
of, the national life, the Negro people (no
less than the other national components) have
contributed to, and have an inseparable stake
in the American nation’s common territory,
economic life, language, culture, and psycho-
logical make-up. '

As a result of their singular historical ex-
periences the Negro people strive to attain
a status in the life of the American nation
free of all manner of oppression, social ostra-
cism, economic discrimination, ‘political in
equality, and racial segregation. '

To conclude that the Negro people _in the
U.S. are not a nation is not to say that the
Negro question in our country is not a na-

tional question. It is indeed a national ques-
tion. The question is, however, a national
question of what type,'With what distinguish-
ing characteristics, calling for what strategic
concept for its solution? ’

In working out the correct theoretical
presentation of the Negro question, it is neces-
sary to appreciate the scope of the national
question in Marxist thought. Marxism-
Leninism regards the national question from
the viewpoint of liberating the oppressed
nations and nationalities, linking this task
with the struggle for liberation of the work-
ing class from the yoke of capitalism in a
given country and on a world scale.

The national question exists in an inﬁnite
variety of forms and manifestations. Within
the scope of the national question, there is
included not merely the question of the nation,
but also the question of national minorities,
national and ethnic groups, national-ethnic
minorities, national-communal (religious)
groups, etc.

The national question in each country must
be viewed at all times in the context of its
relationship to the main social forces of his-
torical development. That is to say, it_ would
be a feckless exercise to present the Negro
question in the United States divorced from

the historical and social-national and world
inﬂuences‘ which bear upon and in large
measure decide the frame in which it can be
resolved.

We were in error to limit our frame of
reference in Marxist writing on the national
question to that of the nation in seeking
scientiﬁc guiding lines to an analysis and
presentation of the Negro question in -the
United States. We incorrectly selected the
Marxist principle of self-determination for op-
pressed nations up to secession as the pri-
mary category into which we sought to com-
press the Negro question. By selecting a
Marxist principle which has unimpeachable
validity in reference to the rights and logical
course of development of oppressed nations,
we naturally were led to focus upon the dis-
tinctive nation—1ike features and characteris-
tics of the Negro people as the thing of almost
exclusive importance in the Negro question
in the U.S. But of no less importance in the
life and history of the Negro people is the
fact that they constitute a part (although the
part most deprived of rights) of the American
nation, that they have alwaysfought to ob-
tain the full rights of the American nation.

The path of development of the Negro peo-
ple towardthe achievement of equality does

  

8

not take the route of struggle for national
independence, political-geographical sove-
reignty and stateho_od. The Negro people in
the United States historically, now, and most

 

probably for the future, seeks a solution to its ‘

national question in struggle for securing
equality in political, economic, and social
ﬁelds as a component part_of the American
nation. This.course ofdevelopment is in con-
formity with the famous words of Marx that
“mankind always sets for itself only those
tasks it can solve.’’

This tendency corresponds to the sociologi-
cal and economic forces operating objectively

"upon the development of the Negro people.

 

These objective forces are centrifugal. They"
operate, as we shall point out later, against
the progressive build-up, of closed areas of
settlement in the countryside or in the towns
of the Black Belt. '

By not posing the Negro question as a
question of an oppressed nation_ ﬁghting for
national-state. sovereignty, are we thereby
diminishing the revolutionary import of the
Negro people's struggle in the United States?
No. A special feature of the American road
to socialism is revealed in the fact that the
requisite preparation of the forces for effect-
ing fundamental social change in the system

necessitates the completion of the bourgeoi-
democratic norms of political, economic and
social -development for the South and the
Negro people as a whole. Furthermore, unity
of the American working class with its allies
in the struggle for progressive social changes
is impossible without the abolition of the color
bar.

The struggle of the Negro people for demo-
cratic goals — political, economic and social
equality — is a powerful tributary which
flows into the general stream of the working-
class struggle and swells the torrential po-wer
of the forces of social advance. The elemen-

tary democratic demands of the Negro people

can be met only at the expense of the monopo-
lists and Dixiecrats, by strengthening the
popular forces and depriving the monopoly
ruling circle of the means of political oppres-
sion and extracting superproﬁts. The Negro
people’s struggle for freedom and equality
unfolds in close association with the progres-
sive movement of the Working people and is
directed against the class oppressors (the
White monopolists and ruling circles) and not
against the “native compradors.” Any action
in the Negro people’s struggle which unfolds
within the bosom of American imperialism-
