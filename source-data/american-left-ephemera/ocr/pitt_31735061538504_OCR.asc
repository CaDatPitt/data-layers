cultural development of humanity. Not the defense of the na-
tional state is the task of the proletariat but its complete and ﬁnal
lliquidation. M

12. xWere the present national state to represent a progressive
factor, it would have to be defended irrespective of its political
form and of course regardless of who “started” the war first. It is
absurd to confuse the question of the historic function of the na-
tional state with the question of the “guilt” of a given government.
Can one refuse to save a house suited for habitation just because
the ﬁre started through carelessness or through evil intent of the
owner? But here it is precisely a case of the given house being
ﬁt not for living but merely for dying. To enable the peoples to
live the structure of the national state must be razed to its founda-
tions.

13. A “socialist” who preaches national defense is a petty
bourgeois reactionaryat the service of decaying capitalism. Not
to bind itself to the national state in time of war, to follow not
the war map but the map of the class struggle, is possible only for
that party which has already declared irreconcilable war on the
national state in time of peace. Only by realizing fully the ob-
jectively reactionary role of the imperialist state, can the prole-
tarian vanguard become invulnerable to all types of social patriot-
ism. This means that a real break with the ideology and policy
of “national defense” is possible only from the standpoint of the
international proletarian revolution.

THE NATIONAL QUESTION AND IMPERIALIST .WAR

I4. The working class is not indifferent to its nation. On the
contrary, just because history ‘places the fate of the nation into its
hands, the working class refuses to entrust the work of national
freedom and independence to imperialism which “saves” the nation
only to subject it on the morrow to new mortal dangers for the
sake of the interests of an insigniﬁcant minority of exploiters.

15. Having used the nation for its development, capitalism has
nowhere, in no single corner of the world, solved fully the national
problem. The borders of the Europe of Versailles are carved out
of the living body of the nations. The idea of recarving capital-
ist Europe to make state boundaries coincide with national boun-
daries is the sheerest kind of utopia. No government will cede an
inch of its ground by peaceful means. A new war would carve
Europe anew in accordance with the war map and not in .corres-..
pondence to the boundaries of nations. The task of complete

national ‘determination and peaceful cooperation of a1,l__pe.o.,p.les of .

IQ ‘

 

Europe can be solved only on the basis of the economic uniﬁcation
of Europe, purged of bourgeois rule. The slogan of the United
States of Europe is a slogan not only for‘ the salvation of the
Balkan and Danubian peoples but for the salvation of the peoples
of Germany and ‘France as well.

16. A special and important place is occupied by the question
of colonial and semi-colonial countries of the East which are even
now ﬁghting for the independent national state. Their struggle is
doubly progressive: tearing the backward peoples from Asiatism,
sectionalism and foreign bondage, they strike powerful blows at
the imperialist states. But it must be clearly understood before-
hand that the belated revolutions in Asia and Africa are incapable
of opening up a new epoch of renaissance for the national state.

_ The liberation of the colonies will be merely a gigantic episode in

the world socialist revolution, just as the belated democratic over-
turn in Russia, which was also a semi-colonial country, was only
the introduction to the socialist revolution.

17. In South America where belated and already decaying
capitalism is supporting the conditions of semi-feudal, that is semi-
slavish existence, world antagonisms create a sharp struggle of
compradore cliques, continual overturns within the states and pro-
tracted armed conﬂicts between the states.’ The American bour-
geoisie which was able during its historic rise to unite into one
federation the Northern half of the American continent now uses
all its power which grew out of this to disunite, weaken and enslave
its Southern half. South and Central America will be able to tear
themselves out of backwardness and enslavement only by uniting
all their states into one powerful federation. But not the belated
South—America11 bourgeoisie, a thoroughly venal agency of foreign
imperialism, will be called upon to solve this task, but the young
South—American proletariat, as the chosen leader of the oppressed
masses. The slogan in the struggle against violence and intrigues
of world imperialism and against the bloody work of native com-
pradore cliques is therefore: the S oviet United’ States of South and
Central America. ‘

The national problem merges everywhere with the social. Only
the conquest of power by the world proletariat can assure a real
and lasting freedom of development for all nations of our planet.

THE DEFENSE or DEMOCRACY

.18. The ‘sham of national defense is covered up wherever
possible by the additional sham of .,the defense of democracy. _If

even'n‘ow,' in the imperialist epoch, Marxists do not identify’

JII

 

democracy with fascism and are ready at any moment to repel
fascism’s encroachment upon democracy, must not the proletariat

in case of war support the democratic governments against the '

fascist governments?

Flagrant sophism! We defend democracy against _fascism by
means of the organizations and methods of the proletariat. Con-
trary to social democracy, we do not entrust this defense to the
bourgeois state (“Staat, greif zu!”). And if we remain in
irreconcilable opposition to the most “democratic” government in
time of peace, how can we take upon ourselves even a shadow of
responsibility for it in time of war when all the infamies and
crimes of capitalism take on a most brutal and bloody form?

19. A modern war between the great powers does not signify
a conﬂict between democracy and fascism but a struggle of two
imperialisms for the re—division of the world. Moreover, the war
must inevitably assume an international character and in both
camps will be found fascist (semi-fascist, bonapartist, etc.) as well
as “democratic” states. The republican form of French imperial-
ism did not prevent it from basing itself in peacetime on the mili-
tary-bourgeois dictatorship in Poland, Jugoslavia and Rournania,
as it will not prevent it, in case of necessity, from restoring the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy as a barrier against the uniﬁcation of
Austria with Germany. Finally, in France itself, parliamentary
democracy, already sufﬁciently weakened today, would undoubtedly
one of the ﬁrst victims of war if it is not upset before its start.

20. The bourgeoisie of a number of civilized countries has
already shown and is continuing to show how, in case of internal

danger, it changes without much ado the parliamentary form of

its rule for an authoritarian, dictatorial, Bonapartist or a fascist
form. It will make the change that much faster and more decisive-
ly in time of war when both internal and external dangers will
threaten its basic class interests with ten-fold force. Under these
conditions the support by a workers’ party of “its” national im-
perialism for the sake of a fragile democratic shell means the re-
nunciation of an independent policy and the chanvinistic demoral-
ization of the workers, that is, the destruction of the only factor
which can save humanity from disaster.

21. “The struggle for democracy” in time of war would
signify above all the struggle for the preservation of the workers’
press and of workers’ organizations against unbridled military cen-
sorshipfand military authority. , On the basis of these tasksthe
revolutioinary vanguard will seek a united front with other working

in no case unity -with its own government "against the hostile.

country;

22. An imperialist war stands above the question of the state
form of capitalist rule. It places before each national bourgeoisie
the question of the fate of national capitalism and before the
bourgeoisie of all countries——the question of the fate of cappitalism
in general. pOnly thus must the proletariat too pose the question:
capitalism or socialism, the triumph of one of the imperialist camps
or the proletarian revolution. '

DEFENSE OF SMALL AND NEUTRAL STATES

23. The concept of national defense, especially when it coin‘-
cides with the idea of the defense of democracy, can most easily
delude the workers of small and neutral countries (Switzerland,
partly Belgium, Scandinavian countries . . .) which, being incap-
able pf engaging in an independent policy of conquest, impart to the
defense of their national borders the character of an irrefutable
and absolute dogma. But precisely by the example of Belgium
we see how naturally formal neutrality is replaced by a system of
imperialist pacts, and how inevitably war for “national defense”
leads to an annexationist peace. The character of war is deter-
mined not by the initial episode taken by itself (“violation of neu-

7! (K

' trality , enemy invasion”, etc.) but by the main moving forces of

war, by its whole development and by the consequences to which
it ﬁnally leads. , ‘

24. It can be readily accepted that the Swiss bourgeoisie will
not take upon itself the initiative of war. In this sense it has far
more formal r_ight than any other bourgeoisie to speak of its de-
fensizze position. But from the moment that Switzerland may ﬁnd
itself drawn into the war by the course of events it would enter
the struggle of the world powers in the pursuit of equally imper-
ialist aims, Should neutrality be violated, the Swiss bourgeoisie
will unite with the stronger of the two attacking sides, regard-

less of which bears the greater responsibility for the ,viola— __

tion ofneutrality, and in which camp there is more “democracy”.
Thus, during the lastiivvagj Belgium, th_e_ally of Cgarisrn, .])y ,n_9

independence. Just as the preceding war swept away the neutrality
of Belgium so the new war will leave no trace of Swiss indepen-
dence. Whether after the war Switzerland will retain its entity as
a state even though without its independence, or whether-it will be
divided among Germany, France and Italy depends on a number
of European and world factors among which the “national de-
fense” of Switzerland will occupy an insigniﬁcant place.

We s_ee therefore that for neutral, democratic Switzerland also,
a state possessing no colonies and where the idea of national de-

ifense appears before us in its purest form, the laws of imperialism

make no exception. To the demand of the bourgeoisie: “Join the
policy of national defense”, the Swiss proletariat must retort by a

policy of class defense so as to go over next to a revolutionary
advance. ‘

THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL AND WAR

25. The commandment of national defense follows from the
dogma that the national solidarity of classes stands above the class
struggle. In reality no possessing class ever recognized the defense
of the fatherland as such, that is, under any and all conditions,
but rather covered up by this formula the protection of its privi-
leged position in the fatherland. Qverthrown ruling classes al-
ways become “d’efeatists”; that is, are ready to restore their privi-
leged position with the aid of foreign arms. I

The oppressed classes, not conscious of their own interests and
used to sacriﬁces, accept the slogan “national defense” at face
value; that is, as an absolute duty which stands above the classes.
Te basic historic crime of the parties of the Second International
consists in their fostering and strengthening the slavish habits and
traditions of the oppressed, in neutralizing their revolutionary
indignation and falsifying their class consciousness with the aid
of patriotic ideas.

If the European proletariat did not overthrow the bourgeoisie
at the end of the great war; if humanity writhes now in the agonies
of the crisis; if a new war threatens to transform cities and vil-
lages into heaps of ruins,—the chief responsibility for these crimes
and calamities falls on the Second International.

26. The policy of social-patriotism rendered the masses help-
less before fascism. If in time of war it is necessary to reject the
class struggle for the sake of national interests, it is also necessary-
to‘ renounce “Marxism” in the epoch of a great economic crisis
which endangers “the nation” no less than war. Back in April

I915 Rosa Luxemburg exhausted this question with the following
words: “Either the class struggle is the imperative law of prole-
tarian existence also during war . . . 'or the class struggle is a
crime against national interests and the safety of the fatherland
also in time of peace.” The idea of “national interests” and the
“safety of the fatherland” has been transformed by fascism into
chains and fetters for the proletariat. '

27. The German social democracy supported Hitler's foreign
policy up to the very moment that he drove_ it out. The ﬁnal re-
placement of democracy by fascism revealed that social democracy
remains patriotic just so long as the political regime assures it its
proﬁts and ‘privileges. Finding themselves in emigration, the
former Hohenzollern patriots turn about face and are ready to
welcome a preventive war of the French bourgeoisie against Hitler.
Without any difficulty the Second International amnestied Wels
& Co. who would on the morrow be reconverted into ardent patriots
if only the German-bourgeoisie should beckon them back with one
little ﬁnger.

28. The French, Belgian and other socialists responded to the
German events by an open alliance with their own bourgeoisie on
the question of “national defense”. While ofﬁcial France was
carrying on a “small”, “insigniﬁcant” but exceptionally atrocious
war against Morocco, the French social democracy and reformist
trade unions discussed at their congresses the inhumanity of war
in general, having in mind thereby chieﬂy the war of revenge on
the part of Germany. Parties which support the brutalities of
colonial robberies, where it is merely a question of new proﬁts, will
support with eyes shut any national government in a great war
where the fate of the bourgeois republic itself will be involved.

29. The incompatibility of socia1—democratic policy with the-
historic interests of the proletariat is incomparably deeper and‘
sharper now than on the eve of the imperialist war. The struggle
with the patriotic prejudices of the masses means above all an
irreconcilable struggle against the Second International as an.
organization, as a party, as a program, as a banner.

CENTRISM AND WAR

30. The first imperialist war completely dissolved the Seconcl

‘International as a revolutionary party and thereby created the

necessity and possibility of creating the Third International. But
the republican “revolution” in Germany and Austro-Hungary, the
democratization of suffrage in a number‘ of countries, concessions

wor1d'crisis—all the possibilities on the road of .r.efom_1s'.pro.ved
exhausted. The bourgeoisie passed ever to counterattack, The

"social-democracy treacherously gave up one gain after another". All

species of reformism—parliamentarian, trade union, rn_un_icipal,

‘cooperative “‘socialism”—-have suffered irreparable bankruptcies

and catastrophies in recent years. As a result of this, the prepara-

‘ tion “fora new war ﬁnds the ‘Second International with a broken
‘spine. The social-democratic parties are undergoing an intensive
process of discoloration. Consistent reforrnism takes on new color,

it becomes silent or splits 01?. Its place is being _taken by various

"shadings ofcentrism either in the ‘form’ of numerous fractions

within the old parties, or as independent organizations. .
31. On the question of the defense of the fatherland masked
reformist: and right centrists (Leon Blum, Henri de Man,
Robert Grimm, Martin Tranmael, Otto Bauer, and others) resort
increasingly to diploma-tic, confused, conditional formulations cal-
culated at one and the same time to pacify the bourgeoisie and to
fool the workers. They put forward economic “plans” or a series
of social demands, promising to defend the fatherland fro_m ex-
ternal “fascism” to the extent that the national bourgeoisie will
support their program. The purpose in thus posing the question
consists in glossing over the question of the class character of the
state, evading the problem of the conquest of power and, ‘under the

cover of a “socialist” plan, in dragging in the defense of the capi- '

talist fatherland.

32. The left centrists, who are in turn distinguished by a great
number of shadings (S.A.P. in Germany, O.S.P. in Holland, I.L.P.
in England, the,Zyromski and Marceau Pivert groups in France
and others) arrive in words at the renunciation of the defense of
the fatherland. But from this bare renunciation they do not draw
the necessary practical conclusions. The greater half of their
internationalism, if not nine tenths of_it, bears a platonic character.

stands ‘the king’s footman, Vandervelde. Expressing at certain

’ moments the leftward shift of the masses, in the ﬁnal analysis the

centrists put a brake upon the revolutionary re-grouping within
the proletariat and consequently also upon the struggle against war.
33. In its very essence centrism means half-heartedness and
vacillation. But the problem of war is least of all favorable for
the policy of vacillation. For the masses centrism is always only
a short transition stage. The growing danger of war will make
for ever sharper differentiation within the cen-trist groupings which
now dominate the workers’ movement. The proletarian vanguard
will be the better armed for the struggle against war the sooner
and more fully it will free its mind from the web of centrism. A
necessary condition for successon this road is to pose clearly and
irreconcilably all questions connected with war. N

SOVIET DIPLOMACY AND THE INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTION

34. After the conquest of power the proletariat itself goes over
to the position of the “defense of the fatherland”. But this
formula thenceforward acquires an entirely new historic content.
The isolated workers’ state is not a self-suﬂicing entity but only a
drill ground‘ for the world revolution. Defending the U. S. S. R.,
the proletariat defends not national boundaries but a socialist dic-
tatorship temporarily hemmed in by national borders. Only a deep
understanding of the fact that the proletarian revolution cannot
ﬁnd completion within the national framework; that without the
victory of the proletariat in the leading countries all the successes
of socialist construction in the U. S. S. R. are doomed to failure;
that other than through the international revolution there is no
salvation"for_ any country in the world; that the socialist society
can be built only on the basis of international cooperation,—only

this ﬁrm conviction, penetrating into the very blood and marrow,

can create a safe basis for revolutionary proletarian policy in time
of war. »

35. The foreign policy of the Soviets ﬂowing from the theory
of socialism in one country, that is, the actual ignoring of the prob-
lems of the international revolution, is based on_two ideas: general
disarmamentand mutual rejection of aggression. That in search
of diplomatic guarantees the Soviet government has to resort to a
purely ‘formalistic presentation of the problems of war and peace
follows from the conditions of capitalist encirclement. But these
methods of adaptation to the enemy, forced upon it by the feeble-
ness 7of”'the international revolution and ‘to a great extent by the

previous mistakes of the Soviet government itself, can by, no means
be raised into a universal system. But the acts and speeches of
Soviet diplomacy, which have long transgressed the limit of un-
avoidable admissible practical compromises have been laid down
as the sacred and inviolable basis for the international policy of
the Third International and have become the source of the most
ﬂagrant paciﬁst illusions and social-patriotic blunders.

36. Disarmament is not a means against war, since, as the
experience of Germany itself shows, episodic disarmament is only
a stage on the road to new re-armament. The possibility of new
and very rapid rearmament is inherent in modern industrial tech-
nique. “General” disarmament, even if it could be realized, would
only mean the strengthening of the military superiority of the more
powerful industrial countries. “Fifty percentdisarmament” is not
:the road to complete disarmament but to absolute Ioo% re-arma-
ment. To present disarmament as “the only real means to prevent
war” is to mislead the workers for the sake of a common front
with petty-bourgeois paciﬁsts. _

/ 37. We cannot for one moment dispute the right of the Soviet
government to deﬁne with the greatest precision the term aggres-
sion in any given agreement with the imperialists. But to at-
tempt to transform this conditional legalistic formula into a su-
preme regulator of international relations, is to substitute conserva-
tive criteria for revolutionary criteria, reducing the international
-policy of the proletariat to the defense of the existing annexations
and borders set up by force.

38. \Ve are not paciﬁsts. We consider a revolutionary war
just as much a means of proletarian policy as an uprising. Our
attitude to war is determined not by the legalistic formula of “ag-
rgression" but by the question of which class carries on the War
and for what aims. In the conflict of states, just as in the class
-struggle, “defense” and “aggression” are only questions of practical
expediency and not of a juridical or ethical norm. The bare criter-
ion of aggression creates a base of support for the social patriotic
policy of Messrs. Leon Blum, Vandervelde and others, who thanks
to Versailles, are given the possibility of defending imperialist
lbooty under the guise of defending peace. .

39. Stalin’s famous formula “We do not want an inch of ~

‘foreign soil but will not give up an inch of ours” represents a
-conservative program for the preservation of the status quo in
radical contradiction to the aggressive nature of proletarian revolu-
tion. The ‘ideology of socialism in one country leads inevitably to

.18

the blurring of the reactionary role of the national state, to concili-
ation with it-,, to its idealization, to reducing the importance of
revolutionary infernationalism.

40. The leaders of the Third International justify the policy
of Soviet diplomacy on the ground that the workers’ state must
utilize the contradictions in the camp of imperialism. This state-
ment, indisputable in itself, needs concretization, however.

The foreign policy of each class is the continuation and devel-
opment of its internal policy. If the proletariat in power must
discern and utilize the contradictions in the camp of its external
enemies, the proletariat which is still ﬁghting for power, must
know how to discern and utilize the contradictions in the camp of
its internal enemies. The fact that the Third International proved
absolutely incapable of understanding and utilizing the contradic-
tions between reformist democracy and fascism led directly to the
greatest defeat of the proletariat and brought it face to face with
the danger of a new war.

On the other hand the contradictions between the imperialist
governments must be utilized in no other way than from the point
of view of the international revolution. The defense of the
U. S. S. R. is conceivable only if the international proletarian van-
guard be independent of the policy of Soviet diplomacy, if there
be complete freedom to show up its nationalist conservative meth-
ods, which are directed against the interests of the international
revolution and thus also against the interests of the Soviet Union.

U.  S. R. AND IMPERIALIST COMBINATIONS

41. The Soviet government is now in the. process of changing
its course with regard to the League of Nations. The Third In-
ternational, as usual, repeats slavishly the words and gestures of
Soviet diplomacy. All sorts of “ultra-lefts” take advantage of
this turn to relegate the Soviet Union once again among the bour-
geois states. Social democracy, depending on its particular na-
tional considerations, interprets the “reconciliation” of the U.S.S.R.
with the League of Nations as proof of the bourgeois nationalistic
character of the policy of Moscow, or on the contrary, as the re-
habilitation of the League of Nations and in general the whole
ideology of paciﬁsm. In this question, too, the Marxian point of
view has nothing in common with any one of these petty bourgeois
evaluations.

Our attitude in principle to the League of Nations does not
differ from our attitude to each and every individual imperialist

state whether in or out of the League of Nations. The maneuvring
of the Soviet state between the antagonistic groupings of imperial-
ism presupposes a policy of maneuvre with regard to the League
of Nations as well. So long as Japan and Germany were in the
League the latter threatened to become an arena for agreement of
the most important imperialistrobbers at the expense of he U. S.
S. R. After Japan and Germany, the most immediate and chief
enemies of the Soviet Union, quit the League of Nations, it
changed partly into a bloc of allies and vassels of French imperial-
ism, partly into an arena of struggle among France, England and
Italy. This or that combination with the League of Nations may
be forced upon the Soviet state, steering between imperialist camps
equaly hostile to it in essence.

42. Giving oneself a fully realistic account of the existing
situation the proletarian vanguard must at the same time place in
the foreground the following considerations:

a) the necessity for the U. S. S. R.,‘ sixteen and more years
after the October overturn to seek a rapproachement with the
League and to cover up this rapproachement with abstract pacifist
formulae is the result of the extreme weakening of the international
proletarian revolution and by that of the international position of
the U. S. S. R.

b) abstract paciﬁst formulations of Soviet diplomacy and its
compliments directed to the League of Nations have nothing in
common with the policy of the international proletarian party,
which refuses to bear any responsibility for them, but on the con-
trary, exposes their hollowness and hypocrisy, the better to mobil-
ize the proletariat on the basis of a clear understanding of actual
forces and real antagonisms.

43. In the existing situation an alliance of the U. S. S. R. with
an imperialist state or with one imperialist combination against
another, in case of war, cannot’ at all be considered as excluded.
Under the pressure of circumstances a temporary alliance of this
kind may become an iron necessity, without ceasing, however,
because of it, to be of the greatest danger both to the U. S. S. R.
and to the world revolution.

The international proletariat will not decline to defend the
U. S. S. R. even if the latter should ﬁnd itself forced into a military
alliance with some imperialists against others. But in this case,
even more than in any other, the international proletariat must
safeguard its complete political independence from Soviet diplom-
acy and thereby also from the bureaucracy of ‘the Third Interna-
tional. ’ i ’ - ' — . " ‘

differ from thatof the proletariat in a country ﬁghting against the
;U.  S. R. But in the nature of practical .actions_ considerable
differences may arise depending on the concrete war _situation. For
instance, it would be absurd and criminal i__n..case of war between
the U-. S. S. R. and Japan for the American proletariat to sabotage
the .,_send_ing of American munition to the U. S. S. R. But the
p_ro1eta_riat of a country ﬁghting against_ the U. S. S. R. would be
absolutely obliged to resort to actions of this sort—s'trikes. sabo-

"  45. Wlntransigeant. proletarian opposition to the imperialist ally

of the U. S. S. R. must develop, on the one hand, on the basis of
international class policy, on the other, on the basis of the imper-
ialist aims of the given government, the treacherous character of
this ..“‘alliance"’, its speculation on capitalist overturn in the U. S.
S. R., etc. The policy of a proletarian party in an “allied” as well
as‘ in an enemy imperialist country should therefore be directed
towards the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the
seizure of power. Only in this way can a real alliance with the
C. 5. S. R. be created and the ﬁrst workers’ state be saved from
disaster.

46. Within the U. S. S. R. war against imperialist intervention
will unodnbtedly provoke a veritable outburst of genuine ﬁghting
enthusiasm. All the contradictions and antagonisms will seem
overcome or at any rate relegated to the background. The young
generations of workers and peasants that emerged from the revo-
lution will reveal on the ﬁeldof battle a collossal dynamic power.
Centralized industry, despite all its lacks and shortcomings, will
reveal great superiority in serving war needs, -The government of
the U. S. ,S_. ,R. has ‘undoubtedly created great _s-tores of food _sup—

U. S. S. R. with its bureaucratic planning. The gigantic new en-
terprises may in many cases prove to be just so much dead capital.
Under the inﬂuence of the government’s acute need of supplies of
ﬁrst necessity, the individualistic tendencies of peasant economy
will receive considerable strengthening, and the centrifugal forces
within the kolkhozes will grow with each month of war. The rule
of the uncontrolled bureaucracy will be transformed into a war
dictatorship. The absence of a living party as a political controller
and regulator will lead to an extreme accumulation and sharpening
of contradictions. In the heated atmosphere of war one can ex-
pect sharp turns toward individualistic principles in agriculture
and in handicraft industry, toward the attraction of foreign and
“allied” capital, breaks in the monopoly of foreign trade, the weak-
ening of governmental control over trusts, the sharpening of com-
petition between the trusts, their conﬂicts with workers, etc. In
the political sphere these processes may mean the completion of
Bonapartism with the corresponding change or a number of
changes in property relations. In other words, in case of a pro-
tracted war accompanied by the passivity of the world proletariat
the internal social contradictions in the U. S. S. R. not only might
lead but would have to lead to a bourgeois-Bonapartist counter-
revolution.

48. The political conclusions ﬂowing from this are obvious:

a) only the proletarian revolution in the VVest can save the
U. S. S. R. as the workers’ state in case of a long protracted war;

1)) the preparation for a proletarian revolution in “friendly”,
“allied” as well as enemy countries is conceivable only with the
complete independence of the world proletarian vanguard from the
Soviet bureaucracy.

c) the unconditional support of the U. S. S. R. against the
imperialist armies must go hand in hand with revolutionary Marx-
ian criticism of the war and the diplomatic policy of the Soviet
government, and with the formation inside of the U. S. S. R. of a
real revolutionary party of Bolshevik-Leninists.

THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL AND :WAR

49. Having abandoned a principled line on the war question,
the Third International vacillates between defeatism and social-
patriotism. In Germany the struggle against fascism was trans-
formed into a market competition on a nationalistic basis. The
slogan of “national liberation’’, advanced side by side with the
slogan. of “social liberation”, grossly distorts the revolutionary
perspective" and leaves‘ no place whatever for defea-tism. On the‘

32-

 

Saar question the Communist Party began by a cringing subserv-
ience to the ideology of national socialism and moved away from
this only through inner splits.

What slogan will the German section of the Third International
advance in time of war: “the defeat of Hitler is the lesser evil” P‘
But if the slogan of national liberation was correct under the
“fascists” Mueller and Bruening, how could it lose its eﬂicacy
under Hitler? Or are nationalist slogans good only for time of
peace and not of war? Truly, the epigones of Leninism did every-
thing to confuse themselves and the working class to the very end.

So. The impotent revolntionism of the Third International is
a direct result of its fatal policy. After the German catastrophe-
the political insigniﬁcance of the so-called Communist parties was
revealed in all countries where they were subjected to any test at
all. The French section which showed itself absolutely incapable
of rousing even a few tens of thousands of workers against the
colonial robbery in Africa, will undoubtedly prove even more its.
bankruptcy in the moment of so—called “national danger”.

51. The struggle against war, unthinkable without the revolu-
tionary mobilization of the wide working masses of the city and
village, demands at the same time direct inﬂuence on the army and"
navy, on the one hand, and on transport on the other. But it is-
impossible to inﬂuence soldiers without inﬂuencing the worker and
peasant youth. Inﬂuence in the sphere of transport presupposes a
strong foothold in the trade unions. Whereas meanwhile, with the
aid of the Proﬁntern, the Third International has lost all positions-
in the trade union movement and has cut itself off from all access
to the working youth. Under these conditions to talk of a struggle
against vvar is like blowing soap bubbles. There must be no room
for lll1.1Sl011SZ ".11 case of an imperialist attack on the U. S. S. R.
the Third International will show itself a complete zero.

“REVOLUTIONARY” PACIFISM AND WAR

52. As an independent current ,petty bourgeois _“left” paciﬁswn
starts from the premise that it is possible to insure peace by some-
particular, special means, outside of the class struggle of the prole-
tariat, outside of the socialist revolution. By articles and speeches
the paciﬁsts inculcate “aversion to war”, support the conscientious
objectors, preach boycott and the general strike (or rather the
myth of the general strike) against war. The more “revolutionary”
paciﬁsts are not averse even to talking at times of insurrection
against war. But all and severally they have no conception of the

33

:_i11dis.;‘S0l_ul)'le bond connecting the insurrection with the class strug-
gle and the policy of a revolutionary party. For them insurrection
is just a literary threat directed at the ruling class and not a matter
of long and persistent effort. ' "
Exploiting the masses’ natural love for peace and diverting it
from .its proper channels, the petty-bourgeois paciﬁsts turn -ﬁnally
into .unconscious supporters of imperialism. In case "of war the
overwhelming majority of the paciﬁst “allies” will be found in the
g-camp of___.the bourgeoisie and will use the authority with which --the
Third International has clothed them by its ballyhoo for the patri-
»otic disorienting of the proletarian vanguard. -

53. . The Amsterdam congress against war, as well as the Paris
congress against fascism, organized by the Third International are
-classic examples of the_-replacement of revolutionary class struggle
by the petty-bourgeois policy of ostentatious demonstrations, showy
parades, Potemkin villages. On the morrow of the blatant protests
against war in general, the heterogeneous’ elements artiﬁcially
:brought together by back-stage manipulation will scatter in all di-
rections and will not lift even a little ﬁnger against the particular
‘Will’.

54. The replacement of the united proletarian front, that is, of
the ﬁghting agreement of working class organizations, by a bloc
of the Communist bureaucracy and the petty-bourgeois paciﬁsts——
in which to one honest confusionist there are dozens of careerists

‘ -—leads to complete eclecticism in question of tactics. The Bar-

-busse-Muenzenberg congresses consider it their special merit that
they combine all types of “struggle” against war: humanitarian
protests, individual refusal to serve in the army, education of “pub-
lic opinion”, the general strike and even insurrection. Methods
which in life are in irreconcilable contradiction and which in prac-
tice can only be in conﬂict with each other, are presented as ele-
ments of an harmonious whole. The Russian “social-revolution-
.aries” who preached a “synthetic tactic” in the struggle against
,Czaris|m—-alliance with liberals, individual terror and_ mass strug-
,gle,—-we_re an earnest lot compared with the inspirers of the Am-
-sterdam bloc. But the workers mustiremerwnber that Bolshevism
was reared _in the struggle against Populist e__cl_ecticism!

Generally speaking, only in this way can war be prevented by in-
surrection. But even much less than workers will; peasants let.
themselves be drawn to the revolutionary road by abstractions,
ready-made patterns and bare command‘. The epigones of Lenin-
ism who brought about an overturn in the Comintern in the years-
I923-24 under the slogan “face to the peasantry” revealed a com--
plete ‘inability to attract to the banner of communism not only
peasants but even agricultural workers. The Krestintern (Peas--
ants’ International) expired quietly without even a funeral oration.
The “conquest” of the peasantry of different countries, proclaimecfi
so boastfully, proved in every case ephemeral, if not simply fanci--
ful. Precisely in the sphere of peasant policy the bankruptcy of '
the Third International acquired an especially graphic character,

although it really came as an inevitable consequence of the break.

between the Comintern and the proletariat.
The peasantry will take the road of revolutionary struggle

-against war only upon convincing itself in practice of the ability of

the workers to lead this struggle. The key to victory rests, there.--
fore, in the shops and factories. The revolutionary proletariat
must become a real force before the peasantry and the small city
folk will close ranks with it.

56. The petty bourgeoisie of the city and village is not homo-»
geneous. The proletariat can attract to its side only its lowest
stratas the poorest peasants, semi-proletarians, lower civil servants,.
peddlers, the oppressed and scattered folk who are deprived by all
the conditions of their existence of the possibility of carrying on
an independent struggle. Over this wide layer of the petty bour-
geoisie there raise themselves up their tops, gravitating to the
middle and big blourgeoisierand developing political careerists of
democratic and paciﬁst, or of fascist type. While they remain in-
opposition these‘ gentlemen resort to most unbridled demagogy as-.
the surest means of later boosting their price in the eyes of the
big bourgeoisie.

The crime of the Third International consists in substituting
for the struggle for revolutionary inﬂuence on the real petty bour-
geoisie, that is, on its plebian masses, theatrical blocs with its false»
paciﬁst leaders. Instead of discrediting the latter, it strengthens.
them by the prestige of the October revolution and makes the op-
pressedvlower strata of the petty bourgeoisie political victims of"
the treacherous tops. '

57. The revolutionary road to the peasantry lies through the-
working class. To gain the conﬁdence of the village it is necessary

that the advanced workers themselves regain conﬁdence" in the
banner of the proletarian revolution. This can be achieved only
by a correct policy in general, by a correct anti-war policy in par-
ticular. '

“DEFEAT1sM” AND IMPERIALIST lWAR

58. In those cases where it is a question of conﬂict between
capitalist countries, the proletariat of any one of them refuses
categorically to sacriﬁce its historic interests, which in the ﬁnal
analysis coincide with the interests of the nation and human-ity for
the sake of the military victory of the bourgeoisie. Lenin’s formu-
la: “defeat is the lesser evil” means not that defeat of one’s own
country is the lesser evil as compared with the defeat of the enemy
-country; but that a military defeat resulting from the growth of
the revolutionary movement is inﬁnitely more beneﬁcial". to the
proletariat and to the whole people than military victory assured
by “civil peace”. Karl Liebknecht gave an unsurpassed formula
of proletarian policy in time of war: “The chief enemy o,f,the
people is in its own country”. The victorious proletarian revolu-
tion will not only rectify the evils caused by defeat but will also
create the ﬁnal guarantee against future wars and defeats. This
dialectic attitude toward war is the most important element of rev-
olutionary training and therefore also of the sruggle against war.

59 The transformation of imperialist war into civil war is
that general strategic task to which the whole work of a proletarian
party during war should be subordinated. The consequences of

the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 as well as of the imperialist’

slaughter of 1914-18 (Paris Commune, the February and October
revolutions in Russia, revolutions in Germany and Austria-Hun-
hgary, insurrections in a number of warring countries) testify irre-
futably that a modern war between capitalist nations carries with
it a war of classes within each of the nations, and that the task
of a revolutionary party consists in preparing in this latter war
the victory of the proletariat.

60. The experience of the years 1914-18 demonstrates at the
same time that the slogan of peace is in no wise contradictory to
"the strategic formula of “defeatism”, on the contrary, it develops
a tremendous revolutionary force, especially in case of a protracted
war. The slogan of peace has a paciﬁst, that is lying, stupefying,
enfeebling character only when democratid and other politicians
juggle with it; when priests offer up prayers for the speediest
-cessation of the slaughter; when “lovers of humanity”, .among

.26

 

 ' ..a...m._—...«....M -.

them also social-patriots, tearfully urge the governments to make
peacequickly on “the basis of justice”. But the slogan of peace
has nothing in common with paciﬁsm when it emanates from
working class quarters and trenches, intertwining itself with the
slogan of fraternization of the soldiers of the hostile armies and
uniting the oppressed against the oppressors. The revolutionary
struggle for peace which takes on ever wider and bolder forms is
the surest means of “turning the imperialist war into a civil war”.

WAR, FAsc1sM AND THE ARMING or THE PROLETARIAT

61. War demands “civil peace”. Under the present conditions
the bourgeoisie can achieve it only by means of fascism. Thus
fascism has become the main political factor of war. The struggle
against war presupposes the struggle against fascism. All sorts
of ‘revolutionary programs of struggle against war (“defeatism”,
“transformation of imperialist war into civil war”, etc.) turn into
empty sound, if the proletarian vanguard ﬁnds itself incapable of"
Victoriously repelling fascism.

To demand of the bourgeois state the disarming of fascist
bands, as the Stalinists do, is to take the road of the German
social—democracy and Austro-Marxism. Precisely Wels and Otto-
Bauer “demanded” of the state that it disarm the Nazis and assure-
internal peace. “Democratic” government can, it is true——whenx
it is to its advantage,-‘—disarm individual fascist groups but only
in order with all the greater ferocity to disarm the workers and
prevent them from arming themselves. The very next day the
bourgeois state will accord the fascists, only yesterday “disarmed”,
thepossibility of arming themselves doubly and of bringing down
with twofold strength their weapons on the unarmed proletariat-
To turn to the state, that is to capital, with the demand to disarm
the fascists means to sow the worst democratic illusions, to"lull the
vigilance of the proletariat, to demoralize its will.

62. Proceeding from the fact of the arming of fascist bands,
correct revolutionary policy consists in creating armed workers’
detachments for the purposes of self-defense, and in tirelessly
calling the workers to arm themselves. Here is the centre of
gravity" of the whole present political situation. The social demo-
crats, even the most left ones, that is, those who a.re ready to
repeat general phrases of revolution and the dictatorship of the
proletariat, carefully avoid the question of arming the workers, or
openly declare this task “chimerical”, adventurous, “romantic”,
etc. They propose instead ( !) of arming the workers propaganda

27

 

-among soldiers which -they do not carry on in reality and which
they are incapable of carrying on. Bare reference to work in the
army is needed by the opportunists only in order to bury the ques-
.tion of the arming of the workers. 

63. The struggle for the army is incontestably the greatest
part of the struggle for power. Persistent and self—sacriﬁcing
work among the soldiers is the revolutionary duty of every truly-
gproletarian party. This work can be carried on with the assurance
«of success under the condition of the correctness of the general
policy of the party in particular and especially among the youth.
"The agrarian program of the party and in general the system of
transitional demands, touching the basic interests of the petty-bour-
_-geois masses and opening up before them a perspective of salva-
:tion, has a tremendous importance for the success of the work in
the army in the countries with a considerable peasant population.

64. It would be puerile, however, to believe that by propaganda
;alone the whole army can be won over to the side of the proletariat
and thus in general make revolution unnecessary. The army is
heterogeneous and its heterogeneous elements are chained by the
iron hoops of discipline. Propaganda can create revolutionary
»cells in the army and prepare‘ a sympathetic attitude among the
zmost progressive soldiers. More than this propaganda and agita-
tion cannot do. To depend upon the army defending the workers’
organizations from fascism by its own initiative and even guar-
anteeing the transfer of powerinto the hands of the proletariat, is

‘to substitute sugary illusions for the harsh lessons of history. The

:army in its decisive section can go over to the side of the prole-
tariat in the epoch of revolution only in the event that the prole-
rtariat itself will have revealed to the army in action a readiness
randability to ﬁght for power to the last drop of blood. Such
-struggle necessarily presupposes the arming of the proletariat.

65. The task of the bourgeoisie consists in preventing the
proletariat from winning over the army. Fascism solves this task
znot without success by means of armed detachments. The immedi-
ate, urgenf, present-day task of the proletariat consists not in seiz-
ing power but in the defense of its organizations from fascist
‘bands, at a certain distance behind which stands the capitalist
‘state. Whoever asserts that the workers have no possibility of
;arming themselves, proclaims by that that the workers are defense-
‘less before fascism. Then there is no need to speak of socialism,
~of proletarian revolution, of struggle against war. Then the com-

munist program should be scrapped and a cross marked over

Marxism.

V 66. .Not a revolutionary but an impotent paciﬁst, tomorrow’s«
capitulator to fascism and to war can pass up the task of arming‘
the workers. In itself the task of arming is entirely solvable, as
history testiﬁes. If the workers will really ‘understand that it is" a
question of life and death they will obtain weapons. To explain
to them the political situation, hiding or minimizing nothing, and!
chasing out every .consolatory lie, is the vﬁrst duty of a revolution-
ary party. Indeed, how can one defend himself against the mortak
enemy if not by having two knives for every fascist knife and two
revolvers for every revolver? There is and there can be no other
answer. ~

67. Where should the weapons be gotten? First of all from.
the fascists. The disarming of fascists is a shameful slogan when
it is addressed to the bourgeois police. The disarmingof fascists
is an excellent slogan when it is addressed to revo1utionaryework-
ers. But fascist arsenals are not the only source. Thesplrciletariat.
has hundreds and thousands of channels for self-defense. We must
not forget that it is precisely the workers and only they who’ with:
theirivown hands, make all sorts of weapons. It is only necessary
for the proletarian vanguard to understand clearly that we cannot
evade,t__l;ed task of self-defense. A revolutionary party must take
upon’ itself the initiative _in arming ﬁghting workers’ detachments..
And for this it must first of all cleanse itself of all sorts of scepti-
cism, indecision and paciﬁst reasoning in the question of arming"
the workers. .

68. The slogan of a workers’ militia, or of detachments of self—~
defense has a revolutionary meaning insofar as it is a question of
an armed militia, otherwise the militia is reduced to a theatrical‘
display, to _a parade, and consequently to self-delusion. Of course,

the arming will be primitive at the beginning. The ﬁrst workers"

detachments will have neither howitzers, nor tanks, nor aeroplanes.
But on the 6thlof February, in Paris, in the centre of a powerful?
militarist country, bands armed with revolvers and razors on‘
sticks were not far from taking the Bourbon palace and brought
about the fall of the government. - Tomorrow similar bands can»
sack the ofﬁces of proletarian newspapers or trade union head—-
quarters. The strengthlof the proletariat lies in its numbers. Even<~
the most primitive weapon in the hands of the masses can perform»
miracles. Under favorable conditions it may open a_ road to more
perfected weapons. '

69. The slogan of a united frontldegenerates into a centrist
phrase, if it is not supplemented under the present conditions by"

[Q/l

Introduction

These theses are appearing just at the time when the war danger
is coming to a head in Europe in ever more threatening form. The
disarmament conference has become the battle ground for the con-
clusion of new military alliances. Mussolini and General Weygand:
are appealing for an increase in armaments. Yesterday Austria.-
was the crucible for the new world carnage, today it is the Saar-
and Manchuria. In the whole world nothing is so much the topic.-
of conversation as air mobilization, the reinforcement of the air
and sea ﬂeets, chemical warfare, industrial mobilization, etc.

The war danger imposes upon us tremendous duties and re-
sponsibilities. First of all the duty of preparing and organizing the
ideological struggle against war, a duty which is all the greater for
the fact that both the Second and Third Internationals are today‘
only obstacles in the struggle against war.

The patriotic leaders of the Second International are again-
preparing, as in 1914, as faithful servants of Imperialism to pro-
vide the cannon fodder for the coming war.

The leaders of the impotent Third International are misleading
the masses, inasmuch as they are replacing mobilization against
war by clamorous masquerade congresses.

The struggle against war must be conducted in spite of the two
Internationals and against them. This struggle must be given a new
basis, a new banner—the banner of the Fourth International. Be the
cadres of the Fourth International ever so few in number, the cor-
rectness and clarity of their policy and determination will enable
them to play a decisive role. Remember Karl Liebknecht and Rosa.
Luxemburg!

The question of the imperialist war and the preparation for it
is the central question of the day. The struggle against the imper-
ialist war is the focal point of the process of differentiation in the
working class. Thecharacter of the Reformist and Centrist organ-
izations will be exposed in this struggle; the cadres of the Bolshe-
vik-Leninists, however, will be steeled in it.

Only those comrades who seriously and critically study these
theses will be adequately armed for political work against the war.
Yet study, discussion, criticism of the theses, useful as they are, do

not suffice. It is the struggle that will decide! In the everyday class "

struggle we must ﬁght in the spirit of the theses, in the spirit of the
unswerving, revolutionary internationalism, in the spirit of Lenin.
These theses have already been published as a draft in January
1.934 in our periodical “Problemes et Discussions” in the French
language after making a number of additions and improvements.
In this spirit we present the theses to the proletarian public. ,

propaganda and practical application of deﬁnite methods of strug-
gle against fascism. The united front is needed ﬁrst of all for the
creation of local committees of defense. The committees of de-
fense are needed for the building and uniting of detachments of

.. workers’ militia. These detachments must at the very start look

for and ﬁnd weapons. Detachments for self-defense—-are only a
stage in the matter of arming the proletariat. In general revolu-
tion knows no other roads.

REVOLUTIONARY POLICY AGAINST WAR

70. The ﬁrst prerequisite for success is the training of party
cadres in the correct understanding of all the conditions of im-
perialist war and of all the political processes that accompany it.
rWoe to that party which conﬁnes itself in this burning question to
general phrases and abstract slogans! The bloody events will crash
-over its head and smash it.

It is necessary to ‘set up special circles for the study of the
political experiences of the war of 1914-18 (ideological prepara-
tions for war by the imperialists, misleading of public opinion by
military headquarters through the patriotic press, the role of the
anti-thesis defense-attack; groupings in the proletarian camp, the
isolation of the Marxist elements, etc. etc.)

71. For a revoluionary party the moment of declaration of
-war’ is especially critical. The bourgeois and social-patriotic press
in an alliance with the radio and movies will pour out upon the
toiling masses torrents of chauvinistic poison. Even the most revo-
lutionary and tempered party cannot as a whole resist this. The
present thoroughly falsiﬁed history of the Bolshevik parties does
not serve in the realistic preparation of the advanced workers for
the test, but lulls them into passive impotence by an invented ideal
form.

Despite the fact that Czarist Russia could by no stretch of
imagination have been considered either as a democracy or as the
‘bearer of culture, nor ﬁnally, as belonging to the defensive side,
the Bolshevik fraction of the Duma together with the Menshevik
fraction issued at the beginning a social-patriotic declaration di-
luted with pink paciﬁst internationalism. The Bolshevik fraction
-soon took a more revolutionary position but at the trial of the
fraction all theaccused deputies and their theoretic guide Kanienev,
with the exception of Muranov, categorically differentiated "them-
selves from the defeatist theory of Lenin. The illegal work of the
party almost died down at the beginning. Only gradually did the

30

.,.,.',... .,,. ——ee—.-.—~..-_‘_._,q. _ ;,~.~x ....-—- ~

 

zrevolutionar-y leaﬂets begin to appear which rallied the workers
;under. the banner of internationalism, without, however, advancing
ldefeatist slogans. .

The ﬁrst two years of the war greatly undermined the patriot-
ism of the masses and moved the party to the left. But the Febru-
.ary revolution, having transformed Russia into a “democracy”,
gave rise to a new powerful wave of “revolutionary” patriotism.
The overwhelming majority of the leaders of the Bolshevik party
«did not withstand it even then. In March 1917 Stalin and Kamenev
imparted to the central party organ a social-patriotic direction. On
this basis a rapproachment and in the majority of cities even a
-direct fusion of Bolshevik and Menshevik organizations occured,
Protests by the ﬁrmest revolutionists, chieﬂy in the advanced dis-
tricts of Petrograd, were needed; the arrival of Lenin in Russia
and his irreconcilable struggle against social-patriotism were needed
‘to straighten out the party’s internationalist front. Such was the
-case with the best, most revolutionary and tempered party.

72. The study of the historic experience of Bolshevism has an
invaluable educational importance for the advanced workers: it
:Sl‘l0WS them the terriﬁc force of the pressure of bourgeois public
'-opinion that they will have to withstand and teaches them at the
same time not to despair, not to sheath weapons, not to lose cour-
.age despite complete isolation at the beginning of war.

It is necessary to study no less carefully the political alignments
within the proletariat of other countries, both those that partici-
pated in the war and those that remained neutral, Of special
rsigniﬁcance is the experience of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Lieb-
Sknecht in Germany where events took a different course than in
Russia but in the ﬁnal analysis led to the same conclusion: that
.1't is necessary to learn to swim against the current.

73. It is necessary to follow closely the patriotic preparation
of cannon fodder now proceeding: the diplomatic fencing which
"has as its aim the laying of responsibility on the other side; the
"treacherous formulas of open and hidden social-patriots preparing
for themselves a bridge from paciﬁsm to militarism; the hollow
~slogans of the “Communist” leaders who will be just as bewildered
on the ﬁrst day of war as the German “leaders” on the night of
‘the Reichstag ﬁre. V

74. It is necessary to gather carefully the most characteristic

g-clippings from official government and opposition articles and

.-_speeches,v.co,mparing them with the experience of the previous war;
zto foretell what direction the further work of fooling the people

312

 

will take; to ‘strengthen these predictions later by the. array of
facts; to teach theiproletarian vanguard -to orient itself indepeiia
dently in events so as not to be taken unawares. ' V ’ -

75. Reinforced agitation against imperialism and militarism
rnust proceed not from abstract formulas but from concrete’ facts
which strike the masses. It is necessary painstakingly to expose
not only the open military budget, but also all’ the masked forms‘
of militarism, not ‘leaving without a protest. war maneuvres, mili-

I

tary furnishings, orders, etc.

Through well—trai'ned workers it is neeessary to raise the ques-

cracy as. well as_ the. bureaucratic deterioration of. the Third In-
ternational have delivered the hardest blow to the most oppressed
and disfranchised strata of .the proletariat; that is, ﬁrst of all to

' theworking women. To awaken them, gain their conﬁdence, show

them the true road, means to mobilize against imperialism the
revolutionary passions of the most downtrodden part of humanity.
Anti-militarist work among women must in particular safe-

’ guard the replacement of mobilized men by revolutionary working

womento whom, in case of war, a great part of party and trade-
union work must inevitably pass.

79. If the proletariat should ﬁnd it beyond its power to pre-
vent war by means of revolution,—and this is the only means of
preventing war,——the workers, together with the whole people will
be forced to participate in the army and in war. Individualistic
-and anarchistic slogans of refusal to undergo military service,
passive resistance, desertion, sabotage are in basic contradiction to
the methods of the proletarian revolution. But just as in the fac-
tory the advanced worker feels himself a slave of capital, prepar-
ing for his liberation, so in the capitalist army too he feels himself
a slave of imperialism. Compelled today to give his muscles and
even his life, he does not surrender his revolutionary consciousness.
He remains a ﬁghter, learns how to use arms, explains even in the
trenches the class meaning of war, groups around himself the

discontented, connects them into cells, transmits the ideas and

slogans of the party, watches closely the changes in the mood of
the masses, the subsidence of the patriotic wave, the growth of
indignation, and summons the soldiers to the aid of the workers at
the critical moment.

THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL AND‘ WAR

80. The struggle against war presupposes a revolutionary in-
strument of struggle, that is, a party. There is none now either on
a national or on an international scale. A revolutionary party
‘must be built on the basis of the entire experience of the past,
including the experiences of the Second and Third Internationals.
The renunciation of open and direct struggle for the new Interna-
tional means conscious or unconscious support of thetwo existing
Internationals, of which one will actively support the war, the
other being capable only of disorganizing and weakening the pro-
letarian vanguard. - I

81. It is true, not a few honest revolutionary workers remain

33

 

in the ranks of the so-called Communist parties. The persistency’
with which they hold on to the Third International is in many
cases to be explained by misdirected revolutionary devotion. They
can be attracted to the banner of the new International not by
concessions, not by adaptation to prejudices inculcated in them but,
on the contrary, by a systematic unmasking of the fatal interna-
tional role of Stalinism (bureaucratic centrism). Thereby the
questions of war must be posed with particular clarity and in-
transigeance.

82. At the same time it is necessary to follow attentively the
inner struggle in thejreformist camp and attract in time the left.
socialist groupings developing towards revolution to a struggle
against war. The best criterion of the tendencies of a given
organization is its attitude in practice, in action, toward national
defense and toward colonies, especially in those cases in which the-
bourgeoisie of a given country owns colonial slaves. Only a
complete and real break with official public opinion on the most
burning question of the “defense of the fatherland” signiﬁes a turn,
or at least the beginning of a turn from bourgeois positions to-
proletarian positions. The approach to left organiations of this
type should be accompanied by friendly criticism of all indecision
in their policy and by a joint elaboration of all theoretical and‘
practical questions of war.

83. There are not a few politicians in the working class move-
ment who recognize, at least in words, the failure of the Second
and Third Internationals but consider at the same time that “this”
is not the time" to start building a new International. Such a
position is characteristic not of a revolutionary Marxist but of a
disillusioned Stalinist or disappointed reformist. The revolutionary
struggle does not suffer interruption. The conditions for it may
not be favorable today; but a revolutionary who cannot swim:
against the current is not a revolutionary. To say that the build-
ing of the new International is “untimely” is the same as to de-
clare that the class struggle, and in particular the struggle against
war, is untimely. In the present epoch proletarian policy cannot
but place before itself international tasks. International tasks.
cannot but demand the welding together of international cadres.
This work cannot be deferred even for one day without capitula—
tion to imperialism.

84. Of course, no one can predict just when the war will break
out and at what stage it will ﬁnd the building of new parties and‘
ofithe Fourth International- We must do everything possible to

make the preparation for the proletarian revolution move faster’

than the preparation for a new war. It is very possible, however,
that this time also imperialism will overtake the revolution. But
even this road, portending great sacriﬁces and calamities, in no
case relieves us of the duty of building the new International im--
mediately. The transformation of the imperialist war into prole-
tarian revolution will proceed all the faster the further advanced
our preparatory work will be, the ﬁrmer the revolutionary cadres
at the very beginning of war, the more systematically they carry
on work in all warring countries and the more ﬁrmly their‘ work
is based on correct strategic tactical and organizational principles.

85. At its ﬁrst blow the ‘imperialist war will smash the de-
crepit spine of the Second International and will split its national
sections into bits. It will reveal to the bottom the hollowness and
impotence of the Third International. But then neither will it
spare all thoselindecisive centrist groupings which evade the prob-
lem of the International, which seek purely national roots, do not
carry any one question to its conclusion, are devoid of perspective
and temporarily feed on the ferment and confusion of the working
class.

Even if at the beginning of a new war the true revolutionists
should again ﬁnd themselves in a small minority, we cannot doubt
for a single moment that this time the shift of the masses_to the
road of revolution will occur much faster, more decisively and
relentlessly than during the ﬁrst imperialist war. A newtwave
of insurrections can and must become victorious in the whole
capitalist world. I .

It is indisputable at any rate that in our epoch only that organ-
ization which bases itself on international principles and enters into
the ranks of the world party of the proletariat can root itself in
the national soil. The struggle against war means now the struggle
for the Fourth International! »

War and  4tl1ilngternatio.narl

 The catastrophic commercial, industrial, agrarian and ﬁnancial

‘ crisis, the break in international economic ties, the decline of the

productive forces of humanity, the unbearable sharpening of class
and international contradictions mark the twilight. of capitalism
and fully conﬁrm the Leninist characterization of our epoch as
one of war and revolutions.

_ The war of 1914-1918 officially ushered in a new epoch. Its
most important political events up to now have been: the conquest
of power by the Russian proletariat in 1917 and the smashing of
the German proletariat in the year 1933. The terrible calamities
of the peoples in all parts of the world and even the more terrible
dangers which tomorrow holds in store result from the fact that
the revolution of 1917 did not ﬁnd victorious development on the
European and world arena.

Inside the individual countries the historic blind alley of _capi-
talism expresses itself in chronic unemployment, in the lowering
of the living standards of the workers, in the ruination of the
peasantry and the town petty bourgeoisie, in the decomposition and

decay of the parliamentary state, in the monstrous poisoning

of the people by “social” and “national” clemagogy in face of
an actual liquidation of social reforms, of the pushing aside and
replacement of old ruling parties by a naked military-police appa-
ratus (Bonapartism, of capitalist decline), in the growth of
fascism, in its conquering power and smashing of each and every
proletarian organization.

On the world arena the same processes are washing away the
last remnants of stability in international relations," driving every
conﬂict between the states to the very edge of the knife, laying
bare the futility of paciﬁst attempts, giving rise to the growth of
armaments on a new and higher technical basis and thus leading to
a new imperialist war. Fascism is its most consistent artiﬁcer and
organizer. .

On the other hand, the exposure of the thoroughly reactionary,

putriﬁed and robber nature of modern capitalism, the destruction

‘of democracy, reformism and paciﬁsm, the urgent and burning
"need of the proletariat to ﬁnd a safe path away from imminent

disaster put the international revolution on the order of the day
with renewed force. Only the overthrow of the bourgeoisie by the

4

insu'rgen"tproletariat can save humanity from a new devastating
slaughter of the peoples. L

PREPARATION FOR A NEW WAR

i. ..'l'he same causes, inseparable from modern capitalism,
which brought about the last imperialist war have now reached’
inﬁnitely greater tension than in the middle of I914. The fear of
the consequences of a new war is the only factor which fetters the
will of ¢'i_mperialism.u But the eﬂicacy of this brake is limited. The
stress of inner "contradictions pushes one country after another on
the road to fascism which, in its turn, cannot maintain power
except; by preparing international explosions. All governments
fear" war. But none of the governments has any freedom of choice.
Withotit a proletarian revolution‘ a new world war is inevitable.

2. Europe, the recent arena of the greatest of wars continually
heads ‘toward decline, pushed by victors and vanquished alike. The
League of Nations which according to its official program was to
be the “organizer of peace” and which was really intended to per-
petuate the Versailles system, to neutralize the hegemony of the
United States and to create a bulwark against the Red East, could
notiwithstand the impact of imperialist contradictions. Only the
mostncynical of the social-patriots (Henderson, Vandervelde, Jou-
haux and others) still try to connect the perspectives of disarma-
ment and paciﬁsm with the League. In reality the League of
Nations became a secondary ﬁgure on the chessboard of imperial-
ist combinations. The main work of diplomacy, now carried on
behind the back of Geneva, consists in the search for military
allies, that is, in a feverish preparation for a new slaughter.
Parallel with it goes the constant growth of armaments to which
fascist Germany has lent a new and gigantic impulsion. ’

3'. The collapse of the League of Nations is indissolubly bound "
up with the beginning of the collapse of French hegemony on the"

European continent. The demographic and economic power of
France proved to be, as was to be expected, too narrow a base for
the Versailles system. French imperialism armed to the teeth and
having‘ an apparently “defensive” character,’ insofar as it is forced

to defend by" legalized agreements the fruits of its plunder ‘and
spo-1iiation,i remains essentially one of the mostlimportant factors

of a new war.
‘Driven by its unbearable contradictions and the consequences

of defeat, German capitalism has been forced to tear off the"'strait—'
jacket of democratic paciﬁsm and now comes forward as the‘ chief ‘

5

 

threat to the Versailles system. State combinations on the-:Euro--
pean continent still follow in the main the line of victors and van-
quished. Italy occupies the place of a treacherous go-between,
ready to sell its friendship at the ecisive moment to the stronger
side, as she did during the last war. England is attempting to re-

stain its “independence”,—a mere shadow of its former “splendid.

isolation”,——in the hope of utilizing the antagonisms in Europe, the
«contradictions between Europe and America, the approaching con-
ﬂicts in the Far East. But ruling England is ever less successful in
its scheming designs. Terriﬁed by the disintegration of its empire,
by the revolutionary movement in India, by the instability of its
-positions in China, the British bourgeoisie covers up with the-
revolting hypocrisy of MacDonald and Henderson itsigreedyand
cowardly policy of waiting and maneuvring which, in turn, is one
-of the main sources of today’s general instability and tomorrow's
-catastrophies.

4. The war and the post—war period wrought the greatest
-changes in the internal and international position of the U. S. A.
"The gigantic economic superiority of the U.S.A. over Europe and
consequently over the world, allowed the bourgeoisie of the United
States to appear in the ﬁrst post-war period as a dispassionate
“conciliator”, defender of the “freedom of the seas” and the “open
door”. The industrial and business crisis revealed, however, with
terriﬁc force the disturbance of the old economic equilibrium
which had found suﬂicient support on the internal market. This
road is completely exhausted.

Of course, the economic superiority of the U. S. A._ has not
disappeared, on the contrary, it has even grown potentially due to
the further disintegration of Europe. But the old forms in which
this superiority manifested itself (industrial technique, trade bal-
ance, stable dollar, European indebtedness) have lost their actual-
ity: the advanced technique is no longer put to use, the trade
balance is unfavorable, the dollar is in decline, debts are not paid.
‘The superiority of the U. S. A. must ﬁnd its expression in new
:forms, the way to which can be opened only by war.

The slogan of the -“open door” in China is proving powerless
before a few Japanese divisions. Washington carries on its Far
Eastern policy in such a way as to be able to provoke at the most
jpropitious moment a military clash between the U. S. S. R. and
japan, so as to weaken both Japan and the U. S. S. R. and outline
its further strategic plan depending upon the outcome of war.
Continuing by inertia the discussion: on the liberation _of_.—the

6

 

 

Phillipines, the American imperialists are in reality preparing to
establish for themselves a territorial base in China, so as to raise
at the ‘following stage, in case of conflict with Great Britain, the
question of the “liberation” of India. U. S. capitalism is up
against the same problems that pushed Germany of I914 on the
path of war. The world is divided? It must be re—divided. For
Germany it was a question of “organizing Europe”. The United
States must “organize” the world. History is bringing humanity
face to face with the volcanic eruption of American imperialism.

5. Belated Japanese capitalism, feeding on the juices of back-
wardness, poverty and barbarism, is being driven by unbearable
internal ulcers and abscesses on the road of unceasing piratical
plunder. The absence of an industrial base of its _own and the
extreme precariousness of the whole social system makes Japanese
capitalism the most aggressive and unbridled. However, the future
will show that behind this greedy aggressiveness there are but few
real forces. Japan may be the ﬁrst to give the signal to war; but
from semi-feudal Japan, torn by all the contradictions that beset
Czarist Russia, sooner than from other countries, the call to revo-
lution may sound.

6. It would be too venturesome, however, to predict precisely
where and when the ﬁrst shot will be ﬁred. Under the inﬂuence
of the Soviet-American agreement, as well as of internal diﬂicu1-
ties, Japan may temporarily retr-eat. But the same circumstances
may, on the contrary, force the Japanese military camarilla to
hasten the blow while there is yet time. Will the French govern-
ment make up its mind to a “preventive” war and will this war
not turn, with the aid of Italy, into a free-for-all? Or on the
contrary, while waiting and maneuvring, will not France under
the pressure of England take the road of agreement with Hitler,
thereby opening up to him the road of attack to the East?

Will not the Balkan peninsula be once more the instigator of
war? Or will the initiative, perhaps, be seized this time by Danub-
ian countries? The multitude of factors and the intertwining of
conflicting forces exclude the possibility of a concrete prognosis.

But the ghneral tendency of development is absolutely. clear: the"

post-war period has simply been transformed into an interval
between two wars and this interval is vanishing before our very
eyes. Planned, corporative or state capitalism which goes hand in

hand with the Authoritarian, Bonapartist or Fascist state, remains‘

a utopia and a lie insofar as it sets itself the official task of a
harmonious national economy on the basis of private property.

7

 

But it is a menacing reality insofar as it is a question of concen-
-trating all the economic forces of the nation for the preparation
of a new war. This work is proceeding now with full steam. A
new great war is knocking at the gates. It will be crueler, more
destructive than its predecessor. This very fact makes the attitude
towards the oncoming war the pivotal question of proletarian
policy.
U. S. S. R. AND IMPERIALIST WAR

7. Taken on a historic scale the antagonism between world
imperialism and the Soviet Union is inﬁnitely deeper than the
antagonisms which set individual capitalist countries in opposition
to each other. But the class contradiction between the workers’
state and the capitalist states varies in acuteness depending upon
the evolution of the workers’ state and upon the changes in the
world situation. The monstrous’ development of Soviet bureau-
cratism and the difficult conditions of existence of the toiling
masses have drastically decreased the attractive power of the
U. S. S. R. with regard to the working class’ of the world. The
heavy defeats of the Comintern and the national-paciﬁst foreign
policy of the Soviet government in their turn could not but dimin-
ish the apprehensions of the world bourgeoisie. Finally, the new
sharpening of internal contradictions of the capitalist world
forces the governments of Europe and America to approach the
U. S. S. R. at this stage not from the point of view of the princi-
pal question: capitalism or socialism, but from the point of view
of the conjunctural role of the Soviet state in the struggle of the
imperialist powers. Non-aggression pacts, the recognition of the
U. S. S. R. by the Washington government, etc., are manifestations
of this international situation. Hitler’s persistent efforts to legal-
ize the re-arming of Germany by pointing to the “Eastern danger”
ﬁnd no response as yet, especially on the part of France and its
satellites, precisely because the revolutionary danger of commun-
ism, despite the terrible crisis, has lost its acuteness. The diplo-
matic successes of the Soviet Union are therefore to be attributed,
at least in a large measure, to the extreme weakening of the inter-
national revolution. _ ‘

8. It would be a fatal mistake, however, to consider the armed
intervention against the Soviet ,Union as entirely off the order of
the! day. If the conjunctural -relations have become less sharp,
there remain in full force the contradictions of social systems.
The continual decline of capitalism will drive the bourgeois gov-.
ernments to radical decisions. Every big war, irrespective of its

initial "motives, must pose squarely the questionfof military inter.-
vention against the U. S. S. R. in order to transfuse fresh blood
into the sclerotic veins of ‘capitalism.

The indubitable and deep—going bureaucratic degeneration of
the Soviet state as well as the national-conservative character of
its foreign policy do not change the social nature of the Soviet

Union as that of the ﬁrst workers’ state. All kinds of democratic, —

idealistic, ultra-left, anarehistic theories, ignoring the character of
Soviet property relations which is soc_ialistic in its tendencies and
denying or glossing over the class contradiction between the U. S.
S. R. and the bourgeois state must lead inevitably, and especially
in case of war, to counter—revolutionary political conclusions.

Defense of the Soviet Union from the blows of the capitalist
enemies, irrespective of the circumstances and immediate causes of
the conﬂict, is the elementary and imperative duty of every honest
labor organization.

"NATIONAL DEFENSE”

9. The national state created by capitalism in the struggle
with the sectionalismt of the Middle Ages became the classical
arena of capitalism. But no sooner did it take shape than it be-
came a brake upon economic and cultural development. The con-

tradiction between the productive forces and the framework of '

the national state, in conjunction with the principal contradiction
—between the productive forces and the private ownership of the
means of production—make the crisis of capitalism that of the
world social system.

I0. If state borders could be swept away with one stroke, pro—
ductive forces, even under capitalism, could continue to rise for a
certain length of time—at the price of innumerable sacriﬁces, it is
true—to a higher level. With the abolition of private ownership
of the means of production, the productive forces may, as the
experience of the -U. S. S. R. shows, reach a higher development
even withinthe framework of one state. But only the abolition of
private property as well as of state barriers between nations can
create the conditions for a new economic system: the socialist
society.

II. The defense of the national state, ﬁrst of all in Balkanized
Europe;-the cradle of the national state—is in the full sense of the
word a reactionary task. The national state with its borders, pass-
ports, monetary system, customs and the army for the protection
of customs has become a frightful impediment to the economic and
