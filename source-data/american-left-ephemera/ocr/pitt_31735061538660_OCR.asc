In short, the California migratory farm worker has a lot as miser-
able as that of any worker in the country. And all this in ;the midst
of the most bounteous nature!

TI-IE STRUGGLE‘

A SLAVE rebels. Before the world war, the Industrial Workers of
the World (I.W.W.) successfully organized the Valley work-
ers, but a few years later, a mighty union—busting drive crippled the
movement.

Then, in the fall off 1932, the Cannery and Agricultural Work-
ers Industrial Union took up the struggle. Norman Mini, now
Prisoner 57606 in San Quentin for the crime of helping to organize
this union, tells its history:

“As each crop came along . . . small strikes took place. . . . In August,
just as the peach picking was reaching its height, the pickers on the
Tagus ranch, a large corporation farm near Tulare, walked out. . . .
Then the movement began to spread; soon the whole region was out . . .
the union won its demands completely. The news of the workers" ﬁrst big
victory spread north with amazing speed. Wherever peaches were being
picked, workers walked out. . . . Without organization, without any
preparation, the workers struck. And in every case they won. . . .

“The union became a state-wide organization: its membership grew
from a few doubtful hundreds in January to around 3,000 in July, and to
more than 8,000 in August. . . . The showdown came in cotton. In the last
weeks of September, with more than 20,000 workers concentrated in the
cotton fields, the union issued a call for a general strike when the demands
for higher wages and union recognition were refused. Almost before the
growers knew what was happening, more than 18,000 pickers were out
solidly on a front a hundred miles long, from Bakersfield to Merced. . . .

The strike ended with victory for the workers. . . .

“That . . . put the union solidly on its feet. As the 1933 season ended, the
membership was well over 20,000 . . . ” 3

In the early spring wages were around 15 cents an hour. The
ﬁrst strike forced a 221/2% cent scale. The great peach strike boosted
the scale to 25 cents. I-n some sections of the grape harvest, 30 cents
was won. In cott-on the workers boosted the 60 cents to 75 and

[10]

 

80. That is why in 1933 California cannery workers, constituting
30% of those in the national industry, got 33% of all the wages.
Extra wages won through strikes in that year have been estimated
at $2,000,000 for fruit, vegetable and cotton picking, and for can-
nmg. v

THE SLAVE-HERDERS REPLY

THE bosses do not take such threats to their butlers and their
Venetian goblets peacefully. They organize to resist. The yellow
press which serves them screams “Revolution!” The life of a
union man is made as unbearable as it is in Fascist countries where
union membership is regarded as treason.

Mexican consuls threaten Mexican strikersjwith deportation
unless they surrender. A hospital sends a striker’s wife to die of
pneumonia in the ﬁelds. The strikers’ lawyer is kidnapped. “The
American Legion reserve was mobilized to keep down the rising tide
of strike sentiment,” boasted the Calexico Chronicle. The New
York Times’ reported that “local authorities in the cotton co-unties
took sides with the ranchers.” Reactionary judges issue anti-labor
injunctions, and a “peace officer” brazenly declares to-the San
Diego Sun that, should a Federal Court enjoin attacks on strike
meetings, “there will be bloodshed.” Strikers are beaten, jailed, put
into concentration camps, run out of the county, shot and killed.

In March, 1935, the New York Post sent a reporter, James
Rorty, into the Imperial Valley; he is a friend of unionism and a
member of the Non-Partisan Labor Defense. He was jailed and
deported to Arizona. Max Knepper is a reporter for Upton Sin-
clair’s EPIC N ews, favorite paper of scores of thousands of Cali-
fornia Democrats. Here is his story of what happened when he got
off the train in El Centro:

“Immediately a big bruiser . . . stepped up and politely inquired: ‘What
the hell do you think you’re doing around here? Do you think the railroad

[11]

is being run to accommodate you birds? . . . You want to be damn careful
where you go. We don’t want no trouble makers in the Valley.’ I dis-
covered later that this . . . is one of the famous ‘vigilantes’ who go about
tarring and feathering, beating and kidnapping . . . people whose economic
or social beliefs vary. . . . It is very diﬂicult to get workers to talk. They
are so frightened.” .

N o wonder the head of the California State Federation of Labor
(A. F. of L.) told a New York Times correspondent that to sur-
vive the -bosses’ terror, an organizer would have to be a fanatic!
But the new union fought on. ' '

The bosses felt it necessary to set up a special organization to
smash it. Because it wants to pass as “a small man’s organization,”
it is called the “Associated Ffarmers,” but it was started by an
executive of the Paciﬁc Gas and Electric Co. (Tom Mooney’s chief
foe) ; a representative of -the Industrial Association (which spent
two million dollars :in ﬁve years to make San Francisco an open-
shop town) ; and an executive of the California Packing Corpora-
tion. At the organizing meeting in Fresno, S. Parker Frisselle, a
big—shot in the industry, announced that the new body would be
ﬁnanced by “bankers, shippers and oil companies.” .

Herman Cottrell, a grower, told the object of this organization

I to the Sacramento Bee: “We aren’t going to stand for any more of

these organizers. Anyone who peeps about higher wages will wish
he hadn’t.” The Associated imported gangsters to “guard” giant
farms, set up stockades, installed machine ‘guns. A slush fund was

handed out to sheriffs, cops, editors and other useful gentlemen. As”

the blossoms showed early in 1934, the bosses were ready for a
ﬁnish ﬁght against the new union. Norman Mini tells the story;

“In late January 3,000 lettuce pickers struck in the Imperial Valley. The
growers and shippers let loose a reign of terror on them which made all
previous terrors look the merest practice. All suspected organizers were
arrested . . . the Imperial Valley‘ ‘peace’ officers deﬁed Federal court in-
junctions and broke up all workers meetings. The strike was crushed.
That was the beginning of the retreat. . . . In June the union made one last
heroic stand . . . in the apricotorchards at _Brentwood.  . When 400
workers turned out to picket . . ..deputies calmly herded the entire group

[12]

 

‘into a railroad cattle pen, picked out all the leaders, andescorted most

of the rest to the county line. As a result of the strike wages were reduced
from 20 cents to 15 cents an hour. After that the union folded up.”'

This reduction came despite the doubling of the cost of apricots
to you over what you paid in V1933! All along the line the bosses
began to cut. Now that the 1935 season is Well under Way, the pre-
vailing rateis again down to 221/2 cents an hour, and more cuts
are looming.

THE SACRAMENTO CONSPIRACY‘

 ITH the union on the run, the Associated set out to insure

super-proﬁts by ridding themselves permanently of the outstanding
union leaders. On April 24-, 1934, the District Attorney of Sacra-
mento County hired private detectives——to Whom the taxpayers
had to pay $7,500—-to spy on union leaders and “reds.” Under

cover of an anti-“red” hysteriayworked up by the Industrial Asso— '

ciation during the San Francisco general strike, the Associated
ordered the police to raid the union office late in July. The police
seized its files and jailed for “vagrancy” Workers arrested at a
committee meeting and in their own homes. The arrestedincluded
Pat Chambers, the union’s State Organizer; Caroline Decker, its
Secretary; active unionists such as Jack Warnick and Norman Mini

and fourteen others: Nora Conklin, Lorine Norman, Jack Crane,’

Martin Wilson, A1 Hougarty, Harry Collentz, Lee Hung, Mike
Plesch, A. G. Ford, Fred Kirkwood, Donald Bigham, Luther
Mincy, W. H. Huﬂine and John Fisher. The Sacramento “criminal

’ syndicalism” conspiracy was ready for hatching!

But What is “criminal syndicalism?”

In 1919, When War hysteria made vast sections of people subject
to reactionary agitation, a law Was passed in California and other
states making “criminal syndicalism” punishable by a term in state's
prison. The law deﬁnes “criminal syndicalism” as follows:

[13]

“Any doctrine or precept advocating, teaching or aiding and abetting
the commission of crime, sabotage (which word is hereby deﬁned as
meaning wilful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical prop-
erty), or unlawful acts of force or violence or unlawful methods of terror-
ism as a means of accomplishing a change of industrial ownership or con-
trol, or effecting any political change.”

Between 1919 and 1924, 504 Californians were arrested and 264
tried under this law. Defendants generally testified in their own
behalf that they belonged to the I.W.W. But, says ex-Warden G.
W. Kirchwey of Sing Sing in his “Survey of the Workings of the
Criminal Syndicalism Law of California,” “there seems to have
been a complete lack of legitimate evidence to establish the unlawful
aims of the organizations whose criminal purposes were alleged as
the basis of the prosecution.” Prosecutors offered instead framed
or irrelevant evidence, propagandized the juries, and got 164 con-
victions. Kirchwey calls the law “an instrument of oppression,” and
it has been generally recognized as merely a means of framing union
organizers. In 1924 it fell into disuse, but by that time it had
served well in the drive to smash the I.W.W.

In 1933 the Associated.Farmers turned to this labor-hating law
to smash the new union. To the charge of vagrancy against the
18 arrested Sacramento workers, was added a charge of “criminal
syndicalism.”'The conspiracy of employers against union leaders
was hatched!

CALIFORNIA "JUSTICE" IN ACTION

THE indictment could no-t limit itself to talk of unions and strikes
and picketing ; some jurors might hesitate to call such things “crim-
inal syndicalism.” Nor could it charge acts of violence or sabotage,
because none had been committed. The District Attorney tried to
evade the difficulty as strike-breakers and reactionaries always do:
by raising a “red” scare. His indictment charged that the defend-
ants were members of the Communist Party.

[14]

 

 

The newspapers shouted for the conviction of the “reds.”

Soon after indictments were ﬁled, the District Attorney, Neil R.
McAllister, who had repeatedly refused to prosecute bank swindlers,
ran for reelection on a program of putting the “reds” in prison and
saving the U. S. from political change. He was defeated by the
people of Sacramento. Consequently, when the “criminal syndical-
ism” case was about to open on January 8, 1935, a new D. A. was
in office. The Associated Farmers preferred McAllister, and Sacra-
mento bankers ordered State Attorney General U. S. Webb to
substitute McAllister for the elected oﬁicial by naming him Special
Deputy Attorney General. McAllister agreed to serve when the
Associated undertook to pay him the difference between the $375
monthly offered by the State, and the $50 daily he ﬁrst demanded.

The jury panel was packed with such “impartial” citizens as a
Woman who had just presented the prosecution w.ith a brace of
ducks. By spending county funds to shadow prospective jurors, Mc-
Allister discovered and eliminated every union man and every
relative of a union man. The result was a jury of business men,
salesmen, well-to-do housewives, a policeman’s mother and several
retired gentlemen, including _one cocktail pal of the prosecutor!
These, surely, would have no bias for the defendants!

On the bench sat Dal M. Lemmon, so “unbiased” that one night
at his club he said that “in time of war Norman Mini would be
a great danger to the government.” ‘ This opinion of the learned
jurist was Widely circulated. When American Legion leaders sug-
gested that, as an Illinois lawyer, Albert Goldman should not be
allowed to appear, the Judge illegally threatened to eject Goldman,
and abandoned his plan only because he feared a protest. Compelled
by the defense to investigate jury-tampering, he called off the in-
quiry when it got hot for the prosecutor. “The latitude which
Judge Lemmon permitted the prosecution in the introduction of
material which had no relation to the activities of the defendants”
was denied to the defense.‘ Thus Lemmon served the Associated.

"[15]

ARE THESE "CRIMINAL SYNDICALISTS?"

WHAT did the prosecution prove against the 17 workers brought
up in Superior Court on January 8? ° C '

After 74 court days—one of the longest criminal trials in Amer-
ican history—the prosecution proved just this: that the defendants
committed the crime of organizing a union, striking, setting up
pieleet lines, and winning wage raises!

The prosecutor did not prove that most of the defendants were

_ C. P. members. Taking the stand in their own behalf, every de-

fendant belonging to that organization’ proclaimed his membership.’
Was this a crime? The C. P. is legal in California; its election
ticket .is on the ballot; it holds public meetings daily; its state leader
appeared as a Witness in this very trial and Was not arrested. The
prosecutor proved nothing on this score.

The police had taken from the C. P. headquarters various pam-
phlets and papers. Others Were seized i-n union headquarters, in a
bookstore, and in a room used by Warnick for classes in economics
and public speaking. The prosecution introduced some 200 such
documents, and for a week read selected passages to the jury to
build up a picture of violence and terror. The defense later showed
that the prosecutor had entirely misrepresented the views and aims
expressed in the documents.

Far from advocating force and violence, Sam Darcy, chief
California spokesman of the C. P., declared that his object might

‘ come about “through a group of left-Wing Congressmen” starting a

new government. “The workers and farmers government,” advo-
cated by the C. P., he declared, “might come about through uni-
versal suffrage.” Force and violence, according to Darcy and the
C. P. defendants, is something inevitable; they can no more be

blamed for predicting it than can a scientist who correctly predicts

an earthquake. The “criminal syndicalism” law says nothing about

[16]

 

predicting force and violence, and therefore when the prosecutor
“proved” that the defendants made predictions, he proved no crime.

All the documents offered in evidence pass through the U. S.
mails legally, and are purchasable at dozens of stores. When the
prosecutor proved that the defendants’ organization had sold such

"material, he proved no crime.

The prosecution produced stool—pigeons, the Four Horseman of
the Associated Farmers: Messrs. Hanks, Harr, Hicks and Harris.
Hanks, an old professional labor spy, told a cock-and-bull story
about being kidnapped by “reds.” On cross-examination he said that

his “red abductors” took him home for his clothes before running '

him out of town; he did not appeal to any of the people athis home
“because most of them were drunk!” Hicks, a naval reserve oﬂicer
testiﬁed that he had read the “Communist Manifesto.” Asked to
give the words ormeaning of any sentence, he was unable to do so.

The Four Horsemen revealed the following sensational facts:

Some defendants had said they favor a revolution “in the October
way, the Russian way.” 3 Several, it was maintained, expressed in-
tention of seizing the U. S. government “by force and arms.” In a
Whole year, Hanks had never heard the defendants say anything else
important! Hicks “proved” that Caroline Decker told him to dis-
tribute leaﬂets advocating higher wages for California’ Packing
Corporation employees! Asked Whether the defendants discussed
arming themselves at their secret meetings, the stool—pigeons con-
fessed they had never seen or heard of arms——but there was a type-
writer!

The Four Horsemen "proved” exactly nothing!

The prosecution produced “impartial” Witnesses to tell of violence
i-n Brentwood and Pixley. One, Frank M. Peterson, was a ranch-
owner and vigilante accused of murdering strikers in 1933. The
truth, revealed by the defense, was well summ-ed by F. F. Forbes

in the New York Times (Oct. 19, 1933) :

[17]

“There seems to be no question as to main facts. A mass meeting of
strikers was in progress. . . . Ranchers organized a caravan of about 30
automobiles, drove into Pixley and surrounded the meeting. Suddenly there
was a shot from the caravan, then a volley. Three men fell deadéand many
were wounded.” .

One stool-pigeon testified that Norman Mini, who is an ex-West
Pointer, organized a revolutionary army! Cross~examined, the spy
had to admit that he knew only that one Sunday morning Mini
taught a dozen boys how to do right- and left—face. They carried
neither guns nor sticks, were preparing to do fancy drill such as
the Elks do in a parade, and never met again! d

On the score of overt, illegal acts, the prosecutor proved nothing.

For four hours the prosecutor cross-examined Mini, trying to
bully and trick him, but Mini Was guilty of no crime and refused
to be shaken. He explained how he thought a Workers government
could come about, including the use of force against any who might
seek in the interests of a predatory minority to frustate the will of
an overwhelming majority. McAllister asked Mini What he would
do should a majority object to a social change. He replied that he
would not consider the time ripe “as long as a majority objects.”

“But suppose a majority of capital objects, that is of property?”
asked the employee of the capital represented in the Associated
Farmers. A

“Oh I” answered Mini, “you mean the three percent of the peo-
ple who own 85% of the Wealth ?” A

“That’s right,” answered McAllister, who Went on to try to get
Mini to state that he advocates something equivalent to bank rob-
bery. Mini rejected every hare-brained insinuation of the prosecutor.
and deﬁantly clung to his position in favor of “a movement of the
producers to take back What they have produced and what has been
taken from them.” °
Nor did any other defendant advocate or justify any criminal

deed.

What was proven? That some defendants belonged to a political
party which is on the California ballot; distr.ibuted pamphlets
which the U. S. Post Office also handles; were profoundly discon-
tented with existing social conditions; and desired a social order
different from the existing one. \

More important: some had struck, pic/eeted, played a role in rais-
ing workers’ wages. The prosecution proved this point very well.

"THE COMMUNITY WANTS A CONVICTION!"

IF THE prosecutor could masquerade as “The People of the State
of California,” surely the Associated Farmers could masquerade as
“the community,” and so, whenever they screamed for a convic-
tion, it was not in the name of the conspiracy, but in the name of
“the community.”

The jury, containing no union men or workers, was prejudiced
against all strikers and radicals, and the Di A. incited every pos-
sible bias. For example, he brought in a Los Angeles cop who
alleged that he attended a meeting at which a Communist made the

' following remarks:

“What of the capitalist men after the revolution? We’ll line them up
against the wall and shoot them down. What of the capitalist women?
We"ll strip them of their ‘silks and satins and they will come crawling
through the muck and mire on their white bellies, asking your favors and
mine, comrades.” ‘

The meeting at which the alleged statements were supposed to
have been made took place in Los Angeles ﬁve years before the trial,
and the alleged statements were attributed to a man named Sklar
whowas not a defendant! Aida Handler, a University of California
student, took the stand and testified that she was present when Sklar
spoke at the meeting described and that he made no such statements.
But on the basis of such irrelevant and fraudulent evidence, the
prosecutor asked for a conviction in the name of the jurors’ wives
and daughters.

A43:

McAllister asked the defendants if they wanted to conﬁscate
stocks, some of wh:ich were owned by jurors. He told the jury that
the defendants do not believe in religion or the superiority of the
white to the Negro and yellow races. He lyingly insinuated that two
defendants were living together without being married. He falsely
charged that “reds” had threatened violence to State’s witnesses.
He waved the'American ﬂag, and told the jurors it was their
patriotic duty to convict! The San Francisco N ews, anti-Communist
and pro-Roosevelt, wrote (Apr. ,2) its view of the prosecutor’s
tactics:

“Every effort was made . . . to make the jurors feel that they could not
acquit . . . without putting themselves in the position of defending Com-
munism.” '

McAllister’s argument was not that the defendants had com-
mited a crime; it was solely the argument of the Associated Farmers:

The community wants a conviction. A

The Associated used the newspapers to popularize this slogan.
Almost daily after court, Gilbert’ Parker, Associated publicity
agent, would instruct reporters on how to twist and distort what
had transpired, in order to discredit the defendants. The result was
a stream of lies and misrepresentations in all the big newspapers.

' For example, Hanks’ per°ured testimony was reported in detail;
J

his collapse was played down. An eﬁort was made to make it seem
that defendants had “confessed ;” they could not because they had
not committed any crime. Whenthe defense said that the convic-
tion of innocent union men would encourage reactionaries to start
new violent attacks on workers, the papers said that the defendants
had threatened violence. When Attorney Goldman ﬁnished his plea
to the jury, the reporter for the Bee, one of the powerful Mc-
Clatchy chain of papers, slipped him a shamefaced note apologizing
in advance for the distortion his paper would publish.

The Bee also published many articles designed to lead the unin-

[20]

 

 

‘formed to fear that the morrow held untold dangers of “red”
violence and bloodshed. A few headlines show the Bee’s tone during
the period of the trial:

RADICAL BOOKLET URGES SECRECY UPON MEMBERS
PASTOR SEES RED MENACE GROWING
RED MENACE T0 SCHOOLS Is TOLD
RED PLOT To GET YOUTHS Is BARED
REDS ATTEMPT TO CONTROL C.W.A. LEAGUE BOARD
ARMY AIDE TELLS REVOLT TEACHING OF REDS HERE

The Bee made it plain that important people desired and were
taking decisive action to save the citizens from a blood-bath:

CHAMBER PLANS RADICAL CURB
JUNIOR REPUBLICAN "CLUB RAPS COMMUNIST PARTY
LEGION DRIVE To OUST COMMUNISM Is BARED
CAVALIERS WILL URGE STRONGER ANTI-RED LAWS
CITY MANAGER URGES NEW FEDERAL ANTI-RED LAWS
RED MENACE Is CITED IN MOVE To LIMIT VOTE
SHERIFF HUNTS ARMED REDS IN ALMADEN HILLS

Finally, the Bee published sensational interviews with the Mayor,
Legion Commander, managers of an ice company and an orchard
supply company, the president of the Builders Exchange, the sec-
retary of the Chamber of Commerce and officers of the Bank of
America and the Capital National Bank. Through these interviews
and many editorials, the Bee passed sentence long before the con-
clusion of the trial, and insisted that: "

The community wants a conviction!” _

Other allies aided the Associated. The American Legion, Elks,
Moose, Lions and other carnivorous bands howled against the
“reds.” Politiciansover the radio; priests, pastors and rabbis in the
pulpit; bankers and boosters at Rotary Club lunches—.-—all ‘de-
nounced radicals and strikes.

[31]

A vigilante gang called “Cavaliers” held armed drill in _the
streets. In the midst of the trial the City Manager announced the
“danger” of an invasion by an army of “reds.” He recruited 600
citizens as an armed “defense brigade.” The papers featured, the
news: the 6-inch headline of the San Francisco Chronicle made it
a big seller for a day:‘

Sacramento Citizens Army M usters To Quash Reds
Guns Bristle, City Is Ready to Halt Riots
What “reds,-” What “riots?” None at all. The Associated invented
the whole “danger” in order to reinforce its catch-phrase:

The community wants a conviction.

Every night the jurors went home, to socials, to lodge meetings.
Friends, lodge brothers, bosses, partners, spiritual advisers, wives,
all discussed the trial. Who believes that the jurors never heard an
opinion about the defendants? Who thinks they never read a paper?
Maybe the prosecutor did not threaten or bribe a single juror
directly. Why bother? Day after day, night after night, the jurors
all heard from those in authority, those closest to them, those con-
trolling their means of livelihood, the war-cry of the Associated
Farmers: _

THE COMMUNITY WANTS A CONVICTION!

THE VERDICT

F ROM July until January the defendants sat in jail; from January
until the end of May the case was in court. Three defendants were
dismissed, and four counts dropped as against all defendants. The
prosecutor pretended that this showed his “fairness;” actually it
was forced on him by the lack even of perjured evidence. At last the
fate of the 14 remaining defendants went to the jury. Few people
could hope for acquittals after the manner in which the trial had
been conducted. Indeed, as the jurors ﬁled out one of them pre-
dicted that they would reach a verdict of guilty .in an hour.

[22]

 

 

.x

The surprising fact is that, for 66 tense hours, the jury reached’
no agreement. As each moment went by, the defendants gained
hope and the prosecutor became visibly depressed.

The Associated’s representatives were panic-stricken. They
launched a rumor that the “reds” were planning to raid the court
and, in case of a conviction, to attack the jurors. Moreover, the
Associated’s agents spread the threat that, .in case of an acquittal,
“the community” would take the law into ‘its own hands. Half a
dozen tough-looking specimen-s appeared in court, to whom an As-
sociated man pointed out the defendants, their lawyers and friends.
Defendant Warnick discovered Cavalier-thugs drilling in a lot;
when he took down their automobile l.icense numbers, they attacked
him. A prominent Sacramentan advised one defense attorney “to
skip quick if there is an acquittal!”

For two years the exploited Valley workers fought their masters.
For t-en months the Associated carried on its counter-attack through
this trial. Now the struggle’s heat was transferred to the jury-room,
where “twelve good men and true” were split into opposing groups.
Those who wanted to acquit spoke in the name of law and evidence;
those who wanted to convict voiced again the slogan of the As-

_ sociated:

THE COMMUNITY WANTS A CONVICTION!

Howard 0: Mclntire, who led those favoring acquittal, is “a
family man and church-goer, Sacramento’s leading Mason, for
seven years a National Guardsman and for 27 years an employee
of the State Adjutant General’s office. He later stated that he
“knew nothing about Communism and did not like it, but tried to
keep an open mind as to the defendants’ guilt und-er the law.”
Despite all that happened, he remained unconvinced of their guilt,
and he won the support of Mrs. Keith, the mother of a policeman;
Mr. Martel, a salesman for a large corporation, and Mr. Shan-
-non, wealthy and Sacramen.t,o’s'best-dressed citizen.

[23]

 

When Juror Jackson swung to the minority on one ballot,,an-
other juror warned him that -he might lose his Southern Paciﬁc
Railroad pension. Jackson swung ‘back to the majority. Rumors
about impending violence reached the jurors, who also saw armed
police domineering the courtroom at the Judge’s orders. Juror
Perry called Mrs. Keith a “red,” and warned her that her police-
man son might be fired. Mr. Mclntire Was reminded that he owes
money to a. bank, which is part of “the community” desiring a
conviction. Foreman Rackliffe declared that the issue «before the
jury was patriotism against Bolshevisml

.Mr. Mclntire is kind-hearted, wishing nobody harm. He knew
the defendants to be innocent. But over and over he had been told
that "the community wants a conviction.” After 66 hours, when it
began to seem that a mistrial must result, Mr. Mclntire sobbingly
surrendered, and the opposition went to pieces. A compromise, il-
legal according to the law and the Judge’s instructions, was ar-
ranged. One count was to be thrown out altogether; on count 6,
six defendants would be acquitted and eight convicted, two of the
latter with recommendation for probation. '

Among the acquitted are some against whom ‘the "evidence” is
the same as against some who were convicted.

A n ordinary horse—trade with human beings as the objects!

The conspiracy organized by the Associated Farmers was a
success. The jurors had been made to feel that to acquit these inno-
cent young people would be to endorse Communism. As the San
Francisco News said, this was "the decisive factor behind the
verdict.”

Norman Mini, Lorine Norman, Pat Chambers, Caroline Decker,
Nora Conklin, Martin Wilson, Jack Crane, Al Hougarty—eight
young working people sentenced to prison for 14- years each, a
crushing defeat inﬂicted on the oppressed Valley workers, the name
of their union obliterated in the dungeons of San Quentin and

[24]

 

 

 

Tehachapi. True, the trial cost the Sacramento community $25,000, '

but, as the Hearst Examiner boasted (Apr. 2), the verdict “re-
moved the leadership” of the union. That was Worth every penny,
not to the taxpayers, but to the California plunderbund which
plotted and directed the whole conspiracy.

THE APPEAL

BUT no sooner was the verdict in than a glaring light was thrown
on it. ,

Of his own free will, because, as he said, consciousness of wrong
kept him awake at night, Juror McIntire gave representatives of the
Non-Partisan Labor Defense an aﬂidavit in which h-e showed the
verdict’s illegality. The aﬂidavit, presented in court by Attorney
Goldman in arguing for a new trial, reads in part as follows: '

“Howard S. Mclntire being duly sworn o-n oath deposes and says:

“That due to the disagreement of the jurors the question of a com-
promise . . . was raised . . . .

“ . . . that with reference to the defendant Norman Mini he expressed
the conviction to the other jurors that there was insuﬂicient evidence for a
verdict of guilty and that he ﬁnally consented. to vote guilty as to the
defendant Norman Mini, despite his conviction that he was not guilty,
on condition that the jurors recommend probation; and in consideration
of the above-mentioned compromise;

“ .. . . that with reference to the defendant Caroline Decker he also ex-
pressed the conviction . . . that there was insuﬂicient evidence for a verdict
of guilty, but ﬁnally consented to vote guilty in consideration of the com-
promise; v ‘

“ . . . that, as to the defendants Norman Mini and Caroline Decker, he
never was and is not now convinced to a moral certainty and beyond
reasonable doubt of the suﬂiciency of the evidence. . . .

“Deponent alleges that he makes this aﬂidavit of his own free will and
on his own initiative, solely for the purpose of preventing a miscarriage
of justice, and of righting a wrong for which I feel partly but deeply
responsible.

(Signed) Howmu) S. MCINTIRE.” "

The newspapers denounced Mr. Mclntire as a traitor and liar,
and the Judge waved his aﬂidavit aside as irrelevant and unimpor-

’_[-7-5]

tant, declared the verdict legal, refused a new trial and imposed
sentence. But there can ‘be no doubt that Mr. McIntire was telling
the truth. ‘ .

Probation would have meant accepting the hypocritical mercy of
a court which «helped frame them, would have meant an admission
of guilt of some crime and a promise not to repeat it. Consequently,
Norman M.ini and Lorine Norman bravely rejected this “mercy.”
Standing erect, they led their fellow-prisoners to the “penitentiary,”
maintaining their innocence and their right to have done what they
did. Before sentence was passed, Norman Mini said to the Judge:

“Our standing here is no accident. Our conviction is the result of the
inner logic of the class struggle. But the same class struggle that results in
our conviction will some day generate an irresistible wave that will sweep
away forever everything this court and state represents. With this knowl-
edge, we can face our sentences conﬁdently; we know that the future
belongs to us.”

These are not the words of a criminal, nor were those of M.ini’s
fellow-“convicts.” They are the words of a courageous ﬁghter, a
martyr to principle, and well express the person who thrice refused
the prosecutor’s offer of immunity in return for his service as State’s
witness. In this spirit, all the defendants heard the cell-doors bang
behind them.

But the light is not ended. An appeal can be made to the Cali-
fornia Supreme Court and if need be to the United States Supreme
Court. Not only does the trial record show many reasons for
setting aside the verdict,” but the illegal nature of the verdict itself
makes po-ssible an appeal on sound legal grounds. There is every
legal reason for a reversal of the verdicts.

THE ISSUE BEFORE US

YOU have read the story of the Sacramento conspiracy plotted
by the Associated Farmers in order to crush the union which was
compelling a redistribution of the proﬁts of’ the Valleys. You

L26]-

know how prosecutor and Judge and jury and press and every force
dominated by the agricultural oligarchy carried out that conspiracy.
As t-he San Francisco News said: these workers were convicted
“because they organiz-ed miserably paid fruit and cotton pickers
into a militant union (Apr. 19).”
. They committed this crime and they committed no other.

If they can be kept in prison for 14 years, what is to happen to
other union organizers, whatever their political views or afliliations?
Only a few months ago two A. F. of L. pickets were killed on the
line at Salinas; any A. F. of L. union which conducts an aggresive
ﬁght, can be charged with “criminal syndicalism.” What is to
happen to anybodywho arouses the enmity of the o-ligarchy? What
of the rights of free speech and press, the rig-h.t to organize, strike
and p.icket, all won through so many bitter struggles? And What if
“criminal syndicalism” laws are adopted by the Federal Congress?
Where then will be civil rights and the rights of labor in any state?

There is a grave danger that, in all states, “criminal syndicalism”
laws will be invoked against workers who organize to fight for an
"American standard of living.”

William Randolph. Hearst correctly says we are faced by a test
case, a national issue.

Is Hearst to Win, and spread the bloody tyranny of the Cali-
fornia Valleys through the whole country? Or is the verdict to be
upset, the conspiracy defeated, and the reactionary forces driven

back ?

The issue is squarely before us.

i DEFEAT THE CONSPIRACY
THE National Sacramento Appeal Committee (N .S.A‘.C.) leads

the ﬁght to defeat the Associated’s “criminal syndicalism” con-
spiracy. It has been constituted by many organizations which have
many differences among themselves, but are united against the

[27]

“criminal syndicalism” law and the Sacramentoconspiracy. The
N.S.A.C. has retained an able attorney to appeal Mini’s case to
the California Supreme Court." It is conducting a campaign to
raise funds to cover the appeal expenses.

There are legal reasons for a— reversal. But there were for ac-
quittal and for setting aside the horse-trade verdict. The truth is
that mere legal reasons have little weight where the Associated has
inﬂuence—and that means in California's Supreme Court. The
Mooney case proves the court’s subservience to the plunderbund.

Only one thing can prevent the court from obeying the Asso-
ciated Farmers: should it see that hundreds of thousands of people
throughout the country understand and resent this conspiracy, it
will hesitate to sustain the infamous verdicts. If enough people ex-
press their resentment in a digniﬁed, organized, aggressive manner,
the court will have to listen to the attorney’s legal arguments . . .
and to reverse the horse-trade verdicts produced by the Associated
Farmers’ conspiracy.

In addition to sending ﬁnancial aid—a penny, a dollar, a bun-
dred—you can_add your voice to the swelling chorus of trade
unionists and enemies of reaction who are, in many ways, informing
California’s rulers that they stand against the conspirators of
Sacramento, for the rights of free speech and press and the right to
organize, strike and picket, and for the release of the eight prisoners.

There is sunshine on California, but there. is also blood—and the
dark shadow of -class justice. V

Those who cultivate, harvest, sort and pack the oranges have a
right to earn enough to buy back a few for their little ones. The
Sacramento trial was a vicious, reactionary conspiracy to smash
unionism, which alone could assure this right.

The ﬁght has begun to smash. this conspiracy!

YOU BELONG IN THIS FIGHT! TI-IE IMPRISONED WORK-
ERS COUNT ON YOU! DO NOT FAIL THEM!

FOREWORD  

N APRIL, 1935, eight young people of Sacramento were rail-
roaded to San Quentin and Tehachapi, California’: prison hells

 

where sit Tom Mooney and so many other labor martyrs. They have ,

been sentenced to terms of up to fourteen years each on the charge
of being in a conspiracy to commit "criminal syndicalism.”

They were in no conspiracy whatsoever.

The truth is, as this pamphlet reveals, that they were the victims
of a conspiracy of anti-union forces led by the Associated Farmers,
Inc. The object of this conspiracy has been revealed by F. J. Palmo-
mares, one of the Associated’s subordinates. On February 4 he told
the Sacramento Bee that the trial was "of utmost importance” to his
bosses "because they believe the defendants responsible for the San
Joaquin Valley strike of I933——the first serious one in the section’s
history.” In the words of the New York Times of Jan. 20, 1935,
the defendants had led strikes and been "responsible for raised
wages and improved living conditions” among the exploited migra-
tory agricultural workers of California. Hence the conspiracy
against them.

The conspiracy was carried out under cover of a ”red” scare, and
by means of the "criminal syndicalism” statute, denounced by lead-
ing trade unionists, educators, clergymen, publicists and jurists asa
vicious instrument of oppression. The "red” scare was also used
by reactionary California legislators to introduce new bills against

.free speeclz and the rights of labor to organize and strike. Happily

 

nzost of these were defeated, but the Sacramento convictions are
pointed to by reactionaries as proof that there is a need for more
gag laws and more "criminal syndicalism” prosecutions.

Today, -many states have laws like California's "criminal syndi-
calism” statute. William Randolph Hearst has proclaimed that the
Sacramento conspiracy should be a model for all states, and he
advocates a similar Federal law.

HEARST CORRECTLY SAYS THE SACRAMENTO
CASE IS A NATIONAL ISSUE.

If the verdicts are upset, the teeth can be drawn from the

"criminal syndicalism” law and the drive for new anti-labor and

[3]

  

    

APPEN‘DIX

WHY IS THERE NOT A UNITED DEFENSE?

ALTHOUGH many organizations, differing with each other, have
joined in the National Sacramento Appeal Committee, the Inter-
national Labor Defense, representing the defendants belonging to
the Communist Party, has ignored proposals of a joint defense.

Mini has refused to entrust his fate to the I.L.D. ; he bases his-

action on the C.P.-I.L.D. record during the trial. C. P. newspapers
then characterized as a “confession” a statement given by Mini to
the prosecutor whose immunity oﬂers he thrice refused. Because,
disdaining to conceal his connections or beliefs, he spoke openly of
them, the C.P.-I.L.D. branded Mini a “stool-pigeon” on the eve
of his conviction! During the trial Jack Warnick wrote that these
attacks constituted '

“an attempt to frame the boy and ruin his reputation for the rest of his
life. From my close acquaintance with "Mini in jail . . . I am convinced
that he did not give the statement with evil intent. He didn’t try to save
himself from a prison term and he didn’t intentionally give information
against his fellow-defendants. Neither do I think the information he
gave is damaging to the case.”

I.n a leaﬂet entitled “Criminal Syndicalist or Renegade?” Mini
wrote about the attacks on him:

“The statement . . . bearing the names of my fellow defendants (except
Warnick) was dictated by Sam Darcy, District Organizer of the C. P.
. . . Hoping thereby to distract people’s attention from the C. P.’s record
of criminal mismanagement and wrecking in the Sacramento case, the
Darcy machine broadcasts the yarn that the prosecution, which is trying
to railroad me to San Quentin has my cooperation! . . . The defendants
signed . . . because the Darcy machine has ‘terrorized them. Caroline
Decker . . . has testified that the I.L.D. withheld bail. . . . This was on
Darcy’s orders, and now the prisoners are terrorized. . . .”

After answering the C. P. attacks on himself, Mini continued:

“The Darcy indictment also charges me with aiding the prosecution
through the policy of my attorney, Albert Goldman. . . . When Gallagher
for the third time squabbled with a juror and declared in front of the
jury: ‘I am not talking for the jury; I am talking for the people in the

[30]

courtroom,’ Goldman publicly expressed his disagreement with _these tactics.
After all, it is the jury which renders the verdict, and it is good that they
should know that somebody in the court besides the prosecution is con-
cerned with what they think. . . .

“ . . . the Darcy indictment accuses the Workers Party of disrupting a
‘united front’ . . . Now, from July until January the C. P. avoided the
building of a united front. . . . It was forced into one by the Non-Partisan
Labor Defense. . . . Before the united front committee could take any
public action, the C. P. . . . drove out . . . everybody who rejects the au-
thority of the C P. Consequently the defense is split today.

“The charge that the NPLD has done nothing for the defense . . . I shall
answer by quoting a . . . letter written by Caroline Decker on Dec. 18 . . . :

“ ‘I’m convinced now that the District committee has _deﬁnite reasons
for not getting me out. . . . I’m not prepared to say that"the criminal
neglect of the union by the District Committee was “opposition.” . . .
Elaine (I.L.D. oﬂicial) says its not important for us to be out. I’m
deﬁnitely resigned to that now . . . So you see——here I am——in jail-
ostracized by my own Party. . . . There are only the bars to bat
against—-the gray walls to question and a stone wall as ,far as my
letters of inquiry to the District Committee are concerned.’

“Decker got out on bail because she applied to the NPLD for bail and
. . . Decker has repeatedly said that the action of the NPLD alone com-

pelled the I.L.D. to suddenly produce a wad of bail and take out the other.

prisoners whom they had kept in jail for six wretched months!”

Mini was not alone in blaming the C. P. for disrupting the united
defense; so did the American Civil Liberties Union and, as the
following oﬂicial statement shows, the Socialist Party of California:

“The defendants were gratiﬁed to learn that they were to have the
support not merely of the usual Communist-ruled set-up of ‘innocent
clubs’ and paper organizations, but of a genuine and broad united defense
which might appeal for aid to the whole labor movement. . . The CP-
controlled delegates, however, after repeated breaches of faith, and despite

concessions made by the other groups for the sake of unity, deliberately

smashed the uniﬁed defense.”

When the N .S.A.C. was being constituted, the NIPLD, League
for Industrial Democracy, Socialist Party and Workers Party in-
vited the I.L.D. to participate. The invitation was ignored. The
entire responsibility for any disunity in the appeal, as in the trial,
is on the shoulders of the I.L.D. and the C.P. Refusing to abandon
Mini to the C. P. and the I.L.D., the National Sacramento Appeal
Committee will aid all the defendants in every Way possible and
calls for the release of all of them.

UNION LABOR AND CRIMINAL SYNDICALISM

_ By SAMUEL S. Warm
Manager, San Franciua Joint Board, I.L.G.W.U.

THE appeal of Norman Mini from his conviction under the
vicious criminal syndicalism law of California will be support-
ed by the entire class-conscious labor movement of the state,
without regard to the political or economic philosophies of the in-
dividual trade unionists. The entire labor movement of this state
can always be counted on to back every movement to free the vic-
tims of this law, especially when those victims have been prosecuted
for their labor activity.

In California, as in every State where such laws exist, they are
invoked by the employing class against every class-conscious work-

er who seeks to awaken and lead his fellow workers in struggles for

‘ their own betterment. This is true in the Sacramento cases.

It is a matter of some gratiﬁcation to the labor movement that
Mini will be represented on appeal by‘Raymond W. Henderson,
whose record as an attorney in defense of those persecuted by the
employing class has ‘won him the sincere respect and love of the
workers. ’

Through the unitediand persistent support of the working class
of this state and of the nation, I am sure that Mini and the other
victims of capitalist “justice” can be freed to continue their ﬁne
work on behalf of the exploited and downtrodden toilers. A

NORMAN MINI: AN APPRECIATION

By TRAVERS CLEMENTS
Co—author of “Rebel America”

THE young-est of the eight “outside agitators” convicted of “crim-
inal syndicalism” in Sacramento is 26-year old Norman lVIini.

Unfortunately for the propaganda “angle” of news stories in
reactionary papers, this young “outside agitator” with the foreign-
sounding name is a native of Sacramento and an ex-West Point
cadet! His parents were workers—his father a member of the
Railway Brotherhoods. Because of the encouragement received for
an unusual scholarship record in the public schools, -he decided to
try for West Point. He passed his entrance examinations with an
unusually high rating, and received a fan-fare of “local boy makes
good” publicity in the home-town papers.

Mini entered West Point without a “subversive” idea in his
head. He left at the request of the authorities, after writing a
satirical sketch on military training for a student publication. Back
in Sacramento, ‘he discovered Karl Marx and the labor movement,
and became immersed in the struggles of California’s cannery and
agricultural Workers. He joined the Communist Party, leaving it
after two years to join the Workers Party of the United States.
In the interim, he had written a novel Which, if he ever gets a
chance to revise it, should be the “proletarian” book of the year.

From West Point to the,San Quentin jute mill, via the picket
lines of striking cannery and agricultural Workers, is a long road
for a young man of 26 to have travelled. Mini has negotiated it
witho-ut loss of spirit or personal integrity on the Way. No-r, as I
learned on a recent visit to San Quentin, has he lost that dry and
delightful sense of humor, manifesting itself in his quiet drawl which
so infuriated the District Attorney while Mini occupied the witness
stand. His great concerns at the moment are how to keep in contact
with. developments in the international labor movement, and how
to get the Warden to let him Work on the revision of his novel.

One need not be a political partisan of this boy to realize that
Prisoner No. 57606 is a credit to the whole labor movement.

Union Smashing in Sacramento
mfma-w A
SUNSHINE AND WHAT?

( CALIFORNIANS tirelessly tell of the sunshine which transforms
the great inland valleys of their state into an enormous horn
of plenty. California is the Golden State more for its food crops

g than for its mines. In the southern groves grow 99% of the lemons

and 81% of the country’s oranges. Salinas is the “salad-bowl of
the World.” Walnuts in Santa Barbara, raisins in Fresno, prunes
in the Santa Clara, peaches at Marysville, wine-grapes in the N apa,
melons, cherries, berries, tomatoes, peas... . . Almost 20% of all
vegetables, 45% of all fruits and nuts, 30% of all canned fruit: and
vegetables produced in the U. S. are California products. In 1929
Californ.ia’s crops were Worth half a billion dollars, 9% of the
total U. S. crop value. If you can afford fruits or vegetables, you
eat a California product daily.

Do you know what it takes besides sunshine to produce your
orange juice or crisp lettuce? *

It is February in a California’ Hooverville. A man—he may be a
Mexican, a Filipino or a plain America-n harvest Worker—loads his
miserable belongings into a ramshackle ﬂivver, and with his wife
and children drives to the Imperial Valley. All day he picks lettuce

under a 120 degree sun; the wife and kids trim and pack under a.

stiﬂing shed. Drinking water is so foul as to cause typhoid. Flies
and insects are a pestilence. All labor protection laws are violated.
At the season's peak, Working hours are from ,4 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
with a speed-up system. When cotton is harvested, women and
children come in from the ﬁelds dragging 50- pound and 75-pound
sacks With bleeding hands. a 1

One after another as the season moves upthrough the Imperial,
San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys, crops ripen here and there.

.[7]

Migratory workers follow them, picking, sorting, trimming, can-
ning, crating. Hard toil, disease, disorganized homes and miserable
education for the children .’ . . and in November back to Hoover-
ville. During the winter—and for 30% of the workers during the
season, according to the Cal.ifornia ERA-——there is unemployment
and its miseries.

Three to four hundred thousand people toil in this industry in
California. Their condition is thus summed up by investigators of
the U. S. National Labor Board:

“We found ﬁlth, squalor, an entire absence of sanitation and a crowding
of human beingsqinto totally inadequate tents or crude structures built of
boards, weeds and anything that was found at hand to give a pitiful
semblance of a home at its worst. Words cannot describe some of the
conditions we saw . . . many workers are not able to earn suﬂicient to
maintain even a primitive, or savage, standard of living. . . .” ‘ (All foot-
notes are on page 29.) -

The wage-slaves Want a square meal, a ho-me, an opportunity to
raise a family decently. Against those who organize unions to ﬁght
for these elementary needs, an agricultural oligarchy wages a re-
lentless campaign of persecution. So that there shall not perish from
this earth super-proﬁts for corporate landowners, packers, ginners
and mortgage-gobbling bankers,‘ many instruments are used, in-
cluding gangsters, the press, police and the courts.

Sunshine and What? And blood, the blood of exploited, oppressed

A toilers who die of hunger, of over—worl<, of gangsters’ and sheriffs’

bullets when they rebel. Sunshine and -blood create the products of
California’s Valleys, the wealth of the Golden State.

"DIVIDIN G" THE INCOME

FEW California farms belong to real farmers. Many cotton grow-
ers are mere tenants, ruled by cotton gins and ﬁnanciers. Of 17,000
acres in lettuce in Imperial Valley in 1935, only 3,510 were even
nominally independently owned. The state has more 1,000-acre-

"[8]

and-over farms than any outside the cattle and grain regions. Many
farms are owned by corporations such as the California Lands Co.,
which in turn, belong to such combines as the monster California
Packing Corporation, which has 10,000 employees. California’s
canneries average twice the size of those elsewhere.

All this means heavy capital investment and bank ownership-
control, especially by the Bank of America with its 4-.23 California
branches, and the.Anglo-California Bank. W. R. Hearst has great
investments in the industry. So has Senator Hiram Johnson, A. P.

Giannini and the Fleishacker family. Wall Street, as always, has its,

nose in the trough. ,

And what a trough! Down to 1929 California farms made
stupendous proﬁts, so that many Americans dreamed of owning
one. After the first crisis years, a new upswing began. The Cali-
fornia farm is so proﬁtable that the average acre price is by far
the highest in the U. S., while the average crop-value per acre is
almost four times the national average. The California Packing
Corporation, conitrolling Del Monte, Sunkist and scores of other
subsidiaries, admitted a. proﬁt of more than ten million dollars for
1932-33. In 1934 it paid $241,268 in dividends—and tucked away
a surplus of almost four million dollars. It has a net balanceiof
assets over liabilities of 25 million dollars.

California farms put orange juice on some of our tables. They
provide a few rich stockjobbers, landowners and bankers with

butlers to serve .it in Venetian goblets. But those whose sweat and,

blood fertilizes the soil get but a bare existence. Peas have been
picked at ten cents a hamper, and peaches at ﬁfteen cents an hour!
The New York Times (Oct. 19, 1933) estimated that at sixty
cents per hundred pounds “the average family can earn in the
cotton ﬁelds what a single breadwinner of a city. would receive
under the minimum'NRA scale.”v In 1935 a U. S. Department
of Labor man stated that the average family working in the ﬁeld
earns $600 annually, those in the sheds but $4-00.’ Others say $300.
