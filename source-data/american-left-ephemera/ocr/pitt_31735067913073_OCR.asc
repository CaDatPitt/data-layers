ROBERT BEY. PRESIDENT OF MINE-IVIILL LOCAL 758 in Chicago and chairman of the
Apex division negotiating committee, outlines the recently—ratified new contract to
Asbury Howard, international vice-president. The agreement provides wage increases
-ranging from 171/3 to 301/3 cents" per hour, a security-severance program, and.a common
’fexp'iration date for the contracts at the company's plants in Chicago and Cleveland.
I L. to R: Charles Hester, recording secretary of Local 758 and a member of the bargain-
ing committee; Iames Pinta, ‘business agent; an unidentified member of the Apex unit
of the local; Bey; Iohnnie Pruitt, a member of the Apex unit; Howard; Soloman Lamb, a

i‘ steward at the Apex plant; and Eson Freeman, a member of the negotiating, committee.

Cleveland Strike Wins Gains
For Chicago Workers As Well

, 5.1-day’strike at the Cleveland, Ohio plant of the Apex Smelting Company, a
division of American Metal Climax, resulted not only in a substantial package of wage
gains and other benefits, but in agreement on a common expiration date and joint
negotiations between the company’ and two Mine-Mill local unions——Local 735 in
Cleveland and Local 758 in Chicago, Ill. ,

- The settlement, reached in joint negotiations at the company’s Chicago office on
Nov. 28, was overwhelmingly ratified by members of both locals the following day.

- ’ Some 165 members of the Cleveland Amalgamated Local and 130 workers of the Chi-
cago Amalgamated Local are covered by the new pact. ' .

Wage increases ranging from 17% cents to 301/2 cents per hour, including equali-
zation of rates of pay for comparable jobs in the two plants, are provided by the con-

, tract, which covers a three-year period at the Cleveland plant and a 32-month period
in Chicago. Thus both contracts will expire on July 31, 1967.

f The Cleveland strike began on Oct. 8, after prolonged negotiations had failed to
produce agreement. Only when the company was faced with the threat of a two plant
strike did it make an acceptable offer. While the Cleveland contract expired on July
31, workers in Chicago could not legally Walk out until their contract expired on Dec. 1.

[Johnson Administration's Mine Safety Bill

pp-About Ready for Introduction in Congress
       -      Metcalf-Montoya Also to  
  Be Reintroduced in Session 

WASHINGTON, D. C.——The prospect of-early 'Con~ _
gre_ss1onal hearings on the subject of federal mine safety‘
. legislation were considerably brightened this holiday sea-‘ ~
son with the news from this capital city that the John- 
son administration’s bill soon may be introduced. ‘ 
lg a letter to Mine-Mill
Interior Secretary Stewart Udall notes that “the prob-
lems‘ and difficulties concerning the proposed bill have - ’_
been satisfactorily resolved” and that the Bureau of the - 
Budget will be urged to clear the bill as rapidly as pos-. -

sible.

The pigeonholing of the bill with the Budget Bureau
throughout all of 1964 also delayed hearings on the Mine-
Mill-backed Metcalf-Montoya bill, since Congress wanted
to study both proposals at the same time.

  
   
    
 

(reproduced on page 3), 

Union officials had not yet seen copies of the  ~  

son administration’s proposal at press time. The bill, ac- *
cording to Sec. Udall, has been revised. He said that his
department would recommend.

enactment of it instead of the
Metcalf-Montoya bill. ,

At the some time, Mine-Mill
has been assured that Metcalf—
Montoya will be reintroduced as
well. The union went to work on
this top priority item of its leg-
islative calendar immediately
following the November elec-
tions.

To Compare Bills

What the union's final position
and stategy will be in the com-
ing Congressional session in the
drive for federal mine safety
legislation will, of course, have
to await an opportunity to ex-
amine the revised version of the
administration. bill. The Met-
calf-Montoya proposal V w o u 1 d
cover associated smelters, re-
fineries, and other processing
plants, in addition to metal and
mineral mines, and would pro-
vide inspection and enforcement
powers.

The administration proposal is_
based on the recommendations

made in Udall’s report to Con-

gress in November, 1963, enti-
tled “Health and Safety Study
of Metal and Non-Metal Mines.”
Mine-Mill earlier had lobbied
successfully for the Congression-
al appropriations of funds with
which the Department of Inte-
rior carried out the two-year
study. L

The billwas submitted to the
Bureau of the Budget‘ last Janu-
ary and also had to. be reviewed
by other governmental agencies.
At least one such department,
according to Udall’s letter, sug-
gested an amendment.

The Metcalf-Montoya bill,

which was originally assigned '

to the Senate Interior Commit-
tee and House Committee on
Education and Labor, was trans-
ferred in March, 1964 to the Sen-
ate Labor and Public Welfare
Committee, chaired by Sen. Lis-

-ter Hill (D-Ala.), and the House‘

General Subcommittee on La-
bor, which Rep. James Roose-
velt (D-Calif.) headed.

— Sponsors of Bill

Sen. Frank E. (Ted) Moss
(D-Utah), one of the two origi-
nal Senate sponsors of Metcalf-
Montoya (S. 1949), has indicated
to" Mine-Mill that he will rein-
troduce the measure in 1965.
The other Senate sponsor, Lee
Metcalf (D-Mont), is a member
of the Labor and Public Welfare
Committee.

Another sponsor? of the bill,

gJoseph M. Montoya (D-N.M.),

 

 

moved up from the House to the
Senate in November. He has
written that he will join again
in sponsoring the bill. - [

ers Union, Local 586, halted pro-;
duction on Dec. 15 because of
poor ventilation and unsafe con-
ditions.

The immediate cause of the ,
work stoppage was the failure ‘
of the company to heed an order
of the state mine inspector ban-
ning any further work in two
stopes until they had been prop: 
erly barred down. After the fin? _ ‘
spector left, the company, in di-
rect violation of his order, called A
for work to be resumed in the’
stopesat the next shift. _

Inadequate _ ventilation‘ h a 5
been a sore point at the mine‘-
for some time. The major diffi-
culty stems from thefailure of
the ventilation system to prevent
excessive accumulations of ex-
haust gases from diesel trans-
loaders used underground in the
mine. Local 586 has contended
that the problem will not be
solved until ventilation raises
are driven up to the surface and
exhaust fans installed.

The company and the ‘union
met after the one-day stoppage
and arranged for an inspection
of the mine on Dec. 21. Local 586 p ; , ,
members making the inspection. '
were Paul Gonzales, chairman
of the Christmas grievance com-

Locals 863

and 870  

Win Vacation Battle

A demand of several years’ standing for four weeks
of vacation by members of Mine—Mill Locals 863 and 870
at Charleston and Savannah, Ga. was met this year by
the American Agricultural and Chemical Company in a
new two-year contract ratified at the end of November.

In addition to across-the-board wage increases of
five cents an hour for the first year and four cents an
hour in the second, the settlement provides for the up-
grading of several job classifications by two to five cents
per hour. About a quarter of the workers are affected

by the reclassifications.

Vacations were improved so that employees will
get one week after one year, two weeks after three, three
weeks after 15, and four weeks after 25 years of service-.

Prior to being organized by the
union, employees at the two
plants had received no paid va-
cation time at all.

Bargaining Chairman
Sidney McCants chaired the

Local 863 negotiating commit-

tee, while Elliott Demery
headed the Local 870 bargain-
ing group. International Repre-
sentative Jesse G. Doster, who
credited the union’s research
department with providing in-
formation wh ich moved the
company on the question of the
four weeks’ vacation, assisted
in the sessions, which began
back in September.

Under terms of the new con-
tract, the company will sup-
plement the jury duty pay of a
worker for up to 15 days per
year, so that he need, not lose
any pay if called to serve. Two

weeks service in the armed
forces reserves will also be paid
for by the company.
Employees will now have
seven paid holidays per year.‘
American Agricultural _ a nd
Chemical will provide meal a'l-

- lowances and pay for the time

taken to eat for any employee
who is asked to work overtime
for two or more hours.

. The sickness and accident
benefits are. improved at the
Charleston plant, which em-
ploys some 275 workers. About
425 employees at the Savannah
property are covered by the
new contract.

Vice-President Henry Myers
and J. Singleton also served on

mittee, while Ed McKine and

Although the Office of Emergency Planning, the stockpile policy agency, said

, that further details on how the metal will be released will not be announced until a

. later date, the copper will be available for domestic consumption only and will be sold
at the so—called “producers’ price,” which now stands at 34 cents‘ per pound.

The action appeared an effort to head off an earlier proposal by Senate Major-

ity Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana calling for 100,000 tons of copper to be loaned,

‘i rather than sold, to producers. Mansfield’s idea, supportedgby Montana’s other Dem-

ocratic Senator, Lee Metcalf, would require producers to pay interest on the value of

A the copper until it was returned

within a year after the loan was
 transacted. , V

1 ' " The Majority Leader had said
that he would seek prompt Con-
gressional authorization for his
plan when the Congress con-
venes in January.

Stabilized Employment

On Dec. 11, the International
Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter
Workers announced its support
of the Mansfield proposal, say-
ing that the transaction “would

‘contribute to employment sta-
- bility in an industry which is
now operating at capacity.”

International President A. C.
Skinner, in a statement released
to the press, called on President
Johnson and the 89th Congress

-- to give prompt and favorable
consideration to Mansfield’s pro-
posal, calling it “a promising
approach to evening out‘ the
boom and bust cycles that have

* led to instability of employment
in the industry in the past.”

The union said that the plan
“would also contribute impor-
tantly to government policies de-
signed to discourage general
price inflation,’,’ would contrib-
ute to price stability in copper
and thus lessen the threat of sub-

stitution of other materials. “In
the long run,” maintained Skin-

‘ ner, “it would promote in-
creased use of copper.”

The necessity for producers

 to replace the copper in the
 stockpile would assure continued

1 employment, said Mine- Mill,

. which always in the past has op-
posed the sale of stockpiled cop-
per on the grounds that layoffs

imight ensue. Skinner said that
Mine-Mill had been assured that

. the loan of -copper from the

. ‘stockpile at this time would not
result’_ in any layoffs, and that
the union’s own analysis of the

resent situation reinforced that
view. -

_ Prices Up to 65 Cents

_ Some 15 percent of newly
’ A mined copper and much refined
scrap copper is being sold at
premium prices ranging from
‘ * 45 to 65 cents per pound, while
’ the “producers’ price” remains
. at 34 cents—a hike from the 31
cents per pound price it had
sold for from May, 1961 until

— early this year. -
-The tight supply of the metal,
and the resulting premium
1 prices being paid, threaten to
eeventually drive the producers’
fpriceup, the union pointed out.
. In a Dec. 15 editorial, Ameri-
_ -scan Metal Market, an industry
publication, called for the re-
lease of copper to the economy

 
  
 

f  it could be spared from na-‘

‘ tional defense ‘needs. It opposed

Mansfield’s proposal that the

metal be loaned, labeling it a

.“step towards a totally planned

DEC 1 I 1960

I am in receipt of your letter of November 30, 1961+, making reference

to my last letter to you of May 6, 1961;, regarding the status of

departmental reports to the Congress on the Metcalf-Montoya. mine safety -.
bills (s. 19149 and H. R. 7812) and our proposed bill which is intended :
to carry out the recommendations made in my report to the Congress ' ' V‘
entitled "Health and Safety Study of.Meta.l and Non-Metal Mines".

Dear Mr. Dichter:

In my May 6 letter I advised that we had submitted our proposed reports
on the bills and our proposed bill to the Bureau of the Budget and that
recommendations from several governmental departments to the Budget
Bureau concerning our proposed ‘bill had to be given the most careful
consideration by the Bureau and this Department and this was occasioning
delay in obtaining prompt clearance. Subsequently another department
submitted a. suggested amendment which caused further delay.

we have just completed a conference with the Bureau of the Budget people
and feel assured that the problems and difficulties concerning the
proposed bill have been satisfactorily resolved. We have the revised
proposed bill and related papers ready for transmittal to the Bureau and
we will urgeithat clearance be expedited for submission to the Congress
as rapidly as possible. 0

It is our intention to recommend enactment of our proposed bill in lieu
of S. 1919 and H. R. 7812. _ , .

Your continued interest in this matter is greatly appreciated.
Sincerely yours,

Triple Damages

Under the law, the federal 0

for actual damages, while other ’
victims of the monopolistic '
practices could sue for triple’

damages under the Clayton _

pany estimated "it might pay
some $75 million to ‘antitrust

ACLU  Files Brief Supporting

the MiN:L‘MiLi:'lsuN|oN

Reversal of Holfa’s Conviction

Oral arguments on Teamsters Union President James R. Hoffa’s appeal of a jury
tampering conviction were heard by the Sixth Circuit U. S. Court of Appeals in Cm-

or in several months.

- cinnati, Ohio on Dec. 14. The court’s decision could be handed down in a few weeks

A month earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union had entered the case, filing
an amicus curiae or “friend-of-the-court” brief which urged reversal of the conviction.
On March 4 in Chattanooga, Tenn., Hoffa was convicted of trying to bribe a jury
which heard his trial on conspiracy charges in Nashville, Tenn. in 1962—a trial which
resulted in a hung jury. The leader of the nation’s largest union, which again in
1964 led all others in organizing new properties, was sentenced to an eight-year prison

term and a fine of $10,000.

The ACLU, a nationwide organization devoted exclusively to the protection and
expansion of constitutionally protected rights, said that Hoffa had been denied a fair
trial in Chattanooga, charging that the government illegally used evidence supplied
by an informer who spied on Hoffa and his attorneys. The brief maintains that the

due process clause of the Fifth
Amendment and the right to
counsel provision of the Sixth
Amendment of the U. S. Consti-
tution were violated. '

Use of Informer

The ACLU brief, prepared by
Osmond K. Frenkel, its general
counsel, and Melvin L. Wulf, its
legal director, said that Edward
Grady Partin, one of the prose-
cution’s chief witnesses, was in

‘fact a government informer.

“In sum,” contends the brief,
“it seems clear that Partin,
himself in trouble with the au-
thorities, evidently believed he
could obtain some benefits by
working with them, and that
when he let them know he was
going to be with Hoffa at the
Nashville trial the Department
of Justice took the opportunity
to have him keep them in-
formed of what he learned. For
this it would appear payments
were later made to Partin’s
wife. While it may be true, as
the‘ prosecution at Chattanooga
claimed, that the government

’had not sent Partin there in the

first place, befo-re he went he
had agreed to become an in-
former. That circumstance dif-
ferentiates this case from that
of a person who is already in
another’s confidence advising
the authorities that he has ob-

tained evidence incriminating.

James R. Hoffa

the other and then being asked
to stay on.”

Partin was a Teamsters local
union official.

The brief supported its con-
clusion with several Supreme
Court decisions, and also said
“that information obtained as
the result of the planting of Par-
tin as a government, informer
should not be available at any
subsequent trial.” “Any other
result would permit the gov-

ernment to benefit by its own 6

HELENA, Mont.—The Mon-
tana Mine-Mill Legislative Coun-
cil, which achieved notable suc-
cess in helping to elect its en-
dorsed candidates in November,
met here on Dec. 11 to discuss
several bills that it hopes to
have introduced when the legis-
lature convenes on Jan. 4.
Charles Huppe, the union’s lo-
cal attorney, attended the meet-
ing and was called upon to draft
the proposed legislation.

‘The Council, which represents
six locals throughout the state,
will concentrate on attempting
to improve the workmen’s com-
pensation and occupational dis-
ease laws in Montana, and will
support AFL-CIO proposals to
beef up the unemployment com-
pensation payments.

Pulmonary emphysema should
be included in the occupational
disease law and the period of
eligibility for workmen’s com-
pensation payments should be
increased, the Council believes.

With the Democrats taking
over control of the state House
of Representatives, by a 56 to
38 margin, and retaining con-
trol of the Senate, chances for
bettering the coverage of the
above laws look brighter. The
party platform pledges improve-
ment‘ in all three areas.

Collar to Collar

The Mine-Mill Council will al-
so seek legislation which would
require eight-hour collar to col-
lar pay for all underground
workers in the state—that is, re-
quire the workers to be paid
from the time they enter the
mine shaft until they leave it,
rather, than between the times
they reach and leave the work-
ing face.

Another discussion centered

, Mine-Mill Council Prepares for 1965

on the possibility of having leg-
islation introduced which would
make the position of state mine
inspector an elective rather than
appointive office. The present
inspector, Nathan May, at a sal-
ary of $6,200 a year, is the sec-

ond lowest paid state mine in-.

spector in the country. Montana
is also one of two states which
does not provide a staff for its
mine inspector. ‘

A subcommittee was named
by the Council which will at-
tempt to set up a meeting with
Republican Governor Tim Bab-
cock and discuss with him the
legislative interests of the union.

wrongdoing,” maintained the

ACLU.
Only Partin Incident

Although other government ir-
regularities have been charged
regarding the trial, the ACLU
brief concerned itself “solely
with the Partin inciden .”

Hoffa’s attorney, in a 207-page
brief filed in October, stated
that 16 broad categories of pre-
judicial errors were made by
the trial judge and also in fed-
eral grand jury proceedings
prior to the trial.

Hoffa is free on bond pending
the outcome of the court appeal.

Despite its president’s legal
troubles, the union participated
in more than 30 percent of all
NLRB representative elections
during the first eight months of
1964. According to National La-

bor Relations Board records, the’

Teamsters’ organizing activities
topped those of every other la-
bor organization.

cvn£nmmon——
Golden Promise or Bark Threat?

by A. C. Skinner

International President ,

HOSE WHO may have wondered why our union put so much
emphasis on job security, protection against layoffs, and
severance pay in 1964 contract negotiations should read a recent
report by the Research Institute of America. This is a firm in
New York operating as business consultants. They are experts on
automation. Over a year ago, they said: “The moment of truth

on automation is coming a lot sooner than most people realize. .

The shattering fact is that the United States is almost totally un-
prepared for the approaching crisis.”

A Rand Corporation computer expert, Richard Bellman, esti- .

mates that in the discernable future “2% of the population will,
with the aid of automated production, be able to produce all the
goods and services needed to feed, clothe and run our society.”

What About Jobs for the Rest?

The obvious question is “What will the other 98% of the people
be doing?” That’s a good question and I challenge you to find a
business leader or engineering genius that can answer it. '

The human race is unpredictable. Weare smart enough to in-
vent machines to eliminate our jobs and invent atomic bombs to
eliminate people. But we can’t seem to find a way to use automa-
tion and atomic energy to make a betterlife for everyone. It
can, you know. Wealth produced by machines is still wealth. If
it is properly distributed among all the people, we can achieve
what President Johnson calls “the Great Society.” ’

***

OU NEVER HEARD the word “cybernation” before? Neither

did I until a few weeks ago. We'll hear a lot more about it in
the future. Automation is the use of machines which do the work
of men. They .don’t need people to operate 6
them. But even automated machines need re-
pair, adjustment, and servicing by men. But
with cybernation you don’t need men for these
tasks either.

A cybernated plant is one in which all the
automatic machines are controlled by self-ad-
justing, self-inspecting, self-repairing, and self-
correcting computers. An example: The Inter-‘
national Teamster magazine reports that Sara
Lee Bakeries recently opened a big‘ new
“cybernated plant” near Chicago. This ‘big
automated bakery is full of machinery and
compute-rs but no bake-rs——in fact, no people at
all. It mixes, bakes, frosts, wraps,,’and_box'es,
pastry and

Skinner C

cakes—all

strikes. Of course, they have people in the office and it takes‘ truck
drive-rs to deliver to the stores, but no one bakes the cakes‘ any
more.

This is only an isolated example of a_ trend just beginning in *

American industry. Multiply this cybernated’ bakery ten thousand
times in the next 10 years in every major manufacturing plant,
steel mill and smelter and it’s not difficult to see the problem we

will face. *~ * *
F WE HAVE five to six‘ million unemployed people today, what

will that figure be 10 or 15 years from now, after automation ’

and cybernation take over production in America? Such a calamity

must not be allowed to happen. For if it does, the era of “the

Great Society” will have become the time of “the Great.Tragedy”
for millions and millions of people—not only in the United States,
but in every industrial country in the world. The effect of auto-
mation upon the economy and the people is rapidly approaching
the “crisis” referred to in the Research llnstitute report. We must
face up to this “crisis”~—today or face economic chaos tomorrow.

What Can Be Done?

In an economy of abundance, where human labor is a
diminishing requirement to produce goods, We can sustain all citi-
zens in economic security and a good life if we learn how to dis-
tribute this abundance equitably. It will not be easy to make this

adjustment! It will not be easy to" accept the fact that people‘

should live in comfort and decency without a full-time job!

It will take the best brains and most dedicated leaders in
government, economics, labor, and business to resolve this prob-
lem. Yes, even big business leaders must very soon become con-

cerned. They may be making big profits now fromrapidlyin-.
creasing production, but after they eliminate most of the jobs _

who will buy the -products from their automated plants? Govern-
ment leaders, economists, and union leaders must start now to
address themselves to this problem, and the sooner the better.‘

A good start would be the reduction of retirement age, im-~-L ».

provement of retirement pay, and the shorter work week. It’s la.ter
than we think! ‘ '

THE MINE-MILL UNION

‘BrassGroup’ Holds Weekly
Meetings to Cure an Illness

BUFFALO, N. Y.——“Would it surprise you to know,” Clarence Blunt began a _

Dec.‘ 1 letter to all Anaconda American Brass Company employees and their families,
“that over 5 million people in the United States have serious problems due to exces-

sive drinking?”

It doesn’t surprise Blunt, a member of Mine-Mill Local 593. He’s been there . . .
and back. And he’s now devoting a great amount of time and energy to helping
others with the same problem.

Now 52 years old, Blunt works in the tube mill of the Buffalo plant. He has
been with the company for 26 years. Some 10 years ago, however, Blunt was fired
because of alcoholism. It wasn’t a new problem; it had been -with him for years. His
release finally led him to seek help, and he joined Alcoholics Anonymous. The road
back to health wasn’t an easy one, but two years later

union’s help, won back his job
and his seniority. He today
heads the “Brass Group” of AA,
which meets every Monday aft-
ernoon in the locker room of
the main office building’s base-
ment.

In recent months, Local 593

has won back jobs for two other
members who had been fired
for the same reason.
I —Both the union and the com-
pany have endorsed the AA
program at the plant, but only
those workers with a drinking
problem are allowed to attend
meetings. Blunt occasionally re-
ports its progress at a general
membership meeting.

“Alcoholism is a disease,”
maintains Blunt, “and should be
treated as such.”

Needed: Understanding -

“Don’t say to the compulsive

- drinker, ‘It’s your own fault,’ ”

he said in the mimeographed
letter he mailed to some 850‘
families to acquaint them with
the disease and its cure, “It’s
not that simple. .It’s a creep-
ing, progressive thing, that
comes on them over the years.
The, way to help a friend, rela-
tive, or fellow worker with this

. problem is to understand it.”

The letter presents a vivid
description of the-. reasons for
excessive drinking; the difficul-
ties one faces in trying to stop,

broken homes, lost jobs, dis-

Blunt also explains the tech-
niques of AA, which, he says,
has helped over 350,000 persons
—the way in which you can
keep your mind off your trou-
bles by worrying about some-
body else’s.

“This is group therapy,” says
Blunt, “and it works.” ‘

California Situation
Alcoholism is undoubtedly one
of the nation’s most disabling
diseases. The State Department
of Public Health in California,
for example, estimates the to-
tal number of alcoholics in that

state alone at over 885,000.

In San Francisco, which has
the highest rate of alcoholism
in the country, some $31 million
a year is lost to industry through
absenteeism. .

Several locals of the Interna-
tional Longshoremen’s and
Warehousemen’s U n i o n have
long been concerned with the
problem, and the trustees of the
ILWU-Pacific Maritime Asso-
ciation Welfare fund are con-
sidering adding treatment for
acute alcoholism to the prepaid
health benefits of the jointly
administered longshore plan.

The State Assembly in that
state also has a Subcommittee

‘ on Alcoholism Studies.

At the AABC plant in Buffalo.

Blunt is waging a one-man cru-
sade against the disease .
and he’s. having a fair amount
of success.

At San Manuel Local

SAN MANUEL, .,Ariz.—Since
the Magma Unity Council set-
tled a new three-year contract
with the Magma Copper Com-
pany in September, Mine-Mill
Local 937 has grown substantial-
ly in membership. Two divisions
of the San Manuel Copper Com-
pany, a subsidiary of Magma
Copper, recently hit the 100 per-
cent mark in union membership.

H. Erwin and I. Rea, vice-
presidents of the mechanical
and construction divisions re-
spectively, have signed up all
workers in their areas.

The new contract, which in-
cluded 21 cents in general wage
increases plus increments and
substantial fringe benefits, also
improved the system of pro-
motions, thus bringing new op-
portunities to the employees in
both divisions, which consist pri-
marily of pipefitters, carpen-
ters, helpers, and laborers;

The Magma Unity Council is
made up of 12 local unions in-
cluding Mine-Mill Locals 937

Tesfof Liberal Strength in Congress
Due Soon onkules ReformQuesiion

“The Congress of the United States,” says the national Democratic party platform of 1964, “should revise
its rules and procedures to assure majority rule after reasonable debateand to guarantee that major legislative

C I“ proposals of the President can be brought to a vote after reasonable consideration incommittee.”
By picking up 38 seats in the House of Representatives, Democrats will control both houses of the 89th Con— T

gress by better than two to one margins——295 to 140 in the House, 68 to 32 in the Senate. With close to 5.0 mem-

. ’ bers of the Republican-Southern Democrat coalition in the House being dragged down to defeat with Senator Gold-
'water, liberal Democrats are in their best position since 1986 to push through a program. ‘ A V - —

How far-reaching that program can be depends in large measure on how far the liberals are able to go in the
..-area of Congressional reform, on what interpretation the party places on its unspelled out platform plank quoted
above. Four years ago, the party pledged “to improve Congressional procedures so that majority rule prevails.” The
1964 platform points out that, in 1961, the House Rules Committee was enlarged from'12 to 15 members, “mak-

ing it more representative of
the views of the majority,” and

~‘ that, in 1964, for the first time

in history, the Senate voted to
limit debate on a civil rights
measure, invoking cloture so
that the civil rights bill could
be brought to a vote and passed.

These were limited gains in-

.deed. Knowing the voting

other sides by India, this rugged hill country on the slopes of the. Himalayas has only recently opened up to the
outside world through the construction of new roads and air travel.
The site of Mt. Everest, at 29,028 feet, the highest mountain in the World, Nepal has 54,362 square miles and
about 10,000,000 people, most of whom are Hindus or Buddhists. _
On Feb. 12, 1959, the country’s first democratic constitution was proclaimed by King Mahendra, and a cabi-
net and two-house parliament was established. The nation, which exports jute, rice, grain, cattle, hides, and drugs,
is now receiving financial assistance from the United States, India, Australia, China, and the U.S.S.R.
Change is coming slowly to Nepal, but most villagers live as they have for centuries——in isolation and poverty.

Two known copper mines are
operating in the country, and
in a more primitive manner
than the European mines of 500
years ago. _

Using home-made tools and
working by hand, the Nepalese
burrow into the hillsides, dig-
ging tunnels generally about
two feet wide and two to three
feet high. The wo-rk is ca_rried
out haphazardly, either explor-
ing or following the ore en-
countered, so that the tunnels
twist, turn, rise and fall in an
unsystematic manner.

cramped Quarters

Working conditions are appall-
ing._ Miners at the working
face have no ventilation, and,
cramped and stripped, they
work by the light of small
bamboo torches. With tempera-
tures up to 90 degrees F., they
wield hammers, small pointed
chisels, and short-handled picks.
There is no room for sledge-
hammers or crowbars.

With these tools, made from
locally-produced soft iron, they
break out ore and rock at a,
cost in effort and labor that
Westerners would find unbeliev-

able. The miners continue work-'

ing. until the oxygen gets so de-
pleted. that the torches go out.
This lack of ventilation imposes
a limit on the length of the tun-
nels; few of them are longer
than 300 feet.

The miners know about the
use-of explosives, but are afraid
to use them. Considering. the
light timbering, the instability
of the rock, andithe poor ventila-
tion, their fears are well justi-
fied.

The ore and rock are loaded
in reed skid baskets, which
weigh 60 to 80 pounds when full.
They are dragged out by boys,
aged 12 to 15, running backward
through the unlighted tunnels.

Because of malnutrition and/or.
internal parasites, many of the .

boys are small for their age.
The crushing and concentrat-
ing of the ore is usually done by

the wives or widows of miners
and their unmarried daughters;
“Primary crushing” is done
with iron hammers and the ore
is upgraded by throwing out the
Stone ham-
mers accomplish the secondary
crushing, which is a spare-time
activity of the entire family.
The ore is then screened
through baskets. The harder
ore is tackled with the “big
hammer”—an 18-pound chunk of
shaped, hard rock, swung with
full force on piles of dampened
ore. .

......n.1-. '  . , «.-

The ore is next washed in
clay-linedstone troughs by men
and women who agitate "the ore
and move it upward by hand
against the flow. The low-grade
material moves to the lower

end and theheavier, high-grade.

material toward the upper end.
The workers use great skill in
this operation in an effort to
minimize losses, but they are
still high.

The washed ore concentrate
is then‘ turned over to the
smelters, a group of hereditary
blacksmiths, who, as members
of an.,“untouchable” caste, are
subject to much discrimination
and contempt. The smelters re-
taliate by zealously guarding
the secrets of their craft, and
thus becoming indispensable to
the community. While their
knowledge appears to be mostly
empirical, they seem to have a
rudimentary theoretical under-
standing of the process and a
high level of skill.

Smelﬁng Process

Most ofthe ore is chalcopy-
rite, so the smelters have de-
veloped a two-stage process in
which the ore is first smelted
to a sulfide matte. The matte
is ground to fine powder, mixed
with cow dung, and formed into
balls about three inches in di-
ameter. The dung, used as a
binder, holds the shape of the
balls during roasting in a pile.

All the steps in smelting are
controlled by the God of Copper,
Mahadev. The use of cowdung,
which like the animal is sacred,
is sanctioned by Mahadev.

The roasted matte is smelted
in the furnace previously used
for the first stage. As air is sup-
plied through clay tuyeres by
goatskin bellows, roasted matte
and charcoal are added alter-
nately, with a few pieces of
quartz being added at intervals
to flux the iron. The usual batch
yields from three to five pounds
of copper.

When smelting is completed,
blowing is discontinued and the
tuyeres disconnected. The
smelters quickly rake the un-
burnt charcoal off ‘the molten

‘pool of slag and ‘copper, and

CONCENTRATION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY AGITATING the ore by hand in a carefully
regulated stream of water. Tailings are gradually moved

to the "rear and the heavy

splash water on the slag..As it
cools, they pry off each layer-
usually five in all. The first
three‘ layers are discarded. The
last two, containing some cop-
per, may be re-cycled.

When they have removed the
last of the slag, the smelters
cool ‘the cake of crude copper
and remove it from the furnace.
The cake, resembling blister
copper, is resmelted repeatedly
in a charcoal forge until it is
ductile enough to be fabricated.

Copper pots and utensils are
in great demand in Nepal. They
are fabricated by the black-
smith-smelters, using the crud-
est tools and equipment, and
their work shows a high level of
skill and competence.

BaHIeonHUAC Scheduled
At Opening of 89th Congress

‘Since Congress does not change its rules except at the opening of a new session,
an attack on the House Un-American Activities Committee will be launched in the
first few days of the 89th Congress, which ‘convenes on Jan’. 4. A

Twenty Congressmen who went on record during the 88th Congress in opposition

- to the committee, which was established as a standing committee 20 years ago on a
1 motion by John Rankin of Mississippi, are expected to lead the 1965 abolition fight. Sev-
eral factors indicate that the anti-HUAC vote this time may be substantially increased
, over’ past attempts to abolishor severely limit the committee.

Most important of these, perhaps, was the complete devastation in the 1964 elec-
tions of the old belief that an anti-HUAC vote meant political suicide. Not only were all
of the committee's critics re-elected by surprisingly large majorities, but three mem-
bers of the nine-man committee were defeated. Spokesmen for the National Commit-

tee to Abolish HUAC believed

.that from 120 to 150 members
,of the 88th Congress were pri-

vately sympathetic to attempts
to curtail the committee. The
results of the November vote,
they maintain, should cause
many Congressmen to translate
their private doubts about this

committee into vocal opposition.

The election, of course, also
added some 50 new members to
the House of Representatives-
most of them considered rather
liberal Democrats. Some
attacked HUAC during the
course of their campaigns.

Civil Rights Groups

Another factor in the‘ anti-
HUAC battle is the increased

hostility to the committee by

civil rights organizations work-

 on voter registration and

{other projects in the South, and
{by the‘ civil rights movement

ggenerally. Many of the attacks
» Efojn these groups and the charges

that they are “subversive” are
based on hearsay information
that has been leaked from the
§;HUAC files to the anti-civil
rights organizations.

"Anne Braden deals with this

. subject in a small, but powerful

pamphlet entitled “HUAC: Bul-
wark of Segregation,” some
130,000 copies of which have

been distributed around the_

country. .

_i In another development, 100
of the country's foremost au-
thorities on the Constitution
have sponsored a petition call-
ing for an end to HUAC. The
late Alexander Meiklejohn, a
winner of the Presidential
Medal of Freedom and an hon-
orary_ chairman of the National
Committee to Abolish HUAC,
and Thomas I. Emerson, pro-
fessor of law at Yale University
Law School, initiated the proj-
ect. Some of the signers include
-Thurman Arnold, -a former
assistant U. S. attorney general
and associate justice of the U. S.
Court of Appeals in Washington,
D.C.; Hem*y Steele Commager,
professor of history at-Columbia
University and Amherst Col-
lege; and Robert M. Hutchins,
former president of the Univer-
sity of Chicago, new president
ofthe Center for the Study of
Democratic Institutions.

"Ul'l'ima‘l'e Lack of Fciith"

Saying that HUAC “serves no
useful purpose” and pointing out
that the few bills it considers
each year all fall within the
jurisdiction of other commit-
tees, the petition states: “There
are serious problems confront-
ing us, but the human and na-
tural resources in this country
are surely adequate to the task.

.What is needed is an opportu-

nity to permit our democratic
institutions to function as they
are meant to do, with new and
unorthodox ideas welcomed but
subject to full and free discus-
sion. The maintenance of a
legislative committee to restrict
this process betrays an ultimate
lack of faith in a democratic
society.”

The methods of the commit-
tee, according to the lawyers,
professors, and historians, have
been unfair and its actual oper-
ation “h‘as wrought much

‘, harm." They suggest that the
b.IjIUAC files, “containing miscel-

laneous ‘and often inaccurate
data about millions of Ameri-
cans,” be transferred to the

Archives, not to be open for’
official or public inspection ‘for '

50 years.

In separate action, 36 promi-
nent American clergymen
mailed an appeal to many of
their pastor colleagues across
the country,’ urging them to de-
vote their sermons on Jan. 3 to
the Bill of Rights and the pres-
ervation » of an open society.
“We have allowed individual
liberties to erode,”- said the
ministers, who include Rev.
Martin Luther King, Jr., and
Rev. Ralph Abernathy of the

Southern ‘Christian Leadership /

Conference, Rev. Eugene Car-

son Blake of the United Presby-
terian Church, Rt. Rev. James
A. Pike, Episcopal Bishop of
California, and Dr. Lewis Web-
ster-Jones, president of the Na-
tional Council of Christians and
Jews.

“Those legislative investigat-

-ing committees of the Congress

which impede individual liber-
ties are prime exemplars of
this process,” said the clergy-
men, who continued: “They
perpetuate the atmosphere of
McCarthyism. They have ex-
tended the power of our federal
legislature into spheres of re-
ligion, speech, press, assembly,
and petition, expressly forbid-
den to Congressional incursion

Parker White Metal Workers’ Union, Local 711. In 1961, all facilities of the company, formerly located in Erie, were

moved _to the new plant at Fairview. Parker White is one of the leading, U.S. producers of precision die castings from
aluminum, zinc and tin—lead base alloys, and powdered metal pressings from iron, steel, copper, bronze, nickel and
silver. The company was founded in 1906 by the late William A. Parker and is controlled by his family. Its products’ are

Upgrading and Hiring at Bingham Pit

Kennecott’s Bingham pit in Utah has been upgrading employees
into new jobs as drivers of giant diesel trucks, shovel operators,
dozer and road grader operators, as well as maintenance personnel.
The new jobs result from replacement of track haulage in the upper
part of the pit by truck haulage and from the program for removal
of overburden. Upgradinghas created vacancies among trackmen
and brakemen, and about 270 new employees will have been hired
by January 1, bringing employment at the pit to 2,672 from 2,400
three months ago. ' ’

‘ ‘ Lead Jumps Another'Penny
The price of lead was boosted by one cent to 16 cents per pound
Dec. 10 by U. S. Smelting, Refining and Mining Company. Other
U. S. producers fell in line with the price hike, the following day.
U. S. smelters were reluctant to boost the price, fearing that lead

users would be prompted to seek substitutes for lead.
At the same time, smelters here have been having difficulty

1800 Workers Locke-d0ut by
AS&R Australian Subsidiary

Mt. Isa Mines, Australian subsidiary of American
Smelting and Refining Company, discharged 230 under-
ground miners and locked out 1,800 other workers in
mid-December. . 6 

The lockout was the latest development in a smold-
ering dispute between the company and union which
-began last summer. Originally at issue was the contract
andrpiecework setup. Failing to reach agreement, under-
ground mine-rs reverted to hourly rates ' last August,
which resulted in a production cut of 20 percent.’

The reduced production of ore was insufficient to
permit economical operation of the Mt. Isa copper smelter,
which was closed in mid-November.‘ Mine production
was continued, with ore being

  

stockpiled. This shut off two-

thirds of Australian copper pro-
duction and led the government
to impose ‘an embargo on copper
exports as an emergency meas-
ure.

Altogether, from August to
early December, more than 1,200
men quit the employ of the
company and left the desolate
area on Australia’s northeastern
coast where the mines are lo-
cated. ,

Govt. Intervention

On Dec. 10 the Queensland
provincial government got in on
.the'ac_t with an emergency de-

’ ’ cree ordering miners to go back

to the disputed contract and
piecework rates. The Australian
Council of Trade Unions prompt-
ly denounced the high-handed
intervention of‘ the provincial
-government in the labor ‘dispute

  as industrial conscription. -The

council called for lifting of the
order and resumption of collec-
tive ‘bargaining. The miners vot-
ed not to go back to work on
contract, and this was followed
by the mass firings and lockout.

Mt. Isa in 1963 produced near-
ly 60,000 tons each of lead and
zinc, over 65,000 tons of copper,
and 5 million ounces of silver.
American Smelting and Refining
Company acquired its first in-
terest in Mt. Isa in 1930_and now
owns 53.7 percent controlling in-
terest. AS&R paid a total of $12,-
603,022 for its -share in Mt. Isa,
which had a current market
value on December 31, 1963 of
$196,626,700. “

The value of AS&R’s invest-
ment is thus more than 15 times
what the company put into it. In
1963, Mt. Isa paid AS&R $2;851,-
200 in dividends. ‘

in buying foreign ores and concentrates because European smelters
recently have based their offers for concentrates on the higher
prices prevailing in London—most recently reported at 181/2 cents
per pound. Some observers in industry circles are reported to feel
that the recent one-cent increase will not be enough to enable U. S.
smelters to compete effectively for foreign concentrates.

New $4 Million Plant to Employ 40

Arizona is slated to have its first copper refining and fabricat-
ing plant. A $4 million plant is scheduled to be built in 1965 at the
Bagdad mine site by Arizona Chemcopper Co., a jointly-owned
subsidiary of Bagdad Copper Companyand Chemetals Corp. of
New York. - g y

Planned capacity of the plant is 8,250 tons of copper per-year.
The plant will be highly automated and is expected to employa
maximum of 40 men. The plant will be unique in that it will produce
copper by _chemically treating cement copper, which is produced

‘by the leaching of oxide ores at Bagdad. The new process elimin-

ates traditional ‘smelting and electrolytic refining of copper. It is
expected to be a much lower cost operation than the traditional
method, and will produce a copper powder of purity ‘equal to or
higher than electro-copper. When melted,_ the powder will be
oxygen-free. Fabrication initially will be confined to‘ hearing parts
and friction material.’ Later the copper powder will be converted
directly into tubing and strip. j ‘ :

Possible New Find in Timmins Area

Timmins, Ontario is in the news again with a renewed out-
burst of mining fever. Mc_Watters Gold Mines, a small outfit, re-
ports it has turned -up in one bore hole southeast of Timmins 295
feet averaging 1.24 percent nickel. Whether the company has dis-
covered a large new nickel orebody will depend on drilling of
many more holes. The report itself, however, was enough to touch
off another wave of heavy buying of low-priced shares on the
Toronto Stock Exchange in companies in the Timmins area.

Skyrocketing Prices Reopens

Mercury Mines

Mercury is now quoted at $490-$505 per 76-pound flask, com-
pared with $192 a year ago. Rising demand for mercury and large
Soviet purchases of the heavy metal in Europe have contributed
to the rise in prices. Many formerly inactive mercury mines are
coming back into production, including Sonoma International at
Guerneville, Calif. and Bretz Mining Company in Oregon.

Sales of UNICEF Christmas
cards were up some 35 percent
this year compared to a year ago
despite the fact that the John

of the cards “another case of
surrendering to the Communist-

Volunteers who were selling
the cards in branches of the
Bank of America were stopped
from doing so following the

that there was a general policy
against lobby solicitations, but
the bank itself placed a,_ huge
$1,000 order for them.

lig Has Highest Injury Rate

The most dangerous work in American industry today apparently is in marine cargo handling,
at least according to 1963 figures which have just been issued for the first time. For the United States
as .a whole, for that occupation, injuries per million man-hours worked averaged 80.5. This rate equals
one injury per 12,422 man-hours. If evenly distributed among the work force, an injury would be sus-
tained by each woorker once in 6.2 years (based on a 2,000-hour work year).
coast resulted in an average 116.3 injuries per million man-hours

Cargo handling along the gulf
in 1963, while the North Atlantic
- and Pacific coast rates were

70.5 and 71, respectively.
Other injury rates were as
follows:
Logging camps .................. --53.4

are available.) -._..__.;.-__-__.50.7

in U.S. Manufacturing
The U.S. Department of Labor
reports that the frequency of
work injuries in all U.S. manu-
facturing was up 6 percent in
the first six months of 1964, as

» compared with the same months
in 1963. In June 1964, the fre-

quency of accidents was 10 per-
cent higher than in June 1963.
The Department of Labor of-
fered no explanation for the
rise in work injuries.

Safety‘ Inspections

Health and safety inspections
of the Truste, East La Marche,
Canyon Creek, and Maiden Rock
phosphate mines of the Stauffer
Chemical Company in Silver
Bow county, Montana were com-
pleted in November by the U.S.
Bureau of Mines.

The Bureau repeated recom-
mendations previously made at
the Canyon Creek and East La
Marche mines that only Bureau

A of Mines-approved, diesel-

powered equipment should be
used underground. The report on
the Maiden Rock mine noted
that a diesel-powered locomo-

 tive had been taken out of ser-
‘ vice and recommended that, if

replaced, approved equipment
should be obtained. .

Safety improvements noted
and safety recommendations in
the reports were:

Maiden Rock
0 The mine should be equipped

A with a main fan, installed in
5 fireproof housing, situated pref-

erably on the surface.

Magna. Utah

Dear Verne:

Thank you so much for your letter of Decem-
ber 2nd in which you remind me of your interest_ ’

in 8. 1949, which would have extended federal
safety inspection to metallic and non-metallic

- mines.

Immediately senator Metcalf returns to wash-
ington I will talk with him about introducing
this measure again in January.

will you please report to your members that
they may count on me to do everything I can in
support of this'1egis1ation..

Union, and Mine-Mill. -

Although the Fresno conference dealt primarily‘with< 

state matters, a program for federal legislation was also

adopted. At the suggestion of Thomas McGuire, ,Min'e,
Mill international representative in attendance, fede‘r',fi_‘
mine safety legislation was added to the list of propo '
for; which the ILWU will lobby during thecoming se’

of Congress.

On the statet level, the ILWU will concentrate on 
proving three major social insurance programs——uné§m~ . “
ployment compensation, which, the delegates to the con: ‘
ference said, -should be extended to cover agricultural 
workers, state“ and local government employees, [and T

have been brought‘ into this ‘A
country each year, expires on ‘

the employees of non-profit or-
ganizations; disability ' in s u r-
ance; -and workmen’s com-

pensation. Teamster research.

man Tom Harris discussed the
problem that labor would face
in attempting to put, over such
a program, and George Zeno-
vich,”a state assemblyman from
the Fresno area; warnedpof the
methods -that would be used to
prevent advances in this area.
Zenovich, a strong supporter
of improved social insurance,
will be chairman of the ﬁnance
subcommittee in this field.
Because of arbitrary rate in-
creases and discriminatory can-
cellations and refusal to cover
certain groups and individuals,
the conference urged’ strict

V regulation of auto insurance

companies by state agencies.
The‘. union will also work to

_support the program of the Cali-

fornia Federation of Teachers
and will cooperate with the

‘American Civil "Liberties Union

and other groups inthe areas of
‘civil rights and civil liberties.
