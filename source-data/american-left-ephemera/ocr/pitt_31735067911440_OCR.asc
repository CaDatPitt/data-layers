DENVER, Colo. — Clinton Jencks,

fighting a framed-up Taft-Hartley in-
dictment, took off last week on the

-» second leg of a nationwide speaking
tour of Mine-Mill locals.

After appearances before locals in

Idaho and eastern Washington last
week, he was scheduled to speak in
Montana locals this week as follows:

E. Helena, Local 72, Monday, October

12; Deer Lodge, Local 834, Tuesday,
October 13; Butte Miners’ Union, Local

1, Wednesday, October 14; Anaconda

_- ‘ Smeltermen’s Union, Local 117, Thurs-
 day, October 15; and Great Falls Smel-
termenls Union, Local 16,‘F1-iday, Octo-

Sher 16. ' '

Jencks will speak before key ‘locals
«-of our union in/the.East and Midwest
during the rest. of October, and is
scheduled to appear; before Utah and
Nevada locals during the first week in
5 November. , y »
 I ' Earlier, Jencks _.had nﬂde a pre-
. ~ . convention swing through the South-
west, during which Mine-Mill locals in
Arizona, New Mexico and.- Texas voted
strong support for his ‘defense. The
case is due to come to trial in El Paso
,Federal District court Monday, No-
vember 30.

— Meantime, the ‘first’ printed folder
sponsored by the Jencks Defense Com-
mittee came off the presses late last
week, "and was being mailed to locals
in both United States and Canada. The
front page cartoon from the folder is
reprinted on this page.

 

The long campaign of mining com-

— panics in the Bayard, New Mexico -area

to smash Local 890 is‘ thoroughly ex-

f , ‘posed in the folder. That campaign has

been spearheaded-by New Jersey Zinc
Company:

The story istold about how Jencks’
arrest was made just a month after

. ‘Richard Berresford, employee relations
-manager for New Jersey Zinc, appeared

Wasliington to ‘demand government
-persecution of Mine-Mill leaders. .

_ In ‘his testimony before the Commit-
,[ - .-tee, Berresford demanded “legislation
 which voids the contract, which gives

' the particular‘ union no power to come

in on grievances or other such miftters.”

He added frankly that he wanted the
government “to catch the International
Representative (in the T-H affidavit

- trap)"who isiii the pay of the Inter-

thelocal, but working full time,”

THE JENCKS ST'0llY:' This cartoon from folder Issued by the International Union tells
the story of this frame-up. See’story at right.

BUFFALO, N. Y. -4- The employers
-here and their newspapers have dis-

Labor‘ 11ai1ity—ij_’s a plot

covered a new evil. It is a very serious.

evil, calling for the loudest and wildest
of red-baiting. This evil is called labor
unity. ‘"~ »

It startéd with a strike by 700 coke
oven workers at the Lackawanna plant
of Bethlehem Steel—members of the

Steelworkers Union. Their jobs are the 

dirtiest, most dangerous and lowest-,

ipaid: Many of them are Negroes. They
struck last month against a new speed-
.up, job-cutting scheme. Some 14,000
iother workers in the plant "went out
with them.

The four Mine-Mill locals here, and a

. United Auto Workers local, issued pub-
_ lic statements supporting the strike.

The,’ statement of UAW Local 501 was
approved by the Buffalo CIO Council.

You might think this was a good
move. ,Perhaps you, have voted for

-strike suport in your own local union.
, If so, you are an “impuden.t Commu-

nist-liner” in the view of the Buffalo '

Evening News. A
_You are guilty of “horning in on
labor difficulties,” of .“impudent and

gratuitous intervention.”

Joe Scioli, Mine-Mill Int’l rep. in‘

Buffalo, was referred to as a “Commu-
nist liner” who was “on the fzringes”

. of the strike.,.Terrible deeds were re-

ported by Scioli and a UE staff mem-
ber, Emanuel Fried:

“According to 'lnfo’rmatiq,n given
The News, three of the coke-oven
rworkers, including one of a’ couple of
ggtewards the company declares were
ivory active in the wildcat A walkout,
‘visited Joseph C. Scioli iifterr the walk-
out toolc place. 0 I

“They are réported to have told Mr.
Scioli . . .
Communist line, lth’a.t' they needed
‘help.’f _ \  A 2 _

Tsk, tsk.

‘ “Mr. Fried is reported to have
olgrreed to ai'd—a not inconsistent tactic
for h'i'm—-since he has been trying for

' jmonths to brringlabout unity and co-

operation of.hz's Communist-line outfit

.$.

\

- Local 758 asks that your-local union
take the following actions to. help
them, and to help save the labor move-
ment from more suc-h union-busting
injunctions: A _ ' l
_1. Adopt a resolution denouncing the
liniunction against Local 758, point-
ling out that it denies the elementary

lfreedoms. set forth in the Constitu-

ltion of the United States;

2.‘Send ‘a telegram or letter, to. the

ling quick action on a ruling to com-
lpel the Precision Scientific‘Company

with the anti;Commum'st union at the
plant of the Westinghouse Electric
Co.” »

An editorial in the same issue wound
up as follows:

“The UAW should not be proud of
v the action of one of its locals in gratu-
itously attempting to undercut the
leoidership of ii fellow CIO union. Par-
t'lcula'rly puzzling is the approvalvgiven
the Local 501 resolution by the Greater
Buffalo Industrial Union Council
(CIO).”

The Buffalo-Evem'ng News made no
such attacks against those who have
engaged in raids or other forms of
union-splitting. ,»

Union members of all affiliations are. 9

looking more and more to. labor unity
to help‘ them solve their problems.
Looks as if. the bgsses and their press
will be screaming louder and louder
about “Communist-inspired, impudent,
gratuitous” labor unity.

Us . . . we like it.

will mean important gains for the
membership here. ,

A wage increase of 71/; cents -an hour

The company agreed to important
changes affecting....cont1-act miners, in-
cluding complete itemized posting of
contract calculations and furnishing
copies of the measurements in work
places to contract crews prior to cal-
culations. Processing‘ of grievances on
contract mining will be greatly bene-
fitted. ' if

Reclassification of some mill work-

.ers and higher contract prices for

hoisted timber will mean bigger pay
checks for some of the workers.

A major gain was the incorporation
of a strong seniority clapse in the con-
tract—something the company had re-
fused to yield in previous years.

BAYARD, N. %M.——Kennecott work-
ers here have been off the job for two

‘weeks, respecting the picket lines of a

small striking local" of the Int’l Ass’n
of Machinists. , i V
The IAM local is striking for a retro-

active wage increase date the same as

that of Local 890,'Mine-Mill.

It is the general opinion here that
the IAM could have’ had what they are
asking without a (strike, had they been
willing last year to work more closely
with Local 890. It is hoped that in the
future they will do so.

President Juan Chacon and other,

leaders of Local 890 have issued‘state-
ments of full support to the IAM
strike, and offers ‘of help, in addition
to the respecting of picket lines.
Meanwhile, more workers‘ in this
area were thrown out of work when
the U. S. Smelting, Refining. & Mining
Companyclosed its operations because
of the low price of zinc. Workers at
this property, in ‘alocal “independent”
union, took a wage cut, presumably so
the company could “afford” to continue
operations.

year.

“We can win this ‘strike without any‘
question, if we just have financial sup-
port from the other locals,” said Joe
Benny Martinez, president," and Andy A
Pacheco, financial secretary. They‘
pointed out that many merchants hero ..
cut off credit a month before the strike
opened, so for many of the members. it
is the same as if the strike had been
going for 10 weeks instead of six.

Contributions have come from locals
in District 1, including more than $300
from Local 557 in Denver, and from
the International Union strike fund.-1‘
Int’l rep. Leo Ortiz pointed out that
this was the only local in the Interna-

VANCOUVER, B. C. — The copper
conference of the British Columbia Dis-

of ten cents across the board, plus an-
other ten cents to be applied on wel-
fare, and the 40-hour week, Monday to
Friday, as objectives for this year’s
copper negotiations. _ '

Held on August 24 in Copper Moun-
tain, home camp of Local 649, the gen-
eral bargaining situation in this pro-

demands were -based on the worsening

well as on the necessity of shorter

7 7 To the Editor: ‘‘ ‘ .

*‘ The following are some of my obser-
vations with respect to the problems
which exist in District No. 2. Very ‘
specifically,‘ the problem of representa-
tion. I speak as a member» of our
Union who is not a member of Dis_trict
No. 2,,but vitally interested for a num-
ber of reasons. , .

First of all, let us examine the com- »
position of District No. 2. The over-
whelming majority of the workers are
Mexican-American. There have been

 great victories won by these brothers in

 District‘No. 2 through bitter_- struggle

" along with their Anglo brothers. Dur-

_ .. ing the coming period in carrying out

 . ' our program of.organizin_g the South-

west, we must-utilize every, force to

make o‘in_' drive a success. It is time

we start .bringing Mexican-American_
lea'dership= ‘to the front. Now “is the

time for Mexican-American workers to

attain their rightful place in the lead-

ership of District No. 2.

It is always foremost in the minds
‘of the workers: What are my chances
of reaching higher positions of leader-
__ , ship? It is not only the problem of the
 ‘ . Mexican-American workers, for repre-
sentation, it is the struggle of every
worker in our Union. As long as the
Mexican-American worker is not equal-
ly represented in all pos-itions in eur
Union, we are not utilizing our strength )

to its utmost, and we are falling ‘short,
of our._great_dem_ocratic tradition. _
Beinigla proigressive Union, certainly
our o_ffic_ers_.can see that problem and
the .solut,io_n<lies squarely. on the shoul-
ders of .,tl_1e.,\vorkers with the.proper,
guidanceof those leaders. Up_ until the
time ofythe Convention there had been
no serious‘ attempt by the leadership
of our Union to help these workers at-.
tain that leadership. “
_ I saylthis because of what I saw at
the Co'nv'ention.. There for the first
time,i‘I__‘ ‘inet-Vtlhe delegates from ,the
_ Soutliwest andhad a chanceto know
their feelings and aspirations. Of all
the ‘delegates I ‘talked to, everyone
agreed 5‘ that the need was therefor a
l\Iexi‘can‘-A'rneric'an "on the Executive
Board of the Union, and in other posts
of ' leadership throughout the Union.
But they were confused as to-\vho, and
as I said before, this confusion would’
not have been there, had the problem
been faced up to before. As a result,
we have a; three-way run on the Execu-
tive Board member in District No. 2.
_L‘etus not be placed in a position
xx here this situation can be used by the
' anti-labor elements or disrupters Within
our own ranks. The time is NOW'to

 

face this -problem squarely.

Traivis, Chavez pledge mutuai
..support in  Mine-Mill I electio

To the Editor:

Here are two letters which I believe are of interest. to every member of 
Mill. One was written by_me to Brother J. _,
Paso, one of three candidates for Executive Board Member in l)ist_rict 2. The others

is Brother Chavez’ reply.

» October 1, 1953 .
Mr. J. B. Chavez
421 South Park Street
.El Paso, Texas
Dear Brother Chavez:
This is the first opportunity I have
had since the“St. Louis Convention to
congratulate you on your nomination
for the office of International Execu-
tive Board Member for District 2.
Your nomination gratifies me for
several reasons. Although you and I
have occasionally disagreed, you have
generally over the years supported the
pr'ogram and policies of our great In-
ternational Union. You have earned,
by your record of militant and cour-

\

- ageous trade unionism, the honor be-

stowed on you by the Convention. ,

There is another reason, too, why I
am gratifiedby your candidacy. As
-you know, our Union is one of those
‘ organizations that has stood for many
years. in determined support ‘of the
national aspirations of minority peo-
ples. Our Union has worked consist-
ently along this path, and we have had
some success i11 more fully integrating
both our Negro and Canadian brothers
into the affairs hnd leadership of the
Union.

In my opinion, your candidacy offers
us the" opportunity to extend that pol-
icy of integration to the Mexican-

. American members of our organization.

AFTER considerable study of the
District 2 race, I have decided to sup-
port you’in your campaign for election.
This has not been an easy decision be-
causeall candidates for the District 2
Board Membership have .outstanding
records in support of progressive trade
unionism and- for the program and

"goals of our International Union. All
candidates have been personal friends
of mine for a ‘long time. p -

But careful study of ‘the District 2'
campaign has left me with the conclu-
sion thatﬁyour election as District 2
Board Member would most increase the
strength of our Union in the months

' ahead. In other words, I feel that your

election would better benefit the rank-
and—file..of this Union. '

_With the ‘support of the many cap-
able and fighting Anglo and Mexican-
American leaders of our‘Union in the
Southwest, your election would be of
inestimable value to the forces of

I ,   progress in Mine-Mill and in the trade

union movenient generally.‘ .
Frankly, the list_ of, candidates for ‘

I _the District 2 Board Membership pre-

sented a real’ problem to me until I9
began toevaluate the situation on the;
*basis of which candidate would 'pr'o- _.
vide the. greatest strength tothe Un-‘V

 ion and to the leadership of the.Union.

 There are two main reasons for this

9 to‘9’/2c, -Anaconda continued to offer
only 5c and less than 1c in fringes.
Mason’s activity was directed to sabo‘-‘V

strike date for Anaconda, and made
no preparations for a strike there if.

When the leaders of the International a

From that year up'to—about 1917 I
devoted a great deal of my time on,be-
half of the W.F.M.1 and Mine & Mill
expansion and, without iregret, those.
were the years the membership stood
the acid test ‘of. endurance.

We were besieged by every detective
agency operating atthe time, not as

That fact was-established in the Moyer-

Eleadthis Union through some of the
toughest battles any Union has ever
haduto face. ,
f.Few unions in history have ever had
facesuch raids by other organiza-

;faced such Congressional anti-labor at-

of development in relation with

the old iburly pistol machine, weigh-

wonder the workers demand a much

possible the year the Western Federa-

/.

’We had heard of tht lheroic struggle
of a mining community down in New
Mexico, Local 890 was then in themidst 
of its long and bitter strike against

-_ Empire Zinc. We felt‘ it was a story ,

of epic proportions that ought to be
told to the" whole American people. “*
And so I went down there to deter-
mine whether a wtory of such scope
wouldbe put within the framework of
a motion- picture. I returned to Los

. Angeles to write a long prose outline——-

what in movie terms we call a"‘treat-
ment.” I .
Then I_ returned to Bayard-the
strike was still" on—and this treatment
was read by twenty or thirty miners
"and their wives. It was discussed and -
criticized constructively. ,They- told me

.where,it was true to life and where it

was not.
Then I went back towrite the screen

"play. Again the same procedure fol- ‘

A I some hairbrained scheme. They had to

‘ f_All' this took nearly a ~-year? And

But your union "did putup something
else that could not,ha;v‘e" been bought
for a million bucks.‘They_ put up them-
selves. Local 890 not-only mobilized
its membership to see--this production
through but they provided most of the
actors for the picture, and this_ was
-the only way it could be done if it was
to be authentic, to sh-oot the story on
the spot, with the miners and their
wives playing themselves, and this is
the way it was done.

As you probably know‘, Brother Juan
Chacon, who is a delegate to this con-
vention, played the leading male role
in the picture. I’ s _

-We. had assembled a crew‘ of out-
standing craftsmen,~every one of whom
carried a union card, and of course, we
paid union scale. I '

Therelare no Negro technicians per-
mitted to work in Hollywood, but we
had four -Negroes on our crew, and

-“they were not’ janitors;--they are skilled

.. craftsmen.‘ . 
\ . '
P 0£[l«l.Cfl0I’l _é0dI’(/I

_ For all of us this was an unique and
thrilling experience. ~ For the firstitime
in the history of motion pictures a
group of film technicians and a labor
union had come together" to make a
major film. And out of this we tried
to make this symbolic unity a living
thing by setting up, a production board
composed of four members from the
company, four members-from the union,
four from the auxiliary.

This’ group of "welve made up the
policy_body during the course of. this
production, handling matters‘ranging

from transportation, supply, baby-
sitting, feeding of cast and crew, to_

questions of policy in the content of

" the film. So we had a second guaran-
‘ tee that what we did there was really

authentic. \ .

The real marvel was how quickly
they picked up the. know-how and over-
came their shyness before the‘ camera.

.94 if any wonc[er.7

With this kind of story, this method
of production", is it any wonder that the
picture -was so ‘violently attacked by
anti-labor forces even while it was be-
ing made? Consider for‘. a moment
what it was: V : .

The first feature film ever made in
this country /that dealt honestly with
the life of a democratic trade union.
Horror of horrors! . .. . a'picture that
told _the story from’ the viewpoint of
the workingman himself!  

That was not'all. It was the first

revolution. -— 3-D in Hollywood.
But we felt we had a secret. We
had the fourth dimension. It is
called reality-—the reality of
working peoples’ lives.”

“Hollywood has been releasing ,-
some 5'00 to .400 pictures a year,
most of them ignoring the exist-
ence of organized labor; some of
them openly hostile to it. 1 Don’t
the American people have the
right to see at least one that
gives the union side of the story?

“Over 50 million Ainericans go
totmovies ever /month. Doesn’t
a union have a right to reach an
audience in the millions?”

-—Excerpts from

Mike Wilson's speech

Ca” fa uilo/ence

The Hollywood brass got/hold of a
California congressman named Jackson,
Who, as Brother Clark told you, then
made an inflammatory speech in the
halls of Congress, a speech filled with
lies and distortions. His speech was, in
effect, a call to violence. So the vigi-
lantes went into action.

What happened then I think you all
know—the physical
crew and the cast and theunion lead-
ers; the burning of the union hall and
a miner’s home; the arrest of our lead-
ing lady by the ‘Immigration Depart-
ment;'the fact that they had no charges
against her, told her she was free to
leave” at any time and return on one
promise—that she not work in ‘xthis
picture. , ‘

Yet, despite these threats that we get

_out of town, the crew stood by us, the’ ‘

Union stood by us with the same calm
and determination ‘that had already
won them victories in their earlier
struggles. Local 890 faced down the
vigilantes, and the film was finished.

ban it in the film laboratories.

A frantic attempt has been made, to
intimidate’film and.sound laboratories.
Technicians were warned not to work
for us lest they find themselves black-
listed in the industry. .

I am happy to report‘ that these'tac-
ticshave failed.

-We have found more allies than our
enemies ‘ever dreamed existed.

If .I stress the difficulties rather than 

the positive ‘achievements in making‘

this picture, it’ is only to make ‘clear ‘
. what lies ahead.

Certainly we would ‘be naive toathink
that the McCarthy crowd will’ give up
trying to.sLippress.the picture. When

it isready for ‘exhibition, these forces‘ I

will attempt. tointimidate theatre own-
ers and exhibitors in the same way as

to banthe picture atthe box office. ,
Itis true that sooner or later,-eome

assaults’ on the_

   
 

film laboratories were. They. will try

I" 2 

 
 
 

.union halls because 16 mm reduction

prints can and will be made .

But this picture was produced as a
regular 35 mm. picture for public exhi-
bition, and if .it_ is shown only to miners
in the privacy of their own halls, then
we will have failed.

This picture must be an instrumenti, A

for Mine-Mill to spread the truth about
Mine-Mill. In this sense you need to
reach a lot of other people——your po-
tential friends and allies, the unorgan-
ized, the trade unionsts elsewhere, mid-.
dle class elements a-nd farm groups—-

all of whom are hit daily by a barrage ,

of anti-union propaganda. ~ . .

I cannot say that everyone we want
to see this picture will approve of
everything in it, but I do believe: that
no honest American after seeing it
could come away with the same prej-
udices he had before. -
‘This is the basic issue here: the‘
right of the American people’ to see-

‘ and judge this ‘picture on its _own

merits; the right of a trade union as

. well as a big corporation to use mass‘

communication to tell its side of the‘-
story. /.

I ‘ ﬂight lo  ohown

But we can be sure that labor- ene-A '

mies will organize to prevent exhibi-
tion of this picture. This means that
in many localities Mine-Mill men and
women will have to do more than mere-
ly wait for it to turn up at their local

movie house. It means that they will. —

have to get the word to community

leaders, to clergymen, educators, and I,

others, making clear to them what the

issue is: that this picture has a right A
to be shown, whether they agree with.

it or not. ‘

It would‘ mean getting informal civic

committees to urge theatre ownersgt,oy 

exhibit the picture. It would mean
getting the word to the rank and filo-
of. other unions to gain their support.

In this connection we found that the

circulation of the current issue-of tho’ "I" i

California Quarterly, which contains
the story of SALT OF THE EARTH
has been an excellent Way of ‘gaining
support. 'We,have sent copies of the

script to‘ many --i n fl u e n t i a-I people 

throughoutytlie nation. Most of them
throughout, the nation have been en-"

3 thusiastic, and all of them have agreed -

on its right to be shown.

. Aqui lo envio dos cartas que creo deben interesar a todo miembro de Mine-

‘Sr. J. B. Chavez _

421 South Park Street

El Paso, Texas

Estimado Hermano Chavez:

Esta es la primera oportunidad que
he tenido desde la convencién en“ St.
Louis para felicitarlo por su nomina-
ci6n para la oficina de miembro de la
mesa directiva nacional para’ el Dis-

varias razones. Aunque Ud. y yo en
ocaciones no hemos’ estado de
acuerdo,”Ud. generalmente a traves
los aﬁos ha apoyado el programa y
la politica do nuestra gran federacion
internacional. Ud. ha ganado, por
medio de su militante y valiente record
de unionismo s-indical, el honor que la
'convenci6n lo otorgé.

Hay_.otro motivo, también, porque
eu candidatura me satisface. Como
Ud. sabe, nuestra union ha sido una
de las agrupaciones que‘por aﬁos ha
apoyado con determinacién las aspira-
ciones nacionales de pueblos minora-
torips. Nuestra union ha trabajado
-consistentemente por este ..sendero, y
hemos logrado exito en mas completa-
mente integrar a nuestros hermanos
Negros y Canadiens-es en los asuntos
y el liderato de nuestra union. En mi
concepto, su candidatura nos ofrece la
oportunidad ;de extender esa. politica
-de‘ integracién a los miembros Mexico-
Americanos de nuestra organizacién.

DESPUES de un estudio de la car-
rera en el Distrito 2, he deciilido
apoyarlo en su candidatura para elec-
cién. Es-ta nofué una decisi6n,_facil

C iporque todos los candidatos para la

_mesa directiva nacional del _Distrito
2 tienen records salientes en respaldo
del ,unionismo sindical progresista y
A-del programa y.los objetos de nuestra
.Urii6n Internacional. Todos los candi-
datos han sido amigos -intimos por
mucho tiempo. Pero un estudio cui-
dadoso de la campaﬁa. en el Distrito
2 me, ha llevado a la conclusion que
su eleccién como miembro de. la mesa
directiva nacional para el Distrito 2
mejor reforzaria 1a"fuerza de "nuestra
union en.los meses venideros. Enotras
palabrae, siento que su eleccion mejor
redundaria en beneficio de todos los
Amiembros de ‘esta union. Con el apoyo
de los mucho_s conipetentes_,_ y mili-

tantes lideres Anglos y Mexico-Amer- '

icanos en el sud~oeste, su eleccién seria

fde valor Ainestimable para las fuerzas.
"del progreso en Mine-Mill ‘y ‘en"el
