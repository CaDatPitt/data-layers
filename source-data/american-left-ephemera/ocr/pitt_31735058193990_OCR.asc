The Political Struggle Between the SW?
And SDS Raises Questions of the Greatest
i.Concerh to the Peace Movement

‘'On November lst the New York Committee to End the War in
‘ Vietnam.was formally dissolved. This action_was the end»
' result of a factional struggle between the leaders of SDS
‘in New York and the SW? (Socialist Workers Party), a struggle
7 ‘which had been raging for some months. Te task of building
.an effective and united mass anti~war movement in New York
V ncity and elsewhere requires a clear understanding of the
causes of this struggle. It is these political issues,’ -
rather than the organizational measures taken by both sides,
.which must be our major concern. C C ‘ ‘

The motion to dissolve the Committee was made at a meeting of
its steering committee by an SDS member in his capacity as
representative of a local community group, Of all hose‘

‘?present, only SWPers, Yshers (Young Socialist Alliance)"
and one additional person voted against the motion.

The New'York Committee was an extension of an SDS summer
project to organize community groups against the war. How-
ever,-with the intervention of the SW? it had become a battle—
ground for conflicting views on how to build the anti-war ‘M
_movement. ~‘ « 4 - ‘
The SUP tried to enforce its right~wing line that the Comm-
‘»ittee and the local community groups should strive to builds
a broad, allwinclusive peace movement in which Democrats
and Republicans as well as radicals would feel at home.
SDS on the other hand sought a way to politicelizé the
struggle and make ties with the masses.

The SW? has publicly circulated a document on it perspectives.
Emphasizing that this is the first time that an anti~war

struggle of this magnitﬁde has.occurred in the United States
during an actua‘ war, t e SWP sees this movement as a potent
political force.” According to the SW? logic, to exclude any
potential supporters of the movement, be they ever-so~right~
‘wing otherwise; is to limit its effectiveness. Slogans i
must be limited, they insist, to the right of the Vietnam-
ese people to self-determination; and the withdrawal of Amer»
ican troops. «Radicals, they demand, must fight against any
efforts by SA§E, etc., to exclude them on political grounds.
Tis is tie SH? perspective on the fight against the Viet-
namese war; ""'” A - 6 iv°'   \

SDS on the other hand has sought to build an independent
anti-var movement which would establish ties with the civil;
rights and other movements of social protest. While SDS' y
itself is’a multi4tendency organization there is a left wing
within it which understands the need to make the struggle ‘
against war a conscious political struggle. So far,.SDS has
not made a direct confrontation with sing and other right.
wing peace groups; however the logic of the situation is

to polarize the-peace movement into a right wing and a

left uing.g*, i ‘ a n ” l -“ *

The Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Qomnittee, an ad hoc
formation in which all peace-groups including SANE are
represented, has been functioning in ﬁew'York City since‘
the October»l6 parade. SDS proposes to support the continued
existence of this committee as a coordinating committee for
anti—war work in the city,’ j‘ ”

SDS plans to reconstitute an organizing committee this:

time explicitly on the basis of its own'programmaticiob+
jectives. The expectation is that the SUP will exclude .
itself since participation in the committee will be predicated
on agreement with SDS's program. Thus, it would seem that the
SW? in seeking the capture of the peace movement has ended up
in capturing itself. - *' ‘

SWP's Factionalism. The SW? operated in the Committee and,
in local conaittees as a disciplined faction, with the aim
of taking over local committees and thereby defeating the
SDS leadership in the Hew‘York Committee. To this purpose
they sent their members into the weakest committees. In ‘
this way at least two of the local committees became appen-
dages of the.SWP,”giying-the'SWP two sure delegates to the
New'York Committee~meetingS{‘.In other cases, SW? and YSA
members would also appear at Committee meetings claiming

to represent local community groups although they had never"
been elected as delegates. A_number of free-floating SW? '
and YSA members would also appear at Comuittee meetings;
and because of the informality of the organization their
right to pack the meetings and vote was never challenged;

Instead of engaging in serious work in the movement, instead ”

of seeking to establish ties with SDS people and independents
by working with them, instead of engaging in a discussion‘
which would clarify the areas of difference and agreement,
the SUP sought to impose its dictate by organizational man~
euvers of the crudest kind.

Egg Old CP ggle. The SUP is following the same road that
brought the Communist Party to disaster: the road of Popular
Front politics-- abdication of class struggle politics in
order to make an opportunist alliance with liberals; ‘While
the SUP runs independent election campaigns these campaigns
orient more and more to middle class liberal voters.

Significantly the SW? line on Vietnam does not differ in
any respect from the CP line on the Korean war. The Period
differs, and with it the possibilities for.mass action--
but the line is the same: limit the anti-war struggle to
"peace" issues. — .  ‘ "

The recent SW? factional maneuvering is also unpleasantly’
reminiscent of old CP tactics: Destroy all ‘otential leftn
wing “competitors” while orienting to libera peace forcesi
It would seem that the SUP will have to repeat the CP's
experiences in SAHE (within which the C? was viciously
witch-hunted in 1961) in order to learn the bitter lesson
of Popular Front politics. ‘

The SWP has lost its connection with the class struggle
today and its perspective of class struggle in the future.
This became glaringly apparent_after the Cuban revolution.
Lacking Marxist theory, the party was reduced to printing
Castro's speeches with favorable commentary. Despite the
rich theoretical experience of Marxism since the days of the

«Paris Commune, the party could find nothing to say about the
tneed for class struggle politics in Cuba~~the need for workers

control.

Lacking Marxist theory, the party answered Halcolm X's
call for theoretical discussion by printing Malcolm's
speeches. At an SWP forum, Halcolm stated that the Negro
movement had "to go into a closet" and develop a program
for struggle. The SUP had nothing to say beyond calling
for an all Black political party«~ forerunner to the all-
inclusive peace movement, A a

But the SUP has taken another step in its retreat from
Marxism. While it tail-ended Fidel and Malcolm, the party
is now attacking SDS. No longer does the SW? tail-end
political forces moving in a left direction.’ It has.now
begun to attack them from the right.

No group develops politically in a vacuum. The weight of
American capitalism is too oppressive. Tithout Marxist
politics, in the long run the only alternative is capitalism
politics. The examples of His Majesty's loyal opposition are

Bayard Rustin and the Communist Party. The SWP has taken
another long step down this road,o .

The Future 9; the Antiewar Hovement. The war in Vietnam is
351? one expressiog 9; American capitalist policy. 'Emerging
out ofVthe7struggle§£§r survival of'capitalism5 the need
for the economy'to grew or,go into crisis; it is the other
side of raeist,“anti4uni6hLpolitics here at home. The war
in.Vietnam is an essential part of gapitalist policy. o
Neither Johnson nor Kennedy had he lived ﬁor Goldwater had
he won; can be pressured into stopping this war by a show
of popular discontent.‘ f ‘ _   : "'i ’”j

This is not the period of the New Deal when the Communist
Party was able to sell out the.working olass in return for

a place‘in the Roosevelt coalition; This is,a beriod when
the class struggle on all sides will beddme increasingly
sharp; iwe can expegt more "interventiohs" by the US govern-
ment in revblutibnsjahroad and a tougher line here at'home.,
‘We can expeét-intreésiﬁgly militant uprisings.1ike those
in’the-Watt§;ghetto‘la§§Vsumer; # a T‘ t* ‘ L‘*

The only wa?‘to1defeat the war policy of American capitalism
is to defeat American capitalism. ilt is for this reason
that SDS members are following the correct policy when they
try to build Eglitical opposition to the war and to link
the anti-warestruggle to the community, to mass struggle.

_o Tlhe right-wing in the‘peace movement must be fought. The
“V call for a pure and simple single~issue, all-inclusive
peace movement, is the call for bourgeois respectability.
It is to-domesticate the anti-war movement and make it
ineffective.

We must build an antiuwar movement that will effectively
fight war by fighting capitalism.
