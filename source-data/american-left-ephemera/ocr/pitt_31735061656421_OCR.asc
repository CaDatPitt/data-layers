THE CRUISE MISSILE

BY DAN SMITH

E TH C UISE MISSI E.’ -‘

It's essentially a small pilotless airplane carrying a conventional or nuclear war-

 

It comes in a direct line of descent from the V-l "buzz bomb” used against
Britain by the Germans near the end of world war II. It has an on-board guidance
system to keep it on course. It flies at low altitude, less than 250 feet, tracing
a meandering and deceptive course to elude enemy radar and penetrate enemy defenses.
Although vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles, it is cheap enough for production in
quantity and - so the military reasoning goes - could overwhelm defenses by sheer
numbers. with its highly accurate targeting system, a cruise missile that gets
through will have a better than 50 per cent chance of striking within l00 feet of

the target. The payload: "a nuclear charge of more than 200 kilotons (about l5
times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima).“ (wall St. Journal, l/3/77)

Two main types of long range cruise missile are currently under development:

' The U.S. Air Force/Boeing Air Launched Cruise Missile, with a range that
could be as high as l,5OO miles. 24 of them can be carried on a B-52.

0 The U.S. Navy/General Dynamics Submarine Launched Cruise Missile, or
"Tomahawk," with a range of about 2,300 miles. It is fired from
torpedo tubes and is thus capable of transforming ordinary hunter-
killer submarines into delivery platforms for strategic nuclear
weapons, with the enemy having little or no idea on which sub-
marines the missiles are deployed.

The Pentagon is also interested in developing a ground launched version of the _
Submarine Launched Cruise Missile, and is considering adapting the same missile
for air launching; a flyoff between the latter and the Boeing missile is pro-
posed for mid-l979,*

The crucial part of long range cruise missile technology is the guidance system. An
on-board computer has a "picture" of the terrain over which it is programmed to fly;
at preset intervals it takes an electronic look around, and makes any necessary
course corrections or changes. Its programmed course can use hills and mountains

to hide it from radar, or simply deceive the enemy by indirectness. Utilizing
microcircuitry, the whole system is compact and light enough to fit on the small

(20 feet long) missile.

*There are also shorter range cruise missiles, some of which have already been
deployed. The Harpoon missile with a range of about 50 miles is now deployed on
American surface ships. The British navy plans to use an adapted version of Harpoon
on submarines, and has already deployed the French-made Exocet on frigates and
destroyers. The Soviet navy has widely deployed similar types. This fact sheet,
however, concentrates on the long range cruise missiles which are more dangerous,
and a more destabilizing new factor in the world arms race. It is probably too late
to stop deployment of short range cruise missiles.

HOW IT WILL BE USED

“Each B-52 can launch many missiles, with great accuracy, at different tar-
gets in the Soviet Union, from a distance of many hundreds of miles. Each
produces many small targets for Soviet air defenses to contend with. If
additional warhead-carrying capacity is needed, that can come from new
cruise missile carriers in addition to the B-52.”
--U.S. Secretary of Defense Brown, 8/2/77

To the military, cruise missiles combine the attractions of versatility and a rela-
tively low cost. with similar guidance systems, but different airframes, they
could do a whole range of jobs, launched from almost any kind of delivery platform.

° Launched from airplanes, submarines, or the ground (where they could
be either fixed or mobile, on trucks for instance) they could become
strategic weapons in their own right, a new component of the American
strategic nuclear force

' with shorter ranges they could provide a new generation of tactical
nuclear weapons for NATO in Europe

° In some missions, their great accuracy could eliminate the "need" for
nuclear warheads, thus providing the military with more options

THE GREAT EQUALIZER?

"The U.S. will turn out cruise
missiles like Fords and use them
to saturate Soviet defense if we
are attacked."
-—Pentagon official quoted
in Aviation Week

"The accurate inexpensive cruise
missile may prove to be the great
equalizer among nations, but it may
also prove to be the ultimate
leveller of their cities."
-—Kosta Tsipis, MYT professor

It's not all that cheap. In l974, research and development on the Submarine Launched
Cruise Missile was estimated at one billion dollars; inflation will have pushed that
cost up, as will changes in the development program.* Production costs are currently
estimated at $750,000 to $l million apiece. Still, that's a lot less than the cost
of developing and building an Intercontinental or Submarine Launched Ballistic
Missile, for which there must also be costly and complex launching and targeting
equipment (missile silos, missile-firing subs, etc.).

It's been suggested that Britain, France, Japan, Sweden and west Germany have the
industrial experience and infrastructure needed for development of long range

cruise missiles; Italy and Israel should perhaps be added to that list. Given time,
other countries will join the list as well. The frightening prospect is that many
countries will develop these missiles, giving themselves sophisticated strategic
weapons which will be effective against enemies which lack sophisticated and dense
air defense systems. with the spread of nuclear weapon technology, it adds up to

a dangerously well-armed world.

*In the wake of the B-1 bomber program cancellation, the Carter Administration in
July asked Congress for an extra $449 million for cruise missile development. Part
of this money would be used to modify wide—bodied jets such as Boeing 7475 or Lock-
heed C—SAs, converting them into potential cruise missile launching platforms to
augment the existing B-52 fleet. The $449 million was in addition to $358 million
already requested for cruise missile development in the coming year.

 

 

 

PUTTING THE GENTE BACK IN THE BOTTLE

”[The cruise missile] builds on our comparative advantage in technology over
the Soviet Union. It will usher in a new era in bomber technology, replacing
some of the traditional manned penetrators with vastly greater numbers of
unmanned penetrators, much harder to intercept and with great potential for
technological growth.”——Secretary of Defense Brown, 8/2/77

The development of the long range cruise missile can make the world a substantially
more dangerous place. It threatens to overturn the limited gains of arms control
and detente, pushing us back into a new cold war. It could provide many smaller
countries with a relatively cheap strategic nuclear force. Its high accuracy

over long ranges makes it militarily attractive and very usable. In every part of
the world, it could increase tension and distrust, ruin chances for peaceful reso-
lution of conflicts, end our hopes for disarmament. It is a new kind of weapon -
it brings new dangers. How can we best respond?

with the T974 Vladivostok accord the U.S. and the Soviet Union agreed on a
“ceiling” of 2,400 nuclear weapon delivery systems (bombers and missiles) for each
side as the basis for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) where a new treaty
(commonly known as SALT II) is currently being negotiated. The Russians propose
that this ceiling should include long range cruise missiles; the U.S.'disagrees,
arguing that cruise missiles do not count as missiles under the Vladivostok accord.
It has proposed a separate and additional ceiling of 200 to 400 weapons under which
American long range cruise missiles would be counted against Soviet “Backfire”
bombers. This the Russians reject, as they consider “Backfire” to be a tactical
bomber, excluded from SALT, because it cannot make the round trip to the U.S.
without refuelling and they have no tanker fleet for in-flight refuelling.

Arms control agreements depend on verification, to make sure the other side doesn't
cheat. Difficult as verification problems are for other strategic weapons, they
pale into insignificance beside the awesome task of identifying and counting stra-
tegic nuclear long range cruise missiles. If you want to cheat they are small
enough to hide. Nuclear or conventional, tactical or strategic - they all look

the same. If either side insists on exempting tactical long range cruise missiles
from SALT II there will be insuperable problems.

For the purposes of SALT, the distinguishing feature between tactical and strategic
weapons is their range. This cannot be accurately determined from size: some of
the Soviet short range cruise missiles are larger than American long range types.
Guidance systems work the same whatever the range; “strategic” engines could be put
in “tactical” airframes. Observing tests could provide some data for an estimate
of ranges, but the estimate could be wrong by a factor of two either way. As the
Library of Congress noted in an April report, “Cruise missile testing, unlike ICBM
and SLBM testing, can be easily concealed.”

Thus long range cruise missiles could throw SALT and arms control out of gear, even
ruining the limited gains that have been made thus far through arms control. For
that reason alone, the U.S. has an interest in banning these weapons, but there are
other reasons as well.

Currently the U.S. has an effective monopoly on the technology of the guidance
system, the crucial part of the long range cruise missile, but the monopoly will not
last forever. The Soviet Union can break it, just as it broke the American monopoly
on MIRVs (multiple independently targeted warheads), and when it does it will pose
exactly the same nasty military problems for the U.S. as American cruise missiles
will soon pose for the U.S.S.R.

In fact, the “.3. already faces a cruise missile problem. Some of the less sophist-
icated Soviet submarine launched cruise missiles have ranges of about 300 miles and,
despite poor accuracy, could hit strategic targets in the U.S.A. because of the
population and industry concentrations on the eastern and western seaboards.

what kind of agreement might overcome the problems of verification? The only work-
able agreement seems to be one which bans all cruise missiles, both nuclear and
conventional, above a certain low range.

SALT is largely a matter of tradeoffs, so let us suggest trading off American long
range cruise missiles against existing Soviet cruise missiles and future Soviet
development of more sophisticated types. The way to do this is to offer an agreement
banning all cruise missiles above a range of l00 miles (or even a bit lower), perhaps
in the form of an additional protocol to the SALT agreement now under negotiation.
This would permit continued deployment of short range cruise missiles like "Harpoon"
and "Exocet" - but ban the Soviet missiles which threaten the American seaboards,
and. of course, ban current American developments from entering production.

The basis of this proposal is recognition that the cruise genie is out of the
bottle, but that there is still a chance of forcing the long range cruise genie
back in. Unless this kind of agreement is reached, there may not even be token
limitations on long range cruise missiles, or else the Vladivostok ceilings will be
raised to make room. And if that happens, future agreements will probably permit
increased numbers. Allegations of cheating will fly fast and furious. Agreements
will be little more than token because verification techniques simply are not good
enough to ensure that no cheating occurs.

SALT has given us the beginnings of a safer relationship between the two superpowers.
It's far from perfect, but it's the best we've got. If we lose it, we will be put back
many years. But it is more than a matter of saving SALT. The real question is whether
the two sides have the wisdom, the common sense, to forgo a spurious short-term advan-
tage for the sake of long-term interest. If a low range limit on cruise missiles is
agreed on, and all missiles above that limit are banned, many military options will

be lost. Some of them will be options for NATO in Europe: America's allies too must
see the sense of the proposal. Some of them will be Soviet options: the U.S.S.R. will
also have to sacrifice short-term advantage. It is around that kind of question that
the chances for real arms control — and ultimately disarmament - are balanced.
