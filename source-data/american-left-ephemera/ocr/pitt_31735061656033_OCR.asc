the inquiry also was illegally formed by systematic exclusion
of Negroes from the panel from which it was drawn.

The supervision of the Federal grand jury's inquiry was
placed by Clark into the hands of the federal judge of that
district who was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan and
whose charge to the grand jurors conformed to the code of
the Klan.

Peculiarly obscure was a passage from the Report of the
Federal Grand Jury, which said:

“Paul F. Bumpus, District Attorney General for Maury and
other counties, with the assistance of the few other local of-
ﬁcials at hand, began an investigation—-” etc.

Why does the report name Bumpus alone, leaving the “few
other local ofﬁcials” unnamed? There is a good reason.

Behind the words “few other local officials” the Federal
grand jury is concealing the fact that one of the three men who
participated with Bumpus in third-degreeing and fra-ming up
the Negroes is a man who took part in the lynching of another
Negro boy twelve and a half years ago—organizing the mob,
allowing his automobile to be used to kidnap the victim, and
telephoning invitations to many to come to the public castra-
tion and hanging.

It is concealing further the fact that the coroner of Maury
county who refrained from holding an inquest into the deaths
of the only two persons killed in this case, thereby covering
up the earmarks of a ghastly murder, is the same coroner who,
twelve and a half years ago, aided in placing the rope around
the neck of that Negro boy, held the boy while he was being
physically mutilated, tightened the rope on the tree and pushed
him off a ladder to hang. ,

In spite of the Federal grand jury, the past will help to ex-

plain the present. This would be true even if there were no i

identity between the individual lynchers of the past and some
of the chief ﬁgures now engaged in the frame—up of the 29 in-
nocent men and one innocent woman of Columbia. The fact

that two of the actors in the bloodiest and most ghastly lynch-

ing that Columbia has even known—a dozen years ago——appea.r
again in the 204th lynching of this state—the lynching that

failed—makes it easier to understand the present case and its
causes, and what it will lead to if the conscience of America
and of our native Southland is not aroused in time.

The Federal grand jury speaks ill of the press as having
distorted the facts. The truth is that the newspapers generally
did do a shameless job of stupid, heartless warping of the news.
The facts were exposed fully and fearlessly by only one daily
newspaper, the Daily Worker, a Communist paper of New
York. But all the warping of the news by the commercial press
was done in catering to the lynch and frame-up gang; and that
is also what the Federal grand jury did. The report that the
Federal grand jury issued after months of investigation is far
more sloppily inaccurate, dishonest and evasive than the worst
of the newspaper reports that went hot to press without time
for checking——or much tampering.

Elmer D. Davies, the federal judge, looked over the record
of many years of race_ relations in Maury County and called
it a record of “trying to live together in peace and harmony."

We will see what kind of “peace and harmony” it has been.

Davies’ charge to the Federal grand jury was an invitation to
abandon all concern with the civil rights of Negroes and to
prostitute the inquiry into a baiting of the great and growing
body of Americans who are resolved not to tolerate lynching
any longer. Those who protest that there must be no railroad-
ing to prison of courageous men and women for preventing
a lynching—are denounced by the faithless and cowardly judge
as “deliberately agitating matters of this kind to cause dif-
ﬁculties between races."

But we will agitate matters of this kind until the sun has set
upon the last lynching, and until the last lynchers’ frame-up
shall have ceased to befoul our country. And in ﬁghting this
Tennessee case—in bringing it before the honest people of
Tennessee and of the South and the whole world—we are
determined to bring about the criminal prosecution, conviction
and lawful punishment of those who are guilty of the frame-
up at Columbia, and even of the crimes of the past.

So, take a glance at the past-

 

 

LYNCHING AND FRAME-UP
IN TENNESSEE

By Robert Minor

I
205 LYNCHINGS IN TENNESSEE*

The single daily newspaper in -Columbia said on the after-
noon of the day of bloodshed:

“There is no reason why the two races cannot live to-

ether in peace and harmony in the future as they have
lived for the past 75 years.” (Columbia, Tenn., Daily
Herald, February 26, 1946.)

During the time chosen by that newspaper as the yardstick
for future race relations, 203 Negroes have been lynched in
Tennessee, an average of one every 134 days for three-quarters
of a century. If the white people and the Negro people live to-
gether “as they have lived for the past 75 years,” there will be
in Tennessee in the coming 75 years more than 200 lynchings
of Negro men, women and children.

We reject the yardstick and demand a change.

Newspapers attempting to excuse lynching of Negroes be-
come maudlin about “the old families” who have lived “15o
years in Tennessee,” and who have been given so “much
trouble” by the Negroes.

There are no older families in Tennessee than the Blairs,

 

* The number 203 only approximates the count of recorded lynchings
in Tennessee in the past seventy-ﬁve years; most lynchings are not recorded

and the real total would probably be twice as many if all were known.

the Harlans, the Clays-, the Lockridges, the Cheeks, the Frier-
sons, the Pillows and the Mortons——and I mean the Negro
families of these names, for each family name is duplicated in
the white and Negro. The Negroes are not less pioneers than
the white men and women who arrived in Tennessee on the
same wagons with them. And surely no man. ever gave greater
trouble to another man than by holding him in slavery.

Take, for instance, the family of Julius Blair, the aged
patriarch of the Negro community, who is a defendant in this
case. His father, the ﬁrst Julius Blair, was born a slave ten
miles north of Columbia. Freed from slavery in 1863, he
worked three-quarters of a century ago as a carpenter, helping
to build what is still the leading hotel of Columbia. His son,
the present Julius Blair, now 75 years old, married the
daughter of Saul Wilkins, the barber, another slave freed in
1863, and their so-n, Saul Blair, became in turn the foremost
barber of the town.

Likewise freed from slavery in 1863 was the Negro family
of Mortons, who, 57 years ago, founded t-he A. J. Morton
Funeral Home in which the ﬁnal rites have been said for most

of the Negroes who have died in Columbia since 1889.

I have in mind another man born within seven miles of
Columbia in 1861, the son of the nephew of his white owner
and a Negro slave mother, and who was freed by the Emancipa-
tion as a baby two years of age. The slave mother took the
name of his white father, Jacob Harlan, and named her baby
Henry -Clay Harlan. He has lived within a mile of his birth-
place 85 years. His memory goes back, sharp and clear, to the

’ year 1 870.

Each of these Negro families are of the people of Tennessee.
And each of their older men and women has more than a
hundred times heard fresh news of the hangi-ng or burning
alive of one of their own people within the State of Tennessee
and often within a few miles of their homes, sometimes within
sight of their eyes. '

Let us hear their own account.

We will not include here the acts of violence too remote for
the memory of men and women now living in Columbia and

11

 

 

\

Maury county. We omit the period from the close of the Civil
War up to and including the year 1870 in which the 14th
Amendment to the U. S. Constitution and the new Constitu-
tion of Tennessee were adopted—though 162 Negroes were
murdered in the single year from July, 1867, to July, 1868. We
will stay within the 75 years of experience of our living wit-
nesses, checked by printed records.

The real beginning of lynching—when organized murder
of Negroes was raised to the level of a political institution-
came only in the late 1870's and the 1880's, after the Rep-ub-
lican party entered into an agreement with the Democratic
party no longer to apply the Civil War amendments of the
Constitution insofar as the rights of the Negro were concerned.
The 187o’s were a decade of much violence, but also of much
resistance to violence, and much progress, for it was in that
decade that 23 United States congressmen of the Negro race

8 were elected by white and Negro voters of the South, when for

the first time a public school system was established by the
“extravagance” of former Negro slaves as legislators, to the
horror of the white landowners, and when the stocks and the
branding iron and other relics of slavery were abolished in the
South.

Lynching in that period was limited. In its fully developed
form it began as a political instrument to restore the former
slave-owners to power. It has never been generally practised
without the full consent of the propertied classes; it has never
been tolerated except as an instrument of class rule.

Particularly in Tennessee, lynching came into existence as
a gigantic instrument for the destruction of the political rights
of the main body of the population of the State, white as well
as Negro. And, contrary to what the philistines say, there was
some democracy in Tennessee. For fully 20 years, from 1870
up to 1890, the great mass of both white and Negro people
voted in Tennessee, ballotting at times as high as 71 per cent
of the citizens of voting age—which compares well with the
best of the States today. _

To destroy this democracy was the primary motive behind
the rise of lynching in the 1880's and there is no truer measure
of the loss of democracy for the whole people than the record
of these lynchin-gs of Negroes.

There were 38 lynchings of Negroes in Tennessee from 1882

to 188g—an average of one every three‘ months. The oldestlofl

the Negroes of Maury county can tell you today vividly the
story of the hanging of a Negro woman in the courthouse at
Jackson, Tennessee, where it is said the State Supreme Court
then met, in 1886. The names of the prominent men who
murdered this woman, the Negroes say, were known to every-

one; but no arrests were made. The hanging was regarded as a‘

matter of prestige in the struggle of the sons of the former
slave-owners to regain the supremacy lost by their fathers in
the Civil War. Even after it was disclosed that the woman, a
cook, was innocent of the crime that served as the excuse for
hanging her, her body, stripped naked, was left to hang several

13

   

days in the courthouse as a warning to Negroes; and it still
hangs in their memory.

The rate of lynching increased in the sharp struggle to
deprive Negroes of political rights at the end of- the 188o’s.
Eight Negroes were lynched in the single year 1890, during a
state-wide drive" to deprive both the Negro and the poor white
of the right to vote. The poll tax was made a condition for
the right of franchise, and the ratio of voting was reduced from
71 per cent to 58 per cent. Twelve Negroes were lynched in

 

Tennessee in 1891; the oldest Negro Columbians remember -

best the hanging of Martin Mayberry at Bryant Station, in
Maury county near Columbia. Another Negro was hanged by
a white gang at Tullahoma, 60 miles away.

The following year, 1892, was the ﬁrst in which the poll tax
,was applied in Tennessee as a barrier to voting in a national
election. It was used to stem the rising tide of the Populist
movement among small white and Negro farmers. There was
an average of one Negro lynched in Tennessee every 18 days
for the full year. For some reason, the Negroes of Maury county
remember most clearly a wholesale hanging at Memphis. A
letter carrier, Thomas Moss, and his partners, Calvin McDonell
and Will Stuart, who had set up a successful grocery business
in Memphis, were attacked by gunmen led by a rival white
grocer, and the Negro grocerymen returned the ﬁre. They were
jailed three days, then turned over to a mob led by friends of
the white grocer who hanged them in the street. In the same
city that year, Lee Walker was handed over to an armed white
gang by the sheriff, and publicly castrated and hanged.

There were, as far as I know, no indictments or arrests for
any of the 20 lynchings of Negroes in Tennessee that year.
It was a struggle for political control. Many thousands of
Negroes paid the poll tax with the intention of voting, but
were prevented from casting their ballots. For the ﬁrst time
since 1870 most of the Negroes of Tennessee were kept away
from the polls. Of the potential voters, 42 per cent failed to get
into the voting booths, and the ballot for -Gen. James B.
Weaver, the People’s Party candidate for President, and state
candidates, was held down to 23,730 in Tennessee.

14

 

’ Since that year, never except once——in 1896——have as many as
-half the adult citizens voted in Tennessee. Lynching of Negroes
is a system of struggle against the whole people.

There was an average of one Negro lynched in Tennessee
every 26 days during the next year, 1893.

Southeast of Columbia, an hour and a half drive down the
Lewisburg road and up Route No. 50, is the place where Ned
Waggoner and his family were hanged in 18g3«—one of the
great, bloody nightmares of the Negroes’ history of Tennessee.
Toward the end of October, a “midnight party” came to
Waggoner's farm. Its spokesmen accused Ned Waggoner of
“quarreling" with the son of “a prominent white family"
named John Dowers, and told Waggoner he must leave the
state. The Waggoners did not leave, and 200 men came on
horseback in the night of November 4. They hanged Ned
Waggoner ﬁrst; he was a big, heavy man; the rope broke and
he fell from the tree; and they hanged him again with a new
rope. Then they unfastened Mary Waggoner Mottlow’s arms
from around her two children, a year and a half and three years
old, and hanged her in the tree beside her father. Her brother,

’Will Waggoner, was hanged next, and her husband, Sam

Mottlow, was hanged last. Mrs. Eliza Waggoner, wife of Ned,
was not hanged; she and her son-in-law’s brother, Henry Mott-

low, and Jeff Wise, 12 years old, were made to witness the

 

hanging, which took an hour.

Ask one of the older men or women of Columbia to tell you
about this. '

The next year there were twelve Negroes lynched in Ten-
nessee, and in 1895 there were eleven, and twelve in 1896.

Such a history inevitably begets a political philosophy.

At that time, just 50 years ago, the outstanding spokesman
for -the dominant class in Tennessee, sons of the old slave-
owning aristocracy, was Jacob McGavock Dickinson-—the ﬁrst
of two men of that name. Dickinson was then Assistant At-
torney General of the United States under President Cleveland,
and was later to become Secretary of War in the Cabinet of
President Taft. At a banquet of the Tennessee Society on June
1, 1896, the elder Dickinson gave the philosophy of the proper-

15

 

 

tied classes of Tennessee in regard to the Negro, in a speech
that was published as a booklet. He was describing for his
audience the economic ruin of Tennessee which he claimed
was due to abolition of slavery. Praising the Dred Scott deci-
sion, he said:

“The Constitution recognized property in slaves, and made
it the duty of States to deliver fugitives to their owners.

“This had been declared by the Supreme Court of the
United States, which said that ‘no word can be found in the
Constitution which gives Congress a greater power over slave
property, or which entitles property of that kind to less protec-
tion than property of any other description. The only power
conferred is the power coup-led with the duty of- guarding and
protecting the owner in his rights.’ ” -

Complaining that the right to own slaves had been shame-
fully disregarded to the economic ruin of Tennessee, Dickin-
son continued: 1 1 .

“Extradition of thosewhose crimes grew out of the slavery
question was refused. Owners in pursuit of their own slaves
were indicted and incarcerated. Emissaries had been sent into
the Southern States to run off slaves and to arouse them to
servile war. Property amounting in value to millions of dol-
lars had been carried away by what was known as the ‘under-
ground railway.’ . . . 1

“Devastation swept over the State, and it was pros-trate and
its wealth destroyed. . . . ..

“The slave valuation in Tennessee in 1860 was $114,-
976,374-”

All this “property” in slaves was unlawfully conﬁscated, said
Dickinson, and the “property owners” impoverished. The
banks, with one exception, were forced in-to liquidation-

“But worse than all, Society was upheaved, property owners
were disfranchised, and the duties and responsibilities of
citizenship were thrust upon a people just emerged from
slavery."

That spokesman of the ruling class and his followers were
the type that the great Negro leader, the former slave, Frede-

16

 

 

rick Douglass, had in mind when he said some two’ years
earlier: 9

“They have had among them for centuries a peculiar institu-
tion, and that peculiar institution has stamped them as a
peculiar people. . . . ’

“A dead Negro is with them now, as before, a common jest.

“They care no more for the Negro’s rights to live than they
care for his rights to liberty, or his right to the ballot or any
other right. . . .

“They could always shoot, stab, hang and burn the Negro,
without any such remorse or shame as other men would feel
after committing such a crime.”*

To relieve the Negro, and the mass of white citizens of the

‘laboring classes, of “the responsibilities of citizenship” is -the

prime purpose of the political institution of lynching.

There were ﬁve Negroes lynched in Tennessee the follow-
ing year, 1897, and in the next year seven. The older Negroes
of Columbia can tell you of the lynching of William Chambers
at Bell Buckle, 35 miles east of the town, in August, 1899, one
of the two of that year in Tennessee. In 1900, of the 106
Negroes lynched in the United States six were killed by Ten-
nessee gangs. Next year there were nine in Tennesse, then
four, and four again in 1903.

But there came a sharp reversal of race relations in the
Tobacco War of 1904, when suddenly a vast organization of
both white and Negro tobacco growers spread through the
“Black Patch” of Kentucky and Tennessee, called “black” be-
cause a dark tobacco is raised there. The Black Patch had been
the ﬁrst part of the South to get back onto its economic legs
after the Civil War, when the manufacture of p-lug tobacco
became a factory industry and the dark brown leaves, rich in
nicotine, grown best in the Black Patch, commanded 7 cents
a pound. Tennesseans still tell you that 75,000 Yankee soldiers
who had learned to chew tobacco while occupying Northern
Tennessee, spread the fashion in the North and laid the basis
for the plug tobacco industry and the prosperity of the region.

"’ Why is the Negro Lynched?, by Frederick Douglass, about 1896. Re-
printed from A. M. E. Church Review.

17

 

But then came J. B. Duke to organize the Tobacco Trust,
which conspired with the British and French monopolies and
reduced the price. paid to the Tennessee farmers to 6 cents,
then to 5 cents, and in some places to 4 cents a pound. Typical-
ly, a branch of ‘the Tobacco Growers’ Protective Association
in Northern Tennessee called upon “every farmer, or farm
laborer, white or black,” to join “our organization” to ﬁght
the Tobacco Trust, which it declared “is a law-breaker, and as
such has no rights that we, as good citizens, ought to respect.”
This organization of many thousands, sometimes -calling them-
selves Night Riders and Possum Hunters (because they had
to do their political work at night) and including Negroes,
covered the tobacco country at ﬁrst to distribute handbills,
then later to stop trains, take off the buyers for the Tobacco
Trust and persuade them to buy tickets back to where they
came from.

After three years, Duke and the Trust got the best of the
Tobacco War, and the ﬁrst means of doing so was a wide agita-
tion to the effect that not the Tobacco Trust, but Negro
farmers and farm laborers were to blame for the economic
ruin. There was a furious struggle, and white gangs calling
themselves “Negro Chasers” supplanted the organizations that
had fought the Tobacco Trust. Across the Kentucky border,
in Marshall County, the “Negro Chasers” shot John Scruggs
and his baby'grand—daughter dead, and in Fulton county, ac-
cusing David Walker of “drawing a gun on a white man” and
“cursing a white woman,” they shot to death the six members
of the family, one by one.

A type of politician best adapted to ruling lynch-ridden
politics arose in Memphis. Ed Crump came into Tennessee
from Mississippi—a man of the same vintage as Bilbo and
Rankin; and Kenneth McKellar came from Alabama. Crump
became mayor of Memphis in 1910, and McKellar got into
Congress in 191 1. With the ratio of voting down to 48 per cent
in 1916, and 290,000 male citizens of voting age not voting,
McKellar was elected to the United States Senate by a majority
of 25,498. McKellar and Crump took up with a mule
auctioneer, Jim McC0rd, at Lewisburg, 21 miles southeast of

18

 

 

Columbia, who went into politics and was destined to become
mayor, then congressman, and then governor. More and more
laws were made against the right of franchise, and the voting
ratio fell to 31 percent in 192o, and then to 20 per cent in
1924. Only in Memphis could large numbers of votes be pro-
duced, not from voters, but from the crooked machine, which,
with so few voting, could always produce enough votes at the
last minute to turn the election.

In 1917 Eli Person was burned alive in Memphis, and Ligan
Scott was lynched in Dyer County. Sixty miles southeast of
Columbia, at Estill Springs, James Mcllherron was accused of
shooting a white man; he was tied to a tree, boxes from nearby
stores were broken up and piled around him and he was
burned alive. Rev. C. G. W. Lyle tried to do something for the
burning -man; but the pastor was himself hanged in the street.
At Lexington, Tenn., 87 miles west of ‘Columbia, Berry Noyes
was hanged by a mob.

After 57 Negro men and two Negro women were lynched
throughout tthe'South within the year 1921, seven of them
burned after being killed and four burned alive, a wave of
protest swept through the country, and in January, 1922, the
federal anti-lynching bill introduced by Congressman Dyer
passed the House. In the Senate, it was defeated in a ﬁli-
buster led by Senator McKellar of Tennessee. In May, while
the ﬁght was going on, B. Boling was taken out of the jail
at Huntersville, Tenn., and lynched.

In May, 1924, a young man who came apparently from
Western Tennessee was arrested at Columbia. He was charged
with having attempted to rape a young white girl, daughter of
M. S. Twomey, who runs the vegetable store at East Seventh
Street, just off the square, a block from Saul Blair’s barber

_ shop. On June 23, the young Negro was brought to trial in

 

the Maury County courthouse on the square. Those Negroes
are apparently correct who say there was no serious evidence
against Robert Wilson, and that Judge Thomas B. Lytle
charged the jury favorably for an acquittal. The all-white
jury nevertheless brought in a verdict of “Guilty” and ﬁxed a
penalty of two years in prison. The judge immediately said:

19

 

 

99

“It is ordered by the court that the verdict be set aside. . . .

Instantly a pistol shot rang out and Robert Wilson fell dead
in front of the judge’s desk. Davis J. (“Dacie”) Twomey, son
of M. S. Twomey and brother of the girl in the case, with
a smoking pistol in his hand, stood over the dead body.

A county work-house guard, Pillow Dew (remember the
name, you will hear it again), was waiting with handcuffs to
take the Negro to the chain-gang as soon as convicted. When
Wilson fell dead, Pillow Dew got up, put away the handcuffs
and went to the telephone. He called to the Morton Funeral
Home, «telling Mrs. Callie Morton to “send for a dead Negro.”
Mrs. Morton sent her 16-year-old son, James, with the hearse.

When the boy came into the courtroom and asked someone
to help him to carry the body, “Dacie” Twomey was standing
there, under arrest, and someone had gone to get him a law-
yer. The lawyer was Paul F. Bumpus. No one can recall for
a certainty, but it may be that James E. Morton and Bumpus
met there for the ﬁrst time. Twenty—two years later, Mr. Mor-
ton, now atall, digniﬁed man of 36, and Paul F. Bumpus, the
middle-aged, sallow-faced district attorney general, were to face
each other in the same courtroom, Bumpus standing on the
spot before the judge’s desk where the -blood of Robert Wilson
once stained the ﬂoor. I

“Dacie” Twomey was indicted for murder in the ﬁrst degree.
The young lawyer, Paul F. Bumpus, was employed to defend

‘him, and thereby a career was begun. In July of the next

year “Dacie” Twomey was tried, and an al1—white jury re-
turned the verdict: “Not guilty.”

Paul F. Bumpus became the leading lawyer of 'Maury County.

In December, 1924, a small band of armed white men en-
tered the city hospital at Nashville, 43 miles north of Colum-
bia, where a Negro boy of 15, mortally wounded, lay chained
to a bed; the boy had come to the aid of his uncle who was
threatened by some white men, and had himself been shot; he
was taken from the hospital and hanged. In 1926, a boy named
Bell was abducted from the jail at Dover, Tenn., and killed by
a white gang, and in the following year a Negro named Up-
church was shot to death by a posse at Paris, Tenn.

II

HENRYCHOATE WAS HAN GED
IN THE COURTHOUSE

In an obvious effort to help convict the 30 Negroes framed
up at Columbia, a New York newspaper quoted a proud boast
by an anonymous citizen of Co1umbia—“We haven't lynched
anybody here in 20 years.” The boast is doubly false. Two
of the most ﬁendish murders in all American history occurred
in Columbia in the past 20 years; one in the courthouse itself,
the other organized in the courthouse and performed in the
outskirts of the city. The lynching that the newspaper tried to
ﬁx as more than 20 years ago really occurred eighteenand a
half years ago. It was the murder of Henry Choate, age 18, who
was hanged from the west window of the courthouse in Colum-
bia on November 11, 1927. \

Henry Choate was the grandson o-f Henry Clay Harlan, who
lives some seven miles west of Columbia near the road to Wil-
liamsport, close to where he was born as a slave 85 years ago.
The grandson, who had been working as a road construction
laborer in Coffee County, came to visit his grandfather on
Armistice Day. While he was there a young woman of the
white Harlan family, living nearby, raised the alarm that a
man tried to seize hold of her in Hicks Lane, and she thought
the man was a Negro.

The white girl’s family called Sam Wiley, then sheriff of
Maury County, at Columbia, seven miles away. The sheriff
decided to make use of a pack of bloodhounds owned by a
deputy sheriff at Nashville named Ed Pugh. This was the most
famous pack of bloodhounds ever known to the Middle South
and it was habitually used in trailing fugitives in all of Ten-
nessee, Kentucky and northern Alabama. Whenever Ed Pugh’s
hounds were sent to Maury County, it was the custom to have

A21

 

 

 

them led by Bert Erwin, considered an expert in the art» of
trailing men with dogs, who became coroner of Maury County
through this art. Before the truck arrived with the blood-
hounds, some of the white planters went to Henry Clay Har-
lan’s house and called out the young man, Henry Choate,
Mr. Harlan’s grandson, whom they took before the white girl.
She did not identify him. Then the pack of bloodhounds came
and were given the scent at the place of the alleged attempt in
Hicks Lane. The bloodhounds did not lead to Henry Clay
Harlan’s home; the trail faded out in another direction, and
the white girl again said she did not recognize Henry Choate
as her assailan-t. But a man called “Little Steve” Jones told
the leader in charge of the hounds that he had seen Henry
Choate going into his grandfather's house from the direction
of Hicks Lane a few minutes after the crime. The man lead-
ing the hounds came to the Negro grandfather's house to ask

 

questions, accompanied by several other white men. He was ,

a short, heavy—set man. It may not have been ‘Bert Erwin, and
Bert Erwin denies that he led Ed Pugh’s hounds that time.
In asking questions, the hound-leader used bad language,
which caused Henry Clay Harlan to rise from his chair and
say to “the white men: “This is my house and I am boss here.
I reject him. I won’t stand his language. You order him to
shut up!” .

The man with the hounds and the other white men left.
But they took the boy Henry Choate with them, tied his arms
with ropes, led him over to Marvin Pickett’s house a few
hundred yards away and locked him in a room. Henry Clay
Harlan let down his pride and pleaded with Sam Wiley, the
sheriff, to promise not to let his grandson be lynched. Sam
Wiley promised. Some. white estate-owners came from sev-
eral miles around and held a kangaroo court in Pickett’s
house; they decided that Henry Choate must die.

At Columbia in the afternoon Sheriff Sam Wiley drove up
to the jail with Henry Choate, bound with ropes, in his car,
accompanied by several white men in other cars. Wiley locked
Henry Choate in the end cell in the rear of the jail, gave the
keys of the jailhouse to his wife and went away.

Mrs. Wiley came into the jail kitchen, looking excited.
Mrs. Ella Gant, the Negro cook of the jail, asked “Mrs. Wiley,
what is it?” Mrs. Wiley said, “Ella, I hate this.” Mrs. Gant
insisted on knowing what it was, and Mrs. Wiley said “They
are going to mob this boy they brought in. There was a ter-
rible rape, and now they’re going to do this. Go and tell
the boy to pray, because they’re going to kill him sure.” Mrs.
Ella Gant went and took a pack of cigarettes to Henry Choate,
and told him, “Boy, Mrs. Wiley says you’d better pray, be-
cause the mob is coming to lynch you.” The boy looked at her
and said, “I know they are,” but he didn’t pray. Mrs. Gant
says he was not afraid, but walked around the cell holding
himself proud.

Mrs. Gant saw Mrs. \/Viley hide the jail keys behind a laun-

dry bag and then go to look out on the street which was packed
with white men. The ﬁrst deputy sheriff, Pratt, came to Mrs.
Wiley and asked “Where’s the keys?” and Mrs. Wiley said
“Never mind where the keys are, that mob ain’t going to get
’em.” Pratt said “Well, if you don't give them the keys they
are going to dynamite the jail, and they’ll get him anyway.”
Mrs. Wiley went out on the porch and looked at the crowd
and said “You all go away; I am not going -to see an innocent
boy hung."

Old man Shackley was in the crowd, and he turned and went
toward the powerhouse and came back with a big sledge ham-

tmer. He raised the hammer and smashed at the jail door.

Mrs. Gant thought she saw the door begin to give. Deputy
Pratt called out again “They’re going to dynamite the jail and
kill a lot of peop-le.” Mrs. Wiley looked frightened and was

shaking; she said “There’s no need to let them kill all those

people just to save one man,” and she walked back to the
laundry bag and got the keys and gave them to Pratt.

Pratt unlocked the door, and the crowd came pouring in,
took the keys and unlocked the last cell, saying “Come out,
Choate.” Henry Choate walked out of the cell and . . . . . . . (1)*
had the sledge hammer and hit him on the head. Mrs.
Gant saw some white men put a rope on his neck as he lay on
the jail ﬂoor, and they dragged him out and up to a car in the
street; but the man in the car yelled “N 0, you can't drag him
on my car!” They found another car, tied the rope on the
bumper and drove to the courthouse, dragging the dead boy
by the neck.

They carried him up the steps to the same courtroom where
now James Stephenson and Mrs. Stephenson, Sol Blair, the
Rev. Calvin Lockridge and the young veterans of World
War ‘II were arraigned for trial for preventing a lynching-—
eighteen and a half years later. '

They fastened the loose end of the rope to the judge's desk
and pushed Henry Choate’s dead body out of the west window
to hang. ‘ -

In the morning a policeman, Willis White, came to the Ne-
gro funeral home of Mrs. A. J. Morton 8: Son and called Mrs.
Morton, saying “There’s a dead Negro at the courthouse; come
and get him.”. Mrs. Morton sent her son, James E. Morton,
who is now the leading undertaker in Columbia and a defend-
ant in the present case, but who was then very young. He
drove the Negro hearse over to the courthouse. On the ﬂoor
of the rotunda he found the stiff body of Henry Choate, and
a few people looking down at it; one policeman had brought
his wife to see it.

This was all told to me by living witnesses.

At Union City, 162 miles away, at 2:30 in the afternoon of
April 17, 1931, more than a hundred armed men opened the
Obion County jail and hanged George Smith in the court-
house. The rope was left dangling in the -courthouse for sev-
eral weeks as a symbol of race relations.

THE CASTRATION AND MURDER
OF CORDIE CHEEK

Cordie Cheek was a 17-year-old son of a railroad section
hand, living at Glendale, a crossroa-ds village of 1oo inhabit-

.ants ﬁve miles south of the courthouse square of Columbia.

The boy's father, Fate Cheek, was employed by the L. 8c N.
Railroad, and his mother, Mrs. Tennessee Cheek, worked for
a white family named Moore. As a midwife, Mrs. Cheek had
attended the births of the Moore children, and as a domestic
servant she had raised them, including Henry Carl Moore who
was two years older than her own son, Cordie Cheek. The
white mother died in 1929 and the father committed suicide
in 1932. After that, Mrs. Cheek arranged for her boy Cordie
to do chores around -the Moore place.

In November, 1933, the Negro boy, then 17, demanded some
overdue wages from the 19-year-old white boy, and a ﬁght en-
sued. The white boy was defeated. Another white boy, who
also had had an unsuccessful scrimmage with Cordie Cheek,
intervened in the quarrel to demand that the Negro boy here-
after call the -two white boys “mister.” Cordie angrily refused,
but resumed his work, while Henry Carl Moore, with a bruised
face, went down to the general store to tell his story and get
sympathy. The storekeeper and some chums of the white boy
gathered about him and one of them said: “The Negro’s got to
be taught not to get ‘biggity.’ ” Telephone calls were made to
the village of Culleoka, five miles away, and to Columbia‘, and
soon a hundred men and boys had heard that Henry Carl
Moore had been beaten up by a Negro, and were crowding
into Hancock's general store.

C. Hayes Denton, a magistrate of Maury County, who is an
uncle of Henry Carl Moore, heard about it and drove down

26

 

 

 

 

to Hancock's store, where he began organizing the men and
boys with the aid of Dawes Hancock, the storekeeper, and the
storekeeper’s son, Robert Hancock, who was postmaster and
conducted the post ofﬁce in his father's store.

The Negro boy, unaware that this was happening, continued
chopping ﬁrewood until ﬁve o’clock, discussed his next day’s
work with Moore’s elder married sister and then walked the
short distance home to supper. But a Negro employee of Han-
cock’s store came running to -tell him to leave quick, as he
had overheard the word “lynching” in a conversation between
Henry Carl Moore and Bob Han-cock, in the store.

Cordie left his supper, ran across ﬁelds and down the rail-
road track, and made his way through ravines and woods
the 14 miles to a plantation where his brother—in-law was em-
ployed by Joel Cheatham, a former railroad man. He-hid in
Cheatham’s cornﬁeld.

After Cordie’s hasty departure, Mrs. Tenny Cheek took her
daughter Annie Pillow with her to the store to ask the white
men what they wanted Cordie for. Henry Carl Moore was
there and asked Mrs. Cheek where -Cordie was; when she said

she didn’t know he slapped her. Hayes Denton stepped up _

and told Mrs. Cheek and her daughter to go into the post oﬂice
part of the store, where he locked them in; then he told some
of the men to go and search their home. Bob Hancock, the
postmaster, Dawes Hancock, the storekeeper, Henry Carl
Moore, James Douglas, “Red” Miller and a man named
Murphy went to Mrs. Cheek’s home and found her son-in-
law, Bob Pillow, in the house. One of them drew a pistol
to make Bob Pillow tell where Cordie Cheek was, but Pillow
said “You’ll just have to shoot; I can’t tell where a man is

after he’s gone in the dark.” These white men went away, but

others kept coming through the night.

The last to come looking for Cordie Cheek was Bert Erwin,
coroner of Maury County. With him was Cecil Voss. They
captured Isaiah Pillow, took him to the general store and put
him between the hot s-tove and the wall to make him tell where
Cordie Cheek went, but he didn’t tell.

About 6 o’clock Henry Carl Moore remembered that at four

o'clock Cordie Cheek had brought an armful of ﬁrewood into
the house for Henry’s 11-year-old sister, named Lady Anne
Moore, to make a ﬁre, and that a splinter of -the wood had
tom the dress of the girl in passing. Henry Carl Moore told
the men in the store that he had heard his little sister remon-
strate with Cordie Cheek for -tearing her dress.

About seven o'clock, Joel Cheatham heard a knock on his
door, took his shotgun, opened a crack in the door and asked
who was there. It was Dawes Hancock, who seemed to Cheat-
ham to be very drunk; he said Cordie Cheek had tried to rape
a girl and that a mob, accompanied by Claude I. Godwin,
the sheriff, was coming -to look for Cordie. The telephone
rang and Deputy Sheriff Pillow Dew was on the wire, phoning
from Glendale to ask Cheatham’s permission to search his
plantation “because one of your Negroes married Cordie
Cheek’s sister, and he might be hiding on your place.” Cheat-
ham consented, but he felt bad about it, and late in the
night he drove to the store at Glendale where he found C.
Hayes Denton and asked him what was going on. Denton re-
plied that Cordie Cheek had attempted to rape Lady Anne
Moore and that the mob intended -to catch and hang him.
“Some of the boys” wanted to burn Cordie alive, he said, but
he had forbidden the burning and there would only be a hang-
ing; he pointed out the tree where he said the boy would be
hanged. ‘

Mr. Cheatham drove hurriedly back to his home, -told_ his
farm hand, Cordie’s brother-in-law, to hide Cordie in a sink-
hole in the woods; then drove to the courthouse in Columbia.
He found the sheriff's office occupied only by a deputy named
Witherspoon who was known popularly as “the honest deputy”
to distinguish him from the general run of men that held jobs
under Sheriff Godwin. Cheatham took Witherspoon into his
conﬁdence and the two drove to the plantation, called Cordie
out of the sink-hole and took him to Pulaski, where the Sheriff
of Giles‘Coun-ty promised not to give him to the mob and,
with Cordie’s consent, locked him in the jail.

The mob at -Glendale heard about it and came in a caval-
cade of automobiles to the public square in Columbia where

28

 

 

they were allowed the use of the courthouse. There, in the
courtroom, from the window of which Henry Choate had
been hanged, the mob held a meeting and organized -to go to
Pulaski. At Pulaski, when they arrived, they found the
sheriff unwilling to let them come into the jail to get Cordie
Cheek. The mob returned to Columbia, complaining that
the sheriff at Pulaski “would kill a white man to protect a
prisoner.”

Cordie Cheek was soon moved to the Davidson County jail at
Nashville. His mother went to C. Hayes Denton and asked
him to promise that Cordie would not be lynched. C. Hayes
Denton promised her he wouldn't allow it.

The Maury County grand jury met at Columbia to indict
Cordie Cheek. After long consideration the foreman of the
grand jury announced that no evidence was offered to support
any charge and that there would be no indictment.

Then the lynching of Cordie Cheek was organized by offi-
cials of Maury and Davidson counties.

From the Maury County sheriff's ofﬁce someone -telephoned
Sheriff Bauman of Davidson County and asked him to release
Cordie Cheek, because the grand jury had found no true bill.
Bauman refused to do it without an official request in writing;
and a letter from Sheriff Godwin was delivered to him the
next morning saying the grand jury had failed to indict
Cordie Cheek and he should be released.

But Cordie Cheek was not immediately allowed to go. In
Bauman’s oﬂice in Nashville, Dep-uty Sheriff Ed Pugh, the
owner of the famous pack of bloodhounds, took charge.

Deputy Sheriff Ed Pugh's best friend was Bert Erwin, coro-
ner of Maury County. Pugh often said he “would do any-
thing for Bert Erwin,” who had befriended him several times
by leading his bloodhounds, thereby making $1,500 for him.

Pugh interviewed Cordie, explaining the danger of going
back to Columbia, and asked Cordie where he would go. Cor-

‘ die answered that he would go to the home of his uncle in

 

Nashville. A Pugh asked Cordie where "his uncle lived, and
Cordie said at 1614 Jackson Street. One of the deputies gave
Cordie streetcar fare. . ’

29

 

 

Ed Pugh telephoned to Bert Erwin in Columbia -that Cordie
Cheek would be released at four”“ o’clock and would arrive
at his uncle’s home at 1614 Jackson Street in Nashville about
20 minutes after four.

In Columbia, at two o’clock, Cordie’s father saw Henry Carl
Moore getting into Bob Hancock’s car, where Hancock was sit-
«ting at the wheel. During the afternoon . . . . . . . . (2)** went to
Lewisburg and bought a rope and a step ladder at Hardison’s
store.

At Nashville Cordie Cheek was held in jail until four

 

o’clock, then released, and boarded a streetcar, reaching his

uncle’s home at 4: 15. a

At 4:30 “two automobiles stopped in front of the Cheek’s
home and seven white men got out. Mrs; Leona Cheek, Cor-
di-e’s aunt, opened the door, and Bert Erwin stepped in with
a pistol in his hand. Bob Hancock followed with a shotgun.
Behind them, in front of the house were Henry Carl Moore,
.  .  . . (3), . . . . . . . . (4), “Red” Miller and . . . . . . . . (5)”“"“’*‘
with shotguns and pistols. ’ p _

Bert Erwin asked “Is this the ‘home of Cheek?” .Mrs. Leona
Cheek was too upset to speak, and her son, Rush Cheek, came
out of the kitchen and said, “Yes, sir.” Erwin ask-ed “Is Cordie
Cheek here?” ‘Cordie walked from the kitchen into the front
room and said, “I am Cordie Cheek.” Bob Hancock pointed
his shotgun at Cordie. Hilary Cheek, a cousin of Cordie, came.
Henry Carl Moore stopped him at the door and covered him
with a pistol. Bert Erwin said to Cordie, ‘fConsider yourself
under arrest,” and called to the men in front of the house,
“Here he is; come in and get him.” Dixie Stones, 18 years old,
a relative of the Cheek family, came up and saw Henry Carl
Moore, whom she had known all her life, step up onto the
running board of one of the -cars with a pistol. -
E In a restaurant diagonally across Jackson Street, ‘two Negro
girlstudents of Fisk University became suspicious and wrote

down the numbers "of the license plates of the two automobiles:
No. 79-297 and No. 71-373. The two numbers belonged to
Magistrate C. Hayes Denton and Postmaster Robert Hancock
of Glendale.

Denton’s and Hancock’s automobiles drove away wi-th Cordie
Cheek in the rear car and Henry Carl Moore standing on the
running board with a pistol in his hand. '

An hour and a half later the two automobiles and two others
drew up near a tall cedar tree on the Culleoka road near the
fork of the Lewisburg pike, ﬁve miles southeast of the court-
house at Columbia. Bert Erwin, Henry Carl Moore, . . . . . . (6),*
and one, or possibly two, other white men got out and pulled
Cordie Cheek from one of the cars. They took out a step-
ladder and a rope. One or two men got into one of the cars
and drove away. The others walked‘Cordie Cheek over to
-the cedar tree and put the rope around his neck. There they
waited, nearly half an hour.

Someone in -C. Hayes Denton’s home began telephoning to

 

many neighbors, telling them to come to the tall cedar tree K

on the Culleoka road near the abandoned gas station, because
Cordie Cheek was going to be hanged. The telephones of
Glendale and Culleoka are party lines and the ‘housewives
listen in to every call. Mrs. W. C. Boatwright heard the voice
issuing the invitations and recognized it as that of C. Hayes
Denton.

Out on the Culleoka road under the tall cedar tree, four
white men holding Cordie Cheek saw headlights coming down
the Lewisburg pike. Bert Erwin left the group and ran out
onto the fork of the roads to hail the -car. It was Charley
Lunn’s hauling truck returning to Lewisburg, driven by a
Negro boy, James L. Garrett of Chapel Hill. On the seat of
the truck with Garrett were” two white passengers, Andrew
Allen and Allen’s son.

Bert Erwin stood in the road signalling for the truck -to

stop. Garrett, the driver, told about it afterward in an aili-
davit, in this way: I

“A man waved our truck down and said ‘stop.’ I saw
three cars parked by the side of the road and thought per-
haps there had been an accident or a car was broke down
or out of gas or something.

“He said ‘Do you want to see us kill this Negro?’

“I said ‘No,’ sir,'I don’t care to.’

“He said ‘I don’t care whether you Want to or not, you
are going to do it. Stop your motor and turn off your
lights. We are going to show you boys something about
these things.’ ”

Erwin made him start his motor again and pull up a little
on the Culleoka road within easy sight of the tree.

In making an afﬁdavit a few weeks later, Garrett was asked
questions and gave replies under oath as follows:

Q. “How many people did you see other than those
with you?”

A. “I saw four.”

. “How many cars did you see?”

A. “There was three or four——no, sir, I ‘think there was
three. . . 

Q. “Where was the man who stopped you?”

A. “He was out in the road where the car was passing.
He waved us down. . . . He was rather heavy set. About
40 or a li-t-tle older. I guess he was about five feet, seven
or eight, and he had rather broad shoulders and was
solemn-like. . . .”

Q. “Did you see anybody else?”

A. “Yes, sir, there was a tall, thin-like person and two
shorter thin-like ones. . . . They were standing with Cordie
over by the sedan near the tree. . . . The tall fellow and the
short one had pistols. . . ‘. They had hold of Cordie.”

Q. “Where was the other one?”

A. “He was standing around and beside the shorter
one.” . . . A

Q. “What was Cordie doing?”

A. “He was standing by the car.”

Q. “Was he tied?”

A. “Yes, sir, his hands was tied behind -his back with a
strong rope and they had a rope around his neck. It was

a big rope. They had the rope up on "a limb,of the tree
and a stepladder about four feet high under the limb of
the tree.” m » »

Q. “What was Cordie doing?”

A. “He was standing -there trembling.”

A. “No, sir, he did not say anything.”

Q. “Did he ask any questions? -Was he crying?”

Q. “Where was the heavy-set man’ who stopped you?”

A. “He was in behind. He pulled the rope up tight
and fastened it around the tree.”

ladder?” ‘

A. “Yes, sir.”

Q. “Then what happened?”

A. “Then the heavy-set man took a pole and pushed
against Cordie’s hips like and pushed him off the step
ladder and hung him. Then the ‘tall fellow shot at him
and the short fellow shot at him. Then they passed the
pistols around and lots of people shot at him.”

Q. “Did anybody hear the shooting?”

A. “Yes, sir, a neighbor in a house nearby opened his
door and said ‘What’s going on down there?’ ”

Q. “Did anybody say anything?”

A. “They formed a circle and went around and looked
a-t him. Then they began to get in their cars and go

you?"
A. “No, sir.”

Q. “Do you think you would know the man who
stopped you if you saw him?”
A. ‘‘I don’t know, sir. But, yes, I think I would.”

Bert Erwin drove back to his home and waited there until
the telephone rang and someone asked for the coroner and
told him “There’s a dead body hanging on a tree on the
Culleoka road.” Then he drove out again and backed his car
under_the cedar tree and cut the rope; with the body in the
car, he drove to Columbia.
Long after midnight, probably 3 A.M., he got out of his car

at the A.  Morton 8c Son Funeral Home, rang the bell, waking »
Mrs. Morton, and called out “Open up; I've got a dead body

for you.” .

Mrs. Morton stood behind the closed door and screamed:
“You killed him; now you go ‘and bury him!”

Bert Erwin got back into his car and drove to another
funeral establishment run by another member of the Morton
family, where the body of Cordie Cheek was taken in.

Up in Nashville, Mrs. Leona Cheek worried about Cordie,
wondering why he didn’t come back. She telephoned to the
medicine store in Columbia run by Mr. Julius Blair, and got
Mr. Blair’s son, Charlie, on the phone, asking if he had
heard. anything of Cordie. Charlie Blair told her “Yes, Cordie
is dead, and his body has just been brought in in the rumble-
seat of a car.”

Cordie’s father, Mr. Fate Cheek, did not know until next
morning when he me-t Mr. Morton on the street and was told
he'd better go to see the coroner.

When Mr. Cheek came in, Bert Erwin looked up and said:

“Well, Fate, they killed your boy last night.”

Mr. Cheek stood silent. He knew right away who had done
It.

Bert Erwin asked “Do you want the county to furnish a
coffin?” Mr. Cheek could not answer. Bert Erwin took up the
telephone, called some number and said: “Get a coffin ready.”
He remarked that the county allowed only $12 for a box for
burying paupers, but that he wanted them to ﬁx up a nice cofﬁn
for Fate Cheek’s boy.

Mr. Cheek asked to see the body, but Erwin said it was not
allowed.

An inquest was held. Bert Erwin presided as coroner. The
verdict was that Cordie Cheek died at the hands of persons
unknown.

On the day after the lynching, Bob Hancock, postmaster of
Glendale, went to a restaurant where  P. Hardison was em-
ployed in Columbia and asked him to take care of a pistol,
saying “This is the pistol that killed Cordie Cheek.”

Henry Carl Moore, who had a job on the county road
crew, talked to the other men on the crew all day about the
lynching and told them how Ed Pugh informed Bert Erwin
of Cordie Cheek’s release.

The Nashville Pastors’ Association, sick with horror, met at
the Y.M.C.A., protested against “the ruthless onslaught of
mob violence” and urged the governor “to summon afresh
all officials of Davidson and Maury counties to bring the
guilty in this crime to speedy justice.” They didn't realize
that there were plenty of officials of Maury county at the cas-
tration and hanging of Cordie Cheek: a magistrate, a coroner,
a postmaster, a deputy sheriff and a constable, and that a
deputy sheriff of Davidson County was there in spirit.

“HUSH! ”

The girl students who had taken the numbers of the auto-
mobiles of C. Hayes Denton and Robert Hancock raised an
alarm in Fisk Uzniversity. Fury broke loose and a mass meet-
ing of students in the chapel decided on a protest march
to the State House in Nashville. _

A counter-movement was started. The students were re-
buked by some of their elders of the faculty for pursuing what
was called mistaken tactics.

This was December, 1933, in the ﬂood-tide of the great
struggle to save the lives of the nine Negro boys condemned
to death at Scottsboro, Alabama, on a false charge of “rape."
The parents of the “Scottsboro boys,” after eight of the nine
had been sentenced to die, had placed the case in the hands
of the Communist Party. The Communists had started a huge
campaign that spread to Europe and South America, Asia and
around the world. A _

As the agitation swelled, the United States Supreme Court
acted ‘to order a new trial, and some of the boys were tried
again, and again sentenced to die. One of the boys, Heywood
Patterson, after having been twice sentenced to death, was
again condemned to die along with another boy, Clarence
Norris, in a third trial in November, 1933, a few days before
the Cordie Cheek lynching in Tennessee. Every great city
in the world was ringing with the cry of mass demonstra-
tions: “Scottsboro Boys—Shall Not Die!” Timid or conservative
leaders were ‘appalled by the power and volume of the move-
ment, saying the Communists were appealing to the masses not
to permit the verdicts of the courts to be carried out, and they
thought this would only antagonize the courts and would do
no good. A .

The students of Fisk University had been profoundly stirred

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Robert Minor, the author of this pamphlet, was born in
San Antonio, Texas, where he ﬁrst joined a trade union-
Local 717 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners, A. F. of L., in 1904. Connected with the labor move-
ment throughout his life, he is one of the founders and veteran

. leaders of the Communist Party. Minor was chief organizer

of the defense committee of A. F. of L. unions in .1916, which
led the successful ﬁght to save the life and win the freedom of
Tom Mooney, organizer of the streetcar men of San Francisco,
who was framed up by the “open shop” employers on the false
charge of murder. In 1930, Minor, together with William Z.
Foster, chairman of the Communist Party, and Israel Amter,
was a leader of the great movement of the American workers
for unemployment relief. In 1931 he was placed by the Com-
munist Party in chief responsibility for the campaign to save
the lives of the nine innocent Negro boys framed up on
false charges at Scottsboro, Alabama. At present he is the
Secretary of the Legislative Committee of the -Communist
Party. His most recent pamphlet is Tell the People How
Ben Davis Was Elected.

by the vast movement for the Scottsboro boys, but were shaken
and divided by the controversy. The committee elected by
the mass meeting to arrange the protest march to the State
House were persuaded to cancel the whole arrangement and
suppress all public action. In the words of one of the faculty,
the decision was “to leave no stone unturned to get the law to
act in the case and that efforts should be focused in this direc-
tion, rather than in making a public demonstration. . . ”

“It was decided if, after having expended every possible ef-
fort toward getting the law to act, nothing happened, full
proceedings in the case would be published.” If? The infor-
mation they had was not published, but quietly given to
Deputy Sheriff Ed Pugh in Sheriff Bauman’s office and to the
district attorney, and no public demonstration was made.

At a banquet in East Nashville, the District Attorney of
Davidson County, who would have charge of any action of t:he
law, made a speech saying that, no matter what happened,
he would not prosecute anybody who might be indicted for the
lynching of Cordie Cheek. In Columbia Sheriff Godwin
said “Nobody in Maury County seems to be sorry that the
Negro was killed. They are only sorry it was done so crude.”

The University faculty and trustees and the Interracial Com-
mittee “called upon. some of the leading citizens to organize
support for the law enforcing agencies. . . .” As the ﬁrst mem-
ber and guiding spirit of such a committee they chose Mr.
James G. Stahlman, publisher of the Nashville Banne1'—then
engaged in vigorous denunciation of “the reds” for stirring up
the Negroes to save the Scottsboro boys.

The “leading citizens” headed by Stahlman “contacted”
Senator McKellar. McK.ellar said he “deplored” the hanging
of Cordie Cheek and “hoped the local courts” would “do
something,” but he had “gone into this whole lynching prob-
lem some years ago when the federal'anti-lynching bill was be-
fore Congress and had concluded at that time that the federal
government could do nothing about it until there was an
amendment to the Constitution.” He thoroughly approved
the “sane” course that the committee was taking.

The committee also “contactet ” the governor who agreed

38

to offer $1,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of anyone
guilty of the murder of Cordie Cheek. Immediately 34 wit-
nesses, 25 Negro and nine white, came forward to testify.
Twelve were eye-witnesses able to identify the men they saw
in various acts of the lynching, from kidnapping to the castra-
tion and hanging.

A grand jury met at Columbia, all white men and friends
of C. Hayes Denton and Bert Erwin. It summoned Claude I.
Godwin, C. Hayes Denton, Robert Hancock, Austin»Harlan,
Henry Carl Moore, “Dad” Gilliam, \A7alter Fitzgerald, jack
Cathey and “Pee V/Vee” Howell. They all laughed at the
grand jury summons, and many merchants and bankers signed
a list to make bond for anybody who might be indicted. Sheriff
Godwin was the only one of these who testified, and he came
out saying, “Hayes Denton is one of our best citizens.”

The witnesses were shunted around; deputy sheriffs with
guns strapped on, Austin Harlan among them, constantly
pushed through the assembled Negro witnesses. The chief
bootlegger of Columbia stood around the entrance to the grand
jury room and said, “I don’t believe the word of a Negro
should be taken against the word of a white man.” A

Two grand juries in succession met in Davidson County,
where the kidnapping occurred, and one in Maury County.
They dragged the matter toward oblivion. The grand jury
in Columbia came to the conclusion that there was no need to
go beyond the coroner’s verdict, rendered by Bert Erwin,
that Cordie Cheek came to his death at the hands of “parties
unknown.” From New York, the secretary of the National. As-
sociation for the Advancement of Colored People, Mr. Walter
White, telegraphed to the Tennessee governor his protest
against the obvious fraud~—whereupon the chairman of the
committee of “leading citizens” joined the governor in de-
nouncing Walter White for “outside interference.” The Inter-
racial Committee, “having heard repeated condemnations of
outside interference in the Scottsboro case,” as one of its
members said, and ﬁnding the “leading citizens’ committee”
it had set up as a substitute for action was on the other side

39

  

 

of the ﬁght, began to suspect that it had fallen into a cold-
blooded swindle. '

McKellar let it get around that he was “convinced that Cor-
die Cheek was guilty” and therefore “nothing should be done.”
In this you see the code of the lynch gangs. This justiﬁcation
of lynch murders had its classic expression in the U. S. Sen-
ate on August 25, 1919, by James F. Byrnes, then Senator from
South Carolina, who said:  . . the mob very rarely, if ever,
does violence to any but the guilty Negro.”«

Decent citizens of Columbia and Nashville were enraged
and tried again to force an indictment. Word ﬂew around
Nashville that Rush Cheek, cousin of Cordie Cheek, who wit-
nessed the kidnapping and could identify nearly all of the
principle lynchers, was going to be given a hearing before a
grand jury. But what happens to Negroes who are going
to testify to the crimes of white men?

On a night in June, while Rush Cheek was undressing to
go to bed, four white men with pistols walked into his home
without knocking. One of the men, a scrap of paper in his
hand, pretended to be reading a warrant, of arrest for stealing
automobile tires and a victrola, but on Rush Cheek’s pointing
out that he had neither a car nor a victrola, the man sighted
a mandolin in the room and said “That’s what you stole;
you are under arrest, come with me.”

So it was that Cordie’s cousin, Rush Cheek, was kidnapped
and taken down the same road to Columbia. On the way the

two men asked Rush if he was at his home on the night Cordie .

Cheek was kidnapped and whether he could identify the men
who took Cordie. Rush Cheek did some quick thinking and
said yes,_he had been present, but that he could not identify
the kidnappers. Then the men told him there was not go-
ing to be much to his case; he was kept in the jail at Columbia
a day anda half, his family made to pay some money for
which no receipt was given, and Rush Cheek was released.
Rush Cheek made aﬂidavit that the_ two men who took him
to Columbia were Gerald Hawkins and Austin Harlan, and
the other two who came with them to his home appeared to be
Nashville de-tectives. -

The incident reveals the pattern for handling Negro wit-
nesses of white men's crimes; watch and you will see it again
and again.

_ The McKellar machine took the Cordie Cheek case as proof
that there should be no federal anti-lynching law——for, under
it, “a Negro’s word might be taken against a white man’s
word,” they said.

The Tennessee governor of the time, Hill McAlister, agreed
with the Senator that there was no time for further inquiry
into the Cordie Cheek matter. There couldn’t be any indict-
ment or trial forced upon the authorities unless the newspapers
made a public exposure, and the publishers all said they
couldn’t lawfully publish anything unless there was an in-
dictment or trial.
ments of the best men and women of Tennessee from which
I have drawn these facts went into the dust to await an
Armageddon. ‘

And the Armageddon has come; it has to be fought out now
and the lynchers beaten. ' -

Complaints were made to the new President Roosevelt that
an automobile belonging to the U. S. postmaster at Glendale
had been used in la lynching; the New Deal President disre-
garded the patronage rights of Senator McKel1ar, and Bob
Hancock lost his post oﬂice job. Hancock became morose,
saying he couldn’t keep his mind off the lynching of Cordie
Cheek, and “I only punched him once or twice.” But W. L.
Boatwright heard him say “The mistake we made was in going
to Nashville in the.daytime, and in not putting mud on our
license plates.”

And then there arose two legends in Maury County, both
of which, I am sure, are untrue. The Hancocks, father and
son, used to drive every day or so the ﬁve miles between the
store at Glendale and the public square at Columbia, passing
the fork of the Lewisburg pike and the Culleoka road and the
tall cedar tree. The ﬁrst legend is that one evening as the
shadows fell, they. saw ahead a -big black old-fashioned car
coming toward them slowly down the middle of the two-lane
road. Thev blew their horn and got on the right edge of the

41

   

And all of the affidavits and heartfelt state--

 

road to let it pass. But the big black car deliberately turned
with them to bar the way and they had to stop. Four large
Negro men got out, opened the Hancocks’ car door and had a
talk with them that has never been repeated. Dawes Hancock
gave up his store at Glendale and moved into.Columbia. Bob
Hancock left Tennessee.

Mfhat is wrong with this story? First, that it is only a wish-
ful legend; it didn’t happen, and is based on a vaguely,sin1ilar
real incident experienced by other persons. Secondly, it is a
very poor legend because it gives expression to the meek and
submissive notion that, for the murder of a Negro, an adequate
penalty is to be compelled to leave the county, instead of capi-
-tal punishment under criminal law.

The other legend, equally untrue, is that the Hancocks,
father and son, died in a collision with another car on the
Culleoka road close to the tall cedar tree. This also did not
happen.

A few years ago someone came in the night and cut down
the tall cedar tree and hauled it away. I drove out and found
the stump overgrown with weeds and vines.

 

 

 

V
“IN THE FUTURE AS IN THE PAST”——-?

Otherwise life in Columbia settled down as though to con-
tinue in the future as in the past. Deputy Sheriff Witherspoon
lost his job in the sheriff’s office. Bert Erwin was promoted
in the road department while he continued as coroner, which
he remains today. C. Hayes Denton continued as magistrate,
becoming more than ever the symbol of authority and leader
of civic affairs. Pillow Dew became road superintendent.
Claude Godwin, the one-time sheriff, died. John Fleming,
one of his deputies, father of seven sons, retired. Some Ne-
groes got into the illegal liquor trade, and a bootlegger, said to
be a Negro, shot and killed Eugene Fleming, deputy sheriff,
brother of John. Paul F. Bumpus, who had been attorney for

‘ “Dacie” Twomey in 192 5, thrived in his profession and became

district attorney general for Maury and several other counties.

In Hatcher’s Lane, on the west side of Columbia, a part of
the body of a man was found in a hog—pen; most of the ﬂesh
was eaten by the hogs; the skin was black. At Manchester,
50 miles east of Columbia, on June 24, 1934, some white men
forced their way into a dance of young Negro people and made
free to lay hands on a girl. Richard Wilkerson struck one of
the white men with his ﬁst while rescuing the girl. On his
way home from the dance, Wilkerson was captured by eight
white men, who shot him and beat his head to pieces with a.n
axe“. A storm of rage arose among the Negro people, and
some officials said they thought the unrest among Negroes was
due to ideas put into their heads by the Communists in the
Scottsboro campaign. The eight white men were arrested and
convicted, not of murder but of manslaughter, and sentenced
to prison. Murmurs went around that the murdered Negro
was, after all, guilty of striking a white man; and people who

43

   
 

 

tried to learn whether the convicted white men ever served
their terms in prison found no record of it.

In December, at Shelbyville, 42 miles southeast of Columbia,
a white gang tried to lynch E. K. Harris, and the governor be-
came alarmed and called out the militia; the white mob
burned the courthouse and the militia killed three of them.

At White Bluff, an hour’s drive northwest of Columbia, in
November, 1935, a constable turned over Baxter Bell to a gang
of ﬁve white men, who shot him dead; the ﬁve white men were
acquitted by an all-white jury. Albert Gooden was hanged
by some “1eading white citizens” at Covington, in August,
1937; the grand jury investigated, established the identity of
the leaders of the mob, but refused to disclose the names. and
dropped the matter without indictment. ' S

In Washington, in January, 1940, Senator McKellar an-
nounced that a crisis had arisen. A “critical situation,” he
said, faced the «country through the danger that the Wagner
Anti-Lynching Bill might pass the Senate. In a Senate Com-
mittee hearing, in March, he read letters from governors of

Southern States such as one from Dixon, of Alabama, de-A

nouncing any attempt to pass a federal anti-lynching law as

infringing “the right of any people toconduct their own

affairs.”

McKellar called before the Senate committee the assistant
attorney general of Tennessee, Nat Tipton, who testiﬁed on
lynching in the states below the Mason and Dixon line. But
Mr. Tipton cracked a joke that made the Senators laugh; he
said that that line between the North and the South is “some-
times facetiously referred to as the ‘Smith 8c Wesson’ line."

‘The hanging and burning of Negroes was no affair of the fed-

eral government below that line, was his meaning. That was
in March, 1940. The ﬁlibuster in the Senate, led by McKellar
of Tennessee, defeated the anti-lynching bill.

As the -time for registration for the national election of 1940
approached, Elbert Williams at Brownsville, Tenn., headed a
movement to get Negroes to vote; in June he ‘was kidnapped
and shot and his body thrown into the Hatchie River. In

44

 

 

August, at Dyersburg, Roosevelt Jones was shot to death by
officers who said he was suspected of stealing.

From 1919 to 1940 Tennessee has had an average of one
recorded lynching per year for 20 years—-a total of 203 recorded
in the 75 years which the Columbia Daily Herald says must be
the pattern for the next three-quarters of a century.

Two sets of young men, one white, one black, went to the
Second World War from Maury County. James Stephenson
was only 17, but his mother, Mrs. Gladys Stephenson, by writ-
ing a letter, got him into the Navy where he wanted to be if
they would let a Negro be a sailor. The seven sons of john
Fleming went into the Army and the Navy, one died in action
in the Paciﬁc and six re-turned. One of those who returned
was Flo Fleming, who became a state highway policeman and
then ran as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for
sheriff in the primary election last October, against Sheriff  J.
Underwood. The population of the county is 40,3 57, of whom
about 22,000 are citizens of voting age; but, what with poll tax
and white primaries and a half century of pressure, the total
of votes cast was less than 3,000. Flo Fleming won the Demo-
cratic party nomination by 13 votes. The Negro vote of C0-
lumbia is potentially about 1,800; it was not cast.

‘ Flo Fleming’s brother, William Fleming, came home from
the Navy and got a job in Castner 8c Knott’s electrical supply

_store, as head of radio repairs.

In April, 1945, Senator Kenneth D. McKellar was invited to
sit in the meetings of the Cabinet of President Truman, though
not a. member. The reason given was that McKellar had be-

come president pro tempore of the Senate. There was re-‘

joicing among his supporters in Tennessee that the Senator’s
inﬂuence was greater now than ever before.

At the beginning of the new year, along with the news of
young men coming home from the war, the Daily He_rald
played up an alarming story on page one. It was a story
of what was called a great danger to the school children of
Columbia, caused by a New York Negro Congressman, Adam
Clayton Powell. Mr._ J. Rufus Baker, dairy farmer and
superintendent of schools of Maury County, gave warning

45

that the entire hot lunch program for the school children
of the county was about to collapse. This was because the
$65,000,000 appropriations bill was going to be defeated at
Vvashington, and its defeat would sweep away the $70,000 al-
lowance received yearly by Maury County from the federal
government for school lunches. ‘

The Daily Herald explained that the appropriation. bill
would have to be defeated in case of the acceptance of the
Negro Congressman’s amendment prohibiting any discrimina-
tion in distributing federal funds as between Negro and white
school children. Congressman Eugene Cox of Georgia was
quoted as saying the amendment if carried, “would unques-

Sfafe highway pafrolmen searching cifixens of Negro-populafed secﬁon of Columbia, 
Tenn., affer laﬁer had defended fheir homes and lives against invading gangs of armed f»
white civilians and police. ?

tionably mean that Southern States would not be entitled to
school lunch funds.”

Senators McKellar and Stewart and Congressman Priest
of Tennessee promised to ﬁght to the last ditch “for the school
children of Tennessee” against the amendment.

By strange coincidence, side by side with this story on the
ﬁrst page of the Daily Herald appeared another “Negro” story.
It was a report of a pu-blic rally the night before in which
Negro citizens had raised $4,000 to buy a piece of land as a
site for building a new public school for Negro children. By
concession to custom, no names were mentioned of the Negroes
who gave the money, but only the names of the two white
men who came to the rally to accept the Negroes’s gift to the
city——Mayor Eldridge Denham and School Superintendent
J. Rufus Baker. The general rule is that the names of Negroes
do not appear on the ﬁrst page or even in the main body of a
newspaper, except in connection with some heinous act or spec-
tacular crime. But if the Negroes who raised the fund to
present the land to the city had been ‘named, at the head of
the list would have stood: Julius Blair, Saul Blair, Charles
Blair, James Martin, James E. Morton, Finn Ray, Rev. Calvin
Lockridge, Rev. B. C. Frierson, Mead Johnson and Martin
Payne.

But within one week all of these names did appear on the
ﬁrst page of every newspaper of the United States—in connec-
tion with a falsely alleged plot to murder the white population
of Columbia.

This is the way it happened-

AN AMERICAN VETERAN COMES HOME .
TO A LYNCHING

James C. Stephenson, ]r., veteran of the U.S. Navy, 19
years old, came home from the war. He had served on board
the U.S.S. Prometheus and had been in action, and had spent
many months in New Caledonia, Okinawa, Hong Kong and
Pearl Harbor. He got off a Jim-Crow car in his home town on
January 28, and was met by his very proud and happy mother,
took him down to the Castner 8c Knott store on the public
square to get the family radio repaired, and they left the
machine with William Fleming, in charge of the radio repair
department. But radios are much in demand, and when Mrs.
Stephenson and her son returned to the store two weeks later
their radio had been sold to another customer, Fleming saying
that he thought it had been left unclaimed for more than 30
days. After some argument, and after Mrs. Stephenson’s white
employer had telephoned a protest to the store, the radio was
recovered, and Mrs. Gladys Stephenson and James went again
to get it on the now famous morning of Monday, February

25, 1946.
William Fleming put the radio on the counter and said

there was a bill for $13.50 due for repairs. But a cord was -

missing and the machine was not in working order. Mrs.
Stephenson paid the money, but -remarked with some im-
patience “Thirteen dollars, and the radio not playing! No one
is going to give away money like that. Now I’ll have to take it
somewhere else to have it ﬁxed.” *

Angry because a Negro spoke. to him in that way, Fleming
put the money into the cash register, came out from behind
the counter and sharply ordered Mrs. Stephenson to “Get out

48

 

of the store.” Jimmy Stephenson stepped between the white
clerk and his mother and steered her toward the door, walk-
ing behind her and ahead of the clerk, who followed them to
the door along with another white employee. 9

After Mrs. Stephenson had gotten out of the store, and as
Jimmy stepped out to the sidewalk, the white clerk, then in
the doorway, struck Jimmy in the back of the head with his
fist, while the other white man slipped out of the door ‘behind
Jimmy and slapped and kicked Mrs. Stephenson, knocking
her down.

James Stephenson turned, caught hold of Fleming, pulled
him out of the doorway and struck him a blow that knocked
him through the plate glass show window. In the Navy tradi-
tion, he followed Fleming through the broken glass to con-

tinue the ﬁght in the show window. Two other white men _

came to the aid of Fleming and for several minutes Jimmy
fought the three, out on the sidewalk. A white grocer came
out of another store with his apron on and shouted “Kill the

black -b . . . . . . . sl Kill every one of them!” More white men

 

came running, and “somebody started yelling ‘Let’s lynch
them!”’ (Nashville Tennessean, March 2, 1946.)

A white man in a hunting jacket struck Mrs. Stephenson
with his ﬁsts, picked her up, threw her on the sidewalk and
put his foot on her head. She got out from under, ran to the
drugstore and asked some white people there to call a police-
man to keep her son from being killed. Chief of Police J.
Walter Griﬂin and two patrolmen came, saw it was white
against Negro, and attacked the Negroes. One patrolman
raised his heavy nightstick to strike Jimmy Stephenson. Mrs.
Stephenson screamed “Don’t hit my boy!” and the policemen
turned and struck Mrs. Stephenson with the nightstick (Fed-
eral Grand Jury Report, p. 3). Mrs. Stephenson wasbadly
hurt. She and James were walked -to the city jail two blocks
away. The white clerk, slightly cut on the leg by the broken
glass of the window, was taken to the King’s Daughters hos-
pital. Other white men who had engaged in the ﬁght walked
with the policemen taking the Negroes to the jail.

James Stephenson and his mother were brought before a

49

 

9

police judge in the City Hall and put through a “Negro trial.’
A police officer asked James:
“Who is that gal with you?”
“That is my mother.”
The police judge asked:
“Were you ﬁghting?”
“Yes sir, I was fighting.”
“Guilty. Fifty dollars.”
Then to Mrs. Stephenson-
‘Are you guilty of fighting?”

holding radio over which a ﬁsf ﬁght led fo the affempfed lynching of Mrs. Sfephenson
and her son.

50

 

 

“Yes, sir.”

“Guilty. Fifty dollars.”

Police Chief Griffin called out to James Stephenson:

“Where’s that knife you’ve got, boy?”

“Ain’t got any."

“V/Vell, Fleming is cut up. Didn't you cut up Fleming?"

Jimmy replied: “If he got cut, it must have been the glass.”

Someone came in and told the police judge that men out
on the square were saying there was going to be a lynchin.g.
The judge called the sheriff and said “You’d better take these
people out of here, because we can't give them any protec-
tion.” The sheriff came and took them to the county jail, a
block away from the city jail.

Mrs. Stephenson and her son had been tried, convicted and
sentenced on a charge of breach of the peace.

But here C. Hayes Denton comes into the picture. After the
trial was over, the verdict pronounced and the prisoners
sentenced, the charge was changed. Denton turned over in his
head what James Step-henson said about Fleming being cut by
glass, got in touch with John Fleming, Sr., father of William
and F10, and produced a warrant sworn out by the father
charging James Stephenson and his mother with the felony of

“attempt to commit murder by use of a dangerous instrtmzent, '

to-wit, pieces of glass.”

Mr. Julius Blair telephoned to the county jail to say he

would send the money to pay the two $50 ﬁnes. Sheriff Under-
wood answered that it was no longer a matter of ﬁfty-dollar
ﬁnes but of $3,500 bail for each of them, that Magistrate C.
Hayes Denton had changed the charge and ﬁxed the bail, and
he would have to see Squire Denton.
1 \A7hile Mr. Blair was getting the title deeds for his property
ready to make bail, the sheriff phoned him at four o'clock
saying “You had better make bond and get them out of town
because they are going to be lynched. There is a mob milling
around.” He knew the jail could be broken into.

Julius Blair and his son Saul Blair got the papers ready
and came to Haynes Denton's office on the public square to

51

 

 

put up their barber shop and store on East 8th Street as se-
curity in $7,000 for the release of Mrs. Stephenson and James.

Hayes Denton looked surprised when they came in. He said
yes, the bail was $7,000 all together, but “it is liable to be
hitched up higher. The boy Fleming is all cut to pieces.”

Julius Blair said that since the bail was ﬁxed, he would
make the bond; he put the papers on the desk. Denton pro-
tested: 1 _

“I wouldn’t take them out if I was you, Julius. There is
liable to be trouble ifyou do.”, J

Mr. Blair replied “Why will there be trouble? This is just a
ﬁst ﬁght. I will take them out and I will take care of the
trouble.” .

Hayes Denton insisted: “Julius, I’m your friend. Don't take
them out. If you knew what I know, you wouldn’t do it.”

Mr. Blair said: “I’.1l take them out.” He knew what Hayes
Denton knew. . ‘

At the county jail, while they were taking the Stephensons
out at ﬁve o’clock, the sheriff said: “Get them out of town,
there’s a mob forming.”

' The two Blairs and James E. Morton, with the Stephensons
in the car, and an escort of two or three cars of friends, took
Mrs. Stephenson to her home where she insisted on going, and

’ put her to bed, badly shaken and bruised; then they took the

boy veteran down to Mink Slide where the Negro population
is more numerous and they could watch over him better.

 

 

VII

THE FAILURE OF LYNCHING NUMBER 204

By this time many people in Columbia, Culleoka, Glendale,
Bryant Station and Spring Hill knew that James Stephenson,
the Negro boy veteran, was to be lynched that night. Notall
knew that his mother was to be lynched with him.

At six o'clock the sheriff came down to Mink Slide in his
car, called Saul Blair out of the barber shop and asked “Is the
boy hid?" Mr. Blair said “Yes.” The sheriff turned to the men
who gathered about his car and said “I am you boys’ best
friend, and I want you to disperse and go home.” Someone
answered “The white men on the square are on the way down
here,” and the sheriff said “Well, I am going to the ‘square to
see them.” One man called out “Sheriff, you don't want us to
break up, and the white people up town coming down on us,
do you?” The Sheriff didn’t answer, but drove away.

. As the February day faded into darkness, a riﬂe shot rang
out from the white neighborhoodin East 9th Street.»There
were more shots and it became evident that some of the ﬁring
was being directed at the lights in the Negro business section.
Some of the young veterans went from house to house and
told everyone to put out their lights, and they and other men
set about getting what weapons they could ﬁnd. The Negroes
were extremely poorly armed. To the best of my information,
it appeared at the end of the ﬁght that they had about 14
shotguns, some of which were rickety, single-barrelled affairs,
two target riﬂes of the type used by small boys in the South.
.22 or .32 caliber, and about a half-bushel of pistols, some of
poor quality. Afterward a picture in a newspaper showed also
a broken and quite useless Japanese trophy tommie -gun which
couldpnot be ﬁred, found by the police and thrown into the
pile of shotguns to be photographed. About 125 or 150 young

53

 

 

 

veterans and others made the best of what weapons they could
ﬁnd and stationed themselves around the two-block business
area of East 8th street.

On the courthouse square the crowd, still numbering only
about 75, with riﬂes and shotguns in sight among them, were
discussing the coming lynching, their voices audible to the
Negro sentries in East 8th street. Someone came and told Rev.
Calvin Lockridge that a white man had gone into Porter 8c
Walker’s hardware store to buy a rope, saying “If we don’t
hang two Negroes tonight, I hope somebody will put this rope
around my neck.” The name of the white man who was said to
have bought the rope was . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..(7).* The store
manager says no rope was sold. The store was closed about 6
p.m., and later in the night a voice was heard above the
buzzing of the crowd, saying “W'ake up Mr. King; I know we
could get some rope from him!”

In front of the courthouse two white men were taking turns
at speaking, saying: “We’ll have to go down into Mink Slide
now and get those Negroes.” John Fleming, ]r., brother of
\Villiam and F10 Fleming, came to the square and, according
to the Nashville Tennessean (Feb. 26, 1946), made a speech
against the lynching, saying “Let well enough alone and don't
stir up any more trouble.” The other orators said “Those
Negroes picked up slivers of glass and used them for daggers to
stab Billy Fleming," and one of them shouted “Didn’t they
spill our blood? Let's go!”

Someone kept yelling “What are we waiting for?”

But there was no mystery as to‘ why the crowd was waiting,
except to a few who were drunk. An exaggerated report had
been circulated among them——and they believed it to be true-
that several hundred Negro war veterans were heavily armed
with Japanese and -German war-trophy guns and would meet

riﬂe—ﬁre with riﬂe-ﬁre. The number of armed white men on-

the square didn’t grow larger than 75 civilians, and these did
not move to go into Mink Slide, but leaned on shotguns and
rifles or sat on the steps of the courthouse, waiting.

‘ For explanation of the reason why this name is omitted, see footnote,
p. 24.

It was one of the strangest things ever seen—to some.

It was a deadlock.

The sheriff is quoted as saying afterward “The more I
thought it over, the more I became convinced that the crowd
of Negroes should be disbanded." (Washington Post, May 19,
1946-)

He tried, by telephoning to James E. Morton, the under-
taker, at 6.30 o'clock, to get Mr. Morton to persuade the Ne.
groes to deposit their guns where the police could come and
get them; but Mr. Morton and everyone else knew that a
change in the relationship of forces in favor of the armed
whites would result immediately in a lynching. It was not
done.

Two men in the crowd on the square tried to increase the
numbers of the mob by telling passers-by to go home and get
guns and come back. A young man, member of a family of
trade unionists, says that one of those who told him to “Go
home and get a gun and come back to the square” wore the
uniform of the State Highway Police. The crowd didn’t increase
and did not move toward the Negro section. Sheriff Under-
wood, sitting in his car on the square, shook his head and said
it was “a two-man lynching.”

Some of the white men with riﬂes, pistols and shotguns got
into automobiles and cruised around the outskirts of the
Negro section, shooting into it. A car carrying Negro men with
guns was stopped, the guns conﬁscated and the men jailed.
The whites were allowed to continue cruising, within sight
of the police and sheriff and newspaper photographers, ﬁring
at a distance at the Negro district.

There is no uncertainty about the fact that the police au-
thorities connived at the arming of the white men who as-
sembled with the openly expressed intention of lynching the

I Negroes. The law officers applied the policy that is practically

 

universal in lynchings—to disarm the Negroes and leave arms
in the hands of those who say they intend to lynch the Ne-
groes. Typical was a 4-column photograph on the ﬁrst page
of the Nashville Tennessean, of February 26, 1946, showing
uniformed state policemen, one_with a tommie gun, standing

55

 

 

 

in line with white civilians armed with riﬂes and shotguns. The
words attached to this photograph tell us that “state highway
patrolmen and armed civilians took their stands to await day-
light before moving into the Negro residential section to dis-
arm the residents and search for assailants,” etc., and that “A
former GI in the foreground carries a shotgun.” Nor is there
the slightest diﬂiculty in indentifying the armed civilians,
photographed with their weapons.

“None of ' the white oﬂicials, either state, county or local,
made a serious effort to disarm the white mob that threatened
the Negroes.” (Washington Post, May 19, 1946.)

Present on the square were four city policemen, the sheriff
with one or two deputies, and three state highway patrolmen
stationed at Columbia, Sergeant E. B. Noles, Sergeant Don
Kelley and Corporal Wm. Griﬂin.

A part of the mob, insufficiently armed, and seeing other
members of the mob armed and lined up with the police,
assumed they were to be supplied with riﬂes and ammunition
at the state armory. They formed a procession to march to
the armory. Two uniformed state highway policemen either
went with them to the armory or were among them‘ after they
reached the armory—which led to the report on the street that
two members of the State Highway Police led the mob to the
armory to get guns and ammunition. As the Nashville Ten-
nessean reported the incident: “Highway patrol sergeant E. B.
Knowles [correct spelling Noles], who is stationed at ‘Colum-
bia, related that he was forced to ‘out-reason’ a group of irate
citizens banded before the state armory with the obvious in-
tention of arming themselves with weapons and ammunition
stored there.” (If Negroes threatened with lynching had gone
to the armory “with the obvious intention of arming them-
selves with weapons and ammunition, stored there”,—they
would have been mowed down with‘ machine guns.) . . V _V

‘At 7 o'clock a squad of city policemen drove into the Negro
district and told the men standing in East 8th street that
“there would be no violence done to them by the white peo-
ple, that the white people were completely under control, and

56

 

ordered the'Negroes to disperse" (Federal Grand Jury Report,

*p» 6-)

Locking up his undertaking establishment at about 7 p.m.,
Mr. Morton walked up East 7th street, a block from the jail,
and saw a black Ford car draw up at the side entrance of the
jailhouse, where two men went in. A couple of minutes after-
ward, a state police car drove up to the same entrance. Then a
silent procession of some 30 or 40 men, marching two-by-two,
came up to the same side door of the jail. After a moment they
all turned and marched away in the same formation, two-by-
two, from the jail to the public square.

.Despite the tense situation, the two Blairs wanted to attend
a meeting long set for that night, of the committee for the

purchase of the land for the new Negro public school, Mr.

 

Julius Blair being temporary treasurer of the $4,000 fund. At
8 o'clock they arrived at the home of Miss Mattie Smith,
county superintendent of Negro schools, and waited for Mr.
A. J. Armstrong, Mr. Morton and others who were late.

But a few minutes after 8, Mr. Morton came in and said

“A mob is coming; I think you all ought to go home.”

The Blairs jumped into their car and drove back to East 8th
street, closed the store and barber shop and told the people
there to go home. Immediately, Saul Blair, commander of the
Negro post of the American Legion, with James T. Bellanfant,
veteran of World War II, got the boy, James Stephenson,
into the car and drove out a back street and to the main high-
way to Nashville, where they put the boy on a train for
Chicago. I _

At 8.30 a part of the mob, apologetically called by the fed—
eral grand jury “a group of 20 or 30 white persons, the major-
ity of them teen-age boys,” tried to storm the old red brick jail
under the false impression that the Negro veteran and his
mother were still there, and demanding that they be given up.
The sheriff opened the door of the jail, pointed a tommie gun
at the mobsters, told them the Negroes were not there, and
arrested two men “who~a‘ppeared to be the leaders of the
group.” (The two whom the. sheriff called leaders of a mob

attempting to break into a jail to murder prisoners were each
ﬁned $9.25.) 6

At 9 o’clock the chief of police and three of his city police-
men got into an ordinary car with no distinctive marking and
let it be known that they were going into the Negro business
section. The crowd on the square got the idea that the police
chief was going to get James Stephenson and his mother to
bring them up to the county jail, which is two blocks from the
square and in the white section. It looked like the old story.
They were highly elated. There was sporadicshooting going
on at the time.

A few minutes before the police started, another car, loaded
with armed civilians, made a dash into the Negro section,
shouting and ﬁring. They were met with shotgun ﬁre from the
Negroes, and turned away, shooting and yelling. “It was re-
ported that preceding the shooting of the four patrolmen, an
automobile filled with young white men had made a noisy
demonstration in the rioting area.” (Maury Democrat, Febru-
ary 27, 1946.)

Vvhen the four policemen turned their car down into the
Negro business section, their headlights were the only illumi-
nation. “The entire area was blacked out, in deep contrast to
the illumination of other sections of the city.” (Nashville
Tennessean, Feb. 26, 1946.) _“Inasmuch as all lights in the
sector were extinguished, the patrolmen couldnot be dis-
tinguished as oﬂicers in the darkness.” (Maury Democrat, edi-
torial, March 1, 1946.) ‘

The car loaded with policemen had gotten about 75 feet
into East 8th street when someone shouted in the dark “Here
they come!” and a shotgun rang out. \Vhether more than one
shot was ﬁred is doubtful. The car turned around and drove
back, each of the policemen bleeding from birdshot that struck
them in the face, shoulders and arms. As they drove through
the town to the King’s Daughters hospital for treatment, the
crowd saw that they had not brought James Stephenson back
with them. There was confusion and yelling in the crowd.
Speakers again argued “Come on down into Mink Slide and

get those Negroes,” but the mob, still no more than 7 5 in num-
ber, made no move to go.

After the unsuccessful dash of the police into Mink Slide,
no one would admit that its purpose, had been to bring James
Stephenson back to jail. “The sheriff said that the city police-

lmen started into the Mink Slide section merely to ﬁnd out if

there were any white people in the area, and to bring them
out. Underwood said that they had not meant to arrest any Ne-
groes.” (Nashville Banner, February 26, 1946.) Chief Griﬂin
gave a different reason for having gone: “We had heard about
shots being ﬁred down there, and decided to see what we
could ﬁnd out ‘about them.” (Nashville Tennessean, February
26, 1946.)

The lynching of James and Gladys Stephenson had failed.

Because it failed, the sheriﬂf and the mayor telephoned to
the governor at Nashville, asking that the armed forces of the
State be sent to Columbia. ‘

“LIKE GOING THROUGH A CAPTURED
TOWN” IN WAR

At 1:30 in the morning, the ﬁrst of 500 state guardsmen, in-
cluding a machine gun company from Nashville, began pour-
ing in from ﬁve neighboring towns with full military equip-
ment. \

In command was" a man of a famous name that you’ve run
across before in this pamphlet——]acob McGavock Dickinson.
This Dickinson, now a brigadier general of the State Guard,
is a son of the ﬁrst Jacob McGavock Dickinson, mentioned
earlier. «Col. Hinton Butler, acting adjutant general of the
State, came with the troops and announced that General
Dickinson was ﬁeld commander of the operation.

Joining to his state guardsmen some 75 state highway police
under Lynn Bomar, state director of public safety, Dickinson
passed by the cheering mob of about 7 5 armed white civilians
on the square. Without disturbing the mob assembled to per-
form a lynching, the general ordered his force, now nearly 600
strong, to close in on the Negro section of the city. A complete
military cordon was formed during the next hour, and Dickin-
son’s staff told the press “about 200 Negroes are surrounded.”
Word was passed around among the civilians on the square
that the troops and state highway police would attack the
Negroes at dawn and that the armed civilians would be
allowed to go in with the troops.

A telephone message from Roy H. Beeler, attorney general
of the State, gave warning of legal complications due to the
fact that the State Constitution says “the militia ‘shall not be

called into service except in case of rebellion or invasion and

 

then only whenthe general assembly shall declare by law that
the public safety requires it.’-' No action having been taken by

61

 

 

the general assembly, the militia was in service unlawfully;
and for this reason and because the militia consisted partly of
very young and untrained boys, a “ﬁring line” of about 75
state highway patrolmen armed with machine guns and riﬂes
was formed ahead of the state guardsmen to lead the attack,
and the guardsmen were warned not to ﬁre without orders.

For the rest of the night the troops and state police waited
in a line around the Negro community, while the armed
civilians waited behind them on the square.

Suddenly at 5 a.m. the surprise attack began.

The ﬁring line of the State Highway Police, commanded
directly by Lynn Bomar and under the direction of General
Dickinson, moved into the Negro district in advance of the
troops and with tommie guns blazing at everying ahead of
them. Buildings were riddled without any prior effort to ﬁnd
out who was inside. Steel helmets and goth Division patches on
the uniforms of some of the state guardsmen, plus the wholesale
riddling of all buildings in advance, made a perfect picture
of the ﬁrst making of war against American citizens on Ameri-
can soil after the close of World War II. As two newspaper
men, Tom Ketterson and Paul Page, described it in the
Columbia Daily Herald:

“To the war veterans, the scene was reminiscent of Ameri-
can troops going through a captured town in Europe.”

There was one difference: only the places owned by Negroes
were destroyed; every white shop was left untouched, and in
that respect it was more like a‘ Nazi storm-troop raid on a
Jewish quarter. The Nashville Banner said:

“As the highway patrolmen moved into the ‘Mink Slide’ or
‘Black Bottom’ section, this morning, they blasted a number
of business establishments with machine guns and carbines.
. . . Plate glass windows were shattered, doors were knocked
down and all the business places were virtually wrecked by

the highway patrolmen as they rounded up the large group of A

Negroes who had ﬁred on them at dawn.”

The Maury Democrat agreed the next day that the State
Police “blasted a number of buildings occupied by Negro
business establishments with machine guns and riﬂes.”

62

 

“In going through the Mink Slide, searching one and two
story brick buildings, patrolmen’s tommy-guns chattered oc-
casionally as they ﬁred through the glass windows.” (Tom
Ketterson; Columbia Daily Herald, February 26, 1946.)

Commissioner Bomar said “There are times when you have
to ﬁght ﬁre with ﬁre such as occurred early this morning."
(Nashville Banner, Feb. 26, 1946.)

“Armed with machine guns they (the State Police) searched
every Negro building in the two block area, ﬁring through
windows when Negroes refused to open barricaded doors.
Some Negroes returned the gunﬁre.

“Bomar described the raid as a success. He said some of the

men ﬁred into the windows of some of the buildings and that ‘

their fire was answered by ‘two or three’ shots from the Ne-
groes who had barricaded themselves behind closed doors.”
(United Press in Jackson, Miss., Daily News, February 26,
1946) ,

“The Mink Slide district showed many signs of violent
battle. Not a store in the two block area was intact.” (Nash-
ville Tennessean, Feb. 27, 1946.) It is a curious fact that every
piece of property pledged as bail for Mrs. Stephenson and her
son was carefully demolished. The objects of police vengeance
were particularly Morton’s undertaking establishment, Julius
Blair's store, and S01 Blair"s barber shop. The State Police, un-
der Bomar’s personal command and in his presence, wrecked
these places. They deliberately smashed buildings and furni-
ture, ﬁred at mirrors and glassware, ripped the linings out of
expensive coﬂins, poured embalming ﬂuid over plush linings
and leather and velvet chair covers, tore the green baize off
pool tables and broke up barber chairs. Juke boxesand cash
drawers were smashed and money and jewelry stolen at a time
when the only persons present were state policemen.

Before the State Police left Morton’s funeral parlor, one of
the most imposing of the coffins was hauled out and placed in
the middle» of the funeral chapel. Huge letters were inscribed
in white on its lid: “K.K.K.” This sign—-the American equiva-
lent of the swastika left in the ruins of the Jewish shop-s in
Germany during the rise of Hitler——was accepted as a signature
of Bomar’s state police and its pledge of future revenge for
the Negro community to see. All of which is important because
the pledge is now being carried out under cover of legal form
in a framed-up trial in court, and because a federal grand jury
directed by a federal judge who is a former member of the

Ku Klux Klan pretend not to know that this happened—al-'
though a large photograph of the coffin-lid and sign was

published in a hundred newspapers.*

"‘ The sign “K.K.K.” made and set up by the State Highway Police in
Morton’s undertaking parlor was ignored at ﬁrst ‘by all representatives
of the press except Harry Raymond of the Daily Worker, the New Yorlr

64

 

Communist paper, who called in a photographer to make a photo of it.

The connection of the State Police with the Klan-was exposed only by
the Daily Worker. The Washington Post on May 19, two. months and 19
days later, published the photo and told of the Klan connection, ‘saying:
“Thereu n the state patrol destroyed everything in Blair’s barber shop,
broke al the furnishings, riﬂed the cash register and cut up the pool
tables. Undertaker Morton's funeral home was wrecked and thevcaskets
ruined by throwing embalming ﬂuid over the silk linings, On one of the

coﬂins ‘K.K.K.”-‘ was -«printed -with~~white powder.”

 

. IX

MYSTERY OF THE STATE GUARD

The mob on the square had understood clearly that they
were to be a part of the ﬁring line in the surprise attack on the
 Negroes, which they had been correctly informed was set for
ifi dawn, and they waited from 2 o’clock until 5 a.m. for it. But a
strange thing happened, and some of the mob were not allowed
ii to go into the bloody action along with the State Police; out of
which a bitter quarrel arose. One of the men who was on the
square, named Marshall McKee, who claimed that he per-
sonally did go in with the ﬁring line, spread a story blaming
the State Guard for being late and failing to go into the ﬁght,
and, further, for interfering with what he considered the right
of the mob to go in. But the truth is:

When the ﬁrst shots of the State Police’s tommie guns rang "
out at 5 a.m.,’ the civilian mob let out a war whoop and
surged down South Main street, McKee running in the lead.
To their astonishment, at the corner of East 8th Street, they
were halted by a line of State Militia strung across the street
with ﬁxed bayonets. .

These troops were under command of Col. Victor H. Wil-
son, of Nashville. As McKee described it, “a little dried-up
 guy in an ofﬁcer’s uniform shouted ‘Halt!’ and stopped us. He
 had a big automatic pistol. I said ‘Who in.the G . . d . . hell
 are you talking to?’ and I had a gun just like he had, and he
 saw it. So he said ‘Well, will you please move back?’ And they
*1 I drove us back up South Main Street.” »

 Though McKee claimed he got through at some place and
  joined the State’ Police in the shooting up of the Negro section,
3  many of the mob failed to pass the militia. As the Nashville‘
l  Tennessean described it the next day: .-

I

\

“Emotional dynamite smoldered in the crowd. . . .
“Shotguns, riﬂes and small arms bristled among them. They

.  65

 

 

had been fed with rumors that there would be a showdown at
dawn following a night of sporadic ﬁring." The news writer
became sympathetic with the mob,’ writing with a technique
we see too often:

“Several of their relatives and friends had been wounded in l

the shootings. Nerves were at the snapping point. The men
were grim-lipped, and gripped their weapons tensely.

“Sudden gunﬁre and wild yells broke from the district
which had been entered by a brigade of state highway patrol-
men, bearing pistols and tommie guns.

“First the crowd hesitated, realizing that the police were in
there in strength. There was only a colonel and a small squad
of militiamen guarding the intersection.

"Then several hotheads in the crowd, obviously drinking,
shouted out ‘Let’s go and get ’em, what are we waiting for.
Didn’t they shoot us down last night?’

“The crowd blindly started to move forward.

“Then up stepped a little colonel ‘boys,’ he said, ‘take those
guns home. We’ll take care of any situation that needs them.’

“Again they hesitated. Again the fanatical would-be leaders
urged them on. ‘V/Ve haven’t got martial law yet. Let's go!’

“The crowd started again.

“And just as quickly the little colonel, weighing no more
than 140 or 150, singled out the leaders and practically read
them a ‘one-man riot act.’

“The shouters fell back. Gradually the armed weapon car-
riers, some so tense there were tears in" their eyes, broke up
and faded from the scene.”

At the end of the military raid, Attorney General Beeler ad-
vised that for legal reasons there should be no declaration of
martial law. He proposed that in all further actions against
the Negroes, such as searching homes for evidence, arresting
and otherwise preparing the criminal prosecutions which every-
one assumed would be made against the Negroes, the militia
should not act as militia, but should be transformed into
deputy sheriffs and act under form of local authority—the
State Police to do the same.

So, C. Hayes Denton was called in. From this moment on,

FOREWORD

While the nation resounds with news of lynchings — in
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana — and with promises
of state and federal officers to put an end to these crimes, 29
Negro men and one Negro woman of Columbia, Tennessee,
are prosecuted for preventing a lynching.

John McKivens and Robert Gentry have been condemned
to 21 years in prison solely because they are among those who,
with heroic courage, held back an armed gang trying to murder
a boy veteran and his mother. Twenty-three others were ac-
quitted, but some of these are to be tried again under other in-
dictments. Five more, -including the ‘boy veteran and his
mother, are still to be tried.

And all state and federal oﬂicials who have anything to do
with it—up to and including Tom C. Clark, Attorney General
of the United States, and J. Edgar Hoover, head of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation—are actively aiding in the frame—up.

The 19-year-old veteran, James Stephenson, and his mother,
Mrs. Gladys Stephenson, were to be hanged on the public
square.

The reason for the lynching was a ﬁst ﬁght of the Negro boy
with several white men, and his mother's effort to save her
son from injury. V

A mob of 50 to 75 white men armed with riﬂes, shotguns and
pistols assembled on the public square. Two members of the

'mob, within sight and hearing of the sheriff, the chief of city

police and several state policemen, made public speeches an-
nouncing the purpose of the armed men to lynch the boy vet-
eran and his mother. ’

The oﬂicers of the law of the city, county and state did
nothing to disarm the white gangsters, but mingled with them
on friendly terms, and there is some indication that they en-
couraged them to obtain further arms. Uniformed state high-
way policemen allowed themselves to be photographed stand-
ing in ready-to-ﬁre position shoulder to shoulder with mem-
bers of the white mob armed with riﬂes and shotguns, in a
single hostile line facing the Negro community.

the affairs of the City were effectively in the hands of men,
some of whom had stood under the tall cedar tree on the
Culleoka road on the night of December 15, 1933, ﬁring bul-
lets into the swinging body of the Negro boy, Cordie Cheek;
or the more important hands of the men higher up who pro-
tected the men under the tall cedar tree. C. Hayes Denton,
or he and Sheriff Underwood together, administerd the oath

‘ as deputy sheriffs to Gen. Dickinson and 59 members of the

State Guard, plus Lynn Bomar and 67 members of the State
Highway Police. That left 450 of the State Guard without a
commander, since a deputy sheriff cannot lawfully command
the State Guard, and the Nashville Banner announced:

“Gen. Dickinson has turned command of some 450 state
guardsmen over to Col. Victor Wilson while the general
is serving in the capacity of a deputy sheriff.”

But trouble was brewing for Wilson. The rage of the group
of armed civilians who had failed to get in for the “kill” in
the Negro section boiled. McKee, who had failed to get them
past Wilson on the morning of the attack on the Negroes,
is a member of a group that holds the controlling posts in the
T.V.A. at Columbia and is attached to the political machine
of C. Hayes Denton. Also a member of this group in the
T.V.A. is . . . . . . . . . . . . .. (8),”" who had played a part with
C. Hayes Denton and Bert Erwin in the lynching of Cordie
Cheek twelve and a half years ago, and who lives on a farm
near Denton’s place at Glendale. ‘ V _

A group of this kind enforces its own discipline in its com-
munity. In this case the group in which McKee is a member
controls the T.V.A. through H. R. Moseley, division superin-
tendent; V. S. Wildsmith, assistant superintendent; James N.
Tinker, plant supervisor; and various shift supervisors, and
even by means of strangling the local No. 912 of the Interna-

a movement that ﬁnally inc1uded—according to a suggestion
of the press—General Jacob McGavock Dickinson and the en-
tire ofﬁcer cadre of the Second Regiment of the State Guard
to remove Colonel Wilson from command. - It succeeded.
Colonel Wilson was transferred and then compelled. to re-
sign his commission in the State Guard. The resignation,
however. was kept secret. Three weeks after the event, the
Nashville Tennessean published an evasive story:

“Col. Hilton Butler, acting state adjutant general, disclosed
yesterday that he has accepted the resignation of Col. Victor
Wilson as a Colonel in the State Guard. v

“The resignation was submitted and acted on ‘several days

‘ ago’ and is reported to have been the outgrowth of certain

conditions that developed during the recent disorders in
Columbia. . . .”

The article adds that “Colonel Butler . . . declined to give
any reason for Wilson’s resignation. . . . First report to the
Nashville Tennessean said that all officers of the Second
Regiment had offered their resignations which were not ac-
cepted, pending an investigation.

“After the investigation the source of information, who re-
quested his name withheld, added, the officers agreed to stay
in the organization if Colonel Wilson was transferred and had

‘not learned yesterday that the colonel’s resignation had been

accepted.” (Nashville Tennessean, March 20, 1946.)

But that news came out only three weeks later. Now, on
the early morning an hour after the big shooting, Columbia
looked like a captured city; troops in full battle array of steel
helmets and ﬁeld equipment with fixed bayonets guarding
every street, and State Highway Police going from house to
house of the Negro sections, kicking in doors, stopping to
smash windows, occasionally spraying a house with tommie-
gun ﬁre, pulling every Negro out of every building, black-
jacking many, hitting John Blackwell over the head with a
riﬂe-butt at the Odd Fellows Hall, and leaving him lying
on his face in a pool of blood onthe sidewalk. Lynn Bomar
and his men had been in Morton’s Funeral Home, everything
of value smashed and the dresses kept for corpses thrown on

the ﬂoor and in the street and doused with embalming ﬂuid;
the sign of the “K.K.K.” was already set up there.

Lynn Bomar walked down from the "Funeral Home to the
corner of Woodward and East 8th Street and stood talking
with Gen. Dickinson. Tee Ellis, a civilian, lounged nearby
with a shotgun. It was about 6 or 6:30 A.M.

Saul Blair and james T. Bellanfant came driving by, on their
way home from Nashville where they had taken Jimmie
Stephenson during the‘night to put him aboard the train for

. Chicago. Bomar saw the car and called out:

“Well, there's Sol! Get out and get your hands up!”

Mr. Blair and Mr. Bellanfant got out of the car and held
their hands over their heads while Gen. Dickinson came up-.
The general, acting as a deputy sheriff, went through their
pockets, taking Mr. Blair’s .32 calibre Smith 8c Wesson re-
volver. State patrolmen took them to jail.

MEN FROM THE TALL CEDAR TREE

Long processions of Negroes with their hands held high
were passing through East 8th Street and up Woodward
Avenue to the jail, while the state policemen held tommie guns
on them and kept up a constant stream of threats and sharp
orders. _

At noon the governor arrived, and, what is more important,
the governor's executive secretary, Bayard Tarpley, arrived
and set up a new policy: All talk about any attempt having
been made to lynch any Negroes must be stopped; there wasn’t
any attempt at lynching, he said—what had happened was an
armed uprising of Negroes, attempting to murder the white
population of Columbia, which had barely been stopped in
time. Tarpley solemnly informed everyone that Negroes were
known to be buying weapons “all over the state.”

Within two hours the Daily Herald went to press with an
editorial saying:

“The Negro’ has not a chance of gaining supremacy over

. a sovereign people, and the sooner the better element of

the Negro race realize this the better off the race will be.”
(Columbia Daily Herald, February 26, 1946.)

The frame-up was under way. The Nashville Banner an-
nounced that “weapons, captured from the rioting Negroes”
included “automatic riﬂes and one machine gun,” and, to
substantiate the charge, printed a photograph of 14 rickety
shotguns, two small target riﬂes and a bread knife as “a part”
of the armament of the “Negro riot.” But bread knives were
not sufficient. The weapons that had been taken from the
homes of white people were added to the meagre few that had
come from the homes of Negroes, and photographs of the
whole pile were published as “a part of the 400 riﬂes and shot-

71

 

A . ‘  :4::;:::*""*“  .~n.~=::-:.::“:t.. .,

 

guns and 150 pistols seized from the Negroes.” (Nashville
Banner, February 27, 1946.) The United Press had it: “some
400 pistols, riﬂes, shotguns and machine guns . . . conﬁscated
from Negroes.” (Knoxville Journal, February 28, 1946.)

What amounted to a vigilante board, with no legal authority
whatever, was set up, composed of Lynn Bomar, Paul F.
Bumpus, District Attorney General, Sheriff Underwood and
Jacob MoGavock Dickinson, later replaced by C. Hayes Den-
ton, took over direction of the raids and arrests and packing
of the jail with Negroes, preparatory to a general wholesale
prosecution. When I drove into Columbia the next after-
noon the Daily Herald carried in big type the news that 67
highway patrol officers and 59 state guardsmen were “depu-
tized by Squire C. Hayes Denton” to search all homes for
weapons. The Herald said “fear-crazed Negroes who had be-
lieved that lynching parties were out to get them were calmed
after a night of rioting and bloodshed in which seven per-
sons were wounded.”

Down the streets came an almost normal ﬂow of traﬂic,
sifting through military lines at every corner. Every Negro
man was made to lift his hands high over his head while he
was searched at the point of a bayonet; all white pedestrians
were politely waved to pass without inspection; white drivers
of automobiles were asked whether they had any weapons
in their cars and then allowed to pass. .

But there were no “fear-crazed Negroes.” Every Negro
looked every white man in the eye straight and steady, with-
out blinking.

The jail was ﬁlled to suffocation with Negroes.

“Magistrate Denton issued warrants wholesale without re-
quiring proof of probable cause.” (Washington Post, May 19.)

Arrests were made, not on a basis of speciﬁc charges but on
the basis of their leading position in the Negro community.

“Among the approximate 70 Negroes arrested and jailed
in connection with the riot were Sol Blair and James Morton,
both of whom have been regarded as leaders of their race
for some time.” (Maury Democrat, February 27, 1946.)

None of the white men whom the sheriff and state and city

72

 

 

 

police had seen and whom newspaper men had photographed
in the act of attempting to shoot Negroes were arrested, and
for many days it did not even occur to the white authorities
that there was any reason to arest any white man. The two
white men whom the sheriff called leaders of the gang that
tried to storm the jail to lynch the Stephensons, had paid their
ﬁnes of $9.25 each and were walking the streets free.

That the law oﬂicers regarded themselves as natural allies
of the gang that attempted the lynching was revealed by the
contrast of handling Negroes and whites:

Sfafe guardsmen and members of armed whife mob rounding up Negro cifizens for
failing on fhe morning affer ‘the invasion and wrecking of the Negro secfion of Columbia, 7
Tenn. Noﬁce young boy and girl on exrreme Ieff wifh arms upraised.  .

73  3

 

 

“Morton was charged with assault with intent to commit
murder. . . .' Blair was charged with attempt to commit
murder as were most of the other Negroes arrested.

“The two white men, who Sheriﬂf Underwood said were
attempting to stage a ‘two—man lynching’ were arrested
during the night on charges of disorderly conduct. The
sheriff said the two were Joe Williams and Roy Scribner,
whom he described as ‘characters about town.’ ”

—-(Nashville Banner, February 26, 1946.)

 

The Maury Democrat the next day used almost the same ‘

words, closing with:

“Joe Williams and Roy Scribner, white men, were ar-
rested . . . on charges of disorderly conduct by Sheriff Un-
derwood who stated that they were attempting a ‘two-man
lynching’ and otherwise stirring up disorder.”

C. Hayes Denton ﬁxed bail for the 70 Negroes then held
in jail at $5,000 each—a total of $350,000.

Attorneys for the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People came to put up bond for them. Most
of the known prisoners were shifted from jail to jail, between
Columbia and Nashville, to evade release on bail. Finally
the lawyers got a promise from the Denton-Bumpus gang
that some of the leading Negroes would be released “on bond
to be supplied by Julius Blair.”

But as soon as the lawyers were out of town, Julius Blair
was also thrown in jail. Lynn Bomar went down to East
8th Street, intercepted Mr. Blair in his car and demanded:

“What the h. . . . were you doing with those G. . . . d. . . .
white lawyers?”

Two patrolmen with Bomar ordered Mr. Blair: “Pull up
to the curb and lock your car. You have been seen around
in town with those two white lawyers, and you know that’s
not the way we do things here.”

The Daily Herald said:

“Among the latest to be taken into custody by the "State
Highway Patrol are Julius Blair, father of S01 Blair, whom
some identify as a leader of the Negro disturbance, Charlie
Blair, brother of S01, and Meade Johnson, a widely-known
Negro. . . .

74

 

 

 

“The two Blairs and Johnson were arrested by a patrol
composed of Sgt. E. B. Noles, Sgt. Don Kelley and Cpl.
Bill Griffin." (February 28, 1946.)

The kangaroo committee in charge of Columbia’s affairs
took over the telephone exchange, tapped all telephone lines
of Negroes and gave the names of persons calling and the
content of conversations to the newspapers. The Negro-bait-
ing Nashville Bcmner said the people who telephoned to Ne-
groes in Columbia were “Charles Stuart of Columbus, Ga.;
Joe Booker of Chicago; a man who identiﬁed himself as With-
erspoon of Nashville; besides other calls from Detroit and
numerous calls from local Negroes.” (February 26, 1946.)

By coincidence a new county grand jury was scheduled to be
formed on the very morning—February 2 5—when the ﬁst fight
of Jimmy Stephenson and the white men occurred on the
square just outside of the courthouse. So it happened that the
sound of the breaking glass and shouts of “Let’s lynch them!”
were audible in the courtroom just a few feet away, when the
members of the jury panel assembled in- the Circuit Court
under Judge Joe Ingram on that Monday morning at 10
d’clock, to form the new county grand jury. “

The panel for the selection of this county grand jury was
composed solely of white men. For half a century no Negro
has been permitted to sit on a jury, grand or petty. This is one
of the fruits and one of the purposes of the 203 lynchings
in Tennessee in the past 75 years.

All indictments returned were against Negroes at that stage.

Only when the unexpected uproar of protest throughout the
country compelled Tom Clark to authorize a federal govern-
ment investigation, did it occur to the local authorities that it
looked bad to indict none but the intended victims of a lynch-
mg.

Then the two white men, Roy Scribner and Joe Williams,
who had once been ﬁned $9.25 for alleged leading of a lynch
mob, were re-arrested, charged with attempt to commit a felony
and released on $5,000 bond by C. Hayes Denton. Four white
men in all were said to be indicted, but two of these were not
arrested.

"QUESTIONING” PRISO‘NERS’——\X/ITH
TOMMIE GUNS

A constant stream of arrested Negroes passed in and out of -

the dining room of the sheriff's apartment in the county jail
for questioning.

In the prison, crowded to suffocation, about a hundred men
awaited turns to be examined. John Blackwell was brought in,
unconscious, his scalp and forehead open with a wound from
a riﬂe-butt. When the shooting began he had run for shelter
in the Masonic Temple. State police had dragged him down
the stairs, struck him over the head with a gun (see Federal
Grand jury Report, pp. 8-9) and left him face down on the
street in a pool of blood. Later they brought him to the jail,
booked him for assault with intent to commit murder, and
deposited him on the jail ﬂoor for a day and a half to regain

_consciousness for questioning. The Negro American Legion

commander, Sol Blair, himself a prisoner, got the sheriff’s per-
mission to enter the cell and wash Mr. Blackwell’s wound, and
ﬁnally to get a doctor. Blackwell “could not" be put in the
hospital in Columbia, because it does not receive Negro bed
patients. After a day and a half, as he was still unconscious,
he was taken to the Negro ward in the Nashville city hospital.

Questioning of prisoners proceeded.’ Paul F. Bumpus, Dis-
trict Attorney General, telephoned to Rev. Calvin Lockridge
to come to his office. There Bumpus said: “We’ve got nothing
against you. We want you to help us. You tell us who the
ring leaders are, and we will not prosecute you.”

Rev. Lockridge replied: “I don’t know.”

Bumpus ‘said “Get to hell out of here,” and he had Mr.
Lockridge indicted for assault with intent to commit murder,
first degree, and -carrying weapons with intent to "be armed,

The Negroes of Columbia, with splendid courage, prevented
the lynching of James Stephenson and his mother.

The state police and militia took a bloody revenge upon the
Negroes. By order of the governor and under direct command

of a brigadier general of the State Guard, 500 men, using

machine guns and riﬂes, attacked the Negro section, shooting
into and wrecking the buildings, wounding many with gunﬁre,
blackjacks and blows over the head with riﬂebutts.

Illegal arrests were made. Prisoners who refused to make

V false statements were shot to_ death by the state police in the

sheriff’s office at the end of a long questioning in which their
answers were unsatisfactory to the police and sheriff.

A county grand jury, illegally formed by systematic exclusion.

of Negroes from the panel, served in effect as an off-shoot of
the mob that had failed to accomplish the hanging on the
square. The mother and son who were to be lynched by the
mob were indicted by the county grand jury. Together with
them were indicted virtually the entire leadership of the Ne-
gro people of Columbia.

The 30 Negroes are indicted for the following facts:

About eight hours after the cry had been raised on the public
square “Let’s lynch them!” and four hours after a police judge
had ordered the mother and son removed to the county jail
on the ground that there was likely to be a lynching; two hours
after a county magistrate who had previously participated in
a lynching told the leading Negro citizens that a mob was
forming to lynch the young veteran and his mother; and after
the sheriff had twice advised them to get the mother and son
out of town because the mob was coming to get and hang them;
and while shots from riﬂes and shotguns were being ﬁred into
the Negro community~—

Then some young veterans of World War II and an older
veteran of World War I, commander of the American Le-
gion Negro post, together with a Baptist minister and some
others, got the Negro boy veteran out of Columbia and onto
a train for Chicago, while they stood guard or advised others
to stand guard with shotguns, target riﬂes and pistols in front
of Negro homes and shops. Many of the Negroes are charged

put in jail and his bond ﬁxed at $5,000 by Squire C. Hayes
Denton.

VVilliam Gordon, a farm worker awaiting his turn for ques-
tioning, became morose and indicated to friends that he ex-
pected rough treatment. When he, together with James john-
son and Napoleon Stewart, was called to go to the sheriff’s
dining room in the jailhouse, Gordon handed his billfold
and other personal belongings to friends, saying, according to
newspaper reports, “Somebody’s going down when I get out
there; I might get killed or hung.” The police and press
have strained to interpret this remark as indicating the three
empty-handed Negro prisoners intended to attack a roomful
of heavily-armed police and deputy sheriffs. Newspapers per-
sist in saying the three intended a “jail break,” the falsity of
which is apparent. In the ﬁrst place, the sheriff had promised
the three to release them as quickly as their bonds, in small,
“nominal” sums, could be made out. In the second place,
anyone who is going to make a run for freedom wants to keep
his billfold, money and personal belongings in his pocket.

The sweating of the three young Negro men, Gordon, John-
son and Stewart began. According to the sheriff, the witnesses
did not give satisfactory answers, though Johnson “gave us
quite a lot of information, so I said to him ‘Digger, I won’t lock

you up. You go into my office until we make your bond.’ ” But i

the sheriff said Gordon “wouldn’t tell much.” (Washington
Post, May 19, 1946.) The questioning ended, the three men
were escorted by two deputies from the sheriff’s dining room
to the sheriff's oflice and seated on chairs, behind which was a
stack of miscellaneous shotguns and riﬂes, conﬁscated in raids.
None of the guns were loaded. The two deputy sheriffs,
Pennington and Darnell, armed with revolvers, stayed in the
room to guard the prisoners. In the room also was a photog-
rapher of the Nashville Banner.

A few minutes after the three Negro prisoners were seated,
ﬁve state policemen entered the sheriff’s office and emptied
their tommie~guns into two of them. Johnson, riddled as he
sat in the chair, fell over onto the floor in a dying condition.
Gordon tried to rise from his chair but fell on hands and

78

 

 

knees, while the two state policemen continued to ﬁre into him.
He managed to crawl under the bed, and the policemen ﬁred
down through the bed into him. The third man, Napoleon
Stewart, sprawled on the floor, as though dead. When the
t policemen saw that he was not shot, they beat him with pistols,
‘ kicked him in the mouth and eyes, but did not shoot him
again. Flo Fleming came in and beat him with a pistol.

Gordon and, Johnson, dripping blood from many bullet-
holes, were taken first to the King’s Daughters hospital. There
they were found to be in a dying condition, given blood plas-
ma, but not put to bed because, as one newspaper’“‘ explained,
it is “a white hospital.” The dying men were taken out, put
into an ambulance or some other car and given an hour-and-a-
half ride on the road toward Nashville; they died on the way.

After Gordon and Johnson were killed, some of the Negro
prisoners saw the coroner come into the jail and to the sherilf’s
oﬂice. The coroner is still Bert Erwin. He came to the jail
several times.‘ But there was no coroner’s inquest and no
coroner’s verdict. Harry Raymond, writer for the Daily Work-
er, asked District Attorney General Paul F. Bumpus why it was
that, when two men met violent deaths—and these were the only
two violent deaths in the whole major affair—there was no
coroner’s inquest. Bumpus replied: “An inquest is held here
only when the cause of death is unknown. Here the cause of
death was known.” -

Known to whom? To the ‘ﬁve who did the killing and to the
two deputy sheriffs, the newspaper phqtographer and to the
one Negro survivor. , _

Raymond asked what was the oﬂicially accepted cause of
the deaths. Bumpus replied: “They were shot while attempt-
ing to kill officers of the law in the Maury County jail.”

As to the Negro survivor, he had been promised, just before
the shooting of his fellow-prisoners, that he “would be per-
mitted to make bond” in a “nominal” sum“. But as soon as
he became a witness to the killing of his two companions, he
was indicted for “assault with intent to commit murder.”

Bumpus did not tell Raymond the truth. In Tennessee:
“It is the duty of a coroner to hold inquests over the dead
bodies of,/those who may reasonably be supposed to have come
to their death by violence or through some cause which in-
volv.es a violation of law. The object of a coroner’s inquest is to

* Washington Post, May 19, 1946.‘
** Federal Grand Jury Report, p. 10.

80

 

 

ascertain the cause of death, and to obtain and secure evidence
in case of death by violence or other undue means. The -inquiry
is not limited to the cause of death and the nature of the
violence causing it, but extends to other circumstances
attending the acts and tending to characterize them.” (13
C. J. 1245; and see Galloway v. Shelby County, Tenn., 7 Lea.
121.) No inquest can be held “until an affidavit, in writing,
is made and signed by two or more reliable persons, averring
. . . that there is good reason to believe that such person came
to his death by unlawful violence. . . .” (Sec. 118. 76, Code of
Tennessee; 1895, ch 31, sec. 1.)—-but the absence of such alli-
davits is one of those things that the gang sees to.

The story told by the policemen who did the shooting is one
that any normal boy scout would reject with contempt. It
is that Gordon and Johnson, while seated in the sheriff's office
within three paces of two armed deputies, reached back,
seized two riﬂes, loaded them and began ﬁring at the deputy
sheriffs, and that then the ﬁve state policemen rushed into the
sheriff’s oﬂice and shot them.

To accept the story we would have to believe (1) that, after
having been searched twice for ammunition, the two Negro
prisoners had riﬂe cartridges in their pockets when brought in
from the jail; (2) that the riﬂe cartridges were of the style
and calibre to ﬁt the riﬂes in the sheriff's office; (3) that in the
presence of the two armed deputies who were there to guard
them, they had time to select riﬂes to ﬁt the cartridges they had
in their pockets, open the chambers, load and aim—and (4)
that white policemen tell the truth when they kill Negroes.

The Federal Grand jury was called to take up the Columbia
case. Its ﬁrst session was to be on Monday, April 8.

The police and Bumpus were uneasy over what James T.
Bellanfant, the Negro veteran who had helped Sol Blair get
James Stephenson out of Columbia ahead of the mob, would
testify to if called before the Federal Grand Jury.

On the day that the federal jury convened—Monday, April
8——four white men armed with shotguns and pistols laid in wait
for Bellanfant on the Mooresville pike two miles south of
Columbia. Bellanfant, as driver of the school bus for the

81

l
l

 

 

Culleoka Negro school, customarily had to pass this point
at 10 o'clock eachschool-day morning, returning with the
empty bus. But Bellanfant was not driving this time; a
substitute driver, Leroy Moore, was working in his place. The
four armed white men stopped the bus, stuck a gun into
Moore’s face and asked, “Are you Popeye?”——a nickname for
Bellanfant. Moore proved by his driver’s license that he was

_not Bellanfant, and after some argument, was allowed to go

on his way. He went immediately to the school superintendent,
J. Rufus Baker, told him of the hold-up and refused to drive
the bus any more. Baker gave the news to the press.

The importance of the news was that it showed the armed
gang of civilians was still operating in Maury County six
weeks after the attempted lynching, and was trying to lay hands
on a witness about to appear before the Federal Grand Jury.

The police immediately picked up Moore for “questioning.”
Three policemen took charge——not to get the bus driver’s story,
but to break it down. The three assigned to handle Moore
were state highway police Sergeant E. B. Noles, city patrolman
Emmett Fox and R. Kirk Webb of the state ﬁre marshal’s
oﬂice, temporarily working with the State Police by order of’
Gov. Jim McCord.

As the Federal Grand Jury was already in session, and would
logically have to inquire immediately into an armed attempt
to tamper with a witness before it, Moore’s story would have to
be broken down speedily and with a certain care. The judge,
formerly a member of the Ku Klux Klan, allowed the police
to have Moore first. It seems to have been one of the most
remarkable cases of a Federal Grand Jury delaying its hearing
of a witness in order to permit him to be taken over and “soft-
ened up” by those against whom he would testify. The police
were allowed to have Moore first.

To get the proper effect on Moore, the police picked up
Bellanfant and brought him into the room where Noles, Fox
and Webb were trying to get Moore to retract his story before
going to the Federal Grand Jury. In sight and sound of Moore,
the police went at Bellanfant in the old style of dealing with a
Negro who testiﬁes against white mobs.

82

 

 

 

Not Moore, but Bellanfant, in the presence of Moore, was
beaten and manhandled.

After much sweating and seeing Bellanfant physically as-
saulted by the police, Moore said, “It didn't happen; I was
lying; yes, sir, I-was put up to it by ‘Popeye.’ " On the night
of ‘April 10, Moore signed a “confession” withdrawing his
statement that four armed white men held up the Negro school
bus and were looking for Bellanfant; and declaring that Bellan-
fant had put him up to saying it.

So the Federal Grand Jury didn't have to inquire into the
fact that armed civilian bands were still operating in Maury
County. It could concentrate on helping Bumpus, Denton and
Bomar to frame up the Negroes.

Go back a moment to February 27, two days after the at-
tempted lynching. Jesse G. Owen, a white crane operator
in T.V.A. fertilizer plant at Columbia had a conversation
with Marshall McKee, who told Owen that he had been with
the mob on the square on the night of the 25th and had gone
into the attack on the Negro section the next morning at dawn
with the State Police. Mr. Owen was an active member of the
International Union of Operating Engineers, A. F. of L.
McKee, long a non-union man, had recently been brought into
the union by Owen. Owen, who was trying to line up the
union to take a stand in defense of the Negroes, immediately
transmitted the information that he had obtained from Mc-
Kee to the National'Association for the Advancement of Col-
ored People, which is in charge of the legal ﬁght for the 30
arrested Columbia Negroes. In its attempt to compel the De-
partment of Justice to act against the lynchers, the N.A.A.C.P.
gave this information to that Department, which passed it on
to the Federal Bureau of Information. On May 31, two F.B.l.
men came to the home of Mr. Owen to ask whether he con-
firmed the information he had given the N.A.A.C.P. He did
so. But experience shows that all information given to the
F.B.I. is known within a few hours to the Hayes Denton gang.

On Monday June 3, when Owen came to work on the 4 P.M.

shift, the shift supervisor summoned him to the oﬂice of this
T.V.A. government plant where he found assembled the fol-
lowing persons: James N. Tinker, plant supervisor; V. S.
Wildsmith,: assistant superintendent; V. .S.._-Stevens, shift fore-
man, Inman Young, job steward, and another man, probably a
personnel zdirector. ~. - . .

In the presenceof the others, Tinker told -Owen that some
men had made up their minds to do violence to him. Tinker
pretended that he was merely conveying the information from

-others, whom he knew but refused to name. He said they “are

pressing us for. time and we have got until two o'clock to-
morrow afternoon to let them. know something.”
Owen, if he quit his job by 2 o'clock the‘ next day and left

the community immediately, would be given a favorable dis- -
I charge; otherwise violence would be used againstihim. Tinker

said: “In fact they have already been to us and told us they are
ready for violence.”

Owen _refused to be terrorized, but later in the night, when
he saw indications that he ._was about to be attacked, he sud-
denly slipped out of the plant and away.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored

People took Owen to Washington and tried to get Attorney .

General Tom Clark to take action. Clark’s assistants, in his
presence, waved the matter aside as. “hearsay.” Tom Clark is
among those who are bending every effort to cover up the
lynching ring in Tennessee.

,The armed civilian gangs continue to operate. In Chat-
tanooga, a. professional court stenographer employed by the
defense -attorneys was stoppedon the street by a gangster who
had laid in wait for him. The gangster said “I’ve seen you in
Columbia. You'd better get out of this. I’m tipping you off
for your own protection. As for Weaver and Looby [attor-

neys for the defendant Negroes], they will be found at- the A

bottom of Duck River.” The stenographer quit.

‘TOM CLARl<[S ALL-WHITE FEDERAl. GRAND
IURY

Bumpus and C. Hayes Denton need not have been uneasy
about the Federal Grand Jury. It had been selected in a man-
ner described to me by the clerk of the Federal District Court,
Mr. L. B. Ormes, as a system of selection of “outstanding
citizens.” He and the jury commissioners each made a list
of men personally known to them whom they considered “out-
standing.” Then each of these “outstanding” citizens of the
district is invited by letter to make a list of further “outstand-
ing” citizens. Of course there are no Negro “outstanding"
citizens. Mr. Ormes asked me plaintively, “You wouldn't
have us select grand jurors according to race, would you?"
Nor is there likely to be on such a jury panel a single human
being who has the desire or the guts to oppose the foulest
lynching gang that ever ruled and ruined a beautiful land.

The system is similar to that by which an exclusive rich
man's club is formed. The lists of privately selected friends
of the friends of the ruling clique, put together, become the
federal jury panel. The names are placed in a box and,
subject to a certain distribution among counties, an innocent
child draws out the 23 who become the U.S. grand jury.

Tom Clark saw to it that the supervision of this grand jury
was in the hands of Judge Elmer D. Davies, formerly of the
Ku Klux Klan, and that the evidence of violations of the con-
stitutional rights of Negroes was put before the grand jury
by Horace Frierson, the federal attorney of the district, who
had already announced that his friends, Bumpus, C. Hayes
Denton and Bomar, had not violated any constitutional rights.
It happened that Frierson’s statement was rolling off the press
of the Daily Herald on the afternoon of February 28, at the

85

\

 

very moment the two Negro prisoners were being shot to
death in the sheriFE’s office; and the next edition of the Daily
Herald carried news that Frierson would be in charge of the
federal inquiry into violations of constitutional rights, if any.

Tom Clark’s all-white Federal Grand Jury found no reason
even to mention that the Negroes were denied their constitu-
tional rights in their indictment by a county grand jury il-
legally formed by systematic exclusion of Negroes.

Tom Clark’s all-white Federal Grand Jury found that there
had not been any attempt at lynching, and that even “the
rumor of a possible lynching” was “baseless.” (Federal Gmnd
Jury Report, p. 5.)

Its report implies, rather, that the aggressors in the whole
affair were the Negroes who smuggled the 19-year-old boy
away from the mob and then stood guard over their homes.

The report says that the State Police violated no constitu-
tional rights by shooting Negro prisoners in their custody.

It said the beating of the frail, 124-pound mother of the
Negro veteran with a nightstick by three policemen “was
neither brutal nor wanton, but was reasonably necessitated in
the course of overcoming resistance to the arrest.” (I bid, p. 3.)

It rejected all evidence that the white mob was armed at an F

early stage, prior to the arming of the Negroes, on the ground
that one Negro witness was unable to give an exact description
of the guns ‘he saw from across the square. But it gave
no description of the guns it alleges were seized by the two
Negro prisoners before they were killed in the sheriﬂf’s oﬂice
—it does not even say what calibre they were, nor whether,
as the police said, they were unloaded, nor what kindof cart-
ridges were alleged to have been put into them by the Negroes
nor whether such guns were produced in evidence—all of
which would be vitally necesary to any honest report on the
deaths causedby the police.

One of the snidest pieces of lying I have ever seen is the
effort of the Federal Grand Jury to make you believe that
when the two Negroes, dying of bullet wounds, were refused
admission to a white hospital and hauled 43 miles to another,

86

 

 

and died on the road, it was done for the sake of the Negroes’
health “on advice of attending physicians.” (I bid., p. 10.)

Tom Clark’s grand jury pretended that it was unimportant F

to discover the identity of the two of the three orators on the
square who called for the murder of the Negro boy and his
mother, nor even to conﬁrm or deny the widely known and
published fact that such speeches were made. ’
Tom C1ark’s grand jury pretended that with the power
of the U. ‘S. Government behind it, it was unable to discover
the identity of the well—known Columbia and Culleoka white
men who carried arms in the white mob and whose photo-
graphs, excellent likenesses, were published in 200 newspapers.
As it said in the case of one white offender, that “the identity
. . . remains unascertained,” (Ibid., p. 3) so it might have said
of all white offenders. For, in the course of a two—months’
examination of hundreds of witnesses and with reports of
interviews with 390 more by the F.B.I., it did not discover
the name of one white civilian who was on the streets of Colum-
bia during the two days of mob violence, except the principal,

F William Fleming, whose identity had to be mentioned in order

to accuse the Negroes.

When a charge, made by a Negro against a white man, is
denied by the white man, the all-white Federal Grand Jury
found that “the responsibility for the aggression . . . is not
determinable in view of the direct conﬂict of testimony. . . 

‘(Ibid., p. 3.) This is a form of the code of slavery, that the

word of a Negro cannot be accepted against the word of a
white man. -
The federal judge who once admitted he had been a mem-
ber of the Ku Klux Klan (N. Y. Times, July 19, 1939) guided
the Federal Grand Jury to ignore the fact that the State Police,

"after machine-gunning and wrecking the Negro community,

signed off with the initials  although photographs of
the big sign the police made and left in the ruins, bearing this
emblem, were printed in hundreds of newspapers and maga-
zines. He merely attacked the Daily Worker which revealed
the fact.

Instead of explaining or answering or admitting such facts,

87

 

 

with assault with intent to commit murder on the ground that
some of them returnedthe ﬁre of white gangsters, and, most
particularly, that one or more shotguns were ﬁred upon an
automobile in which four policemen entered a darkened street
of the Negro business section a few minutes after a carload
of white civilians had tried to enter and had been repelled by
the Negroes with shotgun ﬁre.

Mr. Julius Blair, -father of the American Legion post com-
mander, Mr. Morton, the undertaker, the Rev. Calvin Lock-
ridge, the Baptist minister, are indicted for assault with intent
to commit murder on the ground that they refused to advise
the Negroes to lay down their arms before the armed mob.

These alone are the so-called “crimes” for which 29 splendid
men and one ﬁne woman of Columbia are being prosecuted,
and for which, if convicted, they will spend many years in
prison—2o or 40 years in most cases, and for the older ones
the rest of their lives.

Thispamphlet is written to convince you, the people, white
and Negro, that it is your duty to defend the Negroes of
Columbia—to make it a point of honor -of our country that not
one of them goes to p-rison. Further than that, we ask you to

' help to see that the gangsters guilty of the attempted lynching

and the frame up, and of t-he murder of Negro prisoners, are
prosecuted under criminal law and given the full penalty of
that law which, in the case of murder, is the death penalty.

This is a ﬁght to wipe out the system of lynching.

On the demand of men and women in and out of Tennessee.
U. S. Attorney General Tom C. Clark promised a federal in-
vestigation into the vio-lations of federal constitutional rights
of the Negroes at Columbia. But what Mr. Clark gave was a
sham investigation, shielding the lynch-gang and aiding the
frame-up of the Negroes. .

The ﬁrst and most urgent of the issues of violation of consti-
tutional rights for the Federal grand jury to investigate arose
from the fact that the County grand jury that returned the
false indictment against the Negroes was illegally formed by
systematic exclusion of Negroes. ,

But the Federal grand jury to which Torn Clark entrusted

7

 

 

     

the faithless and un-American judge led the grand jury" to ex-
press, in effect, regret that the First Amendment of -the United
States Constitution did not permit them to indict and imprison
those Americans who expose and denounce the attempted
lynching and the violations of the constitutional rights of
Negroes. Davies, the ‘former Klansman, goes further in this
than anyone since James F. Byrnes, the present Secretary of
State, who demanded criminal prosecution of the Negro
scholar, Dr.  B. DuBois, for calling upon Negroes to de-
fend themselves against lynchers after World War I.

Cla-rk’s Federal Grand Jury fought for the right ‘to lynch

Negroes. . _ . ,

THE FRAME-UP TRIAL

‘If the lynching of the boy veteran and his mother had
succeeded, their bodies would have been cut down at dawn
the next morning by the coroner, Bert Erwin, who would
have issued a coroner’s verdict, “hanged by persons unknown,”
and there would have been no trial. '

But, be-cause the lynching failed, there must be a trial to up-
hold the institution of lynching. Those who could not be

glynched must be convicted of a crime, to support the basic

proposition of the lynch gangs, expressed by our present Sec-
retary of State, James F. Byrnes, “that the mob very rarely, if
ever, does violence to any but the guilty Negro.” There must
be criminal charges, therefore the Negroes are charged with
violence that resulted solely from the effort to lynch them. I

The trial is the continuation of the lynching. It opened in
the same courtroom in Columbia in which Robert Wilson was
murdered, the courtroom from the wind-ow of which Henry
Choate was hanged and in which C. Hayes Denton’s and Bert

I Erwin’s mob organized the lynching of Cordie Cheek. Then,

 

to evade the constitutional guarantee against exclusion of Ne-
groes from the jury, it was removed to Lawrenceburg on the
pretense of giving a fair trial to the Negroes in a town where
they are not permitted to buy a meal in a restaurant or sleep
under a roof, or to enter any building except that of the
criminal court. '

No matter where it is continued, it is the same lynching,»_
directed by the same gang, against the same victims, for the .

same motive.

Therefore it is taken for granted by Joe Ingram, the local
judge, and by‘ the press of Columbia (and by the New York
Times) that this trial is an affair in which white men alone
control, and in which Negroes alone, if they can't be hanged,

89

go to prison. Joe Ingram ruled that a member of the Ku Klux
Klan is a ﬁt juryman to try Negroes, and admitted another
who said bluntly that he would not give a Negro a fair trial,
and others who said that as jurymen they would not give Ne-
groes the same rights as white men, or take a Negro’s word
if contradicted by a white man.

The ﬁrst trial opened August 13, 1946 at Lawrenceburg.
Six weeks were spent in a magnificent ﬁght by the attorneys
for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People to compel the acceptance of a jury from which Negroes
would not ‘be excluded, and when this was lost, to get a jury
promising at least to consider some of the rights of Negroes.
Two weeks more were spent in a trial rotten with the lynching
spirit, in which the district attorney, Paul Bumpus, sent word
to the defense attorney, Leon A. Ransom, that he would hit
him over the head with a chair if he dared again to contradict
the word of a white man. Lynn Bomar, in the presence of the
judge in the courtroom, shouted indecent language at Vincent
Sheean, noted writer, for reporting the manner of the trial,
and the judge smiled, refusing to interfere. * J

On October 4 the all-white jury brought in the ﬁrst verdict,
condemning John McKivens and Robert Gentry to 21 years in

prison. Julius Blair, James E. Morton and 21 others were it

acquitted by the same jury on the charge tried in this case.
Several of these will be tried again on other indictments, and
James Stephenson and his mother, Mrs. Gladys Stephenson,
and John Blackwell, Lloyd Kennedy and William Pillow re-
main to be tried with possible penalties of 21 years each in
prison.

A trial of a Negro by a jury from which Negroes are ex-
cluded is a lynching.’ ~

XIV
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT .

Our country is seething with lynch terror. Four murders
in one day and about eight or ten per month in the summer
of 1946 have raised the rate of lynching above the bloodiest.
days of the 189o’s, _

If the Negroes of Columbia, Tennessee, are sent to prison
for preventing a lynching, the Klan and other murder gangs
throughout the nation will take it as a free license—opening
wide the way for the blazing bonﬁre of human. victims, again
the blood-soaked rope hanging from courthouse windows,
another generation of white children raised in the moral gut-
ter, indoctrinated in the Hitler-like philosophy of “race”
murder—the “peculiar institution” of political control of a
state by lynching. '

The ﬁght to save the victims of this frame—up must be a great
movement of the people. There will be no federal action
against lynching unless a united and organized movement
of the people compels it. The people cannot rely upon the
initiative, or the honesty, or the decency of such men as Tom C.
Clark, or  Edgar Hoover, or Kenneth McKellar, Jim McCord,
Connally, Bilbo or Byrnes. By the aid of McKellar and Con-
nally in the Senate, and by the connivance of Tom Clark as

Attorney General, an inciter of lynching who boasts of his _

membership in the Ku Klux, Klan murder organization-
Theodore G. Bilbo—-“re-elected” by disfranchising 90 per cent
of the people of Mississippi and by lynch threats against half
the population of the state who are Negroes, is about to be
seated again as Senator and as ex-oﬂicio mayor of the nation’s
capital at Washington. The organizer of murders of Negroes
in Georgia, Eugene Talmadge, is about to become governor

of that state through lynch terror and disfranchisement of a
million Negro and white Georgians with the “legal” blessing

of Tom Clark and  Edgar Hoover. .

 

 

Fifteen years ago a great upsurge of the people, and a be-
ginning of unity of the trade unions with the Negro people,
convinced the Supreme Court that it was necessary to set aside
the eight death sentences of the innocent Negro boys, 14 to 20
years of age, who were about to be electrocuted at Scottsboro,
Alabama. I

A still greater mass movement and a far more powerful unity
of the Negro people and organized labor and progressive
white people must be set in motion to halt the wave of lynch-
ing that is aimed to destroy not only the Negroes but also the
trade unions and all democratic institutions.

The whole nation is concerned. Lynching could not ~ con-
tinue in the South if it was not supported by powerful forces
in the North. The shyster magistrates and coroners whose joy
it is to place ropes around the necksof Negro boys and push
them off to hang, are not powerful enough, alone, to destroy
democracy. They could not operate a single day without sup-
port of the giant monopoly corporations of the North who
control and loot the South’s economic resources and who speak
through such men as Vandenburg, Taft, Dewey and the Hoov-
ers (Herbert and J. Edgar). These gigantic trusts control
the nation’s economic and ‘political life through the corrupt
alliance of the Republican Vandenburgs and Deweys with the
Democratic Tom Clarks, Ed Crumps, McKellars, Tom Con-
nallys and James F. Byrneses.

In the small and beautiful city of Columbia, Tennessee, you
see reﬂected the stranglehold that the outside exploiters have
upon the South. The best mirror is Monsanto Chemicals,
whose control is not even as narrow as New York’s Wall Street,
but extends to the vast, world-wide monopoly of which the
German I. G. Farbenindustrie is a part. In the approach to
Columbia from Nashville is a huge billboard by the roadside
announcing that Columbia is ﬁeld headquarters of the Mon-

santo Chemicals Corporation. A vice-president of that cor-S

poration is the boss of the bosses of Columbia and Maury

92

 

 

County, and all the editors, coroners, magistrates, deputies,
constables, highway patrolmen, and the sheriffs of this and
neighboring counties, govern their acts accordingly. Robert
Rast Cole of Monsanto Chemicals does not telephone invita-
tions to lynchings or ﬁre pistols into the bodies of Negro boys
hanging from cedar trees, or sit as amember of‘ the all-white
juries, but no friends of Monsanto Chemicals are framed up
or lynched. This corporation, plus the Tennessee Knitting
Mills and two big department store chains, all owned in the
North, could destroy any Tennessee newspaper that told ten
per cent of the truth about the organized murders of the past

A twenty years in and around Columbia. They won’t tell it.

These monopolists of the North, operating in the South,
ruling the state through McKellar, Crump and McCord, and
whole communities, through such characters as Bumpus and
C. Hayes Denton, ﬁnd lynching a useful weapon with which
to ﬁght the progressive political upsurge of the Southern peo-

ple. The rapidly developing lynch gangs are their best hope ,

for ﬁghting the great American labor. movement that has
own from ,ooo,ooo to 1 ,ooo,ooo in twelve ears. The
8* 3 4 . . Y . V
have alread begun to use a ainst the or anization drives of
Y D 3 g
the C.I.O. and the A. F. of L. the same armed gangs that they

7 use against the Negroes.

 

The great trusts of the North need a lynch-ridden South,
a divided, unorganized, low-wage and voteless South, where
such men as Byrnes, Bilbo and Clark rise to the surface.

These giant corporations are gambling for a freer hand in
control of the nation, and the gambling has become more
feverish than ever because it is a gamble for permanent control
of the nation’s foreign policy, and of its man power for impe-
rialist adventures aimed at control of the world. They need
not only the Vandenburgs, Tafts and Deweys, but also a
Byrnes as Secretary of State, a Connally of Texas, a McKellar
of Tennessee, and a Tom Clark as Attorney General to de-
prive the people of constitutional guar.antees against the rob-
bery and oppression of the trusts.

Those are the reasons why the guarantees of the United

93

- * .. .>,.-..,.._,a.,.-,,,,..«,

 

 

 

 

States Constitution are not applied in defense of the rights of
the Negroes in Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana and
South Carolina. That is why Tom Clark and J. Edgar Hoover
give aid to the framed-up criminal prosecution of the Negroes
of Columbia for preventing a lynching.

Therefore a great mass movement of the white and Negro
people united ought to demand that President Truman re-
move Tom C. Clark and J. Edgar Hoover from olﬁce.

The people should compel the arrest, conviction and pun-
ishment under the full penalty of criminal law, of the public
oflicials and others guilty of the attempted lynching of James
Stephenson and his mother and the armed attack upon the
Negro community, and prosecution on murder charges of those
who killed Negro prisoners in their custody.

Arrest and prosecution under federal civil rights statutes
of Joe Ingram, Judge, and Paul F. Bumpus, District Attorney
General, and all others guilty of conspiracy to exclude Negroes
from jury panels and petty and grand juries, should be de-
manded.

Federal action must be forced, to begin criminal prosecu-
tion of living persons who participated in the murders of
Henry Choate, Cordie Cheek and other victims of lynch terror
in Maury County in past years. Particularly the arrest and
prosecution of C. Hayes Denton and Bert Erwin should be
compelled by the people.

Payment of an indemnity ‘to the families of the two Ne-

" groes murdered by the police and ‘to all those wounded in the

raid, or imprisoned, or whose property was destroyed, should be
demanded.

Every veterans’ organization must be aroused to ﬁght against
the frame-up of the Negroes of Columbia—ten of whom are
young Negro veterans of World VVar II and one a veteran of
World War I, commander of the Columbia Negro post of the
American Legion.

In every trade union, every veterans’ organization, every
church congregation, white and Negro, there should be ma-
terial and moral support for the innocent Negro victims in
Columbia, Tennessee.

94

 

 

The struggle to free the victims of the frame-up. at ‘Colum
bia must be made a battering ram to help destroy the whole
system of political murder known as lynching.

‘I3 =l= it

The faithless Federal Judge Davies, in aiding the frame-up
of the innocent Negroes at Columbia, furiously denounced
the Communist pressiand the Communist Party for denouncing
and exposing the attempted lynching and frame-up. Every

Southern man and woman, white and Negro, and especially

those of the labor movement, should consider seriously the
question: Isn't the political party denounced by such a man as
Davies the kind of party that you ought to belong to?
