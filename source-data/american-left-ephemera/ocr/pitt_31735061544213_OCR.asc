Socialist Party Platform

In the midst of the greatest crisis and bloodiest struggle of all history the Socialist Part
of America reaffirms its steadfast adherence to the principles of international brotherhoo 5
world peace and industrial democracy. l

The great war which has engulfed so much of civilization and destroyed millions of lives
is one of the natural results of the capitalist system of production. V

The Socialist Party, as the political expression of the economic interests of the working
class, calls upon them to take a determined stand on the_question of, militarism and war,
and to recognize the opportunity which the Great War has given them of forcing disarmament
and furthering the cause of industrial freedom.

An armed forcein the hands of the ruling class serves two purposes: to rotect and further
the polic of imperialism abroad and to silence by force the protest of t e workers against
industria despotism at home. Imperialism and militarism plunged Europe into this world-
war. America’s geographical and industrial situation has kept her out of the cataclysm.
But Europe's extremity has been the opportunit of America’s ruling class to amass enormous
proﬁts. As a result, there is a surfeit of capita which demands the policy of imperialism to
protect and further investments abroad. Hence thefrenzy of militarism into which the ruling
class has made every attempt to force the United States. a '

The workers in Europe were helpless to avert the war because they were already saddled
with the burden of militarism. The workers in the United States are yet free from this burden
and have the opportunity of establishing a working class policy and program against war-.
They can compel the government of the United States to lead the way in an international
movement for disarmament and to abandon the policy of imperialism which is forcing the
conquest of Mexico and must, if carried out, eventually plunge the United. States into a world-
war.

The working class must recognize the cry of preparedness against foreign invasion as a
mere cloak for the sinister purpose of imperialism abroad and industrial tyranny at home.
The class struggle, like capitalism, is international. The proletariat of the world has but one
enemy, the capitalist class, whether at home ar abroad. We must refuse to put into the hands
of Rhis enlemy z(t1nSar_rr1ed1fo1;i:<il_even1 under the guise of a “democratic army,” as the workers
0 ustra la an witzer an ave one.

Therefore‘ the Socialist Party stands opposed to military pre aredness, to any appro-T
priations of men or money for war or militarism, while control 0 such forces through the
political state rests in the hands of the capitalist class. The Socialist Partystands committed
to the class war, and urges upon the workers in the mines and forests, on the railways and ships,
in factories and ﬁelds, the use of their economic and industrial power, by refusing to mine the
coal, to transport soldiers,‘ to furnish food or other supplies for military purposes, and thus
keep out of the hands of the ruling class the control of armed forcesand economic power,
necessary for aggression abroad and industrial despotism at home.

The working class must recognize militarism as the greatest menace to all efforts toward
industrial freedom, and regardless of political or industrial affiliations must present a united
front in the ﬁght against preparedness and militarism.

Hideous as they are, the horrors of the far-stretched battleﬁeld of the old world are
dwarfed by the evil results of the capitalist system, even in normal times. Instead of being
organized to provide all members of society with an abundance of food, clothing and shelter,
and the highest attainable freedom and culture, industry is at present organized and conducted
for the benefit of a parasitic class. All the powers of government,sand all our industrial
genius, are directed to the end of securing to the relatively small class of capitalist investors
the largest amount of proﬁts which can be wrung from the labor of the ever-increasing class
whose only property is muscle and brain, manual and mental labor power.

The dire cons uences of this system are everywhere apparent. The workers are op-
Eressed and deprive of much that makes for physical, mental and moral well being. Year
_ y ear poverty and industrial accidents destroy more lives than all the armies and navies
in t e world.

. To preserve their privilege and power is the most vital interest of the possessing class,
while It 1s the most vital interest of the working class to resist oppression, improve its position,
and struggle to obtain security of life and liberty. Hence there exists a eonﬂict of interests,
a social war within the nation, which can know neither truce nor compromise. So long as

,.............,.._..._......_...u.aua-.g............__'.n.., . ,,

the few own and control the economic life of the nation the many must be enslaved, poverty
must coexist with riotous luxur , and civil strife prevail. , ..

The Socialist Party woul end these conditions .by're_organizing the life of the nation
upon the basis of Socialism. Socialism would not abolish private property, but greatly extend
it. We believe that every human being should have_and own all the things which he can use
to advantage, for the enrichment of his own life, withoutumposing disadvantage or burden
upon any other human being. Socialism admits the private ownership and individual
direction of all things, tools, economic processes and functionswhich are individual-
istic in character, and requires the collective ownership and democratic control
and direction of those which are social or collectivistic in character.

VVe hold that this country cannot enjoy happiness and prosperity at home and maintain
lasting peace with other nations, so long as its industrial wealth is monopolized by a capitalist
oligarch . In this, as in every other campaign, all special issues arising from temporary situa-
tions, whether domestic ‘or foreign, must be subordinated to the major issue——the need of such
a reorganization of our economic life as will remove the land, the mines, forests, railroads,
mills and factories, all the things required for our physical existence, from the clutches of

industrial and ﬁnancial freebooters and place them securely and permanently in the hands of
the eople.

plf men were free to labor to satisfy their desires there could be in this country neither
poverty nor involuntary unemployment. But the men in this country are not free to labor
to satisfy their desires. The reat industrial population can labor only when the capitalist
class, who own the i‘ndustries,%)elieve the can market their product at a proﬁt. The needs
of millions are subordinated to the gree s of a few. The situation is not unlike that of a
pyramid balanced upon its apex. Oftentimes this pyramid tumbles and industrial depression
comes. There was such a crash in 1907. If the capitalist owners had been willing to get out
of the way, industry could have been revived in a day. But the capitalist owners are never
willin to get out of the way. Their greeds come ﬁrst—the people's needs, if at all, afterward.
There ‘ore business did not quickly revive after the industrial depression of 1907. Mr. Taft
was elected to bring good times, but in four years failed to bring them. Mr. Wilson was elected
to bring good times, but not all of themeasures he advocated had the slightest effect upon
industry. The European war has brought to this country tremendous orders for military
supplies and has created a period of prosperity for the few. For the masses of the people
there is but an opportunity to work hard for a bare living, which is not prosperity, but slavery.
As against the boast of the present national administration that its political program, now
full in force, has brought-prosperit to the masses, we ‘call attention to the statement of the
Fe eral Public Health Service that 800 a year is required to enable a famil to avoid physical
deterioration through lack of decent living conditions, that more than half’of the families of
working men receive less than that amount, that nearly a third receive less than $500 a year,

«and that one family in twelve receives less than $300 a year. .

The capitalist class, for a great many years, has been trying to saddle upon. this country
a greater army and a greater navy. A greater army is desired to keep the working class of
the United States in subjection. A greater navy is desired to safeguard the foreign invest-
ments of American capitalists and to “back up" American diplomacy in its efforts to gain
foreign markets for American capitalists. The war in Europe, which diminished and is still
diminishing the remote possibility of European attack upon the United States, was nevertheless
seized upon by capitalists and by unscrupulous politicians as a means of spreading fear through-.
out the country, to the” end that, by false pretenses, reat military establishments mi ht be
obtained. We denounce such “preparedness," as both false in principle, unnecessary in c arac-
ter and dangerous in its plain tendencies toward militarism. We advocate that sort of social
preparedness which expresses itself in better homes, better bodies and better minds, which are
alike the products of plenty and the necessity of effective defense in war. ,

The Socialist Party maintains its attitude of unalterable opposition to war.

We reiterate the statement that the competitive nature of capitalism is the cause of modern
war, and that the co-operative nature of Socialism is alone adapted to the task of ending war
by removing its causes. We assert, however, that, even under he resent capitalist order,

additional measures can be taken to safeguard peace, and to this end‘: we demand:

MEASURES T0 INSURE PEACE

(1) That all laws and appropriations for the increase of the military and naval forces
of the United States shall be immediately re ealed.

(2) That the power be taken from the Bresident to lead the nation into a position which
leaves no escape from war. No one man, however exalted in official station, should have the
power to decide the question of peace or war for a nation of a hundred millions. To give one
man such power is neither democratic nor safe. Yet the President exercises such power when
he determines what shall be the nation's foreign policies and what shall be the nature and
tone of its diplomatic intercourse with other nations. We, therefore, demand that the power
to ﬁx foreign policies and conduct diplomatic negotiations shall be lodged in Congress

 

...,- ~< .,...n,_,....._,.._.......—... ~.......,.e..—..~ ~~—--s,-

 

and shall be exercised publicly, the people reserving the right by referendum to order Congress,
at any time, to change its foreign policy. A '

s (3) That no war shall be declared or waged by the United States without a referendurn
vote of the entire people, except for the purpose of repelling invasion.

(4) That the Monroe Doctrine shall be immediately abandoned as a danger so great
that even its advocates are agreed that it constitutes perhaps our greatest single danger of
war. The Monroe Doctiine was originally, intended to safeguard the peace "of the United
States. Though the Doctrine has changed from a safeguard to a menace, the capitalist class
still defends it for the reason that our great capitalists desire to retain South and Central
America as their private trade preserve. We favor the cultivation of social, industrial and
political friendship with all other nations in the western hemisphere, as an approach to a world
confederation of nations, but we oppose the Monroe Doctrine because it takes from our hands
the peace of America and places it in the custody of any nation that would attack the sov-
ereignty of any state in the western world.

(5) That the independence of the Philippine Islands be immediately recognized as a
measure of justice both to the Filipinos and to ourselves. The Filipinos are entitled to self-
government: we are entitled to be freed from the necessity of building and maintaining enough
dreadnoughts to defend them in the event of war. -

(6) The government of the United States shall call a congress of all neutral nations to
mediate between the belligerent powers in an effort to establish an immediate and lasting peace
without indemnities, or forcible annexation of territory, and based on a bindin and enforceable
international treaty, which shall provide for concerted disarmament on lan and at sea and
for an International Congress with power to adjust all disputes between nations, and which
shall guarantee freedom and equal rights to all oppressed nations and races.
