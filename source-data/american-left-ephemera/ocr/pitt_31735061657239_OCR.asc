committee hearings than any patient search for truth. In
the words of Dr. Robert K. Carr, author of The House
Committee on Un-American Activities, opportunity has
been given for “certain of the most incompetent and
thoughtless members of Congress to run hog-wild. . . .”
Typical of committee procedure has been the practice of
giving unproved accusations against victims to the press
and radio, as in the case of Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam, who
in self-defense begged the House committee for an oppor-
tunity to refute the accusations. When it wa.s desired to
discredit Dr. Condon of the National Bureau of Standards,
the committee released part of a letter written by J. Edgar
Ho-over of the FBI; the part suppressed contained Hoover's
statement that the FBI had investigated Dr. Condon’s loy-
alty and had found no grounds for doubting it. Nevertheless
Dr. Condon was frozen out of federal service.

In this connection, ‘guilt by association’ is a main asset
in the committees’ grab for headlines. Dr. X was a member
of an organization in which Communists were members;
ergo, Dr. X is either a Communist or a fellow-traveler and
ﬁnds himself on a committee blacklist. Thereafter he will
be referred to as “identiﬁed” as a Red via either a letter-
head or the unconﬁrmed testimony of an informer.

Perhaps Chairman Harold H. Velde of the House com-
mittee touched the all-time high when he subpoenaed for-
mer President Truman, Justice Tom Clark and Governor
Byrnes of South Carolina after Attorney-General Brownell
had accused Truman of “knowingly promoting a Soviet spy”
in federal service. This, Velde said, promised to be “a juicy
hearing” and his committee had to “get into the act.” All
three men ignored Velde’s subpoenas and the Washington
Star called him a “witless buffoon” for his efforts. At the
next election Velde did not stand. Like his predecessor,
Congressman Martin Dies, he decided not to run for re-
election.

Headlines are indispensable to “exposure,” to destroy-
ing men’s lives and their reputations. In the 1957 hearings
in San Francisco, those which took the life of William
Sherwood, the scientist, Chairman Walter insisted that
TV’s Klieg lights be played, in deﬁance of the rules of the
House. Speaker Sam Rayburn tersely ordered the lights
doused; Chairman Walter ordered that they stay on.

THE AIR MUST BE CLEANED

The fallout from the committees’ activities has befouled
the moral and intellectual atmosphere of the United States.
Until this period in our history, differences of opinion have
been considered normal. Now they are ascribed by these
committees, and their private imitators, to the basest mo-
tives only. "

The committees insist that our social structure is honey-
combed with d_isloyal persons, that public ofﬁcials are spies,
teachers are subversive, scientists weak links in our secu-
rity set-up, the movies tainted with foreign propaganda.
Small wonder that Walter Lippmann could say: “There is
a kind of smog in what should be the clean and open air of
this free land, a smog that makes men nervous, makes them
afraid to speak their minds, makes them not sure they dare
to keep their minds open.”

Artie Shaw,Iithe ‘band leader, conﬁrms Lippmann. In an
appearance before the House committee, he said: “. . . I
Wouldn’t sign anything today unless I had the advice of
seven lawyers and the granting of permission or clearance
by this committee.” Robert Rossen, a movie producer, who
had been ‘uncooperative’ in a previous appearance before
the committee, changed his mind. “I did a lot of thinking,”
he told the committee. “I don’t think, after two years of
thinking, that any one individual can even indulge himself
in the luxury of individual morality.” -'

RESTORE THE FIRST AMENDMENT

The gravest offense of the committees has been their
endeavor -to tear to shreds the guarantees of the First
Amendment for freedom of expression, thought and associ-
ation. At last the Supreme,Court, in the Watkins decision,
has halted the committees’ drive to tear the Bill of Rights
from the Constitution. »

“Clearly,” said the Court, “an investigation is subject
to the command that the Congress shall make no law
abridging freedom of speech or press or assembly. While
it is true that . . . an investigation is not a law, nevertheless
an investigation is part of law-making. It is justiﬁed solely
as an adjunct to the legislative process. . . . There is no
general authority to expose the private affairs of individ-
uals without justiﬁcation in terms of the function of Con-

9

 

gress. . . . Nor is the Congress a law enforcement or trial
agency. These are functions of the executive and judicial
departments of government. No inquiry is an end in itself.”

The Court denounced the “broad-scale intrusion into the
lives and affairs of private citizens.” “We have no doubt,”
it added, “that there is no congressional power to expose
for the sake of exposure,” particularly when it is to “gather
data this is neither desired by the Congress nor useful to it.”

THE COMMITTEES LACK LAWFUL FUNCTIONS

The Supreme Court’s opinion is most explicit in protect-
ing freedom of speech, press, religion, political belief and
association against “all forms of governmental action.” If
the committees lack legislative purpose and are forbidden
to “expose for exposure’s sake,” what then is left for them
to do?

The subject of communism has been sucked dry by the
committees. To the thousands of books that have been pub-
lished since 1917 they have added millions of words in re-
ports occupying far more space than Dr. Eliot's ﬁve-foot
shelf of the classics. For this we have paid some $2,500,000
since 1938. The public suffers from no lack of enlighten-
ment on this subject! As for espionage and sabotage, the
Department of Justice is well armed with laws and means
of- enforcement. Regarding domestic subversion—-if this
means attempts forcibly to overthrow the government-—the
Department of Justice is similarly equipped. Insofar as
“subversion” means the expression of unpopular and un-
orthodox opinions, this matter within a democracy is be-
yond the legitimate reach of the authorities. What a citizen
may think or join in a peaceful manner is his business and
not that of roaming committees.

If the committees have no lawful function, it is useless
to suggest reforms in procedure. Such committees are self-
corrupting. Nor is the proposal that their function be trans-
ferred to the judiciary committees likely to be fruitful.
What would be the point of shifting functions which are
unconstitutional? In any event the example given us by the
Internal Security sub-committee of the Senate’s Judiciary
Committee is sufficient answer to such a proposal. This sub-
committee, chaired successively by Senators Mc-Carran,
Jenner and Eastland, has easily equalled in infamy the ex-

10

 

 

ploits of Senator McCarthy’s committee and the House com-
mittee. As President Washington said to Jefferson regard-
ing the Society of the Cincinnati: “No, not a ﬁber of it
must be retained—no half way measures will sufﬁce. If the
thing is bad, it must be totally abolished.”

WE NEVER DID LIKE INQUISITORS

How did the Republic ever survive for 150 years with-
out the help of such committees? It must be admitted that
others in our history have had the same notion as Martin
Dies and Joe McCarthy. But they didn’t last. Back in 1798
there were the Alien and Sedition Laws, aimed partly at an
assumed French revolutionary threat but mostly at domes-
tic opponents of President Adams and his Federalist re-
gime. That exercise in un-Americanism was repudiated
when Thomas Jefferson was swept into oﬂ‘lce on a platform
dedicated to liberty. In 1854 a Know-Nothing legislature in
Massachusetts essayed an investigation into “un-American”
Catholicism. In 1859 the slavery element in Congress had a
committee at work investigating un-American abolitionists.
The guns at Fort Sumter silenced that committee. Although
the North was alive with Copperheads during the Civil
War, Congress refrained from any investigation. Despite
other “un-American” manifestations, we managed to get
through World War I without congressional investigations.

The present Un-American Activities Committee was
created in 1938, mainly to look into Nazi propaganda. “The
substantial majority given the resolution,” says Dr. Carr,
author of the deﬁnitive history of the committee, “unques-
tionably reﬂected this fear of fascism.” It was stipulated
that the committee would end its labors within seven
months. It is still functioning today.

ABOLITION—A CHALLENGE

Abolition of the inquisitorial committees of Congress
will be the mightiest blow struck for libertyin this country
since the Alien and Sedition Laws expired in 1801, the
slaves were freed in 1863, and segregation was doomed in
1954. By removing the blight that has descended upon our
moral and intellectual life in the past twenty years, the

nation can once more explore the facts of life, and cope

with them, instead of chasing nightmares. Our people again
11

 

can enjoy the freedom that made America for -generations
the envy and beacon light of the world. Security for citizens
in thought and person and association will lead to a sincere
esteem by the rest of mankind and a true national security
more meaningful than that defended solely by armed force
and political police.

Abolition will be a signal the world over that the era of
McCarthyism has ended. .

But it will require more than the noble words of the
Supreme Court in the Watkins, Sweezy and J encks deci-
sions to unshackle the nation. Months after these decisions,
Senators Jenner and Eastland were threatening a contempt
citation against Mrs. Grace Lorch, the brave Arkansas
woman who shielded a Negro girl from hoodlums at Little
Rock's Central High School. Since June 17,1957, precious
little public support has been expressed to buttress judicial
decisions for freedom. The committees still roam the coun-
try, scattering summonses, subpoenaes and threats of con-
tempt citations far and wide.,~The nation, all too evidently,
is still shell-shocked from McCarthyism. Partisans of lib-
erty have been too timid. -C_ongres_smen- opposed to the
House committee estimate that a hundred of their fellows
would stand up and vote against continuance -now, if they
could see public support rallying behind them.

The road to Abolition in the 1950s is as rocky as it was
for the Abolitionists of- the 1850s. The slave power today,
wielded over minds and hearts of free people, is deeply en-
trenched behind fearful ramparts of know-nothingism,
anti-intellectualism, hatred of progress.

BUT IT CAN BE DONE!

Because the task of regaining liberty is ‘difficult, the
challenge is all the greater. The House committee in 1945
was near death and revived only by a parliamentary trick
engineered by Congressman John Rankin of "Mississippi.
Today the revulsion against the black curtain of fear and
conformity mounts across the nation as We realize that we
have sacriﬁced many of our bravest scientists and thinkers
on the altars of “un-Americanism.” The truth is borne in
upon us that this nation cannot survive unless it is free to
think and to act. We cannot afford the luxury of preferring
Spookniks to Sputniksl. .- i . .

How typical it was of the ‘House committee to denounce

the present Abolition campaign as “un-American.” Entirely.

in keeping with its ‘usual style was the committee’s re-

sponse to the arguments advanced. The committee declined»

to answer; instead its clerks were sent into‘ the ﬁles con-
taining the names of more than a million citizens to offer
in evidence the past activities’ of the proponents of Aboli-
tion. And what were these activities? For the most part,
the championing of civil liberty! The only contribution the
House committee was able to make to national enlighten-
ment was the caption used for its 19-page propaganda blast
(paid for by the taxpayers) : Operation Abolition. For that
we are grateful. » »

The black curtain is always thin; it can be torn aside
whenlbrave people decide this country has suffered enough.
Courage is contagious. The hundred Congressmen now who
are opposed to the committee can become a majority, if we
marshal] strength behind them.

Members of the House who have voted in the past

against the committee have not only won re-election but

many have advanced to the Senate. Senator Jackson of
Washington cast ﬁve votes against the committee while in
the House; _Senators Mansﬁeld of Montana and Kefauver
of Tennessee, four votes each; Senators Smith of Maine,
Neely of West Virginia and J avits of New York, three each.
The inquisitional Caesars are not invincible!

In the House_ many Congressmen have been re-elected
repeatedly since 1948 despite opposition to the committee.
Congressman Wier of Minnesota has voted ﬁve times
against the committee; Celler of New York and Blatnik of
Minnesota, four times each; Holiﬁeld of California, Multer
of New York, O’Hara of Illinois, and Powell of New York,
three times each;

Name to yourself the outstanding newspapers of the
country——the New York Times and the Herald Tribune, the
Christian Science Monitor, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the
Denver Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Chicago Sun-
Times, the Washington Post, the Providence Journal, the
Louisville Courier-Journal, the Detroit Free Press—a11 of
them and many another have excoriated these committees.-
For it is freedom of the press, among other liberties, that
these committees have been aiming at.

13

 

 

 

Churchmen, publicists, scientists, university leaders,
among the thoughtful men and women of this country, have
spoken out to condemn the depredations on freedom. com-
mitted by these committees.

Who, one might ask, has defended them? Indeed, how
few—-but how vocal! The Hearst newspapers and the back-
ward-looking press, though even they weaken now in their
adulation; noisy spokesmen for certain veterans’ organiza-
tions never noted for their faith in democracy; the back-
wash of bigotry——how few indeed the forces which are
sheltered behind this dark curtain of fear and conformity,
but how apparently potent they seem! Congressmen cower
before them and many among us fear that they speak for
the quiet majority instead of the strident minority.

Now we can no longer afford to grope in man!-made
darkness. The time has come to show faith in the American
people--faith and courage. We will speak out, we will be
heard, we demand Abolition of this scourge which threat-
ens to extinguish liberty and to undermine the future of
our nation.

{:7 no other group of publicity-mad zealots could
ever be allowed to tarnish with their stench
the greater institution of our democracy-
our halls of Congress-”—Detroit FREE PRESS,
Oct. 28, 1947'.

From the committee’s beginning, in 1938

under Martin Dies, the American Civil Lib-

ﬂ erties Union has demanded Abolition because

“the letter and spirit of the First Amend-

ment” make the committee’s mandate “un-
constitutional or unwise, or both.”

Congressman Roy W. Wier: “I think I've
got the cure for the whole controversy and
that is to wipe out the Committee. It as-

- sumes to be the investigator, the judge and
* the jury and even takes over judicial author-
C ity in the disposition of its cases. What’s
more, I don’t like the way they are using
the Committee to make headlines in the dis-
tricts of the men running for re-election.”

which “cannot easily be “accomplished”, or
“by dissolving the committee on the ground
that in twenty years of operation it has com-
pleted its purpose and is no longer needed.
 . We think the time has arrived when en-
forcement of the laws may be left, safely,
to the appropriate ;police agencies of the

On June 30, 1.957, the Louisville COURIER-

long tenure of the House Un-American Ac-
tivities Committee, its sub-committees and
its Senate‘ aﬂiliates have dragged the Commit»

truths or conspiracies that weren't already
known. They have done this with an eye to
the notoriety that might be gleaned, but with-
out any real legislative purpose in mind or-
any objective other than the embarrassment
and humiliation of witnesses and the gather-

‘I For

AB OLITION

of the Inquisitorial Committees of Congress

On June 16', 1957, William K. Sherwood, a 41-
year old Stanford University research scientist,
harassed by the House Un-American Activities
Committee, V took his life.

Three days later, his widow Barbara came be-
fore the San Francisco hearings of the congres-
sional body to present a statement on her hus-
band's death. Committee Chairman Francis E.
Walter, Pennsylvania Democrat, refused to permit

. her to read her statement,

Here, in part, is Barbara Sherwood’s testi-
mony:

Members of the House Un-American Activities Com-
mittee:

You have helped to kill my husband and make my four
children fatherless. _

This is our personal tragedy.

It is as nothing to the crime you have committed against
the children of America and the children of the world.

For when you drove my husband to his death, you de-
stroyed a man of bright promise, a talented ﬁghter in the
army of devoted men who are warring against disease.

, Throughout his lifetime my husband had but one goal-
to ease the suffering of mankind.

It was this goal that drew him to support the Loyalists
in the Spanish Civil War, that inspired his youthful identi-
ﬁcation with radical causes.

It was this goal that led him, when greater maturity
had mellowed and deepened his understanding, to abandon
politics completely and devote himself single-mindedly to
science.

Is it a crime for a young man in his 20s to dream of a
bright new world? —~ -

 

Must the children of our country leave their idealism in
the cradle so that their future careers will not be blighted
by the Un-American Activities Committee? .

Go away, go home,’ bow your heads in prayer and ask
forgiveness of your God.

In his farewell note, Sherwood wrote:

“My life and my livelihood are now threatened by the
House committee. . . . I will be in two days assassinated by
publicity. . . . I would love to spend the next few years in
laboratories and I would hate to spend them in jail.”

In a letter to the House committee which he had in-
tended to give to Chairman Walter, Sherwood said:

“The Committee’s trail is strewn with blasted lives and
wreckage of youthful careers.”

Sherwood, who was working with a grant from the
Cancer Society of America and the Rockefeller Institute of
Medicine, believed he had found a possible physical link
between cancer, some of the heart diseases, and schizo-
phrenia. Dr. C. B. Van Niel, supervisor of the research
project, said it will now be dropped, since “there is nobody
else who could carry out the wor .”

Sherwood died one day before the United States Su-
preme Court handed down its decision in the Watkins case
—June 17, 1957—excoriating “exposure for exposure’s
sake” and condemning the House committee’s punitive in-
quisitions.

SPOOKNIKS INSTEAD OF SPUTNIKS?

William Sherwood is but one victim of the inquisition
to which this country had been subjected since 1938, when
Martin Dies set up the ﬁrst committee on “un-American ac-
tivities.” Many other committees, in both‘House and Sen-
ate, at the taxpayers’ expense, have been established to
harry people who, under traditional American law, could
not be convicted of any crime.

~Has our security increased? The sputniks beeping as
they race around the globe seem to jeer: “What has hap-
pened to American science?” What greater blow has been
struck against America’s progress than the success of the
House committee and Senator McCarthy’s committee in

2

 

 

driving out of ‘government service men of the stature of
Dr. Edward U. Condon, former head of the National Bu-
reau of Standards, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the atomic sci-
entist, and others? Such men of independent mind explore
the unknown. If, in addition, their sympathies are broadly
human, they seem somehow dangerous to men like Joe Mc-
Carthy, Martin Dies and Francis Walter. So while the Rus-
sians lift Sputniks into the skies, we are invited to shudder
at Spookniks haunting our whole national life.

None of the inquisitorial committees has yet produced
a single instance in which an American scientist divulged
conﬁdential information about atomic energy or national
security to an unauthorized person. Enemies might well
seek to assassinate our leading scientists, observed Alan
Barth, editorial writer of the Washington Post: “How
much more simply the same results can be achieved by a
few words craftily spoken before some legislative commit-
tee. . . . Character assassination is at_ once easier and surer
than physical assault.”

The inquisitorial committees have been the bellows
spewing forth across the nation a miasma of spy-crazed
fear. It was the House committee that gave national cur-
rency to a crackpot’s charge that Harry Hopkins, President
Roosevelt’s conﬁdant, had transmitted stolen atomic secrets
to the Russians. Former President Truman was accused of
knowingly promoting a “Soviet spy” in high federal service;
Senator McCarthy obligingly extended his “twenty years
of treason” charge against the Democratic Party to twenty-
one years to include Eisenhower’s ﬁrst year.

The poison was injected repeatedly into the nation's
veins. Senator Jenner of the Internal Security subo-commit-
tee was charging that General George Marshall, Chief of
Staff and later Secretary of State, was a “living 1ie,” not
only willing but eager to play the role of a front man for
traitors. Later he accused former Foreign Minister Lester
B. Pearson of Canada, winner of the Nobel peace prize, of
sheltering Soviet spies.

We lag in security, said the San Francisco Chronicle,
because of “the climate that has surrounded American sci-
ence—and much of its technology—in recent years, a cli-
mate distinguished by its top secrets and classiﬁed knowl-
edge and fearful suspicions that have sent many an able

3

 

man into coventry. This sequestration of knowledge,‘ this
disqualiﬁcation of eminent scientists like Dr. J. Robert
Oppenheimer, this deliberate rejection of the great cumula-
tive Worth of scientiﬁc achievement freely shared, has be-
come the American way ever since Senator Joseph Mc-
Carthy and his trembling disciples began preaching the
wisdom of ‘security.’ ” A ' '

 

In assessing the losses to scientiﬁc progress through the

witch hunts, We must add to the known victims an incalcul-
able number of young scientists who have avoided govern-
ment service entirely in order to remain free. Walter Lipp-
mann has commented: “What McCarthyism did to the
inner conﬁdence of American scientists and thinkers has

constituted one of the great national tragedies of the post-

war era. It is impossible to measure the damage."

“UN-AMERICANISM” NARROW, DARK,
AND BRUTAL

“Who can deﬁne the meaning of ‘un-American’?” the
U. S. Supreme Court asked in the Watkins decision. Dis-

cussing the House authorization of the Uni-American Ac-‘

tivities Committee, the Court added that “it would be diffi-
cult to imagine a less explicit authorizing resolution."
“What,” asked the Court, “is that single solitary ‘principle
of the form of government as guaranteed by our Consti-
tution ?’ ” ’ -

The President’s Advisory Committee on Universal Mili-

tary Training cut through to the marrow when it com-
mented that “an epithet is not an argument. ‘Un-American’
means simply that it has not been done before in America.
If Americans Want it, it becomes American.” It might be
noted that there is no un-British Activities ‘Committee, or

un-French or un-Ghana or un-Thai. In other lands, the.

notion is considered uniquely American and un-human.
The New York Times observed that “the special com-
mittee to investigate un-American Activities suffered from
ambiguity at its birth. Just What is an un-American activ-
ity? The law deﬁnes crimes against the state, and persons
committing ‘such crimes are admittedly un-American. But
is it un-American to hold an unpopular opinion . . . or take
an attitude that is also held or taken by the Communists?”

4

 

Perhaps the most biting comment was made by a for-
mer Attorney-General, Francis Biddle: “The [Hollywood]
hearings show the absurdity of the committee’s yardstick
——un-Amerricom, activities. The phrase itself is meaningless
and sterile, reﬂectingthe timid longing to be correct, an
attitude at its best as depersonalized as the culture of
Hollywood to which the investigation was directed, at its
worst, narrow, dark, and brutal.”

THE CONTAGION OF FEAR

It was of such men as William Sherwood, the Stanford
scientist, that the Supreme Court was thinking, in its Wat-
kins decision, when it said: A

“And when those forced revelations concern matters
that are unorthodox, unpopular, or even hateful to the gen-
eral public, the reaction in the life of the witness may be
disastrous. This effect is even more harsh when it is past
beliefs, expressions or associations that are disclosed and
judged by current standards rather than those contempo-
rary with the matters exposed. Nor does the witness alone
suffer the consequences. Those who are identiﬁed by wit-
nesses and thereby placed in the same glare of publicity
are equally subject to public stigma, scorn and obloquy.
Beyond that, there is the more subtle and immeasurable
effect upon those who tend to adhere to the most orthodox
and uncontroversial views and associations in order to
avoid a similar fate at some future time.”

An ‘outstanding achievement of the committees has been
«“to make intolerance synonymous with patriotism.” Chief
Judge Henry W. Edgerton of the federal circuit court in
Washington observed that the effect of the committees’ in-
vestigations “is not limited to the people whom the com-
mittee stigmatizes or calls before it, but extends to others
who hold similar views and to still others who might be
disposed to adopt them. It is not prudent to hold views or
to" join groups that the committee had condemned. People
have grown wary of expressing any unorthodox opinion.
No one can measure the inroad the committee has made in
the American sense of freedom to think. There has been
some suggestion that it restrains only timid people. I think
it is nearer the truth to say that, among the more articu-

5

 

late, it affects in one degree or another all, but the very
courageous, the very orthodox, and the very secure.”

The House committee inaugurated the era of fear and
conformity that has characterized our nation in the past
generation. It has waged ideological warfare against those
with whom it disagreed. It has set up a cult of loyalty, at-
tended by a hunt for heresy which has silenced, in large
measure, fundamental rights of advocacy and association-
cornerstones of effective democracy. The names of more
than one million Americans, the House committee brags,
are contained in its ﬁles.

To spread the contagion, the House committee has en-
couraged witch-hunting across the country. State commit-
tees which ape their model sprang up in California, Massa-
chusetts, Washington state, Ohio and Illinois. It has stimu-
lated private “patriotic” groups to stigmatize those who
deviate in the slightest degree from the narrow conﬁnes of
‘Americanism’ as deﬁned by these groups. The latest ex-
ample of the contagion is the Thomson racial committee in
Virginia, which confounds segregation with Americanism.

Henry Steele Commager, an eminent historian, has
written: “We should not forget that our tradition is one of
protest and revolt, and it is stultifying to celebrate the
rebels of the past——Jefferson and Paine, Emerson and
Thoreau—-—while we silence the rebels of the present.”

ORDERLY PROGRESS HALTED

The inquisitorial committees have halted orderly social
progress. That indeed is uppermost in the desires of men
like Senators Eastland and Jenner. To them there is no
dividing line between the New Deal, say, and revolution.
If their policy ever controlled America, it would force an
opponent of an existing condition to try “overthrow by
force and violence” because they throw up road blocks in
the way of peaceful argument and orderly change. Their
dismal challenge to evolution has been partly successful;
the nation has been nearly on dead center in social advance
since Martin Dies began his operations in 1938. Forces of
progress have been obliged to ﬁght desperate rearguard
actions against the various Congressional inquisitorial
committees.

It is notable that the committees have often acted in a
way that could help powerful private interests against the
interest of the majority. The ﬁrst group investigated after
World War II was the Oﬂice of Price Administration.
Sinister inﬂuences were sought by the committee among
those who tried to hold prices down, and meanwhile busi-
ness carried on a propaganda that prices would be lower if
left to seek their natural level. Prices have gone up ever
since. In many other aspects, the committees have followed
closely a 1934 report of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce,
urging action against “subversive propaganda,” which was
adopted by the Chamber on May 2, 1935, and ampliﬁed at
other Chamber meetings since.

The committees have lent themselves to the side of em-
ployers in certain union elections, have helped to split the
trade union movement and to assist reactionary politicians
in election campaigns. Insofar as they could confound union
militancy with ‘un-Americanism’ in the public mind, the
committees have checked the eiforts of unions to keep up
with the high cost of living; this must have cost the Amer-
ican people billions in the spread between wages and prices.

Throughout, the committees have been guilty of the un-
forgivable sin in a democracy——that of seeking to stiﬂe
criticism. Not only the Daily Worker, but what committee
spokesmen call its “uptown edition,” the New York Times,
has been the target of Senator Eastland’s Internal Security
sub-committee. Not only the Communist Party, but the
Ford Foundation’s Fund for the Republic has been the tar-
get of the House committee, its way cleared by the Cox
special committee set up in 1952 to determine whether
“such foundations and organizations are using their re-
sources for un-American or subversive activities or for
purposes not in the interest or tradition of the United
States”—whatever such a mishmash of words may mean.

HEADLINE HUNTING

In its Watkins decision, the Supreme Court noted that
“investigations conducted solely for the personal aggran-
dizement of the investigators or to ‘punish’ those investi-
gated are indefensible.”
