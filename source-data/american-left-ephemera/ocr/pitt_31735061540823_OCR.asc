THE NIXON DOCTRINE? GENOCIDE
THROUGH TECHNOLOGY} WHILE
BRINGING THE BOYS HOME

Richard Nixon has spent more time
trying to end the antiwar movement
than trying to end the war. His
troop withdrawals and rhetoric about
a "generation of peace" are perhaps
comforting to some Americans but
they are a cruel hoax for the people
of Indochina.

The bombing of South Vietnam is
greater than ever, damaging a natural
environment and culture in funda-
mental ways. In preparation for a
Nixon-style peace, tens of thousands
of peasants are now scheduled to be
moved from their homes near the DMZ
to Southern-most Vietnam. This is a
dramatic climax to the "forced ur-
banization" policy designed to sep-
arate the fish (guerrillas) from
the sea (people). In fact these
programs have transformed South Viet
nam from a rural society to one of
slums and concentration camps.

Meanwhile the secret air war against
Laos is turning that country into

an utter wasteland, and once peace-
ful Cambodia has become a scene of
permanent bloodletting. The bombing
of North Vietnam has been renewed,
and even "responsible" critics of
the war are warning that ‘tactical
nuclear weapons" may soon be used.

All this is part of a cynical Nixon
Doctrine which assumes that the
American people will be docile, or
at least controllable so long as
American casualty rates are going
down. The Nixon strategy is to pro-
long the war, by technological means
until the other side is totally
devastated.

People with anti-war convictions
must'not let the Nixon Administra-
tion turn our original demands for
troop withdrawals an negotiations
into the justifying rhetoric for a
policy of rising technological

slaughter.

INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY
THROUGH PEOPLE'S DIPLOMACY

International solidarity between
people--especially the Vietnamese
and Americans--has proven to be an
absolutely indispensable factor in
opposing U.S. agression. The U.S.
government would like to keep the
public misinformed (as they do to-

day about Laos) and maintain
the illusion that our represen-
tatives will "negotiate peace".
But the anti-war movement has
developed a powerful weapon to
expose this deception: Peoples
Diplomacy, through which friend-
ly contacts are created between
the American people and the
Asian people who are supposedly
"the enemy".

People's diplomacy is crucial
to offset the brainwashing of
the U.S., government and press,
and to stimulate a radical
awareness of what the government
is doing in our name. It is also
crucial to help Americans under-
stand the positive spirit and
accomplishments of revolutionary
Asian communism which the U.S.
is trying to destroy with every-
thing from press blackouts to
thousand ound bombs.

Here are a few of the specific
accomplishments of peoples dip-
lomacy so far: '

 

-More than 100 anti-war
have visited North Viet-
nam and returned with

evidence exposing the truth
about U.S. bombing and
the Vietnamese resistance;

-American prisoners have
been returned to the peace
movement in gestures of
good will.

-Numerous conferences be-
tween American and Vietna-
mese. Congressman Ronald
Dellums recently attended
such a meeting becoming
the first elected official
to participate in Peoples
Diplomacy.

-The Black Panther Party
has an officially recog-
nized International Section
Headquarters in Algiers.
This office recently spon-
sored a delegation of Ameri-
can radicals that was able
to travel to China, North
Korea, and Vietnam.

-The U.S. National Student
Association president has
just returned from Hanoi and
Paris with 16 student gover-
nment presidents and editors
of campus newspapers who for-
mally signed a statement of
peace with their Vietnamese
counterparts.

WHY THIS INITIATIVE

Berkeley citizens, like other
Americans, have been frustrated in
trying to "vote for peace" before.

We have been lied to by Presidential
candidates, or we have voted for
peace candidates or peace initiatives
which have registered our opinion

but had no direct effect on the war.

Voting for the Peace Treaty Ini-
tiative, however, will be different
because it opens up a direct way
to move towards peace. First,the
measure calls for an official dele-

gation, selected from a "town mee-
ting" to extend our solidarity to
the other side. The Berkeley dele-
gatio" could include the Mayor or
membe_s of the City Council, members
of anti-war groups, or simply a
cross-section of the many kinds of
people living here. The delegation
would extend Berkeley's official
solidarity to the Indochinese people
and work out agreements for conti -
nued cooperation and exchanges. On
returning, the delegation would an-
nounce the results of their trip
nationally, report back to Berkeley
citizens, suggest new local pro-
grams against the war, and encourage
people in other cities to begin
Peoples Diplomacy. The cost of the
entire trip for five people would

be about $7000 an ampunt already
pledged by individuals in the anti-
war movement when the initiative
passes.

Secondly, passing this initiative
would also commit the city govern-
ment to provide protection to young
people resisting the draft and the
war. Private individuals I lawyers
organizations,even the state of
Massachusetts--have failed in at-
tempts to get a court ruling against
the war. It is therefore time to
turn the issue around and make the
U.S. government decide if it is
Constitutional for a city to offer
legal assistance to resisters of
the war. By adopting this stand,
Berkeley can take the initiative
and make the U.S. government deal
with "civil disobedience" by one
of its own cities. This challenge
will be felt politically as one

which could spread elsewhere. Final-'

ly the city certainly has the dis-
creationary power of law enforcement
which could be used to pursue fur-

ther legal action or at least create
a climate for anti-war resisters
here.

agux:Ler as ARINTERNAIIONAI
curt

Berkeley can become the first
American city to take up Peoples
Diplomacy as public policy. other
cities which already have passed
anti-war referendums certainly
could follow Berkeley's lead. This
would force the U.S. governemnt
to recognize that the American
people are acting on their own to
create the peace which the govern-
ment is trying to avoid.

when a government is immoral-and
illegitimate it is altogether
right for citizens to become in Eug
ene Debs words, "citizens of the
world". Berkeley can and should be
interested as a community in lear-
ning about, contacting and suppor-
ting the people fighting for jus-
tice in Chile, Cuba, Angola, Sou-
thern Africa and other struggling
communities of the world.

Berkeley already is an "inter-
national city" in a horrible sense.
We have semi-official relations

with a sister city in Japan; to
which delegations travel back and
forth annually. The hypocris of
this Berkeley ‘international sm'
towards Japan is that the atomic
bombs used to destroy Hiroshima and
Nagasaki were developed in Berkeley
by the University of California.
our own city charter proudly pro-
claims Berkeley the "birthplace of
the atomic age", a birth which
claimed thousands of Japanese lives.

To become true citizens of the
world would mean an urgent commit-
ment to prevent the use of nuclear
weapons, processed by a university
whose headquarters are here, against
the people of Indochina. It would
mean campaigning to stop the Ini-
versity sponsored military machine,
confronting the war criminals with
their Pentagon connections who work
here behind the cloak of academic
respectability. It would mean op=
posing the conscription of Berkeley‘
young men to fight in Asia. It
would mean whenever possible, to re-
sist the encroaching war machine
that dominates our country. The
peace initiative is a major step
towards that end.
