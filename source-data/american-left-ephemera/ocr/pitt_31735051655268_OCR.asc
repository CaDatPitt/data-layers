which had been brought about where the problem
would be taken up in open discussion, but the Halonen
controlled leadership refused to call the meeting. As
a result of this illegal policy of rule or ruin the Brook-
ston store is facing the same fate that all the stores
under the thumb of this social fascist clique will exper-
ience sooner or later.

In the co-operatives which this leadership controls,
a policy has been instituted through which every prole-
tarian who recognizes the class struggle has been driven
to a point where he has no other recourse than to
withdraw support. The stores that they have not been
able to wrest from the workers and farmers to carry
on their social fascist policy have been compelled to
discontinue their support of the Central organization.

SOCIAL FASCISM IN PRACTICE

For the consideration of every proletarian co—operator,
we set forth the following reasons for this situation:

To carry out this policy of disruption of the workers
and farmers struggles it has been necessary for this
leadership to use every method at its disposal, even
to the extent of establishing new counter-revolutionary
organizations. Within the Exchange itself, there has
been established a secret apparatus under the leader-
ship of Halonen and his accomplices, with the purpose of

penetrating even into the political movement of the

workers. This organization is composed of reliable
followers of these renegades from the class struggle,
through which machine meetings in the various localities
are organized. It also has a wider political purpose as
is exemplified by the letters that they send out. For
instance in one of these letters they urge these disruptors
that belong to this secret circle, to circulate a book
under the title of “Political Bankruptcy of the Com-
intern”, written by known renegades from the class
struggle.

They have aligned our central organization with the

9

leadership of the Co—operative League of the U. S. A.
into which in the course of the betrayal of the workers
and farmers in the Co—operative Movement, the blackest
reactionaries of the Labor Movement have entrenched
themselves, against whom the constituency of the Co-
operative Central Exchange has fought for years.
Through this alliance with Warbasse and his machine,
they have caused the Co—operative Central Exchange to
become a supporter of the International Social Fascist
leadership which today is negotiating to make of the
I. C. A. a part of the Imperialist League of Nations of
which the basic task is to make war on the Soviet Union.

They have aligned the Co—operative Central Exchange
organization to help the social fascist leadership of the
American Federation of Labor in shifting the burden
of the economic crisis arising from the capitalist system
itself, onto the shoulders of the workers and farmers.
In this their role has been indentical with the A. F. of L.

Charity paid for by the Workers themselves even
going so far as to withhold a day’s pay each month
from the employes for up—keep of «a soup kitchen
sponsored by the A. F. of L. leaders in Superior has
been their policy. ‘They have fought in every way all
real organization for the purpose of struggle for relief
to be paid ’ for by the exploiters, for the unemployed
workers. In this fight they have not only used their
own apparatus and the help of the A. F. of L. but
they have utilized the most reactionary newspaper of
the capitalist class in Superior, the “Evening Telegram”
for this purpose, as their mouthpiece.

In February during the unemployed demonstrations
where thousands of hungry unemployed workers came
out onto the streets to demand immediate relief from
the City of Superior and social insurance from the
national government, a part of the personnel of the Co-
operative Central Exchange was there to ridicule these
demonstrators and the speakers that spoke for the un-
employed workers.

This leadership directs and conducts an insidious

10

I

campaign of lies and slander at the expense of the con-
stituency, through numerous agents among the member-
ship of the local co—operatives against the workers and
farmers class interests and their organizations. They
mobilize all the petty bourgeoisie forces in every com-
munity against the communists in particular and the
class struggle in general. Weeks before the annual meet-
ings of the local co—operatives, agents are sent to prepare
the membership against any progressive measures and
especially against the element that recognizes the class
struggle as the basis for the Co—operative movement.
As a result of this procedure we have today many ex-
amples where the membership has been agitated to vote
directly against its own class interest. .

In the Cherry Farmers Co—operative, the association
in its annual meeting voted down the sending of dele-
gates to a conference of unemployed which was held in
Chisholm, Minnesota; these workers and farmers were
misled to do this by an intense campaign of lies and
insinuations against the unemployed organizations and
unemployed workers which was conducted under the
direction of the leadership of the Co—operative Central
Exchange.

In other places these organizers have gone to the
limit in this social fascist organization and machination.
We have instances where the Board of Directors have
been turned against the majority of the membership
by tricks of their agents on the Boards. They have
gained a majority by deception and trickery after which

transfers of stock and expulsion of left-wing members"

has taken place, thus insuring the policy of the Haloneh
renegades from the class struggle in these stores.

They have instituted a policy of driving into bank-
ruptcy through the aid of capitalist legal action those
left wing stores that have not accepted their disruptive
methods.

They have continuously and systematically opposed
and fought the organization of the unorganized workers,
while they sponsor summer camps for themselves into

11

which huge amounts of the workers’ and farmers’ money
through the co—operatives is squandered.

They have opposed the Trade Union Unity League,
the only trade union organization in the country that is
seriously carrying on organizational work among both
employed and unemployed workers.

, They have organized a counter organization to the
Women’s Section among the Finnish people, the sole
purpose of which is to fight the class conscious Finnish
women of the country.

They have built a Youth organization into the appar-
atus of the Co—operative Central Exchange which is
based on the illusion of pure co—operative principles,
the object of which can be nothing else than the counter-
action of the development of the youth into capable

\ fighters for the class interest of the workers and farm-

ers. The purpose of this organization is no other than
to fight the Young Communist League and other organ-
izations which are today organizing the youth on a
class struggle basis.

They are putting out an anti-workingclass Finnish
newspaper at the expense of the constituency, which
has and can have no other object than that of fighting
against the workingclass, to confuse the class struggle, to
make the workers and farmers in the co—operative move-
ment impotent in the face of the deepening crisis.

They have and are spending large sums of the money
of the constituency by spreading leaflets such as the one
entitled “What It’s All About”, that are based on lies
and of which the object is to conceal their betrayal of
the workers and farmers in the Co—operative Movement
and mislead their struggles into harmless channels for
the capitalist class.

THE PROGRAM OF “UNITY OF ALL GROUPS”

All of this is done under the misleading slogan of
“Unity” for the sake of unity itself, which is an out-
growth of the policy of “neutrality” which Warbasse has

12

attempted to foist on the workers and farmers co-op-
erative movement for many years but has previously
failed because of the resistance of the class conscious
element in the Co—operative Movement. In the name
of this false unity, the leadership of the Co—operative
Central Exchange has split many of the local co-op-
eratives. The policy of unity for the sake of unity has
resulted in a situation where the stores are divided into
two camps. On the one hand the supporters of the
Halonen policy to which has been recruited all the known
enemies of the workingclass, and on the other, the
element that has been" driven out, which composed the
real economic and idealogical support for the local enter-
prises.

In their effort to terrorize with the red menace the
membership of the co-operatives, they have resorted
to open fascist acts and are today playing the role of
agent provocateurs for the infamous Fish Committee.
This leadership has spread lies in the same manner as
all capitalism does about the workers’ movements being
financed from Moscow.

As a direct result of their policy, open fascism in
physical forms has appeared in numerous cases which
is supported by the leadership of the Exchange, where
property of workers’ organizations has been broken up.
The followers of this clique in the leadership of the
Co—operative Central Exchange have through physical
means and with the help of local shyster government
officials attempted outright robbery of the Finnish Work-
ers’ Clubs of their property.

FASCIST POLICY OF WRECKING THE CO-
OPERATIVES ECONOMICALLY

They have conived with the blackest reactionaries
to make it impossible for the workers and farmers to
protect their interests in bankruptcy proceedings which
they themselves have brought about through legal pres-
sure on the left-wing stores as for instance in New

13

York Mills, where through the aid of the representative
of the Co—operative Central Exchange, a trustee who
received a minority of votes in the creditors’ meeting
was oppointed by the court. ’

In their eagerness to help the capitalist class get
rid of its goods at a high price at the expense of the
workers and farmers, this leadership has dumped large
stocks of merchandise into some of the stores in the
course of the last year to the extent that it endangers
their very existence. This has been done at a time
when prices must decline as a consequence of the econ-
omic crisis. This has resulted from the fact that this
leadership has never recognized the crisis because it was
foretold by the Communists. Instead, they have in every
instance indirectly supported the Hoover illusion of
prosperity coming back.

They have made of the accounting department of the
Co—operative Central Exchange an instrument through
which political espionage is carried on for the leadership
while at the same time exorbitant salaries are paid to the
irresponsible personnel. '

They have completely ignored the need of the farm-
ing population in the face of the deep—going crisis in
agriculture.

They pay exorbitant salaries to the administrative
personnel which is paid for through high prices of
commodities by the constituency.

All of these things have a direct bearing on the
situation as it is today in the Exchange. While the
prices of commodities have declined generally in every
field and the sales have decreased in our Central organ-
ization, the gross profit and operating expenses increase
at a rapid rate. This brings on the situation which we

_have: that the membership is leaving the co-operatives

because of exorbitant prices where the Halonen policy
prevails.

14

IN STIGATION OF LEGAL ACTION TO WRECK
CO-OPERAT IVES

As a result of the policy, the local organizations have
been drawn into capitalist law courts as houses divided
among themselves which inexorably must result in
losses to no one else but the local organizations.

In many local co—operatives this social fascist leader-
ship has become a spy system for the employer through
which scores of workers have been blacklisted and
thrown out of the industries on the basis of being reds.

Fellow delegates to the annual meeting of the Co-
operative Central Exchange, members of the Co-oper-
ative movement:

We, the delegation representing the workingclass on

the basis of the class struggle in the co-operative move-
ment appeal to your sound judgement, your praiseworthy

traditions of the past years. The Co-operative, Central _

Exchange is an organization that has been built through
our class unity, to serve the workingclass in its struggle
for emancipation. On this question everyone of us will
agree. In the past year and a half however, this pur-
pose has been trampled into the dust by the present
leadership.

The question arises, shall we let these Wreckers of
our movement accomplish their task of tearing asunder
the organizations that we ourselves have built, through
this policy of social fascism? In short, are we going
to let the Warbasses, the Alannes, the Halonens and
their accomplices destroy our class unity and with it
our co-operative movement? This policy foisted upon
the workers and farmers co-operative movement by the
leadership can only result in destruction. If the policy
persists it mustinexorably be followed on the one hand
by disintegration and on the other by the co—operatives
becoming more and more a part of the capitalist system.
Both of these are trends that are absolutely contrary
to the principles of workers’ co-operation. This policy
if allowed to prevail by the membership will on the one

15

hand divorce the movement completely from the strug-
gles of the workers and farmers of which the co—opera-
tive movement is a part, thus dissociating it from the
basic support idealogically as well as economically. On
the other hand, the trend of becoming a pure business
institution, toward which our central organization is
going with ever increasing speed is no less dangerous,
resulting in the end in the. same thing.

In the deepening economic crisis of the whole cap-
italist system of which the result is a sharpening of the
class struggle between the exploiting class and the work-
ing class, this leadership has completely exposed itself.
It has today become an instrument in the hands of the
exploiter with which the workers and farmers are de-
ceived ‘to fight against their own class interests. This
policy is based on the illusion of co—operative socialism
as interpreted by modern reformists, on the illusion that
through co-operative activity, the system of capitalism
can be overcome while at the same time repudiating the
class struggle, which in this period of economic crisis
can result in nothing but the defense of the exploiting
class.

We, who represent the workers and farmers class
interest in the co-operative movement emphatically re-
pudiate this kind of a policy. We declare to all co-
operators that only co-operation that is based on the
class struggle for the class interest of the workers and
farmers means unity. All other programs foisted on the
co—operative movement are instruments of betrayal of
the worker and farmer constituency and will result in
this period of crisis in disintegration of the movement
and a consequent strengthening of the position of the
exploiting class in its exploitation of the worker and
farmer masses of the country.

~This policy of the leadership of the Co-operative
Central Exchange is not only social fascism, it must lead
deeper and deeper into open fascism to which the organ-
ization is sinking. ‘

Fellow co—operators, we must demand a complete

16

change of policy in order that we may again unify
our forces which have been torn asunder by this lead—
ership.

We who represent the class interests of the worker
and farmer masses declare to all co-operators that unity
is possible if it is based on the class struggle. That
even those organizations that have been driven out of the
Exchange, will support and build it as before if the anti-
workingclass policy is repudiated and the organization is
conducted according to the policy of the Co-operative
Central Exchange previous to the betrayal by the lead-
ership.

The aim and intent from its inception of the Co-
operative Central Exchange has been the aiding of the
class struggle and from this the leadership has departed.
This, we representatives of the class interest of the
whole membership emphatically condemn and submit the
following conditions on the basis of which unity in our
movement can be again re—established.

We demand that the annual meeting of the Co-
operative Central Exchange will be conducted on a
democratic basis where equal consideration must be
given to every delegate on these principal questions.
We condemn the method used in the last annual meeting

as undemocratic and against the best interests of the ‘

co-operative movement as a whole.

We demand that the records and minutes of the
meeting shall reflect the proceedings as they are brought
for consideration, that in no case shall they be recorded
with partiality as was the case in the last annual meeting.

In View of the fact that the element which we repre-
sent entails the majority of members and supporters of

" the co-operative movement, we demand that elected min-

ority delegations from those co-operatives that have been
driven into a split situation as a ‘result of the policy of
the leadership, be seated at the meeting with consultive
rights of voice but no vote on all questions.

We demand that every delegate be given the right to
present from the floor resolutions and motions of ,what—

I

17

ever nature they wish; that these motions and resolutions
be thereafter discussed and voted upon according to ac-
cepted parliamentary procedure.

As a prerequisite to solving the problem with which
we are faced in the annual meeting of the Co—operative
Central Exchange and in order to re—establish unity of
the organization we present the following order of main
points to be incorporated on the agenda.

1. A thorough discussion of the principles of cooper-
ation on the class struggle basis about which resolutions
can be submitted to be voted upon.

2. Discussion on the commercial aspect of the cooper-
ative movement as subordinated to the question of
principle.

3. Election of officials, committees and boards for
the coming year.

CONDITIONS UNDER‘ WHICH CO-OPERATION
CAN DEVELOP IN THIS PERIOD

To establish the unity in the ranks of the co—operative
movement, we submit the following principles to be
applied at present and in the future as the basis for
building of our co-operatives and the co—operative
movement.

The co—operative movement is a part of the class
struggle for emancipation of the workers and farmers
from the thraldom of capitalism in capitalist society.
Its aims and ideals are the same as the aims and
ideals of the whole workingclass. It is a movement
arising from the class struggle in capitalist society,
from the condition of oppression of the workingclass.
Therefore, it is a class movement basically to serve
the class interest of those that compose its member-
ship.

Co-operation among workers and farmers to, serve
their class interest, to insure its economic development,
to render it capable of facing the economic competition
of individually owned and chain enterprises, must be

18

based on the principle of class struggle. Any other
interpretation given to it is false and eventually results
in the deception of the worker and farmer masses.
Workers’ Co-operation must always have as its highest
purpose only the class interests of the workers and
farmers, it shall’ not compromise with any movement
on this question. This shall apply in everyday activity
as well as in the general struggle of the workingclass.

The purpose of workers’ ‘co—operation is to unite
on the basis of the class struggle all worker and farmer
co-operators as well as workers and farmers co-oper-
ative institutions and enterprises to aid in the general
workingclass struggle for emancipation. Its aim must
be in the present society the abolition of capitalism and
the capitalist system and establishment of a workers
and farmers society. It must seek the alliance of all
workers and farmers organizations which participate
in the class struggle for the benefit of the whole
workingclass on the basis of their fitness and ability
to realize the immediate and final aims of the ‘workers
and farmers according to the above principles.

NEUTRALITY CONTRARY TO BEST IN-
TEREST OF MEMBERSHIP

The proletarian co-operative movement therefore,
cannot be neutral with regard to the capitalist class
nor can it be neutral towards’ organizations of workers
of which the purpose is to mitigate the class struggle,
to confuse the class front of the workingclass nor
can it be neutral towards tendencies in the working-

class movements that have as their purpose the defeat '

and deception of the workers and farmers in the class
struggle, which inexorably must result in the aid and
strengthening of the class front of the exploiters.

It is this policy of aiding the capitalist class that
the Warbasse-Halonen and Alanne leadership has
foisted on the workers co-operative movement. It there-
fore‘ becomes just as important to fight these bourge-

19

oisie opportunist tendencies and the leadership that
foists them on the movement, as it is to struggle
against the capitalist class itself whose agents these
misleaders are.

The events of the past year and a half set forth in
the beginning of this program confirm fully this fact.
This leadership has brought about a situation through
its anti—workingclass social fascist policy in the co-
operative movement where it is threatened with des-
truction. Therefore we call upon the co-operators to
mobilize all their force to safeguard the interests of the
workers and farmers in the co-operative movement.

We call upon all the worker and farmer members of V

our Co—operative Central Exchange organization to
smash this social fascist clique in the leadership.

We declare ‘that the Warbasse-Halonen policy is a
policy of disruption for the benefit of the exploiter and
therefore urge all honest workingclass elements to
unite on the only basis that will insure unity of our

movement; that will render it capable of fighting in p

the deepening economic crisis where the class struggle
inevitably must sharpen. '

Unite on the "basis of the class struggle” against
the exploiter as well as all their agents, the W arbasses,
Halonens, Alannes and their accomplices!

Unite on the basis of the class struggle with the
whole working class to fight against the worsening
conditions and the starvation which is facing our mem—
bership as well as all workers.

It is only on this basis that the movement can be
saved from the destruction that has been prepared for
it by the capitalist class and carried into effect by its
agents now in the leadership of our Co—operative
Central Exchange.

The Platform of the Class Struggle
for the Co-op. Central Exchange

In order to preserve the unity of the Co—operative
Central Exchange and bring it back to serve the class
interests of the workers and farmers, what it originally
was intended for, we here present our demands and
conditions ‘on the basis of which real unity can be again
re—established.

1. It has been shown clearly in the past year that
the policy of the Co—operative Central Exchange lead-
ership has been inconsistent with the basic principles
of workers’ and farmers’ co-operation. Therefore we
demand the complete change of policy in the Co—oper-
ative Central Exchange.

2. In order to accomplish this it is necessary that
the whole leadership be changed. Therefore we pro»-
pose to the annual meeting that all of the members of
the Board of Directors shall be recalled by the annual
meeting and workers and farmers from the rank and
file membership, who support co-operation on the basis
of the class struggle, be elected in their places.

3. Knowing also that as the ringleaders of this
disruption policy there is a small group of high salaried
employees who have turned their backs to the workers
and farmers. We therefore demand the immediate
expulsion from the employ of the Co—operative Central
Exchange George Halonen, Henry Koski, Eskel Ronn,
and others who have made themselves enemies of the
workingclass.

4:. We declare that the last annual meeting of the
Co—operative Central Exchange was void of all dem-

21

ocratic character even to the extent that the minutes
do not reflect the truth but were doctored to serve
the purpose of the leadership. Therefore we demand
that the meeting must be conducted on the basis of
genuine workers’ democracy and that every resolution
and motion must be given consideration when presented
from the floor.

5. As an instrument with which to force a split
in every local member co—operative and drive out of
these organizations their original builders, this leader—
ship has established a Finnish language newspaper, the
“Tyovaen Osuustoimintalehti”, which has only one
purpose and that is to fight all real attempts at organ-
ization of the workers. Therefore we demand that this
publication be immediately discontinued and that the
Tyomies be again adopted as the official publication
of the Co-operative Central Exchange.

6. Although the biggest portion of the sales of
the Co-operative Central Exchange is in the rural
communities, the leadership has done nothing to en-
hance the position of the farming population in the
marketing of their products which we believe should
be a part of the activity of the organization and which
has been brought before annual meetings repeatedly by
the farmers. Therefore we demand that the Co-operative
Central Exchange immediately begins investigation of
what farm products it can market and that marketing
of farm products will be made one branch of activity.

7. The Co-operative ‘Movement is a part of the
Class Struggle, it therefore has duties to perform in
the general struggle of the workingclass. One of its
basic tasks is to seek the alliance of all workers’ and
farmers’ organizations that are intended to benefit the
whole workingclass, on the basis of their fitness and
ability to realize the immediate and final aim of the
workers and farmers in their struggle for emancip-
ation.

i 22

The most important task of the workingclass today
is the organization of its own ranks for the class
struggle.

It being a known fact that the only organization
in the trade union field that is seriously carrying on
organization work for the organization of the workers
into industrial unions as well as carrying on organiza-
tion among the unemployed is the Trade Union Unity
League. V

In order to establish a close solidarity with the
revolutionary union movement the meeting urges every
member of the co-operatives who is eligible, to join
the Trade Union Unity League unions in their res-
pective trades. Further to demonstrate our solidarity

towards the struggles of the exploited‘ and starving‘

workingclass of the country, we demand that the Co-
operative Central Exchange annual meeting shall con-
tribute from the last year’s profits five hundred dollars
to the Trade Union Unity League for the organization
of the unorganized workers.

8. Knowing fully the acuteness of the unemployed
situation, we therefore demand that a program be
adopted whereby the local co—operatives and Co-operative
Central , Exchange should give relief in the form of
goods to the Trade iUnion Unity League Unemployed
Councils to the extent of their ability for distribution to
the unemployed Workers, and further that the co—oper-
ative institutions and enterprises give all possible assist-
ance to the political struggle of the unemployed workers
for SOCIAL INSURANCE, and immediate relief from
government institutions.

9. Recognizing the fact that the economic crisis
has brought about a situationwhere our membership in
many instances is in acute need, many being compelled
to go without even the most elemental necessities of life,
and many actually starving because of the lack of em-
ployment in the industries and the low prices of farm
products , we demand that to help our member-

23

ship during this crucial situation, the Co—operative
Central Exchange must immediately begin developing a
program of credit for the‘ worker and farmer members
who are in need of assistance. That the program be
arranged in such a way that the local Boards of Di-
rectors arrange collective guarantees from among the
membership to secure credit for those that are in need,
from the co—operatives.

10. The program of the leadership of the Co—oper-
ative Central Exchange has been to refrain from all
price competition with the individually owned enterprises,
thus they havebeen in league with the capitalist class

V in keeping up prices of commodities for the consumer.

It is known that through the efforts of the’American
bourgeoisie the general commodity prices have been kept
up thirty percent above the world market. Thus the
Co—operative Central Exchange, under the present
leadership, has been a part of this program of the
Chambers of Commerce by refraining from competition
and price wars with the bourgeoisie class even in cases
where it would have been economically possible. There-
fore we condemn the policy of the leadership of the
Co—operative Central Exchange on this question.

11. It has been proven with many examples that the
prices of commodities have been higher in the Co—oper-
ative Central Exchange than in individually owned
wholesales which is partly accountable to the fact that
the administrative expense is high because of the high
salaries of the employees and the large number of
them that is necessary to keep up the fight against the
workingclass and the workingclass organizations. There-
fore we demand that all of the unnecessary employees
used for the above mentioned purpose be discharged
and that the annual meeting decides that no employee
of the Co—operative Central Exchange shall receive more
than forty dollars per week as salary.

12. The leadership of the Co—operative Central Ex-
change has organized and is today organizing Wornen’s

24

Guilds and Youth organizations of which the sole
purpose is the building of support for the betraying
leadership and to fight against all real class struggle
organization of women and youth. Therefore we demand
that all of these organizations that are foreign to the
purpose of the workingclass co—operative movement be
repudiated by the annual meeting, and that no support
be given hereafter to the anti—workingclass activity of
the Co—operative Central Exchange leadership.

13. The eyes of the international workingclass now
suffering from deepest misery and privation are on the
glorious success of the five year plan of the Soviet
Union. The workers and peasants of the Soviet Union
through planned Socialist production have succeeded in
eliminating unemployment and constantly improving the
standard of living of the working masses, which stands
as an inspiration to the entire workingclass.

They have built the most powerful co—operative
movement in the world with forty million members and
such a variety of activity that no other co—operative
movement can compare.

The international imperialists are armed to the teeth
and are conducting a vicious campaign of slander in
an attempt to promote war hysteria against the only
workers’ government.

We condemn the leadership of the Co—operative
Central Exchange which has conducted through its press,
the “Tyovaen Osuustoimintalehti”, an identical policy
with the imperialists of war against the Soviet Union,
in keeping with the program of the leadership of the
International Co—operative Alliance.

It is the duty of the co—operative movement in solid-
arity with the international proletariat to stand by and
be ready to defend the Soviet Union against the com-
mon enemy of the workingclass, the international bank-
ers and bosses.

14. American capitalism confronted with the mil-
itant movement of the workingclass that refuses to

25

starve, is instituting a system of terror in the form of
-beatings, jailing and deporting of revolutionary workers.

The plan of the Fish Committee is the capitalist
program of attack against the workingclass to make the
workers pay for the economic crisis, as a result of it
already a system of raiding of offices, a11d wholesale
arrests are being conducted by the Federal authorities.

We condemn the attitude of the Co—operative Central
Exchange leadership in their attack on the militant class
struggle organizations thereby giving aid and support to
the program of the Fish Committee.

The Co—operative Movement is composed of a great
number of foreign born wokers, therefore it becomes
the duty of the co—operative organizations to join with
the militant class struggle organization to fight against
the growing fascism of the government and for pro-
tection of the foreign born workers.

On the basis of these demands and conditions, and
that the Co-operative Central Exchange with its member
stores adheres to the revolutionary class struggle pro-
gram, that every member and functionary who has been
expelled from the organizations becauseof his devotion
to the workingclass be reinstated, we are ready to unite
for the building of a strong United Proletaricm Co—op-
erative Movement.

Statement of the W. & F. C. U. A.
Executive Board June 4th, 1931

TO ALL ‘PROLETARIAN CO-OPERATIVES
AND CO—OPERATORS:

In viewing the present situation in the co—operative
movement generally, the Executive Board of the Work-
ers’ and Farmers’ Co—operative Unity Alliance notes a
more open betrayal of the workingclass by the social-
fascist leadership of the Co—operative Central Exchange.

That which was pointed out_ in the class struggle
program of the \/Vorkers’ and Farmers’ Co—operative
Unity Alliance at the time of the Co—operative Central
Exchange annual meeting is now more fully confirmed
than ever before-

We reiterate again that the policy of Halonen and
his accomplices is not only a method by which the class
struggle is disrupted favorably to the exploiter, but
it is a policy of destroying the workers’ and farmers’

, Co—operative movement as an instrument of the class

struggle.

The expulsion of the Tyornies Society, in number
of members and unquestionably from a class struggle
point of view, the most important organization affiliated
to the Exchange; the refusal to seat legally elected
delegates from the Mass and Marengo Stores; the
utilization of the capitalist press; the use of police
and courts; the continued and systematic fight against
real relief for the unemployed and starving workers;
the systematic resistance in alliance with the Farmer-
Labor Party, the I.W.W., the A.F. of L., the Lovestones,

and the United Farmers’ League are but a part of the
social—fascist service they render to the exploiter of the
workers and farmers.

Their direct attacks through the “Osuustoimintalehti”
and through the numerous agents employed to move
around the country to villify and slander the Communist
International, theiSoviet Union and all workers’ organ-
izations that fight for the class interests of the workers
and farmers has created a situation in the co--operative
movement whereby "the best element, those that have
been the builders of the Co—operative Central Exchange
have been driven out.

The recent appointment of H. V. Nurmi, a man
known to have always supported the Warbasse—Alanne
policy of “neutrality”, as manager, the more open
alliance with the bourgeoisie on the one hand, and the
economic decline of the Co—operative Central Exchange
organization on the other, shows to the whole working-
class what is really happening in the Exchange organiza-
tion. From this policy of the leadership of the Co-
operative Central Exchange is resulting disintegration
of the whole movement; a division of the ranks of the
co-operators in every locality, because the workers and
farmers will not and cannot accept this leadership
that fights against their class interests.

While the Executive Board notes that large masses
of the proletarian co-operators have come to realize
the anti-workingclass character of the Warbasse-
Halonen policy of “unity of all groups” on the basis
of “neutrality”, there are still large numbers of co—oper-
ative masses being betrayed by this leadership.

With the above facts in mind, the Executive Board
of the Workers’ and Farmers’ Co—operative Unity Al-
liance further emphasizes that the only unity attainable
in this period of imperialism and the deepening of the
economic crisis is UNITY ON THE BASIS OF THE
PROLETARIAN CLASS STRUGGLE IN THE CO-
OPERATIVE MOVEMENT. All other programs
foisted on the workingclass co—operatives are but means

of betrayal of the workers’ and farmers’ co-operative
movement and playing into the hands of the capitalist
exploiters.

On the basis of the above situation the Executive
Board appeals to all workingclass co-operators through-
out the country to further intensify their activity in
exposing among the rank and file this betraying social-
fascist leadership.

To the attempts at expulsion from those co-operatives
that they still control and use for their anti-workingclass
machination, we must answer with more determined
exposure. Every member store and co-operative affiliated
to the Exchange is a part of the accomplishment of the
workingclass, a part of our work, we who have built
them.

Instead of withdrawing our struggle on provocation
of these social—fascist betrayers we must and will fight
to the last for the masses that are being fooled in the
local societies as well as the Co—operative Central Ex-
change itself.

In order to consolidate the ranks of the workingclass
in the co-operative movement for the program of the
CLASS STRUGGLE in the co—operatives, the Execut-
ive Board of the Workers’ and Farmers’ Co—operative
Unity Alliance in its last meeting on June 4th, took
an additional step organizationally and in accordance
with the decision of the April 16th conference. It was
definitely decided to establish a central apparatus in-
corporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin
to take care of all aspects of co-operative activity
including the supply of commodities to those co-operators
and co—operatives which have been driven out of the
Co—operative Central Exchange organization as a result
of the Halonen social—fascist policy.

The Workers’ and Farmers’ Co-operative Unity Al-
liance Executive Board with the above explanation of
the situation at the present time, submits its action for
the candid consideration of every workingclass co-oper-
ator and the whole workingclass.

29

While we consolidate our forces we must expose the
betrayers of the co—operative movement and the class
struggle. We must rally around the proletarian co—oper-
ative center, the Workers’ and Farmers’ Co-operative
Unity Alliance.

We must make of the co—operatives instruments in
the class struggle serving only the class interests of the
workers and poor farmers. The only unity possible
of accomplishment in the co—operative movement of
the workers and farmers is unity based on the PROL~
ETARIAN CLASS STRUGGLE. That is what the
Workers’ and Farmers’ Co-operative Unity Alliance
stands for. All Cooperatives join it!

PREFACE

These two documents were presented by the Left
Wing Co-operators to the membership of the Co-opera-
tive Central Exchange during its annual Convention in
April, 1931. The documents contain the general program
and demands of those co-operators who want to preserve
the co-operative movement in the Northwest as a move-
ment of revolutionary workers and toiling farmers, and
as a movement based on the revolutionary class struggle
against the capitalist class and capitalism. -_.__-  ---..-_
_.._This program also includes the only conditions upon
which the revolutionary Left Wing is ready to unite
with the entire membership of the Co—operative Central
Exchange, the part of it which is temporarily misled
by Halonen <3’ Co.

Altho the Left Wing represents the actual majority
of the active membership of the C o—operative Central
Exchange, Halonen was able, by using expulsions,
manipulation with shares of stock, aided by the capitalist
officials, etc. in the election of the delegates in the local
co-operatives, to get a mechanical majority to the Annual
Convention and consequently, the program and demands
of the Left Wing were defeated at the meeting.

But, in spite of this, the class struggle program
herein presented has not been defeated and cannot be
defeated. It has already rallied around itself thousands
of workers and farmers in the co-operative movement
and it continues to penetrate the minds of large and more
numerous workingclass co-operators, who have hitherto
been influenced by the Halonenite leadership.

The deepening of the economic crisis of American
capitalism is resulting in ever-growing unemployment,
lowering of the wages, worsening of the conditions of the

4

workers; pauperization of the toiling farmers, and gener-
ally depressing the buying power of the working masses.
These conditions are bound to radicalize the masses of
workers and the poor farmers. We must do our utmost

to draw them closer to us, by exposing Halonen and the _

other betrayers of the working class; by making them
thoroughly familiar with our class struggle program in the
co-operative field, and at the same time getting the co-

operators to participate in all general struggles of the work-_

ers and poor farmers under the leadershipof the Com-
munist Party, which has rendered us such valuable guid-
ance in our struggle against Halonen and other betray-
ers of the interests of the workers and poor farmers in
the Co-operative movement.

Every class conscious co—operator is duty—bound to
aid in giving a wide circulation to this CLASS
STRUGGLE PROGRAM and thereby helping to win
over the masses, away from the betrayers and for the
revolutionary class struggle.

The Program of Class Struggle
Co-operation

‘HE course of events has fully confirmed the cor-

rectness of our previous analysis with regard to the
development of the disintegration resulting from the
betrayal of the workingclass by the Halonen-Alanne rene-
gades from the class struggle in the co-operative move-
ment.

In our resolution published last year (1930), it was
pointed out that only co-operation that assists and is a
part of the class struggle of the workers and farmers

can grow and develop in this period of deepening‘

economic crisis. All other criterions for the Cooperative
Movement that are thrust upon the workers and farmers
are false and designed in this period to serve the ex-
ploiting class. '

While the economic crisis is ever deepening, of
which the result is measured in additional misery and
starvation for the workingclass throughout the country,
compelling the workers and farmers into actual struggle
against these conditions, the leadership of the Co—opera-
tive Central Exchange has established a policy which
is every day resulting in further dissociation of our
Central organization from these struggles. In the beg-
inning of the betrayal of the interests of the working-
class by this leadership, they used such methods that
concealed their intentions. Today however, as a result
of the sharpening of the class struggle, their. policy has
been completely exposed.

It has been stated on our part from the beginning
that the policy established by the leadership was contrary
to the tried principle of the past in the Co-operative
Central Exchange and that it was a policy from which

6

inexorably must result disintegration, that the objective
could be nothing else but the driving away from the co-ope-
rative movement those elements which have been its build-
ers and upon whom even today depends the successful
development of the co—operative movement. In the beg-
inning of the fight against the class interest of the
workers and farmers, this leadership concealed its identity
with radical phrases in order to deceive the membership.
Today, however, they no more can conceal themselves;
the logic of the class struggle has driven them into the
open so that at the present time it is a matter of common
knowledge among the majority of the supporters of the
co—operative movement that the policy of Halonen and
his accomplices is not only a program with which the
class struggle is disrupted favorably to the exploiter,
but that it is a policy of destroying the Workers and
Farmers C 0-operative Movement.

DESTRUCTIVE POLICY OF C. C. E.
LEADERSHIP

For the candid consideration of every delegate and
every ‘member of the co-operative movement, we cite
the following to prove our contentions: We have stated
before and we reiterate again, that the idealogical bank—
ruptcy of the leadership of the Co—operative Central
Exchange must inexorably be followed with economic
decline of the organization itself. The course of events
has fully confirmed this contention. Not only do we
see today open struggle against the workingclass by the
leadership with the white guard and bourgeoisie elements,
but We see rapid economic decline on the one hand, and
an accellerated process of shifting the institution onto
a basis of pure business on the other. I

From the moment that the leadership of the Co—op-
erative Central Exchange adopted the anti—workingclass
policy, from that moment the seeds of decomposition
were sown. Today we have the figures which speak
for themselves. In spite of the fact that the variety of

7

commodities distributed has been increased by addition
of new lines in the past year, we find that the sales
compared to the same months of the previous year, for
the past months have decreased. In addition to this, there
is resulting from the top heavy administration apparatus
an alarming trend of increase of operating expense and
gross profit. This renders the organization incapable
of competition with even the meanest of private enter-
prises economically, consequently endangering its very
existence. Thus we have a process of divorcement of
Central organization taking place from all potential
sources of support, a dissolution from the workers and
farmers struggles for which the co—operative movement
is a means to an end on the one hand, and the growing
impotence of the organization itself on the other as an
institution of service to the workers.

As a result of the anti—workingclass policy of the
leaders of the Co—operative Central Exchange, a disin-
tegration process is also taking place in the local societies,
which, if allowed to persist by the membership of the
co—operatives, will inevitably destroy the local organ-
izations. We can cite numerous examples where the
conduct of the stores in which the Halonenist leader-
ship is in control are on the verge of insolvency as
a result of the anti—Workingclass policy in which they
persist. ,

In Brookston, Minnesota, we have a good example
where the real supporters were driven out with the aid
of lackeys of the Central Exchange leaders, who were
recruited to the annual meeting to vote down the pro-
gram of the farmers. In Brookston the farmers that were
driven out were the basic supporters of the store, the
real economic foundation. These farmers having no
other recourse, held a meeting and decided that they
will not give a penny for anti—workingclass activity, the
result being that the sales of the local co—operative
dropped from between four and five thousand dollars
per month, to less than two thousand. Thereafter, they
petitioned a special meeting to redress the situation
