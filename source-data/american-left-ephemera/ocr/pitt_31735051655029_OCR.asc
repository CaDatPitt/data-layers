.. BILL Izmaonucsn FOR 5-DAY, 35-HOUR WEEK

UFWA Working for Saturday off Without_
Lengthened Day or Reducation in Pay

0 Federal employees’ chances of getting

a Beday, 35-hour week 7- at least during

the summer months - are taking definite

shape. Over 40,000, Government workers
have signed petitions circulated by UFWA
locals in support of the MeadrMcGormack
Bill, permitting the establishment of 5-

‘day working weeks for the whole year, or
~ any part of it, in federal-departments.

Introduced by Senator Mead of New'York,
.the bill provides.that the_President by
executive_ order ma establish the 5-day
week“ in agencies where no extra cost to
the taxpayer is involved. It would mean

' Saturdays; off without any.increase of

hours on the other five days or decrease

- in pay for workers on an hourly basis.

Studies‘ by -industrial psychologists
have shown that i roved morale and bet-

ter physical condi ion enable workers to

formerly did in six. In industry

The historians will discover ... that

that the great mass of American scholars

CIO WINS VICTORIES DESPITE HARD TIMES

When the story of.American labor dur-
ing The Great Depression is written, one
of its outstanding features will be the
success of the CIO not only in blocking
the lowering of working conditions that
usually occurs at such times,but in win-
ning notable victories over some of the
bitterest enemies of labor.

Foremost among these demonstrations of
the militant spirit and inherent power
of industrial unionism, as compared with
medieval craft "divisionism," will stand
the tdumphant outcome of the epic strike
of the Newspaper Guild against Hearst's
two Chicago newspapers. After 17 months
of heroic struggle,in which the violence
and corruption resorted to by the Hearst
machine were met by an inspiring wall of
labor solidarity from coast to coast,the

‘ management capitulated last month and

signed a contract with the union, reinvi
stating 115 of the strikers and giving a
."separation allowance" averaging $500
apiece, to
abolished by the merger of the two news»
papers.

This victory led immediately to anothp
er of even wider significance. On May
16 negotiations were started in New'York
looking to a blanket agreement with the
CIO union covering all the Hearst papers
in the country. This is the first time
that a publisher has sought a contract
‘for an entire chain of newspapers.

Another "first" was chalked up when

the Guild obtained from the Associated
Press the first union contract that that
powerful organization has ever consented
to sign covering its editorial staff.The
newspaper men ‘are showing other white;
how to do it. ‘Given the
wright structure and tactics. labor sol»
idarity is bound to win. ' w

UNION ACTION SAVES wosxnss $1,520,000

What can be done for government work~
ers by a vigorous local union backed by
nearly four million industrial workers
was clearly shown last month when the
pay of Veterans working at Veterans Ada
ministration facilities was in effect
raised $15 per month by the reduction of
compulsory QSL charges. This action was
the result of a long drive by the UFWA
to eliminate abuses connected with com-
pulsory deductions for "QSL" ~ quarters,
subsistence and laundry.

Veterans employed at various Adminis-
tration facilities are permitted to live
off the station, bt heretofore have had
to pay for three meals a day at $22.50
a month. By an order effective May 1,
the number of compulsory meals was re~
duced to one, at $7.50 a month. About
$1,620,000 annually Will thus be added
to the pay of these employees.

The UFWA drive in behalf of the Mead~
Sabath bill abolishing compulsory QSL is
credited with having decided Gen Hines,
the Veterans administrator, to issue the
order. The same union had already won
the 8~hour day for these workers.

Encouraged by this success, the UFWA
is working with redoubled determination
to obtain the same two concessions for
marine hospital employees, for whom it

‘has ,already won notable improvements in

working conditions.
WELCOME TO THE RECREATIONAL ASSOCIATION

Local 28 hails the formation of the LO
Recreational Association as a heartening
indication of the growth of an esprit de
cogps that can be traced to the revitel~
izing inf1uencecﬁ'the present librarian,
Any undertaking that tends to develop a
feeling of solidarity and a realizatiezi
of our common interests cannot fail to
be of benefit to the staff and to the
institution. Too long has the library
profession been cursed with the tradi~
tion of narrow individualismd. As fellow
enterprise, we have
everything to gain from coming together
on any sound basis. In union of every
sort there IS strength.

LC WAS PROMISES TOO

As July 1 approaches # the date when,
it is hoped, 130 added positions on the
LC staff will become available ~ there
is growing concern as to how thoroughly
the principle of promotions from within
will be followed in filling these posi-
tions. This principle has been heartily
endorsed by Mr. MacLeish in his confer-
ences with the union and is recognized
by all authorities on personnel manage-
ment as one of the indispensable bases
of a sound.personne1 policy.

Notwithstanding the Librarian's en»
dorsement of this method of filling var
cancies, however, there have been a num~
ber of disquieting indications that his

V enlightened attitude on this basic ques~

tion is not as yet shared by all hose
under him. We have in mind especially
one large division, where several posin
tions have been filled recently in utter
disregard of the right of those already
on the staff to be considered.‘ We sin~
cerely hope that Mr. MacLeish will take
the necessary precautions to ensure that
this shortsighted and unfair practice is
progressive
views on the matter are accepted as the
rule in LG employment policy.

In cases where there is no member of
the staff qualified for a position, or
who could be trained to it with a little
supervisory instruction, there can be no
objection to the job going to an outsids
er, but to bring in people from outside
and jump them over the heads of workers
entitled to promotion breeds discontent
and adds to the labor turnover. Many of
the deck attendants, for example, were
given to understand, in apology for the
inadequate salaries offered them, that
they could look forward to promotion but
many of them have become weary of waite
ing for the promise to be made good, and

.not a few of them have seen outsiders

put in above them or newcomers jumped
over their heads.

If handled in accord with the policy
of promotions from within, the 130 new
positions might well mean advancement
for more than that number of present eme
ployees through moving up all down the
line. This would serve as an incentive
in the lower ranks, where encouragement

‘ is most needed. '

UNION MEMBERS CUT COST OF LIFE INSURANCE

Important advantages in the purchase
of life» insurance have been secured for
members- of UFWA through the bargaining
power of the large membership of the un-
ion. With the assistance of experts, a
policy has been drawn up which Consumers
Union declares to be the best buy on the
market. There is no discrimination on
account of race or sex, and no nedic:xl
examination is required of applicants
under 45 for policies not over $3,000.

UFWA policies.are based on the princi-

-ple that it is best to buy only insur-

ance from an insurance company and to
keep ono's savings in a savings institur
tion. The increased cost of the savings
features of the usual policy is general-
ly a waste of money, since only the face
of the policy is paid at death. Had the
money been put in a savings bank, it
would have accumulated and been avail~
able for the benefit of the-survivors.
UFWA life insurance offers a choice of
two types of policy, "Natural Premium"
and "Dollar a Month." Under the former,
the cost, starting at $7.53 per $1,000
at 21 years of age, rises a few cents

_each year, at the same time as earning

power presumably increases. These rates
are far below those of the ordinary type
of policy. ‘

Dollar a Month policies provide $1,000
of insurance for each dollar up to 36
years of age, $750 up to 46 and $500 up
’to fifty~one. V

UFWA insurance is thoroughly protected
by government supervision and full legal
reserves. Fbr further information, see
