&uﬁmnw:i6$o£0ytws stoned, shot and tried to kill Afro~Americans in a day of
Bmv.mu$99 mob rule. Williams was told he would soon be hanging from

a tree. When he called for the'Goveruor's office for help,
the Governor's assistant answered, "Ain't you dead yet,

nigger?"
 G. .. _. .. An all-white grand jury met to draw up
me charges against those guilty of crime on

that infamous day. What was the charge? KIDNAP! Against
the rioting racists? No - against the Black victims!

The A .. _ .. A white couple who claimed to be lost in
tmusens the Black community that day, sought refuge
in Williams’ home. (Mae Mallory was visiting the Williams’
at the time.) They entered Williams home voluntarily and
left voluntarily two hours later, unharmed, despite great
racial tension that day. From this was developed the frame-
up charge of "kidnapping".

Robert Williams escaped the lynch mob by fleeing to Cuba. Mae Mallory fled to Ohio
from where we fought against her extradition for two and a half years. Julian May»
field.renowned novelist, made his way from Monroe to Ghana. From there he eloquently
wrote about Monroe. Richard Crowder, Harold Reape and John Lowry were jailed.

 Funerals are no doubt cheaper than court trials. But
  it surely is a great relief that we need not report

about graves dug by lynch mobs for these victims. The

extradition fight, the trial and the bails have run into huge sums of money.

An appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina is scheduled for the beginning of

November. To make this possible, money must be raised for legal fees and court costs
