  NLRB helps raiders  

e has appointed three members tothe 5-

Q

HOW the boss-controlled NLRB’ encourages raiding can
be seen by a recent decision wh\ich choppedup the workers
at the Potash Company of America property in Trona, Cali-

foruia.

;Mine'-Mill had organiizedlthe workers into a single, local,

union years ago. Under the banner of.Mine-Mill, great wag

and contract gains were made.

, Then came District 50 of the United Mine Workers and
signed a _“back door" agreement with the -company. This
opened the back door to a series of petitions by various AFL

craft unions——

——The AFL Electrical Workers demanded that the electricians

be put into their union.

-—The AFL Operating‘ Eiig'iiieei‘s demanded that powerhouse
»wg'l{ers be put into their union. ’
——'|‘he AFL Machinists asked that toolroom keepers be put .1

into their union.
"Mine-Mill argued before

the NLRB that the plant-wide

bargaining unit should remain~—as it ‘had been since the

property was organized.

The case went all the _way to the top National» Labor
Relations Board...in \Vashington. The Board ruled in favor of
cutting up the operation into a numbefr of units. ’

, ‘Board member Ivar Peterson dissented against this rul-
ing. He warned sha1‘Dl.V that the decision meant "a rald will
not be"-turned aside _by the Board no matter how compelling

the evidence ‘that the broader unit best fits the needs of . . .

._\

the employees.”

cases as a shovel-nose.sha_rk
would‘ be-v—in scooping blubber

1 fromv a helpless whale,” Senator
 Neely of W. Virginia told the

Senate.‘ , r , .
.Like Charles E. Wilson "of
General Motors a year earlier,
Beeson saw no reason to give
up his company ties just be-
cause he was taking a govern-
ment job. He tried to hide from
the Senate Labor Committee
these facts: that he was keep-
ing pension rights in Food Ma-
chinery Corp., and that he
planned to go backto the com-
pany after his Boa-rd term was
over. ’
Very Tough. "’

The workers in Food Machin-

, ery corporation’s 40 plants have

a union, the AFL Chemical‘
Workers. Marshall Schaffer, the
union secretary, says the com-
pany “is not only a very tough
employer but has exhibited very

"definite anti-union tendencies.”

Beeson is, of course, a strong
supporter of the Ta.t‘t-Hartley.
Act; he thinks it doesn't go/far
enough. His company, Fond Ma-
chinery Corp., had,Guy Farmer
as its (legal agent many times
before Partner‘ 'he:_-.ame NLRB
Chairman, and Farmer, and
Beeson are close p e rs o n a l
friends. _ '

As we go‘ to press, there’. is
a repogt that Beeson i.sresign—
ing", effective December 16. His
nomination’ ‘squeeked through

the Senate last winter by ;45 '

to 42. He doesn’t seem to want
to take a chanceon re,iection=

‘by a Democratic-controlled Sen-
‘ate in.Jagnua'ry. ’ -

PHILIP C. RODGERS got.hi's
training"as right-hand man to

ate Labor Coinmittee. He was
made chief of’ the (}.OP.staff
in that ‘committee in 1.947 and
stayed there till‘ the Republi-
cans sent him over to NLRB
iast year. " ’ "  _ s
As key aid to the father of‘.
Taft-Hartley, Rodgers‘ - pushed
to make T-H as tough as possi-
b,le—-on labor. He says T-H is
“a sound and ju-zt law." When
he was sworn in, li'-=v saitl “I-
propose tocarry out 1:313.-i law,-

not; as it once was, not as some ‘-7

   ,,::i_,s,|':_c_xg’.év,4—,—Noveniber 2,2..i954_ ,

 

‘may wish it to be, but as it is.”

This was taken to mean that
Rodgers will try to fire those
NLRB staffvmembers he thinks ,
are biased ~£<'n:~- unions. :

The Record

Since Fa_rmer, ' Beeson and ..

Rodgers took over, the_.Board
has issued a string of ‘rulings
which had these results:

OReversed Board policies
protecting workers and unipns
——some dating back as long as
18 years. 7 (-

OChanged U. S. labor law,
in effect, without; benefit of
Coiigress. .

0 Taken awaya long list of
rights ,from”wo.L:__kers, and hand-
ed over a large number of rights’
to employers.

ing of these rulingswill be told

tions he showed clearly his full,

During those negotiations,
Int’l. Rep. Jim Durkin objected
to Kamn1holz’s proposals aimed
at weakening seniority,‘ griev-

Kammholzi replied, “but Frank-

Other unions have also had a‘

Remember the New Deal?

~ But my day dream is not so different
from what happened 19 years ago. One of
the major foundations of the NewpDealwas
the Wagner Act. It was enacted for the pur-
pose of strengthening the bargaining power

of workers, so they could get higher wages.

This was done for the good of the whole
count.ry—-\-not just to be nice _to wage earners.
It was done to increase purchasing power,
and it worked.

The gove1'nrnent can’t p.ass a law raising

Wages, except minimums. It can only use its i

power to give working people a chance to or-
ganize and use their bargaining power.

Neither the employers nor their errand boys

they were at'te_r wage cuts, so they talked
about “protecting the individual worker in

talked about “communism."’

The decisidn to hold the

 ‘ -referendum was made by,
 the Int’l~ Executive Board

at its: recent _me_eting in
Denver, according t ‘a. let-
pter just, sent to al local

" unions in the U. S. and -
’ Canada by M.“  Travis,‘

V . secretary-tr‘ea_surer.; I ’ 1 ‘

.
Two big facts prompted

 the Board to set the refer-

endum in January‘ instead
of waiting for Convention

 action in Marchand a later

referendum vote, Travis

' Said. They are: “the neces-
.. _sity to expand. new organi-
- zation and the ‘immediate

-I threat of having to" fight
against the employer use of

»  the Butler-Brownell law on
g the labor movement.-”

" .“We want to point out,”

" wrote Travis, “that. operat-

ing costs have risen sub-
stantially, increased. serv-

 

Union will‘-no doubt become
the object of action under
the Brownell-Butler law.

“At the same time, we.
are now carrying on exten-
sive new organization, par- '

ticularly in Canada, which
must be expanded if we are
to capitalize on large de-
velopments taking place ' in

the non-ferrous metals in- 

dustry. - .

nition of the fact that the-

Profits in metals  

i  A Isighegr this lyefctr  -  ,1-

L ' THE improvement in non-ferrous metals over last'year is shown ,

in recent financialreports of majoricorporations. ‘Nearly all
. companies which issue quarterly statements show a very -healthy

increase in earnings for the first nine months of this yearas
V compared with the like period of last year..

The obvious exceptions are outfits like Kennecott and Ana-
conda which, as-was to be expected, suffered a drop in earnings

. as the result of strikes.  ‘ L e ' e _- V,
The non-strike-affected companies, as the result of high'sales

\

and higher prices, boosted theirprofits and regained much of '

the ground lost earlier. ‘

Coprnn

Copper demand is ‘still very strong ailthough available sup-

plies are still limited despite recentrelease of 51,500 tons originally
destined for government purchase.

Copper for November delivery is expected to be more scarce
than it was in October.‘ Chilean copper is now going to Europe
where it commands a higher price. An improvement in the supply
situation is_ expected by December unless new strikes develop in

foreign countries. .

Anaconda has ‘yetto settle negotiations with its Chilean
workers. Earlier this year workers at Anaconda’s Chuquicamata.
and Porterillos mines struck in sympathy with Braden (Kenne-
cott) workers. -They’re now in negotiations for anew‘ wage agree-
ment for themselves. The present contract expires December 31,
1954. ‘  7 

In Northern Rhodesia?-major source of “copper for ‘Great
Britain and Western Europe——-African mine workers were theaten-g
ing to strike as the result of failure to agree on ‘new wage demands. .

LEADi “ »

Lead prices held steady at 15 cents despite only’ “fair” sales
to U. S. consumers. Government stockpile buying plus heavy de-
mand for lead in Europe helped sustain the market in this“
cpuntry. .‘ -

Fear of possible lead shortages in Europe developed, as the
result of the dockworkers strike in Austi'alia which held up'ship-
ments from that major lead producing country. By-the end of
lastl week there were reports that the strike, would soon be
sett ed. '

One U. S. trade paper reported ‘last week that “The U.S.S.R. I

VICTORIA, B. C.—The Social

Credit government of this prov:

ince may be running headlong
into one of the greatest politi-

cal collisions of the party’s his- '

tory, and one which may have
disastrous effects on its for-
tunes.

.When Lands and Forests. Min-
ister Robert Summers an-
nounced a deal with the U. S.
Kaiser Aluminum interests to
build a storage dam across the
Columbia River system at the
Arrow Lakes to furnish power
south of the border, a chorus
of expostulation mounted across
Canada. A

“We need all the power we
have for ourselves,” declared
the Financial Post and other
papers, but Premier Bennett of
British Columbia dismissed the
protest, taking‘ a leaf from Mc-
Carth_v’s_ book, as “Communist
propaganda.” ‘

BUT RUMORS from Ottawa
. persisted to the effect that the

Federal g_,overnment would dis-
allow the power giveaway, as
on‘ at least two counts such a
deal would be outside provin-
cial jurisdiction, and it is pos-
sible that Canadian Premier

Louis St. _Laurent ‘is disposed ,

With assessments on ,hom,es at the maximum, the
city is in dire financial straits, despite the terrific tax
burden. Led by contro_ller Stan Racicot, and Alderman
Albert Gravel, Mine-Mill representatives on the city coun-
cil, labour has been fighting for measures during the past
‘year which would, by‘ the annexation of the company

towns of Copper Cliff and Frood, where the company's‘

huge smelter and mines are located, shift some of the
tax load to lnco, whose immense profits are exploited in
