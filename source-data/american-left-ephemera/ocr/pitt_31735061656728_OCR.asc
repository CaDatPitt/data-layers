From street and square, from hill and glen,
Of this vast world beyond my door,

I hear the tread of marching men,
The patient armies of the poor.

. Not ermine-clad or clothed in state,
Their title-deeds not yet made plain,
But waking early, toiling late;
The heirs of all the earth remain.

The peasant brain shall yet be wise,

The untamed pulse grow calm and still;
The blind shall see, the lowly rise

And work in peace Time's wondrous will.

Some day, without a trumpet’s call,
This news will o’er the world be blown:

Who Will Build the World Anew?

Who will build the world anew?
Who will break tradition?s chains?
Who will smite the power of gold?
Who will chant the sp1rit's gains?

War and hatred, let them-go!

Caste and creed have had their day;
Pride and lust shall lose their power
Who will find the better way?

Who will preach that might is weak?
Who will teach that love is power?
Who will find the Master - lostﬁe
This his day and this his hour.

Faithless priests and warring lords
Are as Babylon and Tyre:

This the day of prophet hosts .
Shouting truth in words of fire.

Who will live to slay the false?
Who will die to prove the true?
Who will claim the earth for God?
Who will build the world anew?

- Thomas Curtis Clark

Life of ages, Richly Poured

Life of ages, richly poured,
Love of God, unspent and free,
Flowing in the prophet's word,
And the people's liberty;

Never was to chosen race

That unstinted-tide confined:
Thine is every time and place,
Fountain sweet of heart and mind;

Breathing in the thinker's creed,
Pulsing in the hero's blood,
Nerving simplest thought and deed,
Freshening time with truth and good;

Gonsecrating art and song,
Holy book and pilgrim track,
Hurling floods of tyrant wrong
From the sacred limits back.

Life of ages, richly poured,

Love or God, unspent and free,

Flow still in the prophet's word,

And the people's liberty. ‘

THE CHRISTIAN WARRIOR

The Christian warrior fights forpeace,
His weapons faith and love;

He dare not from his struggles cease,
Till peoples war remove.

His faith in God is faith in man,

That he shall yet be free; *

The greatest age since time began,
The world shall one day see.

For peace and love in every heart,
His vision bids him strive,

Nor will he from his course depart,
Though hate and greed may thrive.
March on with God, thou warrior

brave,

Nor man nor devil fear;

Let none thy righteous heart deprave,
Till better days are here.

——-G. B. Jackson.

THE SON OF MAN

The son of man hasshown the way
A better world to gain,
Withnail-torn hands he beckons us
To follow in his train.

Those who can see clear-eyed as he,
Through shame and falsity,

Who try to bring the truth to men,
They follow in his train.

No war-lord is this son of man,_
With cannon and with flame,
No war-torn banners wave for him,
Or follow in his train.
Who seeks to rid the world -of strife,
Of bloodshed and its shame,
Who works for peace the wide world
o'er,

He follows in his train.

—-J. H. Geoghan.

The Day of the People

We knelt before kings; we bent before lords;

For theirs were the crowns, and theirs were the swords:
But the times of the bending and bowing are past,

And the way of the people is dawning at last!

We cringed before gold; we deiﬁed wealth;

We laid on its altar the life and the health

Of manhood and womanhood, childhood and youth:
But its lordship is doomed in this day of the truth.

The strength of the State we'll lavish on more

Than making of wealth and making of war;

We are learning at last, though the lesson comes late,
Tha-t the making of men is the task of the State.

Great Day of Jehovah, prophets and seers
Have sung of thy coming thousands of years;
Thank God for each sign that the dark night is past,
And the day of -the people is dawning at last!

The cry from the past and the call of to-day!
Earth wearies and wastes with her fresh life outpoured,
The glut of the cannon, the spoil of the sword.

2 Lo, dawns the new era, transcending the old,
The poet’s rapt vision, by prophet foretold!
From War’s grim tradition it maketh appeal
To service of all in a world’s commonweal.

3 Home, altar and school, the mill and the mart,
The workers aﬁeld, in science. in‘art,

\ Peace-circled and sheltered, shall join to create
The manifold life of the ﬁrm-builded State.

4 Then, then shall the empire of right over wrong
Be shield to the weak and a curb to the strong;
Then justice prevail and, the battle—ﬂags furled,
The High Court of Nations give law to the world.

5 And thou, O my Country, from many made one,
Last-born of the nations, at morning thy sun,
Arise to the place thou art given to ﬁll, ‘

The Voice of Millions

Hear the voice of millions pleading,
From their miseries to be freed.
Asking that their chains be stricken,
From the wheel of vested greed.
Shall~we urge them to submission,
Tell them that t'is God's decree,
wretched as is their condition

Never try to set them free?

Hear the cry of men of labor,

Toiling hard in mill and mine.

Asking that we grant them Justice,

As from slavery they climb.

Shall we drive them back in hatred,

Back to toil and wretchedness? ,

Bind them fast in bitter bondage, .Mw
Heedless in our callousness? _-’

We will rally to their pleadings
Make their miseries our call,

To a struggle for their freedom
Freedom for all men enthralled.
Men in factory and workshop
Workers toiling in the field

ln your cause we will not yield.

THE NEW ORDER

A nobler order yet shall be

Than any that the world hath known
When men obey, and yet are free,

Are loved, and yet can stand alone.

Oh, boldly speak thy secret thought,
And t ell thy want, and by the wise
Be unto nobler action brought,
And breathe the air of purer skies.

Strive less to bring the lofty down
Than raise the low to be thy peers;

Love is the only golden crown

- That will not tarnish with the years.

GOD OF THE STRONG, GOD

OF THE WEAK

God of the strong, God of the weak,

Lord of all lands, and our own land;

Light of our souls, from Thee we seek

Light of Thy light, strength from Thy

hand.

In suffering Thou hast made us one,»
In mighty burdens one are we;

Teach us that lowliest duty done
Is highest service unto Thee.

Teach us, great Teacher of mankind,
Sacriﬁce that brings Thy balm;

The love, the work that bless and bind;

Teach us Thy majesty, Thy calm.

Teach Thou, and we shall know, indeed,

The truth divine that maketh free;

And knowing, we may sow the seed
That blossoms through eternity.

AURELIA. 7.6.7.6.7‘.6.7.6.

The voice of God is calling

Its summons unto men;
As once he spake in Zion,

So now he speaks again.
Whom shall I send to succor

My people in their need?
Whom shall I send to loosen

The bonds of shame and greed?

I hear my people crying
In cot and mine and slum;

No ﬁeld or mart is silent,
N 0 city street is dumb.
I see my people falling
In darkness and despair.
Whom shall I send to shatter
‘I'he fetters which they bear?

SAMUEL SEBASTIAEN WESLEY, 1864

We heed, O Lord, thy summons,
And answer: Here are we!

Send us upon thine errand!
Let us thy servants be!

Our strength is dust and ashes,
Our years a passing hour;

But thou canst use our weakness,

To magnify thy power.

From ease and plenty save us,
From pride of place absolve;
Purge us of low desire,
Lift us to high resolve.
Take us, and make us holy,
Teach us thy will and way.
Speak, and, behold! we answer,
Command, and we obey!

THE AGE OF GOOD

Mankind has waited long;
Still saved by hope it waits,
Calming its eagerness with song
While quelling fears and hates.

No more the soul is bound
By childhood’s partial creeds:

Love makes the earth all holy ground
And ﬁlls all human needs.

War’s trumpets still may peal,
And Greed with Greed may ﬁght,

But they who shape earth’s future weal
Urge brotherhood and right.

Be ours to sing thy praise,
Be ours to aid thy birth,

And earlier bring the wished-for days
Of righteousness on earth.

—.I. H. West

SEND DOWN THY TRUTH, O GOD

Send down Thy truth, 0 God;
Too long the shadows frown,

Too long the darkened way we’ve trod,
Thy Truth, 0 Lord, send down.

Send down Thy spirit free,
Till wilderness and town

One temple for Thy worship be,
Thy spirit, 0 send down.

Send down Thy love, Thy life,
Our lesser lives to crown
And cleanse them of their hate and strife,
~ Thy living love send down.

Send _down Thy peace,  Lord,
Earth’s bitter voices drown

In one deep ocean of accord,
Thy peace,-O God, send down.

A Hymn for Our Day

C. M.

Out of the loathsome ways of war,
Out of the hate’s increase,
Out of the lusts Thy saints abhor—
Lead us, 0 Prince of Peace!

Out of the scorn of race for race,
Out of the pride of clan,

Out of all limitings of grace,—-
Lead us, 0 Son of ‘Man!

Out of the grasping and the greed,
Out of the selfish strife,

Out of the help our brothers need,-
Lead us, 0 Bread of Life!

Out of the ways the brute may know,
Out of the yoke and rod,
Out to the roads where God would
go»:
Lead us, 0 Son of God!

—D. P. McGeachy

6 0 Father, from the curse of war
We pra thee give release,
And spee , 0 speed the blessed day
Of justice, love, and peace.

TAKE DOWN YOUR BANNERS
C. M.

Take down your bloody banners, War,
And’ cease your battle cries;
Your dreams are not worth fighting
for,
Your songs are brazen lies.

Too long have poets hymned your
praise.
How faithful have we been
To follow you through stormy days——
Our great and fateful sin!

But now we know you as you are,
So let your boasting cease;

We fight beneath a fairer star,
Thestar of love and peace.

Take down your bloody banners, War,
At last have we grown wise.
Your dreams are not worth fighting
for,
Your songs are brazen Ii-es.

-—Thomas Curtis Clark

LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING

Lift every voice and sing,

Till earth and heaven ring,

Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;

Let our rejoicing rise

High as the listening skies, -

Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark path

has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present
has brought us;

Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod,

Bitter the chastening rod,

Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,

Have not our weary feet

Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has

been watered, ,
We have come, treading our path through the
blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
Till now we stand at last

 

Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;

‘Thou who hast by Thy might,

Led us into the light, ,

Keep us forever in the path, we pray.

Lest our feet stray from the places, Our God,
where we met Thee,

Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the
world, we forget Thee,

Shadowed beneath Thy hand,

May we forever stand, True to our God,

True to our native land.

——James Weldon Johnson

DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES

E ARE a fellowship dedicated to the consumma-
tion of the new society as portrayed in the teach-

ings of Jesus. We believe that the principles of
that society, namely, reverence for personality and the unity
of the human family, cannot be fulﬁlled in a social order based
on proﬁt, but only in a cooperative democracy organized for
the common good and in which production is for the com-
mon need. We pledge ourselves to strive for the realization
of that ideal. ’

As guides to ‘life and conduct we accept and assert the
supremacy of conscience; intellectual integrity: freedom of
speech and assemblage; and the equality of all men irrespective
of race, color or creed. For inspiration we look to Jesus of
Nazareth and all great prophets of love and justice.

MEMBERSHIP

Any person, irrespective of race. color or creed or political
aﬁiliation, may become a member of the Church of the People
by subscribing to its purpose and principles.

LIFT EV*RY‘yOICE AND SING
National Negro It/mm

Lift ev - iry voice and sing, Till earth and heav - en ring,
Ring with the har - mo - nies of Lib -»er - tyg:

Let our re - joic - ing rise Highasthe list - 'ning skies,
Let it re - sound loud as the roll - ing seam. ‘

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us
Sing a. song full of the. hope that the pres-ent has brought us;
Fac - ing the ris - ing sun Of our new day be - gun,

Let us march on till vie; —» to -» ry is won.

-.2...

Sto - ny the road we trod, Bit-nter the chast-'ning rod,

Felt in the days when hope un - born had died;

Yet with a stead -- y beat, Have notour wear - y feet

Come to the place for which our fa -. thers sighed?

We haveoome o - ver’ a‘ -- way that with tears has been wa - tered

We have come, tread-ing our path thro" the blood of the slaugh - tered_:
Out from the gloom - y past,,,Til1 now we stand at last

Where the white gleam of our ‘bright star is cast.

-3.

God of our wea -, ry years, God of our si - lent tears,

Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way; .

Thou who hast by Thy might, Led us in - to the light,

Keep us for - ev - er in the path, we pray. .

Lest our feet stray from the pla - ces, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with. the wine of the world, we for - get Thee;
Shad-owed be - neath Thy hand, May we. for -a ev - er stand,

True to our God, True to our na - tive land;
