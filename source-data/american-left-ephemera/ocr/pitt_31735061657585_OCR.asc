 

N NOVEMBER 3 the people voted overwhelmingly

against VVall Street and for a better life. This vote was a

mandate to the Roosevelt government to achieve very
deﬁnite social improvements during the coming four years.

But the setback given to reaction will not bring any beneﬁts for
the workers, farmers, and middle class people, unless these masses
follow it up by developing and enforcing a concrete program for
labor action, social legislation and peace.

During the election campaign, President Roosevelt made many
promises to the impoverished masses. But the people must not rely
upon the government of itself to fulﬁll these promises. To translate
the people’s mandate into ﬂesh and blood, the masses generally must
build up and use their economic and political power in the months to
come. Higher living standards, greater democracy, world peace,
cannot be won without mass pressure upon the government and the
employers.

The workers must push forward their demands for higher
wages and. improved conditions, organize the great masses of unor-
ganized workers, reunite the American Federation of Labor.

The people must formulate their own legislative program, and
exert pressure upon the government to enact this into life. They
should hold broad state and national legislative conferences. They
need to organize a progressive bloc in Congress and in the state legis~
latures. They must build the F armer—Labor Party and lay the
foundation for the People’s Front against Wall Street, reaction and
fascism. Only by vigorous independent organization and action on
the economic and political fields can the people carry through their
mandate. '

The destiny of the people is in their own hands. Now is the time
for the big push against reaction, fascism and war. Now is the time
to put the people’s election mandate into effect.
