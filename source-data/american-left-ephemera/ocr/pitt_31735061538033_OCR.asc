Requires New Skills

New skills will be required to handle automated
machinery. Moreover as Dr. Jamieson, professor of
economics at the University of British Columbia,
declared in addressing a seminar of the New Demo-
cratic Party in Hamilton recently: “at the present
and anticipated rate of technological change and dis-
placement, young workers now entering the labor
market for the ﬁrst time will, on the average, have
to change their occupations, not just their jobs, but
occupations, that require a more or less lengthy
period of training, three times in the course of their
working lifetime.”

As the Senate Special Committee on Manpower
was compelled to admit: “the jobs that are created
and the jobs that are eliminated very often require
different types of skill.”

The scope of the problem can be seen in the fol-
lowing remarks of Dr. Malcolm Taylor, President,
University of Alberta:

“More than 200,000 adult Canadians have never
been to school. Some 870,000 didn’t get past Grade
4. Of not quite 400,000 Canadian youngsters who
enter Grade 2 every year, 76,000 drop out before
Grade 8 and 132,000-—one out of every three-don't
go past Grade 8. This is. in a labor market where,
since 1955, 70% of the unemployed have been those
with no more than Grade 8 and where, the National
Employment Service says, men with no more than
Grade 8 are ineligible for 70% of the jobs.”

It may be said that those displaced from auto-
mated plants and industries, could ﬁnd work else-
where, particularly in the service industries which
have expanded in the past period of time. However,
those that have were compelled to work at reduced
wages, in most cases in unorganized services and
trades. Moreover here too, automation is developing.
In fact as already pointed out, in Canada offices
were the ﬁrst target of automation and while there

10

 

 

have been no indications as yet of serious displace-
ment of workers from the service industries, such
in fact may well be the case before too long.

The Wall Street Journal drew attention to the.fol-
lowing: “in the decade of the 50s, white collar em-
ployment grew by 2.61% a year, but in 1963 the
increase was less than 1%. And that was in a year
when total non-farm employment rose 2.3%. There
is abundant evidence that automation is primarily
responsible for the slower ofﬁce growth. Unlike the
postwar slow-down in blue collar employment which
was dramatically chronicled in newspaper headlines
and television shows, the drop-off in office hiring
has gone largely unnoticed. The big reason, personnel
men say, is that office mechanization rarely results
in worker layoffs becauseof the normally high turn-
over in office help. This turnover—which averages
20 to 30% annually at banks and insurance com-

panies — enables firms to reduce their work force
through normal employee attrition.” (My emphasis.
W. K.)

As the U.S.A. goes, so goes Canada.

Automation may bring new industries, goods and
services into being, giving employment to those laid
off in automated plants. But some experts predict
that these new industries may likewise be automated
and therefore offer no great possibilities for expand-
ing employment.

How true that is, remains to be seen. But what is
clear is that automation eliminates jobs and workers.
In fact some experts. predict that by 1974 automation
will have eliminated two million jobs. During that
same period it is estimated that the labor force will
increase by another 1,500,000 workers, primarily
young people entering the labor force. If anyone
believes this to be an exaggeration, attention is
drawn to the following statement by J. P. Francis,
director of the Federal Labor Department’s economic
and research branch. He says:

11

   

“To match the expected labor force growth, em-
ployment during the next eight years will probably
have to increase at an annual rate of 2.5%. In 1963,
employment expanded by 2.4%, but the average
annual rate since 1957 has been only 1.8%. During
this period, more than 1,500,000 students will leave
school to seek permanent jobs for the ﬁrst time. The
percentage of the labor force between 46 and 65
will also expand considerably.”

Thus, over the next ten years, three and a half
million workers will be unemployed unless the eco-
nomy expands to make three and a half million new
jobs available. To break it down further, three hun-
dred and ﬁfty thousand new jobs need to be found
yearly to merely break even.

This may well be a conservative estimate of the
effects of automation on the jobs of workers over
the next ten years.

What then will happen to those displaced by auto-
mation? Can jobs be created rapidly and plentifully
enough to offset the jobs wiped out by mechaniza-
tion and automation?

ls Human Labor Becoming Obsolete?

It is probably no exaggeration to say that today
the threats of nuclear war and of automation con-
stitute the biggest challenge ever to be faced by the
working class and the trade union movement of our
country.

If the threat of nuclear war raises the question
whether man is in danger of becoming obsolete, that
is, obliterated then automation raises the question: is
human labor likewise in danger of becoming obsolete?

This seems a far-fetched question and yet it is
being posed today. ~ '

Richard Bellman, U.S. automation expert, declared
not very long ago that “as automation develops 2%
of the population of the U.S.A.,” would in his opinion,
“be able to produce all the goods and services needed
in the foreseeable future.”

Dr. Stuart Jamieson, expressed the view that “ul-
timately 20 or 25% of the population in Canada could
produce all the goods and services needed .by every-
one.” And he added: “automation thus creates the
prospect of a drastic change in the whole occupa-
tional structure of the labor force which makes the
maintenance of full employment increasingly dif-
ﬁcult to conceive.” .

Dr. Bernard J. Mueller-Thym, another U.S. expert
on automation, in addressing a seminar in Montreal,
stated that:

“North America has ﬁve years in which to prepare
for the massive impact of automation on the work
force and on society as a whole . . . The disappear-
ance of work has serious implications in a world in
which wealth has been distributed on the basis of
pay for work. There is hardly enough time left in which
to invent a new system for replacing or supplement-
ing pay.”

In a recent round-table discussion in the U.S.A. be-
tween Ralph Hellstein, President of the United Pack-
inghouse Workers of America and a Mr. Pie] and
Robert Theobald, the same idea is advanced. Accord-
ing to them “the chances of reaching full employment
in the context of today's world are pretty slim. One
should be realistic and admit that the goal of full em-
ployment is dead. Therefore we should be talking
about how to provide income for people when there
are no jobs for them.”

Ed Finn, in his column in Canadian Transport, the
oﬂicial organ of the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway
Transport Workers (CBRT) comes to a similar con-
clusion, declaring:

“The end result of the automation revolution will
be a world in which almost all work is performed by
machines. The most conservative cyberneticists now
estimate that by the year 2000 less than 5% of able-
bodied men and women will be engaged in actual
production.

“If the prediction is accurate—and we have no
reason to question it-—the efforts to provide alter-
native jobs for displaced workers on a permanent
basis, are doomed to failure.

“Full employment will become an obsolete term, an
increasingly unattainable goal. As the new technology
improves and expands, machines will take over more
and more hitherto human tasks, and the unemploy-
ment level will steadily rise until it embraces 95%
or more of the work force.

“This is the prospect that awaits us, try as we may
to escape it. It calls for sweeping changes in existing
methods and policies and more than that, an entirely
new social code. The idea that men must ‘earn their
living,’ ‘must work to eat’ was valid in an economy
of scarcity; but it will not apply in an economy of
overabundance in which machines do most of the
work.

“There is too much shallow thinking about the chal-
lenge of automation. Men of little vision seem to be-
lieve that the problem can be solved almost entirely
by retraining displaced workers. They simply cannot
grasp the fact——the admittedly shocking fact-that
man is gradually being removed from the process of
production. Retraining is based on the assumption that
the traditional jobs will need to be ﬁlled whereas the
truth is that those jobs will vanish.”

To which the Globe and Mail in an editorial entitled
“what are machines for,” adds the following:

“The fear of automation and some of the panicky
responses to which it leads are justiﬁable only if it is
granted that there is a kind of basic value to work
itself. This is the sort of assumption men have made
through the ages. But it may be argued that the‘ real
fear is not loss of work but loss of income. . . . The
principle that one must work to eat has already been
discarded. Society accepts unemployment insurance
and welfare schemes which run counter to the prin-
ciple. If this acceptance of the right to eat without

14

 

 

working is to be broadened there may be grounds
for beginning now while the process of automation is
still going on.” . . . A

-On ‘the surface some of the‘ views advanced here
seem to be quite revolutionary and motivated. by- good
intentions based on the assumption that automation
will encompass the entire economy within the next
30 odd years or so.

What they all have in common is that the working
class will accept that kind of future, a future portray-
ed by Dr. W. Harvey Cruikshank, a vice-president of
the Bell Telephone Co. of Canada, as “a society of
idle masses wallowing in a beer and television cul-
ture,” with a small elite doing all the useful creative
work. '

What they all assume is that the working class
will disappear, that the trade union movement will
disappear while monopoly and capitalism continue
to operate as usual.

System Obsolete, Not Workers

What they assume is that the working people will
sit idly by and not strive to change an obsolete system
which cannot provide useful, creative work.

How realistic and correct is that estimate? _Will
automation embrace the entire economy? Is human
labor in danger of becoming obsolete?_ Is full employ-
ment an unattainable goal?

The danger in posing the question in this way is
that it tends to divert the Canadian people and the
trade union movement away from the struggle for
useful, creative jobs.

It takes the government off the hook with respect
to its responsibilities now for coping with automa-
tion and its consequences.

It takes monopoly, the owners of automated ma-
chinery off the hook.

It gives no sound perspective to the working class

15

  
 

‘and trade union movement as to the kind of policies
it should advance now and inthe immediate future
to cope with automation so as to ensure that the
Canadian; people share in the beneﬁts of automation.

Why ﬁght to get a share of the beneﬁts of auto-
mation when that share appears to be nothing else
than enforced idleness?

Why ﬁght for jobs when there won’t be any?

Why demand the training and retraining of work-
ers, young and old, if the only future they have is
to be part of that 95 percent of the population living
in enforced idleness?

Why ﬁght for reduced hours of work with no re-
duction in take home pay?

Of course if it is true that automation and the
scientiﬁc revolution will in fact eliminate the need
for labor in all areas of production and services, that
is a diiferent thing.

But is it so?

From a strictly technical point of view, that pos-
sibility exists over a long period of time. However
from an economic point of view, from the standpoint
of conﬂicting capitalist interests and the struggle for
proﬁts, it is extremely doubtful that all industry —
be it the goods-producing industry, the service in-
dustry or primary industry — will in fact be com-
pletely automated. Over the next 10 to 20 years it
may be that automation will affect around 25 per-
cent or more of the labor force. And that is bad
enough.

This is said not to minimize the scope of the prob-
lem but rather to avoid exaggerating what may occur
out of all proportions and in such a way as to leave
the labor movement in a state of futility, of help-
lessness and defeatism.

Automation constitutes a grave problem for the

‘working class, but it is within its power and that of

society to solve.
Those, who argue that the struggle for the goal of

16

 

 

full employment is unattainable and that the labor
movement should be concentrating on the problem
of incomes for those not working, close their eyes
to the unsatisﬁed needs of the Canadian people
which, if. fulﬁlled, -would give useful, creative work
for all willing and able to work for a long time to
come. .

There is need to eliminate poverty in Canada.

There is need for low-cost and low-rental housing
on avast scale. Hundreds of thousands of homes need
repairs, running water, baths, toilets, hot water, elec-
tric or gas stoves, refrigerators and washing machines,
vacuum cleaners, telephones and furnaces.

There is need for more schools, hospitals, parks,
civic centres, roads and properly organized transit
systems. .

There isvneed for the economic development of the
country, stimulated by a publicly owned national
power system that would enable the great natural re-
sources of our country to be developed in the in-
terests of the Canadian people.

There is need for more services, additional teach-
ers, doctors, nurses, dentists.

There is need for a further extension of trade on a
mutually satisfactory basis with the socialist coun-
tries and for further assistance, without political
strings, to stimulate the industrialization of the un-
der-developed countries.

There is need for a fully integrated social security
system, from the cradle to the grave, including por-
table pensions, medicare, increased minimum wages,
substantial increases in unemployment insurance
beneﬁts, in family allowances and so on.

There is need for more leisure through reduced
hours of work with no reduction in take-home pay.
There is need for longer vacations of two to three
months duration if necessary, and more statutory holi-
days. Instead of an idle poor and an elite which does
all the work, hours of work should be drastically re-

17

    

  

duced as productivity rises and living standards raised
through substantial wage increases.

All these and other like measures are job-creating.
Alli these measures increase‘ consumer purchasing
power. All these measures mean more jobs for Can-
adian workers.

Human labor has not, nor is likely to become ob-
solete for a long time to come. Far from disappearing
the working class will continue to be the leading
dynamic force for social change.

As against such measures which correspond with
the real interests of Canada and her people, the pro-
posal is being advanced that the majority of the Can-
adian people accept the idea of being placed on the
dole. This in essence is what paying people for not
working means, at least to monopoly.

They do not have in mind that everyone not Work-
ing should have a living wage, that everyone have a
guaranteed income as a matter of right.

What they have in mind is that those not Work-
ing be placed on charity, on the dole, in a state of
perpetual poverty, and used as a Weapon to lower
living standards and weaken the trade union move-
ment.

Such policies, precisely at a time when automa-
tion increases productivity a hundred and even
thousand fold, is best calculated to hasten economic
crisis and bring chaos to our country and its people.

This is not the policy or perspective the working
class can or will accept. Automation does not have
to be a nightmare rather than a blessing.

Automation can give us more leisure without
throwing working people permanently out of work.

Automation can give us higher living standards.

Automation can lead to lower prices providing
monopoly proﬁteering is curbed.

Automation can give us shorter hours rather than
layoﬁs.

Automation can give up higher wages out of rising
18

 

productivity, rather than higher proﬁts to monopoly.

But to make this possible, to ensure that automation
will truly beneﬁt the Canadian people, requires ﬁrst
of all that the unlimited powers of monopoly, the
owners of the automated machines, be curbed.

This is now the crucial task before the Canadian
people and more particularly the labor movement to
which it needs to direct all its attention.

Automation and Collective Bargaining.
the Need for a New Labor Policy

It is fairly evident that automation which is as yet
in its infancy is confronting the trade union movement
with a challenge such as it has never faced before.
How to cope with the problem? What program ought
to be advanced to meet it? Can collective bargaining
do the job? What effect will automation have on the
trade union movement as such and on its structure?

In some quarters it is being suggested that the trade
union movement too, as with human labor, will
become obsolete over the next period of time. After
all, if only 5% of the population will be working,
according to some experts, will there be a need for
a trade union movement?

On the other hand, others like Mr. Irvine, assistant
director of research of the Canadian Labor Congress,
believes that “there would still be a labor movement
in the year 2000 but exactly what our role should be
then is diﬂicult to predict.”

We shall let others speculate on What the trade
union movement may or may not look like in the
year 2000. It is safe to say however that what its role
may be by then will in large measure be decided by
what the trade union movement does today, with
respect to automation and the scientiﬁc revolution.

There are two views being advanced on this score.

One view holds that the problems thrown up by
automation can be dealt with by collective bargaining

alone, that no changes in the very structure of capital-
ism are required to cope with these complex problems.

Another view holds that collective bargaining and
the strike weapon will be thrown out the window as
a result of automation and therefore other avenues
need to be sought to tackle this problem. This view
tends to downgrade the role of the trade unions and
of collective bargaining and minimizes what the trade
union movement can and should do.

In making the point it must also be said that col-
lective bargaining alone cannot cope with automation.
It can only do part of the job. This is to be seen in
the character of demands and negotiations conducted
by various trade unions in the recent period which by
and large concentrated on the problem of job security.

This is a vital and necessary but necessarily limited
demand. It may protect the job of the worker during
his or her lifetime but it accepts the fact that when
the Worker leaves the plant or passes away, so does
the job. It is called natural attrition.

This is a holding operation, not a solution to auto-
mation.

How about the problem of those who are unorganiz-
ed or have no or very little bargaining strength? What
about the unemployed? What about those affected by
automation who were unable to win job security, or
the young people entering the labor market?

V Where are their jobs, let alone job security?

What about the problem of training and retraining,
the upgrading of skills which automation makes neces-
sary and education for young people in the automated
age?

What about the problem of regulating and control-
ling technological change so that its impact on the
jobs of workers is lessened and so that the working
class can also beneﬁt from automation?

These cannot be solved in any basic way by col-
lective bargaining with a particular employer. They

20

 

 

can only be dealt with by government action and legis-
lation.

When automation destroys jobs, there must be other
jobs for displaced workers. This is the responsibility
of government. It is equally its responsibility to under-
take a vast training and retraining program with full
pay for the workers during the period of training. But
it must be training related to an expanding economy,
so that workers so trained can ﬁnd useful and creative
jobs at decent wages. It is equally government respon-
sibility to maintain and increase consumer purchasing
power. No less is it its responsibility to enact effec-
tive legislation that would control and regulate the
pace at which automation develops.

This is why, alongside its collective bargaining pro-
grams which at best may protect the jobs of some
sections of the working class, the trade union move-
ment needs to advance a more far-reaching program
which challenges monopoly’s unrestricted “rights.”

“Management rights” is the cover under which mo-
nopoly strives to maintain its power to exploit, to ﬁre,
to restrict trade union rights, and if necessary, as in
the case of the lockout of the ITU by the three Toronto
daily papers, to destroy trade unions.

“Management Rights" a Sacred Cow

“Management rights” under automation would mul-
tiply that evil a thousand-fold.

This sacred cow which monopoly has used to good
purpose for so long, cannot be allowed to continue if
the public interest is to be served. What is involved
is not management rights, but the right of the Cana-
dian people to useful, creative work, to leisure and
culture, to a good life. Management rights stand in the
way of achieving this. These unrestricted powers
which monopoly now enjoys must therefore be curbed
in the interests of society as a whole.

The demand now being raised in the trade union

21

  

movement that labor should have a voice on all basic
issues having to do with the welfare of the working
people is in fact a part—indeed, a very important part
—of the demand that the rights of the trade union
movement be extended and that “management rights”
be curbed. This is a just demand.

It is equally in the public interest that labor be
given a full voice in the installation, regulation and
control of automation and that there be some measure
of workers’ control over norms of production to curb
merciless speed up in the plants.

Democracy needs to be extended into the plants and
industries and the role of the trade unions strengthen-
ed, rather than restricted as it is at present. Only
in this Way is there some assurance that the machine
will not be allowed to become master over man and
that man could become master of the machine.

The regulation and control of automation is a deci-
sive part of the struggle to ensure that the beneﬁts
of automation will in fact accrue to the Canadian
people.

It needs to be spelled out in effective legislation,
as part of an over-all program to deal with automa-
tion. Its starting point must be that technical progress
leads to social progress, not regression for the Cana-
dian people.

This will require political and legislative action on
a massive scale on the part of the trade union move-
ment. Monopoly and its political spokesmen will op-
pose measures to make automation serve the public
interest. This was made clear in the remarks of former
Ontario Cabinet member Robert Macauley at the On-
tario conference on “Automation and Social Change”
when he stated:

“I do not believe that the solution to automation
lies in legislation; nor do I believe the governments
can or should accept responsibility for ﬁnding a solu-
tion.” .

What Mr. Macauley is saying is that labor should

22

 

 

cope with the problem of automation with one hand
tied behind its back and that monopoly should be
given free rein to do what it wishes, irrespective of
the social and economic consequences of its actions.

What an irresponsible position to take!

Government has a direct responsibility to ensure
that automation serves the public interest and labor in
co-operation with democratic public opinion must
make it live up to its responsibilities be it on a
provincial or federal scale.

Program to Meet Automation

This is directly tied in with its collective bargaining
program.

Automation gives a new urgency to the demand for
higher wages, for the shorter work week with no
reduction in take home pay, for longer vacations and
more statutory holidays. A reduction in hours of work
is increasingly becoming a major national need.

It gives greater urgency to the demand for increased
pensions, higher unemployment insurance beneﬁts, old
age security, family allowances and minimum wages.

It makes the struggle for a guaranteed annual wage
more essential than ever.

It emphasizes the need for company-wide seniority,
for more and better professional and technical train-
ing, for training and retraining of workers at com-
pany and government expense and with full pay during
the period of training, for adequate severance pay for
those laid off.

Automation requires new skills. In turn the trade
unions need to press for new rates and new classiﬁca-
tions for new jobs and oppose any effort by employers
to reclassify new jobs downwards.

Automation makes it necessary for the trade union
movement to oppose long term contracts and to press
for short term ones, or else to make sure that there
are provisions in long term contracts that will enable

23

the unions to deal promptly with any new situation.

A contract today may be worthless tomorrow if a
company automates a plant and throws the workers
out of their jobs. Automation therefore makes it
necessary to amend Labor Acts to give the unions the
right to strike on all questions not covered by the
contract.

Automation and mechanization make it necessary
to ‘include in contracts the demand for joint consulta-
tion in regards to the installation of new equipment
with effective safeguards to the jobs and standards of
the workers.

Automation and mechanization make it necessary
for the workers to have a say over production norms.

Automation, which could seriously undermine the
strength of unions, places more sharply than ever
the need for co-operation, for federation or merging
of unions in every industry, so as to enable the
workers to bargain more effectively with the giant
monopolies.

Not least, it makes joint action, solidarity and a re-
united trade union movement essential to the further
advance of the labor movement.

Only a fully united and sovereign trade union move-
ment can begin to cope effectively with these complex
problems. A divided trade union movement spells de-
feat for the workers in the age of automation.

Automation gives new urgency to the task of or-
ganizing the unorganized.

It is this kind of new labor policy that needs to be
fought for today.

The workers of our country do not take a negative
attitude to automation which could enormously ease
the burden of labor, eliminate drudgery and ensure a
good life of creative work, of leisure and culture to
the Canadian people. The workers after all, are not
machine-Wreckers standing in the way of progress.
They understand that it is not the machines which are
the enemy of the people but those who own, operate

24

 

and control these wonder machines, irrespective of
its social consequences to the people and to society
as a whole.

What the workers want and correctly so, is that the
beneﬁts of automation be made available to the peo-
ple, that it help to satisfy human needs, not just the
proﬁts of monopoly.

In striving for that objective it is not the machines
which need to be curbed but the owners of these
machines, so that the fruits of automation can in truth
be available to the people in the form of continuous
full employment, drastically reduced hours of work,
more leisure and higher living standards.

Whether that can be achieved depends upon who
controls the economy and those automated wonders.

What is required is the regulation and control of

technological change within a comprehensive national ' ‘

economic and social plan.

Curb Monopoly

Monopoly is today beginning to tinker with the idea
of planning but what it has in mind is “planning” in
the interests of monopoly proﬁts. However there can
be no effective planning on the basis of the so-called
“free enterprise” system.

To plan effectively in face of the great changes au-
tomation will bring about requires an extension of the
area of public ownership to all vital sectors of the
economy. Without public ownership economic and
social planning in the interests of the Canadian people
is impossible. Such policies require governments res-
ponsive to the people’s needs.

Thus, while advancing its minimum program to
cushion the impact of automation, the trade union
movement is impelled to go beyond that and advance
a program of economic and social planning directed
to curbing the power of monopoly and to regulat-
ing technological changes, so that the people can be

25

 

the beneﬁciaries rather than the victims of automa-
tion. '

Of course only socialism is the sure guarantee that
the scientiﬁc and technological revolution will bring
the full beneﬁts of automation to the Canadian people.

Surely, it is an indictment of the capitalist system
that it can offer nothing more than the dole to count-
less thousands when there are so many needs to be
fulﬁlled and when science and technology can so
easily satisfy these needs. This situation arises because
the means of production are in the hands of monopoly
and their concern is not the Welfare of the people but
the acquisition of ever more proﬁts for themselves.

Socialism creates no such problems. Every advance
in technique under public ownership results in low-
ered hours of work, the raising of living standards and
reduced prices. But more than that, automation under
socialism does not create an obsolete man. It creates
the conditions for a more fully developed, cultured
man able to give his best to society and receive the
best from it. This is the way automation is dealt with
in the Soviet Union. There is no fear of automation
there nor can there be. This is so because socialist
society, having eliminated monopoly ownership, and
the contradictions and anarchy it engenders, beneﬁts
as a whole from every advance in science and techno-
logy. Planning truly serves the interests of society.

As the working class strives to ensure that auto-
mation will be a blessing and not a curse it will ﬁnd
that in the ﬁnal analysis only a basic transformation
of society, only socialism can ensure that the full
fruits of automation come to the people.

One thing is clear. If automation is to be of beneﬁt
to the Canadian people, they will have to ﬁght for
these beneﬁts every inch of the way. They won’t come
of themselves, or out of the goodness of heart of
monopoly or its governments. They will only come as
a result of the united action of the working class,
supported by democratic public opinion.

26

 

 

Automation is not only labor’s problem. It is the
problem of society as a whole. And society as a whole
must deal with it. But it is the labor movement, the
working class, which must lead the "ﬁght.

Involved in this great struggle is the ﬁght for human
dignity, the right to creative work, the right to be a
useful member of society in a world at peace, free
once and for all from the nightmare of world nuclear
war.

about the author

Born in Montreal. William Kashtan has been a
member of the Communist movement since the
age of 18. As a young man he served as
national secretary of the Young Communist
League, giving leadership to young people
during the Hungry '3iis. For a time he was a
Communist Party organizer in Quebec and is
a member of the party's national executive.
Well known in trade union circles. the author
is currently the party's national labor secretary
and writes a regular weekly column tor the
CANADIAN TRIBUNE on a broad range oi
labor and trade union topics. His commentary
is widely read for its compelling and proiound
treatment of the many problems confronting
working men and women. His pamphlet on
automation is both a timely and highly useful
contribution to the intense debate now going
on across Canada on this subject.

VER THE last number‘ of years automation has
become a household word in our country. Some-
times it is used too loosely to describe what is actually
mechanization. There is a world of diﬁerence however
between mechanization and automation. Mechaniza-
tion requires workers to control and regulate the
machines. Automation, is entirely different. It re-
places manpower with machines which do all the
work. These machines control and regulate them-
selves from the beginning to the end of the process.
‘ No wonder automation has been called a revolu-
tionary development. Its revolutionary features lie
not only in the new techniques of production which
it opens up, and in the great increase in productivity
it makes possible; it lies in its human consequences,
in its economic and social implications to society
as a whole.

For if automation means anything, it means mass

displacement of workers from industry and in-
creased exploitation of those who work. If it did not
mean that, employers would not proceed with auto-
mation. Why automate at considerable cost unless
it brings more proﬁts through increased productivity
and the elimination of manpower?
‘ The Toronto Star made no bones about what
automation means and why the three daily papers in
Toronto instituted multi-purpose computers, when it
declared on the eve of the lock-out imposed on the
members of the International Typographical Union:

“The ITU’s claim for jurisdiction over multi-purpose
computer work reﬂected fear of automation and its
concern that there should be no reduction in the
number of jobs covered by that union. If the news-
papers agreed to that principle it would be impossible
to automate since expensive equipment would bring
no savings in wage costs.” (My emphasis W. K.)

Clear enough one would think. However some
big business spokesmen have tried to gloss over the
social and economic effects of automation, one of

5

   

these being Mr. Winters, the Chairman of Rio Algom
Mines Ltd., and a director of many large corporations.
Speaking in Halifax not very long ago, Mr. Winters
declared that:

“Automation does not necessarily result in an over-
all reduction in the labor force, especially in those
countries which make the tools of automation. More-
over, many devotees of automation as a means of
saving labor costs are ﬁnding to their chagrin that
they have had to take at least as many employees on
their staff to maintain the intricate machinery and
keep it running as were displaced by the installation.”

This was even too much for the Globe and Mail
which was compelled to declare editorially that: “Mr.
Winters may have oversimpliﬁed. Not every machine
takes as many people -to run it as are displaced by it.”

Mechanization and Jobs

To put it mildly this understates the problem. One
has only to see what mechanization without automa-
tion has done in the way of eliminating workers from
jobs, to realize what automation on top of mechaniza-
tion would do.

Here are a few examples of what mechanization
has meant. ‘

Twenty-seven thousand production workers were
employed in the motor vehicle industry during the
ﬁrst 10 months of 1956. During the ﬁrst 10 months of
1963 the number of production Workers declined to
24,600. On the other hand, car and truck output was
354,409 units in 1956 compared to 433,520 units in
1963; an increase of 22.4% in unit output.

Electrical productivity Went up 80% during the
period of 1949 to 1959 while employment rose by only
40%. Household appliances went up by 54% while
employment rose by only 19%.

In mining, output increased by 102.3% in the 10-
year period but employment increased by only 5.1%.

In public utilities output increased by 128% but
employment increased by only 26%.

In total industrial production during the 10-year
period of 1953 to 1962, production rose by 44.5%
while employment during that same period rose by
only 7.3%.

In manufacturing, output rose by over 30% while
employment failed to rise at all!

Within manufacturing, output of durable goods
(automobiles, appliances, etc.) rose by 23.5% while
employment fell 5.6%!

A further illustration of the effects of mechaniza-
tion and technological change can be seen in the
decline in the number of blue collar workers in rela-
tion to the total number of workers employed; Ac-
cording to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, white
collar employment increased by 736,000 or 39% from
1953 to 1962 while blue-collar employment increased
by only 445,000 or 18% during that same period.
Production workers ﬁlled 57 out of every 100 jobs in
1953 but only 53 of every 100 jobs in 1962.

This trend is likely to continue in the foreseeable
future and in fact will be accelerated as a result of
automation.

'Apart from anything else these ﬁgures give the lie
to those employers and their press who complain
about the low productivity of workers.

But what these ﬁgures make evident is that in-
creased productivity based on mechanization has not
brought about a comparable increase in the labor
force.

How true this is, is to be seen in the fact that em-
ployment opportunities do not keep pace with a
growing labor force. The total civilian labor force
grew by 826,000 between 1956 and 1962 but employ-
ment increased by only 632,000 during that -same
period. .
. Thus, for every four workers added to the labo

7

V

   

force only three new jobs were available during that
same period. -

This brings us back again to the question: if me-
chanization leads to displacement of workers from
their job, what will automation do?

There are differences of opinion on that score.

In some quarters it is being argued that there is
no cause to be unduly alarmed over automation, that
it will bring new industry into being, create new oc-
cupations and therefore new opportunities for employ-
ment, particularly in the service industries which have
expanded in the recent period.

The Scope of the Problem

Before examining that point of view, how far is
Canada on the road to automation?

It is reported that as of March of this year, 538
computer systems were in operation in Canada —
almost double the number which operated as -of
January 1, 1962. These computers were mainly to
be found in oflices such as insurance companies, in
banks and other ﬁnancial institutions, in Govern-
ment institutions and manufacturing oﬂices.

The ﬁrst impact of automation has thus been on
clerical workers. However one should not conclude
that this is the area automation will mainly affect.

It is anticipated that within the next two years
industry will go over to various forms of automation
or production controls on a fairly wide scale. Many
of the big corporations have already prepared the
blueprints for such “conversions” and in any case
have begun preliminary work in that direction.

Many of the technological improvements in in-
dustry in the recent period are actually part of this
process, awaiting the ﬁnal touches to ﬁt the jig-saw
pieces into place.

At the present time’ we are confronted with creep-
8

 

 

ing automation. Tomorrow we may be faced with
galloping automation. .

What may slow up that process is U.S. control
over many segments of the Canadian economy, par-
ticularly manufacturing and primary industry. Those
industries centred in the U.S.A. may ﬁnd it more
profitable to close their plants in Canada and use
their automated plants’ in the U.S.A. to pour goods
into this country. This dangerous possibility needs
to be very much borne in mind.

On the other hand for industry in Canada not to
automate while automation proceeds in other coun-
tries, means economic suicide. As Mr. W. C. New-
burg, President of the Chrysler-Dodge Division de-
clared: “automate or die.” To which an electrical
manufacturer added: “if you don’t automate, your
competitor will.”

Automation is therefore likely to proceed in Can-

ada at an accelerated pace over the next decade or
so. .
. There is already enough evidence to show that
uncontrolled automation will result in mass displace-
ment of workers from industry. Machines, not men,
will regulate and control machines with perhaps a
small number of highly skilled workers needed to
push buttons or dials in a control room, and with
an equally small number of highly skilled workers
to install the machines, to service, maintain and
repair them.

Automation may not just hit a section of a plant
or industry. It may affect entire plants or an industry.

Entire skills and occupations may become ob-
solete. Not only the unskilled and semi-skilled will
be affected. Skilled workers too, will feel its effects.
Evidence of this is to be seen in the multi-purpose
computer installed in the three daily papers in To-
ronto. Thus a substantial portion of the labor force
may face prolonged or permanent unemployment.
