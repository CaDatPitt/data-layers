Brainwashing, or the socialization of women to
see themselves as adjuncts to men, begins very early
in life. In childhood a girl learns to be delicate,
pretty and dependent - and leave rough play to boys.
Those girls who are active, aggressive and self—reli-
ant are stereotyped as "Tom Boys” and are thus taught
that this is no way for little girls to conduct them-
selves. Thereafter, we are programmed to believe that

‘we cannot be financially independent or productive and

 

creative in the world outside the home.

we are given dolls and toy kitchens for presents
while our brothers get fire trucks and chemistry sets.
we are expected to help around the house while boys
are free to go out to play. In our families and
communities young men are discouraged from getting

 

married until they get an education and a decent job,

but people ask young women in their late teens and
early 20s, “when are you going to get married?" while
those who are married and don't have children are
asked in a tone of amazement, “what, don't you have
any children yet?"

within our educational institutions there are an.

overwhelming number of women kindergarten and elemen-
tary grade school teachers, while men occupy positions
of authority as department heads, principals or col-
lege professors. The reason given for relegating us
to such underling roles, even when we have the same
educational background as men, is that school children
need a mother image. Or it is assumed that we are so
emotional that we cannot handle jobs requiring us to
make important decisions. As a result, we are under-
developed in the area of social decision—making.

Today over 30 million women are working outside
the home, making up about 40% of the work force. Five
and a half million U.S. households are dependent upon
women for their sole support. Yet in the world of
work, which is dominated by male employers, women are
relegated to the lowest paid and most menial jobs,
as salesgirls, clerks, waitresses, receptionists or
assemblers in small shops and factories. The average
income of full-time female employees is about 60% of

 

 

the average income of males. we are also the first
to be laid off by employers who regard us as a con-
venient labor pool to be hired and fired in accor-
dance with the needs of capitalist expansion and

contraction.

In the sphere of medicine, doctors - who are
usually men - regard us as too ignorant to understand
or make decisions about our own bodies. Instead of
talking to us like adults, they ask us to bring our
husbands so that they can explain things to them. If
we become pregnant and seek a legal or illegal abor-
tion, there is massive red tape we must endure.
Should we decide that our childbearing days are over
and seek to have a tubal ligation performed, we dis-
cover that there are laws in some states requiring
ourhusband'sconsent - even when we are separated
from our husbands. But if a man decides to have a

vasectomy performed, his is the only consent required.

The idea of women in inferior roles is so deeply
imbedded in our society that it is taken for granted
that we should serve men. If we work in an office,
we are expected to prepare and serve coffee for the

‘boss. Our job is always to sit quietly and take

notes while the men discuss and decide important
questions. In the home every kind of domestic work
is regarded as women's work. The rationale for this
is that the man has been out all day doing the im-
portant work so that the least we can do is have a
hot meal prepared for him, keep the house clean and
the children quiet. Most men consider it beneath
their dignity to wash dishes, do laundry or change
diapers. Believing in male supremacy, they do not
pitch in or show any appreciation for the endless
work of a mother in raising children and keeping
house: or if they do "help" they make a great show
of it and expect to be rewarded. Men can get tired
but they can't imagine a woman getting tired. They
walk away from the chaos that every household gets
into periodically because they do not consider house-
hold problems as their responsibility. A man will
call a woman all the way from the other end of the
house to change the baby's diaper or shut off the gas

 
 

under an over-boiling pot because the idea that this
is woman's work has become so entrenched in his mind.

If we go to work in order to help pay the mount-
ing expenses of our households, we usually find our-
selves doing two jobs. In order to evade their share
of household responsibilities, most men will complain
as soon as they hit the door of a headache or the
difficult day they had at work. On the other hand,
if we raise the question of the need for a fairer
division of work around the house, we are accused of
"nagging" or "bitching" - the terms which men usually
hurl at us when they want to evade criticism of sex-
ist behavior on their part.

 

 

Because many men believe that it is a woman's
duty to stay at home, they will keep them pregnant
in order to keep them there. If we express a desire
to become involved in outside activities, our mates
will object with such helpless remarks as "I need you
here to cook for me, clean the house and care for the
children." This leaves men free to run the streets
while we are left home with "our" responsibilities.

To reinforce the idea that woman's "place" is in
the home, some men will beat and threaten their wives,
leaving them nervous, timid and afraid. Added to
this is the belief that a man is by nature more
sexual than a woman and is not meant to be monogamous.
For centuries men have been using this myth to ra-
tionalize their promiscuous activities. we, of
course, are expected to accept sharing a man with
another woman - for is not half a man better than
none? But if we live an active sex life, we are
labelled automatically as "whores".

 

  

 

On the other hand, many young men expect their
wives to get out and work in order to make it possi-
ble for the man to complete his education. She,
naturally, is expected to postpone her education so
that he can complete law or medical school. After

his graduation, she is now rewarded with the announce-
ment that "we" can now startka family - conveniently
forgetting any earlier plans or agreement for the
woman to go back to school. In many cases when the
husband has completed his education, he will leave his
wife, justifying his behavior by the argument that she
is no longer on his level of intellectual development.
when this happens, the sympathy of friends and family
is usually with the husband. while the woman is blamed
for not having kept up intellectually.

we are also expected to re-arrange our lives

around the jobs of our husbands. If he is promoted,
transferred or moves to another city seeking personal
fulfillment, we are expected to follow without ques-
tion or objection. we are the ones who have to dis-
continue our social activities, leave our relatives
and friends behind or quit our jobs and start anew.
If any questions or objections are raised by us, they

are totally ignored.

Not only at home but at social and political
gatherings where decisions are being made, our opin-
ions are usually regarded as having little or no value.
On these occasions, since we are rarely out of the
house, we may be a bit hesitant to speak. Then when
we get up the courage to speak or join in the dis-
cussion, we are made to look stupid if we say some-
thing that may be somewhat incorrect.

If we are firm and forceful in stating our views,
we run the risk of being called “a bitch" or "a
troublemaker" while if a man expresses himself with
equal firmness and forcefulness, there is a good
chance that he will be considered "a leader". Further-
more, to enhance our husband's or friend's image, we
are expected to agree with everything he says in
public. If we have ideas of our own, we are expected
to feed them to our mates (or bosses) in private so

 

 

 

that they can then get the credit. Men paternalize
and treat us like little girls, call us "Baby" (as
whites used to call blacks "Boy") no matter what our
age. It is taken for granted that a man may say
derogatory things about his wife or girl friend in
public; but if we say the same kind of things about
him publicly, it is regarded as a betrayal. To make
our point, we must often raise our voices and then we
are criticized for being "too emotional". The issue
then becomes not what we said but how we said it.
Even in private, any criticism or disagreement is
ignored or evokes such hostility from their mates that
many women end up by just keeping their mouths shut.
After years of resenting but quietly accepting this
kind of abuse, many women become cynical and find
various (and often very destructive) ways of getting
back at men.

As if degradation on a personal level were not
enough, we find ourselves constantly portrayed in the
mass media as dumb, helpless and dependent. TV com-
mercials, produced to appeal to women, are composed of
words and scenes that undermine and belittle our
intelligence. Men, of course, are portrayed in author-
ity—type roles - advising and instructing - while we
are portrayed as domestic slaves or supplicants for
male approval. Mr. Clean, for example, is the big,
strong hero who has a woman hanging all over him or
looking up at him from the floor which she is scrub-
bing on her knees. In the "ring-around—the-collar"
commercial, the woman is made to feel guilty because
she hasn't done a good job of cleaning her husband's
shirt collar. Then, too, there are the daily soap
operas which encourage us to identify with the charac-
ters whose lives are centered around problems with
men rather than with struggles to develop our own
identity. .

Because we have been taught to believe that get-
ting a man is our main reason for existence, we tend
to be jealous and suspicious of one another, viewing
other women as rivals or potential threats to our
getting or holding a man. Many women devote their
entire lives to the "game" of getting a man. As part
of this obsession. thev wear clothes which leave

7

 

  

  

little to the imagination. wigs, false eyelashes,
bust builders, padded hips, cosmetics and perfumes
are worn so that a woman will stand out from her
competitors. This competition among women for the
favors of men often takes more subtle forms. For
example, many women begin feeling uneasy if their
husbands or men friends engage in animated discussion

with another woman and become very hostile to the
woman. At work it is far easier to get women workers
together to throw a birthday party for the boss than
it is to unite them around a struggle for higher wages
or better working conditions for themselves. If women
are talking together and a man enters the room, they
immediately feel self-conscious about their appearance
and/or begin addressing their remarks to the man.

All of this makes an enormous impression on
children as they are growing up and begins to exercise
a decisive influence as they reach their teens and
become more aware of their biological differences.
Because they have been socialized to believe that men
should take and women should give, young boys think
only of "scoring" with girls and will knock up their
girl friends or complete strangers without any thought
of the girl's future or the future of the child. As
our society has begun to fall apart in the last few
years, this sexist attitude toward women has led to more
and more rapes by young men, individually and in gangs.

Because having a husband and children is consi-
dered the ideal role for a woman, many young women
will have a baby by a man, hoping to get him that way,
even when they know that the man involved will not be
a responsible father to the child. Often a woman
recognizes that she cannot hold the man, but she will
settle for a part of him in a child. This can lead
to a life on welfare or ADC. Young women who have
been trapped into this kind of life are usually much
alone. Therefore they can become the prey of "suave"
or ”Superfly" guys who persuade them to give up their
welfare checks or even to prostitute for them. Not
only women on welfare but even many women who work
are today ready to accept all kinds of indignities
from a man for fear of being without a man and losing
the only "enjoyment" in their lives which is to be
flattered by a man.

 

 

re

Men take advantage of these women because they
have been raised by a sexist society to believe that
they should be boss. Thus the idea of women being
only adjuncts to men has led in our day to the most
degrading and exploitative relations between men and
women. V

These relations do not exist because it is the
biological nature of men to exploit women or the
biological nature of women to be exploited by men,
The subordination of women to men is a social rela-
tionship which has developed historically over thou-
sands of years. These relations have been created by
human beings and can be changed by human beings.

CHAPTER II
THE OLDEST OPPRESSION

Male domination did not just begin yesterday.

Nor is it limited to a particular class, race or na-
tion. Long before class or race or nationality
differences developed, there were prescribed roles for
women and men. From the very beginning female and male
unity was necessary to reproduce the human species.
Each sex had to be biologically different to accom-
plish such a unity. This biological difference be-
tween women and men was and still is necessary to the
reproduction of the species. It was never the choice
of women that they could have children nor men that
they couldn't. There was no choice -- it was a
natural division.

However, unlike animals who live in nature and
react instinctively, women and men have struggled
down through the ages to change their circumstances
in order to live a more productive and satisfying
life. Thus, very early, a form of division of work or
responsibilities between women and men was established
based on their biological differences. Because women.
carried the fetus within them, because they were the
only ones able to provide the milk for the growing
infant, and because they were physically less powerful
than men, they found most of their responsibilities
centered in and around the home, while men were able
to roam further afield to hunt for animals as well as
to do some of the more strenuous physical work.

In the horticultural or food-gathering stage of
social development, the responsibilities of women
included not only the bearing and feeding of children
but also the gathering of the vegetation, fruits, and
even small animals which provided approximately 80%
of the food regularly consumed by the family and/or
community. Hunting, on the other hand, was an occa-
sional rather than a daily activity and it was, more-
over, an unreliable source of food. Thus, in this

stage, the productive contribution of women was cer-
tainly as important as that of men.

11

Moreover, because of their responsibilities in
gathering and preparing food and in taking care of the
children and the household, almost all the early
inventions were certainly created by women. This
includes the products of almost every important craft:
pottery, basketry, spinning and weaving, housebuilding,
medicine and the equipment for tending babies. Almost
everything except killing animals, fighting other men
and boatbuilding seems to have been done by women.
There is no question that women invented horticulture
and agriculture.

However, as time passed, men enlarged upon their
hunting abilities to the point of developing weapons
which could not only fight off wild animals but also
make war on other men. Because of their new power as
protectors and aggressors, men began to exercise
political power outside the home. At the same time
the art of metallurgy was developed, requiring full-
time workers and more advanced equipment than that
available in the home. Men became the craftsmen in
this work because women were occupied with the pro-
ductive work of the household.

12

This new stage of technology laid the basis for
a separation between the productive work of the house-
hold (which was now looked down on as domestic work)
and the productive work outside the home or in the
workshop. Because there was more room for specializa-
tion and expansion in productive activities outside
the home and because men now had political power or
the power to make decisions for the society and in the
home, women began to be regarded as the inferior and
passive sex.

The biological division of roles between men and
women was established maybe a million years ago, while
the relation of male domination did not become en-
trenched until the rise of the state about five thou-
sand years ago. The reason it has not been challenged
sooner is that it has taken all those years to develop

the technology which has made it possible for men and
women to share much more equally in every sphere.

In the United States up until world war II, women
and men had very little choice as to how they should
relate to one another. Our grandmothers, and even our
mothers, were not confronted with questions about
their identity. ‘Their lives were still governed, for
the most part, by the natural division of labor be-
tween women who bore and nursed the children and did
the work which went along with being around the house,
while the men went out and did the more strenuous
productive work in the fields and factories.

In this country women and men were tied together
in the individual household by the necessities of
survival both for the individual and for the species.
Until very recently a great deal of the productive
life of America took place around the individual
household. During the agricultural era practically
all the family's needs were supplied by its members.
As late as world war II, the work of housewives in
the cities differed in degree rather than in kind from
that of women on the farm. Except in the crowded
tenement districts of the big cities (where a rela-
tively small fraction of the population lived), many
families kept chickens or rabbits and raised many of

13

 

  

  

their own fruits and vegetables. The livelihood of
most working class and middle class families was as
dependent on that of the woman at home as on that of
the man who went out to work. Most purchased foods
were bought in their natural, unprocessed, uncanned
and unpackaged state. Hence the preparation of the
average meal required both time and artistry. Few
homes were without a sewing machine (one of the first
items widely sold on the installment plan) for making
and mending clothes, sheets, towels, curtains and a
whole host of household needs.

Childbearing was more necessary then to the
continuation of the human race, due to the fact that
many children died in infancy for lack of medical and
health facilities. women, therefore, had to spend
their most productive years bearing children in order

to provide the large families needed to do the chores
around the house, work in the fields and factories and
take care of parents in their old age (since Social
Security did not exist). From the very beginning this
country has constantly needed more "hands". Hence the
importation of indentured servants, black slaves and
immigrants from Europe and Asia. The idea that the
need for labor power would decline as a result of
machines taking the place of human labor did not begin
to haunt American society until the Depression of the
1930s.

Responsibility for the rearing of children was
also centered in the individual household and the
family which often included several generations. The
family's responsibility was clearly understood to
include not only training in productive skills but the
inculcation of the fundamental human values necessary
to any society, such as the sharing of responsibility
for tasks as well as for maintaining harmony, the
sharing of facilities and goods as well as pleasures,
the care of younger children by older ones and of the
old folks by the young. Parents sent their kids to
school in order to learn the 3 R's, but they accepted
responsibility for raising the children they bore.

The welfare state and a growing number of institutions
and experts that have taken over the responsibility of
supporting and raising children had not been invented.

14

 

 

Continuous child-bearing and child-raising meant
that it was necessary for women to concentrate their
tasks in and around the house where they practically
managed a workshop. But because the outside work of
men was closer to the house than it is today, the

. responsibility for child-raising was not left complete-
, ly to the woman.

Farm women often worked in the fields, taking
their infants with them, carrying them on their backs
or laying them under a tree. The life of black women
on the Southern farm was extremely demanding because,
in addition to working around the house and in the
fields, they often had to work for the white lady,
beginning at an early age. But while they envied the
the white lady's leisure and finery, black women also

i had a very powerful sense of their own human dignity,
l looking down on the white lady as a parasite and
pampered doll.

Not only was the work of women in the house
closely connected and continuous with that of men but
it was not isolated from that of other women. when
several generations lived under the same roof, the
young mother could learn from other women, feel their
support, and count on their help in raising and caring
for her children. The presence of grandparents and
in-laws in the house created contradictions and ten-
sions, but it was also a source of help. On the farms
or in the ethnic communities of the cities, seasonal
festivals provided occasions when women could share
not only the work but their experiences.

Before world war II the women who worked outside
the house in sweatshops and offices were usually,
"single women", most of whom looked forward to getting
married and "settling down to raise a family" after a
few years of work. Because of the obvious necessity
of the family and the individual household as a pro-
ductive, child-bearing and child-raising unit, getting
married and raising a family was not only a matter of
personal satisfaction; it meant that you were making
a contribution to society. Sometimes it was also a
way to "better yourself" in accordance with the
American tradition, since it was not unusual for a
woman from a poor family to marry a man from a higher
social bracket.

Because of the socially necessary role which
women played in child-bearing, child-raising and the
productive work of the household, our foremothers
were not only a companion to their men but also
exercised a great deal of influence on men and,
through men, on society. But the power of women
remained "behind the scenes”. They were willing for
men to be the decision-makers in the public arena not
only because they saw their main‘contribution in terms
of the domestic sphere but also because, like most
Americans, they did not see politics as important.
Hence most women saw no reason to become involved in
the women's suffrage movement. Preoccupied with their
role in the domestic sphere, they did not realize that
by leaving the responsibilities in the public arena to
men, they were encouraging men to regard them as
inferior and also limiting their own development.

16

 

 

Only at times of grave social crisis were a few
exceptional women drawn into the public arena. Thus,
in the period prior to the first American Revolution,
Mercy Otis warren and Abigail Adams participated in
the ideological struggles leading to the declaration
of independence from Britain. In the pre-Civil war
period women like Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth,

’ Sarah and Angela Grimke, were cornerstones of the anti-
slavery movement. Because women had for so long been
confined to the domestic sphere, these women had to
overcome the prejudices not only of the average male
and female but even of the male leaders of the
Abolitionist Movement. Only a few individuals like
Wendell Phillips had a sufficiently enlarged vision
of human capacities to support the participation of
women in every activity of the outside world as the
prerequisite to their developing themselves as full
human beings.

It is only with world war II that the lives of
American women, like the lives of every American,
a began to undergo drastic changes. During world war II,
A millions of women were needed in the factories and in
the armed services. So women discovered what it was

  

 

like to work as equals to men, to travel freely about
the country and to have their own incomes. However,
as soon as the war was over, most of these women were
laid off and soon found themselves back in their old
roles as housewives and a labor pool from which
industry could hire and fire as it expanded and
contracted. ‘

Meanwhile, due chiefly to the technological ex-
plosion during world war II, tremendous changes have
been taking place which have had a more profound and
intimate effect upon women than on any other section
of the population. Because large families are no
longer needed to provide labor power for production
and because many more infants survive, we no longer
need to spend so many years of our lives in child-
bearing. Because contraception is so easily available,
sexuality can be separated from child-bearing and
child-bearing can be planned. Because so many of the
goods used in the home can be purchased in the market
place, we no longer need to spend so much time in pre-
paring food and making things for the house and family.
Because so little of the productive work of society is
now done in the individual household, we no longer
have so much responsibility for coordinating the
activities of the household and training our children
in the skills and disciplined habits which were nec-
essary to these activities. As a result, the job of
training and educating our children has been increas-
ingly turned over to the schools.

At the same time, advancing technology has made
obsolete the old divisions of labor between males and
females on the basis of physical strength, in the
household and in the work world outside the home.

Most work involves pushing buttons. Hunting involves
going to the grocery store and getting one's purchases
packed into a paper bag that can be carried by anyone.
Housekeeping is wash-and-no-iron clothes, electric and
disposable everything. Babies drink out of collapsible
bottles that can be held by anyone; their diapers can
be changed and thrown into the automatic washing ma-
chines by a man as well as a woman. Protection is as
near as a phone, a gun or a martial arts school that
can provide both men and women with the skills neces-
sary for individual self-defense.

18

 

 

Under these circumstances women can do practically
any job that men are now employed to do. Yet industry
uses the same old excuse of women's physical differ-
ences to maintain women as an unemployed labor pool.
The result is that millions of women live on ADC or
welfare, subject to the red tape and never—ending
investigation of social workers and with no opportun-
ity to make a productive contribution to the economy.
Men can also do practically any job around except
bear a child. Yet child care and housework is still
regarded as woman's work.

At the same time, as the population has become
increasingly mobile, the nuclear family, consisting of
an adult male, adult female and minor children, or an
adult female and her children, has taken the place of
the extended household rooted in the community. Mil-
lions of young mothers are alone with their children
all day, either because fathers are out at work -
usually a long drive from the house - or because they
are divorced or separated from the father of their
children. In the big city or in new suburbs these
young mothers usually have no one to help out in
emergencies or when the baby or mother is sick, to
hold the babies or to give advice on how to raise them,
and to provide other adult models for growing children
besides the mother and father.

Freed from old responsibilities which were demand-
ing but also satisfying, liberated from old relation-
ships which were sources of tension but also supportive,
women since world war II in the United States have be-
come increasingly insecure and uncertain of their role.
The great need of American women for the last thirty
years has been to enlarge our concept of what it means
to be a human being in the modern world in order to
guide us in struggles for the profound changes now
required in all our relations and all our institutions
to correspond with the tremendous changes which have
taken place in technology. In the absence of these
new enlarged concepts of human identity, we have be-
come vulnerable to the propaganda of industry which,
in order to create a expanding market for its products,
has created a new role for women, the role of "sex
object” and "happy housewife”. Day in and day out.

19

 

  

 

we are told on TV, in books, magazines and newspapers,
that the main reason for our existence is to please
men, by exciting them sexually and/or eliminating
from their lives any irritations such as rings around
their collars or around the toilet bowl. At the same
time, as the pressures of the outside world have in-
creased, men themselves have begun to demand more and
more that we turn the home into an asylum or refuge
from their alienating relationships outside the home.

In addition to performing "our" household tasks as
efficiently and inconspicuously as the perfect servant,
we are expected to be as glamorous and exciting as
"call girls".

The exploitation of women as sex objects in the
United States today is far more degrading and destruc-
tive than any form of woman's oppression in the past.
In past societies only a very small number of women
were kept for the pleasures of sheiks and monarchs.

The great majority of women were limited to certain
roles connected with child-bearing and housework but
they could derive security and satisfaction from these
roles because they were clearly productive and socially
necessary.

Today, however, more and more women of all clas-
ses and ethnic groups in the United States exist and
see their existence solely as instruments for the
pleasure of men. They are constantly badgered with
unrealistic images of the perfect sex object - which
they can't possibly live up to. Even when they do
succeed at living up to these images, they find them
quickly replaced by others which they must then try
to meet. As a result of this meaningless and deadend
existence, many women spend frustrating lives, con-
vinced that they are in fact inferior to men. They
drift from man to man, ready to do anything he asks
as long as he shows them some affection. Thus hun-
dreds and thousands of women, and especially young
women, are being physically and emotionally crippled
before they have had any chance to explore and develop
their own potential as creative human beings.

without any sense of purpose for their own lives,
many women seek "instant identity" through identifi-

20

 

 

 

cation with an outstanding male (a rock or sports star
or a business or political leader), or through sex or
the bearing of a child for a man, giving little if

any thought to the needs and future of the child, of

.themselves or the responsibilities of the father.
“Males exploit this vulnerability, usually unthinkingly

for their momentary pleasure or to build their egos,

Abut in all too many cases, with the conscious goal of

living off these women, either by putting them out

on the streets as hustlers, picking up their welfare
checks on "Mothers Day" or, like Charlie Manson,
using them to revenge himself on the world. Thus the
degradation of women to sex objects is threatening
our entire society with disintegration.

CHAPTER III

THE WOMEN'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT

At critical junctures in human development, a
book, an article or a speech can sometimes initiate a
new era because it raises fundamental questions which
have been simmering beneath the surface of society
but which no one has had the insight or courage to
pose so sharply that they can no longer be evaded.
The Feminine Mystique published in 1963, was such a

 

book. In it Betty Friedan, herself a wife and mother
of three small children, revealed to American women
that the strange stirring, the dissatisfaction, the
emptiness which each was feeling was shared by millions
of others who also wanted "something more than my hus-
band and my children and my home.” She called this
"strange new problem” which American women were strug-
gling to define, "the problem which has no name" be-'
cause it has never been faced by human beings before
and "cannot be understood in terms of the age—old
material problems of man: poverty, sickness, hunger,
cold.” Nor can it be solved by acquiring more things
since it stems, in fact, from the contradiction that
American women have luxuries undreamed of by women in
other times and in other lands but still do not have
what every human being needs: a sense of purpose and
the conviction that what one is doing is worthy of
oneself as a full human being and is also valued by
others.

Friedan also exposed the new strategy, "the femi-
nine mystique", which has been consciously and deli-
berately developed by American industry since world
war II. American manufacturers, she explained, have
been selling American women the role of sex object
and happy housewife because they need an expanding
market for the millions of new appliances, multi-
colored detergents and ever—shining floor waxes that
are rolling off modern assembly lines. women's maga-
zines, aided and abetted by a new breed of social

scientists and experts, have been cooperating in this
dehumanization and exploitation of women by creating
anxieties in women about their sexual performance and
their homemaking and mothering skills - when what wo-
men really need is to become full human beings, making
the contributions in the world of work and in the world
of politics which they are as capable of making as men
are. And American women have not been able to defend
themselves against this attack on their humanity be-
cause they have not created a new concept of their
human identity to replace the old concept of female
identity which has been eroded by modern technology.

The Feminine Mystique was the first major work by
a member of an oppressed group in post-war America to
analyze the new human or non-economic contradictions
which had been created by the new stage of technology.
The book concluded by projecting a vision of the "new
stage of human evolution” which could begin with women
exercising their capacities as full human beings.

"who knows what women can be when they are final-
ly free to become themselves? who knows what woman's
intelligence will contribute when it can be nourished
without denying love? who knows of the possibilities
of love when men and women share not only children,
home and garden, not only the fulfillment of their
biological roles, but the responsibilities and
passions of the work that creates the human future and
the full human knowledge of who they are? It has
barely begun, the search of women for themselves. But
the time is at hand when the voices of the feminine
mystique can no longer drown out the inner voice that
is driving women to become complete.”

The Feminine Mystique was widely read in the
United States and all over the world and influenced
countless individual women. But it was not until the
late 1960s, in the wake of the black and anti-war move-
ments, that the struggle for women's liberation began
to take shape as a movement.

In the 19605 the black movement, which originated
with the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, drew increasing

23

  

 

numbers of blacks into ever—expanding and ever-deepening
struggles over the issue of racism in the United States.
As blacks began to stand up and proclaim their right to
be treated as human beings, they opened up the perspec-
tive of a more humane society for everyone if blacks
were freed from racist domination. white youth and
liberals joined in the movement, inspired by the just-
ness of the black cause and the opportunity to redeem
America from the shame of racism.

Starting with the belief that the problems of
blacks could be resolved by incorporation into Ameri-
can society, blacks at first struggled only for their
civil rights, i.e., the right to eat, sit, sleep and
drink in the same places as whites and go to the polls
to vote on an equal basis with whites.

But as the movement expanded, blacks began to
challenge every institution of American society -
schools, churches, factories, housing, the armed
forces, sports, the media, even prisons - making clear
that all these institutions were built upon racism or
the subordination of blacks.

More and more blacks, and especially young blacks
in the Northern cities, began to rise in rebellion
against racism. They began to call for "Black Power",
raising the question of revolution in the United States
as it had not been raised in 200 years.

At the same time, as the United States stepped up
its genocidal war against the Vietnamese people, the
movement against the war began on university campuses,
spreading quickly into the rest.of society. Young men
burned their draft cards, went to prison as conscien-
tious objectors or fled to Canada; women and men re-
fused to allow their sons to be drafted; university
professors staged anti-war teach-ins; churches offered
asylum to draft resisters. Hundreds of thousands
marched again and again on Washington until President
Johnson, in effect, was driven from the white House.

Together, the black and the anti-war movements
created a new revolutionary climate in the United.

24

 

 

States which enabled American women to struggle against
male domination as not only a woman's problem but as
part of the general "Movement" against the contradic-
tions, corruption, exploitation and dehumanization of
American society.

The black challenge to racism in all American
institutions and the youth movement against the Vietnam
war had revealed that those responsible for the leader-
ship of American society (mostly males) were not only
corrupt but also incompetent and confused. Because
of the "Movement", old established customs and values
which had formerly governed the relations between the
races and the generations were no longer automatically
accepted. People found themselves questioning what
should be their course of action in what had once been
routine situations. No longer sure of what we should
do or where we belonged, millions of Americans began
to search for radical solutions.

However, women inside the "Movement" discovered

_ that, despite the challenge which male activists were

putting up to old relations between the classes, races
and generations, and despite the fact that women were
equally militant and courageous in fighting against
racism and the Vietnam war, male-female relationships
were essentially the same as those in the rest of the
society. Male militants still expected their female
comrades to make coffee and sandwiches and type the
papers and leaflets while the men made the big deci-
sions and the big speeches. "Movement" men were just
as hostile to criticism and as reluctant to criticize
themselves as men outside. They also used women to
build their egos, flattering and wooing them in order
to create divisions and rivalries, especially between
black and white women. Moreover, many "Movement" women
went along with these male chauvinist practices, curry-
ing favor with "Movement" stars by providing them with
special foods or bright ideas, protecting their image
as leaders in public and disagreeing with them only in
private. As early as 1964 a black woman, Ruby D.
Robinson, had written a paper on the woman's role in
SNCC, only to be laughed at by the men. "The only
position for a woman is prone", said Stokely Carmichael.

At the 1966 SDS convention the woman who asked that
a position on women's equality be inserted in the
resolutions was rudely tossed out of the convention.
That fired up the women activists to form a women's
caucus. From this point onward the women's movement
began to mushroom.

when the women's liberation movement began, it
was composed primarily of white women. This was be-
cause in the late 1960s the black movement was
exploding throughout the United States. During the
black rebellions of 1967-68 and for several years
thereafter, black women saw the liberation of black
people as their primary goal. Feeling pride in our
black identity after centuries of white domination,
greeting one another as brother and sister and with
the “Black Power” handshake or the clenched fist,
wearing our "afros" and our dashikis, we were sus-
picious of whites and anyone who associated with
whites. Struggling for community control of schools
and of all institutions in the black community, for
more black students and black studies in the universi-
ties, for black police commissioners and black mayors
in the cities, we had no time for the struggle against
sexism. Only with the passage of time and the many
experiences which time made possible, would we dis-
cover that there are as many political differences
among blacks as among whites and that liberation is
impossible without an American revolution that will
eliminate all forms of domination within our society.

Thus the women's movement began with primarily
young, white, single women from middle class homes.
These women could identify with the oppression of
black people more easily than white males because
they knew how it felt to be told “shut up” or take a
back seat, accept segregation and exclusion from
clubs, lower our sights to work "realistically" at
the tasks open to us, deal with imputations of
natural inferiority, and see ourselves portrayed in
books, newspapers and pictures as stereotypes rather
than as individuals or as human beings.

Taking our cue from the black struggle as the

26

 

 

 

women's movement in the United States has done tra-
ditionally, we began by affirming our identity as
human beings and emphasizing the liberation of both
men and women that would come from replacing male
domination with the equality of the sexes. Following
the example of the black and anti-war movements, we
staged demonstrations that would catch the eye of the
mass media, burning bras, disrupting beauty contests,
picketing "Gentlemen Only" bars and clubs.

At first most working class women, black and
white, could not understand what women in the movement
wanted. After all, these women had everything that
the average American woman dreams of. They did not
have to work but could sit at home all day and live
luxuriously. what more did they want? working class
women, holding down two jobs - one inside the home and
one outside — looked forward to the time when they
could quit working and live that dream. They simply
could not see what these women were complaining about.
That the pedestal was in fact a cage could only be
discovered by those on the pedestal.

However, as the women's movement began to raise
more fundamental and concrete issues - such as the
ignorance in which we are kept of our own bodies,
the menial jobs to which we are relegated, the danger
of rape with which we are increasingly faced - American
women of every class, race and age could identify with
its goals. Incorporating women from every walk of life,
the women's movement began to grow.

All over the country women began to come together,
separating ourselves off so that we could discuss what
was missing in our lives and why we were so miserable,
even though so many of us had achieved the material
things which make up the "American Dream.” Small groups
organized "consciousness-raising" sessions to discuss
our most intimate experiences in our families and with
our husbands and men friends. At these sessions we
began to see that all the incidents and slights which
made up so much of the lives of each of us were no
mere mistakes. The pieces were beginning to fall into
place. /lpatternof sexism was emerging that was as

27

 

     
    

clear and as pervasive as that of racism and imperialism.

These consciousness—raising sessions were a chal-
lenge because they meant that we had to take a good
look at ourselves and recognize how we had been accom-
plices in our own subordination. Like every oppressed
group, we had to fight against our fears that standing
up against accepted relationships would mean losing
our men, our children, our jobs and the life styles to
which we had become accustomed. But in the course of
our struggles against these fears, we began to realize
that we had come together out of choice and out of our
own deep-seated need to search for our own "souls".
Instead of losing control over our lives by struggling
against our oppression, we were really beginning to
create a new human identity for ourselves.

we began to discuss what it is like to grow up in‘
this society as a female, the problems we face as
women in relation to our work, our schooling, our
families and our mates. At first we hesitated to re-
veal our problems to other women because we saw these

28

 

as our own personal business or as private matters
that should not be discussed in public. Each of us
feared that we would be ridiculed, rejected, misunder-
stood or gossiped about by others. However, as we
struggled to open up to one another and to discuss

our individual problems, we found that we shared
essentially the same or similar problems. It was as
if we had all lived in practically the same house, the
same community, worked on the same job, related to the
same mate.

we discovered that as women we had been condi-
tioned, from the time we were old enough to under-
stand, to compete for the "Big Prize": a man. Through
this competition we had been led into distrusting and
disliking each other for very small and petty reasons.
we began to expose how we had been brought up in the
society to seek ultimate happiness through a man; how
we were supposed to dress and act as men would want
us to dress and act; how we were not considered smart
enough to become involved in politics or in making
decisions in relation to the course of our society;

how we had been socialized to believe that we had been
put on earth for the sole purpose of bearing children
and being a nursemaid to our children and husbands -
in short, making everything pleasant for everyone

else but ourselves.

In looking at ourselves and at each other, we
discovered how we had helped to build our own prisons;
how we saw women in the traditional role of being
passive, a beautiful object to be admired and desired
by men; a mother and/or wife exclusively. we too had
perpetuated male chauvinism by the mere fact that we
had not struggled against it. we too had never ex-
pected men to adjust their lives to parenthood or to
take on the responsibility or even consider the
problem of birth control. we had never expected men
to cook, clean, wash or iron because we too had
accepted these as "woman's work." worst of all, we
did not take good care of our own bodies! How many
times have we neglected our own health because we had
been conditioned to believe that our children came
first, our husband or mate second, and ourselves last?

we also began to realize how even emancipated wo-
men embody the sexist values of competitiveness and
individualism which we criticized in men._

In looking at ourselves, we became very angry
because we realized that we had internalized the
institutionalized values of a woman's "place." we
began to look at our weaknesses and our strengths
and, from there, began to set goals for ourselves as
to what we wanted to achieve. Chief among these
goals was self-reliance.

In order to become more self—reliant, we began
to break away from traditional roles and to develop
ourselves in those fields which had been dominated
by men and which women had been forbidden to enter.
we began to see and feel ourselves becoming more
human human beings as we began to contribute to
society and do things for ourselves collectively that
we had previously seen as things that only men could
do.

we began to write magazines, pamphlets and books
in order to help educate those women who did not have
our understanding. Classes were conducted in self-
defense, auto mechanics, and health. we began to read
and study our bodies in terms of what kinds of food we
should eat, what kinds of exercises we should do to
keep physically fit and what happens to our bodies in
the course of menstruation, child-bearing, abortion
and menopause. As we began to explore the contributions
that women have made to civilization, we saw the need
to substitute the phrase "Man/womankind” or ”Humankind"
for the word "Mankind" with its male chauvinist over-
tones. And we began to develop theoretically, study-
ing and analyzing the history of societies in terms
of human relations rather than within the traditional
economic determinist and Marxist framework of class
struggle, redistribution of wealth and property rela-
tions.

In the course of our struggles to become self-
reliant and complete human beings, we recognized that,
in order for us to achieve our goals, we must struggle
to rid the society of male chauvinism wherever it

30

 

 

exists. So we began to struggle around the issues of
equal jobs, equal pay, abortion and reform, the right
of women to enter into medical, law and engineering
schools and the skilled trades without discrimination.
As a result of these struggles, more and more women
are today being accepted into medical, law and engi-
neering schools, the skilled trades, the mass media and
many other arenas which, prior to the women's libera-
tion movement, had taken in very few or no women.
Abortion has been legalized in many states, while many
other issues in relation to women's rights are in the
process of being settled in accordance with the just
demands of the women's movement.

. The result is that today all over the United
States the traditional role of women in this society
is being turned upside down. Formerly accepted values
no longer dominate. Old established customs no longer
govern the daily relations between men and women.
Theoretical assumptions in the fields of anthropology
and sociology are being challenged. Many men feel

threatened by women who are taking on this new attitude
and practice of equality and independence both in daily
relations and in the theoretical sphere. They see
women's liberation as robbing them of their "manhood."

Many women also feel threatened by the new inde-
pendence and assertiveness of women. These women feel
that they will lose their "femininity" that they too
will have to use their minds, make political decisions,
become self—reliant, work harder and lose the oppor-
tunity to sit at home watching "Love of Life." Many
women enjoy the idea of men looking at them as sex
objects and become extremely hostile to women who be-
gin talking and acting as equals with men. "who does
she think she is anyway?” they ask. women's liberation
is a threat to these women with a "slave mentality,“
i.e., who have become adjusted to or profit from being
treated as adjuncts to men. They feel that they have
been preparing all their lives to win in one kind of
game and suddenly the rules of the game have been
changed.

All these new ideas and activities of the women's

movement are challenges to men and women who continue
to support and perpetuate the outmoded roles of women
and men in this society. It is also a challenge to
those of us who are struggling to change and redefine
the concept of what it means to be a human being in
today's technologically-advanced society.

During the civil rights struggles in the South,
black women and young girls had played an important
role, often a more direct one than men. They not only
did a lot of the behind-the-scenes organizing; they
also gave inspiring public leadership. Rosa Parks set
off the Montgomery Bus Boycott; Daisy Bates led the
desegregation of schools struggle in Little Rock,
Arkansas; Gloria Richardson headed the movement in
Cambridge, Maryland. However, as the “Movement”
became nation-wide, black and white men began to take
over leadership. Some groups even took the position
that only black men should lead, while women, black
and white, should subordinate themselves to men. Black
Nationalists, in particular, argued that black women
should take a back seat in order to compensate for the
degradation to which black men had been subjected. As
if two wrongs could ever make a right!

Many black women were proud to see black men in

positions of leadership and, for the first time in

United States history, able to "protect our women.”

So they were ready to go along with the myth that

"black women have always been free" and that "women's .
liberation is a white middle class movement.“ g

However, as the slogans of Black Power and Black
Nationalism became more popular, the idea of women
catering to men was seized on by reactionary and
opportunistic types. Some black men began to insist
that black women walk a few steps behind them. In
the name of "Black Power,” others began persuading
young girls to have children by them - using the
"numbers" argument that the more children blacks had,
the more power we would be acquiring to deal with
white people. Meanwhile, none of the Black Power
or militant groups took a firm political position
against this unscrupulous exploitation of women. white

32

 

 

 

radicals and liberals, reluctant to criticize blacks in
any way, said nothing. By their silence and in some
cases encouragement, blacks and whites allowed the
poison of these ideas to spread.

Confronted with this deteriorating situation, the
number of black women who identify with the goals of
the women's movement has steadily increased over the
past few years. Nevertheless, some Black Nationalist
groups, for example, the Black Muslims, still advocate
the confinement of women to the home, idealizing the
past in this sphere as they do in so many others.

Some black women are also still catering to the pre-
judices of black men, allowing black men to take out
their frustrations and insecurities on us and protec-
ting black males instead of challenging them to trans-

'form themselves so that they can struggle side by side

with us against our common oppression. Some black
women have capitulated to the threat of black men to
leave them for white women if black women become too
independent. This is the thinly-veiled threat implicit
in the popular allegation that "black women are too
ornery." It is the same divide—and-rule device that
has been used by all oppressors against those whom they
oppress.

As the women's movement has expanded in popularity
and has achieved a number of reforms, it has come up
against the reality that all women do not think alike
even though they may all be for women's liberation
from male domination. whatever the organization, the
location or the ethnic composition of the group, all
the women's liberation organizations had one thing in
common; they all came together based on a biological.
and sociological fact rather than on a body of ideas.
women came together in the women's liberation movement
on the basis that we were women and all women are
subject to male domination. we saw all women as being
our allies and all men as being the oppressor. we
never questioned the extent to which American women
accept the same materialistic and individualistic val-
ues as American men. we did not stop to think that
American women are just as reluctant as American men
to struggle for a new society based on new values of
mutual respect, cooperation and social responsibility.

Meanwhile, as a result of the struggles of the
women's movement, some women who were very militant at
the outset of the movement are sitting comfortably in
a status job, including jobs as directors of women's
projects which were funded by the government or pri-
vate foundations to pacify the women's movement. For
some, writing books or lecturing on the woman's ques-
tion, including appearances on talk shows, has become
their way of making a living and a name for themselves.

 

Others, having got their grievances off their
chest, have simply dropped out of the struggle alto-
gether. Some women believed that, since women have
been kept inside the house watching the children,
cooking, cleaning, ironing and washing, it is now men's
turn to take on this role and women's turn to go out
into the world in pursuit of our individualistic wants
and greeds. Others think that, having been oppressed
for so long, the time has come for us simply to leave

34

 

 

 

our home and families, including our children and begin
to do "our own thing." Many women have adopted the
cynical attitude that men will never change, and some
have even gone so far as to advocate a "Lesbian Nation"
or test-tube babies as the solution to women's oppres-
sion. Some say, "Do it to them before they do it to
you." while others advocate "wages for Housework" -- a
proposal that takes us even further down the road of
capitalism since it brings us into the market-place and
puts a price on activities which should fulfill human
and not just economic independence for women.

Many women who are active in the women's movement
have become "Socialist Feminists." That is, they con-
tinue to organize independently around immediate women's
issues, such as child care, abortion, rape, but tack on
"Socialism" as the ultimate answer in the same abstract
way that American radicals have always done.

More and more the struggle for women's liberation
is beginning to become issue-oriented and opportunistic.
The women's movement is declining into a self-interest
movement in much the same way as the workers’ movement
declined, after the initial ferment in the 1930's, and
the black movement declined, after reaching a high point
in the rebellions of the late 1960s.

The main reason why the women's movement is in such
a state of disarray and stagnation today is that, in
our concentration on the struggle against male domina-
tion, we have come to see ourselves as struggling only
for equal rights or equality with men. This has led
us to see ourselves more and more as victims struggling
against men as villains, instead of seeing our struggle
as an integral part of the overall struggle for new,
more human relations with one another on which_all
Americans must embark, now that modern technology has
outmoded the old relations based on old divisions of
labor.

what new and enlarged concepts of human capacities
and responsibilities do all Americans need now that the
struggle against hunger and cold are not our main con-
cerns? The importance of the women's struggle is that
it enables everyone to bring this question into

35

 
 

 

sharper focus. Down through the ages, without any need
for reflection on our part, our child-bearing and child-
raising roles have given us the deep sense of social
satisfaction and human identity which comes from contri-
buting to society and to the continuing evolution of

the human species. Now that modern technology has

so profoundly affected this role, we feel in our most
intimate psychological being the emptiness and aliena-
tion of life in modern America.

But we are not the only ones whose social roles
have been drastically eroded since the end of world
war II. To keep them off the job market, young people,
black and white, are now confined in educational
institutions year after year, deprived of the opportun-
ity to engage in socially necessary productive and
community activities which would enable them to develop
their minds in a direct relationship with reality and
with other sections of the population. As a result,
vandalism and drug addiction are spreading in the
suburbs as well as in the inner city among young
people. Because modern industry has no use for them,
millions of black youth roam the streets, ending up in
juvenile detention homes and prisons. Old people live
demeaning, vegetable-like lives on welfare and/or are
put away in convalescent homes, so that society is
robbed of the wisdmn which can only come from long
experience. Even those men and women who are fortu-
nate enough to have jobs work at them only to get
their paychecks, performing dehumaniiing operations
and producing goods which are not only socially
unnecessary but often (as in the case of Cadillacs
and munitions) destructive of other people and the
environment.

If we stop seeing ourselves only as victims or
competitors with men and recognize that our degrada-
tion is part of the general degradation which has all
Americans in its grip. then we can begin raising our
sights to wonder about the opportunities which modern
technology has given us to assume responsibility for
creating new, more fulfilling human relations not only
with men but with everybody else in our society. with
this more expanded concept of our role, we can become

36

 

 

   

a powerfui force to bring about profound changes in our
society so that not only we but a11 Americans can be-
gin to 1ive more fu1fi11ing and meaningfui iives.

CHAPTER IV

A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE

Today all Americans, men and women, black, brown,
white, yellow or red, rich, poor or middle class, young
and old, teeter on the edge of mental breakdown be-
cause we are so starved in relation to our basic human
need to be normally and naturally contributing to our
society. More and more Americans have become primarily
consumers or parasites, eating, drinking, shopping,
watching TV, sleeping —- with no purpose in living from
day to day except to acquire more things.

As a result, the only thing that most of us share
is physical space. Socially we are enemies to one
another. In all our daily relations to one another,
at home, at work or on the streets, each of us is an
alienated self-centered individual, caring only about
"No. 1 - and the hell with everybody else." It is
taken for granted that each individual should treat
every other individual only as an object or a means
to his/her ends. People call you idealistic or
utopian if you believe that individuals can and should
respect one another, work together for common rather
than selfish goals, take responsibility for one another.
Other societies have considered these the normal or
natural way for people to live together. In our society
these relations have become so rare that they seem
contrary to human nature.

Most radicals blame the capitalist system for this
situation, and it is true that the capitalist system
is the objective cause for the deterioration in all
our social relations. The purpose of capitalism is to
produce profit by all and any means necessary and, in
the interests of producing profit, capitalism has re-
duced all relations between human beings to money
relations, made the worker into an appendage to the
machine, thrown millions out of the productive process
by the ceaseless introduction of ever-more sophistica-

38

 

tednmchinery,and now spends billions of dollars year-
ly to whet our greeds in order to provide an expanding
production.

However, at this stage it is equally important

for us to recognize that the development of technology
under capitalism has also made it possible and neces-
sary for human beings to make decisions which no human
beings have ever had to make before. Today in our
society there is no such thing as a "Scarcity" of
goods. True, there are material things which some have
and others yearn for. But technology has now been
developed to the point where we can produce what we
want when we want it. we can dream or envision what
we want in the way of material things, program the
computer and, presto, produce it. But we can also no
longer evade the reality that the unchecked development
of technology under capitalism is today producing not
only more goods but also more parasitism, more perver-
sion, more pollution, more alcoholism, more drug addic-
tion, and more dehumanization in all our social rela-
tions. Meanwhile, Americans drift aimlessly in a
society no longer governed by the necessities of belly
hunger but not yet governed by the social and political
choices based on human values which only human beings
can make.

It is only when we recognize this dual or
contradictory character of capitalism that we can
begin to appreciate the Great Divide or the unique
stage which we in the Technological Explosion made
possible by world war II. Previously human beings
have had to spend most of their time in struggling to
overcome the hardships of poverty, hunger and cold.
These problems are still the main problems faced by
two-thirds of the world's peoples, especially in the
Third world. But today in the United States these
problems have been essentially solved. Therefore the
main problem that we face is how we can develop more
fulfilling and more human relations with one another.

Previously, our relations were to a large extent

determined by conditions outside our control. Today
it is not only necessary but possible for us to make

39

 

decisions and choices which no human beings have ever
had the opportunity or responsibility to make. That
means we must stop thinking of ourselves as victims

and start thinking of ourselves as socially responsi-

ble human beings who can change things from the way
they are to the way that they should be. It means
that subjectively we must enlarge our concept of what
it means to be a human being to include making choices
and decisions as to how oursocietyshould be organized
and how we should relate to one another, rather than
see ourselves as at the mercy of outside forces. In
past societies these social and political decisions
were made by an elite, primarily male. Now women as
well as men, the young as well as the old, the poor

as well as the rich, can and must see ourselves as
being the ones to make these decisions; in other words,
exercising our political capacities or capacities for
self-government.

In order to make social choices and decisions, we
need a philosophy of life or a concept of the values
by which human beings should live - because all choices
and decisions, whether we realize it or not, stem from
a system of values. How do we believe that human
beings should live with oneanother? Do we still accept
the individualistic and materialistic values by which
capitalism operates and which have become a part of all_
of us because we are all products of capitalist society?
Or, having seen the degradation and dehumanization to
which we have all been brought by a society living by
individualism and materialism, are we ready to adopt a
new philosophy which gives priority to human develop-
ment over material development?

Are we going to continue escalating our wants to
the point of Greeds, even if this means frustrating
the basic need of every human being to be productive
and creative and to live in relations of mutual respect,
cooperation and responsibility with one another? Or
are we ready to make a fundamental distinction between
what we want and what we need, and take the position
that our human needs are much more important to us than
our insatiable wants?

 

These are the kinds of questions facing every
American today.

As long as most of the basic material needs of the
great majority of the population could not be met be-
cause of the low level of the productive forces,
capitalism was progressive because it developed the
productive forces so rapidly. But since world war II
the unchecked development of technology in this
country has escalated to the point where we are being
enslaved by our selfish wants. Today, in pursuing
happiness through the acquisition of more material
goods, millions of people cheat, steal, pimp off one
another, and even kill - while others who may not be
ready to go that far make excuses for them by saying
"that's human nature." The more that can be produced,
the more we want, and the more we are willing to
sacrifice one another to get what we want. Happiness
has thus come to mean an unlimited access to socially
unnecessary luxury goods. we have reached the point
from bottom to top of our society where we are consu-
ming for the sake of consumption at practically the
same rate as capitalism is producing for the sake of
profit. Having accepted the dictatorship of economics
over our lives, we all have more things than we need
but we are probably the loneliest and most unhappy
people in the world.

As women, we have a tremendous stake in challeng-
ing all Americans including ourselves, to see the
urgent need for enlarging our concept of human identity
to include responsibility for reorganizing this society
on the basis of human rather than material needs.

Freed by modern technology from old responsibilities
and relationships which, although burdensome, never-
theless called upon us to exercise our capacities for
creativity, loyalty and responsibility, we are today
subject to the most unscrupulous and opportunistic
forces in American society. Millions of us live
vegetable lives on ADC or welfare with no prospect
of ever being employed or making a positive contri-
bution to society. Other millions of us are "only
one man away from welfare" -- in the sense that if
we broke up with our mates, there would be no other

PREFACE

we have written this pamphlet with the aim of

challenging everyone, regardless of sex, race, color
or creed, with the need to struggle against the tra-
ditional role of women as chiefly wives, mothers and
housekeepers. we are particularly challenging women
to recognize the fact that we are first and foremost
human beings, capable of contributing to the advance-
ment of Man/womankind in every sphere. It is only
when we start with this recognition that we can begin
to struggle concretely and effectively to change
things from the way that they are to the way that we
think they should be - instead of seeing ourselves as
poor, helpless victims.

Today Americans in all walks of life are being
confronted with the need to question the views that
they presently hold of women's role. In our techno-
logically advanced society, where it is possible for
women to engage in every kind of socially necessary
and socially unnecessary activity, it makes no sense
to think that women have their "place".

That American women today have higher hopes and
aspirations than they ever had before is due primarily
to the struggles of the women's liberation movement
which emerged towards the end of the 1960s. The
women's liberation movement has established, irrevo-
cably, the truth that women are human beings equal to
men in our humanity -- capable of knowledge, of skills,
of wisdom, of loyalty, of political consciousness and
of social responsibility, as well as of making mis-
takes and learning from them.

As a result of the women's movement, there are
more women asking questions about who they are and
how women should be treated than at any other time
in history. women are seeking answers to such
questions as: what was the real role of women in
history? what should be the role of women and men
in the family and in politics? How can we get men to
realize that we are not going to take their pushing
us around any more?

 

  

place for us to go (something which they remind us of
often). Many of our husbands work two jobs or seven
days a week, neglecting our children, us, and our
communities because they are convinced that getting
more things is the solution to all our problems. Or
they move around the country in search of jobs paying
more money or providing more status, even though it
means that we have to live lonely, isolated lives in
new cities and subdivisions. we are degraded to sex
objects not only by profit-seeking manufacturers and
dope-pushing pimps but even by the men in our lives
whom we want to love and respect but who take out
their frustrations on us because sexism is as natural

_and normal in a sexist society as racism is in a

racist society. In many sections of the country we
cannot go out alone at night because rape - the most
dehumanizing experience to which one human being can
subject another — is an ever-present danger.

How are we going to change this situation? By
complaining? By struggling for equality with mén --
whose degradation and dehumanization in our society
differs from ours only in degree and not in kind? Or
are we willing to accept the challenge that modern
technology has now made it both possible and necessary
for us to participate with men not only in the pro-
ductive arena but in the political decision-making?

 

Therefore we now have the opportunity and the responsi-
bility to struggle, side by side with men, to create
the kind of society in which every American, regardless
of sex, race, class or age, can contribute his/her
maximum abilities and everyone relates to everyone else
with respect, cooperation and responsibility.

If we accept this challenge, the first thing we,
like everybody else in today's America, must do is
take the political position that human development and
human values should take priority over economic
development and material wants. Then we must take
responsibility for struggling to convince others, men
and women, to adopt this philosophy. Meanwhile, like
everybody else in today's America, we must take the
responsibility for wondering about, projecting and
struggling to implement the new answers to the new
questions which we now face and which have never been
faced by human beings before.

WHAT, WHEN AND HOW DO WE NEED TO PRODUCE AND
CONSUME -- not in order "to keep the economy going"
but to develop our collective self-reliance, our col-
lective pride in our communities and in workmanship,
and to satisfy our human need to live more meaningful
lives? Should we demand that auto plants stay open
just so that auto workers can keep working -- or should
we close them down, knowing that this will mean a
general cutback in our standard of living, until we
discover what kind of transportation we need to provide
both mobility and meaningful social contact among
ourselves, instead of increasing pollution, traffic
jams, streets emptied of pedestrians, and 50,000 auto
deaths a year?

WHAT KIND OF HOMES, SCHOOLS, WORKPLACES, PUBLIC
BUILDINGS DO WE NEED to enable us to relate to one
another as human beings, to raise children who will
be self-reliant as well as eager to help others, and
to encourage everyone, including women and men, the
old and the young, to live more productive and less
alienated lives? Should young people be kept in
schools, just because there are no jobs for them? Or
should we close down the schools until we discover
the purpose of education in an age of automation?

CAN NEW YORK CITY EVER BE MADE LIVABLE without
millions of people moving out? Can the big cities
ever solve the garbage problem as long as people

throw paper, bottles, and rubbish all over the streets
-- because we now believe that sanitation is the
special job of sanitation workers, just as we believe
that education is the special job of teachers, health
the special job of doctors, and politics the special
job of politicians.

HOW CAN WE STOP DOPE ADDICTION AS LONG AS TV
COMMERCIALS KEEP PUSHING DRUGS AS THE INSTANT SOLUTION
TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS? why can't we fight crime by
pledging with one another not to buy "hot goods"--
thus showing in practice that we value our social ties

with our neighbors more than we value material things?

SHOULD TV BROADCASTING BE RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN
HOURS OF THE DAY -- not just to save energy but to
save millions of Americans from becoming vegetables,
challenging all of us to renew our contacts with our
neighbors, with ourselves, and with Nature?

As human beings and as citizens living in today's
America, we must participate on an equal basis in
projecting and struggling for answers to these ques-
tions which will advance the whole society. In addi-
tion, as women, we have special reasons for being
active in these struggles. Because these struggles
are so obviously necessary at this Great Divide in
human history, they will enable us to fulfill the deep
need for making a direct contribution to society and
the advancement of the human species which has become
such a natural part of our human identity down through
the ages. At the same time, only if we participate
equally in these struggles can we ensure that in the
reorganization of American society which is now long
overdue, we will not once again be relegated to the
role of adjuncts to men.

For example, if we are convinced that women are
as capable as men of doing most of the jobs of society,
and if we recognize the need of all human beings to
be productive and to live together in relations of

44

 

 

/s

 

mutual respect, cooperation and responsibility, then
we must struggle to reorganize industry in such a way
that women and men with children can both work out-
side the home and the community. One way to do this
might be to organize the production process so that
males and females in the same household or in the
same community can share jobs, the males working
mornings and the females afternoons. Or they could
work alternate weeks or months or seasons of the year.
This means that industry would have to be reorganized
on the basis of human needs instead of on the basis
of profit -- which can only be achieved through
struggle against those who now run our society.

If we are convinced that it is essential for

women to develop themselves in fields outside the home,
then we will take the responsibility ourselves and also
urge other women and men to postpone having children
until the woman has had an opportunity to develop her
capabilities outside the family. we will not bear
children until we and our mates are ready to settle
down to raise a family and take responsibility for the

vcommunity, so that together we can provide the stability
and the models of social responsibility which every
child needs in order to develop into a full human being.
In our own homes we will raise our daughters to become
self-reliant and assertive and our sons to cook, clean,
care for children, etc. we will struggle with our
mates to share responsibility for the home in order to
set an example for our children and_to reinforce our
own conviction that this is "people's work" and not
just "woman's work." we will struggle for the kind

of housing units which enable several generations to
live closely together within the community so that

the raising of children can be shared and so that

our children can get the sense of the continuing evolu-
tion of Humankind which comes from growing up around
grandparents. we will struggle to reorganize our
schools to provide opportunities for our children to
learn not only through books but by carrying out
productive and community tasks in close relationship
with people from all walks of life and with senior
citizens.

These are only a few examples of how we could
begin to struggle to reorganize our society and our
own personal lives once we have decided to give
priority to human values over material values and
accepted our opportunity and responsibility as women
to participate equally in these struggles. There are
many other possibilities which will come to mind once
we have begun to struggle together on the basis of a
new philosophy and ideology. We will not always make
the correct decisions; and even when we do, new
contradictions will always arise because Humankind

and this nation are still evolving. But we can't keep
delegating this responsibility to others and then
blame them because their decisions lead us into one
crisis after another.

In every sphere of our society new questions are
pressing to be answered: questions of production, of
pollution, of transportation, of the role of the family,
of the educational system, of the health system and of
this country's relations with other nations, particu-
larly with the Third world. we can no longer claim
ignorance of these questions or pretend that there is
such a thing as our "private lives" untouched by the

46

 

 

 

crisis in all these areas. How these questions are
resolved profoundly affects the daily lives of everyone
as well as the future of our nation and the evolution
of the human race.

Today we have the right to do almost anything we
want to do. we can see ourselves only as child-bearers
or sex objects, limiting ourselves to a purely biolo-
gical role, and therefore defining our human identity
only in relationship to men. Or we can enlarge our
concept of ourselves as human beings, determined to
perform all the socially necessary and creative activi-
ties which advanced technology now makes it possible
for women to do and to participate equally in making
the social and political decisions which shape the
economy, our communities and this country as well as~
our homes and families.

The choice is ours to make, and we have no one to

blame but ourselves if we do not grasp the opportunities
to shape the future which now lies before us.

CHAPTER V

WHAT MUST WE DO NOW?

In the last chapter we projected the need for
everybody in the country to begin struggling for a new
philosophy and ideology which gives priority to human
development over economic development. we also pointed
out the tremendous stake that women have in making clear
that this choice now confronts all Americans. At this
juncture everyone who feels the need to change things
from the way they are to the way they should be, has
the responsibility to begin engaging in philosophical
and political struggle with everybody else in this
society, regardless of sex, race, age or class, over
the values and methods needed to reorganize this country
so that we can live less alienated lives. Our struggle
as women can no longer be based on the unity which we

‘have with other women on a biological basis or on the

 

basis of our common oppression. It must now be based

on unity with those who are not only willing to struggle
against male chauvinism but who are committed to the
struggle for the total reorganization of American soci-
ety on the basis of new human values.

Not just as women but as human beings and as
citizens, we must accept the responsibility to struggle
for the creation of a new society in the United States.
The decision before us, if we want to be complete human
beings, is not a choice of women vs. men but of which
road this country should take. Can we continue to
travel the capitalist road of unchecked technological
development on which we are now rushing pell-mell to
destruction? Or must all of us, regardless of sex, race,
class or age, now begin to exercise our still untapped
political capacities by struggling collectively to plan
the reorganization of our homes, our communities, Ameri-
can industry and the nation as a whole, making decisions
based on human needs rather than on "keeping the econo-
my going?"

48

 

 

 

As women, as human beings and as citizens, we must
be ready to grapple with these philosophical and polit-
ical questions in relation to the future or our entire
society and not just in relationship to our homes or
what is best for our children. we have always been
able to stand up against our men and project what was
best for our children or what kind of accessories we
thought were necessary to our homes. But when con-
fronted with political questions, we have tended to
take a back seat, claiming our ignorance of such
matters and limiting our talk to soap operas, our
children, men or other people's business. Now we must
see that this was not our "nature" but the consequence
of our accepting our "place" in society. we must re-
fuse now to accept this "place" and struggle to devel-
op our power and our abilities to make contributions
in the arena of social and political decision-making.

That means we can no longer rely upon our "women's
intuition” -— that vague mixture of sentiment and
prejudice which has been romanticized as our special
gift. we must struggle to develop our minds and ex-
pand our knowledge beyond the domestic sphere to
questions of philosophy and politics and to national
and international matters because we recognize the
importance of taking principled positions and the need
for everyone to understand what is taking place not
only in the United States but in the world. To do
otherwise is to allow ourselves to be isolated once
again in the world of the private and the personal
and therefore to accept continuing sexism, exploita-
tion and male domination.

As women, as citizens and as human beings, we must
now struggle to create and live by new principles in
every aspect of our daily lives. If we are determined
that everyone should have an opportunity to be produc-
tive, creative and political, and to live together in
relations of mutual respect, cooperation and responsi-
bility, then we must apply these principles in our
homes, with our children, our mates, on our jobs, in
our communities. This means that we will struggle to
break down the wall that has been erected between our
families and the larger society and will see our
families not as a refuge from but as the nucleus of

49

   

 

the larger society. In other words, the principles
we act on in our families will be the ones we live by
in society and vice versa.

On the basis of this new outlook, we can then act
differently so that men will find it difficult to
continue viewing us as sex objects to be manipulated
and abused. If we want men to respect us as whole

‘human beings, we must begin acting like whole human

, ..~.,s..?e*-' ~;~,:ra;.~;—.~aa»i=s,.~  ._

 

beings, breaking away from the narrow lives that have
left us with a narrow outlook, concerned only with our
homes and families. we must begin to raise the new
questions that have been created by the new stage of
development of the United States, not just demanding
solutions and answers from others but ourselves parti~
cipating in working out the answers and solutions.

we must not only take on the challenge of becoming
doctors, lawyers, engineers, welders, carpenters,
instead of nurses, secretaries, models, librarians;
we must also take on the challenge of political strug-
gles. we must begin to think and study and wonder and
project the new ways in which production, transporta-
tion, education, the health system, etc., could be
reorganized to meet human needs rather than economic
needs. These decisions cannot be made as quickly and
off the top of our heads as the innumerable decisions
we are used to making on what to cook for supper, what
the children should wear to school, or how to please
our men. Therefore we must struggle to reorganize our
lives as well as our households to allow us time during
the day as well as in the evenings to read, think,
participate in political discussions and organizations,
and carry out other community activities. we must
struggle against the tendency to let our children or
our mates run our lives or to do all the household
work ourselves because we want to avoid the tensions
that come from struggling with our families to do their
share. we must remember that if we do not struggle
with our mates and our children to share the responsi-
bilities of the home as well as those outside the
home, we are setting a poor example for the next
generation.

As we have made clear in earlier chapters, creat-
ing a new human identity for ourselves is far more than
a question of equal or civil rights, as demanded by
blacks during the civil rights movement of the 1950s
and 1960s. The question of sexism has far deeper
historical roots and extends to many more people than
the question of racism. It not only involves one-half
of the human race but it requires that, except in the
very few matters which involve the biological differ-
ence between men and women, we transcend biological
differences because we are now entering into a new
stage of human evolution in which everyone can and
must exercise our heretofore unrealized powers for
shaping our relations with each other and with our
environment for good or for ill.

we must be very clear that we are talking about
creating a new society at a new and unprecedented
stage in human development when all of us can start
out on an equal footing, without being held back by
the hang-ups of the past. we are in the process of
redefining what is womanhood and what is manhood with-
in the framework of a new, enlarged concept of human-
hood. There are certain roles that can't be changed,
e.g., child-bearing. We can't say that women and men
should bear children equally. But in every other
sphere we can now begin the creation of new relations
based upon our confidence in the ability of women to
be as productive, as creative and as political as men.

The main question, therefore, is not whether women
should or could be equal to men. we are equal human
beings by virtue of the fact that we are human. That
is, like men, we have minds whose potential for reflec-
tion and projection we have not even begun to explore.
Up to now we have been denied our equal humanity be-
cause males, under the various systems of oppression
down through the ages, exploited biological differences
for their own material benefit, just as white people
exploited the difference in color of blacks (which is
not even a biological difference) for the material
benefit of whites and for the rapid economic develop-
ment of this country. Just as whites rationalized
their racism by claiming that blacks are inferior, so

51

 

That is why so many men (and also those women
who take their cues from men on how to think) are so
hostile to the women's movement. They make fun of it
and stereotype and slander women in the struggle as
"man-hating dykes and butches" in order to try to
scare women off from getting involved in the movement.
Like whites who refuse to face the question of their
racism, men invent all kinds of rationalizations to
justify their continuing domination and to evade the
challenge to their sexism which large numbers of
women are now making in the wake of the women's
movement.

However, because the women's movement did not
assume the responsibility for clarifying and strug-
gling for the new human values which all Americans
now need to create in all aspects of our daily lives,
it has begun to fragment into a number of issue-
oriented, self-interest groups. Most women in the
movement now see themselves chiefly as victims of men
who are seen as the villains or the enemy. For them,
the struggle now centers chiefly around competing with
men, alienating men, and/or trying to be like men -
never once questioning whether men, as they are today,
are the kind of human beings that we should be striv-
ing to emulate.

That is why we have deemed it necessary to write
this pamphlet. It is self-evident that it is not
enough just for women, in today's world, to live from
day to day, washing, ironing, cooking, cleaning,
caring for our children, and watching soap operas.
But we do not believe that women should be competing
with or trying to become like men.

Instead we believe that we, as women, must begin
seeking answers to some very fundamental questions.
what should be the new relationship between women and
men now that almost any kind of work can be done by
either sex? How is the abuse and manipulation of
women as sex objects connected to the alienation
which everyone in today's America feels? why is the
women's movement so important to the overall struggle
to advance humankind?

men have rationalized their sexism by claiming that
women are inferior.

Our internal contradictions, based upon our former
acceptance of ourselves as inferior, cannot be legis-
lated away. Each of us must now be ready to carry on
a struggle against our own narrow self-concepts which

»have kept us from being the productive, creative and

  

political human beings we can and need to become. we
must not only repudiate the ideology that claims the
superiority of males, but we must be ready to take on
the tremendous questions that relate to the organiza-
tion of our society and which challenge us to rise
above our feelings of inferiority. The inferior posi-
tions which we have held as women can only be corrected
in the course of our struggles to transform this soci-
ety. The best way for us to challenge those who per-
petuate male chauvinism is to seize every opportunity
to make a contribution to the struggle to change this
society to a more humane one.

In order to rid our society of male chauvinism,
the main burden lies upon us as women because we have
the greatest need to rid ourselves of our oppression.
No dominant group has ever given up its privileges
without a struggle on the part of the oppressed.
Therefore women are the ones who must stand up and
force men to struggle against their tendency to domi-
nate, unconsciously as well as consciously. Not only
must we struggle individually against our husbands and
men friends, but we must confront all institutions
which discriminate against us. we must also be ready
to confront the "slave mentality" of those women who
want to continue playing the game by the old rules.
Just as there were scabs in the labor movement and
Uncle Toms in the black movement, we must expect
Aunt Jeminas in the women's movement. we must also be
clear that this is not a race issue because male chau-
vinism does not care what color a woman is. Black,
Chicano, Puerto Rican, Asian men dominate and abuse
women as much as white men do. white working women
make on the average less than black working men, while
black working women are at the very bottom of the
income ladder. Therefore we must be ready to challenge

52

 

 

38

those black women and men who still say that "black
liberation comes first" or "that black women have al-
ways been free."

we must challenge men to confront other men with
their chauvinistic attitudes and behavior towards women,
just as we are challenging women who accept male domina-
tion. As we struggle to hold up “our half of the sky,"
i.e., assume our responsibility for struggling to re-
organize American society for the benefit of everyone,
regardless of sex, race, class or age, we must also
struggle with men to hold up their half, not only in
relation to the home but to society as a whole. Both
of us -— men and women -- must seize every opportunity
to make clear our position that we are opposed not only
to male chauvinism but to all attitudes and institutions
based upon giving priority to economics over human

.relations and upholding the domination of one group

over another.

In challenging men to struggle against their own
male chauvinism and that of other men, we should em-
phasize how much men and the whole society have.to gain
from the equal development of women and the creation of
new relations of respect and cooperation between men
and women. Like all oppressing classes and races, men
limit themselves in countless ways by their domination
of women. By their stubborn refusal to share responsi-
bility for household expenses and by their fear of
women making more money than they do, many men are
killing themselves working two jobs or working overtime.
It is actually impossible for one person to make all
the important decisions in a family or to do all the
technical repair work (e.g., plumbing, electrical
appliances) around a household in the modern world. If
the family breaks up, as so many families are breaking
up today, then the one who has insisted on making all
the important decisions is burdened with the failure,
whether he recognizes it or not. The stresses and
strains which men place on themselves in their deter-
mination to be masculine (for example, not to cry or
to show their feelings) or a "success" object are
tremendous, as indicated in the fact that men are dying
today much earlier than women.

53

 

 

 

In depriving themselves of the joys and agonies
involved in the raising of children, men are also de-
priving themselves of the opportunity to gain a deep
appreciation of what it means to be directly and con-
tinuously responsible for the future of other human
beings -— which is an extension of the attitudes in-
volved in raising a child. Many fathers are baffled

.when their teenage children treat them like strangers.

  

They do not realize that the time to start building a
close relationship with your child is on the day the
child is born: through the close physical contact of
bathing and feeding the infant and, as the child grows,
in the ongoing daily activities of work around the
house.

Few men have any idea of the breadth of thought
and feeling that they can discover in themselves when
they begin to share ideas and responsibilities with
another equally developed adult in the unique inti-
macy of the woman-man relationship. Because the rela-
tionship between women and men contains within it so
much tension, the struggle to create new, more ful-
filling relations between the two sexes has within it
the potential for a much higher level of shared senti-
ments and common goals than any of us have ever ex-
perienced. For the same reason the struggle to create
new relations in this sphere can bring out the best
(or, in some cases, the worst) in both men and women,
in the family, in the community and in organizations.

In all these struggles we must be assertive and
challenging, combating the deep-seated tendency in
Americans to be liberal, that is, to evade struggling
over questions of principle for fear of creating
tensions or becoming unpopular. Instead we must live
by the fundamental dialectical principle: that progress
comes only from struggling to resolve contradictions.
Relations between women and men are so familiar and
basic that struggles to create new, more human rela-
tions between people.

In the course of our struggles in the women's
movement, we have learned a great deal about our own
strengths and weaknesses as well as the strengths and
weaknesses of other sections of the movement. we are

no longer as likely to be confused by the rhetoric and
abstractions which American radicals have substituted
for a concrete analysis of the real contradictions of
American society. we have some ideas, even if still
quite vague, of how human beings should relate to one
another as a result of our struggles against the in-
human relations which presently exist between men and
women. we should be able to hold our own in organiza-
tions consisting of both sexes, as members and as
leaders.

Now, with our deepened understanding of how our
struggle to create new, more fulfilling relations with
men epitomizes the need and opportunity today for all
Americans to rise to a higher level of human relation-
ships and political responsibility, we should be able

to embark with our co-citizens on the protracted strug-

gle to revolutionize American society, confident that
as human beings living in the modern world, we have
powers greater than any previous generation of women
or men.

In the search for new, more human relations
between men and women, we are part of a general

search for new relations between people. The fact is‘

that during the last hundred years, and especially
the last thirty, the old division of roles between
men and women has lost its objective basis and we
have not yet found the new universals to correspond
to the new stage of development.

It is true that men and women have been strug-
gling with each other for hundreds of thousands of
years, but never before have we really faced the
question of man-woman relations in every aspect of
our human nature: biological, psychological, econo-
mic, political and social. Ioday American women
are saying, "Look, let's stop and face it!" In this
confrontation is involved the key to all other human
relationships. It is no longer just a question of
the particular grievances that we have as women.
what is involved now is the evolution of human beings
to a higher level of relationships with one another.

CHAPTER I

"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO SCREAM?”

The idea that women exist to serve men has been
around for so long that some fail to see it as a
problem. For many, it is as natural as eating and
sleeping. Society has fostered the idea that woman's
place is in the home, tending the children, serving
her mate and going to work only to extend the family
income. A man's place has been at the head of the
table, in the driver's seat, at the head of the
household and on the speaker's platform. These no-
tions exist underneath every institution and in the
psyche of every individual. No one or nothing has
escaped the universal doctrine of male superiority
and female inferiority.

A lot of people don't understand why American
women are so dissatisfied. After all, we are much
freer from official restraints than women anywhere
else in the world. Like men, we may attend the
various educational institutions and attain as broad
an education as we want or can afford. There are a

variety of occupations which we may choose to go into.

The money we earn may be spent on whatever pleases
us, such as cars, clothing, vacations, etc.‘ For
entertainment we may indulge in sports from bowling
to tennis, or go to theatres and nightclubs where we
freely meet and socialize with men. we are free to
date and/or have sex with whomever we desire. The
choice of whether or not to marry and bear children
is also ours.

Actually, the root of our dissatisfaction is
precisely this contradiction: that in so many areas
we are equal to men and yet in the most fundamental
relations of our daily lives, females are still
treated as second-class citizens.
