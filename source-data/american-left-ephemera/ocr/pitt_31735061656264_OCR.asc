L.Y.L. Unites the 'Youth A

- The Labor Youth League did yeoman ser-

vice in the petition campaign for signatures I
[to the World Peace Pledge. I am sure it is
going to’ . help unite ever wider sections of .
I the youth around the key issue of outlawing
atomic weapons through international agree-

ment. . , '
All of us must do more than we have done

to combat the dangerous illusion that a third‘

 

World war, unleashed by the United States or
any other nation, could be won—or shortened
—by atom bombs. But Ithink /that for young
people especially, moral“ considerations carry

great weight. Our youth are basically decent ‘
human beings, and harsh in their judgment
of the sins of their elders. Millions of young,

differences, canbe united in. protest against a
the immorality of an‘American-made atomic w

war. The L.Y.L. will gain  prestige and
inﬂuence if it boldly provides an avenue of
expression to the broad masses of youth who

- now reject “this inhuman “preventive war”—-, i

but are silent because they have not found
the way to make themselves heard.

Atomic weapons are ‘fascist weapons. To
accept in silence ‘the prospect of using. them
is itself brutalizing. It is a step toward ac-

‘ custorning oneself to the idea of gas ovens

and the other reﬁnements of fascist torture
and murder. Thus, it is quite logical that
along with open’ calls for “preventive war”
against the Soviet Union, we hear“ in our

country equally open calls for taking thou- »

sands ofAmericans into “protective custody,”
and utting them into concentration camps.
In fact, while plans for atom bomb shelters
are still in the blueprint stage—the prepara-
tion of concentration camps is much farther
advanced. »

The Fascist Menace »

If fascism comes to power in our country,
it won’t ride in on -a white horse. The cast of

 

characters in A the Washington 4 show won’t A

change much. The President’s script writers
will still make sure that his speeches say a
good word for the Bill of Rights.’ The same
judges will ﬁgure out new ways of getting
around the Constitution.

Fascism has for a long time been creeping
up on us, like a soft-footed tiger in the night.
First, we got used to the House Un-American

Committee. Then we learned to live with the 
“loyalty order,” the Taft—Hartley Act, the

teachers’ oaths, the screening of industrial
workers suspected of harboring thoughts. dis-
loyal to the boss. We got used to the arrest,
and detention without bail, of Americans of
foreign birth. Then we got used to seeing
native born Americans picked up, jailed; and
held in protective custody. We have not taken
in the full signiﬁcance of the fact that 23 in-
nocent Negroes face execution on frame-up
charges. In this city, and throughout the
country, police brutality against the Negro
12

  

people and the Negro youth in particular is
an every-day occurrence. We’ have gotten
used to it. Like the Germans, some can even
pretend they don’t know what is going on,

‘don’t smell the burning ’ ﬂesh of a Negro

lynched down South, don’t hear the cries of
pain when the Ku Klux Klan rides and ﬂogs.

Political trials have become a commonplace.
Foley Square has lost the novelty of two, years
ago. We can hardly keep track of the number
of people who are in jail, or prison bound be-
cause of their ideas. .

Now the Senate is engaged in a world-
shaking debate. The “elder statesmen” who
claim to have your lives all planned for you,
are debating whether those who question
their plansgshould be rounded up by executive
decree, or by congressional order. Our fas-
cist-minded law makers are no longer con-
cerned with the Bill of Rights, or embarrassed
by its restraints. They are quibbling over the
ornaments and the bric-a-brac of their police
state‘ structure.

13

  

Defeat the‘ Fasc/ists Now

 

Some people, young as well as old, are say?

ing that it will be time enough to worry about
the concentration camps when they see what

. they look like inside.

Others, some old and tired, some old only./in
‘spirit, are " saying it is too late for us to save
our demo.cratic institutions and civil rights.
I, say the time to defend the Bill of Rights,
and set the fascists back on their heels is now!
If we wait any longer, we are going‘ to ex-
perience on a mass scale .»some things that it
isn’t possible to live with — much less get
used to. J A A ’
Sure we are late. What delayed us was the
anti-Communist bogey—Hitler’s old gag. \But
we are not so late that we ‘can, only argue be-
hind barbed wire about who was to blame for

V our failure to act unitedly. There is still time

  

to get together now, and build up for a peo-
ple’s‘ counter-attack against those who would
turn this nation into a prison house. V
It was “too late,” according to some ac-
counts, to save Willie McGee and the Mar-
tinsville Seven. But they were saved by the
14 '

 

 

united action of Negro and white—and by in-
ternational solidarity. ,
No, my young friends, I tell you soberly it

(is not too late to save our country from fas-

cism. But I must also tell you that in this
struggle to defend the Bill of Rights there is
a point of no return. If the frightened men of
Wall Street and Washington succeed in out-
lawing the Communist Party—if the Mundt-
McCarran bill, or the Kilgore-Lehman bill, or
any version of these measures passes—if these
things are allowed to happen—then I cannot
give you any guarantee that the point of no

4 L return ‘will not soon be reached.

We ‘Communists, and all anti-fascists, all
progressives, will struggle ‘ﬁrst to defend and,
if need be, to regain our 'people7s inalienable
right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness. We will struggle against all odds, and
under whatever conditions may be imposed.
In the end, the victory will be ours. But if
you want to know what lies between the out-
lawing of the Communist Party and the de-
struction of fascist power—look back to the
terrible twelve years of Hitler’s rule.

Youth Love Democracy

1 Without the youth, fascism cannot fully es-
tablish itself. And fascism is like the spider
that devours its young. '
The youth of America is not the youth of
Hitler Germany. It has not been embittered
by military defeat and the national shame of a
Versailles Treaty. In the depths of the world
economic crisis of the early thirties, Hitler
began the systematic brutalization of the Ger-
man youth. He had six years to ready it for
the Nazi invasion of Poland. But our young
people today hardly remember the Great De-
pression. They have not been brutalized—-
although all the avenues of mass communica-
tion are working overtime to speed up the job.
Maybe some young Americans dreamed of
easy conquests, such as those that gave the
Hitler youth the brief illusion of invincibility.
But our youth have been sobered by the ex-
perience of the G.I.’s in Korea. _ i
Your fellow workers and classmates, those
who are veterans and those just coming of
military age, have known only one war. That
was a just and patriotic war, waged by the
16

 

  

United Nations against the fascist Axis. World
War II left its imprint on your generation. It

deepened young America’s devotion to our ‘

nation’s democratic traditions and institutions.
It fostered that love of country which burns
bright in our youth, as in the youth of all
lands. It taught you to respect and value real
allies.

The youth of America was spared much of
the suffering and sacriﬁce exacted from the
youth of our World War II allies, and particu-

_ larly from the heroic Soviet youth. Yet the

young people of America had more than their
ﬁll of war. Four years of it left them with an
ardent desire for peace, and high hopes for
the mission of the United Nations.

The bipartisan warmakers have to reckon
with this complex of experience which enters
into the thinking of American youth. The slo-
gans with which Hitler dazzled the youth of
Germany have to be revamped for American
consumption.

Truman’: “Reassurances”

Last Saturday night Mr. Truman wrestled
I 17

    

\

with this problem. ,I cite only ‘a few examples
of his “solution.” x ‘ A
‘“Lebensraum!"’ That was a dandy slogan
for the German youth. It would do all right
here too—as a call to war against thethousing
shortage. Q g \ .
But Mr. Truman had other ﬁsh to fry. The
youth of our 48 states and wide open spaces
don’t, want F ormosa or any part of Asia.‘ So
Mr. Truman had to assure them that he doesn’t
want them, either. That sounded good. But

there was a catch in it. Since the end of World «
War II, the Socialist-minded -peoples of the y

world have had the nerve to evict the'Ameri-«

can monopolists and cartellists who were milk- -

ing their countries. These tycoons are ﬁnding
their Wall Street-canyonapretty cramped as a
result. It is the Rockefellers, DuPonts and
Morgans who want “lebensraum” for their in-

vestments. That iswhat Mr. Truman’s speech

    

tried to cover up. ~ ‘
National pride, and even national chauvin-

(ism, are not without inﬂuence on American.
youth. But Mr. Truman knew better than‘ to

echo Hitler’s appeal to a “Master Race.” It
sounded goodpto hear the President promise
18

freedom to all the Asian peoples. But there
was a catch in this one, too. ‘He was speaking
of “fredom” to work for the proﬁt of our oil,
tin and rubber magnates. He didn’t mean free-
dom for all the lands of the Far East to liber-
ate themselves from imperialist oppression and
exploitation. If that had been his meaning, the
President would have announced that the
United States recognizes the government of
the People’s Republic of China, that our troops
are being pulled out of Korea‘. Instead, he
tried to hide the plain fact that he has com-
mitted American boys—Negro and white—to
a war for white supremacy and Wall Street’s
unrestrained license to plunder all the colored
peoples of the world.

The'President rang the changes on some
tried and tested’ slogans. Not Hitler’s slogans,
but those stolen from the anti-Hitler World
War II coalition. He spoke of the age-old
struggle for human liberty, of peace—and, be-
lieve it or not, of the right of youth to plan its
own future. a

are conscious anti-imperialists,"conscious anti-
fascists. You know that the plans, aspirations
and lives of youth are menaced by a social
order which has outlived its social usefulness
and is in the throes of its death agony. You
know. that the. enemy. ..of. youth is. monopoly

capitalism. You know the address—-_Wall Street. p

My good friends-.—you know too much!

Mr. Truman didn't waste time arguing with
you. Speaking to the nation and the world, he
addressed himself above all to the masses of
your fellow-workers and classmates. He was
ﬁghting for the minds of these millions of
young. men and women. Wall Street and its
government needs them to carry out its
schemes of savagery and conquest. Wall Street
is scared to death of the American youth, who
can if they unite repudiate the “elder states-
men” and ruin all their plans. ‘ i

Truman’: Big Lie

On what basis did Mr. Truman try to sell
these young Americans a military career “alien
to the American tradition and shockingto the
American mind”?

i 20

 

On the only possible basis—the basis of
Hitler’s Big Lie which is the rotten core of
America’s whole bipartisan foreign policy. The
lie that the Soviet Union is an imperialist ag-
gressor. The lie that the Soviet Union inter-
venes in the affairs of other nations. The lie
that the Soviet Union is a menace to American
democracy, the security of our nation and to
world peace.

You L.Y.L.’ers, and many of your friends
here tonight, are partisans of the working
class. You know that what the American
workers want for themselves, and what the
War-proﬁteering corporations want for them,
are different as night and day. This working
class point of View enables you to see why a
state ruled by the working people and their
Communist vanguard has no motive or reason
to oppress other nations, or exploit other peo-
ples. You cannot be deceived about the con-
sistent peace policy of the Soviet Union, be-
cause you know what makes this socialist state
tick.

But many young Americans can be and are
being deceived. It is important for us to under-
stand why. Were they all born with gold

. 21

K ,

spoons in their mouths, and a natural hatred
for the land of socialism? No, working youth
and working class youth are not immune to
this fatal anti-Soviet poison.

Are all American youth capitalist-minded?
No, on the contrary, American youth are drawn

to the ideas of socialism and look with critical ‘

eyes on ‘the “imperfections? of the capitalist
system.

In spite of all this, there is an understand- A

able reason why large sections of American

' youth have been tricked into blaming the So— _

viet Union for all that is wrong with the world
—and in the ﬁrst place for the war danger
that hangs over their own lives.

Who’: to Blame for War /Threat?

The blame for the collapse of the people’s
peace hopes, the blame for war and the threat
of war, must be laid at somebody’s door. Large
sections of the youth, reluctant to look closer

home, prefer to blame somebody else.

I spoke before of the imprint left on your
generation by the just war against the Axis
powers. That imprint doesn’t make it any eas-

22 i

ier for young Americans to accept the fact that
the United States has replaced Nazi Germany
as the center of world reaction and the men-
ace to world peace.

The unjust imperialist wars waged by our
country in the past have been disguised in our
history books. The bipartisans even bring
them up now, as precedents that “justify” the
Korean crime. But in addition, the memory
of the just and patriotic war that ended only
ﬁve years ago is vivid, personal and real in
the minds of our youth.

Our youth love America. They love it not
only because it is their own, their native land
—but because of what it has been, what they
want it to be and believe it to be. A free land,
a land of equal opportunity and a good neigh-
bor to all the world.

Our youth has yet to learn—and it must
learn fast—that evil forces have betrayed and
are remaking this America we all love. That
the government of the United States is no
longer the servant of the American people,
but the tool of the sixty ﬁlthy rich families.
And that the economic royalists who live off
the labor of the American workers are sweep-

23

   

desperate effort to save their doomed social
system. V

No generation in history, no youth’ of any
land, ever faced quite so severe a test as
America’s youth faces today. For no other
youth was ever forced to the bitter realiza-
tion that its own government—and no other
—bore the sole responsibility for the greatest
danger ever to confront mankind.

I say that without excepting the German
youth. They could, without condoning the
crimes of the Nazis, at least put some part of
the blame on Hitler’s appeasers in other coun-
tries—including our own.

The Highest Patriotism

There is no higher patriotism than that
which seeks to change the course of.Qne’s own
nation when it is being led to commit war
crimes against other nations. \

Patriots of’ that highest type have come for-
ward to defend America against its internal
enemies in times past. We honor Thomas ]ef-
ferson, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, Henry

David Thoreau and Gene Debs for their out-
spoken opposition to the imperialist wars
waged by the United States while they lived.
But we sometimes forget that it was not easy
for them, either, to criticize and ‘oppose our
government in war-time. For his opposition
to the annexationist war against Mexico, Lin-
coln was labeled as “another Benedict Arnold,”
and refused re-nomination for his seat in Con-
gress.

Most political observers thought Lincoln’s
public career was all washed up. They said
of him what the Gallup pollsters of today say
about Vito Marcantonio. But in 1860 the
American people vindicated Lincoln’s prin-
cipled opposition to the imperialist Mexican
war. And in 1950 the people of New York
are going to vindicate Marc’s courageous and
principled stand against the makers of World
War III.

For his opposition to the imperialist ﬁrst
world war, Gene Debs went to jail. But while
in jail he got a million American votes for the
presidency, and his place in history is more
honored today than that of Woodrow Wilson.
I am more eager to get Gene Dennis out of jail

25

 
 

than to speculate on his chances of being
elected President while ‘ he is there. But I
don’t have to speculate—I know that his oppo-

sition to the bipartisan warmakers will be re-,

membered and honored long after Hany S.

‘ Truman is forgottenf

I have not exaggerated, nor have I tried to

A minimize, the challenge history throws down

 

to your generation of young Americans. ‘I
hardly need to say that the Labor Youth
League has special obligations to help assure
that our youth is not found wanting. Your
young organization cannot yet speak for the
millions of young Americans who want no part
of this war “alien to the American tradition

and shocking to the American mind.”-- But ,

your Voices, though now small in number, will

‘encourage others tospeak. Your initiative in

organizing active mass resistance to the mul-.

tiplying acts of war and fascism will meet with ‘
a warm and ever-growing response. Your ad-’

vocacy of policies for the defense of peace and
the Bill of Rights will not fall on deaf ears.

 

  

The‘Big Chance for Peace

, The challenge, that comes from-this histori-
cal moment is not one-sided. It imposes great
hardships, and demands great courage and

’ sacriﬁce. But this moment is pregnant with

unprecedented opportunities. It brings with it
the big, chance of your lifetime, the big chance
in ‘the lifetime of our beloved country.

The “elder statesmen” are in one hell of a
ﬁx. For them, there is no longer any peaceful

‘ or painless way out.

They cannot win the war they so recklessly
began in Korea, nor have they any hope what-

‘, ever of reconquering free China and putting
down thenational liberation struggles of the

Asian peoples.

They have tried the wayeof the “little war,”
and foundit too dangerous and too costly to
repeat or prolong. T T

In desperation, they are now flirting with
the idea of trying the “big War.” But they are
hypnotized 1 by their own fear of that'Frank-
enstein — the atom bomb. They are rightly
more terriﬁed of its political consequences, of

the wrath of the world’s peoples, than of any.
, ’ 27.

 
 

retaliatory measures that might be taken by
the Soviet Union. With the bomb, or with-
out it, they know that they cannot win a third
world war. ,

The United Nations is another big head-
ache for the “elder statesmen.” At times, it
is a handy instrument of the bipartisan war
policy, ,a convenient Charley McCarthy for
the United States. But at other times, as dur-
ing the month of August, the United Nations
provides a forum for the peace forces of the
world and gives Ambassador Austin apoplec-s
tic ﬁts. Quite a while ago Herbert Hoover

, proposed to kick the Soviet Union out of the

 

United Nations without further-ado. This is a
very tempting idea, and is getting serious con-
sideration in VVashington right now. But, on

 

the eve of the meeting of the General Assem-l

bly, the President ﬁnds himself up a tree. If
the United States destroys the United Nations
—behind whose skirts can it hide? If the U.N.

is allowed to li_ve—it will continue on occasion .
to permit nations not on the American dole

to speakthe truth. /

So, here again, our “elder statesmen” are

damned if they do and damned if they don’t.
~ 28 . g

  

. Why then don’t they turn to the ways of
peace? Ah—-but that course too is fraught with
fatal dangers for this doomed and dying so-
cial system. For the monopolists, peace means
economic disaster. They have committed the
nation to a full-blown war economy. If they
try to reverse that course, the economy will go
bust.

The Way of Peace

We need not shed‘ any tears over this sorry
plight of the “elder statesmen.” But youth
has a right to look into the future and to de-
mand to know if there is any way out of this
impasse.

Of course there is a way out! An honorable
way, a practical way, a democratic way—and

a peaceful way.

Even now, at this late hour, the American
people, if they act resolutely and unitedly, can
seize the helm of our ship of state and reverse
its course. -

Those in power who~have proved that they
can steer our country only to disaster are no
longer ﬁt to rule. It is time for the people

29

As my English friends would say, usually
I am a pretty jolly old fellow. But when a well-
meaning kibitzer urged‘ me to make a “youth-
f_u ” speech tonight——I sobered up. To be a

« . ‘young, American at this critical ‘ turn of the

). half century is no joke. i

o The young are often serious", and have
reason to be so; In every individual’s life, the
important choices, the big decisions are made
in the period of youth. But, for your genera-
tion; that goes double. What you decide in

‘ the next few years will determine your whole
future. In large measure the fate of all our
people—-young and ‘old—is in your hands.

Let mevsay right off the bat that we Com-
munists don’t believe this _country’s “elder

“21 QUESTIONS ABOUT

answered by

EUGENE DENNIS

Just before Eugene Dennis,‘General Secretary
of the Communist Party, was imprisoned on a
trumped-up contempt charge, he answered 21
questions submitted by the editors of CHAL-
LENGE.

“Can Young Americans Look to a Secure Fu-
ture?”; “Can Young Americans Inﬂuence U.S.
Foreign Policy?’’; ‘Why Should Anybody in
Our Country Want War?”—these are some of
the questions Dennis answers clearly and pow-

erfully.

believe they can shape their own lives and
perform miracles if need be. We live in an
age when this belief is stronger than ever.
This is an age when the working-class youth
is shaping the life of whole nations, an age
of real miracles performed" by millions (of
youth. \

The “elder statesmen” who boast that they .

are going to decide everything for America’s
youth are whistling in the dark. But it is not
going to be easy for your generation to put
these “elder statesmen” in their place.

They have got your lives all mapped out for

you, and have even calculated how many of
those lives are “expendable.” Let us have a
look at these plans.

Things to Come

First, I give you a picture of the shape of
things to come, drawn in a recent issue of that

authoritative big-business magazine — U.S. -

News and World Report. '
“Youth will face a radically changed out-

look. Military service is to become a require-l ‘

ment of every young man between the ages of

L 18» and 21. In‘ peace, the service would be for /

one year, in war it would be indeﬁnite. The‘
draft is likely to go «on even after the war ‘in
Korea ends. War for a long time is likely to
remain a threat that affects the lives of all
young people. There will always be a ‘chance
of following a military career.” ,.

‘ So, that settles that. You are going to have

i a military career. As Gen. Hershey put it

bluntly, yours is to be a generation of “killers.”

For a short while, you were told that this
military career would involve little more than
learning how to push buttons, and order the
youth of other nations into battle. But the
myth of the push-button war was the ﬁrst
casualty of the Korean adventure. With it
wentrthe myth that the youth of other nations,

whose “elder statesmen” had decided that

they were to serve as *America’s mercenaries,
would abide by that decision.

An Ugly War
A few weeks ago, the Paciﬁc correspondent

for Time magazine spelled out what he called
“the ugly story of an ugly war.” Incidentally,
5

» the workers in the oldernempire countries of ‘N

Europe call this kind of war a “dirty war.”
Your military career, this correspondent for

Time magazine wrote, will involve you in a

war “alien to .the American tradition and

shocking to, the American mind. For our _ 

men in Korea are waging this war as they
are forced to wage it, and as they will be
forced to wage any war against the Commu-
nists anywhere in Asia.” ‘
This ugly war, he said, forces “upon our
men in the ﬁeld acts and attitudes of the ut-

most savagery. This means not the usual, in-

evitable savagery of combat in the ﬁeld, but
savagery in detail—the blotting out of villages

A where the enemy may be hiding; the shooting

and shelling of ‘refugees who may include
North Koreans in the anonymous white cloth-
ing of the Korean countryside.” ‘
And, he went on,’ “there is savagery by
proxy, the savagery of the South Korean po-
lice and South Korean marines upon whom
we rely for contact with the population. . . .

The;South Korean police and the South Ko-

rean marines whom I observed in front line
areas arebrutal. They murder to save them-
_ 6

selves the trouble of escorting prisoners to the
rear; they murder civilians simply to get them
out of the way or to avoid the trouble of
searching’ and cross-examining them. And they
extort information by means so brutal that

 they cannot be described.”

You are offered a career alien to the Ameri-
can‘ tradition and shocking to the American
mind. If you protest, you are denounced as
“un-American.” , F

The powers that be claim they will decide
whether you pursue this career of savagery
in Asia or in Europe—or in some one of these
United States, perhaps in the South. But what
ever the terrain, acts and attitudes of the ut-
most savagery would be forced upon you. The
Nazis and Iapanese militarists are being re-
armed, and the butcher Franco bribed, so
that you need not want for proxies to commit
your savagery. In Formosa as in Korea, in
Africa asin Asia, in Italy as ,in France, the
countryside would swarm with your enemies,
and everywhere you would face the hatred
of the people whose land you have invaded

The Atom-Maniacs

Recently, powerful voices have professed to
offer you an alternative to this hideous and
dishonorable fate. The alternative bears the
deceptive name of “preventive war.”

I don’t know how many atom ibomlbsl the.
