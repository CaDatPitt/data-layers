 

U3 ADOPT ARNONPS VIETNAM PROPOSAL:

At the Berkeley teach-in May 22,.a number of proposals were made by the
various speakers about what Americans could §g_to help stop the Vietnam war.
Many of them represent the depth of feeling citizens of this country are begin-
ning to experience over the role of their government there.‘ - . »

Many of the proposals, though admdrably militant, were of'a pacifist
nature. One that was not was made by M. S, Arnoni, editor of the left-liberal
"The Minority of One," (P. 0, Box 544, Passaic, N. J¢)°¢:§§ called for American
volunteers to fight with the National Liheration‘Fronf*"Viet Cong“)against
their oppressors, whether puppets of the Americans or the American troops them»
selves. Thisis sternum; mas., seems "adventuristic" at first, but on reflec-
tion one can discern a number of sound arguments which, it is felt, rather out-
weigh the disadvantages. 1 ‘ ' ”

1. First of all, it is apparent that the situation developing in Viet-
nam is an historically unique.one, one fraught with such dangerous consequences
to mankind, that extraordinary measures are called for. A special responsibility
for taking special measures devolves upon Americans themselves, since it is
"their" government that has brought it all on and "their" press-with a few
honorable exceptions—~that has made it all possible by keeping the American
public well lied~to. The dangers referred to are the persistent reports that
the U. S., by continually expanding its war, is seeking to involve China, whose
involvement would then be used as a pretext to bomb China with nuclear weapons.
Some pro—Administration spokesmen have gone so far as to say the opportunity to
use nuclear bombs on China would be "welcomed," though they usually hasten to
add that ”hopefully'the Soviet Union would not be drawn in to the conflict.

2. One does not have to have a particular political viewpoint to
want to support this proposal: a very strong commitment to a very limited poli-
tical position is all that is necessary-that of democracy. The program of the
NLF is essentially the unification of their country and the free elections pro-
mised them by the Geneva Agreements but prevented by the U, S, through its puppet
Diem and his successors, land reform (an anti-feudal but pro-capitalist measure),
and independence of foreign domination. The program is not radical because the
Front is made up of over 20 different political parties and organizations of
national, religious or social groups. It is only fair to warn beforehand, how-
ever, that a prospective vo1unteer‘s commitment to democracy should embrace
socialism if the majority wants it. Otherwise he may feel "betrayed" over what
actually develops in South Vietnam latero For we have seen from the Cuban
example that an armed population is capable of forcing a leadership to abandon
its reformist program and take the socialist path‘ And given the urge of
imperialism to isolate, blockade and continually attack it, this means some
sort of alliance and friendly relations with the rest of the socialist camp.

3. The limited, though militant, nature of the commitment involved
makes the proposal especially suited for a broad-based, radical organization
like Students for a Democratic Society or the May 2nd Movement, or some coali-
tion of them, to take up. The important thing is for some group to offer to
serve as an organizing center for sending American volunteers, regardless of
their affiliation or political views, to the Viet Cong,

It would be good even if some avowedly Marxist group took up the idea,

«because that would still have an electrifying effect on U, S. and world public

opinion, but better if the media could not simply dismiss them as "reds.V, It.
would be ironic—justice for imperialism, that continually combats democratic
revolutions by calling them “Comunist," to be exposed before the world by'a
non-Communist organization that is so convinced that Government is lying about
the democratic nature of the struggle in that beleaguered country that some of
its members are-even willing to risk their lives helping the South Vietnamese
people achieve their democratic aims. ‘ G. A

4. The real.significance of the action is that the people of the
world-and of this country would see, and feel, the intensity of concern about
U. S. policy in Vietnam that is_now beginning to spread into ever wider layers
of the American population, It would have an impact similar to that of the
American students who exposed to their countrymen and to people everywhere the
fact that our Government feared letting their own people see the Cuban Revolu-
tion to such an extent that it tried to prohibit them by law and, for the first
time, by a stiff penalty. (Before this, only a very tiny number knew about the
prohibition-those who somehow got interested and read about Cuba_or tried to
arrange to see the Revolution for themselves.) '

As Adolpho Gilly, left-wing Argentine journalist of the nowafamous
articles on the Cuban Revolution and the Guatemalan guerrilla movement {yggghly
353333, Oct. 1964; May and June 1965) put it:. "Any action that unites a seg~
ment of the American population, no matter how small it may seem, with the global
revolution, represents and introduces in the United States an immense strength,
in the same way that the Algerian combatant did not represent only the fire power
of his gun, but the constant and powerful action of an entire people." (From
Gilly's introduction to "Studies in a Dying Colonialism," by Fritz Fanon).

- lPerhaps Gilly had an action something like this in mind.

5. It should not be forgotten that Vietnam is not "just another"
example of decaying imperialism trying to hold a down-trodden andirnpcverished
people in feudal bondage. We are at a critical juncture of this whole process.
It represents the maximum effort to contain the global revolution, that is, to

'keep the world's-2,000 million over-exploited people in varying states of starva-

tion and degradation. .Imperialism knows that the whole world is watching_this
contest; that if a people, starting out unarmed, can defeat the most advanced
military power ever heard of, all of the rest of the two-thirds of the world's
population who find themselves in the same condition will know it can be done
and will proceed to do the same, This is why imperialism stoops to any action,
no matter how barbarous, in order to crush the Vietnamese people. It is not
primarily concerned with its "image." On the contrary, it is more concerned
that the people around the world fear it-ot "respect" it, as the pro-imperial-

'ist’ apologists of the news media put it. Thatls why they do not mind letting

out some of the facts of U. S.-approved torture and U. S,-implemented wanton
slaughter there: they want to let.the "wretched of the earth" know_it is not
worth it to try to change their situation. i ‘ A

The Wall Street Journal recently supplied support for this thesis. To
concern about the U. S, lmage in Latin America after the assault on the Domini-
can Republic, an unidentified Washington spokesman "confidently" told them:

"The use of force when it works discourages more communists that it creates."

The great debt humanity owes to the South Vietnamese people is that by
their unparalleled courage and resistance they are showing that imperialist
force won't work. The Viet Cong is doing our job for us. It behooves us to do
more than assume a verbal posture against the imperialist machine. If we can
take an action that will do far more, we should do so even if it means aasnuning a
risk substantially higher than involved l-inhn verbal opposition or in civil
disobedience type activities.

6. Does the Viet Cong want this kind of help? Judge for yourself
from the declaration made by the Central Comittee of the South Vietnam National
Liberation Front on March 22, 1965, in which it stated that it is "ready tg
accept all assistance both moral and material, including weapons and all other
war materials from the socialist countries, the nationalist countries as well as
all the international organizations and peace-loving people the world over.”
Further, "If the United States imperialists continue to commit United States
combat troops and those of their satellites to South Vietnam, and continue to
extend the war to North Vietnam and Laos, the South Vietnam Liberation Front
will call 33 the peoples of various countries 53 send youths and army meg to

South Vietnam 53 side with—the South Vietnamese people in annihilating the

common enemy." (Emphases added.)

The international response did not wait for a specific call. Perhaps
one of the reasons was this statement about their struggle, included in the NLF
declaration: (referring to the U. S. and its puppet government)

For nearly 11 years now they have conducted over 160,000 raids
big or small, killed nearly 170,000 persons, wounded or disabled
by tortures nearly 800,000 others, detained over 400,000 persons
in more than 1,000 jails, raped tens of thousands of women
including old women, children and religious believers, disem-
bowelled, plucked out livers and biles of the victims and buried
alive over 5,000 persons, razed to the ground a large number of,
villages, herded over 5 million persons into 8,000 concentration
camps disguised as "prosperity zones," "resettlement centers,"
"strategic hamlets" and the like, sprayed toxic chemicals on

mny areas, destroying hundreds of thousands of hectares of crops
and fruit trees and affecting tens of thousands of persons. They
have also demolished thousands of pagodas, churches, holy sees or
temples, killing tens of thousands of religious believers.

Under the iron heels of the cruel American ag ressors and their
lackeys, the beautiful and-‘fertile land cf aclut ‘ V'ii{_tnam,h§.sv‘lbeen
turned into a land of ruins and desolation.‘ The barbarous fascist
regime of the U. S. imperialists and their flunkeys in south

Viet Nam is even more cruel than the Hitlerite fascist regime or
the dark regime in medieval times. (Faking Review, April 2, p. 16)

 

Can we accept this just because they say it? .Perhaps not. But we have
seen enough pictures in the pro—imperialist press of the U. S.~sponsored govern-
ment troops torturing "suspected" Viet Cong that it becomes entirely believable
that much worse goes on that cannot be reported.‘ S u i " '- *

The international response includes at least the following perticular
itemsz. - V

a. On March 25 the dhinese.stated that the NLF declaration is a "just

condemnation of U. S. imperialism ... a clarion call to the people throughout

the world to rise in support of the_south Vietnamese people and defeat U. S.”
imperialism. The 650 million Chinese people have always.regarded the_struggle
of the south Vietnamese people as their own struggle and support for the just
cause of the south Vietnamese people as their sacred international duty. "We
now solemnly declare that we Chinese people respond with resolution to the state-
ment of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front and will join the people of
the whole world in sending all necessary material aid, including arms and all
other war materials, to the heroic south Vietnamese people who are fighting
fearlessly. At the same time, we are ready to send our own man, whenever the
south Vietnamese people want them, to fight together with the south Vietnamese
people to wipe out the U. S. aggressors.... ‘ l 7

"The people of the socialist countries and peace-loving peoples of
the world have the unshirkable duty to give all-out support and assistance to
the south Vietnamese people in their heroic fight.” - '

b. The United Democratic.Front of North Korea said that it wouldi

i send aid immediately to the NLF and men when it called for themn,.It said the

whole population of North Korea should be ready to mobilize to go to the aid of
South Vietnam. . . . " ‘ “

c. Radio Havana announced a Cuban Government declaration of aid and

’men, and said this would be in line with Fidel's call of March 13 for full
.military aid from the socialist countries to Vietnam—»at whatever risk this may

entail.

d. Soviet leaders had earlier warned that many Soviet citizens had
applied to fight as volunteers in Vietnam and that the Soviet Government would
“consider” these applications. After the NLF appeal the Soviets announced that
if necessary it would permit volunteers to go to North Vietnam to fight.

A e. The Cuban Union of.Medical Students offered to send medical aid
teams to South Vietnam. s. l’ ’ s «

. f. ‘The Cuban Government announced that “hundreds of letters a day"
were coming in from Cuban workers supporting‘f;dg;I.s strong stand on socialist
camp aid to Vietnam. Also, that "countless" offers from workers volunteering to

,go to Vietnam were being received.

‘.g.. Fidel's speech calling for men and arms to Vietnam and for the
socialist camp to "run all the risks that are necessary for Vietnam" was reprinted
in full by Pravda and the Party press in Poland, France and Mexico.

» 1. The Soviet Association for Solidarity with the Peoples of Asia
and Africa issued a statement saying that no one should doubt the willingness
of Soviet volunteers to fight shoulder to shoulder with their South Vietnamese

I ’ brothers against the comon enemy.

m. North Vietnam Radio reported that tens of thousands of Asians and

other peoples around the globe have been volunteering to fight in South Vietnam.

the Viet Cong. g , ‘ ‘ »

'Comunist party delegation to discuss joint action against ‘imperialist aggres-
sion.'" (April 12, p. 2)

o. The Communist trade union federation of India has put out a call
for volunteers and said that it will send "thousands and thousands" to South
Vietnam to fight for the Viet Cong.

p. Cyrus Eaton said that in a May 19 interview with two Soviet
deputy foreign ministers, they warned that the USSR would give military aid to
North Vietnam "in increased measure, and Soviet volunteers will go." He also
said that Hungary has given citizens official permission to volunteer to fight
‘in Vietnam. (National_Guardian, June 5, p. l) ’ »

7. There~is one important reason why a large contingent of Americans
cannot be expected to volunteer. That reason is that participants will almost
certainly lose their U. S. citizenship, even native-born citizens, under the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952-——an act passed as”a futile attempt to

‘A prevent just this sort of thing. Last year the Supreme Court, in the first
* constitutional test of this provision of the Act, approved a native-born citizen's
being deprived of his citizenship for having fought in Fidel‘s guerrilla move-
» ment. ‘The Court could reverse itself but it probably will not.

But a legal sanction like this has no effect on an organization or
‘individuals handling the recruiting or publicity aspects of the proposal,
and should not be a deterrent to them. ‘And as far as its effect on the number
oftparticipants goes, even if only 10 or 15 volunteered it would not matter.
,_1n"fact,the heavy penalty for participation and risks involved can be turned
‘ to positive advantage. The more severe the penalties to befall the participants,

 

the greater the impact on people's-minds around the globe of the dedication of
the volunteers and their firm belief in the '%ighhness .of their action. A_,
(This is no small thing, considering the doubts people everywhere are beginning"
to have about U. S, involvement in Vietnami) :In like manner the threat of 5
years imprisonment and a $5,000 £ine—-and the U; S. imposed.necessity of having
to go thousands of miles out of the way to get there——made'the American stu- "
dents’ defiance in traveling to Cuba all the more.striking, ,Lastly, for those
to whom not being able to come back to the U. S. would be a crushing blow, it_‘
may be of some solace that they will be able to return to a rad cally re-struc-'
tured America-—one that may indeed not be so far off.‘ Listen t latest thoughts
of Huberman and Sweezy of the §ggghlZ_Review about it_(June 1965, pp} 5-6):

The United States as the leading imperialist power is bound to
get deeper and deeper into the morass of global counter-revolu-
‘ tionsry war. And as Vietnam is already proving, this war.

cannot be confined to aerial bombing andlstrafing. To an ever
increasing extent American armies are going to be conscripted and
sent into the jungles and deserts and mountains of Asia, Africa,
and Latin America. American casualties will munt from the hun-
dreds to the thousands; from the thousands to the tens and hun-
dreds of thousands; and, yes, to the_millions. But there will be
no victories and never an end in sight. The Vietnamese peasants
have been fighting imperialist invaders for more than 20 years 4
now and give every sign of determination to fight another 20 if
necessary. And they are basically no different from the rest of
those whom Frantz Fanon called the ‘damned of the earth,‘ ‘A man
can die only once, and it is better to die for a cause than from
starvation and disease. -

Is it not clear that the American_people, so tame and docile now,
must sooner or later be revolted by this senseless carnage? And
» when they are and begin to grape for a way out of the morass, to
whom will they listen? To those who have so grievously misled
them? To those who have assured them that everything is really»
. all right except for a few missing reforms? Or to those who
have consistently told.them that the whole system of capitalism
and imperialism is rotten and anti-human and was bound to lead
to endless bloodshed and suffering? We may not be able to over-
-throw this system for some time to come, but right now we can
tell the truth .... 

Tell the truth-—that capitalism and imperialism are doomed, that
the socialist revolution is the only road to salvation.... The
alternative is a shallow kind of reformiam that can only strengthen
the system of exploitation and injustice which produces and repro-
duces so much unnecessary misery and suffering in the world today.

8. Do not underestimate the.symbolic importance of even a small group
volunteering from the "entrails of the monster," as Jose Marti referred to the
U. S. From a physical standpoint it has no meaning; it might even come out nega-
tive for the NLF on balance, considering language difficulties and what not. ,_
(However, the language might even be useful. The Liberation Radio of the NLF"

 

 

 

ought to be about ready to broadcast in English to-the American troops, now that
that's who they may be fighting mostly. The aggressive plans of "our" govern-
ment could well collapse from under it if American volunteers could get the
truth across to the troops in a persuasive way.) »

But the NLF knows well the importance to a struggle of such gestures_
from every other standpoint, This is why, in their customary inoffensive way,
they have said they are "ready to accept" such aid from any who will offer it.
(Imperialism is also well aware of the importance of symbolic gestures. Thus
it constantly pressures its fellow capitalist governments to send contingents
and token aid-even if they are not secure enough internally to send massive aid
-in order to try to make it look like the whole "free world" condemns the cur-
rent "Communist aggression.“)

One last remark on how an action like the proposal under discussion
here can affect the consciousness and understanding, the will and determination
of hundreds of millions of human beings——a thought to be seriously considered
by a small group whose ability to intervene and measurably affect the course of
history is ordinarily quite circumscribed, at least in this period.

When the American students were in Cuba two years ago they learned
that when Latin American students there first heard of plans for the trip they
were much impressed with the idea but sceptical of its coming off. The Ameri-
cans thought they meant the U. S. or one of its stooge governments would physi-
cally prevent them from getting there. No, they said, their first thought was
that the Student Committee would never be able to enlist a group of American
youth to go, particularly in view of the possible penalties involved. They said
they had come to believe they would never get any meaningful help from within

_ the imperialist heartland and would have to depend on their own forces in their

struggles. The impact success of the trip had on Latin American youth, they
insisted, was profound and signaled to the oppressed of their countries that a
new stage was opening, when internal opposition would become a substantial
obstacle to U. S. ability to prevent revolution.

. 9. It is easy to understand the qualms and hesitations one may have
in embarking upon such a project. Saying to your government that its troops are
doing wrong and should get out is one thing, Saying publicly that its troops
are doing so much evil and that the political system has degenerated to such an
extent that ordinary forms of opposition are more or less meaningless, and that
one is willing to go fight against those troops, is another. Make no mistake
about it, however, such an action will inevitably come, with a couple million
troops trying to hold 2 billion ever more determined people in poverty and
starvation, and being required to use ever more revolting methods of mss annihi-
lation in the attempt, such a reaction to this madness is a certainty. When
well-known professors of history, such as Staughton Lynd of Yale, can say the

‘things he did at the Berkeley teach-in, you know that-—quite apart from Arnoni's

proposale—something is in the wind.

Professor Lynd called for a "non-violent revolution" for students con-
cerned enough about the U. S. role in Vietnam to want to do something more than
has been done so far. He advocated "civil disobedience so persistent and so

 

 

 

».massive that the Tuesday lunch club which runs this country-—Johnson, Rusk,

McNamara, Bundy-will forthwith resign;""Lynd correctly believes in "the power
of world public opinion," and says, "one reason I favor ctvil disobedience in’
Washington this summer is that it will have’internetional.visibility.” Further:

That professors organize themselves in a parallel Senate Foreign
_Relations Committee, hold the hearings in Washington the Senate
comittee has failed to hold,'and continue until Bundy shows up.

iThat concerned persons conduct a teach—in on the steps of the
Pentagon after leafleting government employees throughout Wash;
Mington. The Committee for Nonviolent Action has planned this for

\That_there be convened in America a new war-crimes tribunal, made
up of men whose spiritual authority is unquestionable, such as
Vinoba Bhave, Danilo Dolci, Pastor Niemoeller, Michael Scott, and
_ hopefully Martin Luther King Jr., who would conduct an inquiry
into the moral responsibility for the horror in Vietnam3$‘

That there come together in Washington a new continental congress,
made up-of representatives from community unions, Freedom parties
and campus groups, which would say in effect: This is a deeper-
ate‘ situation; our government no longer represents us; let us
seeiwhat needs to be done. Under its aegis mass civil disobedience
could take place on such symbolic dates as Hiroshima Day and

Labor Day.V ‘ ‘

Finally, I believe in the power of nonviolence. In_the 18403
Thoreau said that one man ready to die could stop slavery in
America. _; think 3;; 9; 33 here this weekend should search our
hearts and souls for the courage_and claritywgg spirit;£g_gg to
the White House, to go to the Oakland Army Terminal on June 22,
if possible to go 52 Vietnam and stand 33 front 3; the flame
.throwers and say: ‘

'If blood must bg spilled, let i£_bg mine and stop killing Viet-
namese children. ‘lg you must search and destroy, letlmg save you
the trouble, here ;_gg;' And 3; you are worried that the natives
overseas are restless, gg want you to know that the natives at
‘home are restless, too, and perhaps you should make 3 contingency
plan to keep some.g§_the marines here to deal withlgg.’ (National

, Guardian, June 5, p. 3, emphases added.) .

Viiloré Negro attorney Conrad Lynn announced at the Yale Socialist.

“ Symposium (April 30 - May_2) that several American Negro militants had left for
North Vietnam to fight in the international brigade being organized there. This
is good, but the Arnoni proposal fits this desperate Vietnam situation even
more appropriately. The only thing is that the organizers should be sure to
» get as much publicity as possible and not let the press bury it. This may be
what happened with Conrad Lynn's announcement, for apparently only the_National
Guardian picked it up. ' ' « V ~ ' . V . 'h

 

 

, The way to get maximm notice would be to call a press conference to
which all representatives of the media, especially the foreign press agencies,
would be invited.— No particulars should be revealed"beforéhand, unless in very
general terms, like "an important statement regarding our opposition to the war
in Vietnam." Actually it is very difficult for the U. S. media to bury an item
like this once it gets any coverage at-all, say, even in Europe. The press has

.contradictions of its own, and even though it is mainly responsible for the

brainwashing in America, still in its race for profits with competitors it will
often publish news which does not exactly serve the long-run interests of the
profit system. This proposal is so newsworthy that once it gets out to any one

,of the media, newsman will be scrambling over each other to get details and

statements. While in Cuba the students were constantly being phoned by news-
papers from all over the U. S. -

In the news conference a point should be made of the fact that the
organizers understand that volunteers will probably have their citizenship
taken away, that no one likes this, but that the political importance of the
action is such that it must be carried out anyway. This will also prevent getting
volunteers who later back out for this reason. When questions about patriotism
are brought up in the press conference, full advantage should be taken of the
opportunity to publicize how patriotism is invariably invoked by scoundrels to
cover up their sins and that, anyway, what is going on in the world is not a
clash between countries, except only superficially. It is a civil war on a
global scale (even Adlai Stevenson, the liberal, said this), and we simply find
ourselves on the majority side of this civil war. Further, that we think the
vast bulk of the American people, including the American armd forces, belong on
our side and will eventually see through the brainwashing and come over.

11. A parallel appeal for funds to send the volunteers should be

made. Given the widespread revulsion to the war, there should be many willing to
contribute who would not be willing to volunteer or even take lesser actions.
This would ease the strain on the NLF's no doubt limited, if not non-existent,
foreign exchange resources. Any excess could simply be donated to them to help
them win, and.as some small indemnification for the unspeakable crimes done to
them by the U. S. government.

Fund-raising activity, as well as open recruiting, would insure the
failure of a news blackout. For those game enough, recruiting stations could
be set up not only on campuses but downtown ("The Viet Cong Wants Youl').

12. _The NLF now has diplomatic missions with A number of countries.
After the public offer is made responding to their appeal of March 22, actual
contact could probably be effected most easily with their offices in Havana
or Algiers.

13. It is suggested that the proposal be presented as a smashing
rebuff and answer from American youth to Johnson's lying and hypocritical
attempt at Johns Hopkins to take the steam out of the campus rebellion over
Vietnam!

discussion program, Dr. Amiya Chakravarty, a professor of philosophy at Boston
