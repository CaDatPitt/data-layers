.., ,. , a ﬁonsmner vancc
on my Council,

 

JOHN ZINGARO believes in people and principle,
not big money and patronage.

He purposely doesn’t own a car. He uses mass
transit.

He rents . . . a modest apartment in Oakland.

As membership coordinator of the Semple Street
Food Co—op, he helps people control the cost and
quality of their food.

He has a journalism degree from Point Park College
and serves on the boards of the Health Systems
Agency of Southwestern Pennsylvania and the
South Oakland Citizens Council.

He is an active member of the Tri—State Conference
on Steel and the Group Against Smog & Pollution.

John Zingaro has worked towards his ideals as a
VISTA Volunteer, journalist and executive director
of the Pittsburgh Neighborhood Alliance.

Now, at age 27., he hopes to continue his work as a
member of City Council.

THE ISSUES are what they’ve always been .
people trying to secure the basics of life: ajob, food,
fuel, health-care and housing.

The worn-out programs of the Democratic Party
and the hands—off approach ofthe Republican Party
have been unequal to the challenge.

We need a long—range commitment to begin
working towards a more just economic system in
which large corporations that disregard the public
good will be curbed.

We need to address issues not primarily in terms of
funding but in terms of community.

We need to build a “peace” economy -- one geared
towards human needs and a proper use of
environmental resources.

We need these ideals. Without them, we allow
ourselves to be overtaken by cynicism and apathy in
the guise of “being practical.”

JOHN ZINGARO and the Consumer Party he
represents will work to:

SAVE INDUSTRIAL JOBS!

Use the power of eminent domain and the city’s
unspent Community Development funds to
purchase, for example, the J&L Hazelwood mill
from the runaway LTV Corp. Such a mill could be
run by a worker-community corporation.

SUPPORT UNDERPAID OFFICE WORKERS!

Employees of the large corporations and
universities in Pittsburgh are mostly underpaid and
unorganized.

SET FAIR RENTS!

A serious program of rent-control must be
employed against large landlords.

RECOVER FEDERAL TAXES!

The City, County and School District should stop
contending for a shrinking pool of property taxes . . .
and should join in an effort to recover federal
income taxes from the excessive military budget.

SUPPORT MINORITY REPRESENTATION!
Members of Council should be elected by district.

LOWER HEALTH COSTS!

The answer to the cost of health—care is not bigger
hospitals but prevention -- through education,
nutrition and recreation.

JOHN ZINGARO has:

organized involvement by Magee-Women’s
Hospital in the health services program at Schenley
High;

 led investigation of efforts by unsavory interstate
organization to purchase North Side nursing home,
resulting in the chain’s withdrawal from the area;

. organized city-wide forums for neighborhood
groups on issues such as land vs. wage tax, small
merchants vs. PPG Corp., health-care in the
neighborhoods, redlining and desegregation.

supported low-paid hospital workers at the
University Health Center by walking their picket
lines and helping to organize rallies and fund-
raisers;

 conducted workshops for neighborhood groups
on the city's use of federal funds;

...has shown in specific terms how the military
budget causes cutbacks in city schools, mass
transit, police protection and neighborhood
services.

THE CONSUMER PARTY is a Pennsylvania party
organized 15 years ago.

It began as a grass-roots, consumer-rights
movement in Philadelphia and has steadily
attracted voters throughout the state.

The Consumer Party is affiliated nationally with the
Citizens Party, which ran scientist and author Dr.
Barry Commoner for president in 1980.

Dr. Commoner now serves as co-chairman of the
Citizens Party.
