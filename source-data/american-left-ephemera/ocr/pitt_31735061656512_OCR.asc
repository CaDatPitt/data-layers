traidition that preparedness prez/erzts war. That is worth some-

thing.”

In similar vein, General Pershing, in addressing an American
Legion Convention in New York in 1921, declared: “It would
appear that the lessons of the past six years should be enough to
convince anybody of the danger of nations striding up and down
the earth armed to the teeth. But no one nation can reduce arma-
ments unless all do. Isn’t it then time for an awakening among
enlightened people to the end that the leading powers may reach
some rational agreement which would not only relieve the world
of this terrible load, but which in itself would be a long step to-
ward the prevention of war?”

That step has not been taken; instead, the nations with one ac-
cord have gone forward with ever increasing war preparations,
with the knowledge that such preparation will likely result in
war——the very thing for which they are preparing—under the
guise of promoting peace. I f the armament race continues unabated,
war will bet/2e inevitable result.

II
WHO WANTS WAR?

1 .WAR PROFITS.

Forlevery three American soldiers killed in battle during the
world war, one‘ American millionaire was made at home. This
startling statement is more than true, for the government reports
show 50,000 American battle deaths and 21,000 American mil-
lionaires produced by the war. ' A

One American munition firm—-the Dupont Company—sold
$1,245,585,000 worth of explosives to the United States and the
Allies from 1914 to 1918. The war-time profits of this one firm
amounted to $255,87I,625.93. The value of its stock increased 5000
percent as a result of the war. Six members of the Dupont family
received individual incomes in 1918 exceeding $1,000,000, accord-
ing to the Government income tax report. In the three years prior
to the world war, the United States Steel Corporation earned $180,
000,000; but during 19I6—17-18 its net proﬁts were $621,000,000.

Similar profits were reaped by every American firm engaged in
the manufacture of «munitions or other war supplies. These same
people who make money as a result of wholesale human slaughter
in time of war, are also the chief promoters of the huge prepared-
ness programs of the nations. They are the loudest shouters of patri-
otic shibboleths—when appropriation bills for war preparations
are before Congress. They are aptly described as ','merc/umt: of
death.”

The Senate investigation of war profits and the munition
industry grew out of the insistent demand of the American Legion
for legislation. to “take the profit out of war.” It was precipitated
by the aroused public opinion against machinations of munition
makers in peace time.

2. MUNITION MAKERS INDICTED.

The munition expose already has brought to light some startling
and , sinister facts. We have had. ugly revelations of graft, greed
and heartless exploitation. It has been proved that often war is
nothing but a “racket,” enriching a few with money gained at
the price of the blood of millions. The makers and exporters of mu-
nitions know no Fatherland, and have no respect for conventions,
treaties or agreements.

On signing the Nye Resolution for the munition investigation,
President Roosevelt declared:

[5]

 

“The peoples of many countries are being taxed to the point
or poverty and starvation in order to enable governments to engage
in a mad race in armament which, if permitted to continue, may
well result in war. This grave menace to the peace of the world
is due in no small measure to the uncontrolled activities of the
manufacturers and merchants -of engines of destruction, and it
must be met by the concerted action of the peoples of all nations.”

Reporting the findings of the first section of the Senate hearings.
H. C. Engelbrecht in his book: “ONE HELL OF A BUSINESS,”

gives this summary: ‘

“An American munition company paid commissions to a Com-
mander of the U. S. Navy and a Colonel in the U. S. Army while
they were in active service.

The King of England took a hand in the sale of British muni-
tions.

An American munitions company raised its prices to the Cuban
Government at the request of a Cuban attache to include com-
missions for him.

One American company evaded the Arms Embargo on mu-
nitions to South America by the device of antedating orders.

An American missionary sold poison gas to Ecuador between
prayers.

Shortly after the world war, an American cruiser was sent to
the port of one of our former enemies to demonstrate our new
guns and equipment. American equipment is demonstrated to
foreign powers by the American Government turning over its
proving grounds to munitions companies.

William T. Stone, VVashington Representative of the Foreign
Policy Association, reduced the testimony at the Senate hearings
to the following outstanding revelations:

“Treaties and arms embargoes have been defied by private
armament interests.

Bribery is utilized in the selling of arms.
Arms are sold simultaneously to both sides during war.
Armament firms promote peace-time armament races.-

Munitions lobbies’ are organized to support military prepara-
tions and oppose arms restrictions. ’ A C '

Patent and sales agreements between British,German and Ameri-
ican arms ﬁrms provide for exchange of secret processes and divi-
sion of proﬁts. “

Government policies of national defense and foreign relations

[5]

 

are inﬂuenced by secret agreements between private munitions
interests.
-The War and Navy Departments of the United States promote
private sales of munitions abroad.
Under existing laws, the U. S. Government is powerless to ex-
ercise real control over the export of arms.” I
In 1921 a special commission of the League of nations con-
ducted an investigation into the activities of private munition
makers in connection with the world war. The commission gave
as its conclusion from the evidence studied the following facts;
“Armament firms have been active in promoting war scares.
Armament firms have attempted to bribe government officials.
Armament firms have disseminated false reports concerning the
military and navel programs of various countries in order to stim-
ulate armament expenditures.
Armament firms have sought to influence public opinion through
the control of newspapers.
Armament ﬁrms have organized international armament rings
through which the armaments race has been accentuated by
playing off one country against another.”

3. CURBING MUNITION MAKERS

Two major plans are being considered for curbing the private
manufacturers of munitions. First, a governmental monopoly of
the munition industry, or a strict governmental control under a
license scheme; second, international control and supervision of
both manufacture and export, under a permanent commission at
Geneva.

The Roosevelt Administration is committed to a unification of
both plans: government monopoly or license, plus international
comtrol and mperz/z'sz'on. In his special message to the Senate on
signing the Nye Resolution, President Roosevelt said:

“The private and uncontrolled manufacture of arms and muni-
tions and the traffic therein has become a serious source of inter-
national discord and strife. It is not possible, however, effectively
to control such an evil‘ by the isolated action of any one country.
The enlightened opinion of the world has long realized that this
is a ﬁeld in which international action is necessary.”

At the same time the President asked the Senate to-ratify the
1925 International iMunition Convention, held for nine years
without action in the Foreign Relations Committee, although
ratified. by over forty other nations. In Iune, 1934, the Senate voted

[E 7' ]}E

as the President requested,‘ but attached reservations which have
held up completion of America’s ratiﬁcation of the treaty -by the
State Department. On Feb.‘2r, 1935, President‘ Roosevelt resub-

-mitted this treaty to the Senate. . ‘

In June, 1934, the American delegation in the ;World Disarm-
ament Conference at Geneva proposed a much stronger conven-
tion than that of 1925 for the international control and supervision
of armament manufacture and export. This proposed convention
was adopted, in principle, by the World Disarmament Conference;
and on November 20, 1934, the United States delegation proposed.
certain strengthening amendments. -~ ‘

.The American proposal for international control and super-
vision of munition manufacture and export provides:

1. That national responsibility for the manufacture of and traffic
in arms be speciﬁed in the Convention.

2. That qualitative and quantitative limitation in the Convention
be the primary bases for measures for the restriction and con-
trol of the manufacture and export of arms.

3. That the manufacture of and the traffic in arms be subjected to
national control by means of:

A. General licenses for manufacture;
B. Special visas for export;
C. Publicity;
I. For orders for manufacture,
2.For all production, both state and private,
3. For exports and imports,
4. Prompt transmission to the Permanent Disarma-
ment Commission by signatories of information on:
a) All licenses as soon as issued;
(b) All orders as soon as received by licensee;
(c) Shipments for export as soon as made;
((1) Annual reports of all production and imports.

4. That some international body, such as the Permanent Disarm-
ament Commission, be empowered to coordinate the execu-
tion of the various provisions of the Convention.

‘Summarizing the American memorandum, on behalf of the
American delegation, Ambassador Hugh VVilson stated: .
“We have endeavored so to amend the categories of the 1925

Convention on Traffic in Arms as to fit modern circumstances.

[3]

 

 

We have endeavored to bring the full light of publicity‘ to bear
upon production in arms. both State and private, upon the export
and-import of arms-. -We have endeavored to provide-that this pub-
licity should be transmitted to a permanent central organization
functioning in Geneva, We have endeavored to. provide that this
organization will have the-duty of collating, ‘examining, and pub-
lishing this information received’; of questioningethe governments

further, if necessary, on those matters within t.he.scope of the

Convention; of inspecting the accuracy of such reports. As a cor-
ollary to» the publicity, we have endeavored to put in at system of
graded regulations which bears heaviest upon armaments designed
-and intended for war; to a lesser extent upon a middle field which
might, in case of an emergency, be used for -war;.and which bears
lightest upon the articles which are ‘primarily designed and in-
tended for peaceful commercial production but which, in the
event of a great emergency, might serve some purpose -in war.’7-

The disclosures of the Senate Investigating Committee and the
demand for strict national control or monopoly in this country,
make it almost certain that such a treaty as proposed at Geneva
will command support in the Senate._, _ . g

Licensing of all munition plants (or governmental monopoly),
publici'ty"for orders and production of all -arms- and munitions
(including ‘airplanes and parts), government ’licenses for both
imports and exports, and supervisionvby a permanent international
body are generally regarded as the minimum requirements for es-
tablishing international control;

4. GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY

The War and Navy departments of the United States very
strongly object to the plan for nationalizing the munition industry,
on the ground that such action would seriously “cripple our nat-
ional defense,” which is now based on the cooperation of private
manufacturers, particularly during the actual progress of war.

The proponents of government monopoly counter the objections
of the military establishments with the arguments that war will
be far less likely to occur if the motive of private profit is re-
moved from war preparations. As spokesman for this viewpoint,
Senator Borah once declared: - '

“I have reached the conclusion that it would be about as absurd
to turn the War Department or the Navy Department over to
private interests as it is to leave the manufacture and sale of the
instrumentalities of warfare in the hands of private interests.

[9]

 

The influence of these interests is so very great that they can di-
rectly shape and dominate the policy of a nation toward war and
away from peace. Yes, more, they can shape and dominate the
policy with reference to budgets for armaments. So long as that
is true—am1 it will be true so long as profits are made out of war;
so long as war means vast gains, so long as vast corporations have
the influence which they have, that will continue to be true, and
the only remedy, in my opinion, is for the Government to take
control and dominate the manufacture and output of armaments,
either naval or land. This can be brought about by the Govern-
ment manufacturing armaments or by adopting a policy of lic-
ensing under which the government could control the amount
of armaments built and when and to whom they might be sold.
This would involve our establishing our own policy and, if possible
extending the policy through treaty. In some way we should

seek to eliminate profit: in the matter of manufacturing the instru- --

mentalities of warfare.”

5. FUNCTIONS or SENATE COMMITTEE.
The Senate Committee is em owered to do four s ecific thin rs;
P 2:

1. To investigate the activities of individuals and corporations in
the United States engaged in the manufacture, sale, distribution,
import or export of arms, munitions, or other implements of
war.

2. To investigate and report upon the adequacy or inadequacy of
existing legislation and of the treaties to which the United
States is a party for the regulation and control of the manufac-
ture and trafﬁc in arms.

3. To review the ﬁnding of the VVar Policies Commission (created
in 1931 to deal with the matter of "talqing the profit out of
war") and to recommend such speciﬁc legislation as may be
deemed desirable to accomplish that object, and

4. To enquire into the desirability of creating a Government mo-
nopoly in respect to the manufacture of armaments and muni-
tions and other implements of war.

The preamble to the Nye Resolution unanimously adopted by
the Senate, bases the work of the Committee on two categorical

statements regarding the 2 commercial (proﬁt) motive:

“The influence of the commercial motive is an inevitable fac-

[I0]

tor in considerations involving the maintenance of the national
defense. “ V V , i

The inﬂuence of the commercial motive is one of the inevitable
factors often believed to stimulate and sustain wars.”

There is every evidence that the American people generally con-
cur in the truth of these statements, and demand the necessary na-
tional and international‘ action to provide security against the ma-
chinations of private war-profiteers.

6. CRUX OF THE PROBLEM

Perhaps the crux of the problem faced by the Senate Investigat-
ing_Committee was stated by Senator Nye on December I2, I934,
after the President had suddenly called together his special Baruch-
Iohnson Committee to consult with him on the question of “tak-

A ing the profit out of war.” Senator Nye said:

“The War and Navy departments are really co-defendents
with the munition makers and proﬁteers. Instead of letting those
Departments now write their own remedial legislation, let us
first have the full knowledge of the parts these Departments
have played in creating the needs for remedy.”

III
p WORLD TRADE AND WAR PREPARATIONS

1.‘ WORLD ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCE.

_The object of this discussion is to appraise the effect of inter-
national war preparations upon world trade. The subject includes
both the psychological and economic relations between preparation
for war and the volume and trends of trans-frontier commerce.
The question also involves some understanding of the complicated
problems of inter-governmental war debts, currency ﬂuctuations,
tariﬁ’ barriers, commodity quotas-, and trade embargoes. It is like-
wise necessary to consider somewhat the -national treasury drains
due to recurring annual payments on account of past wars.

Our approach to this question is the fact of world economic in-
terdependence. This fact would need no corroborating argument
were it not for the specious nationalistic doctrines being preached
by chauvenist politicians and jingoistjournalists. Their isolationist
fulminations are believed by all too large a "percentage of unthink-
ing Americans. . . — ' A

Herbert Hoover can hardly be called chauvenistic, yet in an ad-
dress before the American Bankers Association in 1930 he said:
“We are able in considerable degree to free ourselves of world in-
fluences and make :1 large measure of independent recovery be-
cause we are so remarkably self-contained.”

Commenting on this statement, Raymond B. Fosdick, speak-
ing before the Carnegie Institute of Technology declared: “A
country that could not make a locomotive, an automobile or an
airplane without materials from abroad can scarcely be called
self—contained. A country that could not even carry on war with-
out the aid of thirty essential commodities from other nations
cannot boast of its national independence. By the same token, a
country whose excess wheat and cotton are rotting in fields and
storehouses because its foreign market has gone to pieces is not
in a position to talk in terms of Washington’s Farewell Ad"dress.”

On another occasion Mr. Hoover frankly acknowledged Amer-
ica’s need for export markets when. he said: “More than two mil-
lion families in the United States earn their living in the manu-
facture of raw materials which we import in exchange for our
exports . . . To insure continuous employment and maintain our
wages we must ﬁnd a proﬁtable market for the surplus. Conse-
quently our industries will gain in stability the wider we spread

[I2]

 

our trade with foreign countries. Foreign trade thrives only with
maintained goodwill and mutual interest with other nations.”
No other President‘ of the United States has shown a greater
grasp of world economic interdependence than Franklin D.
Roosevelt. He stated: “All of us are"-seeking -the restoration of
commerce in ways which will preclude the building up of large
favorable trade balances by any one nation at the expense of trade
debits on the part of other nations . . . I have made it clear that the
United States cannot take part in political arrangements in -Europe,
but that we stand readyto cooperate.at any time in practical mea-
sures on a world basis looking to immediate reduction of arma-
ments and the lowering of the barrier: against commerce."

Even Senator Borah, avowed isolationist, speaking before the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Ianuary 9, 1934,
said: “I believe in the foreign policy which oﬁ'ers peace to’ all
nations, trade and commerce with all nations, honest friendship
with all nations, political commitments, expressed "or implied‘,
with none . ..This is not isolation, it is freedom of action. It is
independence of judgment. It is not isolation; it is free govern-
ment.! There can be no such thing as free government if the
people thereof are not free to remain aloof or to take part in for-
eign wars. People who have bartered away or surrendered their
right to remain neutral in war have surrendered their right to
govern.” .

The proponents of the “Buy American” slogan are still thinking
in the terms of the ox-cart age. They seem to be unaware of the
fact that the world of 1935 is not the world of 1776. Such isolation-

‘ism, according to Raymond Fosdick, means “trying to run a

Twentieth Century industrial world with Eighteenth Century
political ideas . . .It repeats the Declaration of Independence as if
nothing has happened since 1776 . . .It does not see'—_-at least it
will not admit——-that the advice contained in Washington’s Fare-
well Address is as obsolete as the stage-coach, in which he rode

from New York to Philadelphia.”

Let us hear one more authority on the doctrine of isolation.
General David P. Barrows, former President of the University
of California, in Berlin November 7,1933, said: “The temptation
(of America) is to pursue a course of isolation from the old
world and to build a regional autonomy within which the old
world’s interests will be disregarded—the autarchy of a hemis-
phere. I personally hope America will not withdraw from efforts

to create a genuine liberal world economy. The woﬂd situation ‘

[I3]

*.\wL&v«»xb.é.4.~..e»>.«;4:

 

is too serious to permit America to retire from international con-
ferencc—to cease making an effort to restore the sanctity of treat-
ies, to reduce armaments, to restrain aggressive instincts, or to fail
to join the common voice and support moral and juristic prin-
ciples which are the heritage and promise of our Western civili-
zation.”

2. T}{E MYTH or “SEL1=-SU1=1=IcI1-:NcY."

,5: While the United States has a remarkable degree of economic
 self-containment, as Mr. Hoover has stated, yet the four corners p
of earth minister to our daily need. We could live sufﬁcient unto ‘
ourselves if we are willing to forego the pleasure of riding on
rubber-tired automobiles; or of drinking coffee, tea or chocolate;
ill _ or using a thousand-and—one other articles of import. ‘It would also
‘ be necessary for us to curtail our production both in agriculture
and industry by ten percent, which in normal times represents the
margin of profit. Wit/tout import there can be no export.

The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of 1930 is a painful reminder
4 of this truth. Since that tariff bill went into effect, American ex-
1‘ ports have decreased 64 percent and imports 58 percent. The excess
; of exports over imports dropped from $1,036,912,ooo in 1928 to
l $295,212,000 in 1932. Before this prohibitive tariff barrier was
 erected we exported to other countries 49.2 percent of our cotton
» crop; 41.2 percent tobacco; 17.9 percent wheat; 13.8 percent gas—
oline; 23.2 percent agricultural machinery; 20.8 percent locomo-
tives; 41.5 percent typewriters; 50 percent motorcycles; and 10.1
percent automobiles. .

Now that foreign trade has been almost completely eliminated,
by our own action, some people still wonder why we have a
depression!

Showing the mutuality of export and import, every basic in—
dustry in the United States requires products from many lands.
Our automobile industry requires imported material from 18
countries; bakery and confectionarv 28; cosmetics 17; Clothing 21;
drugs and tobacco 27; electric appliances 17; farm machinery 13;
furniture 25; hardware 25; jewelry 26; radio 18; telephone 15.
The chief articles of import in dollar value are: silk, coffee, sugar,
rubber, hides, tin, wool, ‘sodium nitrate and potassium. Complete
stoppage of import and export would soon lead mankind back to
,1 the jungle. Some-times it seems that human stupidity is headed .
-in that direction. Herbert Hoover, who signed the Hawley-Smoot

 

 

Tariff "Act over the ‘vigorous protest of over a thousand American

[14]

 

 

economists, nevertheless once declared: “We might survive as a
nation, though on lower standards and wages, if we had to sup-
press the nine or ten percent of ourltotal production which is now
sold abroad. But our whole standard of life would be paralyzed
and much of the joy of living destroyed if we were denied suf-
ficient imports.”

President "Franklin D. Roosevelt, elaborating his “good neighbor”
policy, sets forth the tragic results of high tariﬂ isolation. He said:
“Our system of constantly raising tariffs has at last reacted against
us to the point of closing our Canadian frontier on the north, our
European markets on the east, many of our Latin-American mar-
kets on the south, and a goodly proportion of our Pacific markets
on the West, through the retaliatory tariffs of those countries.”

The present policy of the Roosevelt administration is to reduce
tariff barriers gradually by the process of reciprocal trade agree-
ments covering speciﬁc articles of commerce. It has been suggest-
ed that the emergency Foreign Trade Corporation, set up by
Presidential order to stimulate American sales abroad, be made
a‘ permanent Federal export agency, somewhat after the Russian
plan of state-controlled export. The next step would be some
organized international body for the planned control of world
trade. '

Since the entire world today constitutes a basic economic unit,
and since unofficial cartels and such organizations as the Inter-
national Chamber of Commerce are inadequate methods of con-
trol of world trade, it becomes increasingly evident that govern-
ments must cooperate to secure an international planned economy.
This means international political action. Political isolation is
as inconsistent in an interdependent world as is economic iso-
lation. '

President Roosevelt has intimated, if he has not openly de-
clared, that both political and economic laisscz faire are perma-
nently doomed in the United States. In his message to. Congress
January 3, 1934, Mr Roosevelt spoke of the New Deal recovery
as meaning “a reform of many old methods, a permanent adjust-
ment of many of our ways of thinking and therefore of many
of our social and economic arrangements.”

3. Worm) TRADE IN ARMAMENTS.

.The manufacturers of the implements of war, and the producers
of the raw materials of:.war supplies, have a considerable economic
stake 'in. world trade.‘ The average annual value of armament

‘ [I5]

 

@exports from 59 countries and 49 colonies from 1921 to -1930

was $60,000,000, or .$600,000,000 for the decade. This was exclu-
sive of exports of airplanes and equipment and naval vessels and
armaments. .. , . - _

Ten countries supply 93.2 percent of all arms exports. Great
Britain contributed 30.8 percent in 1930,.France 12.9, the United
States 11.7, Czechoslovakia 9.6, and. Sweden 7.8. The bulk of
arms exports went to overseas colonies, to the Orient-and- to South
American nations. ‘

Since 1920 the foreign sales of arms and ammunition by the

United States firms amount to $155,510,000. In 1929 theirvalue
was $10,734,000 and: in 1932 it had slumped to $2,950,000. The
largest single purchaser of arms from the United States is Canada,
the next being Mexico and then the Central and South American
Republics. '

In 1930 the world’s bill for armed preparedness amounted to
.$4,50o,000,000, of which total the taxpayers of the United States
contributed approximately one-sixth. For the ﬁscal year ending
June 30, 1936, we have appropriated for war preparations over
$900,000,000, including special War and Navy Department allo-
cations from Public Works Administration funds.

The largest export items in connection with war preparations
are not arms and ammunition but raw materials such as cotton,
copper, tin, rubber and manufactured airplanes, navel vessels and
equipment. It is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain exactly
what proportion of exported materials find their way into war
munitions. When the volume of export cotton, steel, copper or
nitrate of soda increases greatly beyond normal, the presumption
is that the surplus is forawar preparations.‘

The Sino-Iapanese undeclared war in Manchuria and Shanghai
resulted in a considerable increase in expo-rt of war supplies to
both belligerents. Iapan’s purchases of cotton and steel (including
scrap—iron) material-ly increased above normal. Between Ianuary
-I7 and February 23, 1932, a total of 5000 tons of nitrate of soda,
chief ingredient in the manufacture of TNT, was shipped from
Newport News to Japanese ports. American airplane firms, es-
pecially the Curtiss Wright Corporation, have done considerable
business with China. 5

The business of producing war materials ‘and manufacturing
war munitions is one of immense magnitude. Between 1920 and
1929 approximately $37,5o0,000,000 was spent for war preparation.

Of this, about $8,250,000,000 was spent on arms, munitions and ‘

[I5]

, implements of war. It is a business. very intimately related to

government, since most governments rely upon private manufac-
turers of munitions for "supplies, especially in the event of war.
During our nineteen months of participation in the world ‘war,

munitions and war. im lements to the value of" $2 r 000,000 were
9 3

bought by the Allies from American firms.

While munition manufacturers receive exorbitant profits in
wartime, Pierre S. duPont, then head of the du Pont de Nemours
explosive firm, declared in 1930 regarding disarmament: “I hope
I have made it clear thatwe makers of munitions who survived
the risks to life and capital are not among those anxious to repeat
the experiment of war by preventing the establishment of perma-
nent peace. I consider the calling of the Disarmament Conference
(1 long step in the rig/zt direetion. Sentiment against war has always
been strong; added to this sentiment now is the crushing burden
of taxation, and a disarrangement of all the orderly channels of
domestic and international commerce.”

4. WORLD TRADE ANDAWAR C0sTs.

Regarding the losses of war and their effect on world trade,
Secretary of War, George H. Dern once said: “What about the
losses? The showing here is more imposing, with its 10,000,000
lives lost, 20,000,000 injured, and billions of the accumulated
wealth of the world destroyed. That in itself was a terrible, price
to pay,but when, in addition to the impoverishment of the people,
the world’s trade and commerce was disrupted, and a long-estab-
lished system of national trade habits destroyed, it is no wonder
that we have felt the effect in Utah and California . . . Wit/tout
foreign trade we cannot prosper. It is sheer nonsense to say that
we should stay at home and mind our own business. That is what
we have been doing, and look at the fix we are in. Cordell Hull
claims it has already cost the United States $25,00o,ooo,o00 to
ﬁnd out that economic isolation is impossible.”

It cost the world $337,o0o,ooo,00o and the United States almost
$5o,o00,00o,00o to learn that the “war to end war” not only com-
pletely failed to achieve that object,—it absolutely disorganized
international economic relations. The World War left the nations
loaded with a hundred billion dollar debt. Our own war debt
reached over $25,oo0,o0o,o0o. Intergovernmental debts ‘between
the Allied and Associated powers amounted to about $18,000,
000,000, not including interest. Under the funding agreements

[I7]

the Allies. were to pay the United States a grand total of $22,100,
000,000. ' V . .
With the exception of Finland, all the Allies are either in arrears

‘ or in default in their payments. All of them ask either outright

cancellation or drastic reduction. The funding arrangements were
built on the basis of each nation’s “capacity to pay.” There is a
general appreciation of the fact that economic conditions are now
vastly different from the .period when the debts were funded.
Not only the world-wide depression, but also the high tariﬂ W_alls
and crumbling monetary systems, make the full payment of the
debts difﬁcult if not impossible.

Andrew" Mellon, as Secretary of the Treasury, once said; “The
entire foreign debt is not worth as much to the American people
in dollars and cents as a prosperous Europe as a customer.”

There can be no question about the vital connection between
wardebts and world trade. For a time payments were made by
virtue of ﬁctitious juggling of ﬁscal accounts, chieﬂy through
borrowing from the United States. In view of our high tariﬂ,
the lack of favorable trade balances created an acute transfer prob-
lem. When credits could no longer be used to settle accounts, gold
export was the only alternative. There is a total monetary gold
supply in the world of only $;12,ooo,o0o,ooo. Since the United
States owns over three—ﬁfths of the world’s monetary gold, mani-
festly the debts cannot be paid in gold. I)‘ paid at all, 2:/zev must
be paid with goods. This means increased imports from Europe.

Writing about the eﬁect of war debts on world trade, Nicholas
Murray Butler said: “While this strangulation of the world’s agri-
culture, industry, and trade has been going on, our nationalearn—
ing power has diminished from some $82,0oo,0oo,ooo in 1929
to some $37,o0o,oo0,o0o at the present (November, 1932) or
more than 50 percent. \Vhile we have been insisting on payments
from abroad to be applied through our Budget in reduction of
taxation, our annual income~—taX collections have diminished. by
some four times the amount of the annual debt payments. In other
words, the‘ acceptance of these debt payments has been a burden
and not a blessing, a loss and not a gain. If we got rid of them,
conﬁdence would be restored, trade would revive and the farmer,
the wage—earner, the industrialist, and the transportation company
would again be able to earn a livelihood.” . 3 ' 

A comprehensive study of the question of war debts was. made
in 1932 by a group of prominent American economists headed
by -Professor, James  Angel of Columbia University. Recom-

mending a reconsideration and readjustment of the war debts that
“would best advance the interests of American trade and promote
the prosperity of the American people,” the Committee declared:
“Any action on our part whichswould maintain the solvency of
Europe and revive its power. to buy American goods would be a
stimulus to our own trade and renewed prosperity at home. A re-
adjustment of these debts in the light of present world conditions,

suited both to the capacity of our debtors to pay, and to our own

ability to receive—-especially if it involved favorable concessions
to American trade—would go far toward the stimulation of world-
wide and American economic recovery.”

5. VVORLD TRADE AND VV AR PROPAGANDA.

War propaganda is far more rife around the world in 1935 than
it was in 1914. The world war might have been considered the

result of blind forces, were it not for the fact that history records '

the deliberate preparation of Europe for war. If another such
war isvallowed to develop it will result from causes t/uztsare well-
krzowrz and prcz/entable. VVhile»no single nation may desire war,
all the nations know that preparation for war leads to war.
The fact that all nations have signed a solemn pact jointly agree-
ing to renounce war as an instrument of national policy, and to

_ seek the solution of all disputes solely by peaceful means, has little

eﬂectso long as these same nations continue to pile up armaments.
When a dispute arises there is" a strong tendency to scrap the in-
struments of peace and use the implements of war. Witness ]apan’s
military venture in China.

What effect do the 1935 war—scares have on world trade? In
the case of Japan it means that Iapan is buying more cotton, scrap-
iron, oil and nitrate of soda from the United States than in normal.
times. It means that China buys more airplanes, small arms, and
ammunition. Russia buys additional railroad equipment.

But what about ordinary commodities that constitute the bul-
wark of foreign trade? War hysteria creates fears and hates,
rivalries and jealousies that are inimical to normal trade. It also
produces an atmosphere of economic uncertainty and enhances
the hazards of transfer in the event of unfavorable balances. The
current talk of a possible or even probable war between Japan
and Russia and between Japan and the United States is a real
handicap to commerce in the Pacific. There is no valid reason
for. war—0r er/en war mll(—between Iapan and this country.
Iapan is our best customer in the Orient. There is every reason

[I9]

 

why thetwov countries should be friends. Yet both Japanese and
American generals and admirals are constantly predicting war,
even" while they prepare for war.» , " ’
There are some evidences that the '“Arak'i era” of rampant mili-
tarism in Japan may ‘be nearing an eclipse.'©n the day that Araki’s
successor as Minister’?of War was7appoint’ed, the Japanese Foreign
Minister, Koki Hirota, said in» his speech before the Diet: “Be-
tween Japan and the United States of America there exists no
question that is intrinsically diﬂicult of solution. Far from having
any thought of picking a quarrel with America, Iapan fervently
desires American f7'iend5hz'p'.“;' . I sincerely hope that the two great
nations across the Paciﬁc will,_ in view of their important relations,
commercial and ‘otherwise, continue to join forces in cultivating

their historical friendship and good understanding so as to keep -

the ocean forever true to its name.”

Two days after the Japanese Foreign Minister made this state-
ment, on January 25, 1934, a United Press Dispatch from Wash-
ington reads: “Both State Department and Naval officials of this
country have been uneasy over the situation in the FareEast ever
since Japan started her military activities in Manchuria in 1931.
Japan’s program in Manchuria has developed serious friction with
the Soviet Russian forces in Siberia, and the whole Far Eastern area
is now considered a powder keg with fuse laid. A serious war in
that area in the near future is now considered a distinct possibility,
not only by oﬂicials of this government, but by the foreign offices
of most major powers. The present (naval) building program is
considered by Administration heads here as absolutely necessary
to prepare the United States Navy for eventualities that may take
place in the Paciﬁc.”

‘The national wealth of Japan in normal times is $2o,ooo,ooo,ooo;
that of the United States $32I,ooo,ooo,o0o. Our annual income in
normal times is over four times the total wealth of Japan. Yet war
between two such unevenly matched nations is not unthinkable.
If the two countries continue to talk war and prepare for war,

then in time war will be inevitable. That is the verdict of history. .

In the event of war between Japan and Russia it would be as
impossible for America to remain‘ neutral as it was during the
world war. In View of our two foreign policies, Open Door and
Freedom of the Seas, our involvement would be inevitable. The
result would be the destruction of our Pacific trade. If by neutral-
ity we mean the right to carry on “business as usual,” regardless
of other people’s wars, then neutrality is no longer aitenable policy

[20]

 

for a powerful nation like the United. States,

6. WORLD TRADE DEMANDS ‘PEACE-.

Stable world trade-demandsa world at ,.peace, a peace that is
more than the mere absence of military war or the threat of war.
Friendships, not battleships, are the beacons along the highways
of world trade. Trade routes are paved with goodwill-.. For‘ex-
ample, when the United States was not on speaking terms with
Russia, trade between the two countries was more or less of a boot-
leg variety. Dr. Charles E. Martin of the University of Washing-

ton, recently wrote: “The International Chamber of Commerce

declared that commerce. was a process of peace, not of war, and
that tariffs which impeded the How of trade were warlike in char-
acter. The business leaders of the United States, in their corporate
economic life, are committed to the same principle. The economic
self—suﬂiciency of Alexander Hamilton is as unsuited to the de-
mands of our inter—dependent international economy today as is
the old policy of isolation in the political sphere.”

Secretary of War George Dern has said: “We should be willing
to enter a program of disarmament when the rest of the world is
ready to disarm, and thereby take a long step toward permanent
world peace . . . We ought to recognize that no nation can live
by itself, and that all our economic problems are international
problems, on account of which we ‘should not hesitate to cooperate
heartily with other nations and with the agencies that have been
set up to facilitate international cooperation.”

Dean Christian Gauss of Princeton University writes: “To put
it inelegantly, Germany, France, Great Britain and the United
States are over-ripe as competing nationalistic states. Neither cul-
turally nor economically can they live apart, and their pretense
to self—suHiciency can lead only to clashing rivalries that must end
in catastrophe.”

The Committee on World Peace and Foreign Relations of the
American Legion, supported by the Na-tional Executive Com-
mittee, adopted this statement: “More important than any other
phase of international relations in the daily life of American
workers and business men is that of foreign trade. The prosperity
of America today depends on its foreign trade. This foreign trade
depend: on friendly relations between nations. From an entire-

ly selﬁsh standpoint, it is well for us to do what we can to foster

this condition.”

[21]

 

Therefore, we conclude that war itself, the results of past wars,
and the preparation for future wars, are serious barriers in the
path of world trade. Peace is ‘the handmaiden of ‘commerce. The
supreme enemies" of world trade, under. normal international re-
lations, are the jingoists whofoment war and. the militarists who
prepare for war. . L . , ‘ _ I i . . .

President .Roosevelt’s “good neighbor” policy points the way
to world economic recovery. The heart of his policy is “the re-
establishment i of friendly relations and I greater conﬁdence. be-
tween all nations.’’. . ’ ’ ' "

IV!
THE COST OF WAR.

There are three elemental factors involved in any full-consider-

ation of the cost of war. Those factors are economic, social, and"

ethical; money, men and morals. In the terms of money,’ the costs
of war arestaggering in their niagnitude. In the terms of men,

I they are beyond human computation. In the terms of morals, or

emotions, they are terrifying when we consider their effects on
civilization. -
Statistics may be dry reading, but the compilations of war costs,

affecting the lives of millions of human beings", are a matter of’

vital concern to every thoughtful citizen. It has been estimated by
"the statisticians that the immediate monetary cost of the World
War was $I86,ooo,0o0,000. By 1930 these costs had mounted to

337,00o,000,o00, including property losses and the valuations

of the lives. destroyed. The cost to the taxpayers of the United
States for our nineteen months of participation in the World War»
was approximately $2I,50o,0o0,o0o.. The Treasury Department
announced that those costs had increased up to the close of our
governmental ﬁscal year, June 30, 1930, to $37,873,908,499.36.‘
Since then it has increased an additional $I3,o00,000,000. ’

I. WAR ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN.

War’s ﬁscal costs do not end with the signing of a treaty of
peace. They go on for generations. Brig. Gen. Frank T. Haines,
head of the Veteran’s Administration, recently announced that
the tax—payers of the United States had paid out $14,0o0,000,000
in pensions and other forms of veteran relief, of which amount
$6,000,o00,000 is on account of the World War. He estimates that
by 1945 we will have paid the veterans of the World War $21,
500,000,000, an amount equal to the initial cost of the war. Sixty-

. five years after the close of the Civil War we paid pensions to the
veterans of that war amounting to $125,000,000. One hundred

and twenty years after the close of the VVar of 1812 we paid an
installment of $6,000 to the pensioners as a result of that little war.
Last year our total expenditures for veterans of all wars was
approximately $I,000,o00,0oo, or one fourth of the total ordinary
federal budget.

Any consideration of the monetary costs of war must include

the expenditures in preparation for future wars. In 1932 the ag— .

gregate armament bill for the world was almost $/3,000,000,000.

The PRICE of
PEACE

1935

 

The United States spent $707,425,000 for the War and Navy
Departments; w/zicizvu/as $7,425,000 more than the total cost of
goz/er1zmer_2_t in‘ 1913, and 197 percent more than we spent on war
preparation in’ 1913. In the rate of increase of war expenditures
the United States headed the list, Japan came second, with an in-
an increase _of 142 percent. V i . i i
The nations with one accord continue to prepare for war, al-
though they have all signed a solemn declaration renouncing war
asan instrument of national policy, andagreeing to seek the solu-
tion of all disputes, of whatsoever character, that might ariseamong
them solely by paciﬁc means. That is the language of the Kellogg-
Briand Pact, which makes war an illegal method in the "settle-

ment of international disputes. Are the nations planning to be-‘

come international anarchists? V ’ y
~ It is diﬂicult, if not impossible, for the ordinary person. to under-

‘ stand money in the terms of billions of dollars. One needs to be

able to think in astronomical ﬁgures to appreciate the monetary
cost of war. Let us put it on the basis of what we pay for war
purposes every day. Last year the taxpayers of the United States
spent every day, including Sundays and holidays, on account of
war the enormous sum of $7,710,000. Of this total $2,940,000 went
for veteran’s relief and pensions; $2,770,000 was for payment
of interest and principal on the national war debts; and $2,000,000
was in preparation for future wars. So you have to think in the
terms of millions of dollars to know what we pay for war on

a day-by-day basis.

Suppose we reduce the money cost of war down to a dollar
basis, then we all can get a real idea of what war costs. Last year
two-t/zirds of every dollar expended by the federal treasury was on
account of war. Roughly, fifty cents of the dollar went for veter-
ans relief and redemption of war debts, and about seventeen cents
went into preparation for future wars. In other words, out of
every dollar you paid the federal government in the form of in-
come tax, duty, excise, or on account of tariff, sixty-seven cents
of that dollar went to pay for war, past or in prospect. _

VVhen one ponders these facts intelligently there is.a tendency
to question the sanity of our civilization. It does not sound reas-
onable that a nation should spend two-thirds of its total income on
account of war. Yet that is what every nation is doing today. We
are passing through a world—wide economic collapse, which all
economists recognize as a direct aftermath of theWorld War.

‘Yet, in spite‘ of that fact, all nations continue t_heiri‘gigantic pre-

[24]

 

' parations for another war. Fifty per_c_ent.of the Iapanese budget

for next year, so it is reported, is for war preparation. France
last year spent 22 percent .'Of her national budget getting ready

for another vt{ar—._ She spent $432,000,000 on war preparation in
19 31, whenZ:h,er war-debt payment to the United States amounted V

to $44,00.0",0,00. The ‘major reason ‘why the European‘ nations
cannot pay their war-debts (so they say) is because theyare spend-
ing such a disproportionate share of their national incomes get-.

ting ready for another war.

1-  , _ 2. WAR’s HUMAN Tom... 5 4.

Serious --as they are, the money cost of war is relatively insigni-
ficant compared. with’, the human cost of war. The World ‘War
took a human toll of*10,873,-577 soldiers -on the ﬁelds of battle,
including those who diedof wounds a-nd disease behind the lines.

Russia lost the largest number, 2,762,064; Germany, 2,050,466;‘

France, 1,427,000; Austria-Hungary, 1,200,000; British Empire,
1,098,919; Italy, 507,160. America’s battle losses were 107,284
including 57,000 who died of disease or wounds. To those young
men who died in battle must be added another 10,000,000 who
died as a by—product of war,—of starvation, disease, massacre,
and other causes.

But~ the death lists do not indicate the full human cost of war
by any means. To those who gave their lives must be added 20,
000,000 wounded soldiers; 9,000,000 war widows; and 5,000,000
war orphans. Nor does that tell all the human cost of war. Whole
nations were starved and stunted and 'diseased as a result of the
ravages of war. The Swedish Society for the Study of the Social
Consequences of the War, after careful and scientiﬁc investiga-
tion, estimated that the World War was responsible for 40,000,000
deaths. War cemeteries around the world testify to the terrific
human cost it entails.

I was never quite so saddened by any sight as I was when I

' visited the military grave-yard on Galipoli Peninsula and saw

a hundred thousand white crosses that resulted from that ill-fated
campaign._ In different lands I have stood beside the cenotaphs
erected to the memory of the “Unknown Soldier.” On patriotic
days I have watched the long lines of widows passing these monu-
ments and laying memorial wreaths on the tomb. Each one think-
ing: "It may be my boy!”

‘It is impossible thoughtfully to consider the human costs of‘

war and not ask: “Why is collectiz/c homicide necessary in the

[25]

settlement of dispute: between nations?" Is there no saner way for
the nations to compose their differences?
,1 once saw a cartoon illustrating this mad folly. There were

‘three pictures. The upper one showed a dead soldier lying on the

ground. On each side of the dead man were two other soldiers,

-of opposing nations, each accusing the other of the deed. Behind

these soldiers stood two frock—coated, top—hatted dip1omats..The
-caption of the picture said: “The death of one officer is absolutely
inexcusable and unexplainable.” The next picture showed a- sea
of blood and a host of dead soldiers, and bore the caption: “So
they (the diplomats) order several hundred thousand men to kill
each other.” The third picture revealed two generals at ‘a table,
ismilingly signing a treaty of peace. The caption was: _f‘And that,
of co-urse, makes everything all right again!” A 0 '
Isn’t that a pretty fair picture of the folly and the futility of

.wholesale human slaughter as a method of settling disputes be-

tween nations? Yet today there are 5,000,000 men under arms,
being prepared for another slaughter, and the tax-payers of the
nations are spending $';,0oo,o00,ooo to further a method that has
been outlawed by solemn international declaration. Mothers are
urged, in the name of patriotism, to immolate their sons on the
altar of war. When Lysistrata rebels she is called a “slacker.”

In his inaugural address President Hoover said: “It is impos-
sible, my countrymen, to speak of peace without profound emo-
tion. In thousands of homes in America, in millionsof homes
around the world, there are vacant chairs. It would be ashame-
ful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we
have abandoned the hope for which all these men died. Sure-
ly civilization is old enough,_surely mankind is mature enough,
so that we ought in our own lz'}‘etz'me to ﬁnd a way to permcment
peace."

3. WAR’s EMOTIONAL Cosr

Serious as are the money costs of war, tragic as are its human
co-sts, more awful are the costs of war in the terms of morals, or
emotions. War is quite as much a matter of psychology as of
economics and sociology. War ‘releases the basest of human pas-
sions. The hates and fears that feed one war remain behind to
breed futurewars. You who are older well remember thewave of
hate that swept this country into the war with Spain. Some of you
remember the bitter hates of the Civil War. All of yourknow the
abyssmal hatreds generated by the World War. These war-time

[25]

 

.,$,.__{_. 1

-v v—-4—-

hates and fears are passed on from‘ generation to generation. They
are the most disastrous in their consequences of all the costs of
war. -\ - . I . A

A famous London preacher, "more than a generation ago’, deli-
vered a sermon condemning the Turkish atrocities against the
Christian Armenians. He closed his sermon with a prayer and he
closed his prayer with these words: “God damn the Turk!” I
heard a Methodist Bishop use similar language before three thou-
sand people during thhe World War, when he spoke of the Ger-
man Kaiser. On a similar occasion in a New England City a min-
ister of the Prince of Peace was appealing from the pulpit for his
parishioners to buy Liberty Bonds. He said: “The thing to do with
the Kaiser is to boil him in oil!” The congregation wildly cheered
this Christian ( P) sentiment. A world-famous evangelist preached
a sermon to 25,000 soldiers in an American cantonment. He closed
his sermon with a prayer, as did the London preacher; and he
ended with these words: “Good night boys; and to hell with the
Kaiser!”

That is what war does to- the men who profess to follow in the
footsteps of the Man of Galilee. War 23/m'z/es on /tater. And it al-
ways leaves a legacy of hate. Today the world is cursed with those
hates and fears. In 1932, Guglielmo Ferraro, the great Italian his-
torian, wrote: “Today Europe, at least, has again become an in-
extricable net of hate, distrust and more o-r less hiddenvrivalry.
Italy distrusts France and Iugo-Slavia; Iugo-Slavia distrusts Italy,
Albania and Bulgaria; France distrusts Italy and Germany dis-
trusts France and Poland; Poland distrusts Germany and Russia;
Russia detests and denounces as an irreconcilable enemy the whole
of the capitalist Occident. It would be futile to seek to determine
to what extent this distrust is justified. It exists; during the past
two years it has tended to grow worse and to degenerate into real
hatred; and that is sufficient for it to be, whether real. or imagin-
ary, the great obstacle against which the effort of the Disarmament
Conference will clash.”

Ferraro did not mention the miasmic hates and fears of Asia;
nor did he include the United States in his category. We all know
of the work of Chauvenists and jingoists in our country, in and
out of Congress, who are constantly harping about war and keep-
ing alive the hates and fears that promote war. To the glory of
some of the men who represented America in the World War,
they are seeking to heal the wounds of war. A few months ago the

[27]

 

Lexington Post of the American Legion in New York City ‘passed
this resolution: I   * I ‘
“Whereas, Lexington Post, 108, of the American Legion know
that our fallen comrades. whothrew to us the torch did not intend
it to be a perpetual pillar of hate torbe transmitted to children
even to the third and fourth generation; and . -

“Whereas the only way to prevent the breeding of hate an
envy in the minds of the children of Europe is by ‘eradicating the
causes thereof; therefore be it « '

“Resolved by the Lexington Post that welurge either new treaties
or the revision of old treaties so that love and friendship may
supplant envy and hate in the minds of generations in Europe yet
unborn and insure that our children’s children may never be drawn
into the horrors of another war.”

That resolution was introduced by former National Com-
mander of the American Legion, Edward E. Spofford. Similar
sentiments have been expre-ssed by many who took part in the
war. Ame-rica’s war-mongers for the most part are men and W0-
men who never saw their comrades shot to pieces by shrapnel,
and who never had their lungs scorched by poison gas. Friend-
ships must be substituted for battleships if civilization is to be
saved from a complete collapse. The promoters of hate, the fo-
menters of strife, are more dangerous and more sinister than es-
caped lunatics. After all, war is at sort of insanity, obsessing the
collective minds of nations.

4. FOLLY AND FUTILITY op WAR.

The common people around the world are increasingly recog-
nizing the futility, the inhumanity, the folly and the insanity of
war. They are demanding of their statesmen that they find a way
of deliverance from war’s terriﬁc burden of cost. This demand
was well phrased by Mahatma Gandhi at the Second London
Round Table Conference, when he said during an international
radio broadcast: ‘ .

“I personally would wait, if need be, for ages rather than seek
to‘ attain freedom of my country through bloody means. I feel in
the innermost recesses of my heart, after a political experience of
close -upon thirty-five years, that the world is sick unto death of
blood-sjzilling. The world is seeking a way out, and I ﬂatter my-
self with the belief that perhaps it will be the privilege of the
ancient land of India to show that way.”

'The people are growing tired of paying war’s mounting costs,

They are increasingly demanding that collective homicide be
abandoned by the nations, not simply by pious resolutions but in
very truth, as the means of settling, »or.,»attempting to settle, inter-

national disputes. The war system must be It

V
THE PRICE» OF PEACE»

For untold centuries the ‘peoples of the _world- havebeen paying
the mountainous costs of war."War has been considered as in-
herent in human nature, hence the inevitable method of settling
the disputes between nations. The costs of war in the terms of
men, money and emotions have become so burdensome that
war-weary peoples are clamoring for a full release from the whole
war system. The demand for peace is insistent. However, all too
few people realize that there is a real price that must be paid be-
fore permanent peace can be secured and assured.

This popular demand of peoples everywhere for peace is re-
ﬂected in the instrumentalities for the peaceful settlement of in-
ternational disputes that have been erected since the close of the

World War. Until the summer of I92_o,_war was a perfectly legiti-A”

mate method of resolving differences between nations. Since the
signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact for the renunciation of war
as an instrument of national policy, war is an illegal method of set-
tling disputes between nations. Sixty-ﬁve nations have adhered
to this pact, agreeing to seek the solution of all disputes of what-
soever character that might arise among them, "solely by paciﬁc
)1
means.

What are some of the prices that must be paid before the ideal
condition envisaged by the Peace Pact can be realized? Manifestly
peace cannot be attained by the simple signing of a solemn de-
claration. Peace is not a condition that comes form pious hopes
and devout prayers. Peace is not a passive state, especially in a
technological age. It involves positive relations between nations
in the ﬁelds of territory, trade, and culture. It means the substitu-
tion of cooperation for competition in the relations of nations to
one another. »

I. GOOD-WILL THE BASIS o1= PEACE.

Goodwill between races and nations is the sine qua non of peace.
International friendship and respect for mutual rights constitute
the basis for any permanent structure of peace. Racial, religious,
and national prejudices, rivalries, and hates must be‘ supplanted
by the spirit of human brotherhood. Van Loon, in his New
Gcogmp/zy, says that we are all common passengers on a unitary
planet, bound in the same direction, and the sooner we all recog-

[30 1

nize this fact, and act accordingly, the better it will be for a war—
tornworld. .

The world has become a single neighborhood of nations. Due
to the developments of modern science, no nation or people any
longer enjoys geographic insularity- The mountain ranges and
oceans ‘that used to constitute well—nigh impassable barriers be-
tween nations have been obliterated by the airplane and radio.
All nations now live just across the street or. just around the cor-
ner from eachiother. They are a geographical unit, and they are
increasingly. interdependent. Political insularity still obtains, be-
cause the great majority of people are yet insular in their think-
ing. They are unaware of the fact that they are living in a unitary‘
world, and that no nation is sufﬁcient unto itself.

The task of making a brotherhood of the world neighborhood

is not in the ﬁeld of the scientist or the technological expert. Broth-

erhood is a. spiritual thing, and its achievement is the task of
education, religion, and constructive statesmanship. The men
and women o-f thevarious nations must become aware of the fact
that “God "made of one blood» all the nations that dwell upon the
face of the earth; for we are all the offspring of God.” ' .
If the political or economic realist objects that we are dealing with
intangibles, the charge is well made. Yet it remains true that the
only basis for permanent peace is the spiritual foundation" of hu—
man brotherhood, resulting in good—will, friendship and mutual
respect. The paramount values of civilization are the intangibles.
Culture cannot be measured with a dollar yardstick. Nor can

peace be bought with money. .The true advocate of peace is a

realist no less than the advocate of brute force.

2. THE POWER OF IDEAS.
In writing on The Rczzlism of Iapalnese Diplomacy, Lincoln

Colcord says: “Whether we like to admitit or not, the philosophy '

of force still dominates the life of nations, ready to- be called into
play by the demands of trade and economic expansion, and by the
human elements of national progress and competition.”

This, doubtless, is true; and the task of the advocates of peace
is to substitute a‘ realistic philosophy o-f international cooperation
for nationalistic force. The currents_ of human thinking can be
changed. All epochs of civilization have been in large part the
result of the dominant philosophical systems of‘the- particular age.
The ideological method of interpreting history is as valid as the
method of economic determinism. Cultural factors are as vital

[3I]


5
l
>1»:

  
  

as economic factors in changing the currents of civilization.

Perhaps the greatest barrier in "developing a spirit of brother-
hood is in the ﬁeld of race—relationships. The arrogant White Race
assumes an attitude of racial superiority and boasts of White su-
premacy. One need not hold with Lothrop Stoddard that The Ris-
ing Tide of Color is necessarily a Revolt Against Ciz/z'Zz'z,a.tio12, to
use the titles of two of his books. There is a rising tide of color.The
yellow and brown races.of Asia are seething with new life, and
they are revolting against the White man’s domination. ‘These
races have resolved that they will no lon’ger‘tam'ely.submit to con.-
tinuous exploitation and oppression. For this they are not to be
blamed; rather are they to be praised. _ V . T

Peace rests on mutual understanding between the races. There
can be no enduring peace in the modern world unless there are
built bridges of friendship and respect between the Nordics, Lat-
ins, Slavs, and Orientals. The -colored races are rapidly adopting
the technological civilization of the White race. They. may be
forced to adopt the White man’s philosophy of force. Japan and
Turkey already have done this. If_ China and India follow these
examples, what will be the ultimate result for the vaunted Whites Pi’
History is replete with adequate illustrations. If race relations are
not speedily reorganized on the basis of good-will instead of force,
then we face an era of unparalleled strife. '

3. VVORLD ORGANIZATION. .

The next price that must be paid for peace is in the ﬁeld of world
organization. This involves the fetish of national sovereignty. Any
real association of nations in the world neighborhood means that
each nation must delimit, to a certain extent, its own sovereignty.
Yet this price must be paid if we are to have peace. With the in-
creasing recognition of national interdependence it is easier for the
nations to live and work together in a spirit of mutual equality.
Cooperation between nations follows the line of cooperation be-
tween individuals. International anarchy is no more necessary
than individual anarchy.

The greatest contribution of Woodrow Wilson to human think-

ing on international issues was his repeated insistence that the
time had come when civilized States‘ must adopt the same ethical
code to govern their relations as that which governs the relations
of individuals. The peace machinery that has been established
since the World War is based largely on this assumption. Individ-
uals associate themselves in organizations for local government.

[32]

 

 

 

They agree to eschew the use of phy*si’ca'*1‘ forceiin settling their
disputes and live under the reign of law. Ndtions must do like-
wise‘. i I i ' ' i

For the first time in the history of mankind, we have associa-
tion of nations on -a world-wide scale. The League of Nations is
far from perfect as an institution; yet there are‘ sixty-one nations
that constitute its membership and through it work together for
common ends. The only nation of any consequence outside its
pale-is the United States. The function and purpose of the League
of Nations. is succintly stated in the preamble to its Covenant:

“The high contracting parties, in order to promote inter-
national cooperation and to achieve international peace and secur-
ity by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to War, by the pres-
cription of open, just, and ho-norable relations between nations, by
the firm establishment of the understandings of international law
as the actual rule of conduct among governments, and _by the
maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty"
obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another,
agree to this Covenant.”

It is both interesting and enlightening to recall the relations of
the United States to thisassociation of nations. In its present form
the League of Nations is "primarily an American conception. We
have not .altogether abandoned the child we fathered on the in-
ternational doorstep, for at the present time there are about three-
hundred American citizens in Geneva officially representing the
United States Government on various committees and bureaus
of the League of Nations. That is by virtue of necessity. We are
cooperating with other nations through the only possible agency
for such internationalcooperation. We cooperate because we can-
not lz'z)e in z'soZatz'on. '

There have been many proposals for the preservation of peace
through some form of world organization, ever since the Pax
Romczmz and Hugo Grotius. However, the present form of world
association of the nations is largely a product Of American states-
manship. Woodrow Wilson, the war-time President, took the
ideals and ideas of Taft and Roosevelt and wrote "them into the
covenant of the League of Nations, as established at Versailles.

There is no need to recount the history of. the repudiation of
the League by the United States Senate. It is a familiar chapter to
which "fim's” has not yet been written. As time goes by and the
nations become ever more closely knit together economically, the
necessity for political cooperation becomes increasingly apparent.

[33]

 

The ancient Biblical» statement: “If one member suffer, all the
members suffer withit,” is just as true of the present-day world
community of nations as it is of a man with the toothache.

4. ARBITRATION AND ADJUDICATION. ‘

The next price that must be paid for peace is the necessity for
adequate international juridical machinery for the settlement of
the disputes between nations. This has been a fundamental
tenet of American policy ever since the days of George Washing-
ton. In 1795, when a second war threatened with England, Wash-
ington sent Chief Justice John Iay to- England as a special ambas-
sador to negotiate the first treaty of arbitration. In the face of bit-
ter opposition from "little Americans” in Congress, Washington
signed the Jay treaty. This paved the way for the recognition of
the principle of arbitration when the Treaty of Ghent was signed
at the close of the war of 1812. ‘

The American delegates to the First Hague Peace Conference,
held in 1899, were oﬂicially instructed by the Congress of the

United States to Work for the creation of a World Court. What‘

finally resulted from that conference of the representatives of
many nations was not a court of jurisdiction, but the Permanent
International Tribunal of Arbitration. In reality it is a panal of
judges of international repute that may be drawn in speciﬁc
cases of arbitration. The Permanent Court of International Ius-
tice actually came into being following the creation of the League
of Nations, and became a functioning institution in 1921. To date
forty-nine nations have voted to adhere to the World Court; and
thirty-seven of them have accepted the “optional clause,” giving the
Court compulsory judrisdiction over all disputes concerning the
interpretation of. treaties, points of international law, or a breach
of international obligation.

The United States Government has adhered to the Court, but
everyone is familiar with the fact_that the Senate has refused to
ratify the action. In the light of America’s relation to the forma-
tion of the World Court it is diﬂicult to un'derstand the stubborness
of the recalcitrant Senate. Every President of the United States
from Grover Cleveland to Franklin Roosevelt, has urged the
creation of, or America’s adherence to the World Court. Both the
Democratic and Republican parties carried planks in’ 1928 and 1932.
favoring America’s adherence to the Court.

[34]

 

5. SUBSTITUTES FOR WAR.«

‘There are‘ four possible methods of‘ settling disputes between
nations, without resort to armed coercion: Concz'lz'atz'on, _Medz'a-

-tion, Arbitration, and Adjudication. On numerous occasions the
"United States has acted the part of mediator between other nations
-for the peaceful settlement of their differences. We have signed
‘scores of treaties providing for conciliation and arbitration." Why

should we fear to take a step that would lead to adjudication of
our own disputes with other nations? Why do we refuse our ad-
herenceito -the World Court? Echo answers "Why!" It would
seem thelogical development of our settled policy of thel.substi—

tution~of law for force in the arbitrament of international dis-.

putes. -

Whatever the objections, real or alleged, of the Senate of the
United States to the present charter of the Permanent Court of
International Justice, the fact remains that some such piece of
world juridical machinery is essential if the community ofnations
does not wish to live in a state of international anarchy. Elihu
Root, Iohn Bassettp-Moore, Charles Evans Hughes, and Frank
B. Kellogg have represented the United States, unofficially, as
judges on the bench of the World Court. It is almost wholly the
product of American leadership. There is no valid reason why
America should remain aloof and completely abandon another
child of her maternity on the international doorstep.

Practically every organized group in the United States has gone
on record as favoring American membership in the World Court.
These groups include business, religious, educational, cultural,
and legal organizations. A recent survey of 6,000 business exe-
cutives, educators and lawyers showed that 5,819 of them were
in favor of America joining the World Court with the acceptance
of the Root Protocols. The members of the American Bar voted
1,657 to 45 in favor of adherence. The professors in the Law
Schools voted 475 to 10. Only two professors of international law
and international relations in the colleges and universities voted
against adherence to the WorldjCourt. Surely the wisdom of the
American Senate does not go beyond this preponderance of legal

se/2 olars/zip. '

6. REDUCTION or ARMAMENTS.

The ﬁnal price that must be paid for world‘ peace is Disarma-
ment. By .“disarmament” is not meant the total abolition of'arma—
ments, but the reduction and limitation of national armaments

[=35]

 

   

by international agreement. That is the question now before the
World Disarmament Conference in session at Geneva. Having
laid the basis for peace; W having established the instrumen—
talities for international cooperation;_ and having_._a_t _ha_nd the
machinery_for the ]uridical settlement ofydisputes between nations;
and having solemnly renounced war as an instriumenthof national
policyin a m.ulti—lateral treaty-.—it would seem logical and inevi—
table thatthe "nations would take the next step: Disarmament. 
such has not} been thecase. Nations have gone ahead arming to
the teeth as though they had no in.tenti0n of using the machinery
of peace they have created, and making theirrenunciation of war
a hollow mockery. i

.~ . ' I

Yet the armament race goes on apace. Speaking before the-

Washington confernece of the International Chamber of Com-
merce, President Hoover declared: “The world expenditure on

all arms is now nearly $5,0o0,00o,0oo yearly, an increase of about

70 percent over that previous to the Great War. We stand today
with nearly 5,500,000 men actively under arms and 20,000,000
more in reserves. The very calling of the Disarmament Conference
is in itself not only proof of need, but is an emphatic evidence of
progress in the world demand for relief and peace. Of all proposals
for the economic rehabilitation of the world, I know of none which
compares in necessity or importance with the succesful result of
that conference.”

The race for armaments between the Powers resulted in the
World War with all its horrors prophesied by the Russian monarch.
But statesmen are slow to learn the lessons of history. Hardly had
the guns ceased firing on the Western Front when a new race
for armaments began. T/mt rate is still on. If the World Disarm-
ament Conference cannot succeed in calling a halt, no further
prophesy is necessary as to the inevitable result. The future of
civilization is involved in the outcome of the Geneva Conference.
That is the belief of all thoughtful students of world affairs.

7. PLEDGES MADE TO GERMANY.

Pledges were deﬁnitely made to Germany when she signed the
peace treaties that her enforced disarmament was but the begin-
ning of a general reduction in armaments. The separate peace
treaty between the United States and Germany contains the same
pledge as was signed by the Allies. Yet t/rose promises never have
been kept. Now Germany demands parity in armaments and a

[36]

 

 

'_ status ofequality with the rest of the nations. This does not mean

that Germany desires to build up her armaments to the level of
France and Poland; rather that those nations in particular and the
rest of. the world in general reduce their armaments, as promised,
down to a level comparable with her own. The justice of the Ger-

man demand ‘is recognized by the United "States and by some]

other Powers. That is one reason why Presidents Hoover and
Roosevelt made their dramatic proposals fordrastic cutsin arma-
ments. It was an effort to maintain the integrity of international
commitments. ’ ' ’ ' ~

There can be no question that the peoples of the world are
weary of the burden of armaments. They desire to be relieved of
the economic load entailed by excessive armaments. More than
that, they wish to be free from the constant fear of war engendered
by the‘ armament race between the nations. The moral reason for
disarmament is even stronger than the economic reason. The tax-
payers of the United States are paying every day $2,o00,o00o
forvwar preparations’. In addition they are paying every day over
$5,700,000 on account of the wars of the past. Tax-payers of all
nations are carrying similar burdens. But the burden of fear that
these armaments will be used in another war far outweighs the
burden of economic cost. '

8. WHo DEMANDS DISARMAMENT?

The demand for drastic cuts in armaments is not conﬁned to
paciﬁsts and religious groups. Some of the strongest demands
have come from commercial and ﬁnancial organizations. The
International Chamber of Commerce at its Washington Confer-
ence adopted this resolution: ‘

“The International Chamber has repeatedly emphasized the
fact that war is the greatest barrier to social and economic prog-
ress, and the establishment of higher living standards is depen-
dent primarily on the maintenance of peace. The Chamber com-
mends the efforts being made by the Governments of the world
to reduce armaments to the lowest possible limit and urges not
only that there should be no relaxation of this effort but rather
that it should be redoubled.”

The American Bankers Association, at its meeting in Atlantic
City in October, 1931, resolved: “Questions pertaining to the
financial condition of the world powers are intimately associated
with the possible solution of the armament problem. We heartily
endorse attempts now being made by the governments of the

[37]

 

earth to_ bring about eﬁeetiz/e world disarmament and the conse-
quent reduction of the ﬁnancial burdens imposed by competitive
armies and navies.” 4

The International Rotary Convention in Vienna inxIune, 1931,
said: “Rotarians are viewing with profound disquiet the mainten-
ance of armaments at their present level by the nations as an ulti-
mate threat to the peace of the world and an incitement to war.»

It is resolved by Rotary International———that it favors every pos—~

sible step being taken by all governments to ensure that the Dis—
armament Conference at Geneva in 1932 shall succeed in bringing
about areally substantial rer.luetz'on in the armaments of the world.”

9. AHEAD LIES THE ABYss. ‘ .

The list could be indeﬁnitely lengthened of the organizations of
a responsible character that are on record as favoring the largest
possible cut in armaments. This is a frank recognition of the pa-
tent fact that preparation fo~r.war leads inevitably to war. All "the
more is armament reduction imperative because of the present
tense situation in the Orient and in Central Europe. As armaments
increase the Zil(elz'/zood of war z'r2crease.si The world stands on
thebrink of catastrophe. Will it act in time to avert Armageddon?

Former President Hoover once made this statement , pregnant.
with ominous meaning: “Indelibly impressed upon my deepest
emotions is the profound conviction that the very first of all
problems pressing upon the human race is the problem of preven—
tion of future wars. The greatest safety of the World from these.
crises we are now passing is to prevent war. I see this not only in
its terms of crushing economic burdens, not only in its fearful
disorganization and dislocation of economic life for years to come;
not only in its crushing burden of taxation for generations inno-»
cent of responsibility; I see it far more intensely as a supreme
human problem . . . The World has seen enough of a post-war
peace that is not peace, but rather smolders of racial hatred.”

Will the nations pay the price that must be paid if we are. to
have peace? Can we learn the lesson that we are “made of one
blood?” Can We associate ourselves together in a spirit of mutual-
helpfulness? Can we submit our disputes to judicial settlement?
Can we lay down our arms and cease to be international racketeers?
If we cannot do these things, then we are not ready to pay the
price of peace. And if we do not pay the price, then the abyss
lies just ahead. I

VI
-AMERICA’S DECADENT FOREIGN POLICIES...

The United States holds ﬁve basic foreign policies that deter-
mine our international relations. Those policies are: Isolation,
Freedom of the Seas, Monroe Doctrine, Open Door Policy‘, and
Prote‘etz'z/e Tariﬁ. The last four of these policies proceed from
the ﬁrst—Isolation—which began with George Washington. The
question that forms the basis of this discussion may be phrased:
Are the traditional foreign policies of the United States now ten-
able, in the light of present technological, economic and political
world-developments P

The world is by nature a geographical and ethnic unit. Science
has bound the world into an economic and cultural unit. Politi-
cal unity remains the unrealized dream of idealists, although we
have a rudimentary and partial form of world organization in
the League of Nations and the World Court. America’s first
foreign policy was based on the idea of absolute national sover-
eignty and full economic self-sufficiency. Can the United States
continue to hold and maintain its policy of Isolation, when it no
longer enjoys territorial or economic insularity?

The answer is “Yes.” if the question is asked in the sacrosanct
halls of Congress or the Senate. There is still a formidable bloc
of “irreconcilables” in each branch of our national legislature
who talk and act and vote as though the world had stood still
since the dawn of the Twentieth Century. Some whose terms
ended when the 1935 Congress began, have never gotten beyond
the Eighteenth Century in their international thinking. In addition
to the "little-Amerz'eczn5" in Washington there are the jingoistic
newspapers and the chauvenistic publicists who act as though. the
hand of time stopped in the year 1900.

I . ISOLATION.

The policy of Isolation was based on a world which is today
non-existent. The United States of 1800 persisted for a century.
Since 1900 the United States has been an adult member in. the
family of nations. Three important events at the turn of the cen-
tury marked the emergence of the United States as a world power.
Those events were: the acquisition of the Philippine Islands, the
annexation‘ of Hawaii, and the promulgation of the Open Door
Policy in the Far East. No nation having distant colonies and

[39]

considerable trans-oceanic trade can pursue a policy of complete
isolation.

There is another and more powerful reason. why it hasbecome
impossible for the United States to maintain its policy of Isolation.
That is the technological development of the past third of a cen-
tury, which has compressed the world into a small neighborhood

of nations. The airplane and radio have practically obliterated ,

-the mountain ranges and pceans that used to constitute Swell-
nigh impassible barriers between nations. The intimate contact be-
tween nations today is closer that that of adjoining villages a gen-
eration ago. It is absurd to talk about national isolation when it
is possible for every human being on earth to hear the voice of
one man in the same split-second. What nation can live to itself
in an age when airplanes span oceans and continents in the space
of a few hours?

Dr. Charles Hodges, in his book "The Background of Inter-
mztiomzl Relations", says: “VVith ‘all its resources making for a
‘self sufficient’ nation, the table of a typical American family
shows a heavy toll paid to other peoples: apart from exotic food
products such as coffee, of which the United States consumes one-
half of the world production, or tropical fruits like bananas eaten
to the number of four and a half billions a year, the American
demand is now drawing upon .what are no-w the new frontier
lands for grains, meats, and other foods——approximately two bil-
lion dollars’ worth of goods every year. Even the United States, in
spite of the varied circumstances emphasizing her isolation and
apparent self-sufficiency, is Well along the road of such practical
education in international affairs.” -

The most ﬂagrant violation of the Isolation policy was when
the United States became “associated” with the alliance of Euro-
pean powers in the war against the Central Powers. Almost as
soon as the Armistice was signed we again withdrerw into our
shell of ostri~ch—like isolation. With reference to the League of Na-
tions, the Permanent Court of International Justice, and the gen-
eral question of world security, we take the position that the rest
of the world can go its own way, while we proudly walk our way
alone. The avowed assumption is that the United States does not
need the cooperation of the rest of ~the world. -

However, since by our own deliberate action we became a
world power, We cannot escape the responsibilities and conse-
quences of our position. Since the opening of the Twentieth Cen-
tury, and more emphatically since the World War, American

[40],

 

isolation has"-‘become ‘,‘a myth, a shiboleth, a thing to be shouted
to the-skies on Fourth of July and- ‘violated the next business day.
While maintaining it in--theory, -we. have constantly violated it in
practice." So said Prof.]ohn B. Whitton of Princeton University.

Hon. Alanso-n B- Houghton, former Ambassador to.Germany
and Great Britain, speaking in favor of Amer-ica’s membership in
the W0-rld Court, said: “That singularly inept and silly notion,
more-‘or less prevelent, that unless we Americans consistently re-
fuse to work cooperatively with other people we may wake up
some-morning to find ourselves, by the diabolic cleverness of for-
eign‘ statesmen, hopelessly involved in European or Asiatic entan-
glements, may safely be put aside. It is a mere p/zantasy born of
an infw-z'o1:ity complex. It does not represent the sturdy good
sense and clear thinking and high self-respect of. the American
people . . .The time. has passed, if indeed it ever existed, when
we can safely think of America in terms of comparative isolation.
The facts of life deny it.”

Yet not all the facts that might be marshalled would be suﬂicient
to open the blind eyes and unstop the deaf ears of the Robinson
Crusoe Senators, who attempt to direct the international relations
of the United States according to a formula that has no existence
in fact. Unfortunately all-the other basic foreign policies of the
United States are predicated on the theory of Isolation.

2. FREEDOM or THE SEAS AND NEUTRALITY.

Freedom of the Seas, our second oldest foreign policy, has been
the source of much friction between the United States and other
nations. Inextricably linked with the doctrine of Freedom of the
Seas is the theory of Neutrality. The War of 1812 and our parti-
cipation in the World War grew out of our efforts to maintain
these two policies. Herbert Hoover once spoke of the Freedom of
the Seas as “another of these age-old controversies which stir men’s
minds and their fears. In reality in our day it is simply the right
of private citizens to trade in time of war, for there is today com-
lete freedom of the seas in time of peace.” '

That is an adequate deﬁnition of the doctrine which has caused
the United States untold grief. The War of 1812 is still being
paid for in annual installments. Brig. Gen. Frank T. Hines in
December, 1932, announced that there was an item of $4,000 in
the 1933-34 federal budget for pensioners of the War of 1812,
which presumably ended 122 years ago. The World War has al-
ready cost the tax—payers of the United States over $5o,ooo,ooo,ooo.

[41]

Calvin Coolidge estimated the ultimate cost of the World War to
the United States would approximate $1o0,ooo,ooo,ooo. The Free-
dom of the Sea: has proved to be an expensive doctrine of A meri-
can foreign policy. - '

The United States has held to this policy with tenaciousness at
every international conference since the day when Benjamin Frank-
lin urged its acceptance by Great Britain in 1783, at the close of
the Revolutionary war. However, even such astute diplomats
as Joseph Choate and Elihu Root were unable to convince
the other powers at-the Second Hague Conference in I907 of
the international ‘validity of this American policy. —Woodrow
Wilson sought to modify the Freedom of the Seas doctrine to
conform to his conception of a world-society. Under his formula
the seas would be open “except for the enforcement of internation-
al covenants.” Since the United States Senate failed to ratify
Wilson’s “international covenants,” American politicians continue
to talk glibly of the defunct doctrine—Freedom of the Seas».

The British attitude toward this article of America’s foreign
creed has been truculantly expressed by Sir Herbert Russell,
writing in the British Army and Navy Iournal. “In the past this
country (England) has never been confronted by a neutral so
powerful as to be able to dictate the principle of trading with
the enemy. Our navy has always been of such strength as to be
able to maintain blockade. Twentieth-century Socialism is chang-
ing all this, and quite estatically surrendering the trident to the
United States. There is no ‘bunk’ about American principles in re-
lation to peace or war. It is ‘America ﬁrst and the rest nowhere.’
That is a fine sentim.ent—for Americans. But it means that other
people’s wars must not interfere with American business with
these people. This is the real gist of the demand for freedom of
the seas. In peace it can be put into conventions, treaties, pacts
and all the rest of the gold-fountain-pen, horn-rimmed documents.
In the deadly struggle of modern war no nation is going to accept
defeat because of scraps of paper. America quite realizes this,
and so she wants the most powerful Navy in the world. In other
words, her conception of the freedom of the seas appears to be,
supremacy on the seas to enable her to carry on ‘business as
usual.’ ” — ‘

Perhaps Sir Herbert Russell is a bit too vigorous in his interpre-
tation of American naval aspirations. However, he is perfectly cor-
rect in saying that the gist of our policy means the right of Amer-
icans to do “business as usual” regardless of “other people’s wars.”

[42,]

 

Americans should not forget the fact that we were on the verge
of war with Great Britain in I_9I6—because of our insistence of
our neutral rights to trade where we pleased, regardless of a war-'
time blockade.

The absenceof the United States from the League of Nations,
and the uncertainty of America’s position owing to her policy
of Freedom of the Seas and Neutrality, prevented the League from
effecting an early solution of the Sino-Iapanese dispute. How
could the League of Nations effectively carry out an economic
lnlockade against an outlaw nation, if the United States insisted
on her neutral right to trade with the outlaw state? We would be
aiding and abetting international anarchy. When we did take
our positive position on the Far Eastern situation, on January 7,
1932, Iapan had consolidated her conquest of three provinces of
China. Our attempt to play a lone hand in the diplomatic game
further complicated the conciliation machineryo)‘ the League.

If the United States intends to maintain the Freedom of the
Seas policy, it will be necessary to have a navy suﬂiciently large
to ﬁght the combined navies of the world, if necessary. There are
plenty of jingoists in the United States who advocate that insane
naval policy. However, the attitude of Congress for several years
has been opposition to competitive armaments and favoring gen-
eral armament reductions.

The naval appropriation bill signed August 29, 1916, carried a
“rider” which stated: “It is hereby declared to be the policy of the
United States to adjust and settle its international disputes through
mediation or arbitration, to the end that war may be honorably
avoided. It looks with apprehension and disfavor upon a general
increase of armament throughout the world, but it realizes that
no single nation can disarm, and that without a common agree-
ment upon the subject every considerable Power must maintain a
relative standing in military strength.” Then follows an authoriza-
tion for the calling of a general disarmament conference, and
provision for suspension of the appropriations in-the event of in-
ternational disarmament agreement. Since that time other naval
appropriation bills have carried similar riders. It is evident, there-
fore, that the United States does not intend to use military sanc-
tions to enforce ‘her policy of Freedom of the Seas and Neutrality.

The maintenance of national policies by armed force was ad-
vocated by Theodore Roosevelt.‘ The War Department manuals
still state. that “a sound. military policy comprises the adoption and
application of measures necessary for national defense and for the

protection and the promotion of national policies.” Ambassador
Hugh Gibson, spokesman for the American delegation at the
World Disarmament Conference in Geneva, suggested that mili-
tary forces should be limited to the strength necessary, first, to‘
maintain internal order; second, to defend the national territory
against aggression and invasion. ,,
Since the Kellogg-Briand Pact, war is no longer a legitimate
method or instrument for maintaining national policy. Herbert
Hoover said, in an address in Salt Lake City during_ the 1932 cam-

. paign: “All these (war) experiences have impressed on my mind

with ineradicable vividness the colossal error of war as an instru-
ment of national policy. I have learned the futility’ of waras an
instrument of national policy.” — ~ :: ‘ t

The attitude of the higher naval officers is -ablvy. expressed by
Admiral W. V. Pratt. In an. article on “Our Naval=Policy” in the
July, 1932, Naval Institute Proceedings, he said that America’s
naval policy might be summarized as: “The right to a navy on a
parity with that of any other country, built progressively and evenly
to such size as may be determined by treaty agreement, and main-
tained at strength adequate at all times for the defense of national
possessions and rights and for the protection of American life and
property Wherever unstable conditions require such action on our
part.” - .

The United States may continue to hold the doctrine of Free-
dom of the Seas and Neutrality, but in view of such international
treaty engagements as the Kellogg—Briand Pact, it is unlikely that
any attempt will be made to maintain the policy by use of armed
force. The policy is not only untenable in an interdependent world;
it is anenforcealﬂe in ‘a world internationally organized. '

3. MONROE DOCTRINE

The Monroe Doctrine, while a direct outgrowth of the policy
of Isolation, is a counterpart of the' European theory of Balance of
Power as a formula for securing international stability. Recent
extensions of this American regional doctrine are seen in the
Japanese proposal for a pan-Asiatic hegemony, and the French
plan for a ‘United States of Europe.” Professor Hiram Bingham
calls the Monroe Doctrine an “obsolete Shibboleth.” Certainly
since the .World War and the creation of the League of Nations
the operation of the Monroe Doctrine has been greatly restricted.

The idea back of the Monroe Doctrine was that since the United
States abstained from participation in political affairs in the old

[44]

.world, European powers must refrain from,,,“meddling in cis-
-Atlantic'.afI'airs.”. Alexander Hamilton, writing in the Federalist

in 1787 said: “Let the thirteen States, bound together in a strict
and idissoluble Union, concur in erecting one‘ great American

system,’ superior to the control of ialltransatlantic force or inﬂuence,

and able. to dictate the terms of the connection between the old
and the new.world.” V .

"'v-"While the Monroe Doctrine is a unilateral policy of the United

States, its validity has been recognized in a number of multilaa
teral treaties. Albert Bushnell Hart, in his book The Monroe Doc-
trine, observes: “It forbids the annexation by European powers
of Latin-American territory; it is a well-settled principle that the

' United States may annex what she pleases.” This we have done

on several occasions, and that fact has caused the Latin-American
republics to look upon the Monroe Doctrine as an instrument of
American imperialism.

Since the United States became a colonial power in the Paciﬁc,
the Monroe Doctrine has lost much of its raison a"etre. The United
States is hopelessly entangled in the net-work of international
relationships. Geographical propinquity has lost its meaning. The
world is a unit. Whatever good purpose was served by the Monroe
Doctrine in the Nineteenth.Century, it serves only as a cause of
friction and suspicion during the Twentieth Century. It is more
and more openly resented by the nations in the Caribbean and
in Central and South America as an infringement of their national
sovereignty. They cannot forget the “rape of Panama.”

Professor Iames Wilford Garner, in a lecture at New York
University in 1927, said: “Considering that the Monroe Doctrine,
as now interpreted, instead of promoting mutual goodwill and
conﬁdence in the United States, is the cause of general complaint
throughout Latin—America, of irritation, of distrust, and estrange-
ment; considering that there is little if any danger to our peace
and safety today from European aggression in Latin—America,
that the more powerful states of Latin-America do not need or
want our pro»tection—-it is hard to see what we are getting out
of it today except ill-will, abuse, loss of trade, and increased taxes
for the upkeep of a navy which we are constantly told must be
powerful enough to enable us to defend the doctrine as We inter-
pret it.” -  _t. . '

Under the Hoover. and Roosevelt administrations there has
developed a drastic change in American policy under the Monroe
Doctrine. Thewithdrawal of American marines from Nicaragua,

[45].

 

Santo Domingo, and Haiti is a concrete evidence of this change.
Another evidence is tacit consent to intervention by the League‘
of Nations in the boundary dispute’ between Paraguay and Bolivia.
The practical effect of this change of policy was brought home to
American investors in Latin-America, when President Hoover
declared that they must hereafter depend for protection on the
local governments, and not upon the armed forces of the United
States. The revised Monroe Doctrine means a new respect for the
dignity and sovereignty of the Latin-American republics.

Brig. Gen. George Richards, of the United States Marine Corps,
writing on “The Monroe Doctrine: Its Application of Today,” in
the October, 1932, United States Naval Institute Proceedings,
said: “Regardless of interpretations advanced by changing admin-
istrations as to our responsibilities under the Monroe Doctrine,
that doctrine is not of itself so much a policy as it is a tradition.”

As a “tradition” we may continue to cherish the Monroe Doc-
trine. As a foreign policy it is no more defensible t/zan pan-Asian
hegemony under Iapanese aegis, to which the United States vehe—
mently objects as inconsistent with world security.

When Charles Evans Hughes was Secretary of State he said
in an address before the American Bar Association in 1923: “The
Monroe Doctrine is distinctively the policy of the United States;
the United States reserves the right to deﬁne, interpret and apply
it.” Replying to this statement, Prof. D. Y. Thomas in his book,
One Hundred Years of the Monroe Doctrine, observes that “such
a reservation is nothing less than a cry for the maintenance of the
old conditions of international anarchy which gripped the world
before 1914 and led to the cataclysm of that year . . . If the world
is to go on in the old way, each nation for itself, getting all it
can, and letting the devil take the hindmost, then we should by
all means hold on to the Monroe Doctrine and turn it to our
advantage in economic and political imperialism.”

4. OPEN Doon POLICY

The Open Door Policy of the United States in the Far East
is-now offset by Iapan’s Asiatic Monroe Doctrine. The Open Door
Policy was first given diplomatic expression in Secretary of State
John Hay’s celebrated notes to the major powers, dated September
6, 1899, and Iuly 3, I900. The second note reads:

-“The policy of the Government of the United States is to seek
a solution‘ which may bring" about permanent safety and peace
to China, to preserve. Chinese territorial and administrative en-

[45]

-£::x:..«.:: ~ -

tity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and
international law, and safeguard for the world the principle of
equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire."

The Open Door Policy stopped the territorial spoilation of
‘China by other nations, either directly by annexation or through
“spheres of inﬂuence.” This policy was adopted just as Japanwas
emerging as a formidable world power. Soon after, in 1902, the
Anglo-Japanese alliance was concluded, which meant that the

control of sea power in the Far East passed from the hands of

Great Britain to her ally, Japan. This alliance, which was defensive
and not offensive, was followed two years later by the Russo-
Japanese War, for which it paved the way. Then in 1910 Japan
annexed Korea, ﬁnally achieving the object of her struggle with
Russia.

The United States watched the rapid rise of Japan with far
more than academic interest. When Japan in 1915 made her fa-
-mous “Twenty-one demands” on a China prostrated in the throes
of revolution, President Woodrow Wilson, through his Secretary
of State, William Jennings Bryan, made a vigorous protest:

“The Government of the United States cannot recognize any
agreement or undertaking—impairing the treaty rights of the
United States and its citizens in China, the political or territorial
integrity of the Republic of China, or the international policy rela-
tive to China commonly known as the Open Door Policy.”

In spite of this protest, Japan succeeded in wringing conces-
sions from China that would later make it possible for her to do
with Manchuria what she had done with Korea. The first real
clash between the Japanese policy of Asiatic hegemony and the
Open Door Policy of the United States, came to a climax at the
Washington Conference in 1921-1922. The primary purpose of
this historic conference was two—fold: (I) the reduction and
limitation of naval armaments by the five major maritime powers;
('2) the question of peace and security in the Paciﬁc area.

One of the results of this conference was the Four Power non-
aggression treaty signed by the United States, British Empire,
France, and Japan, which marked the termination of the Anglo-
Japanese alliance. ‘Another result was the Nine Power Treaty,
which guaranteed “the territorial integrity and administrative
sovereignty of China,” giving full treaty recognition to the Open
Door Policy.

_ Another and very far-reaching result of the Washington Con-
ference-was the adoption of a naval agreement that gave Japan

['47]

 

control of waters in the Western Paciﬁc.lAnother important re-
sult was the abrogation of the Lansing-Ishii Agreement between
the United States and Japan concluded in 1917, which recognized
Japan’s own “Monroe Doctrine” regarding China: “Territorial
propinquity creates special relations between countries. The United
States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, par‘-
ticularly in the part to which her possessions are contiguous.”

Japan suffered a severe blow at the Washington Conference and
the American Open Door Policy received world—wide acceptance.
During the years since the close of that conference Japan has
gone forward with her deﬁnite policy of ultimate economic and
political control of the Northeast provinces of China. At the same
time China became less able to maintain her own territorial in—
tegrity and administrative national sovereignty. Then with the
suddenness of a typhoon came the Japanese, descent upon Man-
churia in the latter part of 1931. To United States diplomacy
this was a ﬂagrant violation of the Open Door Policy, as well as
the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine Power Treaty. It was the
first supreme test of the Open Door Policy. ‘

On January 7, 1932, Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, sent
identic notes to Japan and China notifying them that “the Ameri-
can Government deems it to be its duty to notify both the Imperial
Japanese government and the government of the Chinese republic
that it cannot admit the legality of any situation de facto, nor
does it intend to recognize any treaty or agreement entered into
between those governments, or agents thereof, which may impair
the treaty rights of the United States or its citizens in China, in-
cluding those which relate to the sovereignty, the independence,
or the territorial and administrative integrity of the republic of
China, commonly known as the Open Door Policy; and that it
does not intend to recognize any situation, treaty, or agreement,
whichmay be brought about by means contrary to the covenants
and obligations of the Pact of Paris of August 27, I928, to which
treaty both China and Japan, as Well as the United States, are
parties.” . I

This famous “Hoover—-or Stimson——Doctrine” had its roots
in the similar note sent by Wilson and Bryan in 1915. It met with
an indignant reception in Japan, and indifference in London and
Paris. Secretary Stimson’s open letter on February 24, 1932, to
Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, was in effect an open letter to the whole world, repeating
the inﬂexible position of the United States on the Open Door

[48]

 

Policy. On March II, 1932, the Assembly of the League of Na-
tions, sitting in extraordinary session on the Sino-Iapanese dis-
pute, adopted the American doctrine as its own. This epochal
resolution contains these words: “The Assembly, considering that
the provisions of the Covenant are entirely applicable to the pres-
ent dispute—declares it incumbent upon members of the League
of Nations not to recognize any situation, treaty or agreement
which may be brought about by means contrary to the Covenant
of the League of Nations.”

Although it was a bitter ‘pill to the isolationists, the United States‘

was compelledﬁby the logic of necessity to cooperate with the
League of Nations, including having an oﬂicial member on the
Lytton Commission appointed by the League to investigate the
actual facts in Manchuria. The United States, however, absolutely
refuses to cooperate with the League in the use of either economic
or military sanctions as provided in the Covenant of the League
of Nations. The positionof President Hoover‘ all through his ad-
ministration was that legal and moral sanctions are adequate to
enforce the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and to outlaw a nation violating
its treaty pledges. Apparently President Roosevelt holds the same
VICWS. -

There the matter rests as ‘I935 begins, with ]apan’s denunciation
of the Naval treaty and with the Open Door Policy imore like a
door slammed with a bang in the face of the nation that originated
the policy. The only way the United States can enforce the Open
Door Policy, if legal and moral sanctions fail, is to use military
force. Such a method, however, is absolutely negatived by Wash-
ington; Our present policy seems to be continued non-recognition
of the legality of ]apan’s fair accompli “until Iapan, bleeding to
death in Eastern Asia or starving to death in Tokyo, yields to the
coercion of moral forces.” Or will Japan’s Asiatic “Monroe Doc-
trine” be substituted for the American Open Door Policy?

5. PROTECTIVE TARIFF

Regardless of which political party is in power, the Protective
Tariff has been a deﬁnite policy of the United States since America
became a world power. Originally designed to protect our “infant
industries,” the tariff has operated to develop those supposedly
puny infants into lusty giants of monopoly. Today the Protective
Tariff as reﬂected in the Hawley-Smoot Bill is -responsible for a
Hood of customs reprisals against the United States throughout
the world. -

[49]

 

Oz/er lzalf the governments of earth oﬁ‘icz'ally protested the adop-
tion of this /zig/2 tariﬁ.

The Protective Tariff Policy of the United States has been ut-
terly ruthless in application, as it was purely selﬁsh in conception.
Writing on “American Commeréial Policy and the World Crisis”
for the Foreign Policy Association, Maxwell Stewart said: “While
maintaining a tariff that is one of the highest in the world, the
United States has sought to prevent foreign retaliation by the
inclusion of most-favored-nation clauses in commercial treaties con-
cluded with foreign nations. The effects of the Hawley-Smoot
tariff act have by no means been conﬁned to American imports,
for practically every country in the world has followed the’exam-
plev set by the United States and raised import duties. Seventy-six
nations or colonies advanced their tariff rates between July 1, 1931,
and May 1, 1932.?’

The Protective Tariff as a foreign policy of the United States,

under present interpretations, is suicidal in an interdependent
world such as the one we now live in. It is based on a narrow
nationalism, and has been fostered by vested monopolies against
the interest of the United States’ citizenry as a whole. It has
served its day and generation and now remains to block progress
and blight the prospects for international accord.
M The living principle in America’s foreign policies is as old as
the government itself. That vital principle is that instruments of
peace should be substituted for implements of war in the arbitra-
ment of disputes between nations. Today most ‘of the thinking
people in the United States are aware of the fact that we are no
longer living in Nineteenth Century isolation. They know that a
world that is economically interdependent must cooperate politi—
cally in the solution of common problems.

[59]

 

 

VII
INTERNATIONAL HYPOCVRISY

I . SECRET DIPLOMACY

Nations do not object to playing the role of hypocrite. Always
hypocrisy has been the cardinal virtue of diplomacy. This seems
to be just-as true in 1935 as it was before Woodrow Wilson coin-
ed the slogan: “No secret diplomacy; open covenants arrived at
openly.”.In spite of the fact that all treaties are supposed to be
registered with the League of Nations, there are persistent sus-
picions that there are numerous secret “understandings” and so-
called “Gentlemen’s Agreements.”

Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske has charged the nations with
the practice of gangsterism. To be described as “gangsters” is
not very ﬂattering to the nations that have signed such gentle-
manly documents as the Covenant of the League of Nations, the
Charters of the World Court and the Hague Tribunal, and the
"Kellogg-Briand Pact, making war an outlaw method of settling
international disputes. Are nations inherently hypocrites, that they
can be classiﬁed as “gangsters”? As a matter of demonstrable
fact, theory and practice, resolution and action, are anything but
synonymous terms in the international ﬁeld. The Rooseveltian
motto: “Speak softly and keep your powder dry,” characterizes
therpolicy of all the major powers. '

2. SELF-DEFENSE

All highly armed nations hide their lethal weapons behind the
moth-eaten cloak of “self-defense.” The Kellogg-Briand Pact
states: “The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement
or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of
whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall
-never be sought except by paciﬁc means.” Before France agreed
to sign this anti-war instrument, which she had proposed.

France made this reservation: “The renunciation of war thus

proclaimed would not deprive the signatories of the right to legi-
timate defense.” And Secretary Kellogg agreed, saying oﬂicially:
“There is nothing in the American draft of an anti-war treaty
which restricts or impairs in any way the right of self-defense.
That right is inherent in every sovereign state and is implicit in
every treaty.” '

There you are! The nations solemnly agree to renounce war—-

“[51]

except when a question of self-defense is involved. What nation
in modern times ever went to. war, except. in self-defense? All
wars are defensive, according to the national viewpoint.'The most
glaring example of national hypocrisy on the question of self-
defense was ]apan’s undeclared war on China. The one ground
on ‘which Japanese statesmen justify ]apan’s action in using the
weapon of war she had renounced is the old Vbogey—self-defense.
Under the guise of self-defense, Japan has seized—by force-—
and now' occupies——by force—four provinces of China with an
area larger than the combined territory of France and Germany.
Japanese statesmen attempt, by a ‘Iesuitical sort of reasoning," to
reconcile their mad military venture with Iapan’s peace pledges
in the Covenant of the League of Nations; the Nine'Po‘vver Treaty,
guaranteeing China’s territorial integrity and administrative‘ sov-
ereignty; and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, renouncing war " as an
instrument of national policy. The more honest Japanese apologists
frankly admit that the self-defense idea has been stretched to'~iri-
clude the necessity of creating a buffer-state in Manchuria against
a possible thrust against Iapan by Russia. ‘ "
The Lytton iCommission reports that ]apan’s use of military
force at the start of the trouble in Manchuria “cannot betregarded
"as measures of legitimate self-defense.” Since the publication of
the Lytton Report, Iapanese statesmen have largely "abandoned
the self-defensehypocrisy. Now they take the chip-on-the-shoulder
position: “We have grabbed what we wanted; we dare you to take
it away from us! Anyhow, you did the same thing.” Thus they
thumb their nose at the League of Nations and the United States.
And the United States and certain other nations hypocritically
point the ﬁnger of scorn at Japan as the lone anarchist in the
world-neighborhood. —

3. SCRAPS 01? PAPER

Japan is not the only waste-paper basket ﬁlled with scraps of
international paper. So long as the nations spend from fifteen to
ﬁfty percent of their national budgets for armaments, peace pacts
and peace machinery in the form of League and Court are worth
no more than the signatures of the nations they bear. It is simply
plain hypocrisy for the nations to_say they renounce war as a
means of settling disputes, and then go ahead piling up imple-
ments of war that give the lie to their pious declarations.

Everybody remembers the hypocritical slogan of World War
days: ”La guerre contre la gucrre.” Then we tried to make our-

[52]

 

selves believe it was true. Now we know that “the war ‘to end
war” was_ a piece of, diplomatic propaganda. Just plain bunk! Back
of the pious" slogan’ was the assumption that Germany. ‘was the
sole war-maker. Another fraud! 0 b

It is more than seventeen years since the close of the “war to
end war.” _Today the hope of ending war is about as far from
being realized as it “was when the Armistice was signe,d.$In every
corner of the world there are hates and fears, rivalries and hostili-
ties-——the aftermath of one war; the seed of another. We are liv-
ing under a temporary truce, based on fear and maintained by
force. There can ‘be no enduring peace so long as nations say
“Peace? Peaceli  there is no peace”+bccau5e their huge arma-h
mcnts ma/(éit/2e‘z'r ‘peace declarations not/zing but scraps of paper'{'

"Another fallacy especially propagated by the military cliques in
every nation, is the doctrine that armaments are a guarantee of
security and peace. Anybody that reads history, however, knows
without any peradventure that “preparation for war leads to war.”
If the World War taught any lesson at all it was that competitive
armaments lead inevitably to war. Frank B. Kellogg, in an ad-
dress in Paris on Iuly 4, I932,"- said:

“What does the history of the last war teach us? . . . The real
cause lay deep in the political system. National jealousies and as-
pirations, racial hatreds, distrust, and fear had divided Europe
into armed camps. Her statesmen had attempted to prevent war by
military alliances and ententes, calculated to maintain the balance
of power and entailing inevitably a competitive increase in arma-
ment. As a result peace was not maintained but most of the nations
of the world were involved in a conﬂict in the direct cause of
which many of them had no part.”

The United States has taken the lead in the movement for re-
duction and limitation of armaments; yet the United States spends
about the same percentage of its federal budget for armaments
as other powers. We do a lot of soft talking about peace in the
United States, but we keep our powder dry. We know that talk
is cheap, and we are willing to spend as much as $900,000,000
in a single year getting ready for the next war.

We hear a lot of glib talk about national defense expenditures
being in the nature of insurance against war, at a small premium.
And the dumb taxpayers of this country are paying $2,000,000
(Every day for this insurance; forgetting that they also pay, every
day, an installment of $5,710,000 toward the cost of the wars
of the past. After all, tax-bills are not scraps of paper!‘

. 4. FALSE-FACES

Saying one thing and meaning something quite different is not
very good form between friends. However, diplomats always wear
false-faces and speak with ventriloquist voices. National policies
are subject to national interpretations. What does the Monroe Doc-
trine mean? We have refused to deﬁne it, and insist that it
means whatever we say it means at any given time. So with most
national policies.

Take-the tariff question. We smile coyly at Canada, for ex-
ample and sing te deums to four-thousand miles of unfortiﬁed

. boundary for over a hundred years. Behind the smiling. mask. is

the grim visage of a nation building a very un-neighborly trade-
barrier. The British Commonwealth of Nations counters by talk-
ing Anglo-Saxon solidarity, and at the same time whispering be-
hind its hand, “Buy British!”

Take the Open Door Policy. We flirt with Japan and profess
undying friendship for the Nipponese. Then we concentrate our
combined ﬂeets in the Paciﬁc. Japan replies with honied words,
and proceeds to build up her navy to treaty limits. The talk of
peace is negatiz/ed by preparation for war and by warlike gestures.
We blandly notify Japan that she_must not grab Manchuria, and
Japan laughingly accuses us of grabbing Texas and California and
Panama. We say We did that before we signed the peace pledge,
and Japan intimates that she——-and all the rest—signed the pledge
with their tongues in their cheeks. Behind the smiling masks are
mailed ﬁsts.

Take the League of Nations. We call it an unholy alliance de-
signed to maintain the status quo in Europe, and we refuse to
aﬂiliate with such a plunderbund. At the same time we have about
three hundred citizens of the United States in Geneva, oﬂicially
representing our government on various bureaus and depart-
ments of the League.‘We deny the paternity of the child we
fathered and abandoned on the international doorstep. But we
shut our eyes and enter by the back door and fraternize with our
illegitimate oﬁfspring. We profess the doctrine of Isolation, but we
practice cooperation——when it suits our fancy, and when it is im-
perative. _

Take the war-debt issue. We joined in a World War and gladly
loaned our Allies $1o,ooo,ooo,ooo to prosecute the war for us while
we were getting ready to fight. We insisted that this loaned money
be spent in our own country for war supplies at exhorbitant

[54]

.- ..s2:e.>z~/cw,‘

 

ﬁgures. Congressmen openly decl-ared, when they voted for the
loans, that they did not care if they were never returned. The
money was used to ﬁght our battles. Now we demand our “pound
of ﬂesh,” and call the European governments “welchers,” when
they ask that we share the burden of war’s aftermath, as they have

- agreed to share it with Germany. They accuse Uncle Sam of

wearing the mask of Shylock.

Why lengthen the list? The whole range ofinternational rela-
tions is honeycombed with hypocrisy. The time has come when
diplomacy must come out into the open. World Friendship must
be something more than a pious slogan. Let the masks be re-
moved! The time for masquerading has passed. All the world is
sick of playing the diplomatic game of hide-and-seek.

As long as national actions, especially in the ﬁeld. of war prep-
amtiom, do not conform to international peace declarations and
resolutions, nations will remain what they are_—hypocrites. The
end of such international hypocrisy will inevitably be the destruc-
tion of civilization. The handwriting is on the wall!

[ 55]

 

VIII
AMERICA’S MANIF EST DESTINY

The history of the United States is a concrete example of the
power of a dominant idea in directing the trend of national devel-
opment. Following the star of “Manifest Destiny,” the people of
the United States have had three goals: (1) Democracy; (2) Im-
perialism; (3) World Unity. Two of these aims have been attain-
ed; the third is yet to be achieved.

I . ' DEMOCRACY

Individual liberty and representative government were- the ideas
that obsessed the minds of the founders of this Republic. The
laissez faire doctrine of the French Revolution, and the Magma
C/zarta of England form the background of America’s_ﬁrst ven-
ture in following the gleam of Manifest Destiny. In the begin-
ning that destiny was considered as applying solely to the people
who sought liberty in the New World. Later America came to
consider herself as a torch in the hand of Providence: “Liberty
enlightening the World.”

The American experiment in democracy was thought of as an
example to be followed by peoples and nations everywhere. With
evangelical fervor we lost no opportunity to propagandize the
world with our national “Idea of Freedom.” How well we have
succeeded history attests on four continents. Africa alone remains,
for the most part, in chains. The United States was a Moses and
Democracy was the Promised Land.

Prof. James A. Dealey of Brown University has well described
the American creed of democracy: “This democratic idealism can
be found dominant throughout the entire history of the United
States. From the very beginnings of national life it may be found
expressed in its historic documents, in the utterances of its great
men, and in the common everyday beliefs of the average man.
It is sometimes irrational and oftentimes visionary; but, wisely or
unwisely, the innermost conviction of the American people is that
every man inherently has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness; that governments derive their just powers from the
consent of the governed, and that the general welfare of the whole
people is best guaranteed through a republican form of govern-
ment organized democratically.”

Republics modeled on the American original once dotted the

[56]

map of the world. From Peking to Berlin, and from Angora to
Bangkok, political democracies supplanted the absolute monarchs
of the past. The fervent idealism that characterized the early
American patriots and later frontiersmen has been manifested by
the revolutionaries in other lands, who patterned their democracies
on the American model. Perhaps this is the best evidence that
America has been true to the first phase of her Manifest Destiny.

Today democracy is threatened everywhere by the emergence

‘of new types of dictatorships. Yet the "Idea of Freedom" is not

dead.

2. IMPERIALISM

With the annexation of Texas, California, and the Northwest
the United States ceased to think of itself in Colonial terms. With
the purchase of Alaska and the addition of Samoa the young
republic began to think in imperial terms. The acquisition of the
Philippines and Porto Rico, the annexation of Hawaii, and the
building of the Panama Canal deepened the impression that the
Manifest Destiny of the United States was to become the mightiest
world-power of all time. Since the turn of the Twentieth Cen-
tury the United States has consolidated its territorial and economic
imperialism until it has become the wealthiest and most powerful
nation on earth. The dream of empire has been fulﬁlled.

Under the aegis of imperialistic aspirations, the United States
has not lacked jingoists and chauvenists who proclaim that Ameri-
ca’s Manifest Destiny is the ultimate economic and political con-
trol of the Western Hemisphere. This doctrine, often enough
heard in the halls of Congress, has resulted in frequently express-
ed fears of encroachment on the part of our national neighbors.
This has been true more especially since our policy of making the
Carribean a United States Sea. However, the creation of the Pan—
American Union and the Conference of American States has
tended to allay somewhat those fears. Recent interpretations of the
Monroe Doctrine, and the withdrawal ‘of United States Marines
from Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Nicaragua has further lessened
the fear of American imperialism. ‘

The fact remains that the United States has achieved her im-
perial destiny. Increasingly we look to the Pacific Basin as the
arena of our expansions. The Open Door Policy and our develop-
ing trans—Paciﬁc trade bring us into intimate relations with China,
Iapan, and Russia. Particularly there is a clash between American
and Japanese territorial imperialism, and American and Russian

[57]

‘industrialization. Ultimate independence for the Philippines may
lessen strained relations with Japan. Resumption of normal diplo-
matic relations with Russiamay abate tension in that ﬁeld.

3. WORLD UNITY

Having attained an imperial position as a world power Ameri-
can statesmanship began to think of Manifest Destiny in the terms
of World Unity. With the zeal of an evangelist Woodrow Wilson
proclaimed this doctrine. In this he was but following in the
footsteps of two of his illustrious predecessors. When President
Theodore Roosevelt received the Nobel Prize at Christiana, Nor-
way, in 1910, he declared: '

“It would be a master stroke if those great powers honestly
bent on peace would form a League of Peace, not only to keep
peace among themselves, but to prevent, by force, if necessary,
its‘ being broken by others. The ruler or statesman, who should
bring about such a combination would have earned his ‘place in
history for all time and his title to the gratitude of all mankind.”

President William Howard Taft was the moving spirit in the
American organization known as the League to Enforce Peace.
Wilson took the idea of Roosevelt and the ideals of Taft and
wrote them into the Covenant of the League of Nations. The
other nations accepted the League, and then the United States
denied its American paternity and abandoned the child on the
international doorstep.

It should also be remembered that both the Permanent Court
of_ International Arbitration, and the Permanent Court of Interna-
tional Justice were largely the product of America’s dream of
world unity. Likewise the Kellogg—Briand Pact for the Renuncia—
tion of War, at America’s insistence,.became a World—pact signed
by sixty-four nations, instead of a bi—lateral treaty between France
and the United States. The United States has taken the lead in
the movement for world unity, in spite of the fact that Senate
action retards America’s full cooperation in the movements she
has mothered. .

Among the intellectual and industrial leaders in the United
States, internationalisrn has ‘supplanted narrow nationalism. There
is‘ a frank recognition of the fact that isolation is no longer pos-
sible, even if‘ it were "desirable. Manifest Destiny demands some
form of world political unity. The preservation of cz'vz'lz'zazz'on is

relations. They are the stars by which the world must today guide
its course—a world in which our country must assume its share
of leadership and responsibility. _

THE DAWN OF A NEW ISAY

I. THE CoLLAi?sE or CAPITALISM AND NATIONALISM

,. America and the world have reached the end of an epoch. The
{year 1935 marks the birth-pangs of a new era. The age that began
.with the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of political
.democracy has climaxed with a collapse bordering on chaos. “What

will happen next”? is the unanswered question on everybody’s

lips. No prophet has yet arisen with a, satisfying answer.

" Political and economic panaceas and nostrums there are ‘in

.abundance. Political quack—doctors and economic fakirs shout

their cock-sure remedies. Every diagnosis, however, reveals. symp-
toms in the social structure that indicate an incurable malady.
Plasters and salves and injections, desperately applied, may arti-
ﬁcially prolong the death-throes of a dying day. Not enough
attention is being given to the birth-pangs of the new day that
m.ust supersede the old.

The evidences of collapse are on every hand. “The aftermath
of the World War” is not a sufficient explanation. “The result of
technological development” deals only with surface indications.
“Centralization of wealth in the hands of the privileged few”
fails to probe the root of the trouble. “Civilization is doomed to
decay” is the philosophy of despair.

Why have eleven thousand banks failed in the United States
since 1921? Why are ﬁve million American workmen doomed
never to work again, as reported by President Hoover’s commis-
sion to investigate social trends? Why do a handfull of capitalists
control the destiny of the American people, as claimed by James

I Gerard and many others? Why has religion, for the ﬁrst time in

history, failed to give men hope of a better day?
These questions deserve answers in the terms of action, not

resolutions and slogans. Do these ugly symptoms of social and

economic decay point to Communism, Fascism, Socialism, or
Technocracy as the remedy? Or are these touted panaceas only
makeshifts of straw at which a droyvning world grasps? Whatever
proposed “cure” we may sample, the fact is increasingly apparent:
recovery demands a remedy equal to the spread of the disease.

Personally, I have arrived at the conclusion that no amount of
artiﬁcial stimulus will prove effective in reviving, permanently,
the old order. Capitalism, raised to its zenith in the United States,

[50]

 

-::.;.\'S/:;:x;-a , ‘

is gasping its ﬁnal breath. The political doctrine of laissez faire,

‘better known as national self-sufliciency, is as dead as the proverb’-

ial dodo. “Rugged individualism” as a philosophy of personal life
is as incongruous today as ‘a horse and Bug“-gy on Fifth Avenue.
The traditional work of the Church, the salvation of souls, is
barren-of meaning unless Society can be “saved.” ’ ‘

‘You ask me what is my remedy for saving our decadent social
order? Frankly, I do not believe it can be saved; it is altogether
defunct andnot worth saving. It has destroyed itself beyond re.-
pair. I look upon the present social order as a cumbersome ma—
chine whose creaking wheels are so hopelessly mired that no
amount of expert tinkering‘can' make it function. It blocks the
road of human progress and must be abandoned and cast aside.

If economic capitalism and political nationalism are no longer
tenable, what will take their place?~.-I do not know what will be
the form of the future social order, but I do know what will be
its ruling: 5pirz't.4Human ‘beings, and not property rights, will be
the core of the new economic order. -Human welfare, and not the
safeguarding of wealth, will be the summum bonum of the new
political order. Whatever the form, economic and political, of the
new order,- brotherhood—humanity—will be its guiding spirit.

It will not be easy for the people of the United States to prac-
tice the principle of brotherhood. We have been nurtured for three
centuries in theilaissez faire school. Ingrained modes of thinking
and habits of action are not abandoned overnight. It will be ex-
tremely diﬂicult for Americans to accept the Golden Rule instead
of our traditional creed: “Every man for himself, and the devil
take the hindmost.” The success motif, in the terms of amassing
wealth by personal initiative, is the bait constantly held before the
eyes of every school-boy. The new "social order presuppose: the
eradication of the idea that gat'm'r2g5weaZt/2 is the supreme goal
of life. i I ‘

2. CAN AMERICANS BE “Goon N1=.roHBoRs”?

Since the modern world is a single unit, geographically, ethni-
cally, and economically, it is inconceivable that the new social or-
der can be established in any one nation. I see no hope for a
humanized social order without world economic planning and
some form of world political control. Americans are strongly in-
clined to worship at the shrine of national sovereignty. It will
be most difficult to discard this hoary fetish. In no other country

I *5‘! I

 

are jingoistic politicians and chauvenistic newspapers quite so

vociferous as they are in the United States. To suchiblatant na-
tionalists, human brotherhood is a meaningless phrase.

There are evidences that the United States Government is be-

ginning to abandon its traditional policy of aloofnessfrom the
rest of the world. We have oﬂicial delegates or non-oﬂicial “ob-
servers” at all sorts of international conferences. There is a grow-
ing awareness that we are a member of the family of nations.
Soon the “irreconcilables” in the Senate and the “die-hards” in
Congress will give way to men and women of a newer genera-
tion, conscious that they live in a unitary world. This oncom-
ing generation is the hope of a new world order, based on inalien-
able human rights, secured and maintained by international eco-
nomic and political cooperation. '

Calvin Coolidge, voicing the newer American attitude, once
said: “The generally expressed desire of ‘America First’ cannot
be criticized. It is a perfectly correct aspiration for our people to
cherish. But the problem which we have to solve is how to make
America ﬁrst. We can make little contribution to the welfare of
humanity on the theory that we are a Superior people and all
others are an Inferior people. We are'not likely to improve our
own condition or help humanity very much until we come to the
sympathetic understanding that human nature is about the same
everywhere, that it is rather evenly distributed over the surface
of the earth, and that we are all united in a common brother-
/zood.”

In conclusion: whatever may be its economic frame-work
or political structure, the new social order will be motivated
by the spirit of human brotherhood. Can it be considered heresy
for America to abandon her old nationalistic and individualistic
shibboleths for the sake of a World-wide, humanized social
order? Our response to the call of humanity very likely will
determine the form and structure of the new order now at the
dawning.

At all events, Laissez Faire and Status Quo ‘are the defunct
gods of a decadent social order.

IS WAR INEVITABLEP

I . F ALLACIOUS ARGUMENTS.

Frequently when the question is asked: “Is war inevitable?” the
questioner has inrmind the familiar illogical syllogism known as

past [me ergo propter hoe: “There have always been wars; there- '

fore, there will always be wars.” This fallacy has‘ been applied-to
every entrenched evil of human origin ever since men began to
question the causes of events. Both logic. and history testify to the
invalidity of the post _/zoc argument as to war’s inevitability.

There are others who give an affirmative answer to the question:
“Is war inevitable?” on the ground that there is some inherent
trait in human nature from which war naturally springs. Perhaps
this idea originated in the theological dogma of the “total deprav-
ity” of human nature. To believe that war is inherent in human
nature, one would be compelled to believe that children are born
with a ‘homicidal instinct. . ‘

Even if we accept the doctrine of human depravity, and its cor-
ollary that human nature never changes, we must admit that
human conduct does change. The history of humanity is the re-
cord of the changing of human conduct, as man emerges from
the rule of tooth and claw and comes under the reign of law.
War is no more inherent in human nature than was slavery,

. poylgamy or witchcraft. Collective homicide (war) is no more in-

herent in human nature than is individual homicide (murder).

‘That is the verdict today both of science and religion.

Sometimes the question: “Is war inevitable?” implies that there
is no alternative to war as a method of settling disputes between na-
tions. That may have been true in the past. However, nations today
have joined in signing a universal pact renouncing war as an instru-
ment of national policy; and have jointly agreed to seek the solu-
tion of all disputes, of whatever character or origin, solely by paciﬁc
means.

There are five «well-recognized peaceful methods for the settle-
ment of international disputes: diplomacy, mediation, conciliation,
arbitration, and adjudication. These instruments have been institu-
tionalized in such agencies as the League of Nations, the Perma-
nent Court of Arbitration, the Permanent Court of International
Justice, embassies, consular oﬂiices, regional security pacts, and

[I]

numerous bi-lateral and multi-lateral treaties providing for concil-
iation, arbitration, or adjudication of disputes.
These various peaceful agencies for the settlement of internation-

 

al disputes are generally accepted by the nations; while war is "

not only outmoded as a method of settlement, but is practically out-
lawed. The nation that resorts to war as a method in settling any

-dispute, in contravention of its pledge in signing the General Pact

for the Renunciation of War, thereby brands itself as an interna-
tional anarchist.

When the question is asked: “Is war inevitable?” from the
standpoint of present world conditions and international trends,
a qualified afﬁrmative answer must be given, if one is honest and
faces facts realistically. If the major causes of war are not mitigated
or removed, and if the nations continue deliberately to prepare for
war, then war will be just as inevitable as the resultantof two
merged chemical elements.

2. TI-IE CAUSES OF WAR.

Today the major causes of war are fairly well known. They may
be divided into three categories: psychological, economic, and po-
litical. Every one of these factors is subject to human determina-
tion. War-hates and war-fears, the basic emotions‘ that sweep na-
tions into war, can be abated and controlled. National and racial
jealousies and rivalries can be curbed. Economic and political
ambitions or needs can _be met, or compromised by peaceful means.

National policies that tend to produce international friction can
and should be altered. Already the United States has modified its
traditional interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine in the interest

of promoting peace and friendship in the Caribbean and Latin.

American republics. Recently we have announced our willingness
to change, radically, our conception of the doctrines of neutrality
and freedom of the seas, in the interest of international accord.
Nations are slowly learning that most of their treasured national
policies are hardly worth preserving, if the cost of their preserva-
tion means war. ‘ '

Without doubt, the gravest threat to the peace of the world to-
day is the armament rare now under way among the major world
powers. In the summer of 1931, addressing the International
Chamber of Commerce in session in Washington, Herbert Hoover
startled the world when he announced that the nationsof earth
were that year spending seventy percent more preparing. for “the
next war” than they were spending in 1913, before the World

[2]

War. In 1935 the expenditures for war preparation around -the
world will aggregate more than $5,ooo,ooo,ooo. The menace is
far greater today than it was in 1931, when Mr. Hoover made his
dramatic plea for real disarmament.

3. THE ARMAMENT RACE.

In 1934 the war preparation expenditures o-f Iapan were 388
percent greater than in 1913; United States, 190.9 percent; Great
Britain, 48.8 percent; Italy, 26.3 percent; France, 25.8 percent.
Likewise the percentage of national budgets» devoted to war prep-
arations is assuming staggering proportions. In 1934 Iapan appro-
priated 43.7 percent of its national budget for war preparations;
France, 22.3; Italy, 20.8; United. States, 17.9; Germany, 17.1;
Great Britain, 16.4.

This acceleration in military preparedness is the most ominous
fact in the "current world situation. It will be remembered that the
Czar of Russia, in issuing the call for the first world peace confer-
ence at The Hague in 1899, warned the nations that the current
armament race, if not halted, would precipitate the most disastrous
war of all history. Fifteen years later his warning was fulfilled with
the accuracy of prophecy.

On the thirty-ﬁfth anniversary of the convening of that First
Hague Conference, on May 18, 1934, President Roosevelt, in a
special message to -Congress, uttered a similar warning as to the
present armament race, prophesying that war likely will be the
result, if the armament race is not speedily halted.

Unfortunately, nations still put their trust in armaments, even
though they have renounced war and agreed to use only peaceful
means in the settlement of their disputes. They have not learned
that preparation for war leads inevitably to war. Since the days of
Julius Caesar men have been repeating the old Latin slogan: Si
z/is ptzcem pare bellum: “If you wish peace, prepare for war.”
That is the most tragic fallacy in the credo of nations.

George H. Dern, Secretary of War in President Roosevelt’s cab-
inet, speaking on “Gains and Losses from the World War”' at the
Institute on International Relations in Riverside, California, in
December, 1931, made this statement: “The other object of the war
was to abolish war. That object certainly was not achieved, for
Europe is still a powder keg, and all nations are spending more
money than ever for military preparedness. However, we won
some things from the war that were not on the program. For ex-
ample, we had a complete demonstration of the fallacy of the old
