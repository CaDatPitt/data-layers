WHAT ‘S HAPpE;\}¢,J(, fo ’;kEE SPEECH 7

Be inning September 24, 8 men will stand trial in Chicago on
fegeral charges that they conspired to cause a riot during the
1968 Democratic Party Convention.

The government that has lied about Vietnam is now claiming that
the violence in Chicago was caused by a small group of "outsiders".

Tans DoE€ ,/\/£957’ /VIAKE §e<.+"AI€E’

Thousands went to Chicago to protest U.S. policies in Vietnam and
at home; there was violence in Chicago. But the President's Com-
mission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence said the follow-

¢ng:gbout1é»éu:s during the Convention:

"It was the clearing of the demonstrators from Lincoln
Park that led directly to the violence...literally, it
forced the protesters into confrontation with police."

"On the part of.the police, there was enough wild club
swinging, enough cries of hatred to show the presence
of what can only be called a police riot."

In fact, whenever the police temporarily withheld their attacks,
protest activities in Chicago turned out as planned and announced
without violence or interference with the rights of others.
