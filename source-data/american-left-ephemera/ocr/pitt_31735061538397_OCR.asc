dries, while the Linen Supply supplies and launders articles for
boarding houses, Pullman cars, hotels, restaurants, barber shops,
beauty parlors and the like. A special type called the Hotel
Laundry does the work of the guests in hotels, although some
hotels run their own laundries on the premises.

These laundries offer one or more of the following services:

Wet wash: when the laundry is returned damp for the

customer to iron.
Rough dry: when it is returned dry but not ironed.
Finished: when it is sent back perfectly ironed.

HOW THE LAUNDRY WORKS

As investigators for the League of Women Shoppers, we were
allowed by some employers to inspect their plants. An employer
of an average steam laundry told one worker from each main
department to show us through that department.

We began our inspection on the ground ﬂoor, where the
marking and assorting department was. Parcelled off in a corner
near the door, we found the markers and assorters.

Marking and Assorting Department

A young man of about 28 took charge of us. “First when the
driver brings in the bundle, it goes to the weigher,” he said.
“He puts it on a scale to see how many pounds there are. Then
I mark each piece with a pin to show who it belongs to." He
picked up a row of pins with small numbers stamped on them,
and continued. “That’s called marking. And lady, you ought to
mark those dirty socks!” He made a face. “And I'm not a bit
pleased with handling the dirty handkerchiefs and towels, either.
VVe haven't even got aprons to protect us and me with a kid at
home just aching to catch germs.”

He pointed to a man surrounded by soiled clothes. “That’s
Joe,” he said. ‘_‘He sorts them; separates the white and the colored
things-—you got to use different chemicals for the colored things.
Then he puts them in ﬁshnet bags, so the water can run through
in the washing machines. When Joe gets done they’re sent to the
kitchen, in the cellar.”

Kitchen Department

The kitchen was full of steam and machines. Water and soap
had spilled on the ﬂoor.‘ Men were walking around in rubber
boots.

A Negro man explained, “This is the washing place. Only
us men works here, no women. The washer gets paid the most.
He puts the dirty stuﬂ? in the washer machine.” He pointed to a
big tub-like machine that was swishing clothes around. “The
washer puts in the chemicals——soap and bleach and acid—I don't
know what all. He's got to know just what to put in for the
colored things and the heavy and light ones. Then he’s got to
rinse them; ﬁrst in hot water, then in cold. If he’s not careful, he
burns himself with that hot water.

“Then I come along,” he continued. “I'm a puller. I pull the
wet clothes out of the machine and I have to put my head in the
hole to pull them out and all the water runs down over my head.
I sweat, too, and I have to hold the wet things in my arms. I

stay wet all day. I been here 5 times in 5 years. Every time I quit.
I don’t like it.” He said this with feeling. .“No, it ain’t that way
in all laundries, but in most of them.

“Then I dump the wetthings in a cart for the wringer man,"
he went on. “He puts them in the extractor over there.” The
extractor was a big machine shaped like a drum. “lt’s got a basket
inside with little holes in it to let out the water. It goes round
and round at a terrible speed. It goes so fast it throws off most of
the water, and when the things come out, they’re nearly dry. But
there's one trouble with it. It gets the clothes all twisted up" in
hard tight twists, and the girls upstairs have to straighten them
out before they’re put through the mangle or ironed.”

We came to'another machine. “That’s a tumbler,” he said.
“Some people‘ want their things all dry, without being ironed, so
they’re put in that tumbler which throws them back and forth
with hot air coming in till they’re dry.”

F latwork Department

The ﬂatwork department was on the second ﬂoor. \/Ve went

iiupstairs and were introduced to a young woman named Elsie
-who showed us through.

“See those colored “girls,” she said, pointing to two girls who
were shaking out damp sheets. “I bet their wrists are tired. They

been untwisting and shaking out that heavy linen since early

morning. They’r'e called shakers. They put the Hat work on that

T  .-table when it’s been straightened out, and those feeders over
" there,” indicating two other girls, “they pick it up, give it a ﬂick

with their wrists to get the wrinkles out, and put it through the
mangle. That mangle looks like a huge rolling pin to me, only
with no ends on it, and an engine inside.” -It was a good descrip-
tion. She continued, “When the damp linen touches that hot
mangle you get steam, and unless there's real good ventilation it
blows up in the mangle girls’ faces. It’s so hot sometimes they
lose their ﬁngernails from the heat.” V

We walked around to the other side of the mangle where two
girls were working. “They take off the linen when it comes

10

 

through,” Elsie explained. “We call them takers oﬂ. My best girl
friend and I do that. You can’t leave a big sheet sitting around
so it’s folded when it comes through. See, they’re doing it now.”
The girls grasped the sheet by the corners, boosted it up in the
air like a big balloon, and met in the middle with it all folded.
Elsie was absorbed watching them. “We got to have a certain
rhythm so it goes quick,” she said. “Pretty, ain’t it?”

We noticed that everyone was standing, and commented on
it. “No,” Elsie said, “we ain't got chairs to sit down on. We stand
all day. I never seen a laundry with chairs, but I heard tell of
them. You see, we use wide motions with our arms and the boss
says chairs with backs would get in the way, and he can’t afford
to get any, anyhow. No, there ain't no chairs just to rest in ’cause
we don’t get a chance to rest. Of course, most of us got ﬂat feet
and pains. What do you expect?” ‘

Starching and Collar Departments

Old women were lined up behind tables in the starching de-
partment. W'e questioned an Irishwoman who said she was a
grandmother and had been working in laundries for 35 years.
“Yes, ma’am,” she said. “We use hot starch. There's only a few
laundries use cold starch. Cold starch is so much easier to work
with but it costs more. This starch is almost boiling. You got to
put camphor ice on your hands before you use it. New girls
who ain't used to it, their hands are all shrivelled up and cracked,
but after a while they get tough to it.” She held out her red
rough hands. “We're mostly old here,” she went on. “Yes, all
standing. The young folks don’t like it--it's dirty and smeary and
the starch machine cakes around the roller and you got to work
so fast you can’t clean it. .

“When we get done we send the collars to the drying room."

She showed us a room right next to the starchers. “Oh! Mother of '

God! Is it hot there!” she exclaimed. “We're so near the heat comes
out to us. Well, everything’s hot in a laundry anyway.”

The collar department was next. Women were working on
small presses. “When the collars come out of the drying room,
we collar girls press them on these machines,” one of them told

11

 

us. “We mostly all have to wear glasses. The white collars hurt
our eyes, especially Miss Binnie. Her eyes is terrible. You can see

, the electric light ain’t much good.”

Ironing Department

When we came to the ironing department a heavy-set Negro
woman took charge of us. “There’s lots of different ways of
ironing,” she said. “Shirts get done on the presses—different
presses for each part, like bosoms and sleeves and collars. That's
Mrs. Hunt,” she said, as we watched a weary-looking Negro
woman walk back and forth, tending three machines. “She does
half the shirts on one press and half on another, and then the
sleeves on another. She's walking back and forth all day.

“Other things, like underwear, goes to the body pressers. They
got an easy job. They just press the button and the press comes
down.” We stood and watched their mechanical motions. “They
sure get tired, though, using the same muscles all day,” she said.

“I’m a hand ironer. I use an iron just like you use at home.
I do the lace and the ﬁne parts after the body presser gets

through, and retouch all the other things.”

We asked her how she liked her job. ..

“Well,” she answered, “there’s two ways of looking at it. The
underwear is such a pleasure to press—so silky and ﬁne. You don't
want to rush over it but do it nice and slow, but we’re paid by
the pound and when we get them beautiful little baby dresses

.it’s like taking bread out of our mouths. So we just pray for

heavier things that ain't half so pleasant to do.”

Folders and Wrappers

On our way out we passed men and girls who were folding.

the ﬁnished laundry with lightning speed. They send it to the
assembly department where the wrappers prepare it for delivery.
Then the customers get it not knowing whatlhas happened to it.

CHAOS IN THE LAUNDRY INDUSTRY—VVHYP

The laundry industry used to be very proﬁtable. Its growth
has been enormous. Now it is in a chaotic state, with constant
12

 

price wars, failures and bankruptcies. Why? There are two” main
reasons. .

First: Little capital is needed to start a laundry and when a
business is growing and needs little money to start, it becomes
overcrowded with inexperienced people. This makes the industry
highly competitive. The owner of a large-and successful laundry
explains it: “There’s nothing the trouble with the industry. It's
the people who run it. A lot of them just rush in and open a
plant’ and think they’re going to make big proﬁts. They have
no money to start with so they buy machinery on time payment,
and the machinery and supply companies really sponsor them.
These men buy more machinery than they need and they don’t
even learn how to operate it. The majority of them are narrow
and uneducated. They have no idea how to run a business or
how to treat their employees. They're the ones who do all the
price cutting, and undermine the industry.”

Second: the laundry sells a service, not a commodity. Like’

all service industries, it was hit particularly hard during the de-
pression because it was one of the ﬁrst things women economized
on. Now, when a man has an automobile to sell, he cannot sell
it below a certain price and still make a proﬁt. He has to pay
for all the steel, rubber, paint and upholstery that go into it.
But when a man sells a service, he can sell it almost as low as
he- wants, and still make a proﬁt, because practically all he has
to pay for is labor power. Labor power is the work the laundry
workers-sell. There is an immense supply of labor power com~

‘ peting for the jobs in his plant. So he can pay his workers less

and less because there are always some people who will work for
lower pay than those who have the jobs. Since he can keep on
cutting wages almost indeﬁnitely he can keep on lowering his
prices. This is why there is more cut—throat competition in the
laundry industry than in one which sells a commodity.

The Union

Conditions in the laundry industry have remained in such
bad shape mainly because there has been no strongiunion to
force them to improve. Laundry workers are particularly hard to
organize. For one thing, three-fourths of the employees are

13

women. They feel that they are working in a laundry to piece out
the family income, until they get married, until their husbands
get a raise, until their children can support them, or until they
can get another job. When none of these things happen and they
grow old and are still working in a laundry, they tend to lose all
hope that anything can be done for them.

Laundry workers are also hard to organize because there are
so many men and women, Negroes and white people, and so
many different nationalities all working together in the same
place. In few other industries is this true to such an extent. The
different languages and outlooks of these groups make it diﬂicult
to unite them in a trade union.

But there is now a deﬁnite tendency towardorganization
among the laundry workers. Conditions are getting so bad that
the workers are forgetting their prejudices and fears. The repeal
of the Minimum Fair Wage Standards Law made them feel that
laws cannot be counted on. The cost of living has risen. Most
important of all is that there is at present a more efficient and
alive union than there was in the past.

In the past only shirt ironers belonged to the union. They
were the most important workers in the hand laundry industry,
and when the A. F. of L. formed the first laundry local in 1900
there were few steam laundries. As the steam laundries devel-
oped, with their many different types of work, there was no place
for the new workers in the union, and it was slow to reorganize
to admit them. This is one reason why the laundry workers have
been backward in organizing. But this is no longer the case. The

Laundry Workers’ Union now accepts all inside laundry workers.

Drivers are in another A. F. of L. union.

Until recently there were two locals in New York City. This
caused constant conﬂicts. In December, 1936, the New York City
branch was reorganized into one local——-Local 280 of the Inter-
national Laundry Workers’ Union. New, capable leaders have
developed among the members and for the ﬁrst time the union
is starting on a well planned, intensive campaign to unionize the
lmmdijv industry.‘

1 The \Vom:1n’s Trade Union League has always been active in organizing
these workers and is now working closely with the union.

Personal Stories

HE FOLLOWING INTERVIEWS illustrate conditions in the laun-

dry industry as the workers told them to us. In order to
protect the workers who gave us these interviews, all names have
been changed. ’

“I’M GOING TO TAKE OFF WY KID GLOVES"

Madge had three canaries and a cat. She lived in a small fur-
nished room. On a corner table was an empty goldﬁsh bowl.
oblong, with two small lamps placed neatly in it. There was a
bed, a two-bumer gas stove, a radio and a footstool. There
wasn’t room for anything else. We sat on the bed.

Madge had an honest, frank face, and we knew as soon as we
saw her that she would be glad to talk and would not be afraid.
She was a strong, red-faced American, 43 years old.

“So you want to know about the laundry, do you?” she
asked. “Well, you came to the right person. I’ve been at it 28
years. I’m as experienced as they make them. But, honey, I only
make $12.40 a week. Years ago it was $18. I’m a collar girl. I
damp, starch, examine, shake, clean, edge, and tip the collars. All
hat for such little pay.”
he drew a long breath. “We used to work 45 or 46 hours a
e k, even during the minimum wage.” The New York State
Iimum Fair Wage Standards Law, repealed in June, 1936,
e aired a minimum of 31 cents an hour for 40 hours a week,
11 payment of overtime at the same wage rate through 45 hours
eek. “We’d get stuck with overtime and no pay for it and it’s
ing a turn for the worse. After the minimum wage went out
hired an efficiency expert and he says, ‘I’m wearing my kid
2 0 es, but now I’m going to take them off. I'll handle the help
ay!’ -

They started cutting the hours so we can’t make the pay
15

    
  
 
 

 

we're supposed to. Some days they bring us in at 9:30 in the
morning instead of 8: go and then send us home early and when
pay day comes, we're short our regular pay. And when we have to
stand around waiting for work for a few minutes, they dock us
even if it’s only 15 cents. When they're getting so small as that,
we wonder where do we stand hereafter?

“And they cut some of the girls to $10, but when the bosses
heard the girls were going to join the union, they paid them the
$2.40 extra. When I went there three years ago, they promised to
give me $13, but I never got no more than the $12.40 and now
not even that; and they know my predicament, away from my
husband, and no one to help me. The nerve of them! My job
really calls for $18.”

Madge was in stocking feet. She bent down and rubbed her
toes. “Besides this, what are conditions like?” we asked her.
“Whew!” she said, “the toi1et’s ﬁlthy. You couldn’t stand the
odor, and there’s no running water. You have to climb on the
seat and up on the tank to get the water running. I told the
foreman, but he didn't bother to have it ﬁxed. The bosses know
about it. It’s been that way for months.” Although it is essential
to the health of the consumer as well as to the worker that sani-
tary conditions in laundries are good, this is not always the case.

“Then there’s no ventilation in the collar room. They keep
the windows closed, and won't allow them open. They say the
dirt would go on the collars, but I say ‘Better a little dirt than to
smother us.’ ” Bad ventilation is common in laundries.

“Then they cut down our dressing ‘room. They put a sock

    

it darner machine in it and said, ‘That’s big enough.’ And they
1 closed the ﬁre exit door.” Madge was getting angry. “They put

a big spike in the lock and pulled over the rack where the family
ironers put work on, right in front of it. Someone says to the
foreman, ‘That’s a violation.’ He says, ‘Violation or no violation,
we want it like that and it's going to be like that.’ It’s the only
ﬁre door down on our side, the only escape if there was a ﬁre.
We’d have to run the length of two buildings to get out.-It’s two
buildings broke into one.” In addition to ﬁre laws, State labor
laws and health regulations are violated at the workers’ expense.

16

 

 

“They’re always watching you- You're not allowed to talk
to nobody. If you do, you get a bawling out. All the foreman
ever does is bawl us out. The only other thing he does is pull
the drawers off the chain. The girls hang them up to dry, and
he gets $55 for that!"

At this point, the cat, which had been asleep under the bed,
awoke and ﬂuffed its back against our feet. “Oh, Mr. Tinkham,”
said Madge, “come here to me. I named him after a Senator in
Congress. Now, Mr. Tinkham,” she said, bouncing the cat in her
lap, “answer me a question. Do you ever think of eating those
nice little birds up there when I go out?” Madge started to open
the cage to take out the birds when we interrupted her. “Do
you ﬁnd working in a laundry bad for your health?” we asked.

“Well, when I ﬁrst started in this laundry myshoes had no
soles and my feet was wringing wet, and I got pleurisy,” she said.
“I was in bed three days and when I went back I caught it‘ again
fro the drafts in the laundry. Mrs. Jones rubbed my back with
s and put a piece of ﬂannel on it, but I didn’t dare stay home.
I c uldn’t afford it. I used to go inside and sit in the toilet. The
ot er girls would work harder so the foreman wouldn’t notice my
w rk was slow.

  
 
 
 

_“Most of us are so poor we formed a $1 club, so we can get
s me money in a lump to buy something we need. Six of us give
every week and we draw numbers out of a hat. The one that
d aws No. 1 gets the $6 and the one that draws No. 2 gets it the
next week, and so on till we all get it once. Then we begin over
again after six weeks.

“My hat and coat I'm wearing since my husband's mother’s
al six years ago. That was just before I left my husband."
he pointed to a large, tinted photograph of a man and woman in
edding clothes, which was hanging on the wall. “It’s been hard.
never had a decent meal since I left him, unless the girls invite
e home‘; Lunch is always cold. I was so hungry last Tuesday,
I sked Mrs. Jones to make me some spaghetti.”

We asked her what recreation she had. “I never put my foot
movies,” she said. “I got the radio. I had to turn in my

conditions. One of the girls couldn’t stand ‘it no more, so she
said, ‘This place has got to he unionized. The bosses treat us
like a bunch of beasts.’ I was the first one she spoke to and I
says, ‘Put me down. I’m in the union regardless what happens.’

“The union is swell. It’s going to do big things for us some
day. It’s the only way we can get any beneﬁt out of working for
those bosses. If working conditions is good, I’d like to stay in the
laundry." It's the only thing I like.”

NO VACATION IN 15 YEARS

‘It was only 7:30 but Harry was in bed. Candles were burn-
ing on the dinner table and his n1otl1er and father sat around
talking after a Jewish meal.

Harry looke(I out of his room, dull and tired. “What do you
want?” he asked. “Oh, all right. I don't mind." He pulled an
old-suit over the woolen underwear he had been sleeping in and
came out.

He was pale and fat with an unhealthy, bloated look. He
moved and spoke slowly as though he were only half alive. His
eyes were unsteady and he avoided looking straight at us. His
mother and father sat around looking suspicious. He gave them
a sullen look and said, “\Ve’re going out.” He walked heavily to
the door and we followed. I/V e went to a cafeteria nearby.

‘‘I can’t talk with them around,” Harry said. “They're always
after me, picking on me. I never get any rest. And in the laundry,
I ain't never had a vacation in 15 years. Fifteen years I've been
working in that place—yes, ma’am, and they always make me work
Christmas and New Years and Thanksgiving without giving me a
cent extra for it. When I ask the boss about paying me he just
turns the question off and walks away.” He spoke with resent-
ment. “I’m a watchman on holidays,” he said. “Just sitting
around. And every Sunday, too, from six to six. Saturday's my
day off. My people are strict Jewish and that's our holiday. The
rest of the week I'm a marker and sorter."

He took a gulp of hot coffee.

19

"I got to get up Monday mornings at 3 o’clock,” he continued,
“to get there at 4, and I don't get home till 6 or 7. It's 65 hours
aweek and they don’t never give me a day off with pay. I got sick
and had to stay home seven months with rheumatism I got walk-
ing around in that water in the laundry. I used all the money
I saved up when I was a street car conductor during the war, to
pay the doctor.”

A woman at the next table brought a dish of asparagus back
from the counter. “I can’t go that stuff,” Harry said, looking at it.
“I had it once, but we don't have it home. It costs too much.
VV e can’t buy fancy things like that. Who could on $14 a week?

“I got to give $9 to my mother and father for board. They ain’t
got nothing. Carfare costs me $1.20, and I got to have lunch.
I get hungry working from 6 in the morning. So what’s left?
Only a few cents for everything else I need. I can’t spend money
on just going out, having fun. I ain’t bought nothing for myself
in six months. I bought this suit two years ago and I've worn
it every day since—it’s the only one I got. Look at it.” The coat
was frayed and patched. It did not look warm.

We asked him about his health. “I never feel good,” he said.
“My feet’s always hurting, and besides the rheumatism I got
diabetes. How could a fellow feel good with no vacation in
15 years? Of course I can’t afford to take one. Say, lady, I ain't
no millionaire. Even a month at Palm Beach wouldn’t make up
for all those years.” Paid vacations are given only in isolated
instances. Some laundries let their workers take a week or two
oﬁ‘ without pay, but even the highest paid workers can seldom
aﬁord it. This has a disastrous eﬁect on their health. The bad
eﬁects are increased by the long hours they are forced to work.

“I never get enough sleep to make up for all I do. And in
the winter I got to carry bundles from that damp kitchen out to
the trucks in the cold air. My rheumatism gets so bad sometimes
I got to take a couple of days off. And they're after me all the
time,” he complained, “him and my mother. They’re always
whining why can’t I do better. But I ain’t got the strength to do
better.” He was nervously shredding his paper napkin.

“What good would it do anyhow with them bosses? They'd

20

 

never give you a raise nowadays. When I ﬁrst started they give
me $25. Then it went down until the depression come and it
was $9 a week for all them hours. That_ was after I *was sick
that time. A new boss took over the laundry’ and he wouldn't
take me back except for $9. But later on the drivers had a strike
and they won,‘ and the boss give some of the insiders raises andl
got $1 ‘more. Since then he jerked it to the 3514, I’m getting
now.”

He moved his elbow and knocked over his cup of coffee. He
wiped off his trousers, very embarrassed. “I'm always doing things
like that,” he apologized.

We changed the subject. Thinking of his family situation we
asked him if he ever intended to get married. “Who? Me? Get
married?” he said. “I used to have a girl. I used to go with her
about two years. But I guess she didn’t like me no more. I guess
she thought I'm too fat. But I can't help it. It’s what I eat.
I eat mostly bread and potatoes. I ain’t supposed to because of
my diabetes, but they're the cheapest. ' How could I get married-
no money——and what about my family? I wish they'd quit nagging
me all the time. What can I do? I'm all used up and I'm only 38.”

"I’LL HAVE TO APPLY FOR RELIEF”

“Oh, you want the Wilson sisters, do you?” said the Negro
landlady. “Well, they're the roomers way in the back. You got
to go through the Browns’ room to get to them. Over there, to
the left.” '

We went through a passage where two Negroes were gayly
talking about the policy numbers they had bet on that day.

Mrs. Brown was annoyed at being interrupted by someone
else’s visitors. Mr. Brown was sitting in shirt sleeves and sus-
penders with his feet on a table. We passed through to the next
room where the Wilson sisters lived.

It was the cheapest room in the house. Cold and bare, with
an iron bed and a green plush chair, it had little else but news-
paper photographs of Joe Louis and Paul Robeson on the wall.

Nettie Wilson wore an orange bandana on her head. "Her

' 21

 

sister was sitting on the be(l piecing together gaudy bits of mate-
rial to tack on the chair to brighten it up. The radio was blaring.
Nettie turned it off and introduced us to her sister. “She worked
herself to death in the laundry," she said. “Six years she’s been
working at it and she's not but 22. She got heart disease and
rheumatism, and laundry work is bad for that. She's been sick
ﬁve weeks now with no pay and the doctor says she should get an
easier job.

“But I’m still working in the laundry,” Nettie went on. ‘‘I’m
a mangle girl and it got me griped. What I want to know is if you
work in a laundry and the machine breaks down for four and a
half hours, do you get money for those hours—that’s what I want
to know? The machine broke down the other day and we had to
sit and wait there that long, and we never got a cent for it!” .

We asked her if she had been paid for waiting time when the
minimum wage law was in effect. The law required that it
should be paid at the regular rate.

“V/Vhat good did that part of the law do us?” she said, “we never
got a cent for waiting.

“I work on the night shift,” she went on, “ﬁve hours six nights
a week—from ﬁve in the afternoon till ten at night. But just a
few weeks ago, he cut us down to 28 hours, so now I only get $8.52
a week. That's all I got to live on.

“And you know what they do? When we was supposed to
get $9.86 a week, he only paid us $9.43. Then he came down and
said he’d give us 17 cents more and call it square. _We counted
it up and he made $27 that way on all of us put together.” This is
only one of the many ways which unscrujaulous employers use
to (‘heat their workers.

“Now he’s opening up a new shift. He's got a lot of work.
I guess he can undersell all the other laundries because he takes
it off us girls. He's getting new machinery but he’s not going to
ﬁx the building any. It’s got rotten ﬂoors and stairs and not much
ventilation. But he don’t care. He just stays in one place till
it gets condemned, and then moves to another.”

Nettie was the ﬁrst we had found who worked on the night
22

shift. “How did you happen 10 eh00se that sltilt?" we a.~{ke<l her.
“\Vell, my sister S‘l10\\'C(l me her job and 110w they got t0 ruxh.
My health c:ouldn‘t stand that so I asked 10 be put on the night
shilt, where the. lmurs ain‘t so long."
The sister l00l<ed tip lrnm her sewing. "It sure was a dog."
she said. “l“ir.st I worked by the hour. lhen the lorentan t0ld

me I'd be paid l)y the piece instead. lhe)‘ put a cl0cl; 0n the

mangle that c0unted every piece that went thr0ug‘h. and they
paid us girls by the 1,000. Naturally we hurried 50 as L0 make

he t00l< us 0ll piece w0rl<, and t0l(l us we had t0 put 0111 just that
much. mtly we g0t paid hy the limit‘. 50 we made much lc:ss."
t\'ettie interrupted. "()h, the way the‘; treat you! lt ain't
enough the way we got t0 w0rk—l)ut it's 50 dirty. lhe t0ilets l.\
awful. I can't urinate with all that dirt. I'm afraid I'll catch a

disease. 1 hold it till I get a pain. and then I just got t0 let her

go. One day a girl kicked 0\'er a t0ilet l)ecause it was sliaking 50.

I"(’('(1z'r.s‘

They had to put in another one. Now we'd like to kick over the
other old one so we could get another decent one.”

V “Mercy, Nettie,” her sister reproached her, “Ain't you
ashamed of yourself for saying such things before these ladies?
You ought to freeze up and be a frigidairel”

Nettie shrugged her shoulders. “They got a ﬁrst aid kit but
there ain’t nothing in it but a little ammonia in case you faint.
That's all they care—just to revive you for more work. There
ain’t no dressing room so we get lint all over our clothes, and they
get damp from the steam, too. There’s steam all over the laundry.
You got to have a closed cabinet to keep it out. But we ain’t got
that, so I got to hang my coat in the toilet to keep from ruining it."

An alarm clock rang down the hall.

“That’s that elevator boy got to get up and go to work now,"
Nettie said. “We don’t get much rest all night. The people that
room here work all kinds of hours and alarm clocks go off all
night. It’s kind of inconvenient all the way round. We got to
wait our chance to cook. Everyone cooks in the kitchen and
whoever comes ﬁrst gets the kitchen till they’re through. Some-
times it’s late at night before we get supper.”

“Where do you eat in the laundry?” we asked.

“There’s no place to eat. Might as well eat in a subway as
there. We got to eat on the mangle and the boss is always hol-
lering, ‘Don’t get grease on the mangle.’ He never cares about
us having to eat in that hot damp place because we can't afford
the price of a cafeteria. The Health Department got a law against
that anyhow. Besides, they ought to air the laundry out then."

“No, there ain’t no union there,” she said in answer to our
question, “but you know the boss wouldn’t be in favor of it. Most
of the girls likes the union but they’re scared. The bosses ain’t
fair to us. If one of them likes a girl, _she got to go to bed with
him or lose her job. And us colored girls gets treated worst of all.
If there’s a vacancy in the better jobs, they never give us a chance
at it. They give it to a white girl.”

“Nettie, ain’t you forgot something?” her sister asked. “The
Browns want to go to bed early tonight and we shouldn’t have
anyone going through their room much later than this.”

. ._,_._,.

 

“That’s right. You ought to go now, if you don’t mind,"

A Nettie said. We asked her one more question about her budget,

and she answered, “There ain't much use trying to tell you where
my $8.52 goes to. Of course I got to borrow all the time. I just
can’t live on that. I’ve got on so far because my sister helped me,
but now she's sick, I don't know what I’ll do. I guess I’ll have
to apply for relief.” Wages often fall lower than $8.52 a week

in the laundry industry. Laundry workers ﬁnd it impossible to

live on such low wages without outside help. By working, this
girl is losing money as compared with being on relief. Out of

her $8. 52 she must pay carfare to get to work and must keep up a_

certain standard of appearance. On relief, which is based on the
absolute minimum on which a person can survive, she would re-
ceive about $13 every two weeks.

“I’M SICK AND DISGUSTED"

Basement apartments are always hard to ﬁnd. Way under
the steps of a tenement house in Hell's Kitchen, we found it.
Hell's Kitchen is a slum district, one of the sore spots of New
York City.

We went down past windows that were so dirty you couldn't
see inside, past other windows, broken and patched with old rags
and shirt cardboards. In an alleyway, we came to a room that
had been built to store coal or furniture.

A small West Indian man with an apron tied around his waist
came to the door. He held a soup spoon in his hand. In the
room three other West Indian men sat hunched around a table.
A kerosene lamp was their only light. A rusty stove leaned in
the corner. Torn underwear, drawers and an undershirt, hung
above the stove drying. The four men lived together. The one
with the spoon seemed the most anxious to be polite. He offered

. us some stew which he had been cooking—poor stew, mostly po-

tatoes and water. While he cooked, he answered our questions

' about his laundry job. The others listened.

“I take off, feed the mangle,” he said. “Every person come I
show how to do. I am sick and disgusted. I make nothing. I

ashamedto tell——$1o a week for a strong man like me. Girls do

25

same job as me, but they get $12.40. I work 57-58 hour a week——
like that. “Te work ten and a half hour a day-sometimes eleven
hour. Last Friday was from seven» to seven. July 4 holiday,
from seven to 12:30.”

The little man was talking rapidly with machine—like gestures.
“Sanitary condition no good. No keep toilet paper. It terrible.
Make me sick. No so clean. Drivers have closet room for coats,
but we inside don’t. No e1oset—-no nothing. All keep on jackets
—no place to put. I sweat and sweat. Glass broken on mangle
window and steam rise up. I no machine! I'm sick and disgusted.

“Foreman hire and ﬁre. He can put down we work seven hour;
he can put down eleven hour—whatever he want. We no can do
nothing. VVe work fast all the time. Boss all time say, ‘Step up.
Step up!’ All the girls afraid. They do everything boss say.
But I say, ‘I have two hand. 1 can work two hand—-no more.
I no horse.’ So he no bother me so much. Boss is like animal.
You can’t believe how he is. Maybe sometime he try to bite.”
He got so excited he dropped the spoon he had been holding all
this time. He picked it up and continued stirring the stew.

“One girl cry every day,” he went on. “She sweat and sweat,
fall down and cry. Boss say, ‘Get up!’ One day she scream she
want to go home, but boss pale, make tight mouth, say, _‘No!
You stay!’ ”

“Are the girls treated worse than you are?” we asked.

“The boss no discriminate any girls,” he said. “But he dis-
criminate VVest Indian and Porto Rican men. I tell girls, men.
join union. They say, ‘All right. Come tell me when it started!’
One man say, ‘I alone can do nothing.’ I say, ‘One ﬁnger can do
nothing. But ﬁve ﬁngers make a ﬁst! Little by little this place
makes better with union.’ They have ﬁred Porto Rican boys.
They talk about union, and woman understand their language.
she tell boss, they ﬁred.”

A knock sounded on the door. He Went to answer it and we
looked around us again. The room was cluttered with broken
down furniture, thrown out by the tenants above; useless odds
and ends ﬁnally inherited by those in the basement. A china
closet stood out uncomfortably. It had no glass in front and

26

,___.._ n_-_, ,

 

no china inside. But some day tl1ey could fix it - perhaps.

The knock at the door had been a neighbor asking to borrow
something they did not have. The little man came back and burst
out again: “Girls must get 31 cents an hour. In my laundry men
do woman work, but less pay. Shake, feed, this is woman's job.
Men work hard—same job, more hour. I carry 500 towels-‘girls
carry 15, 20. Girls no so strong. They do easy work. Men push
truck 500 pound weight. Girls too light. Can’t do this. Boss
hire men—less women. -If he hire only men they would make
trouble for him.” Employers hired men in place of women to
evade the minimum wage law. But they could do this only in
rare instances because the men, who are readier to ﬁght for their
rights, would not allow it. Even if employers were able to do it
more often, it would not oﬁset the great beneﬁts which the large
majority of women gain through the protection of a minimum
wage law.

“I pay $10 a month for room,” he said in answer to our ques-
tion about his expenses. “Four of us live here. We all eat
together. I pay $3.50 a week for food. I drink one bottle of milk
aday. I need it. My stomach no clean and all time headache
from hot steam in laundry. There is heat, dust come in, breathe
mouth, cough.

“This suit I buy in 1925. I no buy clothes. How can 1? Ten
dollars a week. I have wife home in Jamaica. First I used to
send money home but now I can do no more. I have no money
for good time. Last time I go to show was two, three, years ago.
I sit down, cook, sleep. I have no save 18 pennies in 18 months
working. I am sick and disgusted.”

We got up to leave. “Wait a minute," he said. He put on a
cap and a worn overcoat and went out. In about 15 minutes he
came back, carrying two small bottles of orange soda and two
chocolate ice cream cones. He gave them to us. They all watched
us until we had ﬁnished and then took us to the door.

“SHE CAN’T HAVE ANY FUN”

Mrs. Puerto stood with her arms crossed, sullen and hostile.
Her husband had a headache and had a wet stocking wound

around his head. We were in the kitchen. The bath tub was
also the kitchen table. A board placed across the tub formed the
table. Smells from the toilets in the hallwayof the tenement
house mixed with smells of canned milk and stale meat. Un-
washeddishes and rags lay around. There were no windows and
the kitchen was the size of a large closet. A dark room next to it
contained a bed with no sheets, and blankets that were ﬁlthy
because the family could not afford to send them to the cleaner.
Father, mother and son slept here together. Paint was peeling
off the ceilings and walls of both rooms.

‘We tried to explain to Mrs. Puerto what we wanted. She
grunted and motioned to her husband. He was a small, thin, de-
leated man. He said, “She doesn’t speak very good English.
We're Porto Ricans.” Mr. Puerto did not want to talk to us but
when he saw that we were anxious to stay, he gradually opened
up. His wife stood in the doorway, annoyed and unfriendly.

“I'm out of a job,” he" said, “but my wife works in the X
Laundry. She has been there three years. At present her salary
is $12.40. She works ten hours Monday, eleven hours Tuesday
and eight hours the next three days. If she works overtime one
day, she works less the next day so he never has to pay her for
overtime.” He spoke clearly and well, showing that he was an
educated man. i

“Before the Minimum Wage Law she only worked three and
a half days a week and got 154 or $5 pay for it. That’s when I had
to go for relief. I didn’t want to go for relief. When the Mini-
mum Wage raised her salary to $12.40 a week, I went off relief.
But now last week the boss told the girls they would have to work
six days a week for the same pay. The girls were in an uproar.
They became furious and didn’t take it so well.” Many employ-
ers who claimed that they were continuing to pay the same wage
after the repeal of the old law got around it by increasing the
hours without paying overtime.

“Has she any other complaints?” we asked. He turned to her
and addressed her in Spanish. She shrugged her shoulders and
didn’t speak. He turned back to us and said, “According to her
character she has no complaint. But outside of that, they don't

28

 

treat the women the right way. If they want to use words out of
the ordinary, bad words, they do it. And they don’t forget the
hurry up stuff every day. The foreman does it. Most of the
women are Porto Ricans. They are always rushing the women.

“She is sick now. She has tonsilitis. Last week she was work-
ing in a hot room and they brought her to a cold room. They
changed her from the mangle room to shaking. She is not sup-
posed to complain about these things. There is no understand-
ing between the workers and the employer.

“She should go to a clinic, but she doesn’t like clinics. You
have to have pull to get what you want there. If clinics are for
poor people then why don’t they have them at night? Poor
people can’t get off from work. If they tell the boss they have an
ailment that needs care he'll say, ‘Perhaps you’d better look for
another job. I can get someone who won’t have to leave to go
to a clinic.’

“She complains of a pain in the back and in the neck, too.
But she can’t stop work. She has to stand on her feet all day.
She can’t even take a rest. There are no chairs to rest on. She
would like to stay home now for a few days to get well, but she
will have to go back to work. We have nothing to fall back on.
Next week the rent is due and we owe the grocer $6.” The low
wages paid to laundry workers make it impossible for them to
stay home and care for their health properly.

We asked if Mrs. Puerto could afford to eat good food. “Of
course her food isn’t good,” her husband answered. “It couldn’t
be. It takes money to eat well. We hardly live right. We are
only trying to get along on what little we have.”

The little boy came in from the bedroom. He was small for
his age, without color. He was shy and went over to his mother
and hid his head against her.

“See the boy,” the father said. “He is pale, but we do our
best for him. We see to it that he has enough milk. He has no

appetite but we give him cod liver oil and make him play in the »

sun. He even has punching bags and rings in his room.
“I myself hardly eat at all, only a couple of eggs—maybe some
cereal. Some days I don’t eat at all. I get so discouraged but I

29

 

have to keep sticking around, because I can’t leave her and the
boy. I’m tiredof this life—depending on her. I wish I could
get a job.” Most laundry workers have dependents on their
wages. The minimum wage of $12.40 for 40 hours of work was
absolutely iusuﬁieient to meet their normal needs. The eﬁeet of
such a low wage is ruinous to the health and happiness of the
family.

“She only works because I can’t get anything,” he said.
“Naturallyshe would like to stay home and take care of the boy
and the home. They are mostly foreigners in her laundry. Some
say it is because they are the only ones who would take that kind
of work, but it’s also because the boss can control them better.”

His wife spoke to him in an angry voice. He answered quietly.
“She doesn’t see what good this (loes,” he told us. “But she is
tired and irritable. She can't help it.”

We asked him if his wife had suﬂicient clothes. “She is wear-
ing my shoes to work now,” he answered. “Sometimes her sister
is kind enough to bring the boy something—but we don't buy
anything. I had to stop night school two years ago because I had
nothing to wear.

“Movies! Hmpl” and he smiled ironically. “We never go
anywhere. I read a little on weekends but I can’t read much be-
cause my eyes are bad on account of the poor lights. On week-
ends my wife does whatever work there is to do in the house. She
can’t enjoy herself. She can’t have any fun.

“What can she do about conditions in her laundry, you say?
Nothing. She never heard of a union in her shop. No, a union
is just. one more thing to pay money for. No, there is nothing the
girls can do if the boss makes them work six days a week for the
same money as ﬁve days.”

“I AIN’T STRONG LIKE I USED TO BE”

The place was crowded with knicknacks. ln the living room
were two china closets, and in the hall another one, all ﬁlled
with bric—a—brac, colored glasses, ash trays, and small china ﬁg-
ures; all arranged in good order and well polished. There was an
30

 

after—dinner coffee set of chocolate brown with colored designs.
The couch was of imitation leopard skin and one of the chairs
was of goatskin or white cowhide. There were several large vases
with artiﬁcial ﬂowers, and pictures on the walls. There were
bright curtains at the windows. ‘‘I always love a beautiful home,”
the wife said, “I always try to keep it nice.”

Her husband was a tall serious Negro who looked tired.

“It’s about time I stopped working in the laundry,” he said.
“I ain't strong like I used. to be. I'm not but 29. but I feel 100.
I’d take any other job that’d give me a living. I hate laundry work.
I’m a kitchen man, a washer, and that's one of the hardest jobs.
Your feet stay wet all the time. They're so wet they feel numb.
My job's the highest skilled but I don’t get but 1518 a week. And
out of that we got to buy our own boots and heavy socks and
aprons. Boots cost $4.90, socks 35 cents, and aprons $1.25. But
even boots and socks don’t keep the water out." Wet ﬂoors are
general in the kitchen department. In a survey by the Depart-
ment of Health in New York City, the stockings of 29 out of 38
men examined were found to be wet through. This often causes
colds, rheumatism and pneumonia}

His wife: “And you should see his arms. They look like a
butcher shop—all burned and seared from the chemicals.”

“I think conditions should get better,” her husband said.
“Every week it gets worse and worse. Got to do plenty of rushing.
The work piles up on us. They used to hire three pullers but
now they only got two and they got to do the same work.”

His wife: “My husband works like a beast—-specially Monday
and Tuesday.” -

“‘You see," he explained, “I work 14 hours Monday and 13 I

Tuesday. Then it gets less and less the rest of the week. lt’s never
less -than 57 hours a week. Monday I come in at six in the morning
and after six that night you're supposed to eat but they don’t let
you stop. You feel so worn out after all that. You don’t make
up for it the rest of the week.” Employers who collect laundry

only on certain days and do not distribute it over the week, en-
danger the health of their employees by overworking them.

“And that ain’t the worst,” he went on. “We got to take turns
cleaning out the sewer in the kitchen. It gets stopped up once a
week from so much dirt, and does it stink! lMy wife says she
smells me before I get off the street car.”

His wife: “I always make him pu-t on his other suit when he’s
that way. That’s the suit he bought last Easter. It ain’t paid off
yet and we can’t get nothing else until it's paid for. One night
I took a walk on 14th Street——window shopping. Everything was
so cheap, but I couldn’t buy nothing. I couldn't sleep all night
thinking I couldn't buy nothing for myself. I ain’t had my hair
done in a dog’s age. There was a big sign in a hairdresser’s:
‘Please don’t ask for credit.’ That’s why I can’t have my hair
done. I got to look ou-t for my husband. He comes ﬁrst.”

“How can we spend money on them things when we owe rent
and $10 on the furniture?” he said sharply.

His wife: “I know, but I would sure like to have some fun
sometimes. We don’t go no place. One evening we wanted to go
out together. When we was halfway downstairs we met the land-
lord and had to pay him. No fun that night. Sometimes we
take a bus ride to Pelham Bay. Last week we took the money to
ﬁgure it out and we couldn’t pay even ﬁve cents for a glass of
beer. I want to help my husband out, but I can’t get no work
now. The women want to give me an old dress or shoes for a few
hours housework. We’d'like to have babies bu-t we just can’t
afford it.”

“Well, we can’t,” her husband said, “and things look like they
was getting worse. Once when some of the boys was making low
as 28 cents an hour and they found out the girls upstairs was
making more, they was going to strike. The boss heard about
it and those boys got raised up to what the women was getting.
The foreman, he tells us not to tell no one else what we're making,
but we do. He’s always around watching. If he hears you talk
to someone he wants to know right away just what you said.

“None of the boys is union boys. Bosses ain’t in favor of the
union. If they know you belong you'll get thrown out. Some

32

i;.., _A

 

fellows came around to get the boys to join and when the‘ boss
found out one of them joined, he got ﬁred. Pets go around-
you see them—pss pss pss. They tell the boss everything.

“I think the union's very good. It gets you better hours and
you're treated much better. I’d join if the others would, but I
wouldn't join just me alone.” This is the sentiment of most non-
union workers interviewed. They favor the union but they do not
dare join because of the intimidation by their employers.

“HALF A LOAF’Sg BETTER THAN NOTHING”

Up, up we went. The stairs were steep and shaky. We climbed
four ﬂights, and the higher, the darker. _ We passed toilets in the

hallways and garbage pails outside doors. It smelled damp and '

dirty.
On the top ﬂoor we came to Mrs. Wolfe’s door. She was small,

’ stooped and old, about 65, with thin hair. “Come in,” she said,

and seemed relieved to have visitors even though strangers.

“Take a breath a minute,” she said, “It’s a pretty hard climb,
but I’ve been doing it 30 years now and I'm used to it.”

She sat down and, as if anticipating our next remark, said,
“Yes, I've got a nice place, cheery like. I do the best I can," and
indeed the contrast to the dark hallways was a pleasant surprise.

“There ain’t much to tell,” she started. “I’m a shirt folder
and ﬁnisher. I've been in this laundry ten years now. I made
$12.40 during the Minimum Wage, but when the Supreme Court
threw that out, the boss put his foot down on us. He cut. I work
piece work and try my best to make $12.40, but some weeks, no
matter how hard I try, I can’t make it. More often it's $10 or $1 1
a week. It ain’t like a union shop where the work’s divided so
everybody gets a chance. The others have the pick. I’m elderly
and I keep my mouth shut. Half a 1oaf’s better than nothing.

“You see,” she went on quietly, “they want young blood."
They ‘ain’t ﬁred any of us old ones yet but gradually they make
things miserable and you ain’t sure from day to day whether you'll

be ﬁred. If only there was a way a poor person could help them-

33

selves just to keep their head above water, the bosses wouldn’t do

 

this to us. When they make money they ought to try and give us-

a decent wage. The way it is, you have to look and see if you
have lunch money the day before payday comes around.” The
laundry that this woman works in is one of the most prosjwrous
of its kind. I

' “Mrs. V/Volfe,” we asked, “have you been working in a laundry
all your life?”

“Not in a laundry all my life,’ she answered, “but 1 went to
work before I was 12 years old. I used to scrub floors. I made 351
a month and that used to pay for my clothes. I was born right
here in New York, but would you believe it, I never saw Riverside
Drive till ten years ago. _ Min took me on a bus—Min’s my girl

9

- friend—and I says‘ ‘What’s this? Ain't it lovely over here?

VVouldn’t I love the water!’ Sometimes you choke up and cry
when you think of them things.”

Mrs. Wolfe expanded. “You see, in them (lays, people had
big families and not much money. My mother had 16 children.
She taught us from little how to get along. I’m sorry I didn’t
have much school. Not that I didn’t like it. I loved it. What
little reading and writing I know now, I picked up.” VVe
noticed a tabloid newspaper and a magazine dated three months
back on the table. I

“Then I got a job in a factory and l was there 33 years, until it
folded up. I got $3 a week, and I thought I was a millionaire
bringing it home. It was 24 years before I made $10 a week.
They’d raise us 25 cents a year. But you’d never leave that place
because at Christmas they’d give you a 335 gold piece and a box
of candy. ,

“VV hen I got out of a job, I had no money saved up for carfare
so I had to ﬁnd something around home. The man I used to buy
vegetables from spoke to the forelady at this laundry around
the corner where I'm at and they took me on.” There is nothing
unusual about the background of this laundry worker. Many
laundry workers are from underprivileged and uneducated back-
grounds. It is easy for employers to take adva.nt(tge of them
knozuing they have no [)reparati(m for other jobs.

“I was living right here then. Maybe you’d like to see my
home?” she said hopefully. .
She showed us around. “See,” she said, “I can go all around

. and tell you who give me everything. Min give this electric iron,”

she handled it proudly, “It’s the ﬁrst electric one I ever had. Her
mother give me this cut-glass bowl. Mrs. Schaeffer give me the
Candlesticks. Mrs. Noland give me this couch. Yes, I got good
friends, and they always remember me. This furniture I got from
coupons.” . ‘

She took us into her bedroom. “And this is my little room,”
she said. “Ain’t the curtains pretty? Don’t think t.hey’re new.’ A
friend of mine had them and was going to throw them out but
I says, ‘As long as you’re going to throw them out, I’ll take them.’
I dyed them with Time); and washed them myself. I wouldn’t
trust them to no laundry.” She continued, “This chair is an
heirloom from mama. Wait till I show you. See, it's one of them
old-fashion pot chairs. I carried papa on there 14 times one night.
He had a stroke of paralysis and he couldn't move.”

As we started back into the living room, a bug ran across the
ﬂoor in front of us. Mrs. Wolfe forgot her pride in her possessions.

“It’s these old buildings,” she said, “it’s only cold water ﬂats. N o_

conveniences. Not even a coal stove. I have to use gas to heat
up and make hot water. Now I hear they’re going to renovate
these old tenements and maybe I’ll have to move and pay $18 or
$20 a month. I pay $13 now. _ '

“Min gives me her cast-off clothes and.I ain’t ashamed to
say so. She’s been very good to me. When she was a young girl,
I told her she should get out of the laundry, not be like me. So I
dyed her dress for her, turned the collar and made it look real
nice, and she went down to the Telephone Company and got a
job. Later I heard she was working in another laundry, so I got
an hour off andwent down to see her. I told her to quit right
then. I asked her what was the trouble with the Telephone Com-

pany and she said they didn’t like her voice. I says, ‘Don’t worry,"

I'll ﬁx that in a minute. I'll teach you.’ She went back to the
Telephone Company and she’s been there to this day. ,
“And not only her. I got others out of the laundry. I'd

35

make excuses for them while they was looking for other jobs. I'd
say, ‘I want you to be ladies, not like me. You got an education.
I'm an old woman and can’t start out new, but you're young.’ "
Laundry workers cannot look forward to advancement in the
laundry industry. Higher wages and better working conditions
are the only things that can compensate for the drudgery of the
work.

“But me,” Mrs. Wolfe sat straighter. “I’ll work till the blood
runs out of me. If they're cutting wages after I been with them
ten years, what’ll they do next? The laundry is just like home to
me. All I want is a decent wage and nice conditions. I can't take
anything with me when I go. Just so I look decent when I go,
that’s all I care. There ought to be some way slaves like us could
get a fair deal. If all us poor people didn’t have children for ten
years, you'd hear them millionaires kick!”

“ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN WORKING IN A LAUNDRY"

A lively rummy game was going on-——talking and loud laughter.
There were Josie, her daughter and a young man. Josie, a viva-
cious Negro woman, was enjoying herself after a day of hard work.

She didn’t want to be interrupted. Who were we? VV hat did we

want? Who gave us her name? But when we explained she was
interested.

“Can’t get away from it even at home,” she said pleasantly.
“But it can't do no harm. If you got to know the truth, any-
thing’s better than working in a laundry. You got to be a horse
to stand it. When I come home all I can do is fall down.

“It’s a rush all the time. Before the Minimum Wage Law
I was making $9 a week, and the mangle girls only got $7 and $8
a week. The minimum wage raised those wages and now. I'm
getting $13.02 a week for operating a press. But the speed-up is
something awful. They never think you do enough for what
they pay you. Instead of taking on more girls, he left off some
and made the rest of us work twice as hard to make up for it. The
shirt girls make $1.2 5 for 100 shirts and it's just like ﬁghting a
war, running to make money all the time. They're wet from here
down.” She motioned from "her neck to below her waist. “The

36

 

 

blouse girls get a penny for folding and pressing a blouse and
that's a lot of work.” Laundry workers complain more about
speed-up than about almost any other phase of their work.

Her daughter broke in. “I work in the same place,” she-said.
“The bosses expect so much out of a girl.’ It's so unjust. He’d

cut wages now if he wasn't afraid. He don't know if we're strong »

or not."

Josie explained. “You see we had a union. Had about
sixty head signed up. But one fellow signed up and then
went and told the boss. The boss kept throwing threats and then
he ﬁred three fellows. He’s dead set against the union. He told
us before he’d have a union he’d close down. He told us that
union leaders was Reds and racketeers, but we know that ain't
so. He just said that to scare the girls.” Union intimidation by
employers is almost universal in the laundry industry.

“We heard tell,’’ her daughter said eagerly, “that the reason
you read about a racketeer in a union now and then is because
the members don't pay no attention to who's at their head. They
should keep track of what the heads do and if they don't like it,
pitch them out. The members are ‘IT’ and they can do what
they want if they stick together. There ain't no excuse for
crooked dealings.” _

“Don’t bother these ladies with that,” her mother said. “They
want to know about laundries. Now what happened in our laun-
dry is the boss did scare the girls about the union and they started
dropping out. Girls who've been working there for a long time
have lost all hope. When we approached some of them about
our union they just said, ‘I wouldn't do nothing.’ I told the boss
he could ﬁre me—I could get another job ’cause I'm a good
worker. It would help so much if we could get all the girls! He
wouldn’t ﬁre me if all the other girls would walk out, but some
of them wouldn't see it that way.” ~ ..

She motioned towards the young man. “Harry, here,” she
said, “he’s my girl's boy friend. He works in a union shop. He’s
a driver. They got a separate union, but the ones that works
inside got a union there, too, and it’s real nice."

Harry was proud. “Yes, Ma’am," he said. “It’s a union shop.

Nothing like what Miss Josie told you about. The boss in our
shop don’t dare do them things.”

“How do you work it with two separate unions?” we asked.
“Wouldn’t it be even better if there were only one union, with
drivers and insiders together?”

“Sure, I guess it would be better,” he answered. “But we got
a plan. We’re setting up a joint board. That means both unions
will have representatives on the board. We can elect joint shop
committees that can go together to the boss when anything's wrong,
and can call strikes when it's necessary. It'll be almost as good
as if it was one union. In our contract it says that if the insiders
go on strike, we can strike, too, to help them.” This illustrates
how the drivers, although organized on a craft basis, can work
eﬁectively with the insiders. - '

“Do the bosses try to intimidate the drivers as they do the
insiders?” we asked.

“They try,” he answered. “But it ain't so easy. You see, the
drivers work outside so the boss can't have his eye on them every
minute like he does the insiders. The insiders can't do nothing
the boss don’t know about. It’s much easier to get the drivers to
-join the union, and sometimes we even help get the insiders to
join their union.”

Josie stopped him. “You bet the boss watches us,” she said.
“Driving us all the time. You’d think I’d be a wreck, but my
health’s pretty fair from all I do. Last year I was sick five weeks-
just overwork. I just felt weak and collapsed at the press. I was
run down and needed rest. I found that was all it was, ’cause
after the ﬁrst week home I felt like a new person. Pay me? Pay me
never mind! He didn't even send me an orange. He kept send-
ing someone all the time for me to come back to work. They
don’t like to lose good people. The only way to get a vacation is
just stay home, because if you don’t feel good it don’t matter to
the bosses. You work for them till you fall down and what credit
do you get? None! They d.on’t care what happens to you.

“But in times to come when all laundries are union and there's
decent conditions I wouldn’t mind working in a laundry. It

38

 

iishould be that instead of people being ashamed to work in a
I laundry, they should be proud.

“Yes, sir, it’s pretty tough in this world nowadays. We spend
every cent. How can people expect us to live likeidecent Amer-
icans on $13 a week! There's nothing left. I can't afford to save

’cause I got to take care of my mother. I send her $2 to $3 a

week, depending on what I can spare. Mother's down South
now.‘ I miss" her so much. She used to do all the cooking. I’m
too tired to do it at night but I got to do it /no matter how I feel.
I'm even too tired to go to the movies, and when I start to read
I just fall asleep.” . I . ‘

She laughed in a good-natured way and said, “I’m sleepy now.

And I'm going to bed. I told you all I got to tell. I’m not going '

to say another word. But I sure hope you girls can help us do
something about it.” ~ -

I Working Conditions and Living Standards
WAGES

1-IESE workers tell the story of the whole industry, which is
Tconﬁrmed in further interviews by the League of Women
Shoppers. The laundry workers have no interval of decent human
existence. Their home lives are as wretched as their working
conditions. Their low living standards are the direct result of
their low wages.

In October, 1936, 73.6 per cent of the women employed in
New York City area made less than $15 a week} The wages
quoted in the foregoing chapter are by no means the lowest fdﬂﬂﬂ"
in this survey. Wages of women interviewed went as low as $6 a
week for 48 hours of work. One forelady was getting $8 a week
for 60 hours. Men received equally low wages. In Brooklyn 21
man whom we interviewed was getting $5 a week for 50 hours
as a shaker, and a puller who had a mother to support got $6 a
week for 60 hours.

The median wages for women interviewed in this survey was
found to be $13 a week? The median for men was $14.15 a week.
Union wages are far above the average. For instance, a union
shirt folder gets $1.95 for 100 shirts, while the average is $1.50 for

 

100; a union washer gets $40 for a 48-hour week while the average

is about $22 for a 55-hour week or longer.

The volume of business for New York State laundries in the
week ending October 1, 1936, increased 7.1 per cent over the
same week the year before,3 while prices stayed the sa1ne. For

' example: the net sales of the Consolidated Laundry Corporation,

which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, increased about
half a million dollars over 1935, their net income (profit) increas-
ing $246,366 for the year} In spite of this business improvement,
wages dropped during this period. The average weekly earnings
of women factory workers, including laundry workers, showed an
increase of 6.2 per cent from November, 1935,_ to October, 1936.
But in the laundry industry, while the median work week for
women and minors in-creased some 18 minutes, the median weekly
wage not only failed to increase but decreased 2 cents, an actual
decrease of the median weekly wage rate of 12 cents?

This decrease of wages occurred largely within four months
after the repeal of the Minimum Fair Wage Law by the Supreme
Court in June, 1936. The law was applied to the laundry industry
October 2, 1933, as a directory order, and became mandatory
August 1, 1934. It was ﬁrst applied to the laundry industry because
there were numerous petitions from laundries to apply it there;
and because it was a large woman-employing industry, recently in-
vestigated by the State, and known to be in bad condition. The
law was repealed before it was applied to any other industry.

While the law was in effect it raised the wages of the lower
paid workers and tended to stabilize the industry. But when
the United States Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional,
many employers started to cut wages. Others increased hours for
the same pay. Still others refused to pay when the workers were
kept. waiting for work, and thus reduced their wage below the
minimum. The State Labor Department found a greater wage
decrease in laundries employing from 10 to 24 workers. The

‘smaller, unstable minority were the active factor in depressing

the standards. Employers who wished to maintain high stand-
ards were unable to do so in the face of such cutthroat competi-
tion, and wages dropped quickly.

In a detailed study made by the New York State Department
of Labor, of the effect of the repeal of the law on the wages of
women and minors, it was found in New York City area that:

 

1 Salaries paid to 3 directors, who were also officers, amounted to $71,000
in 1935. Eight more directors, who were oﬂicers, received a total of $125,000.

In November, 1935, there were 247 employees not being
paid the minimum wage. « ‘

In October, 1936, there were 2,804 employees not being
paid the minimum wage, an increase of 1,035 per cent.

Similarly, in the State, the number of plants not paying the

minimum wage rose from 122 to 635, for the months mentioned.
This decrease in wages is at the expense of the lower paid

workers who in November, 1935, were protected by the law:

Employees paid below min. wage min. wage above min.

November, 1935 . . . . . . . . 1.4% 56.6% 41.9%
October, 1936 . . . . . _ . . . . 16.4% 40.4% 42.3% 1

Wages are falling at a time when the cost of living all over
the country is rapidly rising.”

Food: The retail prices rose 2 per cent between December,
1936, and January, 1937. Prices have risen 10 per cent in the
last year, and 41.4 per cent over April, 1933.

Rent: rose 1 1.2 per cent in 1936, and is still rising.

Department store articles are 6 per cent higher than last
year.

Men’s rlothing prices are to be raised 10 to 15 per cent on
top of a rise of 25 per cent over May, 1933.
Wholesale shoe prices will rise about 5 per cent this spring.

New York State has recently passed a new minimum wage law.
When and if it is applied to the laundry industry it may establish
a wage higher than the former law. The $12.40 or 31 cents an
hour for 40 hours work that the old Minimum VV age Board con-
sidered to be fair in 1933 was insufficient even then and is totally
inadequate now. It is difficult enough for one person to live on that
wage, but the majority of laundry workers have dependents 011
their salaries. Of those interviewed in this survey, 75 per cent
shared their wages with others in the family. This reduced the ac-
tual wage that the worker had for himself to a little over $8 a week.

Many employers now pay less than $12.40 a week‘. To live,
workers must seek supplementary charity or relief. What’ these
workers lose in wages, the taxpayers are called upon to pay. These
employers are asking the public to subsidize their laundries.

Wages for the same type of work vary widely. For instance,
"a folder who worked for ten years in one laundry received $10 a
week, while one who had only three years’ experience received
$17 in_another laundry of the same type and size. Wages are
more often determined by the individual employer than by the
actual value of the service rendered.

. HOURS

It has been stated that women’s hours in the laundry industry

have increased since last year. A law passed by the New York

State Legislature in 193-3 provides that no woman can work over S

48‘hours a week. ‘Among the women interviewed for this survey,
some were found to work over 50 hours, but the majority worked
less than 48 hours. The median hours for women interviewed
inlthis survey were 43 hours a week}

In general the burden of long hours falls mostly on the men.
Amon those interviewed, over three-fourths worked more than
8
50 hours and often from 60 to 70 hours a week. One man told
us:

“Sometimes it's 15 or 18 hours a day. Oh, my God! N o
wonder my back give way and I‘ got sciatic. The hours! If
we would work 12 hours it would be easy. \/Ve call this half
a day’s work.”

-And don’t forget your delivery boy:

“We, got no limit. to our hours. If someone wants their
bundle called for at 7 in the morning, we're there. If so1ne—
one wants it called for after they get home from work at night,
we're there. Our hardest hours are early and late in the day,
and we don't get a chance to rest in between either. If there’s
no delivering to be done we got to help around the laundry.”

 

1 The State Labor Dept. found the median hour rate for women in the
State to be 42.1.

43

Washer

Both men and women are seldom paid anything for overtime.

Housewives who have insisted on the traditional “Monday
\Vash” have no idea how this has affected the conditions of the
laundry workers. Men and women must work long hours certain
days, often straining their health and vitality beyond the power
of recovery during the shorter days. Many employers try to over-
come this by offering lower rates toward the end of the week, or
by regular collection schedules spread out over the week. The
public can relieve this concentration of work.

Holidays mean added speed-up for the workers. If the laun-
dry closes for a holiday, the quantity of work to be done remains
the same. Employers don’t consider hiring extra help. Holidays
are occasionally granted, yet many workers said they would rather
work those days than have to strain themselves making them up.

44

HEALTH ‘

The conditions in most laundries are disastrous to the health
of the workersas well as dangerous to consumers. Fastidious
people put on their bodies clothes which have been in contact
with dirt in laundries. They use towels and eat off table cloths
which have been handled by workers who were forced to go to
germ ridden toilets while working. They struggle to keep their
children healthy, yet they put them to sleep on sheets and pillow
cases which have been ironed by workers with colds and sore
throats, who were unable to stay at home to cure them.

Prominent doctors have found that the atmosphere in laun-
dries produces much tuberculosis, bronchitis, heart disease and
anemia} Laundries eonstantly generate heat and steam. Good
ventilation is imperative because even “a moderate warm tem-
perature endured for a whole day is far more dangerous than a
condition of high temperature and moisture endured for a short
time." 2 To protect the workers, the New York City Health De-
partment rules that “every such workroom shall be maintained
at a proper degree of temperature and humidity. . . .” But the
League of Women Shoppers found that this is seldom the case.
A kitchen man told us:

“The ventilation is awful. There's not even a fan in the
room. The walls and ceilings sweat terribly. It actually rains
down on us. I really was healthy when I started but the damp
and heat break you down. In two years you’re in pretty bad
shape. I get colds all the time.”

Ventilation is so bad in some laundries that in summer tem-
peratures sometimes rise to 120 degrees.

Added to the bad effects of poor ventilation is the fact that
laundry workers stand all day and are rarely permitted to rest.

This often results in ﬂat feet, varicose veins, uterine troubles and

other ‘ailments. A woman employed in a hand laundry says:

 

1Diseases of Occupation: Arlidge.
2“The Effect of Atmospheric Conditions on Health and Efficiency": S.
Wyatt, in Journal of Industrial Hygiene, July, 1925.

45

“N obody’s health is good in a laundry. I had a breakdown
from the work. Inhaling the steam keeps your throat dry and
standing all day keeps your feet swollen. Some women get
so weak they lose their grip in their hands and arms.”

It is possible to avoid these things. Laundry workers can sit
while working, but chairs are not provided for this purpose. Nor
are they provided except in rare instances for them to rest on,
although a State labor law requires that  . . if . . . continual
standing is necessary, seats . . . shall be provided in proximity to
the working places and their reasonable use permitted.”

The lack of rest periods is particularly harmful because the
workers must work at a terriﬁc speed. The larger, better equipped
laundries often resort to the speed—up to a greater extent thanthe
smaller ones. They copy the methods of Big Business by hiring
efficiency experts to get more work out of the employees. The
machinery in smaller laundries is often old and faulty, making it
impossible to get as much speed out of the workers. A ‘

The Health Department requires that “. . . every . . . place used
as a. laundry . . .shall at all times be kept. . . free from . . . dirt and
maintained in a clean and sanitary condition.” Yet ﬁlth is com-
mon. The ﬁlthy toilets have double signiﬁcance because the work-

'ers seldom wash their hands after using them. Manyworkers have

no time to go to the toilet as often as they should.

Few workers interviewed wore aprons while at work. They
should wear them to protect themselves against germs whichall
soiled laundry contains, and also to protect the clean ‘laundry.
Often workers have no proper place to hang their coats. They are
forced to put them on tables or hang them in unsanitary toilets,
even though a law requires that suitable lockers shall be provided.1

The majority of workers interviewed eat their lunches in the
hot steamy atmosphere of the workroom where they remain from
morning till night without fresh air. But the Health Department
demands that “where meals are eaten on the premises, a separate
room shall be provided.” The violation of this regulationgnot
only affects the health of the workers but it is bad for consumers

because workers eat on tables where clean clothes are handled.

The ﬂoors in the kitchens were found to be nearly always wet,
disregarding the State labor law that “the ﬂoor  under wash-
ing machines . . .sha.ll be provided with . . . drains suﬁcient . . .
to carry o[f all the water. . .”

These conditions are so prevalen.t that more than 75 per cent
of the workers interviewed had complaints on one or more of the
scores mentioned. The effect on the health of the laundry workers
is so great that some feel this way about it:

“If I could get something steady that wouldn’t pull my
health down so, even if it paid a little less money! Everybody
wants to live as long as they possibly can, after all.”

It is the industry which is responsible for shattering the health
of many of its workers. But besides the unpardonable damage to
them, it is the public that pays the bills. Employers do not give
their workers health insurance. They must go to clinics, supported
by the public. The community should not be forced to subsidize
unreasonable employers. The workers must have health in-
surance, but until that is possible it is imperative that they are
paid wages adequate to care for their health. v

UN FAIR PRACTICES

Laundry employers frequently resort to underhand methods
in dealing with their employees. These may take the form of
cheating on pay, charging a worker for a mistake which is not
her fault, and slipping in extra work. Listen to this woman:

“I’ve been working in laundries for years and I know all
the little tricks. Girls nearly always have to do wash-over and
they're not paid for it. And they have to do the bosses’ laundry
after the bell rings, without pay. And they’re not even allowed
to wash the uniforms they work in and have to buy out of
their own pockets. In some places the boss forces them to
bring in their wash and charges them for doing it. I been in
one place where they rung the bell for lunch at 5 minutes
after 12 and then rung it again at 5 minutes to 1, chiselling '
us out of no minutes. And if I come in a minute late I'm

docked a whole hour, but if they make me work an hour
overtime I don’t get paid for it. We got to work so fast we
haven't time to count the pieces, so sometimes the boss
slips things in on us.”

Playing one race against another is a well-known method of
exploitation. To quote a Negro girl:

“In our laundry they had only white girls ﬁrst. Then later
they started taking on colored girls but this is the way they
did it:‘ a colored girl would come in and the boss said, ‘We
can’t take you on. The white girls don’t want to work with
you.’ The colored girl would start to go and he'd say, ‘I’ll
take you, but you got to work for less money than the white
girls.’ They incited one against the other and later they cut

the white girls, saying they could get colored girls cheaper.”

In some laundries this race antagonism is nourished to such an
extent that the Negro and white workers are not permitted to
eat together even if they wish to. This discrimination applies to
foreigners as well. A Negro man testiﬁes:

“Most of the girls is Spanish (Porto Rican). The bosses,
every one of them, asked me if I was Spanish a dozen times.
They wouldn't hire no Spanish men, because they’d protect
the women. They got the women jumping over tables there."

A practice which affects the consumer rather than the worker
is as follows:

“You know, our laundry has two different names. If a cus-
tomer doesn't like the work and takes her bundle away, the
boss sends around another driver who says he’s from a laundry
with a different name. Then the customer gives him her
bundle and it comes right back to the same place. Customers
don’t pay attention to the addresses of their laundries.”

EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY

For a worker who is eager for education and ambitious for
the future, laundry work offers no opportunities and no possibil-
ities for a better life. For instance, a 21-year-old girl told us:

48

_‘‘I attempted to go to night school, but I fell asleep. After
standing 9 and 10 hours a day at work I couldn't stay awake.
I have ambition, yes, but it won’t do me any good. I used to
read my life away—Shakespeare, Dickens, Sir Walter Scott.
But then I decided it was no use and I dropped the whole
thing.

“Working in a laundry is not a very uplifting position.
If anybody wants to make a career it’s no good. Usually if
you say you’re working in a laundry people say, ‘Do you
wash?’ ”

And what about the worker who is growing old? One says:

“What hope have the young if this is their future? ‘I have
worked there for 15 years. I was making more 6 years ago
than now. Gradually we were cut to $11 a week. I got laid
off Saturday. They gave me my pay and said, ‘We don’t want
you any more. \Ve l1aVe to have younger help!’ ”

STANDARDS OF LIVING

The inadequate wages paid laundry workers means that they

' do without the things that make for decent, healthful living. To

some it means the lack of proper clothing. They do not freeze to
death in winter, but their insufficient clothes cause illness and
the wearing down of their resistance. To others, it means the
lack of proper food. They do not starve, but their food is poor
in quality or deﬁcient in quantity, or both. To others these low
wages mean living in unsanitary, unhealthful quarters.

These are not the least of the bad effects of such low wages.
Most of these workers have children dependent on them. Their
wages are not sufficient to support the children properly, and yet
society should not deny them the right of parenthood. The effect
of these wages on the health and education of the children, as well
as on the harmony of family life and the molding of character
therein, is enormous. The large majority of workers in the laun-
dry industry have been forced into it through necessity and lack
of education, due to low wages on the part of their parents. The
children of laundry workers have no other alternative than to face
the same environmental problems without the hope of progress.

WHAT LAWS MUST DO

ow CAN THESE CONDITIONS be corrected? Legislation is one way.
H You have seen that there are health regulations and State
labor laws which attempt to remedy some of the abuses in the
laundry industry. But now, at last, the way is open for one of the
most important of all remedies. The United States Supreme Court
has reversed its stand on minimum wage legislation, making it
constitutional. New standards in legislation can and must be set.

FIRST: the laundry workers must have a new minimum wage
which gives them more than a bare living; they must have one
suﬂicient to maintain the health and decency due every American
citizen. The 31 cents an hour under the old law was a danger to
the individual and to society as a whole. While it gave an average
increase in wages of over 20 per cent to more than two-thirds of
the women and minors employed} it was far too low to meet the
fundamental purpose of the law.

SECOND: the laundry workers must have a minimum wage law
which applies to men as well as to women. Women need the pro-
tection of a law ﬁrst because they are peculiarly subject to exploita-
tion;l their wages are 40 per cent lower than those paid to men in
the same industry? But this does not mean that employers do not
also take advantage of the men.

Now the Supreme Court has shown that the way is open for
legislation for men, as the League of Women Shoppers interprets
its decision. It stated the case in‘ terms of a class of workers, not
women alone. It said, “the exploitation of a class of workers who
are . . . defenseless against the denial of a living wage, is not only

detrimental to their health but casts a direct burden for their sup-
port on the community.” When workers, either men or women,
are not paid a sufficient wage, the public pays for it in relief,
clinics, and prisons and reformatories. The Supreme Court con-
tinues to say that the community may direct its law-making power
to correct the abuses which spring from selﬁsh employers.

THIRD: For the same social reasons, the laundry workers must
have a law that limits the hours they can work. Remember what
happened to the health of men who work such long hours in
laundries. The State provides for the women in this respect, pro-
hibiting them from working more than 48 hours a week, but the
men have no such protection. So far, the best legislation is a
national minimum wage and maximum hours foryall workers.

It may take some time to achieve these last two points. But
the ﬁrst point, a higher minimum wage, may be attained quite
soon, as New York State has just passed a new minimum wage
law for women and minors. This law, as did the old one, provides
that a wage board, composed of workers, employers and the pub—
lic, be set up in each industry to determine a fair wage for that
industry. When the wage board is set up in the laundry industry,
it will do the best it can but it cannot set as high a wage as it may
wish. The wage may be higher than 3 1 cents an hour but it will be
a compromise between what the workers really need and what can
be enforced. The board will consider not only the workers but the
employers. For, according to a member of the former wage board,
if it sets too high a wage, even the reputable employers will not
cooperate, and the State will be unable to enforce the law.

It is unfortunate that there is always a compromise when a
minimum wage law is ﬁrst applied to a sweatshop industry, but
this may be overcome after the law has been in effect for some
time. Consumers must demand that the board set the very highest
wage enforceable. Write to the Laundry Wage Board, State
Labor Department, 80 Center Street, Division of Women in In-
dustry. Also write to the laundry employers’ associations, which
you will ﬁnd in the telephone book.

But before the wage board is set up, the State must make a
thorough study of the cost of living, as the new law stresses this

factor} This will take at least until Fall. Then the Industrial
Commissioner must make a complete investigation of any in-
dustry where the law may be applied, to see if"wages' are low
enough to justify applying it there. This means that it may be a.
long time before the laundry workers are affected by the law.
The previous investigation of their industry must be brought up
to date or a new one made, -depending on how soon the law is
applied to them. In the meantime their wages are dropping and
the cost of living is rising.

Nor, in all probability, will the law be applied to the laundry

-workers ﬁrst. The State has recently made a detailed’ study of the

beauty parlor industry, so that will probably be the ﬁrst industry
affected. \/Vhich will be next? This may be largely determined by
the number of petitions the State receives during the summer from
people employed in or affected by an industry. Laundry workers:
write at once to the Industrial Commissioner of New York State.
80 Center Street, and remind him of your low wages. Consumers:

write and tell him how their low wages aﬁect you; urge the owner

of your laundry to write to the Commissioner. You must make the
State see how absolutely essential it is that the law be applied to
the laundry workers before the good eﬂects of the last law have
been completely destroyed.

LAWS ARE NOT ENOUGH

Laws, no matter how good, can be evaded. Even if the State
provides enough inspectors to police the industry, which was not
done during the old minimum wage law,2 a law cannot be well
enforced unless the workers report violations. But they are often
afraid to do this. One girl testiﬁes:

“We girls weren’t supposed to work after 1 on Saturdays
without getting paid for overtime, but the boss told us to put
on our hats and coats and keep right on working, and if an
inspector came, to tell him we were doing work of our own.
We had to do it or get ﬁred.”

 

1The former minimum wage law stressed the value of services rendered.
2The ﬁrst year no inspectors were provided for, the second year there
were 6 for the entire state, and the third year, 5 more.

53

 

And another said:

“After the minimum wage come in the boss would give
you the money he was supposed to pay and then take part of
it back. That’s called a kick-back. I was supposed to get
$12.40 but I only got $8. I told the inspector that I got
$12.40. I couldn't run the risk of losing my job.”

This proves the risk they run:

“The boss underpaid us girls and when we complained
an inspector came and made him pay in full. After that he
ﬁred two of us and said we were inefficient, even though he
told me the week before I was one of his best workers. We
heard later he was gypping the girls again, only this time he
overpaid some of them to get them to lie to the inspector.”

Since proper enforcement is impossible when the workers are
afraid to report violations to the State, what can be done to free
them from intimidation by their employers? The individual
worker is powerless. He knows that if he protests against what
he considers unfair, the employer can ignore or ﬁre .him. His
wages, hours and working conditions should be the result of a
bargain between him and his employer, two free and equal parties.
But the employer has the right to hire and ﬁre. He owns the shop
and the machinery. The worker possesses nothing but his labor
power, which can easily be replaced. He is not equal to his em-
ployer and is free only to take a job or quit it. It is only when he
threatens to withdraw his labor power together with that of all
the other workers in the shop that his strength approaches
that of his employer and a fair bargain can be reached between
them. Thus, when he is protected against an injustice by the threat
of group action, he will feel free to report violations of law with-
out fear of harm. This group action is called collective bar-
gaining.

Collective bargaining can only be accomplished through a
trade union. No other kind of group action is of value. Suppose
the workers in a plant are forced by their employers to join
together in a company union. The workers are crippled. Why?
Because such a union is always formed and controlled by the
employers; because the workers cannot withdraw their labor

54

 

power successfully. If tl1ey want to go on strike they have no
national union, free from the interference of their employer, to
give them ﬁnancial and moral aid. They are powerless to bar-
gain on an equal basis with their employers. This is one of
many reasons why company unions never do anything of conse-
quence for the workers. This is why employers prefer them to
trade unions.

Collective bargaining is not only necessary to enforce legisla- ‘

tion but it is more important than legislation in remedying the
conditions of the laundry workers. A minimum wage law can set
a bottom wage, but it cannot provide a wage increase where one
is due. No law yet provides for vacations. No law _can completely
protect the worker against speed—up, unfair practices, and dis-
crimination, or give him security on his job. The individual
worker can bring about these things only by joining with the

‘ other workers in a trade union.

HOW THE WORKERS FEEL ABOUT UNIONS

Collective bargaining is so important to the laundry workers
(and to all workers) that they will often risk everything to achieve
it. When an employer refuses to bargain with his workers to
remedy certain bad conditions, he forces them to go on strike in
protest. The workers do not want to go on strike. They do not
want to risk losing their jobs; walk up and down with cold hands
and wet feet in bad weather carrying picket signs. They don’t
want to have wives and children at home hungry because no money
is coming in. But the beneﬁts they derive when collective bargain-
ing is finally won make all these things worth while. A press
operator testiﬁes: ’

“Most of us girls was nervous about our jobs. We didn’t know
when we was going to get laid off. We was cut so much we couldn’t
stand it no more. And on top of that the boss would ask us to lend
him money, and when we said ‘no’ he’d take it off our wages any-
how, and if we said, ‘you can’t do that,’ he’d ﬁre us. bosses don't
like unions because they can’t do what they please with us. But we
joined the union anyhow and now we have decenthours and more

55

 

pay. And best of all we have a shop committee which judges fair.

“But we had to go on strike for 14 weeks to get it. It was hard.
It was the ﬁrst time most of us was on strike, and it seemed hope»
less. The union didn't have much money then and we only had
about 2 5cents a day to eat on. Some of the girls was afraid we
wouldn’t win and we had to encourage them. I heard one of the
bosses passed a remark that ‘when another pay day came and no
pay, see how quick you’ll come crawling back.’ But we thought
‘Better take it on the chin and suffer a little more, than go back and
work under those conditions.’ And we won. The reasons why
strikes are lost is because the workers don't understand and get
discouraged, and some go back to work. They think a strike can be
won in a few days without sacriﬁce. They think they can wait and
the union will come and say ‘All right, you've won. Go back to
work.’ They don't realize they’re the union and the union is. as
strong as they make it.

“When we came back we got a closed shop and the lower paid
ones got a raise. But the next year when the union signed the
contract with the boss, we all got raises. I get $17 instead of $15
and only 45 hours instead of 48 or 50, and I get time and a half
for overtime. The boss signs a contract with the union every, year
and that’s when we get our demands. And he knows he can't gyp
us on any laws. We'd go right and t.ell the inspectors.

“Our grievance committee has a representative from each
department and they settle all kinds of things, like arguments
between the girls, and if the boss is picking on anyone they stop
it. See that wooden door with the partition in front of it? ’Well,
before there wasn’t anything in front of that door, and when any
one came in, there was a wind from the street, and lots of girls
got sick. The committee talked about that at the meeting, and the
boss put that partition around it. They're talking about sanitary
conditions now. We've got to keep on the job to see that we
keep what we’ve won and get more each year.”

The workers know that this is what collective bargaining can
do for them. Eighty-three per cent of the non-union workers in-
terviewed for this survey were in favor of it.

56

 

Why, Then, Don’t They join the Union?

‘ Because they are terriﬁed of their employers. Investigators for
this survey saw this——workers afraid to talk to us on the street,
looking around to see if anyone was watching. Some of them were
cross-examined later by employers who had seen them talking to
us. We learned not to approach them near the laundry. We saw
workers cross the street to avoid meeting union organizers, and
yet in their homes heard them say that the union is a good idea
but will only get them ﬁred. Inside the laundries foremen came
and angrily pushed us out. Employers refused to let us speak to
the workers; some openly asking, “How do we know you’re not
from the union?” v

Yet the United States government says that the workers have a
right to join whatever union they please; that they have a right to
collective bargaining. This right is given them in the Wagner Na-
tional Labor Relations Act which was recently declared constitu-
tional by the Supreme Court. The following statement of a puller
shows the coercive practices that exist in the laundry industry:

“The boss didn't like the union at all. He ﬁred a lot of us
because we joined. He called us aside one by one. He asked
me, ‘What's coming up about this union? What does the union
want? I want to know if you’re in on it. \/Vould you rather
lose your job than stay and get more money?’. I said, ‘I'm a
union man. I won't go back on my fellow workers. We all
stick together.’ He said, ‘You want to run my plant? That's’
what it means. I can’t hire or ﬁre whoever I want. You’re
disappointing me. I couldn't use you no more now. You’re
through.’ 

Employers have another way of preventing the workers from
joining together in a trade union. A Negro girl says:

_ “When I was working in the X Laundry the boss kept
encouraging a ﬁght between the foreign and American Ne-
groes. He'd make nasty cracks about one to the other behind
_their backs. I used to give out the work. The Americans would
say, ‘Give it to that old West Indian.’ I said, ‘We must learn
to love each other, not ﬁght all the time.’ There's so many

57

Slemre () perutm‘

 

grievances that holds our race apart from each other and
from other people. They've been tricked by whites so long.
Their suspicions must be wiped out. Even the newspapers
only give themvone side of the story and don’t try to help them.-
But things are changing. Now in churches and clubs they
teach Negroes to be union conscious. T hey’re more ready to
organize today than they were six months ago.”

“But Things Are Changing”

Not only the Negroes but all laundry workers are more ready
to organize today than they were a short while ago. The unbear—
able working conditions, the low wages, the rise in the cost of
living, are driving them to organize. And their union is now
giving them strong leadership.

To stimulate this, there is a general feeling for organization
throughout the country. Every day brings news of the success of
some workers in their efforts toward collective bargaining. This
gives the laundry workers hope. It gives them the courage to do
what they did not dare do in the past. It makes them feel that it is
no longer considered a disgrace to go on strike for decent con-
ditions, and that the public is behind them. Letters like the fol-
lowing are daily coming into the office of Local 280 of the Laundry
Workers’ Union:

“Gentlemen:

_ “I have read in the newspapers of your splendid work for
your fellow workers in an effort to stamp out slavery.

“Please help my two poor sons who work as free slaves at
the X Laundry. One son is a marker earning $12 a week. One
son is a sorter earning $1ova week. These poor boys have to be
at work 7 A.M. and work Monday and Friday till 5 P.M. The
other days till 9 P.M.

“I am a widow with ﬁve small children and these boys are
my only support. They want me to write to you because they’re
too tired, and they know you're their only hope.

“Please come and make a union there, so slavery may be
wiped out. i

“Thanking you for all your trouble,
“A Mother of Two Slaves for Laundry Bosses."

      v

 

. This is the. sentiment of an unknown worker, and of practically
all the workers—“They know you are their only hope.”

WHAT DO THE EMPLOYERS OFFER?

We have, shown how strenuously the employers oppose the
union and collective bargaining. What remedies, then, can they
offer the workers? One of the leading members of a laundry
owners’ association, who operates a successful laundry of 500 em-
ployees, has three remedies:

 

.1. A minimum wage law.

“A minimum wage law is the only way the workers can
protect themselves against chiselling employers. I was very
active in sponsoring the last one. But the last one wasn’t
sufficiently enforced. Inspectors are too soft-hearted. Some-
times small employers give them a sob story about having
wives and children and no money, and they even break down
and cry. So the inspectors let them get away with violations.
1 can show you laundry after laundry that never paid the
minimum wage. They all say they are for it, but unfortunately
they won’t pay it.

“Yes, a minimum wage law can be enforced, if honest
people are in charge of enforcing it. The reputable employers
in the industry should have something to do with policing it.
It would be to their advantage to enforce it,”

~ 2. The consumer should be educated to pay higher prices.

“It's very important that the public should be educated to

_ pay a little more for good laundering. Then employers could
i _ pay decent wages. But consumers don’t bother to go into their
laundries-to see how their work is done. They don’t know,

whether it’s good or bad. They just know how it looks. But

good laundering is more than appearance; it’s how long your.

g things last. The little chiselling employers keep slashing
E‘ prices because they say the public won’t pay more. But this is
not true. Anyone who can afford to send out laundry. can

afford to pay 15 cents more a week.That much more per cus-

tomer means the difference between decent wages for the

workers and wages on which they can barely pay their rent.”

3. Machinery and supply companies should sell on a cash basis,
59

 

and the Water Department should turn off the water if payment

is overdue.

“The machinery and supply companies should not be al-
lowed to sell on time payment. They should collect when the
goods are delivered. That would keep out people who haven’t
the money to run their business right. No, there's no way to
make them do this but it would be good business for them
if they did. And the Water Department should enforce its
regulation that if payment is overdue the water will be turned
off. See, here are the ﬁgures of a laundry that just went bank-
rupt. It owed $1,600 for water, and $3,400 for supplies. That’s
what happens all the time.”

And what about the union as a means of helping the laundry
workers? .

“I don’t know enough about unions to make any state-
ments. I only know what I read in the newspapers. I look at
the automobile strike—a minority that prevented a majority
from working. And what did they get out of it? They didn't
get a raise in pay, or fewer hours. They'll have to work ﬁve
years to make up what they lost during the strike} I feel the
workers derive little beneﬁt from these organizations.”

The employer of 500 workers directs his attack on the small

laundry owner. A small laundry owner, who was one of the ﬁrst
to cut wages when the first minimum wage law was repealed,

answers:

“It isn’t our fault. The public simply won't pay higher
prices. What we need is a State law that regulates prices. A
minimum wage law is not enough. The laundry workers won’t
get better conditions until we get better prices.”

And what does he think of the union?

“Laundry workers never earned big money. With the cost
of living rising, the workers have to have a way of earning
more. That’s where the union comes in. But in our industry

1 The General Motors strike, which he refers to, resulted in these gains
for the workers: a 5 per cent increase in wages, a 40-hour week and time and
a half for overtime, seniority rights (security on the job), slowing up of the
speedup system, and collective bargaining for union members.—United Auto-

mobile Workers Union.

iwe can't exist with a union. It's been proved that where the
union comes in there is always a rise in the cost of production.
And the union mu-st justify its existence by showing the work-
ers that it does something for them. So almost every year it
tries to get them more money. But the public won't pay the
higher prices needed to pay for union labor.”

The small laundry owner blames the public and looks to the
State to solve the problem. Both the small and large employer
take it out on labor. This is proved by the fact that they op—
pose collective bargaining which undeniably improves conditions
for the workers. They do not cut down on their rent and other
overhead to ease their ﬁnancial diﬂiculties. They imply that they
must either raise prices to the public or take it out on the

workers. But since they are dependent on the public, they take

it out on the workers.

For these reasons the League of Women Shoppers believes
that the conditions of the laundry workers will not be cured
by the employers or through their suggestions. The remedies they
suggest may ease the situation but they cannot cure it.

WHAT DOES THE UNION OFFER?

Let us see if the union has any solution that can be of per-
manent help to the laundry workers. One of the officials of the
Laundry Workers’ Union, Local 280, gives his opinion:

“The union is the only thing that can save the laundry
workers from sweatshop conditions. It is up to the union to de-

mand decent wages. If employers claim they can't pay a living‘

wage they don't deserve to stay in business. These employers
are parasites on the industry. They cut prices and wages because
they have their backs to the wall, not because the public de-
mands it. They are commercial pirates who undermine the
standards of all the workers in the industry. Of course, success-
ful employers try to keep out the union just as much as the
other ones—-they want to make as much proﬁt as possible. But
they can afford to pay union wages and they can be made to do it.

“The workers must have collective bargaining. What good will
it do them if consumers pay higher prices? There is no guarantee

61

 

that an employer will raise wages just because he raises prices. But
if consumers patronize union shops they can be sure that the
workers are getting a reasonably fair return for their work. And
there is no reason why consumers must pay higher prices to pay
for union labor. If the chiselling employers are out of busi-
ness, those that remain can take advantage of their increased busi-
ness and modern equipment to produce the same work cheaper.
So the union will not only get decent wages for the workers but
it will open the way to lower prices for the consumer. .

“The workers need a minimum wage law, but 31 cents an
hour was a disgraceful wage. The union demands a minimum of
35 cents an hour. The wage established through collective bar-
gaining is based on the needs of the workers and the ability of
the employer to pay. A board set up to determine a fair minimum
wage should base its decision on the union wage, and should re-
quire that the wage be checked every so often to see if it is still
sufficient. The old law called for time and a half for overtime
after 45 hours. The new law should provide that time and a half
should be paid after 40 hours ofwork. Forty-ﬁve hours is too long
for a woman to work without getting added pay for it. And a
minimum wage law should include men as well as women. Of
course it needs collective bargaining to enforce it.

“The union is the only hope for the workers. It can make this
sweatshop industry into one in which a decent American will not
be ashamed to work.”

THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN SHOPPERS CONCLUDES.

The union oﬁers the most complete solution for the laundry
workers, as you can see by reading this pamphlet. VVe ﬁnd that
the State and Federal governments cannot completely cure the
bad conditions because laws, although necessary, do not cover all
the abuses in the industry, and can be evaded or repealed. The
public cannot cure the situation by paying higher prices, because
the increase does not necessarily go to the workers. The employers
cannot offer a cure because their interests are usually opposed to
those of the laundry workers. It remains for the laundry workers

themselves to wipe out their intolerable conditions by joining
together in a trade union for collective bargaining.

This applies not only to the laundry industry, but to all sweat-
shop industries. In whatever industry the union has become
powerful, wages have been raised and conditions improved. A
good example of this is the garment industry which, until it-be-
came unionized, was in as bad condition as the laundry industry
IS now.

CONSUMERS MUST ACT

These bad conditions aﬁect you!’

You pay for them in your personal laundry. Sweatshop condi-
tions mean inferior work; low prices mean inferior chemicals-
your things wear out quickly. You risk your health and that of
your children because the laundry workers cannot take care of
themselves. ‘

You pay for them because they lower your standard of living.
When large masses of workers have so little money, they cannot
afford to buy the things that other people make and sell. This
affects other industries and lowers the standard of living of the
entire community, including your own.

You pay for them in taxes, in relief, in clinics, in the effort
and money spent in wiping out crime, delinquency, and prostitu-
tion, which effort and money could be turned to other uses; in the
terriﬁc human waste of lives which could do productive work but
are cut off 15 years too soon because of overwork and miserable
living conditions.

Will you stand for these things? Will you pay when it is the
employers, not you, who are responsible? Then help get the laun-
dry workers better conditions. Help raise their wages, give them
security on the job. Help them to lead decent, healthful lives. You

' yourselves will beneﬁt.

1. SUPPORT LEGISLATION FAVORABLE TO THE WORKERS

Read your newspapers carefully. Look for bills that are con-

stantly being introduced by social-minded legislators in the State

63

 

and Federal governments. Read more than one newspaper because
each puts a different emphasis on the same subject. Judge these

bills yourselves. The facts presented in this pamphlet should help _

you in evaluating legislation.

Writ.e to your representatives in Congress and the State Legis-
lature. Let them know why you are for or against the proposed
legislation. Do not think of them as far away people. You elected
them. They are there to carry out your wishes, not their own. If

they do not do so, let them know that you will not vote for them ’

when they come up for re—election. Vote for representatives whom
you know will help the workers improve their conditions.
Demand individually, and through your organizations, that
the city and State enforce labor laws which have been enacted but
are not properly enforced. Remember that your job is not through
when you have helped enact a law. You must see that it is enforced.

2. SUPPORT THE LAUNDRY WORKERS IN THEIR EFFORTS
TOWARD COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

Patronize only laundries which have union contracts or em-
ploy union members. Call the oﬂice of the League of Women
Shoppers, Caledonia 5-9395, for a list of union laundries in your
neighborhood. Do not patronize a laundry which is on strike
without hearing the grievances from the strikers themselves. Go
into your laundiy. Find out what the conditions are.

When the anti-union employer sees that the public resents his
attitude, he will be quick to change. Just as the laundry workers
have so long been at the mercy of unfair employers, so can unfair
employers be placed at the mercy of an aroused public opinion.

Introduction

FEW or THE MILLIONS of men and women in the United States
are aware of the working conditions in the laundries to which

they send their wash. Conditions in the laundry industry are

among the worst of any industry. Consumers, once they are
acquainted with the facts, are in a position to help remedy many
of the faults. With this in mind, a survey was made by the League
of Women Shoppers, an organization of consumers whose pur-
pose is to provide its members with impartial and authentic in-
formation about labor conditions in factories and stores so that
the public can use their buying power for justice.

From March, 1936, to March, 1937, twenty League investi-
gators went to the homes of laundry workers at night. They
secured addresses from employers, from the union, from tene-
ment and apartment houses where laundry workers were reported
to be living, from workers already visited, and from laundry
workers on the street during lunch hour. Employers were also
interviewed. The investigators ﬁlled out lengthy questionnaires
on working conditions and standards of living and, in addition,
took complete notes in the exact words of the workers. Laundries
of all sizes and types were visited, with the exception of Chinese
laundries where there are few employees, because the owner and
his relatives generally handle most of the work.

Since more workers are employed in steam laundries, 32 steam
laundries and 12 hand laundries were covered in this survey. One
hundred and two laundry workers were interviewed. There was
a proportionate number of ‘men and women, Negroes and whites;
more non-union than union members were interviewed.

The League used additional information on the laundry in-
dustry previously gathered by the Federal and State government
agencies and other organizations. Although the survey was con-
ducted only in New York City area, other sources of information

5

 

tend to prove that the same conditions exist in the industry
throughout the United States, except in the South where the
situation is even worse} L

This pamphlet tells the story as the workers themselves told
it to the investigators. The ﬁndings of those investigators and the
opinion of the League of Women Shoppers point out that only
by collective‘ bargaining and legislation, with the help of in-

formed consumers, can laundry workers achieve decent working

The Steam Laundry Industry

GROVVTH AND DEVELOPMENT

DID YOU KNOW that the ﬁrst washing machine, patented in

England in 1691, could be used for’ all these things: “the
raising of water, washing of cloathes, milling of sugar canes,
pounding of charcoale to make powder of, and pounding of
raggs ﬁt to make paper, and the like, which said engine was never
used in England bef0re.”1

I In America, the gold rush of 1849 was responsible for estab-
lishing the ﬁrst power laundry. Thousands of men without fami-
lies rushed to California, but they went there to dig gold, not to
wash clothes, and something had to be provided to take the place
of the women who had always done the laundry. So a carpenter
built a 12-shirt washing machine, which was run by a io-horse-
power donkey engine.

From that small beginning, the power laundry industry has
grown until in New York City area alone, there are 418 power

laundries, employing about 15,000 women and minors. There

are 2,500 more working in hand laundries? It is difficult to get
an exact estimate of all laundry workers employed in New York
City area. The New York Labor Department says that there are

approximately 25,000, but the Laundry Workers’ Union says that

there are at least 50,000.

deals directly with the family, calling for and returning its wash,
is called the Family Laundry. This is the backbone of ‘the indus-
try. The Wholesale Laundry does work for the small hand laun-
