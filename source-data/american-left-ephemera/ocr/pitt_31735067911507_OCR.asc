'“ DENVER——A nationwide Mine-Mill strike
vote was set for J.ul;§16 and 17 by our union’s
National Wage Policy‘ Committee as it ende
a two-day meeting here. .. ’

h After hearing reports showing a “Let’s get
moving!” _spii-"it developing all over the -union,

A  the delegates agreed that a united national
. drive is the only way to wrest a wage increase

’this year despite tough employer resistance.
“We have been in negotiations with‘ the
operators in this industry for nearly two
months,”.- the 1nt’l Executive Board declared
as it met immediately following "adjournment
of the, Wage Policy Committee, “and stillhave
' received no offer of ii wage increase whatev-

._,er. Some of the operators have even dared

to demand wage cuts, a proposal which we

refuse to even consider fdr one second.”

' . The Wage Policy Committee agreed to in-

form all employers that “any’ unilateral action
I taken by the industry against any local union
.. or unions will be deemed, an act of hostility

and ‘aggression against the entire union.” And

 the‘ Committee empowered the Executive ’
’ Board ‘_‘to direct whatever action is deemed

_appropriate against the industry jn order .to
-protect -the interests of the\ membership on

 ggihd after the expiration date of thepresent

agreements!’ , ‘ ,
,-- “.The American Mining Association seems

- ”to have decided to exploit the present tempo-

rary decline in_ lead and zinc prices to impose

‘a wage-cutting patterii on the entire indus-
try,” ‘the Board said: , i
‘ “With copper selling at 30 cents a pound, '_

nine-tenths. of the industry is enjoying a boom 
even greater than the lush period after the 3

‘Korean war started. -.And the big operators in

lead and zinc can readily afford a wage in- ’

crease’ as well.” 5 g .

“A glance at settlements reached in recent
weeks in other‘ basic industries shows that
substantial wage increases are the rule this

year,” the Board pointed out. “Our. members, i '

who also work in a basic industry, do not in-.
tend to be any exception to this rule.”

' “With only seven days to go before our
contract deadline in Kennecott, Anaconda and
American Smelting & Refining, the employers
are engaged in their usualstalling tactics,.’.’,
the Board went on. “Our membership sees no
reason why they should wa.it patiently all
summer before the (operators get around to" a
settlement. So we have set the strike vote.

'date_ at the earliest’ moment possible, taking

into account thepresent status‘ of negotiations

. in the various sections of-the industry.” .
.As part of the overall plan to step up the .

tempo and intensity 'of our Union’_s bargain-
ingl drive, the delegates adopted a program
pf political and community action to pressthe
fight for ‘jobs, especially in the depressed lead
and zinc industry. ‘(Text of the resolution on

political and community action‘ is on Page 8).’-

“The fight for jobs,” they ‘said, “is a strug-

“dra.matizes the critical need for a reversalof ‘  3

present world trade policies,” they said._“O,ne

, The Committee recommended that before];
' Congress adjourns, a committee of local union 

representa__tives from the “basic sections of ‘our;

Union goto Washington to lobby on *the~*pro_-

‘one held several ‘weeks ago in Wallace, Idah6;'

“to point up,the ‘need for jobs and gov_eri‘1_- _

A ‘By Silvain Schnail-facher

»- _, International:.Representantive‘

.'—. QUESTION: My boss tells me that the
9' contract m-iningprices are none of_ my

business as a union leader. .He says
.‘ ,;_that as long as the company here pays
,'  «the :day’s pay for miners that’s in the
“ ‘ V agreement ‘as a guaranteed rate,‘ that’s‘
" all it has to do. It he telling the truth?

  

i»_*_'ANSWER:. Yourcboss is wrong. The.
miners set up the Union to protect
'_their wages, hours and ~.working,condi-
tions. The only way, to do that is to
" negotiate them, win the best set-up
 '.they can, and enforce it. Most "Of the
—_ -"time, the contract miners earnings and
working conditions depend directly on
the contract. prices, and the day’s pay
7 r rate doesn’t «mean ‘a thing to him. So

  

= "say about the contract price, then for

 _; .f_all "practical purposes, that miner is

‘1_/‘jus,t:_where he would“ be if he dfdn’t
 fhave"a Union at all.

This position we take on the‘rig71_t

 ‘to negotiate prices and every other

. condition of contract mining isn’t just

  

"V ,_.~right._ It is a legal right, tool It is_
‘'.;'—-recognized. by countless court and
f ‘,-NLRB‘ decisions interpreting the_ old
 -Wagner Act. Even when the Taft-
 Hartley Law came in, there was no
-vichange in thispart of the ' law. The
 .~,-bosses know that they a-re’req’u‘ired by
’ ‘- _‘'—/,law to bargain on every part of the
 ,c_ontract mining system. '

are taking care of themselves.

Data recently made available on sal-

    
   

top executives show that they have
done very well by themselves.

So far as we "can tell, there hasnot
been any talk of cutting salaries on
top in order to economize. _

‘ANSONIA, Conn.—In the strongest demonstration of confidence

 In their union since the days of'the .1947 secession movement, rank
and file workers at American Brass Company plants here and- in _
.Torrington rose up to smash a combined raid by the CIO and AFL,‘

and voted overwhelmingly to keep Mine-Mill as their bargaining agent.
‘ NLRB elections held simultaneously June 18 at the two Anaconda-

’ owned ABC plants located 50 miles apart at each end of Connecticut's
“brass val1ey” resulted in such sweeping defeat for the raiding CIO A

United Auto Workers and AFL Federal Labor Union that it willbe

‘a long time, if ever, before any raiding union shows up at the gates of

either of these two plants again. .
The vote at the Ansonia ABC plant, where Ansonia Brass

-wins for M-M m  

Workers Local 445 has held bargaining rights since 1938, was:

Mine-Mill - 1.048
A UAW-CIO - 502
AFL . ’ ‘ 105
None - ‘I6

Total eligible to vote in Ansonia was

by over 4% to 1, and the AFL by about

headquarters at one'time or another

as shifts changed, andworkers came
off the job or left‘:their homes to par-“

ticipate in the ‘celebrations.
Celebrating was still going on Sat-

urday,’ twoldays after the “big day”.
THE “VICTORY, of course, "was a

reaffirmationl of support for the rank-

~and-file program and policies of the

Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. It
was an emphatic rejection of the split-

ting,-red—baiting program of UAW, be-
cause that’s all the flood’ of UAW

teetering on the brink _of war. There-
fore’ we greet -enthusiastically the
growing signs that point to the fa-

\ vorable impact on international affairs

of the desire and‘ struggle of the com-
mon people-of all lands for peace.

It is ofyparticular satisfaction to note

, a growing number of important unions

taking” positions which correspond to

‘ the great need for peace and the .,

peaceful solution of world ‘problems.

Wprld trade '

_ It will become increasingly clear to

’ '\'\'orkers, and this/is bound to. find‘

reflection in official union actions, that
only under a trade policy that is based
‘on trading with all countries prepared
to trade with us, can there be an in-
definite period oﬁ employment expan-
sion in"“’our countryp It will also be

clear that such adesirable and neces-

sary condition will only ‘unfold wvith
the realization of conditions of true
peace. - ~
_Jobs "in peacetime
The employers and their hangers-on
in‘ govei~nment*would have us believe‘
that job opportunities are bound to
shrinkin a peacetime economy. In ef-
~ fect they say “build for war and hold
jobs or decide on peace and be un-
em ploye'd.” ' '

The {solution iof ‘the working’ class’  
lies in the opposite dii'ectioii,—to fight

for wage increases, lowered; taxes and
.proper trade policies under conditions
of peace. This is the only”way that
depression can be headed off. 1 V

economics of scarcity . . . scarcity for

Most of the former employees are

which William Gillis is chairnian, to
have'them placed in other operations.

These two, supported by contribu-

“hearty agreement with the program

The membership, which works in

eastern Idaho, heard a report on the
conference by Bill Barger, Bob Hogan
and Int’l rep. Ernie Salvas.
Wholehearted support of the entire
membership, was expressed for forcing

A-the company to recognize the union’s
right to, bargain."collectiv_ely for the-

contract miners and negotiate prices
and contract workiiig conditions.

Local 622 contract miners said they
are highly in favor of afprogram which
would prevent the company from ad-
justing contract miners’ earnings to the
size‘ of the ,1-ustling line. They felt con-
tract, earnings ',should"“ reflect

.’30’s, the labor movement _was neither strong
enough nor big enough to assume the leader-
ship of the unemployed and to carry on the-

struggle for jobs and relief. Today, that task _

_belongs to the trade unions, and Mine-Mill

 fully intends to discharge‘ its dutyin this in-

. dustry. '-

Since our Mining,_ Smelting and Refining ' '
..Conference and National Wage Policy Com-

mittee meeting in the spring, our union has
.-instituted and carried out many phases of
the. comprehensive program the delegates to
those meetings adopted. . I --

We have carried on a campaign to get-the
Murray Premium Price bill passed,"‘in Con-
gress. We have mobilized our local unions and
entire communities. We have testified bef0.re
Congressional committees about the crisiskand
'how it affects our members._ We met with
_g'overnors, Democratic party leaders, Republi-
can leaders, state legislators, county supervis-
ors,.and county, state and, federal‘ agencies.

It has become apparent, however, that we
.must pay even “greater attention to the basic

elements of the program projected by, our -
- -48th Convent_ion——the expansion of both do-
gmesticfand world markets for the metals we
; produce. Without such expansion, the crisis

World trade

IN the field of world trade, even corporation
‘executives like Clinton H. Cra.ne are beginning
to echo the’ thinking of Mine-Mill. Cra.ne is

' chairman of the boardof the St. Joseph Lead

Company. Recently he told his stockholders:
“This disruption of normal trade makes bus-

iness conditions on the continent of Europe

most difficult. The manu'factur.ing side has
been separated from the agricultural side, and
the cold war has placed embargoes on the
normal shipments of machinery from-West to
East. Should peace come, or even a truce,
which would make the removal of embargoes
possible, a boom would come such as business
has not seen in many years.”

And it should be noted, too, that other labor
officials are beginning to come out strongly

E for broader world trade. Witness Walter Reu-

t_hers recent pronouncements on trade“ as a
means of .producing jobs. ' _

When even the New York Times financial
writers say that “lasting peace has been an
economic need for a long time,” Mine-mill can
take heart that what formerly seemed an iso-
lated, private opinion is now being openly ad-
vocated in newspaper editorials, radio ‘broad-
casts, and in statements by conservative la-
bor officials, corporation executives, and pub-
lic officials. «

There will be a truce in Korea. Its im-
minence dramatizes the critical need for a re-
versal of ‘ present world trade policies. One
simply cannot justify the burial of lucrative
foreign markets when American’ workers are
out of jobs and their families face starvation
andgeviction. , — - S

The factremains there is only one sure
way to increase ‘the’ market for lead, zinc,
copper, iron ore and ___oth_er metals. And that
way is to be able to sell those products. Wide
open world trade will help to prevent job-_

lessnesswin America. It will mean peacetime T

prosperity. ‘
Action program .

ICVERY recent event, therefore, indicates
the need for the kind of action program we _are
recommending here. That program is as fol-

lows : ’

 _, To enlist the support of and to instittltle
united action with’;othe'r labor unions, bus-

-iness groups, church and civic organizations,-

and entire. communities around. a ‘common-
program designed to create jobs in the in.-
dustry and thecommunity, and to protect

the unemployed workers 'in the_ areas with

adequate compensationand public relief.

2,, Such organized political acltivitymust be
directedat municipal, county, state, and fed-

.-eral office-]iold‘é1's and agencies, ingluding

state legislatf,i)1"s,:c'it_v councils, mayors, govern-
ors, county supervisors, congressmen and sen-_
ators, employment Security -departments, pub-

lic welfare d-{~;Dai'tnients,,,state highway _com- I

missions, forestry and conservation services,
and others.- Both Democratic and Republican
party leaders must be impressed-with the need
for action and-' with the politicaI_strengtl1‘ our
union exerts in many, many areas‘.

3 Our locafl unions must be geared for in-
creased political work‘of this nature by the
establishment of ‘special’ committees on po-
litical action and unemployment. The interna-
tional union should increase its concentra-
tion on this problem through special organi-

‘ zational, administrative, ‘and publicity assis- '

tance.

tees on unemployment and these ..—are present-

A key job of the committees on unemploy-
ment will be to maintain the organizational ~ we‘-_;

affairs and guaranteeing theirgood standing
through the payment ofunemployed dues.

 movement that impresses upon federal, '‘state,_-‘

-ma-nding action. The place to fight is i1f"tl1;_

' tives from the basic sections of our union go

to Washington to lobby on the program for
jobs. We urge, also, that we continue our
plans to hold a Washington legislative con-
ference on the lead-zinc crisis.

It is likely that such a conference will
have to be timed to occur some time after the
St. Louis convention in September. Certainly‘
our locals should take advantage of the sum-
mer recess to repeatedly confer with their
congressmen and. senators.

6. We urge the calling of further community
conferences and rallies to point up the need
for jobs and governmental assistance. Out of ,
such con:ferences can come delegations to gov- ,
ernors, congressmen, and other officials, and
demands for public works and special sessions
of the legislatures to enact laws to aid the
unemployed. _ ‘ R I

7. We cannot emphasize too strongly the
need for unified action on the part of all 121- ‘

erything we"do in this campaign for jobs must—’ ‘I
be- designed’ to continually widen support ‘for
our program. -'

 

8 , Surveys to determine which public works
projects can win the broadest public and po-. 
litical support should be undertaken in all of 

our communities.‘ Our experiences show that ;
there ‘is considerable local sentiment for such " 
projects as highways, secondary roads, for-
estry projects, irrigation, river projects,_-coun-
tyhospitals, and similar job-producing works.

success of this or any other people’s program
