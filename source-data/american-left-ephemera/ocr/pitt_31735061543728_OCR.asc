question of methods and tactics. In general, however, Socialists pro-
pose to bring about as rapidly as possible the social ownership of
land, natural resources and the principal means of production, there-
by abolishing the possibility of the existence of any class on an
income derived not from work but from ownership. This does not
necessarily mean that no man will have a home that he can call his
own. His right will rest on use and not on a title deed. The rental
value of land belongs to society and not to the individual. Socialism
would end the monstrous and absurd injustice under which gen-
erations of men and Women can live in luxury without useful labor
of any sort because they were wise enough to pick an ancestor who
in his day had been clever enough to pick. let us say, a farm in New
York City on or near which some six million people now have to
live. This is a criticism not of individuals but of the social system
which heretofore we have collectively tolerated. Socialists unlike
single taxers object not merely to economic dynasties founded on
ownership of land and natural resources but to similar dynasties
founded on the ownership of stocks and bonds passed from genera-
tion to generation by inheritance. They do not expect to abolish
them with the stroke of the pen or the sword. They do not expect
to abolish them at all without struggle.

But the deadliness of modern war between nations or classes is
so horrible, and the probable effect of it on a highly organized society
so great that it becomes of the highest importance to carry on the
struggle to the utmost possible point by non-violent means. The old
barricade is an inadequate symbol of revolution against a class which
controls airplanes and poison gas. Mere revolt will not save a
society which needs reorganization. In a time of the general ac-
ceptance of the inevitability of or desirability of wholesale violence,
it needs to be pointed out that there are other methods of struggle
than wholesale violence which is increasingly self defeating. Russia
endured her years of revolution precisely because she was nearer the
soil. The sufferings of Moscow and Leningrad would have made
bedlam, not constructive revolution, in New York and Chicago.
We ought to be able to learn from Russia’s planned economy and her

success with other than the supreme proﬁt motive, without slavishly
copying everything in a country greatly different from our own in
background, tradition, material development.

Among other things the Russian experiment, no less than the
experience of Socialist parties in Western Europe which have got
some degree of power, shows clearly that not even the most cataclys-
mic revolution can create overnight those habits of mind and that
social machinery necessary to the successful functioning of a new
social order.

Any revolution peaceful or violent involves reeducation. We do
not seek and cannot achieve the bliss of some static, unchanging
Utopia by one supreme act. Fortunately the Spanish revolution
gives hope that ancient despotisms of King and landlord can be abol-
ished and the new order begun with a minimum of bloody violence
—if only the workers are awake and organized so that they will
not aid their masters to enslave them. This is not to say that the
struggle can always be bound by legalism or that Socialists are
non-resistants who would never use force to win or still better to
protect what they have won. We want to minimize violence and
throw the onus of it, if it comes, where it belongs: on an_ owning
class that will not give up while it can hypnotise anyone to ﬁght
in its behalf. , ,

Our principal means by which we expect to make progress in-
clude the organization of labor industrially through labor unions,
of the power of consumers through consumers’ cooperatives, and of
citizens through a labor party. The reliance of Socialism is upon
the working class, not because of the peculiar virtues possessed by
the working class but because it is peculiarly in its interest to end
exploitation and waste. The class struggle may not be as simple or
clear-cut as some Socialist agitators have supposed. It is, neverthe-
less, a fact of history, and a fact plain to be seen in our present
line up on questions of unemployment relief, justice to workers
and the methods of our strikes. But it is also a fact of history that
very valuable sympathy and leadership have been given to the ex-
ploited classes down through the ages by men of more favored

groups to Whom justice and the ultimate good of society are dearer
than any immediate class interest of their own. The hope of peaceful
and intelligent progress depends in no small degree upon increasing
thenumber of these men and women who thus transcend class lines.

WANTED: A WORKERS’ PARTY

HEN, THEREFORE, Socialists in the United States as in Eng-

». R land speak of a labor party they do not conﬁne its member-

ship to industrial or agricultural workers. They Welcome all those
Who will honestly strive for Socialist ideals.

Even conservatives who still have some faith in democratic politi-
cal processes should, I think, welcome a party with ideas and a
program. Our present two-party system lives on the strength of
organization rather than of principle. Both parties belong to the
same general set of masters who pay their bills. It is their business
to obscure issues and to amuse and distract the people. It would ap-
pear that we select presidents as we select jurors, on the ground
that they have no opinions that can be discovered. The senior
Senator from New York was once the Republican Mayor of Ann
Arbor, Michigan. He is now the Democratic Senator from New
York and all he ever changed was his address. This is characteristic

of the two’ old parties which ﬁght only for office. Observe how ut-_

terly both parties in this respect lack program and new leadership.

SOME IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES

HAT WE NEED, what the Socialist Party seeks to supply, 18
Worganized, disciplined, intelligent action in cities, states and
nation through a party based consciously on the interests of the
great producing masses.

This leaﬂet is not a Socialist platform of immediate proposals.
But one reason Why I am a Socialist is that excellent proposals do
exist. All proposals for alleviating unemployment and protecting
old age, and for other social legislation had their origin or impetus
from socialism. If the Socialist unemployment proposals of 192.8

12

i
l
E
I

 

 

had been adopted‘ then how much suffering would have been re-
lieved! If after the depression came our supplementary demand for
direct federal aid and for an immense housing program directed
against slums and shacks had been adopted, we should not face
now the probability that men must steal, starve or fight.

If the Socialist view of the World War had prevailed, or if a
Socialist peace had been made, how much better off America would
have been! No valuable immediate program of international rela-
tions can fail to heed the socialist demands for disarmament, can-
cellation of War debts and reparations provided the money is not
used for armament, for recognition of Russia, reduction of tariffs,
a sound ﬁscal system and for the allocation of raw materials.

N 0 sound system of taxation can ignore the Socialist contention
that beside the land taxation I have discussed, income and inherit-
ance taxation is not only the just, practical and equitable form of
taxation but of itself an aid in the redistribution of Wealth and the

'socialization of industry which Socialism seeks.

For one part of the Socialist program I must take a little more of
my limited space. Socialism will earnestly and vigorously seek to
put in operation a progressive system for the acquisition and demo-
cratic or functional control of natural monopolies and basic indus-
tries, including banking. The principle to be followed here is that
which J. A. Hobson has ably expounded: namely, that we should
proceed to take over those economic processes in which already the
engineer is more important than the entrepreneur. These are many
and basic. The real social revolution, as Veblen pointed out, will
come when engineers and administrators Work for society as they
now work for absentee owners. The method of acquisition pre-
ferable in a peaceful society is compensation in bonds amortized
out of earnings of industry, the income of which must be subject
to heavy income taxation. All industry should, of course, be subject
to the general guidance of an economic planning board.

At this point I can almost hear the usual shouts of protest,
“What, do you Want a lot of politicians to run our industries?
How about graft and inefliciency in government service?” Etc.,

13

 
 

 

 

 

 

etc. I have not space to answer these questions in detail but to
answer them in principle is relatively easy. No modern Socialist of
any stripe wants bureaucratic political government of industries
through a set of post master generals or their equivalent. We propose
to have public ownership with title vested in the nation, state or
municipality, but control under a public authority representing so
far as may be possible the genuine and permanent interests not of
proﬁt seeking private owners but of producers in the particular in-
dustry and consumers of its products or services. There will have to

be a considerable variety in structure to meet the needs of coal

mines, railroads, etc. In every case we shall try to put a premium on
eﬂiciency through the intelligent application of the merit system.
We shall temper bureaucracy, moreover, by a recognition of the
union and a direct sanctioning of collective bargaining. And, of
course, we recognize that with socialized industries will or should
go along a development of consumers’ cooperation in the distribution
of goods and in other lines like housing.

Even now the case for the honesty and eﬂiciency of private as
against government business is grossly overstated. Indeed the chief
source of graft in government arises from the efforts of private
business to get special privileges and perpetual right to What belongs
to the people. It was the oil industry which sought to corrupt the
government, not the government the oil industry. Again in private
industry there is an immense deal of nepotism, favoritism and graft
which is accepted as a matter of course, though it is challenged in
the public service. Sinclair and his fellow ‘buccaneers robbed their
own stockholders of 25 cents a barrel in the Continental Trading
Company. It was not the directors or the stockholders who dis-
covered the fact or protested effectively and compelled restitution.
It was the much abused government.

Eulogists of private business and critics of the government deal
more in assertion than proof and they are not always careful as to
the honesty of their statements. Witness the dishonest attacks on
the very successful Ontario hydro electric development and. the
Canadian National Railroad. Witness, too, the substantial achieve-

H

 

 

ments of the Bureau of Standards in Washington in the service of

\ the government and the people and the success of governmental

building of the Panama Canal when private enterprise failed. There
is no panacea against dishonesty but a stock gambling world of
business cannot afford to ‘talk as loosely as it does about graft. In-
deed many of the men who most deplore the inefficiency of our
government rejoice in that very ineﬂiciency as an excuse for their
opposition to this immediate program of gradual socialization which
I have urged. But every day’s news of the breakdown of private
ownership in bituminous coal’ ﬁelds and the immense fraud worked
upon the public by the propaganda of the associated power interests
is an argument for the Socialist remedy.

A PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE

UCH ARE SOME of the immediate issues. But beyond any im-
mediate program lies the necessity of a philosophy of life. We
need to oppose the shabby capitalist religion of Babbitt and the
Rotary Clubs with a higher religion of intelligent cooperation in
the use of the world’s wealth for the abolition of poverty and war
and the realization of freedom and brotherhood.

Socialism is more.than the sum total of specific changes however
sweeping they are. It is a way of life and loyalty. It lives by its
vision of what lies beyond today’s achievement. Outof this loyalty
and vision newihonesties and abilities will emerge and new leaders
as in other great periods of hope, will arise.

The task before us outruns the life of one generation or the
functions of any political party. The party or the movement which

' undertakes it will often falter and fail. Socialism as an organized

movement here and abroad is a movement of men, not supermen.
It has its disappointments and failures, but nowhere except in the
Socialist movement do I ﬁnd any heartening answer "to that great
challenge of our day and generation: how shall we, men of all na-
tions and races, forced by the development of our machine civiliza-
tion into dependence upon one another, work our destiny in terms
of world-wide fellowship instead of exploitation and strife.

WHY I AM A SOCIALIST

By NORMAN THOMAS

AM A SOCIALIST because I believe that in our dark and troubled
I world, which blessed with the machinery to abolish poverty,
lives in the shadow of unemployment and economic insecurity and
the deeper shadow of ever threatening war, socialism—international
socialism—-—is our only hope of averting catastrophe and establishing
plenty, peace, and freedom.

In the earlier editions of this leaﬂet which was originally a re-
print of an article written by request for the Princeton Alumni
W eekly, I did not begin on so urgent a note. Instead I began with

' some more or less facetious reference to the lack of anything in my

birthplace, or my years at Princeton, to explain my socialism. But
in the intervening years the Indian summer of capitalism, the largely
illusory and wholly unsound prosperity of Wall Street’s gambling
orgy, has come to a bitter end. There is a general consciousness that
though we may blunder out of the depths of this depression we are
living in the end of an epoch. Not merely the economics of capitalism
but the psychology native to an acquisitive society, shows signs of the
decadence of the times. Our standards are shaken, our hope is turned
to profound pessimism, our whole order is sick with racketeering
which is not conﬁned to the illegal crimes of the underworld, but is
natural to a society Whose favorite text has been, “My son, get riches
—-honestly if possible.” And now that riches disappear, and we are
told that men starve because they have produced too much, the state
of our leadership, economic and political, shows how deep seated is
the paralysis of our national will. Drift in America, the newspaper
headlines fairly shout, is drift to disaster not to true prosperity, to
War not peace, to dictatorship not democracy.

The philosophy of muddling through, the consolation that we
shall survive this crisis since we have survived others only to stumble
into another some seven or eight years hence, is no comfort at all.

3

 

 

 

 

It ignores the increasing seriousness of crisis in our complex society
and the increasing danger that the same machinery which makes
possible, more abundant life, will make possible Wholesale death.

The wise man is tempted to one of two philosophies, either the
philosophy of Spengler that this process of decay of civilizations is
inevitable and the crisis of western civilization beyond hope of solu-
tion by our effort, or the philosophy of Lenin which is the philosophy
of salvation under the dictatorship of a working class party, out of
the inevitable catastrophe to which capitalism hurls us. Both phil-
osophies have truth; neither has the whole, the inevitable truth for
America. We near the end of an epoch but we may better emerge
into the new cooperative society in our western world by doing all
that is in us to avoid and minimize catastrophe, to improve democ-
racy rather than to embrace dictatorship. The drift to disaster has
not yet brought us to inevitable cataclysm. There is still time. I am
a Socialist and not a Communist.

POVERTY IS INEXCUSABLE

ET Us BEGIN by trying to diagnose brieﬂy the historical pro-
cesses, in particular the changes in men's methods of making
a living which have brought us where we are. We shall probably
agree that only today, or yesterday at the earliest, after the long
millenniums of man's life on this planet, has he acquired the technical
skill, the command over the forces of nature, the physical power
to produce enough and more for all his children upon the face of the
earth. From the first dawn of human life poverty has been princi-
pally due to man’s imperfect knowledge of natural forces. For un-
numbered generations he wrestled for a living with a capricious and
often unfriendly Nature, armed only with the power of his own
hands and the muscles of the few animals he had been able to
domesticate, aided by a very imperfect utilization of the weight of
falling water on primitive mill wheels and of the winds of heaven
to sail his boats and turn his mills. That was all. Today it has been
estimated that each of us Americans has the equivalent of the labor
of more than thirty slaves in the energy of steam, electricity and

4

 

 

internal combusion engines. The energy thus available for the work
of men is increasing by leaps and bounds. It is applied to machinery
of marvelous ingenuity. The long age of Markham’s “Man With
the Hoe” is gone forever. It is possible that the pressure of popula-
tion upon food supply may bring about a new age of poverty. That
pressure does not exist today if the world is taken as a unit, and the
decline of the birth rate and the increasing knowledge of scientiﬁc

birth control give some hope that this ultimate danger may be
avoided.

In other words, the old excuse of the classical philosophers for
human slavery no longer exists. The bitter toil of the many is not
the necessary basis for the culture of the few. In the words of Pro-
fessor Simon Patten we have passed from a necessary “pain economy”
to a possible “pleasure economy” as a basis for civilization. ‘Yet even
in the prosperous America of which men boasted when I first wrote
this leaﬂet how far we were from the abolition of poverty! Even
then we did not produce enough to do more than provide a mini-
mum budget of wealth and decency were we to distribute what we
produce by a system more equitable than that under which 1 per
cent of the receivers of income obtain 20 per cent of the national
income; 10 per cent receive 40 per cent of the total income, while
the poorest 25 per cent receive only 3% per cent.

Today with some ten million unemployed and a shrinkage in the
national income measured in tens of billions, the situation is in-
finitely worse. Yet there is almost no limit to what we could pro-
duce; our plant is intact, but farmers are advised to produce a

third less cotton and wheat, and the waste of natural gas and oil
goes on apace.

HOW BAD IS HUMAN NATURE?

on THIS STATE or AFFAIRS there are today only two possible
F explanations. One blames our fate on human nature; the other
upon the inadequacy of human ideals and institutions. The first is
popular because it gives men an excuse for enjoying whatsoever
advantages they may have. It is no longer fashionable to aﬂirm

5

 

i

I

 

 

 

that this is the best of possible worlds. But one may without any
strain on the intellector any demand upon energy or will declare
that it is the best of possible words and go about his own business
or pleasure with a sense of intellectual superiority. Here I have
space only to remark that this dogma of the incapacity of men to
control for social advantage the machinery they have had the wit
to create is as unscientiﬁc and as yet unproved as the optimistic faith
of some early radicals in the “infinite perfectability” of human na-
ture. At the very least we should not adopt it with further examina-
tion into social institutions and ideals. The madness of our civiliza-
tion may arise less from our unalterable biological inheritance than
from the system--political and economic—-—under which we live, a
system which lags dangerously behind the demands of our inter-
dependent society.

, I am aware that to speak of a capitalist or any other system is
to invite the scorn of those who insist that in the changing process
of our economic life there is no rigorous system. There is truth in
the argument. Certainly Ricardo or Adam Smith would not recog-
nize the child of their economic dogmas. Men are still trying to
justify economic practices by an almost religious faith in, let us say,
the “automatic working” of those markets with which they them-
selves spend many of their working hours successfully interfering
by high tariffs, trade agreements, etc. Nevertheless we can describe
the capitalist system as characterized by an emphasis upon private
ownership of property for power and the operation of that owner-
ship for the proﬁt of the owners. This is a system which has played
its part in human history—a part nowhere more sincerely eulogized
than in the famous Communist Manifesto itself. But whatever the
historic necessity for capitalism, it is not today giving men the
bread, the security, the peace, the freedom, the brotherhood which
they have a right to expect. And this was true before the depression
made it tragically obvious.

Mr. Hoover’s estimate of an average annual wage for Amer-
ican workers of $1,280 was not only insuﬂiscient on the average to
maintain the minimum budgets of health and decency which have

\.

6

 

 

been set forth by various authorities, but it implied a tragic amount
of suffering for the large group below this average.

There is no use in repeating that threadbare capitalist boast
that we have more things than ever before and that workers are
better 0H than were ancient kings. The point is that no age has
ever so tragically failed to use the machinery it had for ease and
security of living. Things may have increased but so has insecurity.
The peasant and artisan of old was assured work and an honorable
place in his family and community while he lived. He knew nothing

V of the dead line at forty or forty-ﬁve which gives new terror to old

age. He knew almost nothing of unemployment as a social disease
which in so-called normal times affects some ten per cent of the
workers and is today the lot of twenty-five to thirty—three per cent
of them. '
WHY CRISES COME

HIS UNEMPLOYMENT is inherent in the system. Wealth is

created by the labor of hand and brain of the great mass of
workers. At no time do they collectively get in social income
(schools, roads,» parks, etc.) or personal income the equivalent of
what they produce. That to a large degree is drained off by land-
lords, owners of great aggregations of machinery, manipulators of
credit. To be sure these men and women spend and invest but
wastefully and without comprehensive plan. A surplus which the
workers cannot pay back because of the bad distribution inherent
in the profit system piles up. Every seven or eight years there is a
crisis until slowly, with reduced spending power, the surplus is
absorbed by these who made it. In this crisis machinery stops. We

have the poverty of “overproduction” which may be real enough»

in some lines but in the aggregate is under-consumption. This un-

employment may be alleviated, grudgingly and under pressure, by «

an owning class; it cannot be cured.

It is accentuated especially in times of rapid mechanical prog-
ress‘by improvement in machinery. In the long run under capitalism
these improvements have made more things possible and hence more
jobs and shorter hours. But in the short run they have thrown out

7

 

 

 

 

men with less consideration than a farmer has to give his mule.
And children eat or cry for bread in the short run! What we call
technological unemployment cannot be cured so long as the kindest
of employers must put in machinery only to increase proﬁts in a
competitive society. Ordinarily that means reducing payrolls by
ﬁring men. Only when the rate of introduction of machinery is
controlled by the possibility of reducing hours or proﬁtably absorb-
ing displaced workers in new industry will the curse of technological
unemployment be ended. _

That means planned production and distribution for use, not
proﬁt, which is socialism, not capitalism. It is not even possible
under the capitalist syndicalism or fascism implied in the Swope
plan and other proposals toward which America drifts really to
eliminate poverty and unemployment, much less exploitation and
war. The relentless consolidation of industry and the growth of
capitalist collectivism destroy all the old academic defences of
capitalism in the name of the regulatory power of competition as
effectively as socialism. But, Mr. Swope’s trade assocations, regu-
lated by a government which in turn will be controlled by the more
powerful corporations still keeps a dominance of private property
and private proﬁt, landlordism and speculation and hence maldis-
tribution, recurring crises, and exploitation of the workers. To keep
the workers content, there will still be need to cry up nationalism
against internationalism, making wars more likely.

Indeed, it is unnecessary to do more than point out that the worst
danger of cataclysm in a capitalist society is the danger of war
arising out of imperialism born of the union of capitalism and
nationalism. In an interdependent world there can be no lasting
peace by simply preventing particular wars. The ethics of the
acquisitive society, the madness of jingoism and the frantic struggle
of interdependent nations for an impossible sort of economic self-
suﬂiciency and for ever more markets and power—these are the
natural foundations of a war-ridden society. Merely to realize the
cost of modern war cannot save us except as it inspires us to lay the
basis for true peace in a federation of cooperative commonwealths.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LIBERTY?

UR FINAL COUNT in our indictment of capitalism is that under
0 it men do not enjoy freedom and brotherhood. It is customary
to attack Socialism as the foe of individual liberty. It is quite true
that the problem of the relation of the individual to society will
not be automatically solved by Socialism. But it is not the cham-
pions of the present order who have a right to pose as the defenders
of liberty in a society where property is so much better defended
than life, and where freedom is too generally the possession of the
man who is strong enough to take it for himself. The regimentation
of ideas through a property-controlled press and the economic fear
under which most workers live, whether they Wear overalls or
White collars, makes real freedom an almost non-existent com-
modity. Diogenes might ﬁnd an honest man with a lantern. He
would have to look for a free man with a searchlight in our mod-
ern age. As for brotherhood in other than a sentimental sense,
that is denied by the very nature of a system based on

The good old rule, the ancient plan
That he should talae who has the power,
And he should keep who can.

Kindness there is among us, and charity. Yes, and a capacity for
brotherhood but not the reality of that “fellowship which is life.”
As individuals alone we cannot achieve the brotherhood we seek.
That requires organization and collective action.

These failures of our civilization in spite of its tremendous me-
chanical competence are, I repeat, the natural consequence of the
economic principles and their corresponding ethical ideas on which
We operate. They are inherent in the system and not excrescences
on it.

THE SOCIALIST PROPOSAL
HAT DO THE SOCIALISTS propose to do about this situation?
In Socialism as in every great historic movement there are
divergences of opinion and ideas. There is the sharp division be-
tween Socialists and Communists, principally on the important
