JOIN THE BEG YOUTH PARADE!
Through the streets of Passaic

on National Youth Day

SATURDAY MAY 30,

We will make this Decoration Day, a big day for all young

,5‘; . workers’ and Workers’ children. Thousands of boys and girls, from
 all over the Eastern States, Will come together to Passaic to join in
 L with us in our parade, sports events, demonstration and concert.

WHAT IS MAY 30th?
The rich bosses call it Decoration Day. VVe are supposed to

 mourn those Who lost their lives in the war. The American Legion,

the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the National Guards are paraded

 to show how strong our military forces will be for the next war.

The latest bombing planes fly overhead rehearsing their part for

 this coming war.

I In our schools We are told that the War was fought for democ-

 racy. What is this democracy? Millions of unemployed workers?
 _Starving families? Children who have to beg on the streets for

something to eat? .
The rich, the bosses are not starving. They made plenty of

L I money out o-f the last War and that is Why they are so eager for

another one. They are preparing_for another war. Against Whom
is this war being prepared? Against the only country in the World

2 1 ‘Where the Workers and farmers kicked their_bosses out and rule
ﬁtheir own country, the Soviet Union. The big bosses are afraid

that the Workers of this -country will do likewise.

But for us, for the young Workers and workers’ children,
MAY 30th SHALL BE NATIONAL YOUTH DAY—A day dedicat-
ed to the ﬁght against all bosses’ War. And We shall ﬁght against
these War preparations! We don't want War against the Soviet
Union. We have nothing to gain by such a War. We say the money

‘must be used to feed the unemployed Workers. Make them give us

free lunches in our schools. Make them buy shoes for those of us
who have to go barefoot.
BOYS AND GIRLS!
FIGHT AGAINST BOSSES’ WAR AND FOR FREE
HOT LUNCHES TO ALL CHILDREN WHOSE
PARENTS ARE -OUT OF WORK. ,
