'ShettleTucsonstrike

with I71/2c increase

TUCSON, Ariz.—A 58-day strike against Eagle Picher Mining &
Smelting Co. here has been won with the signing of the first Mine-Mill
contract ever negotiated with the E—P management in this area.

The pact provides, for a 171/2 cent an hour general wage increase,
raising the new common labor rate to $1.35‘/2 an hour, and the top rate for

shaftmen to $1.60.

The contract was signed January 17, and workers returned to the
operation the next day. In addition to the 171/f2 cent wage increase, a

number of other important gains
were made.

A strict seniority system will be
used to fill vacancies or‘on job
preference, promotion, demotion,
layoff” and rehiring. A strong
grievance procedure is provided,
as well as a good safety clause,
with safety committeemen to be
paid for the time spent on making
safety inspections with the com-
pany and State Mine Inspector o
plant-wide tours. “ ~

The contract.also contains a

V non—discrimination clause. In addi-

tion to protecting e In p 1 o y e s
against discrimination because of
union activity, this clause also
provides that: equitable opportun-
ity shall" be afforded to all with
respect to employment and advance-
ment without discrimination because
of ra.ce, creed, color or national
origin.

THE AGREEMENT also provides
for indef-inite leaves of absence to
any em-ployee who might be elected

or appointed’ to any position with‘

either the local or International
Union, such leaves of absence to be
effective for the necessary period for
the employee’s absence in holding the
job. Other leaves are granted for
reasonable and good cause up to a
maximum of 30 days, without loss
of seniority. V .. .

The contract also provides that em-
ployees shall draw the higher wage

 Meetings set to

Preparations for the 1951 bargain-
ing drive were discussed last week by
the International officers, and a.
schedule of council meetings was
projected for February and March.

Two of the bargaining Councils al-
ready have met——Anaconda in De-
cember, and Kennecott January 27.

At the International Executive
Board meeting which will open Febru-
ary 8 at the new Mine-Mill head-

quarters in Denver, plans will be

made for other meetings and coorﬁ-
nation of bargaining.

The officers have planned that
most major bargaining councils will
convene in Denver toward the , end
of March, to be followed by sessions

‘of the Mining, smelting 8; Refining "E"

Council and the National Wage Poli-
cy Committee. Some of the councils
will meet earlier in other places.

Two staff conferences; with divi- H

sion on a geographic basis, will be
held the weeks of March 12 and 19.

tion higher than his regularly assigned
claxification for any part of the day.
Or if he is assigned to work on a
lower paid job, he will draw the
rate of pay for his regular classifica-
tion for the entire day.

Time and one half is to be paid for
all overtime work above eight hours
in any single day. Underground
employees will be paid eight hours
collar to collar. Employees will not
be required to work on Sundays, ex-
cept in such cases as their work may
be absolutely necessary to the main-
tenance of efficient operations. Em-

ployees required to _work on their-

regularly scheduled day off will not
be required to take another day off
within the work week in order to
avoid payment of overtime.

to plan 7951 program

MAGNA, Utah..'}‘-he first 1951
meeting of the MMSW Kennecott
Council was scheduled to get under
way here this past Saturday (Jan.
2'7) to map out this years Wage and

Contract program for the 6,000
workers represented by Council
locals.

Like Mine-Mill’s other company-
wide and industry-wide bargaining
councils, the Kennecott group in-

tended to name its representative to
the national Mining, Smelting and
Refining Conference and move into
position behind a. union-wide bar-
gaining program.

Featuring the Kennecott meeting,
according to advance announcements,
was the annual election of officers,
followed by a full—dress discussion
of the impact of the war situation
on workers’ needs and a wind-up of

' a full d-ay’s discussion to hammer

out bargaining demands.

Workers of the new Kennecott re-
finery at nearby Garfield were in-
vited by the Council to participate
officially in the sessions, even though
the refinery workers have not Yet
had the chance to formally name a
bargaining agent in an NLRB elec-
tion. Interest in the Council is run-
ning high through the refinery, the
result of the ability of Mine-Mill to
bring wage gains and other bene-
fits won by its Kennecott locals to
the refinery workers despite their

lack of formal organization.

The Council meeting was scheduled
to take place in the new headquart-
ers shared here by the MMSW Regi-
onal Staff and the Arthur-Magna

Millmcn’s Local 392. An “open.
house” on the first evening of thg
Council meeting was planned to give
Utah rank-and-filers the opportunity’
to meet socially with brother Kenne-
cott workers from Nevada and New
Mexico.

Organizing

Build union at
Garfield refinery

GARFIELD, Utah — While agents
of the CIO-Steelworkers grind out a
steady stream of “red scare’: propa-
ganda aimed at them, workers at the
new Kennecott refinery here are
Quietly —- but efficiently ——- going
about the real business of building a
union in their new plant.

With announcement of an NLRB
election expected to be coming along
soon, the refinery workers already
have a functioning Shop Steward
system throughout the plant. The
steward program, as well as a rank-
and-file shop bulletin committee and

a wage and contract committee, have‘

been hard at work since their organi-
zation under the auspices of the MM-
SW Refinery Workers Organizing-
Committee.

Numerous grievances have already
been settled on the job as the result
of action by leading Mine-Mill sup-
porter-s. Although no official recog-
nition will be extended them as bar-
gaining representatives until after an ___V

NLRB vote, these acting ste

are setting a record for on-the-job
action that can well be envied by es-
tablished local unions.

With the increased pace of their
on-the-job organizational work, all of
it based on the issues that face re-
finery workers every day of the
week, the Mine-Mill men have been
able to expose the Steel red-baiting
and smear-propaganda as the only
tactic available to Phil Murray’s boys
because of their lack of knowledge
of, or concern for, copper workers’
problems. - ‘

Int’! office is
now in Denver
DENVER, Colo.—-The International

office of Mine-Mill was scheduled to 4'

be open for business here today at
its new headquarters in the Tabor
Building, 16th and Curtis streets.

The ‘office was packed up and
moved out of Chicago last Wednes-
day. Staff members followed shortly’
after the moving vans had picked up
the furniture.

The last Chicago edition of THE
UNION went - to press la-st Friday.
January 26. The next edition will be
published here ‘in Denver. Local
union leaders and staff members are
reminded that all copy for THE

Your higher taxesgo
to war profiteers

WASHINGTON, D. C. (FP)-If you
were shocked by the budget message
asking federal expenditures of $71.6
billion and suggesting tax increases
of $16.5 billion, you’d better do some
preparing now or you’ll run head
on into another shock.

Though the President underscored

the huge size of this budget by say-
ing it is 78% -above expenditures for

/ the fiscal year ended last June 30,

and though his has repeatedly warned
that sacrifices——and substantial ones
——must come from every segment of
the U. S. population, the people of
the country still have no real concept
of what these sacrifices will be or
their magnitude.

The President gave two significant
hints which should alert any think-
ing citizen. He included recommen-
dations for what is called “obliga-
tional authority”—'—the‘right to spend
in amounts which in most cases were
far higher than the actual proposed
expenditures listed in the budget.

For instance, estimated expendi-
tures for the military services, direct,
are listed in thebudget at $41 bil-
lion. But recommended authority to
spend is given at $61 billion. Esti-
mated expenditures for international
security and foreign relations are
given as $71/2 billion, but recom-
mended additional authority to spend
is $11 billion.

On these two items alone, recom-
mended new. “authority to spend” is

.$23 billion more than t.he figures

listed for actual expenditures. But if
the agencies actually obligate them-
selves d-uring fiscal 1952 for these
sums, it is the same as spending the
sums. Thus the real budget for 1952
would be raised to $94% billion.

ANDITHE PRESIDENT said: “Fig-

” ures shown in ‘the budget for both

the military and the international

security programs may be subject to

substantial adjustment as the defense
program progresses. Actu-al'expendi-

tures will depend on how rapidly we ,

are able to produce the military items
for which funds are made available."

.A...J—’ ,,

_ rhe NAM Story

The situation was put another way
by a well-informed union economist
after reading the budget message.

"‘We‘ve got a budget of $71 billion to

support armed services of 3 52 million.
In 1945 we had a budget of $100

billion to support armed forces of 12 '

million. Compare the two and you
get an idea of how much federal
money is being expended to under-
write the huge corporation profits,”
he said.

The idea is worth investigating.

‘In 1945 corporate profits before taxes

were $19.7 billion, after taxes.$8.5
billion.
In 1949 horp-orate profits were

$27.6 billion before taxes and $17
billion after taxes.

IN 1950 the rate of corporate prof-
its has been climbing sensationally
from quarter to quarter. The first
quarter the rate viias $29.2 billion be-
fore and $17.2 after taxes. Second
quarter showed the annual rate of
profits at $37.4 billion before and
$22.2 after taxes. The third quarter
rate was $46 billion before and $23.6
after taxes. The economic advisers
are predicting a fourth quarter rate
showing $48 billion before taxes and
$24.5 billion after. ‘

It is no accident that the cost of
maintaining armed forces and pre-
paring for "war Qhas risen so startingly
above the cost of fighting an actual
war in 1945. ‘

The money Congress appropriates
for the military goes mostly to the
big corporations which manufacture
thin-gs needed by the‘ Army, ‘Navy
and Air Force. We have had eloquent
evidence from the Senate prepared-

rness subcommittee about how these

corporations are raising prices so fast
the military appropriations can hard-
ly keep up with them.

Now we see these price increases
reflected in huge profits. That’s
where Uncle Sam’s money is going.

Where does it come from? Out of
your pockets in increased taxes.

'__.___,The National Association of Manu-

iacfirrers started life simply enough
back in 1895 as a’ trade association
designed to deal with the promotion
of trade and commerce. . ‘
However, by 1903 it was well
launched on its crusade against the
welfare of the American people. In
that year, at its New Orleans con-
lvention, the NAM moved to combat
openly the growing labor movement.
The flavor of the convention can be
savored by a sampling of the keypad-

 dress by NAM President David M.

Parry: -

_ "‘Orgam‘.zed labor knows but one
law,” he declared, “and that is the
law of physical force—the law of the
Huns and "Vandals, the law of the
savage. All its purposes are accom-
plished either 03; actual force or by
the threat of "force . . . It is in all
essential features a mob-power, know-

ing no master except its own will. . .

_t.s’ history is stained with blood and

mini” . 4

Parry’s impassioned speech was

~ applauded by John Kirby Jr., later a.

president of the NAM, who asserted
that “l0% of the working classesin
‘this country are robbing the 90%——-
and the manufacturers and employers
included.” '

-THIS QUAINT-rIN0TE———that labor

was actually exploiting business —- ’

Vwas Tephrased 43 years-later at the’
. 1950 NAM convention by a self—styled
labor columnist, Victor - Reisel, who

.... ...... mill]

    

told the manufacturers they were the
only oppressed group’ left in the
world.

Out of the 1903 NAM convention
there came a special conference in
Chicago, where an organization called
the Citizens Industrial Ass’n of Ameri-
ca was created by the leaders of the
NAM. This citizens’ association im-
mediately undertook an aggressive
open shop campaign. It militantly
crusaded against labor, warning busi-
nessmen against “diseased unionism”

‘which was sure to bring “strikes, dis-

order, assaults, destruction of proper-
ty and loss of business.”

The CIAA and" the NAM, which
constantly inveighed against alleged
labor “violence,” turned completely
around and “encouraged vigilantism

by giving favorable publicity to ex-'

tra’-1ega1'a'c_tivities of citizens’ groups,”

according to the 1939'LaFo11ette com- _

mittee reports on the NAM.

D   Mine-lllli|l,olficers state
a position on mobilization

The Mine-Mill International officers, meeting last week in Chicago,
discussed the Truman “emergency mobilization” program and its rela-
tion to the interests of our union’s membership. The officers set forth
their thinking on this matter in a statement which will be presented to

the International Executive. Board when it meets at the new Denver
headquarters February 8. It is expected that the Board will work out a

   
 

detailed statement of policy in relation to these problems.

The officers" statement, adopted by President Clark, Vice-Presidents
Larson and Wilson and Secretary—Treasurgr Travis, follows:

The Truman “economic mobili-
zation” program is a plan to de-
liberately’ lower the living stand-
ards of the American people while
maintainin-g the highest level of

‘corporate profiteering in the his-

tory of the world.

Instead of rolling back and
freezing prices, as in World ‘Ii/ar
II, the corporation executives in
charge of the country’s economy
have chosen to “combat inflation"
by means of an even bigger tax-
grab out of every worker’s pay
check. Coupled with this is to be
wage freezing and a gesture in
the direction of price control.

This means that the deductions
from workers’ pay checks will
flow through the treasury back
into the pockets of the bosses in
the form of war profits.

Charles E. Wilson of General
Electrig, describediby the United
Electrical Workers as “the most
anti-labor individual” among em-
ployers, has been made dictator
over wages, prices and virtually
everything else. Cyrus Ching of

U. S. Rubber is in charge of wage

stabilization.
These men now have it within

Sonora, Arizona

 Gun-happy police

their power to issue decrees wip-
ing out gains for which working
people have struggledfor half a
century. They will go as far in
this direction as the people per-
mit. Already there are proposals
for a 44-hour week without over-
time pay.

The “labor representatives” ‘on
the National Wage Stabilization‘
Board‘ have given unanimous ap-
proval to a “stabilization” policy
calling for a wage freeze and
speedup. “Labor representation”
in an anti-labor program can be
nothing but a hoax. Labor needs
leaders who fight for their mem-
bers’ interests, not those who sit
with the bosses in a government
office cutting labor’s throat.

With this mobilization there is
no fair employment practices pro-
gram, as in World War II with
FDR, no gains in legislation. On,
the contrary, Truman has now
given up even pretending to push
for the social legislation of his
campaign promises.

A fight for the welfare of the
American people, for peace, civil
rights and fair employment prac-
tices, is the highest form of patriot-
ism. This_is in line with out con-
vention—adopted policy. It is in
line with policy of other unions

_ I ”Don’t complain, dear. This will give you an idea of
what a wage freeze is like." ’

i Refractory worlrers
win another round

DANVILLE, Ill. —— Workers in the
General Refractories plant here re-
ceived another wage increase Janu-
ary 1, as the result of bargaining on"
a wage reopener clause. The boost
brought wage increases for the last
six months to a total of approximately
23 cents, not counting a pension and
health and ,welfare plan negotiated
during 1950.

The new wage boost came to about
2"/é cents for workers in the lower
categories, and an average 6 cents
for the others.

By Nothonwilt
MMSW General Counsel

IN ITS ANALYSIS of the McCarrari
Law, the National Lawyers Guild says
that “as long as it remains in force. the
people of the United States live under a
political system fundamentally changed

from what we have known heretofore."

This is no exaggeration.

The Supreme Court has said that no
official may tell Americans what ideas they
may hold and what ideas they may not hold.
The McCarran Law changes this most fun-

damental aspect of the Bill of Rights.

The registration provisions have received
most attention, but other sections are fully as
vicious and dangerous.

THE McCAR,RAN LAW deals with three
main subjects and also contains a h0dge—podge
of provisions amending several criminal laws
and adding several new “crimes.”

This is not a Communist-control law. as it
has‘ been called, but a law to control the Ameri-
can people.

The three main subjects are: (1) 1‘egistra1.ion
of organizations; (2) aliens; and (3) concentration
camps.

/. Eegizi/ra.lion.

The law defines two types of organizations.
“Comm-unist-action organization” is defined as an
organization which “is substantially directed, dom-
inated, or controlled by the foreign government or
foreign organization controlling the world Com-
munist movement” and which “operates primarily
to advance the objectives of such world Com-
munist movement.”

“Communist-front organization” is defined

ed, dominated, or controlled by a Communist-

action organization, and is primarily operated
for the purpose of giving aid and comfort to
a Communist-action organization, a Communist
foreign government, or the world Communist-
movement.”

Both types of organizations have to reg-
ister their names, addresses and those of their
officers, and file financial statements. Only
“Communist-action organizations” are re-
quired to lis-t their members, and a member

whose name has not been listed by the

organization has to register himself.

Since the financial statements have to
include “sources” of all monies received,
the “Communist-front organizations” will
have to list members who pay dues or

make contributions of any kind.

IF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL
believes that an organization which
has not registered should do so, he
will file a petition with" the new

Subversive Activities Control Board
which, after hearing, can make an

order requiring t-he organization

to register. The organization
can secure court review of
\ such an order. but
“findings of the

 

as an organization which “is substantially direct-,

Board as to the facts, if supported by
the preponderance of the evidence,
should be conclusive.” ,

How will the Board decide whether

use

 

that the sponsoring organization is a
“Communist organization."

5. The organization may not accept
contributions from government or de-

an organization is 21 “Comm ,'st- n_qe\R;u01-kc]-S_
action org‘anr1.ation" or a “C _. ,, —

nist—l'ront organization"?

In the case of a “Comimmist—a('i.ion
organization,” the Board is to take
into consideration, among other things,
the extent to which ihe views and
policies of the organization “do not
deviate” from those of the foreign
government or foreign organization
which controls the world Communist
movement and the extent to which
the principal leaders of the organiza-
tion or a substantial n-umber of its
members “are subject to. or recognize,
the disciplinary power of such foreign
government or foreign organization
or its representatives."

IN THE CASE of a “Communist-
front organization," the Board is to
take into consideration. among other‘
things. “the extent to which the posi-
tions taken or advanced by it from
time to time on matters of policy do
not deviate from those of any Com-
munist - action organization, Commu-
nist foreign government, or the world
Communist movement” and the extent
to which “persons who are active in
its management. direction, or super-
vision, are active in the management,
direction. or supervision of any Com-
munist - action organization, Commu-
nist foreign government, or the world
Communist movement.”

If an organization does not register,
it becomes subject to a fine of $10,000
and each officer becomes subject to
the same fine plus five years’ im-
prisonment. In addition, each mem-

ber of a “Communist-action 9rga_p__i__-__.,,_,_

zation” who does not register himself
when the organization does not do so
(either by not complying or by omit-
ting his name when it does comply),

is subject to the same fine and im-_.,..

prisonment. Each day of failure to
register is a separate offense.

IF AN ORGANIZATION of either
type does register, either voluntarily
or after an order of the Board, the
following consequences ens-ue: “W '

1. Members may not apply for
government jobs. Members of a “Com-
munist—action organization” may not
hold jobs in a “defense facility” (as.
listed by the Secretary of Defense)
and members of neither type may
apply for such jobs without disclosing
their membemhip.

2. The organization is denied tax
exemption.

3. Members may not apply for, or
use, passports.

2. _/4/(‘(41.4

Space permits only a bare outline
of the "many changes the McCarran
Law makes concerning naturalization,
exclusion, and deportation. These pro-
visions are so drastic and so far-
reaching that each alien should be
sure to receive advice concerning his
own problems under this law.

The most important of these pro-
visions are:

1. Every alien residing in the
United States on January 1 of any
year must notify the Commissioner
of Immigration within ten days there-
after of “his current address." Failure
to do so is punished by a fine up to
$100 or imprisonment up to thirty
days, or both.

2. Aliens who hold or advocate
subversive doctrines, or who belong
to the Communist Party of this or any
other country or to an organization
which is registered or I‘€(1ul1'c(l to be
registered under the law, are subject
to exclusion or deportation, as the
case may be. These provisions are also
retroactive so that they apply to past
beliefs or affiliations, no matter how
far back.

3. Such provisions also apply to
naturalization, except that if the be-
liefs changed or the affiliations ceased
at least ten years before the alien
may be naturalized. The joker here is
‘that if the Government begins a de-
portation proceeding at any time be-
fore naturalization is c 0 m p I e t c d,
naturalization is forbidden. The result
is that although an alien could be
naturalized if he dropped a forbidden
affiliation more than ten years ago,
the Government can prevent his nat-
uralization. and have him deported in
addition, by instituting a deportation
proceeding. -

4. Upon the institution of any de-
portation procceding. the Government
can imprison an alien for as long as
the proceeding takes. This may be
years!

Most courts have already held that
despite the language of the law, the
Attorney-General may not so imprison
aliens unless he shows good cause.
After an order of deportation is issued,
the Government may imprison the
alien for six months.

The Government may also try to
send the alien to ANY country which

In the event of invasion, or a dec-
laration of war by Congress, or "in-
surrection within the United States
in aid of a foreign enemy,” the Presi-
dent may declare an “Internal Secur-
ity Emergency.” Thereupon, the At-
torncy-General may “apprehend” and
“detain” any person “as to whom
there is reasonable ground toibelieve
that such person probably will engage
in, or probably will conspire with
others to engage in, acts of espionage
or sabotage.” . _ .

Such a person may‘be “detained”
as long as the “emergency,” lasts. Thus
it is possible that such a person may
be detained” for the rest of his life.

After detention, a person is entitled
to a hearing before a “hearing officer”
and an appeal to a “Detention Review
Board.” In such proceedings, the At-
-torney—General ‘7sha1l not be required
to furnish information the revelation
of which would disclose t-he identity
or evidence of Government agents or
officers which -he believes it would
be dangerous to national safety and
security to divulge.”

If the Board issues an order of
detention, the person is entitled to
court review but the findings of the
Board, “if supported by reliable. sub-
stantial. and probative e v id e n c e ,
should be conclusive.” 5

States.” The statute of limitations for
peacetime espionage -is extended from
the present period of three .years "to

  LA gambling probe throws
suspicion on UAW leadership

LOS ANGELES, Calif.‘— Suspicion
of shady connections between top
leadership of the United Auto Workers
union and the underworld here deep-
ened last, week as a criminal indict-
ment was returned against Al Guasti,
former regional office employee.

By his own ' admission, Guasti
moved into his UAW set—up after re-
signing under fire as sheriff’.s depart-
ment captain in charge of the “anti-
subversive” detail.

Guasti was charged in a grand jury
indictment with perjury.,He was ac-
cused of lying when he d-en-ied writing
assistant police chief Joseph Reed a
scorching demand that he keep his
men out of unincorporated county
territory. The letter was written short-
ly after a police raid on a bookie
joint near the plush«y headquarters of
a $7,000,000 gambling empire.

The accused man admitted to re-
porters last month that he entered
union circles at the request of UAW
regional director Cyril O’Halloran.
Guasti said he was paid nothing for
his services. But 0’Halloran said he
was paid $75 a week.

However, UAW officials in the anti-
Halloran faction hinted that Guasti
may have been using his post in UAW
regional headquarters as a base in a
horse-betting syndicate reportedly
mushrooming in the area’s vast auto
and aircraft factories.

0’Halloran recently gave in to a
rank-and-file demand that Guasti be
fired from the union’s payroll, but
said: “I know any associations have
been completely honorable and often
of particular benefit to many of our
rank-and-file members.”

Urge pardon in F rame-up
"Marfinsivilleseven" case

CHICAGO, Ill.——A number -of Mine-
Mill locals last week were respond-
ing to the plea of International presi-
dent John Clark for action to help
save the lives of the “Martinsville
Seven” scheduled to be executed

February 2 and 5. '

The seven Virginia Negroes were
convicted in assembly line trials on

framed-up evidence which chargedg

they raped a- white woman, Mrs‘. Ruby
Floyd. Mrs. Floyd, who told a story
shot full of . contradictions, disap-
peared immediately after the trials
and has not been found since.
Although 44 Negroes have been

executed by the State of Virginia on

the charge of rape since 1908, not a
single white man has. been executed,
although a number of wh-ites have
been convicted of the crime.

- .The U. S. Supreme Court early’
this‘ month refused to. review the

frameup case‘ of the Martinsville

. Seven, and Virginia Gov. John Battle
so far has not responded to ipleasto

grant another stay‘ of execution.

r

The Civil Rights Congress declared
that “the same courts which work
to enforce jim crow and discrimina-
tion against Negroes throughout the
country cannot be relied upon to

. give justice in the case of the Mar-

-

tinsville Seven.”

The Congress called for a “Free-
dom Crusade” to Richmond, Virginia,
to demand of Governor Battle that
a full pardon for the Martinsville
Seven be granted. At the same time,
it called for letters, post cards and
telegrams to Governor John Battle,
State Capital. Richmond, -Va., de-
manding a pardon, and letters to
President Truman urging federal in-
tervention. * -

(Re-pn'ut:'d from ILWU Dixpatolter)

WASHINGTON, D. C. -— The CIO_
definition of “unity” is now being
carried into international labor con-
ferences.

Last week representatives of the
AFL and the CIO, with the State De-
partment pulling the strings, held a
convention in Mexico City with repre-
sentatives of similar government ap-
proved trade unions in North and’
South America to set up a rival labor
federation to the CTAL, led by Lom-

bardo Toledano of Mexico. -. h V"

The “CIO News” reported the con-
ference with that concern for the
truth that has made that publication
notorious——and we do mean notorious
——among labor newspapers. The head-
line to the story in the “CIO News”
read “Spirit of Unity Prevails as
Mexican Parley Opens.”

x

Buried in the bottom of the second 
column of the story is the news tlI”§f““‘

“(Editorial by President Boyce)

In the elect-ion of officers and dele-
gates by the unions the officers of

to influence the members of any
union upon the election of one can-
didate in preference to another, and
it is not our intention to deviate from
that principle at this time.

However, on account of our experi-
ence, which is more extensive than
a majority of the members, we are
in duty bound to offer our advice
.whenever we deem it advisable for
the best interests of the organiza-
tion’ or when called upon to do so
by any portion of its members.

We rejoice beyond measure as we
look back over the life of this in-
fant of the Rockies; when it was in
-its swaddl-in-g clothes hovering be-
‘tween life and death,- suffering from
the attacks of foes without and en-
emies within, and throughout this
period of suffering, sorrow and des-
pair, we were sustained in our poli-
cy by ninety-nine per cent of our

 associates in the organization, an
" acknowledgement of their confidence
. we shall forever remember.

We have stood by the cradle of this

‘infant when its star of life was al-
' st obscured and watched it grow
until it now stands before the world
a full grown Hercules and God for-
bid that we should live to see the
day when we will be compelled to
mourn over its bier.
Unfortunately we cannot deny that
we have traitors and_ spies in our or-
ganization, but this should not sur-
prise nor discourage us in the work
in which we are engaged.
Christ chose 12 apostles to preach
his gospel: “Do unto others as you
would that others shall do unto you,”
and among the chosen 12 there was a
doubting Thomas, a denying Peter
and a betraying Judas.
Fellow members, we say that your
_ organization is whatever you make
 it; no man can make it aught but
what the majority desires, and upon
your intelligence and the faithful per-
formance of your duty its success or
welfare depends. ‘
Unions should elect men who will
not hesitate to adopt a progressive
policy, untrammelled by political or
corporate influence, determined to
'3 their duty regardless of those we

:may offend.

. This organization owes no allegi-
‘Tance to any man; its success is-due
to" the intelligence and ability of its
4 ‘members to protect themselves; let
~ the independent men within its ranks
fdo their duty by electing men to

(Reprinted from Coeur d’Alene
Union News)

“Joe, are you goin-g"to mail this
letter or not?” It was -the little
woman calling from the kitchen.

“You’re danged right I’m gonna
mail it. Put it on my lunch bucket.”

“How /many eggs this morning,
Joe? And won’t youplease hurry up.
Your coffee’s getting cold.”

“Listen, sweetheart,” I yells back,
“if you’d string that clothes line
somewhere besides all over the bath-
room maybe I’d beaa little faster. I
got one of them nylons tangled up
in my toothbrush just now and like
to strangled before I got it loose.”

“Joe, if you snagged my only pair
of nylons I'll I’ll ———.”

“Two eggs is plenty, honey. And
put that fork down. You make me
nervous.” I sat down and sampled
the java. It was cold alright.

“Maybe you’d better move that
clothes line down here in the kitch-
en, Joe.”

“Oh no you don’t!” I held out my
cup for some hot coffee. "I’l1 shave
with them things you wash out every
evening, but I’ll be danged if I’ll eat
with them. Did * you stamp that
letter?” ’

“Yes, clear. But, Joe, are you sure
you ought to?”

“Ought to what?”

“Mail it.” And she slid two beau-
tiful eggs on my plate.

“Baby,” I said. “Look. Let me ask
you something. How many nights do
they make Harry Truman sleep on
the nasty letters he writes? One
night; just one night, ain’t it?‘ And
how many nights have I slept on
mine? Three! Now by the .”

“Okay,” she says, “here goes:

‘Dear Senator: I’m a miner and I
see by the papers that since we got
mixed up in this mess over in Korea
that the profits for the mine own-
ers have gone up 562.8 per cent. Now
that seems to me like quite a jump,
Senator. I guess you known how
much our wages have gone up since
the shooting started. In case you
don’t, I’ll tell you. They went up 80c
a day. That’s a 7 per cent increase,
and that didn’t come till November.
Before we finally got that raise, our
taxes were jacked up 20 per cent and
the cost of living got clear out of
sight. And the papers say that
clothes will be-up another 1-0 per

cent by spring and that groceries’

will keep right on going up.

‘So I guess you can see what's hap-
pening to us guys that work for a
livin-g. We’re taking an awful beat-
ing right where it hurts.’

‘Now don’t get the idea, Mr.
Congressman, that us miners want to
get rich off of this trouble over in
Korea. All we want to do is hold
the line on prices so the boys that do
come back will have a decent living
to come back to. But wh-at I’m rais-
ing hell about is the way prices and
taxes are running away from wages
so that our paycheck actually keeps
shrinking while the profits keep- on

rolling in like a J-une flood for the .

big fellows.’ ~

Sudbury

 

‘Mr. Senator, I don’t think any-
body ought to get rich off of the
blood of our boys who are dying and
freezing over there. And us working
guys _aren’t getting rich. We aren’t
even holding ‘”our ownﬁ. But the peo-
ple we work for are really making I.
killin-g——$5.62 now for every $1 be-
fore we got into this thing.’

‘What I say, Mr. Congressman, is
that profits shouldn’t be allowed to
increase one cent over what they
were, before we got into this bloody
business. And the taxes to pay for it
shouldn't be laid on us. They ought
to be put on the big shots, oecause
they can afford to foot the bill.’

‘I guess you know it isn’t just
the mine owners that are getting fat.
I see by one of our-union papers that
all companies together made four bil-
lion four ' hundred million more
profits AFTER TAXES in 1950 than
they did in 1949. And that figures
out to a 43% per cent increase that’s
just plain gravy, after taxes.’

‘Are you interested in how much
my income after taxes went up in
1950? It went up just $43 over 1949.
That’s a 11/2 per cent increase. And

you know what happened to prices-.~ 

in 1950. That’s quite a gap, Mr.
Senator, between their 431/é per cent
increase and my 1’/C2 per cent. What’:
the score, Senator? What’s going on
back there anyway? I’d appreciate it
if you’d write and tell me, if you
can find the time. Very sincerely
yours, Mucker -Joe.’ Well, that’s it
Joe. Shall .” ‘ ‘
“Holy cow, honey! It’s half past.
I’ve got to run. Look, sugar, seal
that letter up and put another stamp
on it and send it air mail. You mail
it. I won’t have time. See you to-_
night.” -

Report $80,000 paid in welfare
benefits in first two years

SUDBURY, Ont.—In its first two

i years. of operations, Local 598’s Wel-

fare Plan paid out $80,455.90 in
benefits, acquired fixed assets of
$22,524.25, a cash reserve fund of
$30,769.48 and a current bank bal-
ance of $7,482.82, according to a re-
portwissued last month by the Wel-

ployed at the International Nickel
Company, Canadian I n d u s t r i e s
Limited, Copper Cliff plant, and the
Sudbury Construction and Machinery
Company, who suffered illness or in-
jury not covered by the Workmen’s
Compensation Board.

The plan derives its income from
a monthly contribution of 50 cents
by each employee within the bar-

gaining unit of the three companies.

and was launched December 1,1948.
Benefit payments are made accord-
ing to regulations established at._that

A breakdown of the Welfare Com-

Through rigid economy, the commit-

tee was able to reduce administrative
expenses during the second yeargof
operation by $2,302.38 as compareel
with the‘first year.

In addition to the payment of di-
rect benefits to sick and" injured
members, the committee. points out
that the fund duringthe year 1950
purchaseda large property on a lake
near Sudbury for the sum of $20,000
which will be used for summer camps
and, other recreational benefits for
the members. Development work at
this property is scheduled to start,

. ;HE LAST evening of FDR’s life
- ‘ as spent in writing a message to the
American people. We were near the
~- end of a war that cost the lives of
.“ . - 30 million human beings. Roosevelt

‘-“er”  was writing about how to preserve p

the peace he knew was nea“ at hand.
What he wrote (see out at right)
goes to the heart of the problem of
"world peace today- FDR SD01“? 0f “me
science of human relationships.” He
foresaw that different ways of life,
different economic systems, would
lead to conflicts of interest resulting
it. new threats of var.
. .The atomaniacs of today try to tell
us that if FDR were alive he would
be on their side. But no strained
logic can “prove” this point. It is

‘contrary to the basic direction of

Roosevelt’s life.
_Roosevelt’s genius was his ability

to understand the purposes of groups,

whose interests were not the same as
his. and to find ways of working with

them. ,
, Though FDRihad the ‘support of the
__/' working people, he himself was not
of the working class. He stated that
his New Deal program saved control
of t_he United States xfor his class—the
owning class. He saw that his class
could survive only if it took some
account of the needs and desires of
the working people —— and of their
growing ability to demand some de-
gree of control of their own destiny.
He‘ applied the same principle to
international relations. He recognized,
. with Churchill,” that the socialist part
of the world was a force with which
we had to work in order to win the
war against fascism. His last message
to us indicates that he understood six
years ago better than our leaders of
today that if we are to survive we
must take account of the needs and
desires of other peoples-—-and of the
growing ability of colonial and former
colonial peoples to control, their own

destinies. 7
