Wages In Mexican Money

By MA-RY El.‘ Manor.

If your employer shouldlpay you off in MEX- I

ICAN money what would you do?’ Probably you
and the men or women who work in the shop
beside you would strike and demand U. S. money
again. -»

We all knew that Mexican money was worth
about half as much as U. S. money. But times are
changing. American money -has sunk in value.
Compared to the value of a dollar ten years ago
a dollar is only worth about 70 cents to-day.
This is because gold is decreasing in value. The
big capitalists" are saying AMONG THEMSELVES
that within three or four years GOLD will be

Worth about HALF its value ten yearsago. THE '

RESULTS WILL BE THE SAME AS THOUGH
THE WAGES OF THE WORKERS WERE PAID
IN MEXICAN MONEY. .

WE all see this. We ﬁnd our money buys a

great deal less than it bought a few years ago. In , —
', fact ten dollars goes only about two-thirds as far

as it went then. In three or four years it will
BUY STILL LESS. ‘

‘Everybody is talking to-day about HIGH
PRICES. The facts are that PRICES have risen

- because gold (or money) is worth a great deal
less.’ Some people understood this. This is the

decreased so far that a dollar in U. S. money
will be worth only as much as MEXICAN cur-
rency, people will demand 20 cents ‘a pound for
10-cent steaks; $6.00 for a $3.00 pair of shoes
and $10.00 for a $5.00 basement. The people who
SELL commodities are already demanding higher
prices for them.

W’e working folks have just one thing to sell.
To our bosses we. sell our labor-power (our power
to labor, to do things, make things, run machines).
If a_ dollar to-day is worth only 70 cents—WE
WANT HIGHER WAGES and WE WANT THEM
NOW. 

If we go alone and demand higher ‘wages from
the boss we shall be very unlikely to get them.
But if every man in the factory, mine, mill or on
the railroad makes this demand, the boss will be
compelled to yield There are many of you. The
bosses are few. If you STAND TOGETHER you
can ALWAYS WIN.

The defeats of labor may always be laid to the
DIVISION of labor. We join craft unions instead
of forming ONE BIG union. We vote for the
Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the In~
dependent Party and the Socialist Party. Instead
of belonging to ONE GREAT LABOR UNION,
instead of, joining the ONE GREAT WORKING-
MAN’S PARTY—the Socialist Party, We divide
our forces. Part of us vote one way and part
another. VVe have not brains enough to vote

"' TOGETHER for our OWN class. We form half a
I dozen unions in the shop so that when one little

    
   
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
    

reason why prices have risen. When gold has

craft is out on a strike for higher wages, the other
little unions can do OUR work, ﬁll OUR jobs and
help theboss the run the factory and BREAK
OUR STRIKE. 1
ONE GREAT union and ONE GREAT working

A class party! These are the weapons that will

carry the working class on ‘to VICTORY" every
time. The capitalists are telling each other (very
quietly, so that we may not hear) that prices are
going to continue "to RISE. So get husy and
organize that union to-day. With prices going up

0 every month the Wage workers are going to have ‘

a hard ﬁght for a bare existence the next few
years. Organize that union and prepare to FIGHT!
.I heard a miner say he got $2.00 a day for dig-
ging out $10.00 worth of coal. A big strapping
teamster, who heard his remark asked:
“Well, WHY do you DO it?”

“What are you going to do about it?” the miner

I said. “The boss owns the MINE.”

And this is the cause of all the misery and pov-
ertyt in the World to-day. The bosses own the
MINES, the MILLS, the RAILROADS, the FAC-
TORIES. The coal we dig out, the shoes we make,
are worth four or ﬁve times What the bosses pay
us in wages. And the bosses are‘ going to» keep
right on taking the rake—0ff (or profits) just
as long, as we let them. They are going to keep
right on paying us only a small part of the value

«of the coal we dig, andthe things we make, just

as long as they own the mines, mills, land, fac-
tories, etc.

Higher wages will help us all to-day to a better
living. But the living of a wage-worker is a very

_ uncertain one, at best. It will only become certain

when the mines, mills, factories, railroads and land
become the common property of all the workers.

The collective ownership of these things is the
aim of the Socialist Party. This is why every
workingman should be a Socialist. You must

. ﬁght for higher wages and shorter hours, but

remember that it is the bosses’ ticket that makes
the LAWS, and the bosses’ candidate is going to
trick YOU and ME at every turn.

It has always been the toil of the laborers that
has enabled the bosses to pile up millions. The
bosses will always be able to grow rich as long
as THEY own the MACHINES. Socialists pro-
poses the ownership of the machines FOR AND BY
the workers. They propose to stop making proﬁts
for the idle millionaires -and to KEEP. THE
VALUE OF THEIR PRODUCTS THEMSELVES.

Think it over and talk it over with the men in
the shop. You want all of the good things of this
world that you can use. You can’t afford to over-
look a movement that is organizing to. keep the
wealth of the'world, produced BY the workers, in
the hands of the workers themselves. A
