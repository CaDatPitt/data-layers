over many years. Obviously they have not shared fairly in the wealth
they have produced. ‘

Some years ago I gave in the New Republic an account of the
effort to mobilize the stockholders of the textile mills of New Bedford
in support of the strikes against a wage cut. The strikers drew up a
powerful plea to the stockholders arguing that the plight of the com-
panies was due largely to the graft and nepotism of managers, who
were in effect doub-le—crossing both owners and workers. It would be a
less hopeful effort to bring any considerable number of the holders
of General Motors stock to intervene in behalf of the workers against
the immensely successful management of the company, but neverthe-
less an appeal from the U.A.W.U. board of strategy to- the share-
holders, broadcast through the press, would have some effect. We
should be informed of the fact that since the settlement arranged by
President Roosevelt three years ago there has been constant chiseling
by some of our employees to the disadvantage of others. In the Chev-
rolet plant men are dismissed for wearing badges, for speaking of the
union in the lunch hour. At the A. C. spark-plug works girls are en-
titled to pay increases based on the length of their employment, but
they are dismissed when they rise too high in the scale. They may be
taken back after a time as beginners.

It is absurd to pretend that either the company or the govern-
ment under whose auspices the agreements were made has provided

 

any practicable means of rectifying these grievances of the workers.”

The managers to whom We pay grotesquely huge salaries act the part
of ownership, and their behavior is an insult to- the intelligence and
humanity of those to whom they are legally responsible; They inter-
pose objection to dealing with the U.A.W.U. on the ground that it
does not represent all the workers. I should judge that at Flint it was
pretty nearly their unanimous choice. In any case it does represent
the only effective form of labor organization applicable to a gigantic
and far-ﬂung industrial aggregration such as General Motors, and
the only practicable method of forcing the elimination of unfair prac-
tices under which the workers suffer. As such it deserves the support
of the public and especially of that not inconsiderable number who
hold the not inconsiderable number who hold the legal responsibility
of ownership of the corporation.

"sn- DOWN "
By JOEL SEIDMAN
0

When they tie the can to a union man,’
Sit down! Sit down!
When they give him the sack, they’ll take him back,

Sit down! Sit down!

Chants
Sit down, just take a seat,
Sit down, and rest your feet,
Sit down, you’ve got ’em beat.

Sit down! Sit down!

NEW strike technique has swept the country, arousing enthus-
  iasm among workers, and bewilderment among employers.
In industry after industry, in state after state, the workers
remain at their posts but refuse to work. No longer is it possible to
introduce strikebreakers, for the workers are in possession. Nor are
the workers readily dispersed, for they can barricade themselves in a
strong defensive position. If strikebreakers or police storm the factory
gate, they are clearly responsible in the eyes of the public for what-
ever violence may occur. The employer cannot too easily afford to
alienate public opinion, nor risk damage to his machinery. And so
the Workers remain in possession of the plant, in much more comfort
and security than on the picket line.

Employers and their allies have been quick to attack sit_-down
strikes on the ground of illegality. It is precisely because such strikes
seem to challenge the rights of property ownership that such contro-
versy has been aroused over them. And yet it should be clear that sit-

down strikers are not challenging the ownership of the plant, but

merely the employer’s right to dismiss them and operate with strike-
breakers. That is admittedly legal, for otherwise the right to organize
and bargain collectively could not be exercised. Nor should one be

9

i

unduly disturbed if conservative judges at first hold sit-down strikes
illegal, for virtually every weapon developed by labor has been held

L illegal in its early stages.

Another charge leveled against the sit-down strike is that it ‘per-
mits a minority to coerce the majority. Unfortunately for its ability

 

to convince, that argument is heard too much from the,,employers or «

from organizations sponsored by them, and not frequently enough
from workers themselves. It is precisely those who seek absolute in—
dustrial power for themselves who are loudest in their defense of the
liberty of the non—unionist. The truth of the matter is that a strike
can only be maintained and won by the solidarity of the great mass
of workers. If they are indiﬁ"erent or hostile the strike is doomed,
whether it be of the sit—down or the walk-out variety. It should be
remembered, moreover, that sometimes the strikers delegate a minority
of their number to occupy the plant, to lessen the problems of sani-
tation, feeding, and organization. If those employers who soizealously
protect the rights of non-unionists to remain unorganized would in-
stead admit the principle of labor organization and engage in genu-
ine collective» bargaining, the number of strikes would be very few
indeed.

Nor is the sit—down strike a revolutionary weapon, as some have
proclaimed. It asserts, not the right to the factory, but the right to
the job. It is scarcely more revolutionary to bar strikebreakers by re-
maining inside the plant than by maintaining a picket line outside.
Nevertheless the sit—down should be regarded as a. distinct forward
step, for it exhibits a healthy disregard of the property rights held

supreme under our present system of law. The sit—down strike should

be sharply distinguished from the seizures of Italian factories by
workers following the World War, for there is no attempt to operate
the plant. The sit—down is a challenge to constituted authority, but so
is every picket line. Indeed, if our experience to date is typical, there is
likely to be less violence and less destruction of property in a sit-down
strike than in a walk-out.” The sit-down has been compared by some to
the Gandhi passive resistance movement in India. It has alsokbeen
compared to the tactics of some workers’ groups in Europe and the
Industrial Workers of the World in the United States, who in certain
cases stayed on the job but accomplished as little as possible. \
The sit—down strike should be viewed, not as an isolated occurrence,

10

 

but in the light of the complex social situation that gives rise to it.
Those who wish to avoid it will make most progress, not by attacking
the result, but by removing the cause. No worker for slight cause
cuts oil’ his income, even temporarily, and it is no comfort to sleep in
a factory instead of a home. If workers strike, whether by remaining
in or Walking out of the factory, it is because they have suﬁered
from grievances‘ to the limit of their endurance,‘ and because they have

learned that only by striking will their complaints be adjusted.

The rubber workers of Akron have engaged in more sit—down strikes
than have any other group of workers in this country, and probably
in the world. Their attitude is well expressed by Sherman H. Dalrym-
ple, president of the United Rubber Workers of America:

Sit-downs do not occur in plants where true collective bargaining exists. Where
management does not attempt to destroy unionism by ﬁnancing company
unions, by the formation of vigilante groups, and by placing other obstacles in
the path of legitimate union growth, there is such a spirit of cooperation between
the union and management that cessations of work do not occur.

Recent sit—downs in Akron have occurred because management either did not
enter into fair negotiations on certain grievances or deliberately postponed de-
cisions until resentment of the workers grew so keen that they resorted to sit-
downs as a last resort.

The fact that these grievances were settled satisfactorily immediately after
the sit—downs deﬁnitely indicates that they could have been settled just as

easily before if management had negotiated fairly with the union committee b

in their efforts to secure peaceful settlement of the issues involved.

It is our contention that the only way these sit-downs can be avoided in the
future is through the proper application of all the rules of ‘ true collective
bargaining in a spirit of fair play.’ ’

Early Uses of thé Sit—Dozem in America

It is impossible to determine accurately when and where the sit-
down strike was ﬁrst used. It seems such a logical tactic for workers
to employ that there are probably many unrecorded instances, each
one short in duration, going back almost as far as our modern in-
dustrial civilization. The Wonder is that its use did not become wide-
spread much earlier.

In at least two American industries it has long been common for
workers to stop work without leaving their place of employment. In
theanthracite coal ﬁelds the breaker boys, whose task it was to re-
move impurities from the coal, early fo-rmed the practice of stopping

11

work without leaving their places when they were dissatisﬁed. Similar-
ly miners have stopped loading coal when they were not adequately
supplied with timber for safety protection. ,

In the women’s garment industry, as far back as 1910,.,workers
have ceased operations without leaving the shop. Partly this has been
done when a contract forbade strikes, the workers arguing that a
mere stoppage was not a violation. These stoppages, as they were
called, attracted little attention because they were usually settled
within a few hours, and lacked the drama and publicity value of a
picket line. Seldom, if ever, did the workers remain at their places
over night, tho-ughstoppages often continue for several days. In
the Schenectady, N. Y., plant of the General Electric Company,
similarly, a sit-down strike occurred as early as 1906. In 1933, 2,500
employees of the Hormel Packing Company in Austin, Minnesota, sat
down for three days and won their strike against speed—up, for shorter
hours and better wages. Many other instances doubtless occurred in
other industries. During the depression the unemployed in New Jersey
and elsewhere, took possession of legislative chambers, in an effort to
dramatize their plight and force more adequate relief policies.

Seamen used the sit-down strike on the Paciﬁc coast early in 1936.
Seamen on the Panama Paciﬁc liner California had signed o-n at the
Atlantic coast rates. In an effort to obtain the higher Paciﬁc coast
rates, they struck for three days while the ship was at the San Pedro,
California docks. The men remained on board, but refused to work.
Had they struck while the ship was at sea, they would have been sub-
ject to a charge of mutiny. As it was, they narrowly escaped arrest
on that charge. The line refused to reemploy the strikers when the ship
reached New York, and a long strike against the International Mer-
cantile Marine Company was the result.

Sit-Downs Abroad

In a number of miners’ strikes in European countries during the
depression, the sit-down technique has been coupled with a hunger
strike in order to force concessions from the employer. Workers do

not deliberately starve themselves unless low wages have forced them

to the point of desperation. The coal miners of Terbovlyé, J ugoslavia,
reached that point in the summer of 1934. Whole families had lived

on the equivalent of a dollar a week, and yet another wage cut was
announced. Strikes and demonstrations were not allowed, and most

unions had been outlawed. Five thousand miners entered the mine on L

the morning of July 3 and remained there without working or eating.
Signs were nailed over the entrance of the shaft: “We, workers in these
mines, decline all food until the latest wage reduction is rescinded. We
prefer quick to slow starvation. Our families will not be much worse
off without us.” In the afternoon the company rescinded the reduction
order, and the workers emerged triumphant. 'l
Three months later, 1,200 coal miners of Pecs, Hungary, brought
the sit-do-wn, or rather stay-in, strike sharply to the attention of the
world. The miners had lived for years at the bare subsistence level.
For some time they had been wo-rking only two days weekly, receiving
about $2 as their weekly income. They decided that quick starvation
was" better than the slow torture to which.they had be-en subjected,
and in October, 1934, they went on a hunger strike within the mine.
For more than 100 hours they remained in the mine, without food or
water. Five unionists who were sent into the mine by Premier Gomboes
to confer with the men were held below as hostages. It was reported

‘that crazed men were chained to [posts to prevent suicide. Lajos

Molnar, a 72-year old miner, described the suffering of the men in this
fashion:

The pangs of hunger maddened us to such an extent that we ate leather
belts, and gnawed at shoes. We couldn’t even have the mercy of sleep because

the corridors of the pits are so narrow that we were forced to stand up on
each side of the corridor.

The heroism and determination of the miners won concessions from
the company that owned the mine, and on the ﬁfth day the men
emerged. Some were brought out on stretchers, and 110 in all were
rushed to the hospitals. The men won a bonus of $3 to each miner
who worked through the winter and a Christmas bonus of the same
amount. A wage cut was averted. In February, 1937, a second com-
bination sit—down and hunger strike was conducted by the Pecs miners.

In late October, 1934, 60 miners in Katowice, Poland, conducted
a hunger strike in a coal mine to prevent the dismissal’ of the entire
force and the abandonment of the mine. As the year ended 370 em-

I ployees, including a number of women, barricaded themselves in a

tobacco factory in Saloniki,5 Greece, determined not to leaveeuntil

14:

 

their wages were increased. The police surrounded the plant, and
refused to allow food to reach the strikers. The water supply was also

L shut oﬂ’, as was electrical current. A general strike was declared in

Saloniki in sympathy with the besieged strikers. In the following sum-
mer 3,000 copper miners, in an effort to force higher _wages, took
possession of the Rio Tinto mines. near Huelva, Spain. After ten days
they came to the surface, but the strike continued. ,

In the fall of 1935 it was 71 Welsh miners at the Nine-Mile Point
Colliery in Monmouthshire who conducted a stay-down strike. The
miners were not far above the subsistence level, and even their poor
standards were threatened by the employment of cheap non-union
labor. In protest the men struck. They stayed in the mine slightly more
than a week, living on sandwiches and tea sent down by their families
an.d friends. They held daily religious services, and sang and debated
to pass the time away. Meanwhile the strike spread, until 20,000
miners had stopped work. At the Taff-Merthyr colliery strikebreak-

era, with police protection, went into the mine and conquered stay-
‘down strikers after a ﬁerce battle 800 feet below the surface. Forty

men were wounded in that struggle, The Nine-Mile Point strikers
came up when the Mineworkers’ Federation of Great Britain decided
to take a strike ballot in all the English, Scotch, and Welsh coal ﬁelds.

Elsewhere in Scotland and Wales stay-down strikes of coal miners
occurred in 1936. In August, 1936, both Polish and French miners
conducted stay-down strikes, the former also going on a hunger strike
in an effort to collect back wages due them. The French miners sought

‘the discharge of overseers charged with brutality. Several months
[earlier rubber workers at Cracow, Poland, had conducted a sit-down‘
‘ strike in the course of which six were killed and twenty Wounded.

In far-olf India the sit-down made its appearance in June, 1936.

' Five. thousand textile workers at Pondicherry, angered by the non-

payment of overtime wages and the failure to raise pay, took posses-
sion of the plant. After a week the strike ended with victory for the
workers. ’ 0

Rubber Workers Sit Down

It remained for the Akron rubber workers to popularize the sit-
down in the United States. According to Louis Ad-amic' it was ﬁrst
used by ball teams of union rubber workers, who sat down on the

15

coon

, grass or on benches and refused to play until they were provided with

an umpire who was a union man. Later a dozen of them remembered
this technique when they were dissatisﬁed with working conditions.
The paralysis spread through the plant, and within an hour the ‘dis-
pute was settled. ‘

The sit—down played a part in the circumstances that led up to the
big Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company strike of February~March,
1936. Fundamentally it was insecurity, speed-up, the threat of lower

1 wages and longer hours, and the refusal of the company to engage in

genuine collective bargaining that caused the strike. The immediate
cause was the laying oﬁ” of 70 men in the tire division, which con-
vinced the workers that the company planned to change from the six-
hour to the eight—hour day. In protest against the lay—off 137 men
engaged in a sit—down strike, whereupon they were dismissed. Mass
meetings were called, and the company under pressure agreed to rehire
the 137 and reconsider the suspension of the 70. Nevertheless astrike

acquired momentum and mass picketing closed down the entire plant,

with 145,000 workers idle. The strike was started spontaneously and
was then officially sanctioned by the union.

The rubber workers are new and enthusiastic unionists. The sit—_

down technique works, and so they use it as soon as an issue arises.
Their oﬂicers are urging them not to stop production without first
bringing their grievance to the attention of the union and the company
through the regular channels. During 1936 there was scarcely a week
that did not witness at least one sit—down in the rubber plants. In a
single plant in less than a year no less than 58 were counted, ranging

in length from an hour or less to two or three days. Following one sit-

down 31 Goodyear strikers were charged with inciting to riot, but the
charges were later dismissed. As the rubber workers become more ex-
perienced and more disciplined unionists, the sit—downs over petty is-
sues will doubtless disappear.

“A Million Frenchmen Can’t Be Wrong”

What European miners and American rubber workers had done on
a small scale, the French workers did on a mass basis, in one of the
most amazing» strike waves of history. The strike wave, though largely
spontaneous and unorganized, could not have been better timed. Had

it begun earlier than May, 1936, the police would have been sent
against it, and large quantities of blood would have been spilled. Had
it come later it would have weakened the Popular Front government.
It started at the most opportune moment, when Leon Blum and his
associates were about to take power. With the workers bringing steady
economic pressure on the employers, the Popular Front government
was able to enact a remarkable series of labor laws.

The strike wave began in the metal industry in the Paris area. The
workers, most of them unorganized, struck because hours were long,
wages low, and the cost of living high. Since the pattern of occupying
the plants was set by the ﬁrst group, all others followed. In all direc-
tions and to all industries the movement spread. Once the workers had
occupied the plants, they turned to the unions for aid and experienced
leadership. The unions grew remarkably. The National Federation of
Salaried Employees, for example, grew from 18,000 to 220,000. The
French Confederation of Labor rose to 5,000,000, doubling its mem-
bership. Automobile factories, department stores, munitions plants,
shipyards, textile factories——all were occupied. At the peak about
1,000,000 workers were in possession of their plants. The cabinet in
adjoining Belgium warned its workers not to follow the French ex-
ample. The movement spread to Tunis, the French dependency in
northern Africa. Even before the great wave of sit-downs began in
France, it is interesting to note, the huge Michelin tire plant had
been ocupied by its workers. The Michelin workers were familiar with
the Akron strikes, and were directly inﬂuenced by them.‘

Despite the magnitude of the strike wave, there was practically no
violence. The strikers maintained perfect discipline, and took excellent
care of the plants. Disregarding the employers’ pleas that he evict
the strikers with force, Premier Blum insisted that their just griev-
ances be remedied. Since the employers balked at signing contracts
with their workers, the Chamber of Deputies rushed through legisla-
tion restoring wage cuts, establishing the 40-hour week and the right
of labor to bargain collectively, and granting vacations with pay and
special tax exemptions.‘ Through this legislation the sit-downers of
France have left an impress upon labor relations that will long
endure. Later Blum, under pressure from the right, promised that
ﬁirther occupation of factories would not be tolerated. The workers,

however, dissatisﬁed with the terms offered them, continued to occupy
some of the plants.

U. .4. W. A.; 1.937 Model

The next chapter, one of the most stirring in the history of the sit-
down strike, was Written in the United States. Automobile workers
took the new weapon, adapted and developed it, and with its aid
brought the powerful and anti-union General Motors Corporation to
terms.

A short sit-down strike had occurred in the automobile industry as
early as spring, 1934, in the White plant in Cleveland. This strike
was settled within several hours. The first strike in which automobile
workers stayed in the plant over night occurred in the Bendix plant
in South Bend, Indiana. On November 17, 1936, workers in several
Bendix departments, inﬂuenced by the successfulsit-downs in the
Akron rubber industry, stopped work but remained at their machines.
The company ordered all Workers‘ to assemble outside the plant, to
decide whether they wished to work. To forestall this attempted lock-
out, the Bendix workers determined to remain in the plant until the
management came to terms. In a week victory was won.

The same day the Bendix strike ended, 900 workers in the Midland
Steel plant in Detroit sat down. This strike had been planned as a
stay—in, to utilize the technique used so effectively in South Bend. This
strike marked the ﬁrst use of the stay—in technique by automobile
workers in Michigan. Again the strike ended in a smashing victory for
the union. In mid-December the sit-down movement spread to the
workers of the Kelsey-Hayes Wheel Company of Detroit. Two short

_sit-downs ended with the company’s promise to negotiate; on its fail-

ure to live up to its promise the workers sat down again, this time
with the determination not to resume work until they had won their
demands, There was also a brief sit-down strike in the Windsor, On-
tario, plant of the Kelsey Wheel Company, Ltd., a subsidiary of the
Ke1sey—Hayes Wheel Company. In the meantime other sit—downs were
occurring in Detroit, in the plants of the Aluminum Company of
America, Bohn Aluminum, and Gordon Bakery. Thus the stage was
set for the big sit-down strike in Flint.

In November and December, 1936, the campaign of the United
Automobile Workers of America to organize the General Motors Cor-

19

poration workers was nearing a climax. The auto workers enjoyed
the backing of the progressive unions of the Committee for Industrial
Organization. In the Warfare between non—union mass production in-
dustry and the C.I.O-., the General Motors strike was the ﬁrst major
battle. Realizing that much might depend upon the outcome, both sides
unstintingly threw their resources into the struggle.

I nterpress

A Night in Paris

In December the union requested a conference with the heads of the
General Motors Corporation, to engage in collective bargaining on
behalf of all the corporation’s employees. This request was denied,
and the union was told to take up grievances with individual plant man-
agers. At this point, in the Fisher Body plant of the corporation in
Flint, Michigan, 3. sit—down that began inauspiciously enough was
destined to have far-reaching consequences.

20

 

 

On December 29 the union presented a proposed contract to the
plant manager, in Flint, requesting an answer within a week. The next
morning a sit-down began-in the No. 2 plant, when inspectors were
transferred to other jobs because they would not leave the union. Late
the same day the men in No. 1 were alarmed to- see dies placed on
box cars bound for Pontiac and Grand Rapids, where the union is
weaker. To protect their jobs they kept the line from starting up
again, and remained in possession of the plant. Slowly the tie—up
spread through the vast General Motors system, as more and more
plants were affected by strikes or the shortage of necessary parts.
By. early February almost all of the 200,000 General Motors em-
ployees were idle, and the weekly production of cars had declined to
1,500 from the mid-December peak of 53,000.

' . Behind the General Motors strike there was a long record of ef-
forts by the United Automobile Workers of America to bargain col-
lectively, with delays and evasions on the part of the corporation.
Especially did the Workers rebel against the speeding up of produc-
-tion and the spy system employed by the company. Repeated efforts
of the union to win recognition and obtain a union contract came to

« naught, and in the meantime discrimination against union members

0 continued. Complaints were made to the National Labor Relations

Board that General Motors had violated the law by discharging em-
ployees for union activity, using industrial spies, and dominating a
company union in its St. Louis plant. Scarcely had the hearing gotten
under way when the corporation sought an injunction to restrain the
board from proceeding further. The injunction was denied in the fed-
eral district court, but a subsequent appeal and stay prevented the
board from proceeding. Six months later, when the strike began, the
hands of the board were still bound.

From the first the corporation officials insisted that they would not
negotiate so long as the strikers held the plants. The men suspected
8. ruse, knowing that if they left the plants they would lose their power
to prevent production. They agreed to leave, however, if the company
pledged itself not to try to operate the plant or to move machinery
while negotiations were in progress. The company refused.

21

Inju/notions and Tear Gas in Flint

On January 2 the struggle entered a new phase. Upon the com-
pany’s petition, Judge Edward S. Black issued a sweeping injunction
restraining the union from continuing to remain in the plant, from

picketing, and from interfering in any manner with those who wished.

to enter the plant to work.‘ To obey the injunction would be to concede
the loss of the strike. The injunction exposed the hollowness of the
company’s complaint against possession of its plant, for a stay-out
strike would have been crushed as surely as the sit—down, had the writ
been obeyed. Later, in Cleveland, the corporation was to seek an in-
junction against strikers who had left the plant to form a picket line.
Small wonder that when the sheriﬂ‘ read the injunction to the Flint
strikers and asked them to leave voluntarily he was laughed out of the
plant. Three days later it was discovered that the injunction judge
owned stock in General Motors. The union charged that he owned 3,-
665 shares, worth $219,900 at the current market quotation, and the
judge admitted ownership of 1,000 shares. The union thereupon peti-
tioned the state legislature to impeach Judge Black, for his violation
of the statute forbidding a judge from sitting in a case in which he
has an interest. The company, sensing its weak position, did not apply
for the writs of body attachment which would have required the sheriﬁ'
to attempt to arrest the sit-down strikers for contempt of court.

Suddenly, on January 11, the company changed its tactics. Heat in
the plant was shut off, and city police mobilized in the area. Company
police attempted to starve out the sit-downers, attacking carriers of
food and removing the ladders by means of which ‘food had been
brought in. The sit-downers, in return, captured the gates from the
company police. The city police, who had cleared nearby streets in ad-
vance, then attacked in an effort to recapture the gates. Tear gas
bombs were hurled against the sit—downers and their sympathizers out-
side. Strikers used the fire hoses within the plant to direct streams of
water on the police and on the gas bombs. During the battle the sit-
downers, who had until then occupied only the second ﬂoor of the

. plant, took possession of the entire building. For four hours the strik-

ers fought the police,‘ who used clubs, tear gas, and riot guns. Fourteen
workers were wounded by the police gunﬁre, one of them seriously,
and dozens were tear—gassed. Within the sound truck union organizers

22

 

 

i took turns at the microphone, shouting encouragement to the strikers,
' and giving direction to the battle. When the battle ended the strikers

remained in victorious possession of the plants. ’
The county prosecuting attorney, who owned 61 shares of General
7 Motors stock, jailed the wounded as they were released from the hospi-
tal, and obtained 1,200 John Doe warrants under which any strike
sympathizer could be arrested. Seven of the Flint strike leaders were
3 arrested, charged with unlawful assembly and malicious destruction
of property. The union demand for the arrest of the police, company
guards, and others who had been responsible for the attack was dis-
9 regarded. In the meantime National Guardsmen were mobilized and

. sent to Flint.

At this point, the public was relieved to learn that a truce had been
arranged. General Motors agreed to enter into negotiations with the
union in an effort to settle the strike, and the union in return agreed to
evacuate all plants held by it, whether in Flint or elsewhere. One of the
most important matters to be considered in the negotiations. was

 whether the United Automobile Workers should be recognized as the
sole bargaining agency for the workers. Thirty minutes before the
sit-downers were to march out of the Flint plants, and after other
 plants had already been evacuated, the union discovvered that W. S.
-  Knudsen, executive vice-president of the corporation, had agreed to
bargain collectively with the Flint Alliance, a semi-company union, ’
semi-vigilante strikebreaking organization inspired by the company.
Regarding this as a violation of the truce, the union refused to evacu-
ate the plants, and General Motors thereupon cancelled the scheduled
conference. Several days later the corporation announced that 110,-
000 workers had signed petitions asking to be returned to work, but
this number was exaggerated and the union showed that large numbers
of the signatures had been obtained by intimidation.
 On February 1 came the turning point in the strike. General Motors
 had taken the offensive, and the union had suffered defeats in Ander-
 son, Indiana, and Saginaw, Michigan. Hearings on another applica-
tion for an injunction were in progress, this time before Judge Ga-
dola. The Flint Alliance was becoming dangerous, and there was some
fear that the back-to~work movement inspired by the company might
spread. Something had to be done to bolster morale. The union had
again to take the offensive.

The Chevrolet plant in Flint, the scene of discrimination against
union members provided the opportunity. Of most strategic import.-
ance was plant N o. 4, in which all Chevrolet motors are assembled. A

. hundred feet from this plant, however, was the personnel building,

headquarters of company police and hired gunmen. The strategy deci-
dedaupon was to make a sham attack upon plant No. 9, in the far cor-
ner of the tract. At 3 :30 p. m. a sit-down‘ started there, and the excite-
ment brought the company police on the run. At 3:35 the union men
in plant No. 6, starting to N o. 9 to help, were instead directed by union
leaders in the sound truck into No. 4:, where a sit-down simultaneously
began. The Company police arrived too late, and the union‘ was in
control of the key plant, without which no production was possible.
The Women’s Emergency Brigade, made up of _wives,, mothers and
sisters of the strikers, played a heroic and important part in the battle,
both at No. 9 and No. 4:. They smashed windows of the plant to keep
the men from being suffocated by tear gas, and with locked arms bar-
red the police attack upon the main gate of No. 4.

On the following day Judge Gadola issued the injunction requested
by the company. Though not a stockholder, as Judge Black had been,
he proved himself just as willing a servant. His injunction, similar in
many ways to that issued by Judge Black a month before, was much
more drastic. It ordered the union officers and the sit—downers, under
penalty of $15,000,000 to evacuate the plants by 3 p.m. the following
day, and to refrain from picketing and from interfering with the oper-
ation of the plants or the entry of strikebreakers. The sheriff was
ordered to evacuate the plants within 24 hours. Again the strikers re—
fused to budge, and the judge ordered them all arrested. Sheriff Wol-
cott, explaining that he lacked a suﬂicient number of deputies, refused
to carry out the order unless Governor Murphy provided the aid of
the National Guard.

Meanwhile sit-downers within Fisher Body plant No. 2 and Chev-
rolet No. 4: were in a virtual state of siege. National Guardsmen sur~
rounded the plants, and refused to allow friends and relatives to speak
to the men at the factory gates. A hunger siege at ﬁrst imposed byuthe
Guardsmen was lifted in less than a day. Reporters who tried to speak
to the strikers at the gates were escorted out of the military zone at
the point of bayonets. At Fisher No. 1, on the contrary, the strikers

24:

 

 

 

were able to receive visitors and come and go as they pleased, under
no restrictions except those imposed by their own shop council.

The stumbling block to peaceful settlement of the strike remained
the issue of recognition. The union, which ﬁrst asked recognition as
sole bargaining agent for all General Motors employees, later sur-
rendered that claim and asked merely to be sole bargaining agent in 20
plants closed by the strike. The union proposed that, if this was agreed
upon, all plants immediately resume operations, and all other points
at issue he settled in conference. This the company likewise refused.
Company spokesmen favored a plebiscite to determine the wishes of
the men, but refused to recognize the union as sole bargaining agent
in those plants where it might win a majority.

Finally, on February 11, an agreement was reached and the strike
ended. Much o-f the credit for its settlement without further bloodshed
belonged to Governor Murphy, who proved a skillful and patient
mediator. Under the agreement the United Automobile Workers was
recognized as bargaining agent for its members, and the company
agreed not to bargain on matters of general corporate policy with any
other group from 20 struck plants without the governor’s sanction.
There was to be no discrimination against union men, and all court
proceedings were to be dropped. Collective bargaining negotiations

were to begin on February 16. The union, on its part, was to evacuate '

the occupied plants, refrain from recruiting on" company property,

and exhaust every possibility of negotiating before calling any other ’

strike. At the same time the company announced an increase in the
average wage rate of ﬁve cents an hour, swelling its normal annual
wage bill by $25,000,000.

 The strikers hailed the settlement as a signal victory for them. For
the ﬁrst time the giant General Motors Corporation had been fought
to a stand-still by its workers, and forced to engage in collective bar-
gaining with them. After 44: days the sit—downers marched out of the
plant, heads and spirits high, singing “Solidarity Forever.” Out they
came, two by two, with a large American ﬂag at the head of the proces-
sion, to thevcheers of 2,000 sympathizers assembled at the plants.

Other Sit—Doums

Akron, Detroit, and Flint were not the only cities to witness“'the
sit-down strike in the United States. Late in 1936 and early in

25

E37, as its popularity increased, it was employed by many other

groups of workers. Automobile workers in many cities, notab1yTo— A

ledo, South Bend, and Kansas City, have used the sit—down technique.
Glass workers in Illinois, W.P.A. workers in New York City‘ and
Chicago, bakers in Detroit, rubber workers in Illinois and Mary-
land, building service workers in New York City, and motion pic-
ture_ extras in California have used the same method. Other com-
panies to experi-ence sit-down tactics on the part of their workers in-
clude the Aluminum Company of America in its Detroit plant, the
American Casting Company of Birmingham, the Briggs Manufactur-
ing Company of Detroit, the United Wall Paper Company of J oliet,
and the Wahl—Eversharp Pen Company of Chicago. Even a daily
paper, the Detroit News, has experienced a sit—down strike, in" this
case, of its printing pressmen. A chain of retail tireshops in Chicago
has also witnessed a sit—down. Submarine builders, aircraft workers,
and motion picture operators are others to use the sit-down technique.
Salesgirls employed by F. W. Woolworth sat down in Detroit.

There are other instances too numerous to mention.

Even hospital workers have used the sit—down strike. Early in Feb-
ruary, 1937, maintenance and service employees in a Brooklyn hospi-
tal engaged in a sit—down, demanding $15 a month for the cost of liv-
ing outside. They continued to serve and feed the patients, but refused

to serve doctors and nurses. Fifteen workers in the hospital laundry
barricaded themselves Within it to prevent its further use. After two
days a compromise settlement was reached.

What are the causes of sit-down strikes? The same grievances that
cause other strikes. Wages, hours, working conditions, discrimination,
speed—up, lay-oﬁ"s, espionage—all of these have played a part. Some
unusual grievances have likewise caused sit-down protests. Akron
rubber workers sat down when their union president, Sherman H.
Dalrymple, was ‘beaten in Gadsden, Alabama, by thugs employed by
the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. The Bendix employees in
South Bend werearoused by favoritism to company union members
and anti-union propaganda by company union leaders. Goodrich
workers in Akron have sat down to force the removal of non—union
workers. Hollywood extras sat down because casting directors were
hiring society xrirls at low wages. Employees of the Brownhill-Kramer

C26

 Hosiery Company of Philadelphia sat downito prevent removal of the

machinery ‘and moving’ of the business to non-union territory. ‘Every

type of grievance has produced its quota of sit-downs. ‘

The Sit-Down As a Union Tactic _

.» The sit-down strike ha-s gained such popularity in a short time, not
only because it is novel, but also because it possesses distinct advan-
tages over the walk-out strike from the point of view of eifective tac-
tics. If a strike is to be Won it is essential that the plant not be operated.
Even if production is low or non—existent, the appearance of operation
has a disturbing effect upon the strikers’ morale. How can Workers
make more certain that the plant will not operate than by remaining
in physical possession?

In a Walk-out strike a picket line is maintained to keep strikebreak-
ers out of the plant. Often they succeed in entering, especially where
police furnish assistance or the employer hires strong-arm men from
a strikebreaking agency. Strikebreakers cannot enter a plant held by
sit—doWners, however, until the strikers areejected. That is no easy
matter for they occupy a strong defensive position behind the fac-
tory Walls. Out on the streets the police, with their armament and dis-
cipline, have obvious advantages. Mounted police may scatter a picket
line in a single charge. Even tear gas may be ineffective against sit-
downers, as the Fansteel Metallurgical Corporation workers proved.
When deputies hurled tear gas bombs into their North Chicago plant,
the strikers turned on the ventilating apparatus, and the spread of the
gas Was checked. It was the deputies themselves who were most affected
bythe gas. K

If violence occurs in an attack on sit-downers, it is obviously the
employer and his police allies who are directly responsible for it. Such
attacks will affect public opinion, and may hurt the employer’s stand-
ing with the buying public. It is of no value to the employer to eject the
strikers if by so doing he loses public sympathy. If a ﬁght occurs on
the picket lines, on the other hand, it is easy for the employer to charge
that attacks by pickets on strikebreakers were the cause. A bitter
struggle Within the plant, moreover, may result in damage to valuable

machinery.

Morale is more easily maintained in a sit-down strike. The strikers
acquire greater conﬁdence in their own strength, and are more eﬂ’ec—

tively welded into a militant and determined force. Outside inﬂuences
that might have a weakening effect upon morale are excluded. An in-
junction may instill fear or doubt in pickets, and so weaken their
picket line; but sit-downers, injunction or no injunction, still remain
in physical possession of the plant. Nor need the workers fear that %the
machinery will be moved, and the work performed elsewhere. Besides, it
is far more pleasant to be in the plant than tramping the streets, ex-
posed to rain, snow, sleet, wind, and extremities of temperature. Time

' need not drag too heavily, for there is much work to be done, and sit-
. downers have been resourceful in obtaining or inventing means of re-

creation. Even boredom in comparative comfort and security is to be
preferred to picketing in rain or slush, in constant danger of attack.

The sit-down strike may be employed in any industry, but its great-
est effectiveness is in mass production plants with minute division of
labor and a conveyor or moving bolt system of production. So highly
are such plants integrated that a break anywhere in the chain of pro-
duction stops the entire plant. Other industries, as diversiﬁed as ship-
ping and department stores, have witnessed its successful use. That
sit-downers may have an important inﬂuence on legislation as well as
on agreements with the employer is demonstrated by the French ex-
perience. '

Not all plants are so situated as to permit a successful sit-down
strike. Certain big steel mills, for example, are built on large tracts of
company property, entirely surrounded by steel fences. The buildings
may be located as far as a mile and a half from the gates. The sit-
down is most apt to be successful in a plant with windows opening
on a street. It is then possible for the strikers to receive food and
messages from their friends outside, even though company or city
police win control of the outside door or gates. In Flint, when
the National Guard surrounded the plant and for a time barred the
entry of food, the union threatened to drop provisions to the besieged
men from a plane. If the plant is situated some distance from the street,
the sit-downers may ﬁnd themselves besieged, without means of com-
municating with the outside world or obtaining food. For this reason,
among others, a sit-down strike is best reinforced with a strong picket
line around the plant. Diﬂiculties of feeding or sleeping or the lack of
sanitary facilities, moreover, may make it inadvisable to keep all the
strikers within the plant. Sometimes outside "picketing cannot prevent

vuﬁ

28

the entry of strikebreakers, because a railroad runs directly into the
company’s plant. This was true in the case of the Electric Storage
Battery Company of Philadelphia. In such cases the sit-down is the
only effective form of strike, and the Electric Storage Battery work-
ers were among the early users of that method.

The sit-down may be spontaneous or planned. If planned in advance,
the exact time must be kept a secret until the moment of action, for
otherwise the employer will learn of it, the plant will be shut, and the
workers not allowed in. Many sit-downs have” started directly after
lunch. The workers may have suffered some grievance in the morning,
and have had their ﬁrst opportunity to consult with each other during
the lunch period. Short, spontaneous sit-down strikes, to which the
name of “quickies” has been attached, are especially important in
ﬁghting speed-up and building an organization.

Sit-down strikers merely wish to make certain that the plant will
not operate during the strike, or that machinery will not be moved.
Had General Motors promised this in Flint, the plants would have
been evacuated at once. The refusal of the company to make the
promise convinced the workers that plans for operation or removal
had been made. In the Bendix strike in South Bend, the strikers eva-
cuated on the company’s agreement to negotiate, and within two days
an agreement was reached. 

In some instances the sit-down method may lead to abuse, with a
handful of workers stopping a huge plant because of a petty grievance.
This is not likely to happen where proper machinery for settling griev-
ances is set up, and so operated that the workers acquire conﬁdence in
it. A few workers can stop production only where large numbers are
ready to support them. Union members soon learn to act as disciplined
unionists, utilizing machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes,
and resorting to strikes of any variety only after other methods have
proven fruitless.

Employers are beginning to turn their attention to building up de-
fenses against the sit-down technique. According to one newspaper
reporter who was in Flint during the General Motors strike, it has been
proposed that manufacturing plants be built like fortresses or peni-
tentiaries, with walls, pill—boxes, guardhouses, sentries, and impregn-
able gates. Remote control of power, light, and water would be install-
ed, so that the section of the plant seized could be deprived of these

29

- .- facilities. Entrances and exits would be controlled so that food sup-
plie could be cut off and the sit—down strikers starved out.‘ After the
General Motors sit—down began, it is interesting to no-te, Ford builta
double fence around his River Rouge plant, with heavy steel drop
gates on the main driveways. All street car and automobile approaches
to this plant are on company land, and it comes as near to being a fort-
ress as almost any other industrial establishment in America.

Thus far the sit—down has been used, for the most part, by the unions
affiliated with the Committee for Industrial Organization. The execu-
tive council of the American Federation of Labor in February, 1937,
ordered an investigation of the new technique. Until the study has been
completed, the Federation will withhold comment on the legality or
desirability of the sit—down.

Keeping Comfortable

Sit-downers have had a host of new problems to solve, not the least
of which have been living in factory buildings. Food, sleeping quarters,
and sanitation are matters that must be properly attended to if morale
is to be kept up and health maintained for long. The necessary work
must be done, and facilities for recreation provided. In all of these
respects our experience with sit—downs, brief though it has been, is il-
luminating. A

With hundreds or perhaps several thousands of sit-downers in a
plant, the problem of food becomes urgent. The union must assume
responsibility for seeing that the workers receive three meals a day.
This is a severe strain on the union treasury, but thus far adequate

‘meals have been furnished. Indeed, in some strikes most of the sit-

in many sit-down strikes is the chiseling committee, which seeks dona-
tions from food merchants. It calls for resourcefulness when the com-
mittee is unable to obtain the food for the menu as planned, and the
cook must prepare whatever is brought back. The Midland Steel Prod-
ucts Company sit-downers in Detroit were aided by a daily donation of
30 gallons of milk by the milk -drivers’ union. Often the meals furnished
by the union are supplemented by food brought to individual strikers"
by their families or friends.

30

downers have gained Weight. One of the most important committees I

Usually the food is cooked in a nearby hall‘ or restaurant, -and
brought in milk cans, kettles, or other large containers to the plant.
In the case of the Wahl-Eversharp Pen Company of Chicago, police
refused to allow friends of the strikers to bring food into the plant.
The sit-downers ‘then lowered .a rope from an upper window to the

roof of an adjoining bakery, and obtained food in\this fashion. The '

menu of sit-downers is usually simple, but adequate. Barrels, kegs, and
whatever else is suitable are used for chairs, and tables are likewise
improvised. Newspapers sometimes serve as tablecloths. Liquor is
strictly forbidden. l

Usually the cooking is done by a committee of the strikers’ wives. In
large strikes, however, a professional cook may be obtained. The cook
in the Flint strike, for example, was sent there to help by the Cooks’
Union of Detroit. He had previously cooked for four other sit-down
strikes. For the Flint strike the union installed new kitchen equipment
worth more than $1,000..

“The food goes into the factories in twenty kettles of various sizes,”
the cook reported. “The amount of food the strikers use is immense.
Five hundred pounds of meat, one thousand pounds of potatoes, three
hundred loaves of bread, one hundred pounds of coffee, two hundred
pounds of sugar, thirty gallons of fresh milk, four cases of evaporated
milk !”‘

“In Detroit a cooperative kitchen was established to feed 800 sit-
down strikers in the Bohn Aluminum, Cadillac, and Fleetwood plants:

The kitchen runs on eﬂicient lines, not speed-up, in two shifts. About 50 men
and women comprise the working crew; the ﬁrst shift working from 7:00
until 2:00 in the afternoon, the second from 11:00 in the morning until 6:00 in
the afternoon. Everyone attends the meeting held at 2:00 o’clock daily at I.A.S.

Hall where the various committees make their reports. There is the kitchen»

committee, which takes care of preparing the food, with a chef from the Cooks’
Union, Local No. 234, to supervise the preparation of it. Then there is a ﬁnance
committee, with two treasurers, working in shifts, one from the Cadillac plant
and one from the Bohn Aluminum plant.’

Other important committees were the drivers’ committee, which
delivered the food, and the chiseling committee, which covered the city
for donations of food or money. About two—thirds of the supplies were
obtained in this fashion.

One of the important problems is to obtain comfortable sleeping
quarters. Sit-down strikers in an automobile body or ﬁnal assembly

plant are fortunate in this regard, for they may sleep on the ﬂoor of
the cars, removing the seats if necessary or arranging the seats be-
tween the conveyor lines. In the Midland steel plant some of the men
tied burlap to machines, and so riggedlup cots. Elsewhere tables have
been made to serve. Sometimes cots have been brought to the plantspby
friends, and usually all have obtained blankets after the first night.

for automobile seats. Their houses were in two rows, one labeled “Union
Street” and the other “Cotton Street.”

ness of the men and the tidy appearance of the plants. One of the im-
portant jobs is to see that the factories are kept clean. The machinery
is kept in good order, for the sit-downers wish to return to work as
soon as possible after the strike ends. Often a former barber is found
among the strikers, and he is made to resume his old trade. In the Kel-
sey—Hayes plant a wheelbarrow on a platform served as a barber chair.
In one sit—down strike where there were women employees, a beauty
parlor was opened for them by a former worker in such an establish-
ment. Washing is often a problem, however, for in most plants only
ordinary washbowls are available. One sit-down, in the Detroit plant
of the Aluminum Company of America, had to be transformed into a
Walk—out because a number of the men became ill and lack of sulﬁ-
cient sanitary facilities made further stay in the plant hazardous to
health.

Obeyéng the Rules

A certain amount of work is required, for meals must be served, the
place kept clean, a watch kept, and discipline maintained. For recrea-
tion the men play cards, listen to the radio, or provide their own en-
tertainment program. There are dancers, singers, and musicians in
every large group, and often an orchestra can be formed. Frequently
the sit-downers write songs about their own strikes. A bowling alley
was set up in one plant, and horse shoes pitched in others. Basket-b-all
courts have been improvised, hockey games played, and boxing and
wrestling matches promoted. Where the company has provided a re-
creation room, with ping-pong tables and other games‘, these facilities
are used to the utmost.

32

Most visitors to sit—down strikes have been impressed by the neat— —

Those who are studiously inclined may prefer to read. The educa-
tional director of the United Automobile Workers has organized regu-
lar classes for the sit—downers, with parliamentary procedure, public
speaking, and trade unionism among the popular subjects. Even
where no formal classes are organized the sit—down has considerable
educational value, for the workers must set up their own community
government, and solve the many problems that arise. In some cases
church services have been held regularly. Loud speaker systems are
rigged up, so that announcements made at the gate or in the nearby
union oﬁice may be heard by all. Pep speeches are made in the same
manner, and entertainment is similarly broadcast. Often the sit—down-
ers amuse themselves, at the very start of the strike, by hanging up the
“No Help Wanted” sign.

Where both men and women are employed, the sit—downers must be
extremely careful to avoid the charge of immorality. Usually the
women have been-sent home, partly for this reason and partly because

i the hardships were more difﬁcult for them. Often the married women

had to leave in any event, because of their family responsibilities.
Where women have stayed in the plant, strict chaperonage rules have
been established. In the Kelsey-Hayes strike the girls were not per-
mitted to leave their dormitory after 11 p. m. The sit—downers asked
that two of the regular plant matrons be placed in charge of the

women’s dormitory, and this request was complied with. The girls in .

this strike were not permitted to go through a dark tunnel that con-
nected two buildings. Sit-down strikers of the Brownhill—Kramer Hos-
iery Company of Philadelphia included both men and women. The lat-
ter entered the factory each morning at 8 and stayed until 6 p.m., and
only the men remained in the plant all night. Most sit—downers have
not permitted women to enter the buildings at all. In several cases,
however, the overwhelming majority of the sit—down strikers have been
women. This was true, for example, in the cigar plant of Webster-
Eisenlohr, Inc., of Detroit. “This is a woman’s sit-down,” said one of
the strikers. “The men are just around—that’s all.”

Discipline and morale are of vital importance. Those who- do not
conform to the rules may be sentenced to extra clean-up duty for minor
oﬁenses, and ejected for serious violations. In the General Motors
strike in Flint, court was held each morning, with bringing in liquor

33

and circulating rumors the most frequent offenses. Elsewhere it may
be overstaying leaves that is most frequently punished. In the Stand-
ard Cotton Products Company strike in Flint the judge himself was
twice convicted of breaking the rules, and had to do extra dish washing
as the penalty. Sometimes foremen and other company oﬂicials are al-
lowed to converse only with union officers, for fear that they may ad-
versely aﬂ'ect the strikers’ morale. In some instances subterfuges have
been employed by strikers or their wives in order to get out of the

plant. Serious illness has been reported at home, or a birth in the fam— D,

ily. Where too many such cases seemed to be reported a check was
made, and the member immediately dropped. In some cases foremen
have visited wives of sit—downers, making false reports of illness or
hardships within the plant, in order to break down morale.

Except when trouble is feared, sit-downers are usually permitted to it

leave the plant for short intervals, under rules that they decide upon.
In most cases they are required to return by a speciﬁed hour, and a
check is made as they go and come. If an outside picket line is main-
tained as well, the strikers take turns staying within the plant. In one
case a sit—downer who belonged to the National Guard was released for
strike duty with the Guard.

Visitors are admitted only after a carful check of their credentials.
Usually a pass signed by a responsible union oﬂicer is required. In
many plants everyone who enters must submit to a search for weapons,
and a similar search is made of all who leave. A communications sy-
stem calls to the gate those who have visitors. A post oﬂice is some-
times set up to handle the mail, which may be censored. Gates and
doors are often barricaded against a surprise attack, with guards on
duty at all times. In Flint, sentries, in six—hour watches were_ on duty
twenty-four hours a day, with an alarm system to warn quickly of
impending danger. Sometimes metal strips are welded across doorways
and windows, to make police entry more difficult, and to provide pro-
tection from gas bombs and bullets. In some plants pickets assigned to
make the rounds have had to punch the time clock as they went on or
off duty.

Heat, light, and water are important to the health and comfort of
the strikers. Usually the companies have permitted these services to
be maintained. The cutting oﬁ” of these facilities has precipitated some

34:

of the most bitter battles yet fought by sit-downers. In some instances
the employer has alternately turned the heat off and on.

Race relations may be another problem faced by sit-downers. In
the Midland plant in Detroit both whites and negroes were employed.
Workers of both races occupied the plant, and worked together in
harmony throughout the strike.

In Flint-an amusing episode occured while the sit-downers were in
possession of the plants. Chevrolet plant N o. 4 had just been seized
and considerable disorder had occurred. Following the seizure every-
thing was peaceful, and the many camera men on the scene had little
to do. They therefore engaged in a baseball game, with the still, camera
men playing the movie camera operators. The umpires were several
hundred sit-downers on the roof of plant No. 4, and the spectators
were the National Guardsmen on duty. One team, displeased with a
decision, sat down on the ball ﬁeld, and promptly won a reversal, amid
cheers, from the union umpires. Several innings later the other team
was similarly dissatisﬁed. Its tactics were to sing “Solidarity For-
ever ;” and the umpires, after joining in the song, again reversed the
decision.

’ Marching out of a plant when the strike has been won or a truce ar-
ranged offers opportunity for a colorful demonstration, as in Flint.
The Bendix strikers marched out in military order, headed by their
own drum and bugle corps, and paraded to the union hall. After the
settlement proposals had been adopted, the strikers paraded through
the business section of South Bend, headed by the effigy of the Bendix
company union hanging on a long pole. I

A Typical Set of Rules

Sit-downers must govern their community, and solve each problem
as it arises. Fundamentally these problems are similar, though new
situations will arise in each plant. The rules adopted by the sit—down
strikers in the Standard Cotton Products Company in Flint, Michi-
gan, may be taken as fairly typical. With fewer than a hundred strik-
ers, they were able to transact business in afull meeting held at 10
o’clock each morning, without the more complex and elaborate organi-
zation that a large plant would require. A strike committee of ﬁve mem-
bers was placed in charge. Other oﬁicers included a chairman, a sec-

35

retary, a judge, a press agent, and three clerks. There was a patrol
committee of two, a food committee of two, a clean-up committee of
three, and an entertainment committee of one. ’ l

Posted on the wall of the mess hall were the following rules, which
were added to from time to time by majority vote:

RULES AND REGULATIONS
Rule No. 1. Any man who disturbs anyone while sleeping without good _reason

Unquestionably most judges will hold the sit-down s/trike illegal, ‘

under the law of trespass. The fact that the law of trepass was develop-
ed in a different social situation will be of no avail. Yet labor need not

L be unduly disturbed, for most weapons used by it were first held il-

legal. That was true both of the strike and the boycott. Indeed strikes
for certain purposes are still held illegal in many states, "and the sec-
ondary boycott is also outlawed. Picketing is prohibited in many in-
junctions, including those issued by Judges Black and Gadola in Flint.
The continued use of a logical weapon, backed by enough economic and
political pressure, eventually results in its being held legal. If lobbying
by labor does not force old-party legislators to declare the sit-down
legal, the foundation of an independent party of labor will accomp-

' lish that end. Workers should concentrate on defeating the employer,

and not be too much concerned about a law that is framed largely in
the interests of employers and owners.

L Attacks upon the sit-down strike have already ‘begun, and many
more may be expected. Governor’ Hoffman of New Jersey, for example,
has warned that the entire resources of the state, if necessary, would
be used to eject sit—downers. In his view, wo-rkers have no moreright
to take possession of a factory than gangsters have to take possession
of a bank. Early in 1937, legislation to outlaw the sit-down strike
was being considered in Alabama and Vermont. New York City police
at first refused to intervene against sit-downers. In February, 1937,
however, more stringent rules were put in force, under which strikers
will be ejected and arrested if a formal complaint is made by the
owner of a plant. In the absence of such complaint the police will
not interfere, so long as the strikers are orderly. Much more liberal
is the attitude of Secretary of Labor Perkins, who has expressed
doubt as to whether sit-downers violate any law.

Wyndham Mortimer, vice-president of the United Automobile I

Workers, has thus stated the case for the sit-down strike:
Is it wrong for a worker to stay at his job? The laws of the state and nation

‘recognize, in a hundred waysgthat the worker has a deﬁnite claim upon his

job; more fundamentally, it is recognized that every workman has a moral right
to continue on his job unless some deﬁnite misconduct justiﬁes his discharge.
These sit-down strikers are staying at their work-places; no one has a better
right to be there than have these men themselves. No one else, certainly, has any
right to those positions. But the sit-down strikers have performed valuable

services in those factories; General Motors and the public alike have proﬁted by
those services. To call them trespassers now, and to deny their right as human
beings to remain with their jobs, is logically unsound and is manifestly unjust.’

The union asserts that the workers have a property right in their
jobs which is superior to the company’s right to the use of the prop-
erty. This theory will be rejected by most judges today, but in time
it may be accepted as good law. The legal concept of property rights
has changed and developed with usage. In Flint the union also argued
that General Motors was not entitled to an injunction on the ground
that it had itself violated the laws relating to collective bargaining,
and therefore did not come into court with clean hands. Judge Gadola
rejected this theory, though other judges have applied this general
principle of equity to labor injunction cases.’ Gadola did not justify
General Motors’ actions, but merely asked whether one wrong could
be righted by another wrong. This attitude is contrary to the prin-
ciples of equity.

The sit-down strike has served notice on society that mere owner-
ship does not carry with it all possible rights with reference to a fac-
tory. Those Who work in it, who make it produce with their labor and
who depend upon it for their livelihood, should likewise have a voice in
its control. Those who invest their lives in an industry have at least as
much at stake as those who merely invest their money. The sit-down
strike, brings these facts forcibly to public attention. It is interesting
to note that, in the sit-down strike, workers are re—establishing the
control over the tools of production that they lost with the Industrial
Revolution.

The ethical case for the sit-down strike has well been presented by
Rabbi Edward L. Israel, former chairman of the Social Justice Com-
mission of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. The problem
involved, Rabbi Israel asserts, is one of the comparative emphasis of
human rights over against property rights. The entire struggle of the
human race from bondage toward freedom, he points out, has been
a constant battling against vested interests.

The ethical issue in the sit-down strike concerns itself with the right of an
employee to his job. According to the average standard of wages in industry
today, practically every working family is only a few days removed from
starvation. We must therefore ask ourselves whether the right of hiring and
ﬁring, at a time when jobs are at a premium, can possibly be construed to be
surrounded by such absolutistic and unassailable property prerogatives that it

38

1 can literally place within the hands of an employer the power of life and death

over the men who work for him. ‘

No social conscience will grant any man such a right. By the same token, the .

worker has certain rights in his job. If he feels that collective bargaining
through a national labor union is necessary for the preservation of those rights,
he is deﬁnitely entitled to pursue such orderly methods as may force the em-
ployer to meet with his representatives in collective bargaining.’

The argument that a Worker has a property right in his job has

thus been stated by Homer Martin, president of the automobile Work-

ers union:

What more sacred property right is there in the world than the right of a
man in his job? This property right involves the right to support his family,
feed his children and keep starvation away from the door. This property right
is the very foundation stone of American homes. It is the most sacred, most
fundamental property right in America. It means more to the stabilization of
American life, morally, socially and economically, than any other property right.

Sit-down strikes, like other types of strikes, occur when long-
standing grievances of workers have brought them to the breaking
point. Those employers who recognize unions and deal with them fairly
need have little fear of sit—downs. If all employers recognized the right
of workers to organize and bargain collectively, and obtain a fair
share of the fruits of industry, few strikes would occur. If, when a
strike occurred, the employer made no effort to operate with strike-
breakers, there would be no need for a seizure of the plant. Employers
will make more progress by removing the just grievances of workers
than by attacking them on the basis of property laws framed in an
earlier social situation, and designed for other purposes.

The sit-down strike is here to stay. Of that workers are resolved.
The law may change slowly, but change it must.

A G. M. STOCKHOLDER VISl1'S FL|NT*

BY ROBERT MORSS LOVETT
O

‘ s THE owner of a few shares of the General Motors Corporation
‘  I became somewhat alarmed when I learned that the workers

were sitting down in my plants at Flint, Fisher Body No. 1

and Fisher Body No. 2, preventing the company from ﬁnishing and .

shippings cars and threatening to interrupt the orderly ﬂow of divi-
dends. Accordingly I took Sunday for a visit of investigation. Arriv-
ing at Flint I went to Fisher 2, and on introducing myself as their
employer was cordially received by some 400 men occupying the plant.
I must admit that I was fortunate in having as my companion Adolf
Germer, who is on the board of strategy directing the strike.

My ﬁrst anxiety was for the condition of my property, and I was
relieved to ﬁnd it well cared for. Springs and cushions were being used
for beds, it is true, sometimes laid side by side as in a dormitory, some-
times isolated in cubicles between bales of goods. I was glad to see cer-
tain marks of domesticity—a clothes tree, an alarm clock, a whisk
broom. The boys had made themselves pretty comfortable. I asked
who was responsible for cleanliness, order, and protection of property,
and learned that the government was what might be described, ex-
cept for its unfortunate connotation, as a soviet. Mass assemblies
were called at frequent intervals at which everything of importance
was discussed. Court was held every morning. I asked what crimes
were co-mmittedwand was told that bringing in liquor and circulating
rumors were the usual offenses. Those found guilty of the charges
against them were put out.

After a hearty Sunday dinner of roast chicken and ice cream, I was
preparing to go over to Fisher 1 when I noticed several round holes
in the great glass windows, and inspecting more closely some of the
foetus—like bodies of cars on the tracks, awaiting their delayed birth,
I saw similar holes in the glass and dents in the metal sides. I thought
these indicated wanton violence against my property, and asked how
it occurred. Gun fire by the police, was the answer. I knew that there
had been ﬁghting on the Monday before in the street outside, but these

disasters were on the second ﬂoor. It was obvious that there had been
ﬁring from a distance into the plant, endangering the lives of my em-
ployees,whom I was beginning to like though they were on strike, and
damaging my property. Accordingly I asked for particulars, and as
I have seen no clear account of the affair in any newspaper, despite
the columns of newsprint that have been given to the strike, I will set
down the facts as they were related to me by at least eight partici-
pants and eyewitnesses. A _

The sitdown strike involving 1,500 to 2,000 workers started at
Fisher 1, when it appeared that the management was loading dies and
special machinery into box cars to be shifted to other cities. Our com-
pany is fortunate in having factories scattered over the country; so
thatby transferring equipment a strike in Flint, Michigan, can be
broken by workers in Atlanta, Georgia. Incidentally, that is why the
workers demand the industrial form of organization and insist on
dealing with General Motors as a whole instead of with the component
companies. _

The sitdown strike spread to Fisher Body 2, where from 400 to 600
men were involved. Relations were harmonious with the company pol-
ice, who agreed to let the outer door stand open for food to be brought
in. Attempts were made from time to time to shut off heat, light, and
water, but workers with a mechanical turn of mind turned them on
again. 1

On Monday afternoon V the city police under Chief James Wills
undertook to block both ends of the street in front of Fisher 2, to
prevent food from being brought in. Later the police made an attack
in force with tear gas and gun ﬁre, to enter the plant. The strikers
from inside countered the tear gas with streams of water, and the
bullets with heavy hinges and other missiles. Some twenty-eight per-
sons were injured, fourteen so seriously as to be taken to the hospital,
which, I was told, had received warning beforehand to have an emer-
gency ward ready. The defeat of the forces of law and order is referred
to as Bulls’ Run. The company police of Fisher 2 apparently took no
part in the battle, and were found next morning in a ladies’ rest room,
where they had stood all night at attention, lacking room to sit down.
They were released without acrimony by the workers in the factory.

Leaving Fisher 2, I went over to Fisher 1. After the battle, through
Governor Murphy’s efforts, the strikers and the management of Gen-

4

 

 

eral Motors had been brought to an agreement to go into conference

on Monday, January 18,. the workers to evacuate the Fisher plants _

on the promise that the company would not move machinery ordies.
They were to marchvout of Fisher 1 at one—thirty, and a big crowd
was collecting outside to see the evacuation. In the long facade of
Fisher 1, which stretched away, it seemed, for half a mile into the
foggy distance, no doors were open, and I had to go in by a window;
but once inside I found the boys were good—natured and, when they
realized that I was their employer, ﬂatteringly eager for my auto-
graph. Suddenly a loud—speaker blared forth. It seemed that the Gen-
eral Motors management had agreed to negotiate also with the Flint
Alliance, and this was regarded as a breach of faith by the board of
strategy of the United Automobile Workers of America, since the
question whether the U. A. W. A. should be the sole bargaining agency
was one of the points to be negotiated. Accordingly orders were given
to hold the plant, the sitdown strike to continue until negotiations
were ﬁnally complete. The crowd surged back to Fisher 1, where an
impromptu outdoor meeting was held to protest against the action
of the company. .

The agreement of the company oﬂicials to admit the Flint Alliance‘

to the discussion was a highly provocative action and was deprecated
as such by Governor Murphy. It looked like an attempt of the com-

pany to get out of the negotiation into which it had been persuaded. A

The Flint Alliance is an anti-strike organization mainly of White-
collar workers and their families and various beneﬁciaries of Gen-
eral Motors, directed by George Boysen, ex—mayor of Flint and a
former paymaster of the Buick Company. It is in no sense a labor

union and is detested by the workers. It represents rather the political‘

forces of Flint, which are aligned with General Motors——mayor, pol-
ice, courts. On that Sunday in Flint there was meeting the Michigan

Conference for the Protection of Civil Rights, at which it was forcibly V

pointed out to the workers that they had only to use their ballots to
turn out the whole nest of unclean birds at the next election—defeat
the mayor, ‘move the impeachment of Judge Black for his action in
granting a sweeping injunction against the union and in favor of a
corporation, General Motors, in which he has substantial holdings,
and force the removal of Chief of Police Wills for invoking violence
both savage and futile. i

The General Motors strike of 1937 may prove to be historic inas-
much as it has acclimated the sitdown‘ strike in this country as a
weapon of industrial conﬂict. The right of non-working employees to
occupy the plant can hardly be classed among civil liberties. It is
rather one of the industrial liberties which are on the way to becom-
ing legally recognized. A little over a century ago it was illegal for
workers to combine to refuse work for less than a certain sum. Quite
recently it was against the law to picket a struck plant. Today picket-
ing is among the civil rights. Already intelligent governors are apply-
ing the rule of reason and common sense to situations which law has
not reached in its majestic progress. Governor Earle of Pennsylvania
has refused to order the state troops to dispossess the bootleg miners,
who are taking coal from seams which are their natural source of live-
lihood, which the legal owners refuse to work. Governor Murphy has
refused to use his militia to throw out the sitdown strikers in the Gen-
eral Motors plants, and has ordered the company to cease the effort
to cut off heat, light, and water. I

The sitdown is the most effective form of strike. It permits the
strikers to remain in comfort, even if somewhat bored, instead of
tramping about on the picket line in heat, cold, wind, and wet. It
obviates the most unpleasant and demoralizing feature of a strike, the
use of strike—breakers. It eliminates violence, or at least places respon-
sibility for it squarely on the police. It promotes the morale of the
strikers. Above all it is a forcible reminder to workers, to manage-
ment, to shareholders, and to the public that legal title is not the ﬁnal
answer to the question of possession. Who has the better human and
natural right to call the Fisher plant his——I, whose connection with
General Motors is determined by the price recorded on the New York
Stock Exchange, or the worker whose life and livelihood are bound
up in the operation of making cars? I bought my shares at long odds
and probably have already collected the purchase price in dividends.
When I place a winning bet in a horse race I do not claim a share
in ownership of the horse. I know from my political economy that
my position is the result of labor and sacriﬁce. VVhose? Not ‘mine.
Obviously the enormous mass of wealth represented by the capitaliza-
tionof General Motors, repeatedly enlarged by split-ups and stock
dividends, is the surplus resulting from the toil of millions of workers
