larly a suspension of the ﬁve-cent-a-barrel tax on the Standard
Oil Company of Louisiana.

Members of the Louisiana Legislature received notice of the
special session early in the afternoon of Tuesday, February 26,
with the Legislature convening that evening at 10 o’clock. Legis-
lators, eager to collect their 10-cent-a-mile expense money and
$10 a day for voting “aye” on Huey Long’s legislation, made a
rush for Baton Rouge, the state capital. That night not a single
room was available in any of the city’s hotels, so crowded were
they with legislators and carpetbaggers seeking favors from the
Long Administration.

HOW BILLS ARE SPEEDED UP

The first session of the Legislature was of a rather routine
character since decidedly few members of that august lawmaking
body knew just what bills they were to vote upon. The titles of
20-odd bills that had.been prepared by Huey Long and his politi-
cal ventriloquists were simply read, and referred to the one and

‘only active committee, the Ways and Means Committee. Although

regular committees of the Legislature are constituted at the open-
ing of each regular session, Huey Long and his political experts
have found that much time and energy is saved by referring all
bills to the Ways and Means Committee.

This all-powerful committee met the following morning on
the tenth floor of the new $5,000,000 capitol, a skyscraper build-
ing with Italian marble walls and dark walnut ﬁnishings. Starving
share-croppers and jobless sugar cane workers can comfort them-
selves in the knowledge that ,the capitol is furnished with inlaid
desks and that a private elevator is available for Huey P. Long
and his army of bodyguards and, when there is room, for ‘Gov-
ernor 0. K. Allen.

Consider the workings of the Ways and Means Committee:
many of the members do not even trouble to obtain copies of
the printed bill. The two lone members of the opposition in the
committee scurry around in a frantic effort to acquaint them-
selves with the measures. Huey P. Long, who holds no oﬁicial
position in the State of Louisiana, presides over the committee.
Ostensibly he is “discussing” the measures, a privilege which, ac-
cording to Louisiana law, every citizen has. Sit in the committee

room for a few minutes, however, and you will see that Long is
10

 

 

not merely “discussing” the bills, he is ordering them adopted.

The committee voted favorable action on 20-odd bills in the
course of a few hours. Huey is experienced in the game and it
didn’t take him long to “explain” each bill, particularly since the
majority of the committee showed no curiosity about the nature
of the measures, and were all for speed.

"IT'S A FINE BILL." SAYS THE KINGFISH

“This is a fine bill,” Long explains. “The building loan so-
cieties have asked for this bill.” Jack Williamson, 23-year-old
anti-Long representative on the committee wants more details.
Huey turns to George Wallace, assistant attorney-‘general of Louis-
iana,” who is considered one‘ of the state’s “brain-trusters”. Wal-
’1acé‘” is standing directly behind Huey’s chair, a bored, jaded-
looking individual. “George’ll explain any of the ﬁne points,”
Huey says condescendingly. “I’m told that this bill,” Huey con-
tinues, “takes out some of the clockwork and gives the hands a
chance to move.” Another minute elapsed and the bill is reported
favorably. And so on through the whole list of 25 bills.

The bill to rebate four cents of the ﬁve-cent Standard Oil tax
hardly took more time. And it was primarily to pass this bill that
the special session was called.

At eight o’clock that night the Legislature meets again. During
the day the bars at the Heidelberg (where Huey Long had re-
served six rooms for himself and his bodyguards) and the other
hotels were doing a land-oﬁice business. No studying of legisla-
tion, no probing into comparative statistics, no need to hunt
citations from the revered statesmen of old. This special session
was merely a prelude to the New Orleans Mardi Gras!

Once in their seats, the legislators are prepared for business.
Many of them, like the Hon. Pat H. McGrath of Orleans parish,
were cock-eyed drunk. McGrath at one point sought to speak from
the microphone and nearly knocked it over.

The clerk of the House supposedly reads the bills, but it is a
weird jumble that is hardly audible. “By Mr. Burke . . . an act
. . to amend . . . and re-enact section 2, 9, 13, sub-paragraph
of section 16 of act 15 of the Third Extra session of 1934, ap-
proved, to levy, to collect, to enforce, to fine, except, by the pro-

vision of, etc.”
11

   

“Is there objection?” asks Allen J. Ellender of Houma and
Terrebonne parishes, Long’s speaker of the House. “Hearing none,
the bill is advanced to third reading.”

Fast work. So it goes for the 25 bills on the floor of the'House,
as in Committee!

The only ripple came when the Standard Oil tax compromise
bill came up. Huey Long’s chief henchman in the House, Ishom
J. Guillery, a lawyer from Landry parish, arose unhappily to
“explain” the bill to a malicious member of the Long opposition.

“This is a very good bill,” Guillery explained. “It was worked
out as a result of a conference between Senator Long and Mr.
Hilton, president of the Standard Oil Company of Louisiana.”
Guillery rambled on about the necessity for adapting oneself to
new. situations, that inasmuch as the President of the United States
has the authority to modify tariff regulations, so should the
Governor of Louisiana have the right to suspend the tax on the
Standard Oil.

“Why didn’t Mr. Hilton come here and speak up for this bill?”
asked a member of the anti-Long forces.

V “The gentleman should know that Mr. Hilton has no rights on
this ﬂoor,” Guillery replied.

“But why didn’t Mr. Hilton appear before the Ways and
Means Committee? There seem to be other non-members of the
Legislature who assume rights there. . . .”

Guillery appears helpless for a moment. “I’m sure,” he says
with disarmingcandor, “the Standard Oil Company is sufficiently
represented on the floor of this House.”

"SIT DOWN |SHOM"

Incidentally, Guillery is the man who is now called “Sit Down
Ishom,” because Huey Long shouted at. him to “shut up and sit
down” whenhe began to talk too indiscreetly at a previous session
of the Legislature. Needless to report, Ishom did shut up and did
sit down.

The Legislature was originally called to last “no more than
10 days”. It convened an a Tuesday night, and by Friday after-
noon 34 bills had passed through the Ways and Means Committee,
had been “discussed” in the Legislature and had been enacted
into law!

12

 

 

“This is the way to run a Legislature.” I overheard the King-
ﬁsh say at the press table on the floor of the House.

Huey Long is making a bold bid for national power in the
hope of superseding Franklin Delano Roosevelt as President of
the United States. In order to accomplish this purpose he is pa-
rading as a champion of the oppressed masses and is holding out
to them the empty promise of “sharing the wealth” of the nation
and ending their poverty.

Stung by Huey Long’s hypocritical attacks upon the New Deal
———whose essence he supports—-the administration has sent out
word that the Louisiana Senator must be scotched. General Hugh
Johnson's vitriolic assault upon the Kingﬁsh only served to em-
phasize that Long’s services were not yet required, because the
demagogy of the New Deal had not yet exhausted its influence.

What Huey P. Long says about the Roosevelt Administration
is true-—but not the whole truth; what the Roosevelt Administra-
tion says about Huey P. Long is true—but not the whole truth!

Each one is attacking the other’s demagogy, but fails to expose
its essence, ‘namely the strengthening of the basic structure of
capitalism. ' .

Long is now offering himself to the American masses-
wracked by ﬁve years of unemployment and hunger—as their
savior, as their King Arthur in their ﬁght against the predatory
beasts of capitalism.

LON€v'S RECORD IHN LOUISIANA

Let the American masses examine Long’s record in his own
Louisiana Kingdom. .

Huey P. Long is the undisputed Dictator of Louisiana. _

He cracks the whip over the entire political life of the state.
What has been done in Louisiana-—-—for good or evil——is his re-
sponsibility.

He has transformed the state into a virtual military dictator-
ship, utilizing the militia to terrorize opponents, to falsify legis-
tration books and to control elections.

Huey P. Long has built up a dummy legislature, completely
subservient to his will.

Governor O. K. Allen is a mere puppet of the Kingﬁsh; he
does not conceal the fact that he is a rubber stamp in his hands.

13’

  

Through his Highway Commission, Dock Board and the State
Board of Equalization which has sweeping tax-assessment power
Long has built up a powerful and ruthless political machine
which has crushed all opposition.

He has enlarged the State Bureau of Criminal Identiﬁcation,
known‘ in Louisiana as “Cossacks”, who have usurped the power
of local police officials.

By a state law he compels the deputy sheriifs of politically-
hostile parishes (counties) like Orleans, East Baton Rouge and
Caddo to obtain the approval of the State Bureau of Criminal
Identiﬁcation before they can take oﬁice.

He has placed the state’s ﬁremen and policemen under his
thumb by authorizing his State Civil Service Commission to pass
on their eligibility. School teachers of the state are placed in
servitude by being subject to the control of the State Board of
Budget Review, a body which Huey P. Long holds in his vest
pocket. ' L

Just as sweeping is a Long-inspired law by which the King-
ﬁsh’s Attorney General is empowered to supersede any district
attorney in the state——all this with the aid of the dummy legis-
lature and rubber-stamp governor.

So does Huey P. Long rule over the destinies of the people of
the state of Louisiana! This is the man who makes the bid for
national power in the Unted States.

General Hugh S. Johnson, who, from his own experiences and
inclination, knows a fascist when he sees one, aptly characterizes
Huey Long as “the Hitler of Louisiana”.

Ill. HOW THE COFFERS ARE FILLED

Income from vice activities provides a large portion of the
revenue for the powerful Huey Long political machine in Louis-
iana.

The Kingﬁsh launched a violent vice “crusade” in New Or-
leans last year, but Mayor Semms T. Walmsley told me in his
oﬂice in City Hall that anybody who pays off Huey operates; any-
body who doesn’t pay off, does not.

“If you want’ to take the trouble to go into St. Bernard and

Jefferson parishes [counties] which are Long strongholds,” the

Mayor continued, “you’ll see the roulette wheels spin and the dice

roll, and they make no bones about it”.
14

 

 

From other sources, too, I learned that the chief purpose of
Huey Long’s\vice. crusade was to cutoff the revenues from the
Old Regulars of the New Orleans Ring with whom he had broken
in -order to crush them and divert the lucre to his own machine.
Today, while the “cribs” (old Red Light district) have been
boarded up, houses of prostitution and gambling joints——though
scattered——operate high, wide and handsome. '

Myron Cassidy, writer for The American Progress, Huey
Long’s monthly, following aninvestigation of the New Orleans
Red Light ‘district, estimated that $2,000,000 was paid out an-
nually out of the earnings of the women in this area into the
political treasuries of the city.

The Kingﬁsh and his gang lusted for this stream of gold.

WALMSLEY GIVES HIS SIDE

“Mr. Mayor,” I asked, “what would you say is the chief point
at issue between yourself and the Long forces?”

“The thing that’s most interesting is the man’s very evident
attempt to crush ruthlessly the city government of New Orleans.
Another thing that sticks in the minds of everyone is his attempt
to control the payrolls. Also, there is his attempt to take over the
city police and ﬁre departments of New Orleans, blocking salary
payments. Huey Long is reported to have made the statement in
his caucus that if he could embarrass us by preventing us from
paying salaries until July, that he’d win the next gubernatorial
election in January.” ;: -

Taking me into his conﬁdence, the Mayor continued: —

“The best proof that the people of Louisiana are in rebellion
is seen in his seizure of additional powers to strengthen his weak-
ening organization. He never would have gone to the lengths he
did in Baton Rouge and New Orleans if .-this were not so. Remem-
ber this, my friend: No politician, no matter how clever or how
bold, ever wants to arouse public opposition. unless it is abso-
lutely unavoidable. Never arouse the -sleeping dogs-. when on top.”

MAYOR aoosrs ‘SQUARE DEAL" caowoul
I asked the mayor how he felt about the Square Deal Associa-
tion. ,  _- .
“Of course I’m not speaking officially and am expressing only
my individual opinion. But as to the Square Deal.I will say this:
15

any group of people working toward the elimination of the evil
inﬂuences now in charge in the State of Louisiana should be wel-
comed.” -V

This made it clear to me that the corrupt old Regulars of New
Orleans have their ﬁngers in this latest manifestation of opposition
to Long.

In response to my question as to how the relief situation is met
in New Orleans, the mayor said “it could be worse,” only 26,000
families, or approximately 120,000 persons being dependent upon
relief. This in a city with a population of 450,000.

“Is the relief adequate, mayor?”

“Of course not. When relief gets to be adequate, it ceases to be
relief. Adequate is a hell of a word in this connection.” In short,
the mayor is against adequate cash relief for the unemployed.

Walmsley was not very speciﬁc about the expenditures‘ on
relief. I therefore decided to call upon Harry J. Early, until re-
cently Emergency Relief Administrator for Louisiana.

“In a- way I’m glad you came to see me,” Early began. “There
was a fellow here from The Nation, and instead of calling on me
he went out in the street and talked to some Communists.”

THE RELIEF SITUATION
Early wasn?t alert with relief. ﬁgures, and he constantly had

to call in his secretary for conﬁrmation. But thismuchl managed‘

to gather:

The total number of families on relief in Louisiana on Febru-
ary 1 was 66,642, more than 350,000 persons, of a total popula-
tion of 2,000,000. Early boasted that the previous year the relief
rolls contained 171,822 cases, three times as large as this year.
The relief administrator would have one believe that “improve-
ment” is a result of absence of need, but a visit to any workers’
section in any part of the state will reveal the most appalling
misery and destitution, particularly in thousands of homes of
workers unable to break through the red-tape machinery set up
by Mr. Early. _ .

For a family of five the average relief is about $24 a month,
but for this the workers must slave in mattress and quilt factories
and the other industrial peonage stations in competition with
those employed at local prevailing rates. '

“There’s not a damn soul starving in this state,"'Early lied to
16

 

 

me. “There is no occasion for anybody to starve unless he locks
himself up in a room and has no friends or anybody to report his
conditions. The E.R.A. is so damn well advertised, that, unfor-
tunately, we have passed that point where people reluctantly ask
for relief.”

As a matter of fact, Burt, the New Orleans relief administrator,
openly declared in the press that if it had not been for the Com-
munists, thousands of people in Louisiana would never have
known of the existence of the Federal relief agencies.

Mr. Early denied that Negroes were discriminated against in
the distribution of relief. “Does that mean that they get the same
as whites?” I asked.

“Well, no,” Early answered, shifting uneasily in his chair.
“We pay on the basis of accustomed standard of living, and
naturally the Negroes get less.”

Mr. Early, a Roosevelt appointee, is admirably equipped for
his job, having begun his career as an assistant superintendent of
a boys’ reformatory in Covington, Virginia. This experience pro-
vided him with that hard-boiled training which helps him to han-
dle the unemployed in a “professional” way. His basic training,
however, came later when he acted as credit manager for a large
pipe foundry concern. This taught him how to save money by
whittling down “extravagances”.

Early could have only one excuse for not adequately caring for
the unemployed of Louisiana. That is, that the state government
itself supplies only 2 per cent of the funds. A

Huey P. Long’s attitude clearly is, “to he-llrwith the unem-
ployed!” » .

IV. "THE LOWEST WE CAN GET A MAN 1'0 WORK «FOR,'l

The history. of the struggles of the Louisiana fur trappers,

. which culminated in a “trappers’ war” strikingly reveals Huey
Long’s link with the most predatory exploiters in the state.

Louisiana is an important fur state, with more than 100,000
people dependent upon the industry for a living. l‘.ouisiana’s aver-
age output of pelts, according to the State Department of Con-
_servation, averages 4,000,000 over a ten-year period. Articles
manufactured from these pelts are mostly coats, linings, capes,

scarfs, trimmings and neck pieces.
17

 

 

The gradwal ‘expropriation of the Louisiana fur trappers
graphically resembles the expropriation of the yeomen of Eng-
land. Little by little the trappers have been reduced to serfdom.

Up to 1924 the Louisiana trappers, particularly in St. Bernard
and Plaquemine parishes, set their traps for muskrats, paying
only a $2 annual tax to the state. Most of the trapping lands had
reverted to the state when their original owners, who bought the
land in the hope of ﬁnding oil, abandoned them because of failure
to pay taxes. Trappers up to that time, working a short season,
oftentimes earned as much as $2,000 a year.

A gentleman named Leander Perez, a Long man and now the
district attorney of the two parishes, conceived the brilliant idea
that the trappers should be compelled to pay tribute. Perez ob-
tained a lease on land in and around Delacroix Island from the
state. Beginning with the season 1924-25, he forced the trappers
to pay him a separate fee of $50 a year each, in addition to the
regular 32 fee to the state.

THE TRAPPE RS‘ WAR

The following year the resourceful Perez helped organize the
Violet Trapping Company, in which he is now a large stock-
holder, and imposed new conditions upon the trappers: that the
men work with the company on a 50-50 basis, and that they agree
to sell only to the company. The trappers violently opposed this,
with the result that the fur bosses imported trappers from Western
Louisiana, failing to tell them of the labor struggle. When the
trappers arrived with their families and approached the canals on
their way to the marshes, the local trappers organized a picket
line, pleading with them to return.

Some left at once, but before the others could leave Perez im-
ported thugs from New Orleans and Texas, equipped with ma-
chine guns and sawed-oﬁ riﬂes, who proceeded to the canal. The
gunmen, as soon as they approached Delacroix Island in their
boat the “Dolores”, opened fire upon the trappers. The trappers
retreated to their shachsand seized their riﬂes. Shots were rapidly
exchanged, and one deputy was killed. Three members of the
Trappers’ and Fisherman’s Union, including its president, Albert
Gonzalez,‘-=were arrested, but were later freed. '

More recently, the federal government entered the situation to

18

 

 

enforce an injunction against the trappers. The Long forces have
attempted to shift responsibility to the federal government but
conveniently forget that they themselves had originally leased
the land to the Louisiana capitalists who exploit the trappers.

Under the prevailing leases, the trappers are compelled to pay
the fur companies 35 per cent of their earnings for the right to
trap. Moreover, some of the companies compel the men to sell
only to them, at prices much lower than those prevailing on the
market. Muskrats, for example, which would bring 65 to 72 cents
if sold freely to dealers, are bought up by the intruders for as
low as 28 to 35 cents apiece. What is more, the trappers are com-
pelled to post a bond of $200 at the beginning of each season to
guarantee that they will deal only with the company.

HUEY LOSES HIS ALIBI

As a result of this double-barrelled robbery, trappers who,
before the system of leases commenced, earned as high as $2,000-
$2,500 a year in good seasons, are now lucky to earn $200 and
$300 a year.

Huey P. Long has never uttered one word in condemnation of
the activities of the fur companies and their deputies, nor has he
attempted to rescind the leases of these marauders. ,

Any alibi that Huey Long might have advanced broke down
at the last special session of his subservient legislature when that
body adopted House Bill No. 78, making it an offense for trappers
to “trespass” on leased land, that is, to seek to earn their liveli-
hood on the land that they have always used.

Signiﬁcantly enough, I ﬁrst learned of the passage of this new
law from Henry Mirandona, robber-in-chief of the fur trappers,

in the course ‘bf an interview with him in his oﬁice in New Or» _

leans. Mirandona was highly pleased with this piece of Huey
Long legislation! - '

This cynical attitude toward the hard-working fur trappers is
a typical example of Long’s vicious stand toward all labor.

Under his regime» wages in the state have declined, hours have

been lengthened and the conditions of the workers and share-
croppers—Negro and white—have grown steadily worse. Behind
his sweet words about “sharing the wealth” is concealed a ruthless
anti-labor program. ~ A ' '~ = ’

INTRODUCTION

Huey P. Long, the self-styled Kingﬁsh of Louisiana, has
boldly proclaimed his desire to succeed Franklin D. Roosevelt
in the White House.

His radio speeches, his harangues in the Senate and his press
statements in the recent period, have literally bristled with de-
nunciation of the Roosevelt-Farley “New Deal”, of the N.R.A. and
the A.A.A. He has denounced the rich, pretended to champion
the interests of the poor, and proposes to “Share the Wealth”
as the solution for the present prolonged depression.

By such methods Long expects to rally around himself the
millions of workers, farmers and the middle class disillusioned
by the shattered promises of Roosevelt.

Long hopes to accomplish the defeat of Roosevelt in 1936 as
Roosevelt accomplished the defeat of Hoover in 1932.’ And by
the same method——empty promises!

There is one important difference, however. Roosevelt re-
mained within the time-worn, two-party system. He posed as a
“Liberal” Democrat, advocated a “New Deal”, proclaimed his
concern for the “forgotten man”, denounced the failure of the
Republicans to solve the crisis, captured a majority in the Demo-
cratic convention, and in the November, 1932 elections defeated
the already discredited Hoover.

Huey Long, on the contrary, though always a loyal Democrat
and a supporter of Roosevelt in the past, is now ready to break
with the traditional two-party system. He appears now as an
advocate of a “third” party.

The reason is not diﬂicult to understand. The Republican Party
has regained none of its lost prestige during the past two years.
The Democratic Party is ﬁrmly controlled by the Roosevelt-Farley
machine with no chance of control passing to insurgents headed
by Long. Yet the masses of the people have as little faith in
Roosevelt and the Democratic Party now as they had in Hoover
and the Republican Party in the 1932 elections. The signs of a

mass break-away from the two old parties are multiplying.
2

 

 

  

Long became Governor of Louisiana in 1928. Since that time
he has been its undisputed dictator and shares the major respon-
sibility for the conditions of the toiling masses in Louisiana.

Under his administration workers on construction jobs were
paid as low as ten cents an hour for common labor. The bridges
and highways of which Long boasts are monuments of labor
peonage.

On jobs like the new state capitol and the seawall at Lake
Ponchartrian some union men were employed; but this was not
the fault of Huey Long. Both the George A. Fuller Co. of New
York, which constructed the capitol, and the Raymond Concrete
Pile Co., were tied up by national union contracts, and the utiliza-
tion of non-union labor on skilled work on these projects would
have resulted in national union complications.

Labor men in Louisiana, who are not attached to the powerful
Long machine, are unrestrained in their private denunciation of
the ruthless exploitation on the state projects. Others, like A. P.
Harvey,'president of the New Orleans Central Trades and Labor
Council, skirt the issue and prefer to talk about the absence of
the union label on bread and milk in New Orleans.

“Conditions on state work are absolutely rotten,” Jack Ruth,
president of the New Orleans Building Trades Council, told me.
“Huey a labor man--what a joke! Highways, bridges, the Shus-
han airport, all these j obe were done with non-union men who
got wages that would bowl you over.”

Ruth related how he accompanied a delegation from the Cen-
tral Trades Council to Baton Rouge. They called on Huey Long,
then Governor, and protested the miserable wages paid on state
construction work. “We demanded that Huey put through a pre-
vailing wage clause, and what do you suppose the ——————— an-
swered? Looking us straight in the face, he said:

“The prevailing wage in this state is the lowest wage we can
get men to work for.”

Today workers on the Mississippi River Bridge (generally
known as.the_ “Huey Long Bridge”) are being paid 30 cents an
hour, despite the fact that the N.R.A. code calls for a minimum of
40 cents an hour.

Ruth told me that pressure throughout the state ﬁnally forced
20

 

 

the Legislature to adopt a prevailing wage clause for state con-
struction work, but this was vetoed by Long.

0 Labor men in New Orleans and other industrial cities of the
state frankly admit that trade union organization is at its lowest
ebb in 20 years. There are no more than 5,000 members organ-
ized into trade unions throughout the State of Louisiana at the
present moment.

THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST LABOR

Never has the exploitation of the industrial workers and share-
croppers been more frightful. Every issue of The Federationist, a
New Orleans labor paper endorsed by the Central Trades and
Labor Council, contains bitter complaints about lengthening of
hours of work, slashing of wages and discrimination against union
men. The Federationist, however", mistakenly attributes these anti-
labor attacks to mere “violations” of the N.R.A.

Yet The F ederationist in every issue repeats incantations to
the magic N.R.A. and calls for whole-hearted support for Roose-
velt and his program.

Lone IS ENEMY or smxens

Huey P. Long was Governor of Louisiana during the stormy
strike of the New Orleans street-car men. Strikers were slugged
and murdered by armed deputies of the Public Service, con-
trolled by the Electric Bond and Share, the leading J. P. Morgan
holding company. A labor delegation which called upon Governor
Long to demand that the state take over the Public Service was
told that he didn’t care to get “messed up” in the situation. At
another point in the strike, he expressed willingness to call out
the militia if requested by the Mayor of New Orleans. A

The Mayor, fearing the wrath of the strikers as well as the
highly sympathetic population, never made the request.

Huey Long maintained the same attitude in the various strikes
of the longshoremen and never lifted a ﬁnger in their behalf.

Long prevented the passage of the state equivalent of Section

'73 of the N.R.A., which presumably gives labor the right to or-

ganize, bargain collectively and strike. Anti-Long men in the

State Legislature told me that Huey’s apologists ingeniously ex’-
.?l A

   

plained that the state did not want to be barred from paying more
than code wages! -

His Legislature defeated the eight-hour bill for women, prin-
cipally through the activity of Senator Jules Fisher, a Long
henchman, who employs hundreds of women and girls at star-
vation wages in the shrimp industry. I

His Legislature defeated the Child Labor Amendment when
it came up for approval.

His Legislature sidetracked the full-crew bill on the railroads,
calculated to cut down hours of labor on the roads and reduce
accidents‘ by guaranteeing a full crew.

He prevented the passage of a prevailing wage clause although
he demagogicallyipretends to ﬁght for it in the United States!

His Legislature not once considered the urgent problem of
unemployment relief in the state of Louisiana.

During Huey Long’s entire regime, not a single measure of a
social character was passed in the State of Louisiana.

This is how Huey Long runs things for the beneﬁt of labor
and “the little man” in his own kingdom. He will follow these

and similar anti-labor policies if he succeeds in his bid for
national power. , '

_ V. FOE OF THE NEGRO PEOPLE

" A young’ Negro school teacher with whom I talked in Caddo
parish in the cotton belt revealed to me that her wages, which in
1933 were $65 a month, were cut to $55 last year and to $45 this
year. The official attendance in her Jim-Crow school is about 100
Negro children whom she is supposed to teach with one assistant.
The day I visited the school only about 20 pupils were in attend-
ance. 'When I asked the teacher the reason, she pointed to the
broken window, the poor stove and the ragged, hungry children.
At that moment three little Negro boys trundled into the school-
room carrying a bundle of twigs for the stove which they had had
to ‘gather. ' '

School is supposed to “keep” nine months for white children
and six -months for Negro children. Most of the Negro schools,
however, close down long before their terms expire.

' In hundreds of other Negro schools throughout Louisiana
there are no desks, the pupils writing on their laps. Teachers also
22

 

 

complain about the c-onstant shortage of paper and pencils.”"Few,
if any, of the Negro schools have toilet facilities in the building.

What. a ﬁne educational system this is, especially for the
Negro children of Louisiana!‘

Never since the days of ‘chattel slavery have the conditions of
the Negro share-croppers been worse than they are today in the
state of Louisiana. As a result of the Roosevelt A.A.A. program,
which Huey Long opposes only in words, share-croppers have
been forced to become day laborers on hundreds of plantations,
getting 65 cents for a 12-hour day, working from “dark to
dark”.

Cash is not paid to the share-cropper, and he is compelled to
buy what food the planter allots him on credit at the plantation.
This includes only the barest of necessities, and tobacco; movies,
books, recreation, etc., are entirely out of the question. In re-
sponse to my question, the cropper told me of the exorbitant
prices the plantation store charges for necessities: ﬂour, meal,
meat, rice and lard——a regulation pellagra diet.

A SHARECROPPER'S "'HOME"

A Negro share-cropper in the same neighborhood showed me
through his two-room shack. The walls were papered with pictures
from the Sunday sections of the Shreveport papers, describing
the gay life of the rich. Of his seven children, only four go to
school. The mother answered my questions, _and there was despair
in her voice. . . -

“They have no shoes, and hardly suﬁicient clothes. to go to
school, they ﬁx barnsfor mules better than forus people to‘ live
in, that’s the truth. What do I do? I hoe, chop cotton and take
care of my children.” -

, In the shack I could ﬁnd no phonograph, no radio or other
musical instrument of any kind.

I asked the cropper whether or not the A.A.A. had helped him
as a result of the government curtailment of his crop. The planter,
he informed me, “promised the money, but makes out the, check
didn’t come”. ‘

Earlier in the day, Mr. C. C. McCrory, Caddo Parish Agricul-
tural Agent, had informed me that “the government deals only
with the producers (planters) and sends all checks to them”.

The Negro people of Louisiana have no worse enemy than
Huey P. Long, Dictator of the State.

He has tantalized them with the prospect of regaining the right ‘A

to vote. At the same time his henchmen, in actual practice, have
been depriving them of every human right.

As part of his demagogic program of reducing certain un-
popular taxes while increasing the total tax burden of the popu-
lation, Huey Long abolished the annual poll tax of $1 per person
instituted many years ago in numerous states for thepurpose of
.limiting ‘the right of ' the masses to vote.

LONG DENIES "SLANDER"

Immediately upon the abolition of the tax, anti-Long forces in
Louisiana charged that the Kingﬁsh was planning to enfranchise

the Negro. Stung by the “accusation”, the Senator issued a sensa- '

tional leaﬂet vigorously denying that he had any such intention.
Over the signature of Huey P. Long, the leaﬂet declared:

“An urulerhand and secret lie is being spread about that this
amendment for free poll taxes will let the Negro vote in our elec-
tions. That is not true and. everybody telling it either does not know
the truth or doesn’t want to know the truth. The free poll tax will
not aﬂect the status of the Negro at all. Negroes can pay and do

' pay their poll taxes now, but that doesn't give them any better
chance to vote. It is the registration law and the white primary
that keeps the Negro out of our elections.”

This is a remarkably candid statement, coming as it does from
such a canny demagogue as Huey P. Long.

That his policy toward the Negro people is carried out con-
sistently was demonstrated to me in the course of an interview
with R. J. (“Bud”) Gregory, Registrar of Voters in New Orleans.
Mr. Gregory, a loyal Long henchman, who has been state ﬁre
marshal] for nine years, told me exactly how he “keepsiniggers
from voting in Orleans parish”.

Echoing the words of Huey Long, Gregory told me that the
elimination of the poll tax “doesn’t change the status of the nigger
one damn bit”. Elaborating and using the contemptuous term,
“nigger”, Gregory stated:

“Here’s the point: Even when the nigger paid the poll tax,
that didn’t qualify him to vote. That crowd (anti-Long) is hand-
ing you a foolish argument when they tell you that Huey means

 

ver

 

 

for the niggers to vote. All they have to do toget by the poll tax
is to give their name and address. But when they hit the registra-
tion oﬂice——right here———they have to qualify under the educational
clause. Besides, we have the right under the law to make any man,
nigger or white, to interpret the constitution of the state of
Louisiana orthe United States to my satisfaction.”

Sensing my eager interest in the whole matter the Registrar
of Voters unlimbered even more: “Some-of these niggers don’t
even know where they were born,” Mr. Gregory went on. “It’s
comical as hell, we get a regular picnic out of it. One nigger
was looking over a white man’s shoulder and saw him writing
Catholic after ‘sex.’ Ivgot it,’ says the nigger, ‘my sex is ‘Metho-
dist.’ And another nigger, after the word ‘signature’, wrote ‘Mayor

9!’

Walmsley .

“Oh, sure, they’re coming down here alright, but we’re turning
’em- down by the hundreds because they don’t qualify. The mon-
keys just waste our ink and paper. Naw, this poll tax change don’t.
provide no problem as you express it; no room for complaint.”

Huey Long’s henchman reviles the Negro people for their
“ignorance”, while he supports the system which squanders mil-
lions of dollars in graft and political favoritism ;" and which cuts
salaries of teachers and closes down schools long before the end
of the school term. .

Louisiana, in 1920, had 21.9 per cent, the highest percentage
of illiteracy in the country, white as well as Negro. Just before
the census of 1930, the Long machine for window-dressing pur-
poses put on a spectacular “drive” to reduce illiteracy. Classes
were hurriedly organized in state institutions, prisons and schools
but this Louisiana Renaissance petered out after a few short
months, enabling the Kingﬁsh and his crowd to put forward the
claim that illiteracy had been reduced to 13.5 per cent which
placed Louisiana in 45th place rather than 48th.

According to the Louisiana Department of Education illiteracy
among Negroes is 23.3 per cent as compared with 7.3 per cent
native whites. According to the latest available report of the
State Department of Education (Bulletin /llo. 266), the annual
average expenditure for each white pupil in the public elementary
high schools of the state was $44.98, while for each Negro pupil

the average was $7.88!
25

 

 

    

Huey P. Long has made a noisy din over the fact that the
state is now providing free school books to all children. The books
came at a time when taxes were soaring and the Kingﬁsh felt
that some kind of a sop would have to be thrown to the restless
population.

But while Long provided the school books (which inciden-
tally, brought lucrative contracts to his henchmen), wages of
teachers throughout the state were slashed, classes “consoli-
dated”, teachers’ pay held up in many parishes, and hundreds of
schools closed down before the end of their terms.

It is reported that Norman Thomas, prominent Socialist
leader, has appealed to Huey Long to aid the victimized share-
croppers in Arkansas. If the Kingﬁsh ever had any inclination
to aid the share-croppers and the Negro people generally, he
would have found plenty to keep him busy in his own Louisiana
kingdom.

VI. CAIN AND ABEL IN LOUISIANA

“Around $100,000,000 has come into the possession of the
Louisiana Highway Commission during the past ﬁve years,”
Julius T. Long, Huey’s eldest brother, revealed to me in the course
of an interview in his law office in Shreveport, La. “That great
fund has been used by Huey Long to control the politics of the
state and ﬁll the pockets of his henchmen and fawning followers.
Fat commissions were made on the purchase of cement, gravel,
motor trucks, road machines, crushed rock, asphalt, limousines,
galvanized iron culverts and guard rails. I ' A

“On the pretended sale of various supplies to the Louisiana
Highway Commission,” Julius Long continued, “Huey’s hench-
men have taken in tens of thousands of dollars——and spent most
of it helping him take care of his political campaigns.” , ’

During Huey Long’s term as governor several “overnight cor-
porations” were chartered in language sounding very much like
that of the Kingﬁsh, Huey’s brother told me. “The stock in these
corporations was usually subscribed by salesmen of cement, road
machinery, rock, or by some of Huey’s closer puppets. These con-
cerns sold asphalt, guard railing, galvanized iron'culverts, to the
Louisiana Highway Commission at great proﬁts, usually twice
what was paid by other states. Millions of dollars were thus lost

to the road funds of Louisiana.” ». . ~

Julius Tison Long, who is 15 years older than the Kingﬁsh, re-
lated how he had paid Huey’s way through the Tulane Law
School and had regretted it ever since. Julius calls himself a
Jeﬁ"ersonian Democrat. A former district attorney, he is a man of
small means—too poor even to hire a stenographer.

“I don’t want my children to be branded by the fact that /lzcir
uncle is trying to be a Hitler in this state!” Julius exclaimed.

Discussing the “overnight corporations”, Julius Long charged
that within a period of six months more than $500,000 of the
Louisiana road funds were advanced to one of these so-called cor-'
porations, under a fake contract that the corporation would sup-
ply one-fourth of that value in crushed rock to the Highway Com-
mission at that time. This so-called corporation had a contact
for the sale of 1,000,000 tons of crushed rock to the Highway
Commission before it ever spent a cent.

Julius Long told me that in practically every carload of that I

rock sold to the Highway Commission, an enormous amount of
water was poured, thus increasing the weight. . .

“When Huey was campaigning for Governor in 1923 and
1924, Huey hammered the ‘special interests’. After that election
the charge was made in my presence that certain special interests
largely ﬁnanced that campaign for Huey. I went straight to Huey
and asked him if it was true. He admitted it was. To this day, he
is going in with every special interest he can connect with, at the
same time howling how he will ‘stamp them into the dust’.”

A saon-nan SPEAKS

“Huey’s achievements, did you say’? Never has there been a
politician who so quickly could claim credit for what others have
done,..'or. who can change positions so rapidly, as Huey Long. He
keeps himself in print, roaring about people starving when there is
too much to eat; about reduction of private fortunes; about the
Mosaic Law-’ ' ' “

“Yet, if I could lay bare to the world the exact amounts of
graft taken from the funds ‘of the various departments and institu-
tions of Louisiana since my brother, Huey Long, became governor.
I am sure it would be so astonishingly large that even I would be
astounded. Equally astounding would be an itemized statement of
what has been expended for Huey’s long-distance telephone mes-

, sages, telegrams, booze, eating, wild parties, limousines, sound
trucks, campaign expenses, and the like, since he became governor
in May, 1928.” - -

27

 

   

Under oath, Julius Long made these and similar charges be-
fore the United States Senate Special Committee on Investigation
of Campaign Expenditures, sitting in New Orleans on February
16, 1933.

Huey P. Long claims credit for every mile of highway, every
bridge and every public building constructed in the State of
Louisiana during the past decade.

“The only accomplishments Huey doesn’t take credit for are
the children born in the state,” Jack Ruth, president of the New
Orleans Building Trades Council and an anti-Long man, told me
in the course of an interview.

It is undeniable that in the past decade millions of dollars
have been expended in public improvements. What are some of
Huey Long’s proud boasts?

He calls attention to 2,000 miles of paved highways and 10,-
000 miles of gravel road, bridges over the Red River at Shreve-
port and over the Red River at Moncla; one at Alexandria and
another one over the Black River at Jonesville; one over the
Cuachita River at Monroe and another over the Ouachita River at
Harrisburg, La. Some of these are still in process of construction.

Huey Long calls upon the world to gave with admiration at
his $5,000,000 skyscraper capitol building in Baton Rouge and
grows lyrical about the extension of his special favorite, the Louis-
iana State University at Baton Rouge.

By means of this expensive construction program Huey Long
has succeeded in building up a powerful political machine by
placing thousands of his henchmen and supporters on the state
payroll. Through manipulation of bids on contracts Long has
turned over millions of dollars to favored companies—-—some of
them dummy corporations in which some of his closest friends
and associates were involved.

The Long machine forces all state-controlled employees to
sign undated resignations. The thousands of workers on state pay-
rolls are compelled to contribute a minimum 5 per cent of thehir
wages to maintain the Long machine.

WHERE FUNDS COME FROM

Where elsedoes Huey Long get the funds to maintain this

pyramid of graft and corruption?
23

 

 

He gets the money largely through a whole series of taxes that
have been foisted upon the people of Louisiana. He has constantly
lightened the tax burden on the rich and placed it on the shoul-
ders of the poor. .

“Where does our money come from?” Huey Long asked in a
speech in the United States Senate. “Much has been said about
taxation in our state. Where does the money come from? It did
not come off the backs of the little man, not a dime. The total
assessment of $1,700,000,000 has been reduced to something like
$1,400,000,000, meaning that the ad valorem assessed basis of
property was reduced in that state somewhere between 16 and 20
per cent, meaning that we were receiving that much less in taxes
off of the physical property of the little homes of the state and
other property, big and little.”

True enough. Huey Long has reduced the assessments of real
propertry———but mostly the big ones. Long has extended favors to
his good friends. Take the case of the Canal Bank Building in
New Orleans, an affiliate of the Chase National Bank. The assess-
ments are now way down because Richard Leche, former secretary
to the Governor, was retained as counsel to seek an assessment
reduction. In 1930-31 the assessment was $6,000,000 and a frac-
tion; in 1932, it went down to $5,500,000; in 1933, it went down
to $5,000,000.

And on August 6, a letter of authority was sent to the New
Orleans assessment officials authorizing the reduction of the build-
ing’s assessment to $3,870,000. On the very same day Huey Long
refused even to hear the demands of an unemployed delegation
elected by 5,000 workers at a demonstration in Lafayette Square,
New Orleans, called to protest the cutting off of the “unemploy-
ables” from relief. ’

Attorney Leche, who received a retainer of $58,500, has since
been appointed by the Long machine to the Louisiana State Court
of Appeals-—evidently as a reward for his valiant work in de-
fense of the “little man.”

Immediately following the “compromise” with the ‘Standard
Oil Company, the New Orleans Item-Tribune reported that Huey
Long’s appointees on the Easton Baton Rouge Policy Jury (city
council) have requested the tax commissionto reduce the Stand-
ard Oil property assessment by $3,500,000.

Huey Long, aware that he cannot use the old parties, hopes
to ride this wave of popular mass discontent into the White House
in 1936 on a “Third” party ticket. He would create a new party,
giving it the label of “progressive”, “liberal”, “farmer-labor”,
or what not, essentially no different than the old parties, but hop-
ing thereby to convince the people that this party, with his line
of promises, would really serve their interests and satisfy their
needs.

Already Long is making deals with Father Coughlin, the De-
troit radio priest, Floyd B. Olson, Minnesota F armer-Labor gov-
ernor, Milo Reno, leader of the Farmers’ Holiday movement, and
others preparatory to the launching of a new “Third” party. The
program which they adopt will contain a queer mixture of Long’s
“share the wealth”, Coughlin’s “social justice”, Olson’s “cooper-
ative commonwealth” and Reno’s “rehabilitation of the farmers”.
But it will be no more queer than was Roosevelt’s mixture of
“New Deal”, “forgotten man”, “social security” and the rest.

Like Roosevelt’s concoction it will be designed to catch the
votes of people desirous of a truly fundamental social change.
But like Roosevelt’s program it will not provide that change.

Huey Long, like Hoover and Roosevelt before him, as well as
Father Coughlin, Governor Olson and Reno, are defenders of the
capitalist system. They believe that the natural resources of the
country, and the factories, the railroads and the banks should be
owned and controlled by the big capitalists, the banks and the
trusts. They believe that the industries should be operated, and
the nation’s resources exploited for the enrichment of these
capitalist owners. Private ownership, private proﬁt!——these are

- their Gods!

In office, regardless of promises made before election, Huey
Long would act as the defender of capitalism, of capitalist proﬁts.
Huey Long admits as much in his indictment of Roosevelt:

“Roosevelt . . . has produced economic and industrial stagna-
tion, and I believe he is a greater menace to capitalism than any
other influence in the country. I believe in capitalism, but you
cannot stimulate it unless there is buying power. You have got
to have a foundation under the house, and that is more even dis-
tribution of wealth.” (New York Times, Feb. 10, 1935.)

In short, Long criticizes Roosevelt because he considers him a
bad defender of the interests of the rich. Yet under Roosevelt the

3

 

  

 

Huey Long’s machine reduced the tax on cotton gins owned by
wealthy planters by 50 per cent, but did not provide for a similar
reduction in fees charged poor cotton farmers by the gin owners.

Two weeks before the Legislature convened in the fall of 1933,
Long declared for a 25 per cent income tax on incomes above
$50,000. When the Legislature met, he reduced it to 6 per cent.
It is instructive to note that the difference in tax rate between an
income of $2,500 and $1,000,000 is only 4 per cent. It is clear
that Long made his first statement as a demagogic move to gain
mass support.

Huey Long abolished the state personal property tax on auto-
mobiles, by which the rich gained much more than the poor.

From these few examples it can readily be seen how the tax
load has been steadily shifted from those who can bear it.

LONG MACHINE MAKES MASSES PAY

How, then, has Huey Long paid for his extravagant public
works program? He has done the same thing on a state-wide
scale as Roosevelt has done and is doing on a national scale. He
is making the workers and poor farmers carry the load.

True, Huey Long abolished the $1 annual poll tax. But in its
place he has substituted a tobacco tax which the masses pay for.
Every ﬁve cents’ worth of tobacco or cigarettes carries a tax of
one cent, so that a 15-cent package of tobacco is taxed three cents.

True, Huey Long has somewhat reduced the license tag fee
on automobiles, but he has more than made up for this loss by
the gasoline tax. This tax (state, parish and municipal) totals
seven cents a gallon, so that a gallon of gasoline which would or-
dinarily retail for eight cents costs the consumer ﬁfteen cents.

Because Huey Long refuses to contribute towardrelief, the
local municipalities have been graciously authorized by the state
to enforce an amusement tax, with the result that movie-goers pay
a one-cent tax on every admission price of 25 cents. Whether this
fund actually goes to the “unemployable” (blind, aged, demented,

etc.) is another question. It should be noted that Louisiana, which

is one of the few states in the country which has no Department
of. Public Welfare, provides no relief to the unemployed. All re-
lief—such ascit is—is under the supervision of the Federal Relief

Administration.
30

 

These are only a few of the direct taxes; the entire population
pays in millions in indirect taxes through exorbitant rentals for
slums and farm hovels, through high electric, gas, telephone and
street car fares.

THE STATE MORITORIUM

Huey Long promised the farmers a reduction of $2,000 from
their basic assessment ﬁgure, but now notiﬁes them that it is im-
possible to put this law into effect “for at least three years”, be-
cause the fund which would make this exemption possible is
needed for other purposes.

Huey Long makes a great to-do about his “state moratorium”
on mortgage debts. But what he has done is simply to make his

v henchman, J. S. Brock, the banking commissioner, a virtual exe-

cutioner over the lives of the ruined farmers of the state. Pre-
viously foreclosures were at a low ebb because the mortgagors
were not anxious to possess idle farms. As a result of the so-
called moratorium, Brock is the sole judge and rules just how
much the mortgagee must pay to keep the property; how much in
repairs must be put in, etc.

The banks and insurance companies which hold the mortgages
in Louisiana have been able to extract more money from their
farm debtors under the moratorium than they could before its
enactment. .

Recently, accompanied by much ballyhoo, Huey Long an-
nounced that he had forced the telephone company, through the
State Public Service Commission, to reduce rates in New Orleans
one dollar a month. Francis Williams, former chairman of the
Public Service Commission, charged openly in the New Orleans
press—and told me personally in the course of an interview-—.—
that Long unquestionably made a deal to reduce the company’s
property assessments in exchange for the rate reduction.

This is not the only way in which Huey Long has helped rob
the people of Louisiana to secure funds for the state political
machine. By forcing Louisiana banks to take on watered- state
bonds, he caused a situation in which hundreds of thousands in
small savings and deposits were lost in bank failures and “reor-
ganizations”.

One ﬁnal word on Long’s kniﬁng of the people of Louisiana.

31

 

    

Just before the failure of two of the biggest banks in New
Orleans, Huey Long issued this statement to the press:

“I am not a betting man but I am willing to bet thatlno per- y.
son loses a thin dime which is on deposit in any bank in New 5
Orleans. Watch for Monday. All will be happy. We have never _
failed yet!” "(Item-Tribune, New Orleans, February 5, 1933.) ,

But only one week earlier the Kingﬁsh had declared in New
York City:

“My kids have got $10,000 in cash. It's in a lock box. I’ve got
too much gal darned sense to put it in a savings bank. All I’ve got
for myself is in insurance, and I’ve been drawing on that and
putting it in a lock box.” (New York‘ Herald Tribune, Jan. 27,
1933.) '

No, the masses did not lose “a thin dime”. They lost millions -
in small deposits!

Huey Long has a double-headed tax program: to reduce the
tax load of the rich, while appearing to lighten the tax burdens of
the poor; in practice, to place the burden squarely on the backs
of the impoverished masses of Louisiana.

VII. LONG—AGENT OF THE BANKERS

 Huey P. Long is a hireling of the Rockefeller-colntrolled
l Chase National Bank of New York. Sworn testimony published
l ‘ in oﬂicial government documents reveals that this avowed “enemy
{ of special interests” carried on a ﬁlibuster in the United States
3 l Senate in 1933 on behalf of the Chase National Bank. This is but
‘ a single illustration of Long’s intimate relations with powerful
|‘ capitalist groups.
’ t earm s e ore t e ommittee on an In an urrenc
l Ah'gbf hC ' Bkig dC y
T‘ of the U. S. Senate, held November 23 to December 7, 1933, con-
 siderable testimony was taken regarding the Banking Bill of 1933.
 This bill contained certain vregulative measures opposed by vari-
li, ous banking interests.
0' Senator Glass, -51 member of the committee, testifying on De-
cember 5, 1933, told how a senator who had carried out a ﬁli-

p _ buster against the bill, rushed to New York without even waiting "
‘ l to vote, in order to “confer” ( !) with oﬂicials of the Chase Na-

32

l
\
‘ tional Bank.
I

 

Senator Glass~—“Beside that, Mr. Chairman, I want to point out
some things contained in the Banking Act of 1933 that are of an
extremely restrictive nature, one or two of them having been sug-
gested by Mr. Aldrich [president of the Chase National Bank
and son-in-law of John D. Rockefeller] himself. And in this con— 5.
nection I want to say that, either with or without the knowledge
of Mr. Aldrich, oﬂicials of the Chase National Bank were among
those who came to Washington and violently opposed those pro- 
visions of the law; and one of the oﬁcials of the Chase National ii
Bank is alleged . . . to have been in constant communication with :f.
the man who made the most vituperative and violent assault on E
those provisions of the law that were made by anybody. And I have s};
been informed by trustworthy persons, and it is partially sustained I‘
by the record itself, that this man, without waiting to vote on the
banking bill, boasted that he had practically ﬁlibustered it to death,
left his place in the Chamber, and took the next train out of Wash- 
ington for New York for an interview with this oﬁicial of the 3
Chase National Bank.” 4

Senator Couzens——“And is that official, Mr. McCain, who is
the chairman of the record?”

Senator Glass——-“Yes; it was Mr. McCain.”

Senator Couzens—“And he is the man who for some reason or
other we have never been able to get on the witness stand here."

The Chaimtan—“He will be here tomorrow.” (Hearings before
the Committee on Banking and Currency, U.S. Senate, 73rd Con- 
gress, Second Session, pp. 4019-4020.) '

.,. . -n_._T..__4

The violent and vituperative Senator referred to by Senator
Glass was Hon. Huey Pierce Long, U.S. Senator from Louisiana!

The Wall Street rumor at the time, widely circulated in ﬁnan-
cial circles, said that the sum passed was $25,000.

In acting for the Chase National Bank it is quite evident that
Huey Long was acting for the entire banking oligarchy of New
York City, for whom Mr. McCain was the spokesman.

ENTER HARVEY COUCH. LONG'S BACKER

Two days later, the elusive Charles S. McCain, chairman’ of
the Board of Directors of the Chase National Bank of New York,
testified as follows:

~ -;a w,;;4 — — - -v~ —

Mr. Pecora—“Mr. McCain, from evidence heretofore presented

- to this subcommittee it appears that a loan was made by the
Chase National Bank to a syndicate the managers of which were
.. Dillon, Read & Co., H. C. Coach, and yourself; that the amount
of the loan was 82,975,000. Do you recall the loan in question?”

Mr. McCain-—“Was that a loan made to-—” '  

 

 

  

Mr. Pecora (interposing)—“That was a loan that was secured
principally by shares of the capital stock of the Louisiana & Ar-
kansas Railway Co.”

Mr. McCain—-“Yes, sir; I recall the loan.”

Out of the total loan of $2,975,000 advanced to the syndicate,
Harvey C. Couch received, according to the Senate testimony, the
sum of $1,650,000, more than half the loan (page 4145).

Harvey C. Couch, it will be recalled, is president of the Lou-
isiana & Arkansas, as well as of the Arkansas & Texas Railroads
and has extensive power interests throughout the South. He was a
Hoover appointee to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. His
connections with the Chase National Bank and other New York
bankers are extensive and intimate.

This is the man who is Huey P. Long’s chief ﬁnancial backer.’

No wonder that Senator Long fought so valiantly against a
bill, certain ‘vital features of which the Chase National Bank con-
sidered so obnoxious.

“Huey P. Long gives the people the headlines and the cor-

porations the profits.” _ .

This is the succinct characterization by Francis Williams,
former chairman of the Public Service Commission of Louisiana,
in the course of an interview with the writer.

_Williams, recent candidate for mayor of New Orleans, ought
to know. For 12 years he was a member of the Public Service
Commission. For ten years of that time he was associated with
Huey P. Long on that important body.

Negro day laborers on plantations in Caddo parish, one of
the richest cotton-growing centers of Louisiana, earn 65 cents
working from “dark to dark”—a,I2-hour day. But it would be a
mistake to get the impression that this was an index to the wealth
of the corporations of Louisiana. .

Clearly it is the latter who beneﬁt from the ruthless dictator
ship of" Huey P. Long. _ *

VA RICH EMPIRE

Louisiana is one of the richest states in the land,vranking high
in the production of oil, cotton, furs, sugar, rice and sea foods.
The-oil, cotton and sugar interests of Louisiana are not, primarily,
Louisiana interests; they are ﬁrmly bound up with the big Wall

. 34

Street bankers who dominate these industries throughout‘ the
country. .

New Orleans is one of the most important ports in the United
States, being the main outlet to South and Central America. In
1932 Louisiana ranked ﬁfth in value of exports.

It is obvious that the corporations and plantation owners have
a rich ﬁeld in which to work. And Huey Long is their able repre-
sentative. Although individual Louisiana capitalists here and there
oppose Long or some of his measures, the main body—the most
powerful and reactionary section of the Louisiana capitalist class
—energetically supports Huey Long and his dictatorial rule.

Huey Long represents the interests, not only of the local
Louisiana capitalists but, through them, the Wall Street bankers
with whom they are linked. Chief among his supporters are the
powerful cotton interests organized in the New -Orleans Cotton
Exchange, and directly linked with the New York Cotton Ex-
change. The sugar and oil barons similarly support the ruthless
Long dictatorship. Jefferson Caffery, U.S. ambassador to Cuba, is
a Louisianan who is bound up with the big sugar interests.

The publication last year of F uehrerbriefe (Letters from
Leaders) revealed the names of the powerful German industrial-
ists who were providing" the funds for Hitler. Similarly, a list of
some of Long’s backers will show the Louisiana dictato'r’s ties
with big capital in the state. C

HUEY LONG'S BACKERS

_ Harvey Couch, president of the Louisiana 81 Arkansas and the
Louisiana, Arkansas & Texas Railroad. Formerly member of_ the
R.F.C., Couch is one of Huey Long’s chief supporters, and is con-
stantly seen in his company in private cars of the railroad. It was
because he tried to photograph Long with Couch that a reporter
was recently slugged and nearly killed by Joe Messina, one of
Long’s burly bodyguards. ' »

Harry P. Williams of Paterson, La.: lumber king and airplane
builder. A ’ ’

Alfred D. Danzinger, real estate operator; formerly president
of the New Orleans Association of Commerce.

Luca Vaccaro, president of the Standard Fruit and Steamship
Company, Vaccaro Steamship Lines, part owner of the Roosevelt

 

 

Hotel, New Orleans (one of the largest in the South); and di-
rector of banks and other corporations.

Abe Shushan, New Orleans merchant who became wealthy by
supplying merchandise to state institutions. Long appointee as
president of the Dock Board. Huge new airport in New Orleans
named after this distinguished citizen. Shushan has been indicted

by the Federal government for income tax evasion and faces trial A

in Louisiana next month.

R. L. Gay, Zwolle, La. Big oil man.

Charles Laskey, Shreveport; big utility man who has large
holdings intthe Northern Louisiana Gas Company.

Seymour Weiss, president of the Roosevelt Hotel and head of
the Dock Board. Weiss, too, has recently been indicted for income
tax evasion and faces early trial.

Senator Jules Fisher, shrimp and oyster packer, who is a
buddy of Huey Long’s. Fisher helped to kill the eight-hour bill
for women in 1932. ,

Robert Maestri, who made a fortune from the ownership of
“cribs” in the notorious‘New Orleans Red Light district. Maestri
is a member of the Levee Board.

Rudolph Hecht, president of the Hibernia Bank of New Or-
leans, also President of the American Bankers’ Association.

Senator Fisher made a fortune from the state providing
shrimp shell for the use of road construction. No wonder he’s an
ardent supporter of Huey P. Long! He employs hundreds of
women at starvation wages; no wonder he ﬁghts the eight-hour
law for women in Louisiana!

Danziger, another of Huey Long’s backers, is a wealthy cor-
poration lawyer, head of the Real Estate Owners’ Association
and also of the Young Men’s Business Club. -

STRIKE-BREAKERS DE LUXE

Vaccaro, the big steamship man, pays his Central American
peons 25 cents a day. If you think it’s merely because Vaccaro
doesn’t like “foreigners”, just ask New Orleans longshoremen,
seamen, hotel employees and oﬂice workers——b0th Negro and
white——~just what Vaccaro pays them.

During the last longshoremen’s strike, Vaccaro approached

the picket line at Canal Street and the river in New Orleans. He
36

 

..,,___._,

remonstrated with the pckets in an attempt to persuade them to
quit the strike. Failing this, he became abusive, and ﬁnally, draw-
ing a gun, he shouted: L

“If you lazy, rotten, no good sons-of-bitches haven’t got sense
enough to get wise to yourselves and break this god damn strike,
and if you try to stop anybody from working, I’ll blow your god-
damn brains out!”

Huey Long’s supporters are thus revealed as strikebreakers
and wagecutters. This is the program of Huey Long and his
backers.

A poor man by the name of Cazedessus, a Baton Rouge banker,
whose bank had failed, was given a $5,000-a-year job on the Baton
Rouge police jury by Huey Long.

30 is the ‘wealth shared in the State of Louisiana!

The capitalists support Long because they have beneﬁted and
are beneﬁting from his program. Huey Long has reduced the
burden upon the rich of Louisiana and placed it upon the backs
of the poor. As a member of the Louisiana Legislature told me,
“Huey curses the rich and taxes the poor”.

STRUGGLE OVER THE TAX

At the last session of the Legislature several months ago, Long
put through a tax of ﬁve cents a barrel on all crude oil reﬁned in
Louisiana and brought from other states through the company’s
pipelines. There were a number of reasons for this move. First,
the tax, which would have amounted to more than $3,000 a day.
according to the Standard Oil Company, would considerably in-
crease the income of the Long political machine in Louisiana.
Secondly, it was an attempt to force the Standard ,,Oil Company
to use Louisiana crude oil, which has a high speciﬁc gravity and

~ which the company says is unsuitable for its purpose. Thirdly, it

provided Huey Long with the demagogic slogan that he was
“fighting the‘ corporations”.

The Standard Oil Company, which had dealt with politicians
before, took the offensive. For public consumption, oﬂicials of
the Standard Oil Company threatened to remove their giant plants
to Mobile, Ala., and other cities. The emptiness of these threats

is seen in the fact that the Standard Oil Company has $75,000,-
. 37,

000 worth of property invested in Louisiana, including its huge
Baton Rouge reﬁnery.

In the meantime, at “breakfast legislatures" at the Roosevelt
Hotel and on the golf links Huey Long was conferring with J. C.
Hilton, president of the Standard Oil. Finally, the stage was set,
and Long emerged with a statement that his Governor, O. K.
Allen, was calling a special session of the Legislature to rebate
four cents on the ﬁve-cent tax.

The Legislature simply ratiﬁed what had been decided upon
at the breakfasts in the Roosevelt Hotel.

Under the terms of the “compromise” the governor is given
authority to suspend the tax (which, incidentally, relieves the in-
dependent oil producers as well as the Standard Oil) on the vague
understanding that Standard Oil will use more Louisiana crude.
No criterion is established to determine just how much Louisiana
crude is being used by the company from time to time.

There is no doubt that a factor which hastened the “com-
promise” was the formation of the Square Deal Association whose
initial meeting was composed largely of employees of the Stand-
ard Oil Company who were terriﬁed at the prospects of losing
their jobs in the event of the company’s removal. In fact, 1,000
men were laid off immediately following the passage of the tax,
but Long men say they were only temporary workers.

The dove of peace now carries love notes from Mr. Hilton of
the Standard Oil to Huey P. Long, but Huey, however, still clings
to his demagogic title of “enemy of the corporations”.

The real nature of Long's shadow-boxing with the Standard
Oil Company of Louisiana is further exposed by his tie-up with
the fountain-head of the Rockefeller oil interests, the Chase Na-
tional Bank.

Clearly, Huey Long gets along very well with bankers, cor-
poration heads and rich planters. .

VIII. THE "SHARE-THE-WEALTH" MIRAGE

Huey P. Long’s enticing “Share-the-Wealth” utopia is a trap
for the masses of the United States.

This is evidenced by Long’s own record as anti-labor dictator
in his own Louisiana kingdom and by the most casual examina-

 

V

 

 

tion of the “principles and platform” of the Share-the-Wealth
Society with its absurd motto, “Every Man a King”.

Dividing Up.——Every big fortune would be at once cut down
to only three or four million dollars by means of a capital levy
tax. Each capitalist would fill out a questionaire telling just how
much he owned and in what form he wanted the amount he is
permitted to keep. The rest would go to the U.S. Treasury. A J
good part of it, according to Long’s promises, would be used to 
give every family who does not at present have it, $5,000, in the
form of a home, radio, automobile, etc.

‘v——-""""‘-*— o— -

This fantastic promise conceals the fact that Long will do,
as he has done, his very best to preserve capitalist ownership of
mills, mines and factories, with its ruthless robbery of the labor-

- ing population. .

Education.-—Long promises that under the “Share-the-Wealth"
system, the government would provide all kinds of new schools
and especially universities for the youth. “College enrollments
would multiply 100 per cent. We would immediately call in the
architects and engineers, the idle professors and scholars of
learning. We would send out a hurry call” which would start “a
fusillade of employment”.

Long forgets that the mass education of the American youth
has not saved millions of them from being thrown on the dump-
heap of unemployment as a result of the capitalist crisis.

Agricu.lture.—-Farming would be cared for “in the manner
speciﬁed in the Bible”~—“no plowing under of crops, no burning
of corn, no slaughtering of cattle”. As much as possible would be
raised. What could not be used would be put in Federal ware-
houses. Any year that found these full could be taken off by the
farmer who would then be put on public works.

In this Long is basically in full agreement with the crop cur-
tailment program of the Roosevelt government. Both sanction
the mass starvation of workers in the midst of plenty, while farm-
ers will be “relieved” by jobs on forced labor projects at starva-
tion wages.

The Aged and the V eterans.——Everybody sixty and over, and
having an income of less than $1,000 or less than $10,000 in
property or money, would get a pension under Long’s “Share-the

biggest capitalists increased their proﬁts from 50% to as much as
300%. The living standards of the masses of people were lowered.
What then would happen under Huey Long—a more militant de-
fender of capitalism by his own boast?

Of course Long claims that he desires to raise the standards of
the masses in order to strengthen the position of capitalism,
therefore his “share-the-wealth” plan.

But didn’t Roosevelt say the same thing when he was ﬁghting
Hoover? Was that not the declared aim of the “New Deal”?
Didn’t Roosevelt promise to overcome unemployment, to raise
wages, to provide “social security”, to raise farm prices—also to

"achieve “a more even distribution of wealth”—in order to pre-

serve capitalism?

But after Roosevelt’s election the desire to serve capitalism, to
satisfy the greed of the capitalists for more and more proﬁt,
quickly wiped out the meaningless “New Deal” platitudes on the
“forgotten man”.—He remained “forgotten”!

One who stands as the defender of capitalist property and of
capitalist proﬁt, whether he be a Coughlin or a Long, will in-
evitably go the way of a Hoover or a Roosevelt. They will sacri-
ﬁce the interests of the masses, they will cut wages and unemploy-
ment relief, they will impoverish the farmers and the middle class.
Their concern will be proﬁts and ever more proﬁts.

The "best" proof that Huey Long is no exception, that he will
follow the course of his capitalist predecessors, of Hoover, of
Roosevelt is shown by this pamphlet. Huey Long has been in
power for seveniyears in Louisiana, the state’s undisputed dic-
tator. Sender Garlin, the author of this -pamphlet, studied his rec-
ord ﬁrst hand. Huey Long is here shown as the tool of the bank-
ers, the manufacturers and the landlords. He isshown as the ex-
ploiter of the poor. From hisrecord the only meaning which can
be read into “share-the-wealth”, is the sharing of the “wealth” of
the poor among the rich. ,

The Longs, Coughlins, Olsons, Renos, and their “third” party
proposals hold out no hope for the masses.

The united action of the toilers, relying on their own organized
strength, building their own class Labor Party, with leaders se-
lected from their own ranks, will alone bring the masses im-
proved ' conditions.

Wealth” scheme. Veterans would receive the bonus and “be other-
wise provided for without stint or unreasonable limit”.

In Louisiana, where Huey P. Long has been undisputed ruler
for years, no sign of an old-age pension system is on thehorizon.
Louisiana is done of the few states in the country without a State
Department of Public Welfare. The promise of old-age pensions
as well as the bonus.are obvious baits for public support, for
Long’s own deeds in Louisiana prove that he has little concern
for their welfare.‘

IX. AN INTERVIEW WITH THE KINGFISH

In Baton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, I interviewed the
man who is the ideological fountain-head of the “Share-the-
Wealth” plan.

THE SENATOR IN ACTION

I walked in on Senator Long while "he was “explaining”
various bills to his subservient Committee on Ways and Means on
the tenth ﬂoor of the new capitol building.

Along about noon the solons decided on a luncheon recess.
Seeing my chance, I approached the Kingﬁsh and remarked, “I’ve
been wanting to meet you for a long time, Senator. Could I talk
to you for a few minutes now? I’m— making a study of conditions
in Louisiana and I’d like to ask you a few questions,Aif you
don’t mind.”

“I’m very busy right now,”-Long countered, turning his back
on me politely and addressing himself to the Hon. George Wal-
lace, Assistant Attorney General of Louisiana and reputed to be
Huey’s “brain-truster”. I stood hesitating for a second, then ap-
proached the Kingﬁsh once more. ,

“You don’t mind if I accompany you down the elevator, do
you, Senator?” I

“Hell, no!” Long continued talking with his Attorney Gen-
eral. .

“Quite a building, this capitol, eh, Senator?”

“Sure is,” replied the Senator, glancing around with evident
satisfaction.

“Expect the session to last very long?”

“Few days.”

We passed through the doorway of the committee room into
the wide spacious hallway of the captol. Huey and I were being
followed by the watchful Attorney General, several members of
the Ways and Means Committee and at least two members of
Huey’s omnipresent bodyguards.

We ﬁnally landed in the elevator. Ten ﬂoors, even in a modern
$5,000,000 capitol, are good for a few questions.

“Is the Standard Oil Company the only corporation you’re
hostile to, Senator, or do you ﬁght big business all over the
state?”

“I’m not hostile to anything. All we’re doing is reducing
rates and getting taxes out of them.”

That very evening Huey’s subservient Legislature-—at his bid-
ding——was to revoke the tax on the Standard Oil Company!

“How do you feel about Roosevelt’s program, Senator?”

“I don’t know what his program is. I wish someone would
explain it to me.” (Sixth ﬂooor.)

“Just who is behind this Square Deal outﬁt?”

“Oh, hell,” Long grimaced, “they got nobody”. (Third
floor.)

‘‘Is it true that the Standard Oil Company is paying their
expenses?”

“They ain’t doing enough work for anybody to make them
worth a cent.”

Thus with a wave of the hand the Kingﬁsh brushed away the
latest manifestation of opposition to his policies.

SAYS HE'S "FRIEND OF LABOR"

The elevator landed on the main floor. Huey made for the

governor’s oﬁice. Once inside, he threw himself into a luxurious

chair. I sat down at the table, while the Kingﬁsh’s retinue, in-
cluding a number of legislators and the Attorney General, waited
patiently on the sidelines.

“You’re considered quite a friend of labor in this state, aren’t
you, Senator?” .

“Aw, hell, yes. Ever since I was Railroad Commissioner way
back in 1918, and all along the line I’ve always been 100 per
cent for labor and labor’s always been 100 per cent for me.” i

41 ‘

 

  
  

“Senator, some of the union people in New Orleans tell me
that men got as low as ten cents an hour on state construction
work under your administration. No truth in that, is there?”

“I guess that’s so. But, hell, that didn’t have anything to do
with me. That was a question of bidding. Whoever turned inithe
lowest bid got the contract.”

“But, as a friend of labor, you could have stipulated union
scales for all state construction work, could you not, Senator?”

“There’s no such thing as unions on state highways around
here,” the Kingﬁsh replied. Our eyes met.

“Senator, from what you hear in Washington, do you think
there is any danger of war breaking out?”

“They’d go in for it if they could. It’s been the method of all
condemned and rebuked administrations since the beginning of
time.”

“Don’t you think, Senator, that the government should use the

_ money appropriated for war preparations, that is, battleships,

etc., to feed the unemployed and their families?”

“Absolutely. I ain’t in favor of this government battleship
business a-tall. Of course, I wouldn’t scrap all of ’em, but I would
have a better uniﬁed airplane study made.” Huey is apparently
in favor of a more eﬂicient war machine.

“Your opponents say that Negroes will now vote in Louisiana
as a result of your abolition of the poll tax. Is that really so?”

OK'S DISFRANCHISEMENT OF NEGROES

“Not a-tall, sir!” Huey barked. “The poll tax don’t change
the status of the nigger one damn bit! All it does i-s to elimi-
nate the one-dollar poll tax. Of course the niggers are registering
in droves, but the Registrar of Voters still has charge of setting
the qualiﬁcations for all voters.” A

Several months previously Huey had got out a leaflet to this
effect in order to reassure his lily-white supporters that he had
no intention of helping to enfranchise the hundreds of thousands
of Negro workers and share-croppers in Louisiana.

Shifting the subject, I asked Long if it were true that Harvey
Couch, power man and railroad president, was one of his main
supporters.

“Those fellows [the opposition] would have it that I shouldn’t

- 42

 

 

 

speak to Couch, but I speak to them all, and tax ’em.” Long was
evidently conscious of the box-office value of the slogan, “tax the
rich”.

“What do you think of Upton Sinclair’s ‘Epic’ program, Sen-
ator? John Klorer, the editor of your paper, tells me that Sinclair
was one of the ﬁrst -to subscribe to it and has said some nice
things about your ideas.”

“I don’t know much about what he’s aiming for, but I be-
lieve it calls for conﬁscation. I’m not for that, my program is
for limiting fortunes above a certain amount.”

“What amount, Senator?”

“Oh, if a man has a million dollars, we let him he’p himself
to it, but if he has a few millions, why then we put a tax on it,”

“Senator, I recall that you once debated Norman Thomas in
New York. Just what do you think of the Socialist program? It
has something in common with your ‘Share-the-Wealth’ plan,
hasn’t it?” '

“No, we’re about as far apart as the poles. They believe in
government ownership. I’m against that; the government’s mess-
ing around in business too much as it is.” ’

“Well, how do you feel about the Communist program for
ﬁghting the depression, Senator?”

“Oh, I don’t know much about them.”

Our eyes met for the second time.

“I do know, though, that they are a-seeking for the govern-
ment to own everything. We call for the government to keep out
of business. Our plan is nothing but limiting property.”

“I’m not entirely clear, Senator. Didn’t I understand you to.

say that it was the Socialists who want the government to own
everything?”

“Well, sir, I don’t just catch the difference myself. Some say
there is a difference between ’em, but I’ll be damned if I know
what it is.” _ _

Huey’s eyes fell on a newspaper clipping onthetable. He
chuckled. I caught a glimpse of a cartoon portraying him. as a
crowned dictator. ,_ 1 A . i ‘

"mmvss ON oPPgsm‘oN‘°""

“I understand that practically all the important newspapers

of the state are1’against you, Senator. Is that true?”
1' Q

_..-_._..._.._......,,- ....-..,.- ._ .._... . . . .._.,... ., _.. .,-..-. .-..r......_._....._...,_.._.......,..

  
  

“Yes, it’s true, all right, and it’s a damn good thing. We
thrive on opposition. Senator Noe, here, will tell you a thing or
two about it. Why, up in Monroe and Shreveport our boys had

. told us that the papers were a-layin’ low and that we’d carry the

election only three to one. Hell, I said, that will never do. It
ain’t fair for them papers to lay quiet against them bills of ours.
Sometimes those sons-of-bitches make like they’re on our side,
and we have to get out our handbills to convince them to the
contrary. Now, as I was saying, we got out the handbills up in
Monroe and Shreveport and after a while the papers started
printing front-page attacks against me and m’bills, and the ﬁnish
was that we carried the election there eight to one instead of
three to one.”

“Senator, I’ve just visited the cotton country up North. The
farmers, especially the poor ones, don’t seem to be getting on
very well. Whatdo you think about it?”

“This damn A.A.A. or whatever you call it hasn’t he’ped any-
body anywhere, in any way.”

“How would you handle the farmers, Senator?”

“If you’d read my speeches like you said you did, you’d
know that my idea is to store up the crops and hold it for a year

until we got a good price for it. In the meantime we’d put the a

farm fellows to work on highway building and such.”

“Well, isn’t that fundamentally the same thing that Roosevelt
is doing; you both seem to be in agreement about the necessity
for crop curtailment?” The Kingﬁsh grunted.

“Your program is considered quite radical by the people of
Louisiana, isn’t it, Senator?”

“Hell, I don’t give a damn what folks call it or me—radical,
conservative or reactionary. All I’m advocating is right out of the
Bible. It comes straight out of the Scriptures.”

“A little while back, Senator, you stated that you were in
favor of organized labor. How, then, do you account for the fact
that labor organization is so weak in the state of Louisiana? You
have considerable inﬂuence in this state; coul_dn’t you help union-
ization along a bit?” ?""‘"' ’ '“ at-«-

“No, sir,.I couldn’t do that. I’m for labor, have always been,

and labor’s for me. But I couldn’t get messed up in that.”
44

 

 

 

“Senator, I understand that your Legislature defeated the
Child Labor Amendment. How did that happen?”

“The rural vote wouldn’t support it. I voted for it in Congress,
though,” he hastened to add.

“But couldn’t you swing the rural vote around if you took
the stump and spoke for the amendment throughout the state?”

“Well, now, I cain’t make the rural people do it without I
ruin myself to do it, do you understand?”

I walked out of the governor’s office, out of the capitol and
into the Louisiana sunshine. At the head of the steps I recognized
Joe Messina, Long’s six-foot bodyguard. I

X. LONG'S RECORD AT A GLANCE

Long’s creation of a subservient Legislature, his choice of a
puppet governor, his naming of various rubber-stamp commis-
sions, his usurpation of local administrative powers, his seizure
of control of the state courts, and his clinching of control over
civil service employees, have been for the sole purpose of serving
those “special interests” which he so noisily pretends to ﬁght.

Long’s reduction of tax assessments on the properties of many
large corporations, his “compromises” with powerful groups like
the Standard Oil Company, his constant whittling down of the
tax load of the rich—these have been their gains from his dic-
tatorship.

As Long said in a Senate speech, “I have not undertaken to
persecute the rich, but on the contrary, I have sought to favor
them.” '

Long has constantly increased the tax burden of the masses of
Louisiana. He has placed exorbitant taxes on such mass-consump-
tion items as gasoline, tobacco and amusements. He has permitted
exorbitant rents, electric light and gas rates, and street-car" lfares.
Huey Long “curses the rich and taxes the poor”. ' ' "

Long’s bitter enmity for union labor has saved the class which
he serves millions of dollars in wages. They have been grateful
for his work in barring a prevailing wage clause on state con-

struction projects (he supports it for headline purposes in the»

U.S. Senate). They are grateful to him for his wage-cutting and
strike-breaking-policies. His famous dictum, “The prevailing wage
in thisstate is the lowest" wage we can get men to work for,’.’ has

   

become the watchword emblazoned on the banners of the em-
ployers of Louisiana.

LONG STARVES UNEMPLOYED

Long has starved the unemployed of Louisiana even more
savagely than any other state in the country. Not once has the
issue of unemployment relief come up in his State Legislature.
The state supplies only two per cent of the fund which now goes
toward relief, and that comes from funds of local communities.
As Long stated: “I’m against the Workers Unemployment In-
surance Bill; under my ‘Share-the-Wealth’ plan, there’ll be no
unemployed.”

Long’s oppressive rule has resulted in mass pauperization and
misery. He has prevented the passage of the Child Labor Amend-
ment, the eight-hour bill for women, the full-crew bill on the rail-
roads. Not a single piece of social legislation has been passed
under the eight-year dictatorial regime of Huey P. Long. He
“gives the people the headlines and the corporations the proﬁts”.

Long is a sworn foe of the Negro people. He has stated time
and again that he will not permit their re-enfranchisement in
Louisiana. While he gives them the illusion that they will vote,
now that the state poll tax is abolished, he robs them of the most
elementary human rights. He supports the whole system of dis-
crimination and terrorism against the Negro people. As Long
sums it up: “The abolition of the poll tax doesn't change the
status of the nigger one damn bit.”

What is the nature of the opposition to this blaclcguard and
his program?

There are two focal points of capitalist “opposition” to Huey
Long. First there are the corrupt Old Regulars gathered in the
Choctaw Club, the Tammany Hall of New Orleans. For years they
have controlled the political life of the city, and it is only re-
cently that they have clashed openly with Long after the latter
sought to undermine their control of the millions that has come
into the city’s coffers.

THE "SQUARE DEAL" GROUP

The most recent and widely-publicized “opposition” has come
from the Square Deal Association, initiated in Baton Rouge im-
46

 

  

 
 

mediately after the ﬁve-cent-per-barrel tax (later revoked) was
placed on the Standard Oil Company. Although Ernest Bour-
geois, original leader of the Association, admitted to me that the
primary impetus for the organization came from the Standard Oil
Company, it is nevertheless true that in its ranks are found some
sincere opponents of Huey P. Long’s dictatorship. This “move-
ment”, which has no positive social program, is still compara-
tively small.

The discontent against the Long regime grows on every side.
Various groups spring up from time to time, but they have no
program capable of rallying the V-masses behind them. Only the
program of the Communist Party offers real opposition to Huey
Long and his rule.

WHO CAN DEFEAT LONG?

A/lthough still very young, the Communist Party of Louisiana
is beginning to grapple with the task of exposing and ﬁghting
the Long regime. In the very midst of the armed struggle between
the Long andithe Walmsley forces, when national guardsmen were
facing armed Square Dealers, the Communist Party organized a
mighty united front relief demonstration of 5,000 workers in La-
fayette Square, directly facing the City Hall!

The best guarantee for the defeat of the Long dictatorship,
with its ruthless attacks upon the living standards of the masses,
is the building up of a mighty Communist Party and the organiza-
tion of a mass Labor Party which will lead the workers and farm-
ers of Louisiana in struggles, and drive from power Huey P. Long,
personiﬁcation of the fascist menace in the United States.

THE REAL HUEY P. LONG

By SENDER GARLIN
I. THE RISE OF THE KINGFISH

“W H00-O0-OOEEE !”
The stillness of the tranquil evening was shattered by
an ear-splitting, old-time, Indian war-whoop.

“Whoo-oo-ooeee 1”

Down Canal Street, in New Orleans, tore a well-knit man in a
natty suit, untamed red-brown hair blowing wildly in the wind.
A few of his cronies followed on his heels.

“What’s goin’ on?”

“Why, that’s Huey.” From lip to lip the question and answer
ﬂew.

In a few minutes, a curious, wildly excited crowd was follow-
ing “the Pied Piper”. Into the empty theater in which he had
scheduled a mass meeting, the mile-runner led the ensnared
citizens.

Huey P. Long, now U.S. Senator from Louisiana, steps for-
ward and begins to deliver his oration.

His feet are planted solidly on the platform. His cadenced
sentences rise and fall over the entranced audience. The speaker’s
face is pudgy, his cheeks ﬂushed. His bulbous nose is red. There is
a deep cleft in his forceful chin. His face appears. willful. He has
the voice of a side-show barker, with the gestures of a Hitler.

Concluding a speech full of incisive attacks upon minor evils,
vague promises of future Utopias, interspersed with moving bibli-
cal allusions and homespun anecdotes in his best “hillbilly” style,
Huey Long thunders:

“Then no tear-dimmed eyes of a small child will be lifted to
the saddened face of a father or mother unable to give it the ne-
cessities required by its soul and body for life; then the powerful
will be rebuked in the sight of man for holding that which they
cannot consume, but which is craved to sustain humanity;1’the

food of the land will feed, the raiment clothe, and the houses
shelter all the people; the powerful will be elated by the well-
being of all, rather than through their greed. Then those of us who
have pursued that phantom of Jefferson, Jackson, Webster, Theo-
dore Roosevelt and Bryan may hear wafted from their lips in Val.
halla: ‘EVERY MAN A KING.’ ” '

The audience, composed of small business men, harassed pro-
fessionals, state employees of the Long machine and a scattering
of workers, rises to its feet in a delirium of applause at this glow-
ing picture of the Promised Land.

A STORMY CAREER

What a meteoric rise this demagogue has had!

Only a few months earlier his armed thugs had kidnaped
from the Gardner Hotel in Shreveport, La., an engineer named
Sam Irby, formerly connected with Long’s State Highway Depart-
ment. He had been rushed about the state by car and plane,
manacled to a tree in a marsh, almost devoured by mosquitoes,
starved and threatened with assassination. All this, Irby had
charged had been done on the eve of Long’s election to the
United States Senate, to prevent him from ﬁling a libel suit
against the Kingﬁsh which would have revealed information dam-
aging to Huey’s election prospects.

As a boy Huey was a regular attendant at all religious cere-
monies. He read the Scripture from cover to cover. In school,
Huey was a debater, declaimer, mile-runner and member of the
relay team. Later he became a traveling salesman for a large
supply house which had a branch oilice in New Orleans. He dis-
tributed pie plates and cook books and occasionally held baking
contests in various cities and towns of Louisiana. It was in this
way that he met pretty Rose McConnell, his future wife, who had
won a pie-baking contest arranged by Huey in Shreveport.

TRAINING THAT CAME IN HANDY

How shrewd and unscrupulous that salesman Huey had been!
He had managed to convince a merchant in the little town of
Waynesboro, Miss., that he would have no trouble in selling a
carload of starch to his customers. Huey obtained the merchant’s
order for that amount and left him hopelessly overstocked with
that commodity.

This experience was excellent training for his later career as a
lawyer. He studied law seven months in Tulane University in New
Orleans with the money lent him by his eldest brother, Julius.
His money gave out in the spring and Huey couldn’t wait until
June to take the bar examinations. He got the Chief Justice of the
Louisiana Supreme Court to assemble the judges in special session
to give him the quiz.

Huey was a good lawyer. He had boasted to friends that his
first case as a lawyer was one in which he defended a cousin
against the charge of stealing a hog. Huey easily convinced the
jury that his kin was a victim of a foul frame-up and was entirely
innocent of the charge.

Huey received the hog as his fee.

Later Huey became a member of the Louisiana Public Service
Commission. He abused the “special interests” in his speeches,
but at the same time his income rose from fees received as a cor-
poration lawyer. When the Shreveport Street Railway Company
sought to raise street car fares from ﬁve to six cents, Long pre-
tended violent opposition, making speeches and taking the matter
to court. In the end, he consented to an increase. Huey’s “opposi-
tion”, resulted in a seven-cent instead of a six-cent fare.

By such “attacks” against the corporations, and the acquisition
of inﬂuential friends, Huey managed to build up a political ma-
chine which swung him into the governor’s chair. One of his chief
supporters was Mr. Robert Maestri, who had made a fortune
from bawdy houses in the notorious New Orleans “Red Light”
district.

After Huey was elected governor, the Old Regulars and the
Long gang organized "a love feast in the form of a “peace-and
progress” banquet. The business men of the city decided to raise
money for a chest of silver to be given to the governor and Mrs.
Long. Along came Bob Maestri with a personal check for $1,500.

New Orleans business men are practical and very, very tolerant, A

but they gagged at taking Maestri’s money for such a noble pur-

pose, fearing embarrassment. The check was shipped back to »

Maestri who smiled, went out and bought a glittering emerald
stickpin set with diamonds and this he personallypresented to
Governor Long. The governor took it gratefully, wore it, and
brags about it often.

And then it came to pass that Mr. Robert Maestri became the
head of one of the most valuable branches of Louisiana’s govern-
ment—the Conservation Department, with its control over mil-
lions in oil lands, furs and standing timber.

THE IMPEACHMENT FIGHT

Huey’s political opponents did not let him rest for long. The
struggle over booty waxed hot, and soon a move was launched
to impeach him as governor. The indictment contained nineteen
articles of impeachment. The charges included bribery, graft,
corruption, misappropriation of state funds, violent abuse of pub-
lic oﬂicials, favoritism, intimidation and the hiring of assassins.

Huey went into action. He sped around the state in his high-
powered limousine, rounding up his men in the Legislature, and
by those methods of lubrication so familiar in American politics,
Huey killed the impeachment threat. He had “persuaded” ﬁfteen
state senators to sign a “round robin” that they would vote against
the impeachment regardless of the evidence, thus barring the two-
thirds vote required.

“Vindicated”, ambition began to mount in Huey’s proud
breast. From local boy in Winn parish he had risen to Public
Service Commissioner and then to the governorship. And four
years later, with the aid of the same methods which had brought
him so far, Huey landed feet-ﬁrst on the ﬂoor of the United
States Senate at the age of 38.

His political technique is illustrated by his policy on two
measures: the Child Labor Amendment and the Prevailing Wage
Clause. Both of these measures he demagogically supported in
the Senate. Yet, in his own kingdom, where his power is supreme,
he has prevented their passage.

His main appeal is primarily to the ruined rural population
and to the middle class. He ensnares the impoverished farmers
with glowing promises ofifuture wealth, while he corrals the
harassed “little man” with bombastic assaults upon “special privi-
leges” and the “big interests”.  “Share¥the-Wealth” program is
a pretty soap bu:bble.which‘is ecohomically impossible. Such a
thought is furthest from the mind of the Senator from Louisiana.

Huey Long says he thrives on opposition. All of the leading
newspapers of Louisiana——eighteen of them——are “opposed” to

 

Long, but their opposition merely serves to advertise him and
his “program”. They fear a real expose of Huey Long, for they
know that it would expose capitalism as well.

Such a thought is furthest from the minds of the wealthy,
open-shop newspaper publishers of Louisiana, and the -Wall-Street
interest which they represent. '

LONG'S BALLYHOO METHODS

Meeting this superﬁcial opposition is a comparatively simple
matter for Senator Long. National hook-ups, accommodatingly
provided by the giant broadcasting chains, bring his staccato
speech right into the homes of millions. With the Louisiana State
University under his pudgy thumb, Huey Long makes a full use
of the facilities of its radio station, WDSU, to reach his Louisi-
ana audience. From the state treasury he draws the money to buy
and maintain several modern sound-trucks in which he makes
"whirlwind tours not only in Louisiana but also throughout the
South. Those few who are reached neither through the radio nor
by means of his sound-trucks are ﬂooded with his countless hand-
bills, written in the same ﬂamboyant style as his speeches are
delivered. Since the organization of his “Share-the-Wealth” so-
cieties, Long has vastly extended the inﬂuence of his monthly
paper, The American Progress. The Kingﬁsh now claims for
these clubs a membership of more than 200,000.

Long’s most potent weapon, however, is his oratory. ‘ He is
colloquial, spontaneous, dramatic, humorous in a slapstick way
—and his chief staple is the Bible. ' '

II. THE KINGFISH IN HIS KINGDOM

“I have not undertaken to persecute the rich, but, on the -con-

trary, I have sought to favor them.”—From a speech by Huey P.

-Long in the United States Senate. (Congressional Record, May 12,
1932, Seventy-second Congress, First Session.)

Huey Pierce Long today rules the State of Louisiana with an
iron ﬁst. This dictatorship is now in action.

Early in February, 1935, after rumors had been ﬂoating
throughout the state that one more of “Huey’s special sessions”
was in the oﬂing, Senator Long—not Gov. Allen——announced that
the Chief Executive of the state would shortly call a special'ses-

sion of - the Legislature to consider urgent legislation, "particu-
