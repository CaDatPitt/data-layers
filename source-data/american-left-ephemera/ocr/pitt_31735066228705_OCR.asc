Europe (great and small alike) to their very foundations.
Again the development of farming in the United States has
made it possible to exploit the vast industrial resources of the
country so effectively that, before long, American competition
will put an end to the monopoly hitherto exercised by Western
Europe in the realm of industry. These two courses of evolu-
tion react in their turn upon the United States, tending to
force that country likewise into revolutionary paths. More and
more do the small and medium-sized farms, the warp and woof
of the whole political system, tend to be submerged by the
competition of large-scale undertakings. Simultaneously in
the ﬁeld of industry, we are .witnessing the emergence of a
multitudinous proletariat and_a fabulous concentration of capi-
tal. (Preface of Marx and Engels to Russian Edition of the
Communist Manifesto, published in Geneva, 1872.)

Such, in ‘brief, was the estimate of Marx and Engels on the
international r6le of the United States as a “safety valve” and
source of cotton and grain for European capitalism prior to
the American Civil War, and as itself a revolutionizing force
during and after the Civil War.

The Communist Manifesto with its brilliant tracing of the
entire trajectory which European capitalism and the prole-
tarian revolution were to follow, undoubtedly overestimated
the speed with which the path was to be covered. The ex-
planation of the slower tempo of the bourgeois and proletarian
revolutions is to be found principally in four factors:

1. The petty—bourgeoisie was incredibly more cowardly and
less consistently revolutionary than the authors of the Mani-
festo could imagine priorlto 1848, having in mind the “heroic
days” of the bourgeoisie during the great French Revolution.

2. Russia proved a powerful bulwark of reaction.

3. America served as a “safety valve” for discontented
emigrants and a market for capitalist expansion.

4:. There was a ﬂood of gold from and a rush of emigration
to America in 1849 consequent on the California gold strike.

In 1850 Marx wrote:

Now we come to America. The most important fact which
has taken placehere, even more important than the February

revolution, is the discovery of the California gold mines. Even

now, after scarcely eighteen months, it can be foreseen that
this discovery will have much more magniﬁcent results than
the discovery of America itself. . . . A coast of 30 degrees of
latitude in length, one of the most beautiful and fruitful in
the world, till now as good as uninhabited, changes before our
eyes into a rich, civilized land, thickly populated by men of
all races from the Yankee to the Chinese, from the Negro to
the Indian and Malayan, from the Creole and Mestizo to the
European. The gold of California pours out in streams over
America and the Asiatic coast of the Paciﬁc Ocean, and drags
the most recalcitrant barbarian peoples .into world trade, into
civilization. For the second time world trade takes a new direc-
tion. What Tyre, Carthage and Alexandria were inantiquity,
what Genoa and Venice were to the Middle Ages, what London
and Liverpool have been till now, the emporia of world trade,
New York and San Francisco, San Juan de Nicaragua and
Leon, Chagres and Panama will now become. . . . Thanks to
the gold of California and the tireless energy of the Yankees,
both coasts of the Paciﬁc Ocean will soon be just as populous,
just as open to trade, just as industrial as is now the coast
from Boston to New Orleans. Then the Paciﬁc Ocean will
play the same r6le as the Atlantic does now and as the Medi-
terranean did in antiquity and the Middle Ages—-—the réle of
the great seaway of world commerce; and the Atlantic Ocean
will sink to the r6le of an inland sea as the Mediterranean is
now. . . . (N eue Rheinische Revue, Correspondence dated
London, Jan. 31, 1850.)

The words just quoted are a striking example of “that
wonderful gift, ﬁrst demonstrated in the Eighteenth Brumaire
of clearly grasping the character, the signiﬁcance and the
necessary results of great historical events at the time that
these events are still being enacted before our eyes or have
just come to an end.” (Engels)

The brilliant prophecy of the shift of the center of world
trade to America and the Paciﬁc concludes with a forecast of‘
the revolutionizing of China and the playful prediction that
9

  

when the European reactionaries ﬂee to Asia from the rising
tide of revolution in Europe to the ancient Great Wall, they
will Aﬁnd_ over its gate the inscription: .
. “Republique chinoise, Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité.”

One more example of “prophecy” concerning America's in-

A ternational réle, this time from the pen of Engels. In 1888

he wrote to Sorge of the danger of a general European war in
which “ten to ﬁfteen million combatants” would take part:

If the War were fought to a ﬁnish without inner movements
(i.e. revolutions-—B.D.W.), a state of exhaustion would re-
sult such as Europe has not experienced for two hundred
years. American industry would then Win all along the line
and would set us all before the alternative: either a relapse to
pure agriculture for our own needs (American grain forbids
any other kind), or—social revolution. (Letter to Sorge,
Jan. 7, 1888.)

II
The‘ Civil ‘War

“Liberal” historians, whose main stock in trade is the con-
viction that all progress is gradual and “force never accom-
plished anything,” pontiﬁcally declare that "the Civil War
was unnecessary” and “slavery was doomed anyhow." This
owllike “wisdom” which takes ﬂight only after the day is done
is refuted by the decades of conﬂict which preceded and the
decades of conﬂict which followed the Civil War. For almost
half a century the struggle between North and South was the
axis around which turned the whole domestic and foreign
history of America.

The present struggle between the South and North [wrote
Marx in 1861] is . . . nothing but a struggle between two
social systems, the system of slavery and the system of free
labor. Because the two systems can no longer live peacefully
side by side on the North American continent, the struggle has
broken out. It can only be ended by the victory of the one or
the other system. (Vienna Presse, Nov. 7, 1861.)

In an earlier article in the same paper, Marx had exploded
the myths of the reactionary European press (still held by
some of our “liberal” historians) that the Civil War was 00-
casioned by the struggle over the tariﬂ. In reply Marx pointed
out that free trade had prevailed from 1846 to 1861 and that
the Morrill Tariff, far from causing secession, was only possi-
ble because secession had taken place. (I bz'd., Oct. 25, 1861.)

A second myth, advanced by the reactionary press then and
held by many “liberal” historians today, was to the effect that
slavery was not involved, merely the preservation of the Union
and Northern reconquest.

Before all [answered Marx] it must be remembered that
the war did not emanate from the North but from the South.
(I bid.)

11

‘i

-—:r.~:--. -7+": - -

The South split the Democratic Party on the Kansas issue
because even “Squatter Sovereignty” was not a sufficient ex-
pansion policy for the slaveholders. The consequent election
of Lincoln" furnished the pretext for secession and the South
attacked Fort Sumter to force war, after learning that the
garrison would surrender within three days without attack.
“Continual expansion of the territory and continual spreading
of slavery over and beyond its old boundaries is a life princi-
ple for the slave States of the Union.” (I bid.) In this “life
principle” Marx found the driving force which made the
conﬂict “irrepressible.”

The cultivation of southern articles of exportation carried
on by slaves [he continued] . . . is productive only as long as
it is carried out on a mass scale with large gangs of slaves and
on wide stretches of a naturally fertile soil demanding only
simple labor. (Ibz'd.)

Exhaustion rapidly results and the older States are forced
more and more to slave-breeding.

T -As soon as this point comes, the acquisition of new terri-
tories becomes necessary in order that a part of the slave-
holders may settle new fertile territories With their slaves and
that a new market for slave-breeding and the sale of slaves
may be created for the part that has remained behind.

Thus, it was the conﬂict between two opposing and expand-
ing systems—a conﬂict “to decide whether the virgin soil of
immense tracts should be Wedded to the labor of the immi-
grant or prostituted to the tramp of the slaveowners”—-—that
brought on the Civil War.

The Conduct of the War

The great struggle went through many stages before it
ﬁnally climaxed into war. Until its very last phase, the ob-
jective signiﬁcance of the movement—-the eradication of slav-
ery—remained quite outside the historical ﬁeld of vision of
the Northern bourgeoisie as a whole, although it was far more

12

 

e. _g. . *9‘, «

 

 

obvious to the Southern slaveowners. The class as a class trod
the path of revolution with the hesitating steps of petty com-
promise and political bargaining. (Herberg, The Heritage of
the Civil W M, Workers Age Publishing Co.)_

Only the advance guard of the bourgeoisie, the abolitionists
and radical wing of‘ the Republican Party, and the vanguard
of the European working class on the one hand, and the
Southern ruling class on the other, clearly perceived the
revolutionary character of the conflict.

When an oligarchy of 300,000 slaveholders dared to in-
scribe for the ﬁrst time in the annals of the world “Slavery”
on the banner of armed revolt, when on the very spot where
hardly a century ago the idea of one great Democratic Re-
public had ﬁrst sprung up, whence the ﬁrst declaration of the
Rights of Man was issued (Declaration of Independence—
B.D.W.), and the ﬁrst impulse given to the European Revo-
lution of the eighteenth century, when on those very spots
counter-revolution, with systematic thoroughness, gloried in
rescinding “the ideas entertained at the time of the formation
of the old constitution” and maintained “slavery to be a bene-
ﬁcial institution,” indeed, the only solution of the great prob-
lem of the "relation of capital to labor,” and cynically pro-
claimed property in man “the cornerstone of the new ediﬁce,”
——then the working classes of Europe understood at once,
even before the fanatic partisanship of the upper classes (of
Europe——B.D.W.), for the Confederate gentry had given its
dismal warning, that the slaveholders’ rebellion was to sound
the tocsin for a general holy war of property against labor,
and that for the men of labor with their hopes for the future,
even their past conquests are at stake in that tremendous
conﬂict on the other side of the Atlantic.

So wrote Marx in the Address of the First International to
Lincoln, characterizing the revolution, or rather counter-
revolution, initiated by the Southern ruling class. Similarly,
in a letter to Engels he analyzed the engineering of the
secession and the nature of the new government set up:

A closer view of the history of the secessionist movement
13

  

 

shows that secession, constitution (Montgomery), Congress,
etc., were all usurpations. Nowhere did they allow the people
to vote en masse. . . . It is not only a question of secession
from the North, but also of the fortifying and sharpening of
the oligarchy of 300,000 slavelords in the South against the
ﬁve million whites. (Letter of July 1, 1861.)

Both Marx and Engels expected that once war was declared
the North would wage it by revolutionary means, that is, pro-
claim the emancipation of the slaves, encourage a slave revolt,
and thus utilize the inherent weakness in the Southern social
structure to bring the war to a speedy conclusion. But Lincoln,
temperamentally cautious and inﬂuenced by the pressure of
the border States which had not seceded, disappointed not
only the “revolutionary impatience” of Marx and Engels but
of Greeley, Stevens, Fremont and many another radical

_ Republican and abolitionist as well. Thaddeus Stevens

declared :

Our statesmen do not seem to know how to touch the
hearts of freemen and rouse them to battle. No sound of
universal liberty has gone forth from the Capitol. Our
generals have a sword in one hand and shackles in the
other. Let it be known that this government is ﬁghting to
carry out the great principles of the Declaration of
Independence and the blood of every freeman would boil
with enthusiasm and his nerves be strengthened for the holy
warfare. Give him the sword in one hand and the book of
freedom in the other, and he will soon sweep despotism from
every corner of this continent.

Greeley wrote:

Future generations will with diﬂiculty realize that there
could have been hesitation on this point.

Marx tartly commented:
Lincoln's acts have all the appearance of the pettifogging,

stipulated clauses which an attorney presents to his opponent.

But in the next line he added, and this is a lesson to the
“debunking” school of historians:

this does not interfere with their historical content. . . .
(Letter to Engels, Oct. 29, 1862.)

Engels was so infuriated and worried by the military-
; ‘ political blunders and defeats of the North in the early period
v of the war that he feared the defeat of the North in spite
"4' of its numerical and potentially political superiority. Marx
knew less of military matters than Engels, but with sure
analysis of the political forces involved, never doubted that
 emancipation would come, and ultimately the victory of the

North. He wrote Engels:

 

The way in which the North wages war is just what you
would expect of a bourgeois republic where swindle has so
long sat upon the throne.

And again, in the same letter:

As far as the Yankees are concerned, I am ﬁrmly of the
opinion, now as I was before, that the North will win in the
end. Of course, the Civil War can go through all kinds of
phases, perhaps even armistices, and may drag out for a long
time. . . .

In spite of everything I would stake my head on it that
these fellows (the South——B.D.Wl.) will get the worst of
it. . . . (Letter of Sept. 10, 1862.)

But Marx did not limit himself to analysis and prophecy.
He worked tirelessly to arouse the workingmen of Europe,
and especially those of England, to the support of the North-
ern cause and the prevention of a war by the ruling class of
England or any other country against the Union. He wrote
articles in the English and German press, urged mass meet-
ings and demonstrations on the British trade-union leaders,
and one of the ﬁrst acts of the newly—formed International
Workingmen’s Association (founded Sept. 28, 1864:) was to
adopt the address to Lincoln, cited above, and to arrange an
.r international campaign of meetings and demonstrations.
~ . 15

Lincoln gratefully acknowledged to the workingmen of
Manchester, starving because of the cotton blockade, that their
support was “an instance of sublime Christian heroism which
has not been surpassed in any age or in any country.”

The United States Senate paid tribute to the same_ heroism
in its sessions of Feb. 26 and March 2,_.1863, and even the
conservative Charles Francis Adams, Ambassador to England,
made grudging acknowledgment of gratitude to the First
International. Of this debt of gratitude to the workingmen of
England and the International not a word has survived in the
writings of our present—day oﬂicial historians!

The Reconstruction Period

In a second address of the International Workingmen’s As-
sociation directed to President Johnson on the occasion of the
assassination of Lincoln and the wounding of Seward, the
International tactfully suggested its views on reconstruction
in the words:

. . . the task, Sir, devolves upon you to uproot by law what
the sword has felled. . . . (Address of May 13, 1865.)

And in a third address—— “To the People of the United
States,” on the occasion of the ending of the war, the Inter-
national, after offering its congratulations and recalling its
support as giving it the rightto offer advice, declares:

. . . Permit us to add a word of counsel for the future.

Injustice against a fraction of your people having been
followed by such dire consequences, put an end to it. Declare
your fellow citizens from this day forth free and equal with—
out any reserve. If you refuse them citizens’ rights while you
exact from them citizens’ duties, you will sooner or later face
a new struggle which will once more drench your country in
blood. (Address of Sept. 25, 1865.)

Just as Marx had advocated a prosecutionvof the war by
revolutionary means, so helsaw the necessity for continuing the
16

 

 

. *§a“.vp

 

social revolution initiated by the Civil War, by means of a
“J acobin” rather than a “Girondin” reconstruction program.
This would have involved the smashing of the Southern ruling
class, breaking up of their estates, distribution of the land to
those who tilled it, the emancipated slaves and poor whites,
and full social, economic and political equality for the negroes.
This program was urged with varying degrees of completeness
and clarity by the radical Republicans—-Stevens, Wade, Sum-

:‘ ner and Phillips. But against this radical course, needed to

carry through the bourgeois-democratic revolution involved in
the Civil War to its ultimate conclusions, the reactionary
wing of the Republican Party, backed by the big bourgeoisie,
supported the conservative program outlined by Lincoln and
Johnson. Marx was swift to see this and as early as June 24,
1865, he wrote to Engels:

Johnson’s policy disturbs me. Ridiculous aﬂectation of“

severity against individual persons, up to now highly vacil-
lating and weak in the thing itself. The reaction has already
begun in America and will soon be strengthened if this
spinelessnessis not put an end to. (Letter of June 24:, 1865.)

The following year he saw a gleam of hope in the struggle
of the Radicals for the control of Congress and their attempt
to impeach Johnson, an attempt which came very close to
success.

After the phase of Civil War the United States is really
only now entering into the revolutionary phase, and the Euro-
pean wiseacres, who believe in the omnipotence of Mr. John-
son will soon be undeceived. (Letter to Engels, April 28,
18669

Vain hopel The conservative course triumphed and eleven
years later Marx summed up the results of reconstruction in
another letter to Engels:

The policy of the new President (Hayes) will make the
negroes, and the great expropriations of land in favor of the
railways, mining companies, etc. . . . will make the farmers,
already dissatisﬁed, into allies of the Working class.

MARX AND AMERICA

by
BERTRAM WOLFE

“THE predictions of Marx and Engels, al-
though with retarded tempo, have all been
veriﬁed. Industrialization has indeed taken
place ‘with seven-league boots’; slavery has
been abolished; class ﬂuidity has come to
an end; the frontier has disappeared; the

split between skilled and unskilled, native
* s and foreign, negro and white, is yielding to
growing homogeneity; America has ceased

to be the ‘promised land’ for the immigrant;
negroes and working farmers are being

- radicalized and are developing a feeling for

the need of alliance with the workers
against the ‘associated oligarchy of capi—

tal’; the Paciﬁc has come to ‘play its‘

prophesied role; America has attained to
stormy and contested world hegemony, and
a permanent working class has been
formed. '  a
‘.‘Only the subjective factors are still lag-
ging—in short a Marxist Communist Party
worthy of the name. To create these subjec-
tive conditions the absorption of the writ-
ings of Marx and Engels on America, the
developing of their fragmentary ‘ hints
(fragments of a gigantic structure), the
mastery of their method, are an essential
aid. Marxists in America can make no more
fitting observation of the ﬁftieth anni-
versary of the death of Marx than by
possessing themselves of that revolutionary
heritage and making it their own—their
own, and the heritage of the American
working class as a whole."

The American Labor Movement

No permanent labor movement was formed in America until

after the Civil War. The various workingmen’s parties that _

ﬂourished for brief intervals prior to that were diverted into
popular reform movements for universal suﬂrage and free
public education, into. agrarian movements for free distribu-
tion of small homesteads from the public lands, into the
Utopian socialist experiments under petty—bourgeois leader-
ship during the '30’s and ’40’s, and the antislavery agitation
that overwhelmed all other issues in the decade or so prior to
the Civil War. But the war brought in its train the rapid dis-
tribution of public lands (whole empires to the railroads and
homesteads to small farmers and workingmen) , the abolition of
slavery and the sudden and swift development of great for-
tunes, a dominant industrial and ﬁnancial class, and, within a
few decades trustiﬁed industry.

The National Labor Union

In the United States of America, any sort of independent
labor movement was paralyzed so long as slavery disﬁgured a
part of the republic. Labor with a white skin cannot eman-
cipate itself where labor with a black skin is branded. But
out of the death of slavery a new and vigorous life sprang.
The ﬁrst fruit of the Civil War was an agitation for the 8-hour
day——a movement which ran with express speed from the
Atlantic to the Paciﬁc, from New England to California.
(Marx, Capital, Vol. I, p. 309—published in 1867.)

In August, 1866, the National Labor Union was formed
under the leadership of William H. Sylvis, leader and founder
of the National Iron Molders Union. One of the acts of the
formative convention of the National Labor Union was the
proclamation of a ﬁght for the 8-hour day as a ﬁrst step in

18

 

—.   «

a struggle “to free the labor of this country from capitalistic
slavery.”

As president of the National Labor Union, Sylvis answered
an address of the First International to the American people
in the following terms:

We have a common cause. It is the war of poverty against
wealth. . . . In the name of the workingmen of the United
States I extend to you . . . the right hand of fellowship. Con-
tinue in the good work that you have undertaken until a.
glorious success shall crown your eiforts! Such is our resolve.
Our recent war has led to the foundation of the most in-
famous money aristocracy of the earth. . . . We have declared
war against it and we are determined to conquer——by means
of the ballot, if possible———if not, we shall resort to more
serious means. A little blood-letting is necessary in desperate
cases.

Such was the spirit of the outstanding leader of the new
movement that had set in motion a wave of eight-hour strikes
all over the country. The same leader had declared in a speech
to a workers’ meeting in Sunbury, Pa., a year earlier (1868):

No man in America rejoiced more than I at the downfall
of negro slavery. But when the shackles fell from the limbs
of those four millions of blacks, it did not make them free
men; it simply transferred them from one condition of slavery
to another. . . . We are now all one family of slaves together,
and the labor reform movement is a second emancipation
proclamation.

Marx explained this new spirit in terms of the fact that
immigration was now depositing workers in the industrial
centers faster than the Western lands could drain them oﬁ,
that the American Civil War had left behind it a colossal debt
and taxation burden and had created “a ﬁnancial aristocracy
of the meanest kind,” and that the public lands were being
gobbled up by speculators and railway and mining companies
at a headlong pace. “No longer is the Great Republic the
promised land for emigrants” (Capital, Vol. I, pp. 857-8).

19

 

The General Strike of 1877

The National Labor Union, after a meteoric rise, was
weakened by the untimely death of Sylvis, absorbed as a
political movement into the Greenback-Populist tendency and
crushed as a union organization during the depression of
187 3. But before the prolonged depression was at an end the
labor movement recovered and began a new series of struggles
in 1877. A general railway strike tied up the Baltimore &
Ohio and Pennsylvania Railways and spread to the other lines
and even to other industries such as the coal mines. For the
first time the Federal troops were called out in time of peace
to break a strike. The militia was called out in Maryland,
Pennsylvania and other States, and in some cases proved
“unreliable,” that is, fraternized with the strikers. It was this
experience which caused the terriﬁed ruling class to reorganize
the militia on the basis of class diﬁerentiation (the formation
of the “Diamond” 7th Regiment dates from this event) and
construct numerous strong armories——forts for civil warfare
—-in the industrial centers. Marx wrote to Engels in July,
187 7 :

What do you think of the workers of the United States?
This ﬁrst explosion against the associated oligarchy of capital,
which has arisen since the Civil War, will naturally again be
suppressed, but can very well form the point of origin for the
constitution of an earnest Workers’ party. The policy of the
new president will make the negroes, and the great expropria-
tions of land . . . will make the farmers of the West, who are
already very dissatisﬁed, allies of the workers.

Noteworthy in this letter are the insistence on the need for
“the constitution of an earnest workers’ party” and the possi-
bility of an alliance of the working class with the poor
farmers and the negroes. To these and related questions,
Engels returned again and again in the letters of the next
decade addressed to German Marxist immigrants in America.
They formed the center around which the tactical problems
of the American Marxists revolved, and still revolve today.

American Peculiarities:

"Contempt for Theory”

Although America is the land of most advanced capitalist ‘

industry, the American working class, measured in terms of
organization and political (i.e. class) consciousness and ideol-
ogy, is one of the most backward in the capitalist world.
It is predominantly bourgeois—minded, theoretically backward
and even dominated by a contempt for theory which makes
the development of a revolutionary movement based upon
revolutionary theory so much the more difficult.
Engels wrote to Sorge on Dec. 31, 1892:

Here in old Europe, things are livelier than in your "youth-
ful” land, which still doesn’t seem to want to outgrow its
ﬂedgling years. It is noteworthy, but quite natural in a young
land, which has never known feudalism and has grown up
from the beginning on a bourgeois foundation, that bourgeois
prejudices should be so ﬁrmly planted in the working class.
. . . The American working class imagines that the tradition-
ally inherited bourgeois society is something progressive and
superior by its very nature. and for all epochs, a non plus
ultra. . . . The Americans can struggle and squirm as they
will, they cannot discount their surely gigantic future like a
bill of exchange; they will have to wait for its due date and
precisely because its future is so great, its present must
occupy itself principally with the preliminary work for the
future, and this work is, as in every young land, predomi-
nantly material and determines a certain backwardness of
thought, a clinging to the traditions connected with the

founding of the new nationality. . . .

The roots of American “contempt for theory” lie in the
fact that the theories imported from Europe, and distilled
from European practice and experience were hopelessly at
variance with the practical conditions of this new country, with
such different (colonial and pioneer) conditions and such vast
extents of free land. Therefore, the gulf between theory and
practice, so characteristic of bourgeois thought, is enormously
widened in America.

21

 

  

 

In any land, the masses learn not so much from theory as
from experience, and it is the task of the theoretically devel-
oped Marxist to further such experience and drive home his
theories on the basis of it. ‘But in America and England (Eng-
land's “contempt for theory” has a somewhat diﬁerent basis,
the fact that it was the ﬁrst capitalist country and could not
learn from the concentrated experience, or theory, of any
other land), in England and America, Marx and Engels em-
phasized, it was especially necessary to realize that the masses
could not learn by mere preaching at them from’ outside
their ranks.

On Sept. 16, 1886, Engels wrote to Sorge:

In a country as elemental as America, which has developed
in a purely bourgeois fashion without any feudal, past, but
has taken over from England a mass of ideology‘ surviving
from the feudal period, such as English common law, religion
and sectarianism, and in which the necessity of practical work
and of the concentration of capital, has produced a general
contempt for all theories, which is only now beginning to
disappear in educated and scientiﬁc circles—in such a country
the people must come to realize their own social interests by
making mistake after mistake. Nor will the workers be spared
that; the confusion of trade—unions, socialists, Knights of
Labor, etc., will continue for some time to come, and they will
only learn by injuring themselves. But the chief thing is that
they have been set in motion. . . .

Class Stratiﬁcation

One of the principal" obstacles to the formation of a uniﬁed
working class is the division into skilled and unskilled. In
America this has been enormously intensiﬁed by the fact that
it tended to coincide with the division into native and foreign
born.

It appears to me that your great obstacle in America is
the privileged position of the native-born worker. Until 1848,
a native-born, permanent Working class was the exception
rather than the rule. The scattered beginnings of the latter
in the East and in the cities could still hope to become farmers

or members of the bourgeoisie. Such a class has now developed
and has organized itself to a large degree in trade-unions.
But it still assumes an aristocratic position, and leaves (as
it may) the ordinary, poorly—paid trades to the immigrants,
of whom only a small percentage enter the aristocratic trade-
unions. These immigrants are, however, divided into nation-
alities, which do not understand one another, and for the most
part do not understand the language of the country. And your
bourgeoisie understands even better than the Austrian gov-
ernment, how to play oﬂ one nationality against another. . . .
(Engels’ letter to Schlueter, March 30, 1892.)

Hence Engels insisted on the superior importance of "a
real mass movement amongst the English-speaking popula-
tion,” regardless of its elementary character at the beginning,
to the formation of a theoretically correct advanced party
consisting largely of immigrants. Not that the higher experi-
ence, more developed theory and revolutionary traditions of
the immigrants were worthless. Quite the contrary, if they
did not separate themselves from the native movement, they
might serve the vital r6le of

a nucleus which retains theoretical insight into the nature and
the course of the entire movement, keeps in progress the
process of fermentation and ﬁnally again comes to the top.

Class Fluiditg

A third peculiarity that American Marxists had to reckon
with (and with its ideological survivals of “cultural lag” we
still have to reckon today) is the lack of class ﬁxity which
diﬁerentiated America from Europe throughout the nine-
teenth century. As a result, Marx pointed out, the republic,
which in Europe in 1848 was a revolutionary goal, could exist
in America in “its conservative form.” And in the same
passage he adds:

. in the United States of America . . . true enough, the
classes already exist, but have not yet acquired permanent
character, are in constant ﬂux and reﬂux, constantly changing
their elements and yielding them up to one another; . . . the

23

modern means of production instead of coinciding with a stag-
nant population, rather compensate for the relative scarcity of
heads and hands; and, ﬁnally . . . the feverishly youthful life
of material production, which has to appropriate 3, new world
to itself, has so far leftlneither time nor opportunity to abolish
the illusions of old. (Eighteenth Brumaire, Kerr & Co., pp.
21-2.)

As a consequence of this class ﬂuidity which drained the
working class of its most energetic elements and promoted il-
lusions that the problems of the class could be solved by
escape from it, the formation of the working class as a class
in an ideological and political sense was enormously retarded.
The promotion of such formation, separation from the twin
parties of capitalism and the organization of the workers into
a general labor political movement of their own-—this Marx
and Engels regarded as the main task of American Marxists.
It is still the main task today.

As soon as there was a national working class movement in-
dependent of the Germans, my standpoint was clearly indi-
cated by the facts in the case. That great national movement,
no matter what its form, is the real starting point of American
working class development. If the Germans join in, in order
to help it or to hasten its development in the right direction,
they may do a great deal of good and play a decisive part in
it. If they stand aloof, they will dwindle down into a dogmatic
sect and will be brushed aside as people who do not under-
stand their» own principles. (Engels in 1887 in a letter to
Florence Kelley.) it

The Need for (2 Labor Party

The ﬁrst great step, which is of primary importance in
every country ﬁrst entering the movement, is always the con-
stitution of the workers as an independent political party, no
matter of what kind, so long as it is only a distinct workers’
party. . . . (Letter of Engels to Sorge, Nov. 29, 1886.)

On the continent (in most countries) of Europe, the Social-
ist movement developed as a mass movement prior to the con-
24!

 

.-,._. __ ,, _ _‘,,.... ._.-.r- '.‘.,,.. .-. .._,- -_ 

solidation of the trade—unions, and the unions began with a
socialist philosophy. In America (as in England) for histori-
cal reasons, the unions developed ﬁrst, while the Socialist
movements were impotent sects or non—existent. Therefore the
unions developed on the basis of bourgeois ideology and the
subordination of the working class to capitalist politics.
Hence Marx and Engels emphasized the need for a mass
labor party, "no matter what its ﬁrst form” as the “real
starting point of American working class development."

The most important thing was not the clarity of program,
but the “constitution of an earnest Workingmen's party”
(Marx). Out of this beginning and the experiences of such
a movement, out of its very blunders, would come clarity, pro-
vided only that the movement would be permanent, remain
broad and inclusive, and that the Communists would not be
too sectarian to work within it. How Engels conceived this
process of clariﬁcation and the duties of the Marxists in con-
nection with it, he explained in illuminating detail in a letter
to Florence Kelley (dated Dec. 28, 1886):

It is far more important that the movement should spread,
proceed harmoniously, take root and embrace as much as pos-
sible the whole American proletariat, than that it should
start and proceed from the beginning on theoretically per-
fectly correct lines. There is no better road to theoretical
clearness of comprehension than to learn by one’s own mis-
takes. . . . And for a Whole large class, there is no other road,

' especially for a nation so eminently practical and so con-

temptuous of theory as the Americans. The great thing is to
get the working class to move as a class; that once obtained,
they will soon ﬁnd the right direction and all who resist . . .
will be left out in the cold with small sects of their own.
Therefore I think also the Knights of Labor a most important
factor in the movement which ought not be pooh—poohed from
without but to be revolutionized from within, and I consider
that many of the Germans then have made a grievous mistake
when they tried, in the face of a mighty and glorious move-
ment not of their own creation, to make of their imported and
not always understood theory a kind of alleinseligmachendes

"dogma and to keep aloof from any movement which did not

25

 

_rr.—:»:..:-  « /

;r-_—:.—;-_.:a5_._-........ ......... u... - ......-. .

   

accept that dogma. Our theory is not a dogma but the ex-
position of a process of evolution, and that process involves
successive phases. To expect that the Americans will start
with the full consciousness of theory worked out in older in-
dustrial countries is to expect the impossible. What the Ger-
mans ought to do is to act up to their own theory—if they
understand it, as we did in 1845 and 1848-—to go in for any
real general working class movement, accept its falctischen
starting point as such and work it gradually up to the theoreti-
cal level by pointing out how every mistake made, every re-
verse suffered, was a necessary consequence of mistaken
theoretical orders in the original program. . . .

But above all, give the movement time to consolidate; do not
make the inevitable confusion of the ﬁrst start worse con-
founded by forcing down people’s throats things which, at
present, they cannot properly understand but which they
soon will learn. A million or two workingmen’s votes next
November for a bona ﬁde workingmen’s party, is worth in-
ﬁnitely more at present than a hundred thousand votes for a
doctrinally perfect program. The very ﬁrst attempt, soon to
be made if the movement progresses, to consolidate the moving
masses on a national scale, will bring them all face to face,
Georgites, K. of L., Trade—Unionists, and all . . . then will be
the time for them to criticize the views of the others and
thus, by showing up the inconsistencies of the various stand—
points, to bring them gradually to understand their own actual
position, the position made for them by the correlation of
capital and wage labor. But anything that might delay or
prevent that national consolidation of the Workingmen’s party
—on no matter what platform—I should consider a great
mistake. . . . ' ’ '?

Engels never wearied of repeating this theme. In 1887,

after much bitterness had been engendered by the shameful ‘

attitude of the A. F. of L., Knights of Labor, and Henry
George movements toward the Haymarket martyrs, Engels
still supported Aveling (Marx’s son-in-law) against the sec~
tarian tactics of the National Executive Committee of the
Socialist Labor Party:

I think all our practice has shown that it is possible to
26

 9.‘... ..

work along with the general movement of the working class
at every one of its stages without giving up or hiding our own
distinct position and even organization. (Letter to Florence
Kelley, Jan. 27, 1887.)

And in his pamphlet on the American labor movement
Engels Wrote:

. the uniﬁcation of the various independent bodies into
one national Labor Army, with no matter how inadequate a
provisional platform, provided it be truly a working class
platform——that is the next great step to be accomplished in
America. (The Labor Movement in America, published in
1887, reprinted in Workers Age, April 9 and April 16, 1982.)

With withering scorn Engels condemned the sectarianism of
the American “Marxists” who “do not understand their own
theory.”

In spite of all, the masses can only be set in motion in a
Way suitable to the respective countries and adapted to the
prevailing conditions———and this is usually a roundabout Way.
But everything else is of minor importance if only they are
really aroused. (Letter to Sorge, Sept. 16, 1887.)

This breath of living Marxism contrasts strangely with the
official outcries against “exceptionalism” today and with the
sectarian tactical conception that What is desirable is a maxi-
mum program with minimum masses in motion, Whereas Marx
and Engels demanded a minimum program With maximum
masses in motion.

Engels seems to be talking of the last four years of dog-
matic “correctness,” and sectarian impotence of the oﬂicial
Communist Party today, when he writes:

It proves how useless is a platform——for the most part theo-
retically correct—if it is unable to get into contact with the
actual needs of the people. (Letter to Sorge, April 8, 1891.)

movement appears, may become a hindrance to further
development of such a movement and thus a reactionary force.

The development of socialist sectarianism and that of the
real labor movement are always in inverse ratio to each other.
As long as sects are justiﬁed (historically) the working class
is still unripe for an independent historical movement. As
soon as it attains to that ripeness all sects are essentially 
reactionary. (Letter of Marx to Bolte, Nov. 23, 1871.) 

 

Marxists can make their superior theoretical knowledge of
use to the backward labor movement, only if they are inside
of it:

v... . _._....i. . . _.

. with trade-unions and such like, must be the beginning,
if there is to be a mass movement, and every step forward :
must be forced upon them by a defeat. But, after the ﬁrst step
beyond the bourgeois viewpoint has been made, things will
move faster, just like everything in America . . . and then the
foreign element in the nation will make its inﬂuence felt by
its greater mobility. (Letter of Engels to Sorge, Feb. 8, 1890.)

Engels sums up his and Marx's conception on the danger of
sectarianism in a letter to Florence Kelley, Jan. 27, 1887:

V“~é<-;~<—1>-»—‘T-1*

The movement in America, just at this moment, is I believe
best seen from across the ocean. On the spot personal bicker-
ings and local disputes must obscure much of the grandeur of
it. And the only thing that could really delay its march would
be the consolidation of these differences into established sects. 
To some extent, that will be unavoidable, but the less of it,
the better. . . .

Our theory is a theory of development, not of dogma to be
learned by heart and repeated mechanically. The less it is
hammered into the Americans from the outside and the more
they test it through their own experience, the more it will
become part of their ﬂesh and blood. . . .

Perspective: Amerz'ca’s International Réle

Towards the close of Engels’ life he sensed a change in the
28

5...

,.,,.'_,..

world situation and a change in America’s position~——conse-
quences of the epoch of imperialism, and World wars about to
burst as the ﬁnal stage of capitalism and the fearful signs of
its death agony. As early as 1890, Engels, armed with the
weapon of historical materialism, was enabled to foresee the
coming developments, trace the very groupings of the coming
world War, which, a quarter century later, still took non-
Marxist historians, liberals and opportunist Socialists by
surprise!

In an article On the Foreign Policy of Russian Czarism
(Neue Zeit, Vol. 8, p. 145 and 193), Engels wrote that the
annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. and the Russian drive for Con-
stantinople were creating groupings which would convert
Europe into two great military encampments, make Russia
into an ally of France against Germany and drive Austria,
and perhaps Italy, into an alliance with Germany. "Both
camps are preparing for a decisive struggle, for a War such as
the world has never seen, where ten to ﬁfteen million armed
warriors face each other.” The chief guarantee against such a
war would be a revolution in Russia (Engels’ sensitivity to
revolutionary situations made him feel the first faint breeze of
the coming storms of‘ 1905 and 1917). “The fall of the Czarist
autocracy in Russia would, however, directly accelerate this
process.” (Revolution in the rest of Europe, especially Ger-
many.) At the same time, the revolutionary situation in Russia
was transferring the center of reaction also to the republics
and limited monarchies of Europe, and “perhaps they would
be capable of marching their armies into Russia, to restore the
authority of the Czar—-what irony of World history!” And
What prophetic sense!

In 1891 Engels warned the German working class of its
revolutionary duty in the coming world War. But as early as
Jan. 7, 1888 he had" written to Sorge in America what the
probable effects of such a European war would be upon
America’s World position:

If the war would be fought to a ﬁnish without inner move-
ments (revolution in Russia or Germany in particular—
29

 

 

B.D.W.), a state of exhaustion would result such as Europe
has not experienced for two hundred years. American indus-
try would then win all along the line. . . .

What would the eﬁect of this world hegemony be upon the
retarded and painfully slow development of the American
working class? Would America’s hegemony be as complete or

last as long as had England’s in the preceding epoch? Would,

it corrupt and bourgeoisify the American working class for as
long and to the extent that it had the British so that Engels
had been moved to say that there would be no socialism in
Great Britain worthy of the name until Britain lost her hegem-
ony to Germany or America? To these questions Engels
answered in the negative:

America will destroy England’s industrial monopoly——-as
much as is left of it—but America cannot itself enter into
possession of the heritage of this monopoly. And if no one
land alone possesses the monopoly of the markets of the
World, at least in the decisive branches of trade, then the
——relatively favorable—conditions which existed in England
from 1848 to 1870 cannot be reproduced anywhere, and even
in America the conditions of the Working class must sink
progressively lower and lower. For when three countries (let
us say: England, America and Germany) compete with each
other under comparatively equal conditions for the possession
of the world market, then there is no way out but chronic
overproduction, since any one of the three countries is capable
of meeting the entire demand. Therefore I contemplate devel-
opment of the present crisis with greater interest than ever,
and therefore I believe it will announce an epoch in the
spiritual and political history of the American and English
working classes—whose assistance is as necessary as it is
desirable. (Letter to Florence Kelley, Feb. 3, 1886.)

Again Engels is a little premature as to the tempo of de-
velopment, but brilliant in the accuracy of his forecast. What
an admirable picture the above furnishes of the postwar period
and the main political—economic features of the present crisis!

“Whose assistance is as necessary as it is desirable,” wrote

80

 

Engels in the letter quoted above. He was beginning to fore-
see the international r6le that America was destined to assume
and the international r6le that history was assigning to the
American working class:

.What the breakdown of Russian czarism (how the prophe-
cies are linked !——B.D.W.) would be for the great military
monarchs of Europe—the snapping of their mainstay——that
is for the bourgeoisie of the whole world the breaking out of

‘ class War in America. For America after all was the ideal of

all the bourgeoisie: a country rich, vast, expanding, with
purely bourgeois institutions unleavened by feudal remnants
or monarchical traditions and without a permanent and hered-
itary proletariat. Here every one would become, if not a
capitalist, at all events an independent man, producing or
trading, with his own means, for his own account. And because
there were not, as yet, classes with opposing interests, our-
and your—bourgeois thought that America stood above class
antagonisms and struggles. The delusion has now broken
down, the last bourgeois Paradise on earth is fast changing
into a Purgatorio, and can only be prevented from becoming
like Europe, an Inferno, by the go-ahead pace at which the
development of the newly-ﬂedged proletariat of America will
take place. (Letter to Florence Kelley, June 3, 1886.)

Such is the analysis, such is the r6le, which the founders of
scientiﬁc Socialism assigned, which history itself has assigned
to the American working class. The predictions of Marx and
Engels, although with retarded tempo, have all been veriﬁed.
Industrialization has indeed taken place “with seven—league
boots”; slavery has been abolished; class ﬂuidity has come to
an end; the frontier has disappeared; the split between skilled
and unskilled, native and foreign, negro and white, is yielding
to growing homogeneity; America has ceased to be the “prom-
ised land” for the immigrant; negroes and working farmers
are being radicalized and developing a feeling for the need
of alliance with the workers against the “associated oligarchy

 of capital”; the Paciﬁc has come to play its prophesied r6le;
' America has attained to stormy and contested world hegemony,

81

 

and a permanent working class has been formed. All the ob-
jective conditions are present for'the American working class
to achieve its historic destiny. Only the subjective factors are
still lagging: ﬁrst, “the constitution of an earnest ‘workers’
party” in the sense of a labor party and union movement “of

practically the whole class of American wage workers”; and, A

second, the development in its midst, of a “nucleus” of “theo-
retically clear ﬁghters,” free from sectarianism. and oppor-
tunism, who know how to analyze the problems facing the
American working class, how “to accept its actual starting
point" and “work along with the general movement’ of the
working class.~.at every one of its stages without giving up or
hiding their own distinct position and organization,” who
“understand their own principles” and know how to “use their
theory as a lever to set the American masses in motion”—~in
short a Marxist Communist Party worthy of the name. To
create these subjective conditions the absorption of the Writ-
ings of Marx and Engels on America, the developing of their
fragmentary hints (fragments of a gigantic structure), the
mastery of their method, are an essential aid. Their writings
seem strangely fresh today because the suggestions they
offered have not yet been accepted, the problems they an-
alyzed have not yet been solved. Marxists in America can
make no more ﬁtting observation of the ﬁftieth anniversary of
the death of Marx than by possessing themselves of that rev-
olutionary heritage and making it their own——-their own, and
the heritage of the American working class as a whole.

The "Dz'Jco'ver_y” of America

To tell the truth, the Germans have not been able to use
their theory (Ma,racz'sm—-B.D.W.) as a lever to set the Ameri-
can masses in motion. To a great extent they do not under-
stand the theory themselves and treat it in a,doctrinairc and
dogmatic fashion as if it were something which must be com-
mitted to memory, and which then suﬁices for all purposes
without further ado. For them it is a credo, not a guide for
action. .

So wrote Engels to Sorge in 1886, indignant at the me-
chanical and doctrinaire fashion in which the German “Marx-
ist” immigrants Were transplanting to America the formulae
and methods appropriate to the German Working class.

Marxism, as the theory and practice of the class struggle,
has nothing in common with sectarianism. It is no dogma but
a guide to action. It envisages not the logic—chopping, creed-
reciting and conceit of sterile sects, but the action of great
masses, of an entire class and its allies. The interests of the
masses are its starting point; the action of masses its driving
force, and indissoluble connection with the masses is the con-
dition of its growth and the law of its being. “Theory be-
comes a material force as soon as it takes possession of the
masses.” Such is Marx's own conception of the Marxian

theory.

Mara: and "E.zcept2'onalism”

Why did the American “Marxists” of German origin fail to
inﬂuence and lead the young American working class just be-
ginning to feel its power and to organize on a national scale
in the last quarter of the 19th century? Primarily because
they failed utterly to make a realistic analysis of American
conditions, of the speciﬁc national characteristics and pecu-

liarities of the country in which they sought to give their
correct general theory concrete application. They never even
raised the question of "American peculiarities,” except in the
sense of abusing and condemning the American working class
whose movement they were seeking to fashion and lead. Yet,
the general theory of Marxism is the result of vast powers of
generalization distilled from the investigation of concrete
reality and becomes a guide to action only in so far as it is
concretely applied to concrete situations realistically grasped
and analyzed. The strategy and tactics of class War, like
strategy and tactics generally, require not only a training in
“military science” or theory, but also a detailed knowledge of
the terrain in which it is to be applied and the forces with
which it works and with which it has to contend.

This requires in the ﬁrst place, an analysis of the special
development and peculiar features of American capitalism, and
in this sense, except for fragmentary hints from the pens
of Marx, Engels and Lenin, and partial beginnings made
recently by certain American Marxians, the development of
"American Marxism” (in the sense of the application of
Marxian theory to the analysis of American conditions) has
scarcely begun. In fact, the official theoreticians of American
communism do not at present seem to grasp the necessity for
such an analysis, and condemn the very planting of the
problem as “American exceptionalism.” Yet this so-called
“exceptionalism” is of the essence of Marxism and the “arch-
exceptionalist” is none other than Marx himself.

This (the uniformity of a general development which Marx
has just discussed—B.D.W.) does not prevent the same eco-
nomic basis from showing inﬁnite variations and gradations in
its appearance, even though its principal conditions are every-
where the same. This is due to innumerable outside circum-
stances, natural environment, race peculiarities, outside his-
torical inﬂuences and so forth, all of which must be ascertained
by careful analysis. (Capital, Vol. III, p. 919.)

And again:

This is not enough for my critics; they are pleased to trans-
6

 

form my historical sketch of the origin of capitalism in
Western Europe into a general historical-philosophical theory,
claiming to prescribe an unchangeable course of development
for all peoples without any consideration for the special con-
ditions of their historical existence. (Letter to Michailovsky.)

There are no major writings of Marx dealing speciﬁcally
with America. He was primarily absorbed in the centers of
European revolutionary development in his time, Germany
and France; and for an analysis of capitalism in its “pure”
(i.e. most developed and therefore most revealing) form, his
laboratory was England. His interest in America, especially
prior to the Civil War, was primarily an interest in the effect
of American events upon European development, and it was
only after the removal of the ﬁrst International to America
and the development of the strike waves of the late '80’s and
’90’s that there are any recommendations on tactical questions
of the American movement from the pens of Marx and Engels.

Early Period: International R6le of America

When, in January 1848, the Manifesto (Communist Mum'-
festo——'B.D.W.) made its ﬁrst appearance in the world, the
proletarian movement was conﬁned to a limited ﬁeld of
operations. This is plainly shown in the last section, which is
entitled: Attitude of the Communists towards the various Op-
position Parties. There is no mention either of Russia or of
the United States in the section——noteWorthy omissions. At
the time when the Manifesto was composed, Russia constituted
the last great bulwark of European reaction, and the United
States absorbed, in the form of countless emigrants, the sur-
plus of the European proletariat. Both countries provided
Western Europe with raw materials, and simultaneously, both
countries served as markets for the sale of European manu-
factured goods. Both, therefore, in one way or another, were
pillars of the European social order.

What a change has taken place since then! European emi-
gration has promoted the unprecedented growth of agriculture
in North America, which in its turn, by becoming a competitor
of European agriculture, has shaken the landed interests of
