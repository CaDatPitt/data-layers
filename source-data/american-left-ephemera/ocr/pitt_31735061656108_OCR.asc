* THE SAME ANVIL

And the Negro Workers of Georgia and De-
troit and Harlem and Mississippi know that
the chains which enslave the darker peoples of
other ‘lands are forged on the same anvil of «
bigotry and economic exploitation which fash-
ions the chains of American Jim Crow.

The very fact that this conference is being
held demonstrates that the Negro workers are

not waiting. They have waited too long for their
inalienable right of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness. N 0, they are not waiting, They
are impatiently demanding.

Yes, the temper and position of the Negro
people has changed . . . and it is continuing
to change. And I say to the white trade union-
ists — we had better change, too.

Whenever and wherever there has been
genuine unity of Negro and white workers,
unity of the kind we are talking about here —
unity around a program of action -— Whenever
there has been that kind of unity, the whole
country has moved ahead. L »

There was that kind of unity in the period
just after the Emancipation Proclamation. And
both the white AND Negro Workers of this
country made great strides forward. There was
also that kind of genuine unity between Negro
and white workers under F. D. R. in the 1930’s
— and ‘brother, how we did move then!

‘A’ ALL HELD BACK

On the other hand, wherever there has been
no unity between Negro and white workers,
there the Negroes have been kept back and the
whiteworkers have been pulled back, too!

Now this is a big and important idea, an
9

idea which white workers must be made to un-
derstand clearly — and quickly. What this
means is that the fight for Negro rights is not
a matter of big brotherhood, or paternalism, or
generosity on the part of White workers. It’s a
matter of life or death for the white workers
themselves.

The white supremacists and their political
stooges do not intend that the trigger, the lash
and the noose shall be reserved for Negroes
only. They intend that ALL workers shall feel
the lash of reaction — if they do not comply.

They intend to divide us on any grounds they
can.

Now as far as the white leaders of the trade
unions are concerned, there is a record. And if
We look at the record of most-of the big and im-
portant unions, What do we find? '

We find that there is a great deal of talk

, about the need to-fight for the rights of Negro

workers. We find that committees are set up,
civil rights directors are appointed, speeches
are made, resolutions are passed.

Oh, there are a goodly number of labor
leaders who capture the headlines with state-
ments that the Negro must_ be given more
equality as an answer to “communist propa-
ganda.” In one breath these labor leaders are
making" two damaging admissions.

* AN ADMISSION

First, they're .admitting that there is dis-
crimination against the Negro people and that
they have done nothing, as _labor leaders, to stop
it. And second. they’re admitting they have no
desire to do anything in ‘order to strengthen
the Negro as an ally in the fight for better liv-
ing standards for ALL Americans.

In effect, they're saying that they Want
desperately to hold on to the handle of red-

11

 

 
 

baiting which becomes more and more feeble
every time they use it.
But nothing happens.

The white labor leaders — and some of
them head very big unions — somehow find it
possible to make a lot of noise about how we
have got to overcome discrimination in this
country. But the jim crow locals are still there.
The policy of “last hired and first fired” is still
there. The segregated toilets are still in the back
of the shop. The dual wage scale still prevails.
The lily-white international executive boards
are still in business.

But-these same white labor leaders will tell
you, and they will be very loud and surprised
when they say it: “What do you mean, I’m not
delivering on the question of Negro rights?
Why, we hired a Negro stenographer just the
other day. We had a big article about discrimi-
nation and equilty in our union paper. Why,
we eliminated discrimination in the bowling
alleys all over the country — not in our unions
——- but in the bowling alleys. Surely, We’re doing
everything We can!”

The fact is that these White labor leaders
have done nothing in the real fight for the
rights of Negro workers — and they don’t in-
tend to do anything. They will concoct a hund-
red window-dressing campaigns to make a noise

12

 

  

intended to fool some people into believing they
are doing something.

* IGNORE REAL JOB

But they ignore; the real job — the fight
for Negro rights in the shop and in the com-
munity around the shop. When it comes to pro-
viding leadership for the in-fighting against
employers, these hypocrites are missing.

Now I want to make it clear that I think
white workers have a great responsibility in
the larger campaigns — the struggles that are
conducted on a national or regional basis. They

can do a great deal in the fight for the right of ,

Negro families to live in white communities.
They can do a great deal when it comes to send-
ing petitions and telegrams and mobilizing pro-
test delegations in cases like those of the Mar-
tinsville Seven, Willie McGee, the Trenton Six,
and the fight against fascist terrorism in
Cicero, Illinois.

These campaigns are important. They con-
tribute to the overall fight for full freedom for
the Negro people. And many thousands of pro-
gressive white trade unionists have engraved
an honorable record of the part they have
played in them. A

But these campaigns are no substitute for
the day-to-day fight for Negro workers in our

13

 

    

 

own back yard. They don’t excuse the white
worker_ from taking on a fight to see to it that
his Negro brothers and sisters can eat in the
same restaurant he uses right next to the shop
where they Work together. They don’t take the
place of job action to guarantee that a Negro is
up-graded. They don’t mean We can duck the
fight for FEP clauses in our contracts.

‘A’ TRADE UNION DUTY

What I’m saying is that the white union
leaders have a responsibility to fight as trade
unionists for the rights of Negro workers as
trade unionists. More than that, it’s a matterof
cold self-interest,’ self-preservation of them-
selves and their unions for them to press that
fight just as hard as they can.

I have beentrying to say that when white
workers join in campaignsfor the liberation of
their fellow freedom-fighters, the white work-

ers are helping themselves. Nowhere is this _

better illustrated than in the deep South . . .
and for two very. important reasons.

One reason is that when the fight for the
elementary right of Negro Workers to vote in
the South is won — and it will be won — there
will be an immediate change in the political bal-
ance of power, not just in the South but all over
the nation. Because when the poll tax goes, the

14.

strangle-hold of the poll—tax Congressmen on
our government will be broken. That will open
the doors for a whole series of changes in the
political complexion of this land.

The second reason is that the economic
balance of power is changing in the South. More

 

and more northern corporations are “decentral-
izing their operations — which means moving
them to the South where they hope to exploit
cheap labor, caused by the division between
Negro and white workers. That means unem-
ployment in the North, and vicious exploitation
of Negro and white worker in the South. The
answer, so far as the white worker — both
North and South — is concerned, is to guarantee
that the Southern wage differential is wiped
out. That means a joint fight — with Negro
and white worker campaigning together in the
same union — to bust the Southern differen-
tial. ‘

‘A’ A FOOLISH NOTION

There are not very many white workers
left by now who harbor the illusion, the foolish
notion that they have an identity of interest
with employers. Every step that’s been taken
since the war drive began has made it clearer
and clearer that the employers are out to
destroy our living standards, wipe out even the
most elementary of our civil rights, put our sons
in uniform and send them to some foreign soil
to kill and be killed.

The employers — and the men who speak
for them in government —— have made it clear
that they are determined to have those profits,

16

no matter what it costs in terms of sacrifice by
American workers.

And when the employers — acting through
their agent in Government, Charles E. Wilson
— impose a Wage freeze, the freeze does not dis-
tinguish between White Workers and Negroes.
It does not say: We will hold down the Wages
of one group and raise the Wages of the other.
No, it says this Wage freeze is democratic —
everybody is frozen stiff as a mackerel.

How do you fight that kind of business?
You fight it by uniting with every ally you can
find to smash the wage freeze. A white worker
would be an awful dumb-bell if he rejected the
willingness of the Negro worker to join him in
a drive to smash the wage freeze.

And how does one do his part to help make
sure that the Negro is in a position to fight the
wage freeze — and all the other devices that
are used to keep down the Worker, Negro and
white alike? How does the White Worker and
labor leader do his part to help mow down the
barriers that stand in the path of the Negro
worker?

* SOME NECESSARY TOOLS

First of all, white Workers have a_responsi-
bility to join the fight for placing the same
tools in the hands of his Negro brother that he
himself has. One of those tools is a job. ‘Another
of those tools is membership in a trade union —
full membership. Still another tool is the right
to advance into positions of leadership in the
union.

.These are three elementary tools which the
Negro Worker must have if he’s going to fight
effectively against those enemies he has in
common with the White worker. So you see
what’ I mean when I say that it’s a matter of

18

 

  

 

    

 

cold self-interest for the white worker to jump
off his pinnacle of paternalism and join his
Negro brother in a genuine brand of unity.

Now, most of the white labor leaders give
at least lip-service to the notion that the Negro
worker has a right to a job. And a few of them
are willing to admit that the Negro ought to
have membership in a local union that is not
jim crow. But it is on the issue of permitting
Negroes to advance into positions of leadership
that so many white leaders begin to burrow
under the rug, and find excuses, and reasons
why\not, and let’s not be in too big a hurry.

* THE TIME IS NOW!

I say the time is now. Not tomorrow, or
next month, or after the next five-year contract
expires. But now. If anybody wants to argue
with me that Negro workers aren't ready to
assume positions of union leadership, I’ll tell
him he’s a plain damned fool. '

Who is better qualified as‘ a labor leader
than Asbury Howard, our Mine-Mill regional
director in the deep South. Who is better quali-
fied than Raymond Dennis, our International
Executive Board Member in the middle west?
Who is better qualified than anyone of dozens
of Negro workers in this hall?

19

  

Any white Worker or white labor leader

-who says he believes in equality for Negro

    

workers, and then says there doesn’t happen to
be any Negro in his union “ready for leader-
ship” is just trying to_ duck a fight. In effect,
he’s saying, there may be a few White members
in the union who might object — so why make
a fuss? '

It doesn’t seem to occur to those white
leaders that nothing can mobilize and rally the
Negro worker so much as the sure knowledge
that there are Negroes among the leaders in
his union — from top to bottom.

A There are also the white labor leaders who
advance the stupid and malicious argument
that any attempt to advance Negroes into union
leadership is “Jim Grow in reverse.” You only
have to take a brief glance behind that notion
to see just one more example of White suprem-
acy.

* A SIMPLE PROBLEM

There is only one approach to the question
of Negro leadership in trade unions. It is the
approach that insists on advancement of Ne-
groes into positions of leadership — at every
level — in the interests of both White and Negro
Workers. It’s that simple.

Once the Negro worker begins to develop
20

 

stature as a leader in the labor movement, his
union — and that includes the white leaders in
his union — have a special obligation that goes
beyond the union. That’s the obligation to make
sure that the Negro labor leader is given time
and opportunity to develop as a leader in the
Negro community — as a leader in the fight for
Negro liberaticﬁi on ALL fronts. .

The hour is late. The corporations are be-
coming more and more arrogant, getting tough-
er and tougher. As they see it, they’re in the
saddle, and they intend to wring out everything
they can get, even if it means war.

Now, I don’t know whether or not the big

shots. in the corporations welcome the idea of

another war. But I do know that they welcome
— and insist on — the idea of an ever-increas-
ing program of armaments and overseas bases.
And it’s very clear why they insist on such a
gigantic and costly arms program — paid out of
the pockets and the sweat of American workers.
First, they look upon it as the only alternative
to a depression. And second, they are convinced
that a huge arms program is the only effective

way to win control of every market in the world. i

* JOBS AT STAKE

What that means — to the white and
21

  

Negro worker alike -— is easy to see. Workers

 

in one of the plants covered by my union are '

losing their jobs because the plant ‘cannot com-
pete with cheaply-made products imported from
occupied Japan. And it goes Without saying that

V a MacArthur-trained police force and army of R _

occupation make sure the Workers of Japan
have been stripped of the right to strike for
decent Wages.

No matter how you look at it, neither the

workers of the American-"controlled colonial _
areas, nor those here at home gain anything in ‘

this game. They only lose.
We’ve got to get moving, if we’re going to

_ bust up this plot. We’ve got to leave the plan-

ning and talking stage, and get into action -
fast. _
Now is the time for the white Worker to

make it clear — once and for all — that they

welcome the idea of unity with Negro workers.
Now is the time for them to make clear that
they look upon Negro-white unity as a matter

_of mutual responsibility. After all, any alliance, _

byfits very nature, means responsibility on both

"sides.

 

The white Workers Who are here at this
conference have a special responsibility. They
have the job of going back to their homes, to
their unions, and campaigning for Negro-white

  

    

  

unity — not among the Negro workers — but
among the white workers.

* NEGROES

There has never been any doubt in my mind
that Negro workers Welcome the idea of unity
with White workers. And if there was any
doubt anywhere, the very fact of this confer-
ence should end it, for good and all. The job
that needs to be done is among the White Work-
ers — and that’s" our job.

The National Negro Labor Council which
is being founded here is primarily a movement
of Negro Workers —_ Negro freedom-fighters.
It is being led, and will be led, by Negroes. They
will unite the Negro Workers around a program
of action, which is the way it should be done.

But the responsibility of White workers
here is to guarantee that White Workers be
brought into the united struggle with Negro
Workers for Negro rights. Unless they do that,

 

the white labor leaders will have forfeited the .
right to speak of Negro-White unity.

There are — fortunately not at this meet-
ing — some white labor leaders who have al-
ready tried to smear this movement by calling
it dual unionism. Now dual unionism is a catch-
word which is usually used by labor phonies

23_

when they see something done which they
should have done themselves. But I don’t see
any new labor federation being organized here.
I don’t see any new international or national
union being founded here.

All I see is the beginning of a movement
that should have been sparked and initiated
long ago. The cry of dual unionism is no more
than a feeble attempt to find a closet in which
to hide the skeletons of past failures.

‘A’ NEVER TRIED BEFORE

It seems to me there is something very
special about this convention. This is an his-
toric meeting. We are here at the birth of a
movement that has no parallel in the Whole
history of our country. What is being done here
has never been tried before.

I don’t need to tell you that this meeting is
taking place in an historic city —- the site of an
important Way-station in the Underground
Railroad during the long struggle against
slavery. .

One of the men who made his very special
contribution to the struggle against slavery was
John Brown. Now John Brown was not a dip-
lomat. And he certainly was not a talker or
speech-maker. As a matter of fact we are told

24

by the history books that John Brown was not
the kind of man who would use two words
where one would do.

But John Brown was a man of courage, of
conscience, and above all, a man of action. He
was a man of principle. If a thing was right, it
was right — there could be no compromise. He
hated slavery, so he took himself to the very
heart-land of slavery and made a dramatic at-
tempt to smash slavery at one blow — by taking
away the weapons that were required to up-
hold it.

‘It JOHN BROWN'S HERITAGE

There are some who say that John Brown
failed in his glorious attempt to smash slavery.

But what John Brown did gave heart and spirit

to the Negroes all over the South. When they
heard the story of John Brown — they knew
they had white allies, they knew that slavery
could and would be destroyed. And what John
Brown said at the last shines through even
today — in the temper and spirit of this con-
ference. He said:

“If it is deemed necessary that I should
forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends
of justice, and mingle my blood with the blood
of my children and with the blood of millions

25

 
  

in this slave country whose rights are disre-
garded by wicked, cruel and unjust enactments,
I say, let it be done.” '

This is a time for new John Browns to
arise, up and down the land. And I am convinced
that out of this conference will come a whole
army of—John Browns, men who are dedicated
not to talk and double’-talk, but to action. Men
of principle and of conscience Who are convinced
that jim crow can be licked, and that the time
has come to lick it, so that the Negro can take
his full and rightful place as a first class citizen
of this land — with full social, economic, politi-
cal, and civil rights.

The time is ripe. Let's go! ..

  
  
 

   
 
 
 
 

THE END

 

  

Let me give you a word of the philosophy of
reforms. The whole history of the progress of
human liberty shows that all concessions, yet

-made to her august claims, have be-en born of

earnest struggle. The conflict has been exciting,
agitating, and all-absorbing, and for the time
being putting all other tumults to silence. It
must do this or it does nothing. If there is no
struggle, there is no progress. Those who pro-
fess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agi-
tation, are men who want crops without plow-
ing up the ground. They want rain without
thunder, and lightning. They want the ocean
without the awful roar of its many waters. This
struggle may be both moral and physical; but it
must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing
without a demand. It never did, and it never
will.

MAURICE E. TRAVIS

Inte'r'na‘ti0nal Secreta.7'y-Treasurer
International Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers

Maurice E. Travis was born April 24, 1910 at
Spokane, Wash. He was educated at St. Mary’s College
prep school, then in Oakland, Calif., and at the State
Teacher’s College San
Jose, Calif. It was while
attending school that he
made his first contact with
the labor movement.

In subsequent years,
“Trav” worked in harvest
fields, orchards, logging
camps, steel mills, and fac-
tories. He has been an
actor, a truck driver, and
a printer.

From 1939 to 1941,
Brother Travis was secre-
tary of the Contra Costa
CIO Council in California.
He s e r v e d for several
years as a member of the
executive b 0 a r d of the
California Industrial
Council, CIO.

He has held more positions and offices with the
International Union of Mine Mill and Smelter Workers .
than any other member. He has been international
representative, regional director, international execu-

tive board member, international president, interna-
tional vice-president, and was recently re-elected in an

 

  

 

international referendum to another term as interna-
tional secretary-treasurer.

Brother Travis has a well-earned reputation as a
fighter for Negro rights. He is a member‘ of the execu-
tive board of the National Negro Labor Council. His
participation in the crusade for Negro liberation re-
ceived international publicity in 1949 when he was
beaten almost to death by a gang of white supremacists
in an Alabama radio station during a raid on his
union by the CIO officialdom. He lost an eye in that
encounter. The patch he has worn since then is his
badge of honor.

Now Is the Time!

rothers and Sisters: I was deeply moved
when I received the invitation to appear
here. This conference was called by — and is
devoted to —— Negro workers, who came here
to discuss the crucial issues Which grow out of
their life-and-death struggle against White
man’s justice. Because you have asked me to
speak here as a white trade unionist, I feel a
grave sense of responsibility.

The first thing I Want to say is that if I
am able to speak heretoday as a leader of a
union which has in the past year had some taste
of victory over formidable enemies, it is in
large measure because of the courage, under-
standing and militance of thousands of Negro
and Mexican-American members in my union.
However, we still have a big job to do in my
union.

What I have to say here today flows direct-
ly from the deeper understanding of my respon-
sibilities as a white labor leader as a result of
what the Negro and Mexican-American mem-
bers of my union have taught me.

I didn’t come here to tell the Negro work-
ers of America, or their leaders, what to do. I
didn’t come to orate about the problems of the

5

 

 
 

Negro people and hand out a fancy custom-built
set of answers designed to wash away all these
problems — like Tide, the Washday Wonder.

Here on the stage, and out there, is a great
abundance of genuine Negro leadership. Here
are the real leaders of the Negro workers in
America. They know what must be done, and
they are ready, willing and very, very able to
do it.

‘A’ TO WHITE UNIONISTS

What I've got to say is aimed at the white
trade unionists —— rank-and-file white workers
and their leaders—here and around the country.

How have we always talked about Negro-
white unity in the past? We’ve talked about it
on the basis of white joining to help the Ne-
groes win their just rights. The big white bro-
thers, holding out a generous, fatherly hand, to
lift up the Negroes. And, of course, as long as
that approach was used, the Negroes somehow
never got lifted up. _ . . .

I think it’s about time that whiteworkers
and their leaders registered a fact of life. It’s
time for them to agree that a change has taken
place in the World. It’s time for them to under-
stand that all over the world, the white man is
being tested. Millions of people in Asia, Africa,
South America, the Pacific, are taking a very

 

  

 

close look to see if the white man means what
he says when he talks about democracy and
equality. .,

Here in the United States that World-Wide
test is being made in a very pointed Way. Mil-
lions of people all over the World and right here
in America —- are taking a close look to see how
the Negro Worker gets along in this country
Where there is so much talk of democracy.

It’s no secret to anyone in this hall that the
United States is flunking the test miserably, in
spite of the super—salesmen Who clog the air-
Ways With protestations.
