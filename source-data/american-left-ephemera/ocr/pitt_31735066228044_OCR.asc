When his term of imprisonment was about to expire, the

BroWder’s Policy Vindicated

The ‘case of Earl Browder is no less a political matter than

. the case of Matthew Lyon. Nor is the pretext upon which
i‘ he was sentenced to prison any less ﬂimsy. In the eyes of the

appeasers, and the infamous Dies Committee, Earl Browder
has been guilty of one particularly unforgivable “crime”—
he has dared to advocate friendship and collaborationwith
the Soviet Union in the interests of American national se-
curity. '

' _That may appear to be a “crime" in their eyes, but is there

anyone in American public life, except friends of Hitler, will-

tect American interests. The will of the people prevailed.
Jefferson's battle to prevent the United States from becoming
a partner in crime of the reactionary British Tories ended in
his election ‘to the Presidency of the United States.

Just as the Jeffersonian policy of friendship with revolu-
tionary France aided in defending the independence of
America, the policy which Earl Browder advocated so long and
eloquently, of alliance between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.,

. has proved to be the only means of defending our independ-

ence today. And as the policy of Jefferson was vindicated by
the people in his election to the Presidency, so also has the
policy of Browder been vindicated. It is today the official
policy of our government and of every patriotic American
citizen.
Red—Baiting Exposed.

If this had been his only contribution to our nation Earl
Browder would still deserve a place among those needed to
win victory. This is no time to deprive ourselves of the service

of such a man. National unity will be harmed by keeping
a staunch anti-fascist defender of the country in prison. Brow-

_ der was put in prison primarily by the efforts of those who op-

posed the alliance with the Soviet Union upon which our
very life depends. What a victory for the appeaser enemies
of our country! Every day that Browder remains in prison is
aid and comfort to the Hitler ﬁfth column ,that even today
tries to drive a wedge between us and our alliesl
A As a testimonial to that fact, growing numbers of citizens
in all walks of life are urging the President to free him.
Much to the dismay of the appeasers and of those who kow-
tgw to them, the rising wave of protest against the unjust
' ~risonment of Earl Browder is gaining momentum day by

day. This was begrudgingly admitted recently by the New
York World Telegram and Daily Mirror when they broke
their long conspiracy of silence about the Free Browder
Campaign. They revealed that the day of the President's
birthday ball, the White House was “ﬂooded with messages
urging the immediate release of Earl Browder" and that "tens
of thousands of individual telegrams and hundreds of thous-
ands of postcards” will go to the White House. They oblig-
ingly listed a few of the individuals who have advocated free—
ing Browder, acknowledging them to be “non-Communistsf’,
Among those the Telegram names are “former Republican
Senator George Wharton Pepper, the Rev. Harry Emerson
Fosdick, Episcopal Bishop Edward L. Parsons, Dr. A. A. Brill,
honory chairman of the American Psychoanalytic Associa-
tion, the head of the Missouri State Grange, the President of
the Yonkers Board of Education, James T. Shottwell, presi-
dent of the League of Nations Association" and a number of
illustrious names among whom not the least well known is

iTom Mooney. V
And then, proving that the day of miracles is not past, '

they conclude that this is nothing more than a “red plot" in
which these respectable citizens were somehow inveigled under

a false pretext! Surely not even they have the colossal nerve, »

to claim that these individuals who signed petitions to free
Earl Browder don't know that he is a Communist!

“Appeasement Jitters”

What is it that has produced this absurd idea? Obviously
the appeasers are deeply disturbed by the fact that millions rec-

ognize the injustice done to Browder as a severe blow against .4’

the rights of the people. Instead of concluding from this that/’
the people's will should be done, they attempt to stop the

for Browder’s release by creating the impression that only
the “reds" are concerned.

There is ample reason here for a case of “appeasement
jitters.” It proves that the principal’ weapon employed by
the Hitler ﬁfth column to divide the people has been blunted.
If millions are no longer willing to be bullied and bludgeoned
into confusion by the cry of “red” raised against Browder,
then the honeymoon days of Martin Dies’ wooing of Adolf
Hitler are numbered! Hitler and his ﬁfth column who divided

_and_conquered Europe with the propaganda of anti-Commu-
nism won't be able to divide and ‘conquer America with the
same trick.’

Of course, it would be a strange situation if the Commu-A
nists weren't among the most active in working for Earl
’Browder’s release—a topsy-turvy world indeed!

We are not ashamed to shout the fact from the housetops
that we declare the release of Earl Browder to be an objective

inseparable from the object of winning the war for which we ‘

are ready to give every ounce of our energy and every drop
of our blood. And we say to every American that a successful
campaign to free Earl Browder will help to end the day when
patriotic trade union leaders, liberals, progressives, youth

 leaders like Joseph Lash, are expected to cringe before the

\.

\

ﬁfth-column cry of “red.” That title of “red” that the Hitler
agents wish to use as a brand of shame against whomever
they fear can become a badge of honor to single out devoted
and loyal defenders of America! It is for this reason that every
honest anti-fascist must defend the right of everyone irre-
spective of their political opinions, including the Communists,
‘to contribute their share to the national unity for thedefeat
of the Axis powers. This is no selﬁsh concern of Communists.

America Needs Browder

Here is a cause that will appeal to the best that is in the
youth of America, their deep sense of justice, loyalty and fair‘

play. It is the ﬁght to free a man who can justly be called 

the friend and champion of youth. Among political ﬁgures
in American life there are many who lay claim to this title,
but none with so clear a claim as Earl Browder. Ours is a
generation that admires ﬁghting champions built in the mold
of Joe Louis. We need champions who can step in and deliver ,
hand, fast blows against the biggest opponent we've ever been f\
up against, the fascist axis! This ﬁght is for keeps, and the

stake is our lives, our happiness, our future, everything that I
we are and ever hope to be! We need this man, Earl Brow- y

der, on our side!

Many young people and youth organizations have already
raised their voices for the freedom of Earl Browder. But they
are all too few compared to the millions who are springing
to arms at their nation's call, who are manning the tanks,
guns, planes, production lines and civilian defense tasks. If
they are not greater in number it can only be because the
millions have not yet learned to appreciate that this too is a

task of winning the war! Once that realization dawns upon ./9*“!

them, they will as loyally rise to the defense of Browder as”
they do to smash the enemy attacks in the far-off hills of the
Philippines!

The sage advice, patient understanding and outstanding
example of Earl Browder have given America many outstand-
ing heroes of the battle for freedom. There is Dave Doran,
seaman, young Communist, who gave his young life on the
ﬁelds of Spain so that we might have more time to gird ,our- y
selves to take up the same battle. Dave Doran lived, fought»'/
and died a true American hero. Others went to‘ Spain, tr"/

1 3 /‘J.

young men who learned from Earl Browder how to value
human freedom sufficiently to risk their lives gladly that it
might live. There were Lieutenant-Colonel John Gates
and Captain Bob Thompson of the Spanish Republican Army
who today proudly serve the Stars and Stripes as privates in the
U. S. Army. A host of others, taught in the spirit of Earl
Browder by the Young Communist League, already serve
their country and their ﬂag wherever duty calls, and others
but wait the call to duty!

~ -’f 7'l-—_,, The youth of this country have a proud tradition to uphold

in the ﬁght for justice. One case stands out above others. A
few years ago the name of a young Negro Communist was a
by-word among the youth of the nation, and in their organi-
zations. The youth movement played no small part in snatch-
ing him from the jaws of death on a Georgia chain-gang by a
great protest movement. The frame-up of Angelo Herndon
was no less unjust, no less an attack upon the American peo-
ple than the imprisonment of Earl Browder. The name of
Earl Browder too should become a by-word among the youth,
synonymous with the ﬁght for democracy and liberty.

Enlist for Campaign

This campaign for the freedom of Earl Browder is con-
ducted in the spirit of Jefferson and the tradition of the
Angelo Herndon case. The decision of such an eminent citi-
zen as Wendell Willkie to act as defense attorney in the case
of William Schneiderman, well-known Communist whose citi-
zenship the prosecution wishes to revoke on that ground, re-
ﬂects the growing appreciation of the need to recognize Com-

* ‘munists as art of the national unit . Here too are uarantees
. P Y 8

’9 success for the effort to free Browder if it is conducted ag-
-ively and vigorously.
'ment for the campaign is open for the duration—until

Browder walks out of prison into the sunlight to join his
people again! ‘

Duty consists of adding your voice and the voice of your
friends, shopmates, school chums, of your organization, union, ‘
club, church to the growing roll of Americans ‘who believe /
that everything, everything including Earl Browder must be
given to the defense of our nation! i

The task is to send telegrams, letters, resolutions to Presi-
dent Roosevelt urging that he grant an order of Executive
clemency freeing Earl Browder. Let America ring out with the _,
words Free Earl Browder, especially on those days dedicated
to the cause of human freedom on which we commemorate

the birthdays of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and
Frederick Douglass.

Let Freedom Ring for Earl Browder

By CARL ROSS

A GREAT American warned his people a few years ago

that “a continuation of isolationist policies by the United
States will surely convince the arrogant militarists of Tokyo
that now is the. time for them to take over the Philippines,
Hawaii, Guam and Alaska.”

Bursting bombs upon Pearl Harbor nearly four years later
drove home that bitter truth to America more keenly than
could any words.

But what a heavy price we had to pay for the isolationist
illusions that numbed the senses of so many to the grave peril.

How much easier and less costly it would have been to heed g

the advice of this American who saw further and more clearly
than his countrymen. Had the United States taken that warn-
ing to heart there would have been no "Pearl Harbor" on that
infamous December momingl ~ A

A month later this same American visited Republican
Spain, to meet that band of gallant American boys in the

‘Abraham Lincoln Battalion who were ﬁghting with the Span-

ish people against“ Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. Again in

/



ringing‘ words that should have burned deep into our cop]/”

science he told us: /

,4

\

.>\

“When I arrived in Barcelona last week, I visited many

of the thirty-five apartment houses blown to bits by high- A"

power bombs from Italian planes, dropped the day before, a
sunny Sunday morning. I saw dismembered and mutilated
babies and mothers being removed from the wreckage. In my
mind rose the question, how long will it be before similar
bombs drop on New York, Chicago, San Francisco, with similar
results "at home’ to our women and chi1dren—perhaps to my
own family too? . . . .

“What reason have we to assume that America is immune to
this madness that is sweeping the world?"

In those days when Spain was ﬁghting for its life against
tremendous odds, the average American was not yet convinced
that the bombs falling on Madrid and Barcelona were also
aimed at us. But how prophetic this warning has proved to
be that Spain was a stepping stone for the Axis bandits on
their way toward world conquest! If they had not defeated
the Spanish people they would not today be able to send their
submarines to lurk off the U. S. coast to sink our ships. They
would not threaten our very existence as a free nation.

The man who spoke these warnings in the days before Cham-
berlain ﬂew to Hitler's hideout in Berchtesgaden to sell out
our peace proposed, even then, that America join with Great
Britain, the Soviet Union, China and all other freedom-loving

-~ nations in a “united nations" agreement to.save peace by
’ smashing fascism. Then it would have been relatively easy_

to crush the Axis merely by effective aid to the people of
Spain and China. Now to do the job will take millions of
men and tens of thousands of tanks, planes and guns, and the
American people are thankful that they have staunch allies
in the other “United Nations." '

Surely America should now seek out the man who showed
such wisdom and foresight, and recognize the greatness of his
service. Usually signal honors are showered upon those who

4

A serve our country so well. Only a few weeks  the memory -

of a man named Billy Mitchell, who prophesied, in the face
of ridicule, that America would need a great air ﬂeet in its g
defense, was rescued from obscurity and disgrace and, even if
after his death, a Distinguished Service Medal was bestowed
upon him. Is this other great American less deserving of
praise and honor?

That pungent warning to beware of Pearl Harbor was ut- l
tered not once, but a hundred times. It was spoken through- V
out the length and breadth of the land by a man who for 1
nearly a year has been locked behind the grim, gray walls 
of Atlanta penitentiary! His name is Earl Browder. He is an
American of proven loyalty, anxious to serve his country in 
this hour of crisis. Our country needs such men of vision 
and courage today. Can we afford to do without his talent
and ability? Isn't it necessary that he be free to help win the
war against the fascist barbarians?

The patriotic youth of America can have only one answer
to the question of whether Browder should be free. That
answer is: “If it will help America——le't it be done!”

Facts of the Case

Maybe there is a -good reason for keeping him locked up?
Let us brieﬂy examine the facts of the case. Earl Browder,
leader of the Communist Party, and twice the candidate of
his party for the Presidency of the United States, was sen-
tenced to prison for a term of four years and to pay a ﬁne of
$2,000 for a minor technical passport violation. The usual
sentence in such case is more nearly thirty days or a suspended
sentence. Is he an alien not entitled to use an American
passport? Of course not; he is a native-born son of the state of
Kansas. Did he use a passport improperly or in a man

G

harmful to his fellow citizens? No. Not even the prosecuting 

attorney charged that any criminal intent was involved. Actu-
ally Earl Browder was convicted for a technical error in ﬁlling
out an application blank for a passport which he then re-
ceived with the full knowledge of the proper oflicials, in his
own name, under no false pretences, and used in a perfectly
legal manner to travel abroad on such missions as his visit
to Spain! " -

Actually, even if he had been guilty, Earl Browder would
already have served an unnecessarily long and harsh sentence.
The spirit of justice and fair play alone, if not the ﬁrm belief
that Browder is indispensable to our" nation in these war
times, would call for his freedom. Only one individual, Presi-
dent Roosevelt, can now free Earl Browder. But it is within
the power of the millions of American citizens to persuade
the President that this must be done! Over 2,000,000 people
have already urged the President to do so, but a few indi-
viduals, Representative Martin Dies among them, are most
violently opposed. In fact, he boasts no little of having had
a major part in instigating the conviction and jailing of Earl
Browder. Most Americans have learned to view with suspicion
anything that the notorious poll-tax Congressman favors. In
the Browder case such suspicion is justified, for by now it is
commonly accepted that Browder has been jailed because of
his political views and not because of any “crime."

A Democratic Position

There is nothing alien or un-American in the effort to see
that justice is done to individuals persecuted for their polit-
ical opinions The effort to free Browder is based upon a

'_ tradition as old as these United States and is written into the
"~asic law of the land in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution! .

6

"‘2..--,5_ . s ._

Thomas jelferson could rightfully lay claim to being the
founder of this tradition and to the title of being the ﬁrst.
defender of political prisoners in this nation. We can learn. 
something of why and how to free Earl Browder from the-

case of Matthew Lyon, a political prisoner of _]efferson’s day-

Lyon, a member of Congress from Vermont during the Adams /
Administration, was considered a rabid Jeffersonian "Demo-»
crat," which, in the eyes of Mr. Dies’ political forebears, was.
synonymous with the present day term “Communist."

The policies of the Adams Administration, manipulated l
by the arch-reactionary Alexander Hamilton, were bitterly Lit ‘
opposed by Jefferson and his followers, who were rousing the ‘V \ V
nation to continue the ﬁght for democracy and independence.
Foreign policy became a central issue then as now. Jefferson,
who saw the continued menace to American freedom from
British tyranny, favored a firm policy of friendship and collab~
oration with the young French Republic in the interests of
their mutual security. Consequently, from one end of the-
country to the other the Jeffersonians were denounced as "for-
eign agents” or Jacobins, and a reign of terror was let loose
against them by the enactment of the notorious Alien and
Sedition Acts.

Matthew Lyon established his-own newspaper to support ,4
Jefferson, and thus became a logical choice to be singled out " '5
as the first victim under the new “sedition" act. Finding a
charge upon which to convict him was by no means easy. But
a ﬂimsy technical pretext was discovered. Lyon had published
articles criticising the Adams Administration before the "Sedi-
tion Act" had even been passed by Congressl On this “charge"
of violating the Act he was, however, arrested and sentenced
to four months in prison and to pay a ﬁne of $1,000 in a trial
described as a “farce"l

The citizens of Vermont, and the Green Mountain B

who had fought with Lyon in the Revolution of ’76, protested  ‘

and thousands signed petitions to President Adams. The
people nominated this “convict" for Congress and re-elected
him with twice as many votes as his nearest opponent!

When his term of imprisonment was about to expire, the
{me of $i,ooo (an enormous sum those days) had not been
raised by the poor Vermont farmers. The Adams Adminis-
tration threatened to keep him in prison, but the eyes of the
entire.nation were now focused upon the case of the "man in
that little prisoncell. Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and
their friends raised and paid the necessary money to free
Lyon.

Lyon was freed by the personal intervention of Jefferson,
who utilized the persecution of Lyon and others under the
Sedition Act to rally the people in the fight for democracy.
The freeing of Matthew Lyon was a great event whose reper-
cussions were felt far beyond Vermont, even as the freeing of
Browder today would help arouse the whole nation.

Browder’s Policy Vindicated

The ‘case of Earl Browder is no less a political matter than

_ the case of Matthew Lyon. Nor is the pretext upon‘ which
i‘ he was sentenced to prison any less ﬂimsy. In the eyes of the

appeasers, and the infamous Dies Committee, Earl Browder

curity. '
