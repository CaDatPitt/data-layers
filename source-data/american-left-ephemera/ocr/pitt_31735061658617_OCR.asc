because of the growth in production. A number of capitalist
countries were even forcedto take on foreign labour in order
to meet the demand for labour power (Germany, England,
U.S.A.).

After the war the position was wholly different. It was
only in 1928 that world foreign trade again reached the level
of 1913. Little change was made during 1929. If statistics
sometimes show a greater extent of world trade, the increase
is deceptive for, with the creation of several new states, boun-
daries have arisen at which trade is registered, although it
has not increased over the territory concerned. But a con-
siderable change in forces has developed in regard to world
trade and world production, which makes the situation very
difﬁcult for a number of states and aggravates all the prob-
lems of their respective crises. (England and Germany are
now suffering from permanent mass unemployment because
of this change.) America’s share of world trade has increased
tremendously. to the disadvantage of European countries,
and in some other countries the machinery of production has
been extended to a degree which makes them more independ-
ent of products on the world market.

Now that the Soviet Union is excluded from the sphere
of capitalism and countries like China and India have of late
become rapidly impoverished, world trade is being subjected
to further upheavals, What, in such circumstances, is the
result of further capitalist rationalisation? Can it increase
world trade ? Can it decrease the unemployment ﬁgure ? Of’

course it is possible that one or another state, because of par-

ticularly favourable circumstances, will succeed in temporarily
mitigating the present crisis, but this can be done only at the
expense of its neighbours, whose position will consequently
become worse.

The German Example.

Let us consider rationalisation in the period 1925-1929, up
to the present crisis. taking Germany as an example.
Germany's defeat in the war was followed by a serious crisis;
the Versailles Treaty deprived German capitalists of the free-
-dom of movement. In 1923 they tried to break their fetters.
by inﬂation ; this attempt ended in complete bankruptcy, from
which the German bourgeoisie saved itself by the acceptance-

of the Dawes Plan, which placed Germany under the control

of its former enemies. With their help German economy was
again set going. Germany borrowed 17 milliard gold marks.

‘~§

 

 

from abroad. With this sum and with a milliard proﬁts
which the German industrialists made in 1926 because of the
English mining dispute, it was possible to build up a
thoroughly rationalised production apparatus which put Ger-
man industry in the ﬁrst place after the United States.

From the autumn of 1926 German industry experienced a
great boom, which induced German capitalists to regard it as
“the forecast of the future.” The new German im-
perialism celebrated its birthday, and the trade union leaders
joined in the song of triumph. They said that their prophecy :
“rationalisation will bring a b-oom and prosperity,” had come
true. The number of unemployed sank from two and a half
million at the beginning of 1926 to h.alf a million in July,
1927. The wages of workers rose. Only one thing did not
happen, which was usually a sign of improvement in an
industry attacked by crisis—a fall in prices. Monopolies,
trusts and banks and the economic policy of the state kept
prices high.

The Growing Intensity of Labour.

The most important result of rationalisation from 1926-
1927 was the increase in the intensity of labour, which con-
tinued through the years I928 and 1929. The capitalists
themselves estimated that the increase in output as compared
with the pre-war period, per head and per shift, amounted to
30 and 35 per cent. A few ﬁgures to illustrate this process.

The labour output per head and per shift increased in
Germany to the following extent :+—-

Industry. ' Output.

— I913. I928.
Ruhr mining    1oo 126.3
Brown coal    100 154.1
Potassium    100 167.6 .
Cement    100 174.4
Transport engineering  100 503.0
Iron ore    100 129.1
Arsenic and copper ores  4 I00 145.6
Lead, silver and zinc production 100 137.3

In 1929 labour output increased still more; in Ruhr mining
to’I34.5 by September, 1929; machine construction, 133 in
1928 and I42 in 1929 as compared with 100 in 1925. On the
Reich railways, it rose to 128 in 1928, the labour output in
1925 being taken as 100. v 1 «

 

  
     

   

 

These ﬁgures cannot be understood in their full signiﬁ-,
cance unless we consider that in 1924 the output per worker
in the, various industries was estimated at about 85-90 per
cent. of the pre-war ﬁgure. Wages remained practically un-

changed by this increased output. It is true that the wages-‘

curve shows a rapid rise in wages between 1924 and 1927, but
the 1924 wages cannot be taken as a basis of comparison,
because the inﬂation in 1923 had reduced wages to a fraction
of the pre-war rates. The real purchasing power of average
German wages is not greater than before the war; if anything,
it is slightly less, so that the whole increase in output has
gone into the pockets of the capitalists. In other words,
rationalisation was paid for with the pennies and farthings of
the German workers. - -

Where Are the Proﬁts ? A

In ‘spite of this, the German capitalists are howling that
they are unable to compete and that therefore wages must
come down and output must go up. Nothing can be done
without further rationalisation. The workers must take as
their motto : Work more and eat less. How can we explain
the outcry of the German capitalists, and their declaration
that they have made nothing out of rationalisation ? (The
captains of ﬁnance and industry have made great proﬁt in
spite of everything.) Is their shouting just demagogy?
Then why the 13,500 bankruptcies in 1929 and the 3,500,000
unemployed who at present inhabit the streets, and whence
the great deﬁcit in the national treasury ? Have prices fallen
so much that production has become unproﬁtable ? VVe have
already stated that this is not the case. It was only in 1929
that wholesale prices fell slightly; this, however, will now
be made up for by new tariffs. Nor has the money streamed
into the pockets of the workers; and it must be somewhere.
How does it happen that German capital’s ability to compete

«cannot be maintained? -Perhaps the cause is the reparation ’

payments which Germany has to make ? But up to the present
reparations have.been paid almost entirely with the money
borrowed from abroad (9 milliard reparation payments, and
foreign loans amounting to 17 milliard). The complications
of reparation payments under the Young Plan will only ap-
pear later and will have fatal results for German capitalist‘
economy. The’ causes of German capitalism’s difﬁcult posi-
tion are two; and they are present in other capitalist countries.
It is therefore of the greatest importance to make them clear.

capitalist methods of ﬁghting againstthemtcan give no posi-_‘

tive results. -

Everything Rationalised.

When capitalist Germany, at the end of 1927, had carried

out the rationalisation of its production in all essentials, and
had experienced a certain industrial boom, most people were
blind to the consequences which must follow from rationalisa-

tion. The capitalists and the social fascists rejoiced over.

“the miracle.” “Germany’s national economy is on the road
to becoming the ﬁrst national economy of the World.” But
the advance gained by the German capitalists’ rationalisation
of industry could not endure for long. The other countries
also began to rationalise at full speed. France, Poland,
England, Czecho-Slovakia and other countries made the
greatest efforts to catch up to and surpass Germany. New

works sprang up like mushrooms. Rationalisation was also.

accompanied by the closing down of many factories and the
dismissal of large numbers of workers. This fact was ex-
ploited by the capitalists to lower wages and to increase the
output of their workers. The lead of the German capitalists
was caught up with. By numbers of lock-outs, threats and

other measures the capitalists of France, England, Poland,

Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, the Balkans, Italy, etc., succeeded
in considerably reducing the wages of the workers in their
respective countries. The French industrialist Bailly declared

at the end of 1929 that France’s prosperity rested upon the

low wages of the French workers, which made it possible
to produce a ton of steel in France 179 francs cheaper than
in any other country of the world.

VVith the reduction in wages and the increase in unemploy-
ment the purchasing power of the masses on the home market
was cut down, while at the same time the competitive struggle
on the world market grew much more intense. Germany has
for some years past sold considerable portions of its exports
(steel, iron, sugar, potassium) on the world market at much
lower prices than they are sold at home.

The narrower the home market grows, the greater becomes

the necessity to export, even if the exports have to be sub-.

sidised. In such circumstances a new crisis was bound to
mature, which would come to a head and break out at the
moment that new’ difficulties arose on the home marketyor
foreign credits_were restricted. This is happening now when,

I11

  

 

 

 

with the appearance of a new agricultural crisis in several
countries, the purchasing power of agriculture is rapidly
declining, for the peasants and farmers cannot sell their corn,
coilee or cotton unless at a loss.* This agricultural crisis
greatly diminishes the home market and chieﬂy affects the
industries producing consumable goods.

Doubt in the Rationalisation» Miracle.

As early as the end of 1927 a German capitalist of the name
of Linguer, director of a chemical concern, questioned
whether rationalisation, by creating new productive concerns
and more expensive, technically improved means of produc-
tion without any prospects of certain markets, was a reason-
able course to pursue". Linguer denied this even while the over-
whelming majority of capitalists and all the reformist trade
union bureaucrats believed in the miracle of rationalisation.
Lately Linguer has acquired many colleagues who are of the
same mind. An anxious capitalist soul writes in the Berg-
werkzeitung: “ . . . Surely there must be something higher
than continually improving technique; a rate of work which
is continually increasing cannot, after all, be the way out.”

Here is the good old German mystic risen from the
reliquary. But how can that help, when all the world is
crying: “Accumulation, accumulation ! This is our Moses
and the prophets!”

Even the Berliner Tageblatt is nervous. On the 25th
January, 1930, a certain Dr. Georg Schroter discussed in its
columns who was responsible for the crisis and for world
unemployment, who is to blame for the declining markets:

“What then is the decisive factor in this phenomenon
(great unemployment) if it does not arise from the special
economic situation of a particular country? It can only be
rationalisation, or rather its extremely rapid rate since the
war, to be sure in conjunction with several other factors . . .
So long as this extremely great rate of rationalisation endures,
so long will we be unable to look forward to any appreciable
decrease in unemployment. It is worthy of note that the

British Labour government, whose main plank in the election’

campaign was the reduction of unemployment, has so~far’not
the slightest success to show in precisely this sphere.”

’ And in the Bergwerkzeitrmg of 24th December, 1929,
appeared the following paragraph, which has already been
so ‘often quoted:

* The world price of sugar is considerably below the cost of production.

I2

 

 

 

“In such a state of affairs Germany is inevitably approach-
ing a crisis which in many respects recalls that of the year
I923: but the effects to-day will be much more grave, for at
that time there was still some hope in the future. Now, how-
ever, hope is practically non-existent, for the work of political
and economic reconstruction in the last ﬁve or six years has
proved fruitless and unsuccessful in precisely the most im-
portant points.”

Vorwaerts, too, utters a pious exclamation:

“So far rationalisation has brought the workers nothing
but misery.”

We could add to this chorus by quotations from many
countries, but those already given are enough. Capitalists in
particular cannot proceed from the standpoint of a dim in-
sight to the solution of the problem. The internal mechanism
of the system allows of no return. Who-ever does not take
part in the madness of capitalist rationalisation is sure to be
swallowed by his competitors.

Now that the colonial markets (China, India) and the semi-
colonial markets (South America, etc.), are rapidly diminish-
ing, the ﬁght for world markets will really ﬂare up. When
the “land of eternal prosperity” suﬁered a serious blow be-
cause of the American stock exchange crash in November last,
President Hoover called ‘a meeting of the ﬁnancial and indus-
trial powers in order to discuss with them a way out of the
situation. “You may rest assured,” he cried to the inhabi-
tants of the American heaven, “that we shall retain our pros-
perity. There should be no uneasiness. If the American
capitalists have not enough orders for the time being, the
state and the municipalities will ﬁnd money and orders.” A
few’ days later the Chicago authorities announced that they
were unable to pay their debts, which amounted to
I,5oo,ooo,ooo dollars, and nobody would lend them money
any longer. Ten thousand workers and employees were dis--
missed. Snow and mud is littering the streets of the metro-
polis of the Central States of the U.S.A. But nobody can be
paid to remove the snow and the mud. This contingency was
not included in Hoover’s plans. 4 ’

The Prescriptions of the Prophets.

So that nobody in Europe should issue the prescription
for restoring prosperity put forward by the genius of Mr.
Hoover, Pierpont Morgan, for example, through hisagent in
Germany, Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, has re-

stricted the credits given to the municipalities and the German
states. This increased the ﬁgure of unemployment by half
a million in one blow. The Swedish economist, Professor
Gustav Cassel, thereupon took up-the ﬁght, and issued a

grave warning against any imitation of Hoover’s action. He _

said:

“It is not a superabundance of capital which characterises
the situation, as many seem inclined to believe, but a shortage
of capital which forms the kernel of the entire present situa-
tion. This is also due to the fact that American capital ex-
port has decreased greatly . . . As conditions are in the world
at present, large exports of American capital are indispens-
able if world economy is to ﬂourish. It is therefore necessary
to watch carefully any state action which will actually result
in making the accumulation of American savings impossible
even in America itself, because of uneconomic investments. . .
A continuous fall in prices will certainly prevent American
economic life from continuing its previous magniﬁcent de-
velopment. The fall in prices must affect the rest of the
world and land other countries in an economic depression
which will, of course, in its turn react upon the United
States . . . The whole affair (Hoover’s interference) is an
awful example of the results of giving way to the modern ten-
dency of unnecessarily allowing the state power to interfere
in the economic sphere.”

Cassel was trying to annihilate Hoover’s plan theoretic-
ally_ in Europe and to dispose of it as stupidity. Let us wait I
Even stupidites are often committed although they have been
recognised as such. That depends on whether any other
way is left open for American capitalists. Wilhelm 11., after
the ‘battle o-f the Marne, carried on a lost warfor four years,
right up to its complete collapse.

Besides Mr. Hoover, America has another “genius who is
admired everywhere”-—Mr. Henry Ford. This man, accord-
ing to the considered opinion of German social-democratic
science, ci la Sinsheimer, Norpel and Tarnov, has developed
Karl Marx further and founded practical Marxism. Henry
Ford has discovered “the consuming power of labour,” by
which the world canbe healed of all its capitalist sicknesses.
while capitalism itself receives no injury. The Nieuwe
Rotterdamsche Comant, organ of the Dutch grocers ‘(men
with good heads on their shoulders) wrote as follows on this
discovery: _ «l T

I4

 

 

 

“The American economic theory of the consuming power
of labour, inaugurated by Ford and to a large extent realised,
is summed up in the phrase : ‘The shortest possible hours of
labour and the highest possible wages.’ Ford argues : if the
worker works too long, he has no opportunity to spend his
money among people, and if he earns too little, the purchas-
ing power of the workers suffers. Therefore—good wages
and a lot of free time. In somewhat more cautious language

A than Ford, Charles Schwab, of the Bethlehem Steel Corpora-

tion, has dealt with the consuming power of labour. His
theory runs : Pay the highest possible wages, for the welfare
of the country is bound up with a high wage standard. The
incorrectness of the theory of the consuming power of labour
is obvious. The industrial welfare of the United States is
not the result of high wages. American industry has lived
through a number of years of unprecedented prosperity and
is therefore in a position to pay high wages. The process of
rationalisation in American industry, particularly in auto-
mobile and steel production, has advanced very far. In no
other country of the world are the processes of production
more highly mechanised than in the United States. Wages.
in consequence, do not play a very large part in production.
As for the rest, it is too often overlooked, that only a rela-
tively small number of workers in the United States have a
high income. Agricultural workers in the west of America
have a very bad time. It is true to say that of the 40 million
workers in America, only 4 million earn high wages. These
4 million cannot, it is clear, consume the products of the
labour of the other 36 million while, on the other hand, the
4 million skilled industrial workers compel the rest of the
working class to pay high prices for the products of their
labour. This is the only way by which their high wage level
can be maintained. The idea, therefore, that the artiﬁcially
-raised purchasing power of a small part of the population has
resulted in a general rise of prices is wholly incorrect. The
distress of American agriculture offers proof to the contrary.
The theory of the consuming power of labour is nothing more
than a phrase.

If Mr. Hoover is proved to be a false prophet, then he
may make matters still worse than they would have been if
they had been left quite alone.” ‘ .

There is no doubt that matters will get much worse. But
ﬁrst of all the capitalists of the U.S.A. will try to alter the
world situation in their own favour by making an attack with

is

 

 

 

commodities on the largest possible scale. This experiment
will cost further millions of workers their jobs and many
capitalists will go bankrupt.

What Is Wrong In the Difterent countries?
' U-S-A.

Despite the great prosperity of the U.S.A. since 1921, the
number of workers employed there has not increased. In
order to prevent the labour market from being ﬂooded by
foreign unemployed workers, immigration into the U.S.A..
was made more difﬁcult. These measures, however, could
not prevent a slow growth in unemployment, although in
recent years a new great industry has developed in the
southern states of the U.S.A. The reserve army of industry
in 1927 and 1928 was estimated at between two and three-
million. Even before the stock exchange crash in November
there was a considerable increase in the number of unem-

ployed. The number of miners employed fell from 6oo,ooo~

to 350,000. A sharp fall was also apparent in the number of
workers engaged in the clothing and textile industries. In
the steel industry, and particularly in automobile production,

the number of workers employed also decreased rapidly. After‘

the stock exchange crash the situation became visibly worse.

At the foundation conference of the Reparations Bank in
Baden-Baden, the American experts expressed the opinion

that “the American Stock Exchange crash would give rise to

a great world economic crisis. America lost 60 milliard
dollars during the black days on the Exchange. It was a

setback to the year 1897.” These remarks may be exagger-

ated, but it is true that American economy has not ever before

suffered such a blow. The automobile industry, despite

Henry Ford's consuming power of labour, is only working
at 35 per cent. of its capacity; mining is almost at a standstill,

and the crisis is becoming more acute. Short time is being‘
operated to an increasing extent in the textile industry. The

number of bankruptcies is growing.

Now Charles Schwab has revised his welfare theory, for‘

the working week in the Bethlehem Steel Corporation has

been shortened, while the wages of the steel workers have

gone down 20 per cent. As" head of America’s key industry,

he gave the signal for a general reduction in wages. In spite-

of the famous policy of “not working for warehouses,” in
order to prevent an accumulation of commodities and a fall

:5

 

in prices, unsold stocks of goods are now very large, particu-
larly of cotton products. In addition there is a decrease in
the export of raw materials, such as cotton, sugar, coal, oil.
Imports and exports are declining rapidly, as the following
table shows :—

Imports. Exports.
(In million dollars).
1928 ' 1929 1928 1929
October  355 391 55o 529
November  327 339 545 448
December  339 311 476 434

Apart from the decline in exports, we can take the export
of gold as a sign of the decrease in the purchasing power of
the dollar. Railway receipts have fallen considerably in com-
parison with the previous year. American ﬁnance capital is
preparing for a great “commodity offensive” on the world
market, which arouses the fear of industrialists and merchants
in other capitalist countries. But no plot or plan can keep
the Americans from taking this road, not even the b1andish-
ments of Professor Cassel. The growing crisis in agricul-
ture is connected with the worsening of the economic position
of industry; many farmers are giving up their land and
migrating into the towns. The American capitalist will also
make a cruel attack on his workers, to reduce their standard

of life. Since the purchasing power of the American workers’

is to a co-nsiderable extent mortgaged for some time ahead to
the deferred payment concerns (the American worker buys a
great deal on credit), his situation, with unemployment, short
time and wage reduction, is quite wretched,‘ and the American

home market will in consequence suffer still more.

England.

- When the Labour government entered into ofﬁce in june,
1929, it promised to solve the unemployment problem. This
promise has not been kept. The official unemployment ﬁgure
for 31.12.1928 was 1,520,730; for 31.12.1929 it was 1,510,200.
That was a decrease of 10,000, a ridiculously small ﬁgure.
But the government statistics in no way measure the real
extent of unemployment. There are no unemployment
statistics wholly free from objection; the English government

is able to exclude large sections of the unemployed from ‘

receipt of unemployment beneﬁt.

I7

 

“In the year ending 29th May, 1929, 285,865 persons lost

the right to unemployment beneﬁt for contravening Statute
(Journal of German T.U. Federation, 1930, p. 24.)

In 1929 the Labour Party accepted the so-called Hayday
formula, which declares that if any ofﬁcial of the Ministry
of Labour or of the Labour Exchange can prove that anybody
in receipt of, or seeking, unemployment beneﬁt, has refused
a suitable job offered by the Exchange or by an employer,
that person shall lose the right to unemployment beneﬁt for
six weeks, or for a shorter period if the Courts or Umpire so
decide.

By this formula, the way is opened for the arbitrary ex-
clusion, by the Labour Exchange authorities, of the unem-
ployed from receiving beneﬁt. Miss Bondﬁeld, that worthy
member of the British Labour Party, can congratulate herself
on having carried out an even more reactionary reform than
her colleague in Germany, the social fascist minister of labour,
Wissell, who made the conditions of unemployment beneﬁt
much forse for the German workers in October, 1929. Dis-
content with MacDonald's unemployment policy is so great
that the old liberal fox, Lloyd George, is again brandishing
the claim that he can give the unemployed bread and work.
On 22nd December, Thomas, a former president of the
Amsterdam Trade Union International, spoke on unemploy-

' ment. The Times reported on the following day that Mr.

James Maxton, M.P., stated that he listened to Mr. Thomas
with the greatest anxiety. He did not believe that there was
a more unfortunate person in Parliament than himself; after
he had heard Thomas’s speech, he came to the conclusion that
Thomas, instead of following his own sound working class
judgment had allowed his speech to be prepared by the same
civil servant who had done similar work for his conservative
predecessor in ofﬁce, Steel Maitland . . . Thomas was giv-
ing the capitalists, the railway directors and mine-owners
forty million pounds sterling. He believed that the same
amount of money would not be too much if it went directly
into the pockets of the unemployed.

Unemployment in England is therefore not measured
correctly by the ofﬁcial ﬁgures published by the government.
It is ‘much higher. In addition there is a very great deal of
short time. About one-quarter of the working week of those

' employed in industry is given as a compulsory holiday.

 

About 50 per cent. of the workers are affected by short time.

18

 

 

.’ :5

The English capitalists, ably supported by the social fascists,
are trying to get over their difﬁculties by raising tariffs and
throttling colonial industry, particularly in India. This
means that if fewer workers are to be unemployed or on short
time in England, more Indian workers have got to be thrown
on to the streets.‘

Italy.

The fascist newspapers of Italy announce that there are
420,000 unemployed in that country. No ﬁgures are given
of the number on short time. The official number given of
the unemployed in pure imagination, for there are at least
800,000 without work in the fascist paradise. The discontent
of the masses impoverished by short time and unemployment
is expressed in great demonstrations and strike action. The
well constructed system of suppression and the fascist trade
unions were unable to prevent the outbreak of this mass move-
ment. In 1929 there were more bills of exchange protested
in Italy than in any othervcountry of the world (more than
2,000 daily) and Mussolini was compelled to introduce
measures in order to alleviate the economic situation. The-
large factories were ordered, despite the continuous limitation

"of production, not to dismiss any more workers. The only

consolation that Mussolini has to offer is that: “national
economy under the fascist system is no worse off than in any
other country.” Even the German Bergwerkszeitung could
not refrain from a derisive comment on the grand Duce’s
dilletante economics, and on the feeble consolation which ex-
presses his contentment with the fact that “Italy is no worse
off than other countries.”

Since Italian industry is very largely inﬂuenced by
American economy,‘ the growing American crisis will

' seriously affect Italy. An upheaval in the fascist’ state is

therefore not so very far off. Mussolini has had a bright idea
for ﬁghting against unemployment, short time and poverty.
He issued the following order :—

“The factory guarantees to every worker an advance
amounting to ﬁve days’ wages per week. even if he cannot
be employed for that length of time. This sum is considered
sufﬁcient to satisfy the morst urgent needs of the worker.
Those workers who cannot be fully employed must work off
the advance received as soon as they again get full,time
employment. In this way repayment willbe ‘extended over

19

a considerable period of time and the workers will therefore
be able to get through the winter.”

This means the re-introduction of debt slavery for the
workers. They become, so to speak, the serfs of the factory
owners. It is quite clear that this new welfare institution will
not be received as such by the Italian workers, but as a cursed
plague, and it will help to revolutionise the Italian masses.

czecho-Slovakia.

Up to last November, the employers of Czecho-Slovakia
believed that the economic depression would be avoided in
their country. By the end of November there were already
220,000 unemployed, which has since gone up to 400,000.
The workers’ position is rapidly growing worse. Since, in
Czecho-Slovakia, the so—called Genter system prevails (only
those who belong to an organisation receive unemployment
beneﬁt, the state paying a contribution towards trade union
unemployment funds) there are thousands of workers in that
country who are entirely without means of subsistence.

Apart from the textile and sugar industries, which have
been affected for a longer time, the crisis has recently become
particularly acute in the metal industry. In the largest metal
works (Mannesmann, Poldihiitte, Nesselsdorf) masses of
workers have been dismissed. Some works have closed down
entirely. The resistance of the working class is expressed in
no uncertain manner; while the unemployed organise hunger
demonstrations, often leading to collisions with the armed
forces of the state, struggles are continually breaking out in
the factories, which work along the same line as those of the
unemployed; the origin of these struggles is resistance to dis-
missal or to the introduction of rationalisation measures which
would result in dismissals. Recently there have been such

 

strikes in the glass, artiﬁcial silk, machine, metal and mining

industries.

Poland.

Of all European countries, Poland is most deeply affected
by the crisis. Half of its industry is at a standstill. In
addition there is a tremendous agrarian crisis, which is shak-
ing the whole ﬁnancial system of the country; nor is there
any prospect of improvement. The workers receive no unem-

ployment beneﬁt, or only a few coppers from public organ- ’

iS<'1tiOn5- In January, 1930, the registered number of fully
unemployed was 206,000, of workers on short time 100,000.

20

 

 

Hundreds of thousands are unemployed in Lodz and Warsaw.
400,000 workers are doomed to starvation. In spite of this
catastrophic situation the Pilsudski band. in order to maintain
themselves in power, are spending all the state income, and
all the sums which can be borrowed from abroad, on police
and military equipment. One unemployed demonstration
follows another; bloody collisions are a daily occurrence. The
police and the judiciary are kept very busy. By rationalisa-
tion, longer working hours and wage reductions, the Polish
régime is trying to maintain its existence. The bourgeoisie
is making every effort to bring about a new war against the
Soviet Union, by which it hopes to get out of the present
terrible position.

Matters in Rumania are very similar to those in Poland.
The great economic crisis has seized upon the weak industry
of the country, affecting every branch of it. The rebellious
workers fearlessly encounter the police and the military. The
government and its servants can no longer stop the mass
demonstrations which are taking place in all the most import-
ant towns of Rumania, Bukarest, Klausenburg, Temesvar,
etc.

In Hungary with its 2oo,ooo unemployed, in Yugo-Slavia
with another 2oo,ooo unemployed, in Bulgaria with its
180,000 unemployed, the situation is growing more acute from
week to week. The governments of these countries have no
means of getting their industries going again. Terrorism
alone is left to them, to ward off the attacks of the masses.
Unemployment in Spain was one reason why Primo de
Rivera’s regime broke down so suddenly. A revolutionary
situation is ripening in Greece. where unemployment and
the agricultural crisis is becoming graver from day to day;
peasant revolts are breaking out in Greece,- one workers’
demonstration follows another and preparations are being

-made for a general mass strike. In Switzerland, Holland

and the Scandinavian countries, where unemployment is also
increasing, the governments have so far succeeded in keeping
the workers in'check. But here, too, unrest and discontent
are growing from week to week.

Austria.

Unemployment has been a factor in Austrian economy for
some years past. In September there were 300,000 unem-
ployed. Out of a population of six-and-a-half million this is
a very large number. “In order to set industry on its feet

21

 

again,” the bourgeois parties last autumn took a serious step,
on the Italian model, for getting Austria out of the mud. The

Heimweivr (a military fascist organisation) demonstrated its.

strength and the fascist coup d’e'tat which occurred on Sep-
tember 29th, 1929, to which the Austrian social democrats
subjected themselves unconditionally, placed the H eimwehr
minister Schober at the helm. Since the establishment of the
Schober dictatorship another 135,000 workers have joined the
ranks of the u'nemployed. About one-ﬁfth of the entire
Austrian" population have become “state pensioners” because
of unemployment, living a wickedly meagre existence, or
are at the mercy of private charity. '

Austrian social democracy has entered into an alliance
with the fascist minister Schober to suppress the unemployed.
A deputation elected by the unemployed. was thrown out of
the town hall. controlled by social democrats. In Graz and
Vienna, Neustadt the social—democratic mayors prohibited
demonstrations. Unemployed committees formed under
Communist leadership organised a demonstration in Vienna,
in which 5,000 took part, and in Linz 2,000 unemployed
workers demonstrated, despite police measures.

The Frankfurter Zeitung reported the following incident

as characteristic of the situation in Austria. In January the-

Halsmann case came up before the Vienna courts. Halsmann
was accused of having murdered his father. One day an
unemployed man approached the Halsmann family and asked
that all the details of the murder should be written down
exactly for him, and he would give himself up.to the police
and confess to the murder of I-Ialsmann’s father. In return
he asked for nothing except that, when he was released from
prison, Halsmann should give him a job so that he should
no longer be unemployed. The Frankfurter Zeituug com-

" pared Austria itself to this pitiful man, who welcomed prison

as a release from unemployment.

Germany.

The Frankfurter Zeitung seemed to consider that the story
of the unemployed man in the Halsmann case was something
exceptional, and it is sorry for poor Austria, in which such
dreadful things happen. (A similar incident occurred in
Miinchen in_ February.) Are things any better in Germany ?
Is not Germany the country with the greatest numberof
suicides, both absolutely and in proportion to population?

of many unemployed. Some considerable time has passed
since Borsig, the Berlin industrialist, declared that “there are
15 million people too many in Germany, who must either.
emigrate or die.” Since those words were spoken, an im-
provement occurred only during the few months of boom in
1927. When the unemployment ﬁgure sank to half a million
in the middle of 1927, the unemployed thought that there was
a glimmer of hope for a job, and the social fascists rejoiced
that the Communists with their theory of “decayed capital-
ism” had been proved false by the facts.

At about the same time several members of the
Communist Party disputed the Communist thesis of capitalist
development. The right. wing elements around Brandler

enumerated all the factors of capitalist stabilisation and_

derided those Communists who were true to the Party line
and who “dreamed madly enough of capitalist stabilisation
becoming rotten and uncertain." They were supported by
the “conciliators,” who also believed in the stabilisation and
reconstruction of capitalism and who would not listen to any-
thing about the leftward development of the workers.

Now, when there are three and a half million unemployed
on the streets, the Brandlerites can no longer step forward
as the apostles of capitalist stabilisation and console the
workers with pretty tales of a proletarian revolution in the
mythical future. Even in january, 1930, Brandler’_s news-
paper /lrbeiterpolitik wrote: “There is no crisis. It is only
an invention of the capitalists to enable them to carry out
their attacks on the workers, and of the Communist Inter-
national, which uses this talk of crisis to cover up its incorrect
policy.”

VVhile the number of unemployed was growing so rapidly
last October, the capitalists and the social fascists still hoped
that things would not turn out so badly. Since the American
crisis these hopes have been suppressed. As we said above,
very little is expected of further rationalisation.

The leaders of the German bourgeoisie had for some
months expected a check and decline in the forward develop-
ment of industry, and they prepared themselves for the forth-
coming depression. The negotiations held for the purpose
of replacing the Dawes by the Young Plan gave them an

. excellent opportunity. They put forward a plan which, even

if the Young Plan was accepted, was to give them the possi-
bility of surmounting their economic difficulties. They
demanded‘ a reduction T in unemployment beneﬁts. The

N
20

 

 

Reichstag met their request on 3rd October. They demanded
further reductions in social expenditure, because expenditure
for such unproductive purposes prevented the accumulation
of funds. At their Dusseldorf congress in September they
suggested a comprehensive programme for the whole policy
of the state.

In response to these demands the government, through the
social democratic minister Hilferding, introduced a ﬁnancial
reform which relieves the capitalists annually of 1,750 million
marks in taxation and places upon the workers a fresh ﬁscal
burden of 1,700 million marks and provides for further tariffs.
In addition rents are to be increased and the rates for muni-
cipal transfort facilities, for gas, water and electricity are
also to be raised. By these means they hope to get over the
crisis. On 13th December, 1929, Duisberg, the chemical

industrialist, declared at the employers’ congress that: “The

house of German national economy is on ﬁre, and the ﬁre
must be extinguished.” The weapons used to ﬁght the ﬁre
were the fiscal reforms, reduction in social expenditure and
further rationalisations. The higher cost of living, unem-
ployment and the intensity of labour in the highly rationalised

' factories are rapidly driving the workers to the left. The

development of unemployment in Germany is reﬂected in the
following table :-—

The annual report of the National Credit Company con-
tains the following accounts :--

“Orders have decreased greatly in practically all sections
of industry, so that a general decline in industrial employ-
ment has set in. The annual production is below that of the
previous year.”

And it says further:
“that there are now in Germany 4oo,ooo households more
A than before the war without their own dwelling-place

24

 

 

and that the consumption of rye per head of the popula-
tion has decreased by about one-third as compared with
pre-war times, while the total consumption of bread has
decreased by about one-ﬁfth. I The consumption of meat
per head of the population has fallen steadily since
1928.” ‘

The tremendous increase in output, unaccompanied by
any rise in the standard of life; has led to a great increase
in the number of accidents and to a rise in the mortality rate.
The table below gives the accident statistics :—

1926 9,948,000 ‘ 754,000
1927 11,301,000 1,010,000

In the Prussian Landtag Hirtsifer, the Minister for Public
Health, when dealing with the state of public health, made
the terrible admission that the mortality rate in 1929 had in-
creased by 33 per cent. as compared with 1928. In the
months fr0_m July to December, 1929, the real income of the
workers had fallen by 12.9 per cent. and money earnings by
13.6 percent. Hopes are being expressed in the bourgeois

press that unemployment will decrease as a result of the fewer .

births during the war and the practice of birth control at the
present period. A remarkable hope, that of healing unem-
ployment by a declining birth rate 1 The economic situation,
however, has already changed the excess of births over deaths,
which_in 1928 amounted to 6.6 per thousand, into 1.2 in 1929.
In the large towns of Prussia the excess of births overdeaths,
which amounted to 2.52 per thousand in 1928, has been
changed, into anexcess of deaths over births amounting to
2.56 per thousand in 1929. 4

Like their foreign colleagues, the German capitalists see
their only hope of salvation in a still greater labour output
and an increase in the hours of labour. VV. Roelen, doctor
of engineering, wrote an article on “American and German
Mining”.in which the following occurs :—

“One returns (from America) with the painful realisation
that untold millions of tons of coal in the Ruhr must be lost
for practical purposes by mines being compelled to close
down because, with the present legal restrictions o-n hours of
labour, .the.emp10yees cannot save the concerns where they
are working from ruin by working overtime . . . If we were

25

 

 

given greater freedom to dispose of labour power and
machines, we should not only ﬁnd it possible to retain those
workers still employed, we could win back lost markets and

 

again give employment to thousands who were forced to leave .

work because of the decline of the coal industry.”

The German chemical trust, on the other hand, is trying
to get over the crisis temporarily by shortening hours of
labour. The leaders of the chemical industry are imitating
the ve-ry righteous Mr. Charles Schwab, of the Bethlehem
Steel Corporation. The ﬁve-day week is being introduced
in the Hochstev Dye \Vorks ; wages, irrespective of the exist-
ing agreement, are being reduced by 15 per cent. and, for
these decreased wages, the workers are forced to turn out as
much in ﬁve days as they used to in six. The great news-
paper of bourgeois democracy, the F rankfmter Zeitung, also
has its own recipe for eliminating unemployment. It says so
quite clearly :

“It is not the wages which are desirable, but the wages
which are economically possible that must serve as our guid-
ing level.” (According to the Frankfurter Zeitung the wages
which are now being paid are at least 5 per cent. too high.)
“If they (wages) are again adapted to the economic possibili-
ties, then unemployment will disappear, for unemployment

, in Germany is not a structural phenomenon, but is due to

the rapid rise in wages which disturbed the balance of econo-
mic life.”

class Against class.

In all probability the capitalists of Mexico, South America,
South Africa, Australia and Japan will express themselves in
much the same fashion. And all capitalists have the same
recipe to give to the unemployed when they come out on to
the streets demanding bread and work. The brutal attacks
of the police and military on the miners of New South Wales,
who did not want to have their wages reduced, are of the same
character and drawn from the same arsenal as the bullets
with which the unemployed who demonstrated in Hamburg,
Lodz, Bombay or Bukarest were shot down. What the
bourgeoisie cannot do by means of its armed cossacks it tries
to do by laws passed for theisuppression of the revolutionary
working class movement. The worse the economic position
in capitalist states, the more reactionary the legislation. Every
capitalist state thinks it.necessary to create a law for the pro-
tection of they state which will supply the legal justiﬁcation

26

 

 

for the systematic destruction of revolutionary parties and the
murder of defenceless workers clamouring for bread and
work. Shoulder to shoulder with the capitalists, the social
fascists, the labour and trade union leaders, ﬁght against the
workers. Since the social fascists of the yellow trade union
international have failed to save capitalism by establishing
industrial peace, they are now trying to achieve the same
object by emergency laws and the use of terrorism.

The situation of world capitalism and of capitalist economy
in the different countries is, however, so acute that methods
of terrorising the unemployed and starving masses will not
pacify them. The world army of the unemployed is clamour-
ing not only for bread and work. It is a revolutionary factor
of primary importance. The tremendous extent of unem-
ployment exposes the whole rottenness and putrefaction of
the capitalist system.

Behind the unemployed, as behind the workers in the
factories, stand the revolutionary forces grouped under the
leadership of the Communist International. The commun-
ists of all countries will do their utmost to mobilise the whole
mass of employed and unemployed workers for an energetic
attack in reply to the capitalist offensive and the white terror;
they will establish close relations between the unemployed
and the employed, proving to them that the ﬁght against
unemployment is not only the concern of the unemployed
themselves, but of the whole working class.

The workers who still have their jobs, who are daily
threatened by dismissal and whose position is growing worse
and worse through the process of rationalisation, are getting
to understand that there is no sense in passively accepting
the capitalist offensive. Employed and unemployed must act
together, in order to beat back the capitalist attack by a united
struggle. There is no other party but the Communist Party
capable of formulating the demands of factory workers and of
bringing them to a common denominator. All other parties
believe in maintaining the capitalist system; in the present
crisis of capitalism they can only thrust the workers still

‘deeper into wretchedness and poverty.

The communists have formulated the demands of the
employed and unemployed workers. There is no other
possible ﬁght for decreasing unemployment than the ﬁght for
a shorter working day. And there is no other way for the
employed worker to protect himself from the sack than to-

ﬁght against the mass dismissals which are now taking place.
Consequently our ﬁrst demands are :

Stop mass dismissals.

No more overtime. -

Fight for the seven-hour day, for shorter hours in mining
and other dangerous occupations.

Equal pay for equal work.

Better protection for women and young workers.

Work for the unemployed at trade union rates or mainten-

ployment.

Fight against capitalist rationalisation.

VVorkers, rally for the overthrow of the dictatorship of
ﬁnance capital and fascism.

Clear the social fascists out of the working class movement.

Fight for socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

March 6th was the day of international struggle against

world unemployment. The demonstrations were 0-rganised
on the initiative of the Communist Parties of Great Britain,
France, Germany, Czecho-Slovakia, Poland, the Balkan
Federation, Austria. Holland, Belgium, of the VVest
European Bureau of the Communist International, the
European secretariats of the Red Trade U nion International
and the Young Communist International. In all the capi-
talist countries of the ﬁve continents the revolutionary workers
answered the call and when the million-throated cry of the
working masses rang out, demanding bread and work, higher
wages and shorter hours, the world bourgeoisie and the social
fascists everywhere answered with police batons, machine
guns and arrests.

Backwards to Barbarism with capitalism
or
Forward to socialism Along the Road of the soviet Union?
I h The workers in capitalist countries are realising more and
more clearly that capitalist society is incapable of organising
and developing the national economy and of raising the stand-
ards of the working class. The masses are thrust deeper and

deeper into misery by the crisis of capitalism. In only one’

country of the world is the national economy progressing, are
the numbers of unemployed decreasing, wages rising, hours
of labour being shortened and the workers gaining steadily a
higher level of culture. That country is the Soviet Union,
the proletarian fatherland where the construction of socialism,

28

 

 

,2..<....»..——q»

in the realisation of_the Five—Year Plan, has achieved and is
celebrating a tremendous victory. The decision should not
be a difﬁcult one for the proletariat to make.

The Five-Year Plan is not only a plan for increasing
industrial production threefold, for industrialising and collec-
tivising agriculture; it is a plan which will result in the
entire elimination of unemployment. In the course of the ﬁrst
year covered by the plan, the year 1928/29, the number of
unemployed grew less from month to month. This process,
since the beginning of the second year, that is, since autumn,
1929, when the unemployment ﬁgures in Germany and
U.S.A. increased by thousands every day, has continued at
an even greater rate. From January, 1929, to January, 1930,
unemployment in the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics fell
by 19 per cent. The number of unemployed registered at the
labour exchanges of the ,U.S.S.R. on 1st January, 1929, was
1,616,200. On the 1st January, 1930, it was 1,310,000. As
socialist construction proceeds from victory to victory, more
and more of the unemployed will be drawn into the processes
of production. The number of industrial workers among the
unemployed amounts to 14 per cent., that is, 187,000, most of
them unskilled workers‘. In many industries there is actually
a shortage of labour.

A few ﬁgures from the Moscow labour exchange will
illustrate the gradual disappearance of unemployment from

the Soviet Union : in the last ‘quarter of 1929 there were 796‘

unemployed ﬁtters and turners, while the demand for such
workers totalled 1,953; 1,907 unemployed locksmiths with a
demand for 2.827. The corresponding ﬁgures for toolmakers
were 104 and 236, for foundry workers 267 and 369, for
furnacemen 262 and 908. The same is happening in the
Ukraine, in the Don region, in the Urals, in Leningrad. The

number of workers required for the coming building season

exceeds the number of workers employed in building last year
by 60 per cent. V

Unemployment in the towns, therefore, is being rapidly
eliminated, and this process is at the same time of great
cultural value, for it is connected with the training of unskilled
workers, making "them efﬁcient and highly-skilled. In the
course of the present year not less than 280,000 unskilled un-
employed workers will be trained to do skilled work.

It is not only the development of heavy industry, the
gigantic building works, the introduction of the seven-hour
day and the ﬁve-day week (four days’ work and one day rest)

29

 

 

which are solving the problem of unemployment in socialist
fashion, that problem which the capitalist system can ﬁnd no

’ method of solving. On the land, too, the rapid industrialisa-

tion of agriculture, the organisation of great soviet farms,
huge grain factories and collective concerns, are creating ‘wide
avenues of employment. The soviet farms employ thousands
of workers; the building activities demand more and more
workers, the growing use of tractors does the same.

According to the original estimates of the F ive-Year Plan

the number of workers in the U.S.S.R. should increase from:

11,350,000 in 1927/28 to 15,724,000 in 1932/33. But we can
see now that life itself has surpassed the original plans, that

the Five-Year Plan will in all probability be carried out in.

four years and accordingly the ﬁgures given above will actu-
ally be greater. The socialist system of the workers’ state,
by developing productive forces, by increasing the welfare

and therefore the needs of the people, creates unlimited possi-

bilitis of work for all working people.

Faced with the choice of sinking back into barbarism under
capitalism, or going forward along the road taken by the-
Soviet Union to work, welfare and culture, the worker will
choose the road mapped out by the U .S.S.R. This is the-
road of struggle for a new and better life and so the workers
fear the terrorism of their oppressors less and less every
day. That is why they will rally their forces under com-
munist leadership and march .forward until they reach their
goal—the overthrow of the rotten, decaying capitalist system,
and in every country of the world the road will be open for
the building up of socialism, which gives bread and work to
every human being.

WORLD UNEMPLOYMENT

“15 million unemployed in the world; 60 million
starving.”

— Deutsche Bergwerkzeitung, January, 1930.

There is unemployment all over the world. Nobody can
doubt this any longer. All the capitalist states and the
colonial countries—-——with only one exception, France ——have
been struck by an acute economic depression which in most
countries has assumed the character of a ‘grave economic
crisis. All the pretty pictures and hopes of the leaders of
capital economy cannot change this fact one iota. The crisis
is extending, it is becoming more serious. Lands which even
a few weeks ago seemed to have been overlooked by the
depression have now been affected by it. Industries which up
to the present have been fairly prosperous are now witnessing
a sharp decline in orders; the number of bankruptcies is in-
creasing.» Competition on the world markets is growing more
bitter. The home market is rapidly diminishing. Gigantic
sums are being spent to maintain the millions of unemployed,
which were formerly accumulated by the capitalists. ‘

All over the capitalist world the leaders of industry are-

meeting to discuss the prescriptions which must be made up

for capitalism in its hour of need. But they have been unable-
to ﬁnd new methods for healing this sickness, and they will;

never be able to -ﬁnd any. The partial stabilisation of capitals

ism and capitalist rationalisation have only led to a great’
decrease in ‘the workers’ standard of life and to a greatly‘

intensiﬁed struggle for markets and for the sources of raw
materials. The capitalists are at the end of their wits. The

crisis which is developing will take caoitalism a long way on _'

the road towards its collapse. ' It is impossible to speak any
longer of the stabilisation and reconstruction of the capitalist
system. Those who believe in this miracle and all the clam-
orous apostles of this theory must hold their peace. Facts
have a language of their own. The ﬁgures of unemployment
speak for themselves. Here is the picture they present :—

A number of these ﬁgures are estimates, still they are not
far removed from the truth; probably many of th-em should
be higher. In this gigantic army of the unemployed there
are not included the unemployed of China, India, Indonesia,
Indo-China and the smaller countries of Asia and North
Africa. In these countries, too, there are millions out of
work who, with their families, are dying of starvation.
Thousands and millions are dying in China to-day, and the
christian missionaries and sisters shed some hypocritical tears;
they’ve got nothing else to spare for the millions who are
starving, these christ-like representatives of capital. Nor
has the head of the christian catholics, the Pope in Rome,
any time to concern himself ab-out them. At the moment he
is much too busy organising a new crusadeagainst the Soviet
Union, zealously supported by the protestant and methodist
priests. the Jewish rabbis and the mohammedan mullahs.
The kings of ﬁnance and industry are spending the “spare
farthings” of their humblesubjects for cannon, ammunition
and armoured cruisers in order to take part in the crusade
against the Soviet Union, .

_ . Terrorism ‘Against the Starving.
Since the masses thrust into wretched misery and death

by the capitalist system no longer regard their position as
an inﬂiction from God. as was perhaps the case in the Middle

 

 

 

Ages when great catastrophes afflicted mankind, there is a
great deal of work for the ruling class and its social fascist
lackeys to do. The bat-on as a means to pacify the masses
when they express their discontent in a more or less mild
fashion, and riﬂes, machine guns and armoured cars when
the unemployed and the starving take more vigorous
measures, are fully employed. Every day we can read in the
capitalist and labour press about the energetic services ren-
dered by the police and the military in maintaining “law and
order.” But the masses will not be paciﬁed .because——as the

same newspapers assure us daily—they are urged on by the’

communists and by Moscow. Without Moscow and the
Communist Parties, of course, the 18 or 20 million unem-
ployed, and the 60 million who are starving, would remain

peacefully in their corners, dying with a blessing on their lips.

for the prosperity and success of the capitalist paradise and
for the well-being of the bellies of labour officials.
Christian-bourgeois society is a very proper and decorous
lady. She cannot bear the spectacle of an ill-humoured
crowd, still less the “horrid sight” and “repulsive smell” of
unemployed and starving workers. The streets were made
for trafﬁc and not for demonstrators to “create a nuisance”
in or to use for hunger marches, their favourite method of
cheering empty stomachs. To prevent such a nuisance,

whether it occurs in VVarsaw, Vienna, Athens, Hamburg,‘
London or Detroit, the forces of the state must be employed-

On this point Pilsudski, Schober, Mussolini, Hermann.
Miiller, MacDonald, Hoover and the Balkan tyrants are
unanimous, however much they may differ otherwise. The
democracy of the fascist “states of’ order” opens wide its
prison doors to receive the rioters and so, besides the police,
the state prosecutors and the judges of bourgeois justice, “un-
influenced by class prejudices and wholly independent,’_’ are
also kept pretty busy. And there are. thank God, still enough
patriots in the world willing to give up the eight-hour day
to increase production a hundredfold if such measures are de-
manded by the grave situation of the fatherland, threatened
by the unemployed.

The causes of World Unemployment.

All the efforts of these faithful servants of the state will
not, however, suffice to solve the problem of unemployment
and mass starvation. Even if the capitalists wanted to wipe

5

 

 

out the whole army of “hungry rats” who are now beginning
to march, the causes of the present crisis of capitalism still
remain, leading -to world unemployment. The crisis and un-
employment will not disappear until their roots have been

destroyed. The causes of world unemployment are not to be ,

found in the present crisis alone. They have their roots in
the structure of capitalism and in the post-war crisis of the
capitalist system as a whole. Capitalists have arrived at the
point “where they can no longer feed their wage workers.”

This does not mean that market and seasonal conditions
were not contributory factors in the crisis and in unemploy-
ment in the different countries. But when building workers
and land workers are unemployed in the Argentine, in
Mexico, in South Africa and Australia at the same time, just
as in Warsaw, Berlin, London or New York, it is clear that
the cause is not seasonal ‘(that is, the winter), but that there
are other causes. In the southern hemisphere at the present
time the roofs are not covered in snow, nor does the mortar
freeze. VVhy are the miners, the textile workers, the metal
and ship-building workers unemployed in all countries, if it
is merely a case of simple market stagnation?

There were many crises of capitalism in the pre-war
period; there were often large armies of unemployed in
various countries. But what is now happening in the post-
war period is fundamentally different from the earlier depres-
sions; the cycles are now shorter, the crises more acute;
unemployment has assumed a permanent character. Capi-
talist rationalisation throws great masses of workers out of
the process of production, for a long period, if not for ever.
The essential gravity of the present unemployment consists
precisely in the fact that, in addition to the millions of
chronically unemployed there are now further millions unem-
ploye_d because of the crisis.

RationaIisation—Worker o-I Miracles.

Misled by the tremendous capacity of the internal
American market in the last few years, the idea arose in
capitalist circles, and spread beyond them, that the “Ameri-
can economic miracle” could be repeated in othencountries,
if only the American method of maintaining prosperity was
adopted. The battle-cry of rationalisation was born. By
means of rationalisation all problems would be solved ‘with-
out diﬂiculty. Since German national economy -was particu-

larly heavily burdened as a result of the war, and the greatest
efforts had been made in that country to ﬁnd a way out of
the crisis, the captains of industry, the governments, the re-
formist trade union and party leaders vied with each other in
clamouring for the rationalisation of production.

Capitalist rationalisation was carried out in many coun-
tries. Nevertheless, there is an economic cris.is which grows
more acute from week to week ; there is world unemployment
on a scale never before dreamed of. And the strongest fortress
of capitalism, the U.S..A., is deeply affected by the crisis and
by unemployment; and since it is the .premier country of world
capitalism, the crisis in American national economy neces-
sarily accentuates the crises in other countries or even gives
rise to them. A demand is being made for a “second
rationalisation,” but not with the feeling of future triumph
over depression; it is a cry of anxiety and doubt lest further
capitalist rationalisation should make the position worse in-

.stead of improving it. The voices expressing scepticism

about the rationalisation miracle are becoming more numer-
ous. Leaden anxiety oppresses the economic leaders of
European countries. They -are afraid of a huge ﬂood of com-
modities from the United States, which would utterly destroy
any hope of improvement in European industry, even with
the best rationalisation. The problem which capitalism has
to solve to get out of its present crisis is not that of raising
the productive capacity of«its economy, but of winning mar-
kets for the proﬁtable disposal -of those masses of commodities
which its present machinery is capable of turning ‘out over
and above the amounts demanded on the world markets. This
is a problem which capitalism can.not solve.

The Deeper causes of the crisis.

From 1900 to I914 (the outbreak of the world war) world
trade grew extraordinarily quickly. Germany and the United
States increased their share each by 100 per cent. Many
other countries also considerably increased their imports and
exports; world trade as a whole nearly doubled in those years.
Because of this extraordinary extension of production the com-
petitive struggle on the home markets was slowed down in
the chief capitalist countries. Wages rose and unemployment
fluctuated within very narrow limits (2 to 3 per cent. of the
total number of workers), although even then workers were
continually being dismissed as a conseq_uence of t-echnical
improvements. These, however, found other -employment
